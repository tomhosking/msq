0,Non-EU citizen with EU Blue Card working outside EU but with address in Germany,"I am in a weird situation here and need your advice. I am an EU Blue Card holder and I currently work for a company in Germany. I would like to go back to my home country but remain working remotely for this German company. I would still pay German taxes, healthcare, etc.  Am I correct to say that if I have an address in Germany (let's say I rent an apartment even though I don't physically live there) but am abroad, my EU Blue Card is still valid? Because in theory I never left Germany since I ""live"" there. Do they check passport stamps or only if I had residence registered? "
1,"Valid out-of-state DMV driver's license but class 7, moving from British Columbia to Washington","I just moved to Seattle from British Columbia, Canada and I have my class 7 license. According to dmv.com, ""If you have a valid out-of-state DMV driver’s license, you will not be required to pass any additional tests."" I have also heard that if you are over 18 and have two years of driving experience, you do not need to take any tests. Does this only apply to a full license? Or does it apply to someone who is over 18, has their class 7, and has two years of driving experience?  "
2,How to prove you live somewhere when you live at some friend house for the National Insurance Number in UK?,"Got a problem : I will apply for the National Insurance Number in UK, I need to prove I live somewhere they ask me for an invoice with my name ... : / Yet I live at my friend's house ... How can I prove it then ? Should I sleep in an hostel for a day ?

Here is the official link about applying for a National Insurance Number :  [website]So far I have tried to open an account up and put our address on there, so that I have something official as Bank statements seems to be a good thing to prove address.

3,How can I be with my Swedish wife for the birth of our child?,"My wife is Swedish and she has been visited me over and over again in my country, more then 8 times, which gets expensive.  Now my wife is pregnant with our child and she will give birth in February. I applied to Sweden for a short stay visa, for a 90-day visit starting in December. I will get the answer on Friday. I didnt apply for along stay visa.  I'm not working in my country and I just finished high school. Our mariage is registered at the Swedish tax agency. I'm worried that I'm not going to be with her for the birth of my first child.  Are there any laws or anything else we can use in our situation? I know we rushed a little in getting pregnant before even we settled arrangements, but it's very important for us to be together, especially right now.   What can we do if the 90-day visa is not be approved? "
4,How can I have my child born in Australia without going bankrupt?,"I've tried doing my best to research this subject on my own. Official resources are giving me conflicting information (more on that below). Unofficial (anecdotal) resources, such as forums, are giving me some worst-case scenarios, and now I'm dreading exorbitant hospital bills. The answer to this question could be the difference between free health care (as it's now in The Netherlands) and $15,000 or more in bills (if I am to believe anecdotal sources).  I'm looking for answers backed by official sources. Anecdotal answers can provide me with information and prepare me for what's coming, but I really want to know for sure.  I'm migrating to Australia from The Netherlands with my daughter and pregnant wife on a 482 Temporary Skills Shortage visa. When we arrive, my wife will be 7 months pregnant. As a citizen from The Netherlands, we are eligible for Medicare under the Reciprocal Health Care Agreements (RHCA). This should give us a Yellow Medicare Card:     A Medicare card is [...] usually green in colour, although interim cards are light blue and cards for Reciprocal Health Care Agreement visitors are light yellow.   To secure the TSS visa, we'll also take out an Australian health insurance that meets the immigration requirements, because it's possible that RHCA Medicare doesn't fully cover those. However, these insurances all seem to have a waiting period for pregnancy coverage, usually at least 12 months before the due date. Since my wife is due to give birth 2 months after we arrive in Australia, the insurance needed for the TSS visa will not cover the childbirth.  So, we can just rely on the RHCA Medicare for that, right?  Well, if you take a close look at the requirements, you'll notice (emphasis mine):     You’ll need to show your passport, evidence of your current visa and:         proof you have valid insurance in the Netherlands Health Insurance Scheme, or   your valid European Health Insurance Card with the initials NL      So here's the catch: in The Netherlands, you cannot stay insured if you do not receive income from The Netherlands and do not live in The Netherlands. I'll be employed by an Australian employer, only receive income from Australia, and I will no longer be registered in any Dutch municipality.  Hm, that sucks, but what about travel insurance?  Same deal. Our current travel insurance has worldwide coverage, but as soon as we exit The Netherlands, the insurance ends.  Does this mean that in fact I can't secure RHCA Medicare? It seems that I fall into an edge case where I can't get Dutch health insurance, nor travel insurance, nor Medicare, nor Australian health insurance that will cover the pregnancy and birth of our child.  We really do not want to migrate to Australia separately (as in, my wife stays behind in NL to give birth, then come over later). We'd also prefer to not delay the migration entirely, as my employer needs me to fill a position. If I delay, it would have to be delayed by several months (2 months until birth, then recovery before being able to pick up and leave).  You mentioned conflicting information earlier?  Yes. On one hand, not living in The Netherlands and receiving income from The Netherlands means I can't stay insured there. Also, when the intention is to leave The Netherlands permanently (as you usually do when emigrating), you can't stay insured there. On the other hand, the TSS visa is technically temporary, in my case 4 years (482 Medium-term stream). So perhaps even if my personal intention is to emigrate, according to the ""rules as written"" I'll be living and working outside The Netherlands temporarily. It's unclear to me which situation takes precedence.  What are my options to avoid a ~$15,000 hospital bill for care which would otherwise be free? "
5,Non EU citizen living in the uk,"I have been in the Uk on different visas for nearly 12 years now and have been married to an EU citizen for 4 and a half.

6,What documents are required for the EEA family permit?,"I am a newbie here. My husband, an EU national (Italian), and I, non-EU (Nigerian) are planning to move to the UK from Italy, with our children (EU nationals). We have been married for 8 years, since 2010, but started living together from 2012. I have gathered the following documents to submit with the application:   My passport (non-EU) Italian Permanent Residency permit (copy) Spouse's passport (EU national) Children's Italian ID cards (copy) Marriage Certificate (Modello B, copy of the Nigerian) Children's birth certificates Certificate of Residency from my commune (in Italian) Tenancy Agreement(dated Feb 2015-Feb 2019) showing both our names with the same address (in Italian) Utility bills showing my spouse's name with the same address (2016, 2017) Hospital bills showing my name with the same address (2017, 2018) Spouse's EU national work contract, payslips, and last 6 month's bank statements (in Italian) Few marriage photos and recent family photos (about 10) Cover letter from my spouse EU national   I would like to know if the employment details and bank statements are really necessary to add?  Do I still need to provide evidence of relationship dated back to 2012 when we started living together. Although my husband was living there before I joined him, my name is on neither the utility bills nor the tenancy agreement contracts.  Are there any other things that are missing? "
7,Third-party citizen married to EU citizen to work in the UK,"I am a Brazilian citizen married to an Italian wife living in an EU country and I've got a job offer in England while outside the UK and we are willing to go.   I understand EU citizens have free-movement to the UK (so far) and the right to work there and I do acknowledge that spouses have the right to live/work there however because we have a baby she cannot work, therefore I would work alone instead of her start working and I ""inherit"" such right from her.  The question is: can we move there and I start working before her in the given scenario? If so, would it be straight-forward enough as going there and file for an ID/residence or are there other bureaucracies to look after before landing in London? "
8,Blue Card France,"I have seen plenty of answers for the the following question for Germany but I am specifically asking for France.  What happens if a person quits/losses their job in France after the initial 2 yrs but before the 3rd year. How long can they stay in the France looking for a job before they have to leave? What are the requirements on the new job?  I have seen conflicting answers on websites so I am sure there will be conflicting responses here as well. Thus, I would really appreciate of answers are supplemented with references of official websites or personal experiences. "

10,Tax as an Italian resident,"I am a US citizen in Italy and just submitted my documents for dual citizenship.  I have residency in the Comune where I am applying. I will now be returning to the US.  I was told I need to keep the residency until my citizenship application is accepted.  On another forum I was told that I am liable for taxes on my US assets while I have my residency in Italy.  Is this correct information?  Do I need to keep the residency until I get my Italian passport?  Also can I apply for the AIRE online from the US?  Thank you, and sorry if these questions have already been addressed.  Theresa "
11,UK comparability diploma for IT council,"I am Portuguese and I am also a bachelor of Information Systems.  I would like to make a comparability assessment of my degree to join some university in the UK.  Does anyone have more accurate information on which council is appropriate to contact and ask for more details?  On my research, I found The British Computer Society. Is that one the right council?  Edit:  This is the link of a brazilian website giving information about the use of NARIC services or directly with the organization that will avaliate the diploma.  Pay attention to the following sentence:  Portuguese: ""Você pode ir diretamente ao órgão que vai validar seu diploma""  English: ""You can go directly to the organ that will validate your diploma""  [website]If you desire, you can translate the text to get a better understanding about what they are saying.

12,Do I need a tenancy agreement in my name for T2 Dependant visa [UK]?,"Im applying for my daughter to come join me in March 2019. She was born in UK but had to travel back for a few months as her mother needed to be back home for some family matters (The mother has a T2 Dependant visa until May 2019).  Since they have left, I have moved into shared accommodation where I pay for only 1 room. I dont have any tenancy agreement in my name as I saw no reason to pay for a full house when I needed only 1 room for myself.  Now that I am filling her application, I am asked for a UK address where she will be staying.   What address should I give? Should I give my current UK address? But I dont have a tenancy agreement for this.  What are my options? I cant even go rent a house from now, just for the visa, that will be very expensive and wasteful 4 months rent pay.  I am sure many people would have faced a similar problem to mine. Please advise what to do.  Thank you "
13,travelling out of country on L1B while TN i-129 petition is submitted,"My current employer got me the L1B. However, they were not interested to sponsor me for Green Card. In the meantime, I got an offer from another Fortune 500 employer that is willing to sponsor me, but can only take me with TN. They sent the TN i-129 application yesterday. Today, my employer told me that they are okay with providing required documentation for the sponsorship as long as I pay for the processing fees.  Is there a simple way to withdraw the TN i-129 petition?  If I go out of the country and come back, can I get in with my L1B (L1B expiry is next year)?  Will traveling and re-entering the country get the TN i-129 petition abandoned? "
14,EU Blue card application from Italy,"I've seen multiple questions regarding the EU blue card but I had additional queries.  I am an Indian working as a User Experience designer in Italy for almost 2 years.  I do get paid more than the threshold amount indicated on the EU website.   My question is if I were to apply for the EU blue card,   Do I need to get my Uni certificate evaluated? (I did a one year course here in Italy and I was informed that it is recognized by the Italian Govt.) In the requirements, they mentioned that you have to work for the same employer for 18 months after you apply.  Does this mean if I have already worked 2 years for the same employer and apply for the Blue card, I must work another 18 months before I can relocate to another country? Or does it imply 18 months from the start of my contract?   Can anyone help me understand this? "
15,"Get Permanent Residence now, or wait until March 2019?","I'm in kind of dilemma right now and confused.  So beginning of this November, 2018, I just completed my 5 years residency in the UK but my non-EEA family RC will expire in April 23rd. I'm married to an EEA member since 2013. Should I apply for my PR now or wait until end of March 2019 to apply for settled status? Also the future isn't clear as my EEA wife might be planning to initiate divorce procedure or move out of the house, however I can't tell when and how long it may take. If I wait until March and apply for settled status, should I still need to be member of EEA family to get the status? Also we have 2 kids and one has completed 5 years stay in November too. Please advise. Thanks "
16,Multiple Non-Immigrant B visas for Thailand?,"Is is possible to have multiple non-Immigrant category B visas for employment for Thailand at the same time?   I got an employment offer from a company in Thailand, and applied for a non-Immigrant category B visa with their invitation letter at the local VFS center in India. However a week later, I got another better offer from another company in Thailand itself?   Can I use the existing visa to go work for the other company? Or apply for another visa of the same category while there is an existing valid one in the same passport? "
17,Strategies for UK migration as a software dev?,"Goal: What would be the easiest way to migrate to the UK and live there permanently?  Possible Options I can think of:   Option 1: Apply for a job that offers Visa Sponsorship. Then get sponsored to move over under the 5 year visa. I'm not really fully in the range of Senior developer, so more likely to have luck with Intermediate developer jobs, which I don't think are covered in the skills shortage list.  Option 2: Apply for the 2 year youth mobility visa, and then apply for all jobs over there remotely, even if it's not visa sponsored. I'm unsure what would happen at the end of the 2 years? Option 3: Apply for the 2 year youth mobility visa, move to the UK with nothing and then apply for  contract jobs and the like. Option 4: Go and study something in the UK, and then try and find another development job after a year of studying.    My Status: I have been trying to apply for the jobs offering Visa sponsorship, but without achieving any interviews yet. People I have talked to usually recommend Option 3, but this worries me a lot because applying for jobs is really tough/stressful for me (I might be a low-mid grade candidate) and applying for jobs from a position of unemployment makes you an undesirable candidate and more desperate.   Background:   Home country: New Zealand  Desired Destination: London, UK  Field: Software Development  Experience: 4.5 years  Age: &lt;25  Education level: Bachelors "

24,Registering French nationality - name change and where to get help,"My mother was born in France and both of her parents are French. She moved to the UK and married my (British) father. When she did this, she changed her surname to his. My parents were married when I was born but they divorced shortly after and my mother moved back to France. She stopped using her married surname when she moved back to France and I don't think the French government were ever made aware of the marriage or of my birth.  I'm now 25. I was born in the UK and have always lived in the UK. I speak pretty good French but I'm not completely fluent. When I was 21, I changed my surname by deed poll. I have my English birth certificate in my old name, the deed poll and my British passport in my new name.  I can also get my mother's French birth certificate, French passport, English marriage certificate and English divorce certificate.   I am self employed in the UK and my Self Assessment will show an income well above the SMIC in the 16/17 tax year.   I want to register my French nationality to get a French passport. The key motivation is to make travel within Europe as easy as possible after Brexit. I am also motivated, to a lesser extent, to have a French passport just to feel more a part of France.  Despite ""being"" French, proving it and obtaining a French passport seems like a very complicated process. I'm trying to figure out:   If it's even worth the effort (assuming Brexit doesn't automatically afford British subjects the right to travel in the Schengen zone and I continue to travel within the EU regularly), I believe name changes are going to complicate this. Is the French government likely to recognise my deed poll, given changing one's name requires (I believe) a court order in France? Can anyone confirm the only real hurdle to getting the passport is obtaining a CNF as described in this link, which is simply a case of assembling documents and delivering them in person? Will I need to attend any language/culture tests? Would it be sensible to employ a solicitor to help?  "
25,Chain Italian citizenship,"I'm British and living in Germany with my SO who is also British.   The prospect of brexit quite understandably has us in a weird emotional state somewhere between fear, anger and disgust. We don't plan on staying in Germany forever but nor do we want to move back to the UK and be stuck there. We want to keep European free movement.   But in our case there is a potential life line.   My SO's grandfather is Italian.   For her this means she can get an Italian passport pretty easily. She has never done this in the past as saw no point but the option is there.   For me things are more complicated but we are discussing getting married so I can share in her Italian Ness.   I've checked the guidelines and apparently you need to be married for 3 years before you can get this (18 months with kids)   A few questions. Some quite theoretical and not related to our situation:  1: is there any probation on Italian citizenship? That is she could get it today and then marry me the day after and start the counter?  2: what if we are married before she becomes Italian? Does the time I am married to her count or only the time I was married to an Italian?   3: purely theoretical as no plans for kids.... But if there was a kid involved how does this affect the counter? Say we are a year without and then we have one. It goes down to 18 months right away or it assumes I only have to wait 18 months or a proportional time off the wait is taken?  4: are there any language requirements? Both of us only know a few words of Italian.   Edit  5 : a potential complication I have only just became aware of. Her grandfather WAS Italian. To take British citizenship he had to renounce this as Italy did not accept dual citizenship in the past (they do now).  Does this affect things? Any dependency on whether her mother was born before or after this? "
26,Moving to an EEA country as an EEA citizen,"When they say EEA citizens have the right to ""live, work, establish business and study"" in another EEA country and this right is ""up to three months"".   If no other immigration route exists (EU national on another EU state, for example): What happens after this period? And what if some EEA national stays 89 days and then another 89 during the same year? Under what conditions, can they deny foreign EEA citizens to stay longer? "
27,What is a valid document for EEA residence card?,"My wife has a family permit visa and we're now applying to get an EEA residence permit.  It's required that we send our documents to prove identity:     Proof of identity and nationality, such as   a valid passport, travel document or national identity card   But it also says     Your application may take up to 6 months.   Does that mean we'll stay 6 months without our passports? That's not a huge deal for me as I have my EU ID card but her only valid document here is her passport.  What else can we use as a valid document for her if they'll keep it for 6 months? "
28,"What kind of jobs do people usually take during a Working Holiday, if you can't work for one employer for more than 3 months?","My citizenship allows me to travel to New Zealand for a working holiday. On the surface it sounds great since salaries in NZ are very good and I could find a job easily as a software developer. However looking into the T&amp;C it seems that you can't take a job for one employer for more than 3 months, which means most IT companies would not be interested in such an employee.  So what kind of jobs do people usually take during working holidays? Is it limited to unskilled stuff like berry picking? Is it mostly a 'holiday' rather than 'work'? Or do people simply ignore the 3 months limit and get permanent jobs all the time? "
29,Doing a job in the UK,"I am a non-EU citizen, now in Poland. I want to get a temporary packaging worker job in UK.  What is the first thing I need to do now?

30,How do the different Southeast Asian countries compare in terms of ease of long-term staying and legally working?,"How do the different Southeast Asian countries compare in terms of ease of long-term staying and legally working?  Some background info, I've been in Indonesia for a while now on a cultural study program, but I now want to start to do remote work, however the visa system does not make this easy. You can walk the legal route which is hard and costly (the cost alone is a small local salary every month) or even if you'd be willing to do it illegally, it's costly since you can stay only 6 months at a time and the paperwork for that is time-consuming and/or fairly expensive too.  So I'm looking for alternatives in Southeast Asia. These are of course all unique countries, but I like the culture in general, the climate and that life is cheap on average. I'd prefer to work part-time and be able to sustain a pretty simple life, while not flying out often just to renew visas. How do these countries compare for that? Any that really stand out?  In order not to have this too opinion-based, I am looking for a comparison of at least several of the countries in the region. "
31,Iranian student with Hungarian residency permit staying in Italy for more than 90 days,"I'm an Iranian student studying in Hungary with a 2-year residency permit. I have a project in Italy, which would take around 5 months. I came to Italy from Hungary on March 1st. Do you think I can leave Italy after 90 days and then come back again? Or is there any way to do this without asking for an Italian residency permit? "
32,"US tax form 1040NR asks me to enter my ""Occupation in the United States""","Anybody who is not living in the United States and not a citizen of the United States, is classified by the US tax authorities as a ""non resident alien"". Any of these NRAs who earn money in the United States, however, need to file taxes on that income with the form 1040NR.  I am filling out this form, as I have a few work related stock option benefits for which I have earned some small amount of dividends.  At the bottom of the form, I am asked to fill in my ""Occupation in the United States."" The official instructions state, ""Be sure to date your return and enter your occupation in the United States.""  So a question here for anybody who may know: What is my ""occupation in the united states""?? Could it possibly be the same thing as my occupation, which is not in the United States? Or maybe is my occupation just ""investor""? or Unemployed, or none?  To be honest I am a little uncomfortable giving the factual answer (""investor""), as my income in this occupation is only $100 and that is, in principle, lying because it suggests a situation that is not true.

33,Tax treaty USA-Italy: scholar/teacher (art. 20) tax exemptions and implications,"Suppose I entered US in year x month y with J1 visa, as a scholar/postdoctoral researcher. My question regards my status during year x+2: assuming that I also stay in US during full year x+2, is it true that during such year I will still be considered non-resident alien for tax purposes until month y-1, and therefore   I will still benefit from tax treaty article 20, and I won't pay social security/medicare tax   exactly until that month (as opposed to ending in previous calendar year), because art. 20 is protected by saving clause in such treaty?   For this same year, which form(s) of 1040 series will I have to file?   EDIT 3: MY CURRENT UNDERSTANDING: answer to 1 is positive, because of exemption from saving clause. For full year x+2, I will however be resident alien and therefore file 1040 and pay social sec/medicare. Now I don't see any contradiction, but please feel free to correct me.  Relevant links: res vs non-res, tax treaty, soc sec. "

Since the ILR expires if the person continuously lives in outside of UK,  1. what would be the best option to get my daughter to UK to study her A-levels? 2. Shall i able to renew her previous ILR some how?  3. or should i use the option of 'spouse or family of settled person' to get fresh visa? 4. What would be the minimum income i need to show to the home office? 5. or is getting her to EU first and then to UK? "
38,My Girlfriend got a Fulbright to Konstanze Germany how can I go with her?,"My girlfriend and I are both US citizens, and she was recently awarded a Fulbright that will pay for her to do research in Konstanze Germany for 10 months.   Going with her sounds like an amazing opportunity to learn more about Germany and to practice my German, but I have a few questions.    Would it be a bad idea for me to just go with a tourist visa and then apply for a work or study visa? The german consulate says Americans can do this. Would taking classes in German in Konstanze constitute studying in Germany? How hard is it to get a study visa?  If my girlfriend is able to pay most of our living expenses, what would I need to qualify for a work visa? What sort of employment could I look for before or after I arrive in Konstanze? How hard is it to get a work visa?  Will I need to buy health insurance while I am living in Germany?   "
39,Work Visa for Canada,"I am from India, I have got a job offer from Canada and they asked me to give all my details by mail as in  Name(s): Date of Birth: Gender: Nationality: Permanent Address: Marital Status: Mobile number:  Telephone Number: Languages Spoken: Guardian (Parent): Passport Number:  And they said they will give a work visa, so should I provide those details to them? and they also said it will cost 35000 Rs only. What should I do? "
40,Can my family apply for another UK visitor visa before their current one has not expired?,"I am trying to get my family to the UK for a 2-month stay with me. They have got their visa last week, however, due to some unforeseen circumstances, they are now only able to travel towards the end of their currently granted visa period. This means they will not be able to spend 2 months in the UK as we were originally planning. I was wondering if they can apply for another visa before their current visa expires on the grounds that they never used their current visa? Has anyone done this before? What are the chances of their application being successful?  Update  I managed to get a response from UKVI that my family can apply for another visa while their current visa is still running. This is on the basis that they have not travelled. I am not sure if I was very clear when I asked them the question in the first instance. This is because there was a limit to the number of words I could use to write up my question. I will give it another go "
41,B1/B2 to green card,"If someone with a B1/B2 valid for 10 years applies for green card, does the visa becomes invalid? Do they give work when you first apply, or are there other things that happen before the green card is received? "

43,Male US/Russian dual citizen returning to Russia at 28. Possible risks?,"I'm a 28-year-old male with a dual US/Russian citizenship who's going to be entering Russia for the first time in maybe 15 years. I'm slightly nervous about being able to get out once I'm in, since the US consulate won't be able to help me if something comes up. Details about me:   I only have a (current) zagranichniy passport. My vnutreniy passport has long expired. I am (apparently) propisan to a flat in St. Petersburg, even though I haven't lived there since I was a kid. I attended university in the US and haven't been back to Russia during conscription age (18-27).   Here's what I'm concerned about:   Is propiska the same thing as residency, according to the law? Will it ""override"" the fact that my permanent residence is actually in the US? Constitutionally, Russians are legally allowed to enter and leave the country at will — unless they've been drafted. Does the voyenkomat know about me if I'm propisan to a flat but haven't lived in the country since the 90's? If there was a conscription notice sent to this address but I never signed for it, could I still be considered ""drafted"" by some definition of the word (and thus barred from leaving)? Have there been any instances of males older than 27 being conscripted? (E.g. if the government thinks you dodged the draft.) If I'm staying for less than 90 days, do I have to register as a dual citizen (as per the 2014 law)? Could there be any complications if I leave the country directly into the Schengen zone or Japan (by train/ferry) using my US passport, as opposed to flying directly back to the US? Are there any other risks I should be aware of?   Hopefully there won't be any problems, but I just want to make sure I have all my bases covered, since I don't know any male US/Russian citizens who are my age and have visited the motherland in recent years. Thank you! "

46,Chinese passport,"Since this topic is a bit sensitive to be asked directly to the Chinese Embassy, I wonder if someone can answer or knows anyone with experience.   PRC (China) does not allow dual citizenship, so if you are a Chinese and get a different passport, you lose the Chinese citizenship.  My question is: What happens if the ex-Chinese citizen, after 2-3 years, decides that actually having a Chinese passport was better (for example: he/she wants to move back to China)? Does anybody know if Chinese government would allow this person to give up the new passport and apply again for a Chinese one?  "
47,"Can the French ""long stay"" visa be used to acquire permanent residency in France?","The French long stay visa allows one to live in France without working/studying/doing business of any kind, as long as one has sufficient savings. In theory, does this visa allow one to acquire French permanent residency after 5 years?  In theory, Council Directive 2003/109/EC would force France to give out permanent residency to such people, but perhaps there's an exception for people who merely have a ""visa"" rather than a ""residency permit""? "
48,Daughter wants German citizenship but wants to keep her naturalised Australian citizenship,"My 18-year-old daughter was born in the USA to a German citizen (her father). We moved to Australia when she was 6 months of age and she became naturalised as a dual US/AU at about 5. She has spent time in Europe with her German family and would like to move to Germany for university when she graduates. She doesn't want her US citizenship, but would like to keep her Australian citizenship, as her sister and I still live here, plus she has friends etc.   If she first revoked her US citizenship, then applied for German citizenship, how can she keep the Australian one? I know it is possible but my question is, how? For example, if she had an apartment in her name, would she be able to use real estate ties as a reason.  Or, can she, through her father, somehow obtain permanent residency there, and would that be easier? "
49,Trying to figure out my tax residency,"I'm a Finnish citizen and have spent the last 6 years in the US. I finished a Ph.D. in May last year and I was on a J-1 visa until February last year. At that point I switched over to a G-4 visa due to my wife's work. Since graduation I've worked in the US as a G-4 dependent on an EAD, so I owe US taxes for that.  Now my problem is that the IRS has the so called ""substantial presence test"". Last year and in the years before that, I always satisfied the substantial presence test, so I was considered a resident for tax purposes. The problem with the G-4 visa is that days spent in the US in that status are not counted for the test.  I traveled quite a bit in 2014/2013 visiting a few research institutes abroad for extended periods of time, so that when I do the substantial presence test for last year, I don't go over the limit, i.e. the test doesn't consider me a tax resident. The problem is that I'm not resident anywhere now it seems. Finland doesn't even require me to file taxes anymore, because I've been abroad long enough.  Is there a requirement to be a tax resident somewhere? Should it be the US in my case? How do I communicate such a thing to the IRS in my tax return if that is the case? "
50,Ireland - Temporary consulting work needs visa?,"Would I legally be able to do consulting work on location in Ireland during a short stay (visa-free under 3 months), billed to my home country as a foreign service provider (rather than being paid a salary)?

51,Paying of Tax at the Airport in Australia?,"I understand from the Australia government webpage, we are allow to bring in AUS[tex]1200+ and did not get a GST/Tax refund in Singapore, do I still need to pay for tax at Australia airport?  If I have to pay for tax but have either loss or throw the receipt away for the laptop, how will customs charge me for the tax? How is it able for custom to tell if the item is new? Or if the items has been brought for a year or not?  If I received gifts from my friends at the airport in Singapore and bring it back to Australia, do I need to pay tax? But what if the gifts were given a year ago, do I need to pay tax? "

54,"Tax treaty benefits: when was my ""date of arrival""?","I am a researcher on a J1 visa employed by a US university.  The USA has a tax treaty with my country, Romania, based on which I believe my income in the USA is exempt from tax ""for a period not exceeding 2 years from the date of his arrival in that other Contracting State"" (in the exact words of the treaty).  Six years ago, I visited a different US university for 4 weeks on a B1 visa.  It was a short research visit (i.e. I was not employed, but accommodation and a per diem was provided). I hadn't been back to the USA until I got this J1 visa.  Does that previous visit on a B1 visa affect the tax treaty benefits at all?  Specifically, what is the interpretation of ""from the date of his arrival""?  Should it be counted from 6 years ago (meaning that the period of 2 years have long expired), or should it be counted from when I arrived on the J1 visa?  Most importantly, I am looking for references clarifying this point. "
55,Where am I resident for tax purposes?,I am a dual Australian / British citizen living in the United States on a G-4 spousal visa.  I am classed as a non-resident alien in the US so fill out a 1040NR and only pay tax on US based income.  So my question is: Where am I resident for tax purposes?  I left Australia 7 years ago on an L1A but changed to G4 a year later in March 2010  Am I in no man's land for tax residency? 
56,Healthcare in Portugal for Germans,"[Question was previously on Travel] I live in Germany, and applied for a job (in science) in Lisbon. My husband (German too), a programmer, would come too. He's insured by TK (the main state health insurance in Germany) and had chemo for a chronic Lymphoma about two years ago. Right now, he needs regular checkups and we just need to know that he would get good treatment, should he need it again.  So I have three related questions:  How is health insurance in Lisbon? Could we expect that he gets quality treatment and all the necessary checkups (blood tests, flow cytometry, ultrasounds)?  Would it suffice to get the Portuguese state health insurance, or would we need a private one? I know of some excellent cancer clinics (the Champalimaud centre) but I think it's only accessible through private insurance. I assume that private insurances would be too expensive with a pre-existing condition.  Is there a way that he can stay in the German system (we would be willing to pay for the time we're away) "

59,"Is a change from ""J-1 Short-Term Scholar"" to ""J-1 Research Scholar"" a ""Change of Status""?","My question is as above: Is a change from ""J-1 Short-Term Scholar"" to ""J-1 Research Scholar"", both with the primary purpose of ""Conducting Research"", a ""Change of Status""?  Form I-539 makes me think ""no"", because on page 2, part 2, 2.b (""The change of status I am requesting""), one can select only ""J1 - EXCHANGE VISITORS - OTHERS"". So there is no way to tell Short-Term Scholar apart from Research Scholar. [Ok, bad example: No change of category will be considered for Short-Term Scholars. But the question remains the same with similar J-1 types such as Professor.]  However, the Windstar tax software seems to think differently. Let's look at the case of a Short-Term Scholar (first half of the year) who became a Research Scholar (second half of the year):     Reestablishing Residency is required to start the benefits over after acquiring a new status/purpose! [explain]    Examining visit: J-1 CONDUCTING RESEARCH 7/1/2015 12/31/2015 [...]    Examining visit: J-1 CONDUCTING RESEARCH 1/1/2015 6/30/2015 [...]    Treaty Benefits end prior to this tax year. Treaty benefits denied.    So Windstar seems to think the Scholar has changed ""status"" or ""purpose"" (where the purpose is ""CONDUCTING RESEARCH"").  This article has a lot of information about this, see section D, ""Impact of Change in Status"". However, the article mostly talks about using different sections of the tax treaty (for students vs. professors, for example), which is not (necessarily) the case for a researcher changing from Short-Term to Research Scholar. What exactly a ""change of status"" is, remains unclear. Even footnote 157 says ""An explanation of this policy is not included in IRS Publication 901, U.S. Tax Treaties."" I do not have access to any of the other references in that footnote.  Edit: I have asked the Windstar people, too. I'll update this questions as soon as I hear back from them. "
60,Driver's license stolen... from a state I no longer have any connection to... how do I get a replacement?,"I am originally from Massachusetts but moved to Dallas, Texas for work several years ago. At that time, I switched my MA license to a TX license. Since then, I have moved to Asia. Two weeks ago, while traveling for work, my wallet - with my license - was stolen. I have two questions:    I cannot prove residency in Texas anymore since I don't live there... but my license should still be valid, it's just stolen. How do I get a replacement?  My MA license expired last year. The RMV website says I can renew a license up to four years after it expires. Can I still do this even though I switched license from MA to TX? I still have mail that goes to an address in MA as I have family there - I can use this a residency.    Thanks for your help! This is such a pain... I am an American and want a driver's license for when I go back (unfortunately this year I will not be going to Texas OR Massachusetts...) but without a permanent residency it is proving really difficult!!

62,Working from Ireland for a company in the Netherlands - Tax Bracket,So I work for a company in the Netherlands but I am working remotely from Ireland. I am currently being taxed 52% until I provide a BSN number. As far as I am aware to get this number I need to live in the Netherlands - so this is impossible for me.  Can someone tell me what can I do in this situation? Is there another way to get my tax bracket normalized to a fairer tariff? I cannot continue to work for less than half my wage. I asked my HR but I'm waiting for a reply and if I can speed up the process by getting some information that would be great. 
63,Leaving Australia on a foreign passport,"I have read everything I can find, but still don't have a definitive answer, so:  I am a dual citizen, USA and Australia. I am about to leave Australia, but just noticed my Australian passport is expired. Can I leave on my USA passport? I am not concerned about reentry, just the leaving part. If I ever want to go back (not planning on it now), I realize I will have to renew the Australian passport to do so.  I have read both ""should leave on Australian passport"" and ""must leave on Australian passport"", and the Australian High Commission in the UK says it is possible-  Q: I am an Australian citizen but as I did not obtain an Australian passport before departing Australia,""   ......  A: ""In the absence of an Australian passport, airlines are unable to assess a person's claim to Australian citizenship at the time of check-in and may decline to carry the traveller. It would  therefore be in your best interests to apply for an Australian passport to enable you to return to Australia.""  Does anybody have first-hand knowledge of what happens? Would I actually be denied the ability to return to my country? Would I just become a prisoner in Australia destined to live in the airport or at the US embassy?    I've read all the 'should-s' and 'must-s', but what actually happens if you do try to leave on your foreign passport? "
64,Tax treaty exemption for scholarship as a researcher: can I choose the tax treaty article?,"Some tax treaties, such as the one between the US and Germany, have different articles for professors/teachers/researchers and recipients of scholarships. In the aforementioned case, these are articles 20(1) and 20(3), with some mutual exclusions. In the 2006 version, these read:     Article 20 (Visiting Professors and Teachers; Students and Trainees)    1. Remuneration that a professor or teacher who is a resident of a Contracting State and who is temporarily present in the other Contracting State for the primary purpose of carrying out advanced study or research or for teaching at an accredited university or other recognized educational institution, or an institution engaged in research for the public benefit, receives for such work shall be taxable only in the first-mentioned Contracting State for a period not exceeding two years from the date of his arrival. This Article shall not apply to income from research if such research is undertaken not in the public interest but primarily for the private benefit of a specific person or persons. The benefits provided in this paragraph shall not be granted to an individual who, during the immediately preceding period, enjoyed the benefits of paragraph 2, 3, or 4.   [...]    3. Payment other than compensation for personal services that a person who is or was immediately before visiting a Contracting State a resident of the other Contracting State receives as a grant, allowance, or award from a non-profit religious, charitable, scientific, literary, or educational private organization or a comparable public institution shall not be taxed in the first-mentioned State.   So when receiving a scholarship as a professor, teacher or researcher, both articles may apply. Can one choose to claim an exemption under (1) even if (3) is applicable? If not, this would mean one could lose the possibility of claiming an exemption for future remuneration which is not a scholarship.  Follow-up question: can one choose not to claim tax-treaty benefits for some income (for example, said scholarship) in order to avoid losing later benefits for teacher remuneration? "

I got an offer and my Employer is filing H1-B for me ahead of my joining the company (also, I didn't get my joining date).  Now this is where things get complicated, since I didn't know my joining date, I didn't apply for OPT. And thus, my H1-B will be applied without my EAD card.   Question:   If my H1-B gets approved before I graduate (say I extended my graduation from May to August), then how is it going to impact my immigration status.

72,"Does a visa run in Taiwan really involve applying for a new visa every time, or just relying on visa-exempt passport entry?","Background: I've lived in Taiwan for 3 years now, always with an ARC (as I've always been employed by a Taiwanese company with the power to apply for an ARC for me up until now). I've applied for a 6th month ARC extension for ""seeking work"" since I quit my last job, but I won't be getting another job with a company that can apply for a visa for me, so I'm looking to start doing the whole ""leave the country every 3 months"" thing that I've heard so much about (I am from a visa-exempt country [I'm a US citizen], so from what I understand I can stay in the country for 90 days without an ARC.)  From other answers I've read (Taiwan maximum stay rules with reentry) it would seem that this isn't frowned upon and can be done rather regularly and quickly (in a one-day visa run to HK).  My questions are:  1) Do I have to actually go through a visa application process to do this, or is what I would really by doing just leaving the country and coming back, relying on my passport for 90 day visa-exempt entry?  2) Do I have to go to HK or can I go to any country, like Japan? Would China even count, since they don't like to admit Taiwan is a separate country? "

74,Mailing an envelope overseas with return postage,"This is a basic question about mail delivery which has been vexing me, and for which I can find no good answer. Before marking this off-topic please note that this is likely not a problem I would be having if I were not living overseas (in France, specifically, though the question is more general).  I need to send some documents back to the US from France in order to receive an apostille from the State of Louisiana.  Along with this I need to send a pre-paid envelope for return service.  What's troubling me is how I should go about this.  Can I just include an envelope with French postage on it?  Will the US mail service mail a parcel paid for with French postage?  And if so how does that work?  In the past when I've needed return service domestically I've just sent a pre-printed label via FedEx, but FedEx from France to the US is prohibitively expensive. I just don't know how to do this otherwise. "

Also as I understand it, I can apply as a dependant to travel to the UK with her.   My question is this: will I be allowed to work remotely for a US company receiving payment to a US only bank account while living in the UK as a dependant of a US exchange student? If not, then under what visa/immigration-policy would this be doable? "
77,Renewing J-1 and J-2 visas,"I'm a French citizen living in the USA, with my wife and our two children (who are French as well). I have a J1 Visa (Research Scholar) expiring the 30th of September 2016. My employer offered to renew my contract for one year. The other member of my family have a J2 visa with the same expiration date.  My ""responsible officer"" told me that he could extend my DS-2019 with proper dates, so that I would be fine as long as I'm not leaving the country. I guess this is what is meant by ""Reinstatement"" at the Adjustments and Extensions webpage.  I'm wondering if it would be reasonable not to renew my visa, and I'm asking myself a couple of questions which are not in the J1 faq:   Does a new visa voids the old one? What would be the dates range in which I could go renew my visa? For instance, would 3 months after (or before) the beginning of my new contract be too late (or too early)? Can I renew my visa without renewing the visa of my wife and my children? Can my wife renew her visa if I don't renew mine? Can I renew the visa of my children if I'm in France, but they didn't left the US? If we don't renew our visa, would that make more complicated to get new visas next year, for instance in 2018, in the case of another extension of my contract? Suppose an unplanned event makes us leave the country. How long would it take for us to make the appropriate arrangement so that we could take an appointment at Paris'US embassy?   I'm not subject to the Two-Year Home-Country rule. There are not a lot of questions directly related here, although this one (surprisingly) seems to suggest that there is a delay between the expiration of a J1 visa and getting another one. "
78,How does the medical system in British Columbia work for insured residents?,"Assuming a person moves to work in British Columbia and is insured by the local single payer healthcare system, how are they supposed to access general practitioners and specialist doctors?

79,Mid-to-long-term storage options in Israel,"Suppose I ship some personal belongings - say, 3-4 m^3 - by sea to Israel, but I don't yet have an apartment to ship them to.  Are there storage spaces I could rent at a reasonably low price, on a weekly or monthly basis, for a period of time which may be as long as several months - and to which I could have my stuff shipped?  If there are - do you have to have someone there to accept the shipped items, or can they just put them in storage for you?  Notes:    The shipped items will probably be palletized, and will not have odd dimensions. I don't mind the exact location of storage: Near one of the ports is fine, in Gush Dan or in Haifa is fine, any place that's accessible and not weird.  "
80,Can I keep my family in Germany and work in Finland on a work permit?,"I have a residence permit (not a blue card) of Germany until January 2018, and the Rathaus has given me a Fiktionsbescheinigung until May 2018, waiting for me to submit a new contract.  Now I have a new contract in Finland and I need to work there from February, but because of school, I will move my family only after July 2018. Is it possible to keep the family in Germany and work in Finland? Will the Rathaus allow keeping the family in Germany until then? "
81,"Living in Sweden while working in Norway, Norwegian government won't give me an S1 form","I'm a Norwegian citizen who lives in Sweden and commutes across the border to Norway for work. My wife is a Russian citizen who moved in with me in Sweden in November. We registered her as an EEA family member.  The Swedish authorities sent us a letter saying that she will not be covered by the Swedish health care system (since I work in Norway rather than Sweden) and that we need either a private insurance or an S1 form from Norwegian authorities.   The issue is not so much health care, we are both quite young and healthy, and we only intend to live in Sweden for a limited time. However, it looks like this issue needs to be resolved before she can even get legal residency in Sweden. That is the main matter.   This is a related to Working in Norway but living in Sweden. How and where will my wife get health care? in which the accepted answer informed me that I need to get an S1 form from Norway and fill in my wife's name under family members.   I contacted the Norwegian agency HELFO, and they said that I am not eligible to fill out an S1, as S1 is not used between the Nordic countries. However the letter from the Swedish authorities requests the S1. What should I do?  I'm attaching the letter from the Swedish authorities.     "
82,France: New visa application when you are already in the country with another visa,"I am an Indian citizen and having stayed in France for a long time (~7 years), holding a residence permit [Carte de Séjour - Salarié en Mission], which I obtained through the company that brought me to France on assignment. I have had the residence permit renewed multiple times since then, with the last renewal extending the validity until end of 2019. I would like to have some information on 2 points:   Is it possible to apply for a completely new visa while still in France, for a job contract with another French company? After some research on the net, I understand some of the key points to consider is that the new job offer is provided by a different company from the one that brought me to France, and that I hold a residence permit with Salarié en Mission, which is restricted to the company and work that I am currently assigned to. Similar to question asked in the link here (which was very helpful and clear btw, thank you @Gala), is there a timeframe to leave the country if I quit the company that brought me to France?   I did visit the Préfecture a few times to inquire about these questions, but was not able to get a concise answer, and unfortunately the reply seems to vary with each visit. Also, it seemed to me that the personnel always is confused in the case of Salarié en Mission residence permits. I was informed that a change of status is not possible and that I would have to return to my country to have any kind of change (new visa, etc).  There seems to be new rules, regulations and types of French visa and newer policies starting even this year, which make this more confusing for me.  Any information would be very helpful. "
83,Expatriate leaving France: Who should I notify (taxes/etc) that I'm moving out?,"I'm from Brazil and I was living in France from July 2016 until January 2018. I was working in the private sector with a titre de séjour, and now I just moved to Germany. So ideally everything needs to be done online or by letter (and French companies love letters, right? lol).  Who should I inform legally that I left the country? Taxes department (impôts)? How?  I already cancelled my cellphone, bank account and dealt with the landlord and gas/energy companies.  Thanks so much, hope someone can help me with that! "
84,Is it mandatory that I carry my work permit every time I re-enter Canada?,"I have an ETA-eligible passport and have recently obtained a work permit. Unlike most other visas it's an A4 document that is quite inconvenient to take with you on trips, since that's one more thing you can lose accidentally.    Is it mandatory that I take this document for re-entry to Canada? What happens if I don't? "
85,Spanish visa for non-EU unmarried partners,"I (dual NZL/UK citizen) am looking to move to Spain with my non-EU (NZL) spouse and I am finding some of the information out there a little unclear. I'm hoping that someone can check my understanding of the process and fill in the parts I don't understand.  I believe we should be able to travel to Spain without a Schengen visa as NZL is on the proper list.  Some information implies that there is a right to refuse entry without an onward ticket. Being that we will be driving/on the ferry is this likely to be an issue?  What I am unclear on is the requirement for a residence card and when this should be applied for. Am I correct in saying that we can apply for this once in Spain and once granted this will effectively grant residency beyond the original 90 days?  I am also unclear as to what documentation is required for unmarried partners. We have been in a long-term relationship and are engaged. However most of the sites I have seen suggest we need to supply a marriage certificate, which we don't have yet.  For her UK visa, we had to supply evidence of our relationship (essentially just letters to the same address). Is this sort of proof sufficient in Spain? If so, would every document need to be a certified translation even though the content is not relevant?  I'm hoping someone has been through this process before and can enlighten me. "
86,3-year UK Tier 2 extension on passport that will expire in a year,"I have a quick question. I hope someone can help. We are currently on a Tier 2 General visa (3 years), which expires in July 2018.  We will be applying for an extension closer to the time. The problem is that my kid's passport is already 3 years old and I am concerned that this will affect the time given on the visa extension, since kids passports are only valid for 5 years. We would ideally want to get another 3 years, which would give us enough time to apply for ILR.   Does anyone know if this will affect the application? Should I rather get new passports for the kids. Is there a faster way to get the passports, from a South African company? It looks like the wait time through SA House is 4 months.   Thanks in advance. "
87,"What is the cheapest EU passport that can be ""bought""?","Many (most? all?) countries allow non-citizens to effectively ""buy"" a passport, although they may not always phrase it that way. For instance, by agreeing to invest Euro X and start a business employing Y citizens, one can obtain citizenship in several countries.  What would be the cheapest way for a non-EU citizen to obtain an EU passport?  Some such schemes do not award citizenship, merely permanent residency. For the purposes of this question, let's say that that would be acceptable if it offered approximately equivalent rights to citizenship - say, health care, pension, Schengen travel rights, that sort of thing. It need not be inheritable.    Related question, but applies to UK Commonwealth &amp; the accepted answer was ""UK"", so not really helpful.    [website]"
88,Status on a carte de séjour application,"Who is responsible for the carte de séjour application processing? Is it the préfecture or some government department in France? I would like to check on my application. From all the googling I've done I can't see anywhere that you can check, so I just wanted to check, before I wait 2 hours at the préfecture. whether there is somewhere else I should be waiting instead, or another department to contact first. "
89,Am I allowed to quit without notice during my pregnancy in Germany?,"I have a job that needs a notice of ""3 Monate zum Quartalsende"" or 3 Months to the End of the Quarter. And since I am already pregnant that is a pretty long time to wait (a new quarter just started so it's legally almost 5 months from now if I quit asap from what I have read).  I sent a few applications and judging by the response so far it might be possible to find a new and better paying job. However, realistically I am pretty sure most places would want a new hire to start sooner than half a year (any later will be in my mandatory maternity leave period).  I heard there is a possibility of renegotiating the contract, but if my employers decide to be difficult, what kind of penalties (if any) can I face if I got a job offer and gave a more reasonable 1-month notice to my current employer instead and go my merry way?  I have read that a pregnant woman is not bound to the notice period in the contract, but I can't find so many places saying this since so many most information sources with proper legal citations are focused on the employer not being allowed to fire the pregnant worker aspect, and not the other way around.  Does anyone know what would be the case here?    Update: A mutual contract termination agreement (Aufhebungsvertrag) was necessary, however, was granted since it isn't in the old employer's interest to pay parental leave for an employee that plans to leave directly after.  New employer may not discriminate based on pregnancy and a pregnant applicant is not required to disclose at an interview. So an offer was accepted, and I successfully switched took leave and am back. "

So:   I need to fill I-539 form to change my status (from B2 to F1) and write a letter to explain why I need to change the status. What points do I need to write and make the USCIS believe that I just stay to study and will go back to my country after I finish my class?  As the I-20 shows May 7, 2018 as the course starting date, if my F1 change of status is still pending and my I-94 expires, I need to fill another form to extend my B2 status (the second I-539 form). Do I need to fill and apply at the same time with the status change form?   After I fill the extension status form (the second I-539 form), will I get another 6 months to wait for my change of status (F1)? And when will these 6 months start?     Kindly give me some advice. Thank you so much !  "
91,What obligations are incurred by registering as a German resident?,"I'm a Norwegian citizen, and am considering spending extended periods of time in Germany, potentially to the point of being a resident for some or all of a tax year. I currently live outside the EEA in a country with a tax treaty with Germany.  I understand the need to register as a resident should I spend significant amounts of time there.

95,Portuguese (Austria resident) to register relationship with a Philippine,"Me and my boyfriend want to live together and settle down. I'm from the Philippines and currently working in Dubai and my boyfriend is Portuguese and working in Austria. The plan is for me to move to Austria.  I've a degree and several years of working experience in my field of studies.  My profession is listed in the Shortage Occupations list but it requires me to speak German which I don't and it will take me some time. I can't get a job seeker visa by just a few points (less than 10points) so I am only left with a tourist visa which is not enough for our plans.  Our plan is to register our relationship (this is marrying, correct?) and then request family reunion visa and I move to Austria. Because my boyfriend is not Austrian, requesting the family reunion visa does not requires me to speak German (A1 level at least), am I right?  To marry in the Philippines my boyfriend's documents have to be attested by his country embassy in the Philippines [source, source] but Portugal's embassy responsible for the Philippines is in Indonesia. This would force him to go to Indonesia to take care of all the paper work and then go to the Philippines.  It is possible for him to deal with all relationship registration's paper work with the embassy in Austria or his home country before traveling to the Philippines for the formal process?  Which process is easier to do?   Register our relationship in Austria. Register our relationship in Portugal. Register our relationship in the Philippines. Register our relationship in Abu Dhabi at the Portuguese/Philippine embassy Other, which one?   Another alternative I was told about is for my boyfriend to sponsor me to go to Austria, how does this exactly works and is it possible for our case? He has accommodation and a job.  Are we forgetting another alternative that we should take in consideration? "
96,Language restrictions in France?,"I'm going to pursue a Master's course in France starting in September 2018.

The master's course has French as a subject for non-French students that I'm already enrolled in. My question (s) is (are):   Will not knowing French affect my Visa process? Is French mandatory for the Visa application? My course is entirely in English. My English, written and spoken, is good (TOEFL == 106, if that's any measure). Will it be so that it will be difficult to communicate? PS: I'm from India.  "

It is now a requirement to get insurance coverage for the period I'm there.   I will get insurance from my employer once I have a contract and am in South Africa (for the whole period). I tried to negotiate it with the Embassy, but they still require something now (i.e. before contract).   I currently am looking for some extremely basic insurance (that doesn't have to cover anything) to attach to my visa application. Once am in South Africa I will get proper insurance.  Does anyone know how to best approach such a problem? Are there any websites where I could get something like that? It can be from non-EU country. It would be good if it is in English (to avoid translation costs) and if I could pay for it with PayPal. "

I assume there are Chinese people who do acquire another citizenship anyway.  Is there actually a ban on acquiring another citizenship, or does ""not recognize dual citizenship"" simply mean that China is going to ignore the other one, e.g. the person couldn't get consular protection from the other country while in China?  This question is more out of curiosity than anything else. "

Specifically, if my company moves me from the US to the UK for an assignment, I will want a sterling-denominated credit card and perhaps even to buy property. I would have a temporary address and proof of employment and income, and with that would be able to open an account with a UK bank.  But what next?  I am advised to register for the electoral roll, but this does not apply to me as an American citizen. Next, I am advised to apply for credit I am likely to obtain, but none of those relocation guides I've seen actually describe what credit that might be— credit card? Line of credit?

If I find an opportunity to work there as contractor (freelancer), can I simply register my company there? Or there are special requirements to be met? How do I apply for VISA in that case?  As far as I know, USA grants VISA to computer specialists without any problem, because they are needed there, if they want to be employed there. Do the same applies to contractors? "
121,How do countries access criminal information from foreign citizens?,"One of the requirements that most (all?) countries have for issuing a work permit is that the applicant does not have a criminal record. On the other hand, I suppose nations do not open the criminal records of their citizens to other countries, in the interest of national sovereignty and security.  So, excluding international criminal databases (Interpol, for example) and shared intelligence information between allied agencies (such as terrorist activities and suspects), how do countries get access to criminal information from foreign citizens?  "
122,Does a Swedish personal number expire?,"I'm a Dutch citizen who has previously lived in Sweden for six years, but I have since moved on.  The Swedish version of what is called social security number, social insurance number, government service number, or otherwise, is the personnummer.  I got a personnummer assigned shortly after arriving and registering in the country.  Does this personnummer remain valid for the rest of my life, or is there some expiry?  I know that my Canadian social insurance number will expire.  What about my Swedish one? "
123,Is there a difference between an expatriate and an immigrant?,"Are the words expatriate and immigrant synonymous to each other? If not, where lies the distinction between the two?  "
124,Can I retain my South African and Polish citizenship when I gain British citizenship?,"I am South African and Polish national with current passports in both countries. Neither one has any reservations about this fact and is pretty common with many countries.  I do not live in either of those countries. I currently live in England and I am thinking about taking ""the test"" to become a British Citizen.  I am not sure but I tried to skim on-line documents, and it seems like I will be able to keep my other 2 passports and gain this third, British one.  Is this possible? Or is is something that might cause me complications or are there some benefits in this?  "
125,How long can I drive with an EU registered/insured car in Brazil?,"There is a ""ferry"" between Antwerp and Rio. This implies that it is okay to drive in Brazil with a EU registered car. Does this also apply if I am working for 6 months in Brazil? Can I simply bring my own car and drive around? "
126,"Where do you pay taxes, if you are doing work in international waters?","So you are traveling around the world in your through satellite connected sailing yacht. To finance your trip you blog and develop websites. Where is this work taxed? Is it tax free, or am I obliged to pay taxes in the country where my yacht is registered? "
127,What is a credit history and why should I care?,I just read a question on having credit history in the UK. The credit-history phenomenon has puzzled me for some time. Similar to people considering it a good thing to have many credit cards.   What is the relevance of a credit-history? Except for a mortgage and 2 credit cards I never had any substantial outstanding loans. What does this tell me about my credit history and should I care if I relocate to the UK or the US? 
128,Are H4 visa holders allowed to do remote intellectual work?,"I know that immigrants to the United States holding a H4 visa are not allowed to work. But there is a grey area that I could never find a satisfactory answer to: what if a H4 holder works remotely, doing a purely intellectual work (let's say,  translation or software development) as a contractor for their home country? In this case, the American economy is never touched and the worker does not have any employee relationship with their clients. Does that qualify as ""work"" for the US government? "
129,What happens if changing country I don't unregister from the first country health insurance system?,"Refer to what this user is saying here:     Remember that no matter what, if you stop working in country X and start working in country Y (both in EU), you have to unregister from health insurance in X and register in Y.   What are the consequences if I don't inform my old country (Italy) that I've moved to another country (Austria) for work? "
130,What are the monetary advantages to registering with Mexican Social Security?,"I'm a US Citizen, working for a US company which pays 100% of my health insurance costs with a US company.  I'm living in Mexico, which has ""Social Security"", which offers access to the government hospitals.  Aside from avoiding the hassle of sending medical bills to my US-based insurance provider (which covers ""normal and customary"" expenses, even outside of the US), is there any advantage to becoming registered with Mexican Social Security?  In the case of an emergency, such as a car accident, would I receive better or different care if I was a member of the Mexican Social Security system? "
131,How do degrees work in Ukraine?,How many years are needed for obtaining a degree in Ukraine? Are there bachelor's degree (3-4 years) and master's degrees (2 years) if you want to continue? 
132,Transportation in San Francisco,I expect to live in San Francisco but I have no clue if a car is necessary or if I can rely on public transportation system if there is any.  I plan to move in the city and in the Valley on a daily commuting basis. I would also like to explore the area beyond the boundaries of the city (I heard the north of the bay is nice). Are all these things possible with public transit system (no matter its cost or time)? Or is a car strictly necessary? 
133,Freelancing in Canada without work permit,"I am a EU citizen and I expect to visit Canada for an extended period (I am allowed to stay up to 6 months without a work permit).  As this is a rather long period, I would like to do some freelancing to finance it. Am I allowed to do so, declaring my income either in Canada (I honestly doubt of that) or in EU.  Does Canada allow this situation? what about France (as the EU country)? "
134,Adjusting to a humid tropical climate,"I recently migrated from USA to Darwin, Australia. The weather went from living in a primarily cold place to a city which is extremely humid. Looks like the blood thinning may take over a year for my body to get really adjusted to the tropical weather. In the meanwhile, without wanting expert medical advice,    How can I get adjusted to the new climate ?  What can one do to adjust to a humid weather coming from a cold country ?  The obvious answer seems to drink a lot of water but heavy sweating also means I am loosing essential electrolytes and salts. How to know what local people do to cool their bodies off ?   "
135,What documents are actually required to obtain a HKG permanent residence ID?,"The Hong Kong Government lists the following requirements for foreign residents that want to get a permanent HKG ID:        Proof of 7 years continuous ordinary residence in Hong Kong immediately before the date of the application for permanent resident status, such as school documents, employment proof, official receipts, bank statements or income tax receipts   Travel document showing entry to Hong Kong and your current condition of stay in the HKSAR      Assuming that I do not have the travel documents and bank statements anymore, how important are these and how important are those? Can someone with experience of not having full documentation of their stay in Hong Kong confirm what the minimum requirements are? "
136,Which EU territories outside Europe does an EU citizen have right of residence in?,"Several EU countries such as the UK, France and Netherlands have territories and dependencies outside of Europe.  Examples include many islands in the Caribbean, Falkland Islands, Tahiti, and so on.  These have a complex relationship with the home country (usually a former colonial power), and with the European Union.  Some are inside the EU for some purposes, some are not.  Who can live and/or work in the territory is complex, even for citizens of the home country.  Given this, which territories of EU countries, outside Europe, are somewhere that any EU citizen could move to, to live and work, under the EU freedom of movement?  For example, Aruba is one of the four countries in the Kingdom of the Netherlands. Does that make it part of the EU for residence?  Are any of the French DOMs and TOMs, like French Polynesia, areas that EU citizens have the right to settle in?  Are any of the overseas UK territories, such as Anguilla, part of the EU for residence? "
137,What are the options for registering address in Austria?,"My friend has a problem in Austria. Because of construction works he needs to leave his appartment as soon as possible.  My question is, what are his options? He is looking for something cheap (up to 300 euros), because he stays there only few days a month.  Is it possible to register an address at some kind of hotel/pension/motel? I researched this, but couldn't find anything conclusive. "
138,EEA Registration Certificate to Resident permit to UK Citizenship,"I'm slightly confused about what documents do I need to apply for. I already have a EEA Registration Certificate and now I'm trying to apply for British Citizenship.  It say that I must have a resident permit to do so.  Now, to apply for a resident permit card the application form is almost identical to the one I have filled in when applied for my Registration Certificate and paid £65. Do I have to submit the very same thing all over again and pay the £65 again to be able to get a resident permit card?   Home Office already has got all my details, why would I have to submit everything again? "
139,Does J1 visa need to be valid to apply for J2 visa?,"I am a J1 visa holder; this expires by the end of November, 2018. I have the new DS2019 extended for more one year (i.e. up to 30 Nov, 2019). Since I am planning to go to India in January 2019, I was applying for a visa again, but recently got to know that I am eligible for a visa interview waiver. Now the problem is that I and my wife (new J2 dependent visa applicant) were going to take the appointment together.  My questions are the following:   Is it possible for me not to opt of the Dropbox facility option (visa interview waiver) and instead attend the interview with her? If I use the Dropbox facility, I know that it will take some time to get the new visa stamp. In the meantime, can my wife go for the interview? Because at that time I will not have a valid visa either and I will be outside of the USA.  "

When I receive the invitation, would it be possible for me to transfer account from my mother's account to mine and show that as proof of funds? will they consider that as parking money? If not, if I have a joint fixed deposit with my mom for the required money, will that help? Any advice would be much appreciated. "
142,Can I use a 401k/IRA as proof of funds for a non-lucrative visa application in Spain?,"My family and I are moving to Spain for a year this summer. I am still working things out with my employer to see if I can work remotely (I'm a programmer, and it shouldn't be a problem), but I may not know for certain before our visa interview in March. We also plan to sell our house, but most likely won't close before the interview.   So we know that we will have enough money as long as our house sells OR if my company allows me to work remotely, but I'm not sure that we'll be able to prove either of those things by March. My understanding is that we would need either a letter from my employer or sufficient savings in a bank account. We have a healthy savings account, but not the full amount to cover a year (which Spain's application indicates would be around $50,000). We have plenty of funds in retirement accounts (401ks and IRAs). Can we use that money as proof of financial viability? Or does anyone have other ideas about how to prove we will be financially independent?   Thanks for your help! "
143,British national living in Germany for 28 years - what happens after Brexit?,"I am a British national who worked for a company for 2 years in the UK before moving to Germany. After marrying and bringing up children, in 2009 I started my present job. I have had an unlimited ""Aufenthaltserlaubnis"" (German stay permit) since the year 2000.  Now due to Brexit I am unsure about my future here. Can anyone tell me whether after Brexit I can continue to work in Germany as before, with this Aufenthaltserlaubnis? And will I be able to claim my pension for the two years I worked in the UK? Or will I need to apply for some other kind of permit?  I am also unsure about the status of my 23 year old who is working here, but does not have any kind of permit. "
144,Traveling to the US on a B1/B2 visa with consular green card processing pending,"My spouse is submitting form I-130 to USCIS on my behalf in the coming weeks. Since we're living in Brazil, we will go through consular processing in Rio de Janeiro after NVS gets back to us, probably a year from now.  I'm a PhD student and my wife is not employed. Next June, we would like to travel to the US for my wife's sister wedding on my tourist visa.   I understand there is a higher burden on me to prove I do not intend to stay on that trip - and I'm thinking (a) PhD enrollment, (b) child's current school enrollment, (c) maybe our lease and bank statements might be enough to show no intention of not leaving the country.  As of now, we have a good history of traveling to the US, and having never overstayed nor have a visa denied.  Is my assessment realistic? And more importantly, what are the risks to my green card application if I'm turned away at the border?  "
145,How to correct a mistake made on EEA FP already submitted application,"I made a mistake on the application form. I forgot to write my husband's National Insurance number which he has never used to work in the UK. He only applied for it earlier this year. I have already submitted the form, signed the declaration page and printed out the application form.   Please what shall I do? Should I leave it as it is or correct it with an ink?  I have my biometric tomorrow? Please I need advise? "
146,What is the best time-interval to send follow-up email to a prospective employer in UK?,"I have been offered a job in UK by a company which is in the process of acquiring a sponsorship license right now. So I would be able to get a tier 2 visa and work there.  I understand that the process could be time-consuming. I have followed them up once in two weeks for the past two months.  Is it a good idea to ask for an update every two weeks?  I do not want to look pushy or ignoring as well. So the question is : what time-interval would be normal to send follow up email in this situation?  Extra information that might help :    It’s a software development job but I am not sure if it is on the “UK Shortage list of occupations”. However the job is about a rare and special programming skill, hence, both employees and employers are limited in numbers in the world.Yet, the job title does not have “senior” in it neither it is a computer graphics or game programming. As far as I concern, I and the employer are both interested and determined to make this co-operation happen. I have passed the interview on late Sep. I have 80 points in UK Gov. score based system assuming that I am not in the shortage list.  "
147,I am a dual citizen of Canada and US looking to marry a Canadian Citizen,"If I marry a Canadian Citizen, will it make any difference at all to my US Citizenship and Residency?  Will it make any difference at all to staying in and leaving Canada?  Will it make any difference at all to staying in and leaving the United States? "
148,Do I get an EU Blue Card from Germany if my degree is not listed in ANABIN and my university is listed H+,"I've just got a visa of type D for Germany to work for a big company in Berlin. The relocation company that assisting me told me that     Kindly note that is has not been issued on the legal basis of a blue card. However, after your arrival in Germany and the registration at the local town hall, we will contact the immigration office if they are willing to change the legal basis to a blue card. However the current visa and legal basis allows you to reside and work in Germany without any restrictions.   Because the Embassy is saying that my degree is not recognized.  My university is ranked #1 in Jordan and it is listed in the ANABIN website as H+ but the degree which is Computer Science (4 years Bachelor degree) is not listed under it and listed just under other universities that are much less popular than it.  Does it mean that I am not going to get a Blue Card ? Is there anything to do ? "
149,Obtaining a European visa as a foreigner in the USA,"First, let me explain my background. I came to the USA on a tourist visa 18 years ago from South Korea and have never been out since. Thus my USA visa has long since expired, but I changed my status to F-1 (note the subtle difference between F-1 'status' holder and F-1 'visa' holder. I did not have an F-1 visa). However, I have recently received a green card.  I am now into my fifth year of Ph.D. and will apply for postdoctoral academic job positions.  Here are some questions:  1) If I travel outside the US, now re-entry to the US would not be a problem since I have obtained a green card? I won't travel to Korea, since I did not serve in Korea's mandatory military service; therefore, they probably won't let me leave again (especially since I have left the country with a tourist visa and never returned). However, I would like to know if I can travel to places like Europe.  2) I would like to have options to apply to some jobs in Europe. However, for the reason I explained above, I am unable to get a visa directly from South Korea. Is it possible for me to get a European visa (as a Korean and a US permanent resident) in any other means? Maybe I can enter a European country, and change my 'status' there to some valid legal status without obtaining a visa? (Just as I did in the US with F-1 status)  EDIT - I do have a valid South Korean passport, which expires in about 8 years or so. "
150,Theoretically elligible for settled status. Does that make newborn daughter British?,"I am an Eu citizen living and working in the uK. I believe I am eligible for settled status: I was living for 6 years in the UK until 2013 exercising treaty rights. Between 2013 and 2016 I have been coming and going, never being longer than 2 years abroad at a time. Since 2016 I have lived and worked in the UK.  I am in the process of applying to the UK government's EU Settled Status pilot programme. I believe I will eventually be granted settled status. I had a daughter 4 weeks ago (before the pilot programme opened for me).  My question is: if I am granted settled status, does it date back to 2013 and hence makes my daughter a British citizen? Or does it only count since the time of application? As you can imagine the answer is pretty critical to her. "
151,Change job with EU Blue Card in Germany,"I started my Employment on February 2017, with EU Blue Card in Germany. I want to switch jobs without re-authorization from the German Authorities.  Can I do it now? (As it's been more than 18 months.) Or should I wait for it to be 2 years? (On February 2019) "
152,EU national living in the UK moving to Berlin with a new job,"I am an EU national (Italian passport) who has been living and working in the UK since 2006 and I recently got a job offer that I intend to accept for a new role in Berlin (I have no German and will start a course very soon). I will be starting Mid-March and the offer itself includes a nice relocation package (~6K) and I have just started to research what I would need to do to confidently start my new role (it is the 1st of December now and I am on a 3 month notice period with some room for negotiation in terms of length). Considering the relocation budget offered by the company, would you simply use a relocation services agency? From what I gather, this is what I will need to do (essential steps):   Register my address in Germany, for which I will need the following:   your passport or ID card; a copy of the lease or rental agreement for your accommodation  a completed registration form (Anmeldeformular) countersigned by  the landlord The above, of course, implies that I have already found and signed a rental agreement (that is why I wondered whether a relocation agency can help while still working my notice). Then, again this is from my very initial research, I will need to apply for my health insurance and after a 2 weeks or so I shall receive an email with my social security number. My understanding is that the social security number (NI in UK terms) and health insurance are essential for my new employer to pay me? I am also researching about opening a bank account (I am currently with HSBC) and I am considering N26. Has any of use open an international account with HSBC?    Any help will be much appreciated in terms of steps to take and how to approach them within the allowed time.   Thank you so much  Regards "
153,Mother refuses to allow child to become US citizen,"I am the father of a nearly 2-year old daughter.  I was present for her birth in the Philippines.  I am a US citizen by birth and lived most of my life in the US.  I acknowledged paternity and the child uses my surname. My understanding of US regulations is that citizenship requires the mother's signature and approval.  The mother (and her family) refuse to allow my daughter to become a US citizen unless I agree to large cash payments for the next 19 years.   I have an attorney in the Philippines that was successful in getting a visitation order.  I have provided full support starting with prenatal care.   Have I missed something in reviewing the US regulations?  Is there a way to get my child her US citizenship without the mother's consent?  I think a passport and citizenship are usually acquired in the same transaction, is it possible to at least get her citizenship without the mother's consent? "

155,UK visa for non-EEA child of British mother,"My wife and I are living in Brazil and intend to immigrate to the UK. We are trying to figure out what is the best way to obtain a visa for our child so she can move with the family.  My wife is a British citizen (by descent - she was not born in the UK) and I have an EU passport. My wife's daughter (my stepdaughter) is seven years old and a national of Brazil, born prior to my wife acquiring citizenship. My wife has not lived in the UK for three years prior to acquiring citizenship, therefore the child cannot be registered as a British citizen. My wife has sole responsibility over the child.  I will start a job in the UK in January and have a signed contract for full-time employment with a company in London.   My wife's finances in Brazil do not meet the minimum financial requirement for a child visa. My finances in Brazil are plenty sufficient to meet this requirement. My salary in the UK will also be plenty sufficient.   What are the requirements for the child to enter and live with us in the UK? What is the correct type of visa? What are the supporting documents? Do we need to meet the financial requirements and if so can my own income as a stepfather be considered?  Finally, can the child enter with a visitor visa and apply in the UK?  Please note that I have read through the HO documentation multiple times, even started an application for a child of a settled person but it is all very confusing.  Thank you in advance for any assistance. "
156,I am a Swiss national and want to move to Italy with my Indian husband. What is the process for him acquiring residency?,"We both live in India at the moment and wedding was in India as well. We want him to come on a tourist visa, not a family reunion visa as that takes a long time. Does it matter from which country the Shengen visa is (like is it a problem if we apply for his visa with the swiss embassy instead of the italian one?) What exactly is the process for him to acquire residency once in Italy and how long does it take  - assuming I have Italian residency by then? Once he applies for residency and has a temporary carta di soggiorno (how long would that take?) can he start working and studying etc?   Im super thankful for any help! "
157,UK tier 2 extension processing time?,Anyone know how long it takes to receive an extension to a Tier 2 general visa? This was submitted from within the UK.  They say it could be 8 weeks from your biometric appointment. But does it usually take that long? 
158,"Does changing the residence permit, to Blue Card would help me for migration to Germany?","I got my MSc. Software engineering in Estonia. When i graduated, i received a new residence permit for 5 years (which is not a Blue Card). Generally, I received my residence permit because, I got a degree in an Estonian University.  Now, I wish to move to Germany. But, from time to time HRs contact me in Linkdin, and Xing, and it seems that, some companies are not willing to hire someone who does not have a Blue Card.   I asked the police about changing the type of my residence permit to Blue Card, and they warned me in case i get a Blue Card, i should change my card whenever i change my company.  My questions are:   Why lack of Blue card is an obstacle for hiring process?   I mean, as long as, I have a valid contract, I might be able to apply for a new Blue Card, and it should not take more than a month or so. So, why the companies are so scared of this problem?   Do you think, changing the residence permit, to Blue Card would help me for migration?   I mean, even if i have a Blue Card for my current company in Estonia, when i join a new company in Germany then i have to change the card again. Does that mean, having a Blue card is not helpful? Or does not make a big difference? "
159,EEA family permit form - how to answer when/where did you first meet if we met online?,On the EEA family permit form it asks:     When did you first meet X?   Where did you first meet X?

160,An Upcoming Situation,"At the moment I have a German Blue Card after finishing my Msc in Germany, valid till the expiry date of my Passport (05.2021), the problem is that after the expiry of my passport I will not be able to renew it before my 30s birthday in 09.2021 cuz the embassy will not renew it for me before I reach 30 and get the final exemption from the military service. Meaning that there will be a gap of approx 4 months for me without a national passport. What can I do in these 4 months to be able to live and work legally in Germany? Will the Auslanderbehorde just give me a notification of deportation or they will cooperate and maybe issue me something temporary till I sort out my a new passport?   I do not care about my ability to travel in these months but I just want to keep my job and live and work legally.  Any help or maybe guidance for what can be done? "
161,Do I need a visa to work in Romania if I have a Bulgarian residence/work permit?,"Does a non-EU citizen (Turkish) with a Bulgarian residence-work permit need another visa to work in Romania?

Thank you! "
163,"EU Applying for Irish Citizenship, parent never had Foreign Birth Registration certification","I'm applying for my Irish Citizenship form the UK so that I can live and work there.  I believe I qualify for Irish citizenship because of the following:   a) I was born outside of Ireland before the 31st of December 2004 and after 1986.  b) I have Irish born Great-Grandparents. c) My Father is adamant he completed his Foreign Birth Registration (FBR) before I was born.   While going through the process I realised my Father does not have an FBR certificate, so I go to apply for a replacement, the form for which asks how the original FBR certificate was lost/destroyed/stolen.  I can't complete the form for a replacement because my father claims he never had one,  and looking online I can't find any indication that he would not have received one when he registered.  So is it possible to complete a Foreign Born Registration without getting a certificate? And how would we go about getting one now?  Or does this mean my Father never registered and is in fact misremembering? "
164,Can F2 visa holder apply to get a licence as a physical therapist in USA?,"I have an F2 visa. I hold a Physical therapy (PT) bachelor from the outside USA. I contacted Tennesse board of Physical therapy to apply for a licence for PT.

165,How can I rent my first home in Ireland?,"I'm an EU citizen, so as far as I know I can relocate and apply for job in Ireland without needing a permit.  I have read a few places that in order to rent a home in Ireland, you need a reference from the previous landlord, a reference from the employer, and bank details to prove I can pay.  Since it will be my first home in a foreign country, I cannot get a reference from a previous landlord.   Regarding the employment, I would like to have a home first and establish a proof of address, before looking for a job if possible. So I cannot assume I have job by time I'm looking for apartment.  Regarding the money I have enough money to live for a year (or maybe two) based on the cost of living information I found on web (even if I'm a bit pessimistic). How can I prove I can pay? Is it enough if I can login to my online brokerage accounts or netbanks to show the money I have there? Or do I need something more official? Or is it required to have the money in the Irish bank?  "

The TB test gov link states the following:     You will not need a TB test if any of the following apply:         you’re a diplomat accredited to the UK    you’re a returning UK resident and have not been away for more than 2 years    you lived for at least 6    months in a country where TB screening is not required by the UK, and    you’ve been away from that country   for no more than 6 months      Does she fall under the second point as she was born in UK and has not been away fro more than 2 year??

168,What are the minimum cell phone specs needed to work in UK?,"I am planning on buying a cell phone soon in the US. Preferably, I would want a phone that has dual SIM card slots and quad frequency capability (850/900/1,800/1,900 MHz). Is this all I need hardware-wise for a phone to work in the UK (and possibly Europe in general)?   Other than that, I would need the appropriate phone plan. Are there more requirements I need? Such as: do the WiFi bands in the US work with WiFi in the UK (that phones use, laptops, etc.)? "

171,Professional Apprenticeship as Work Experience for Express Entry,"While filling up the work experience section of the express entry profile I came across this sentence,     Do not enter any work related to or performed during an apprenticeship   process.   I know for sure this includes the apprenticeship done while being a student, but I cannot understand if it also refers to the professional paid apprenticeships or not.  I have ~2.5 years of professional experience in Italy (out of which 2 years are full-time), on a work permit and paid. However, my work contract has a title like: Professional Apprenticeship (it's an Italian kind of contract). How can I determine if this work experience is eligible to be counted or not? "

But I have received my carte de séjour recently and it doesn't expire until 2020. Does that mean I can continue to live and work in France using my carte de séjour once my original seasonal visa has expired?

But does that mean six months starting in January or starting of the original visa? Or start of the carte de séjour? Also can I stay in France during the time I'm not working using the carte de séjour?  "

I got all the information I need from [website]I read around that it can vary from 3 to 18 months but it's quite difficult to make plans with such a flexible timescale.   What is the current average total time since the US fiance' submits the I-129F form until the beneficiary can enter the US with the issued K1? Is it true that when the K1 is delivered to the beneficiary the latter has 6 months to enter the US plus max 3 months to get married once entered in the US?

182,UK Transfer of Residence form - pet section,"I'm moving to the UK in a couple weeks.  My family (including my dog) aren't coming for another couple months.  We're having our stuff shipped out 2 weeks before my family flies.  Filling out the ToR, the pet section asks if we're bringing a pet (we are).  It asks for the pet's ""Pet Passport and Identification Details"".  The UK doesn't accept Pet Passports from the US so we're not getting one.  We are going to get an EU Health Certificate but the pet has to travel within 10 days of getting the Certificate so we don't have one yet.  I don't know if we can wait until we have that info to fill out the form since our stuff is being shipped before the dog flies out.  Should I wait as long as I can?

I have the EEA Family Permit visa for 6 months and it expires in June. I want to ask for the Residence Card in May, but the problem is that exists the possibility that I have to travel outside UK in June and/or August.

Also, I read that I can ask for my passport back, but the problem is that I have to resend it and the process would take more time (sometimes another 6 months).  I am not sure if that possibility I described before, is the same as this passport return option explained in the following link: [website]Has anyone done this before?  Do you know if there is any possibility to keep your passport meanwhile I am waiting for the UK EEAFM Residence Card?  When is the best time to ask for the Residence Card? "

Hope this time I get some help regarding my queries. "
193,Can my german employer rollback my promotion?,"I am currently working in the IT industry holding a blue card and after one and a half year, I received a promotion, which also included a salary raise.   I got to know about this promotion via e-mail in January.  January and February paychecks reflected already the new salary base, however, in March they decided I would need to sign an appendix to my contract in order to validate my promotion.   I did not accept the new job description, as they were mandating me to perform tasks way outside my scope of work.   In the March paycheck, I saw they rolled back my salary retroactively. Hence, I received a very low income, as both January and February gains were discounted in the March paycheck.  I am wondering is this is valid or against the laws? Also, did anyone already face a similar situation?  "
194,Does it make sense for foreign research assistants (HiWis) in German universities to voluntarily contribute to Rentenversicherung (pension scheme)?,"I am about to sign a contract with the university that I'm currently studying in as a research assistant (HiWi). It seems that since the hours and salaries are below a legal standard, I am not required to make compulsory contribution to Rentenversicherung. The secretary asked me whether I want make a 3.9% voluntary contribution to the Rentenversicherung. She explained to me that this would add certain ""points"" to my Rentenversicherung account, which would be relevant to the amount of money I get after retirement, if I still remain in the German Rentenversicherung system by that time, of course.  However, she said it might not make that much sense since the current salary is low and the points contributed would be minimum. In the end, she asked me to come back next week with my decision, after I've done more research on the topic.  The actual contribution might seem indeed minimum, since I only get several hundred Euros of payment each month anyways. However, AFAIK, in the legal documents that I've read about German residence and nationality, contribution to the pension scheme is regarded as an important/mandatory factor to consider regarding one's permanent residency or naturalization application. For example, in section 18b, item 3 of Residence Act, it is stated that:     he or she has paid compulsory or voluntary contributions into the statutory pension scheme for at least 24 months or furnishes evidence of an entitlement to comparable benefits from an insurance or pension scheme or from an insurance company   I'm currently keeping permanent residency as a viable future option to consider after my graduation. In this case, would paying voluntary contribution to the pension scheme count towards these 24 months, and potentially help my future applications in these aspects? Or, is it the case that since the amount is too little and that I'm still a student, it would be of no use? I'm quite confused at the moment. "

My daughter is Argentine and my wife is Chilean with Argentine residency.  It takes a lot of time (probably more than a year) to do it in Argentina.

196,UK visa IHS payment,"I'm traveling to the UK from the US to work.  I already have my visa.  I'm filling out visa applications for my kids.  During the visa application process you have to prepay the Immigration Health Surcharge.  The IHS payment is based on how long your visa is.  I had a massive brain fart and instead of entering when my visa expires (2020) I entered when my visa entry expires (next week).  So the site charged me nothing for my kids' IHS.  The UK visa site will not let you go back and fix this.  I've already paid for the visa applications and set up their biometric collection appointments.  Is this going to negatively affect their visa applications?  Is there a way to fix this short of canceling the applications, requesting a refund, and redoing them from scratch?  Can I pay via this site once they get to the UK? "
197,Switching Job and Travel on B1/B2 while waiting for H1B lottery results,"Good afternoon and best wishes to all who help in this forum :)  Here is my situation:   I currently work for Company AAA in my home country. I was interviewed by Company BBB last February 2017, signed a contract with them, and they have sponsored my H1B visa 2018 application. I believe the H1B lottery has taken place last April 11, 2017 but results are yet to start coming out (being on the regular pool I expect that news if I got selected come until mid-June? And if selected it takes another 2 months to know if my case is approved - so wait until August?) Now in my home a local Company CCC  has a great job offer for me. And for the purpose of sharpening my skills I want to temporarily join this Company CCC.   My plan is: If my H1B is not selected and approved then I will stay for good at Company CCC. If otherwise, of course I go with H1B with Company BBB and  will resign at Company CCC.   I have B1/B2 multiple entry Visa. Now if I join Company CCC, it is very possible that they will ask me to go to the US for 3 months on B1 (Business) Visa. Possible timeline will be early June until late August 2017.   I might be asked by Company CCC to travel to the US from June- August on B1/B2 Visa. Given this, below are my questions:   If Company CCC will ask me to travel to the US on B1/B2 Visa, assuming I got selected in the lottery. Will it affect my H1B application? Given it is already April 29, 2017, and I am still awaiting for H1B lottery results. If I join Company CCC, will it have any effect on my H1B in case I get selected? Will the interviewer at the US consular office ask why I had a short stay at Company CCC? If my H1B case is selected and approved, can I only take the H1B Visa interview in my home country? May I also request to take it while in the US assignment for CCC (assuming I am already being required by Company BBB)?   Thank you in advance. "

205,How to activate electronic signature of German 'Personalausweis' (while abroad),"I am living in the US but am a German citizen.  Some years ago, I got a new 'Personalausweis' (German citizen ID card), with the new 'electronic signature function' (I chose 'yes' when asked).  However, it seems  that this was not enough - when trying to use it, it needs some 'activation'. All sources I could find tell me to go to the local authorities and 'get it activated' - but I live in the US and don't want to fly over the Atlantic just for that; especially as the potential success and usefulness is unclear.  How can I get this function 'activated'? I have a card reader in my laptop, and it does recognize my 'Personalausweis'. But I cannot get any further. What can I do?  One of the things I would like to use it for is reviewing my social security/pension history and details at the corresponding government authority ('Rentenversicherungsanstalt'). That seems to need this function... "

Does this mean that, in order to completely the 5-year residence period necessary to settle, I must apply to extend my ancestry visa?

Here's my best guess as to how one might describe my current document:     It's a visa that permits entry to the US under F-1 status until mm/dd/yyyy.   Is this correct? "
209,Query regarding surnames and UK Visa applications,"I recently got married , and then applied for a passport. The passport has my husband's name as my surname. But in the rest of my documents I have my father's name as my surname.  Will it be an issue while I apply for uk spouse visa?   Should I fill my husband's name as my surname in the UK visa application? "
210,UK Tier 2 visa sponsorship for an IT role by a small or large organisation,"Background  Various IT jobs were recently added to the Tier 2 Shortage Occupation list. However, a set of additional requirements for sponsoring organisations is included on Page 14.  My question revolves around this specific point:     The sponsor must:      (a) have between 20 and 250 employees (or have fewer than 20 employees and have included the letter from UK Trade and Investment (UKTI) confirming that UKTI have been working with the company and support the application in relation to the company’s trade or investment activity); [...]   Large and Small Sponsors  Does this mean that a small organisation (less than 20 people) or a large organisation (more than 250 people) cannot sponsor people in these roles at all? (I'm not sure how this would be tenable for a large organisation, unless the intent of the rule is to try and support small business.)  Or does this just mean that the sponsor will have to advertise the job, and the applicant will not get the full benefit of filling a ""shortage occupation""? "
211,Permanent resident in France with Job offer in Germany,"I have a permanent resident permit in France ( I am an non EU national), that is it is valid for 10 years renewable. I am working full time on CDI for one employer in France since 6 years. Have been here in France almost 8 years. I have a prospective job offer based in Germany which is interesting. However, I want to know if I can work in Germany and relocate there hassle free with the residency card that I have. My fiancée and live in partner in France is a British Citizen although we don't plan to marry right away.  Will I be able to tell this potential employer that I have right to work in Germany? Do I have to go through application of whole new Germany residency card? Also, I am interested in working in the UK as my partner would like to go back to his home country- in this case I suppose the French permanent residency doesn't help at all or does it?  Thanks for your help, "
212,How to convert two different driving licenses into a single German license?,"It's a bit of an odd one, but I'm just checking so I don't get into too much trouble.  I had two driving licenses: Israeli + UK (took tests in both countries). In the UK I also took the automatic bike test up to 125cc as well (category A or something like that. I believe it's automatically upgraded to 500cc after a couple of years, but I moved out of the UK since).  When I moved to Germany a few years ago, I exchanged my Israeli license to a German one. So I now have both UK and German licenses. The German license however doesn't include the bike license, because my Israeli one didn't have it.  My UK license is about to expire, and as far as I understand it, I cannot renew it unless I'm a UK resident. I am therefore considering exchanging it in Germany. I'm a bit concerned about already having one German license however...   Should I just go with my UK license and try to exchange it? Should I show my German license upfront, or only if asked?  It would be nice to ""keep"" two licenses, since I did take several tests and kinda ""earned"" it, but it's not a major concern even if I ""lose"" one of them. Mostly trying to figure out how to go about this. "

214,Applying a visa for working in Spain,"I would like to apply a working visa in Spain. I'm not an EU citizen. I got a chance to work as an internship last year until this past March. Now I'm in my country. My employer wants to hire me again as a full-time employee. Now they are working on documents.  I want to know what are the exact processes of applying for the working visa. First, Do I need to wait for the work permit before I applying for the visa from my country? Is this process going to be difficult? I mean I already worked with them. They know me. We talked everything about me coming back. I have read that the employer has to do some stuff to get me the work permit which is sometimes difficult.  After I get the work permit, I just have to bring it to apply for the visa to come to Spain, right? Thank you. "
215,US citizen working remotely for a US company wanting to stay in France for 9 month,"My husband and I are US citizens living in the States. He is a college professor and has accepted a fellowship in France during his sabbatical year from September 2016 to May 2017.  I'm currently working full time for an US based company. I would like to join him with our one-year-old son to France, but will need to keep my job in order to support us.   Not sure what type of visa I will need for this. Would a long-term visa allow me to work for an US company while in France? What's the tax implication? Or do I need to leave the country every 90 days in order to keep it legal? "

I have an opportunity to broker an investment in a manufacturing company registered in Nevada, USA. Am I eligible to claim brokerage on such an effort? Or does my F-1 visa prevent me from collecting such compensation? "
217,Where can a skilled and upper middle class US citizen work?,"I recently overheard people discussing, ""if (X person) became president they would move to Y"".  I recognize it ignores the privilege americans have in traveling and is insensitive to the many refuge crises etc, but it got me thinking, and I was wondering where those people could actually work.  I was reading this question: What countries are easy for a US citizen to move to?  I've seen a few questions / answers like that but they tend to pertain to study/work, very low qualifications such as the above question, etc. I'm hoping for a slightly more specific to the people I've seen say that they will move. I'm essentially looking for a list of nations (if any) that the people who express those sentiments would be allowed to work / live in. As in is it feasibly and where could they go?  Example Scenario:  US Citizen No ancestral connection to the country they're trying to move to No criminal issues / debt / etc (nothing derogatory) Single (no need to move a family etc) mid 20's (I heard something about age being limited on some visas) Well compensated (low six figures) STEM profession in US at top company Bachelors STEM degree from good US university Cash assets let's say 3-400k Assume companies in the country would be willing to hire said person   From my experience I've previously been offered positions in Canada / England and told that work visas wouldn't be a problem etc. Is that true, I wasn't sure if the recruiters were just saying that (I know US ones do sometimes)? Where else would it not be a problem?  Some of my friends who are US citizens work abroad but they have familial ties to those countries.   Please ignore the probable changes in income / taxes / etc. But if you have insights into changes in quality of life of a country (ex STEM has a low value and job opportunities would be low if at all) if you know any. Also please state if the country requires a company sponsorship to enter, or any other insights. Example country 1 will let any well off american in with at least 100k, or country 2 will only allow those with company sponsorship in, or country 3 offers 2 months to find a job etc.   "
218,"Fulfilling J1-visa two-year residence, when you are no longer a citizen of ""home country""","I received J1-visa and was marked as a subject to two-year home-country physical presence rule. At that time I was still a citizen of Kazakhstan.   I moved to Europe (Czech Republic) immediately after J1-visa expiration and became a citizen of CZE, meaning, I can't normally go back to KAZ (home country in J1-visa) in order to fulfill 2-year residence requirement.   I participated in USA-sponsored program. From what I've heard, they don't grant waivers in this case. ""The Kennedy-Lugar Youth Exchange and Study (YES) program, funded by the U.S. Department of State, provides scholarships for secondary school students (age 15-17) from countries with significant Muslim populations to spend one academic year in the United States.""  Does it mean that I am banned forever and cannot immigrate to USA ? How exactly is USA government going to verify the fulfillment of this requirement, e.g. there is a global travel history for every citizen of every country  ? "
219,Studies Outside Quebec,"I'm a software developer who wants to apply to the Quebec Skilled Worker Program.  I graduated as a Systems Engineering (original name in Spanish ""Ingeniería de Sistemas"") 1 year ago (5 1/2 years of studies). In my career we learnt about 2 main fields: programming (software) and network infrastructure (Cisco-related stuff). Every student had to learn both, but some acquired more experience in one field than the other.   I chose the software one, so that's why I'm a developer as I mentioned. I'm interested in knowing if Quebec would consider my Systems Engineering degree equivalent to a ""Computer Science"" or ""Computer Engineering"" degree or would it count as a ""Electrical, Electronic and Communications Engineering"" degree based on the Area of Training table (PDF)?   One of the first two would give me 16 points towards the skilled worker program while the third one would give me 12 points.  Would my current knowledge and experience (2+ years working as a developer), influence what area of training my degree would fit into when I apply for the ""Comparative evaluation of studies done ouside Quebec""?

220,Is it possible to rent an apartment in Denmark without a CPR number?,"Do you always need a Danish CPR number in order to rent an apartment in Denmark? Is it possible to finalise a rental agreement from abroad, i.e. when you do not yet have a CPR number? "
221,Residence permit expires while travelling,"I live and work in Austria.  I need to travel from Austria to England for a meeting (and come back).  However, my Austrian residence permit will expire during my stay in England.  I will apply for an extension of my residence permit well in advance, but from my previous experience, I will not be allowed to collect my new residence permit before the old one expires.  Will this cause any trouble to my journey in any way?  In particular, will I be refused to board either of the flights?  And will I be denied entry to England or Austria?  If this situation turns out to be problematic, then is there a solution to the problems?  In case it matters, my passport allows me to stay in the EU visa-free for 90 days, and it is likely that by the time I travel to England, I will have a notification letter (in German) from the Austrian authorities stating that the extension of my residence permit is approved.  It would be great if there are websites of authorities that I can show the airline/immigration officer in case of an argument. "
222,EEA Family permit- extended family members,"I am an Italian full time uni student in the UK and I want my father and sister to visit me here (They are non-eea nationals, but in possession of an indefinite leave to remain in Italy)  They have requested for an EEA Family permit as my family members but it has been refused because they do not qualify as such. Now they are preparing another application, and this time as my extended family members and I have a few questions in regards to that:   One of the qualifying criterias of an ""extended family member"" is proving that they are members of my household, is a Family Status certificate enough to prove that? Would you advice mentioning the regulation that makes them qualify as extended family members, to further validate their application? Are copies of my bank statements and european health insurance card enough proof of self-sufficiency (so, not dependent on public funds)? My tuition fee is funded by the UK government (tuition fee loan), is that a form of dependency on public funds?   "
223,"UK Citizen, Implications of losing my UK Residency?","I was born in the UK, I have a British passport, my parents were married when I was born, are married, both have British passports and I lived in the UK until age 18.  I have however lived outside of the UK for over 4 years without going back. I therefore fall outside the Statuatory Residency Test.   Can I still go back to the UK and work permanently at anytime that I choose without having to pay for a new visa or any other fines?  What other implications are there of not being a UK resident other than tax benefits? "

225,Indian citizen planning to marry a Polish citizen,"I'm an Indian citizen and I'm planning to marry my Polish girlfriend. After the marriage, we are considering the option of moving to Poland. I wanted to know if I can move to Poland right away after the marriage and how long it will be before I can work in Poland.  Do I still need to get a work permit to work in Poland if I'm married to a Polish national or can I start working right away? Additionally, if I do need a work permit, how long does that take? "
226,Is Dual Residency between the EU & UK Possible with Permanent Residency Visa (ILR)?,"I am and American woman who started with a spouses settlement visa and have had ILR for almost 5 years now. I have been eligible to apply for UK citizenship about two years ago but never applied because, due to a family bereavement, neither my husband nor I have been in full time employment since 2010.   I have recently split with my husband (separated, not divorced) taken a full time teaching post in Malta. As this is a government/public sector position I am facing suspension at the end of the month of I dont apply for Maltese residency and work permit. I was avoiding this because I was afraid that I would loose my ILR before I could make a citizenship application. Is this correct?  Will I lose my ILR if I apply for a Maltese ID card and NIS number? Or will I only become liable for dual residency taxes?   The only reasons I can find for losing ILR is staying away for more than two years or bad behaviour.   For political, tax and cultural purposes I am planning on applying for Italian citizenship (based on ancestry) rather than UK citizenship, but I do not want to risk loosing my ILR visa until I can conform that my grandfather was not naturalised before my father was born.   Can anybody clarify the UK's standing on dual residency for a third-party national? "
227,How long to wait before reapplying for the UK visa after refusal,"I came to UK in July 2012 on Tier 2 General Migrant Visa. My wife recently applied for her visa under the Tier 2 General Migrant Dependent Category. However, it got refused 2 days ago, because of lack of documents supporting that the relationship is subsisting and ongoing.  She has been given the right to lodge an appeal using IAFT-2 form within the next 28 days. However, we have decided not to go down that route and instead reapply again with all the additional documents submitted. Since, we have all those proofs (wedding photographs, chat history, etc).  My question is, how long does she have to wait before reapplying? Does she have to wait for 28 days before reapplying (i.e., after the time limit to lodge an appeal is over)? "
228,Foreign registered car in UK,"I am considering buying a Spanish registered car in the UK and driving it to Spain where it will be registerd in my name and left there permanently  If the car is close to the 6 month limit from the time it was brought over here by the previous owner, am I limited to that period to get it out of the country? Alternatively, if I bought the car and drove it in UK having already registered it in Spain, would I be breaking the law? "
229,Using an EU car in the UK as a student,"There are already two questions (How long can a student drive an EU registered car in the UK? and How long can I drive a EU-registered car in the UK?) on site site regarding using an EU registered car in the UK, however, I think my case is somewhat different.  I am an EU citizen (German nationality) and I am currently doing my Ph.D. in the UK. In order to be exempt from paying the German health care system, I have unregistered my residency in Germany (and subsequently registered residency in the UK).   I have brought a German-registered car to the UK. This car is insured (and taxed) in Germany. It is owned by my parents, who are still living in germany.  My question boils down to:      Am I required to register, tax, and/or insure this car in the UK assuming that I will keep it there no longer than the period of my Ph.D. ?   I have found varying information online regarding this matter. Specifically, on europa.eu there is an exemption clause listed for students (link below):     Exceptions to compulsory registration after 6 months      If you are staying in another country only in order to study, you can drive your car without having to register it or pay taxes there - for as long as you are enrolled in an educational establishment in that country.   This seems to be derived from Council directive of 28 March 1983 Article 5 1b, a rule which is quoted by other sources.  The way I see it, there are three pieces:   taxation (road tax) registration (license plates) insurance   However, none of the sources which I have found online give a clear picture for either one of those pieces. Event more troubling is that the gouvernment website gov.uk does not list an exemption for EU students. I have not found any specific information on how the situation changes if the car owner is not a UK resident and not the person driving the car. "
230,Can I pass my UK driver's licence with my EU (French) passport?,"I have lived in London for 5 years now. My passport is French, can I still pass my theory and practical test here?

231,US Citizen splitting time between UK and Switzerland,"Could a US citizen with a UK Long Term Family visa alternate 90 day periods in the UK and Switzerland indefinitely?  Switzerland is a Schengen country, but the UK isn't.  Background: my mother in law is ready to retire.  We live in Switzerland, her other daughter is in the UK.  Our thought: she could spend 90 days here, 90 to 180 in the UK, then 90 here, or even alternate months.    Related: is there a Swiss equivalent to the Long Term Family visa that would simplify the process? "
232,Visa uk and France,My father was a resident of France in 1984. He has since passed away. My uncle told me that it was possible that my father acquired French citizenship as both he and my father resided there for a long time. I'd like to check if that may have actually been the case. I have my father's date of birth and his Sri Lankan passport number from his old passport issued while in France. Now I'm in London. Could I inquire with the French embassy about my fathers details? Would they have a record of my father's citizenship if he indeed had such?  
233,Work Permit for Summer Work In UK,"I am originally from Pakistan, and am now studying in Germany. If I wanted to do a summer internship in UK (full time) what type of Visa would I need?

234,Employment letter for H1B - can it have an electronic signature instead of an ink signature,"I am an Indian citizen (with an Indian passport) working in Paris on a long stay French visa (valid until 28/Apr/2015). I have a PHD from a US university in 2013 and  a job offer (job starts 1/May/2015) from the same US university and qualified through the ""cap exempt"" H1B petition. My approved I-797 says that I can apply for H1B stamping at the Paris consulate in France.  The list of documents required for the interview are published on the US embassy in France's website as:   A valid passport  DS-160 online application confirmation page One photograph taken within the last 6 months Original of Form I-797.  If the I-797 was approved more than two months prior to your visa interview, bring a letter from your employer confirming your continued employment.   The supporting documents are mentioned as being the I-797 in ""original or copy"".  My employer however did mail me a physical copy of the letter of employment. Alas my name is printed incorrectly (one letter is incorrect: I suppose that renders the name incorrect).  Since the employment letter is not a required document since my I-797 was approved last week and NOT 2 months ago, should I go ahead with scheduling a visa appointment in the interest of time? (I have 2.5 more months left on my French visa and I would like to get my US visa before this expires.)  Question:  However, just to be on the safe side, can my employer send me a corrected employment letter via email with an electronic signature as against a physical letter with an ink signature?  I don't want further delays in shipping of letters to affect my visa interview date and figured that a letter through email attachment would be way quicker (instantaneous) than postal mail service (1 week wait at least). "
235,"How far back does USA care where you lived, when applying for citizenship based on 3+ years of marriage","This has 2 questions that I felt were sufficiently related to be together in one posting. I have marked the questions in bold text.  According to the information here at uscis.gov, a person may qualify for US citizenship if:   they have been a legal permanent resident for at least 3 years, AND they have been married to a US citizen for at least 3 years, AND during the last 3 years, they have not been out of the country for 18 months or more   Being that I have been a green card holder for about 20 years, been married to the same wonderful lady for about that time, and have lived in USA for the last 4+ years, I thought that I would go ahead and submit the N-400 application.  My question is about the fact that if I go back in time before the 4 years, I have sometimes been living abroad for more than a year. This was for work reasons (I had found work in another country) and during these times I lived abroad with my wife and we filed our US tax returns from abroad.  Although the N-400 form allows a person to select the basis for the qualification for naturalization, as shown below...    ...it later asks for the residential information for the last 5 years, as shown below:    Here the question I wanted to ask is, does a person need to disclose residential information for 5 years even when applying on the basis of the 3-year rule?  The other, related, question is about this part from the ""Document Checklist, Current Fees, Naturalization Eligibility Worksheet"".    If I follow the workflow on the document, I eventually get to the point shown in above screen shot. That seems to give the impression that if I have ever been out of the country for more than 1 year without submitting form N-470, I would not be eligible for naturalization.  The question here is that, when a person is applying based on the 3-year rule, does the government care if a person lived 2 years abroad 15 years ago, without submitting the N-470 form? "
236,Remote work in Europe for EU citizen. How does it work from the legal point of view?,I'm a software developer from Latvia (EU country).  I am planning to marry a Brazilian woman and move to Brazil this year for a permanent living. But I will still have EU citizenship. So I would like to find a full-time remote job in one of European countries (Germany / Spain / France / Italy / UK / Any other)  The problem is that I don't know what paperwork should I do to be able to work like this. Do I need any documents to prepare? Do I need any special permissions? Maybe here is someone with a similar experience? 
237,Entering the UK with a valid EEA Family Permit about to expire,"I am a Turkish citizen married to an EU (Estonian) citizen, with whom I recently moved to the UK. I am currently based in the UK and holding an EEA Family Member Permit, which will expire by 5th of March 2015. I am unemployed, but I am registered with a local city council as a tenant.  Due to urgent matters, I have to be in Turkey for a while and will return to the UK on the 2nd March, 3 days before my permit's expire date. I will go myself, as my husband needs to work here. I'm aware of my need to apply for the UK residence card before the expiration of my EEA Family Member Permit, but during this application, which is said to take months, I won't be able keep my passport and travel abroad. Due to this, I have no choice but to apply immediately once I am back.  I would like to know if this issue may cause any problems entering the UK borders on my return? If yes, what were the possibilities of lessening the problems? "
238,Should a potential green card applicant change their name before starting the green card process?,"My wife is a Brazilian citizen (I am a US citizen), and we wanted to begin the process of applying for a green card for permanent residency in the US. Right now, she is an F-1 student visa with 1-year OPT. As part of this process, we also wanted to change her name.  Should we change her name before starting the process in Brazil? In the US? Or both? Or, should we apply for the green card under her current name and then change it once the process is complete?  All of her current documentation and IDs (visa, passport, OPT card, driver's license, social security card) uses her current name. The only thing that has her new name is our marriage certificate. "
239,Getting a driver's license in France as a foreigner,"I currently live in the US and I am moving to France.  I learned to drive in the US but I am not an American citizen.  This means that currently I only have an American driver's license (the only one I have ever had) which will expire soon after I leave the USA, since it's valid only for as long as I can legally stay here.  On the website of the Embassy of France in Washington, it says,     ... you can take the written and driving portions of the French licensing examination after one year of residence in France.   (But please do check the context if the quote at the link!)  Does this mean that it will be impossible for me to drive in France in the first year?  Is it at all possible to get a driver's license in France before having stayed there for a full year? "
240,"Does foreign earned, excluded income count as gross income for the filing requirement?","For a US citizen who qualifies for the foreign earned income exclusion, does income excluded in this way count towards gross income, as it relates to having to file an income tax return? I understand how the exclusion itself functions, but I am wondering if it's possible to utilize it to avoid needing to file a return.  According to the IRS, for tax year 2014:     If you are a U.S. citizen or a resident alien of the United States and you live abroad, you are taxed on your worldwide income. However, you may qualify to exclude from income up to $99,200 of your foreign earnings.   ...   The foreign earned income exclusion is voluntary. You can choose the exclusion by completing the appropriate parts of Form 2555.   ...   If you are claiming the foreign earned income exclusion only, you can use Form 2555. In some circumstances, you can use Form 2555-EZ to claim the foreign earned income exclusion. You must file one of these forms each year you are claiming the exclusion.   But also (emphasis added):     The amount of foreign earned income (and foreign housing costs) excluded from an individual's gross income will be used for purposes of determining the rate of income tax and alternative minimum tax (AMT) that applies to his or her nonexcluded income.    And USC 26, section 911 says1,2:     (a) Exclusion from gross income   At the election of a qualified individual (made separately with respect to paragraphs (1) and (2)), there shall be excluded from the gross income of such individual, and exempt from taxation under this subtitle, for any taxable year—   (1) the foreign earned income of such individual, and   (2) the housing cost amount of such individual.    For 2014, if your gross income is less than $10,000, you do not have to file a return. If all income qualifies for the FEIE, and is more than 10K but less than 99K, is filing required (because the exclusion is optional, so one must file form 2555 to take it), or not (because gross income is less than 10K)? Note that the exclusion specifically alters gross, and not adjusted gross, income.  Here's a (hopefully) simple example. Say for 2014 the following applies:   Qualify for the foreign earned income exclusion for the entire year Earned $50,000 working outside the US, and it all qualifies for the exclusion  Earned no income inside the US  Paid no US tax and thus cannot receive a refund All other credits, deductions, etc. do not apply (to keep things simple) No other parties involved (single, no dependents, cannot be claimed as a dependent, etc.) Not otherwise required or wishing to file   From 1-3, gross income is calculated as [tex]50K of foreign earnings is excluded. Since gross income is less than $10K, is it still required to file a return? If not, are there any reasons to do so anyway? "
241,Should I have multiple employers file H-1B petitions for me?,"I have great offers from 2 distinct companies, A and B, in the United States. I recently became aware that it is perfectly legal for different, unrelated employers to each file an H-1B petition for me. Both A and B are aware of the whole situation and are willing to go ahead, so I'll only have to make a decision between the two if both petitions get through the lottery process.  However, based on the information in this article on murthy.com (quoted below; emphasis mine), it doesn't seem like a very good idea to file multiple petitions, even via separate employers, this year.     ... for the fiscal year 2015 (FY15) H1B lottery, the USCIS has been issuing notices of intent to deny (NOIDs) when virtually identical petitions have been filed for the same beneficiary by two or more potentially related companies.      The USCIS is suspicious of cases in which filings for the same person share key details. ... Commonly identified factors typically include end-clients with the same identity, and location and job descriptions that are identical or virtually identical. The USCIS also points to similarities in supporting documents.      The NOIDs offer two options to overcome the likelihood of having the cases denied. First, the NOIDs request proof that the petitioning companies are not related. This can be evidenced by various documents that demonstrate corporate existence, structure, and ownership. Alternatively, if the companies are related, the NOIDs ask for evidence of how the companies each have separate, distinct business needs. This typically is understood to mean that there must be more than one distinct job opportunity, rather than simply an effort to have a backup plan in the event that one employer's H1B petition is not selected in the lottery.   My concerns are as follows:   Will filing multiple petitions through separate employers increase my chances of getting a visa? Does my situation come under the ""virtually identical location and job descriptions"" scenario, which is apparently a potential reason for denial? What ""key details"", if shared across the petitions, are potential causes for denial? Both offers are for similar roles, and based in the same city, but the companies themselves are completely unrelated. However, what concerns me here is the way the article is phrased: ""two or more potentially related companies"", signalling that even the hint of a connection will lead to a denial with significant probability. Are there any down-sides to filing multiple H-1B petitions? Assuming I do file multiple applications, how would I explain my intent to USCIS? Any other advice / suggestions regarding my specific situation.   At this point, any kind of advice or help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you! "
242,"Returning to my US address, do I get a special enrollment period to sign up for health insurance?","I have been residing outside of the US, but have used a New York State address for certain purposes. I now intend to move back to that same address. I would like to buy health insurance soon after I arrive. According to healthcare.gov,     Most health plans sold outside Open Enrollment don’t qualify as minimum essential coverage.   and     The only way you can enroll in a health plan through the Marketplace outside Open Enrollment is if you qualify for a Special Enrollment Period.   One of the ""Qualifying Life Events"" for a Special Enrollment Period listed at nystateofhealth.ny.gov [WARNING: site access blocked to non-US IPs] is a     Permanent move to NY, or permanent move from one county to another within NY   Does my move count as a move to NY, because I am truly moving and changing my residence? Or do I not get a Special Enrollment Period, because I'm moving to the same county that I already had an address in?  According to the Health Reform FAQs of kff.org,     Most states consider you a resident if you intend to make that state your permanent home. So-called “snowbirds” may own a second home and live part of the year in another state, but their official state of residence is where they spend most of the year, where they pay taxes, where they register their cars, or are registered to vote.   Instead of a second US state, I have been living in another country, so I pay taxes and have registered a car in New York State, even though I spend almost no time there. "
243,When are social security contributions paid in France?,"I need to register for French social security (CMU de base) for the first time. I don't fall under the employer, self-employed or student schemes. I do have income, though, so it will cost me and the cost is significant). As I understand, I can register with CPAM at any time during the year, but what period does my initial payment cover? In other words, when would I have to make the next year's contribution?  This is probably a non-issue for most people in France, since they're covered continuously and simply pay once a year, so when the each year's cover ""ends"" is a purely academic question. However, it is an issue for me when registering for the first time. Basically, I want to avoid the situation where I pay a full year's contribution for only a month or two of cover. "
244,How to rent an appartment in Germany as a fresh settler?,"When I've arrived to Germany, the first thing I've need to do was to search for an appartment. What striked me, was hard for me to comprehend 'excentrity' of the landlords who required job contract (ehm, why is it important? better ask how much money I have on side...). It wasn't a problem for me because I've already got a job. But...  Consider typical expat situation. You want to settle in Germany. You come there to look for a job. You need an appartment... So how should you look for it to go over that 'job contract' requirement?  Is this 'additional requirement' a standard at all, or was it only a regional variation (Bavaria) or I simply had 'strange luck' when searching for appartment?  "
245,When should an expat or ex-expat fill tax declaration in Germany?,"From what I've learned from locals, filling tax declaration in Germany is fully optional, until you have your company. Most people are doing this, because they get a tax return. But the only consequence of not doing this is not receiving tax return.  However, what about the situations where you are an expat (arriving within tax year) or an ex-expat (leaving within tax year) and in given year you have an income in 2 (or more) EU countries? Does filling a tax declaration remains still optional?  "
246,'Localized' services when leaving Germany?,"Are there any regulations that protect the consumer in case of leaving Germany, when the services that he have purchased can't be served outside Germany?  For example, if an emigrant has an Internet and cable TV contract for 2 years and leaves Germany in the middle of that contract, does he have to pay for them for 1 year, or the provider is obliged to accept the termination of the contract without extra fees, because he'll be unable to provide the services outside Germany?  I don't ask if some providers are offering such possibility, but if there's a law requiring them to do so.  "
247,New passport in married name - UK spousal visa,I have received my new passport in my married name. Do I have to transfer my UK spousal visa from my old passport in my maiden name? OR can I just travel with them both until it is time to renew the visa?   My visa was issued in my maiden surname but I was already married at the time thus the spousal visa. 
248,"As an American, can I work in New Zealand for a US company?","I work for a company in the United States, but I work online remotely and can do so from anywhere.  I would like to get an IEP Work Exchange visa. I have looked into it, and it seems that I qualify. Let's assume that I do. My employer is OK with me doing whatever, so long as it won't get them in legal trouble with anyone.  Can I use the Work Exchange visa to work remotely from NZ? Is this legal? I understand that advice here is not formal legal advice, but I want to at least get a sense of what is doable before I invest in pursuing this further.  I've looked into it a bit myself, but pointers to places where I can look to find the answer out on my own are also welcome! "
249,How to rent a house in Melbourne Australia?,"I'll be arriving in Australia (Melbourne) on 18 March 2015. I'll need to rent a house very soon after I arrive. Assuming I have enough cash for rent up front, and a bond of e.g. 1 month's rent, what else do typically I need to rent a house?  I should add that I probably won't yet be employed at the time that I'm looking for a house. Housing my family is a higher priority than searching for a job.  Is it possible to rent a house without having seen it first? I was told that it'll illegal to rent a house without viewing it first, but this makes it very difficult for me and  my family. Ideally we'd have something we could go straight into. "

We are expecting a baby in a few months. Due to some circumstances, we have decided to have the delivery in India and my wife will travel to India before the delivery. She would stay in India for at least a year after the delivery.  I would like to stay with her during the initial months after the birth of the baby. In these circumstances, am I eligible to get the parental leave with the 67%/1,800 euro Elterngeld? Even if I'm not eligible for the Elterngeld, can I just get a few months of leave without pay? "
251,Applying for ACS skills assessment and student visa,I have applied to few colleges in Australia for my masters degree and I am expecting to study there starting from August. For this to happen I will also be applying for a student visa in a couple of months. My plan is to apply for Australian PR once I start my course so that I don't have any problem in finding a job once I graduate.   I already meet the 65 point requirement for Australian PR. But I am not starting the PR process right away because I was told that having an active pr application while applying for a student visa can indicate dual intent and can lead to the rejection of the student visa. Is this correct?   Can I start the PR process once I start studying in Australia? Well this void my student visa?   Also please let me know if I can get my skill assessment done from Australian computer society before I apply for student visa and submit the expression of interest after I enter Australia with the student visa?  Or should I start the skill assessment also only after entering Australia with a student visa?   Please guide me in this regard.  
252,Validity of Schengen long stay (Scientific D) visa after tendering resignation from job,"I am an Indian citizen (Indian passport holder) and I am in France on a Schengen long stay (Scientific/D visa). My Schengen visa is valid through 28 April 2015. I understand that the key reason I have a long stay visa is because I have a job in France. Due to a variety of reasons, I am planning on giving my employer the 1 month required notice and resigning from my job on the 25th of March 2015.  Since after the 25th of March 2015, I do not have a job anymore, will that invalidate my long stay visa and must I leave France on the 25th of March (about 33 days earlier than the 28th of April validity on my visa)? Does my having a job govern my duration of stay in the Schengen area? "
253,Can Freelance Writers be authorized to work in the US?,"I'm a freelance writer and was looking at applying to more companies. Some of them specify an authorisation to work in the US. I'm a legal resident of India. So what does this mean for me? I don't want to shift to the US, I only want to write for different US based companies. Do I have to set up a corporation so that they can show me as an independent corporation?   Any experience with this? "
254,"Should I sign my emails as ""Dr"" or ""PhD"" when looking for an apartment?","I'm moving to Zurich in a couple of months. I'm wondering if I should sign my emails with ""Dr"" or ""PhD"" (I have one) when I inquire for apartments?  I would never do this in my own country as I find it incredibly pompous (and landlords would too). However, I've been advised by my future supervisor to give her as a reference and clearly indicate that she is ""Dr XXX"". Apparently doctorates are much more respected in Germanic countries than where I come from. So would it be appropriate to sign my emails as ""Dr. XXX"" or ""XXX, PhD"", to increase my chances? Or would this act as a deterrent? "
255,Surinder Singh route,I am British living in the UK. My husband is a non-EU citizen living in Germany with 3 year resident permit. I want to know the exact way for the Surinder Singh route. I’ve just recently found about this. I am planning to go and live with him from February to October and that’s when I need to return back to my studies in the UK.

257,Can I travel while waiting for my Swedish residence card?,"My wife is an EU Citizen (Irish) and has been given a job in Sweden. I'm South African and have been told that I should apply for a residence card and that the process will take around 15 months.  If I've understood the Migrationsverket Website correctly, I'm entitled through EU right of residence (as a spouse) to live and work in Sweden while waiting for my application to be processed. While waiting I should enter Sweden using a Schengen visa, which will expire shortly after I arrive, and present myself for photographs and fingerprints as soon as possible once in Sweden.  Once I have completed this process, and I'm waiting 15 months for the application to be processed, how will I show my status as a legal resident of Sweden when traveling or applying for work?  Some examples:   As my Swedish visa will have expired, will I be able to leave Sweden to travel to South Africa and visit my family, or will they stop me at the border as it appears I have been living illegally past the terms of my visa? If they don't stop me, will I be able to re-enter Sweden as my visa is both expired and the terms were infringed by staying past the term? Will I be able to travel through the EU as a tourist while waiting for my application to be processed? How do I apply for work, open bank accounts etc, and prove that I'm legally allowed to live and work in Sweden?   Thank you for reading this, any help would be greatly appreciated. "
258,EU citizen marrying a non-EU citizen in the UK,"I am an EU citizen and started work in the UK a couple of weeks ago. I am planning to stay here for at least 5 years, if not more.  My non-civil relationship with my boyfriend (same-sex couple) started a year ago. He is a non-EU citizen (he does NOT need a visa TO VISIT the UK). We are planning for him to join me in the UK in the near future (approximately 2 years).  The problem is, neither of our home countries approve of any kind of legal partnership between same sex couples.  How can I bring my non-EU partner in the UK when I can't get married with him outside the UK? I would like to mention that I will qualify for the minimum income threshold currently in place for UK citizens willing to marry non-EU citizens. Because of Brexit I will probably need to meet those income and language requirements too. Also, his level of English is very good (C1/C2).  Can anyone crack this one? Is there any possibility at all for us to, perhaps, get married in the UK after I have lived there for like a year or so?  Many thanks! "
259,I am living in Kyrgyzstan and plan to work in Argentina,"I am Kyrgyz citizen and am planning to move to Argentina on a tourist visa first, then if I get a job get a work visa.  From reading online and talking to a different people there, I understand that you can come on a tourist visa and attend interviews with different companies. If you get any luck you might get hired and get a job.  Is it true that you can search for jobs while on a tourist visa there? Has anyone done something like that? "

261,Comprehensive Sickness Insurance (CSI),"I'm 65, a UK citizen, married to a non-EU citizen. We have just returned to the UK following a period in Spain and intend for her to apply for a UKRC soon under Surinder Singh provisions. My question concerns CSI for her. I will be self-sufficient ( private and state pensions) so reading the rules it seems clear that CSI will be required. However, as I'm over the age where NI contributions are required, what would happen if I set up as self-employed? Would that negate the CSI requirement for her and would I still need to make NI contributions given my comment about age above? "

In the I-485 Instructions, page 10, section titled ""Documentation of Your Immigrant Category"", USCIS asks the derivative applicant (i.e, me) to provide a photocopy of 'the principal applicant’s petition'.

264,TN versus H1B visa,"I will be working in US as a Software developer. Because I am a Canadian citizen, I am entitled to a TN visa. I have already looked at several posts about the comparison between TN and H1B. My question is more specific to my current circumstance.  From Chart Comparison between H1b and TN:  It says that      Immigrant Intent         TN:  May not possess immediate intent to immigrate.      H1B: May process for green card through immigrant visa processing.   Adjustment of status available in limited situations. May have ""dual   intent,"" i.e., may enter U.S. with intent to immediately process for   green card.     There is a large possibility that I will be staying and working in the US for the next few years (5 ~ 7). The benefit of H1B is that I will be able to apply for a green card, which definitely is favorable since I am considering staying in the US for a long time.  But the problem is that when I apply for an H1B, I will have ""Immigration Intent"". The TN visa is available for people who aren't processed for ""immigration intent"". If I happen to apply for an H1B, and then I don't get it, do I have to apply for a TN visa? Do you think it would cause problems? "
265,Shared flat and Germany family reunification visa for a third-country national?,"As per section 3.1.1 of this document, the living space requirement for the German family reunification visa of a third-country national is 12 sqm per person:     ""Without prejudice to state provisions, sufficient living space is usually deemed to be available if 12 sqm of living space are available to each family member aged above six and 10 sqm of living space for each family member aged below six. Adequate availability of the facilities (kitchen, bathrooms, lavatories) must be ensured. A shortfall of about ten percent is acceptable"" — (2.4.2. General Administrative Regulation to the Residence   Act).""   However, it does not state whether shared flats are allowed or not. I wonder if my wife can meet the family reunification visa requirements if I live in a shared apartment in which my private room meets the 24 square meters criteria? If positive, I wonder what the rental contract requirements of such a situation should be? Should the contract state that two persons are going to live there?  To clarify, we're not going to be living in a shared flat. I just want to save on expenses until she joins me. But she needs to enclose a proof of suitable accommodation upon her visa application. "
266,I am a dual US citizen living in Turkey with foreign rental income. How should I file my tax return for 2017?,"I have lived in Turkey for the past 13 years. I'm a citizen of both the US and Turkey, and I have only gained foreign rental income while living here. My husband is a non-resident alien and we are in the process of applying for his green card using the I-130 petition.  I need to file a tax return for 2017, but I haven't filed for the past 3 years. I don't know whether I should file Married Filing Separately or Married Filing Jointly. Also, my foreign rental income is under $10,000 per year, and I pay income and property taxes in Turkey as well.  Do I still have to pay any taxes? What deductions or exemptions can I make, if any? What forms should I use when I file? "
267,How to answer how long you have been at your current job?,"I am working on my online application for permanent residency in Canada from the US via Express Entry, and I'm being asked how long I have been at my current job. The form only has a pulldown menu to pick between and there is no other option to enter an alternate response. The question is ""How long have you been employed at your current job"" and the answers that possibly apply to me are ""1-2 years,"" and ""3+"" years."" I have been at my job for 2 years and a few months, which doesn't seem to fit into either of those two choices.  When it comes to indicating how long you've been with a company, how do you address rounding the years like this? Since I have been here for more than 2 years do I immediately go up to the next tier? Or since I have not been here for a FULL 3 years, do I not yet qualify for the 3+ years?  I originally posted this in the Workplace exchange and was told it was off-topic. Perhaps someone here has knowledge on this situation. "
268,Studying in Canada and working in the United States,"Does the USA allow students with non-US degrees to work under any visa?  Some background: I am an Indian citizen pursuing my master's in Canada in marketing. Once I am done with my master's, would it be possible to apply for a job in the States?

269,Moving to Europe from the US with $200k,"I am planning to move permanently from the US to Europe. I have no job, address, or bank account yet. The question is how do I transfer the money?  It seems that I can't wire it while still in the US since I can't open a European account from abroad. I guess it can theoretically be done in Europe, after I have an account opened there, but I am REALLY worried that American banks will cause all kind of problems authorizing the transfer of such amount from abroad. Has anybody done that? "
270,Transferring Prescriptions when moving to Canada?,"I am a current US citizen and have an ongoing prescription for a government-controlled substance that I will continue to need for the rest of my life. My current doctor writes my prescription and I must visit her regularly for checkups. I intend to move to Canada and don't know if I will encounter issues having my medication fulfilled through the healthcare system there. I assume I will need to get a new primary care doctor who will be able to write the prescription for me, but will I need to go through the same tests and meetings that I already did in order to get the diagnoses? Or will I be able to start with a new doctor and transfer my existing records and they will be able to pick it up where my US doctor left off? Does it make a difference that this is a government controlled substance? "
271,Do Australian citizens need any paperwork to work in New Zealand?,"Many years ago I'm sure Aussies and Kiwis were free to live and work in each other's country without special visas or complicated paperwork.  And I believe that some decades ago that changed to make it just a little harder for the Kiwis to work in Australia, but not vice versa, as the numbers were tilted far in the NZ->AUS direction.  My question is about the AUS->NZ direction today in 2018. Can I just show up in NZ as an Australian and get a job? Or has it all changed? (Also I might've been wrong about how it used to work in the first place.)  I did a quick bit of Google searching and it looks like I don't need a visa to go there or to work there. But maybe I need some other stuff that might not be totally trivial?  In any case it doesn't look like the question has been asked on this site before so having some info here would be a good reference for others looking for this in the future. "
272,Schengen visa expired,"I'm Colombian. I came to Poland in August 2017 on a visa exemption for the Schengen zone, but I started to work and my employers sent the request for a working permit in November (two days before the expiration of my Schengen period). I received my working permit in December and now I'm waiting for my residency permit, which I've been told can take between 7 months to 1 year to arrive.  My contract finishes in June and my residency was requested up to July 12, 2018. I have several questions regarding my situation.   If, by the time my contract finishes, I haven't received my residence, will I have problems at the moment of taking an airplane back home? n case my residence arrives before July 12th, can I stay after that time with the same visa exemption (I’ve read this Schengen exemption reactivates after 6 months immediately after the end of the 90 days allowed for Schengen zone)? If my residency doesn't arrive before July, is there a way to reactivate my Schengen exemption without going back to my own country?   Timeline:   August 2017 - Arrival to Poland (no visa). Stayed for 88 days. November 2017 - Request for a working permit. December - I received my working permit. June 2018 - End of contract. July 2018 - End of time residency.   Thanks! "
273,Article 10 residence card?,"I'm Albanian and married to a British national.  We both currently live and work in Greece and I have an EU residence permit.  We're basically trying to go to England. I know the traditional way of doing things is for her to go to the UK, and earn a certain amount of money for me to apply from Albania, but the issue is we both can't afford to quit our jobs in Greece, and her to spend about a year trying to get settled with a job that pays 18.6k in England.  I've read about SS route and Article 10 residence card.  My understanding of the situation is that I need to get a residence card ""Permanent Residence Card of a Family Member of a Union Citizen"", to apply for an EEA family permit.  Is that something I'm supposed to get in Greece at the ministry of foreign affairs?  Can I not go England with my wife using my EU residence card (which i acquired through work contract, and living in Greece), and marriage certificate? Can I not even visit the UK like that?  It is all very confusing on GOV.UK, sorry if the question has been answered before, if so please just give me a link to it. "
274,Taking alcohol to Pennsylvania when relocating from outside the US,"I'm moving to Pennsylvania in the US from abroad and own a somewhat-valuable collection of alcohol which I would be bringing with me. Most of the (labeled) bottles are not sealed, so I am tentatively assuming that customs wouldn't treat it as a commercial import. However, if one wants to bring a cache of alcohol into the US for personal use, one has to comply with both federal and state import laws. Moreover, it seems that Pennsylvania has some very strange laws about alcohol in general, and the only information I could find online explicitly about importing alcohol is a PDF from the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board, which states:     It  is  generally  unlawful  for  anyone, other  than  the  PLCB or the  holder  of  a  sacramental wine license, an importer’s license, or a direct wine shipper license, to import any liquor (including wine) into Pennsylvania.   However, the same document states that there is some allowance for ""gifts"" to residents:     One of the exceptions found in the PLCB’s Regulations allows for liquor given to persons  residing  in  this  Commonwealth  by  nonresidents  to  be  imported  into  Pennsylvania  at  the  discretion  of  the  PLCB. 40  Pa.  Code  §  9.41. In  order  to  lawfully  import  liquor into Pennsylvania pursuant to this exception, an application for importation and an application    for  the  payment  of  tax  on  the  liquor  must  be  filed  with  the  PLCB’s  Bureau  of  Product Selection by the intended gift recipient (i.e., the person importing the liquor). 40 Pa. Code §9.51. In addition, a service charge must be paid to the PLCB and any state taxes must be paid. 40 Pa. Code §§ 9.52, 9.54. After receiving the application and the corresponding    fees, and upon being satisfied as to the truth of the statements   contained in the application, the  PLCB  may,  in  its  discretion,  grant  and  issue  a  consent  certification permitting  the  importation of liquor.  40 Pa. Code § 9.53.   Now, what does this mean for people becoming resident in Pennsylvania from outside the US? &mdash; What does someone actually have to do to bring alcohol from outside the USA into Pennsylvania as a new resident? What port of entry would be responsible for import duties if I e.g. fly into Chicago and then transfer to Philadelphia? Moreover, regardless of where my actual ""port of entry"" is, if I end up having to satisfy Pennsylvania's import regulations, would I be ""gifting"" myself the goods? I've brought alcohol into the US from abroad numerous times, but never to Pennsylvania and also never this much (I estimate about 10 liters in total).  In fact, I would prefer to ship it via post, but it seems that doing that is legally dubious as well, and I'd rather get stopped and have to deal with the problem at the airport rather than having to drive to some customs center in the middle of nowhere and have to pay a huge fine either to import it or to even just give it up (from my experience, in the US, when bad stuff like this happens, you have to pay even if they confiscate it... and they might even charge you for the time they hold it).  Is this really as Byzantine as it looks? "
275,Can we marry on the marriage visa if I'm claiming government funding?,"My boyfriend (he is Turkish) and I met 15 months ago in Costa Rica while travelling in Central America. We travelled all the way up to Mexico enjoying the most amazing time together and realising how we share the dreams and hopes for our future. We plan on buying land and having a farm.  In Mexico we found out we were having a baby. We decided maybe we could stay in this part of the world. But then we came back to Europe. I lived off my savings for a while but came to Turkey to be with him.  We want to be together and we want to get married so we can raise our little boy in England for a while before coming back to Turkey and then eventually back travelling the world.  When I go back to England I will have no more money and will have to claim benefits. Just for a short while, until either he can be here to work or I will work. Or both will work once baby is 6 months.  Can we get married if I'm on funding? And how can he get the spouse visa as I haven't worked for 18 months in the UK? "
276,I-485 date of marriage,"My wife and I are applying for adjustment of status (form I-485) through work authorization (from I-140 - NIW). I'm the NIW applicant and my wife is my the derivative applicant in the I-485.  We got married in March 2017 but did not obtain any government issued certificates since it was an Islamic marriage. We just got our marriage license from the county clerk last week (Jan 2018). Now, I don't know which marriage date should I enter in the I-485 forms? The new one? or the old one?  I am attaching both the old Islamic marriage contract and the new marriage license with my package. Is it bad that the official marriage data is only one week before submitting the application? "
277,Relocating to the UK with spouse,"My mother- and father-in-law are permanently relocating to the UK. My father in law is a British citizen, and has resided in the US for the past 20+ years. My mother in law is a US citizen.  It is to my understanding that my mother-in-law will have to apply for a family visa, granting her 'temporary leave to remain' in excess of 6 months so long as they meet the requirements, which brings me to my question.  If my father in law resides in the US, how can they meet the minimum income requirement (without savings), as his income for the past 12 months was earned outside the UK? He does have a job lined up in the UK, which will more than satisfy the income requirement, but does that count for anything?  Furthermore, the website states that this process takes 12 weeks but can be completed same-day if they are to apply in person. However, it appears that they can only do that from within the UK. Is there any way to expedite the visa application process?  Finally, how would my mother-in-law go about applying for indefinite leave to remain once she is granted the family visa and residing in the UK? "
278,I want to switch EU countries between my Bachelor's and Master's; must I leave Europe?,"I'm an Iranian student who did his Bachelor's in Italy in cinema. Now I want to do my Master's in another country in Europe, like Germany. Does anyone know if I would need to go back to Iran and ask for a German student visa? Or, considering that right now I'm in Europe (holding a permit of stay), can I go straight to the university to apply? "
279,Is Form G-325A no longer needed for K-1 visa I-129F fiancée petition?,"I'm about to petition for my fiancée using a K-1 visa I-129F form. I noticed that they used to require a G-325A form (Biographic Information) for both the petitioner and beneficiary.  However, the G-325A form is no longer listed in the government's I-129F page, nor on the I-129F checklist.  Does this mean it's no longer required for a K-1 visa application? It appears that's the case but I just want to make sure before I mail the packet so I don't get it returned. "
280,"As US citizen, is there a process to bring my wife into the United States, when we don't spend the majority of our time in the US?","I am a US citizen and my wife is not. She has yet to come to the United States. In the first years of our marriage, most of our time will be spent outside of the States. In a couple of years, we intend to have a second home in the States, and split our time how we wish between the countries.  With this background, I'm attempting to navigate the US immigration process. A green card as an immigrant visa would require that we spend a majority of our time in the US, so it looks like this is not the path. The only non-immigrant visa for a spouse is the K3-visa, which is only for being together while waiting for the result of the immigrant-visa process. Since we're not waiting for anything, this doesn't seem like the option either. The final option is just a standard tourist visa. I've read somewhere that doing a tourist visa, when you are married to a US citizen, might have problems about ""withholding information"". Is this true? Furthermore, tourist visas are processed without consideration for the fact that she is the spouse of a US citizen.  Where is the path that allows my wife to be with me in the States, without intention to immigrate at this time? Have I got something wrong? What have I missed?  She is currently my fiancé, not wife. I've not seen anything where the difference helps. "
281,Can someone travel to the Isle of Man with BRP and passport and no separate visa?,"I am a South African citizen with a valid UK Biometric Residence Permit (BRP). I know I can use the BRP in combination with my passport to leave and enter the UK when travelling.  I need to travel for one week to the Isle of Man. Can I travel to the common travel area (CTA) countries with only my BRP and passport, or do I need to have a separate visa for this? I have researched this online and can't find information specific for expats with BRPs.  The closest I can find is from gov.uk, which indicates that I do not need a separate entrance permit if I already have UK entry clearance, which seems enough, but I am not certain.  Does someone have experience with this? "
282,Hong Kong ID card and Chinese Nationality,"My two overarching and related questions:   What does having a Hong Kong ID card imply regarding my residency status and citizenship? Does having a Hong Kong ID card imply that I am a Chinese national? If not, how do I find out whether or not I am?   Background  I was born in the UK and am a UK citizen. Currently studying in Canada on a study permit (although I think this point is largely irrelevant for this). My mother is from China and my father is from Hong Kong - both are now UK citizens.  When I was much younger, my parents applied for a Hong Kong ID card for me (using my grandfather's residential address I believe), and I am currently in possession of the adult version, which I received when I was 18 I believe (I am currently 30). However, I have never lived in Hong Kong and only visit (for a few weeks) once every couple of years.  Does having this ID card make me a permanent resident of Hong Kong, despite me never having lived there and also not currently living there? And does that status ever expire?  Furthermore, does any of this make me a Chinese national? I believe theres a section on the ID card application where you can apply for citizenship, but my parents dont remember what they filled out on the original application form (it was 20 years ago)  I dont have a Hong Kong or China passport, only a UK one. However, I read that you can still be a Chinese national even if you never applied to have a HK/China passport.  I ask because I recently submitted a permanent residency application for Canada, and am worried that I may have omitted this information about nationality and other ID cards. Based on information from my parents I was of the understanding that my HK ID card had expired and that I am not/never was a Chinese national as I lack the passport. "
283,Adjustment of status from OPT to I-130 - petitioner's involvement and status,"I came to the United States on F1 (Student Visa) in 2015 and I graduated from school. I then got OPT (Optional Practical Training) and an Employment Authorization Card. I am working legally right now.  On the other hand, my dad is a permanent resident (Green Card holder) and he applied for an I-130 (Petition for Alien Relative) for me in 2011. The application is with the NVC (National Visa Center) right now.  My Priority Date now follows the table for filing visa applications, not the final action dates table in the Visa Bulletin so I can apply. I have 2 options now:   Adjustment of Status. Consular Processing   Since I am physically present in the United States I want to apply for Adjustment of Status. My dad is the petitioner and I am the principal applicant. My question is about my interview for Adjustment of Status:  Should my dad come to the interview with me? Or is it optional? On the other hand, my dad had been in my country (Out of the United States) for more than 6 years. I know that he has to not leave the United States for more than 6 months, but he had some health condition and he had to go to a hospital in my country. He came recently to the United States for a month and he got his SSN and ID. He also has a bank account and he filed for taxes for the last 3 years although he didn't work in the United States at all.  Does that affect the process of Adjustment of Status? If yes what can he do to avoid that? What are the documents that we need to apply for Adjustment of Status? Is the taxes issue related to the Adjustment of Status? If there is any suggestion that would help please advise me. "
284,"UK citizen working overseas. Planning a 2-week vacation. For purposes of travel insurance, how long is my “trip”?","Cross posting from the travel stack exchange, on the advice of someone there:  I've been living and working in mainland China for just under a year now. I think I am still classed as a 'UK resident' (since I intend to return). I am about to go on a 2-week holiday to India. I've noticed that most travel insurance policies (at least, the cheap ones) specify a 'maximum trip length', typically 21-31 days.  This led me to wonder, for the purposes of insurance, how long is my trip?  I found this article, which says:     For a UK policy to be valid, you need to be resident in the UK, have an address in the UK and would need to be going on a pre-booked trip that starts and finishes in the UK.   I'm a little confused... Does this mean I need a China-based policy? If I book a UK one, do I risk not being covered?  From the perspective of a UK-based insurer, is this all one big 400+ day trip? How does this work...?  Many thanks for any advice! "

I have 3 years of freelancing experience and 5 months J1 internship with a company in the USA. I was offered a full-time job by the company. Will it be possible for my company to apply for an H1B for me? Or do I have to wait until next year? 
287,What's the process for purchasing a used car in Austria?,"Can anyone share more information about the process of buying a car privately in Austria?  My understanding so far is that I have to:   Pay the seller for the vehicle in return for the documentation and service history, proof of ownership (Auto-Kaufvertrag example 1 | example 2), and Pickerl (proof of roadworthiness). Take this information to the office of a nearby insurer, where I pay tax and insurance in return for obtaining licence plates for the car. Return to the car with the plates and collect the keys from the owner. If insured fully comprehensive, I then have to get the car inspected at either the ÖAMTC or ARBÖ car clubs, or at the office of the insurer. (Until inspected it appears that insurance is only third-party, or subject to a higher excess.) Buy an Autobahn Vignette to use the car on motorways.   Questions:   Is my understanding of this correct? If I buy the car in another region, such as Vienna, can I obtain plates in Vienna for another region of Austria? Or do I have to register it in Vienna, then pay extra to re-register the vehicle in my home city?  "
288,How does 'Bulk Billing' work under Medicare in Australia?,"You seem to have the option of going to a 'normal' doctor, or one that bulk bills.

289,Where can I be tax resident when I don't stay in any EU-country longer that 6 months a year?,"I'm a Polish citizen. I've become a German resident because I'm working there, and as fair as I have learned, I'm treated as resident if I'm in given country (Germany) more than 180 days a year.  This has tax implications if I'd like to work as contractor. Staying more than 180 days in Germany I'd be forced to register a company there (and be taxed there).  However, assuming I don't stay in any EU country more than 180 days, and I'm still contracting (either changing contract or working remote), what implication on taxation and company registration does it have? Can I than register my company for contracting in any country I choose (for example, Cyprus), or I'd have to register it in my home country (Poland)?   Just to give an example, I am contracting for German country, that allows me to work abroad half the time. I spend 5 1/2 months in Germany, 5 1/2 months in Poland, and 1 month 'abroad' (for example Montenegro, Croatia) on holidays. In none of the countries I'm longer than 180 days. "
290,Can I lose my US citizenship for accepting employment with a foreign government?,"In my US passport, there's a section entitled ""Important Information"" located just before the visa pages. Item number 13 deals with circumstances in which one might lose their US citizenship (emphasis mine)     Under certain circumstances, you may lose your U.S. citizenship by performing voluntarily, and with the intention to relinquish U.S. citizenship, any of the following acts,   Then, item (4) in the sub enumerated list of things following the comma:     (4) accepting employment with a foreign government   I've never understood this phrasing. Under what circumstances would someone's intention to relinquish their citizenship become clear by where they accepted employment?  If I write time keeping software for a foreign government, I risk losing my citizenship? I can't use my skills as a sign language, English and other language interpreter, as these are mostly provided by the local government where I reside?  The clause is quite frankly scary to me, and I'm hoping to understand what precisely it implies by intention when it comes to employment with a foreign government, which can quite often be availed by non-citizens of that country.

My passport doesn't expire for another five years, what can I do? Should I just renew it now, even though it's not due to expire?  Once I get my status changed, this isn't an issue, but delays in paperwork and such could continue for months. "
293,Options to bring money when arriving in a new country,"When one settles in a new country for a new job/life, what are the possible methods to bring in enough money to start, and what is their relative cost? I think the same kind of problems appears no matter the country (bank facilities are relatively similar).  Indeed one faces generally a problem: one should pay one to several months of rent in advance, pay for insurance, possibly for a car, ...  And in terms of means of payment, it is usually tricky to get a bank account before arrival and bank cards may have a low ceiling.  So what are the options to bring in relatively large amount of money and what is the relative cost (it is more about knowing an order of magnitude of the cost, like is it adapted for small or large sums of money nothing precise)?

I am not talking about furniture but about large suitcases. I expect to pack 3 to 4 large suitcases. I am worried about the cost of extra luggage on the plane.  Are there other options, like is shipping separately my stuff allowed? and is it possible at a reasonable cost (I am mostly wondering about the relative cost between the plane and the shipping options, if prices are really different). Do cruises have higher luggage allowance? "

299,"As an EU national moving to France, what are the rules about registering?","Within the EU, for EU nationals, there is a right to freedom of movement, which (slightly simplified) means you can visit, live and work in any other EU country. Depending on the country you go to, you can't always just rock up and stay there without doing anything, as there are things like Directive 2004/38/EC which means that in some countries, you may have to register. (There's also the whole tax thing that gets involved if you stay too long, but that's a different question!)  As an EU national, if I move to France, what are the rules about registering? Specifically, how long do I have to do it, where do I go, and what do I have to take with me when I go? "

Does my nationality or ethnic origin affect the processes?  Assuming that all my Visas are current and I am allowed to work in UK. 
301,Avoiding pitfalls when transfering money between banks within EU (Germany -> Poland),"Theoretically we have now SEPA system, which should allow low-cost money transfers between bank accounts within EU.  About a year ago I've asked my German bank (Postbank) about the costs of money transfer to Poland. I was informed, that if I give IBAN number of Polish account, no money will be charged. I've transfered test sum of 10 Euro, and was charged with 8 Euro fee. Both banks denied taking that fee. Polish bank claimed no fee should be charged if I explicitely select SEPA option, but Postbank doesn't allow that (they claim they detect SEPA transfers automatically).   I'd like now to tranfer a larger sum, and I'd like to avoid such pitfalls. Do I have any real possibility to learn about such fees before doing transfer? What claims do I have in case such fee is taken from me, although it was promised not to be taken? "

I have recently received my convention d'accueil (or ""Welcome document"")  from the research lab I will be working with betwee 5/14-5/15.  I am to take this convention d'accueil to my local French consulate general to apply for a long term visa for researchers, scientists and teacher.  The visa form, although not difficult at all to fill out, has a question (item 25 on this form) that asks What will be your address in France during your stay?  I have asked my research lab about this but I haven't received an answer yet. Given my current work schedule, I have a small window of opportunity next week for my visa appointment and I may be unable to receive information in time from my future lab. Not pinning the blame on anyone and to be proactive, I would like to know how to solve this conundrum.  What should this address be since I don't have permanent accommodation figured out yet. I assume people don't just book apartments without seeing them. Should it be a temporary hotel accommodation address (+confirmation) or can I put in there ""in process of finding in xxx area in xx arrondissement""?  If it is at all relevant, I am an Indian citizen in the USA on an F1 visa/OPT teaching as a visiting professor at a public university. "

I was never in 7th or 9th grade, but twice in 8th and 11th, and in the grades with kids a year younger than me to 2 years older.  Do I have to worry about my children going through something similar if we change countries in the EU, or is school progress better regulated across boundaries nowadays. Like say university courses, with ECTS points that have to be reached in specific topics up to a certain year? Are there other countries outside of the EU which are similarly adjusted to switching between school systems?  Edit: to clarify, I mean all schooling systems before Higher Education (as in the graph in ppumpkin's answer). "

311,Job-seeker visa or work permit visa for a low-paying job,"I already have a job in a German company, but the salary is lower than the blue card limits. I know that there is a work permit visa, which does not have salary limits. However, I am trying for another job with a better salary. I just completed my Master's program from a German University and hence, I am also eligible for applying for an 18-month job-seeker visa. I need clarifications for the following questions:   I would like to know which would be the better option to go if I would soon change my job? A job-seeker visa or a work permit visa. For a job-seeker visa, is it possible to show my current job contract as financial proof or will I be asked to apply for a work permit visa as I have a contract already? In case of a work permit visa, can I change my job any time I want? Is there any extra procedure that I need to carry out when I change jobs? In the long run for getting a permanent residence permit, which of these two options would be better to take? If I have a work permit visa, can I still apply for a blue card if I meet the salary requirements later?   Thanks in advance. "
312,Vaccinations for the US,"I received the second NOA (Notification of Action) for the fiancee visa process and I'm getting myself ready for my medical examination before the interview at the US consulate in London. I have a record of my vaccinations and just want to confirm what I will need.   I never had the MMR vaccination (Measles Mumps Rubella). I had Measles and Mumps diseases but not Rubella so I need to get vaccinated for the latter. Is it worth getting tested for Measles and Mumps antibodies (65£ for each test at Knightsbridge) to prove I don't need vaccines for these 2? Single vaccines for these are not sold separately anymore so I would probably need to get the MMR vaccine anyway, correct? I never got vaccinated for Hepatitis A, Influenza, Meningococcal, Pneumococcal and Rotavirus. These vaccines are required according to the US Department of State.   According to the UK embassy you only need them if you're a child though. Do I need them since I never got them as a child?   (I never had chickenpox and didn't get a vaccine so I will need to get it done in the US before AOS (adjustment of status) since that it's not sold in the UK).   Is there a price list online for vaccines at Boots? I'm trying to find out if it's cheaper than Knightsbridge. I couldn't find the prices for Boots but other vendors have similar prices. Eg.

313,Employer: access to decision date of unrestricted certificate of sponsorship,"The UK Visas and Immigration authority contains several guides in its website destined for visa sponsors.  There are in particular 12 user manuals about the sponsorship management system (SMS).  Manual 12 (Restricted certificate of sponsorship) contains a section on ""How to view previously refused, withdrawn or rejected applications"", but for restricted CoS only.  However, there is no mention about whether this exists for unrestricted certificates, in any of the guides.  Is there a specific reason for this asymmetry? Or is the information available, just not mentioned in the guides?  The issue is that, in a given application, can the employer obtain such information without having to ask the migrant? For instance, the migrant may be undergoing appeal/administrative review, but if the employer sees ""REFUSED"" in their system, they might want to cancel/withdraw the sponsorship/job offer, negatively affecting the migrant. "
314,What happens to a Chinese-born citizen who acquires American citizenship by their parents naturalizing?,"I was reading up on Chinese nationality law about dual citizenship. I noticed the law states:     Article 9: Any Chinese national who has settled abroad and who has been naturalized as a foreign national or has acquired foreign nationality of his own free will shall automatically lose Chinese nationality.   So let's say a child is born in China to Chinese parents. The Chinese parents move to the United States and obtain green cards, and then naturalize before the child turns 18. Under U.S. law, children under the age of 18 who hold green cards when one of their parent naturalizes automatically acquires U.S. citizenship.  Under these circumstances, what happens to the Chinese citizenship of the child? In this case the child did not obtain U.S. citizenship on their own free will as it was given to them automatically.  Does this result in the child holding dual Chinese American citizenship? "
315,Health insurance for expats in France,"I posted earlier asking about the importance of the French language and basic visa requirements. I got great answers and so I ask here again.  I'll be 29 years old this year and will start a master's course in France this year. I understand that students/people over 28 years of age are NOT covered by the state-provided health insurance and must opt for a private health insurance. The visa requirements state that I have to provide a travel insurance covering at least 3 months and I have been told by the University representative that the University will provide assistance of all kinds. My questions, hence:   What is the PUMA? I have read about it but I'm not very clear about the eligibility and what will be covered. If I'm not eligible for ""national health insurance"", what options do I have? Can I get a list of private health insurance and prices? Is it advisable to opt for a health insurance from my country covering, let's say 2 years? Given that the insurance company has a presence in France, will such an insurance hold? Does one need a specific medical certificate or are there any medical processes/vaccinations required for French visa? I do not suffer from any ailment and have been vaccinated.   I'm from India and will be starting in September 2018. "

319,J1 Tax Return Romania,"I took part for the first time last summer (2017) in a work &amp; travel program with a J1 visa  . All went well, had a lot of fun, visited lots of places.   As you all know,at this  point in the year everybody must fill their tax return forms. So I started doing the tax returns by myself since I don't really trust the intermediary companies that do that for you (they take a fee + they might subestimate the tax returns on purpose).  After a little bit of reading I began filling the 1040 NR EZ form (yes, I am a non resident alien, it was my first time visiting the states) which was pretty easy to fill. However, my computed tax returns are two times less than the estimated tax returns done by the intermediary companies. What could I be doing wrong?  My guess is that I may qualify for  some income tax exemption through the Tax Treaty between the US and Romania (i am romanian) . It can be found here.  Could Article 20 apply for my situation ?  I am leaning towards paragraph (3) from the article:     An individual who is a resident of one of the Contracting States at   the time he becomes temporarily present in the other Contracting State   and who is temporarily present in the other Contracting State for a   period not exceeding 1 year, as a participant in a program sponsored   by the Government of that other Contracting State, for the primary   purpose of training, research, or study, shall be exempt from tax by   that other Contracting State with respect to his income from personal   services in respect of such training, research, or study performed in   that other Contracting State in an aggregate amount not in excess of   10,000 United States dollars or its equivalent in Romanian lei.   My total income was less than 10 000$, however I don't think that the main purpose of the program is to study or research as I did not took part in a J1 student exchange program, but in a J1 summer work &amp; travel program. I could not find any helpful information around the Internet so thought I'd ask you guys.  Thank you for the help. "

As she left Spain before she collected her Article 10 Residence Card ( she has the paperwork with start and expiry date of the card but we left Spain on 21/12, and when we went to the National Police to collect it  on the 20/12, we were told it wouldn't be available until after 28/12).Apparently the Nov 2016 Regs have removed appeal rights if, inter alia, a Residence Card is not held. My contention would be that the actual card is not necessary because it has been approved, simply not collected. However, I suspect the HO will see this as an easy opportunity to refuse her application and deny appeal rights.                       If that is the case, would an administrative review be a way forward or would we be looking at a costly application for Judicial Review? "

323,Non-EU citizen marrying a Romanian (EU citizen) working in the UK,"I would like to ask for your help, advice, input or recommendations about our situation with my fiance. Here are some our questions:  Background:  I am a Filipina working in the Philippines and my boyfriend is Romanian, working in England. Our plan is to get married soon and live together in England.  Questions:   When is the best time to get married, considering the possible changes for EU citizens because of Brexit (UK leaving EU: March 29, 2019)? Where is the best place to get married?   In the Philippines? What kind of visa/permit do I need to join my future husband in England after a civil marriage? England/UK? How can I go there and what are the documents needed for me to be there and get married? Other possible options/place?  What are the possibilities of approval/refusal that I can be with my future husband in the UK? And what are the tips to make this love story successful by way of being together and build a family?   Please we need your thoughts and advices, we know this is real love and we know from the start that this is going to be a rough and long road to take, but we have strong faith and hope. We will appreciate very much your response.  Edit for phoog's answer   Does it means it's better to get married here in the Philippines as soon as possible and immediately process the family permit for me before Brexit? Does the marriage visitor visa (if we want to marry in the UK) cover also other EU citizens (I mean not British)? Because mostly they refer to a British citizen wanting to marry a non-EU fiancee in the UK. How about a non-EU and an EU, non-UK, citizen wanting to marry in the UK? Is it the same visa?  "
324,Medical history for medical examination in London for US visa,"I am in the process for a K1 visa and I have my medical examination at Knigthsbridge Doctors in London in 2 weeks. I have a few doubts:  1. I am from Italy and have lived in the UK for almost 3 years now. I have all the documents necessary for my medical. I recently got from my GP the patient care summary too (that is a new requirement that is not on the UK embassy list). I was wondering whether I need my medical records from Italy too, it's not specified anywhere! (It is specified instead for criminal records)  Question 1 on their questionnaire asks if you've ever been hospitalised and I had to put YES: I got into a car accident in Italy (been in hospital under observation only), had a head trauma with temporary amnesia in Italy and a kidney infection in the UK (due to episode of kidney stones). I explained all these 3 in an attachment to the questionnaire. Do I need to find and take with me all the translated documentation from Italy? (it would be a problem to get them in time)  2. In case I find out only when I'm at the medical that they also need info from my Italian records can they simply access them themselves or do I have to provide them (translated) afterwards therefore causing delays in my visa process?  3. I put NO on the question that asks ""Have you ever had any kidney or liver disease"" as it was only a single episode, nothing chronic. Is that correct?  Thanks  UPDATE: I'm getting some answers to the above also HERE and HERE.  REQUIREMENTS GIVEN BY THE PHYSICIAN IN LONDON (Knightsbridge Doctors):   "
325,"If I am applying for a researcher visa (hosting agreement) in Ireland, could my family apply for family visas at the same time?","I am from Colombia, and I am currently in a recruitment process. I have had 4 interviews and I'm waiting for a formal offer, but it is not clear yet which work permit/visa scheme will be used. As far as I know, if I get a critical skills work permit, my family and I could apply at the same time for visas, so we could travel together. Another option is to apply for a researcher long-stay visa (hosting agreement).  So the first question is: If I am applying for this type of visa for Ireland, could my family apply for family visas at the same time?  Other questions are:   Is the scheme selected by the company? Does it depend on the kind of offer? I mean, the vacancy is ""research fellow"", but I will be working as a software engineer. I would be a paid worker in an academic-industry project. Could I choose which visa to apply for?  "

329,Benefit of registration with Rĳksdienst Niet-Ingezetenen (RNI),"I am a Dutch citizen who has been resident in various countries outside The Netherlands since 2007.  I left the country immediately after completing my Bachelor degree and I have never paid Dutch income tax.  I am registered as a Dutch voter abroad with the Municipality of Den Haag.  I am also registered with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs via Nederland Wereldwĳd.  I recently discovered there is also a Registratie Niet-ingezetenen (RNI), managed by the Rijksdienst voor Identiteitsgegevens (RvIG) which is part of the Ministry of Domestic Affairs.  Unfortunately, the RNI link to registration leads to a nonexisting page.  It is not clear to me whether I am supposed to register with RNI and whether that has any benefit.  Their website says that it is intended for personen in het buitenland die een relatie hebben met de Nederlandse overheid, meaning persons abroad who have a relation with the Dutch government.  I vote in Dutch national elections, but I can already do that.  Am I supposed to register with RNI?  Why would I? "
330,Can I get deported?,"I’m 18 years old, I live in the U.S. I’ve lived here since I was 8 years old and have never left. I lived in Haiti for a few years before I came to live here at 8. I was born in Canada and currently have an expired Canadian passport. I don’t have a social security or license or anything in the US.  I didn't realize it but I’ve been here illegally in a way. Last summer I applied for my N-600 form because my dad was a US citizen 10 years before I was even born, so I was born a citizen and qualified for it. I’m afraid I won’t get approved for the certificate. I didn’t come here on a visa I just came on a Canadian passport, which is now expired. Did I overstay even though I don’t have a visa? Am I here illegally, and can I get deported?  My mother passed away the year I came to live in the U.S. The only form of documentation I’ve ever had is a Canadian passport. Please help me.  To qualify for the N-600 almost all the things you describe I would have to meet and they recently wrote us back asking for two more papers that my father left out(birth certificate and marriage license to my mom which we sent back), they got married months before my birth so I wasn’t born out of wedlock. And my dad lived here since high school going to Haiti maybe once a year and has been a U.S citizen since 1992 which is about 7 years before I was born in Canada. I’m only worried because I don’t have a visa but I guess I never needed one since I’m a citizen I just don’t have the paper to prove it. I assumed I needed the certificate to apply for a U.S passport. And if you’re denied don’t they tell you right away or do you have to wait normal processing times to get an answer? "
331,Building my credit in the USA,"Referring to Philippe Leybaert's answer some time back, he stated not to give out your social security number to companies that request it.  I am applying for a secured credit card and many card companies do require your SSN. What should I do at this stage? Furthermore, before coming across this blog, I did a credit check, and I had to enter my SSN. My credit search was declined, due to not having any credit status in the US. Would this affect my credit rating now? I am a little hesitant to apply for a secured credit card just in case I am refused. Looking forward to anyone's advice. "

333,UK citizen: how do I return to the UK with Kenyan husband and daughter?,"My family and I are British citizens. We moved to Kenya in 2011 for a change of atmosphere and new environment from our busy life in London. A few years on and in 2016, I got married to a Kenyan citizen and at the end of that year, I had a baby girl. My husband was working for an auditing firm but left his job to pursue a better salary.   We are living with his parents and, 10 months on, he still has no job and our savings are at an end. We realised that staying in Kenya is now more difficult than if we were to move to the UK and start life there. My husband would have more scope for better employment and even my daughter would be able to attend a good school.   Now the issue is how do I apply and what do I do? I have no job, no income and neither does my husband. How do we go about our situation and would the UK allow us to immigrate? "

So, I will need to apply for both J1 and F1 before I travel to US for the first time. Is this possible? I am nervous that if I apply for the second one after getting the first, they might cancel the first. So, is it also possible to state that they should not cancel the previous one?  Thanks.  (Note: My country is listed for the 2 year home residency requirement, but I think it would not be effective in this situtation because I will not be chaning status inside US and both visas are nonimmigrant).

336,How can a US company regularly pay an overseas contractor?,"I'm doing independent contract work for a small US company, remotely. I am not a US citizen nor resident, and do not have a US bank account.  The company occasionally pays me sums of a few thousand USD at a time for my work, by bank transfer - from their US bank account (it's a Bank of America account, don't know any more details) to my non-US bank account.  Right now, their bank charges them about 45 USD per transfer, and mine charges me another edit: 20 USD per transfer.  This is in addition to the conversion to local currency: The bank's conversion rate is worse than what I can get from money changers where I live; but if I were to withdraw the USD without conversion, that also incurs a non-negligible fee.  My question: Is there a cheaper, but safe and legal, method for the company to pay me? That is, a method in which, eventually, money in my local currency ends up in my local bank account?  Notes:    I'm located in Israel; but if you have an answer that's more general, that's also relevant. If you need more details to provide an answer, ask for them in a comment.  "

339,Article 10 family card questions,"I have some questions re the above.  1 what is SS? Which is referred to above extensively?  2 Our situation is as follows. My wife has a Moroccan passport and has been in Spain 7 years and is now 1.5 years into a 5 years residency permit. I am British-born husband and we have a 10 month old son born in Spain with UK passport. We wish to apply for a family permit article 10 card. However it’s quite confusing about the criteria and who has to prove what!!  I have been ‘living’ in Spain for the last 2.5 years and have padons and tenancy contracts etc. I have a Spanish bank account but only put small amounts of money in it to pay bills. I have UK bank accounts and am self-employed by a UK company. I actually have been working in Spain and this is the only source of my income. I could argue that I’m self-sufficient in Spain. I also rent a flat in UK which I visit every 2 weeks or see my other son from another marriage etc...  My wife has no money in her Spanish bank account as she lives off mine!! I don’t speak Spanish very well at all!  I have heard that she needs 8k in her account (which can easily be organised) and that I myself (or is it both of us?) need private health insurance in Spain, which again can easily be arranged.  Obviously we want to travel to UK with our baby so he can see his grandparents who are very old and my dad's going blind. I am aware of the spouse visa route but don’t really don’t want to go down that route.  My key questions are that given the above is it likely that we get a family permit? If not what do I need to do (and my wife for that matter) in order to qualify?  How long is it likely to take? "

From above I understand that I do not need to pay in AOK for health insurance since I have higher earnings and I have private international coverage health insurance.  I hear that there is a way to pay approx 50 Euro additionally to AOK, parallel to private one, so I am insured with AOK also while I am in Germany and it will keep me in the system for time when I will be above 55 years old and will be able to be in the system when I will not have this job anymore.

349,"USA-France tax treaty benefits for teachers/researcher: meaning of ""can be claimed only once""","Article 20 of the USA-France tax treaty provides a benefit for teachers and researchers.  When they have been a resident of country A and go to country B to do research, their income from research is only taxable in country A.  (My understanding is that this applies both when A=France and B=USA, or the reverse.)  Quoting paragraph 1:        An individual who is a resident of a Contracting State immediately before his visit to the other Contracting State and who, at the invitation of the Government of that other State or of a university or other recognized educational or research institution situated in that other State, visits that other State for the primary purpose of teaching or engaging in research, or both, at a university or other recognized educational or research institution shall be taxable only in the first- mentioned State on his income from personal services for such teaching or research for a period not exceeding 2 years from the date of his arrival in the other State. An individual shall be entitled to the benefits of this paragraph only once.      ""This benefit can only be claimed once.""  What does this mean?   Can it be claimed once for a period of two full years from the date of arrival? If so, then it would be claimed on up to 3 different tax returns, as this 2 year period typically overlaps with 3 tax years. Or can it be claimed only on a single tax return (i.e. only in one of those three tax years)?   To have a concrete example, suppose a date of arrival of 1 June 2000.  Then can this benefit be claimed for all of Jun 2000 - May 2002?  Or only for one of Jun-Dec 2000, Jan-Dec 2001, or Jan-May 2002?  I am looking for referenced answers.  References can be in English or French, and should clarify this point.  This kind of clause appears in multiple tax treaties, but I have been unable to find a clear explanation of its meaning. "

I do not have any Polish language (or any other EU language) skills whatsoever. English is my second language but am reasonably fluent. I don't mind working at lower level jobs than my current (as long as it's IT). For example, I don't mind work as a team member even if currently I'm in lead roles. My IT skills are good enough but there's nothing that'd stand out in a huge way. I don't have any professional/social network in Poland. I'm willing to move to any city. I have about a month to find a new job.  "
353,Requirements for starting a non-EU national starting business in Poland?,"I've been researching this and so far it seems that all that it takes for a foreigner to start a business in Poland is to register a company (along with the relevant paperwork etc). But that doesn't sound right because in most countries a non-citizen starting a business is expected to provide some mandatory employment and investments.  So, is there a requirement for a business owned by a non-EU national (who does not have a Polish PR but has valid Polish TRP/BlueCard/Visa) in Poland to -   Employ a certain number of polish citizens (or employees in general)? Show a minimum amount of profits? Show that company is even doing some actual work?   Can a non-EU national in Poland on temporary residence permit just start/run a company without hiring anyone else and without showing any profits whatsoever? "
354,Does OCI require pledging loyalty to the Indian Government?,"I'm an Indian American born and raised in America.  My parents are also American citizens now, although they came from India.  Now I am considering applying for Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) status.  There's just one problem: I don't feel any allegiance or loyalty to the Indian government.  (I have lots of love for India itself, but not the current government known as the Republic of India.). So my question is, will I have to pledge loyalty to the Indian government in order to obtain OCI status?  Because I take my promises seriously, and I don't know whether I can take that such an oath in good conscience.  If such an oath is required, is there any alternate status I can obtain without such an oath?  I know that Person of Indian Origin (PIO) status was abolished recently.  But are there any other alternatives if I want to be able to do things like easily owning land and traveling to India without applying for Visas? "

As I have been reading here and on gov.uk, we will need to apply for an EEA Family Permit; I understand that we can both go together or she can join me there, but we haven't decided about this yet.  The thing is that we plan to do this quite soon, and my fiancée already has a UK Visa that she has obtained in order to work there on business trips, and it is still valid for a further 4 months. So my questions are:   Should we apply for the EEA Family Permit anyway if we want to move there together (or for her to join me there) after we get married, but before the work Visa expires? OR Can we move there with her current work Visa and then go apply for a residence card while we are there?   Thank you for any information or insight you might have on this! "

But I have never been to Canada since I got our PR and have not met the Residency Obligation (RO) which is to stay in Canada for 730 days within 5 years.  Based on my question on sister site for travel and Losing your permanent resident status, I am still a PR even though I have not met the RO and can still travel to Canada.  I ask these as I stay close to the border and I may vacation for few days at till my PR expires.  Questions:    Is there a way to know if my PR is invalid as of now (some website etc)? This will be helpful so I can plan my vacation accordingly. If the adjudicator determines that I'm no longer a PR at border / PoE (port of entry), would I immediately know that I'm reported for not fulfilling the RO? Do I lose my PR status immediately or after certain days (if so, how many days)? Is it a bad remark on my profile if I'm reported for not fulfilling the RO? If so, is it better that I myself renounce PR (from US, or at the border)? Would it affect my chances of getting a TRV in future?  "

358,Staying in Brazil as a tourist directly after working visa expires,"I'm Polish, working in Brazil. I live here on working visa issued for 2 years (VITEM V). After my 2 years end I would like to stay in the country for 2-3 months more, just travelling around, not working at all.   Normally as a tourist I would be able to stay here for 90 days in every 180 days period (prolongable in some special cases).  I understand that when my visa expires I have to leave Brazil. But if I come back e.g. a day later, can I stay for full 90 days as a tourist? Or do I need to leave Brazil for some longer period (90 days?) and only then come back? "

361,Can the Registration certificate (QP) replace the residence card application of a non EU married with an EU and holding an EEA FM visa?,"I am a non-EU citizen married to an EU citizen, holding a EEA FP visa for 6 months. As I want to remain here with my spouse, I need to ask for the residence card. My spouse works for an Italian Company with an Italian contract but she works in UK for the Italian company (the contract is Italian not UK). My spouse arrived in UK 6 months ago and I arrived 4 months ago. I called the help phone number for Europeans and what I understood is that if I want to keep my passport, instead of applying for a residence card, I have to apply for a Registration certificate (QP) with my wife online. With this service I can use the return passport service and keep my passport while they are processing the application.   If I do that, do I have to apply also for a Residence Card? Or is the Registration certificate (QP) a kind of residence card?   How long does it take to get the Registration certificate (QP)? If I applied only for the Registration certificate (QP), for how long if this document valid? Can I work in the meantime only having the Registration certificate (QP)?   I am very confused about whether the Registration certificate (QP) for my spouse and me is equivalent to a residence card.   To remain in UK is it enough that we (my EU spouse and I) apply for the Registration certificate (QP) or do I have to apply also for the residence card?   Can you please help me to understand if it is possible to get a residence permit without leaving my passport for 6 months? That is the time the residence card process takes.  It is possible to ask again for the EEA Family permit in Italy? How long do I have to be outside UK to ask again for the EEA Family permit in Italy? Is there any restriction about the number of times you can ask for the EEA FM Visa? "

367,Typical validity period of a J-1 visa,"In many places with information on J-1 I read that the validity period of the J-1 visa may not coincide with the validity of the DS-2019 form that indicates the start and end date of the program; and that status (being allowed to be in the US) differs from visa (being allowed to enter the US).  I could not find any information, though, on how long a J-1 visa is going to be (typically) valid.  Does anyone have some experience here? For example, with a DS-2019 that specifies a program duration of one years, how long will the issued visa be valid? What if the program specifies two years? "

369,Better to be honest about visa run when crossing border? (Chile-Argentina),"Some details/set-up: This past weekend I did a visa run from Chile to Argentina (a weekend in Mendoza) and back. I've done that bus route twice now, as well as flight to Lima and back (as well as extension the first time, but I read those can't be done twice in a row).  Coming back on bus from Mendoza, Chilean immigration hasn't even asked me any questions about how long I'm staying, but some of the other interactions have made me nervous: a bit of a grimace at the airport when responding to how long I'd be staying (""I'd like to stay the full 90 days""); exiting Chile on my way to Mendoza at about day ~87 and the lady giving me a rough time about supposedly going over the 90 days; several questions by two Argentina customs guys when entering this last time (after looking through my passport and seeing all the similar stamps) about why was I going to Mendoza? (""touristing""), I'm living in Argentina, right? (""no""), and why was I living in Chile? (""I'm technically not living there, just there temporarily""), and was I working there? (""no""), etc. One seemed to loosen up when I informed him that my brother and sister-in-law are here in Chile.  Since the last interaction made me nervous I might get in trouble or something, my question is, is it better for me to just be totally honest about the fact that I'm just traveling for the sake of a visa run? Or is it better to try to be coy and ambiguous as I've been doing so far?  I don't know if visa runs are frowned upon here.  FWIW, I'm a gringo (U.S.), I'm not working here, and I sincerely have no designs to stay in Chile long-term, but it's where I'm staying for the moment (the moment being about a year longer than anticipated, but, ya know, life).

371,What are the permit implications of voluntarily leaving a job as a US citizen Blue Card-holder in Germany?,"Here's more detail on my background:  • I'm a US citizen living in Berlin, Germany  • I was issued a Blue Card in November 2015 to work as a 'posted employee' for a US company. The Blue Card is valid until November 2019.   • I am in the German private healthcare system (through Allianz)  • I have a lease on an apartment here in Berlin (not temporary housing--a 'regular' rental contract)  • I have more than sufficient savings in the bank to support myself in Berlin for a year or so (in case immigration authorities would like to see that--not sure if relevant, but I've been told it's something they might ask for)  • As for background: before moving to Berlin, I spent 7 years in San Francisco / Silicon Valley working in product management roles for tech companies.   My current job isn't a good fit for me, and I am going to leave it to search for different job here in Berlin. Ideally, I'd like to take one month off in between jobs to complete an intensive German language course.   My specific question: if I leave my current job before I find a new job in order to take time off and take the language course, will I need to forfeit my Blue Card then 'start from scratch' with regard to getting a work and residence permit? Or will I be able to keep the Blue Card then transfer it to a new company once I find a new job?   I'm trying to determine whether it's worth it to wait to find a new job before leaving my current job so that I can keep my Blue Card.   If handling the situation is complicated, I'll likely end up working with a lawyer, but I am doing some independent research first to see whether hiring a lawyer is necessary.  "
372,Refused UK Visit Visa - now I want to study there,"In February I was denied a UK General Visitor Visa because    I didn't have sufficient funds  I didn't provide a letter of consent from who I would be staying with  I didn't provide enough evidence of ties to my home country (USA)   Before the visa application I had visited my boyfriend a total of 3 times- 5 days, 7 days, and 10 days.   In March I tried to visit my boyfriend after being denied and they held me and interviewed me for a total of 7 hours. I was eventually let in and stayed with him for 5 weeks. I just got back yesterday.  Now I have been accepted to University in London to study psychology. The course starts on October 16th. Will the recent visitor visa refusal affect my application? Will they think I'm not a genuine student?  I have sufficient funds from my parents to pay and I will be staying at the dorms at the university. My goal is to study and be closer to my boyfriend. I am a genuine student who just wants to study and be closer to my s/o.  How are my chances? "
373,Activities in Vancouver for my visiting sister,"I am an expatriate in Vancouver, BC, Canada (PhD candidate at UBC). I would like to invite my little sister to spend a summer (probably in 2016) with me and my wife at Vancouver.   My little sister is a teenager. She's living in Switzerland and she has (almost) never left the country. Her mother tongue is French and she is learning English (and German and Portuguese) at school. In English, she is able to make very simple sentences but is not able to have a conversation. I would like to consider her stay as a good opportunity for her to improve her English.  I can think of thousands of things we can do together during the weekend. The issue is that I will not have plenty of free time during the week to do things with my sister. I am asking for general advice in order to plan my sister's weekday activities.   Could you give me recommendation of activities and several days trips/camps that take place during the weekdays and that she could do without me? Do you know good associations that I should be aware of?  "
374,Is it possible for the spouse of an EU citizen to work in Ireland while the residence permit application is pending?,"I am a spouse of an EU citizen and we are thinking of going to Ireland.  I know if I want to stay there more than three months I have to get the Residence Card For a qualifying family member of a Union citizen, so my questions are the following:    In real life how long aprox does it take to be given. In the page said maximum 6 months,  Do they give a certificate that validates that you are waiting for the residency? If that is the case can yu work with that?.    My real concern is that the residency can take up to six month for the response and that the appliant has to wait for that to be able to work. Is that the case or there are other options? "

376,Dates for F-1 visa: Offer letter does not match I-20,"I'll be joining a fully funded graduate program in the US next fall. However, I had planned to go early (mid June) to do research in the summer for a couple of months. I also received an official offer letter (with guarantee of summer funding) with June 16 as the start date.  So I applied for an F-1 visa with the following dates   Coming to the US: 18 June 2016 (acc. to my flight) Leaving the US: 15 August 2021   The leaving date field could not be left blank so I took a period of 5 years (typical PhD completion time at the institution is 5~6 years). My passport expires in October 2021.  However, I just received the I-20 sometime back and the program start date on it is given as 1 August 2016 and the program end date is 1 August 2022.  Will I need an updated I-20 to obtain a visa starting 18 June or is the offer letter + current I-20 sufficient?  Also, can the passport expiration date be an issue? I was planning to renew my passport while re-visiting my home country (India) after 2-3 years. "
377,Overstaying residence visa(work permit issued by UDI) in Norway by 1 day(5-6 hrs actually),"I have been granted Trainee Work permit by UDI(Norwegian Directorate of Immigration). I applied for visa up till 11th July as my Employment Contract ends on 10th July. As for Norway, you get a temporary visa first, where end date of the permit is not mentioned so I didn't know that UDI has actually given me visa up until 10th July (as this date was mentioned in my employment contract). I booked return flight back home in the morning of 11th July.  I still have to go to police station to get residence card which would actually have VALID TILL written on it.  Ques 1. Can I tell police this problem and they might add another day to my permit end date? Do they have power? Or is there any other legal solution?  Ques 2. If nothing happens and I reach the airport on 10th July before midnight and talk to immigration office about my problem, would he/she allow me to check-in without any penalty as I would be able to check-in only after flight counter has opened and my luggage is checked-in?

378,How to get a secured credit card in USA as foreigner?,"I am thinking to move to USA and understand that i would ideally need a good credit history to get  a decent mortgage loan. There are some answers regarding getting a ""Secured Credit Card"". Can i know how this work because this is the first time i heard of it. Does it work like a debit card where i spend only the money that i have put in the bank?   There was a previous posting, a few years ago, on a specific bank to use for this purpose, is that advice still valid? or can i use Bank of America for the above purpose?  I do not currently hold any American Express cards therefore cannot leverage on the possibility of backdating the credit history as proposed in some of the answers.   Lastly, is 6 months still the period required for a good credit history buildup before i can apply for mortgage loan?  Thank you very much "
379,Carte de séjour in France if I already have a long-stay visa--what's the point?,"According to OFII and other resources I've run across, I'm required after entering France to apply for a carte de séjour as well.  This isn't a question about how to do that--I've already begun the process.  I'm just wondering what it does for me or why it's required.  As I understand it, a titre de séjour in general is any document that gives me the right to live and work in France, and my long-stay visa (for research) already serves that purpose.  My long-stay visa is valid for a year, but should be possible to renew.  However, I am planning on staying in France for longer than a year (indefinitely even). If I have a carte de séjour  will I also need to renew my visa, or will it take the place of my visa as my official permit to live and work in France (I understand I will still need to renew my carte de séjour  as well, but if I need a visa in addition to it what even is the point??)  Update: This update is a little off-topic from my original question, but I wanted to add a brief update on my visit to the OFII office for my visa de long séjour dispensant de titre de séjour (known as ""VLS/TS""), since it might be helpful/interesting to anyone who runs across this.  My nearest OFII office is in Créteil, so your mileage may vary at different offices.  I was given an appointment to be there at 1:00 P.M. sharp, but upon arriving there was already a long line at the door, and the office itself did not open until 1:00.  After the doors opened they started letting people near the front in one at a time, but there was a huge crunch around the door and the line became more of a morass.  I was toward the back and couldn't really understand what was going on, nor hear what the sole OFII employee standing at the door was saying.  Eventually, about half an hour later, I was close enough to hear to him call out if anyone had a rendez-vous.  I shouted that I did and waved my appointment paper around.  He waved me over and I had to literally shove my way through the crowd to get up to the door (some people helped by pushing me from behind).  The man let me through, and sent me right up to the front desk.  They looked at my paper and had the gall to ask me why I was late.  I told them, in my limited French, that I was there since 12:50 and was just in the back of the line and was trying to be polite.  It was not clear that because I had a written appointment I could skip the line (for all I knew all those people had appointments too).  But they honored my appointment, and though I had to wait a little longer everything else went smoothly, and all the staff on the second floor were very friendly and helpful.  I did not have to have a medical checkup.  I'm not sure why not--maybe a privilege of being an American--they reviewed my paperwork which was all correct, and put the sticker in my passport.  The sticker is largely redundant with the VLS, but as others have pointed out the VLS is relatively new, so the procedures may not be fully sync'd up yet.  It is also slightly different insofar as it has my permanent address in France on it, as well as a personal registration number particular to OFII, which I assume will be used to track my future applications.  They told me that when my VLS expires I can get this renewed in the form of a proper carte de séjour.  For anyone curious, the sticker looks like this:    They just pasted it on the page of my passport after the page my visa is on (kind of a waste of a page IMO but oh well). "
380,Working as a freelancer in France,"I am an EU citizen (not French) currently living in France and working for a French employer.  I do not need or have a work permit or residence card to do this.  My non-EU-citizen spouse (who needs a visa) is staying with me.  In this situation, could I work as a freelancer in the future, staying in France, but doing work for clients who are abroad?  Would I need any special permission from the French government to do this?  If yes, could you give me a few general pointers on where I can learn more about this, preferably in English?  Will it be a severe hindrance that I do not speak French?  If I were to do this, would it impact the residence permit of my spouse? When applying for this residence permit, it was not sufficient to prove that I am an EU citizen.  I also needed to show that I have a paying job.  Will this be a problem if I switch to freelancing?  Will it be a problem if there is a period of a couple of months during which I am unemployed, especially if this coincides with the time when my spouse's residence permit needs to be renewed? "
381,E2 (treaty investor) US visa and crowdfunding money as an investment,"Will it be possible for startup founders, crowdfunded by e.g. Kickstarter, to apply for e-2 (e2) treaty investor US visa (given that owners have citizenship of a treaty country, and they have 50% of business each)?  For example, we are a small hardware startup, we have successfully finished kickstarter compaign and we have received money on our business account in US. We have LLC where both of us have equal shares. We also have a business plan and financial plan where to spend those money. We also have some obligations to ""backers"" to produce and send them a product. Can those money be treated as an investment, so we could apply for e-2 visa to continue develping project in US?  This is what state.org site says:   The investment must be substantial, with investment funds or assets committed and irrevocable. It must be sufficient to ensure the successful operation of the enterprise. The investment must be a real operating enterprise, an active commercial or entrepreneurial undertaking. A paper organization, speculative or idle investment does not qualify. Uncommitted funds in a bank account or similar security are not considered an investment. It must generate significantly more income than just to provide a living to you and family, or it must have a significant economic impact in the United States. You must have control of the funds, and the investment must be at risk in the commercial sense. Loans secured with the assets of the investment enterprise are not allowed. You must be coming to the United States to develop and direct the enterprise. If you are not the principal investor, you must be considered an essential employee, employed in a supervisory, executive, or highly specialized skill capacity.  Ordinary skilled and unskilled workers do not qualify.   And this is what Kickstarter says:   In general, in the US, funds raised on Kickstarter are considered income. In general, a creator can offset the income from their Kickstarter project with deductible expenses that are related to the project and accounted for in the same tax year. Beyond deductions, a creator may be able to classify certain funds raised on Kickstarter as a nontaxable gift, and not income. A gift is something given out of “detached and disinterested generosity” for personal reasons and without the expectation of getting something in return.  "

383,Is it feasible (for a westerner) to live in Johor Baharu (Malaysia) while working in Singapore?,"I had this opportunity to work for a company in Singapore but I am not sure yet if I will accept it.  I was looking on a map how Singapore looks like and it is of course quite small. So the question came to mind whether it would be practical, safe, or otherwise feasible to live in Johor Baharu (Malaysia) while working in Singapore?  Does the border crossing between the two countries take a long time? Are there any options for faster processing at the border (like the U.S. Global Entry Program)?  The office would be somewhere near the Dhoby Ghaut MRT station. I would not have my own a car as I am not sure I want to go into debt (in case the job does not last, etc). "
384,Can We Move To France Although We Don't Live In The EU?,"I'm a retired UK citizen with an EU passport. My wife, also retired, is an American citizen. We've been living in America for the past twelve years, myself as a 'permanent resident'. We wish to spend our retirement in France. We have a good income and would sell our house in America to fund a property in France. My question is: if we buy a property can we just move there, or are there certain procedures to be gone through. Also, could we utilize France's healthcare system or would we need private health insurance? If the latter, any idea of cost?  Looking at your ""EEA Family Permit"" link it seems to require that my wife has a British Residency permit. She has never lived in the UK. I met her in America.  I lived in the UK for fifty-four years and worked there continuously until moving to America in 2002. I have a government pension from the UK, and my wife also receives one from the UK on my contributions. "
385,Health insurance for Germans living in another EU country temporarily,"My partner is a German citizen working in Germany. She will quit her job and come to join me in France soon, initially for a period of a few months (but she may stay longer depending on how things develop). We want to know what the best health insurance options are. My sense is that it would be cheapest to have German health insurance. My questions are:   Can she apply for German health insurance for unemployed people as soon as she has quit? What is the rough cost of this? Can she maintain that insurance if she is in another E.U. country (what conditions does she need to meet to maintain it, e.g. does she need to be looking for a job?) In case anyone knows, what are her rights to access French insurance schemes?  "
386,Housing in Amsterdam,"This question is about semi-permanent housing in Amsterdam (no hotels, hostels, guest rooms, etc).   What are the local resources for finding housing in Amsterdam?

Which are the cheapest options and how are they browsable and/or reachable (same as #1 but with a price criterion)? How can one browse housing in a specific area?  "
387,"Is a Canadian IEC work permit limited by passport expiration date, and if so can it be extended later?","I am from Ireland. My application for a Canadian working holiday visa has been accepted (through the IEC programme, I have my Port of Entry letter, and when I arrive I should get a work permit). It is a 2 year visa, and I want to stay for the full 2 years.  I plan to go to Canada in March 2015, but my Irish passport expires in May 2016.  If I arrive in Canada with this passport, will I only be able to get a work permit up until May 2016? This would limit my 2 year visa to 14 months.  If it is limited by my passport expiring, can I extend this afterwards so that I can stay for the full 2 years? (assuming I can renew my passport while I am in Canada) "
388,What do I need to get a driver's license in France?,"This is related to my previous question.  Assume the following (for the moment hypothetical) situation:   I do not have any valid driver's license at the moment, but I do know how to drive I just moved to France, and I am a non-French EU citizen I do not speak French   What would I need to be able to get a driver's license?  How long will it take?  How much will it cost?  Are lessons mandatory or can I go directly for the test?  I believe it is possible to take a test in English, though likely there are difficulties in arranging this.  EDIT: I'd like to clarify that getting an (international) driver's license in any other country is not an option at this moment.   "
389,Do I have to wait for ITIN to file California taxes for H4 spouse?,"I am holding a H1B visa and my wife just moved to California as H4 dependent. I have applied for ITIN along with filing my federal taxes.  How do I file my California State tax? Should I wait for her ITIN and then file my CA taxes or can I file my CA taxes without her ITIN? I was told by the IRS officer that it would take 8 weeks to get the ITIN. In that case, should I file for an extension for filing my California taxes ?  EDIT: Found that I do not have to file an extension for CA state taxes. If we can't file by April 15, we have an automatic six-month extension to file our return until October 15.   This is what I found in the instructions book of from 540. It does not say anything when one doesn't have an ITIN.     If you do not have an SSN because you are a nonresident or resident   alien for federal tax purposes, and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)   issued you an ITIN, enter the ITIN in the space for the SSN. An ITIN   is a tax processing number issued by the IRS to foreign nationals and   others who have a federal tax filing requirement and do not qualify   for an SSN. It is a nine-digit number that always starts with the   number 9   So the questions is, should I wait for ITIN to file my state tax returns.  "

395,"EEA citizen question about ""Settled Status"" in UK after Brexit. Particularly the 5 years continuous residence requirement","I am an EEA citizen, and have lived in the UK for 22 years. First came in 1995 and started studying and then started working full-time (I was also working part-time during studies). I worked full-time continuously from about 2003 until beginning of November 2016. I left the country shortly after at the end of January 2017. I've been away for less than 2 years as we speak. If I return now before the end of January 2019, will I be able to apply for (full) settled status (not pre-settled status)? What I have a problem understanding is the following: Since in order to get settled status will require 5 years continuous residence in the country, does this mean 5 years continuous residence from the proposed cut-off date (31st December 2020) going backwards? Or does my previous residence in the UK and the fact that I've away for less than 2 years satisfy this requirement?  Reason why I am asking is that with regards to permanent residence for EEA nationals, when you have acquired it, you only lose it if you are away from the UK for more than 2 years. Do the requirements for settled status work differently?  Many thanks to anyone who might be able to provide me with an answer or insight into this...as I am really confused. "

397,UK Visa for Plab 2 Financial consideration: Regular Deposits from a Sibling,"I’d like to appreciate the help provided by this forum.  I’ll be applying for a visa to take the plab 2 exam and I’m not quite sure about whether or not my financial situation poses any “refusal” risks. My major concern is this: the main source of income for me is our family farm (poultry) which I run with my sister. She transfers revenue monthly to me because she handles sales and lives at home. I also work privately as a doctor, (only night calls) and earn significantly lower than I do from the farm.  Will the fact that it’s not a registered business but a farm adversely affect my situation?  I intend to get a letter from my sister explaining the transactions, an affidavit and  a picture of the farm. Is this necessary?  "

I've got the DS2019 and all documents, but my parents are diplomats (foreign service) currently posted in the US. Could this be a problem?   I don't intend to settle in the US because I have to come back and finish my degree, is this enough proof to not be considered in 214(b)?   I'm just worried my parents will be a problem even though they are diplomat officials who will leave the US in 2021. "
399,Swedish citizenship application - what happens if you stayed in another Nordic country ”in between”?,"I’ve applied for swedish citizenship some 26 months ago and no decision as of yet.  I moved to Sweden in 2009, studied &amp; worked until autumn 2013, then moved to Denmark for work until 2015.

Few weeks earlier my case officer contacted me asking about Denmark &amp; requested to send “evidence” about my work in Denmark. Sent it and no words or decision yet.   Questions are:   Is my citizenship application invalid since I was in Denmark in between years? Does it have ANY impact on my PR permit (e.g. revoked)? Should I just be more patient?  "

405,Overstaying visa waiver while waiting for residency permit in Belgium?,"I'm an Australian citizen who entered Belgium under Schengen Visa waiver program and applied for residency permit (autorisation de séjour) to study here for a year. However, application processing is taking longer than expected and now my 90 days come to an end.  My understanding is, the proper thing to do in this situation is to leave and abandon my application. To my best knowledge, having a pending application with the foreigners office (Bureau des Étrangers) does not in itself allow me to stay.  Are there any other legal options? Has someone been in this situation before? (In Belgium or perhaps a different Schengen country) My current plan is to wait for a response and, if it's negative, leave and take the consequences of overstaying. (I'm hoping this doesn't lower a chance of positive response)  Thanks for your help! "

410,Traveling to Mexico while in the U.S. with H4 Visa and returning using Automatic Visa Revalidation,"My Wife is here on a H4 Visa, I have a H-1B Visa, we are both Mexican citizens, I have a current stamped H1-B Visa valid till the end of this month(by the time Wife returns my own Visa will be expired if that is relevant), and my Wife has a expired H4 Visa. We both have I-797 with attached i-94s Valid until January 2019. None of the Visas in our passport are with my current employer, but of course our i-797s are with my current employer.  I have asked my company lawyers about this, and researched everywhere online, including the USCIS website, and can't find a good answer. I also have a PERM that was filed a couple weeks ago. As far as I know the PERM has no impact whatsoever on this, but wanted to mention it just in case. I have obtained a proper current employment verification letter for them, and I also have a full copy of my H-1B Visa petition.  We used to have TN Visa, and until then almost every single time we went out of the U.S. we would get a new Visa, because as Mexican citizens we can only get a Visa (either TN or H-1B) valid for up to 1 year because of the reciprocity agreement with Mexico. We learned about this relative new thing called Automatic Visa Revalidation, no lawyer had ever mention this to us, but I have done my research and asked around and I know for a fact it is a real thing.  My Wife intends to travel to Mexico for a period of 28 days, just within the 30 days max for the Automatic Visa Revalidation, however and this is the part that is extremely unclear to me is, if she leaves the U.S. by land (car), how can she prove that she only left for a period of 28 days?. I know with a flight ticket this would be easier, as there is proof of when she left the U.S., but what about leaving by land?, how can she prove that she qualifies for Automatic Visa Revalidation, because she has an expired H4 from my old employer and a current i-797 from my current employer?.  The only thing I could find, is that you could stop in the border before crossing to Mexico and let them know that you are exiting and plan to return using AVR, I read this on some U.S. university website, I really don't think this is a real thing, there is no line or queue with a officer in the border where you could do such a thing as far as I know.  What should we do?. "

As I can do my job from anywhere in the world so long as I have a good internet connection, I'm investigating moving to the Netherlands while remaining in my current job.

419,Status of emotional abuse laws in Japan,"I am currently living in Japan as a student. I have been working with a program that has advisors that are great 95% of the time, but this advisor has the power to tell me at anytime that I have to buy a plane ticket and return home, if for example I break any of the program's rules. (For example, I am not allowed to drive for insurance reasons.) In my case my advisor has a temper that will rise up out of nowhere over things that would have not ever been an issue before. (I have to write a report every month for my program, and it always has been typed two pages. Last month I was yelled at twice for 10 to 20 minutes at a time because it was typed. So this month I hand wrote it and it was still two pages and he proceeded to yell that it needed to be one page for 20 minutes. This was never addressed before in any manner. Each time he yelled until I was able to escape to the woman's restroom.)  What are the laws for emotional abused in Japan regarding students and people who have power over their actions? At this point I am afraid to walk around my campus for fear of running into him. Is there any part of Japanese laws that can help me stand up to him with out the fear that he will demand my return home?  Sorry if this is long and confusing but I am begging you for help I am terrified of him, and the repercussions from standing up to him. Thank you. "

422,Does participating in U.S. Diversity Lottery decrease my chances of getting F-1 visa?,"I took place in two U.S. D.V. lotteries -- one ended up in the previous year and I wasn't selected to get an interview and another one is currently processing with the results expected in May. At the same time I received an admission offer from U.S. university and going to enroll in its Ph.D. program in STEM field starting from this fall.  My question is may the fact that I just took part in D.V. lottery seriously affects my chances of getting F-1 visa? I have read (mostly on Quora) that, on the one hand, since D.V. lottery is an immigration visa lottery it may be considered as an immigration intent which does not coincide with getting a non-immigrant visa like F-1, but, on the other hand, somebody wrote that it becomes an immigration intent only after you was selected and accepted an interview, before this point it doesn't matter.  Should I mention in any form that I previously tried to enroll in D.V. lottery if I wasn't selected? Can my local embassy somehow check that I am currently in the lottery or participated in it before?  Please remark that my current goal is to obtain F-1 student visa, not continue trying to get green card if it will affect my F-1 status. "
423,How can I emigrate to the US without a college degree?,"I'm 19, I have Italian citizenship and working in Germany as a web developer. My dream has been to move to the US since I was 12. I won't say much about why it's like that because it would be a long paragraph, but you have to trust me.  I never liked the school system and always felt sad in school, that's why I'm excluding getting a bachelor's degree as an option, although I know that the easiest way would be to get an American job contract and apply for the H-1B visa.  I don't think I'd be able to get married with a US citizen, honestly, so that's another option I'd exclude.  Now I'd like to consider every possible way to get to live there. I registered for the DV lottery this year and I'm hoping for that. Is there any other visa that could help me? Would it be even possible to emigrate to Canada/Australia and be able to emigrate to the US more easily after getting the passport in one of those countries? (or even any other country that could get me to the US) "
424,Germany Residence Permit away for many days,"I have a residence permit of Germany. I want to work in another country but maintain my residence in Germany. Is it possible that I visit Germany twice a year to maintain my permit? Visiting Germany every 179 days makes the Residence Permit invalid? Or it must be that I stay in Germany for a total of 180 days in a year to maintain my residence permit(limited: Aufenthaltstitel, purpose: study)?  For example I stay out of Germany (as well as EU) for 170 days. Stay in Germany for the next 20 days then again out for 170 days and then come back. In this case the Permit gets invalid or not?  "

As an aside, I know all the upper management people in the company, have worked with them in the past, I'm not worried about them scamming me....but I'm not sure how some of this works. I have a few questions:   How backwards is it if they only want to pay me in US dollar? At one point my contact told me I could be paid in a combination of USD and Euro, the thought being I could put the USD into my savings, and use the Euro to live off. Is this type of arrangement legal? Does it even make sense? We're talking about a job that's prob $150,000 USD/year. As a US employee I would be given US insurance, and they would supplement it with international insurance. Does anyone have experience with such insurance? What else am I not worrying about?  "

428,Health care reimbursements from CPAM,"I have been registered with CPAM for more than a year now and haven't used the doctor much, but when I have I'm very confused about how much I can expect to be reimbursed or how I can even know.  Most resources I see, for example, claim that most doctor visits are covered ""about"" 70%.  But for my last consultation I paid 25€ up front, and was reimbursed 14€ (less than 60%).  I also saw a specialist for some imaging and paid 72€ out of pocket. I was then reimbursed 38.69€ which is only 54%.    Update: So I found my account statement on the ameli.fr site, and for the imaging it broke things down like:  Montant payé: €72.00 Base de remboursement: €56.70 Taux: 70% Participation forfaitaire: (€1.00)   So they reimbursed me 70% of 56.70, and also deducted a 1 euro ""participation forfaitaire"".  How would I know what the ""base de remboursement"" is as opposed to the amount I actually paid up front?  What's the ""participation forfaitaire""?  I ask in particular because I'm shopping around for mutuelle, but I don't even understand my existing coverage. "

I got my EAD/AP approved in Feb 7, and received in 14 Feb (C09 category).   I talked to the law firm, and they said it is their common practice not to withdraw the I-140.  Now what is the next mile-stone? With the current queue, when should I expect to receive my GC? Now that I don't have a job, does it affect my GC (how uscis knows I don't have a job?!) "
431,How will late I-983 affect H1-B?,"Recently DHS passed certain ""compliance regulations"" for the STEM OPT extension which require students to report a change of employer within 10 days while a student is on STEM OPT. I submitted it almost after two and  a half months. My employer took a long time to generate I-983 (I informed a month late).  [website]Since I am ""not in compliance"" with STEM OPT reporting requirements, what is the worst that could happen?  Now, my employer is filing for work visa. There are two options for filing the work visa: change of status and consular processing [website]Which one should I go for to ensure maximum chances of approval?  I have also lost both my EAD cards: new and old. What would be the best time to apply for new ones?  Before H1-B application (right now) or after it? I have a scanned copy, though, and have sent it with the current H1B application. For the old EAD card, the employer was concerned that the scan is out of margin a bit, and asked for the approval letter which I was unable to find. What is the best that I should do about this? "

My wife was on a student visa and my son, born in tje UK (he is 5 years old now) was her dependent. I changed both my wife's and son's status to Tier 2 dependent about two year ago. Can I apply for my son's UK passport? I still have a Tier 2 visa until 2019. Can I only apply for ILR and leave my wife as a Tier 2 dependent?  If not, can I apply for ILR dependent after getting my ILR status? "
435,Nanny entering on a former B1/B2 visa,We are US citizens that typically reside overseas.  We are back in the USA for 9 months and would like to bring our current nanny with us to the USA.  She has a 10 year B1/B2 visa that she obtained 8 years ago from a previous employer.  Will she have any issues entering the USA on a B1 visa to be our nanny?  What documents should she provide? 
436,Applying for US H1B work visa with passport expiring in 4 months. Applicant already in the US,This question isn't about flying/travelling with an expiring passport but about applying for a H1B visa when the applicant's passport has only 4 more months of validity. Will this cause a problem?  The applicant is already in the US with a Master's degree from a US University and a sponsor all lined up. Unfortunately we've realized this problem with the expiration a little too close to the April 1 visa application deadline to get the passport renewed in time. We are already doing all we can to get the passport renewed but it's not likely to happen by April 1 so what's the best line of action here? The applicant is Nigerian. 
437,How does my friend obtain US citizenship for his foreign born son?,I have a US citizen friend who married a non-USA citizen woman in a foreign country a few years ago. 5 months and 9 days after their marriage a foreign born little boy was born in a hospital in the same foreign country.   So obviously the child was born within wedlock with 5 months and 9 days to spare.   How does my friend go about obtaining US citizenship for his son without having to submit to a DNA test because of the 5 months and 9 days born after marriage situation? Is this possible? It seems like based on these circumstances and based on [website]Does this mean the child cannot become a US citizen? 
438,How much US taxes do you have to pay after selling a foreign property if you are a US green card holder?,What portion of the sale of a property outside the US will you need to pay taxes on? Will you be paying taxes on the total sale price or only on the gain? 
439,H1B Green Card (Permanent Residency) Process with Employer Change,"Consider the situation:   A person arrives to the US as an H1B holder Works for the employer that sponsored the visa for some time and employer does labor certification and other paperwork for US Green Card (Permanent Residency) Due to some factors the employee loses that job, but has been able to find another that will sponsor him for the H1.   But here is the problem: What will happen to the application for an adjustment of status to Permanent Resident?  Can it continue with the new employer or will this have to be restarted from the beginning? "
440,How to change employers on a H-1B visa in the United States,For a person in the US under an H-1B visa - if this person needs to change jobs:   What's the procedure that needs to be followed since the H-1 is sponsored by the employer? Can the visa and stay be continued or it is basically a new visa?  
441,Is it possible to find an apartment for rent in Germany before coming there and looking for a job/contract?,"When I first went to Germany for work, I was shocked by the problems I encountered with finding an apartment. My company found me a temporary accommodation before I arrived (a single room in a cellar, in so-called ""Wohnen auf Zeit"") but that company required a job contract to be faxed!  When I've searched for normal apartments, everyone wanted to see me personally and additionally asked about my job contract.  If I wanted to go to Germany to look for a contract or job, would it be possible at all to find some apartment before I get there? It seems unlikely since I wouldn't have any job/contract in advance, and I couldn't be there personally.  I expected it would be possible to simply find something on the internet, correspond with the owner/renter, negotiate the price, and pay by bank transfer, no problem. But maybe I was expecting too much...? "
442,Can EU citizens participate in European Parliament elections when living outside the EU?,As a EU citizen living outside the EU.  Can I participate in elections for the European Parliament?  Does it depend on my country of citizenship?  My citizenship is Dutch. 
443,Are there any elections I can take part in while a temporary resident in Canada?,"Inside the EU, EU residents can vote in local and European-level (and possibly regional) elections for the EU country where they live.  I'm a Dutch citizen living temporarily in Canada.  Are there any elections I can take part in?  If Perhaps local ones?  Or none at all? "
444,"If no spousal visas are involved, what are the needs for registering a marriage with foreign authorities?","If a married couple are living separated in two different countries, which is neither the country where either person has citizenship, nor the country where they got married, would there be any benefit of registring a marriage in their countries of residency and/or their countries of citizenship?  Specifically, if a Dutch and a French person got married in Sweden, and now work on independent visas in Canada and the USA, should they register their marriage anywhere beyond Sweden?  What would be the benefit in doing so? "
445,"As an EU national just moved to France, how do I get a ""Attestation d'accueil"" for a friend's visa?","I'd previously said to an Indian friend that they ought to come over and stay with me in the summer. At the time, I'd thought I'd be in the UK, and I'm fairly happy about how to go about helping them get a UK visa. Now it looks like I'll have just moved to France, so they'll need to get a Schengen visa instead.  Looking at the France Diplomatie site on this (English version), I gather I'll need to get something called a ""Attestation d' Accueil"" for my friend confirming that they'll be staying with me.  From an earlier question, I gather “carte de séjour” is not required for EU citizens. So, I won't have one of those. As an EU national recently moved to France, I probably won't have a great deal in the way of French paperwork.  In that situation, how would I go about getting a ""Attestation d' Accueil""? Especially what will I need to get for myself first, and how would I do that? Related, will the process for applying for one once I have the right documentation be the same as for a local, or will it differ as an EU national? "
446,How long can you live+drive in France before you have to change your EU driving license?,"If you move to France, and hold a driving license from another EU country, how long can you drive in France on your existing license?  Related - when that time is up, what is the process you then have to follow to change it into a French one, and what documentation will you need to have gotten together by that point in order to be able to do so? "
447,How long can I drive a EU registered car in France for?,"What are the rules around how long you can spend driving in France with a car that is registered elsewhere in the EU, before you have to go about taxing/registering/etc it?  And does it make any difference if your car is right hand drive, rather than a left hand drive one that you'd normally have in France? "
448,What restrictions exist for a KITAS Holder in Indonesia starting a business?,I am a KITAS holder sponsored by my wife.  I want to start a business in Indonesia.  What are the primary restrictions I am going to run up against?  What sort of processes do I need to do to get around those? 
449,Can I trade in a left hand drive car in the UK?,"We will be moving soon to the UK. We currently have two lhd cars that we intend to replace with a rhd one as soon as possible.  I thought that I could pack a lot of stuff in one of our current cars, drive it to the UK and use it as initial payment for a new one. I know I will loose money this way, but it would save me a lot of trouble, and would somewhat compensate by saving the shipment cost of my stuff.   Now, is it possible to do something like that? Would a dealership in the UK accept my lhd car?  "
450,Do I need any German work or residence permits for a German company to hire me to work in France?,"I am a citizen and resident of India. I work as an independent software consultant. One of my customers is a company based in Germany. This German company has a client in Paris, France. The German company wants me to work at their client's Paris office for 1 year. It is a fixed term contract, and will end after 1 year.  It is clear that independent consultants cannot obtain work permits in France, unless they are setting up their own business in France with considerable investment. So I would be offered employment by the German company. The Germany company doesn't have any office or subsidiary in France.  I know for sure that I will need a French work permit. But will I also need German work and residence permits? Or will it be enough if I get the French work permit, and the German company hires me?  Also, which countries will tax my salary? I will receive my salary from the German company directly into my bank accounts in India. Will I have to pay any tax in France? "
451,Extreme commuting project in Switzerland by train,"I will soon accept a job offer in Geneva downtown, and I am living in Valais canton in Switzerland.  In my current field of expertise, there is no opportunity in the area; it looks like everything is located in Geneva; a little less in Lausanne. I ended up with an opportunity in downtown Geneva.  Relocating is not something I would enjoy in that city; neither to settle on the French side and commute cross-border.  The option I am considering for some time is to make an extreme commute of 2 hours each way, by train.  I live within 5 minutes by foot from a station served by Regio trains, which is 3 stops away from Martigny where I catch the InterRegio to Geneva.  There are different options for this case :   Take the local train then transfer in Martigny Drive to Martigny (15 min), park there then take the long-distance train Drive to Sion the other way (15 min), park there then take the long-distance train, and be able to catch the EuroCity trains that are quicker but do not stop at Martigny.   Which from the above would be the most time-effective?  Also, would be upgrading the pass to a first class one a good investment? In the 1st class cars of these trains, the seats are actually wider but there are no tables to work on. "
452,Best way of new grad getting sponsored for Australian Work Visa,"I am in the last stages of obtaining my Masters of Science, am young (24), and have been looking at options of getting my first job abroad, specifically Australia has always been that destination for me. Looking at Australia's immigration site, I feel that being sponsored gives you a much better shot applying for a visa. I am lost at where to start looking for jobs that would fit for me and contact the management to talk about sponsorship. My background is a Masters in Computer Engineering and general electronics.  For now I have set up a account on seek.com.au and browsed a few jobs relating to my field. I have also done general searching on google for mainstream Australian media to expose myself to news and potentially find companies that way. I found in another question a reference to spotjobs.com.  Besides for companies that are global and I know exist (Google, Rolls Royce,etc.) are there any sites that advertise tech startups looking for workers or prominent tech companies in Australia?   This could also be considered a chicken and the egg problem. Employers look for people eligible to already live/work in Australia/have Australian citizenship, but I am in the process of applying after I get sponsored and talking to the companies.  EDIT: Latest developments are that though I have found some jobs an almost perfect fit in my field, they are in defence and require Australian citizenship. Anyone have any success stories for getting a job in non-security clearance, kind of work as an expat? "
453,Canadian pension plan savings withdrawal upon leaving,"I found a post on this forum that talked about Canadian pension funds being ""withdrawable""  See answer here :  What happens to my saved Canadian pension funds when my SIN expires?  I've been in Canada for over 4 years now. Arrived in 2010 and have worked here with work visa until now (not got residence or applied for it) - so SIN is the temporary one  We've taken the decision to leave Canada for good this year. My question is if it is in fact possible to withdraw the pension deposits I've made in the time I worked here, how do I go about doing this? Who am I supposed to contact? "
454,Does switching from a J1 visa to TD status prevent you from entering the US for two years?,"I am currently living in the US on a TN status while my financé is still living in Canada. We are both Canadian citizens. She is looking at taking an internship in the US that would grant her a J-1 visa. But looking into it, it looks like after the J-1 visa expires she is required to leave the US and not return for two years.  Is this really the case for Canadian citizens? When she gets a TD status, will she still be required to remain outside the US until that two-year period has passed? "
455,"How can a US citizen demonstrate their marital status, to be able to marry in Cape Verde?","I'm a US citizen, trying to marry a Cape Verdean citizen in Cape Verde. At the government registry office, they tell me that I must give them a ""Certificado de Capacidade Matrimonial"" that certifies that I am eligible to marry (i.e., not currently  married). This is supposed to come from my country, the US.  However, my embassy tells me that there is no such document that they can give me. The State Department says,     No such government-issued document exists in the United States.   I went back to the registry office, and told them that, because I'm from the US, this is not a document that could ever exist. When I asked them what I should do, I was helpfully told to go get the marriage eligibility certificate and bring it to them. The one that can't exist.  What can I do? Are US citizens not allowed to marry in Cape Verde? "
456,"The registry in Cape Verde wants to keep an ""original"" of my foreign birth certificate. Must I purchase a new one each time?","The Cape Verdean registry office is asking me for an ""original"" of my birth certificate, for more than one process. As a US citizen, this is a fairly expensive document to get! (It would currently cost $45 each for me, not including shipping costs, from VitalCheck.) Is there some way around this requirement, other than ordering and paying for multiple birth certificates to be shipped from the US? Is it worth it to plead with the workers to give me the certificate back afterwards, so I can use it in another process (or just keep it for myself)? "
457,How Much Income Tax Will We Pay In France?,"Can anyone help me with French income tax? My wife and I are retired (both over 65). I'm a UK citizen living with my wife in the USA. She has never lived in the UK. We are planning a move to Brittany, France. We have no dependants.  Our annual gross income is 61,700 euros at present exchange rates (my wife's contribution is 42,700 euros. Mine is 20,000 euros). We will have no mortgage payments. How much income tax will we pay on that sum (I'm only interested in income tax, plus other annual taxes i.e. social security? but not property taxes) "
458,Working as contractor in Australia as foreign citizen (EU),"I'm an EU-Citizen and I'd like to consider opportunity of working in Australia as IT-specialist (developer).  If I find an opportunity to work there as contractor/freelancer, can I simply register my company there? Or there are special requirements to be met? How do I apply for visa in that case?  As far as I know, Australia grants visa to computer specialists without any problem, because they are needed there, if they want to be employed there. Do the same applies to contractors? "
459,Where would US immigration deport a person who has only a US citizenship but lied in citizenship application?,"This is related to the recent case of Rasmieh Odeh, a Palestinian activist that was found to have lied in her US citizenship application and will, according to some sources, be deported to Jordan. For example, The Daily Beast says:     If she is convicted, she faces a fine and 10 years in prison. She will then be stripped of her U.S. citizenship and deported to Jordan, where she holds citizenship.   Since most (or maybe all?) countries allow a person to cancel their citizenship, there could be a case where this kind of person only has a US citizenship (even though they are born abroad, but in a country that does not recognize ""citizenship through birth"").  In that kind of situation, would the person not be deported? Or would the government look for some country to accept the person even though s/he is not their citizen? "
460,Tax treaty with USA -- exemption for 2 tax years or 24 months?,"I am in the USA on a J1 visa and thanks to a tax treaty with my country I am tax exempt for 2 years.  Does this mean 2 tax years or 24 months?  For example, if I arrived to the US on August 1st 2012, does the tax treaty apply from Aug 1 2012 to July 31 2014, i.e. 24 months, or from Aug 1 2012 to Dec 31 2013, i.e. 17 months?  Is this the situation referred to as ""dual status alien""?  I am primarily looking for references rather than an answer stating yes or no. "
461,Resigned from my position on UK Tier 2 Visa: Do I need to notify UK Visas and Immigration that I have left the UK?,"I was a UK tier 2 visa holder from Australia. I resigned from my position and returned permanently to Australia three months ago.  I have just received an email with a ""Notice of Curtailment"" regarding my UK tier 2 visa, informing me that I have to leave the UK by a given date (or submit a new application).  Should I send them a letter saying that I already left? Are you suppose to notify them when you leave? "
462,Education as immigrant to US,"Today, the UK Independence Party claims:     If I got a work permit in America for two years and I went with my family, I would have to pay for education and health.   This is in the context of dependents and secondary education, as seen by UKIP's proposed policy:     Immigrants must financially support themselves and their dependents for 5 years. This means private health insurance (except emergency medical care), education and housing ...   Are dependents of immigrants to the US allowed to attend public (state) secondary schools, or is their only option private schooling? If they are allowed to attend state schools, do the immigrants pay for this? Does this depend on the type of immigrant visa or status? "
463,Cheap way to move stuff from USA to Western Europe,"We (two people) are moving to France from the USA.  We can't carry all our stuff in suitcases, it's simply too much.  What is the cheapest safe way to move things?  Think the usual things one might want to bring, a few books, clothes, simple household items, and the odd weird thing one wouldn't part with (imagine anything from a small bicycle pump to LEGO pieces).  Is USPS shipping the best way?  If yes, what do I need to consider to make it go smoothly through customs?  I worry about things such as the package being opened at customs and many tiny things falling out.  Also, should I use my own box or get a box from USPS?  Can/should I get a wooden crate to make sure the box won't fall apart?  We would probably fit in about 25-40 kg (a very rough estimate).  As a clarification, this question has two main parts: (1) how to move cheaply (2) security, i.e. ensuring that everything arrives in good order. "
464,If I have a ILR how long can I stay away from the UK?,If I have a ILR how long can I stay away from the UK? I have immigrated here and hold an ILR in my US Passport since 1987. I have not paid to have a new ILR stamp in my passport as I felt the £900+ charge was outrageous and my MP has looked into it and as long as I carry my expired passports with me I can travel in and out of the Uk at will. I am now looking to stay in Spain for an extended period of time and want to make sure I do not loose my ILR status. How long can I say away? 
465,Non-Resident Withholding Tax in New Zealand,"I have an investment in ANZ and every time I receive an interest payment there is a discount of 33% of withholding tax.  I have it for a while, the 33% quote doesn't vary with the amount of interest paid.  I would like to know more about this tax. I think an answer that comprises of the answers of these 3 questions should suffice:   Does 33% look right?  As a non-resident, do I have the right to get part of that back?  When I get my residency, will it change?   Feel free to add more information :) "
466,Secondary school leaving certificate nostrification in Czech Republic,"I am a Ukrainian citizen. I have applied for a bachelor's degree program at the University of South Bohemia (Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic), and they have accepted my application on the condition that I will get my secondary school leaving certificate (the certificate is issued by a Russian school, and has the apostille on it) nostrificated (recognized/certified as equivalent) by the interview/exams date, which is the 18th of June.  So now I'm in trouble. From multiple sources I have figured out that I need to submit documents for nostrification personally. To do that I need to go to the Czech Republic. For that I need a short term visa. The problem is that the university can't make me an invitation for the visa to handle nostrification, they can only invite me to exams.  I tried to find some Czech agencies to assist such situations, but they seem to be slowpokes, and do not respond to emails. The nostrification procedure takes 30-60 days, so I must hurry up, or I'll be screwed. All I have right now (aside from a ton of papers, that should confirm my certificate) to present to visa issuing authorities is a letter from the university that states I need to go through nostrification procedure, a bunch of email correspondence with University and a government official from Prague, who confirmed, that I have to present all the papers personally.  So, what should I do? How do I get a short term visa to submit my nostrification documents and to take the nostrification exams 30-60 days afterwards? Finances are not a problem in my case. "

The selection is done on a points-based assessment. If you meet the selection points requirements without speaking French you may still be granted the CSQ. Fill out our online assessment forms to find out if you qualify.   My question:  As my above score chart shows 57 points as single applicant, Is it still mandatory to learn French language to gain Quebec province certificate? "
468,"Cape Verde citizenship, is it acquired immediately by marriage?","Cape Verdean citizenship by naturalisation may be acquired when applicant can demonstrate to have resided in the country for at least five years. The residency requirement may be waived for a person who makes a sizeable investment in the country.   However, a person who marries a citizen of Cape Verde apparently is automatically eligible for citizenship upon request. What exactly does this mean? If the request is made at the time of marriage then the applicant would not have resided in the country except for a few weeks perhaps. Is there a residency requirement or not? How fast exactly would one obtain citizenship after marriage? "

470,Decent salary in Bahrain,"A recruiter called me who is ready to offer 1100 Dinar per month (approx 2900 US$) as salary for a software developer role in Bahrain.  I am a single guy currently working in India with 4.3 years of experience leading an average lifestyle. Is this a good salary to live in a decent clean safe home, eat a typical average Indian food, come home yearly once and save at least 50K INR (approx 780 US$) per month?   If this is low, please let me know what would be the right salary? "
471,Does a carte de séjour extend your visa?,"I am currently in France for an internship. I have a long-stay visa that expires after seven months. I was under the impression that a long-stay visa was valid for a year though. I obtained my carte de sèjour (or a titre de séjour? I'm not sure what the difference is, but this is a sticker in my passport) in the correct time frame and that is all set now.  How long does the carte de séjour last? Does it expire the same day my visa does, or does the carte allow me to extend my visit? Namely, I was hoping to stay for 8 months, nothing longer than that. But of course I want to be out of the country by the correct date. I'm just confused about the information I've found. "
472,Mother in law coming to US what to do about Gold and cash?,Ive posted on this site in the past about getting my mother in law from Iraq to visit us. I got some excellent help and she had obtained an immigrant visa. We were ready to have her here and she ran into issues at her home country causing her visa to expire.   Fast forward a few more months and she has been finally able to renew her visa. Now she is finally ready to make the long trip to the United States. One thing she has that has a great value to her both in terms of family value and monetary value is gold in terms of jewelry.    She probably has about 10k dollars worth of gold that was given to her when she got married as well as when her mother past away. She is curious if it is okay to wear or bring her gold with her?  Does she need to claim anything about it when she arrives here. I don't know if there is any rules about such a thing. I simply told her to wear it and she should have no issues.  I think if you are bringing the gold as a gift you need to write this stuff off on your claims when coming to the country. This is not a gift so I am unsure if she needs to do this. Can she just wear it or put it in her purse?  She would rather not check it in due to theft in Iraq.   She also has about 10k in cash as well. If I remember correctly you can bring up to 10k without any issues?  I just would like to avoid any trouble when she is coming here.  
473,Is Indefinite Leave to Remain equivalent to a multiple-entry visa for valid 3 years?,"I was born in the UK in 1992. Can apply for citizenship?

474,How do I correct an error on my submitted IMM 5710E form for my Canadian Post Graduate Work Permit Application?,"I would like some urgent advice. I recently submitted my PGWP application (on the 8th of May) to IRCC, I applied online. I am yet to hear back from them. However, I realized that I have made an error on my IMM5710E form. Instead of entering the Document Number for my study permit, I entered the document number for my TRV.   I do have a copy of my study permit attached to my application and both my UID and TRV Document Numbers are accurate (I triple checked), but I am concerned that because I entered the TRV document number instead of the Study Permit document number my application may be denied (or delayed).  This is in response to Question 4 (If possible, provide the document number of your most recent Visitor Record, Study Permit, Work Permit or Temporary Resident Permit issued to you"" of the section ""COMING INTO CANADA"" in the IMM5710 E form.  In your opinion, do you think I should reach out to CIC and petition them to update my application with the document number for the study permit? How would you suggest I do that? Or should I wait for them to respond?  Thank you "
475,What are the logistics and taxation ramifications of working remotely for a US company while living in Norway?,"It seems like every expat scenario is little different. Here's mine. My husband and I are both US citizens and have never lived outside of the US. I have a 3 year full time position with the Norwegian government through a University starting in July. We do not need Visas. We will get resident cards when we get there. The process will be easy since I have been offered a job in Norway and  my husband will easily obtain resident status at the same time. Insurance is covered by the government for residents so we will have health insurance coverage.    My husband currently has a remote job with a US company and would like to take it with him when we move. He is considered a full time employee and not a contractor. We have not broached the subject with his company yet for fear that he would be terminated.  When in Norway, will he be paying taxes to the US or to Norway? I know the US has a taxation treaty with Norway but I can't figure out his situation. (I understand my taxation situation.)   What will his employer have to do to keep him on as an employee? We'd like to make this as painless as possible for them so that they have no reason to let him go.  "
476,"Working in USA, for a USA company, temporary without a green card?","I'm Italian (sadly), and I'm planning to find a job in USA and move there. I'd love to do it before the end of September, and I'm trying to understand how visa and green card work and what are the involved timings.  I know that to live in the USA I need a green card. I've found, too, that it exists an H-1B visa that seems to allow me to move to USA and work there for a certain period of time. But there are cases where bureaucracy is not my territory, so this time I'm sure more or less about nothing.  Note: I know the concept of green card sponsors, but let's forget that for a moment.    Basically what I'm trying to understand is: suppose that I find a job in the USA. Can I move there and work with just the H-1B, and in the meantime request the green card? How difficult is to get the green card, by the way? Will the timings work? "
477,Study in Germany with Polish D type visa?,"If I have a multi-entry type D visa from Poland, may I stay longer than 3 months in another Schengen state such as Germany for study purposes?

478,"Can I ask a EEA family permit in Italy for a second time, 2 months before my current one expires?","I have a EEA family permit that expires at the end of August. As I need to return to Italy in July, and I will be there 3 weeks, I want to take advantage of that and ask for the EEA family permit again, due to is the only way to travel ( I am also going to ask the residence card but after), and I need to travel meanwhile my residence card will be processed.   I want to ask if it is possible to ask my EEA family permit during the travel in July ( in July I will have my current EEA family permit active, nor expired).   Do you think they deny the new EEA family permit because I am a holder of an active EEA Family permit?   Do you know the case of someone who has done this before? Do you know the outcome?   Do you know if they could say NO or deny my application (only because of the fact that at the moment of the application I have an EEA family permit already active)?   In the case they accept to make a new EEA family permit, is the other one canceled?   Thank you very much!  "
479,US citizen in Germany - need visa?,"Been reading on this on many sites, including the official one (of course) and the wording is such that I'm not sure what the exact answer is.  My question:  I have entered Germany as a US citizen (so no visa needed for up to 90 days) and plan to stay for a few years for studying. What kind of visa (if any) do I need to apply for in order to stay in Germany legally? What is the difference between residence visa and residence permit? Do I need to have a student visa to apply for residence permit?  Please be specific in your answer. "
480,How can a Portuguese Graduate work in the USA?,"I recently finished my 1st year of MSc in Marketing in Portugal and want to move abroad in order to start an international career in the United States as soon as possible. I'm presenting my thesis in September 2017 and I'm planning on working until September 2018, and then move. I've been searching for some internships and graduate programs in Marketing, Digital Marketing, Marketing Agencies and so on, and I know there are a lot of opportunities for locals.  However, I'm feeling a little ""scared"" because from what I saw there are a lot of obstacles separating me from this goal: is it true that, in order to get a work visa, the employer must go to the immigration services and get it for me? Are you familiar with how to start this process? And how realistic is this goal?   Just wanted to get an idea from someone who already did the jump from Europe to the US :)   Thanks! "
481,Adding additional evidence after submitting an application for a UK short-term study visa,"I applied recently for a short term study visa to join a summer School at an English university. I submitted the following document:   The invitation from the university in England, confirming that I have paid the fees of the summer School which inclined the accommodation. A letter from my supervisor confirming that I am working at his institute as a phd researcher. my residency permission in Germany which is valid for more three years. my passport. a flight ticket.    I unfortunately didn't submit my bank statement. The employee of the visa center didn't ask about it and I thought it is not required. I am very surprised to see online in many forums how important it is. Well my question, do you believe that what I have submitted can be enough to get a short study visa? Can I add a bank statement to my application, although I can see that my application has been sent from Germany to the UK? "
482,What's the Canada family immigration sibling rule now?,"The wording changed on Find out if you’re eligible to sponsor relatives perhaps in 2015 or so (I checked in the Internet Archive) and I do not comprehend the new one at all. First of all, I checked the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (S.C. 2001, c. 27) and all it says is the unhelpful     12 (1) A foreign national may be selected as a member of the family class on the basis of their relationship as the spouse, common-law partner, child, parent or other prescribed family member of a Canadian citizen or permanent resident.   Second, now I absolutely do not understand what rule governs the immigration of siblings as this page now only talks of them in negative:     You may sponsor one relative, related by blood or adoption, of any age if you meet all of the conditions, including:      you don't have a living relative you could sponsor instead, such as a:      brother or sister   Now, I have a brother who is above 18 and my parents and still alive but they don't want to immigrate while my brother just might. I am a Canadian citizen. So what's the rule now...? More importantly, what's the source of the rule, surely not this confusing webpage?  There's [website]"
483,Can a foreigner register a car in Baja California (Norte)?,"This is a follow-up to Buy/Register car in Mexico.    The advice given in the answer to that question was to get a Mexico license, which I think was the correct advice, however we have been delayed in that so now need an alternative solution.  We have been in Mexico now for over 6 months, and the registration on our California plated vehicle is about to expire (and therefore also our insurance).  The CA DMV will not let us register the car as we are not resident in CA.  We began the Mex driver license process not long after our residency was signed-off and we got our ID cards (which was mid-January, about 2 months after we arrived).  Although we have started the process, we keep getting run around and being told different things, and the process is dragging.  It didn't help that we had to move from one city to another (still in Baja Norte) and they made us start the process all over again!  So we are back to having to find a solution for a vehicle.  As a legal Resident (RT) in Mexico can we, with our NZ driver licenses and residency cards, purchase, register, and insure a car to drive in Mexico and occasionally in the US?  Alternatively, are we allowed to drive someone else's Mexican car (registered and insured by them)?    I would prefer answers around the legality of it, as I have read many blogs and ex-pat type forums where some have said they've done it and others said they couldn't, but haven't had much luck finding if it's actually legal/allowed.

484,Entering the UK while undergoing visa application,"I spent 6 months in the UK last year (February to August 2016) under a Tier 2 Skills Transfer visa from the US on a US passport.   I will be starting the Tier 2 General visa process with my US employer to move to our UK office in the next month or so. Currently they are undergoing the labor market test.  I have a close friend's wedding in the UK the first weekend of September and I am wondering if I will be able to enter the country while undergoing a separate visa application. I would enter the country after the 12 month cool down period from my visa last year and would have a return ticket to show them I am entering as a tourist (for now).  Will I likely be allowed in? Will entering the UK complicate my current visa application at all? If everything goes smoothly, I should have visa stamp by the end of September or early October.  Any advice would be appreciated.  Kind regards, JV "
485,How to work on the cited reasons for the refusal of visa?,"My visa application for a study permit has been refused yesterday.  They are citing the reason that    I won't leave Canada after my stay because of my current employment situation.  My plan and progression of study don't make any sense.   I am planning to submit the visa application again.  What points do I need to work on to make sure that I am not refused for the second time?  FAQs     What am I applying for?   I am applying for study permit. I have an acceptance from a canadian university to study CS Masters by thesis program. My target is to get a Ph.D. But, the accptance I have right now, is for a Masters by research program.     What did I submit along with my visa application?   My financial papers, marriage certificate, ...  I have strong family ties. My wife and daughter are in my country, I supplied my family photo, and I clearly described that I want to get back to my country after my Masters. But, I didn't tell them that I want to do a Ph.D. in Canada. Coz, I thought that may complicate the situation. But, still, they refused me.     What is my current employment situation?   I left my job because of stress and went to a non-English speaking country for study. I don't have a job and I don't have any plan to do any job anytime soon in the future.      What is my academic situation?   I came to the country 'X' to (1) escape my then stressful job, (2) to get prepared for a Ph.D.   But, then, I understood that (1) the academia of that country 'X' is tough to suit for me because of the difference in highereducational culture, and language. (2) the higher education of that country 'X' is considered inferior to Canada/North America.  So, my Masters program is half done, and even if I can't get to Canada, I don't intend to finish my study here. "
486,Can a Non EU that obtained the UK residence card for marriage remain in UK working in the case his EU wife return to EU?,"I want to ask if it is possible for a non EU with an EEA residence card to remain in UK working after that the EU partner returns to her country (EU country different from UK). I wonder if the Non EU that has the EEA residence card and is working in UK loses the right to stay and to work in UK if the EU partner has to return to the EU country (different from UK). We will remain married, but as my EU wife has a contract for 1 year and after she doesn't know if the employee renews her contract. Maybe she returns to her EU country. In the case that she has to return, what happened with the NON EU husband that is working in UK with the residence card?  Can he (the Non EU) work in UK for the rest of the time that he has active the residence card? or Do you know if he (the non EU) has to come back to EU?   "

488,Moving to Berlin,"I am an American, and I recently took a job in Berlin.  I have a few questions regarding how to perform a transatlantic life transplant (see what I did there?)   What is the best way I can move my money from USD to Euros?  I wasn't planning on closing my domestic bank account, but since I will be wanting to move the bulk of my money to Berlin, what is the best way to do this?   a. Recommendations on German bank accounts?  Reasons?  I am a gamer, and I have a custom-built desktop computer with 3x monitors.  How the hell do I bring this to Europe?  Do I?  Should I deconstruct it and reassemble over there?  Should I bring the hard drives, and build a new one completely over there?   Cell phones.  I've already bought an unlocked phone for when I arrive.  Does this mean I just need to buy a SIM card at a cell provider, and I'm good to go?   a.

490,H1b: Is it safe to move to different team (internal transfer) within same company before Oct 1st?,"My question is pretty obvious as mentioned in the title: currently I am on OPT, but my H1B just got selected from the lottery. Probably will be valid on October this year.  The thing is, I currently do not feel comfortable working with my current team, so I am planning to move to a different team in the same company (similar job function, but different address). Will it affect my H1B visa? And do I need to do something with my lawyer about this? "
491,US nonimmigrant: passport expiration while in the US,"If someone lives in the US in a nonimmigrant status, is the person required to maintain a valid passport while the person is in the United States?  If so, citations for the relevant portions of the US Code or Code of Federal Regulations are appreciated.  This should not be possible for many nonimmigrants, because their period of admission is supposed to be limited to the validity of their passport (for some countries' passports, even six months less than its validity), but as I understand it, it could happen to someone admitted ""D/S,"" meaning for ""duration of status,"" or to someone who has changed or adjusted status while in the US.  Because the linked resource is a comment, I quote it here:     In any case, in practice, I have seen many reports of people getting COS/EOS I-94s that match the petition expiration even when their passports were expiring sooner, and I have never heard of someone getting COS/EOS I-94s that are limited by the passport expiration, so at least that's how USCIS handles it in practice. In fact, many times people are surprised that they get COS/EOS I-94s that match petition expiration, but when they leave and re-enter the US, they get I-94 at entry that expires earlier due to passport expiration, because CBP is required to limit I-94 by passport expiry.   Another comment says:     The AFM chapters on Change of Status and Extension of Status do say that ""The applicant must hold a valid passport at the time of application and is required to maintain validity during the entire period of his or her stay in the United States."" which supports the view that the passport only has to be valid, and not for a particular length, at the time of application.   One of the linked pages makes reference to 8 CFR 214.1, but that seem to say more about what happens at the time of the application and not much about what happens afterwards.  In particular, it says that ""the alien must agree to maintain the validity of his or her passport,"" but it does not say whether anything happens if the alien fails to do so.  I would also be interested to know whether the answer would be different for someone in G-4 status (for example) as opposed to someone in F-1 or H-1B status (for example). "
492,Italian residence permit renewal,"I have a valid student residence permit in Italy, which will expire in two weeks. Ideally, I am supposed to apply for renewal a month before expiry. The issue in Milan is that when I go to the post office for the renewal application of the residence permit, they tell me that the application kits/forms are finished and they will receive the new ones next week. This has been happening for the last two weeks and I have been to four, five different post offices (major ones in Milan) but I got the same answer.  What should I do in this situation? If I'm unable to submit the application before the expiry of my current residence permit (two weeks from now), will I be allowed to live in Italy on the basis that it was not my fault? What are the options?  Please also note that I'm a non-EU student, from Pakistan. "
493,Urgent matter: How to get an apostille stamp from abroad?,I have two master's degrees from Spain and Italy. I need to apply for a German visa for my PhD and they require my documents to be legalized by an apostille stamp. I live in Iran and cannot travel to Europe to stamp them. How can I get the stamps from abroad? Would the consulates of Italy/Spain in Tehran provide this service? 
494,Return of passport after UK residence card application,"My wife will be applying for a UK residence card soon. She is Argentinian. I understand that the HO will keep both of our passports (I am the British citizen) until the decision is made.  Is there any possibility of her getting her passport back so that she can go to Argentina for a family event? Alternatively, would a copy of her passport satisfy airlines/border agency etc? She has an Argentine ID card, which will suffice for getting in and out of Argentina with the passport copy, but I doubt that would be acceptable here. "
495,UK Tier 5 visa - does AIESEC-UK contribute in the salary of the person sponsored?,"I've learned recently that the UK government offers Tier 5 visas for students wishing to stay in the UK for a period of 12 months, to do internships or to work for a short period of time. These Tier 5 visas are usually sponsored by AIESEC-UK.  Knowing that AIESEC-UK is paid by the employer, I was wondering whether AIESEC-UK contribute in the salary of the trainee/worker? in other terms what's its actual role in this case (is it like TLSContact and VFS Global, i.e. just an intermediary)?  Sorry if this is not the right forum to ask this question. "

In my interview, just in case they asked me about my employer, can't I just say I changed my employer? "
497,Can my wife enter Germany in order to apply for a family reunion visa?,"In another post of mine, it was brought to my attention that my wife would have trouble entering Germany as a Canadian citizen in order to apply for a family reunion visa from within Germany.  The poster says this:     As a Canadian your wife is entitled to visit Germany without a visa, but she is limited to a 90 day visit. However she will probably be asked why she is there. If she says ""I'm coming to live with my husband"" then she will be refused admission, because she needs a visa to do that. If she says ""to visit my husband"" then she is going to have to provide good evidence that she will return to Canada before 90 days are up. There will be suspicion that she intends to stay longer than 90 days.   Why does it matter that she's coming to apply for family reunion? Our idea was to simply let the border police know our intentions properly and that's that. How can we handle this? "
498,Is there any way to get a new (not renew) US driver's license when living overseas?,"I will visit the US for business but I have a problem about the driver's license. I'm a US citizen.

I have a driver's license from South Korea with my South Korean citizenship (I mean I have dual citizenship and I'm living now in South Korea as a citizen not as a foreigner).  But I can't use that license in the US because I have to use my US passport when I enter the US.  It means that I can't use my South Korean passport and driver's license. So, to drive in the US I have to get a US driver's license.  But, I'm living in Asia and have no address in the US.  How can I get a driver's license? Should I stay and renta  house in the US or Guam? "

If I need to exit the UK to apply for EEA FM permit, is it necessary to apply for it from the Philippines or would just any country do, as long as it is outside the UK territory (eg. France)? Budget and time are the main factors. Do we need to wait for his third month in the UK before we can apply, or can we immediately apply as long as we have the documents required?

The company is very happy with my results and they would like to keep me.   As far as I know the H1b visa is the best option to be allowed to come back to the US and keep working for them. They are willing to sponsor me but I know that the H1b visa is very hard to get. What would be other options for the company to have me come back?

My authorization to work in the US is unknown.   What kind of authorization are they talking about?  I am a normal student (no criminal records, etc.) from India, currently in the US and applying for jobs.  My OPT starts soon in June.  Thanks.

507,Can workers escape Saudi Arabia by going to their embassy?,"I heard that foreign workers in Saudi Arabia, even westerners from the USA or European countries, are essentially imprisoned as indentured servants and that it is routine for the employer to seize and hold the worker's passport and that to leave Saudi Arabia requires an ""exit visa"", so essentially any foreigner is a prisoner. I could hardly believe this, but the ""FAQ"" for a hospital employer seems to confirm it, and also a long article by a foreign resident on Hub Pages says essentially the same thing in greater detail, that all foreign workers, even Europeans are on ""contract"" require an ""exit visa"" to leave.  What prevents a person from the UK or the US from just going to their embassy and asking for a new passport and help to leave the country? Do the embassies of the UK and USA collaborate with the Saudi government to imprison their own nationals against their will in the country? "

513,Are there power socket adapters from H to E/F which carry grounding?,"Israel has - unfortunately -  a unique plug type, Type H:    and I'm interested in using some German or Dutch equipment / cables with it. This is trivial to do if you forego grounding, as Type-H sockets take type-C and type-E/F plugs with no adaptation needed. But I do want that grounding.  Now, you can get a socket adapter, which on the male side has the third pin:    and thus, hopefully, it carries the grounding (though who knows, right?). However, grounding can only be carried on condition of your plug passing the grounding using a third pin that goes into the adapter: Types B, G, H, I, K, L etc. The popular EU plugs, type F (and type E) either take a reverse-pin for the grounding:    or touch grounding on the rim of the socket:    and I have not been able to find adapter which have any of these two features. Do such plugs exist at all? If not, are there other solutions for hooking up EU electrical equipment with grounding, in Israel / Palestine? "

Is there a minimum financial requirement for an Employment (Scientific Researcher) visa to Ireland? And if there is, how much is it? Thanks.

It is about two months old, and the money in it has been put there only once (during the opening). I am not currently employed, as I have just finished my PhD (mid-November), and this would be my first real job. That money was just something I borrowed to some relative while I was a teaching assistant in Auckland, New Zealand. "

517,Visa for Child born in the UK to parents on Tier 2 (General) Visa,"I came to the UK on Tier 2(General) Visa on 26 April 2014. My wife and Daughter came along with me on Tier 2 (Dependant) Visa. Initial visa was valid until 31 January 2016. In December 2015, I have applied for a 3 year extension for all of us and got extension until 14 Feb 2019. I qualify for my ILR on  1st May 2019 which is 75 days away from my Tier 2 visa expiry date. So I am now planning to apply for an extension to my Tier 2 Visa.  We had a baby born in the UK in Feb 2017. As I was not intending to travel out of the UK with the baby, I had not applied for a Tier 2 (Dependant) Visa for the baby so far. Now that I am applying for an extension to my Visa, Do I need to apply for a visa for the baby as well? Is it legal not to apply for visa for the baby?  As I am planning on applying for ILR in May 2019, I want to find out if I can get away without having a tier-2 visa for the baby?  Thanks. "
518,Moving into The Netherlands with my non-EU partner,"I am a Dutch/German and Brazilian citizen currently living in Brazil (been living here for 4 years now). Next year I will need to move back to The Netherlands, however, me and my Brazilian girlfriend would like to move together.  We are currently planing on marrying, but I am not sure what is our best bet due to our current circumstances. Would it be best to marry here in Brazil then move together to The Netherlands, or, marry in The Netherlands?  How would we legalize her in The Netherlands? Would marrying in Brazil help the legalisation process? Would I need to financially sponsor her independently if we marry or not? "
519,J-1 2-year requirement waiver,"Several years ago, I was sponsored to receive a J-1 visa via government funding. I was subsequently subject to the two year home residency requirement, so I went home for a few years satisfying that requirement.   Afterwards, I received another J-1 visa but I funded this one personally. Since then, I met my fiance and wish to stay in the US, so I'm applying for a waiver to the two year requirement. However, during the application process, it asks for copies of all forms DS-2019. Does this mean that I should include all such forms I've ever received, or just the ones relevant to my J-1s whose 2 year requirement is not already satisfied?   Also should I checkmark the box that asks whether any of my J-1s received government funding? I'm afraid that if I checkmark that box, they will look at it, and immediately throw out my waiver application, thinking that I am subject to the requirement because I received government funding for my earlier J-1. Then there would be no way to appeal, so I feel doing so is risky  Similarly, it asks for pictures of the J-1 Visa pages for when I entered the US? Should I include the old already served ones? "

521,How expensive is sending a letter by registered mail in the Netherlands?,"I want to send some forms (say, 5 or 6 pages) by registered mail somewhere. How much should that cost me?  I'm not currently in the Netherlands to check, but a friend of mine said they asked him for 1.6 EUR for non-registered and 8.45 EUR for registered. Now, 1.6 EUR is a bit pricey, but 8.45 EUR seems like a lot. Could this really be the rate? "
522,How to calculate customs duty on importing furniture to Switzerland?,"What custom duties and taxes must one pay on importing furniture into Switzerland from the European Union? I've heard that these are calculated based on weight. What are details of the calculation? How would I calculate the duties and taxes on say   100 kg of new furniture, worth 200 CHF   I am moving to Switzerland from the European Union next month. I understand that household effects older than six months can be moved duty free. I'm considering buying new furniture in my home country before I move. I'm curious what duties I would have to pay. "
523,Non-English speaker as reference in UK Citizenship,"I'm filling in the citizenship form for my son, and he needs two references and one has to have worked with him in a professional capacity. We currently live in Bolivia, which is where he is from. I had two options for this, a teacher and a social worker.  Here is the quote from the guide:     If the child is living abroad and does not know a British citizen who is qualified to act as a referee, a Commonwealth citizen or citizen of the country in which he or she is residing may complete and sign the form, provided they have a similar standing in that country.   His teacher is American, so I think she's out? She does have Bolivian residency though. The social worker I worked with for the adoption is willing to do it, but she's Bolivian and speaks no English. I would need to help her fill in the form, translate it, and have her write her answer, and translate it back into English before having her write it in. That seems very complicated - any idea if it's okay? Any other options? "

525,Health Insurance for National D Visa (Poland) under work category,"I have received a work permit for a position in Poland and will shortly be applying for a residence visa.  One of the requirements states that I must have health insurance for the duration of the stay. I will be covered by my employer insurance once my contract begins, but during that initial settling in period I will need to insure myself privately.  Axa seems to fit most of the criteria, but I don't really want to pay for 12 months of insurance. How many months coverage is enough to satisfy the requirements for the visa? Do I need to show any additional documents with my application in this circumstance? "

I was wondering if there's a cap for the number of Verpflichtungserklärung one can request at once and/or during a year? In other words, how many people you can invite to visit per year? In there a cap? "

528,German tax for couples : choosing appropriate tax class,I have question on taxation and choosing tax classes. It is already complicated enough and now figure out tax classes for couples seem crazy.     Is there a proper tool to check for appropriate tax class for couples? We both earn have a difference of about 15% in annual salary right now. Some calculators show 4/4 is better while other show 3/5. Right now I am leaning towards 4/4.     Also is it possible to change the tax classes multiple times in middle of the year? I might change my job later this year and would then change the salary difference and hence might need new calculation.     Is there proper tool to do these checks or we have to hire accountant for it?   Thanks a lot!  
529,Can anyone tell if an EU driving licence has been exchanged from a non-EU country?,"Once you have exchanged (converted) a non-EU driving license (before 1993) to a French driving license, can anyone tell if it has been exchanged?

It is an older paper license and I can’t see any mention of the country of origin on it.  Thank you "
530,What are my legal rights in France?,"Here is a cry for help! We cannot figure out how to amend our situation. Maybe someone out there can help us with legal advice.  We've done tons of research online, but things change so quickly and here in France the left hand never talks to the right hand when it comes to government documents.  In March 2014, my husband and I married in Normandy, France, after fighting through the immense amount of documentation they needed supplied and translated, only planning to stay here until we were married then move back to England as a family. My then 5 year-old son (not genetically my husband's son, but he's his daddy) and I are American. My husband is British, born and raised.  From this point on my son and I have had no legal need for a carte de séjour technically, as family members of EU citizens do not need them as long as they entered the EU country legally. My son and I were given a 3-month visitor's visa. We moved from Normandy, France to Vendée, France. A major change of day-to-day temperature, financial situation, and all matters of life for us.  We happened upon an offer that seemed to be too good to be true, so we decided to stay in France and attempt to start a business repairing and running a gite. My husband has been desperately trying to get work and stay in work since May 2014 as the offer turned out to be a farce, but has only had possibly 10 months total of work up to today.  We are not renting out the house my husband inherited and are living on this income alone and have been since about June 2014.  My son and I have left and entered France a total of 5 times in total including first entering France until today, with little to no trouble, outside of two occasions:   The time we entered England to go to my father-in-law's funeral, where I was kept aside and questioned for about four hours, since we hadn't booked returned ferry tickets, as we were not exactly certain how long all affairs would take to get in order. It was a nightmare. We were finally given just 9 days to settle everything and burry my father-in-law then return to France. Which we did. The last time my son and I went to visit family back in Colorado, USA in summer 2015, where we were nearly turned around at CDG airport for not having a carte de séjour -- even with my documents showing we were legal to remain. We have no health insurance, no governmental financial aid, and no carte de séjour or social security numbers for France -- not even my husband... as we just cannot understand what rights we do or do not have and how to go about sorting everything out.   I am pregnant, due in mid August, and we are drowning in every bill imaginable. We are waiting for an appeal on our UK family permits, but that's looking rather dark as the UK referendum is looking at leaving the EU.  Oh, I forgot to mention I had a grand mal seizure, first time in my life, and spent 4 days in the hospital and am now only a high dose medication daily until I give birth where even more tests must be done after I give birth.  1a. How do we get health coverage through England? Is it possible? What documents are needed?  1b. How do we get health coverage before I give birth, if we're not eligible for coverage through England?    How do we push for our appeals to go through quicker, as they have both been put on hold since February? If we end up needing to stay in France, what are my and my son's legal rights in Vendée, France?  "
531,EEA Family Residence Card Refused - Should I appeal?,"and thank you in advance to anyone who responds to this post.   I applied in November 2015 from within the UK for an EEA Family Residence Card to join my Austrian partner here in London. However, this got refused last week, and I have until this Wednesday to decide whether to appeal the decision or not. (I was late getting my paperwork back from my lawyer, and even getting the news of the refusal.)  My lawyer (whom I've since let go of) unfortunately misguided me throughout my application, so I was under the assumption that I would definitely get it, as I felt we had proven sufficiently that my partner and I are in a durable relationship, and he assured me that we had.  However, since unfortunately we were living together in South Africa, we have very little official documentation to prove that we were co-habiting during our time there. It's a third world country that doesn't have the same thorough legal status as here in the UK. To compensate, we added Facebook conversation logs (filtering through over 10 000 messages!) and a plethora of photographs of us together. This was unfortunately not sufficient, which I can understand.   So my questions are these:  1) Do I have enough grounds to appeal their decision simply because I feel their decision is wrong? Do they need to have broken some sort of law for me to be allowed to appeal?  2) Am I allowed to submit new evidence in the appeal to attempt to counter their points of refusal? 3) Would it be better for me to fly home and to reapply from there instead of appealing while I am still here in the UK? (Even though they are allowed to send me home whenever they want)  Any help, at all, would be appreciated immeasurably. I understand that the time frame is very tight, but I'm hoping someone can lead me in the right direction. Thank you in advance. "
532,Can I obtain a waiver for my J-1's 2 year residence requirement based on government financing?,My DS-2019 form requires me to return back to my home country after the completion of my work program considering the fact that I receive government financing (i.e. salary from an institution funded by the U.S. government)   Is it possible to obtain a waiver for this kind of rule? Does this mean that I'll return to my home country and stay there for two years after the expiration of my one year J-1 visa?  
533,Michigan driver's license,"My wife and I are likely to be in an EU country for 10 months starting in the autumn, and my Maryland driver's license is scheduled to expire during that time.   Since all four of our parents live in Michigan, and since we probably plan to move to that region after coming back, is there a way for me to get a Michigan driver's license? Or do I need to get a Maryland license for now, then convert after we move back?   "
534,Postal address without fixed abode?,"Disclaimer: I'm not sure if this question is appropriate for this site, Travel SE, both or neither.  For a great many amenities which are useful to most people (e.g. bank accounts), you need to supply a ""permanent"" address of some kind, and oftentimes Bad Things will happen if you supply an address which is either not available or unreliable: For example, at least in the UK, banks will freeze your account if your post is returned to the bank as ""undeliverable"", and the excitement of living a nomadic lifestyle will be somewhat dampened when you're e.g. in the middle of the Mongolian steppe and can't speak Mongolian/Chinese/Russian and suddenly have no money.  For someone who wants to lead a truly nomadic life, then, what are the solutions to the dilemma of needing a geographic address for e.g. banks, insurance companies, etc.? Family and/or friends are always one possibility, but are there no solutions which are more ""professional"" and/or ""official"" so that said persons don't need to be responsible for my stuff?  Finally, in some countries, it is required to ""register"" your primary residence in some way; Although this can obviously be more difficult than dealing with private companies, is there no solution for this, e.g. some way of ""officially"" being on the move? Of course, solutions to this, second and more specific problem will likely be country-specific and so may be too broad to answer. "

536,French naturalisation and CAF history - benefits an exclusion cause?,"When one applies for naturalisation in France, if they fulfill the requirements in terms of time spent in the country, there are other requirements for things to be shown such as:   evidence of three 'good' French tax returns evidence of your employment as well as your contribution to French society evidence of linguistic ability in the French language a submission of your CAF records   it is the last point which I am enquiring about. It is not explicitly stated on any website of the French government, but I have read online that having claimed social benefit at any point during your stay in France excludes you from naturalising.  I am not yet to the point where I can naturalise (the time requirements are a few years away from me still) but I will be eligible due to completing a PhD in France. Assuming that all of my other requirements have been fulfilled, the question becomes:  Is there any information available on the effect of having claimed social benefit in France on naturalisation applications? So far, all information I've found has been personal accounts from the Internet.   If it makes a difference, I have not CLAIMED social benefits (read: I have never gotten any money). I made an application under the encouragement of others during a hard financial period, and the application was approved. Further documentation was required which I did not send in. I was not aware, at the time, that this would have a negative effect on my immigration record. I just had a PhD stipend and was spending more money than I was getting (US student loan payments = half of my stipend and the rest was rent) and colleagues recommended the scheme, so I thought I'd try. I haven't done anything with the application since.  Will this count as having claimed social benefit? What effect will this have on my application if all other requirements are fulfilled? "
537,What are the restrictions on Romanian citizens in the EU?,"I am a Romanian citizen and I would like to know what are the restrictions on Romanian citizens in the EU?  I understand that Romanians needed work permits in some of the countries in the EU until 2014, but these restrictions have been lifted. I wonder what restrictions hadn't been lifted yet - and when they will be lifted? (for example: can we buy real-estate / study in other countries in the EU? Can we pass the borders like other EU citizens?). "
538,Is (current) residence status conditional to one's citizenship(s)?,"Is a residence permit somehow ""tied"" to the citizenship you have/had when applying for and/or receiving said permit or is it legally independent of it? For example:   A person applies for and receives a residence permit for Elbonia as a citizen of Ruritania While residing in Elbonia, said person loses Ruritanian citizenship for whatever reason but   they (still) are not a citizen of Elbonia they are not a citizen of any country for which Elbonia has a freedom-of-movement agreement (e.g. not like Spain with Malta, with both being in the EU)  Does the residence status of this person change?-- Do they have to re-apply for residence or somehow ""change"" their residence permit?

I had  a dental problem and went to a clinic. I sent the invoice to the insurance company but they consider this to be covered by the ""general insurance"". Result: I have to pay the bill completely because I am still under ""my own risk"". They refuse to pay this from the dental insurance, which would cover the bill, because they argue this was a specialist treatment. This makes me wonder why do I need a dental insurance then?

549,US Common Practices with kids that new Immigrant parents should be aware of,"There was a famous story back in 1997 about a Danish mother that left her toddler outside the restaurant.  Some practices for behavior in public, common and accepted outside the US, might be illegal or considered ""shocking"" in the US.  This could be surprising to new immigrants.  I am not referring to anything as barbaric as Female Genital Mutilation, but things like leaving your child home alone when he/she is in grade school and the like.  Are there other ""benign"" practices, that are acceptable in much of the world, that might be considered illegal or out of the norm in the US?  Or are there any guides that one might refer to for this kind of information? "
550,"When do I have to register for French taxes, if I'm a new arrival working in another EU country?","I'm currently thinking of moving to France, for something like 4-6 months, to try to get my French to a higher standard. This would only be a temporary move, and I'd remain employed in another EU country (the one where I currently live). I believe I'll remain ""tax resident"" in my home country, at least as far as they're concerned.  What are the rules about French Taxes in such a situation? How long can I spend living in France, employed in another EU country, before I have to register for French taxes? Does it matter when in the French tax year I arrive, or is it just on time spent? And if my trip would qualify to need to register, what would the process be, given I'll have a foreign employer? "
551,Strategies for finding foods from home when you're abroad?,"I'm sure it's quite a common thing for expats - you spend a few weeks, maybe even a few months in a new country, enjoying the new cuisine and learning all about it. However, at some point, possibly when feeling a little low or a little homesick, you'll have a yearning for the taste of something from your home country. Maybe something you used to eat often, maybe something you tended to just eat as a child, maybe a special drink, but chances are there'll be something!  If you're lucky, it'll be something popular enough in your new country that you'll be able to find it in a large supermarket, and your cravings for the taste of home can be sated.  If you're unlucky though, and the bigger shops round you don't stock it, what then? What strategies can you use to get hold of some of whatever ""foreign"" food it is you're after? "
552,Will 5 year residency permits be available in Turkey after the new 2014 visa laws take effect?,"I know that Turkey is still issuing 5 year residence permits (ikamet tezkeresi) as of March, 2014. However the whole visa system is changing this April. All the mentions of ikamets in documents I have been able to find about the new rules are about 1 year permits. Will 3 and 5 year permits continue to be an option under the new rules? If so to citizens of what countries will they be issued and what conditions must be met? "
553,Providing evidence of Medicare enrollment for countries with reciprocal healthcare agreement,"I'm an italian citizen applying for a Temporary Activity (subclass 408) visa. The online application form asks for evidence of healthcare insurance, and that's ok. However, since Italy has reciprocal healthcare agreements with Australia, I will be covered by Medicare for six months since my arrival (and my visit is planned to last exactly six months).  This means that, in theory, I don't need a private insurance policy.  This is explained at the website of the Department of Immigration and Border Protection (DIBP) at this link:     You are responsible for all your health costs while you are in   Australia. You will not be covered by Australia's national health   scheme (Medicare) unless your country has a reciprocal health care   agreement with Australia.   While at this link, Italy is listed as one of those countries. The documents needed to enroll in Medicare include the European Health Insurance Card, which I do have. I suppose that this is the kind of evidence that the online form asks me to provide.  However, this is not entirely clear. The document checklist on the DIBP says:     If you are staying in Australia for more than three months, you are   required to provide evidence of adequate health insurance for the   duration of your stay in Australia, such as:          a certification letter from your health insurer or broker    evidence that you have enrolled   with Medicare if your country has a reciprocal health arrangement with   Australia      But, as far as I've read everywhere, enrollment in Medicare can be done at Medicare offices in Australia after my arrival, and I don't find how to enroll in Medicare online or similar. So do I have to provide evidence that I can enroll in Medicare, or evidence that I have enrolled in Medicare?  To summarize, in the online application form, is it sufficient to provide my European Health Insurance Card as proof that I'm eligible to Medicare services? "
554,What are the requirements to teach in an Austrian public school?,"Are there any requirements that one must have to teach in a Viennese (Austria) public school?  Such as:   Do I need a college degree? Do I need some kind of credentials?   I'm an American, For what it's worth. "
555,"Can I drive a ""moto"" in Spain with an EU driving license?","I currently hold a Dutch AM and B driving license. I've been residing and working in Spain for 4 months now, and I wonder:   Do I have to change my Dutch license for a Spanish one at some point? Spanish license holders automatically get an A1 license after 2 years, which allows them to ride a motorcycle. They do not have to get a new license for this, even if on the license it says they don't have A1, if the license has been given to them more than 2 years ago, it counts as a valid A1 license. Does the same thing apply to EU licenses without A1, but older than 2 years? And if not, would I be able to change my Dutch license into a Spanish one with A1 on it?  "

558,Working abroad as a US citizen for a US university,"My question is related to contracts when moving abroad as a US citizen working for a US organization (university). Starting September of this year I will be moving to the Netherlands and move in with my Dutch husband. My department wants me to continue working for them and also try to expand our relationships with European universities.   My question is as follows, do I need a special contract if I want to stay with them? Should they hire me as a freelancer perhaps? Or can I keep a ""normal"" US contract?

As a side note, I do have a working permit and residents permit for the Netherlands but would love to remain with my current employer. The Netherlands only seems to look at your world income and has a treaty with the US to prevent double taxation.  Thanks for your help! "

563,Australian immigration long-stay 457 visa - do we need to pay tax on our engagement ring?,"We'll be moving from the UK to Australia later this year, on a long-stay 457 visa which has been granted for 4 years.  My fiancée will be moving with me, and we'll be getting married at some point before the 4 years is up. (Likely back in the UK)  After reading the Duty Free concessions page on border.gov.au I'm confused as to whether her ring would fall under the 'general goods' category. If so, it'd likely be well over the $900 personal limit, even if we combined our allowances.  My question: Will we have to pay duty + taxes on it? If so, how much? I'm seeing conflicting information here online, and Google wasn't much help - all I could find was info on Australians travelling abroad to buy rings.    More details:   Diamond ring with platinum band, bought this year &lt; 12 months ago in the UK We paid around £3400 for it, and have the GIA certificates etc She'll be wearing it on her hand throughout the flight and immigration We won't be selling it, and will be taking it back to the UK (or wherever we move onto next) in 4 years We'll be flying back once a year or so to visit friends and family  "

567,German Tax Refund declaring foreign source income,I moved to Germany on the 1st of July 2016 and started working immediately.  Recently I did Steuererklärung and today I got a mail from Finanzamt that I need to declare my income for the period of 0.1.01 - 30.06.2016. The problem is during that period I was living in Azerbaijan and working as a private business owner with a contract for some company and I was also a student.

How long can I stay in the Netherlands with no further arrangements after my contract and residence permit expiration, without it being illegal/punishable? Do I/can I get some kind of grace period to look for another employer? If I need to do something to legally extend my stay, what can I do (other than through a new employer)?  "
569,Visa response for Non-EEA family member of an EEA citizen,"I am a British citizen who moved to the Republic of Ireland and trying to bring my mother to Ireland to live with me who is a Pakistani national. I applied for my mother's visa on her behalf on the 21st February and now it has been nearly 4 months and I still have not recieved any response of the decision which I check it every Tuesday online:  [website]I did contact the visamail@justice.ie and they simply responded with similar to what is already written on their website:     The application referred to is currently awaiting examination.      Due to the large volume of applications of this type, the visa office is   currently experiencing some delays in the processing of applications.   While every effort is made to process these applications as soon as   possible, processing times will vary, having regard to the volume of   applications, their complexity, the possible need for the visa office to   seek further information in relation to certain applications, and the   resources available.   I would like to know if that long wait is actually normal and if so, what is the maximum time wait that can be expected? My mother and I are both separated since nearly 4 months now and she is all alone at a old peoples care home and I really miss her and need her to be with me in Ireland instead.   Stupid question but is there anything else I can do to speed up the process? "
570,CA-HU dual citizen tax residency rules,"Income taxes abroad – Hungary says     Living in Hungary? You must pay tax on your worldwide income there.   But it also says:     Your employer deducts income tax and social contributions from your wages, daily allowances or other remuneration.   My situation:   I am a Canadian-Hungarian dual citizen. I am employed by a Canadian company. I work remotely. I have officially closed down all my affairs in Hungary a decade ago, I do not have a proof of address card, I have done a final income tax report, I do not have health insurance -- the whole nine yards. The only official link left is my passport (and birth certificate). Due to some real interesting twists of fate despite the above I now own a house in Hungary.   I might or might not spend more than 183 days next year in Hungary, I honestly have no idea of how things will go and I am wondering: how would they know? Given Schengen, it's awfully hard to keep track of who goes where. Also, how would my Canadian employer work ... Hungarian taxes?  That does not sound reasonable. "
571,"Canadian ""inland"" spousal sponsorship and conditions of stay with a study permit","I have Canadian citizenship and my wife is a Chinese citizen on a study permit, studying in a college. I am looking to apply for inland sponsorship for her. At the same time, because of our financial situation, we were considering if it could be possible for her to stop studying for a while until (hopefully) she becomes a permanent resident, so that we don't have to pay the high international student tuition fees.  The question I have is, how to maintain her legal status in Canada if we submit a sponsorship application in the next couple of months and if she doesn't return to school in September?   My assumptions so far (from my very limited knowledge of the law) are as follows:   She might get ""implied status"" after I submit the sponsorship application package, but the implied status would still have the conditions of her original study permit (i.e. she needs to study at a DLI). Therefore, she would be in violation of her study permit conditions if she doesn't show up to school, even despite that there is a PR application in progress for her at the IRCC. She might not even get implied status right away, until I am approved as a sponsor, because until that time, neither her PR application, nor her application for an open work permit (""change conditions of stay ... as a Worker"") are even considered She must have a valid immigration status, as the CBSA will deport her even despite her having a PR application in progress (i.e. it is allowed to submit a PR application as part of a sponsorship even without a status, but it is still not allowed to stay... and as soon as she leaves the country and not allowed back, the inland sponsorship is refused automatically)   I know there is an application to ""change conditions of stay as a Visitor"" (IMM 5708). I was wondering if this is something anyone ever had to do, or if it sounds too unusual and likely to fail. Also, do any of my assumptions look incorrect, in your opinion? "

573,The US Healthcare Penalty and the UK National Health Service,"Dual US/UK nationals have full access to the National Health Service (NHS) by virtue of their British citizenship.  They are also required to file US taxes by virtue of their US citizenship.    Recent US legislation stipulates a so-called 'healthcare penalty' if the taxpayer does not purchase health insurance under an approved scheme.    The NHS is not listed. The reasons for this could be that it is such a 'corner case' that the IRS did not consider it; OR its omission was intentional (in which case dual nationals be liable to the penalty).  Can the NHS be safely used as an exemption to the healthcare penalty? If so, what documentation would a person have to substantiate their exemption?   "
574,"Can my employer change the conditions of our verbal contract or cancel it even though we both agreed on starting day, salary and all conditions?","I applied for a managerial position, to which the job posting had been displayed online officially by the hotel company. I interviewed with the GM of the hotel and was offered a job right away, we discussed salary and she wanted me to send all the related documents as soon as possible so I could join the team.  I provided all the required documents to the hotel over email in a timely manner and had only positive feedback from the hotel. This week I was supposed to sign my official written contract which was to be prepared as all my documents had been sent – health insurance, tax documents, certificates, references, residence papers, police reports, health checks etc.   The GM referred me to another person in charge since she was absent. I contacted this person and this person advice me to come in for a meeting and finalized the contract. Once I came in to the meeting I got re-interviewed and my German language skills were tested by another person brought especially only to test my skills of the German language. (This was not a requirement for the position and my language skills were not posed as an issue when offered the job initially by the GM).   This all came as a big surprise for me since I thought I was coming to sign the contract and starting my position the following week. The person not only questioned my language skills but told me that the position was really a supervisor position, not a manager position. She told me she would need to re-consult the GM to clarify and get back to me.    Tomorrow is my official start day at work and I have been requested to come in for a 3 pm meeting to clarify and discuss my situation - it seems like the GM is still absent and has left all the decision making to the other person. For me there is nothing to clarify since I was hired for a manager position and I am supposed to start tomorrow. I have the feeling that they either want to try to take back their job offer or try to push me down to a lower position with less salary/benefits based on my language skills.   What can I do to defend myself, what does that German labour law say about Verbal contract with email correspondence support? Is this strong enough to claim my right to employment with the hotel even though I do not have a written contract to support. Also, is there any discrimination laws applying to my case since there is no other basis that they can claim to change my level from managerial to supervisor other than the stated problem of my language skills? I have all the required experience and I have provided them with ALL the documents and other conditions they required.   Most of the correspondence I have over email and can prove – only some over phone.  In addition to this I have lost almost 1 month time worth to which I could have found other employment. I have also missed opportunities for other hotels since I accepted this offer.   Please let me know what I can do to defend myself during tomorrows meeting. "
575,I've been living and working in the UK for the past 1.75 years. do I still need to file state taxes in the last US state I resided in (California)?,"I am a US citizen.  I quit my job in California and moved to take another job in the UK in October 2013. For FY 2013, I filed both federal and CA state taxes, since part of that year's income came from my previous job in the US.  In this tax year (FY 2014), all of my income came from my UK job.

Now, I have a academic job offer (US government funded project,research scholar for 2-yr contract) and open to J1 or H1B.   How many maximum years I can be on J1? If I go for J1, does it again impose ""2-yr home country residency requirement""? Is there any way to know that before I start the job with J1 status?

How early or late should I go about disconnection of utilities (electricity, internet)?  Should I wait until the last week or should I start disconnecting by ""disengaging my contract"" with various utility companies online immediately? My fear is that if I disengage my contract right NOW, I will be without utilities in April. However, I also fear that if I wait too long, then if there is some back-and-forth documentation that I need to deal with, I will fail to complete it.  I currently have an EDF account for electricity and the contract runs until end of April as per my online account. My internet/telephone is managed by Orange France and it is ""sans engagement"".  Unfortunately don't have any French speaking friends who can do this on my behalf and my French is not up to scratch and I generally fail in getting through the company switchboard's automatic message system which is in French.

N/A * Name of Company/Organisation/ Employer: N/A  * Job Description / Title / Rank : N/A  * Type of work undertaken: N/A  As I am employed do I still need to state my Company and Job Description?

600,How to correctly apply for an EEA Family Permit for me and my son?,"My life partner is an EU citizen (Italian passport); she was born in Uruguay and we live together with our son (one and a half year old) in Uruguay. We are relocating to Newcastle upon Tyne because she is accepting a job offer from a UK company there.  As I understand it, we must apply for an EEA Family Permit, with my son as a family member, and me as an extended family member because we are not married. Then a residence after we are more or less settled (before 6 months).  I have a few questions:   Is the EEA Family Permit the correct way to go? If my son gets an Italian passport on time for the trip, does he need the EEA Family Permit? Do we need two applications, one for me and one for my son, or can the application include both? As I understand we must apply in person (after the online process) in Buenos Aires, Argentina, because there is no office in Montevideo. Is this correct? If my son must apply for the permit, must he come with me to Argentina? Must he be there for the application? Is our son's birth certificate proof enough of our relationship? If not, what additional documents should we provide to prove the partnership? What are the requirements for the documents presented (translation? Any official validation? Apostille?)

602,EEA National Sponsor: EEA Family Permit Online Application,"I'm almost through filling the EEA Permit. I have answered every question regarding the applicant's employment, income as N/A.

603,"Living in Japan for 25 years, how can I change the address on my old paper license?","I need the new UK ID card license to apply for a Japanese license here in Tokyo. My old paper license is still valid. In going through the process via GVT-UK online, I was met with the problem that my old address and postcode (Goldington Rd, Bedford MK41 postcode) on my paper license (the details of which I was filling in as requested) do not 'match'. Perhaps this is due to building changes over the years; or all I know, the old place might have been knocked down, as that area of town is unrecognizable after years of roadworks and construction.  It mentions requiring proof of residence in the UK for at least a month of having received the license. Well, I certainly was in the UK for some years after acquiring the license, but proof could be tricky as we're talking 20+ years ago. Is it easier to simply send the license in by snail mail and have it send to a family address in the UK? It also talks about getting fined up to 1,000 pounds if a change of address is not notified. Yikes, I haven't notified DVLC of anything for 25 years! What to do? "

606,EEA National registration certificate number,"My civil partner is making an application to move to the UK and be with me. I live in the UK and I have an Italian passport. I am self-employed but I don't have an EEA National Registration Number. I am here legally, exercising my rights, and have had no issues.

607,France speeding tickets,"There was a time when I was young and (very) stupid.  I had a car, registered under my name, in France (near Geneva). Just before leaving the region and selling the car, I did a trip to Lyon. Since I was in a hurry, and reckless, I did speed up quite a bit (about 180 km/h). Since I left the area very soon after and sold the car, I didn't see any fines.  Is there any way to check if there are any fines under my name? Will they chase them?  "
608,US Citizen with French residency and with a French auto-entrepreneurship. How do I do taxes?,"Here's my situation: My family moved to France when I was 14 in 2011. I have a French residency card (titre de séjour) which allows me to work. I have a freelance translation business registered under French law (a business I've had since 2016). I moved out of my family home in May 2017, which is why this year will be my first time paying taxes for both countries.  My question is: how do I go about doing my US taxes? What do I declare and not declare?  I'm quite lost when it comes to the IRS website. I don't know if I declare what I've made with my business as my business is French, but as my own employer, I'm American. When asking my mother, she said that I wouldn't have to pay income tax, but I would have to pay social contribution tax (Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, etc.), though she wasn't sure either.  Also, I don't know if this is important, but I live with my partner, who is French. I'm guessing the IRS doesn't care about him, as he isn't American, but the more information the better I guess.  Thank you in advance for your help, as this is all quite confusing. "
609,Can I send an EEA national certified copy of passport instead of the original for an EEA Family Permit?,"I'm an extended family member of an EEA national (Italy). We are partners, we currently live together in Uruguay with our son.  She's accepting a job offer in the UK and we are relocating. My son is an EEA national so there is no problem for him. We are all traveling together.  I'm applying for a Family Permit, but in the process i have to deliver my partner's Italian passport to prove she is an EEA national. The thing is, if the Family Permit takes long she can't travel, at least not as an EEA national, and she can get in trouble with the company that's hiring her, even lose the opportunity.  As I understand I could deliver a certified copy of her passport and my son's passport instead of the real ones. Is this correct?  If this is correct, does anyone have any idea, what does a certified copy of her passport mean? How and where do you usually get it? "
610,Will applying for a Dutch residence permit invalidate my French residence permit immediately?,"I am a non-EEA citizen finishing my PhD soon in France and have an offer to join a company in the Netherlands.   My future Dutch employer informed me that I don't need to apply for a Dutch visa given that I am a resident of a Schengen country. They will apply for a residence permit on my behalf. If the application is accepted, my future employer will book an appointment for me and I will be able to travel to the Netherlands to finalize the application and get my passport stamped which will allow me to work until my residence card is issued.   While my future employer applies for the residence permit I might be outside France and the Schengen area. My question is: if the Dutch authorities accept the application submitted by my future employer (I will be outside France by then), will my French residence permit be invalidated? Will I be able to reenter the Schengen area?     "

With such a visa, one can stay up to 3 years in Korea and can work and have a business and after 3 years, is eligible for a F-5 visa (permanent resident).  Eligibility to F-2 visa is determined through a point system taking account age, education, income and Korean proficiency.  How is Korean proficiency assessed for the F-2 visa?

My father was born in Holland, then moved to South Africa. I know I was 6 years old when he gave up his citizenship for South Africa.   I would like to know do I still qualify for citizenship?

614,Does I-140 application submission/rejection affect future US non-immigrant visa applications?,"I am in the process of applying for immigration I-140 through EB-1B Outstanding researcher category; I haven't submitted the application yet. EB-1B being EB-1B, the burden of proof is on me and the bar is very high; application approval/rejection is highly subjective and there's no guarantee it will get approved (I have seen cases where strong applications have gotten rejected and weak ones have slipped through).   If my application gets rejected on the grounds that it's not strong enough to demonstrate ""outstanding achievement"" in my field, then will this rejection affect future US non-immigrant visa applications (I will have to leave the country in a few months in either case)?  I did some searching on this topic and got conflicting opinions; some immigration lawyers think that technically ""immigrant intent"" is only demonstrated when we submit I-485 adjustment of status application, while some argue that submitting I-140 in itself demonstrates immigrant intent in the eyes of the visa officer processing your future applications for any other visas; since they have wide discretionary powers, it doesn't matter whether you submitted I-140 or I-485, you demonstrated immigration intent.  This also brings up another question: Can CBP officers at port of entry and visa officers in consulates see your record of applying for I-140, which might affect their decision to grant entry or future visas?

615,Netherlands postdoc salary and health insurance,"I'm a biochemistry Ph.D. student in the United States considering a postdoctoral fellowship at a private institute in Utrecht, the Netherlands. It would be the best next step in my career, but I'm unsure if it's financially realistic.  If I've calculated correctly, according to the salarischaal I'd come in around EUR 3303/mo. (at a 10-5, a new postdoc right out of my Ph.D.). Multiplying by 14 would put my annual income at 46242 euros, correct?  [website]This doesn't account for tax. I believe I'd be eligible to receive the first 30% of my salary tax-free, leaving 70% of my salary subject to a 40.85% tax )of EUR 13,222):  [website]That means I'd end up with about 33,020 Euros after tax, correct?  I'm married and have two kids. Complete care coverage is a necessity, my understanding is that this would not typically be provided to me as a post-doc but I would need to buy it on my own. Does this sound normal?  I'm a US citizen, but my wife is a Dutch citizen (with a US green card). Does her Dutch citizenship change how I would be taxed if she decided to get a job over there? "

619,F4 inquiry about children,"I applied for an F4 immigration for my family and I in 2006. I recently got an email from the NVC stating that it was time to pay the fees and start collecting my documents which i was pleased to receive. I was under the impression ,however, that both of my children who are now 22 and 25 years of age have aged out but once i opened the application their names are mentioned and there is an option to pay their fees as well. So does this mean that will be accompanying me or will i have to apply for their immigration separately??

Just a few days earlier we received an email from NVC asking us to submit our fees in January 2019 (Sorry for not having the exact dates and knowhow because im really new to this.) My son 25 years old now i thought that his name would not be on the application site and for them to be asking me to give his fees as well along with my family as i thought he had aged out. So does this mean he will be granted an f4 visa with me?? "
620,French housing agencies refuse to accept a foreign guarantor,"My Swiss girlfriend is looking for housing in Paris for a 6 months internship. Many housing agencies she spoke to refuse to accept her Swiss parents as guarantors, despite their salary being sufficient, on the basis that they're not French, and require a French guarantor to sign a contract.  First question: is this legal?  To go around this issue, some agencies have suggested to use GarantMe, a service that allegedly, paying a quite expensive price, will act as a guarantor for you.   Questions:   Should she trust this site and service?  Is this step really necessary, or there's another way to get housing without a French guarantor?   Another solution would be finding housing with some roommates that already have a contract with the agencies, in France, do landlords require a French guarantor even for a sub-location contract?  Any suggestion will be appreciated, merci! "

639,UK EEA Family Permit Refused - Urgent HELP needed - Marriage of convenience,"I wonder if you guys can help me. My wife (Albanian National) was refused an EEA family permit on the grounds that the ECO believes that this is a marriage of convenience. Link to image: [website]Here is a short, rough timeline.  We met in 1998, married in 1999. We had two kids, one in 2001 and the other 2004. We have lived in Greece since 1998.  I came to the UK in September 2015, started working full time October 2015. I’m currently employed and I earn about £1100 after tax.  My kids joined me in February 2016, one has started school and the other is awaiting a placement.  In my wife's application we included:  Her passport, my passport, marriage certificate, a joint bank statement from Greece, her right of residence card from Greece (which is given on the basis of being married to a Greek Citizen), my utility bills, council tax, payslips, p60, letter from employer/accountant.  Basically the ground for refusal is that she has not provided any documents to demonstrate that we are in a genuine subsisting relationship. Considering I have been married with her for so long, having had two kids and lived together in Greece just before I came here I thought that would be enough.   I generally speak to her for 2-3 hours a day using skype on a VOIP app from the i phone so I have no idea how to get the logs from these apps to show that I am in contact.  I have done a little bit of searching and found this article, which by the sounds of it her application should not have been refused, this is taken from : here        EUN2.10 What if I suspect a marriage / civil partnership of convenience? When a marriage / civil partnership of convenience is   suspected, the burden of proof is high and rests with the ECO.   However, in these cases the ECO is entitled to interview the   applicant. Factors to consider include:         an adverse immigration history; doubts about the validity of   documentation; application follows soon after the marriage / civil   partnership; no previous evidence of the relationship.      The ECO should not consider the following cases as marriages / civil partnerships of convenience where: there is a child of the   relationship; there is evidence to suggest cohabitation.   There is an appeal form in there but I think that route is too long and I believe re-applying might be a better solution, my questions are these:   Should I include the refusal letter of the first application indicating the mistake (if indeed it is a mistake) that the fact that we have two kids together has been overlooked?  Should I include family photos stretching back the last 17 years or so?  Will screenshots of the conversations help?  Should I include a family certificate?   What else can I include to strengthen my case?   Edit based on answers:  Do you know how i can make an informal complaint to the British consulate?  I don't want to have any doubts on my mind of not submitting enough information this time round so maybe including more evidence might be a good thing just to show that i am providing things which they felt were ""missing"" also what are the chances that my next application will be assigned to the same ECO?  Before i apply i will post a picture of the letter i will write to them just so that you can guide me as i do not want to be seen as putting the blame or telling them how to do their jobs.  Also from the letter i posted there were "" no specific circumstances defined that gave the ECO a reasonable ground to suspect that the marriage is one of convenience""  "" First, there is no burden on the claimant in an application for a family permit to establish that she was not party to a marriage of convenience unless the circumstances known to the decision maker give reasonable ground for suspecting that this was the case. Absent such a basis for suspicion the application should be granted without more on production of the documents set out in Article 10 of the Directive. Where there is such suspicion the matter requires further investigation and the claimant should be invited to respond to the basis of suspicion by producing evidential material to dispel it.""  I guess the above is correct, but no invitation was received by them? should i include Article 10 to my letter?  Edit based on answer 2:  Hi,  Thanks for that, i posted an answer as the comment field was very limited in characters.  I have spoken with my wife and she told me that from the list of documents we provided they have kept everything apart from her passport and some utility bills.  So they've kept a the original marriage cert,  my payslips/p60 letter from employer and also a Sponsorship declaration i did from a solicitor in the Uk (cost me £75). is there a reason as to why they do this?  Also how do i go about sending this letter, i have no address or where to send it. Do you believe that it is necessary considering i'll be making a fresh application?  Thanks once again "
640,My Australian and New Zealand student visas were declined,My Australian student visa was declined in March 2016. After that I applied for a New Zealand student visa in june 2016 and it was also declined.   What can I do now? Can I reapply again in both countries? 
641,UK Pensions for US citizens - is an IRS Form 8621 (PFIC) ever needed?,"An American friend of mine, who's a permanent UK resident and currently sorting out their US tax return, has just come across a new term from FATCA - Passive Foreign Investment Company (PFIC). Via this article from some tax advisors (which may therefore not be entirely neutral), they're starting to wonder about their UK pension and this.  Are all UK pensions automatically counted as qualified, and therefore excluded from the need to fill out the PFIC-related form 8621 as part of a tax return? Or if it's only some UK pensions, how would my friend go about working out if their pensions count or not? (I think they've got something like a stakeholder one through their current work, something else from a previous one, and a SIPP...) "
642,How are UK ISAs treated for UK-resident US-citizens on their US tax returns?,"In the UK, there's a group of tax-efficient savings accounts known as ISAs (Individual Savings Account). They can be used to save a certain amount (new) money each year, free of tax on interest (cash ISAs), and free of dividend and capital gains taxes (share ISAs). They are generally recommended and widely used, and their use is actively encouraged by the UK Government. According to Wikipedia, they're broadly similar to Roth IRAs and Roth 401(k) accounts in the USA.  How would a US citizen who's a UK permanent resident treat an ISA on their US tax return? For example, do they get any of the tax benefits against their US return, or just the UK one? And do stocks-and-shares ISAs get any friendly treatment, or do they run the risk of being classed a PFIC (Passive Foreign Investment Company) + risk needing a form 8621 filling out? "
643,American marrying Italian in Italy- Document Translation and Apostille questions,"I'm an American and I'm marrying an Italian citizen in Italy in the middle of September and also moving there.   We know that I need to get my birth certificate translated to Italian and have submitted it to be translated. My main question is, what do I need to get an Apostille stamp on? My birth certificate AND the translation?   I'm also unsure of where to get the Apostille stamp. Does it need to be done by the state that my birth certificate originally came from, or the state that I currently live?   Thanks for any help.  Cheers.  "
644,Driving in the EU on UK licence,"I wasn't born in the UK, but I lived there for 4 years, and I have a full UK driving license which expires in 2025. I recently moved to Pakistan.

645,Can H1B share salary with his/her H4 dependent?,"I went to a bank for applying for secure credit card for my H4 spouse (she has a valid ITIN). Bank associate told me that she has to show some income in order to apply. I told them that legally she can't earn and can't make any money, but she is added to my checking account in which I receive my salary.  So, the bank associate said you can enter part of your salary as her income in the credit card application form and so bank associate entered half of my annual income in her application form.  I want to know is this legally right to do such a thing? As H4 holders are not allowed to work, earn and show any salary; so can this thing be considered against the rules and can it impact mine or her visa status?  Associate also said that you might have to show income proof if the bank credit card department asks for it. Have anyone done such a thing and is it right to do? "
646,"Emigrating to Netherlands from ZA, how to get proof of residence in ZA?","In the next few weeks I will be moving to Amsterdam to work for an indefinite amount of time. To apply for the 30% ruling in the Netherlands I need some sort of government form that says I have been a South African resident for the last 24 months. Where would I get such a form and what would it be called?  I have be to my local Home Affairs office and was told they could give me a Declaration of Citizenship but I have been told that this is not the correct form. So what would the correct form be?  Any help would be appreciated.  EDIT: For future South Africans needing this information, if you have been working for two or more years go to SARS and ask for your tax number, a form will be given to you with your registration date, address and tax number. This is a valid proof of residence for Netherlands 30% Ruling :)  "

648,Buying vegemite in New York?,"Vegemite - love it or hate it, if you're an Aussie you'll have an opinion on it! In the USA, the reaction tends to be more ""huh"", or ""you're having a laugh, you eat that stuff?"". Just ask the Australian Foreign Minister, who nearly caused a diplomatic incident trying to bring a jar of it with him into the states...  None of my antipodean friends in New York have thus far managed to find any, so every time I go out I'm asked to buy vegemite in the UK and take a few jars out for them! Is there a better way to get Vegemite in New York, other than asking people visiting from Australia or the UK to bring you some? "
649,"Buying ""cold climate"" vegetables in Manila?","For people coming from colder countries, there are certain vegetables used in typical national dishes, which only grow in colder climates. For example, most Brassicas only grow in cold climes, and lots of kale requires a frost to grow well. At the point when Manila is having frosts, recreating a typical Scandinavian dish is probably the least of your worries, so growing locally is likely out...  Is it possible to buy cold climate vegetables in Manilla? Is there perhaps a special market where you can go which specialises in importing vegetables like that? (I guess probably grown and brought in from Japan or northern China) "
650,Is it possible to find buckwheat in Germany?,"Buckwheat isn't as basic food in Poland as potatoes or bread, but nevertheless very popular. I was quite surprised that I can't find it anywhere in Germany (Nuremberg, Bavaria) in shops like Aldi, Lidl or Norma. In Poland it's available in practically every food shop.  Is buckwheat available in food shops in Germany? If so, in which ones? "
651,Is it possible to become a policeman in Germany as a non-citizen?,Are non-citizens allowed to become police officers in Germany? Are there any restrictions? Are there any advantages for EU-citizens? 
652,What Immigration status do I have in Canada when on International Internship Programme (VIE),"There is this VIE program, so-called International Internship Programme.  The principle is to work abroad, and it applies to many European citizens. The work contract is a bit specific.  I am wondering what is the immigration status of such a contract when doing it in Canada. Is it a simple work permit?  I am particularly worried if there is any impact on a possible future application to the IEC (International Experience in Canada): will I be allowed to participate to both programs?  As a bonus. I would like to know if it has any (positive or negative) impact on a future permanent residence application? "
653,Where do I file my tax when participating to the International Internship Programme (VIE) if non-French,"International Internship Programme (VIE) is a type of contract that offers to many European citizens to work abroad. From the program description, you are officially employed by the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  French people have to file their tax in France, as afar as I understood, but what about non-French citizens? Should they file in France, in the host country or citizenship country? If that matters, let's take Germany as the citizenship country. "
654,How can I get a copy of my Codice Fiscale card if I am an expat?,"I'm trying to get a copy of my Italian Codice Fiscale (Social Security number) card, but I live in the UK.  According to the Italian Consulate, I need to ask any Agenzia delle Entrate, but according to the Agenzia delle Entrate I need to ask the Italian Consulate!  Before I follow these instructions and loop indefinitely, has anyone succeeded in this endeavor? How? "
655,How to get a job in Australia before I go there?,"I have been granted permanent residency in Australia (i.e. I can live and work there). I intend to relocate from Ireland in October. Ideally I could have a job line up before I go, as it's a high-risk and potentially expensive move if I have to support myself and family for a period of unemployment.  Is it possible / likely that I could secure employment before I go? What are the best ways that I could go about doing this? Should I just start applying for jobs on the Australian jobs websites? Should I contact recruiters directly? (this isn't exactly appealing because recruiters tend to ignore you if it makes their job difficult)  For what it's worth, I have a BSc in Computing (Software Development), with 8 years experience in .Net development. I'd prefer Melbourne if possible. "
656,Will my past removal from UK affect my ability to join my family in USA?,"I am originally from Pakistan, I was living in UK on student visa tier 4 and wasn't allowed to work on my visa.  I had 16 months of visa left on my passport when I got caught by UKBA while working illegally, I am extremely ashamed for committing this massive mistake for which I apologize, now I shall get bk to the point.  My father is a US citizen, he filed my green card petition under category F1 in 2011, it can normally take 4 years for my number to become current, I am 26 years old single man, my question is that will my past deportation affect my ability to join my family in USA?  Will it be a mark against me? Will i be asked about that in interview? "

658,What level of knowledge of the Polish language do I need to receive Polish citizenship?,"Living in Poland for a bit over a year now as a resident (married to a Polish citizen). Going to request Polish citizenship once I'm eligible, (living in Poland for two years, married for three).  I know that there is a language knowledge requirement, but none of the documentation I've seen states the level of knowledge you should. Some unofficial sources say that it is B1. Is this true? I have also heard that it is more than just a language test and involves questions about (eg) the ingredients that go into pierogi. Is that true? "
659,Finding an apartment in US as an expat (big city)?,"How difficult is it to find an apartment in the USA as an expat, and how long does it take (how early should I look for it)?   In Germany, it's an immense issue, because the typical dismissal time is 3 months, and you usually look for apartments that will be available within 3 months :(  Is it possible in US to just call an agent 8 P.M. and find something available within a few days, say I like it and it's done? Or I should expect it to be similarly difficult like in Germany (seeing apartments only in a specific time a day, looking 2-3 months forward, having permanent job, seeing landlord personally etc., potential prejudices against non US-citizens)?  I'm asking about big cities like New York, Chicago, Los Angeles. "
660,Non-EU citizen moving to Germany to live with German girlfriend,"I am Brazilian and my girlfriend is German. Some weeks ago she had to go back and we thought about the possibility of me going to Germany so we could live together. For that, our initial plan was me to visit Germany with a tourist visa (Brazilians are not required for visits under 90 days), staying for a period like a month or so to see if I would enjoy the place, and if I do, apply for a temporary residency visa while I still am in Germany.  Is it possible to apply for such visa within German Borders? Would this kind of relationship be acceptable for requiring a visa or we would need to be married in order to require such thing? How about work, am I eligible to obtain an work and living visa since my main goal is to stay with her and for that need to get a work in order to sustain our household?  I have been looking for answers all over the internet, but there's little to no information in Portuguese and when I look for something in English, I normally find information about US citizens that can live in Germany under certain specific conditions, which is far from this scenario. "
661,Did not get National Insurance Number whilst living in the UK,"My wife lived in the UK for 9 years before settling in Canada. She did not work during that time because she was looking after the children while I was in full time employment in the UK. She did not apply for the NI number, but was receiving ""family allowance"" for our children who were born in the UK.  How can we track her ""family allowance"" record information? and possible other information to support her stay in the UK? Thanks "
662,"If my Chinese work permit expires, for how long is my residence permit valid?","I'm a US citizen living and working in China. I have both a work permit (""green book"") and a residency permit (it goes in your passport and also functions as your visa). For foreigners working in China, these are applied for, approved and issued simultaneously, but they are separate documents.  If I cease being employed, I have ten days to begin work and file employment papers at a new job. If I exceed this window, I must exit China and begin the work permit process from scratch if I want to start working in China again.  What happens to my residency permit if I stop working? The work permit enables one to obtain a residence permit, but it's possible to receive one through other means. Does the residence permit remain valid through its expiry date even if the work permit expires? I haven't found anything to indicate otherwise, and it ""makes sense"", but obviously that's no evidence that this is the case.   A simple example: January first, I begin work in China and receive my work and residence permits. They are valid for one year. July first, I stop working. I want to remain living in China through December and my residence permit expires December 31.  Of course, if my work permit expires I will have trouble renewing the residence permit, but that's not the issue here. Please cite sources in your answer. "
663,Leaving and returning to the UK with an invalid German identity card,"I am a German citizen currently living in the UK. My only identity document, my German identity card, is about to expire, but I may want to travel to Germany and back at some point before I will have a chance of obtaining a new ID card the normal way (due to having to obtain an appointment with the German embassy and waiting to receive the document after that).  Can I rely on some way of getting from the UK to Germany and back on an invalid ID card, and which way would that be? I could imagine an airline holding me up with an invalid document, would eg. travelling by ferry be more likely to work?  If not, do I need to find a fast way of obtaining a new identity document before travelling – and what are my options there?    Under what circumstances can I request a temporary ID card for emergency travel from the embassy? Does applying through a honorary consul lead to less waiting time? I know that the Bundesdruckerei takes some six weeks to create the document. This time in itself should be fine, but an additional seven weeks before an appointment at the embassy in London would mean it's late.  "
664,Traveling Engineering Consultant,"All, I was referred here from travel.stackexchange. MY whole life I have lived in upstate NY. This is not enough for me. I want to spend the majority of my time travelling to other countries and working with new people. As of right now I hold a B.S. in Computer Engineering, M.S. in Electrical Engineering, and am temporarily working as a software engineer. I have heard and done research about software consultants that get to travel to many other countries, and since they are being hired by companies their travel expenses are paid for. I have not seen any similar thing for hardware/ASIC design engineers (area in which I'm passionate). Do these types of jobs exist? I am planning on getting more experience as a digital design engineer before pursuing anything officially.   Also, If these jobs do exists, what would the best way to find a client base. and where would most of these jobs be? I am comfortable spending long periods of time at one location if need be, and I am also fine with traveling for just a week.   If there isn't any need for a Hardware engineering consultant, are there any other jobs that I would be able to use my knowledge base and still be paid to travel. Some people have suggested getting a job where I can remote in consistently so that I could travel whenever I want, but I don't like the idea of paying to travel, to just stay in my hotel room or a cafe doing work.  Also, since I would hypothetically be traveling to many countries for various amounts of time, how would the visa system work. Is it entirely country dependent? "
665,"At what point after becoming an expatriate of Cape Verde does one qualify as an ""emigrant"" for tax & banking purposes?","Cape Verde has a special ""Cape Verdean emigrant"" status that confers tax benefits on Cape Verde-source income. In particular, a 20% tax on bank CD interest is waived if you qualify. My wife and I will be emigrating from Cape Verde soon and would like to take advantage of these benefits. We want to know for planning purposes when the soonest would be that she would be able to qualify as an emigrant.  According to the Bank of Cape Verde's Banking Consumer Guide (p23-25; in Portuguese), to qualify as an emigrant you must prove that you reside permanently in a foreign country. From reading lists of requirements on various commercial banks' sites, I see that in most cases to be considered to ""reside permanently"" you must have a paid job or other income-generating activity.  It also seems that one might have to have resided and/or worked for a year in a foreign country before counting as residing permanently there.  What are the actual minimum requirements for this? Are they:   Have a permanent residence permit, reside, and have a source of income? Have a permanent residence permit, reside for a year, and have a source of income? Have a permanent residence permit, reside for a year, and have had a source of income for a year?   If it's relevant, we'll be residing in the US. Neither of us receive any form of pensions. "
666,Customs when moving to France,"I am moving to France (from the USA, but I am not American).  My understanding is that I do not need to pay customs duty for my personal property when entering France.  However, I do need a lot of paperwork to prove that I am moving permanently.  Question: Precisely what paperwork is needed in this case and how can I obtain it?  I would appreciate links to a trustworthy (official) source, preferably in English.  Additionally, what do I need to do when I send some of the things by post instead of taking them with me on the plane?  I was not able to find the official sources. Though I did find mention of the procedure on several websites, most of them are incomplete or clearly outdated (e.g. still using French Francs). "
667,Visa (Credit Card) Regulations in Europe,"I'm a US expat living in Spain (almost a year now). I made a large purchase at an online store last week with my Visa credit card. The item has not shipped, but I have already been charged for the full purchase price.  In the US, Visa requires merchants to ship the product before fully charging the credit card. Do these rules apply in Spain/the EU? Does the EU have rules of its own that trump Visa's rules? "
668,Moving to Italy from Denmark (EU Citizen) requirements,"I'm moving from Copenhagen, Denmark to Northern Italy (Friuli-Venezia Guilia). What requirements must I meet or check into before moving as an EU Citizen?  I will be living with my boyfriend.  Not in an immediate rush to get a job, but on the job market.  What are my options as far as job employment, and also where should I register with the Italian government ? "
669,W9 Form is required by my bank. Do I have to report to the IRS income that is my Argentine wife's?,"Regarding the Form W9 that my Argentine Bank is requiring:  My wife (Argentine) is the main person on the checking account. I am just a secondary person on this account. She receives monthly investment deposits that add up to quite a lot. None of that income is actually mine. However, the Argentine bank is requiring ME to fill out a W9 form.  My question is: will I be required to report these incomes on my US taxes? I am diligently filing my yearly taxes in the US even though I LIVE in Argentina. I do have some rental income in the US which I always report. But I have not been claiming my Argentine residency on my US tax forms. Should I start to claim I am a legal, permanent resident in Argentina just in case I have to start reporting my wifes income? I ask this because, from what I understand, a US person living abroad is allowed to make up to $99,000 per year without paying taxes. What do you think? "
670,What can be done when a country doesn't have Birth Certificates?,"I asked this earlier:  How to help my mother in law migrate - no lawyer wanted!  Thanks to many it has led me to at least print the form and understand the requirements.  It appears based on the USCIS website this specific page:  [website]This specific section:     mother lives outside the United States, Form I-130   A copy of your birth certificate showing your name and your mother’s   name A copy of your Certificate of Naturalization or U.S. passport if   you were not born in the United States   It looks as though filing for a mother is probably the easiest case...thank God.  In any event what concerns me is my wife was born in Iraq.  The village she was from is tiny and there are no birth certificates.  One of the requirements is that a birth certificate is needed.  Given that she has no birth certificate and the country pretty much has no real government what are our options? I can only imagine others have run into this in the past. It may be difficult to get 2 people (as affidavits) to help with this as most people from this country are weary about giving out personal information such as address, phone, etc.  What are my options regarding not being able to fulfill the requirement of having a birth certificate? "
671,What are the requirements for my foreign wife to visit the US with me?,"I'm a US citizen with Mexican residency, about to marry a dual Guatemalan/Spanish citizen. We are not seeking US residency for her, and likely won't for a long time, if ever. But I want to be sure there won't be any problem visiting my family (in the US) with her in the future.  Once we are married, will there be any difficulty entering the US together, her on a VWP (with her Spanish passport), me as a citizen? Or must she obtain a visa as a family member of a US citizen? "
672,Sending Excess Baggage and Personal Effects from France to USA,"I am an Indian citizen and will be moving to the USA on an H1B visa in 2 weeks time. I will be sending excess baggage (personal effects and pre-packaged, dry Indian spices) via sendmybag.com. Per an other answer about a related question on travel.SE, I was planning on filling out a DECLARATION FOR FREE ENTRY OF UNACCOMPANIED ARTICLES form.   I am confused about a few things:   Should this form be affixed outside my baggage or inside? Who does Part V of the form (PART V -- CARRIER'S CERTIFICATE AND RELEASE ORDER)?  "
673,How much points for BS(Software Engineering) Degree Title for Quebec skilled worker program 2015?,I am confused with title of my Bachelors Degree to calculate points for QSW 2015.

Also please tell me how much points i can earn ? 
674,Driving an Italian registered motorcycle in Denmark as a resident,"I moved to Denmark for a job 3 months ago. I am planning to bring my motorcycle (registered in Italy) to Denmark. As a resident in Denmark, I know I have to register it within 2 weeks.  If police stops me, how can I prove that I arrived (with motorcycle) during the last 2 weeks and avoid a fine? Of course, I do not want to get a fine.  In general, what is the punishment for a resident in Denmark when driving a vehicle with foreign plates? "
675,Is it possible to be a resident of two countries?,"I'm a US citizen with a home in the States. Is it possible for me to get a ""green card"" in Germany so I can stay for an extended time, maybe even buy a home there as well?  Also, it isn't possible for me to obtain a German citizenship and still keep my US citizenship? "
676,How frequent are Scart-compatible CRT TVs in Japan?,"I’m about to move to Japan from central Europe. I am a retro-console (speed) gamer and have fitted most of my consoles with the required Scart cables for them to output an RGB signal. For speed purposes, I prefer playing on CRTs.  Considering CRTs are dated, I will probably be able to find lots to buy second-hand at a low price. What concerns me is that Japan is known to have its own JP-21 RGB standard which uses the same connector as Euroscart but a different pinout. Do CRTs exist in Japan which are capable of accepting Scart input and if so, how common are they? Or should I rather attempt to find a Scart to JP-21 converter because all TVs with that socket assume a JP-21 signal? "
677,Renew Chinese driving license on a Q2 visa,"I am holding a Chinese driving license that I got at the time I was living in China with a residence permit.   The driving license is about to expire but at present I hold a Q2 visa (my spouse is Chinese but I am working outside China).  Can I still renew the driving license I hold, showing the Q2 visa next time I go to China? Or it is mandatory to have a residence permit or another visa? "
678,How do I buy and import a car from Canada to the US?,"I'm a US citizen and I live in Ontario, Canada with a student visa. My car from the US was totaled. Insurance has written me a check and since I have no transportation (for instance, to go to MI to look for a car) and my home state (VA) is hundreds of miles away, I'm considering buying a new (used/pre-owned) car here. I called a few used car places and they've all told me their cars come with the emissions test completed that I would need when importing the car back to the US.  My questions are as follows:   Would the emissions test the dealerships perform be sufficient? Does Customs/Border Patrol require anything special? By 'importing' I plan to simply drive it across the local border crossing (into Michigan, not home state). Will customs prepare the proper forms and duties I need to pay at the crossing? Or is there something I should have prepared? Do I retain the Ontario plates until I'm able to title and register the car in Virginia? I have my VA plates off my totaled car. How does that work? What financial burdens should I be aware of?    Notes: I don't plan on having the odometer / speedometer converted from KM to MI and KM/H to MI/H respectively. I can look at the smaller numbers on the speedometer and track my next oil change using kilometers. "
679,Lost British Passport number,"I migrated to Australia in 1974 with my 5 month daughter on my British passport. This passport expired in 1984, was never renewed, and has been lost for many years.  For work reasons my daughter needs to provide the number of my passport. She has, in fact, lost her job even though she has her own British passport. Apparently someone in the human resource department where she was employed decided she is not eligible to work in Australia. I have searched everywhere I can think of but to no avail. Does anyone know where I might find this number???  "
680,Maintain Canadian PR while living with husband (CDN citizen) in US?,"I am from Hong Kong and married a Canadian citizen in May 2016. We have been living in Canada since June 2015, and I applied for PR in Canada in June 2016. I have not received it yet, but let's assume that it comes through any month now.  My husband is considering a move to the US for a job. Let's say that when my PR is granted, I want to move to be with him. According to a 2013 immigrationcanada.pro article, it is possible for me to keep my PR status (and in fact to accumulate ""days in Canada"" towards my citizenship) while living in the US with my husband:     If you (as a PR) accompany a spouse or common law partner who is a Canadian citizen outside of Canada, then each day outside Canada is considered to be a day physically present in Canada.   We have seen just how much misinformation is out there on immigration subjects, sometimes because the information is out of date.  I have corroborated the above quote with an official document from 2015 that states:     R61(4) provides that each day a permanent resident is outside Canada accompanying (that is, ordinarily residing with) a Canadian citizen constitutes a day of physical presence in Canada, provided that the Canadian citizen they are accompanying is a spouse or commonlaw partner or parent.   My questions are:   Is the above information still true today, in June 2017? How old is the policy in the quotes, and how likely is it to change in the future? Is there anything that I am overlooking in this situation that may cause trouble or surprises?  "
681,"EEA Family Permit refused - No clear reason given, appalling letter","Please can anyone advise how to deal with this?  We applied for an EEA Family Permit for my wife to travel from Russia to join me in the UK. We enclosed our passports, my Permanent Residence certificate, and our marriage certificate (with certified translation from Russian to English).  It is not even clear on what grounds the permit was refused, and the letter is appallingly worded. How to deal with this kind of incompetence?    "
682,"As a student, are there specific work limitations for remote working in Singapore?","Starting from September, I will attend full-time classes at ESSEC Business School in Singapore. I saw that I have to get a Student pass (I don't have many details about it right now) and that it would allow me to work no more than 16 hours per week.  Is this limit only applicable to jobs in Singapore or is it the same for remote working? For instance, can I work more than 16 hours a week if I'm working in Singapore for a company based in France?

683,Long stay visa and 90/180 rule,"I got a short stay tourist visa for France from 24th Dec 2016 to 24th March 2017. I was in France for the entire duration of my visa, minus 2 days. Now I want to apply for a long-stay visitor visa starting on 23rd June. Does the 90/180 rule affect my long stay visa? In short, do I have to wait for my 180 days to be over before applying for a long stay visa? "
684,Schengen Visa Validity Date Mistake?,I applied for a student residence permit for Norway and I was granted a visa that is valid for the wrong dates. There are two divisions to a semester in the school in Norway. The first is August Block which starts on August 14 and ends on September 1. The second is the Autumn parallel which starts on September 5 and ends on December 22. All the subjects that I have been granted by the school are on the Autumn parallel period (Sept. 5 - Dec. 22) and the problem is that my Schengen visa only allows me to study for the August Block period (August 14 - September 1) since I have been granted a visa valid for July 24 to September 1 only. Could this perhaps be a mistake on their part in that they may have overlooked the dates that I will be studying in Norway? What can I do to fix it? Should I re-apply? 
685,Apply for Blue card from Home country & the documents required for it,"I'm currently applying for a job in Germany. A company asked me to apply for Blue Card so that I'm eligible to work in Germany. Since I'm residing in Pakistan, I'm not sure how to proceed with this applying of Blue Card.  My profession is unregulated in Germany.  The documents that I have readied for this purpose:   University Diploma (original) already attested from Higher Education Commission in Pakistan. - This document is in English University Transcript (original) that contains courses and scores already attested from Higher Education Commission. - This document is in English All the documents from my College and High School Passport  Job Contract letter 2 Passport size photographs Certificate from law offices in Pakistan that I'm not a public, health or security threat and I haven't been arrested in my life.   My Questions are:   Can I apply for Blue Card while residing in Pakistan because I have received the job contract or does the embassy offers some temporary visa so that I can go to Germany and upon arrival, I have to get Blue Card from Embassy in Germany? Do I need to get the photocopies of my University Diploma and Transcript attested from Higher Education Commission? The original Diploma and Transcript are already attested and the attestation stamp is visible in the photocopies. Do I need to get the photocopies of my College and High School documents attested from Higher Education Commission? Do I need health insurance certificate, if yes, how much should be the value of the health insurance for traveling to Germany? Antrag auf Erteilung eines Aufenthaltstitels where can I get this? Does my employer has to provide this document because currently I'm residing in Pakistan. What's the statement of Comparability? Is it ZAB?

686,Conditions for temporary residency in Spain?,"I asked this on a forum that is supposed to be only about expats in Spain, but it seems that although plenty of people ask questions there, nobody ever answers any.  I chuckle at the first sentence of Art. 25.2 of Spain's Ley Orgánica 4/2000 de 11 de enero:  Granting a visa will be regulated by regulations.  :-)  Anyway, that is in the left column of page five, and goes on to say that the visa process will take into consideration Spain's national interests and any international commitments Spain has made.  Also, that regulations will define the reasons that allow denial.  How can I find these regulations?  But in the right column of the same page, Art. 20.2 appears to say that they have to give it to me if I can prove I am able to support myself without working (or one of three other conditions).  This suggests that any regulation that gives another reason is meaningless.  Now, 25.2 says ""visa"" and 29.2 says ""temporary residency"" so one might say ""two different things.""  But Art. 23.2 says that to enter Spain, you must have a visa, unless a treaty says otherwise.  But 23.2 also says you don't need a visa if you have an authorization of residence or something similar.  So it's a bit confusing.  It sounds like if I am not indigent, they have to grant me residency, and then I don't need a visa.  The consulate says I have to show them the contract to buy or rent a place to live (no hotels in Spain?), but a lawyer said that's not the law and if I hire their firm, they'll make sure the consulate understands that.  :-)  But she did not offer any similar counter to the requirements for medical insurance, certificate of good health, and lack of criminal record.  (Actually, the law I cited above says that a crime cannot be used to deny residency if the sentence has already been completed). "
687,F1 visa DS 160: Contact person in home country,"I'm a student from China who is attending a PhD program in the US. I got my BS from the US, but in the DS 160 form, two additional points of contact from China are required. However, since I did my undergrad in the US, the points of contact to confirm my graduate study are all in the US and I don't know anyone who can confirm in China other than my parents. Then can I put someone in the US for that section of the form? If not, then can I put my high school teachers, who don't even know which grad school I'm attending? "
688,Using old F1 visa due to Administrative Processing,"I recently applied at the American Embassy, New Delhi, for a new F1 visa for my PhD program. After the interview, my passport was collected by the embassy and my case was put under Administrative Processing - 221(g).  Now I don't know if I will get my visa in time for my classes. However, I still have an F1 visa valid until 2018 from my previous program (different university, same SEVIS), so I was wondering if I could just withdraw my application, get my passport back and fly on that visa. Would this create any problems for me in the future? Or maybe has the embassy canceled my old visa when I submitted it? "
689,Apply for Schengen while waiting for Family Reunion visa (Germany),"I've been unable to find any info on this, but is there any way to get a temporary visa to enter Germany before my family reunion visa has been issued? My spouse is going up on a work visa today but my visa appointment for Family Reunion is only on the 4th of July and I've been told it usually takes 3 months to process.  Naturally this absolutely blows and I was hoping to take our cat up around the end of August. I'm also finishing a degree from a long-distance university and I was hoping to write my last examination in Germany. I would only be able to change my exam location until 31 July, so I'm screwed if I'm not in Germany by 20 October, when the exam takes place. It would delay getting my degree by another 6 months. A friend of mine married a German national and was over on a Schengen visa, flew down to South Africa to apply for his Family Reunion visa and flew back the same day. He insists that it's possible for me, but I'm not 100% sure. I know lots of people go up on 3 month visa and fly down to apply for the Family visa, but in all those cases they had a schengen first.  Is it possible? Not even only for the above reasons, but that it would also just absolutely suck to be separated from my newlywed spouse (married 2 months ago) for so long and it's also going to cost a lot of money for us to live separate, as I have to continue renting an apartment here, etc. "
690,Are all modern TVs dual voltage? Moving from Asia to Mexico,"I'm living in the Philippines right now. A month ago we moved to another house that does not have a TV included, so I was thinking of buying one. But we are planing to move to Mexico in a year, and it would be a waste splashing out a lot of money on a new TV just to discover that it will not work in Mexico.   AFAIK, a modern TV uses DC rather than AC so the power has to go into a DC converter at some point. I cannot think of a single good technical argument for making a TV with a 100-120v converter and a 200-240v instead of a 100-240 as you find in laptops.  But its not always the technical arguments that win. Maybe Sony/Samsung/LG/Philips/Panasonic/etc... want to divide the markets so it not as easy to do imports between the continents or something? Does anybody know if this is now possible, or is it still impossible to run the same TV on 100v and 220v? "
691,Status of Irish critical skills permit if work from USA office on L1 visa,"I am an Indian citizen and hence hold an Indian Passport. I am currently working in Ireland with critical skills employment permit which is valid for 2 years after which I do not need a permit to work in Ireland and can take up permanent residency.  The company that I currently work for has its parent office in US. It has been around 8 months on Critical Skills visa for me in Ireland.  Questions -     If an L1 visa is raised so that I can work with the parent company in US:        Is my critical skills permit at risk?   Can I now not get Ireland stamp 4?   Is it possible to work on L1 visa in US and still hold my irish visa permits/rights?   After working for some time in US on L1 visa, if I want to switch to another company in ireland, Will I have to apply for work visa   again?   Does L1 visa changes my employer?      Any insight to above will be helpful. I did research online but critical skills information on sites only talk about eligibility criteria and do not mention scenario which I am facing. "
692,"My Australian visa has a ""Must Not Arrive After"" date, but not a ""Must Not Arrive Before"" date. Does this mean I can arrive immediately?","I've been granted a Temporary Activity (subclass 408) visa from Australia, but confusingly the document says nothing about what's the earliest date I can actually arrive to the country. There is a ""Must Not Arrive After"" date and a ""Stay Period"" of ""13 month(s) from the date of first arrival"".  But what is the earliest date I can actually arrive to the country? Could I go immediately, if I wanted? The contract for the 408 Activity position doesn't begin until July 10th, so I'm confused if I can arrive to the country beforehand.  NB: I'm writing this question for a friend. I'm using the personal pronoun for easier readability. "
693,Do I have to wait for ITIN for H4 spouse?,"I hold an H1B visa and my wife just moved to California as an H4 dependent. I have applied for ITIN along with filing my federal taxes.  How do I file my California State taxes? Should I wait for her ITIN and then file my CA taxes or can I file my CA taxes without her ITIN? I was told by the IRS officer that it would take 8 weeks to get the ITIN. In that case, should I file for an extension for filing my California taxes?  This is what I found in the instructions book of from 540. It does not say anything when one doesn't have an ITIN. "
694,"What are the consequences of a (fake) conversion to islam, for a foreigner visiting Iran?","Apologies if this is not the best SE site for asking this question, but I really wasn't sure which one would match. Posting anonymously because of the sensitive subject.  My fiancée and I recently married (civil marriage). We live in my native country, in Europe; my fiancée, who came here a couple years ago as a student, was born in Iran, from muslim parents, and thus legally a muslim, although she is agnostic at heart. I'm an atheist myself, though I was raised catholic (and know it well enough to pass off as christian if needed.)  Her parents are completely OK with our relationship, know we live together, have visited several times. They know of our beliefs, but they do have a lot of respect for me, as I meet their standards of virtue by my own morals, without the coercion of religion. The rest of her family a little bit less open-minded, but they can tolerate her marrying a christian, if not an atheist, something I have no trouble pretending to be.  However, If I understand correctly, from the point of view of the Islamic Republic of Iran, our marriage would not be considered valid if I'm not muslim.  Of course, all this will only be a problem if we decide to visit Iran. We are very happy with our life here, but she is not ready to abandon completely her family, and the perspective of never being able to return home, even as a tourist, is not easy for her.  Ensuring her safety is my first priority. What could be the consequences for her, if the government was to find out that she has married a non-believer abroad, even with the approval of her father?  I could convert, but if I understand correctly, apostasy is also punishable by death. That alone makes this belief system abhorrent to me. Furthermore, faking a conversion goes against my core values. I'm also worried of the possible consequences of being considered an apostate, or being caught not practicing. What would be the consequences for me, if I'm caught not observing Islam while we are visiting Iran?  I also wonder if, after the required time, when she applies for citizenship in my home country, she could drop her Iranian citizenship and be free from the religious laws applying to citizens? "
695,What is the safest route to marry your beloved (British citizen) in the UK?,"I am an Indian and I have been in a relationship with a British citizen for the past two years. We have never met but we are very serious about getting married by the end of this December.  I want things to be done legally, from getting married to moving to the UK to live permanently. I haven't applied for any visa at the moment, because my partner and I do not want to rush things and make mistakes in our visa applications. What would be the best route to follow to get things done?  As per my research I found out:   I should make a visit first and meet her. She loves India and wants to come back with me and stay with my family for some time. (the condition of the couple having met each other is completed here or no?) We can get married in India and she can go back to the UK and apply for a spouse visa for me.   That's the regular procedure I think, right? Please advise and confirm.  What are other ways of getting legally married in the UK? I want to get married to her in the UK rather than in India. I know that I cannot enter by a fiance visa because I haven't met her yet. And I have read in a great answer on this website that, applying through MVV is an abuse of that visa and ECOs get really upset by it.  What path should I take if I want to marry my beloved legally in her own country? How can I prove that I am engaged to her, is there a particular document they look for? Because on our side, engagements are not usually recorded in a document.  Assuming that I have met her on a visitor visa and then I go back and apply for a fiance visa and enter the UK to marry her...will that work? It doesn't sound easy though and I would certainly appreciate any form of advice. "
696,"Change of ""home office"" address while on F-1 STEM OPT extension and awaiting H-1B lottery results","My situation is as follows:  I'm on F-1 STEM OPT working remotely from Dallas, Texas for a Company C with headquarters in state Y in the USA.  Company C filed H-1B for me with location as Dallas and location Y as two possible work locations on LCA. I'm still waiting for the results of the H-1B lottery.  Now my apartment lease in Dallas, Texas is getting over and I want to relocate to state Z for  personal reasons.  On STEM OPT, If I move to a new apartment, I have to update the SEVIS portal within 10 days of that change.  Will this change of address have any impact on the pending H1-B petition? I was not able to find any information regarding this on the web.   Until what point in time are F-1 STEM OPT rules applicable? When do the LCA/H-1B rules kick in?  Will LCA H-1B rules kick in only if   The H-1B petition gets picked in lottery and 2. The date is October 1st 2018?   My opinion is as follows:   As long as there is no change of status, I will continue to be dictated by the STEM OPT laws, in other words these LCA requirements are applicable to employees on H-1B and nobody else. So If my petition gets picked in the lottery, then I will ask my company to apply for an LCA amendment with change of address before October 1, 2018. Because even if they file an amendment now and the petition doesn't get picked in the lottery it will be a waste of money for them.  H-1B visa and its rules are valid only from October 1, 2018 in my opinion.  Also based on this : [website]  If your H-1B employee is moving to a new job location within the same MSA or area of intended employment a new LCA is not required.   So does that mean, in the event that my H-1B gets picked in the lottery and if I were to find a new apartment somewhere within Dallas Texas, I can avoid the LCA amendment ?  "

I'm a bit confused. Is it 20 days (until the end of H1B), or 2 months (until my AoS interview)?  My assumption was that now that I have EAD, it means I'm like a GC holder; I am authorized to work and no specific deadline to find a job unless otherwise I-485 is denied or USCIS asks to do so. Please advise. "

What I would like to know is:   What is the average yearly salary for a senior engineer in the automotive market in Coventry UK? How much of a chunk of my yearly salary would go to taxes? I investigated and the cost of living seems about the same (some things are cheaper and some others are more expensive) but in general terms, how much would be needed monthly to live in Coventry (family of 3).

706,Holding dual citizenship prior to country of birth outlawing dual citizenship,"As an EU citizen who's lived in the UK for 8 years, I am considering applying for British citizenship.  My birth country currently allows dual citizenship, but is considering outlawing this. While this is unlikely to happen, I do wonder what would happen if they did.  Could I lose my birth country's citizenship if I legally acquired dual citizenship before this was outlawed? And is there any precedent for this?  As a bonus/follow-up question, which is more country specific: If at some point in the future I had to choose between the two nationalities, I'd be inclined to keep my birth country's citizenship (as I would rather not lose the rights that come with a EU passport). However, if I lost my UK passport I'd probably be residing in the UK illegally - as I would never have obtained the necessary documentation EU nationals without a UK passport will need to stay in the UK post-brexit.  Is there any precedent for people losing their citizenship for the country in which they reside, and what would their options be if that happened? "

Now in December I wish to leave the US for five and a half months, approximately 175 to 170 days, which is less than six months. Can I go for this duration?

723,"Exchanging an EU driving licence for a UK when the EU licence was obtained by exchanging from an ""accession"" country","I'm resident in the UK and have been for around 1 year, moved here from EU (Belgium) and currently driving in the UK with a UK registered car, insurance etc on the Belgium licence (declared as EU licence to the insurance company).  However I obtained the Belgium licence by exchanging an ""accession country"" (e.g. Bulgaria) licence at a time when the accession country was NOT YET a member of the EU (but is now)  Can I drive indefinitely on the Belgian/EU licence in the UK in this circumstance, or exchange it for a UK licence? OR do I need to re-take the test in the UK since the original licence was issued ""outside the EU"" (at the time)?  Example text: ([website]  European Community/European Economic Area EC/EEA      A full, valid driving licence from an EC/EEA country allows you to drive in Great Britain (GB) until you are 70, or for three years after becoming a resident, whichever is the longer period.      If your driving licence has been previously exchanged from a non-EC/EEA country you can drive for up to 12 months from the time you first became resident. After this time, you must exchange your licence for a British one.   Other, slightly different version: ([website]  Please note that someone can drive in Great Britain for only 12 months if they got their EU licence by exchanging a non-EU licence.  "
724,Chances of US tourist visa acceptance after getting Canadian PR?,"I was in the US on an F-1 visa and after living there for nearly 6 years (education + work on OPT), I left the US to go to Canada before my US visa/STEM OPT expired. Never been denied visa/entry to US or any other country. I am a citizen of a third country.  I moved to Canada with a permanent residency (PR) and would like to know if I applied for a US tourist visa (in Canada) immediately after moving there, are there higher/lower chances of rejection or are they indifferent to my immigration status elsewhere? Does having the PR strengthen my ties to another country or do they weaken them because I'm not in my home country?  Or should I wait till I get my Canadian citizenship to qualify for entry without visa? Having a visa denial on my record will prove troublesome later on? Might as well not take the risk then?  I need the visa for occasional tourist visits or visiting friends etc. "

730,When spouse visa is refused to a Nigerian spouse of an EU citizen what is the appeal process?,"I am a Greek national living in Cyprus Republic for three last 3 years. I recently married my husband , a Nigerian national who I met in the Turkish side ( North Cyprus). Because of the problem with the island’s division he could not enter the Greek side unless he went back to Nigeria and requested a spouse visa to fly through the national borders. So this is what he did.  He applied for the visa at the consulate of Cyprus in Lagos and we did all the appropriate steps, including a bank guarantee of 850€. The consulate asked for additional information to verify the validity of our wedding. We were told that the ministry of foreign affairs in Cyprus was not convinced that the wedding took place in Istanbul Turkey ( which makes it valid) as opposed to the North side of Cyprus where it would not be recognized. We provided all the necessary documents, including tickets, boarding passes, hotel bookings and of course copies of the official Turkish wedding registration, as well as my copy of the wedding registration in Greece!  However without further discussion they refused him his visa saying that they could not verify the authenticity of the documents provided! I went myself today to the Consular Affairs department of the Ministry in Cyprus and found the person in charge of my case, showed them the original documents in my position and asked for the refusal to be lifted. To which their answer was that the documents are indeed OK, valid, but since they already refused they cannot change their decision. I have to go to high court and contest their decision, or wait 3 months to re apply.  Is this true? Can they do this? Do I have grounds to insist they re-examine the refusal? Since all our documents are correct? It is their mistake not ours!!! They confirmed that what I showed them is indeed a valid wedding certificate! Please advise what I can do! I cannot wait that long to reapply and the costs for lawyer’s and courts are too high! It is crazy! "
731,EU Blue Card - Poland,"I am a Indian national working for a Swiss investment bank at Pune, India. I recently landed my first international job in a new team, within the bank at Wroclaw, Poland. I received a copy of my work-permit today. I plan to fly to Wroclaw in the month of March, 2019. I had a few queries on the EU Blue Card Poland. I tried searching this forum for answers, and couldn't find them, so it would be best to create a new post.    How does the karta pobytu(TRC) differ from the EU Blue Card Poland? Can I apply for them, or does my employer need to apply for it? Is there an official site, with more details on EU Blue Card Poland? My spouse plans to travel with me as a dependent. If I get a EU Blue card in Poland, does my spouse have access to the labor market? Does she still need an employer to sponsor a work permit?    Cheers, Quasar. "

733,How to get software development job offer in Australia before immigrating (to get 5 extra points)?,"This is my first post in this community. Not sure if this is suitable to ask this here.  I am a software developer in the Research and Development section of a Pvt Ltd company in India. I want to move to Australia with a permanent resident visa (or not). I have taken the IELTS and got overall band 7.  I understand that I need to retake the test. But even if I do get a higher band and get PR, I won't feel secure to move to a different country (rather continent) without a job.  How can I get a job in a foreign country before moving there? Because if I have a job offer, it makes the process both easier and faster by increasing 5 points in the Australia Permanent Residency Immigration Points.  I am trying LinkedIn day-n-night but no luck getting a response.  Any suggestions?  I know this might sound like duplicate of this question, but it is NOT. The answer to the said question ends up telling that there is no way of getting job from outside, which is not what I want. Here I am asking for HOW TO GET from outside of Australia to get those 5 points "

Birth certificate is listed in the checklist for I-485 here. But I'm in New York City and my birth certificate is in China, and it's in Chinese. I assume I need it to be translated at a notary service.  Can I bring a photocopy of my birth certificate to a Chinese notary service in NYC? Do they only notarize original copy? Is the original copy needed in future processes, such as interviews with USCIS and what not?  Basically I just want to know if it's necessary to have my family mail the original copy to me from China. Thanks in advance! "
735,Get 'Niederlassungserlaubnis' after 33 months of Blue Card without A1,"I being in Berlin, for nearly 44 months with Blue card, and I'm planning to apply for 'Niederlassungserlaubnis' before my blue card renewal. The only document I'm missing is Deutsch A1 certificate. I can introduce my self and my family in Deutsch. Other than that my Deutsch is really bad. Will this be a problem?

This is not an excuse, but just a piece of information). Thank you. "
736,Settle in England,"I'm Italian and want to stay in England for more than three months, but even if I get a job, I'm not sure the employers will emit some certificate showing that I've worked there (this is the worst case but I need to contemplate it, cause I'm first travelling using workaway, where there are no 'service certificates' I guess.)   What exactly happens after three months staying in England? Do we need to go to some officers or anything like that to stay legally? Do we need any document besides our passport to settle?  "

I’m from a country that allows me to stay in the Schengen for 90 days without a visa.  Now if my French still need more practice, I would like to extend it. But since I enter it without a visa I need to apply for one.  My question is, can I apply for some visas (either student or maybe tourism) even after I enter it visa-free? Or do I have to first get out of the Schengen and apply there?  "

742,French Father - but adopted by American,"My biological father was French - but my mother divorced him when I was three. She remarried and was so angry at my French father that she got rid of every photo of him, and never even told me anything about him  It was not until I was 18 that I was able to locate him. I was still so young and not really aware any laws - plus my adopted father had just passed away so I was really in a state of shock. Thinking about citizenship was the last thing on my mind.  I have lived most of my adult life overseas, and now the way things are going in the United States, I do not feel safe living there - nor do I feel safe for my son anymore.   I believe I have read that if you do not apply before the age of 18 you can not get citizenship - despite having a French parent as I was not born in France but in the US.   However, I did not know my father until after my 18th birthday? Do you think if I provide the details to the French embassy - along with witness statments - that I might still be eligible? This case seems different and I was wondering if an exception might be made. "
743,Previous employer did not inform home office (UK) about my resignation,"I worked for a company in the UK on Tier 2 (General) work visa which is expiring in 2017. After working for some time I resigned from the job and returned to my country (after one month from last day of working) without waiting for any notice of curtailment from home office.   Now its been more than 1 year since I have left the UK and have got a new job offer from another company. The company is a sponsored employer and when they applied for COS they were told I am still employed under Tier 2 visa, which is not correct. Does this mean my previous employer failed to inform home office that I no longer work for them. How would it affect me if they did not inform ? Will home office refuse my application for new visa ?

744,Does my wife qualify for German pre- and post-natal care?,"Here is our situation:   I am a dual US and EU (non-German) citizen My wife is a US citizen and we married in the US We relocated here for my wife's work. She works for an American company and has a work/residence visa. She is technically on a temporary assignment and is paid in USD.   Our questions:   If my wife becomes pregnant, are we automatically eligible for Germany's pre- and post-natal healthcare services? Will my wife be eligible for German Maternity Leave and Job Protection?  "
745,Personal Liability insurance in the US,"Coming from Germany, I’m used to have a Personal Liability Insurance (Privathaftpflicht). It is not mandatory, but very recommended to have and not expensive (30-50€ per year).  What is the situation in the US: Are such insurances common place in the US? What is the right term to look for? And what else might be surprising for a German? "
746,How to find an English-speaking general practitioner in Germany?,"I am an Italian citizen who moved to Rostock two years ago.  I work as a full-time employee for a local company so everything (including my Krakenkasse registration) has been sorted out already.  I rarely get ill (on average I saw my doctor back in Italy maybe once every 2-3 years) but I you never know when you might happen to need a doctor... and it would be better to have already someone you know (I might also ask for a general check-up to build some sort of medical history here).  My problem is that my German is still basically non-existant (I speak in English in the office).  I contacted the Krakenkasse and they provided a website which lists doctors in the area, but there is no indication of language they are proficient with.  So, is there any way to find out except by trying to contact them first (by email or traditional mail, maybe) and describe my situation? Is there any particular strategy you are supposed to adopt in looking for a doctor, or do you just walk in the studio, talk to them and then they take you as a patient?  (In Italy it is semi-automatically assigned by area residence, even if you can subsequently change it).  Of course an Italian-speaking doctor would be even better, but I suppose that my chances would be even lower in this case. "
747,Australian Skill Assessment (ACS) document certification,"I am planning to apply for Australian PR under sub class 189/190. The assessment body is ACS (Australian Computing Society).   I have gone through their requirements, but I could not find anything about the following questions (or certain things about them were not clear).  Can someone please advise:   Certified documents: is it acceptable for a solicitor to certify all copies? How do you prove your work experience if you worked as a freelancer? I can see they are asking for reference letters on company letterhead stating I worked for them as a freelancer. Is there anything else I can provide to support this further, and are there any complications with this? Most of the people I worked for are not registered as companies or are no longer active (or were freelancers themselves). Do you have to submit the original Passport and hard copies as well?    "
748,Details on financial situation for EPFL PhD student,"I recently got what seems like a once in a lifetime offer to start a PhD at EPFL Lausanne under a world renown scientist running perhaps the leading research group in the world in this field. This is a bit of a dream come true, but there's an issue: I have a wife who neither speak french nor has any higher degree and we also have two small children.  The starting salary is 51k CHF/year, which I've heard is on the low end for Swiss salaries and would be lower than a job in industry in my European home country. That sum is non-negotiable, right? I'm wondering whether it would even be theoretically possible for us to accept this offer.  I've heard the job market is fairly xenophobic for openings outside of engineering/tech and again and it will probably take a while for my wife to learn french - how  hard will it be for her to find something?  If it takes a while for her to find a job, how hard will it be for us to live a decent existence in the meanwhile? We will be able to rent out our home while abroad, but I can't count on that netting more than 400-500 CHF/month.  I've heard Swiss universities give their employees ""family allowances"", and that you're also entitled to child subsidies from the Swiss government. Is this true? How about scholarships and other financial aids? How about TA:ing?  How does the daycare offered at campus work? Can the university help out in any way with housing or even employment for the spouse?  Like I said, this is an opportunity at a level I'm very likely not to receive ever again. So if it would be possible to somehow make it work, I would love to find a way. Any advice would be GREATLY appreciated, especially from those with personal experience. "
749,Where to go to obtain Spanish residency,"I am a USA citizen wanting to live in Spain for more than three months.  I looked at several websites about it.  The process as described by each is fairly consistent except for one detail: some sites say I have to do it at a consulate before going to Spain, and others say I must go to a comisaria or oficina de extranjería in Spain.  Which is it?  I am retired with more than enough income and do not plan to work, except for intermittent unpaid (volunteer) tasks.  I re-read all the websites, and I think the answer is that I need an other-than-average-tourist visa before I arrive, but I have to go to the authorities in Spain after arrival for the rest of the paperwork.  But it still isn't 100% clear.  If my interpretation is correct, why do all these websites omit half of the process? "
750,Can an L2 visa holder go back to their native country and resume their job wile waiting for the EAD work authorization?,"I’m moving to California on an L1 visa soon. My wife will also be traveling with me. We have the following in mind:   She travels to US with me. Applies for the EAD work permit and comes back to India. Resumes her job in India until she actually gets the work permit. Once she get’s the work permit, she quits her job in India, travels back to the US, and tries to find a job there ?   Is this legal ? "
751,Off-campus job and Internet earning,"As far as I know, international students can't work off-campus in the USA (according to the law). What about Google AdSense?  I have been working on my personal websites and I have activated AdSense on these websites. I have been getting paid in my native country (bank acount address is in my local address)and Google sends the payment to my local bank account.  Could I link my US bank account after I reach there? Will it be considered as off-campus job?  If I'm not allowed to get the money in the USA, I want to get that continuously in my native country as I'm recieveing right now.  "
752,Do I need a visa to enter the UK as the non-EEA spouse of an EU citizen?,"I am an Indian citizen married to a Romanian woman. We have a two-month-old child. I have been living in Romania for the last 6 and a half months. I have a Temporary Residence Permit from Romanian authorities. Now we would like to relocate to London together to find work and settle. My wife and son don't need a visa to enter and remain in the United Kingdom. Can I enter the UK with my residence permit or do I need some kind of visa? If I do need a visa, which visa do I need and how do I apply? "
753,How to register residency in Germany,"I'm Italian and I'm moving to Germany for work; I will also take my wife and 4 year old son.   How do I proceed to register residency? And once I register can my son go to school right away?  Details: Do I need a proper rent contract? Right now I don't have a rent contract since I've reserved an Airbnb; and I actually intend on staying in this same Airbnb at least until the end of the year (since my project is expected to end in December or January, if it extends or if I get another project or longer term employment then I'll probably look for a permanent place (buy or long'period rent) but right now I can't make a long term commitment).  Thanks! "
754,Migrating to Australia with another couple,"I have a dream to relocate to Australia in the next 5 to 10 years. My wife and I are planning to do this together with another married couple.  Right now, we're gathering as much information we can about the migration process, and the requirements for Australia. One thing I haven't really come across is migrating together with people who are not your relatives (children / spouse).  One the key ingredients of my dream to move to Australia is that this particular couple is there as well. I can't imagine that I (or my wife) will be happy if we are isolated completely from everyone we know. So, to combat depression I only want to migrate if the other couple can migrate.  But I doubt Australia recognises the four of us as a single 'family' wanting to migrate. I expect them to treat us as two married couples and each of us has to obtain visas individually. We'll most likely apply for Skilled Independent visas, but depending on the demand in 5 to 10 years, we might be able to apply for sponsored visas. It's likely to change in the future so I can't really provide more information regarding visas at the moment.  What can we do to 'synchronise' our migration as much as possible? Once we enter the migration process, are there ways to keep the progress of all applications going at the same pace? "

I am also insured in Israel, continuing to pay my premiums.  Now, I'm about to go on a week-long trip abroad - to the USA.  My questions are:   Does the Dutch health insurance cover me, typically?

756,The UK has voted to leave the EU. How does this affect UK/EU (and other) citizens living/working in the UK and vice-versa?,"On 23rd of June, 2016, the UK voted in a referendum to leave the EU. This leads to the following questions:   Are UK citizens working in the EU affected? Are EU citizens working in the UK affected? Are non-EU citizens working in the UK affected? What other consequences might 'Brexit' have on EU/UK citizens?   Also, see the related post on Travel.SE. "
757,Foreigners Marriage in France,"I wanted to ask you some help for marriage. I live in France with a visa Scientifique Chercheur which is soon going to expire on 19 September 2016. Before it expires, I'm going to submit my document to prefecture to renew it for the next year to get a carte de sejour which is surely going to be renewed. I want to marry my girlfriend; she is from Mauritius. I don't want to return to Mauritius and come back again as this is very expensive, a round-trip ticket costs at least 1500 euros for one person. So, I want to marry in France itself, and I have the following question:   Is this possible?  Do I have to wait to get my new carte de sejour     before marrying? Will my girlfriend allowed to come here in France     for marriage?   Thanks "
758,Getting a residency card in Italy as non EU spouse,"I am a non-EU citizen in Italy with an automatic Schengen visa (or visa waiver, I'm not sure it's called. But I can stay for 3 months). My wife is an EU citizen, but not Italian. We would like to get residency here. From what I've read on this website and on the site of the Italian police, we should be able to apply for residency.  We don't speak Italian and so fearing the actual details of doing this, we went to talk with an immigration lawyer. He insisted that I needed to go back home, wait until my wife registered as a resident, and then apply for the family reunion visa. Now I'm confused.  Does anyone know what the actual mechanics are for us getting residency here? Do I have to apply for a visa or can I simply register for residency like the website seems to imply? Has anyone done this and can tell me what to expect? "
759,"Moving to the UK and ""Brexit""?","My close friend is considering moving to the U.K.- well, England actually. She's here in Parkersburg, Western Virginia, USA (where I'm from) right now but was considering moving to the UK following a rather nasty breakup (too long to go into detail on that, complicated story). She's 32, and has a Canadian mom, dad born here, so technically dual U.S./Canadian citizenship IIRC (AFAIK she has both). She was born in Canada but lived here since she was five. I've known her since she was 13 (if it's relevant).  Anyway, she's wanted to move to the UK for a long time now; she's visited several times since she was about 15-16, seen a lot of areas (not just London and Buckingham Palace) and was considering moving to one of these cities:   Warrington, Cheshire (not sure what city would be around its size) ; she's visited it a few times, likes the leafiness of the area and thinks the people are friendly. She looked at areas like Birchwood, Sankey (? not sure if I spelt it right) and Risley/Glazebrook (I think Glazebrook's a backwater town, AFAIK) Tyldesley (near Wigan/Manchester). She said it seems pleasant enough, and that there seems to be some sense of community there. and that it was a good little town. Urmston/Trafford. As with the other two - leafy avenues, community spirit etc.  She's visited these areas when going to the U.K. so knows them - OK, not that well, but at least knows the basics of where it is on Google maps (roads, malls etc.).  She's told me that she's got no romantic ideals about the U.K. - she knows it's not going to be easy nor cheap to live there.  My friend does have skills which would be relevant in the U.K. - she has IT qualifications and some other ones as well (AFAIK it was maths and some business-y related stuff) but now the ""Brexit"" has come (I saw CNN's Robyn Curnow and Becky Anderson discussing this a few days ago) how would it affect her in terms of immigration? In terms of wealth, she's middle-class (don't know if owning a big Chevy SUV with a V8 and a Chrysler 300 sedan and a large house counts as wealthy or not).  AFAIK Kelly Evans from CNBC is an expat or was an expat in the UK but I think the info's outdated. Not certain though. Wikipedia claims she is but this is unreliable given that it's Wikipedia...  I know immigration is a hot-button issue in England (but would my friend face anti-immigration sentiment for being American)?  She said she wanted to keep her U.S./Canadian citizenship and gain British citizenship too so she can still visit home and Canada (her mom's Canadian, grandparents are Canadian, as are some of her cousins).  Anyway, would she face too many problems as an expat there and would it be easy for her to get a job? She said she would have moved years ago if the U.K didn't have onerous visa restrictions on Americans working there and said she hopes the ""Brexit"" will work and that she could get a job there.  I know there has been dollar-pound instability etc. as a result of this ""Brexit"" and AFAIK it'll be two years before everything's known about it.  She's gone on vacation now so that's why I'm asking on her behalf.  My basic question is... would it be easy for my friend to move to the U.K. with all the Brexit issues and immigration as hot-button topic in the U.K.? "
760,NHS GP services are miserably inadequate: what are my alternatives?,"I have a very good opinion of public services in the UK, maybe because I come from Southern Europe, where the public sector can be agonisingly inefficient. What astounds me is the ludicrous GP service provided by the NHS. Going to my GP practice means finding always a different doctor I have never met before, then explaining them who I am and why I came, with the disheartening certainty I will have to go though the very same process again when I am back for a follow-up visit. Why? Because I will find another random guy who hasn't got a clue of who I am, and I cannot reject them in favour of another one who happens to be nicer and more competent.  There is no bloody way this pathetic excuse of a healthcare can work. I am already starting to choose to neglect my health problems rather than interacting with that inane assembly line.  What are my options? In the country I come from the GP is not this sort of demotivated and dull automaton: she or he has an empowered role and effectively devises a long-term strategy for dealing with the patients and their needs. Even though one doctor has many patients, each patient has one and exactly one doctor.  Where can I reproduce this coherent scenario here in the UK? Would private GP practices do, or I am basically screwed and this is the way Britons think they take care of themselves? "

What paperwork do I need to be able to live permanently?","I am planning to temporarily retire in South Eastern Asia, (with my family - wife 2 kids) for a year or two. I am planning to live for about half of year in each Thailand, Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam, to try them out and see where I fit in best and then possibly settle in the one we feel is best for us. I am planning to start with Vietnam.  EDIT:  I would have around 1k EUR of passive income per month, no plans to work, citizenship is EU (Lithuania), no plans to change citizenship.

764,Are there any benefits for a disabled individual living in California? (green card holder),"In the country I'm coming from there are many benefits given to disabled people (depends on the severity), such as not paying income tax, monthly assistance in the form of a stipend, free public transportation, etc.  Are there similar benefits for a US permanent resident living in California (San Francisco in particular)? Also, are there any official bodies of the State/Government whose purpose is to help disabled people in general? "
765,"If I'm from another EU country, what do I need to do to permanently live and freelance in Germany?","I'm from Croatia and have been studying Computer Science for the past 5 years in Germany so now that I'm finished I'd like to stay a bit longer and make my living freelancing legally (open a small company - like GBR).  So what exactly do I need to do and where do I need to register to make this happen? Is opening a GBR enough to entitle me to do this?  Of course this is probably made a bit easier since in the mean time Croatia entered EU - however I'm unsure if some restrictions are in place for ""new"" EU countries (even though that qualified IT engineers are usually in demand).  On a side note - I'm also trying to estimate my monthly expenses related to this (not living expenses) - any tips there would also be much appreciated. I'll have to take care of my own insurance obviously (lets say 200 Euros monthly), etc. "

What are my rights between the two types of fines?    As in the appeal processes differences? Can i get points on a non uk license? Are there limits to fines that are placed by law?  Is there a cap for the amount of money any of these entities can ""claim"" for back for this?  "
768,Are there foreign-resident friendly US bank accounts or brokerage accounts?,I often find that US banks/brokerages are not able to deal with foreign addresses. I've had Vanguard tell me that I cannot roll over an existing 401k into a new IRA account because I couldn't give them a US address despite the fact that I already had an existing account with them. I had Scottrade explain that I can't transfer stocks because my old address is no longer valid and they won't let me add a new one. Sharebuilder explicitly states that you need to have a US address to open an account.  What banks/financial institutions are foreign resident friendly? 
769,How do I pay French taxes if I'm leaving the country before receiving the tax form?,"I worked from April 2013 until now (March 2014) in France, but now I am moving abroad (to Italy). How can I pay my French taxes on revenue for 2013? What about 2014?  I have not declared anywhere in France to where I am moving, so I don't believe they can send me the tax form abroad. "
770,What is the timeline for an H1B visa consulate interview?,"I'm in the process of applying for an H1B visa and I already have a company willing to sponsor me, but the instructions state that the application should be received in USCIS after the 1st of April, and if possible right that day (since the quota is filled very quickly according to previous years).  For the H1B, I also need to fill a DS-160 and schedule an interview at the consulate. The results of that interview take around a week or 10 days, and that leaves me with no time to do it before the 1st of April (I have to travel to get to the nearest consulate). I can't really find this googling but does the interview need to be done before the 1st of April or is it done afterwards? In the required 1st of April paperwork, USCIS doesn't mention the interview at all, so I'm guessing the interview is the last step of the process, done after the visa pre-approval roughly in October?

772,How do I file CA state taxes without a SSN or ITIN?,"Background: UK citizen, spent a summer as a J1 intern in California. Didn't get a SSN.  So I sent my US federal tax return and ITIN application to the US embassy London. Fairly sure that was the correct thing to do.

What's the process like/ what kind of documents do I need? Do I need a CA licence to buy a car? If I have no USA credit score, do I have to pay for the car upfront? What's the process with smog checks/ registration? How long does it take to get a CA licence? "
774,"Are UK Railcards restricted by nationality, or is residency enough?","Quite a few of the Travel.SE questions on UK train travel suggest getting a railcard to reduce the cost of travel. While not all train tickets can be discounted this way (some railcards are area restricted, others only start part way through the day, others need a certain number of people to travel together), and you have to buy the railcard, for someone doing a fair bit of UK train travel they can deliver savings.  Quite a few of the railcards have restrictions, such as only being available to older people, or to young people + those in certain FTE. Some are restricted by where you live, eg this one.  Assuming you're of the right age to buy a given railcard, living in the right area (if appropriate), what about nationality? Are there any restrictions on any of the railcards which would prevent expats living in the UK from buying or using them? "
775,"When returning to the UK from working in the EU, what do you need to show you activated your ""Treaty Rights"" WRT non-EU family members?","As I understand it, under Directive 2004/38/EC, an EU national who has only ever lived in their own country is governed by national rules when it comes to inviting non-eu family members to join them. However, as soon as you've moved elsewhere in the EU to work or study, and thus ""activated"" your Treaty Rights, the rules covering you on non-EU family members are the EU rules.  As I've understood from things like this and this, the Surinder Singh case ruled that once you've activated your Treaty Rights, if you move back to your country of citizenship, you remain covered by the EU rules, and you're no longer subject to the stricter national ones.  Something like a short holiday in France isn't enough to activate your Treaty Rights, so presumably just rocking up at the UK border from abroad isn't enough, and you'll have to show something to demonstrate to UK Immigration Officers that you have been exercising your Treaty Rights.  So, what would a UK citizen who's been living + working elsewhere in the EU need to bring with them, to prove to UK Immigration that their non-EU family members can be admitted under the EU rules? "

They are willing to pay me upto CAD 60K/annum before taxes. When checked on various tax calculators, the pay came to around 42K (~ CAD 3550/month) after the deductions.

777,Can I get a translation of a Japanese driver's license while in Germany?,"I received a Japanese driver's license while living in Japan (conversion of my US license) but my US license has since expired. I would like to drive some while traveling in the future. I am now living in Germany and no longer have a Japanese visa. Is anyone familiar with the process of applying for a translation at Japanese consulates while not being Japanese? Is this possible?  Edit: As a follow up, the Japanese embassy in Germany will translate a Japanese license into German and give an official document. You can then take this to the driver's license office in the area you live and have your valid Japanese license converted to a German license. The German driver's license office will hold your Japanese license. If you wish to retrieve your Japanese license you must give your German license back. I successfully completed this process and know others who have as well in the NRW state of Germany. For expats in Germany with a Japanese license, this exchange may be advisable as the German license lasts for 15 years. "

My spouse is a (non-Croatian) EU citizen.  I myself am not from the EU, thus I need a visa and a residence permit (carte/titre de séjour) to live in France.  What documents do I need to apply for a residence permit (carte/titre de séjour) for the first time after moving to France, and how does the process work?  I got a visa valid for only 3 mo, which allows me to enter France. The consulate told me that I must apply for a residence permit at the local Préfecture right after arrival, and that the residence permit will serve as a long term visa as well.  I am trying to find out what precise documentation I need to bring, and how the process will work exactly.  I want to make sure that everything will be fine because I heard that processing is very slow and any mistake will cause additional long delays.  Additional question: how does the process change if I want to be able to work part-time or as a freelancer?  I do not speak any French yet, which makes this rather difficult to research. "

781,Engineering Australia Assesment - Required Work Experience,"In their website Section 3.B. it is mentioned:     for those who have at least 1 year Australian work experience, and /   or at least 3 years Overseas work experience in their nominated   occupation or a closely-related occupation, then an additional   assessing service is available to provide an opinion on the skilled   employment claims. High-level evidence will be required to support any   claim of work experience as well as completion of this form.   Their PDF for Overseas Qualification Assessment:     6. I have limited engineering experience. Can I still apply for an   assessment of my qualifications?      Yes, you can still apply. Twelve months of engineering experience is a   guideline only. It is possible that you can demonstrate the three   competencies by referring to your undergraduate professional   engineering qualifications and the project/work experience elements of   your academic study. Applicants may however find writing the career   episodes more challenging without workplace experience from which to   evidence the  competencies.   So, do they give skill assessment for experience less than 3 years or not? Subclass 189 for instance require skill assessment from their authority (like Engineering Australia).  "
782,UK Tier 2 visa from a client I worked as a freelancer,"I'm a freelance software engineer from outside the EU. I have been working with a British client who owns a registered UK business for about two years.   He and I both plan for me to move to UK for a contract, and as far as I know, the Tier two skilled visa seems to cover my case.    My job field is listed in the shortage skills list. But practically, it's not that hard to find other British employees for the position.  I have a somewhat good profile, with good English. I'm not native English, but I'm confident I can pass the English language requirement exam.    If I have been working with him for some time, and if the employer explicitly needs to hire me, will freelancing help me to increase my odds in getting visa? I did not sign any official contract but we signed an NDA before starting work. I don't think an NDA matter though.   How long does it usually take to get a certificate of sponsorship?  "
783,US Citizen with EU Spouse who doesn't yet have a job,"My husband is an EU (Irish) Citizen and I am a US Citizen, we're currently living in the US. I have received a job offer from an academic institution to do research in Germany and he has not yet found a job.  As the spouse of an EU-Citizen what kind of work visa do I need? I know that I can enter Germany for 3 months without a visa, but then need to register. Is my visa/work permit then contingent on his job that he finds? Can I start work prior to the appropriate registration? Or does my paperwork have to process before I'm allowed to start working?  The academic institution can also help me get a work permit independent of his citizenship status but I'm trying to find the easiest way through the bureaucratic process. "
784,Open a Canadian bank account without being present in Canada?,"What are the ways for a non-resident to open a Canadian bank account—preferably without fees—without being physically present in Canada?  I know many (but not all) Canadian banks allow non-residents to open and operate accounts, though it seems most that do require you to apply in person, and many also have monthly fees.  For example:   TD Canada Trust has free chequing accounts which are available for non-residents, but you must open one in person at a branch. If you're an HSBC account holder in another country, they will happily open a Canadian bank account for you, though there's a one-time fee (over £100 in the UK) plus ongoing account fees of $25/month (unless you maintain a very large balance).   Are there any Canadian banks which offer simple, preferably no-cost chequing accounts to non-residents, and which don't require you to apply in person in Canada? "
785,Should I maintain my status quo in Poland or move right now?,"I came in Poland last month. I am studying MSc in a Technical university in Poland. I have an ambition also to do a PhD here. Here, living cost and tuition fee is affordable. So affordable that, it looks like a poor country. There are many homeless people everywhere in the streets. One, thing is very shocking: the university teachers get a very low salary, around 3000 PLN.  In the mean time, I got an MSc admission offer from Liechtenstein. They will charge a very low tuition fee. But, I found that the living expense is very high. So, I will need to do a part-time job to cover my living expenses.  Is Liechtenstein a good place to move? Will I find job?  If I have an ambition to stay in the academia, what should be the country I choose to study? Should I complete my study and then try to move or should I move right now? "

787,UK Nationality Applications and Previous Overstays,"I saw that the Home Office has published new guidance for people applying for British Nationality (March 2015).  Most notably, the section on good character has been profoundly expanded; it now includes things like simple cautions.   The guidance also advises that applications will be subject to increased scrutiny on that basis.    Against that backdrop, there are lots of people who have committed minor immigration offenses like overstaying between successive applications or entering via Dublin when they weren't supposed to do that.  In lots of cases the Home Office 'overlooked' the violation and granted the visa anyway.   Other people have been granted leave outside the rules (for compassion or some other situation where circumstantial practicalities warranted granting a visa outside of the rules).    If they find that a person overstayed between successive applications on the Tiered route, can they refuse a nationality application DESPITE having granted leave previously?  The guidance seems to indicate that this is a possibility.  What other types of offenses that have been previously overlooked that might result in a refusal to naturalise an applicant? "

Can I get a study visa as a retiree?    Will I need to leave the country every few months because I'll be on a 90 day visitor's visa? If so, what's the most economical way of doing this?  "

790,Israel immigration on work visa,"I wonder: when you enter Israel on a work visa (B1), what's the rules on (a) employment and (b) extension?  Is it anything like the USA system where your stay is initially tied to the employment with a sponsor company (hence if you leave your job you must find work with another H1-B sponsor quickly)? Or is it more like the EU system where any similar job with another company will do?  As for extension, is there ever the prospect of the temporary work visa status turning permanent, or even yielding Israeli nationality? Or is Jewish aliyah the only way to permanent citizenship? "

792,ZAB degree assessment initial review for blue card,"I received a job offer for a Software Developer position in Germany. I was asked by the German Embassy to get a ZAB assessment of my bachelor's degree in order for them to grant me a work visa. After sending my university documents and contract to the ZAB, they replied with the payment details and an initial review that says:     Eine erste Durchsicht Ihrer Unterlagen hat ergeben, dass es für Ihren Abschluss keine Entsprechung im Hochschulbereich gibt. Nach derzeitigem Stand wird die Bewertung Ihres Abschlusses voraussichtlich auf der Ebene eines deutschen Reifezeugnisses sowie Teilen eines Grundstudiums in Informatik erfolgen.      Bitte überlegen Sie, ob Sie unter diesen Voraussetzungen die Ausstellung einer Zeugnisbewertung wünschen und geben Sie uns eine kurze Rückmeldung, ob wir mit der Bearbeitung Ihres Antrages fortfahren sollen.   Google translation:     A first review of your documentation has shown that there is no equivalent in the higher education sector for your degree. According to the current state, the evaluation of your degree is expected to take place at the level of a German university degree as well as parts of a basic course in computer science.      Please consider whether you would like to receive a certificate evaluation under these conditions and give us a short confirmation as to whether we should continue to process your application.   I am confused with this statement: ""there is no equivalent in the higher education sector for your degree"". As far as I understand the requirements for Blue card, I need to have an assessment which states that my degree is equivalent to a university degree in Germany.  My university is listed in Anabin with H+ status but my degree is not listed under the university.  Is this initial review normal? Should I just send the a confirmation to continue my ZAB application?  Did I understand correctly that they would compare my bachelor's degree with a German bachelor's degree as I requested in my application? deutschen Reifezeugnisses has different translations in Google, sometimes it means ""German school leaving certificate"" other times it is ""German university degree"" "

794,Dutch citizenship by naturalization regulations,"I currently reside in the Netherlands as a scientific researcher. I have a valid residence card and employment contract. There are some prospects for me to begin a PhD at a large university here. However I would like to make sure that this will not jeopardize my ability to obtain Dutch citizenship in the next few years. In my current understanding and according to the IND website Naturalization requires that one reside in the Netherlands for an uninterrupted period of at least 5 years.  However this only encompasses individuals with a valid residence permit for ""non-temporary purposes of stay...at the time of the naturalization ceremony"". The definition of ""temporary"" versus ""non-temporary"" is given by this link.  The link lists ""Study"" as a ""Temporary"" purpose of stay. I therefore have two questions:   Does a fully funded, 5-year technical PhD count as mere ""study""? May I use 5 years as a PhD to justify citizenship? If not, can an individual still apply for citizenship after the end of the PhD? Say for example I finished my PhD in 4 years and then secured a job, continuing to live in the Netherlands for another year under a regular employment contract. Would the years spent as a PhD candidate accrue and count as regular residency?   Thanks and look forward to your answers. "

Will I have to pay fees?  I have been told so but it doesn't seem like that reading around on guides.  For instance I didn't find useful information on the Ministry of Finance Sri Lanka Customs Department. There they simply say:     Gem stones purchased in Sri Lanka can be exported either by Air freight or hand carried by the owner.""   Also this German embassy page states:     Sri Lanka's most celebrated export Blue Sapphires, Cats Eyes, Rubies, Star Rubies, Star Sapphires, Alexandrites, Moonstones, Zircons, Garnets, Amethysts, Topaz, etc. are offered for sale at the Sri Lanka Gem &amp; Jewellery Exchange, 310 Galle Road, Colombo 3.

796,UK driving licence photocard expiring - implications for non-residents,"Only UK residents can renew the photocard, and the official advice for UK licence-holders living abroad is to get a licence in their new country of residence.  GB licence holders:      If you’re moving abroad      You can’t register your new address on your British driving licence.   Contact the driving licence authority in your new country of   residence.   NI licence holders:     If you permanently move to another country, DVA can’t register your   new address on your Northern Ireland driving licence. You’ll need to   contact the driving licence authority in your country of residence for   information on exchanging.   This leaves two questions which are not answered clearly on the government website:   How should one drive when visiting the UK after the UK licence expires? If one returns to the UK, can the expired licence be renewed?  "

My mother was Dutch at birth and naturalized in Australia independently of her parents at age 17. She was married to my Dad when I was born.  From my understanding this may make me latent Dutch.

I don't intend to move furniture over, but I do have, oh, between 3 to 5 cubic meters of personal belongings I'll be taking with me. Nothing is packed at the moment. but a large part of it could fit into plastic and cardboard boxes and fabric pseudo-boxes I had used to pack when moving here.  How should I do this? Specifically,   Is there more than one kind of shipping option that I should consider? Say, sea vs air? Or maybe - different ports of destination? Price/speed tradeoffs? Where do I look for the appropriate moving company (and should it be Dutch)? Is it worthwhile to pack everything myself, or for the price I'm paying should I just let the movers take care of it?  "
799,Using CPT for summer work authorization on an F1 visa while OPT Application still Pending,Is anyone aware of whether it is okay to use the CPT (curricular practical training) while your OPT (optional practical training) application is still pending?   I am currently waiting for the cancellation of my OPT application to go through so that I can apply for CPT but my start date is coming up so I was wondering if it is fine to use the CPT even thought the OPT application is still pending (but soon to be cancelled)? 
800,Applying for a student visa in France. I have a question regarding a previous visa and stay in Germany,"I am a chemical engineer and I have plans for Master studies in France. I already have approval from the University and now it's time to apply for a student visa. I am from Tunisia by the way.  I traveled to the EU before for internships (Belgium for 3 months and Germany for a year). Near the end of my internship in Germany (end of 2015), my employer suggested a 3 months extension of my internship (possibility of employment by then and quite a load of work to handle by that time). The problem was that as a non-EU citizen I could not have an internship in Germany for more than a year. So I applied with a contract of ''vocational training'' along with the necessary documents (letter from the employer, forms...). I applied 2 weeks before the end of my visa and I had concerns that the application will take more time than that. Unfortunately, it did take a lot of time and I ended up waiting until the last day where I went there to check the situation.  Also, my application was denied. They said that the reason was that my income in the contract was not justified (even though that it's stated that I had a little more than the minimum wage). That day, I signed a document there saying that I understand the situation and that I had to leave Germany in 14 days max (they were very clear about that). I had that document with me at the airport and handed it to customs. I got a regular stamp on my passport and the agent wrote on top of it GÜS.  Does anyone know what this means exactly? Is it considered as a visa refusal (I am reading that you get a refusal stamp in this case?)?  Taking into account that I am applying for a student visa in France soon, can this affect my application? Should I state this as a visa refusal in the visa forms?  Thank you for your help!  EDIT: Corrected spelling + Please let me know if a detail in my description is not clear enough. Thank you for your time :)  EDIT 2: Hello @lafemmecosmique and @phoog, I was just re-checking the documents that I received back then and I thought to update the info that I had. So I have a document from the Bundesagentur fur Arbeit (Labor Agency) and 2 other documents from the officer at the foreigner office.    The document from the labor agency states clearly that my qualifications do not match my remuneration (I applied with a vocational training contract).  The interesting thing that I found out after translating the exact text from German in the document I signed in the foreigner office is the following:   ""Date, address and name of the officer, Mr XX speaks to the foreign authority in city on this day without being asked. Mr XX is pointed out that the employment agency has rejected his application for further employment. Mr XX is pointed out that he has to leave the federal territory. Mr XX decides to cancel the application for the extension of the residence permit from 18.08.2015.""  Do you guys have new explanations based on this new information? It says that I decided to cancel my application to extend my residence permit.  Thank a lot for your time! I really appreciate your help. "
801,Regarding student visa:-- What does it mean when visa officer asks ''What is the scope of your course''?,I have to attend a student-visa interview after a few days.

What is the scope of your Master course/programme?   Please reply asap. Thanks a lot. 
802,Eligible for Germany bluecard with a non-anabin-listed degree and a H+/- university?,"I'm in the process of applying for a German 3 months work permit in order to be able to apply for a Blue Card. One of the requirements, as the embassy states, is that the university degree should be recognized in the Anabin database.    I'm holding a 4-year software engineering degree from a university listed as H +/-  in the Anabin database. However, I couldn't find my ""exact"" degree title there.  In the degree listing, there were a lot of duplications with just different spellings! Seems like that there's a way to submit your degree and there's no actual reviewing there to recognize spelling errors, etc.  I found my degree category, but it only has 2 degrees listed; ""English literature"" and ""Environment Health"". Non-related to software engineering. IMHO, it doesn't seem to be a matter of scientific recognition, the list is just incomplete.  Am I going to be eligible for an EU blue card with a non-listed degree and H +/- university? Should I get a ZAB comparability statement instead? Embassy stated that your degree is either recognized or you're going to need a letter from ""Kultusministerkonferenz"". What's my next step? I'd appreciate any hints here.  Update: Seems like that ZAB is part of ""Kultusministerkonferenz"". "
803,Possible delay in F1 visa approval : What can I do?,"I have been accepted into the PhD program offered by the Molecular and Cell Biology department at a US university and I am supposed to join this August. My F1 visa appointment is on 25th July.  Now classes at the university start on 21st August. Considering my department is Biology (although my research will be in Computational Biology), there is a very high chance for me to get the 221g which would delay getting the visa by a month (Most Biology students are getting the 221g of late since it is in the 'Technology Alert List'). As a result, I would arrive US possible after start of class, and seeing this there is very high probability that the immigration officer would deny me entry. I asked the officials at my university regarding arriving late and they said -      If you arrive later than the ""report to school"" date on your I-20, the immigration officer at the port of entry has authority to turn you away. If you are allowed to enter the United States but are not allowed to register for classes, you will be in violation of your visa status.   My attempts to solution-    I asked some students I know who study in the US regarding this and one of them suggested -      What you can do is, travel on a tourist visa. Reach there, get your TB test done anywhere in the states and wait for your visa to come.   Also, write to the university, they'll be able to help you better.   I asked the school officials about this. They provided me a link related to the different visa types for students at the university ([website]My school permits qualified students with the B1/B2 visa (tourist visa) to enroll in classes, and to engage in degree-seeking study. However, immigration regulations specifically prohibit study in the U.S.  If you currently hold B-1/B-2 nonimmigrant status and would like to enroll in classes, you may apply for a change of status to F-1 Processing for a change of status commonly requires approximately 6 months, so plan ahead.   ​ So, ​since I can't study on tourist visa (according to immigration regulations), and change of visa to F1 generally takes 6 months, I would not be able to execute this plan right now.   Question -  My question then is, can you suggest another course of action, given my current situation (for example, is there something I can say to visa interviewer? OR can I travel by some other visa type? OR is there something wrong in my current analysis of the situation?). Any help would be really beneficial for me, as I do not wish delaying joining the institute by another semester. "
804,How long in advance to look for a shared flat in London,"I have been accepted at an university in London and I will start my doctoral studies in the end of September. Given my financial situation as well as the cost of life in London, I decided to look for a room in a shared flat. My question is: how long in advance should I start looking for a flat? On the one hand, I don't want to leave things for the last moment, but on the other hand it seems to me that is quite difficult to secure a room many months in advance (most ads I have seen so far are looking for people for the next couple of weeks). It seems to me that this varies wildly from country to country (e.g. here in Germany people seem to start looking a lot more in advance than in other countries I have lived before), so what would be a reasonable time frame for me to start searching without becoming too stressed with the situation? Would a month suffice?  "
805,Is it possible to work in Germany with a small criminal history?,"I am not yet convicted of a crime but I am being charged with a felony that will most likely be reduced to a misdemeanor with a year probation here in the United States. It's non violent, and not drug, theft, or firearm related that took place over two years ago. But yet it doesn't quality to be expunged.  It's basically trespassing but I'm fearful of my chances of moving to Berlin in the future when I graduate university.   Is it possible to get a visa and move to Germany with this on my record? Perhaps if I get a certificate of good conduct? "
806,Price ranges for private schools in Spain,"I'm researching the situation with schools in Catalonia, Spain and am trying to understand if there is such thing as an affordable private school for children in terms of fees? Anything in the range &lt;= 400-500 EUR per month for tuition? Or are they mostly expensive and even more expensive? I know I can check out lists and websites of schools themselves, but it is a bit difficult as there are multiple fees involved and it is not always clear to assess the full cost of education. I should admit though that, unlike with public schools, there are lots of lists of private schools in the internet which is somewhat helpful. "
807,Child born to Indian and Pakistani parents,"What would be the citizenship status of a child born in India to an Indian father and Pakistani mother? My understanding is that he/she will remain both: an Indian and Pakistani until 18/21 years of age.   Will Pakistani citizenship be automatically renounced when an Indian passport is obtained and vice versa?   What happens when the Indian or Pakistani parent switches nationality? Will the child still have the option of choosing at 18/21?  How will the child travel between the two countries? Will he be able to obtain ID documents (besides a passport) for both countries?  If the child remains a dual citizen until 18/21, which of the two's passport is easier to obtain once the other's has been initially chosen?  EDIT: It looks like both the Indian and Pakistani citizenship acts have been drafted by the same person--probably because it is just some tweaking of the relevant British laws.   3) Apparently, Pakistan only allows dual nationality with 19 countries and India is definitely not one of them.  Under normal circumstances, the child would have been able to obtain a NICOP for Pakistan and OCI for India which would have granted him/her all the rights of a citizen except voting. Unfortunately, neither of the two countries will grant this when the applicant has any ties with the other. India won't even grant an OCI to a child who has never held citizenship of Pakistan if any of his grandparents were ever Pakistani.  4) So the child won't be able to chose whether he or she wishes to obtain Indian or Pakistani citizenship when he turns 21 if he/she gets a Pakistani passport? Is the same true for Pakistan? What happens if he/she gets a Pakistani passport before 21 and then decides to renounce it in favour of an Indian passport within the six months?  5) I know people who have been born in India and subsequently obtained Pakistani citizenship while being under 21 who required (and still require) Indian visas to enter. I also know people who have done the opposite. It seems that in practice, if you are an Indian you cannot be a Pakistani at the same time.   Which citizenship would give the child an easier time to switch the other if and when he/she decides to do so?     7A. (1) The Central Government may, subject to such conditions, restrictions   and manner as may be prescribed, on an application made in this behalf, register as an   Overseas Citizen of India Cardholder—   (a) any person of full age and capacity,—   (i) who is a citizen of another country, but was a citizen of India at   the time of, or at any time after the commencement of the Constitution;   or   (ii) who is a citizen of another country, but was eligible to become   a citizen of India at the time of the commencement of the Constitution; or   (iii) who is a citizen of another country, but belonged to a territory   that became part of India after the 15th day of August,1947; or   (iv) who is a child or a grandchild or a great grandchild of such a   citizen; or   (b) a person, who is a minor child of a person mentioned in clause (a); or   (c) a person, who is a minor child, and whose both parents are citizens of   India or one of the parents is a citizen of India; or   (d) spouse of foreign origin of a citizen of India or spouse of foreign   origin of an Overseas Citizen of India Cardholder registered under section 7A   and whose marriage has been registered and subsisted for a continuous period   of not less than two years immediately preceding the presentation of the   application under this section:    Provided that for the eligibility for registration as an Overseas Citizen of   India Cardholder, such spouse shall be subjected to prior security clearance by   a competent authority in India:   Provided further that no person, who or either of whose parents or   grandparents or great grandparents is or had been a citizen of Pakistan,   Bangladesh or such other country as the Central Government may, by notification   in the Official Gazette, specify, shall be eligible for registration as an Overseas   Citizen of India Cardholder under this sub-section   Edit: Would the following setup work? 1) Get an Indian passport 2) Apply for a Pakistan CRC (child ID card)--the Pakistani mother's ID is all that is needed to apply for it. 3) Apply for a Pakistan visa  In essence the child will be using a visa to travel into Pakistan where he will exercise the rights of a citizen. This way neither country will know he has documents from the other.  "
808,How far apart should my bank statement date be and my application for spouse visa UK?,"I am preparing for my UK spouse visa application.

809,French Work Permit has expired and appointment to get récépissé is almost two months away,"My situation is as follows: I have been resident in France for almost five years now, first on a student visa and then on a work permit. A few months ago as the date of expiry of my work permit approached, I followed procedure on the Prefects website and sent in my application for a new work permit. There was no response for almost six weeks and then ironically the day my work permit expired I got a letter from the Prefect informing me that my appointment to collect my ""récépissé"" (temporary work permit) is in six weeks. In the time I lived in Paris, the Prefect always made sure I was given a récépissé before my current permit expired. I have emailed them and they replied I should stick to the dates in my convocation.   The problem is between now and then I have no valid work permit. Is this a problem for my employer? I also live in a border town and am regularly stopped by the police and immigration (douane), will I be in trouble as I have nothing but an expired permit (titre de séjour) and a letter giving me an appointment in six weeks? I am also assuming this means I cannot cross the border at all? Is there anything I can do to get out of this situation? "
810,How to drive legally while visiting in the US as an expat US citizen with no US state license,"I am an expat US national in Sweden and am trying to find out if I can drive a car/rent a car legally when I come back to visit in Ohio without using an Ohio or other US state driving license. My Ohio license is about to expire and I cannot renew it since I do not have a permanent Ohio address. I do have a legal Swedish driving license and understand I can also get an international one based upon this. Somewhere long ago I came across that this generally was a 'catch 22' type of situation – US citizens must drive on valid US licenses when in the US AND US citizens not permanently residing in a given state cannot get a drivers license. Not sure this is actually the law, hence hoping for some up-to-date info on this from the experienced here.  So (a) can I as a US citizen drive legally in the US (Ohio) on my Swedish driving license?  (b) Can I use, do I need or is it better to use an international driving license instead?  Sweden is listed as a signatory to the 1949 Multilateral Road Traffic Convention. And I cannot find an answer to my specific question on the Ohio BMV site. Thanks in advance for any help you can offer. "
811,File for emergency card?,"I was curious if there was such a thing as filing or applying for a medical emergency card for a green card holder?

She was given a green card immediately when entering the United States. She also recently got her SSN.   My wife keeps mentioning to me that I need to help my mother in law obtain an emergency medical card. However, I don't know if there is such a thing.  She is not a UN refugee I am responsible for her here on he US. So she does not get welfare or a bridge card or any benefits. However, my wife insists she can still apply for an emergency medical card. We are in the state of Michigan and cannot find much information about this.

815,Shoes indoors - is this common?,"So back in the mid 2000s, I was an international student at a US university. I had the assumption that everyone in America wore shoes or slippers indoors, an assumption that was created from hearsay, so I bought a pair of flip flops that cost a dollar, and wore them each semester.   The thing is, is that I never got to be barefoot. I was always and everywhere barefoot when I grew up so going for months without the opportunity of being barefoot was in hindsight a small but real stressor (I would at least take showers barefoot in the shower stalls, where on average five or six people would share two stalls; they were relieving).   The funny thing is that I went to US and UK schools when I was young, but not in the US or the UK -- I lived in countries that had schools for American or UK nationals that also accepted international students, and thus never expected a culture transition to happen. I had not realized that back then I never encountered a house that wore shoes indoors; my parents wiped the floor clean before going in so that the dirt never touched our feet, and my friend's house that I visited never wore shoes either.  In other words, when I first stepped foot in the US mainland, it came as a culture shock that wearing something indoors could be so darn uncomfortable.   My question is : in the case of dorm rooms, is it inevitable that unless you want your feet to pick up diseases, your feet will have to be wearing something? Or can you still attempt a major clean up of floors or carpets in your dorm room such that you could free your feet? What if you have roommates who don't share the same custom?   My other question is : I found that school custodians deep clean carpets in dorm rooms during the summer, but does that mean I can go barefoot on carpets? Could someone enter the room after that deep clean wearing shoes such that the deep clean is rendered meaningless if you were to aspire going barefoot?   Last but not least : Should you give up trying to go barefoot if you are in college dorm rooms, and only try something like that out in your own house? "

821,Intended day of arrival after course start date - UK Tier 4 General Student,"I am from Mexico and I have received a scholarship to start a PhD in the UK on 15 March. I have applied for a Tier 4 visa and my biometrics were taken two days ago (20 February). When I filled my application I wrote that my intended day of arrival would be 25 March because of visa processing times (my course starts on 15 March). However, one day before my biometrics were taken, I was informed from my sponsor that I needed to arrive to the UK no later than 8 March. So, I had to pay for the priority service to have my visa in time. The problem is that I forgot that my intended day of arrival was 25 March and now I need to travel on 8 March.  I haven't received my visa and I have not been informed that my visa is being processed, but I don't have time to cancel it and start again. I don't know what dates I will have in my entry clearance. According to the Tier 4 guide, it says that I will have my vignette valid from 7 days before my intended day of arrival or 1 month before my course starting date, whatever is later. So, I think my vignette will be valid from 18 March (7 days before 25 March). What can I do? 8 March is 7 days before my starting course date. Can I have my vignette stamped if I enter early? I would show them all my supporting documents (CAS, acceptance letter, the scholarship acceptation, a previous UK visa for my master) and I would explain my case, but I don't think it would be possible to have my vignette stamped. Any advise?  I know I can enter as visitor and then re-enter to get my vignette stamped but my sponsor is demanding me to have my vignette stamped on 8 March. "

But on several other sites it says,     If you are working with a Canadian employer on a temporary work permit and the employer has made you an offer for permanent employment, you may be eligible to apply for your permanent residency under the Federal Skilled Worker Program. Such an offer is referred to as arranged employment. The temporary worker will have to meet the necessary points required under the Foreign Skilled Worker Program. Points are awarded based on factors such as the applicant’s education, age, adaptability, language skills and the job offer. This process can take up to 12-18 months.   Why would it take 12-18 months? With an express entry profile that has more than the cut off, shouldn't it take 1-2 months? Because invitations are sent almost every month right? Any advice would be much appreciated. "
834,Diplôme en France when renewing titre de séjour?,"I have been living in France for three years (at first on a work visa) with my wife who is a French national.  I recently had a rendez-vous at my local préfecture to renew my existing titre de séjour ""vie privée et familiale"" which I received last year.  Everything went fine at the rendez-vous and they gave me a receipt, but now I've received a letter asking for two things, one of which is unreasonable (what else is new?) but the other completely bizarre and unexpected:     Afin de compléter votre demande de titre de séjour, je vous invite à envoyer au plus vite les documents énumérés ci-dessous :         Acte de mariage de moins de 3 mois   Diplôme en France      They want a response ""dans un délai de 7 jours"" and who knows what that means. The letter is dated 22 fev. and I didn't see it until today, the 28th (it's postmarked the 25th).  First of all I gave them an acte de mariage but apparently they want a more recent copy? How could I possibly obtain that so quickly? I went ahead and ordered a new copie intégrale, but that will obviously take a few weeks to arrive.  More importantly however is the completely bizarre request for a ""diplôme en France"". Is there some meaning to that I'm missing besides just ""French diploma?"" Obviously I do not have such a thing. Nor have I ever been asked for that, nor obviously is it mentioned in the relevant list of documents. I almost wonder if it could be a mistake. There is no reason for them to believe I have a French diploma, nor should it be relevant for vie privée et familiale. Has anyone else seen this before?  "

837,Time-frame of cap exemption & validity of a new H-1B visa for former H-1B holder,"I have a specific question regarding the time-frame of cap exemption granted for former H1-B visa holders. I have read various conflicting/confusing articles on this online that the time-frames become muddled due to verbiage.  I have held a H1-B visa from October 1, 2012 through June 6, 2014  (20 months &amp; 6 days) when I resigned my job and left the USA for PhD studies elsewhere. Having completed the PhD, I am now interested in returning to the USA for work. I am currently looking for employment in for-profit private companies different to original one that sponsored my original H1-B visa.  The questions are:   Until what calendar date am I exempt from capping for my next H1-B visa? If a company does indeed sponsor a H1-B, how long will the newly issued visa be valid for?  "

839,EEA Family Permit from outside UK after already moving to UK,"My wife (Italian citizen) and I (Commonwealth but not EEA citizen) recently moved to the UK. I had done quite a lot of research about the immigration rules before we arrived, but admittedly mostly read about what the law says rather than what people's actual experiences were.  My wife will be working here, so is a qualified person.  Our arrival at Gatwick went very smoothly, with a friendly immigration officer checking our marriage certificate and then stamping ""Admitted to the United Kingdom under the Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2016"" in my passport.  I then quickly discovered that the advice on the gov.uk website saying ""You can apply for a residence card [...] to confirm your right of residence. You do not have to apply but it will make it easier to prove your right to live and work in the UK"" should probably be read as ""You should apply for a residence card if you want to be able to do anything official in the UK"". It's very difficult to open a bank account or rent a house, for example, without a residence card.  I also quickly discovered that not every immigration officer understands the rules. We took a weekend trip to Paris, and on the way back the UK immigration officer insisted that I only had the right to live in the UK if my wife and I had been living in a different EEA country first (seemingly, he was confused with the Surinder Singh rule for UK nationals, which clearly doesn't apply since neither of us are a UK national). He did eventually relent (saying that since I'd already been allowed in once, he would let me in again, but reiterating that he didn't think it was right) but was very unhappy that I didn't have a residence card.  Applying for a residence card right now is very inconvenient because I need to travel regularly for work. If I apply, at a minimum I will be without my passport for a month (if I immediately request it back after placing the application) but possibly more. My country of citizenship doesn't offer additional passports for this type of situation.  Because of this, I have considered traveling to another EEA country and applying for an EEA Family Permit there. The EEA Family Permit seems to usually take less than 10 days to be granted. I understand that this should then let me travel in and out of the UK without any trouble for six months, and then I should be able to schedule 1-1.5 months without my passport somewhere into those six months to get the residence card. My questions are:   Is this option open to me considering that I am already living in the UK?  What should I list as my permanent address? We have already rented an apartment in the UK and I would prefer to list this since it's my correct permanent address. Will it raise an issue though? Are there other, better options for my situation?  "
840,Sweden Personnummer,"I'm a Pakistani citizen who has previously lived in Sweden for 3 years on permanent residence against my own self employment visa, but I have since moved on. The Swedish version of what is called social security number, social insurance number, government service number, or otherwise, is the personnummer. I got a personnummer assigned shortly after arriving and registering in the country. Does this personnummer remain valid for the rest of my life, or is there some expiry? How do I check the status of my permanent uppehalstilstand, which is the Swedish version of permanent residence? I have a sticker on my passport which says validity is indefinite. "
841,How can I pay NHS surcharges for children born in the UK?,"I have been in the UK on a Tier 2 visa since April 2015. How can I pay NHS surcharges for my children who were born in the UK? My children have never travelled outside of the UK, so I haven't applied for visas for them as my dependents.   Next month, I am applying for an extension to my visa. Do I need to apply for their Tier 2 visas as dependent family members, or can I apply after I am granted Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR)? "
842,Missed UK entry clearance valid until date. What now?,"It's a bit of a strange (stupid) case: I was granted an entry clearance for a UK Tier 1 visa (applied from South Africa). For numerous reasons (some medical), I couldn't travel before the ""Valid until"" date. But I didn't pay sufficient attention to the date or make any attempts to change it.  Given that I've already been granted a visa that was supposed to last a year, will I have to start the entire process again? Or could I just apply for entry? As I'm writing this, that second option seems highly unlikely but figured I'd ask. Any guidance would be appreciated. "
843,UK job offer - Non EEA with EEA spouse,"I'm a Mexican national married to a German. We have two kids with dual nationality and have lived in Mexico since we got married five years ago. I have a job offer in the UK and we are planning to move there soon. Do we need to apply for an EEA Family Permit for me to be able to take the job, open a bank account, etc? My wife will quit her job here, we have savings to demonstrate we can live there (she will be looking for a job when we arrive) and I have a letter confirming the job offer, salary, etc. Mexicans don't need a visa to enter the UK and I have read that the EEA permit for non EEA spouses is mainly for nationals of countries that require a visa to enter the country. Can you please clarify? Many thanks "

What I want to know is, can she visit me for the 90 days and can she do that constantly? How long can she stay with me? How and what can we do to stay together?  Or, how can I get to America to live there? I know you need to show you can support yourself while staying there (I can't) and you need to find a job before going there. What other options do we have? (Even marriage, that will come!)  Also my mom, dad and I want to go to America. We want to get out of here. How can we get there? We are basically dead down. we can't find a job. We live at our old work, which closed down after the boss committed suicide. So we are stuck.

848,When will my spouse be eligible for Indefinite Leave to Remain?,"My spouse entered the UK on a fiance visa in July 2013 and we married in October of that year. She was granted a married partner visa in December 2013. The married partner visa was valid for 2 and a half years and was renewed in May 2016 and expires in February 2019.  My impression had always been that 5 years of continuous residency was required to apply for indefinite leave to remain, but I have also heard a figure of 10 years being discussed. Can anybody confirm which duration is correct? Also, based on her first entry on the fiance visa in July 2013, would that make her eligible to apply in July 2018 or does the time start from the married partner visa? "

851,Indian student going to study in France. Is the original birth certificate mandatory?,"I am an Indian student going to Grenoble Ecole De Management, France, later this year. While preparing my documents, I was told that apostilled and translated original birth certificate would be needed for several administrative procedures, including housing benefit, health insurance and most importantly, to renew my visa for the second year.  Unfortunately, I do not have an original birth certificate. I was born at home in a village in Kerala in '84 and have been domiciled in Bangalore ever since. While joining school, I believe my parents got an affidavit of birth from a notary/lawyer and used it for admission. I don't have this document with me anymore.  I am in a fix now. I do not know whether I can proceed with my plan of going to France at all without an original birth certificate. I don't mind losing the housing benefit but obviously I need to be able to renew the visa for the second year. Is this a dead end or will French authorities accept an apostilled affidavit of birth from a notary or lawyer in Bangalore (in lieu of the original birth certificate)?  This information is critical for me because if there is really no way to renew my visa without an original birth certificate, then it means I cannot go to France at all (my course is for two years). The student integration team at Grenoble told me that no other document will be accepted. But Campus France tells me that it is only needed for the housing benefit and not needed for the visa, so I am confused. Where do I get some reliable info and is it a good idea to proceed if I am unable to produce get this document? "

I thought converting my license to Hungarian one and then driving with the Hungarian one in France. Does that seem legit? Do I just need to go to the embassy and ask for that? "
854,Driving license renewal in USA (Louisiana),"One year ago my wife (J-1) and I (J-2) moved to the USA for her postdoctoral research.  Back then I got my EAD (Employment Authorization Document), then I got my SSN and finally I was able to get my driving license with one year of validity.  Recently we got our new DS-2019 papers renewing our statuses for one more year. So I applied for an EAD renewal (case still being reviewed) and when our driver licenses expired we went to OMV. My wife got her new driver license without issues, but mine was stuck on something USCIS-related and the person asked me to try again in 2 weeks.  I did return in 2 weeks, but my case was still under review. They asked me to try again in a couple of days. I did, same thing happened all over again.  I now have a SAVE Verification Case Number which is way more than 20 working days under review, which is likely to be preventing me to get my renewed driver license.  Could this be related to my EAD renewal still being under review? Any advices on how could I sort out this situation?  Thanks! "

Currently, I study at the double degree program between two universities and work part time (research and teaching assistanship positions associated with one of the universities).  DS-160 form allows for only one current occupation. What should I do in this regard? Is it a good idea to use one of the universities as a primary occupation and to list the other university and my employment in ""were you previously employed"" and ""have you attended educational institutions at the secondary level or above"" questions respectively? Or is it a bad idea to use these questions for the current occupations and I should use them for ""truly"" previous occupations only? Is it better to bring a full list of my extra current occupations with me to the interview without mentioning them in DS-160?  "

One option is to use AC21 to move to a similar job. But a lawyer told me one option for me is to file a new self-petition I-140 (EB1-A) and transfer the pending I-485 to the new one. I already re-scheduled my USCIS appointment, so I have to decide soon.   Which one is recommended? Pros/cons? If you know a good firm practicing that with reasonable fees, let me know. "

I can't just sit and wait for the immigration visa, it might never come. We applied for the express visa.  So I applied for a master's degree, fully funded by my university and a third party. My university is certified by ABET and works with some US universities. However I don't think they have any relationship with Canadian universities.  My master's should take a year and a half, perhaps longer, since I'm busy, I have a full- time job and freelance projects. Some people in my country are receiving immigration visas within a year.  What would happen if I receive the immigration visa while doing my master's? Can I ask for additional time or would I have to quit and lose the tuition funds?

Firstly, UK citizenship and passport - how long would an EU citizen have to have been living and working in the UK to be able to apply, and what's the process they'd need to follow?  Otherwise, for EU citizens who've been living and working in the UK for a number of years, who don't want to get a UK passport (eg because they'd then have to give up their other one), are there any other permanent statuses they could get to safeguard / cement their rights to live in the UK?

863,Studying in Montreal this Fall; can I visit as a tourist before the start date on my CAQ?,"I was accepted into a Master's Program starting in the fall semester. I've already received my Québec Acceptance Certificate and had my application for a study permit approved. (I understand I can only receive my study permit upon entry to Canada.)  I have an invitation from a friend who lives near Montreal to stay with them for a while before my program starts. It'd be nice to be able to look around the city a bit before I have to worry about finding an apartment and all the other stresses that come with an international move, and I'm a U.S. Citizen so I should be able to visit as a tourist with just my passport. My main point of confusion is that the CAQ lists an effective start and end date for my stay, while the letter notifying me of my successful study permit application only lists a date by which I must leave Canada.  So, if I fly into Montreal before the start date on my CAQ, can I be issued my study permit on first arrival? Failing that, can I enter as a tourist and then drive down to the US/Canada border to get my study permit after my CAQ start date? Would this raise any eyebrows among the immigration officers?  Edit: I'd be going to visit in mid-July, whereas the start date on my CAQ is the first of August, so this would only be for a week or two. "

Assuming that I go to USCIS approved doctor tomorrow and there is no delay on my side gathering copies of other documents (birth certificate, copies of payrolls etc), then how much time would it take to get past this travel blackout period so that I could safely go back to my home country? Is this something doable in 5 weeks from the state I am in right now?   Would I also need to apply for the Advance Parole? I am not sure that I fully understand its purpose.  P.S. In the mean time I also sent an email to my immigration attorney.  Haven't received an answer yet, but based on past interaction with him I think he will say it depends on various factors. So I would like to hear what folks that have went through this process have to say about their timelines. "

875,Netherlands acquiring 30% ruling after two months of starting the job,"I was accepted to work in a company in the Netherlands.  I understood that there is 30% ruling new law, which is applied to people who have a master degree and under 30 years old.  I'm 26 years old, but I will be graduated from my master program 2 months after starting working with the company.  When I get my master certificate, can I apply for the 30% ruling so I can get a better net salary ? or I'd need to wait until the next contract? "

Few weeks later I got married and the University is sending an I-20 for me again under the same SEVIS number adding a dependent and another for my spouse. What do I do with my old I-20?

He sent to me copy of his passport and he told me that it should be enough that my money safe !!  I think it is a bad Idea, but:   Is there an official government office I can verify that this man is the owner of this apartment? If I send money, how can I guarantee the transaction? Is the passport good enough proof of anything?  "
879,Can my wife travel to the US with her existing H4 visa in this situation?,"Backstory: I am on H1B visa working in the US currently and I switched my job last year to another employer. My H1B was transferred to this new employer that I am currently working with. My H1B expires in August 2018. My wife has H4 visa from my previous employer. She has traveled to the US once in December 2015 with the H4 from my previous employer. At that time, I was working with the new employer.  Situation: She is traveling on August 5th, 2016 and her visa is expiring on September 16th, 2016. Her visa is H4.  Is she ok to travel? Would she face any issues from the immigration since her visa is expiring soon?  Once she is here in August, I am planning to extend her H4 with this new employer of mine. "
880,Expatriating to Switzerland with your own car,"I'm going to expatriate to Switzerland. I have a car which I'd like to take with me. From what I've heard you're allowed to take one car with you, and you have one year to change plates and security to Swiss one, but you need to report that car to the customs when you enter Switzerland.  Is it true? If so, it's problematic, because I don't know if I keep that car or sell it withing first year and buy more decent one in Switzerland (in that case I'd like to sell the car in Poland). If it's really necessary to declare I want to take that car with me already at start, am I allowed to change my mind, and what are the consequences? "

Do I have to be a resident to own real estate (alternatively, can a non-resident own a business that owns the real estate)? Do I need to work with a real estate agent, or can I purchase directly from the seller (assuming language barrier isn't a problem!)? Do I need to get a lawyer involved? Are there any special requirements for a non-resident (e.g., apply for a tax ID, need special permit to build on the land or if there are existing buildings, etc.)? Do the requirements change depending on what the land will be used for (e.g., residential rental property vs. hold and sell)?  "

As I understand it one is only allowed to work for the company which has the employee permit for the employee with the permit.  Is it possible to freelance on such a visa?  Is it possible to get, concurrently, a work permit sponsored by an employer and a freelance visa?  Or is a work permit sufficient for freelancing? "
886,Do differences between NTSC and PAL matter with modern TVs?,"There is a lot of old information on the web about the differences between NTSC and PAL television systems. Most of this information says that you cannot use a US TV in Europe because NTSC and PAL are not compatible. Now that the world has gone to digital TV, cable, and internet based streaming are PAL and NTSC things of the past. As long as a TV can handle the voltage, potentially with the aid of a transformer, can you use it in any country? Do you have to worry about the voltage frequency (e.g., 50/60 Hz difference between the US and most of Europe)? How do DVD and Blue-ray fit into this? "
887,Do I need (can) unregister from Polish address when leaving Poland?,"I'm currently living as expat in Germany. While it's probably too late to correct that (I'm returning in a few months) I've heard I should deregister from Polish address in tax office and give them my foreign address.  I have a doubt with it because my Polish ID-Card has registration address on it, and I can't unregister in City Office responsible for registration without giving the place (in Poland) where I go (to prevent being registered nowhere).   So my question arises, is it possible to unregister from Polish address when leaving Poland? Or maybe it's actually required to say I'm going abroad? When I've filled tax formular I've asked about income from abroad in tax office, and they've said nothing about I should deregister when emigrating. "
888,Is there an advantage of acquiring permanent residence in Norway?,"For EU citizens, after five years of residency, one can acquire a permanent oppholdstillatelse with the local authorities in Norway.

889,Document's Certified Copy UK,"I moved to the UK from continental Europe around one year ago. Recently, I applied for a credit card. I thought I was declined, however today I received mail from the bank asking me to provide more details — namely, confirm my identity and address. I have to provide a ""certified copy"" of my ID card. They provide a list of ""who can certify"" which includes ""post office, your bank, lawyer, solicitor, serving Police officer, Doctor (GP) etc."" This is completely new for me. How does this work? Is it a completely normal thing to ask a police officer (which one?) to certify a photocopy of my ID? Or go to a GP and ask them?  Is this a common thing to do?  I am a bit afraid that I will look like an idiot, as I certainly would if I went to a doctor in my home country and asked them to do such a thing. "
890,Can I re-apply for a refused UK Spousal Visa rather than go through the Tribunal Process?,"My wife is an EU citizen and I applied for a EU spousal permit to live / work in the UK.  The office that handles the receiving of documents advised that I wouldn't need to submit my wife's EU passport with the application (I don't know why).  The ECO declined the application for lack of proof of my wife's nationality.  The refusal letter gives details on how to appeal, but it is an extremely lengthy process.   Can I not just re-apply for the visa and supply the correct documents?  Additionally, will the refusal stay on on my name so that I have to declare it every time I visit the UK? (where it says ""have you ever been declined a visa?"") "
891,Travelling to UK on a Spouse Visa,"I am a spouse of a British citizen and have a valid spouse visa (expires Oct 2015). I lived with my husband for two years in the UK, but both me and my husband have left the UK to work in the Middle East at the start of 2015. I am travelling to the UK for 4 days this summer, without my husband, to meet my friends. Can I travel on my valid spouse visa, or do I need to apply for a visitor visa? I'm unsure because I'm travelling to visit the UK and not staying there, as my husband no longer lives in the UK. I have checked the immigration rules and find them unclear.  If I am unable to travel on my spouse visa, can I actually apply for a visitor visa, even though I already have a valid spouse visa? My spouse visa is a multiple exit/entry one. I can evidence a return ticket if the customs/immigration officer at Heathrow asks me. "
892,Should I first get a visitor visa to study Chinese or apply directly for resident visa?,"I want to go to Taiwan soon to study Chinese for more than 6 months, and I found out I can either apply for a resident visa from Canada or first get a visitor visa (renewable to a total of 6 months) that I can then convert to a resident visa in Taiwan. I think it comes out cheaper in the end to go directly with the resident visa. In this last case, however, a health certificate is required and many people told me it's much easier to get this done in Taiwan.  Did anyone apply for the resident visa directly, and would you suggest doing that? Is it as easy to get as the visitor visa, given that you provide all the required documents? "

895,"What is this arrangement called, and what kind of contract is used?","I am going to travel to Germany. I have heard that students there can find listings in the newspaper requesting a home mate.  In this arrangement, the new person doesn't pay rent, in return for doing chores, like shopping, cleaning or cooking. Thus, the student can save money, but has less time for their studies or leisure.  What is this arrangement called? How can I find out more about it?  In particular, what kind of contract is usually used? If the house owner decides suddenly to end the arrangement, is there anything the student can do to stop them?  Are there any websites to find listings for these kinds of arrangements? "
896,UK - Getting a Certificate of Sponsorship,"I lived in the UK for one year as an exchange student. During this period I did a Summer internship and it was a brilliant experience. For this reason I would like work in the UK after I graduate. I have done some research about it and this is what I've found out: (please correct me if I'm wrong)   I would need to apply for a Tier 2 (General) Visa since I'm from outside the European Economic Area (EEA). I would need a Certificate of Sponsorship (CoS) from an employer in order to get the visa. In consideration of my degree, the job title would be among the ones listed in the Shortage Occupation List. Therefore, the employer wouldn't have to carry out a resident labour market.   My question is: how hard is it to get a Certificate of Sponsorship? I know it varies on a case-by-case basis, but any information would be helpful. Additionally, does company size affects my chances of getting a CoS? Are bigger companies more likely to provide me a CoS?  Thanks in advance! "
897,"Must one's ""primary"" family name in the U.S. be the first in order?","When someone who was born and given their name in a country that uses multiple family names lives in the U.S., are there rules as to what their ""official"" last name must be?  I heard an immigration officer use a first family name as a ""last name"", which caused confusion, in this case, to the point where the person being called did not realize it was them that was being referred to.  This is because this person has a Portuguese-style name, where a full name like ""João Carlos Fernandes Gonçalves Gomes"" refers to a person with the given names ""João Carlos"" and the family names ""Fernandes Gonçalves Gomes"". Their father's last-in-order family name was most likely ""Gomes"", and when a short name is called for, they're probably known as ""João Gomes"". However, in this case, the immigration officer would have asked for a ""Mr. Fernandes"".  Was this a simple confusion with Spanish-style surnames, where a ""Juan Carlos Fernández Gomez"" would be most commonly known as ""Juan Fernández""? Or is this a general rule in the U.S., that long last names are always shortened by choosing the first part of it?  Can poor João write his name on official documents as ""João C. Gomes"" (or another choice of middle initial) without applying for a name change, or is that strictly incorrect in the U.S.? He had thought it'd be simple when he heard the terms ""first name"" and ""last name""—""João"" is literally the first, and ""Gomes"" the last, in order, in his full name. "

899,Re-entering India repeatedly on a multi-entry business visa,"I am currently in India on business.

The company is planning on keeping me in India longer, possibly up to a year or more.  I recently went to Thailand about halfway through my 180 days, by leaving the country and re-entering, does this ""reset"" the 180 days so that it starts when I arrived back in India?

My plan is to get a job in the USA and then apply for a TN visa. Here are my questions:   When I apply for jobs in the USA, the employers ask whether I'm authorized to work in the USA. Am I authorized in this situation? Working with a TN visa doesn't require employer sponsorship, does it?

Can I work for this company and be registered in Europe without any VISA as I won't be residing in Europe?

One of these examples is      Affidavits sworn to or affirmed by at least two people ...   How important is it for me to gather these affidavits?  In particular,   Is ""should include"" supposed to mean ""must include"" generally? Is an affidavit without notarization better than nothing?

910,Would a multi entry schengen visa get cancelled upon applying for family reunion visa?,"My wife(non EU) has a 1 year schengen visa issued by the Netherlands. She has used it already twice, once to Netherlands and second time to Denmark/Germany last year. We had got married in Denmark with this visa.   I am a resident of Germany (non EU citizen) and she has already applied for family reunion visa for Germany. The family reunion visa obviously takes a couple of months to process and I was wondering if she is still eligible to reuse the schengen visa to travel to Germany, while the other visa is under process, provided she meets the criteria of a tourist (return ticket, sufficient finance, 90/180 rule).   I am pretty sure, the immigration can already see the family visa under processing and wondering if the schengen visa is somehow cancelled due to the family visa processing? Would she get denied at immigration?  Additional Info: She has stayed around 70 days in total last year. It is already been 6 months since her last visit. Visa is still valid for 5 more months from now. I understand she can still stay another 90 days provided the visa is still valid. "
911,How much time can my Mexican wife and my son stay with me in the UK while working my 6 months before Family/Spouse visa application?,"I hope someone can help.  I have read a bunch of posts about family visas, but can't find reference my questions, so I hope someone can give some insight.  Some background first.  I am a British Citizen. my wife is Mexican and we have a 2-year-old son, who is also British.  My wife and I have been in a relationship for over 11 years and got married in 2016.  During the 11 years of our relationship, we have visited the UK almost every year to visit family, Christmas etc. and have always left the country on time.  My wife still has her parents and a large family still in Mexico.  We have recently been living and working in Chile until last year when I lost my job.  In December 2018, we decided to move back to the UK as my parents are old and unwell and I have a better chance of finding a decent job.  We all traveled to the UK, myself, my wife, my son, my dog. Of course, I know better now, but at the time, I foolishly thought that my wife staying with me in England was a simple process. Now we have done the research, we realize it is a little more complicated than we imagined.  Fortunately, when we arrived at the UK border in a van full of cases and a dog cage, the border agent stamped my wife's passport for 6 months.  My wife and son are returning to Mexico after being with me for 4 months, as she obviously needs to leave before her 6-month passport stamp expires.  I am currently looking for work in the hope that I can get a decent job, and after 6 months, apply for a Family/spouse Visa so that my wife and son can finally be in England with me.  So finally to my questions... sorry for the long intro.  While I am working the 6 months period, is it ok for my wife and son to come to England to visit? I really don't like the idea of not seeing them for 6 months.  If they can come and visit, is it recommended not to return until after 4 months? (the time they have just spent in the UK),  After that time, would it be ok for them to come for 2 months and then return to Mexico for 2 months, then visit again? What do you feel are the correct limits to this?  I have read that if a customs/border agent feels that someone is trying to live in the UK without a visa, they can be rejected entry. Obviously, I want to be with my wife and son as much as possible, but I don't want to damage our chances of getting a long term visa. We really want to do the process properly.  Would the border agents see it as a bad thing that a wife and child are coming to visit dad? And they have a return ticket and a long history of visiting for holiday a returning to Mexico correctly?  I know this is a lot to take in, but it seems that there are many ways that the process can go wrong. We just want to make sure we are doing everything correctly.  Thank you very much for your time and help. "
912,Passing a border with an infant of a different citizenship,"My family is composed of US and French citizens, and lives in the US. My wife, myself and two of our children are French citizen, with an I-765 EAD/AP (""Combo Card"") and an H1/H4 visa. We all have French passports. Our third child is an American and French citizen (dual citizenship), she is an infant, has a US passport and is in our ""livret de famille"". She does not have a French passport nor a ""carte d'identité"".  We are going to travel from the US to France and back soon, and wonder what we should do at the border. As far as I know, the border (both in France and in the US) at the airport is always divided in a ""Citizen"" / ""Visitors"" way, like this:    Entering France  Since we are all French citizen, I would assume that she can cross the border with us (i.e., come with us to the ""E.U. Citizen"" kiosk), and that our ""livret de famille"" will be enough to prove her citizenship.  Am I right in this assumption?  Or should she go with one of us trough the ""visitor"" kiosk? Worst case scenario, US citizen do not need Visa for short visits in France, if they have a US passport, according to france-visas.gouv.fr, so she should be able to enter France easily.  Entering the US  I don't know if we should go through the ""US citizen"" or ""Non-US citizen"" kiosk to re-enter the US. Since she is a US citizen, she should go through that kiosk, but none of us can go with her, and she is obviously too young to go through custom on her own. Since she does not have a I-765 EAD/AP (""Combo Card"") or H4 visa, I feel like it would be inappropriate to try to go through the non-us citizen kiosk with her.  I asked a travel agency and looked around, but could not find the answer to my question. Should we all go to the non-US citizen visitors? "
913,French citizenship after studying in French University,"As per the official cite one can apply for naturalization in France after completing 2 years in a French superior institute   2 ans d'études accomplies avec succès pour obtenir un diplôme d'un établissement d'enseignement supérieur français   My question is that if the normal duration of a course is 1 yr and for some reasons it is extended to 2 years, what are the rules in such a case? In particular one may assume that 2 yrs degree would be defined by number of credit hours and if so would one have to take a few more credit hours to be eligible.

914,Germany Blue Card change job/employer,"So it has been almost 6 months in Germany with my first job here on the Blue Card. Now I accepted another better offer which wants me to start on Apr 1. So I'm currently in my 2 week notice period with the current company and the last day is Mar 21. I've searched online so hard and also on the berlin service website - there's just no proper instructions on how to change the employer. I know I have to notify ABH but when and how? On my green paper (Zusablatt) there is only mention of my designation/role, there is NO mention of the current company.    Which ABH office should I go to? Keplerstrasse or the other one? Or BIS which issued my blue card? How should I get the appointment? I don't see any online appointment facility for this purpose in any offices. Can I just walk-in and take a token? When should I do this? I just signed the new contract offer yesterday and I'm still in my 2 week notice period with current company. Should I go to the ABH/BIS only after my last day in current company or can I do it right-away and still serve notice period? Do I have to get this done and only then start at the new place or can this be done in parallel (join anyway on Apr 1 and get this done then or later asap)? I believe my TK insurance will be valid without extra cost for 1 month more from my current company's last date. So I guess I should be fine with TK when switching jobs. Please confirm?   Thanks! Hoping to hear from others who have switched before 2 years in Germany. "

However, I am from Northern Ireland, and usually we fly into Dublin and drive up to Belfast, because it’s fastest. ROI has no visa requirements for Bolivian citizens, we could go there tomorrow.  When his British citizenship comes through, could we fly into Dublin, drive up North and apply for his passport there? Any legal issues with that? Even with Brexit there won’t be a hard border by the time we’d be coming home anyway. "
917,Portuguese citizenship using grandparents' birth certificates,"I am an Indian citizen born in the 80's, ancestrally from Goa, India. Portuguese nationality law allows those who were Portuguese citizens connected with Portuguese India before 1961 to retain Portuguese nationality, up to 3 generations.  Both my parents were born in Goa in the 50's, and my grandparents were all born in Goa before 1920. I have managed to get provisional digital copies of their(6) birth certificates (""Registo de Nascimento"") from a gov. website.  My spouse's parents were born outside Goa, but all her grandparents were born in Goa around the 1920's. I have not (yet) managed to get provisional digital copies of their(4) birth certificates.  My parents have Indian passports and other documents with anglicized names.  My queries are:   Is it true that I cannot prove that I am a descendant of my (grand)parents' since my parents have anglicised names, and that the only solution is for them to make new passports with their Portuguese names? Since my spouse's parents were born outside Goa, would the overall process be easier for her, given the fact that her grandparents' docs are in Portuguese, her parents' docs are in English (and therefore no anglicization has taken place)? Can I get Portuguese citizenship once my wife gets hers?  "
918,"Waiting time for UK Residence card, Non EU, EAA family member","My husband is working in the UK. Both he and our children have EU passports, even though we've been married for 18 years, we've never lived longer than 5 years in a EU country. I therefore am in the UK on an 6 month EAA family visa/permit. We applied for a residency card at the beginning of Feb (6 weeks ago). The Home office replied within 2 weeks with a notice for a BRC, which we did almost immediately. We then received a letter confirming my application and permission to work in the UK. My family visa expires in 3 weeks. Do I have to leave the UK, hence my family, whilst I wait for my residence card? We're due to travel on holiday as a family in April, will I be let back in? The immigration centres will not answer any questions regarding the application or progress, we therefore cannot get any advice.  "
919,"Marriage green card at end of current visa with 2 Year residency requirement waiver in-process, question","So I was just married, but my J1 Visa is ending in a few days. I know I have 30 days afterwards that I am allowed to take, to leave. Given the following additional information, which is the best course of action to take for applying for a greencard on the basis of marriage to a US Citizen?  But the situation is complicated by a 2-year home requirement from the J1-visa. I applied to waive this requirement a while back, but the processing is dragging on. I expect to receive the waiver, no problem, because I received no governmental funding. However, until I acquire the waiver, I think I am not supposed to apply for a greencard, since it is migratory.  If I apply now, I might be denied because I don't have the waiver yer. However, if I don't get the waiver soon, I might have to go back to my home country. If I go back to my home country, I am worried that I might be required to serve the 2-year residency requirement. Alternatively, I can try to wait for the waiver to process before applying for a greencard. But there is no guarantee that it will finish in time.   If I apply now and am rejected on the basis of having the 2-year home residency requirement, can I appeal later once the requirement is waived? "
920,Dependent of talent passport/visa recipient for France. Process?,"My spouse is currently working in France on a talent visa (a.k.a. ""talent passport""). Specifically it's a “passeport talent” “chercheur” (Scientist/researcher)"" and valid for multiple years ([website]It's been very hard to find the process for me to apply for the dependent visa there. The only information I found was here: [website]which states ""The “accompanying family” exemption facility is reserved for certain categories of people (e.g. family members of qualified workers and scientists)."" Not really sure what this means.  Does anyone know the process for applying for this, within the US? I have a rough idea of the process: e.g. apply to VFS and submit relevant documents in person, then get the visa and enter France and apply for the resident card within first three months. But I wasn't able to find anything concrete w.r.t. documents I need to submit, the validity of the visa etc?  If anyone can point me in the right direction I'd really appreciate it!  Thanks in advance. "
921,"How to stop paying social security in multiple countries (that have a totalization agreement, US and Japan)","I'm working for a small US company remotely from Japan. The company doesn't have a branch in Japan or anything, so American social security tax is still being deducted from my paycheck (payroll is all done under an American address)  However, since I don't have any plans to move back to the US in the next 5 years, and Japan and the US have a totalization agreement for social security, I should be paying the tax in Japan, and not the US (according to my research from Googling &amp; from talking to the social security information desk in Japan). Currently I'm paying in both countries.  I can't seem to find any resources that explain what I need to do to stop paying social security in the US. What kind of paperwork needs to happen? Is it even possible when it's a small company with no Japanese branch? "
922,"If I have a job offer while in Schengen-Business stay in Portugal, can I apply for a residence permit?","I am a non-EU citizen. Recently, I received an invitation for an interview (IT position) from a company in Porto, Portugal. I will be visiting them on a Schengen-business visa. If they make the job offer and if they are willing to help with the visa processes, can I apply for a residence permit right away? or will I have to exit Portugal and re-enter again?   If yes, does it differ from a residence permit I would get through a National Visa? What are the perks of entering Europe in such way? When bringing my spouse to Portugal, will the SEF of Portugal give permission letter? After few years if I ever have to change job/ move to another country, will my visa status cause problems? (I read the person would be stuck and the entire process would start again and the person will have to exit and re-enter). If I stay for 5 years, would I be able to apply for the Permanent Residency and get a passport?  "
923,Is there any way i can move from private health insurance to public one without lowering my income?,"I moved to Germany 1 year ago and i was tricked into getting a private insurance. Not just trick, i was actually lied to to make me go for private one, but i guess it does not change anything. When i realized the mistake, i tried to move back to public one but could not as my annual salary is sufficiently above the limit only below which you can move back to public insurance.   I was asking around and today found a consultant who claims that it is possible if the private insurance provider let you go and it doesn't have anything to do with my salary. But it would be super difficult.  My Questions: 1 - Is it possible that my private insurance provider can let me go if i force them enough ? Is there any law related to this ? Is there anything i can do legally here ? 2 - Is there any other reasonable way (other than finding a low paying job) to get back to public insurance ? "
924,Applying for a US marriage green card from the UK,"My wife (US national) and I (Italy national) have been married for over two years and we are currently based in the UK. Her mom got really sick with dementia and we're thinking of moving back to the States to spend the last few years she has with her. I would like to ask if anyone in this forum has applied for a green card while outside of the States.  I have so many questions I thought I would list them one by one   How long does the whole process take from start to finish? What was your timeline to get the I130? How did you get the I864? Did your US spouse have to move to the States before you? If you got the I864 through savings, how much do you have to have in savings? Did you get your green card before getting to the States? Or do you have to open an envelope at border patrol only to find out if you have been granted the green card? What kind of documents will I need to get if I have lived in 3 other countries in the last 10 years?   Other than all of the above questions are there any other things I should consider to get the ball rolling as quickly as possible? "
925,For how long can I postpone filing an application for adjustment of status (I-130)?,"My sister (US citizen) has filed an I-130 petition for me in January, 2006. The most recent Visa Bulletin states that the ""final action date"" for my category (F4, Brothers and Sisters of Adult U.S. Citizens) is ""01JAN06"" so I guess I can file an application for adjustment of status now.  But at this point I'm not sure whether I can/want to proceed with this.  How much time have I got to decide and file/not file? Does this thing have an expiry date? Thank you! "
926,How should I plan my vacation and work to the USA as a French?,"Currently working as a Software Developer in France (I'm French), I plan to visit the USA as a tourist first. But then, I'd like to work there, to improve my English skill and diversify my working experiences.  I didn't define the duration yet. I could work for 3 months as well as for 2 years, depending of how good I feel there and the opportunities I get. But I'd like to be there as a tourist for at least one month and up to three months I guess (then I'll need to earn money to stay confortable enough without using too much of my savings).  I've seen in others questions that modest people tend to get their visa refused because the immigration service is ""afraid"" that they won't go back to their country.  I'm currently earning between 2600 and 2700€ per month. Moreover, finding a job here in France is quite easy in software development.  The problem is, I feel overwhelmed by informations I can find on the web on how to work in the USA. And I have no clue how should I plan this, to be able to relax and visit the USA before working there.  I'm not asking how to find a job, even though I'd gladly read some advices about it, but how should I manage all this. I don't know where to start and how should I plan this.  Go to the USA and seek for a job there while visiting ? Or maybe look for a job from France and try to define a start date (if I can find a job) allowing me to come to the USA sooner and visit before starting to work ? Maybe should I start by working in Canada first ? As it is quite easier as a French to work there. I don't know.   What ""scares"" me the most is the time required to get this working visa.  In case this information could help answer me, I'm turning 26 this year and I'd like to leave France early 2020.  I first posted this question on the wrong SE site (travel) and apparently it takes at least 18 months to get a working visa. Is there a way to reduce this required time? Or maybe is it possible to work in Canada while applying for a US working visa ?  Bonus : If I could visit Mexico/Cuba/Canada from the USA (a weekend here, a week there..) it would be a BIG plus. During my visit as a tourist or as a worker I don't really mind. (Even though I guess it'll be easier as a tourist)  EDIT : During my searches, I discovered that maybe it could be a nice idea to find a remote job while visiting the US but I'd consider this as a last resort as I am more interested in integrating a US company to improve my English ""face to face"" in a professional environment.  Thanks. "
927,Веing a tutor in Germany,Imagine one has no work permit and enters Germany with a tourist visa or a job seeker visa or a student visa. Is it legal to be a tutor?  What are the legal consequences of tutoring?  e.g. may one be deported or have troubles with next visa? I think that it is a minor crime so it is not de facto punishable.  Will one obtain some fines(how much?) or be charged with something?

However, my spouse is Syrian (My child and I are not).  Although my spouse's nationality is on the US ban, I have read that if one has a relative(such as a husband in her case) in the US, the ban does not apply.  My questions are:   While we are applying together and at the moment of applying I won't be technicality in the US. Will this deny her from getting the F2 visa?   Is it better that I go first and after I land in US and do all the required papers there then she apply? (This option is very tough for us)  What is the chance that her F2 get approved if we apply together?  Some useful information:   W know each other since more than 7 years.  We got married 2 years ago. We have 1 year old baby My I20 was given based on full scholarship(graduate research assistantships). I have very strong supporting letter from the dean of the faculty. I have established job with a good salary and a good evidence that I will return back after my course finish.

Unfortunately I put a no there, before realizing that Canada is one of the common wealth country!  I listed Canada as a country that I have been within the past ten years in the following questions though. So I am actually contradicting myself a bit.  What should I do now? My visa appointment is next Wednesday, I have not yet submitted my passport. But I already paid the fees.  I am thinking about cancelling this application and reapply a new one.

Your maternal grandmother's birth certificate from Italy, also known   as an estratto dell'atto di nascita   Your maternal grandfather's birth certificate   Your grandparents' marriage certificate (If married outside of Italy,    you will need an apostille and a translation into Italian.)

I also read that I need my grandfathers documents too even if he wasn't born in Italy. But my grandad(deceased) is Polish and was liberated by the British army from a camp in WW2 so the only documents I can get from him are his original alien card when he came to the UK.   None of my grandparents ever became British Citizens and although my mother has never claimed her Italian Citizenship she has never denounced it. My grandma is alive with an Italian passport will that be enough when going to the Italian consulate without her birth certificate or will I be denied? €300 isn't the end of the world being denied but wouldn't be best pleased wasting it.

936,Maintaining permanent residency right in UK as EU citizen,"I am an EU citizen. From 2008 until Dec 2015 I lived in the UK, first as student, then employed. My understanding is that after 5 years of residency in the UK, I automatically acquired a permanent residency right analogous to indefinite leave to remain (ILR). This would be lost after living elsewhere for 2 years, ie at the end of this year.  Now I expect to start a permanent job in the UK in March 2018. Given the Brexit-uncertainties, it seems very desirable to retain my ILR.  So my question is: What exactly counts as moving back to the UK for the purpose of retaining ILR? Would say getting a flat (and paying council tax) this year suffice, even if I spend most of January and February elsewhere? "

938,Apply for a German visa on a different passport,I have quiet an odd question. So I have dual citzenship. I hold an American passport. I also hold a Palestian passport. I have traveled to Germany before visa free on my American passport and I am always granted a 3 month visa upon arrival.  I recently married a German citizen who also hold dual citzenship as a palestianian. We were married in Palestine and all our documentation relating to our marriage including our marriage certificate is from Palestine.  I have a family reunification visa appointment on the 27th with the German embassy in Palestine. I am going to apply for a visa on my Palestinian passport. Do you think they will refuse giving me a visa and tell me to just use my American passport?  The reason I would prefer to use my Palestinian passport for this process is because I want to apply for a residence permit as a Palestinian. I want to be recognized as a Palestian and not an American. I plan on opening a business in Germany and all my information and money comes from Palestine. I am based in Palestine more then the United States. I have not lived there in over 15 years. Should this be an issue?

944,My husband wants to register as a UK citizen (born to a British mother in South Africa in 1964). Do we need her passport?,"The documentation listed as acceptable on uk.gov is:  • Your passport; and • Your full birth certificate (one which includes the name of your parent(s), (which should be requested from the relevant authorities in your country of origin); and • Your mother’s full birth certificate; and either • Her certificate of naturalisation or registration as a citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies (or, before 1 January 1949, as a British subject); or • Papers showing her legal adoption; or • Her expired citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies passport.  The problem is, his mother died in 1979, when he was a teenager. Due to circumstances beyond his control, her birth certificate and passport are lost. I know we can order a copy of the birth certificate (hopefully as easy as paying the cost of it and shipping, or are there hoops to jump through?), and as she was born in the UK, I can't see her having any other naturalization or registration documents.  Her passport was thrown away by her husband's next wife, and so is unrecoverable. Can one order a copy of her passport, or do I need it if her birth certificate shows she was born in England? I don't see how they can expect people to have their parents' passports. What happens if their parents are dead? Do we really need her passport?

And ever since I have lived in four different countries, always under a 'temporary residence permit'.  For the past three years I have stayed in the same country in Europe and still have a 'temporary residence permit'.  It happens very often that I am asked to provide my permanent address in legal documents. When I provide my address in the EU country where I have lived for the past three years, nobody accepts it and they all ask me to provide my PERMANENT (yes, they really like to emphasize that word) address in my home country. The problem is that I have none, I haven't lived there for over 9 years and I have no place of my own there, never had. I used to provide my latest place of residence there where I lived with my parents. But that has also become irrelevant now, as my parents have gone separate paths and don't even live there anymore and one of them has even moved out of that country.  So... What is my permanent address? What can I use? "
946,Is it possible for a UK Citizen to apply for his non EU wife and child to come to Britain but apply from outside Britain?,"I see only examples of applicants already living in Britain. My husband is planning on registering his British Citizenship (South African mother who was born in England) from within the US. Assuming he gets his citizenship, the question is how can we make a successful spouse/dependent application without breaking up our family (ie. he is living in Britain without us)? Is this possible and if so what is the process and would it be as likely to succeed as one done in the UK? Also, the applicant's occupation is Day Trader. Can that form of income count as work income? We would meet the work income level needed as a prerequisite for coming if so.. Thank you in advance for any thoughts, input, and guidance. "

I asked the company and they are fine with me working from home (from my home country for a couple of months) until I get my German long-term visa and can move to Germany.  However, since the contract's starting date is earlier than the date of my visa interview (and hence I can't make it to Germany on that time) would that create a problem during the visa interview?  "

Is it possible for us all to fly to one of these places with my newly minted Passport, I get a job locally, and apply for them and myself to obtain residency in the area? If so are there certain countries that have easier regulation for that process? Also, how long approximately before Brexit may effect our ability to accomplish this? "
955,Learner's permit to practice before driving test - over 18,"I have a UK driving license and need to get a new one in Florida. According to the law I can't use the UK driving license anymore because 30 days passed since I moved to the US.  Can adults (+18) get a learner's permit to practice before the driving test? I would like to do so for about a week before the actual test.  I read around that the learner's permit is only for non-adults, is that correct? Or is it given to me automatically (for free?) when I pass the written test?  Thanks "
956,"I am a non-UK EU citizen, arriving in the UK before Brexit. Does it matter whether my non-EU spouse joins me before or after Brexit?","I am planning to move to the UK. I am a non-UK EU citizen and I will be a researcher funded by a grant (the grant is coming not from the UK). I am arriving before January 2019, i.e. before Brexit.  My spouse (non-EU citizen) will join me in the UK and they will want to be able to work in the UK. As far as I understand, while the UK is in the EU I could do this as follows:   Spouse gets EEA family permit, valid for 6 months. After spouse arrives in the UK to join me, they can apply for a UK residence card, valid for 5 years.   After the UK leaves the EU (29 March 2019), according to [website]It seems that after UK leaves the EU ([website]"
957,Need clarification on Australia's Temporary Skill Shortage Visa (subclass 482),"I want to check whether I am eligible for this visa or not. First of all, I am 28.5 years old, I hold an Associate's degree in my relevant field (Computer Programming) and I have +6 years of relevant work experience. I can get IELTS 6 in all bands.  My general status looks fine for the visa, but to be assured to step forward, I need to know the answer to these questions:   Does my wife need to pass any IELTS exam?     Should I find the job myself? Or is there an online service or such thing by immigration department where I can find the employers who would nominate a worker of their need? Is it feasible to find a job inside Australia from outside? If yes, then how?   "

He has been living in Canada for the past 37 years but would like to visit Poland on a regular basis, he now has an apartment there (left to him by his sister who died recently). He is currently collecting Canadian pension benefits (OAS and CPP).  Can he still collect his Canadian pension and be covered under the Ontario healthcare plan? Are there requirements for him to return to Canada to maintain benefits?  If so, how often must he return to Canada? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.  Sorry for the incorrect question earlier, NEWBIE here. "
959,Moving to Republic of Ireland with a UK re-entry ban,"The background is:   I am a UK citizen and my wife is a South African citizen My wife has a ban from the UK for 12 months (due to an overstayed visa, mistakes were made on our end with the dates) I am currently in the process of acquiring my Irish passport (Irish grandparents) We plan on moving to Cork (In Ireland) for a year until her re-entry ban is up and we can continue our lives in the UK. The initial idea was that my wife can travel to Cork without a visa (stamp on entry?) and then apply for a right to work through my Irish passport. Then we can both stay and work in Ireland for the foreseeable future.   Will her re-entry ban to the UK have an effect on any of this? I wouldn't of thought twice about it usually, but I read something online stating that the UK re-entry ban could have an effect on anyone traveling to Ireland (let alone someone wanting to move there)  Our top priority is still to continue our lives in the UK, I recently read that the re-entry ban does not apply to spousal visa applications, is this accurate? Would she need to apply for the spousal visa from South Africa?  Using the freedom of movement act, will we be able to work in EU countries? "
960,Landlord access into apartment,"I went to a viewing of an apartment, and someone was already living in the one that we were showed. They weren't there during the viewing.  Is this allowed?

He is also applying for internships and has been shown interest from a reputed institution in Canada.  What is the process to apply for A Canadian work visa (since it is a paid internship)?

962,"How to get citizenship for Ireland through ""Critical Skills Employment Permit""?","There is a Visa type for Ireland titled ""Critical Skills Employment Permit"". Presume I've gotten that permit, now questions:   how can I get a Visa and citizenship if I don't have enough money in my bank account, or don't have a ""Strong Family, Social or Economic Tie"" and other things that are required to get a Visa? How can I get citizenship if for Visa approval they want me to prove that I'll return to my country?  "

I want them to join me here in the UK. How do I go about that? Do my wife and son apply togetheror separately? My wife is financially dependent on me. Do I write a letter explaining that, since my wife in unemployed? Do I need to write an invitation letter? The plan is for them to settle with me in the UK.   "
964,Entering the US after a change of status,"My wife and I are in the US. She has a B-2 visa and we plan to change her status to O-3. USCIS is supposed to send a new I-94 form after approving a change of status.  After changing the status to O-3, if my wife leaves the US and enters again with the B-2 visa and the new I-94 form, will she get a O-3 status? Or must she apply for a new O-3 visa in a US embassy before entering the US again?  Surprisingly, the answer I get from different sources (USCIS and attorneys) are completely different. The attorney says my wife has to apply for a new O-3 visa, but several USCIS representatives (via USCIS website chat) told me that she would get an O-3 status with the B-2 visa + I-94. "

Few months ago, I applied for Australia PR (EOI). So what happens if I get the Australian PR invite while I am working in US?  If I visit Australia to activate PR, will my L1B has any impact?  Or As I am on L1B, will there be any issues in Australian PR?  Overall, I would like to know if there are any implications? "
966,Question on French bank account and taxation,"Does anyone know where I can find reliable information on French taxation rules? As a student from India, who is going to live in France on VLS-TS, I will open a French bank account. Will this be a normal account or are there special student saving accounts with different rates of interest?  And when I create a French bank account, I am planning to transfer money from my Indian account for one year's living expenses. Will this money entering France from India be taxed? "
967,How early can we travel within the EU with a US baby born in the EU?,"My wife and I are both US citizens planning on giving birth in possibly France or Switzerland while I am there for work. How soon and what is required for us to be able to travel with the new baby within Europe? Does the baby need a US passport before being able to cross country borders even if it's from one one EU nation to another? I am assuming yes, especially if it's to or from Switzerland or the UK. "
968,Advantages of keeping UK National Insurance while moving permanently to another country?,"Having lived in the UK for ~6 years, I'm now preparing to move to the US. As a corporate director, I've contributed to UK's National Insurance at basic rates, but made minimal investments above that. Not planning on receiving any benefit, or pension from the UK; however, I do appreciate their national healthcare services, when compared to the US counterparts.  Question for the contingency of getting Really Sick (non-emergency medical operations):   Can I keep paying National Insurance at given rates, and keep the medical coverage? Would that coverage be exercisable by traveling to the UK? Do I need to communicate ""moving to another country"" to the UK government for NI coverage continuity?  "
969,Can a naturalised British citizen live anywhere in the world without losing UK citizenship?,"Following up on How do i get a British citizenship?, I realised that one of the requirements is      you’ll continue to live in the UK   When googling for the question I'm asking here, unofficial answers mention that once someone gets the citizenship, it's forever, irrespectively of where you (permanently) live. So, which of the two is true?  "
970,German tax refund after moving abroad,"The German tax office usually collects more taxes than needed and refunds the surplus by bank transfer in the following year, once tax returns have been filed.  I'm now working in Germany, and I'm going to return to my home EU country (Poland). I will close all things here in Germany, including my bank account. How should I apply for tax refund, then? Can I send all papers from abroad, and give my Polish bank account details? Or am I expected to go to Germany two more times, to submit the papers and then to collect the money?   I'd like to avoid the latter, because it's 16 hours by bus in one direction.  I don't want to keep German bank accoun open, because they will charge 10 Euro each month if there will be no incoming payments. It's quite typical for German banks, as fair as I know. If you work, you pay nothing, if you don't work and have no income, you have nothing to say... "
971,Choosing between private and regular health insurance when moving to Germany,"It seems that health insurance is mandatory in Germany and employees with a salary above a certain threshold can choose between private insurance and the regular statutory system (gesetzliche Krankenversicherung). Some discussions I have read also suggest that being privately insured is regarded as a privilege and ensures a better service.  I have a few questions on the consequences of this system for someone moving to Germany for the first time:   Do you have to choose between private and public insurance immediately? Can you switch easily later on? How big are the differences really (both in terms of price/premiums and service/access to healthcare)? Are there any general rules about which system is preferable or does it depend strongly on your needs and financial means?   (I am considering someone getting a new work contract with a local employer, neither self-employed, working remotely nor sent to Germany by an employer based abroad.) "
972,Moving to the Netherlands on a work visa when serving on a board of a Dutch business,One of my businesses is headquartered at my business partner's location in the Netherland's (but is registered as an LTD in the UK).  Suppose I move to the Netherlands on a work visa.  Obviously I would only be allowed to work for an employer which has a work permit in my name.  Can I hold two work permits for two different employers?  Is there another way to serve as a corporate officer and director while having a work permit for a different employer?  Does it matter if I have been an officer and director for some time before relocating? 
973,Information on tax treaties,"Countries have tax treaties with each other which allows citizens of A working in B to have favourable tax treatment (no tax/reduced tax/taxed like a citizen of B). I've found good documentation for tax treaties the US has with other countries, but not for any country A with B. Is there a place where I can find this information? Barring such a general database, is there information for tax treaties India has with other countries (primarily west European)? "
974,Insurance for travel back to home country for personal/family emergencies?,"Every expat's worst fear is dealing with an emergency back home from far away. My wife and I are US citizens living in New Zealand. For us it's the question of how we would afford travel back home in the case of a family emergency, and would we even be able to get there in time?  The obvious answer is to have a budget and to make sure you keep enough in savings to deal with these kinds of emergencies. We do this, but how much is enough? What happens if we have to deal with a major car repair the day before we find out my sister had a horrible car accident? And really, who wants to be forced into performing the cost/benefit analysis of a [tex]5,000, but you might not know for certain until it's too late to get there in time.  Are there expat-focused insurance programs which pay for round-trip travel to your home country under certain emergency situations? I know there are travel insurance programs with similar features, but I'd imagine an insurance program focused on just this problem, just for people residing in a foreign country, would have cost benefits over typical travel insurance.  As an aside, I've written a bunch of rhetorical questions in this post. I'm only looking for an answer to the one in bold. "
975,Opening a Bank Account in Hong Kong as a new arrival?,"If I've just arrived in Hong Kong to settle there, as a non-HK-national, how could I go about getting a Hong Kong bank account?  I'm interested in the kinds of documents one would have to produce, and especially any that might be troublesome for a new arrival? For example, if you're staying in a hotel, is that going to be OK for address, or would you need to wait until you've moved into somewhere more permanent?  (Note - this is an attempt to produce a more site on-topic version of this question) "
976,"Healthcare in the UK, if you're not entitled to free use of the NHS?","In the UK, almost everyone is covered by the National Health Service (NHS), the publicly funded healthcare system. One of the things about it is that it's free at the point of use, for those who're covered by it (the odd statutory fee excepted).  With all Brits and permanent residents covered, along with EEA nationals, and short term visitors from various countries via reciprocal agreements, as a local you could be forgiven for thinking that everyone is covered. However, that's not the case, and a new expat arriving in the UK could well not be.  So, two parts to this question:   As a non-EU-citizen moving newly to the UK, how can you check to see if you would be covered by the NHS? If the answer is that you won't be, how do you go about getting healthcare coverage?  "
977,"Is it possible to pay US Income tax, without paying state income tax?","This is a bit of a followup to my earlier question...  I'm a US citizen, working for a US company, and paying US income taxes. I've switched my banking records and all to use my sister's address in Kansas. As such, I continue to ""pretend"" to live in Kansas, for the purpose of voting, paying taxes, etc.  But I'm really living in Mexico.  Is it possible to change my US tax status somehow, such that I would no longer pay state income taxes, unemployment insurance, etc, while continuing to pay US Federal income taxes?  Perhaps by changing my address to somewhere in Guam, or some other US state/territory that doesn't charge such things? :)  I realize I could also change my tax status to paying taxes in Mexico, but then I would pay more, and it would make my immigration status much more complicated. And the Mexican government is completely content with me working in the US and paying US taxes. And no doubt the US is happy taking my tax money as well. So I don't feel I need to start paying taxes in Mexico to be ""above board."" "
978,"In Mexico, what do the various colors of curbs mean with respect to parking zones?","In the US, I'm accustomed to never parking along a yellow or red curb. yellow meaning a freight loading/unloading zone and red meaning a fire or emergency-access zone.  However, in Mexico I see a plethora of yellow curbs, often in residential neighborhoods, with many people parked along them.  This leads me to think that a yellow curb does not mean ""no parking zone"" in Mexico.  However, I recently heard of a friend's car being towed for parking in a ""yellow zone.""  What does a yellow curb signify in Mexico? Can I park there? "
979,How can a non-EU citizen become a Danish citizen?,"... And how difficult is it/how does it work? I am confused about how you could get a job for a work visa? What happens if your income comes from an independant/freelance career (e.g. like a photographer or artist)... Could it still be possible to get a residency permit (and eventually become a citizen)...? I intended to move once I was financially stable/had some savings.   If anyone could explain how it works, any information, I would appreciate it.  I am a British citizen but in case UK citizens become non-EU citizens after the Brexit vote, I want to prepare for the worst (which would be becoming a non-EU citizen) and make sure I am able to move country.  I have basic Danish language skills and trying to learn Danish still. I have lived in Denmark for 3 months before. I was also considering Faroe Islands as a place to move to.

Is it that she will go back to Romania and then apply for family reunion visa there and after go to lice together in Sweden? Or she should go to Sweden and directly apply for family reunion visa there? Keep in mind that in Romania she is qualified to be granted family reunion visa,  as she have a job and an apartment. And to be qualified in Sweden is hard as she have to go alone and live there and work for six months before i can apply for the visa to join her. "

I am meant to be starting my new job in September however if this doesn't come through in time I may not be able to start the job.   My questions: 1) How long do I have after my visa expires on 31st August before I have to leave the UK?   2) Will I have to leave before this?  Or is there a '28 day grace period' (I read about this on this website)  3) Can I apply for my new Tier 2 from anywhere outside the UK or will I have to go back to Australia to do so?

985,Living without registration of address in Germany?,"I am a non-EU-citizen studying in Amsterdam who did an exchange semester in Germany. Since I am not a EU citizen, I had to get a National Visa (D) for my exchange Semester in Germany.   I remember quite well the officer at the German embassy in Amsterdam telling me that address registration wasn't necessary since I was planning to stay in Germany just for one semester (covered by the validity of my D-visa), not to extend my residence permit, and that they will just send a copy of forms to the city council. Therefore I finished my semester in Germany and now I'm moving back to Amsterdam without having register my address. But I'm starting to have doubts about this and I'm afraid I may have done something irregular. Is it normal? Would this affect my future application for a German visa if want to continue my studies there, e.g, a master or PhD?  "

Now, they have refused to give me my passport, and have issued the ticket and are forcefully asking me to leave the country.  What should I do?  If I leave on my current passport, will this weaken my case? Will I loose my previous passport?  How will I be able to recover my previous passport by law or legally? "

I bought an airplane ticket to my home country (in Europe) and only now I realized that my H1b visa expires 2 days after my return ticket back to the US.

Plan to do this once I return. "
988,The least painful way for tax returns in Germany?,"What is the least painful, but still financially not (that much) burdening way for returning (income) tax in Germany?  I have still not filed for tax returns for 2015. I started working in Germany in late 2015.  I learned that if you are to fill the documents on your own the deadline is the 31 May of the following year -- 31 May 2016 in this case -- which has passed already.  Otherwise if you have Steuerberater (tax advisor) the deadline is 31 December of the following year -- 31 Dec 2016 in this case.  The advisor might be costly but the colleagues argued that he can do a much better job than a person on his own, on the other hand I heard there is an ""easy to use"" software which one can use to fill the tax return on his own.  Do you have any experience on the topic, and what is the best option to go for? "

991,UK Fiancé Visa Complication,My fiancé and I are getting ready to apply for a U.K. Fiancé visa but there is a problem.  We meet the financial requirements and accommodation requirements but how we met and his circumstances are tricky.  We met online 2 years ago while he was still with his ex girlfriend. We talked everyday for a year before becoming romantically involved. However he only officially broke up with his ex girlfriend one month ago so he could bring me over and we could get married. Their relationship was emotionally and physically over before he met me but they never officially broke it off for their 2 kids.  They were renting the same flat together and were still living together up until a month ago when he got enough money together to comfortably leave. The 2 kids who live with her.  I visited him in October and November 2015 and January and March 2016. He visited me in June 2016.  Even though their relationship was unofficially over for a long time it only became official a month ago so he technically cheated on her with me. They were never married.  How do we explain this to the officer who will be reviewing our case? Will the officer be more inclined to refuse if he did technically cheat on her with me? We've been in a genuine relationship for over a year and only want to be able to live and be together. 
992,UK EEA Family permit refused twice,"Me and my partner (Greek citizen) decided to apply for a EEA Family Permit but unfortunately were refused two times so far. And now we are looking for somone  to help us to resolve this issue.  As I’ve already mentioned my EEA FAMILY PERMIT APPLICATION (as an unmarried partner) was refused two times in the last two months (first application submitted on 09 May 2016, refusal on: 25 May 2016 – second application submitted on 17 June 2016, refusal on: 6 July 2016).  When my first application was refused I decided to apply for a second time with adding more evidence of relationship with my unmarried partner (EU citizen) - we added more descriptions in our letters, a testimony letter from my sister saying that this a genuine relationship and we added more private Facebook and WhatsApp conversations and photos of both of us from our travels around Europe in the last 4 years.).  According to the second refusal we failed to give a proof of cohabitation for at least two years. The Clearance Officer also stated that the office attempted to contact my sponsor without success on the mobile number I provided with my application, but that was because she was travelling outside the UK. They left 2 voice messages saying that they will contact her again but that never happened.  Nowt I have some questions that I am concerned about:   Is there any other visa type that can help me to get with my partner? Will lawyer assistance guarantee me to get this Visa? How high the chances are? What are the fees for this kind of assistance? Is it better for me to make a new application or to appeal for the second one (appeal for eea family permit)? How possible is it to prove the cohabitation with my partner since I work in Morocco and my partner works in the UK and I can’t leave my job and go and stay together for two years?  "
993,How to convert a Spanish 90-day to a permanent visa for an EU family member?,"Here is my situation in bullet points:-   I'm British, living in the Philippines. My gf of 4 years is a Filipina (pause for inevitable joke ... ). We wish to permanently relocate to Spain. We asked the Spanish consulate in Manila for the procedure to apply for permanent residence, and they asked us to submit a standard Schengen visa application form. We did this with all of the usual proof of relationship, finance, health, etc. She has now been issued a 90-day Schengen visa, marked 'vis estancia'. Not knowing what to do next, we asked the consulate again and their reply was ""she needs to apply to the local authorities in Spain for a residence permit"".   So my question is, what do we do now?   It seems wrong to enter Spain on a visitors visa when it is our stated intention to remain there permanently, however that appears to be the advice we're being given. Does anybody know what/where/to whom we should apply once in Spain, and what exactly are we applying for? I'm confident that we meet the relationship criteria as specified in 2004/38/EU and also the Spanish equivalent (Royal Decree 240/2007). However are we likely to hit any bureaucratic issues because local officials only understand certified marriage/partnerships? "

A bit about me: I am a dual British/Canadian citizen holding both passports but have lived in Canada most of my life, live there currently and will continue to call Canada my home for at least 7 months per year for the next 10 years or so until I retire. I visit England regularly and my partner and I are planning to buy a used camper van on our next trip over to England to explore the country more fully with the aim of finding a piece of land to buy and homestead and ultimately move to permanently when I retire.  We would park this vehicle on a relatives driveway when  we leave several months later until we return on subsequent trips to England.  My PRIMARY questions are as follows:  1) Can a NON-UK resident buy and register a used vehicle in the UK? 2) Would I be able to DRIVE and INSURE it using my CANADIAN DRIVERS LICENCE? 3) If this is possible does anyone know the process involved? 4) Does that fact that I hold both Canadian and British passports help in the above questions?  Any advice from anyone else who has experience as a non-resident buying a used vehicle in England, registering and insuring it etc. would be greatly appreciated!

998,How long can I stay in Japan after my work contract (status Professor) ended?,"I am currently residing in Japan with the visa status Professor. I know this status is tied to my employment at the university I am working for. This employment will terminate (temporary contract not renewed) on the 31/03. As I do not have any new position lined up, I will be unemployed. This means, I will have to leave Japan after a certain time (unless I manage to find a new job).  My residence card lists the end of my residence period as 30/08, i.e. a few months away.  I have been trying to find out how long I can remain in Japan without overstaying but I have received conflicting information.   I called the Immigration Bureau’s information centre (one with English customer service) and received an answer that effectively said my status will expire on the 1st April and I need to leave Japan on that day; however, I may be able to request some kind of mercy extension that may or may not be granted.  Most notably, I cannot apply for a ‘designated activities’ status that former Student status holders may receive after graduation for three months to find employment. I then went to my local Immigration Bureau branch office. Unfortunately, the officer did not speak English and my Japanese is bad, but I showed him my residence card. His answer was, in effect: after the 1st April I will be granted three months (i.e. until the 30th June) to either find a job or leave the country; during this time, I am able to leave and return under special re-entry permit. I later went to Hello Work and although I told the staff there that my contract expires on 31/03, the lady noted the 30/08 from my residence card as what I assume to be the final date.   As of now, I am inclined to believe the officer at my local Immigration Bureau branch office but some independent confirmation would be great. Which information is correct?    Tl;dr: I will be unemployed from 31/03 but my visa status wouldn’t expire until 30/08. Until when must I have secured employment or left the country?  Am I allowed to leave Japan temporarily during that time? "
999,Renew Spousal Visa UK,"just over two years ago, I, a British citizen married and successfully applied for a spousal visa for my Mexican wife. According to her biometic card, (residence permit - leave to remain) it will expire in late august 2019.  When we applied for the spousal visa two years ago, we spent a hefty sum on legal fees and had to take a day off work to attend the fast-track service in Croyden. Ideally, when renewing the spousal visa, we'd like to do so as cheaply as possible, hopefully without the assistance of lawyers.  I have a couple of questions   Am I correct in thinking that the process can be done entirely online/by post, rather than having to attend in person? What evidence of our relationship will be needed? How soon in advance of the August deadline do we need to start doing things? We don't want to leave it too late, but I also presume that it's possible to attempt to renew the spousal visa 'too early'.   Many thanks "
1000,Acquiring Dutch Passport,"My father was born in the Netherlands but at the time of my birth (1989 in RSA) he was no longer a Dutch Citizen, is there any hope for me getting a Dutch passport? Please help.  EDIT:  My father left the Netherlands when he was two and, as I mentioned before, lost his citizenship by naturalising in RSA when he was 39, can he not regain his citizenship via the Option procedure? (See condition 5 under 'who can apply' in Option procedure) If he regains his Dutch citizenship, I can in turn, receive mine if he acknowledges me (we would need to provide DNA evidence according to Dutch citizenship by birth/acknowledgement). Does this all sound plausible? "
1001,How can I learn Cantonese in Guangdong?,"I'm looking for a way to learn Cantonese in Guangdong.  But I have not been able to find a language school offered by universities that teach Cantonese, although that is common for Mandarin.  The only language programs I found that teaches Cantonese in China are in Hong Kong. But I prefer the one in Guangdong (Guangzhou is the best, but I'm fine with either Dongguan or Shenzhen as well).  Except for attending a language program, it is very difficult to self-study Cantonese since its learning resources are very scarce.   So, is there any university that offers Cantonese language program? Or is there any public or private language courses (such as the French one in Paris)? "
1002,Remote independent contractor needs short onsite training in US - what is the Visa requirement?,"As a small US based firm, we have offered a contract to a candidate as a remote independent contractor, who does not stay or work in the US. We would require the person to attend our in person 1 week training first, post which s/he can work with us from his/her country remotely. What visa would be required for the person to attend the training in person?  Is a B1 visa sufficient, if we do not pay the person for his/her attending the workshop but just reimburse the costs of his/her travel and stay? Or does this person count as an employee of our firm, and this must be a work visa? "
1003,Can I change my employer while current company H1B amendment is in progress?,"I am in the process of FTE conversion. And my current employer had filed H1B Relocation amendment on June 2018 which is in RFE status.  My new employer (immigration team) is saying they are not able to file Visa since my Amendment is in RFE:     Yes, we do need to wait for the amendment before filing H1 Transfer petition.       The reason is that  with amendment petitions, you are technically not in H-1B status.       You are able to work for the employer filing the amendment petition, based on the receipt notice for your case.        As you are technically not in H-1B status until the amendment petition has been approved, we cannot file H1 Transfer petition until it has been approved.   Is there any specific rule available in USCIS? If so, Can you provide me the link so that i can check with my new employer immigration team.   The reason for this question is that i have seen my friends who has got filed for two or three Visa transfer petition parallel and they don't get any issues with USCIS. So my case, Amendment is a petition which was filed by previous company (but it is in RFE).  So my new company can file the petition (Visa transfer) in parallel or not?  "
1004,UK visa application withdrawal and reapplying,Do any one of you have experience withdrawing an UK Tier 2 visa application? If so I have some questions.   Does it affect the chances of getting a visa when you reapply? When reapplying should you disclose that you have previously withdrawn an application? If so in what way should you disclose? (Given that there is no specific question on the visa application form asking whether the applicant has previously withdrawn an application). Will UKVI look at the previously withdrawn application (which contains incorrect documents) while making a decision on your current application?   Apologies for the multiple questions. These questions have been rarely asked and answered so though this post can help many people in the future.

If I use it, I will get the federal income tax back, as the online tax reporting tool (Windstar) tells me: [website]Tax in Germany is generally higher for my case than US tax. But do I have to pay taxes at all if I use the tax treaty? Or do I have to pay later when I am back in Germany?  I don't know how long I will be here, but probably altogether around 3-5 years.  "

1010,"Which German language test would be more recognized as demonstrating ""command of the language"" when applying for the blue card/permanent residency?","In the German Residence Act (Gesetz über den Aufenthalt, die Erwerbstätigkeit und die Integration von Ausländern im Bundesgebiet), it is stated in Section 9 that to obtain a permanent settlement permit (Niederlassungserlaubnis), the foreigner should have a sufficient command of the German language. Also, in Section 19, it is stated that the time required for holders of an EU Blue Card are to be issued with a permanent settlement permit can be reduced from 33 months to 21 months, if the foreigner has a sufficient command of the German language.  The Act further defines ""sufficient command"" to mean B1 level in terms of CEFR.   However, I am not sure what would practically serve as a proof of this ""sufficient command of German"". The Nationality Act (Staatsangehörigkeitsgesetz) refers to exams leading to the Zertifikat Deutsch, which seems to basically be the B1 certificate issued by Goethe-Institut. However, there also exist other types of German exams, such as TestDaF and DSH, commonly used for university applications. I wonder whether results from those exams could also be used as a proof, and if so, what would the conversion scale be between their scores and B1 level. Also, I'm not sure if certificates issued from other organizations, such as the foreign language center from a German university, would count.  This issue was a bit confusing for me since many German universities apparently prefer TestDaF or DSH to Goethe-Institut certificates. For example, University of Stuttgart requires Goethe C2 certificate... which sounds practically impossible. If this is the case, does that mean students who initially came to Germany with TestDaF would need to obtain the Zertifikat Deutsch again, just for the purpose of permanent settlement application? Could the reason for universities' aversion towards Goethe certificates be that they are easier to obtain than the other two exams (which I doubt)?  If a certificate from Goethe-Institut is required for the permanent residence permit/blue card application, then I guess I should start preparing towards them instead of TestDaF. I'm already studying in a German university in a program taught in English, so I didn't need those exams in the beginning. "
1011,Working in Norway but living in Sweden. How and where will my wife get health care?,"I am a Norwegian citizen who lives and works in Norway, very near the Swedish border. It is so close that if I move across the border, I could comfortably commute every day to my work in Norway.  My wife is a Russian citizen. Due to very stringent rules in Norway, we do not qualify for family reunification in Norway at this point. (The Norwegian authorities (UDI) demand that in 2016 my salary should have been at a certain amount, and my salary was lower than that amount in 2016. Right now my salary is high enough, but that does not satisfy UDI. They consider the previous calendar year.)  Therefore, it would be good if I moved across the Swedish border, so that she could get a residence permit in Sweden under EU freedom of movement law. I would keep working in Norway, but live in Sweden with her. As far as I understand, this is allowed under EU law.  My question is about her health care. Would she be entitled to full public health care in Sweden? Or would we have to get a private health insurance for her?

1013,Is there any way to track the UK EEA Family Member Residence Card?,"I want to ask if there is any way to track UK EEA Family Member Residence card. I am worry about the application of my wife because we sent the documents 2 months ago and I read in internet that the biometric letter generally arrives at maximum one month after the payment is taken (I read the processing times of many people in many boards).   We talked with a friend and she delivered the documents in March, an email arrived her in May saying that they have her documents, after another month (in June) she received the Biometric letter, and two weeks ago (July), the COA letter arrived to her. It means that she had to wait for 4 months to get the COA. Is it normal?   She couldn't work for 2 months because she didn't have any document and neither the COA letter.   Do you know if there is a way to track the UK EEA Family Member Residence Card?  Can I call someone to ask for the status of my application?  Do you think the case of my friend is special? Because her passport expires in December of this year and it suppose that she will get the residence card in November, maybe for that it takes so long.    Do you know why in this period the COA letter for the EEA Family Member Residence Card are taking so long? "

My visa process was done in Singapore and I applied from Bangladesh.  I'm going to be in Canada for 4 year undergrad course. The online application doesn't say anything about a medical exam.

1015,Long visitor visa for France is refused,"Despite of hiring a very reputed emigration/visa agent (from France), my long visitor visa (was refused by consulate. The reason of refusal was :reason of stay is unreliable"". Surely this is very shocking when it affects all your long term plans; and you have put everything in order along with school admission documents for children and very solid work and bank profiles.   While third party (TLS contact) accepting application mentioned that it might take 2 to 4 or even 6 weeks for such cases, the decision for my application was taken in merely 3 days without any regard to efforts and preparation gone in it. The same 3rd party (TLS Contact) also mentioned during application that authority speaks English. But when I was called from Consulate (in 2 days), she did not speak any word in English. I was lost before I could say anything and the call was dropped.  Next day I got mail to collect the passport, just to find out that visa was refused- all done in 3 days only for 4 passports, while even a plain schengen visa is issued in 1 week.  Now what are the options I have, as I am very keen to apply for the same visa again. Should I appeal against the decision? Or its not worth it?   The visa type applied was long Sejour (visitor). The children's application was asked to be changed to Student Visa during application from TLS contact. Indian national with sound finance and businesses in multiple countries.  "
1016,EU citizens in Germany: is any registration required beyond Anmeldung?,"I have moved to Germany as an EU (British) citizen, and completed the standard Anmeldung upon arrival. I work remotely for an Italian employer. Are there any further bureaucratic processes to go through as an EU citizen1 who plans to remain in Germany indefinitely? For instance in Austria, in addition to my Anmeldung, I had to get an Anmeldebescheinigung  (requiring proof of employment, etc.), in order to stay for longer than three months. Does Germany have something similar, or is the Anmeldung truly the only formality required for EU citizens?  Incidentally, I asked about this at my local Meldeamt and was told verbally that the Anmeldung really is sufficient. However, the staff member who told me this seemed a little confused about the situation, and was clearly in a hurry to get through with me and on to the next person in the enormous queue at the counter. In any case, I think a firm written answer to this question would be useful for others in a similar situation.    1I realize that in my own case, Brexit may complicate things in the long run, but please ignore that factor for the purposes of this question.

1020,Which items should I declare at the customs when returning to the US after several years of living abroad?,"Context: I have been living in Japan for about 26 years. I will be moving to a guest house in the US to look for a permanent residence as an US citizen. I will be entering through an airport with hand luggages only (no separate shipments).  I'd like to get through the customs with minimum hassle.   According to an article on cbp.gov, I may enter as a non-resident.     If you have lived abroad for more than three years, you may enter as a nonresident.  When moving to the US, a complete inventory is required:     When completing the Customs and Border Protection Form (CBP Form) 6059B,[..] for accompanying goods [..] the statement that the goods are ""household effects"" is not enough information. The complete inventory of imported goods will be treated as the packing list and must be provided to CBP upon request.    Reading into the last quote, the correct way seems to be:   List ""household effects"" and ""personal effects"" on the back of the CBP form. Be prepared to show a complete inventory of the things I will be carrying with me.   So what should I include in the complete inventory? There must be a cut-off line between the very broad ""my things"" and the very specific ""a spare set of bolts for the dog crate"", and also between the obvious/essential/non-dutiable ""sanitary goods"" and the non-obvious/non-essential/potentially-dutiable ""MacBook Pro 13-inch"".  Just for example's sake, currently I have listed:  Laptop computer Mobile phone Clothes Kefir yogurt Pet food (salmon based, packed in Canada) Bicycle Dog crate   Should I write down every bits of articles such as sunglasses, sunscreen lotion, toothbrush, purse, comb, batteries, bike lights, backpack, plastic bags and so on?

1022,UK Biometrics Residency Permits issued overseas,"UKVI have started to roll out Biometric Residency Permits (BRPs) for overseas applicants to comply with EU regulations, building on the in-country programme commenced in 2008. The overseas rollout is by location rather than visa category which were used for in-country introduction. By the end of July the rollout of BRP to all overseas locations should be complete.  Visa applicants who are granted leave will be issued with a vignette covering the first 30 days of their leave. On arrival in the UK it is important that they collect their BRP card as soon as it is ready.   So instead of getting an entry clearance good for 1 - 5 years, applicants will get a vignette good for 30 days only. They should use the 30 days to arrive in the UK and collect their BRP so that they can prove their lawful presence in the UK.  If the terms of their visa require police registration within 10 days, the person needs to collect their BRP first because it's a requirement for police registration.  But what if the person cannot travel in time to meet the 30 day requirement?  If, for any reason at all, their plans are disrupted and their vignette expires or is in jeopardy of expiring before they can collect their BRP? "

1024,Moving from UK to Germany - Open pension account to later buy house,"Hope the question isn't too convoluted, but here goes: We are moving to Germany, permanently, into full time employed roles - from the UK where we currently have our own business. To reduce my business tax obligation here in the UK it was suggested by my accountant that I add funds to my pension.  I'd like to add those funds to a German pension plan which later allows me to apply some or all of those funds towards the purchase of a house and increase my down payment - but it of course needs to be seen by HMRC as a 'regular' pension plan in Germany.  Questions are:   Can I do this / do you know of any plans that allow this? Can I open the German pension plan now (a month before I arrive there and start work / have a bank account, etc... this is necessary to move the funds to the pension plan before my business year end at the end of this month? If 2 can't happen, can I move the funds to a UK pension plan now and then transfer them next month to a German plan (and how would that work)?  "

We live in Spain and my wife is here as a family member of an EU citizen with an Article 10 residence card.  Her sister is dependent on us and my understanding is that she should be able to join us here on that basis. However, I haven't been able to find any clear information about the proof that's required for her dependency. We do send her money regularly but not on any particular schedule or a specific amount. Basically we send money whenever she needs it. Would this likely be a problem? If we were to provide bank statements, would it be expected that the payments stick to a specific schedule and be the same amount each time?  In addition, are there any specifics on how long the regular payments should have been made for, or does it need to be a certain minimum amount? Right now we've been sending payments on and off for around the last six months, usually €100 or €200 at a time. Are there any rules specifying the amounts and frequency of money sent to a family member for them to be considered 'dependent'?  I would appreciate it if anybody has any experience following this process and can give me any more specific information as I've had trouble finding any online. "
1036,Get EHIC after I lived outside the EU my whole life,My parents are European and they got me Hungarian citizenship. They migrated to a non-EU country several years before I was born. Since 3 months ago I'm living in France. I think that here paying social security is obligatory.  What's the procedure for getting my EHIC from France? I heard from somebody that I need to ask in Budapest for a questionnaire S1. Is it so? Can I do it via Internet and send it to my French address?  
1037,Living in Australia after studying,"I applied to an Australian university and got rejected because I do not meet the GTE requirements. I'm sure it was because I was honest with them and said I wanted to live in Australia after my studies.    Here is what the GTE requirement says:     An applicant needs to show they are coming to Australia temporarily to gain a quality education.    At the same time:      The GTE requirement is not designed to exclude those students who, after studying in Australia, go on to develop the skills required by the Australian labour market and apply to obtain permanent residence.      Does this mean that I can apply for work visa only after I work for some time in my home country (or some other country)? Is student visa -&gt; work visa forbidden?  "
1038,US citizen: should my Filipina wife give birth abroad (in the Philippines) or in the US?,"I am a US citizen but I live abroad as a permanent resident in the Philippines. I've been married to a Filipina since early 2016. We've decided to move back to the US since my income in the Philippines is too low to cover our living expenses and my savings have been virtually exhausted.  However, my wife is currently two months pregnant. Right now she's in the middle of waiting for her medical report to come back (it'll be another 2 months for TB sputum analysis) so we can proceed with her visa appointment. If all goes as planned, we hope to be in the US by December, and she would presumably give birth in January. Note: because of my low income and savings, I am planning to rely on my proof of SSS credits to file the I-864W. However, while researching to ask this question, I just read something online at Immihelp that says only my work while we are married can be counted towards this waiver. Is that right?  Anyway, my back to my main question:  I am hoping that someone can give me advice on whether it would be best to proceed with our plans to come back to the US by December and give birth in January. We would probably move back to the state of Georgia, if I can get my old job back, or to Tennessee otherwise.  Would my wife be able to use Obamacare, Emergency Medicare, or other services for her labor if we go back to the US (probably Tennessee/Georgia)? Our goal is to pay the least amount possible while still giving birth in a respectable hospital. In the Philippines they have a nice Hospital called St. Luke's, which is about 10 times cheaper than hospitals in the US, but they will turn you away if you don't have enough money, so that would be a bit concerning if there were any complications and we weren't able to save up enough by then. "
1039,Employment in France after a master's degree,"Is it difficult for foreigners over 36 to find a job in France, after acquiring a master's degree there? My wife and I are planning to move to France from India. We already have over a decade of work experience here. We have enrolled into a French university to upskill and find a job in France.  Does anyone know if this is a risk as French companies might prefer younger employees? I know there will not be overt discrimination by age or race, but there could be some underlying trends. We were worried because we have taken a loan for this. We do not speak French now, but are planning to learn it soon.   "
1040,Question about Green Card for L1 at port of entry,I have previously been to the US for 4 times on a B1 visa. A couple of my stays were for 89 days. A couple of my stays were less than a month.  Now I am travelling to the US on an L1B visa. Any advice related to questions at port of entry will be helpful.  I read in one of the forums that there was a question about the green card by the CBP officer.   Would you apply for GC? If given opportunity would you go for GC?   What would be the best way to answer questions?  EDIT: Please note that I am travelling with my wife and infant child. Both have valid L2 visas. It's their first time. 
1041,Re-entering US when STEM OPT expires in less than 6 months,"My US F-1 STEM OPT expires in May 2019 and I am planning to travel outside US in Dec 2018. If I return to US in first week of Jan 2019, my STEM OPT will be valid for less than 5 months when I try to enter. Will that be a problem? More importantly, will it be an even bigger problem while boarding the flight to US since airlines may strictly require 6 months validity whereas CBP may be more lenient, or not?  I have valid passport, valid F-1 visa (valid till 2020), valid EAD card (till May 2019), valid I-20 (till May 2019), and a job. "
1042,How can I retain German permanent residence if I need to leave the country?,"I am a permanent resident of Germany with Indian citizenship. I have some problems in India and I have to go back to India. If I stay away longer than 6 months, my German status will be cancelled.  What is the procedure so that I can stay in india and maintain status in Germany.  As I may need to back in future, how could I come and live in Germany? Could I buy property in Germany, like a house and register my name there, but still live in India? What if I visited Germany in another year?   I'm looking for a solution so that I don't lose my status. "
1043,How long is I-797C H-1B receipt valid?,"I have got my name selected in 2018 H-1B lottery results, but unfortunately, the current employer doesn't have any suitable job for me in its USA location.  Should I push them to assign a suitable job to me ASAP or can I wait?  Would my lottery expire?  I mean would I have to apply again in the 2019 lottery? If not, how long does it remain valid? "
1044,Is it possible to get a job in US (with H-1B sponsorship) during/after postdoc from USA?,"Postdoc scholars usually come to US on J-1 visa. I know that somehow people who do PhD and postdoc both from US, manage to get a job with H-1B sponsorship in my field of expertise. However, I already have a PhD from Canada and currently looking for postdoc opportunities in Canada as well as USA. Long term employment opportunities are way better in USA in my field. Therefore, I want to move to US for postdoc first. Will it be possible to get an employer who can sponsor H-1B during/after my postdoc in USA? OR is there something which I am missing that makes a difference between me and people who also do their PhD from USA?  Thanks, "
1045,US visitor visa for Canadian Permanent Residents,I read on another forum that Canadian PRs are scrutinized/denied US visitor (and other) visas more than others. Why is this the case? If I am a Canadian PR I'm less likely to overstay in the US since I will eventually return to Canada (or so the logic should go?).  
1046,"Can my wife get a Norwegian national identification number before her EU/EEA residence card, or does she have to wait?","I am a Norwegian citizen. My wife is a Russian citizen.  In November 2017 we moved to Sweden together. We utilized EU/EEA law and the rights of EEA family members to apply for a EU residence card for her. The Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) issued her the card after roughly six months. Six months is also the EU mandated maximum wait time for such cards.  The good thing about these rights is that she was able to live legally with me in Sweden from day one, even while waiting for the card. Even better, since I was working in Sweden, the Swedish Tax Agency (Skatteverket) issued her a Swedish national identification number (personnummer) within weeks of moving to Sweden. She enjoyed the same processing time for that as I (as an EEA national) did.  At the moment I work in Norway (we live near the border and I commute across the border to work) and we intend to move to Norway in a few months. As we have lived in an EU country for several months, we can now enjoy the same EU/EEA rules we did in Sweden while moving to Norway. The Norwegian agency UDI has confirmed this. The process will be largely similar to that we went through when moving to Sweden.  However, there is one issue I am unsure about. I called the Norwegian Tax Administration (Skatteetaten) and one representative told me on the phone that she can only get a Norwegian national identification number (personnummer) after her residence card has been issued by Norway. UDI has informed me that we can expect that due to their workload, it may take six months or more to issue this card, and they are not always able to comply with the EU deadline.  Living in Norway without a national identification number can be a challenge, and such a number is required to have a bank account, a phone number, get medical treatment, etc.  There are some reasons I am unsure about this:   In Sweden they issued her a national identification number within a few weeks of arriving in Sweden. I am unsure if this is just the Swedish authorities being nice, or if it is some sort of right she has according to EU law. If the latter, I wonder if the same applies to Norway. Some people in the Swedish Tax agency also claimed that she needed to wait until her residence card was issued before she could get a national identification number. The confusion might have arisen due to the fact that when you apply for family reunification per the Swedish rules, that is true. However, she had the right to get a national identification number earlier due to EU rules, and our case followed EU rules. I am wondering if the person I talked to in the Norwegian Tax Administration might also not have been aware of that distinction.   So, is there a difference here? Are Swedish authorities just being nice? Or was it some sort of right? And is there a difference between Norway and Sweden? Can she get a personal identification number in Norway before her residence card is issued?  Also, even if the directive is silent about this, what is the actual Norwegian practice on this?  "
1047,UK visa (EEA family permit),"I would like to check with you regarding a visa application to enter the UK.  I would like to visit Scotland / England. I'm holding a Thai passport.  I've checked on the UK government website previously indicated that I need to apply for a Standard Visitor visa. However I'm now living in The Netherlands and holding a Dutch residence permit card as a partner (unmarried) of a Dutch citizen. On the website they also stated that I may not need a visa if both the following apply:   You’re travelling with or visiting your partner or family : Yes, I will traveling with my Dutch partner. You don’t need a visa if both the following apply: you have an Article 10 residence card: Yes, I have a Dutch residence card your partner or family member is your sponsor: Either myself or my partner can be a sponsor.   Otherwise, you should apply for a family permit if your family member or partner are from the European Economic Area (EEA), a Standard Visitor visa, if they’re from outside the EEA.  I would like to ask for clarification/confirmation that am I eligible to apply for the EEA family permit. And if I only apply for the EEA family permit, is that sufficient to allow me to travel to the UK together with my partner?   Regarding the documents that I need to provide in order to apply for an EEA family permit, do I need to translate from Dutch to English (at the rear of my Dutch residence card, there is a statement of my rights to stay in Netherlands as a member of Dutch family)? Does my partner need to apply for any other permit as both of us are staying outside UK at this moment.   Thanks for answering. "
1048,Renewal of residence and work permit in Spain,"I have a work visa in Spain for 3 years, which is about to expire. On my TIE, it says ""RESIDENCIA Y TRABAJO"". I would like to know the procedure to renew it. My employer is happy to extend my contract, but they are not sure about the procedure. Should my employer give me a new contract first? Can they give me a work contract without a validity for my NIE? Can any one explain the procedure?  P.S I am from India. "
1049,Canadian citizen applying for Green Card while in the US + side question,"I am an American citizen. My girlfriend lives in Canada. I have been going over possibilities of trying to get her a green card legally, and one possibility has me a bit stuck.  A Canadian citizen may come over to the US for up to 6 months. During this time, if they apply for a Green Card, could the process be completed and the individual be granted a Green Card in those 6 months, or would that simply not be enough time?  The other question/option is for her to get an employment-based Green card. Would that be a much more viable option as opposed to coming over here staying and attempting to get one while over here? "
1050,How does the proof-of-financial-means requirement work for EU citizens when migrating to Spain?,"In 2012, Spain (in violation of EU law, as far as I know) started requiring EU citizens wishing to establish residency to ""produce evidence of sufficient financial means to support themselves.""1  What do I need to bring to the table to satisfy their requirements? What kind of evidence are Spanish officials known to accept, or reject, as sufficient proof?  Evidence of health insurance may also be required. How is this handled if you don't yet have health insurance in Spain? Can you get health insurance coverage prior to applying for the residencia?  "
1051,Medical insurance by not for profit orgs in Australia?,I have migrated from the USA to Australia as a Permanent Resident and am looking for private medical insurance   I am searching my options between not for profit medical insurance providers (like gmhba and hif) and the usual (for profit) medical insurance providers. How big are the differences in terms of price/premiums and service/access to healthcare? Are there any general rules about which type of insurance is preferable or does it depend strongly on your needs and financial means? 
1052,Am I likely to have issues playing DVDs I take with me during an international move?,"I remember some time when the DVDs were supposed to be playable only on the DVD players bought in the same geographic zone as the DVD. I never tried because at that time I was not an expatriate.  I still have a collection of DVDs, but I now use a computer to play my DVDs, which I plug to my TV screen.  I am wondering, if I buy a new computer/new DVD player on the continent I am moving to, or buy a DVD on that new continent and play it on my old computer, will that work? In other words, should I give up my collection of DVDs when moving and should I not buy new DVDs?  My ""old"" continent was Europe, my ""new"" continent is North America. "
1053,I'm in the US on an F-1 visa. Can I drive with my Italian driving license?,"I have been living in Chicago for a couple of years (not continuous) on an F-1 visa. I have not needed a car so far, so I never got an Illinois driving license, but I'll be moving to California soon, and I will definitely need a car there. Since I have only ever driven manual transmission cars, I'd like to practice driving an automatic on my friend's car.  I have a valid Italian driving license, but I cannot figure out if I am allowed to drive with it or not. According to 625 ILCS 5/6-102, a non-resident who has a valid driving license from their home state does not need an Illinois driving license. When I pay taxes (from my job on campus) I have to file as a non-resident alien, so I would surmise that I am not a resident of the US. But I do live in Chicago. Does that make me a resident of Illinois, but not of the US? That doesn't make sense to me, but I don't want to rely on sense alone.  I have asked the office for international students at my university, and they have been no help at all. "
1054,"How can I ""legalize"" my US car in Mexico?","I have a US-licensed vehicle, currently in Mexico, and with a temporary import permit (meaning as long as my residency status is valid, my car is also legal in Mexico).

1055,How much savings/income do I need for a Chilean rentista visa?,"I've asked several people (including a couple of attorneys) about the requirements for a rentista (retiree) visa in Chile.  Everybody I've talked with agrees that I need to be able to demonstrate either a certain amount of savings in a bank account, or a certain amount of income sourced outside of Chile.  What nobody seems to know, however, is the amount that I need to qualify.  Even when I ask an attorney, he'll just ask me how much I have, and then say that I have ""enough"" or ""not enough"" when I tell him.  Is there a minimum amount of savings/income required to qualify for a rentista visa?  If so, what are the amounts?  If not, why not? "
1056,Can I work for a British Umbrella Company while resident in Italy?,"I am currently living and working in the UK, but may need to move to Italy within the next year.  My current employer is willing to employ me as a contractor while I am abroad but do not want to get involved with having non-resident permanent staff, which I can understand. In both Italy and for the period I'm still in the UK, the most tax efficient way of handling the situation would be to work for a British umbrella company; has anyone tried this strategy (working for a British umbrella company whilst being resident in an other EU country)?  And are there any legal pit falls I should be aware of from either the UK or Italian side?  Edit: Specifically, I'm aware of the bilateral tax and national insurance agreements between Italy and the UK, and know it is legal for me to work for a UK company and live in Italy. What I'm concerned by is that there may be regulations I'm not aware of around contracting, working from home, etc and also if anyone has actually worked with an umbrella company in this type of scenario? "
1057,How are foreign savings/current accounts taxed in US?,"When moving to the US on a H1B or L1 visa, how are savings and current accounts in Europe taxed? Are the interest on them taxed? What about changes of exchange rate between USD/GBP/EUR from one year to the next? "
1058,Travelling outside the US with a J1 visa: exact definition of the 30 days,"I am French, and I am currently working in the US as a postdoctoral researcher under a J1 visa. I am planning to go back to France in August for research purpose, but I don't know exactly what document I need. I am especially trying to find out if there is something special to do for a more than 30 days leave, and what is the exact definition of the 30 days limit.  I have a valid visa, a valid DS2019, and a signature on it which allows me to travel. However until now, all my travels were way less than 30 days so I never had to solve this question. But to my understanding, if I am traveling more than 30 days I need a special document to be signed.  Question 1: Is that true and if yes, what is that document?  The tricky thing in my case, is that I would like to travel exactly 30 days (flights are cheaper on the selected dates than happen to be exactly 30 days). So I have 2 questions:  Question 2: What happens if my first flight US->France leaves US at 1pm on July 30, 2016, and I am flying back on August 28, 2016, arriving in the US at 11am (if I am not mistaken it corresponds exactly to 30 days, and is less than 30*24 hours)?  Question 3: What happens if my first flight US->France leaves US at 1pm on July 30, 2016, and I am flying back on August 28, 2016, arriving in the US at 9pm (if I am not mistaken it corresponds exactly to 30 days, but more than 30*24 hours)?

1060,Moving girlfriend with me from US to UK - visas?,"I may be moving from the US to the London for a job offer and I'd like my girlfriend to come with me.  We would live there for a few years at least, so she'd like to find a job there.  What options are available for this situation regarding visas?  Should I tell my company about her, hoping they'll help?  We don't want to get married, but have lived together for a while so I consider it a substantive relationship.  We're both US citizens.  "
1061,To US with ESTA and then marriage,"I live in the US with a green card (over 10 years). My plan is to apply for US citizenship soon and have my girlfriend come to US with ESTA at the end of September (she was already in US in June for 2.5 weeks). When she comes here, and if all goes well between us two, after two months or so of her being in US we would get married and then start filling out paperwork for her legal immigration status and eventually for her green card.   I know that legally she can only be in US for 90 days, but that the paperwork for her immigration will take more than 3 months.   Thus, will it create any problems if her legal 90 day status ends and she becomes illegal, but the paperwork is underway already?   In other words, US Citizen + ESTA tourist = marriage during 90 day period: issues? concerns? works? doesn't work?  "
1062,Transfering Money From China to the US,"What is the cheapest way to convert Chinese Yuan to US Dollars? The amount is between 35,000 and 300,000 CNY; a fairly large amount.

1063,visa and passport,"I was working in Thailand, I had some problems at my home so I resigned at the company, the employer said he is not accepting my resignation and is not cancelling my visa or work permit either. They kept my passport (old one which had all my visas and shows my travel history) which they have still not returned to me.  I want to go back to take some action against them but I want to go on my own visa.  I want to know how can I figure out if they have cancelled my work permit and visa to Thailand? What way can I confirm if they have or have not cancelled my work permit and visa? "
1064,"Will my Danish residency permit be revoked if I end my Danish researcher's position earlier and if not, will it allow me to work outside Denmark?","I'm non-EU citizen doing a postdoc at a US university, and I'm not from one of the countries with a relatively strong passport. My goal is to get a job in a EU country that issues a Blue Card and eventually get myself one. I'm trying to see here if I can get closer to my goal by taking the following route: suppose I get a position as a researcher with more than 400,000 annual DKK salary. (I've good chance in getting that). By the ""pay limit scheme"" mentioned in [website]My question is: if I terminate the job contract in before the end, will they terminate my Danish permit as well after 14 days? Or will it still be valid? In the second case, can I use this Danish permit to search for jobs, say in France? "
1065,Moving to Russia from Germany,"I (German citizen) have been accepted to a university in St Petersburg and would like to rent an apartment with my girlfriend (Russian citizen).  How does this work roughly? What paperwork will be necessary for this? We are looking for an apartment now and will contact the realtor who is offering it. What documents will I need to rent an apartment apart from my passport and study visa?  When I will have moved in, do I need to register in some government office? Since I am spending the majority of my time in Russia, will this apartment be my main residence [Hauptwohnsitz], or should this anyway remain in Germany, while I am registered in the Russian apartment as my second residence? "
1066,How important is knowing German in Germany?,"I was recently speaking to a German about learning the language, and he said not to bother – whether planning a permanent move or only a short visit, you can get by just fine, as everyone there speaks English anyway.  I was wondering: How true is that? Does really everyone know English? How much of the population is comfortable speaking it? Are people happy speaking English casually, or do most people still prefer to converse in German? "
1067,Do I need to provide proof of qualification for a Czech work permit?,"I'm a software developer and I got a job offer from a Czech company. I'm having issues authenticating my degree due to summer vacations and I don't want to make my employer wait for too long. So, I decided to apply for a work permit (employee card) because I read that it is not necessary to have a degree for it (as opposed to the blue card). My future employer is providing the proof of accommodation and other requirements.  However, while some official pages list ""proof of qualification for the job"" as an optional requirement, other (also official) pages mention it as a regular requirement. This is confusing me.  So my question is this: Is it possible to get the employee card to work in the IT field without any diploma, provided I have all the other requirements? Would I need some proof of previous jobs? As far as I know, software development is not a regulated profession. "

This post is more about seeking for settlement options)  My girlfriend's UK Visitor Visa was cancelled because we naively expanded our plans after getting a visitor visa.   Her visa got cancelled at the UK border. If we get married and get her a dependent visa, would this change the situation? If not, I'm also wondering if me getting British citizenship would change the matter, because I'm eligible to apply for it.  I really appreciate people reading this post and giving us any official pointers. "
1070,"Argentinian working remotely for the US by contract, trying to move to The Netherlands, but how?","this is my first post here. I was kinda hesitant on posting the question because I think I exhausted every channel already, but I guess I don't lose anything by ""just asking"" and know your experiences.  For the past three years I've been living in Brazil (I have a permanent visa now), and for the past two I've been working remotely for a US company, the contract has no expiration date, and it's a company where I can stay for years, so it's pretty stable.  My income (in USD), before taxes, is above the average. And I work as a System Engineer (Although I don't have a degree) consultant. I'm 31 years old.  According to my family, I have Austrian roots, but all the documentation was lost between WWI and WWII, so there's no way I can prove that (believe me, I've tried)  Because of the Mercosur, I can stay in Brazil as long as I want, but I really want to move to The Netherlands, Amsterdam to be more specific, it's a city I love, and I've been there around 6 times, so there's little surprise for me in the day to day basis (meaning that I already have an idea on how a ""normal life-not tourist"" would be).  I've been to the immigration services in Amsterdam last time I went there and tried to get as much information as possible, and the only two things I've got in clean (to get a resident visa) were these:   If I want to enter The Netherlands as a hard worker guy, I need to fill a lot of paperwork, present myself as a start up, present and idea and a plan to the government and tell them how new and fresh my company idea is, what's in it for The Netherlands government, a detailed economy plan, how many Dutch employees I plan to have, a Dutch business partner, and a big list of etceteras that, honestly, sounds bizarre. Not to mention that the government will accept around 100 applications per year and they'll review them all and let around 10 of those applications in. So it's basically a no. Get a partner, any partner, no matter the gender, register under the same address, show the government that you live together, no need to marry her/him.   Now, on my next trip, coming next September, I'll be staying almost three months in Amsterdam (tourist visa is 90 days max for me), so I'll be trying to achieve point 2 while I look for an alternative, since point 1 looks impossible. I'm just a simple consultant and I don't have the infrastructure of a Start up.  I never thought this was going to be easy, but never it was going to be this hard!   And my question is: Does it really come to this for me? Considering I have stability, I work remotely, I have a good salary, I'm single (so no strings attached), I want to do everything the legal way, isn't there another way?  Thanks a lot in advance for reading this and for any replies you post here! "

She has a Dutch passport.  We are trying to work out what to do about health insurance for her. From reading the other answers on this website, I have surmised the following:   Since she is not covered by another EU country she will be not be covered in France.  If she gets a job working more than 60 hours per month she will be covered.   There is no guarantee she will be able to find a job straight away. Should she buy health insurance? Or is it possible to 3 months and apply for ""couverture maladie universelle"" or is that not applicable? Is there some way she could be covered by being my partner? "

I will also be applying for a residence permit and assume that I will also qualify for a blue card by virtue of being the spouse.

1077,"Just moved to Netherlands for a couple of years, but I am on US payroll. Do I need to pay dutch tax?","I moved to Netherlands with my family about a month ago. I am on the US payroll and receive bi-weekly pay checks in the US. Do I need to pay income tax in Netherlands?

1080,How to obtain NIE/ NIF for Spain from India?,"I have recently been accepted for Master in Pure and Applied Logic in University of Barcelona. However, while trying to apply for scholarships I am facing some problems. They are listed below,   While applying for General Grant, I observed that for non-EU students like me I need to satisfy the following requirement (see here), ""In the case of being a foreigner with a nationality of a non-EU country, they will be required to have an NIE with a permanent resident status and that they certify that the applicant and / or one of their main supporters of the family unit are workers employed by another person or own during the year prior to the call."" So my questions are,    How do I get an NIE with a permanent resident status from India before going to Barcelona? Since neither I nor any of my family members have ever gone to Spain, I was wondering whether there is any other way to meet the requirement ""that they certify...prior to the call.""  While applying for this scholarship, I observed that I need to enter my NIF number in this form. So my questions are,    How do I get an NIF from India before going to Barcelona?      N. B.: Please note that this is my first question on this site. If there is anything in the post that should be edited, please let me know in the comments before voting to close or downvoting it. "

1086,Information regarding ways to freely travel within Europe during renewal of Permit in Italy,"My fiancee lives in Austria and I live in Italy. Recently, she went on a trip outside Europe and would be returning soon. I found out today that my permit of stay/residence permit will be expiring one day after her return to Austria. And since the Italian system is completely broken, my fingerprint date is three months after the expiry date. Therefore six months would have passed before I can meet her. Due to other extraneous circumstances it would be infeasible for her to visit Italy.   Therefore, my question is what are my options to travel to Austria?    I have the national identity card and have used it to travel within Europe. Although it does mention that my citizenship is not EU/Swiss.  I can apply for a temporary Permit of Stay, but colleagues at the International office in my workplace told me that I need to show a need to travel (work related, extraneous family circumstances). I came across this question related to a similar situation in Germany. I think it's the german version of the temporary permit of stay. I can apply for a Schengen Visa in the Austrian Embassy in Bratislava, Ljubljana or Munich.    What are my other options? Can I somehow show need to travel?  "
1087,European passport return service - copying other passport pages,"My wife will be applying online for permanent residence as an EEA national, and we are including me (non-EEA national) in her application, so we can use the European passport return service.  The application wants me to include my previous Family Permit (expired) and Residence Card (still valid) as supporting documents. For me, those documents are part of my passport.  Will the EPRS be able to copy and certify these pages as well? They are part of my passport, so I hope yes. But I'm concerned they will say they can only copy the bio data page, which forces me to submit my passport anyway, or leaves me unable to submit the originals of those supporting documents.  Unfortunately the council agent isn't able to answer questions in advance, and by the time I have the appointment I must already have declared in the application whether I can submit those documents.  Does anyone have any experience with getting the EPRS to copy 3 pages of a passport, instead of one? "
1088,How to renew scientist visa for a PhD extension?,"I have been on a scientist visa in France for about 2.5 years. I am supposed to finish my PhD in October, and my visa expires on the last day of September.  I have already received the green light to get an extra 3 months of funding (through January), and I suppose I should be extending my residence permit sometime in July. At that time, I will not have my defense set up (I still have to produce my manuscript). How do I extend my visa / TDS for a few months?  I asked at my lab, and I was told that it can take up to a year to renew a visa in my préfecture, during which time I won't be able to leave France. If it takes a year to renew a French residence permit, and I only need a 3 month extension, what is the best course of action here?  I need to be able to stay in France until potentially the beginning of February. After I submit and defend my thesis, I will be applying for a visa in an asian country for a postdoc. I cannot apply for that visa until I have my diploma in hand, and I cannot stay past my defense under my current visa situation. It would be rather silly to move back to my home country (non-EU and where I haven't lived in a decade) to do that. I would also like to avoid that for personal reasons.  If it makes any difference, I am pacsé with a French national and we're considering getting married before I have to leave. We live together. I'm not sure if that makes any difference with this whole thing. I didn't really intend to go the spouse visa route until after my 3 years outside Europe was finished (especially since we will be long distance for 3 years) but I'm willing to consider it if it makes the situation any easier.  To make matters worse, I submitted a change of address (requesting a new titre de sejour) only last week (at a different prefecture), and I have no idea how long that will take, or if it will invalidate the residence permit I already have.

I was told that my file was still at my old city and that they can't do anything until then. That was last month and I was told I should go again when the residency is closer to its expiry date.  The expiry date is in two days so I went again today (that has to be close enough) and was told the same thing: No file, nothing we can do about it. I asked if there is anything I could do and was told no. I asked if I can get a piece of paper stating my current status of being stuck in limbo and was told no.  How bad is the situation I'm now?

As I asked from the Estonian Embassy said that Finland Embassy can only issue Visa type-C with 90 days of staying which I understand that it's possible to get Visa Type-C to enter Estonia first and then apply for Temporary Residence Permit later within two months. But I'm not sure if it's possible to apply Visa type C with one way ticket flight by declaring my intention to apply Temporary Residence Permit when arrival in Estonia?  I booked only one way ticket because I have to study for two years.. but I'm afraid they will not issue Visa type C because I don't have return flight. To buy a return flight in the period of 90 days means that I will just need it to apply visa and won't use it, but if it's necessary I will have to buy it anyway. It's better than fly to the nearest Estonian Embassy and apply TRP there.(It's costly for me)  Please advice what should I do in this case? Try apply with one way flight with letter of acceptance from university or should I buy return ticket?  Emails from Tokyo's Estonian Embassy     Thank you for your email and choosing Estonia as your studying   destination.      The Finnish Embassy in Bangkok could only issue short-term C-visa.

Normally it would take at least 3 working days to process the visa   application, from submitting to picking up.      In order to expedite, you could send your documents by email in   advance        Regarding the C-visa, please consult directly  with FI Embassy      Alternatively you could apply for D-visa (long –term) in Tokyo.

1099,Requirement to have an address prior to applying for residency seems like a catch-22,"I see this requirement in the Germany Residency Permit instructions, however the general situation seems common among multiple European countries:     How to Apply for German Residence Permit?       The steps to applying for a German Residence Permit are as follows:      Register your German address       Whether you are applying from Germany within the first 90 days or  from your home country, the first thing you must do is register your new German address with the authorities. Germany has this requirement and you must fulfill it in order to be eligible for a residence permit.      If you don’t register your address, you could get fined and your permit might be denied. After you complete this requirement, you will get a certificate which you can attach to your documents.   How is one to get an address prior to having a residency permit?  Is one expected to enter into a lease which they then abandon if the residency is denied? "

1102,Entering the Schengen area for marriage purposes without meeting tourist visa requirements,"We are an international couple (I am from Italy, my partner is from Iran). Until now we always overcame Schengen visa requirements by meeting in Turkey, where we can both enter with just an ID card.   The Italian embassy in Teheran is plagued with corruption, it's basically impossible to even get an appointment for applying and this situation has not changed in 3 years.  I have a salary that could sustain both of us, a place to stay and we would like to be together for finally getting married here. Since Italy does not provide a marriage visa, the official guideline is to apply for a tourist visa. A proof of employment, property and an appropriate bank account budget are required in order to process and pass the visa request.  My partner is currently unemployed, and has no properties. Given the fact that these fair requests are made to avoid illegal immigration and overstaying under a tourist visa, but our purpose is to create a family and live together, is there a way to bypass these requirements that make no sense for us and also prevent us to accomplish one of the basic human rights like having a family?  I want to make clear that the Italian consulate in Teheran does not provide civil office services, so getting married in Iran is not possible, and the Iranian marriage has no value in Italy. Turkey provides a civil marriage under the Monaco Treaty but only for residents and Iranian authorities in Turkey do not allow a foreigner to marry outside the country, stating that they are not authorized to release the appropriate documentation.  What is going to happen if we just show up at the border without a visa but with the intention of marriage that will be confirmed by the marriage itself afterwards?  This is my only idea left.  Thanks for your replies. This is not meant to be a desperate or sentimental appeal, I just hope this community can help me like it always happened before. "

1106,Buy a new Volvo in Canada and import into US,"I just moved to Canada from the U.S.  I have Permanent Residency in Canada.  I would like buy a new Volvo in Canada and return with it when I snowbird in the U.S.  My research so far is that I will owe 2.5% duty on the car as I cross the border.  What I don't know is: will I need to modify the car in anyway to be compliant with U.S. laws.  Volvos do not allow FULL switching between Kilometers and Miles.  Specifically a Canada Volvo will display kph on the speed dial and a U.S. Volvo will display mph.  It counter intuitive that they just don't make this easy to change on a configuration screen on the car, but the salesman said Volvo intentionally does it to ""protect markets"".  I confirmed this both at a U.S. dealer and a Canadian dealer.  The good news is: the speedometer will switch the smaller digital speed display (so maybe that will pass inspection?).  What is the experience of others importing a newish Volvo from Canada to U.S.?  When I imported my car from U.S. to Canada, Canada had a list of cars and what would need to be modified and what cars just plain could not be modified (Spoiler: U.S. Teslas cannot be imported into Canada.)  So when I brought my car in I had some idea of what needed to be done to pass inspection.  Is there a list of cars that can be imported into U.S. with little or no modification? "

I am the UK Ancestry Visa applicant and am applying with my wife as a dependent at the same time.   I am confident I meet the requirements for the UK Ancestry Visa and that my wife can come with me, I'm just not sure which application type to choose.  For myself I have chosen:   Reason for visit: Work Visa type: Non Point based working visa   Visa sub-type: UK Ancestry   Would my wife be the same?   Or would she be:    Reason for Visit: Work Visa type: Non Points-Based Visas Visa subtype: Dependants 6 months or more    This last approach seem more right to me (and it is the answer found on this question Which visa type and subtype should I use when applying for a UK Ancestry dependent visa?) However, if you take this route, in the application it asks for the 'UK Sponsor'. My wife won't have a 'sponsor' in the sense of an employer as this is not a requirement for ancestry visa dependents. So I wonder if this is not the right approach.  I can't find any information online that addresses this question.   I have asked via the official channels by paying to email them. However the answers haven't been clear so I'm still a bit uncertain.   Does anyone know? "

I used turbotax this year but had difficulties as support for foreign income reporting was limited. I would prefer a free or cheap method of filing and I would prefer to avoid using an accountant or other paid method. "
1117,EEA permit application,"I live in Italy. I applied to visit the UK on an EEA family permit and was granted  6 months. I went to the UK twice and am back now in Italy, My permit is now expired.   Can I apply for another 6 months from Italy or do I have a time limit before I can apply for another 6 months? Like do I have to wait a year to apply for another 6 months?  Also, with a six month permit I know I would have to go with my wife who is Italian. While we are there, if she decide to stay in the UK for longer and I return to Italy by myself, would I be able to go back to the UK alone while the permit is valid (within the 6 months limit)? My wife would be in the UK already searching for a job. "
1118,UK tier 2 visa - Unfair treatment of applications,I was recently refused a UK tier 2 (General) category visa because I had forgot to send a english language proof certificate with my application.  I completely understand the reasons for refusal. However I also read the following excerpt from the Tier 2 Policy Guidance document.    Internet is littered with cases where the entry clearance officer has requested for the missing documents ex: Missing UK NARIC letter.  I have held UK visas before if anybody was supposed to be requested for documents it would be me.  I just want to know why some cases are treated differently than others. If the ECO has to follow the rules specified in the doucment above then why some applications and applicants are treated differently than others?  Should I apply for an administrative review quoting this?  Screenshot of the refusal letter

1121,Does permanent residence for AUS/NZ require 'renewals'?,I read the AUS/NZ permanent residence is infinite. Other countries require perm to be renewed after 5 years or so.   1) Is it same for AUS/NZ?  2) Is it same for minors too ? 
1122,Applying as a resident to another EU country with a still-valid EU resident permit? (Third party national),"I just finished my MA in Germany and have 6 months left on my jobseeker resident permit. I am a non-EU national from Southeast Asia.  Recently, I got a call from my old boss in Austria who wants to take me in as a business partner. I was then wondering if I can apply for a resident’s permit/self-employed visa in Austria while still being a German resident? Or does this mean that I have to go back to my home country and de-register from Germany completely to be able to do such an application?  The thing is I still have 6 months left as a German resident and of course there are risks of  getting denied the permit for my application to move to Austria - as such I still want to keep my options open as a jobseeker in Germany. Or to be able to apply for another EU country, I must de-register completely from my current residence?  Anyone been in a similar situation? "
1123,"I'm applying for Schengen Visa, while working remotely. Is it Legal?","I work remotely from India for a UK based company and have been staying in India. I am planning to go as soon as possible now because I want to keep travelling (only this time outside India) while working remotely to support my expenses each month.  I haven't travelled outside my home country before. I'm applying for a tourist visa (Schengen) so that I can visit my friend in Germany. My question is, is it OK for me to say that I am working remotely for a company, while I live in India, pay my taxes in India (it has only been 2 months since I'm working for the company, so I can't produce adequate data from my bank account statement for at least past 3-6 months, before this I was just doing gigs here and there(non-taxable)). I want to find a tourist visa for germany.  So what are the complications here and how can I resolve this? If not, what's the best way to deal with this? Thanks. "
1124,UK Short Term Study Visa,"While applying for UK short term study visa for a period of three months, I came across this question: ""Total Monthly Income from savings, properties or other income, for example from stocks and shares"".   In my bank account, I receive a monthly salary S from my employer. In addition to this I have an X sum of money in my bank account which I received from various sources including family members at various times. This X sum of money is there for more than previous six months and is available for me to spend on my studies. However, it is not a MONTHLY income. How do I represent this money as answer to the visa form question stated above? Do I show the total X amount of money as monthly income which it is not? Or do I divide the X by, say, 3 (three month visa) and write the amount from X/3 as answer to MONTHLY income from other sources?   I am confused and any help would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks in advance. "
1125,Will it ruin my chances to be PR in Canada if I marry my foreign boyfriend?,"I am an international student and graduating next year June and I was wondering if marrying my boyfriend (who will be on a tourist visa) in Canada after my graduation will affect my chance to be Permanent Resident in Canada? From what I know, after living in Canada for 3 years straight, I am eligible to apply for a PR. Would marrying my non-canadian boyfriend in any way affect my chances of attaining PR? "
1126,Permanent Resident of the United States living abroad,"Ok.  Here is the semi hypothetical situation:  US Permanent Resident married to a US citizen who works on a contract basis for the US military abroad.  According to the USCIS:  The permanent residency may be considered abandoned if:     Abandoning Permanent Resident Status      You may also lose your permanent resident status by intentionally abandoning it. You may be found to have abandoned your status if you:         Move to another country, intending to live there permanently.   Remain outside of the United States for an extended period of time, unless you intended this to be a temporary absence, as shown by:         The reason for your trip;   How long you intended to be absent from the United States;   Any other circumstances of your absence; and   Any events that may have prolonged your absence.   Note: Obtaining a re-entry permit from USCIS before you leave, or a returning resident visa (SB-1) from a U.S. consulate while abroad, may assist you in showing that you intended only a temporary absence.      Fail to file income tax returns while living outside of the United States for any period.   Declare yourself a “nonimmigrant” on your U.S. tax returns.      Now the situation is that the contract is a temporary thing usually a year but contracts may be extended or a new contract in a different country may be signed and this could go on for a long period of time.    So how can the spouse keep his/her permanent resident status in the face of this situation?  I can't seem to find any actual procedures on how one can obtain an SB-1? and What documentation needs to be shown to do it?  P.S. Just so we're clear the contracts may not be on a US military base but on an ally base that US military is using on a long term basis. "
1127,Can I work remotely in Canada on a student permit?,"I'm planning to study at an accredited university in Canada for 3 years. Can I do remote work for US companies with just a student permit, or will I have to get a work visa?   EDIT: Does working as a contractor make any difference? I would be doing remote programming work through my own US company. "
1128,Hostility in Germany,"I am an open-minded Indian student and I will be going to Germany to join the University of Bonn for my masters in Computer Science. I have a few queries that are plaguing me right now. Here they are:   Are Indians met with hostility? I mean for the fact that we are studying from the money of German taxpayers (which I personally respect and acknowledge), so will we be considered inferior/neglected etc.? I have read that people @ Bonn are direct and call a spade a spade, but how diverse will be its effect? Will I be able to survive it with my initial little to no German language knowledge? What should I do to fit in Germany perfectly?  "
1129,Going back to school with H1B,"I went to school in the U.S. in 2009 for my PhD and graduated in 2014. Got my H1B just this year, but I want to go back to school for another masters (I want more electrical engineering training). I have several questions:   Is this possible to do? (H1B to F1 or something) Can I do internships in the U.S. if I go back to school in the U.S.? Can I work in the U.S. again after I graduate?   If I want to work in the U.S. after getting this masters, what are possible ways to do this (besides getting married to an American)?  I am from China. "
1130,Extending California Driver's Licence during 60 days grace period?,"My STEM OPT is expiring in June 30,2015 and hence my driver's license. I called the DMV legal presence department and they said they can't extend my DL for that period. I have applied for another university and waiting for acceptance which may take some time (probably in July or August) and hence I am stuck without License during that time period. The DMV people told me that their hands are tied by DHS(Department of Homeland Security) people and hence they can't extend.   My friend who is in similar situation has got his DL covered for those 60 days period. This is weird. They didn't do it for me. Looks like it depends upon location of DMV from where one is getting DL.  Is it possible for me to drive using my Indian Driving License till the time I get new I-20 and renew my California DL ? OR any other alternative like obtaining permission from DHS and showing that as a proof to DMV so that they can extend that? "
1131,Work permit for Argentina,"I'm living in the UK and plan to move to Buenos Aires, Argentina. I'm self-employed/freelancer working for remote clients.

And can I simply go there as a tourist and then do the paperwork to otain a work visa on the spot? "
1132,J-2 visa: who is funding for your trip?,"We are applying for J visas, J-1 for me and J-2 for my wife. I don't know how to answer this question in my wife application form: ""who is funding for your trip?"".  In my application form, my employer is the one who is funding for my trip. But for my wife, is it me or my employer?      UPDATE:  I would like to hear from people having experience filling these forms. My only aim is to fill them correctly.  @DCTLib explained my situation perfectly. J-2 is a dependent visa of J-1, and the sponsor is the same as J-1. This means on the paperwork, my employer is also the sponsor for my wife. That's why I don't know if I should put them as ""funding for my wife's trip"". Obviously no employer will pay for the wives of employees.  I'm applying VISA for a post doc position, if this matters. "
1133,Non-EU spouse of EU citizen wanting to travel in EU longer than 90 days,"I am a UK citizen and resident. Does my non-EU (USA) spouse need to apply for a special visa to travel in the EU for longer than 90 days in one block? We want to travel (cycle-touring) in the Schengen area for up to 180 days without working. Obviously she would normally get the 90 days as a US citizen, but do we need to register or apply for a visa to be able to stay beyond that period? "
1134,H4 work from home (remotely),"Is it legally allowed to work from home using dependent visa. I am shifting to USA in a couple of months and my wife is also working in India.

1135,Can a non H1B holder be exempted from H1B cap?,"I am an Indian citizen working in a university in Singapore. If I apply for a similar role in a university in US, am I exempted from H1B cap? I have never applied to H1B. Are there people who have been exempted from H1B cap to work in universities?  Most employers ask the following question ""Are you presently legally authorized to work in the US?"" If I choose ""No"", does it mean that the employer won't take a look at my application?  "
1136,What process must I go through to get Australian/NZ contractors into USA?,I have a company that has signed a contract with a US company to do some consultancy work for them.  My team is from Australia and New Zealand.  What process needs to be undertaken to allow them to work there as contractors in my company for the US customer?  Does my company need to be registered in the US to undertake work for a US company? 
1137,"Will my US immigration time duration effects, if my parents come back to pakistan","My parents have been living in US since 2 years  and they are green card holder, but not have citizenship now. I have applied for US immigration on base of my father who is currently doing job there and Its been a 5 months ago that I applied and my process submission has been successfully approved. Now my parents want to come back to Pakistan and stay here for 1 years so I want to know following.  Does my process time (which takes around 5 to 6 years as I read on us immigration site for unmarried person and more than 21 years ) will effect if they stay Pakistan for 1 year or more than this? Does this time will deduct for whole process time duration? Does Citizenship time which my parents get from US will effect if they stay Pakistan for 1 year or more than this? "
1138,Does Using a Representative for a T2 Application Hurt an Applicant's Credibility?,"I have seen that the following guidance has been issued to UK Visas and Immigration caseworkers:     You need not take these actions for all applicants, but should do so   when there is particular cause for concern, for example:         a representative has been used and the application is from a high    risk sector   the applicant is switching from a route that has been identified as    high risk      Extract from Tier 2 Guidance  This guidance seems to indicate that applicants from a 'high risk sector' may experience adversity if the caseworker notices that a representative has been instructed to assist with the application.  I used to do this sort of thing and know that immigration advice in the UK is a regulated activity (Section 84 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999) placing standards of conduct and a rigorous certification process.  I have also seen the following in the Bar Standards Handbook...     The Bar Standards Board requires barristers to act with honesty and   integrity, to never knowingly or recklessly mislead or attempt to   mislead anyone and to never do anything which could reasonably be seen   by the public to undermine their honesty, integrity or independence.    The Solicitors’ Regulation Authority imposes obligations on solicitors   to uphold the rule of law and the proper administration of justice.    Solicitors must always act with personal integrity and must never   attempt to deceive, or knowingly or recklessly mislead, or be   complicit in another person deceiving or misleading the court.    Similar provisions exist within the other designated professional   bodies’ codes of conduct and ethics   And on the other hand, many answers to questions in the Stack Exchange domain  from T2 applicants and other categories of applicants include the suggestion to get legal advice.  Is SE pointing them in a bad direction? Albeit unknowingly and perhaps well-intended?  How can a T2 applicant get competent help if using a representative if UK government caseworkers see it as a 'particular cause for concern'?    Note: A T2 application in common parlance is a 'work permit'.  A full description is given here. "
1139,What is maximum time period for Green card holder to live outside of USA,"I am from Pakistan and my age is around 25years old, my parents have been living in USA from last two years and they have green card but not citizenship. I applied for Immigration (as unmarried son) on behalf of my father. Now my parents want to come back Pakistan for at least 1 years, so I am bit concern about the time effect on my process and my parents citizenship process duration. My queries are following on behalf of this.   What exactly the maximum time duration to stay outside of US without permission(for green card holder)? I mean they can come to Pakistan for 5 months without any permission and this 5 months will not effects of duration of my process and their Citizenship? as this thread's answer suggest me that your parents have to get permission first to leave US for so long time but I am not sure how much time. How and where to get Permission for leaving US for at least 1 year?   Need some authenticated answer on this because my parents want to move back Pakistan for at least one 1 year.

1140,Can a car be registered in two EU countries at the same time?,"I have recently relocated to a different EU country, and as a resident I will have to register my overseas car here. After that, will I have to notify my home country that the car has been registered here or is it done automatically?  Further on, if I fail to notify my home country, will both registrations be valid at the same time?   Not that I plan on doing it, but it has occurred to me that this could be a loophole if insurance is far cheaper in one of the countries involved.   I know that in the case of UK/Ireland there might be further implications as you need to modify the car to make it road legal of you bring it from the continent and viceversa.  "
1141,Short-term internship in UK: Where to be health-insured?,"I'm a European (German) citizen who wants to do a short-term (10 weeks) internship in the UK.  The main question remains where I need to be health-insured and where I need to pay for it.   UK: It would be taken from my pay directly and I would be covered under the NHS.  Reasons speaking against that from what I've found: I'm only there for 10 weeks and it is only for residents Germany: I would have to pay it on my own and I would be covered with the EHIC.   If the first one applies, would I need to get de-registered in Germany first and register again when I return?  If the second one applies, is it correct that I wouldn't be able to stay insured through my parents? I'm currently covered though family insurance, but I get paid about 6000 EUR for the whole internship and I would probably have to get insurance myself (which costs about 15%, ouch. NHS seems cheaper). "
1142,"I have a ""D-type"" German student visa. Is it possible to study in Finland and get the residence permit for Finland?","Being an international (Pakistani) Postgraduate student, I have just received my German study visa “Type D” (for 90days). I will be coming to Germany in start of August.  Then I applied for another master's degree program which is an exchange student program where I have to study for the first 2 semesters in Helsinki (Finland) and the last two in Berlin (although the degree will be awarded by the German University).  Is it possible that after comming to Germany rather than getting enrolled in the university for which I was granted visa I move to that exchange program where I have to study in Finland for first 2 semesters?  Can I apply for student residence permit by travelling to Finland from Germany immediately after landing in Germany as I have a valid Schengen visa to enter Finland?  Is it possible that after entering into the Finland I can apply and obtain a one year residence permit for my exchange program? "
1143,How to fill in the Canada Express Entry Profile when I am married but separated and my spouse is not coming with me?,"I am completing my Express Entry profile. Under the ""Creating your Profile"" page, I have answered ""Married"" for Marital Status. Following this is the question: ""Is your spouse/common-law partner included in this application?"" I would like to answer ""No"" for the sole reason that we are already separated.  Regardless of the points, education, language etc, my husband and I are already separated. It is, however, a very unfortunate case that as having married in the Philippines, we can't file a divorce. Divorce is not legal in the Philippines. However, my ex-husband and I have decided to simply part ways.  In my case, it will be fraudulent to say ""YES"", because my husband is NEITHER included in my application, NOR would he want to be included in this application. But as I have read several feedbacks saying that the applicant should include the spouse, now I am utterly confused. I am not lying regarding my marital status. I am married by law. I am not lying about my application either.  He is not coming with me to Canada, or anywhere else for that matter. Why ask a question that states ""Is your spouse included..."" if the only answer for couples is ""YES""? "
1144,How do I apply for a permission to stay for a child born in the UK?,"I live in the UK on a Tier 2 visa, and my son was born in the UK. According to [website]  If you have children while you’re in the UK, you can apply for permission for them to stay.      You must do this if you want to travel in and out of the UK with your child.      When you apply you must send a full UK birth certificate showing the names of both of your child’s parents.   Is this permission to stay the same as a Tier 2 visa? Also, where do I apply for this permission and where do I send the birth certificate to?  "
1145,How to take my belongings when moving to a new country?,"I'll move from Brazil to Sweden, and therefore will take a LOT of luggage (desktop computer, clothes, notebook, etc.), that probably wouldn't fit in a single bag.   What's the best way to take my belongings with me, taking into account security and money?    I heard its possible to put my desktop computer in a different bag and send it to Sweden. Is this a feasible solution? "
1146,UK dependent visa refusal can I apply for review in this situation?,"My wife's and child's visa for UK tier-2 dependent was refused.    The reason for the refusal of my wife's visa: in the bank statement and in the passport only one letter was different, e.g. wifename myname, wifename myXname. X is the letter which was inserted in my bank statement. So the visa officer thinks they are belonging to different persons. My child's visa was refused because my wife doesn't have a valid visa.   In this case can I apply for administrative review, or should I go for new application? How can I claim that the names are belonging to the same person?  Thanks in advance. "

1152,Getting fresh carp for Christmas in the UK,"Common Carp is a common Christmas dish around Central Europe, but not around the rest of the world, including the UK. It is commonly bought alive, and only killed before actually preparing the dish (or in case of legal restrictions they are killed just before buying them in the shop)   Last Christmas I hoped I'll be able to find it somewhere, as there are a lot of Polish shops, and also because I read an article that in 2006 Sainsbury's did try to include it into their Christmas selections. Compared to this I only found an already dead iced one, after a lengthy search in major areas of London, and not because it was sold out, but because it was never on the menu.  Questions:   Is it really illegal (as stated in the article) to fish fresh carp for eating purposes? Are there any licences that would allow it, and if yes places where you can fish them? If not, are there places where you can defintiely get fresh carp around Christmas? Needing to pre-order it fine, but they should be fresh.  "
1153,What are the requirements for an expat to rent a place in Sweden?,"When moving to Sweden, what are the (common) requirements imposed by landlords on renting an apartment? Are any deposits required? Paperwork?  I'm also wondering if the requirements are different for an expat from the US, for instance, and an immigrant who is a citizen of a country that belongs to the EU "
1154,Under what circumstances must a US citizen forfeit their citizenship when obtaining a new one?,"For some reason I have been under the impression that US law prohibits US citizens from retaining their citizenship if they ever obtain a new citizenship.  Is this always, sometimes, or never true?  If sometimes, when?  Or perhaps I have the situation reversed in my head, and US law requires new citizens to renounce their previous citizenship when acquiring US citizenship? "
1155,How long does the USCIS wait until running a lottery for H1-B visa?,"When the number of applications exceeds the annual cap for H1-B visas, the USCIS runs a lottery to decide who gets it and who doesn't. But how long do they usually wait until they decide to run the lottery? Let's suppose that in the first week, the cap is not reached. Do they grant the visas to this first batch (considering all other criteria are met, of course) or do they wait a bit more? What if it's not reached in the second week and so on? "
1156,End USA Citizenship inside USA During War,"Nationality Act includes a section and bunch of clauses on how citizenship can be lost. From here.     (6) making in the United States a formal written renunciation of nationality in such form as may be prescribed by, and before such officer as may be designated by, the Attorney General, whenever the United States shall be in a state of war and the Attorney General shall approve such renunciation as not contrary to the interests of national defense;    Is this clause in effect? Who are the officers? Would the person doing this be deported?  Edit; Wikipedia I don't know how I missed this page. Is all of the information true? My last question is still not answered.  "
1157,"If asked for ID in France by the police, as an EU national what is considered valid?","On the rare occasion when I've seen people in France challenged by the police about their identity, they've always seemed to show their Carte nationale d’identité sécurisée (CNIS).  However, since I'm not a French national, I don't have one of those, and nor (I think?) would I be entitled to get one. I'm also from an EU country which doesn't have ID cards, so I don't have a national ID card either.  What are the rules in France on proving your identity if challenged by the police, specifically for non French nationals? (I'd rather not carry my passport with me at all times if possible!) "
1158,When is the starting date of a Recognised Graduate visa in Australia?,"I am going to lodge a temporary visa named Recognised Graduate visa.

1159,How to get legal advice regarding traffic offenses in Austria when I don't speak the language?,When you expatriate in a foreign country to be able to defend your right is really important. The existence itself of the tribunal means you should not always simply pay fines. How do you achieve this objective in a country in which you don't speak the language?  The main problem I'm experiencing living in Austria is the strong difficulty I meet when I try to do a Google for something I need.   How should I search for finding car-fines specialized lawyer company support in a German speaking country?   Do you also know if consumer group are also offering cheap / free support? And what about legal insurance? 
1160,Can I apply for a French long-stay visa in France?,"I am an American student who will be studying abroad in Paris. I am studying in France for 1 month this summer (July 3 to August 13) and then returning August 24 to stay for the year. I obviously will not need a visa for my 1-month stay, which is good, because Campus France is still processing my application. Unfortunately, my Campus France application won't be processed until mid July, at which point I will be in France. Since visas take 2-3 weeks to process, I won't have enough time to get my visa back in the States.  All that being explained, will it be possible to make a visa appointment in Paris? If not, does anyone have any suggestions for what to do? "
1161,Finnish virkatodistus when living in Denmark,"For matters of inheritance and Finnish bureaucracy I need a virkatodistus/elää-todistus, which proves that I am alive and thus can inherit.  I live in Denmark. The document provided by the Finnish maistraatti only covers the time when I lived in Finland. How can I get the relevant document?  I can think of three possible ways, one of which is expensive and slow.   Ask the Finnish Ministry of foreign affairs to procure the documentation. This costs at least 100 €. Reference. Maybe the Finnish embassy could prove that I am alive if I appear there with a passport? I cannot find information concerning this. Maybe the Danish authorities can create a relevant document. Since the Nordic countries are very good at accepting the documentation of each other, there is hope for this to be true.  "
1162,Getting H1B on October 1st. Can I switch jobs right away and move to academia?,"I am working for Employer A and will be in H1B status starting October 1st. Currently I am on OPT.   I would like to switch back to academia and have a postdoctoral offer from a university in my current city. How long after October 1st could I leave my current job and start the postdoc (i.e. switch H1B employers)? Is there anything preventing me from doing that on October 2nd? Is it possible to do this even before October 1st?  Addition I: As my H1B application has been ""accepted"", i.e. selected in the lottery, is it even possible for my new employer to file an H1B petition that is guaranteed to be selected? Or does it complicate things that my new employer will be a university instead of a private company?  Addition II: Is there anything preventing a cap-H1B visa to be ""valid"" in academia? My salary will meet the minimum requirement.  "
1163,Leaving the US on H1B. Will I be cap-exempt in the future?,"I am in the US and will be in H1B status starting October 1st. If I take a job in the UK with a different employer in January, do I forfeit my H1B status? If I want to move back to the US in two or three years, will I be cap exempt? That is, will a potential employer be able to provide me with an H1B without going through the lottery?  "
1164,Teaching in India,"I am a physicist and I am planning to take a break and move to India for a year or so. I would love to teach while there, but I don't know anything about the Indian system... are teachers hired directly by each school, or is there a central system? And what about teaching at the university level? Any tip will be very useful.   In case it might be helpful: for my PhD I developed a new microscopy technique for materials science. I did some postdoc work afterwards. I also spent a few months teaching math and physics at an Italian high school. I have extensive experience working with X-rays and neutrons. "
1165,What is my country of permanent residence for UK visa purposes?,"I am filling out a UK student visa application, and it asks for my ""country of permanent residence,"" but it does not provide a definition for this term.   I currently reside outside of my country of citizenship on a ""temporary residence permit"", which will expire before I leave the UK. However, I am eligible to extend this permit to a date later than when I will be departing the UK. Furthermore, I am eligible to apply for citizenship by registration in my current country of residence, although I have not yet done so. I have no home address in my country of citizenship.  Can I declare my current country of residence as my ""country of permanent residence"" and apply from here, or will I have problems (given that my visa expires before my date of departure from the UK)? I can explain on the application that the visa can be renewed beyond the date that I will be departing the UK, that I am eligible for citizenship here, etc...  A similar question was asked: What is my &#39;permanent residence address&#39; when I have no &#39;permanent&#39; residency anywhere in the world and no place in my home country? but refers to general legal documents and banking, rather than UK-specific visa definitions &amp; regulations.

1166,Sworn translation of latest obtained diploma,"I need a sworn French translation of my latest diploma, but from my understanding that translation companies in the US are not ""sworn"" translations. How should I go about getting my diploma translated? Are there any French companies that provide this service to US customers? Are there any American companies that provide services which a French University would accept?  From the NY French Consulate:     There are no sworn translators in the United States. The profession of translator is not regulated and its practice does not require any validation of professional credentials.   [website]From the NY French Consulate, perhaps I could use ATA certified translators? Would this be acceptable?  Email I received from The University of Toulouse:      An important clarification concerning the French translation of your documents. A sworn French translation​ is required for your latest diploma only​ (the equivalent of a Bachelor in IT or superior), all other documents can be presented in English.   Campus France Application:     The original copies of your secondary school diploma, your higher education studies diploma and a certificate proving that you have successfully completed your 3th year of higher education studies. If the original documents are not in French, they must be accompanied by a sworn translation from a French consular agent of cultural services of French Embassy or a French consulate.  "
1167,Requirements for German work visa,"I had an interview in Germany 3 months ago and visited on a Schengen visa. To apply for a Schengen visa, I just needed the interview invitation letter with basic other documents, such as the application form, my passport etc. Nothing was complicated in that. Now I got the job offer and received the detailed contract from the company.  I thought that applying for a work permit/visa would be as easy as before, but it looks a little bit confusing. First of all, what visa do I need to apply for? I couldn't find the application form for this type on any website. If I would need to apply for a residence permit, then where should I apply (German embassy in Oman?) and what form do I need to fill? Do I need a verification of my PhD degree? I am currently working in Oman with a Pakistani passport.  Thanks. "
1168,Tier-2 ICT refused under 320(7A),"I am currently on Tier-2 ICT in tje UK. My wife applied fo4 a Tier -2 ICT. It was refused mentioning the reason below:     On your application form you have stated that you have not received a caution, reprimand, warning or similar penalties in the UK or any other country. Home office records show however that you were cautioned twice by XX Constabulary on 1 April 2015. I am satisfied that you have used deception. I therefore refuse your application in accordance with paragraph 320 (7A) of the immigration rules.       You should note that because this application for entry clearance has been refused under paragraph 320(7A) of the immigration rules, any future application may also be refused under paragraph 320(7B) of the immigration rules.       Refusal under paragraph 320(7B) of the immigration rules attracts an automatic refusal period of up to 10 years. The period starts from the date of the previous event in which the deception or the submission of falsified documents or information was employed.   She was in the UK in 2015 on a previous Tier-2 ICT. She was in a shop and came out without paying the bill when she got an urgent call. So she was cautioned by police only once. As it was a minor thing (which she thought and doesn't even remember), she didn't mention that in the new application that was refused now.  What are the possible options to get the visa now? Can an administrative review help here? Can she apply for a new dependent visa mentioning all these in the new application? "
1169,How long before I get my new Canada TRV (temporary resident visa)?,"CIC has received my TRV application on June 20. My flight is scheduled on July 29, from Toronto to Beijing. I am a recent student at the University of Waterloo, and I have just extended my study permit. I use the new study permit to apply for the TRV. However, my old TRV has already expired before the new application.  I have heard that some people say it usually takes 2-4 weeks to get a new TRV. Now, I have been waiting for a week. Does this 2-4 weeks time include the mailing time?   Do you think I should cancel my flight now? Or, it is safe for the current time? "
1170,"For US immigrant visa, does the chest X-Ray actually expire even once you have the visa?","My wife's green card application is on hold, waiting on my I-864 (US taxes.. bah! Don't open a Limited in the UK if you're a US citizen unless you're ok with paying $1200 to have your personal US taxes done).  We have done the interview portion at the London embassy already. They handed back the x-ray in an envelope. That envelope had a handwritten 'exp. {date}` on it.   We're concerned that we will have to enter the US before that date.   Thus: Does the x-ray expire once the embassy has reviewed and approved the immigrant visa. If so, what happens? Do we ""just"" need to get another medical? Or does the whole process start over - medical, interview, resubmit forms, new legal clearance etc.  Answers from personal experience would be great - actual references to legal code would be absolutely fantastic.

1172,Starting point to find a job and place to live in Sweden while being abroad?,"A good friend of mine, who lives in Switzerland, wants to leave her country and move to Sweden. The reasons for this are neither being job related, nor rooted in having a community or friends there that she wants to live with. Instead, her wish to live in that country stems from a deep love for the country, its culture and predominantly for the local scene.  This situation leaves her with having neither a guarantee of a job, nor a place to live when she will arrive, both being a necessity when starting to live in a country. To help her, I have some related questions about the topic, that I hope to find answers to here:   Are there any guidelines to finding a job abroad in Sweden? Looking for work is rather difficult when you're not around, so I thought maybe there are general steps one should follow. Are there communities that help you migrating to Sweden? I can't imagine that she's the first person who wants to live there, without communities, employer or partners being the reason for the migration. In general - Is searching a job and moving to the location of employment the best option one has? Or is moving to a place with a good infrastructure a better option?   To give additional information that might be of help answering the question: my friend already lived in Sweden for 2 years, and speaks the language to a B2 level. She has a Bachelor's degree in Agronomy, but hasn't worked in the field for 4 years now. She is a Swiss citizen, and doesn't have a Swedish identity number.  "
1173,Where can I report US immigration fraud?,"A colleague of mine has confessed to me that he applied for asylum in the US with a fake story about persecution in his home country. His application is in the last stages of processing and I'm afraid that he would be granted asylum despite not deserving it in the slightest.   How can I report this fact to the authorities? ICE has a tip off line about illegal aliens, but my colleague currently has legal status so he's not technically illegal. Is there a specific tip off line for asylum fraud? "
1174,Living in Sweden & Denmark- building citizenship,"I'm currently an EU citizen...however that EU citizenship is British thus is greatly under threat. Further I'm an ethnic minority so...let's just say I don't feel safe with the direction the UK is heading. Not to mention the economic downturn.  Luckily I might have a job opportunity in Copenhagen to offer me an escape. The problem with this I see is that Denmark requires 9 years of residence for citizenship. Which is a hell of a long time.  Once upon a time I lived in Sweden. I was there for 2 years. I know that Swedish citizenship requires 5 years of residence. Though I think my previous 2 years do not count this is still a more manageable length of time. I am confident I can get my Swedish up to a fluent level with a year or two study too so that's a worry gone there.  So I'm thinking....maybe if I get this Copenhagen job I can live in Malmo and commute daily? Many do this...  The trouble is...I hate commuting.  So as a possible alternative I'm thinking to keep two residences. Buy myself a proper home on the Swedish side and rent a room to crash in on the Danish side. The job seems to offer flexiable working and is in the kind of industry where I expect I'll be working like a dog some days and then have some lengthy downtime.  I wonder, how can this dual residence thing work for the purpose of residence?  I am determined above all to do this right and above board- being 100% legally living in Sweden but off the books renting a room and hope nobody notices I'm not home as regularly as a normal person would be isn't something I want to risk.  Could I build years of residence in both? Officially living in two places or must I pick one as my primary?- I assume the latter  How many nights of the year must I ensure I am in my official place in order to make it count? "
1175,Can I stay in Europe after I complete my studies as long as my visa is still valid?,"I (U.S. citizen) studied abroad in France from August 2017 to May 2018, but the visa issued to me -- Type D, multi-entry -- is for the entire year (e.g. August to August).  My understanding, then, is that I can legally stay, even if my study program is over since my visa/residence permit doesn't expire until August 2018.  Is that correct?  Additionally, I have a question re: the 90/180 day rule.  I know that I can travel to other Schengen zone countries for up to 90 days within a 180 day period by using my visa. However, I would like to know if these days count toward the 90/180 day tourist visa rule, or are these 90 days separate?   For example, let's say I travel to Austria while I have my French student visa for 90 days. Then, my French student visa ends, and I leave the Schengen zone. Will I have another 90 days that I can use to stay in the Schengen zone, or would my stay in Austria count towards this time, barring me for 180 days? Also, how does this work practically since there is virtually no border control between Schengen countries? How would they be able to count the days of my stay in other Schengen countries while I'm on my visa? "

1177,Address for an EEA family permit,I am a Polish citizen. My husband is Egyptian. We live together in Egypt. I have never been to the UK.   We are refilling application on the visa4uk website and one of the questions made us a bit confused.     Is the UK address given the permanent address of the EEA National?   We chose option 'no'  because I don't have a permanent address in the UK. I had to put another address.   What address we should put here?   The address where we are currently living in Egypt (Address mentioned in our marriage certificate). The address from Poland as I am still registered there as a permanent resident (although I left 9 months ago).

What do I need to do here in US before going? Or what does he need to do in Italy before I can come over?

1186,Does calling USCIS on an OPT application before 75 days slow down processing time?,"On this site from 2016, it reports,     After applying for OPT, how long should I wait before trying to contact USCIS.

OPT APPLICATION (I-765) PENDING LESS THAN 75 DAYS      It is within the normal processing period. No need to do anything.   Is this still valid advice?

1187,Japan 2-year income tax exemption for teachers/researchers for US national but non-resident,"The tax treaty between Japan and US states that US nationals in research and teaching professions are exempt from paying income tax for their first two years working in Japan (and vice-versa). Article 20 states:     ARTICLE 20         An individual who visits a Contracting State temporarily for the purpose of teaching or conducting research at a university, college,   school or other educational institution in that Contracting State, and   who continues to be a resident, within the meaning of paragraph 1 of   Article 4, of the other Contracting State, shall be exempt from tax in   the first-mentioned Contracting State on any remuneration for such   teaching or research for a period not exceeding two years from the   date of his arrival.   The provisions of paragraph 1 shall not apply to income from research if such research is undertaken primarily for the private   benefit of one or more specific persons.      What constitutes a resident is outlined in article 4, paragraph 2:     Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1, an individual who is a   United States citizen or an alien lawfully admitted for permanent   residence in the United States under the laws of the United States   shall be regarded as a resident of the United States only if the   individual: (a) is not a resident of Japan under paragraph 1;       (b) has a substantial presence, permanent home or habitual abode in   the United States; and       (c) for the purposes of a convention or agreement for the avoidance of   double taxation between Japan and a state other than the United States, is   not a resident of that state.   I'm not clear about how to interpret this for my situation. I:   am moving to Japan to work as a researcher have been living outside of the US since about 9 years, currently living in France and paying income tax in France (but filing US taxes every year) have not been resident in the US for any period during that time planning to move from France directly to Japan have been taking FEIE in all of my US tax returns have no 'permanent home' in the US, although I'm registered to vote via the house I grew up in. have no plans to return to the US.   To benefit from the income exemption I have to be considered a US resident. I'm not sure whether being a US national implies that I am (because I could be) a US resident or not. The definition of 'resident' in Japan seems to hinge upon whether or not I pay taxes to Japan. But whether or not I pay taxes in Japan seems to hinge upon whether or not I am a resident in the US. So the whole thing feels pretty recursive.  Questions: 1) Am I considered a US resident under these circumstances? I'm guessing not. 2) If I am (and the exemption is therefore possible) are there any nonfinancial benefits or drawbacks for being considered a US resident under these circumstances? And would I then be paying US income taxes instead of Japanese ones?  For what it is worth, I accepted the position and calculated my cost of living based on the assumption that I'd be paying Japanese income taxes, and I'd rather pay that than US income tax. I'm just not sure what I'm actually supposed to be doing here. "
1188,EEA Family Permit from South Africa,"I would like some advice please on applying for an EEA family permit.   Currently my wife and I both live in South Africa. We have been married for 4 months but dated for a year before we got married.  She has an EU passport because she is an Italian Citizen. I am a South African citizen.   We have decided to immigrate to the UK. So as I understand it I can apply for an EEA family permit and once there I can apply for the 5-year residency permit.  My concern is ensuring that the EEA family permit application goes smoothly. So besides the documents they request like my marriage certificate, Valid passport etc.  what else should I do?  We will be travelling together ideally at the same time. I would prefer that as opposed to her going first to have the opportunity to start exercising her Treaty rights in the UK and then me joining her soon after that.  A few questions:   1)  What else must I do to ensure this application goes smoothly?  2)   Would it help to show our relationship via WhatsApp messages, Wedding photos, Dating photos etc?  3)  Would it help to provide all my educational qualifications? I am in IT and have a number of certificates and Diplomas (idea is to show I will not be burden on the state)  Thanks all in advance for your assistance "
1189,Moving to Japan from the US with a visa: How do I prepare for the immigration officer?,"I'm asking this question largely as a safety net, in case there's something I'm not seeing that's going under the radar.  I got a job recently in Japan, and I received a visa to be able to work there.  As an American, I got the visa at a Japanese consulate in the US. They attached it and another, folded document inside the passport (The folded document was the CoE 'Certificate of Eligibility'). They said basically to just take that passport over there within three months to enter Japan.  Is there anything else I need to do before then to prepare for the immigration officers (and anybody else similar to that), to be allowed in? Are there any other documents or items that are needed? Even if not, do I need to plan to have any particular answers ready or anything else to get through immigration? Do I need to be in a suit and tie or anything?  As far as I can tell, I can dress casually, just show them the passport, maybe have a booking confirmation for my hotel with me, smile and be polite, and then I can expect it to go smoothly. Is that so?  UPDATE  Wow, that was easy to deal with!   I entered the country a few days ago, and @jpatokal 's answer was exactly the situation I encountered.  The immigration officer asked me to double-check or confirm a couple of things, mainly what all of them were doing, but I don't remember being asked anything subjective or really meaningful.  It was far from an interview, and I was done with her in maybe five minutes.  So thanks for both answers! "

1191,Directive 2004/38/EC. Bringing my girlfriend back after she had to go home because of a death in her family,"I am German citizen living and working in Sweden where I met my girlfriend, who is from the Philippines. Together we applied for her residence card with the local migration agency in Sweden (Migrationsverket) at the beginning of the year so she can stay with me even after her original visa had expired. We're living together in the same apartment just like married partners but are not married.  Sadly last week she got the tragic news that her dad died unexpectedly in the Philippines. She wanted to go home to be with her family. However the decision to go home was not as easy as it may seem, because with our pending application it was not clear to us if she'd be able to re-enter Sweden without problem once she felt like returning home to me.  We then spoke with the migration agency about our case and they gave us a printout confirmation that our application is registered and pending and advised us to talk to the Norwegian embassy in the Philippines about a tourist/Schengen visa.  On their website I read about the Directive 2004/38/EC, which seems to apply to us with me as a German living in Sweden. But is it possible to base our Schengen visa application on that directive even if we are not married (yet)? And how can we prove that we are in a relationship? According to their website this is required for us in order to apply.  My girlfriend went home last weekend because for us it was the highest priority that she could be with her family during times like these. I hope that there is a relatively easy way to bring her back to me in a couple of weeks.  Thank you so much for any kind of help! "
1192,Can I board a flight to Canada without a passport?,"I have an employer in Canada sponsor a visa for me so that I can go and work there as a skilled immigrant.  In Iran, under certain circumstances which currently apply to me, you either have to give a security deposit of about 11K USD or spend a two-year term in the military to be allowed to apply for a passport and be able to leave the country.  It should be noted that Iran and Canada have cut diplomatic relations recently and there is no active Canadian embassy in Iran.  I would like to know:    If I cross the border without a passport to a neighboring country (e.g. Iraq or Turkey), will I still be able to get a visa from the Canadian embassy over there and then buy a ticket and get on board of a flight to Canada? I could leave Iran under a special passport to visit Iraq for a religious visit. Does that kind of passport do me any good here?  "
1193,Does ACS recognize student employment?,"I'm planning to apply for either the Subclass 187 (Regional Sponsored) or the subclass 190 (Skilled Nominated) Visa some time in the near future. My nominated skilled occupation would be 'Software and Applications Programmers' which is assessed by ACS.  There are two things that I'd like to find out about the skills assessment.  This ACS document writes that in order to even get assessed by this authority, the candidate must have at least 2 years of working experience in the nominated occupation or in a closely related one (never mind the other options listed there, it is the first white row that applies to me). This more comprehensive document explains that they only consider working experience the time that the applicant has spent in the nominated occupation after obtaining some sort of certificate, such as a BSc degree.  My situation: I have an IT BSc and MSc degree. I started working 1 year after I had obtained my BSc degree, while I was still doing my MSc studies. During this time I had been working in my to-be-nominated skilled occupation, but as a student, with the involvement of a student job agency (24-28 paid hours a week on avg.).  My questions:   Does the ACS even recognize employment as a student if I can provide them with the necessary documents (reference letters, etc.)? If so, is it an option that I only attach my BSc degree to my EOI despite that I also have an MSc one? In other words, can they find out that I also have an MSc one (I didn't do my studies in Australia) and if so, can this cause any problems, or will they simply say 'OK, if he only wants to attach his BSc degree that's fine with us'? (I'd do this because like this I would only need to wait 1 more year to hand in my EOI since I already have 1 year of working experience which I had obtained before I finished my MSC studies.)  "
1194,Purchasing insulin in Canada,"I will be spending the next four months in Toronto, Canada on an academic sabbatical, during which period I will have health coverage through my US employer. I have a work permit to do academic research in Canada. I am also diabetic.  My insurance will cover 90 days of insulin at a time, so one solution is to bring 90 days with me and return to the US for another 90 days shortly before that runs out. It would certainly be more convenient to purchase it in Canada.  What must one do to get a prescription from a US doctor to a Canadian pharmacy which will be covered by American insurance?   EDIT Having done some more research, it looks like I need to have a Canadian doctor co-sign the prescription and there are a lot of regulations about this. Is this something which is easy to arrange?   It is very hard to search for this, because I am swamped by information about Canadian online pharmacies, and people buying drugs to take back to the USA. "

1196,Job hunting in Netherlands for a foreigner (while abroad),"I am a UK citizen but have been living in Asia for awhile. Recently I wanted to relocate back to EU for an mechanical engineering career, and Netherlands is one of the place that I am considering. I have started applied couple dozens of engineering positions online, but most of the HR/agency that I spoke with wanted me move to Netherlands first, as the application process would be more convenient for interviews and such. But since I don't really have a place to stay in UK/EU anymore, I am a little confused about what to do.  Should I find a temporary apartment and moved there first while I try to seek a job there? How difficult is it to find a cheap temporary housing in Netherlands? The concerned that after I moved there and I am still not be able to find a job in a relatively short time. So I wondered if I could intern/volunteer in a smaller/local company while I am staying there for job hunt, thus my CV won't be empty in case of the initial unsuccessful job hunt.   Although I can't speak Dutch at all yet, I don't mind learning another language. I have studied some basic German before, which might helps to learn Dutch a little bit.   Are there national career service or something similar in Netherlands that I could speak to for advice? If you have any tips for applying jobs aboard please share as well. Thank you for your help in advanced.  "
1197,Is it possible for my country's embassy to arrest me abroad?,"I am a Syrian refugee who escaped the war! In my country I am considered an outlaw for doing this. I currently live in Romania and I need to visit the embassy to renew my Syrian passport as they officially announced that they are renewing passports, even for people who are outlaws.  Now, could I be arrested for breaking the Syrian law inside the embassy of Syria in Romania? And maybe later be transferred back to Syria? "
1198,Can I have a C type and a D type visa end-to-end?,"I have received a D type visa to study in Czech Republic. It starts on September 11th. But I would like to go there earlier. When applying to a C type (toursitic) Schengen visa, the issuing country obviously wants me to come back to my country after the expiry date.  What happens if I have a C type visa from another Schengen country from August 20th to September 12th? Should I as well come back and go again, or can I just activate my D type by the alien police and stay there after expiration of my C type visa?  A slightly related problem that I am facing is, is it possible to have a C type visa starts before a D type? "
1199,Entering the US with car using J-visa,"I am a Mexican J1-visa holder (PhD student) that studies in the US. I have been checking my options on buying a car to use in Northern California and it seems that the cheapest –– by a big margin –– would be to buy a car in Mexico and use it in the US. My plan is to return with the car to Mexico after I finish the PhD. Let me give you an example:   Toyota Prius 2016 in the US: starts at 24,200 USD.  Toyota Prius 2016 in Mexico: starts at ~ 17,900 USD.   As California, Mexico City has very strict emission standards so my guess is that companies like Toyota or Honda produce cars that pollute in similar amounts in Mexico and in the US so emissions seem not to be a problem. This gives me several questions:  (1) Is it possible to take your car from Mexico to the US for a long period of time? Say, 4 or 5 years for example? What are the requirements and costs to take such an endeavour?  (2) Am I allowed to exit the US without my car (by plane), leave my car in the US, while taking short trips in Mexico?  Thanks!  Edit [1 year after]: Thanks everyone for the comments and answers. Because it is quite difficult to import a car to the US, I decided to buy a car in the US. Let's hope that the new NAFTA brings more integration (yeah, right... :>). "

As a visa requirement, I have to mention entry and departure dates on the visa form. What do I put in the case of a work visa (stay for more than 1 year)? For the visa application, does booking of ticket (not buying) will be ok, or do I need to buy for all 5 family members? Surely I'll be buying them, but after we get the visa. Can I buy one-way tickets or do I need to buy return tickets? I want to save money here.   "
1203,Can I legally back out on a job offer after accepting?,"I'm a US citizen living in the Netherlands with an indefinite work contract and work permit. I'm looking for new work, and I want to understand my legal rights once I have either verbally accepted a new position, or signed a new employment contract.   At either stage (verbal agreement or signed contract) am I within my rights to pull out before the start date of the new position?  I understand that verbal agreements are often considered binding in the Netherlands, and I also understand that employment laws are sometimes different for foreign workers.   If it's not within my legal rights, what are the possible consequences of doing so any way?   Note that I'm not asking if this is strictly a ""good idea"", or whether it's good manners or ethical.  "

1206,Visa questions regarding extension and entry,"I have a tier 2 general visa which expires on 30/09/16.  I needed to extend the visa, so recently I applied the visa in while I was on vacation in my home country( outside UK). So the visa got approved, and I got a new visa sticker (vignette) which is valid from15/09/16-14/10/16.  However, my airplane arrives in UK at 31/08/16.  Can I enter UK on the date? The date 31 Aug is before the valid start date for new visa, while it is also before the expire date of my old visa.  is my old visa still valid at 31/08/16? Or is it no longer valid since I got a new one? I am curious whether I must postpone my airplane or not... ( If I have to postpone, it will also cause some trouble for my job..)  Thank you for your answer in advance. "

1208,Can I get a French long-stay visa after entering on a short-stay visa?,"I am a USA national. My wife is a French national (children dual). We reside in the USA. My wife is a professor and has received a sabbatical. We will accompany my wife on her sabbatical. We intend to spend the first part in South Africa. We intend to be there for very nearly three months and then go to France. From what I have read, I am supposed to apply for my French long-stay visa (for spouse of French national) in my country of residence and within three months of arriving in France. This leaves a very narrow window in which to secure a visa at the consulate here in the USA.  Other information: We will be in France for ~4.5 months. I am a software developer and will continue to work for my USA company while in France. I will have business in Spain (attending conference) during my stay in France. I may want to visit countries outside the Schengen area while staying in France (e.g. Morocco).  I have read what official resources there are about visas that are provided in English. I know there is more information in French but I do not read French well enough to navigate those resources.  So, is there any way I can either, apply for the long-stay visa while in South Africa or apply for it after I arrive in France (which would, by default, be on a short-stay visa)? Any other ideas? I would prefer to stay within proscribed procedures rather than taking any chances. "
1209,Receive payment outside university when on F1 visa?,I have a friend from Russia who is working on his PhD. He has a US student visa (F-1).  We have received a job to create a mobile application for our local government in which we would both receive a fairly large payment. He has informed me that his visa restricts him to only working for the university at a maximum of 20 hours per week.  Is there anyway he could receive payment? Small loop hole?  My plan was to create my own business and allow them to 1099 me. If he could be paid through this method that would be ideal. 
1210,"Depositing a ""not negotiable"" Australian cheque in the US?","After working in Australia some time ago and moving back to the United States, I received a cheque from the Reserve Bank of Australia for my superannuation funds.  Unfortunately, I'm having a problem depositing this with my US bank.  The main problem is that the cheque is marked ""Not Negotiable"" vertically along its face.  My understand of this term within the Australian banking system is that it simply means the check cannot be endorsed to another party; it can only be deposited by the named person (i.e. me).  But in the US, ""non-negotiable"" means it's not a valid check and my bank won't touch it.  I've talked to another bank and they gave me the same response.    Is there any way to get around this issue?  Perhaps there is another bank in the US that is more used to dealing with Australian cheques?  Has anyone else found a way to deal with this? "
1211,Going from H1-B to H4 but still work,"Suppose that, for a married couple, both are on an independent H1-B visa with one of their I-140 approved. Suppose now that it is the end of 6 years for both. By virtue of the I-140, one spouse can get his/her H1B renewed. The other might have to go on to the H4 visa. Given the recent change that H4 spouses can work, is there are 6-year limit there too? Does that fact that the spouse has already used up 6 years prevent him/her from getting the H4 work ability? "

1213,Is there a waiting period prior to applying for a Tier 2 Dependant Visa?,"I'm going to start working for the NHS before the year ends. My CoS doesn't cover my dependant (husband). I asked my agency (home based) about applying for the Dependant Visa (after I've read about it in the UKVI website) just to confirm, and they said I need to wait 3 months before I can go ahead and apply. For a second opinion, I asked my UK based agency about it, too. They said I need to wait 6 months before I can apply. Now I know from the UKVI website that this isn't true because I can apply with my dependant at the same time. Question is, if I missed something in the numerous guides in the UKVI. Does anyone know about a 3-6 month rule before applying for a dependant? I've insisted to both my agencies that the wait isn't necessary and they'd just answer with a ""No, you'll have to wait."" and I don't want to waste time because if I can apply with my husband for both our visas at the same time, why would we wait for 3 months?  Another question is, do we have to provide accommodation requirements? My friend is residing in the UK and she's offered to take us in until we find an apartment. Thing is, she's in a flat share. She'll rent out one of the rooms for us to stay in until we are able to find suitable accommodation. Would a letter from her suffice for the dependant visa application  in terms of proving that we've got the accommodation covered?  Do we need to provide relationship proof, too? We've been married for 8months, and we've been together 3 years before that. "

My girlfriend is also Greek with a Greek passport. We are not married.

Is there anything I can do to avoid entering it? If not, how can I notify them that I want to leave in 3 months?

1217,What's the minimum length of time on an IR1 visa entry to USA?,"My [Chinese] wife was granted an IR1 visa to immigrate into the USA.  As is typical, she has about a 6 month window to enter, this is fine.  How long would she need to stay minimum on this first entry?  They say the actual green card would be mailed within 45 days, however I do not want her to have to sit in the USA for 45 days, we've already registered my daughter in school in Shanghai.  Can we enter, and turn around and leave without any issues even though the physical green card has not been received?  Is there any official documentation about this?  I've searched, and I see forum posts (and have not yet found actual documentation from gov sites about this) that go both ways, I just want to know the actual legal situation on it today, in 2016.  Back story: I'm a USA citizen, born and bred, but living in Shanghai.  Years ago, my wife overstayed her visa by a couple weeks, inadvertently (because our daughter was in school in the USA, and is definitely a USA citizen) and was refused every single visa since even though it was stamped ""cancelled without prejudice"", the persons refusing her told her the only way is to get a ""green card"" and so here we are.  We started this process in 2014. "
1218,Can I renew my blue card (from Germany) even if my passport expired?,"I'm from a non-EU country and I have a blue card from Germany and I'm working there. Both my passport and the blue card are going to expire at the same time in a year from now.  When my passport expires, I won't be able to renew for at least 9 months after the expiry time. That's because my country's embassy will not renew my passport unless I provided them with a specific document which I won't be able to obtain except after 9 months of the expiry of my passport.  Is there any way to renew my blue card even if my passport is already expired ? or maybe is there any way to temporarily extend my blue card for these 9 months till I actually get a new passport ?  Or maybe, is there any alternative identification document that I can apply for from the German authorities that I can use when renewing my blue card ?  Also, if the same situation happened but I've a permanent residency instead of a blue card, are there any difference ?  I'm basically trying to find a legal way to allow me to stay in Germany and work there during these 9 months where both my passport and blue card has already expired. I don't care about my ability to travel abroad during this time, only about my ability to stay in Germany and work there. "

The purpose is a new employment (Got a job in Germany). I was going through the checklist and found out about the travel health insurance -      Certificate about compulsory health insurance (Gesetzliche   Krankenversicherung) from German employer valid from date of   employment.

So, I am assuming that the travel health insurance is not required at the time of application, but only after approval. Is that correct?  I already have a confirmation from my new employer which mentions the following text -      This letter is to confirm that we will ensure that our prospective   employee , born on  will obtain health   insurance in Germany and  is taking care of registering   the employee for the health insurance.   I confirmed with the HR and she says I still have to buy a health insurance. She doesn't know whether it's before or after appointment/approval.

The items I'm planning to bring are not large or expensive (no furniture), it's just books, clothes for special occasions, kitchenware, and similar. However they're my things and I'd like to have them in the UK.   What are likely to be considered ""exceptional circumstances"" for exceeding the 12-month relief for bringing goods from outside the EU? What options are there other than applying for relief? Is going through a Customs assessment and paying assessed duty an affordable option for a private individual like myself? (If total cost, including handling fees, is more than 100% of the replacement value I would not consider that affordable).   "
1235,EEA and Non EEA want to get married and settle in UK,"I've been in a long distance relationship for almost 5 years and now finally want to settle down with my fiance in the coming months. My fiance is from Bulgaria and I am from India. I had a couple of questions regarding the process leading to application for immigration and the ease of doing it from various places.  I am currently working in India and have my own business, however, my fiance is currently employed and is a PhD candidate in the UK. Whats the easiest and the cheapest way for me to get permit (work/family etc) to settle in with my fiance in the UK. We intend to marry asap.   Would it be easy to do it all in the UK? I know the application for such a visa is expensive and includes additional NHS costs as well. Over and above it seems far more paper and legal work. Since my fiance is a EU national, we do have the choice of getting married in any EU country (including Bulgaria). However, are there any advantages/drawbacks to this when applying for UK family permit (or whatever visa grants me entry and work permit in UK?). Finally would it be any helpful if we register our marriage in India first and then apply for the required visa?  We haven't lived together for more than a month since the first year being together. However have managed to see each other atleast once in 7-8 months either in UK, India or Bulgaria.  Any help/inputs will be much appreciated.  "
1236,UK Tier 4 Student Visa - Need some guidance,"My daughter recently got unconditional offer for a 3 year undergraduate from a UK university. We are all US Citizens living in CA. Her start date is Oct 7th. I have few questions regarding the Visa process and clarity on the time duration between each step of the process:   The Gov.uk site says that we need to apply maximum 3 months before the start of course. We have a planned family travel starting July 25th out to another country for 4 weeks which will require us to have her passport with us. Which means we have to apply after July 7th so that by July 25th she gets her passport with student visa. Due to this time constraint, I am considering to use the San Francisco Premium application center for processing. If I buy the Bronze package, will it be enough time to get the Tier 4 (Student) visa? What is the difference in processing times between the Bronze, Silver package and the regular self-managed process? Can the visa process be expedited by myself without using any of the premium packages? The requirement to apply “3 months before the course start” is considered from the time you submit the online application OR from the time you go for an actual appointment at the SF Premium center? Meaning, can I do the online paperwork in advance, so that I get the appointment as close to July 7th? How many days of wait is usually to get the appointment either at the regular support center and the Premium support center? Is there an option to apply for the Visa without having to send the original passport so that while we are in travel, the Visa process can continue? Alternative to all this that we apply for her visa after returning from our international travel in end of August. Again, the question is if that will be enough time from start to finish? Somewhere on the UK govt site, I see an option to to ask them question via email, but it has an associated charge to ask question via email. Anyone used this service?   Thanks for your help in advance. "

I've a graduate degree of Bachelor of Technology in Electronics and Communication stream. Currently, I'm working in IT domain.  What are the chances of my visa approval if my educational assessment isn't in par with work experience. I've seen few posts on internet where people mentioning about this criteria being the main root cause for their visa rejection.  Do they accept Electronics and Communication engineering degree okay for an IT job? I agree Mechanical, Chemical and Civil engineering degrees aren't close to IT but I feel ECE is bit closer compared to others.  Has someone's visa got accepted with this criteria? "

Actually I do an internship for 6 months in Switzerland that was signed as a convention between French and Swiss university and I have an L-permit. Now the Swiss propose me to stay until December to finish the current project, but that will be the stay outside the dates of signed convention between universities. Is there any danger to prolongate my swiss L-permit, if I plan to return to France and to re-apply for the student permit?

I lived in the Netherlands for a few years but left months ago. In a few weeks I'll be moving to another country outside of the EU.  I never closed my Dutch bank account. I like my bank, I'm happy with their service and their low fees. I have some savings (above 21K). I would like to keep using that account from abroad for as many years as possible, have my monthly income paid on that account etc. Can I do that if I'm not a Dutch national?  Also, how can I pay tax for the interest rates I get from my savings? Note that the last tax return I had to do was for the year 2016, and (I think) I don't have to do my taxes in the Netherlands again since I wasn't a resident after that.  "

My visa is being processed, but if the visa is processed after the start date I'm unsure what I can do.  Would I be able to work remotely for them while physically outside of Europe, or is this against the rules? I haven't found anything very clear on this topic.  Alternatively, in the past I have invoiced US customers for consulting from my Canadian corporation. Would I be able to do something similar to that in for DE?

1247,Applying for the Dutch nationality (through naturalisation) outside of the Netherlands - which civic integration exams?,"I am Ghanaian married to a Dutch woman for the past 6 years. We are currently living in the UK (since September, 2013) and so have successfully passed the test of 3 years continuous living together that is required in order for me to apply for the Dutch nationality. The only outstanding issue on the checklist is that of having evidence of Civic integration diploma or other proof of civic integration. Since we are living in the UK, I can only sit for the Civic Integration Exams abroad at the Dutch embassy in London. When I tried to register for this exams, it states that     It is NOT the exam you need to do in order to apply for Dutch   nationality   I am now at a loss since the other civic integration exam can only be taken within the Netherlands. What are my options? Should I just go ahead with the exams here in the UK and submit it as ""other proof of civic integration"". Has anyone ever applied for the Dutch nationality through this route before? Any pointers will be really appreciated. I have been calling the Dutch immigration service number but I get no response. "
1248,Which addresses to use when filling out form I-130,"I'm preparing the form I-130 to start the process of gaining US residency for my foreign-born wife.  Lines B2 and C2 ask for my address and hers, respectively.  Later, on lines C18 and C19 I'm also asked for my spouse's current and future addresses.  The unofficial, line-by-line instructions here say:     Part B      2-5.   Self-explanatory      18.   Your US address should preferably be the same as your relative's address, otherwise USCIS may get suspicious.      While, it is possible that you may want to spend some time away from your relative for school or work reason, it is best to put your permanent address in US same as your relative's US address.      If you have a compelling reason to put different address, attach detailed explanation with the application or consult an immigration attorney.   My situation is that I will be staying outside of the US with my wife until the application process is completed.  I also prefer to receive my US mail to a commercial mailbox/scanning service, rather than to the physical address where we'll be staying.  So which address(es) should I use?  My best guess at this point:   B2 (my address): Enter the address of my commercial mailbox C2 (relative's address): Enter her current foreign address C18: Enter the physical address where we intend to live in the US C19: Enter her current foreign address again Attach a letter explaining the situation   Is this the best course of action?  Alternately I could list my foreign address on B2, along with hers. But I feel that mail to the US address will be more reliable, faster, and cheaper. "

1250,Bringing household domestics to the UK,"A family that is relocating to the UK on a Tier 1 (Investor) visa retains a cook and a nanny at their home on the outskirts of Moscow.  The family would like to bring these along, but they are not mentioned as dependents on the T1 visa, and they are not related to the primary T1 holder.  The family contemplates eventually qualifying for British citizenship with a long-term view towards keeping two households and shuttling the domestics back and forth as needed.  Do the cook and nanny need to apply for a work permit on Tier 2 of the points-based regime?  How would they qualify given that the EU has lots of people who could presumably fill those roles?  Does the T1 primary need to clear the Resident Labour Market Test hurdle?  Are there any other special considerations that need to be considered? Or can they simply chain together continuous visitor visas to remain in the UK? "

I am British therefore to my knowledge have no problem living there.  The concern is my Japanese partner. She can stay in Spain for 90 days (correct?) as things currently stand. If she manages to find a position then there would be the work permit route or possible student visa. I am thinking of the more obvious route however.  We are currently in Japan and have flights booked back to UK in two months' time.  If we were to get married, where should we do this, (Japan/UK/Spain)?  And will this (gallant but horridly unromantic) gesture solve the visa problem so that we are able to stay together (forever) and beat the bureaucrats?  I am aware that UK changed the rules regarding salary minima but recently read something concerning a loophole, in that living in Europe but not UK classes us or my partner under EU rather than UK law.

Which Representative or Senator should citizens not living in the US apply to, and what address should they use?  If I use my current address I think I might be denied as being outside of the congressperson's district; if I use my last address in the US (last valid more than twenty years ago) that might be considered a security or legal problem.

I have lived and worked in Greece and I also have a registration certificate from their immigration.    As we want to move directly to Greece now, can I register our marriage in Greece or I have to do it in Romania where my permanent address is? If I go back to Romania and he wants to fly directly to Greece and meet me there, can he apply for a visa to Greek embassy with our marriage certificate and can he also apply for a 5 years residence permit in Greece so that we can settle down there?   The information I have is that first I need to register the marriage (but where, Romania or Greece, as I also have registration certificate from Greece?), then I have to send him the documents do that he can apply to Greek embassy for visa and then he can also apply for a 5 years residence permit in Greece, is that correct?

They plan to arrive and begin their studies next January (2016).  Will they be able to work part-time to help defray the cost of their education?    Also, if they do really well at their studies and a UK company wants to hire them after graduation, will they be able to make an in-country application for a work permit (Tier 2)?  This is posed as a single question because students invariably consider both as a single question when they contemplate applying for a student visa. "

1264,US G-4 visa spouse rules,"I've been trying to find the precise text of the laws relating to G and A visas. There's apparently a law that you can't apply for any other non-immigrant visa than a G or A if you're eligible to apply for a G or A. In particular, if your spouse has a G or A visa, then you can't apply for e.g. an H-1B.  I've not found clear information of the situation where a spouse is already a nonimmigrant visa holder. Are you forced to give up your old visa in this case? I've tried to find the actual text of the law that governs this, but I can't find it. Is anyone able to point me to the exact text?  To be clear. I'm not looking for an answer to any other question than getting a pointer to the precise text. "
1265,Visa refusal despite Work/Residency permit granted,"I got a job offer from a company registered in Malta, as I am third country national (TCN) and not from the EU, I was required to apply for a work/residency permit.  The company applied on behalf of me for the single process of work and residency permit, and after two months the permits were granted.  Based on that, the company sent me a copy of the work permit and I applied with it for a visa. (The residency permit I get it automatically once I am in Malta).  After 14 days waiting for the visa, I got the response from the embassy of Malta with visa denial, stating that: ""Your intention to leave the territory of the member state before the expiry of visa could not be ascertained"".   I am really confused here, I have a work and residency permit, so this not applicable to my case, isn't it? Now, what I am thinking about is, that I apply for a Schengen for another EU country (Spain or France), and using this visa I enter Malta, and once there I get my residency permit, is this lawful?  "
1266,Renunciation of original nationality in the process of becoming a Dutch citizen,"I have been living and working in the Netherlands for a while now and I have recently become a Dutch national through naturalization. At the request of the Immigration Services (IND) I have submitted an application at the consulate of my country of origin to give up my original nationality as otherwise the IND can annul my new citizenship. It has been brought to my attention that once I give up my original nationality I can simply claim it back due to the laws regulating dual nationality of Dutch citizens. The basis for this claim can be found here:   [website]I have copied the part of the website that is relevant to my case below.     Bent u meerderjarig? Dan verliest u in de volgende gevallen de Nederlandse nationaliteit van rechtswege (=automatisch):  U neemt vrijwillig een andere nationaliteit aan. Dit geldt niet als:     u in het land van die andere nationaliteit bent geboren en daar ook woonde toen u die andere nationaliteit verkreeg;    It says that you automatically lose your Dutch nationality if you voluntarily take up another nationality. The exception to this rule is that you were born in the country from which you are getting the new nationality AND also living in that country at the time that you obtained the new nationality.  So it seems to me that I can simply relocate to my country of origin for a few months, get my citizenship back and come back to the Netherlands with two passports. What I don't understand is, assuming that I am right, why are they forcing people to give up their nationalities during the naturalization process if they can just get it back later on? I could give the IND a call but you don't usually get the most accurate information from them. So I thought I could give it a shot here.  Edit: My country of origin allows me to regain my nationality under very mild conditions. They don't even require me to relocate there. "
1267,Take-home pay: US vs Netherlands,"I'm a US citizen, working currently for a US company, but am considering a position for a company in Amsterdam.  In absolute terms, the Amsterdam job would pay roughly 13% less than I am currently earning in the United States.  But how does this compare after taxes, health insurance, etc?  At my current employer, my take-home pay, after tax withholding, etc, is roughly 73% of my base salary.  My employer also pays 100% of my health insurance costs, which is a big bonus.  So how can I quickly estimate my take-home pay based on a base salary in the Netherlands to make a roughly apples-to-apples comparison? "
1268,How difficult is it for a US citizen to go back to the US with a non-resident spouse?,"My fiancee is in the US legally on a non-immigrant visa.   She didn't know me before she came, she hasn't worked here, our relationship is bona fide, etc. So after we get married here in the US, she should qualify for Adjustment of Status and be able to stay while waiting for her green card.   But, we want to move abroad soon. We were planning to get married in a few months, and then travel for a while, eventually settling abroad.   However, after reading about the difficulties getting a non-citizen spouse into the US, I'm worried that if we change our minds and decide to come back to the US, we'll find ourselves stuck in limbo for a few years waiting for her to get a green card when she could have got it easily if we just stayed.   It even sounds like we would have a hard time just coming back to visit my family temporarily; it's not clear if as my wife she would even be able to get a non-immigrant visa again.  Our lease is up soon, we were excited to go abroad for while, but how difficult would it be for us to come back to live in the US, from a legal point of view? Would staying until she has a green card makes things easier in the future? "
1269,How do you change from a tourist visa to a TN visa without leaving the US?,"Came to the US from Canada on a regular visa, got a job offer while I was here. Do I need to leave the country and re-enter to switch to a TN visa, or can I submit something while I am here to change my status? If so, what do I need to submit and where?  I've tried Googling around, haven't found official information on this. "
1270,Income tax on J1 visa for 24 months on foreign salary while paying home social security taxes,"I have a few questions on taxation while being on a J1 visa (category research scholar).   Background information:   I am a Netherlands National I will start in December 1, 2015 as a postdoctoral researcher in the US, NYC. I have not had any kind of VISA for the US before. I will stay for exactly 24 months (Dec 1,2015 – Nov 31, 2017). After that I will return to the Netherlands and continue to work there.  I will be paid a salary by my home university in the Netherlands throughout this period in the US (FOREIGN income!). Because I am in the US for 3 calendar years (2015,2016,2017) I believe I am a non-resident alien in 2015 and 2016, and a resident alien for 2017 because I am more than 183 days in the US.   A tax advisor from my home university has looked into my situation to determine where I should pay income tax and social security tax according to NL-US tax treaties and Dutch law. It appears I need to pay SS taxes in the Netherlands even while I am staying in the US. However for income tax he thinks I should pay tax in the US and not the Netherlands, while staying in the US.  However, I have read that for the first 2 years J1 visa holders are usually exempt from federal income and FICA taxes.  My questions are:   Are both federal and FICA based on residence status? So am I correct in assuming that I need to pay federal income tax + FICA tax for 2017, but that I am tax exempt for 2016 and 2015? Elsewhere I have read advice that federal taxes need only to be paid if you are in the US for more than 24 months, regardless of calendar year (i.e. I am in the US for 24 months but in 3 calendar years). Can you comment if this is the case for my situation? I am receiving a FOREIGN income as a salary, not a fellowship, although the salary was paid from a fellowship that was awarded to me. However, the fellowship is intended as a real salary and not just to cover tuition or other direct costs. Does this in anyway changes above situation? I am obliged to pay Netherlands SS taxes by Dutch law. There is a totalization agreement between the US and NL. Does this mean I can claim exemption from FICA for 2017? Or do I need to pay and then try to claim back?  "
1271,Expat-friendly local bank in the Philippines?,"I've been banking with BDO for a while, but I've found their service to be fraught with red tape and charges for very minor services.  Just now, I was trying to move to a new branch. Going to a branch different from the ""home"" one, even across the street, incurs a fee. To move, one goes to the new branch, opens a new account, then returns to the old branch and sets up a transfer to close the old account.  Despite the posted requirements for opening an account, and already being a customer, the new branch refused me because I don't have my passport on hand. (It's at the US Embassy for renewal.) Since it seems to be no simpler to stay with BDO than to transfer everything elsewhere, I'm considering a customer service upgrade.  Is BPI just the same? Perhaps some bank offers perks to American citizens? "
1272,What can I do about getting a visa to work in the US as a Canadian?,"I'm a Canadian student, who opted into a co-op program. I wanted to work in the US for one of my work terms, and I recently got an internship (4 months) there starting in May.  I was wondering what kind of Visa I can go for, and if I can get a TN Visa as a student. Is the technology sector (CS) covered under NAFTA?   Is there any way to inexpensively get a visa to work in the US for 4 months as a Canadian? "
1273,My non-EU husband working in Ireland,"I am a EU citizen. Recently got married to non-EU citizen. We have a marriage certificate done in Mexico where we got married.   Now, I have a job in EU (Ireland). How can my non-EU husband accompany me Ireland and work? What steps we should take?  What documents are needed to proceed so my non-EU husband work and live in EU with me? "
1274,Working in the EU: I come from USA and I have Italian passport,"I recently got my citizenship in Italy through jus sanguinis. I live in the USA, but have an Italian birth certificate and passport. How hard would it be now for me to get a job in the EU? And by hard I don't mean the actual task of finding the job and applying but the work associated with getting a working visa. I realize that this may vary from country to country, but if I wanted to work in the Netherlands, or the UK would that be readily possible?  "
1275,How can I expedite a Temporary Residency renewal in Mexico?,"I'm a US Citizen with Mexican residency.  I will be out of Mexico until June 1, then I have plans to leave the country again around July 1.  My Temporary Residency visa (often referred to by the old name, FM3) expires July 7, so this gives me just about exactly a month during which time I will be in the country to renew my visa.  Is there any way I can expedite the process, or help ensure that the process will be completed before July 1?  Can the process be started while I am still out of the country, by hiring an agent to start the process? "
1276,Am I legally able to do an internship in the US while just operating as a vacationing Canadian?,"I received a job offer from a company in Austin, Texas for an internship for the summer. I'm really interested in going to the US and working for the summer, I feel like it'd be a great opportunity.  I'm new to visas and whatnot, and I talked to the company about it. They mentioned that they consulted an immigration lawyer and she suggested that instead of going through the J-1 or H1-B (I can't do TN as I'm still in the middle of my degree) that it would be easiest just to come to the states as a normal Canadian citizen (which you can do for up to six months) and just work as a ""contractor"" more or less.  I'm totally fine with this, but I wanted to make sure it was indeed legal. For instance, when I get to the border and they ask my reason for visiting the states, what would I say?  My university has connections with Cultural Vistas I think, but it's $1,700 and takes 4-6 weeks to process, and I'd like to start work before then preferably.  Am I going to be in legal trouble if I take the ""contractor"" route? "
1277,Tracking French long stay visa application status online,"I am looking to find a way to track my French long stay visa application. I had my visa interview/appointment on 3/24/2014 at the Consulate general of France in Chicago.  From previous experiences with other visa processes like the USA where I was able to track my visa application status, I am unable to find any way to do so for the French long stay visa.  Apparently, it is possible in Australia to do so via the consulate's website.   Am I missing something? Is there NO way I can track my application's status online? "
1278,Re-entry permit while on Extension of Stay in Thailand?,"Am I eligible for Re-entry permit if my stay in Thailand is based on Extension of Stay, and my visa has been expired a long ago? As far as I understand, re-entry permit can be issued only during the validity of visa itself, not based on Extension of Stay.    Long story. My understanding is that visa is a permission to enter the country. Usually, it is valid for 90 days only, single entry (ED type). Permit to stay is the legal validation of living in the country. An ED-type visa holder needs to apply for Extension of Stay each 90 days during the entire course of study (up to 3 or 5 years, depending on the license granted to a particular school). Hence, just after the 1st extension, your legal stay exceeds the term of visa validity (90 days). On the other hand, re-entry is logically tied with visa itself (by increasing the number of entries to the country), not based on the extension of stay.  Considering the above, is it possible to issue the Re-entry permit after the visa has been expired?    Edit: a little math to clarify. All dates are rough since all durations are 90 days (≠ 3 months).   On Jan/01 I obtain the ED visa; Visa is valid to enter the country up to Apr/01, single entry; On Feb/10 I enter the country; At the airport, I get stamp saying that my stay is valid up to May/10 (= Feb/10 + 90 days); Assume that on March/15 I want to temporarily leave. I apply in the Immigration office to get Re-entry permit which is valid to enter back the country up to Apr/01 (the date of visa validity), no problem; On May/10 I apply to the Immigration office to extend my stay up to Aug/10 (= May/10 + 90 days); Assume that on July/15 I want to temporarily exit the country and return back on July/20;   At this moment, visa is expired (back on April/01). I doubt that re-entry has no sense when visa is expired. "
1279,Period of notice to quit job in Germany,"I have a friend who is interested in quitting his full-time job in Germany. He has been working for a little over 1 year at 40 hours per week. How much notice must he give to his boss when he quits?  The work contract doesn't specify how much notice must be given, merely saying that the normal for Germany applies. His boss has verbally told him that he should say 3 months in advance.  As we are in Germany I assume that notice to quit must be in writing, but are there some other details that he should be aware of? "
1280,Austria: partial expenses refund for training / education courses,I've heard that in Austria (Tirol) the government provides a 30% refund for training / education courses useful for work. Is it true? Where can I find more details? 
1281,Self-employed in Germany - private vs. regular insurance,"I'm a thirty-something freelance programmer starting a business and paid work will be scarce at the beginning (I will for the next 6 months be living from savings), so money for other expenses is tight.   And this is where the mess of choosing a medical insurance comes in. Regular (GKV) vs. private (PKV)?  I'd just like to have ""normal"" medical insurance (a free/cheap doctor check + some medicine) if I get stuck with a cold, tooth ache, etc. - don't care about private room in hospital, chief-doctor, money if I stay in a hospital, etc. etc. I'm in perfect health and even though I do live with my steady girlfriend I don't plan to have children in the next 3-5 years. So obviously I'm after a good deal (financially) but I'd also like to be smart about it (+/- a few euros is not that important).  The problem is that you can't really ask ""an insurance professional"" for help because they'll just refer you to the insurance that pays the highest referral bounty.   I've been reading about it quite a bit online and there is also lots of conflicting info - like regular/GKV seems to be somehow considered better in terms of services offered by a lot of people (especially when you're getting older and kids, etc. + its difficult to go back from private to regular) but on the other hand an equal amount of info states that private insurance wins there. Plus of course (although they officially shouldn't) lots of doctors prefer patients with private insurance. GKV seems to be more expensive once you start earning more than 0 Euros, but I've also read an alarming number of articles ok PKV insurances that started dirt cheap but have doubled in price over a course of 1-2 years.  So what I'm getting at is I guess:   based on what I've said above - would GKV or PKV be a better fit for me?  how do you break through the BS/SEO and find a good insurance? I guess since GKVs are for the most part offering the same services, how do you compare PKV services for the money? (a dangerous question I know) but whats the absolute cheapest private insurance you know? (an equally dangerous one) whats the most stable i.e. best deal private insurance you know (by that I mean the one giving you the most bang for your low low buck and having a good track-record of not going more and more expensive every year)? (interesting to compare) who offers the best private insurance no matter the price? and how does this then compare to regular/GKV insurance?     Note 1. that this question is similar but not the same because here we're talking about self-employment where the conditions are also different and you have to pay your full insurance by yourself. "
1282,Name on pay stubs does not match my visa and passport.,I am working in USA on H1B visa. I have recently joined with a new Employer. The name on pay stubs issued by the new employer has some spelling mistakes and doesn't match the name on my visa and passport. And bad part each month it has different names. I have escalated to my Employer and they say that they will issue new pay checks with correct name. How ever I would like to know.   Does it causes any issues related VISA and Green Card processing? If yes what is the remedy for it?  
1283,"In Ontario, how is ""Licensed driving experience"" defined for people moving from outside Canada?","According to The official [Ministry of Transportation] Driving Handbook, section on drivers from other countries for Ontario, rules for waiving of mandatory waiting periods depend whether an applicant has:   less than 12 months licensed driving experience within the preceding three years more than 12 months licensed driving experience but less than 24 months within the preceding three years, or a minimum of 24 months licensed driving experience within the preceding three years   This must be confirmed by authentication from a foreign licensing agency.    How is ""licensed driving experience"" defined?  I have had my license for 7 years, but sometimes I don't drive for months.  Should I count each calender month during which I have had a non-zero amount of driving, or is it defined in a different way?  How can a licensing agency verify this, anyway? "
1284,Washington accord accredited engineering degree for Australia visa subclass 476,"I recently check the website to apply for 476 visa and I noticed they have changed the way they mentioned the name of recognized institutes and referring to them as Washington Accord institutions, however when I check the name of one institute for instance for Malaysia which is happen to be the country I did my Master's degree and I go through the list only bachelor engineering courses have been listed.  Does this mean that although my university is listed as an accredited institution, my Master's degree does not make me eligible to apply for this visa? Or does it simply mean that since the name of my institution is listed over there it is enough? "
1285,"""Address in Italy"" for elective residency visa","I am trying to apply for an elective residency visa for Italy. My visit to the Italian consulate yesterday was encouraging – almost all of my paperwork is in order – but one item stopped me short: The clerk said I needed proof of address in Italy for the entire year I'm applying for.  (I have already booked an apartment for the first month of my stay and had planned to find longer-term accommodation once I arrived in-country.)  Adding to my trouble, the clerk said that even if I had a rental contract in hand for a private apartment, I would also need to provide a notarized, original copy (in other words, not faxed or emailed) of the property title to prove that the landlord actually owned the place they were renting me.  What's the easiest and quickest way to find long-term accommodation in Italy while I'm in the US? Does anyone know of a long-stay hotel or executive residence (anywhere) in Italy that could send me a contract to fulfill this paperwork requirement? (I believe I won't need the notarized title of a commercial residence as long as I receive the lease on their letterhead.) "
1286,"As an EU citizen living in France, how can I register to vote (eg EU elections)?","As I understand it, as a citizen of another EU country living in France, I'm eligible to vote in some elections, but possibly not all. European Parliament elections should definitely be allowed, and those are coming up fairly soon. (I know that in the UK, EU citizens can vote in local and EU elections, but not national ones, which I understand to be a fairly common model)  So, two related questions:   What elections am I entitled to vote in, as a citizen of another EU country living in France? How do I go about registering for those?  "
1287,"How to choose an expat medical insurance policy, for a non-US citizen?","Expat medical insurance (global medical insurance) is long-term medical cover for those living outside their home country.  It's available from a wide variety of providers (Bupa, Aetna, Cigna, IMG, Aviva, AIG, and dozens of others).  It normally covers ""worldwide"" or ""worldwide excluding USA (and sometimes Canada)"" regions, rather than a single country of residence.    I'm specifically looking at plans for a non-US person resident outside the US (the US is a special case when it comes to health insurance).  Many of the smaller providers (and even some of the large ones) are nominally run from tax havens with minimal regulation (although the admin is often in the US or UK).  Given the lack of regulation, and the wide variety of countries they operate from, are there any organizations or trade associations that rate them for reliability, or compare plans?  There are many specialist brokers that represent a few plans, but it's hard to get an overview of what's possible from them.   When comparing plans, I realise these are some of the things to check for:   how financially stable is the insurer?  Is it even a real insurer, or just a sales front for another plan?  Is there some independent way to find out? how are claims handled?  24x7?  Where? are renewals guaranteed?  If not (or even if they supposedly are), what factors can cause loss of insurance? how are increases calculated?  Most of the US-orientated companies seem to use a ""group"" system, where customers of a similar age are grouped together, which means the risk is spread among a small number of similar people (rather than young new customers), which can cause steep rises.  What other increase methods are used? does the policy have fixed limits for each item, or is there an overall limit? are deductibles (excess) per illness, per visit, per insurance year...   What have I missed from this list?  I've intentionally left off cost, as in general you get what you pay for, if it's cheap there's normally a reason (such as being a loss leader for sharp increases in future years).  What I'm looking for (and probably many others are) is to establish a policy with a company that'll be there, and still offering guaranteed renewals to an acceptable policy at an acceptable price, in 5 - 10 years time.  Is that an impossible objective?  Just to clarify after the first off-target answer, this question isn't about whether I should get such a policy.  It is something I (and many expats) need (I live in multiple countries). I have a policy already, that I'm not super-happy with, and I'm looking for a better one.  With a domestic health insurance policy in one country plus travel insurance, you have time limits for journeys, and are sent home to be treated for anything major.  With global medical policies, you are treated in the country you are currently in (or evacuated to somewhere better), for as long as you're there.  In summary: what methods and checklist should I use to select a long-term expat health insurance policy?  And what should I avoid?   "
1288,Parents names in their passport are not matching the names in my passport. What is the impact on B2 VISA?,"I am from India. And I am working in USA on H1B VISA.  Due to clerical mistake my father education documents have different last name than his original. Same carried to his job documents also.   Where as other set of documents like birth certificate, residence certificate etc.. has his original surname. The original surname carried into my all documents. When I was applied Passport I got with original surname and my father name also printed with original surname.  Later recently we have applied passport for my parents. Since the documents required for applying passport are carrying the other last name, they got other than original surname in their passport. So now the last name for my parents in my passport and their passports are different.  Now I am planning to sponsor B2 VISA to USA for them. So my specific questions are   How much this issue impacts on B2 VISA approval?  If there is impact what are the remedies to subside it? And what additional documents are required to get approval for B2 VISA?  "
1289,What are long-term maintenance requirements of a DV1 Visa?,"Once won, and activated via passing into the US, what obligations do I have which are specific to the ownership of this visa category (as opposed to the regular tax and citizen obligations required by the virtue of living and working in the US)?  Specifically:   Do I need to extend it at all? If so, how? What are conditions upon which this visa expires? If my passport expires, can I request my new passport to feature this as well?  "

1291,Which country gets to prosecute criminal cases over travelers committing a crime in foreign countries?,"My passport contains a paragraph along the lines of ""visitors must respect both the laws of country of origin, and the laws of the visiting country"". I notice I'm feeling confused about this, so here's a hypothetical that might illuminate my confusion:  Two Londoners (UK) go to Las Vegas (Nevada, US) for a fun weekend. During the weekend in the US, they get into a disagreement over hookers, and one accidentally hits the other on the head, fracturing his skull, leading to death (manslaughter). The police catches him in the US.  Questions:   Which country gets to prosecute the murder? If the judgement involves prison, which country is he sentenced to spend this time? If both countries do a separate prosecution, will his time served in the US count towards time in the UK? Can death penalty be exercised to people who's nation of origin frowns upon this?  "
1292,"What are the necessary procedures (unregistering, etc) to follow when leaving Germany as an expat?","I am not an EU national, but I hold the passport of a country which is in the Schengen area. I have been living in Germany since 2012 and hold a residence permit (permanent starting June 2019) and have been working in the country since 2015.  Soon I will have to leave the country for a 10 month training in the US.  What are the necessary steps (with respect to state authorities and active contracts) to take when leaving the country?  For example, couple of questions to consider below:   Do I need to unregister with the city authorities? How does that impact my residence permit? Temporary pause of the employment contract? Unregister with the Pension fund (Versorgungsanstalt des Bundes und der Länder) Unregister with ARD/ZDF? Unregister from any other services (insurance, phone contract, banks)?   Any other important things to consider, which might impact my residence permit / ability to obtain German passport in the future?

1293,Can I study in Germany with a criminal record from the US,"I am a Chinese national who has lived in the US for 15+ years. I have a drug-related criminal charge against me from the US but I left the country before my court date (my lawyer did not feel like it was worth it for me to stick around). This was my first time offence, and non-violent.  I'd like to study in Germany for a masters degree but I'm worried this legal obstacle will prevent me from getting a student visa. I understand that the application asks for ""convictions"". Since I was not convicted (I never went to court) is it super risky for me to say no and leave it at that? I know there is an element of risk involved but I'm also wondering if my Chinese passport will play a role here. Are the German authorities likely to look into my criminal history both in the US (as I've lived there for so long) as well as China (I am a Chinese citizen; FYI I have no record in China). Or is it better to simply be honest and tell the truth (in which case I'm worried I will be denied the visa anyways). Is it wise to simply pretend I've never been to the US (or have spent very limited time there) and show them a clean Chinese criminal record? How likely is it for Germany authorities to look at my criminal history? (I.e. do enough research that they find this unresolved case)  I've also heard of universities asking prospective students to interview for a position. If I apply for a visa to go for the interview will this case come up then as well?  Seeing as how I need to have an acceptance letter from a German university before I apply I'd like to be more informed about my options before I start prepping my university applications. "
1294,Travelling to Netherlands with expired MVV,"This is my first time asking a question on this site. So I would request you to drop a comment / suggest an edit before downvoting or voting to close this question.  I am currently working in India and my employer was about to send me to Netherlands for one year.  I have received MVV and I also have got my visas stamped with the v-number mentioned in MVV. I was supposed to be travelling on first week of this month -- May. But now, that is postponed.  Here is where I am confused. - My MVV is valid from 27th February to 28th May -- end of this month. - My Visa is valid from 2nd May to 1st July -- that is type D visa. - I am yet to receive residence permit card / social security number. (of course)  So the questions are, 1. Do I still need a valid MVV to travel to Netherlands or my Visa has replaced it? 2. Would I be able to travel to Netherlands even if my MVV has expired? i.e after 28th of May? 3. If not, can I apply for the extension of MVV or do I have to reapply for MVV?   "

I currently live in the US and I am required to provide certain medical examinations to Immigration New Zealand. In the medical certificate states:  In countries where Immigration New Zealand has an approved list of panel physicians this certificate must be completed by a listed panel physician. Please see our website at www.immigration.govt.nz/healthinfo to find your nearest panel physician. If you live in a country which does not have any panel physicians, a registered medical practitioner, preferably your own general practitioner, can complete this certificate.  My concern is that the only panel physician within 700miles asks me 550[tex].   Questions:   i) will my application be rejected if I submit the documents completed by my general practitioner? or  ii) in case Immigration New Zealand does not accept my general practitioner's certificates, will they ask me to update the certificates rather then rejecting me?  iii) is there an authority that I can consult on the matter?

My client company has a registered branch in Norway with offices in the country.  Assumptions   Since Norway is in the EEA, I'm an EU citizen and according to this SO, I understand I can work there for any length of time without a visa or residency permit. I would assume contract options in Norway are:   employee (permanent) contractor (employee) contractor (director)    Questions   Would I need to register with social security for that length of time? See this other SO Would I be required to pay taxes in Norway or can I possibly keep in place my current work arrangements? (possibly same as question.1) Provided I have to pay taxes in Norway, what factors should I take into consideration (prioritised) to decide on a new contract type? (see assumptions.2)  "
1300,(How) Can I Re-Enter The USA? (Former Green Card Holder),"I really want to return to the USA for a better quality of life than the UK (in my opinion). My situation is very unique and I want to know if I have a chance (or possibly an advantage) to use my former residency as a way to permanently move into the USA...  About me: I first moved to America with my family in 2004 when I was 10 years old, my mother had won the green card lottery and to this day I still have that permanent resident card. We left in 2009 as the economy was in shambles and my dad could no longer run his business, my green card expired in 2014 so it's been 10 years since I lived on US soil and 5 years since the green card expired, this length of absence makes it very unlikely that I can renew the ironically named 'permanent resident card'.  I've been looking at all the visa options and it seems like none of them are available to me, all being specific to a certain situation (students, marriage, family, venture capitalists, ect.)  My first question is: Is there a visa for the 'average Joe' meaning you don't have family in the US, nor a spouse, nor a degree course, nor a job waiting for you, nor butt-loads of money; you merely have a can-do attitude and a modest income (and an engineering degree if that helps), if there is such a thing, how much does it cost and does it make a difference depending on which country passport you hold (mine isn't actually a UK passport but an EU one).  Second question: can I use my social security card to aid the immigration process? before I left at the age of 15, I had actually been working for almost a year (in the state of Georgia you can be legally employed from the age of 14) so I've paid a little bit of tax and social security, gotta be good for something, no?  Final question: this might sound ridiculous, but I want to use every card I've got and I have a 'sort-of' family member currently in the states who has been a citizen for decades, this person is my great aunt and she lives in Texas where I would really like to move (Texas is big and so am I.... tired of bumping my head on tiny English door frames). I would be happy to assist her with whatever she needs (as she is quite elderly) should I be granted entry, would this serve as an advantage to customs? you know... everyone likes someone who is there to help a senior citizen am I right?  And just to wrap up: if there is any sort of detail or legal loophople that I've missed out then please let me know. It seems like permanent migration to the US is as complicated as marine biology. Thank you for whatever info you can provide. "

They are ready to help with anything if required for my PR application. I also have visited Australia twice, I got my visitor visa approved the last December.  I am looking to apply for a subclass 189 Visa to get PR. Following is the list of occupations that are related to my skill set and not my study (B-Tech).   261211: Multimedia Specialist 261212: Web Developer 261312: Developer Programmer 261313: Software Engineer 232414: Web Designer 232411: Graphic Designer  I will be able to get 30 points for Age, 20 points for English.  The query is will I be able to get 15 points for my Bachelor degree as it's not related to the occupation I am applying visa for. Also what about points for my work experience as I am self-employed (running my own company since 2014) For Multimedia Specialist, the Occupation Ceiling Value is 1000 but invitations issued are 0, What does this mean? So should I not consider applying under this occupation? I just wanted to know what will be my best bet to apply for PR. I do not mind if my application takes time, I am in no rush and can wait for 1-2 years or more for PR.  "
1307,"If Americans wear shoes indoors, what happens when there are babies?","Shoes indoors - is this common?  So adding to the question linked above,  what happens when Americans have children --    Do they prepare a separate shoes-free room where the baby can freely crawl around?  Or do they suddenly get a RugDoctor job done so that the baby can roam freely around the house? Do they also have the toddlers wear shoes? I've also heard that some people keep their babies in cribs as long as they can't wear shoes, and then have them wear shoes afterwards.    Which is most common? One of my relative's families are Americans yet they go barefoot(somehow); what is the most common arrangement? "
1308,Why the invitations issued is zero if the occupation is part of MLTSSL,Source: [website]Occupation ID: 2612 (Multimedia Specialists and Web Developers) Ceiling Value is 1000 But the strange thing is the number of invitations issued is ZERO (0)  What does this mean? Why the occupation is in the list they are not sending even one invite? I checked the list for upcoming year it is again part of it.I am sure there will be many applications filed under this occupation too but i don't understand why not a single invite is issued. 
1309,Changing the photo on Japanese residence card (zairyu),"I'm moving to Japan next month. I just learned that the photo I sent as part of the visa application will also be printed on my residence card.  Is there any procedure for changing this photo, in case I want a better one for the card? I'm guessing I cannot change it before moving to Japan, but will I be able to change it at the ward office later, or anywhere else? "
1310,Can I stay couple of weeks in Canada after resign my job based on closed work permit?,"My employment is based in India and currently I have been working in Canada for last 4+ years, for the same employer ( their Canadian entity ) under closed work permit.  My closed work permit is valid till July 2020 and visa also have the same validity date.  Because this is a closed work permit and tied with the current employer, I cannot switch jobs within Canada.  Due to some personal reasons, I am planning to resign my current job in Canada and find a new one in India.  In this case, the day I resign my work permit becomes invalid (as per my understanding) , but I am not sure about the visa.  But I need at least a week to 10 days to book ticket to India, closing things like Bank account, Rental and others.  Question:  So, Can I stay 2-3 weeks at Canada after my resignation from my job which is based on closed work permit? Is it legal?  Did anyone have the similar experience? "
1311,Is it possible to live both in Sweden and the UK?,"I would like to know if it is possible to live both in Sweden and the Uk at the same time. I am a European citizen, and have permanent resident in the UK. I also have the Swedish Personal Number (although I am not Swedish national).   Since I work as a free-lancer, I work across different countries in Europe and would like to be based in Sweden and the UK (where I live and have paid taxes for almost 10 years). I think that one may live in both countries at the same time, pay taxes in both countries, as long as I commute between them, but can only pay social contributions in one of them.   I know that in the UK this is possible, but I am unsure about Sweden, as I don't speak Swedish.    What are the consequences of this in Sweden?  Do I need to have foreign health insurance or how does it work?  Do I keep the social rights?  "
1312,Do I need ANABIN certificate to apply for work visa to Germany?,I have got a job offer in Germany and I need to apply for a work visa/EU blue card. I have 4.5 years of experience in software development. I have completed my engineering from a well recognized university in Computer science engineering. I have been reading about ANABIN. do I need this certificate for the work visa application or for applying for BLUE card?   NOTE* I have gone through the ANABIN database and I have found my university as well as my degree recognized. Do I still need the certificate? 
1313,Conversion of work permit into blue card,"I am a software engineer with    9 years of experience in India and  a Bachelor's degree recognized in Germany in the same domain   moving to Germany for 1 year, for an ""on site"" role. My employer create a German contract and will apply for a work permit for me, which i assume will be valid for 1 year. My salary is supposed to be about 60-65K EUR.   My questions are:    Will my work permit be a Blue Card by default ? If not, can I apply for it during my 1 year in Germany? Will I be able to change employers in Germany while on work permit/blue card?   It would be helpful if someone can also point me to the correct official resources where I can get this information.  "
1314,Considering German Residence Permit Types,"I am an American citizen intending to relocate with my German partner (unmarried) to Germany in a few months' time. We have been told unequivocally I can only have one of three permit types (an employment permit, job seeker, student/language course).  I can move there for 90 days without a visa and secure the permit during that time.  I do not currently speak German, so I want to learn German and seek employment. I'm unclear on the ability to seek work while on a language visa, so I want to figure out what is the best combination of visas to get me the longest amount of time to learn German and secure a job (I have a PhD in social policy and previous work experience. I did get second place in a job recently without any German, so I feel that with German I could secure employment).  Can I either a) secure a language permit that allows me to look for work and then change to an employment permit or b) use a language permit until I'm done and then change to a job seeker's permit? Or should I just try to learn enough German in the 90 days and secure a job seeker's permit?  Thoughts on the best course of action would be appreciated. "
1315,Do i need Tuberculosis (TB) test for UK T2 Visa?,"I am currently on T5 visa in the UK, i am going back to Hong Kong in a few days to make a T2 visa and come back to the UK again in mid August to start a new job. Do i need to do TB test in Hong Kong for the T2 visa?   """"""""Who does not need to be tested You will not need a TB test if any of the following apply:  you’re a returning UK resident and have not been away for more than 2 years""""""""  The above is copied from HO website, but am i a ""UK resident""?

1316,Question about I-130A for Marriage Green Card,"What type of birth certificate needs to be included?  It appears we need both my wife's (she is the beneficiary, I am a US citizen) Vietnamese and English copies.  However, can we submit photocopies? Or do we need to submit notarized copies? "
1317,Can a non-EU national apply for a work permit from within Germany on business visa?,"Currently, I'm in a hiring process of a company in Germany as a front-end developer, which is related to software development. The company's hiring process involves visiting the office for a few days and, during the visit, arriving at a decision on a job offer. The company has put me in contact with an agent who is handling the visa process. For the visit to the company's office, the agent registered an appointment for business visa two weeks ago. The appointment is scheduled in the second week of September. Additionally, there will be a wait of about 2 weeks to actually get the visa after the appointment.  Yesterday, the agent also registered an appointment for a work visa, because the queue is long and could result in a long wait in case of a job offer by the company.  My question: If on the visit, the company extends a job offer and I sign a contract while still being in Germany, can't I apply for a work permit and temporary residence permit from within Germany and wait for them to get approved? Is the exit and re-entry with a work visa even necessary? "
1318,H1B visa transfer from F1 without OPT,"I came to the US in 2009 and completed my Master of science in Computer Engineering in 2011. I worked with a semiconductor company from 2011 to 2015 (I changed locations in 2013 but worked with the same employer).  I had to move back to India as my marriage ended in 2015. I had my support system back in India and hence moving to India turned out to be really helpful.  I recently came back to the US on an F1 visa and started my PhD program in January 2018.  But I realized that a PhD is not a piece of cake and it is a lot harder than I thought it to be. So I started applying and found an employer who filed for an F1 to H1B visa transfer.   Is this allowed? F1 to H1B while pursuing graduate studies? I remember giving my marital status as ""single"" instead of divorced. Will this be an issue while the I-129 is being processed? Are there chances of a H1B rejection because I am on an F1 visa?  "
1319,Situation where EU freedom of movement is restricted by a combination of government red tape and corporate policy,"There is a large chain of coffee shops in Sweden. One of their outlets is very near the Norwegian border. Most of the customers in that shop are Norwegians.  A Norwegian girl applied for a job in this coffee shop. The manager said that she was a great fit for the job, and wanted to hire her. The fact that she was Norwegian was a great plus, since most of the customers are also Norwegian.  They signed a contract and tried to get her into the company system. However, the higher executives of the chain said that she needs a Swedish personal identification number and a Swedish bank account before she could even start working.  She went to the Swedish tax office to apply for such a number. They accepted her application, but said that it may take up to eight weeks before her number is issued (their standard processing time for such applications.)  The girl asked the coffee shop if she could start working as planned, and said that she would be OK with her salary being delayed until she had a personal number.  The upper executives refused, and said that she would need a personal number and a Swedish bank account before starting any work at all.  As she could not afford to go two months without working, she was forced to find a job elsewhere. The shop had to hire someone else.  This whole situation seems to me to be against the spirit of the free movement of labour in the EU/EEA.  First of all, the processing time of the Swedish Tax Administration is rather long. It is a very clear cut case, an EEA national with a work contract.  But also, this chain of coffee shops is de facto discriminating against EU/EEA workers. This eight-week processing time being a fact, many EU/EEA workers will be prevented from working there when such a wait time is imposed by a combination of public and corporate policy.  The issue here seems to be that the problem is caused by the combined policies of these two entities. However, did this girl have her EU freedom of movement rights violated? The company admitted that she was their preferred candidate for the job, nationality and red tape was the only obstacle.  Assume the girl also moves to the Swedish side of the border.  "
1320,Italy student visa question,"I'm going to apply soon for my student visa for Italy as I'm going to study for a Master's degree for 2 years  I have a question about 2 documents.  Proof of accomodation. My university won't publish the names of the people who can stay in the accomodation until late August, so what should I do? Book a hotel? And for how long?  Flight tickets. I've read on many sites that I also need to book a return ticket. When should the return ticket be, at the end of my studying period? "
1321,How does a foreign resident of the UK declare that she got married in her home country?,"My fiance and I recently got married in our home country (Egypt). She has been living and working in the UK for about a year now while I live in Germany. When she entered the UK, she was single.  Does she have to report to the authorities now that she got married? if yes, where should she go or what should she do?  Note that we are not interested in any sort of dependent visa for me, I am just asking about the procedure of declaring marriage in the UK, when the person in question is a foreigner who got married abroad. "
1322,Getting permanent residence in Germany under Beschv paragraph 4 Managers and Specialists,"I've got a national visa to Germany under Beschv 4 Managers and Specialists instead of the visa for Blue Card which I've applied for.  Am struggling now with two questions: 1) can I get standard Blue Card based on this visa ? 2) If not, what will be the difference in terms of a period required to stay in Germany to get a permanent residence ? Would it be a status which could allow me to work in other German and EU companies ? Could I bring my wife in Germany without a need for her to pass A1 exam in German ? Thank you in advance.  EDIT based on comments:  Thank you for clarification. The reason I've got paragraph 4 was actually a mismatch between my master diploma, stating I'm a physics engineer, while position in German company is called solution architect. So they said it doesn't match exactly. Salary is 80K+, so it's not an issue in this case.  So most probably I wouldn't be able to turn my current beschv 4 visa into Blue Card upon arrival, right ? "
1323,UK Family visas: can I apply as a parent if my baby is born in UK and partner is UK citizen?,"My partner (British) and I (Canadian) are currently living in the UK and just had a baby. I'm currently working on a Tier 2 (General) visa (I was sponsored by the company) but am strongly considering leaving for various reasons.  To greatly facilitate the job search process I'm considering applying for the ""Family visas (Apply as a parent) but I'd like to be 100% sure we'll meet all the criteria before applying.  ☑️ Child is under 18 and a British citizen ☑️ We are in a share parental responsibility and my partner is a British citizen ☑️ have a good knowledge of English  ☑️ I already have my Biometric residence permits ☑️ I meet the income requirements  Am I missing anything else? For those having applied before or knowing the process, how long does it takes to get the visa if approved? And finally can I apply for it despite currently being on another visa?  Thanks a lot for your help! "
1324,What are the advantages you get for having a visa sponsor for immigration to Canada?,"I'm from Iran and have a company sponsor a visa for me to work in Canada (Vancouver).  Since Canada and Iran don't have diplomatic relations, the responsibility for applicants in Iran lies with their mission to Turkey.   Do I need to visit the Embassy in Turkey in person to get my visa? If yes usually how long should I wait for an appointment?  Do I still need to pass an IELTS exam?   Is there any other possible benefit for having a visa sponsor other than you have a higher chance of acceptance? "

Am I eligible for one?  "
1326,Philippines work visa: is it up to the company to do the application or can I do it by myself?,"I'm from the EU and I'm planning to move to Manila and to find a job there.  As far as I understand, I need a job contract and then I need to apply for a 9(G) visa. I tried to do some research, but I'm still a bit confused about how to apply.  These are my questions:   Is it up to the company that offers me a job to take care of the visa application, or can I do that by myself? Do I need to be already in the Philippines in order to be able to apply for the visa or can I do it remotely?  "
1327,What's my status in Thailand after being fired?,"I was hired in June by a small English center here. The owner turned out to be totally corrupt, registering me at another school so she could avoid various fees and bribes, and lying to me about the nature of the job before I moved here.  We clashed over these things and because of her very rude, bullying manner. She fired me recently and told me she'll cancel my work permit in a month; that I have to go to Immigration with various documents to cancel my non-Immigrant B visa; and that I have to leave the country as soon as that work permit is invalidated.  However, my non-immigrant B visa is valid till the end of September. Can I stay here until then without risk while I seek another job? What if I don't go to Immigration to cancel that visa? And what are the most effective ways to report and bring to justice this criminal?  Thanks for your advice. "
1328,Overstaying 90 days while waiting for the NIE in Spain,"Please help! I’m an Australian citizen. I came to Spain and have applied for the NIE. I'm still waiting for the decision from the immigration office. My 90-day stay expires before I get my NIE approved, and as far as I understand, it will be no problem to stay in Spain even after the 90 days expired. But what happens after I get my NIE? I will need to go to Portugal and I’m worried that the 90-day limit in the Schengen zone will be no longer available. Do I need to apply for a visa to go to Portugal, or am I allowed to travel around the EU with my Spanish NIE? "
1329,Pros and cons of working in Singapore as a US Green Card holder vs US citizen,"I am a Malaysian currently living and working in the US with a green card issued in 2016. I am thinking of relocating to Singapore and finding a job there. What are the pros and cons being a US green card holder working there (in terms of taxes, foreign income exclusion, tax credit, double taxation, etc)? Or would it be better for me to apply for US citizenship first prior to relocating to Singapore?  Hopefully someone in a similar situation would be able to share some experience. Thank you very much!     Thank you for your replies! Yes, I understand that it would depend on me but I was just curious about the taxation part being a green card holder or US citizen in terms of double taxation. If everything goes well, it would be a permanent relocation, at that point I would have to determine whether to relinquish my permanent residency and address the taxation concerns that arises from that for that year (perhaps?). Either way, I will still be subject to U.S. income tax but may qualify for certain foreign earned income exclusion/tax credits - which I had questions about earlier.      Anyway, below are some references I found below...      [website]     [website]     [website]     Most likely I will apply for my US citizenship before relocating to Singapore. Thank you once again.

1330,Marriage in Germany between EU and non-EU citizen,"My girlfriend (coming from Iran) and I (male, coming from Spain) are living and studying in Germany. She has been in Germany for more than 6 years with a study visa. We want to get married. These documents are required:   Passport Proof of residence valid for 3 weeks Ehefähigkeitszeugnis   She is waiting for the renewal of her student visa. However the passport hasn't expired. Would it be a problem? Should we wait until she receives a visa extension? Should she apply for another visa?  What is considered a valid proof of residence?  Is an Ehefähigkeitszeugnis issued by the German administration, or should we apply for it in our respective embassies? "
1331,I'm applying for a study permit in Canada at the port of entry. What country do I list as the country where I'm applying?,"I'm a US citizen applying for a study permit in Canada at the port of entry, when I arrive in Canada. The application, which I am completing ahead of time, asks for the ""country or territory where applying,"" as well as my status in that country and ""from"" and ""to"" dates.  Should I indicate that I am applying from the U.S. or Canada?  Second, if I indicate I am applying from Canada, what should I indicate as my current status (visitor, student, or other)? And what should I list in the ""from"" and ""to"" dates? Would this be the length of time I intend to remain in Canada? "
1332,Acquiring Dutch citizenship or residency as the spouse of a Dutch citizen,"My husband's parents were both Dutch citizens who immigrated to SA in 1951 and 1952. They never gave up Dutch citizenship, so my husband, who was born in SA and has always lived and worked in SA, has had dual citizenship, Dutch/SA, for many years, and so have our two children.  Our son is working in the Netherlands now and our daughter is busy applying to work there, so we might also consider living in the Netherlands. Is it possible for me to get Dutch citizenship as a spouse? If so, how do I go about getting it? We got married in 1980, 38 years ago. "
1333,Transitioning Australian visa from 458 to working holiday,"I will be lodging a visa application to transition from 458 to working holiday (417) visa in September this year. I've already booked my flight and going to lodge my application as soon as I arrive in my home country.  What I know and have done:   I am still in Australia Fully understood the intention of the visa and its restrictions, most notably 6 months per employer Visa length Work rights and study rights Arranged health examinations upfront Created a draft form just to get a feeling of how the visa lodgement work   Few questions:   Can you still lodge 417 working holidays application before your 458 has expired? I will be back home on the 1st of September and I am going to apply for the visa upon the arrival. But my current 458 will still be alive until the following 7th. How long does Working Holiday visa process normally take? I've applied for a holiday for one month at my current job and I wish to come back on time  "
1334,UK visit visa 2 years from Egypt,"I am planning to apply for the visit visa for the second time. It was issued for me once before for 6 months, and I have travelled twice with the same visa and returned on time.  This time I want to submit for a 2-year visit visa from Egypt to visit my British husband. We have been together since 2012 in Egypt and he first travelled to the UK on September 2017 and stayed there.  He got a job recently earning £15000 annually (that’s why I don’t qualify for a spouse visa) and I am currently working in my home country in a multinational company with a fixed contract and medical cover worldwide.  I will submit:   my pay slips for the last 6 months; my 6-month bank statement; his tenancy agreement. my HR letter; an invitation letter; his job offer; his passport; my credit card; medical cover; our marriage certificate.   Are there any missing documents? Will they approve this visit visa? Are there any documents especially required for the 2-year visit visa?  I will travel to my meet with my husband and his family in the UK. His father and mother are based in Egypt (although his mother is Egyptian and his father is British), so I will submit their flight tickets.  I need to travel:   in October for a ten-day family gathering: my husband, his parents, and his brother will be there; in March for 15 days for our anniversary; to visit my husband frequently.   My family lives in Egypt and I have a job in a multinational company so those are the ties mentioned. "
1335,Can I apply for a family visit visa to stay with my husband in the UK before applying for a spouse visa?,"I am a Tunisian and my husband is British. We have been living in Tunis since we got married in July 2017. My husband has been offered a job in the UK (one-year contract) and I plan on applying for a spouse visa to join him. We fulfill the financial requirement for a spousal visa. However, the spouse visa process takes a long time and there are still documents we will need from the UK/we need to let an apartment. We would really like to not be apart for an extended period of time and so we are wondering whether it is OK for me to apply for a 6 month family visit visa. We have a few questions about this:  Can I apply for a visit visa and then apply to change it to a spouse visa from the UK or will I have to come back to Tunis to apply and wait for the decision?  We've read that they are likely to reject a family visit visa application if I state that I intend to stay for the whole 6 months period on the grounds that I don't have ""strong ties"" to return home (I would have to quit my job in Tunis). Would it be better for me to stay for a month or two at a time then come back to Tunis for some time or does it not make a difference?  Also, we are worried that taking this course of action and staying for 6 months on a visit visa (or worse, being rejected one) may adversely affect my future spouse visa application.  Grateful for any advice! "
1336,My passport has expired and I forgot about it. What about my EU Blue Card?,"I currently live in Germany, working under a blue card. My situation is this:  Under my blue card is written:     19A AUFENTHG IVM 2ABS 1 NR 2A BESCHV   SIEHE ZUSATBLATT PASS-NR XXXXX   GULTIG BIS 23.06.2018   KARTEBNUTZUNG BIS 23.06.2018   My passport expired on 23.06.2018 and apparently my blue card too. I honestly forgot about that, in my head my passport was valid until 2019.  What are the risks here? I'm going to request a new passport tomorrow, which will arrive August 15. Am I in an illegal situation? I have an appointment for the Ausländerbehörde and plan to go there once I have my passport.  Can I travel outside Germany even with this blue card situation?  Can I continue to work under that? I'm also switching companies right now and I'm not sure about the legal implications. "
1337,J1 visa for PhD refused twice. Can I still reapply?,I want to reapply for a J1 visa for my PhD after two rejections with no reason given. I have funding plus a signed bond with home government for five year compulsory service and everything. I want to give it another shot as my classes will begin soon.  Can I apply from another consular station in my country as my current one has a long waiting list for appointments? I read somewhere that one has to apply from the same post or is there any flexibility in that? I could get an early interview date from the other station. 
1338,Switzerland: Private path to university if they fail to access Gymnasium,"It is my understanding that children at 15 are offered access to Gymnasium/Liceo based on their performance of the previous two years. So anyone who fails that will be barred from uni, or at least have a far more difficult path ahead of them.  For an expat child who is doing extremely well in his country of origin, coming into the country one or two years before that date it might be that they are excluded from higher education just because they didn't have enough time to settle in their new country.  Would children in that situation be allowed to study in a private school and do their four years of Gymnasium there? Would the schools generaly have free spots for those kids?  We might be transfering to canton Ticino (Lugano specifically) if that makes any difference. "
1339,What restrictions do I have with regards to working in Japan?,"I have a 5-year Japanese working visa (engineer) and I'm currently working for a Japanese company. I'd like to know what restrictions there are on what work I can do here, but I can't find any sources on what my visa actually allows me to do (Googling anything to do with 'Japan' and 'working visa' just brings up hundreds of results about how to get a visa).  I'm aware that I am restricted to working within my field (engineering) but would it be legal to take remote work from a foreign company? Or what about starting my own business? I assume either of the above would make it difficult to get a renewal once the 5 years on my visa are up, but how about until then?  Could someone perhaps point me to a source where I can find this information? "
1340,How do I bring my car from the UK when moving to Ireland?,"I am moving to Ireland under freedom of movement of labour rules for work. I am a British citizen. I will be bringing my UK registered car. It is taxed and insured in the UK at the moment. It's about 10 years old and it's been in my family the whole time, although I only had registered ownership transferred back to myself this month. To be clear there was no financial transaction, just a change of registered keeper and I was previously insured to drive it.  UK cars can simply drive in to Ireland, either over the land border or via the ferry from Wales. But since I will be living in Ireland permanently, I presumably need to re-register the car in Ireland eventually.  The government web site is a bit confusing on this issue. How long can I go on UK plates and insurance? Presumably I eventually need to re-register the car as Irish and get new number plates for it, as well as new insurance, so how do I go about doing that and what issues might I encounter?  To be clear as to the question, I am looking for an explanation of the rules and the procedure I need to follow. An indication of costs would be helpful too. "
1341,French authorities refused to give a carte de séjour to my spouse,"Where and how can I legally challenge this issue:  Short version: after 12 months and 4 appointments the French authorities refused to give a carte de séjour to my spouse. I am an EU citizen, working in France as a research fellow (post-doc fellow) in a big university. My spouse is a non-EU citizen. According to EU regulations:   To obtain a residence card, they will need:   a valid passport  your registration certificate as an EU national or any other proof of your residence in the country  proof of the family relationship with you (such as a marriage or birth certificate)   The authorities should make their decision to issue a residence card or not within 6 months.   Longer version:    During the first appointment with French authorities, they took all the documents, checked, took fingerprints etc, gave a temporary residence card with a duration of 6 months and gave us another appointment for after 6 months (at the préfecture de police) together with a récépissé allowing us to wait unil the issue of the actual card. We went after 6 months and they asked again for all the documents. We said that no one  told us to bring again all the documents with us, and they gave us another appointment, 3 months after. We went to the third appointment armed with all documents (the same as with the first appointment). They checked and said that the documents are not enough. They asked for (1) proof of health insurance for both me and my spouse, (2) apartment/rental insurance, and (3) bank statements of our savings and gave us a new appointment 3 months after (so, 12 months after the original appointment). When I protested that is illegal to ask for the extra 3 documents they replied ""that's your problem, not ours"". Anyway, we went on the fourth appointment with all documents (certified again, since they need the documents to be no older than 3 months) and the worker finally told that our file was complete and that my spouse should get a carte de séjour. However, there is nothing that he can do because his boss (the head of the agency) decided not to give us on the grounds that I am a *student*. I said I am a PostDoc and she replied ""irrelevant"". I asked how this is relevant and she went away. They gave us an appointment again in 3 months (so, in total, 15 months after the first one) to bring again the same documents and see then what can happen. We did not attend the last appointment as we have relocated elsewhere (I applied for and got another academic position in another EU country that gave my spouse the residence card within 30 minutes). I made a case on SOLVIT (online EU complain platform). They answered within 6 months with a historical account of the process that was completely inaccurate in many places (to put it politely). They did not offer apologies, not even acknowledging the fact that according to EU regulations, all these are illegal. They said than we should get the carte de sejour on our next appointment.  I replied with a point-by-point rebuttal together with evidence on all the inaccuracies and I informed that that I want to take the legal road to resolve the issue. I got a reply that the French authorities do not want to pursue the matter further and the case is closed.     How can I make a legal case against this obvious case of misuse of power and ignoring the straightforward EU regulations? Is there any way to sue this particular agency and ask for compensation (we had to relocate because of that)? Is there anything else that can be done to avoid this unnecessary (the regulations are pretty clear) situation? "
1342,Registration in Russia during 2 year study stay,"I (German citizen) will study in Russia for 2 years. Is there a registration in a governmental office (e.g. embassy, police office, ..) required after entering the country with a study visa? Also, what documents are necessary (possibly copy of the rental agreement)? "
1343,NJ driving license with expired UK license and French passport,"I live in New Jersey, I have a Green Card, a French passport, and an expired UK driver license. (I lived there for many years.) I was initially told by the local DMV  that all I needed to get a NJ license was to pass the knowledge test. I just did today, and another employee told me that because my UK license has expired I am not allowed to drive without another adult present for the next 3 months AND I need to take the road test. I live in the suburbs with kids, just got a job I need to drive to, and this would really wreck my life. Every employee gives me a different answer. So -- is there ANY WAY I can get a basic US license without all the supervised driving and road test ringmarole? Could I renew my UK license without a UK passport, and if so would it solve the problem? Loads of thanks. "
1344,Processing Times for Application to Settle in the UK?,"What are the typical processing times for an application to settle in the UK?  I'm specifically interested in applications made by post from within the UK.  For most types of visas, UKVI gives helpful information such as the percent of applications decided within 30, 60, and 90 days.  But for applications to settle from within the UK, the only information they give is a service promise of 6 months.  A freedom of information request a few years ago resulted in them disclosing a median processing time of 37 calendar days, and an average time of 47 calendar days.  However, the visa regime has changed significantly since then.  A more recent similar request was not successful.  Does anyone have any knowledge of actual processing times? "
1345,"Working for an English company , moving to Italy as home based. What's the best way to avoid too many taxes?",   becoming an italian consultant (independent contractor) i.e. invoicing the UK company monthly in order to pay taxes in Italy only.      keeping the contract in UK as employee and pay double taxes. If so how to proceed with that considering the Brexit? who to refer to to apply for the double taxation?  
1346,Can I accept a job offer in the UK if I am a non-eu spouse (US Citizen) married to an EU Citizen?,I am a US Citizen currently living in the EU with my EU Citizen wife but may have a job offer in the UK. Is it possible to accept that job offer if I am not currently living in the UK with a UK Residence permit? From my understanding it would not be a problem for me to work in the UK if my wife received a job offer or was a job seeker living in the UK. Is it possible for me to accept that job offer and if so what would the process be? 
1347,Can the Tier 2 General Visa sponsor employer force me to stay and work with them during the contract period?,Can my Tier 2 General Visa sponsor employer force me to stay and work with them during the contract period?    Is there any penalty for me if I switch my employer under the same category before the contract ends?    Can I switch employers whenever I want?  What's the cooling off period? Does that affect me if I want to switch employers during the first 12-month of my tier 2 general visa? 
1348,Moving to UK under Tier 2 General Visa – Can I switch employers easily?,"Since I'll be moving there on a work visa, what happens in the event that I get a better job offer from a different company than I work for? Can I just submit my notice, serve the notice period and then quit and go work for another company? Should I stay with the employer for a specific period of time before I can switch employers?   I ask this because I currently live in Qatar. The employers actively restrict them from quitting and working elsewhere. If one jumps jobs, it is a crime punishable by immediate deportation. What's the law in UK? Can the employers force penalties in case the workforce wants to leave? "
1349,Question about family permit for non EU spouse and son,"I am a Portuguese citizen through descent. My son is also registered as a EU national. We stay in Goa as I am a computer teacher. I will be shifting to UK in December. I wish to travel with my son and wife. My wife though is from Goa, India. She is an Indian national. Can she get residency in UK as she has to look after my son when I work. Do I apply for family permit and take her with me ?? Or do I have to stay in UK for the initial right of residency and then apply after I'm a 'qualified' person... "
1350,UK Spouse Visa Accommodation requirement,"I would like to use this opportunity to thank the moderators and contributors of this forum. You guys are doing a wonderful job.  I have a question regarding accommodation requirement for UK Spouse Visa. All the other requirements have been met.  I'm the applicant. I live abroad. My wife has ILR and daughter has British citizenship and they are both resident in the UK. They presently live in a 2 bedroom and 1 living room apartment with my Father-in-law. We are scared of a refusal. So we want to rent a 2bedroom apartment.   Here is the problem: Is it acceptable to use this newly rented apartment to meet the accommodation requirement by providing only Tenancy agreement and letter from landlord with permission for me to live in the apartment? It is a newly rented apartment. So no utility bills. And we don't want to wait until we have utility bills for the apartment. Also, is a property inspection necessary for this apartment, given that it would be occupied by only my wife and daughter?  Thank you. "
1351,What does the optional UK residence permit for EU/EFTA nationals look like?,"A friend of mine, a Swedish national, is moving to London, and has decided to apply for an optional residence permit, info about which is found here [website]My question is: what form does it actually take? Is it a visa-type sticker in the passport, an A4 paper sheet, or something else?  If it's a sticker, how is it issued if you apply for it on the basis of an ID Card, rather than a passport? "
1352,UK Residence and Healthcare,"I am an italian citizen. I am going to live in England for three years to study (the university will pay be a substantial amount of money), and for personal reasons I would like to be a resident there during this period.  a) Do I automatically obtain the residence in UK, do I have to compile a certificate, or what?  b) About healthcare, how does it work? I am sure italian healthcare will not provide for me in those years and that my EHIC italian card will stop being valid, and I am sure the university guarantees me basic healthcare on UK soil. But do I get a european healthcare (say for example I travel to Germany), do I get an english EHIC card?  Reason for the question: I asked three different offices and received three different answers, so I would like someone well informed or someone who directly experienced that to answer. "
1353,Buy/Register car in Mexico,"We are moving to Mexico soon from NZ (have temporary resident visa - Residencia Temporal) and are trying to determine the best way to acquire a car for use primarily in Mexico (occasional use in USA).  I have been struggling to find whether we must have a Mexican driver license in order to buy or register a car in Mexico.  Some people have told us we do, some have told us we don't.  We will be living in Baja California if that makes any difference.    If we can't buy a car in Mexico until we have a Mexican license we will have to look at whether we can buy one in California and then bring that across the border, although I guess we'll run into difficulty with regards to insurance and possibly registration of the vehicle in California.  So my question is, is it possible (legal) to buy a car in Mexico without a Mexico license?  Or register a US bought car in Mexico? "
1354,From Australia to America driver's license transfer,"I'm aware of ""reciprocity agreements"" some states of America have with other countries. I wish to move to America, but not to go through the hell of getting a license again.  In Australia: All of my search results are for coming to Australia from America, but I want to do the opposite. What states of America will allow a transfer of driver's license (Probably through a reciprocity agreement) from Australia?  I'm going to Washington, Seattle, but based on dol.wa.gov/driverslicense/moving.html I'd have to do all of the tests again, which is why I'm asking about other states (So I can move to them temporarilly, get a licence, and move back to Washington. The nearest state to Washington which will allow what I need would be the best option).  With an account problem and my low reputation, I couldn't directly comment to the answers, so did so via edits here:  @Dorothy (2016-09-03 16:48:06) I thought about British Columbia, but it's a part of Canada, not America. I would have to go through visa/green card stuff and everything else twice. It'd be ideal to move to a different country once (America) and between its states to do what's needed. British Columbia would be my last option, if I can't find any others inside America.  @Dennis (2016-09-03 19:00:55) I couldn't find the information you were talking about on the page you linked to, it was only listing other states of America which they'll transfer from, not other countries. Maybe I missed it. Will Virginia really allow a transfer from Australia?  @jpakotal (2016.09.10 12:55:55) and @Dorothy (2016.09.11 02:23:53) I had to go through years of hell for my licence the first time, so I don't want to throw all of that out by having to restart the physical test (They kept lying about the physical tests, so they could fail me, and I'd have to pay more. I had to make legal action, which I won, so they'd stop that). I'd be okay if I have to redo the mental test again, to transfer my licence, but not the physical test (As I don't trust what happened won't happen again).  @Dennis (2016-09-10 22:21:14) From what I'm reading on the page you linked: I only need to have residence in America generally, not Washington DC specifically, so simply being in Seattle, as I will be, would be enough (If I'm right). It's exactly what I need, but nearer options would be better (If I have to temporarily move to one of them, this is okay too). "
1355,Moving household stuff from Bangalore(India) to Nepal(Chitwan district),"What would be the best way to move household stuff from Bangalore to Nepal? Household stuff includes six medium steel boxes, television, refrigerator and 3 sets of roof fans. My father was working in the Indian army (Gurkha regiment) and now he would like to settle in Nepal.  I want to know especially about customs rules as well as shipping options for moving these electronic items from India to Nepal.  I am planning to load everything on the same train in which we will be travelling and after reaching Gorakhpur (Uttar Pradesh) we are not sure what to do further.  Are there other ways like hiring packers and movers which can directly deliver the stuff to Nepal? "
1356,Is Visa D-Mult in Austria renewable? or possible to apply new one while I am inside Austria?,"I am in Austria on a Visa D multiple entry, which expires next month. I am a Philippine passport holder, and was in Canada when I applied for the visa. I have not yet completed my German course and want to remain in the country to continue it.   Am I able to extend the Visa D while I'm here in Austria? Or do I have to  leave Austria and make an application from the Philippines? I just ask this since I am here already in Austria and I don't want to go back to my home country just to apply again for a new visa. It's not practical. "
1357,I have EAD - does it mean that I can work in US?,"I'm currently on H1-B visa and I'm in the middle of EB-2 process. I just got my EAD card by USPS.   I know that it is valid only as long as I am employed at my current employer. However if I perform any work (paid or non-paid) which does not violate any other rule (non-competing agreements, NDAs etc.) do I violate any US immigration rules? If yes, what is this card for?  PS. I'm generally interested in various volunteering efforts which might have be deemed ""work"" in eyes of USCIS. "
1358,I accidentally submitted an unsigned Tier 4 Visa Application. What should I do?,"I had two applications and only one was signed. I submitted the unsigned visa application.  I am already on purchased priority service processing. It has been two days since my passport was submitted to UKVI. (5-10 working days guaranteed decision).  What should I do?! I supplied a electronic signature during biometrics, along with all possible supporting documents.  Will my visa be rejected/refused? "
1359,Not having to surrender a German drivers license when getting a US license,"From what I learned, I can get a Pennsylvania driver’s license without further tests (besides) vision, given that I have a German license, due to a reciprocal agreement between Pennsylvania and Germany.  A lot of places on the internet say that I will have to surrender my German license. But I very confidentially recall reading that a recent change in legislation (possibly a federal law or court ruling) states that one may keep a foreign drivers license. Unfortunately, I cannot find where I read about this.  Can anyone confirm the existence of such a ruling? Also, can someone manage to find the actual text of the reciprocity agreement between Pennsylvania and Germany?  I'm on a J-1 visa, but not as a student, but Post-Doc. "
1360,Initial entry requirement for Australia PR Visa,"I was granted Australian permanent residence visa (189) this March. It has an initial entry date for October 2016. I landed Australia in March this year and stayed for 3 days and exited Australia. I am planning to move to Australia permanently in January next year (which is well past my initial entry date of October).  As there are no other conditions on my visa, Am I fine with it? Do I have to be in Australia on the day of ""first entry date""? Can anyone confirm me?  Any help would be appreciated. "
1361,Will I keep the French nationality after divorce?,"I was married with a French person for 7 years, and applied for French citizenship on the sixth year of our marriage - long after obtaining the legal right for application. However, we got divorced one month after I got the French citizenship.  According to the law, if you end your marriage within 12 months of acquiring citizenship, it is assumed that you presented your case for naturalization in a fraudulent manner. Does this apply to all cases, or each case shall be elaborated individually? Is there a way to keep my citizenship, since the marriage itself was not a fraud? "
1362,Getting married while on H1B Visa,I am on H1B visa and my Visa will expire on 09/2017 .  I am getting married soon but my fiance doesn't have passport yet.  What is the process to bring my wife ( of course after marriage :) ) to USA.     I can't find step by step process of this. Here is what I am guessing:    Apply for Passport :   Can she do this before getting married? Generally wife needs to change her last name after marriage. Will this be an issue?    Apply for Visa : Once we get the passport she will apply for H4 visa. ( H4 visa am I right here? ).  Can this process be initiated before marriage?   Flight Tickets : If all goes well and she gets the visa then get flight tickets. :)     Is this the correct process? Am I missing some step? 
1363,Commission vs Guarantee,"First of all, sorry for the silly question, I came from a third world country, undeveloped country, so we don't have all this. (Not just for this question, but for the other questions that I am planing to ask)  I am renting an apartment because I got a job contract, and I can see online there are two main words:  Commission and Guarantee  I read and I got the following:  Commission is what I should pay to the real estate because it helps me to fine the accommodation  Guarantee is what I pay to the owner of the accommodation so if I destroy the accommodation, but when the contract finishes, if I haven't destroyed the apartment, he will give me the guaranettee back, right? (Sometime I see Deposit, which I think is the same concept as Guarantee, right?)  Is it normal they are asking me for the cost of one month as a commission?  "
1364,Ban on travel to any commonwealth country,"How would I know that there is a ban on my travel to UK or any other country? Is there some means such as an endorsement in the passport or the like? I ask because my tier 2 visa recently got refused due to an invalid document. I'm guessing my agent gave incorrect details, but in my refusal it only states an invalid document. "
1365,Experience Reference Letter for ACS Skill Assessment (for 189 type Visa),"I am planning to apply for Australian PR and the 1st step I got to do is ""ACS Skill Assessment"" by uploading my PASSPORT, DEGREE CERTIFICATE and WORK EXPERIENCE LETTER. My question is regarding Work Experience Letter.  Total Experience                   :   6.8 years  Experience in Current company      : Past 2.8 years  Experience in 1st company          : 4 years  I just have my Experience Letter for my 1st Company which doesn't specify my roles and responsibilities.   Q1 :  Should it be a problem? If so, then what needs to be done? I cant get it anyway.  Q2 :  If I submitted all the docs, and further clarification or any docs needed from me, whether ACS will intimate me to get it?  Expecting a reply. "

How would one go about constructing a thorough budget? What are unexpected expenses that typically crop up? "
1367,Change in law? EU students and driving cars in the UK,"I will take up studies in the UK this fall. Everything I have read about using a car a couple of months ago suited me very well. I was certain that according to the following website, I could use a car with foreign number plates for up to twelve months as a student.  [website]Now I just checked back some days ago and the text must have been changed. More precisely I am pretty sure the sentence went like this before      You might be able to use a vehicle with foreign number plates for   longer than 6 months if one of the following apply:   And now goes like this     You might be able to use a vehicle with foreign number plates for   longer than 6 months if all of the following apply:   Now, one would need to fulfill THREE criteria in order to be able to drive with foreign number plates for more than six months.  These would be   you normally live outside the EU you’re in the UK for a set period as a student or worker you claim relief from VAT and duty   Then again, the website of the EU states something entirely different, namely that EU students that go on to study in the UK do not have to register at all and don't worry about anything for the duration of their studies. [website]Does anyone know what the currently applied procedure is? And how would you proof this when stopped by the police in the UK?      Lastly, as a follow up question in case I have actually to change plates after 6 months: What would be the procedure and costs? I don't really find my way through the jungle of english bureaucracy.. "
1368,Will I be able to enter other country again?,"I'm from Venezuela and currently i'm looking forward to study abroad (it could be either Spain or USA) however  I'm really really scared because last year i had a pretty big problem at immigration on Lisbon's airport. I was traveling to Spain and I was going to stay at a friend's house however she never said anything to me about issuing me the invitation letter and I thinking that she had to paid for this letter, didn't think it was worth the inconvenience, therefore i brought a 7 day reservation to an hotel(i was staying in spain for two months). Anyway i entered Europe through Portugal, there they asked me how much money I was bringing to my vacation, and apparently the money that i had wasn't enough.  They interrogated me for HOURS asking me all kinds of questions, asking me to describe the places where i was going to travel while I was in Europe, what were my parent's profession, etc, etc. At the end, they told me that they were going to return me to my country because what i said didn't make sense. At that point, I told them that I was going to stay at my friend's house but i didn't have an invitation letter. They contacted my friend, she sent her documents and they let me go to Spain normally. At the end, I was never denied entry to Europe.  However, I know that what happened had to stay in my passport's record and now that i'm planning to possibly study in Spain I'm really scared that they deny me the visa because of the incident. What can I do? Do you guys have any similar experiences? Can this influence in my application to a student's visa either to Spain or the US? Should I contact the immigration at the Lisbon airport and ask them whether what happened can influence my entry to other countries?   "
1369,Query regarding I-94,"I last entered the US in January 2016. The H1-B visa I had stamped in my passport was expiring in December 2016 and my passport is going to expire in third week of August 2017. After that, when my H1-B visa was about to expire (before December 2016), my employer filed H1-B visa extension for me and we got that approved before my previous H1-B visa expired. New I-797 (H-1B visa approval notice) also has I-94 on the bottom half page on page 1. That has got 'expiry date' of May 2018.   Now, when I checked my electronically generated I-94 recently, it has the 'Admit until date' of August 2017, which matches with my passport expiration date. I have renewed my passport and now I have new passport with me, which is valid till 2027.   Which is my current I-94 and the current Admit until date (one on electronically generated I-94 from CBP or the one on bottom half of I-797 received from USCIS)? Will I be out of status after 'Admit until date' on electronic I-94?   Please let me know.  Thanks in advance! "
1370,"Could one renounce one's native citizenship in order to prevent a second, naturalized citizenship from being revoked?","Before I start, I want to say that I am asking this out of pure curiosity and interest. I am not in this situation, and I do not know anyone in this situation.  I read that the Norwegian Directorate of Immigration can revoke previously issued citizenships (in some extreme cases). It turns out that Norway is not the only country that can do this. Other nations may also revoke the citizenships of naturalized citizens, for example the US, Canada and Finland. I am sure there are others as well.  Now, this got me thinking. I know that having a citizenship is a human right, so that leads me to assume that only dual nationals can have one of their citizenships revoked. Otherwise, revocation would render the person stateless.  So, let's say someone was under investigation for something serious enough to potentially lose them their naturalized citizenship. Could they then hurry up and renounce their native citizenship? This would then leave them with only one citizenship, the naturalized one. I figure that would make it impossible for the government to revoke it, because it would render them stateless, making revocation a violation of international human rights law. Is that correct?  Related (Law SE): Could one become stateless by first renouncing one's native citizenship, and then having one's naturalization revoked? "
1371,If a person has only one citizenship can they renounce it? What will happen after that?,Just curious. If a person has only one citizenship can they renounce it? How? Is it even possible and what are the consequences? 
1372,How do I import a vehicle from outside the EU to the UK?,"Do I need to de-register my motorcycle in my home country, outside the EU, before I can bring it to the UK, register it, and get a UK number plate?

1373,Strategies to find an house/apartment in Germany for expats,"I need to rent a house in Seligenstadt (close to Darmstadt), the cheaper the better.  How can I go about finding one as I don't know the country at all? What are the most popular websites for rentals in Germany? Are there any that are particularly English-language friendly? And what about other pitfalls expats should be aware of when renting a flat in Germany?  I would also be interested in shared flats, if that's a possibility. "
1374,Odd jobs/Tutoring on a UK Tier 2,"I am currently on a Tier 2 Worker's Visa in the UK with a Certificate of Sponsorship from a university as a research fellow. I am basically doing research only, and I miss doing some tutoring and teaching.  What I would like to be able to do is some freelance tutoring on the side, just to keep my pedagogical skills up and make some extra spare cash. I have no idea if I can do this on my visa. Has anyone been in this situation? What kind of small side jobs and gigs can people do on a General Tier 2? I am talking about 1-5 hours a week. "
1375,Work and Study in Germany,"I am going to work and live in Germany in the next month as Software Engineer.  I will have a work permit.

If it is not possible to study and work at the same time, what are the options of extending my Studies in Germany? "
1376,My non-EU husband working and staying in Ireland?,I am an Irish citizen. I got married to non-EU citizen. We got marriage certificate done in Ukraine. We applied for joint visa (irish nat. spouse) and got a refusal due to not been employed 3 years prior to application. I am 18 years and it's my first time working.   Do I need to work and wait 3 years in order to have my husband with me in Ireland?  Is there a chance of him getting a short-stay visa and apply for residence card (eu1)?

1380,Will it be possible to get French citizenship?,"I was born in Tunisia. My great grandfather is French by birth. We have all of the papers to prove that. He got married in Tunisia and had kids, he didn't register his kids with the French consulate when they were born. So I assume that they don't recognize them as french.  Here is my question: we want to get a proof of citizenship for my grand mother since she is French by ""droit du sang"". Will it be possible? As I said we have all paperwork proving she is his daughter and to prove he is French? After that can my father get the citizenship as well or no? How long does the process take? Do we have to do it through the consulate? "
1381,US Income taxes for salary earned in the Netherlands,"I'm considering a job offer in the Netherlands. As a US Citizen, I would be eligible for the 30% ruling in the Netherlands, which reduces my tax burden there.  What I'm curious about is how this may affect any taxes I pay in the US.  I understand that as a US citizen I must file a US tax return, but that tax treaties will likely reduce or eliminate my tax burden in the US.  Realistically, as a US citizen working in the Netherlands, what will be my US tax burden?  0 or negligible? Will I be required to pay US income tax on the 30% of my salary that is not taxed in the Netherlands? Is it far more complicated than all this?  If it matters, I own no property or any other source of income in the USA.  I have a small IRA account, but that doesn't pay taxes until retirement anyway. "
1382,Travelling to UK and work,"I am a third-country national (citizen of a non-EU country) but I have a residence card of the Netherlands. My wife has a British passport. For the last two years, we have been living in the Netherlands.  Can I travel on my residence card alone to the UK, without my spouse? Or do I need a visa in my passport? We are planning to move to the UK from Amsterdam. Can I work there in the UK, or will there be some barriers to my working there? "
1383,Can you hold two working visas for two separate countries at once?,"I do not believe this is a duplicate, but if it is please just point me in the correct direction.  I currently hold a three year working visa for Germany and have recently received an offer to run some Christmas markets in London. Can I hold working visas in both Germany and the UK at once? I hold an American passport.  Furthermore, does anyone know if I need to already hold a work visa in the UK to receive a liqueur handlers permit? "

I am not allowed to live and work in Poland with her? Regarding for this I have got few questions your kind suggestion would be really helpful for us.   If we get married in Denmark will our marriage consider legal? She is from Poland and I am from India coming to Denmark on tourist visa could we able to get married there? And stay and look for work together. Which EU country would allow us to move in tougher after getting married in Denmark? Which EU country is good to getting married and allow us to live and look for work together?  
1389,Has anybody immigrating to France been asked a criminal record from their home country?,"I want to ask this question because my home country asks for the name of the institution to which it should be addressed, and it can take over six months to have it issued by the Ministry of the Interior (same as the Home Office) and then apostilled.  Has anybody been required to produce a criminal record? By whom? To what institution should it be addressed? "
1390,What is the simplest way for a Canadian to obtain EU citizenship?,"I have a Canadian citizenship and currently live in the UK with the YMS visa. I was wondering what is the simplest way to get a citizenship to be able to live/work in the EU. I'd like to move here permanently and start my own business in the tech industry, but everything I can find require me to be sponsored for the first 5 years.  Considering I'm from Canada, is there anything that makes it easier for citizen of the Commonwealth to get the UK citizenship? Also, since my ancestors (not close ancestors) were from France - how far can we go in our family tree to be eligible? "
1391,Refused entry to Spain previously. Will this affect my Student visa application?,"I am from Pakistan and applied for a Schengen tourist visa for Spain in 2013. The visa was rejected on the grounds the purpose of visit wasn’t clear and that they couldn’t determine whether I would return to my own country, plus that my funds weren’t enough for a visit of two weeks. I had all the documentation that one could think of, from the invitation letter from a local Spanish resident to the hotel booking, sufficient bank balance ($12,000 for two weeks) and much more. I appealed the decision instantly and provided them with the invitation letter and still got a refusal stating that my intentions of returning back to my country were not clear. Understandably, I was 23 at that time and I can comprehend their stereotyping process and what not.  Now I will be reapplying for a Student Schengen visa for my master's at a reputable university in Spain, for which I have a 30% scholarship.  Will my earlier rejection affect my Student visa?  My parents will be sponsoring my tuition and living costs. How can I make clear that I am only going for educational purposes and will return to my country?  I do not have dependents nor any immovable property in Pakistan. Although I can fork around a reasonable bank balance from my parents and on my own ([tex]30k. Would the chances still be lower? I can ask my current employer to make me a job offer when I have completed my masters. Any suggestions on how to further improve my chances?   Thank you! "
1392,Shipping my stuff to Europe- import taxes?,"I'm relocating to France soon from the U.S.  I have a lot of used but pretty expensive things (laptop, cameras) I want to ship over to my address in France. Do I have to pay import taxes? How does that work? I've shipped tons of stuff back to the U.S. before with no issue, but wanted to see if this would be a problem going the other way. "
1393,"Moving to the UK as self-employed, or other alternatives","My brother (extra-EEA) works in the UK and I would like to move to the UK as well. I am a freelance, self-employed and would continue my normal job remotely that would allow me to pay for the living expenses. What is the best way to do this given that I am an extra-EEA?   I was thinking to apply for a job online (reed.co.uk, gumtree jobs) that would sponsor me working in the UK - but this seems highly improbable given that I am not physically in the UK.  I have a university degree in foreign languages, and would also be available to get to the UK for a Masters provided that after that staying in the UK would be simpler.  I looked at the self-employment procedure and it looks like I would need to invest £50000 or more in the UK to come to the UK as an entrepreneur. Is there any alternative to this?  Any advice will be most appreciated. Thank you very much in advance. "
1394,Sending myself things from the US to Europe: how do import taxes work?,"I'm relocating to Europe soon and have some things I want sent from the US (one big box of stuff).  I called a relocation company, who said that since my primary residence is not changing, I have to pay import taxes and VAT on those goods (I believe the import tax is like 10% of the value of the goods, and the VAT amounts to 20% of the (declared value + freight cost + insurance)). Ok, that's fine, I'll bite the bullet and just do it.  So- how will I actually pay those duties? I'm using USPS to ship to a residential address in Ireland. Will the package arrive, or do I have to go someplace and pay duties before I can claim my package?  Should I keep anything else in mind when packing / sending my box from the US? (a relative is taking care of this for me) "
1395,Extending French rental contract for less than 1 year,"I'm renting a furnished apartment in France. The landlord wants to live in it himself next year, so he has given me 3 month notice to move out in November. He won't actually move in for another few months, but apparently, by French law, the landlord can only cancel the contract on its anniversary date! So this is a really stupid lose-lose situation: I have to move out sooner than I want, while he misses out on rent for several months.  Is there any way we can extend the contract for a few months or a sign a new contract for a few months? I know that regular rental contracts run for 12 months or 9 months for students (and I am a student), but surely people do rent for shorter periods somehow (legally)?  Alternatively, would it work if we renewed for another 12 months, but I preemptively gave him notice that I will leave in 3 months (or whatever)? According to [website]"

1399,Is Bitcoin a viable solution for remittances when working abroad?,"Because I work in several countries, I am sometimes paid in US dollars on my US account. Changing the money in Shekels and transferring it back to my account in Israel through the bank costs about $40 per transfer.  It has been suggested to me, that the best exchange rate, and cheapest, and quickest way to move money from the US to the Israeli account, is to buy and sell Bitcoins for the amount I need to transfer, online.  I have searched online, and found bitcoin websites that sell bitcoins in dollars, and sites that buy bitcoins for shekels. (and visa versa)  Is this method advisable? Are there any particular pitfalls in using Bitcoins? "

1402,"Are there alternatives to a cheque for ""caution"" (deposit) when renting as a new arrival in France?","I've been in France a few days now, and I'm looking to rent somewhere (hotels etc being a little expensive for the long term). Having spoken with a few agents, they all seem to want a Euro denominated cheque for the caution (deposit).   Now, the problem is that I don't have a French bank account, so I don't have a euro cheque book with which to write a caution cheque.  We've a good question on How to open bank account in France if I don't have address of residence yet, but sadly it doesn't have any simple answers on how to resolve the catch-22 that is opening a bank account without a permanent address, and without the chequebook to get one.  So, what I'm wondering is - are there any alternative ways of supplying the caution money other than a cheque, which is likely to be accepted? A cheque in another currency perhaps? (I have cheque books in GBP Sterling and USD Dollars for example). Euro bank transfer somewhere secure? Euro cash with appropriate receipts? Anything else? "
1403,"How to get a work permit for Moscow, Russia","I am an EU citizen and would like to work in Moscow, Russia.   I have been reading that in Russia, foreign citizens must obtain a work permit (aka working-visa) if they want to take up employment. On the other hand, I also heard that you do not need a work permit if you:   study or work in Russia during holidays, (does not apply to me) are acknowledged as a reporter or teacher in Russia, (does not apply to me) have been invited to work at an educational institute, (does not apply to me) certain other special categories. (don’t know, may apply to me)   This makes me ask two things:   Is “software developer” one of those “special categories“? If the answer to question 1 is ”no”, how can I get such a work permit for Moscow? Can I apply for it from my current location (Germany), or do I need to apply for it in Russia, or do I have to rely on my future employer to handle the work permit issue (somewhat like US employers can help obtaining such work-visas for the US)?  "
1404,How to track a US K-1 visa application once USCIS has approved the I-129F?,"I'm applying for a K-1 USA visa from the UK. I was wondering how to track it beyond the USCIS. I know it goes to the NVC then goes to my local consulate. Is there any way to know online where I can track it? The USCIS part had an online case status, however the other parts don't seem to.  I want to track when it is received by the NVC and leaves the NVC and arrives at the London US Embassy.  Does anyone have any ideas? "
1405,Is a permanent India - US migration as risky as I perceive it to be?,"I am currently working in a MNC, I can get a US based job on a L1B visa which is valid for 3 years. Once in the US I can apply for an H1B which is based on a lottery. The L1B may be extended by 2 years for a total of 5. If I don't get an H1B in this time I am forced to go back.  After spending 5 years on the L1B+H1B I can apply for a green card in EB2 (since I'll have more than 5 years experience by then). This will have a minimum waiting period of 10 years (in reality much more). During this waiting period I need to renew the H1B annually, risking a renewal rejection each time.  Additionally, US immigration may or may not allow me to enter the country every time I go home on vacation essentially meaning that I am required to stay in the US util I get my green card (or naturalization?).  Is it just me, or does an India -> US migration require a massive amount of luck in addition to everything else? There just seem to be too many points at which you can be rejected.  (This is assuming I work for a single company throughout) "
1406,"Applying for UK Tier 2 sponsored visa: If my employment ends, what are my options?","I am in the process of getting a Tier 2 (company sponsorship).

1407,Which visa for self-employed work in the UK?,"Which visa do I need to apply for to work self-employed in the UK, doing some consulting work for companies, on contract? I've done my research on the different visas available to work in the UK, and I'm not quite sure which one is the most appropriate considering a specific situation.  The actual situation:   I have Canadian citizenship; I'm under 25 years old; I'm looking into working as a software engineer (developer or system architect).   UK visas that seems to match this situation:   Tier 5 (Youth Mobility Scheme) visa - (but it doesn't seem to allow self-employment / contractual work) Tier 2 (General) visa - (but it looks like I need to be sponsored by a company and be a permanent employee) Tier 1 (General) visa - (doesn't seem available for new visa requests, only for extension or LTR visas)   Are they the only options available? Considering the details added to each visa, is the only option to work sponsored as a permanent employee instead of being self-employed? "
1408,"As a foreigner opening a first bank account in France, how long to get a cheque book?","Thanks to the answers in How to open bank account in France if I don't have address of residence yet, I think I now possess the required documents in order to open a French bank account. Yey!  As details in this question on deposits for renting, I'm still really after a euro cheque book, ideally quite soon...  So, as an EU national recently arrived in France, heading to a bank with (hopefully!) the right pile of documents, how long would it be until I have a cheque book in hand? And if it isn't a roughly standard time, are there banks noted for being quick or slow? "
1409,Health-care and immigration within the EU,"So to speak, let's suppose that I am leaving Southern Europe (Greece), for Eastern Europe (Hungary/Poland).  Could the government of the latter have access to my past medical history by law, taking into account that I currently have a strong disability status, due to unnecessary psychiatric intervention?  Or I may as well start a new life altogether outside the European Union? "
1410,Is there any advantage to getting EU driver's license recognized in US?,Allegedly having European driver's license recognized in US is a lengthy and complicated process. On the other hand getting new license at DMV is trivial.   Is there any practical advantage of the former? Will for example years of experience count toward insurance discount? 
1411,What additional paperwork do I need to complete after I become a US citizen?,"After I become a US citizen and I obtain my Certificate of Naturalization, are there any other processes that I need to complete? I have heard that I might need to go to the Social Security office, why? "
1412,Working for foreign employer between arrival on K-1 (fiance) visa and granting of employment authorisation (I-765),"I will shortly be relocating to the United States on a K-1 (fiance) visa and will most likely continue working with my current (Australian) employer. My salary will continue to be deposited into my Australian back account. My understanding is that I am not permitted to work in the United States until I receive employment authorisation (form I-765). Would this include working remotely for a foreign employer whilst being paid into a foreign account? If not, would there be any other regulations I might be breaking by doing so?    I've heard anecdotally that employment authorisation is granted quite quickly and as a matter of course (you can't apply for it until you've entered the country if I'm not mistaken), however a more concrete understanding of the timeframe to expect would be greatly appreciated.

1413,Am I allowed to get income from Google AdSense based on OPT authorization if my major is computer science?,"I am a recently graduated F-1 student in the US and I have already gotten approved post-completion OPT. My major was computer science.   I have 3 questions about Google AdSense income in the US. I have applied to AdSense and I got AdSense account, but I have not put any ad yet. It is because I am worried about whether I am allowed to get AdSense income in the US. (I applied for AdSense with US address.)   I am going to work in the US as a system engineer at a US company. In addition I also want to get income from AdSense.  I have 3 questions as follows:   1) Is AdSense related to my major, computer science?  It is said that OPT allows me to get job which is related to my major. I studied not only about computer but also web design in college. Web design was also included in the CS program.   2) Should I write article about Computer/IT for my website? If I write article about computer, it will not be illegal? On the other hand, if I write article which is not about computer/IT, it will be illegal?  3) With OPT status, is it allowed to get income from 2 or more US companies? I want to get income from both my regular employer and AdSense. "
1414,Can I keep my green card if I study abroad for a PhD?,"I'm a 30+-year-old engineer. I have been living in the US for 2 years and just got a green card (my employer is really nice).  I'm thinking of doing a PhD (a lifelong checkbox) and I started to apply everywhere, including in Europe. Ideally I would like to do my PhD there, keep the green card and work in the US after, but I wonder if anyone successfully did it?  I initially thought of coming back a week every year but I have read that this doesn't guarantee anything, and I have to prove that the returns were temporary and you still have ties with the US. Is a PhD temporary since it is ""fixed"" in length? "
1415,South Australian provisional driving licence to a US licence,"I have held my P1 (Provisional) Licence here in South Australia for 8 months now. I would like to visit the States and get a full licence there (Overseas Driving Permit is not an option for me) and then come back to Australia to transfer my American Licence to get my Full Open licence here.  I do not plan to actually drive in the States, just hold a licence.   I heard this was possible from a friend who works in the Department of Motor vehicle service office, and wanted to confirm before I plan a holiday overseas.  Is the process difficult to transfer my licence? Do I need to do testing? What paperwork is required? I do not care what state I have to go to, just whatever is easiest... "
1416,Cancelling non-immigrant B visa without going to Thailand,"I am from India. I applied for a non-immigrant B visa from VFS. It took 2 days and the visa was approved. The next day I got better opportunities (which will help me in my growth and carrier) from another country, and I don't want to go to Thailand now. Now, do I need to revoke the NON-B employment visa of Thailand, to work in another country?  If yes, then what would be the process of that and how much time does it take? And will it affect me to work in another country?  NOTE: I still didn't join the Thai company now and didn't go to Thailand using that visa. "
1417,Residence in the UK under new EEA regulations,"I'm a European who holds EU and UK passports, permanently living in the UK. I registered my marriage with a non-EU citizen in the UK a year ago.

1419,PhD in physics but freelance software dev. Chance of aus 189?,"My qualifications are in physics, however post PhD I only worked in physics for 6 months before moving into the world of software development.  It is pretty normal in the UK for software developers to come from (and be head hunted from) physics and maths backgrounds. But nevertheless my qualifications are obviously not directly ICT related.  Would I stand any chance in getting a positive assessment from ACS with a recognition of prior learning or otherwise? Or would it be a waste of time?  What about if I nominated my career as ""physicist"" or ""mathematician"" instead? I don't work in this field now and outside of education only have six months work experience in it, since I left for software. But would this potentially get me more points for the qualification at least if not the work experience?  "

1421,Can I join the Canadian Forces as a foreigner with a work visa?,"I want to join the Canadian Army. I applied for a work visa and received an answer saying that :     Votre demande pour travailler au Canada a été approuvée. Un permis de travail vous sera délivré à votre arrivée au Canada   Yet I read on Wikipedia that :     Canadian permanent residents are allowed to serve in the Canadian Forces (CF) as long as the Chief of the Defence Staff (CDS) decides it would not prejudice the national interest. It is likely that a requirement of CF membership will be to aim to become a Canadian citizen within four years of enrollment (subject to Citizenship and Immigration Canada's (CIC) processing timeframes). Following changes to the Citizenship Act in 2015, there is also now a fast-track citizenship scheme available to current and past CF members, as well as certain prospective members (negating the requirement to become a permanent resident first in the latter case).

1422,Expired permesso di soggiorno. I don't have a ricevuta,"Because of a serious emergency I had to go back to my home country. I was given an appointment for ricevuta in 5 months. So I had no choice. I went to my home country with an exired permesso di soggiorn. Now I only have an old permesso di soggiorno expired for almost a year, which is definitely older than the 60 days to apply for a re-entry visa.  Does anyone have an idea what I should do? Should I apply for a re-entry visa even if the soggiorno is expired for more than a year? "
1423,EEA Family Permit for US Citizen with prior coded landing,"I am an American woman in the process of gathering documents and filling in the Visa4UK form for the EEA family permit, to join my Italian husband who has been living and working fulltime in London for the last five years.   We met in London last summer while I was there on holiday, and married in Italy in July. I freelance and have a flexible schedule, so I was in and out of the UK for short holiday visits, one in March 2017 (1 week), one in April (10 days), one in June (3 weeks, when he and I first connected), one in August (one month, spending time with my then-boyfriend) and one from November-early December (staying with my then-boyfriend).   In January of this year while we were re-entering the UK from a month-long holiday in Italy, the IO flagged my entry and had me give her the account of all my visits over the last year. She said I was spending too much time outside of the US, and I got a coded landing stamp with (what looks to be) a circled ""W"" on it, and she verbally informed me she was giving me a warning. She asked me how long I was intending to stay in the UK (as I was honest and told her I didn't have a return ticket to the US), and I told her I was visiting my (then-boyfriend) and would probably be returning to the US in a month or so - but that I really didn't have fixed plans at the time. My entry stamp at that time said 'leave to enter for/until six months,' so (naively?) assuming it wasn't an issue I ended up staying three months, until April when I went to India for a month, and afterwards to Italy for two months. I saw my (then-fiance) in Italy over a few visits during that time, last during the week of our wedding. Since the end of July I have been back in the US with my family, while we've been getting all our documents and EEA family permit application in order.   From my research on this forum and others and in talking with friends who have been through this process recently, it's my understanding that as a non-visa citizen I should be able to forego the EEA family permit and enter the UK (alongside my husband), showing documents to substantiate our marriage and his QP status as a full-time employee in the UK. However, I'm concerned about the possibility that my entry situation in January could raise issues while we attempt to cross the border together.   I'm not sure if they have any grounds to deny me entry as we're married and he'd be exercising his treaty rights to bring me into the country? I did have to apply for a new passport as my previous one was almost full, so my passport number is now different and the coded landing stamp (obviously) isn't present in it. However, assuming that last warning could still pop up in the electronic records, I'm not sure if they could raise some issue about possible overstay on my previous visit?   It is definitely much easier to cross the border directly rather than apply for the EEA permit in advance, and it would be my preference to do that if possible. However, I'm trying to weigh the likelihood of some issue actually coming up and if it's overall safer to just go ahead with applying for the EEA permit to avoid any problems in advance. I am also going to have a consultation with an immigration lawyer on the same, but would appreciate any opinions, insights or advice!  Thanks so much! "
1424,Long-term stay in the UK,"I have been struggling to find concise answers and need to come to a decision regarding my travel.   To briefly summarize my situation, I have recently been hired by a company that has offices both in the US and in the UK. I am a US citizen and my girlfriend of over a year is attending university in the UK. Since I have recently finished university and started working, I would like to live with her in the UK while she completes the remainder of her degree.  I know that I am allowed to work in the UK since the company exists in both countries and I will be paid in USD. The company is also ok with me working remotely from the UK, especially since that will put me closer to the software development team.  Unfortunately, since I am so recently hired, I'm not allowed to begin the visa process for a work permit for 4 weeks.  Here are the concerns that I have:   Can I rent a flat or other accommodation with my girlfriend? Am I allowed to ""live"" in said flat while working remotely with the US branch? If I apply for a long-term visitor visa (2/5/10 years), must I leave every 6 months? If so, how long must I remain out of the UK before re-entry? Will staying in the UK on a visitor visa damage my chances when applying for a work permit? Can I transition from a visitor visa into a work permit?   I do not plan on staying in the UK permanently, only to spend time with my partner while she finishes school. Once she is done (1-2 years time), we will return to the US. During that time, I will need to rent. Hotels will be a financial impossibility for that amount of time.  Finally, to clarify:    I will be paid in US dollars, not in British Pounds. I will be working remotely as an employee of the US branch and act as liaison with other employees in the UK and neighboring European area. I will not be seeking permanent residency. I will return to the US after my girlfriend has completed her degree I would like to minimize time spent away from her.   I do not wish to anger the Home Office and risk being banned from the UK.   "
1425,Working rights for non-EU spouse,"I would really appreciate your assistance and any tips or resources that you may be aware of.  I was born in Ireland and moved to Australia at a young age. I am fortunate to hold dual citizenship with Australia and Ireland. My Australian husband of 10 years and I wish to pursue our dream of living in mainland Europe together.  I know that he would likely be able to get an Irish work permit as my spouse, but we are hoping to reside in France or Spain. As a pilot, he has some exciting opportunities with European airlines (for which he has all of the appropriate licences, and for which there is a demand at the moment).  However, I have found it difficult to find information about his ability to work in Europe if he does have an Irish spousal work permit or if this is required at all. I would not be working initially but we would have sufficient funds to support ourselves with savings and rent, health insurance etc. in Europe for at least a year.  Can he work in another EU country on an Irish spousal visa? Will he have working rights as my spouse if we move directly to France or Spain? Would he be able to apply for a work permit if I am not working?  If he is able to find work with an airline such as EasyJet, would he have issues flying in and out of EU countries on a spousal visa?  I would really appreciate any details or links. It is a big decision to make and went want to ensure a smooth transition as best we can. Thank you! "
1426,Can I work for a Canadian company while living in the UK?,"I'm a Canadian citizen going to the UK on a Tier 5 YMS visa in a few weeks. When I put my notice in, my boss surprised me by asking me if I'd be willing to work remotely for the company while I'm living in the UK. The company is under the impression that they could pay me as an hourly employee, take off deductions for Canadian taxes as they would normally do and deposit my pay into my Canadian bank account. The company does not have offices in the UK (or any other country).  But how does this work with UK taxes, then? I do not want to avoid taxes wherever they're due, and I know that Canada and the UK have a tax treaty so I shouldn't be double-taxed if I do my taxes right. If I'm working as an employee (not a contractor, not a freelancer) for my Canadian employer, do I have to register as self-employed in the UK to file taxes that way, or is this sort of thing simply not allowed?

The validity matched the valid of the passport. I renewed his passport but didn't transfer the indefinite to remain, assuming there is no expiry date, but it expired along with the passport. Now I have travelled to India with my son. What am I supposed to do? How do I travel back? "
1428,Can I apply for a work permit while on Schengen visa?,"Sorry if this question does sound redundant, but most posts I read are about applying to work while on a Schengen visa.  But my concern is, if I were to travel to Germany under a Schengen visa and somehow receive a job offer from an employer there, would I be allowed to apply for a work visa, Blue Card and residence permit? Or would the Ausländerbehorde (or Immigration, perhaps) ask me to go back to my country first and apply for a work visa there?  Additional info: I'm from the Philippines. "
1429,I’m in the US on a visitor visa. Can I now apply for a volunteer visa within the country?,I am a Canadian citizen who planned to stay four months traveling and surfing in the US. I am taking a one-year leave (sabbatical) from my full-time teaching position in Canada. I have met some incredible people this far and have been offered some incredible volunteer experience for a non-profit alternative outdoor school here in California.  I would love to do this for the next ten months before heading back to my position in Canada... Can I apply within the States? Is there a minimum amount of hours you need to volunteer per week? 
1430,Cost of Australian Expression of Interest?,"I am looking at different working visas for Australia and the current cost of a skilled working visa is quite expensive and timely with no guarantee that you will be given one.   I have been looking into the expression of interest and they will invite you to make a visa application if you are successful. However, I can't find any information on how much this costs?  Also, as a sub question:  Can you apply for other types of visas whilst waiting? For example, if you have found a job where someone will sponsor you? Or if you wanted to apply for a working holiday visa? "
1431,Paying taxes after AOS?,"I am currently in the US under a J1 and my home country has a tax treaty with the US. Therefore I am currently exempted from federal taxes and some other taxes.  I am getting married soon and want to apply for an Adjustment of Status. My question is, how does this affect my tax status for the current job (J1)? Will I have to pay taxes for whole salary I earned or is this still ""tax-free""? Is this different if I would apply for AOS at Jan 1st? When does the Tax exemption end?  Edit: Tax treaty Germany USA Article 20(1):        Remuneration that a professor or teacher who is a resident of a Contracting State and who is present in the other Contracting State for a period not exceeding two years for the purpose of carrying out advanced study or research or for teaching at an accredited university, college, school, or other educational institution, or a public research institution or other institution engaged in research for the public benefit, receives for such work shall be taxable only in the first-mentioned State.

1432,What do these Gymnasium subject abbreviations stand for?,"I'm an American who's relocated to Germany, along with my son.  He's in 6th grade at a Gymnasium now.

1433,Netherlands: is EUR 53000 salary enough for a family of 4?,"Is an annaul salary of EUR 53000 (before tax) sufficient for a family to live in Eindhoven area? It is a family of four with two school-going kids under 12.  Assuming the case of not getting the benefit of 30% ruling (or all foreign workers get it?), considering not a lavish but sort of frugal lifestyle, expenses like initial rental deposit, 2 bedroom house rental, transportation, utilities, school fees (I heard English schools are very expensive!), insurance, local govt/municipal taxes if any, and any other mandatory expenses, would there be anything left to save?  Given all that and if the job contract is for a year or so, is it okay to move the family or better stay alone? Thank you. "
1434,"American marrying an Italian in Italy, then move to London","I'm an Italian national and I live and work in London. I'm marrying my American fiancee in Italy at the beginning of next year, but after getting married we plan on setting roots in London.  My question is what's the best way to fly her out to Europe?  Since it's cheaper and a much easier to fly to London from the US, I thought the best solution would be to fly her to London, then stay there for a few days, then fly to Italy and finally get married.  At that point she'll apply for an EEA family permit and we'll fly together back to the UK.  Do you think this is ok to do?  I mean, once her passport is stamped at the UK border, she's basically free to travel everywhere in Europe for 6 months, but it is ok to fly to Italy get married? "

1436,How to find an apartment well in advance?,"I'm looking for an apartment to rent in Germany about four months from now - that is, starting January or February - as the period of notice on the current rental agreement is three months.  As it turns out, virtually all apartments available via familiar sites such as ImmoScout are offered for rental starting immediately, in October or perhaps November. I don't see how I could find an apartment so that I would be able to sign the new contract before cancelling the current agreement.  In my view, landlords will always prefer a tenant who would be able to move in immediately, so the apartment doesn't remain untenanted for too long, which puts me in a not so good position to negotiate.  I would like to move out of my current apartment ASAP as it's impossibly expensive for just one person (roommate moved out unexpectedly). Also, my job situation changed recently - it's quite a hassle commuting, so I'm looking for an apartment closer to work.   What can I do about this situation? Would it be wise to terminate the current contract in the hopes of finding a suitable offer eventually?  I suspect that winter season might have something to do with things - probably nobody likes moving on New Year's Eve, so hardly any apartments are available for January. Am I just forced to wait for another one or two months? "
1437,Doing freelance work in France--permission needed?,"I currently live in France and have a residence card (spouse of EU citizen) that mentions that I am allowed to work.  I am currently working part-time for an employer.  In addition to my current job, I want to do some occasional work through some of the usual freelancing websites.  In this situation, work is done for international clients (in practice none of them are likely to be French).  Interaction with clients, including payments, is handled by the website.  Do I need to do any paperwork to be able to do this?  Do I need special permission from the government or tax office, or obtain a special status (e.g. auto-entrepreneur)?  Or is it sufficient to declare this income at the usual time in May?  I am having difficulties finding this information because I do not speak much French (my job doesn't require it, nor does any of the freelance work I plan to do).  Since this would be a small amount of work and small income, I would prefer to keep things as simple as possible, and avoid going through bureaucracy as much as possible. "
1438,Got offered a job in the US as a B2 visa traveller,"Today I got a job offer, from a tiny startup in the US.  I would absolutely love to work with this company, and move over here. However, it's a tiny startup with no legal team. How difficult would it be for this company to sponsor my visa? How much would it cost them?  and what kind of visa would I need? (I'm a web developer), some college but no degree.  My current visa expires late November. With such a short time frame is it even possible to pursue this job?  I know that greencards are probably exhausted by now for sure. I think the h-2B visas start October. Would that be an option or would I even qualify?  I'm from Denmark.  I would really appreciate some help in this matter. "
1439,Obtaining another European nationality while living in France with a visa and a non-EU passport,"If a US citizen, living in France on a work visa (which is renewed annually), obtains the nationality of another European country on the basis of their ancestry, what effect (if any) will this have on their visa?  Ostensibly, their visa would be unchanged due to it being tied to their US passport (presumably the case for any non-European holding a visa). Is this correct?  Would they still be required to renew their visa, or would it be permissible to allow the visa to expire without renewal, since they would have the right of free movement? "
1440,Converting from Work visa to Spouse visa in the Netherlands,"I'm a U.S. Citizen current living in the Netherlands for the last year on a knowledgeable worker visa, with my wife who is a Spanish citizen.  I have just left my company, but would like to stay in the Netherlands.  What is the procedure to change my visa from a knowledgable worker visa, to a spouse-sponsored residence permit? The instructions here assume that I am out of the country during the application process. How is this process different while living in the country? "

Should I pay in advance for the whole year (indeed if I had that money, I would not be working abroad)  I know about the extra one month commision, but how many months in advance usually I should pay?

1446,Canadian Provincial Health Care for Working Holiday is 100% necessary?,"I am a Canadian citizen who has been out of the country (working in Japan) for the last three years. I wish to apply for the working holiday visa to France (visa 3D category), but am required to be covered by the provincial health care in addition to travel insurance for the duration of my stay in France. Since I have been out of the country for so long, my insurance has expired, and according to the health Ontario website, they won’t cover me out-of-country unless I stay in Canada for two years prior to my trip.   Has any Canadian been able to successfully go on any working holiday immediately after living for some time out of Canada? If I were to get comprehensive coverage from an insurance provider will the provincial coverage be negligible? Any advice from people with past experiences in this situation would be greatly appreciated.  "

1448,Can an EU national hold residence in two other EU countries?,"I know questions like this one have been asked before, but my question is specifically in regards to healthcare.  My wife is a Swedish citizen. She has also acquired permanent residency in the UK by having lived there for 10 years. She and I are moving to Berlin, and will be registering ourselves there, however we're also trying to get pregnant. For both legal and personal reasons, we would like to come back to the UK to give birth when the time comes.  My question is, when we go to Berlin, register our home and get health insurance, will that automatically unregister her with the local GP? Is there any reason (both practical or legal) she wouldn't be able to come back and use the healthcare system as if she never left?   Also, I don't think it matters, but assume we give birth before the UK leaves the EU. "
1449,Romanian documents after marriage in Germany,"I'm getting married with my fiancée, who is a Romanian girl. Since we live in Germany (I'm not German either - I'm Italian), we chose to marry under German law, therefore we also chose her to get my surname.  Since she will change her surname, she will need to reapply for each document she has (I guess by the consulate).   Does the Romanian consulate in Germany accept a marriage certificate in German (apparently they do, but that consulate is not famous to be very precise about the info they give)? Can she write her residency here in Germany on her ID? Do contracts and other documents made here in Germany automatically update, or do we need to notify every single entity?  "
1450,UK student visa refusal,"I was recently refused twice for a Tier 4 student visa. In the first application, my step-father had provided all the required documents for proof of money. However, our connection was doubted and, therefore, I had no proof of funds.  In the second, my mother had provided savings accounts as proof of funds; the university had looked through it all and provided me with a second CAS. Again, this was refused, on the grounds that apparently 6-8 of the accounts have already been used for another UK tier 4 visa. This makes no sense considering that this was my mother and the money was in savings account for my benefit. We did not use an agent and as far as my research shows, the bank is not on the list of untrusted banks.   I understand there can be an administrative review, but what are my chances of succeeding? If I were to apply again for next academic year, will my chances be hurt by these refusals? "
1451,Can I apply for residency permit in Finland on a Schengen Visa?,"Actually I'm a startup founder from Pakistan and my team will be joining an accelerator program in Finland this Fall, which is hardly 1.5 months.  Now the problem is that there is NO Finnish Embassy in Pakistan and consular matters are handled by the Dutch (Netherlands) Embassy, but it ONLY handles Schengen Visa (Short Term 90 Days) while we'll be staying for almost 4 months and possibly longer.  My research and Dutch embassy says that we'll have to apply for a residence permit from Finnish embassies in either the UAE, India, China, Nepal etc. all of which require us to apply for visas also (no visa free entry). Even if we manage to apply and get a visa in lets says a week or so, then still the residency permit application takes at least 3 MONTHS to process! By then our accelerator program will be past midway.  My research also said that one can apply for Residency in Finland itself in exceptional cases. Also that Residency Application in Finland are handled by Federal Immigration Department and NOT by embassies/consulates.  So my question is can we apply for a short-stay visa for Finland from the Dutch Embassy here and once we are in Finland apply for a Residency Permit? Is our case exceptional enough? FYI the final interview for the accelerator program was today, so there's no delay on our side, plus also there's no Finnish embassy in our country and applying elsewhere would not only cost us A LOT of money but also time which we don't have any.  I believe our case qualifies as an exceptional case, but I would like to hear your thoughts and if this is really possible?  Also we were in Finland exactly 1 month ago for a similar event for 5 days and another 3 days in France, this visa was issued by the local Dutch Embassy on behalf of Finland. But it was a 10 day single entry visa, so as we know the 90-days-in-180-days rule of EU, will those 10 days also count in the upcoming application? "
1452,Poland : work permit application by employer,"This is my first question here, don't know if it is off-topic and belongs to travel exchange.

I mean is it problematic for the company to obtain a work permit for a non-EU citizen?  "

I try find job in Germany as software developer. I have master degree as physicist. Does it make impossible getting bluecard because of education? Or years of work experience can compensate that my master degree don't sound like ""computer science""?  Can it help that at university we had a lot computer science disciplines because supposed that we should be able write software for processing results of our experiments? For example image processing, numerical methods, writing software for working with hardware such as oscilloscope.  For example IT disciplines from my both diplomas (bachelor and master):   ""Programming""    ""Operating systems and programming languages""    ""Software systems""    ""Network technologies""    ""Information Systems""    ""Computer technology in physics""     ""Computer simulation of processes in solids""    ""Multidimensional data analysis in physical condensed states""    ""Virtual instruments in physics""    ""The use of information technology in physical research""    ""Computational physics""    ""Numerical methods and mathematical modeling""    ""Radio Physics and Electronics""   Almost for all this disciplines we wrote software with C, Python, Pascal or in Matlab.

If i get only work permit, is my wife able to work in Germany? Can she have any problems with arrival and living in Germany? Or she can immediately arrive and live but without work permit? "
1464,Does a British citizen needs to work in the UK for applying spouse visa?,"I have married to a British citizen in December 2018. He left after 10 days and applied to work in Saudi Arabia. His plan was to apply for my spouse visa from Saudi Arabia rather than the UK because both government agencies need passports for the visa and he needs the job first.  Saudi government took his passport January and took ages to arrange a visa. Anyhow he got the visa at the end of the March and went to Saudi Arabia. He couldn't apply for my spouse or visit visa because he didn't get his Saudi National ID.  He got the Saudi ID before he left to the UK (summer holidays) in May. He arranged the appointment from the home officers. I guess they both told him you shouldn't apply because you don't work in the UK. For spouse visa you need to work in the UK. If I ask him to apply for visit visa he sometimes forgets to ask lawyers and sometime lawyer didn't reply back. I don't understand what is wrong, is he deliberately delaying things or  Q1: Is it really a rule of the UK government that you need to work in the UK if you apply for the spouse visa?  Q2: I don't work, if I apply for a visit visa they need my bank statement or can my husband sponsor me? "

1469,J-1 Visa Waiver after internship at Los Alamos National Laboratory,"I have an offer for a 1-year graduate internship at Los Alamos National Laboratory (I'm an engineer and PhD student in engineering) and I'll probably be issued a (research scholar) J-1 Visa. Actually I'm already at LANL for a shorter period and with a different agreement (I'm just a visitor, not an employee), on a Visa Waiver Program (ESTA).  What I'm concerned of is the dreaded ""Two-Year Home-Country Physical Requirement"", as I want to stay long term at Los Alamos, and I already have potential contacts to go on with a postoc here (as long as I stay here during my PhD so that they can know me better). The two-year rule would prevent me from obtaining a new J-1, while the ""24-month bar"" rule will prevent me to get another J-1.  I come from Italy, which does not appear on the ""skill list"": [website]The program is not going to be found by my contry and is not part of my PhD thesis, and I'll have no scolarship during the internship. I'll be hired by the lab (so I'll be an employee) and receive a salary for a total amount of 50,000 - 60,000 $ according to the exact duration of the internship. Being Los Alamos funded by the US Government, I think I'll be a bearer of the two-year rule.  Here are my possibilities:  1) The first is the ""No objection waiver"".

1470,"Ukraine, dual citizenship & passport ownership","I had a few questions regarding dual citizenship.  I was born in Ukraine in 96, moved to the UK in 05 and recently received British Citizenship.  I’m currently in the process of applying for a British passport and my application is being held on the account that the passport office (or at least my case worker) does not know if Ukraine allows dual citizenship and whether it’s lawful for me to obtain a British passport.  I am somewhat at a disadvantage as I do not understand the Ukrainian language, or the law. I am unable to find the latest rules &amp; legislations regarding dual citizenship in English and am somewhat reluctant to ask the consulate as I am afraid of revealing my details to the Ukrainian authorities because of the mandatory national service there, despite me permanently living and working in the UK. ​  1) I voluntarily acquired the citizenship of Great Britain. I haven't renounced any kind of Ukrainian citizenship, am I still considered as a Ukrainian citizen?  2) Does this mean I have dual citizenship?  3) Is dual citizenship allowed in Ukraine?  4) From reading online, I understand that a large number of people that still reside in Ukraine hold at least one foreign passport as well as a Ukrainian one. Is this allowed?  5) Am I able to get a letter from the Ukrainian Embassy in the UK explaining that dual citizenship/ dual passports are allowed in Ukraine? - ideally this is what I need  6) What is the process of renouncing Ukrainian citizenship? How long does the process take?  Is there anyone else in the same situation as me?  I really need some advice as to what to do.  "
1471,I freelance remotely for companies around the world. Can I work while traveling on tourist visas?,"(this question was also asked in StackExchange Travel) I found many questions similar but none that directly address my situation.  I am a U.S. citizen.

Can I legally keep working from my laptop? I have no employer, and I get paid in various currencies. But I CAN keep my ""home base"" and mailing address in the U.S. Does this still fall under being ""a U.S. citizen who works in the U.S. and is just working on vacation (a long vacation)""?

1472,2004/38/EC: Applying for EU Family Member Residence Card (Verification Against EU Law) in the Netherlands After More Than 90 Days In-Country,"TL;DR (because this has turned into a MUCH longer post than I anticipated - sorry!): should we be concerned about my non-EU boyfriend submitting an application for verification against EU law (namely directive 2004/38/EC, and for which we are otherwise comfortable he qualifies) to the IND here in the Netherlands some time after his initial 90 days in the country (on a facilitation visa technically valid until 2022, but with a supposed 90-day duration of stay specified) have already passed? Thanks in advance!    Hello everyone - I'm choosing to post this question here (and also on the ImmigrationBoards site) as I've seen a number of similar (though not identical) questions here, and a number of you seem to really know what you're talking about, so I'm hoping you'll be able to help me with a little reassurance at least. The following are a couple of the similar questions I've already reviewed:  Does an application for a resident permit allow the overstay of a Schengen visa?  What are the rules for a non-EU family member travelling with an EU national?  I'll try and simplify as much as possible what is a fairly complex situation. I'm a British citizen, and my boyfriend is Thai (we're neither married nor in any form of registered partnership, but we have a de facto cohabitation). We lived together in Thailand for almost seven years, so the length of our cohabitation is sufficient for the purposes of 2004/38/EC to qualify him as my non-EU family member, and likewise all other eligibility requirements of 2004/38/EC are met - there's no issue there.  Last September he successfully obtained a free-of-charge, expedited facilitation entry visa from the Dutch Embassy in Bangkok - everything went according to plan - which was issued as a Schengen type C visa, as I understand is normal.  The multiple-entry visa is valid until 2022 (that was unexpected!), and we arrived here in the Netherlands together on 12 March this year. I am for now continuing with the self-employed freelance writing work I have done for some years in Bangkok, and my boyfriend hasn't been working for some time but intends to look for work here.  We had no issues when passing through passport control at Schiphol Airport - we weren't even asked a single question (unlike in 2017, when we also arrived into Schiphol, that time on a regular three-month, multiple-entry Schengen type C tourist visa, issued as a courtesy by the Dutch Embassy to save us time after their outsourced application centre screwed up our application for a 2004/38/EC EU Family Member visa; on that occasion, the immigration officer at Schiphol asked a few friendly questions as is to be expected, but still nothing out of the ordinary).  Since arriving here in March, we have rented an apartment (that took a considerably longer time than expected), and - following my registration appointment at the local Gemeente (municipality/town hall) a couple of weeks ago and a subsequent home visit by two of their staff, the latter owing to a now resolved problem with our landlord's registration of the property with the municipality - just a couple of days ago I received confirmation by post that I have been successfully recorded as resident in the population register.  I've had the various interdependent phases of our 'arrival bureaucracy' - as in what's required for us both to be legally and fully registered here - mapped out for some time, and those (renting an apartment, and me registering with the municipality) were two of the first items on my list of six. The remaining four are as follows (as far as I'm aware these are still correct, but I'm very happy to be told otherwise if something jumps out at you as wrong, or in an order that doesn't make sense):   register myself as self-employed with the KvK (Chamber of Commerce); I have an appointment to do so this coming Wednesday 12 June, and we need the certificate of this registration for the next step; register myself with the IND (the Netherlands' immigration agency) as an EU citizen in order to obtain a proof of entitlement to residency status (ordinarily as an EU citizen this wouldn't be necessary, but alas we need that proof of entitlement for the next step in order for my boyfriend to be able to apply for a similar proof of his entitlement to residency (and in any case, with Brexit still looming it might be no bad thing to have my proof of entitlement on hand). To obtain my proof of entitlement I notably need to provide the self-employment registration certificate and evidence that my self-employment involves real work (business accounts/monthly business records/accountant's letter etc - I'm hoping I can get by with copies of invoices sent to my clients); have my boyfriend apply for 'verification against EU law' (i.e. his eligibility under 2004/38/EC) with the IND, in order to obtain a certificate of lawful residence (which I assume either is or comes alongside the actual credit-card-sized residence card - please correct me if I'm wrong about that!); in order to apply for that, he notably needs to provide my own proof of entitlement to residency status as above, along with evidence of my work and income again (with any luck I can use the same self-employment registration certificate and invoices etc as in the previous step, but if not then I have also just accepted a full-time job offer in the past couple of days, so by this point I should also have a signed employment contract to use instead if need be) and evidence of our relationship and our cohabitation abroad (this was all previously evidenced in the original visa application, so hopefully we can re-use that same evidence - however, if the IND insists on our previous joint Thai tenancy agreements etc being legalised then we might have a bit of a problem, as our last landlord was uncooperative on that front, and my boyfriend's birth certificate is the only thing we managed to get legalised before leaving - in that situation we may have to rely on the photos of the course of our relationship that we also submitted with the visa application, and hope for the best from there); and finally have my boyfriend register at the local municipality, as I already have; for this he needs the residence card he should by now have obtained in the previous step (hence he couldn't register with the municipality at the same time as me, since as an EU citizen I didn't need a residence card).   Now comes the potential problem and my question, and the part where I am hoping for some advice, or at least a bit of reassurance:  In an ideal world (and indeed as we originally anticipated), all of the steps above would have been completed within the first three months of us arriving here, since by the letter of the law under 2004/38/EC that's the period for which my boyfriend (and I) can stay here with no other questions asked and without needing to satisfy any other criteria (e.g. the need for me to be working), meaning that it's generally expected you'll have completed at least up to step 3 (his registration with the IND) by the end of those three months.  That also coincides with the maximum 90 days (in a 180-day period) that non-EU/EEA/Swiss nationals on a short-stay Schengen visa are generally meant to stay in the Schengen area without applying for a longer-term visa/residence permit. That 90-day limit applies in general to short-stay visitors, of course, even when - as in my boyfriend's case - the visa's expiry date is actually in 2022 (giving it a roughly four-year validity period, since it was issued in 2018); like most of that length, his visa nevertheless still has a 'duration of stay' field that reads '90' [days], and ordinarily that would apply.  Evidently, all the other bureaucratic processes leading up to step 3 have in fact taken longer than expected, meaning that none of those four steps above are yet complete. Importantly, my boyfriend hasn't yet registered with the IND as per step 3 - and, here's the big one, his initial 90 consecutive days in the Schengen area (and indeed in his case in the Netherlands, since he hasn't yet been abroad since arriving) expire today (Sunday 09 June). (Last-minute to be asking for advice, I know, I know - doh!)  As I mentioned, my appointment to register as self-employed is on Wednesday 12 June (now that I've accepted a full-time job, I could have just waited for that to come through as evidence of my work, but that would have just delayed things further - and I'll still also be self-employed on the side, in any case). Fortunately, I can pay a little extra that day to come away with an extract of the certificate there and then, so there shouldn't be any more waiting around for that.  Given how contingent each of the steps are on the ones before, until now I was planning to only make the appointments with the IND once the previous steps were complete and I had the self-employment registration certificate and other documents in my hand ready to go. But given where we're at now, I'm planning to call the IND on Tuesday (they're closed for a public holiday on Monday, and an appointment for these kinds of application seems to be one of the few kinds you can't make online!) to make the appointments now, although I still don't know how long a wait there might be. (At the very least I'll be able to speak to someone there, and we should have an appointment date in the diary for submitting our applications).  My main question is this: in your knowledge and/or experience, do you think we are likely to encounter problems in submitting my boyfriend's application for verification against EU law (2004/38/EC) and issue of a certificate of lawful residence (and therefore his residence card) by virtue of him having 'overstayed' past the '90 days' by the time he visits the IND's office in person to submit his application?  Should we just wait it out and go ahead as planned, or - and I don't believe there's any other alternative here for him to apply for an (emergency) extension of his existing stay or, say, for him to be given an additional sticker in his passport to explicitly carry him over to the processing of his residence application - should we instead take the extreme alternative option and have him return to Thailand in the next day or so (before we're over the apparent three-day 'grace' period at the end of a 90-day stay, where no enforcement action seems to take place), and then presumably have to wait there for another full 90 days because of the 90/180 day rule and the need to wait for a fresh 180-day period, and only then come over and start afresh at getting the whole process wrapped up?  That last option is, of course, made all the more risky and all the less appealing by the fact that, with me being a British citizen, none of us know for sure what will happen in relation to Brexit over those coming 90 days. That means it's perfectly conceivable that, when the time comes for him to head back here, Brexit could well have already happened, in which case I would no longer be an EU citizen and he would no longer be entitled to settle here in the Netherlands as my (non-)EU family member in the way that he is now.  Clearly, my strong preference would be for us both to stay here now until everything is sorted, but obviously I also don't want him to encounter any immigration problems on departure from the Schengen area now or in the future, or worse still when coming back in.  (Side thought: given 2004/38/EC seems to entitle the family member to spend up to three months in one/each particular Schengen state together with the EU national before needing to apply for a residence card etc, yet apparently doesn't limit the amount of time that they can spend in the Schengen area as a whole (at least based on the interpretation in SuperRoo's answer here and in phoog's answer here) provided they are moving around enough (i.e. not staying anywhere longer than three months) and are travelling with the EU national, could it even be worth us popping briefly to another Schengen state, say across the border to Belgium - or theoretically even just saying that we have? - and then coming back to the Netherlands to pick up where we left off, having technically fulfilled the requirements of the rules? Does that make sense? Is it worth considering, unnecessary, or unhelpful?)  Here's my take, personally: I'm increasingly doubting myself on this in the face of the gravity of the situation, but I still don't believe that the 90/180 day rule applies to non-EU family members (provided they are travelling or residing with the EU national). @phoog helpfully explains here and here, in some detail and in terms of specific parts of 2004/38/EC, how the 90-day limit doesn't apply to (non-)EU family members because they are not considered 'third-country nationals' for this purpose. That makes total sense to me (and it also occurred to me while writing this that, if the 90-day limit did actually apply, there would surely be a discrepancy between family members having three months of totally-no-questions-asked time in a particular Schengen country (just as their EU relative does) and yet supposedly only being allowed to remain in the Schengen area for 90 days of that as per their visa (or immigration stamp in the case of non-visa nationals) - given that 90 days is usually just less than three months, that just doesn't seem to square up.  @phoog also points out that the family member's freedom of movement together with the EU national is derived from directive 2004/38/EC, rather than from any visa (which is just a means of demonstrating eligibility to enter the country) or residence card (which, again, just more conveniently evidences the already existing right to free movement, rather than actually creating it, and without which the right still exists in full).  This separate answer, however, is one of a number that take a slightly different view, suggesting that the 90/180 day rule still applies unless and until the family member has obtained a residence card.  I sent a query along these lines to the Dutch government's consular contact centre, who I have found very helpful in the past (and who most importantly of all are relatively quick to respond), and they advised:  'If I understand correctly, you want to know if your partner can stay longer than 90 days in the Schengen area on a short-stay (facilitating) Schengen visa.   I am afraid your boyfriend cannot stay within the Schengen area over 90 days on a facilitating visa. Please note that this type of visa is for short-stays only (maximum of 90 days within a period of 180 days). I would advise him to leave the Schengen area before the 90 day period has ended. If not, he is overstaying which may lead to a Schengen Information System alert.'  However, in light of all the above, what they have told me now strikes me as increasingly unlikely to be true (I am wondering if the consular contact centre staff member perhaps just doesn't quite appreciate the rights inferred on the family member by 2004/38/EC, with or without a visa OR residence card, and the implications that has for 'overstaying' actually being possible in this case).  In addition, numerous posts like this one have also highlighted that 2004/38/EC also states that family members who fail to comply with obligations to, for instance, register with the IND on time as in this case, should only result in 'proportionate and non-discriminatory sanctions'. (@phoog also points this out here.) The IND's own web site even states (albeit in connection with a slightly different topic, but still in the context of 'overstaying' or being in the Netherlands 'illegally'), that the application of bans on returning to the Netherlands (for instance) 'does not apply to EU/EEA citizens and their family members'.  (In spite of this, the person from the consular contact centre points out the risk of a Schengen Information System alert if my boyfriend 'overstays'.)  Therefore, even if my boyfriend does 'overstay' (that is, even if they do interpret it that way, which it doesn't look to me like they should) the original 90-day period by a few more days (or even longer) before finally being able to submit his application to the IND, it sounds like the worst he/we will get when applying is a slap on the wrist and perhaps a fine - or maybe, if we're lucky, not even that.  I think putting it all down in writing in such a long, long post (sorry!) has helped reassure me somewhat already - but I'm still somewhat torn as to what best to do, so I'd really appreciate any advice anyone might have, particularly if anyone has had experience of this or something similar in the past. Should I be concerned? Or am I worrying about nothing? What are your thoughts? Huge thanks in advance - and thanks for even reading this far!  (Phew!) "

1476,"UK student visitor visa refused, Erasmus Mundus scholarship","I come from Georgia. I have been selected for the Erasmus Mundus master's programme and received a scholarship of 42.000 EUR. This is a very prestigious scholarship scheme and a very reliable source of funding.  The programme starts on September 1st and I must spend the 1st semester at the University of Cumbria, Ambleside, the UK. In January 2016, I must move to Norway in order to continue my studies at the Norwegian Institution. From August 2016, I must study in Germany for the next part of my programme.  I have applied to the UK Visas and Immigration office, Istanbul. I have asked for short term student visitor visa and got refused. Now I am reapplying and have some questions.  Exact wording of the refusal letter quoted here:     You have applied to visit the UK as part of the Erasmus Mundus Scheme. You have provided evidence from the scheme and from the Universities involved, including the University of Cumbria.      You have stated that you are employed as a manager by COMPANYNAME. It is reasonable that you would provide evidence of this employment to demonstrate your source of income. You have provided a bank letter and statement from AAA Bank and I note the statement shows salary deposits, however the lack of any evidence from your stated employer to corroborate the income raises concerns. I realise you state you are resigning from your employment, however I would still expect to see evidence to show the source of your personal funds.      Your bank letter also states you hold two other accounts, including a Euro account. You have not demonstrated any source for the funds in these accounts.      Although your visit will be funded by the Erasmus Mundus Scheme, it is still reasonable that you would provide evidence of your circumstances in Georgia. The lack of such evidence raises concerns regarding your intentions and reason for travelling to study overseas.      In light of all of the above I am not satisfied as to your intentions in wishing to travel to the UK now. I am not satisfied that you genuinely intend a short student visit only to the UK and that you will leave the UK at the end of the visit. I am therefore not satisfied that your application meets the paragraph A57D(b)   Fist of all, about the evidence from my employer, when I filled in my application, I was about to leave my job because I wanted more time to prepare for my studies. And by the time I had an appointment at Teleperformance, I had already left my job. This is why I didn't even think of retrieving such letter from my employer. Now I see it was stupid of me. For my new application, I have retrieved the letter proving that I indeed worked there from ---- to ---- and received salary of ----. Do you think it helps?  As for two other bank accounts, I have some money on both of them but not so much. This was gift from my father when he heard I was going to study abroad. I didn't know it was necessary to demonstrate this. This time I have retrieved a document from bank that proves that it was indeed my father who deposited this sum to my account. Do you think it helps?  I understand that these two documents were indeed lacking in my application but what is surprising for me is that my personal funds should not be important when I receive a scholarship from Erasmus Mundus. I have enclosed several letters from Erasmus Mundus Scheme itself, from European Union, from my host universities, all stating that ALL MY COSTS WILL BE COVERED BY ERASMUS. I can support myself with this scholarship even without the money that I personally own. I am also surprised because I have a very good travel record in Schengen countries. I have received 4 visas during past 5 years and the last one is a 2-year schengen visa which is still in force.  I have requested more supporting letters from universities and from the Erasmus Mundus Association representatives in Georgia. I hope this also helps.  I am thinking of enclosing frank letter where I will explain why the documents were lacking in the first application and that I am adding them now. I also want to demonstrate in this letter that I do not intend to stay in the UK I perfectly understand that everybody would say the same but the thing is that if I don't leave UK, I cannot go to Norway to continue my studies and my scholarship and everything will be completely lost. This is very logical. It is not in my interests to stay in UK. I also want to indicate that I have amazing parents here at home and I would never want to leave my country forever. I also want to include letters proving that they have well paid jobs here. Do you think it is good?  Last but not the least, should I send the refusal letter back to them with my new application documents? "

By force of habit, I also carry my foreign ID card on my person. However, this has raised some issues in the past few years:  Some US-based relatives have claimed that it is strongly recommended that I own a state ID, particularly if I am planning to take driving lessons. (They claim that carrying the examination permit will not be sufficient.)  Is this true? Does it still hold if I am not taking driving lessons? I remember asking a senior at my university if getting a state ID card was useful, and getting a response of ""it's not really necessary."" It's also worth noting that I attended some events for international students during orientation a few years ago, and this was never stated to me. However, Wikipedia gives an inconsistent picture, and suggests that it might essentially be necessary in some cases. "

Can I just submit my notice, serve the notice period and then quit and go work for another company?

1486,Applying for a Type D (long stay) Schengen Visa for Belgium,"I will be applying for a Type D (long stay) Schengen Visa for Belgium this September and I am from Philippines. A host family already contacted me to be their next au pair and we are now discussing things together with their agency for the requirements for my visa application and my work permit for Belgium. Regarding the visa application, I would like to ask if I need to provide documents that would prove my strong ties here in Philippines. If yes, what are the kind of documents that I need to bring? I do not own a house or rent an apartment and I do not also have a bank account with large amount of savings. I am also still living with my parents and I do not support them yet financially. I just graduated from the university last year and I already have my professional license as a teacher. However I was not employed yet as a teacher here in a public or private school. After I graduated, I was employed as a tutor in a tutorial center and as of now I am employed in a call center as a customer service representative earning a low salary.  Do au pair visa applicants need to prove their strong ties in their home country especially if they will apply for a Schengen visa? I am aware that it is common among U.S visa applicants to prove their strong ties in their home country in any non-immigrant visa applications, however I'm not really sure in the case of Schengen visa application especially if I will be an au pair in Belgium.  I have read in a website some supporting documents for U.S. visa application to prove the strong ties in the home country. I wonder if I could also present these for my Schengen visa appl;ication if ever I need to prove my strong ties in Philippines. The possible documents I could provide are the following:  A sworn affidavit from your parents listing all the family members who live in your home country, and including details to show that they are all firmly settled there. Even better, include a statement of why you, too, are likely to return (especially if there is a family business or property).  --I am not really sure how to provide this. What is this affidavit called? Can you give a sample format of this affidavit?  Documentation of your career potential in your home country, including statistics from a reputable source, such as your government, showing that people with your skills are in high demand; or a letter from a potential employer.  --Teachers as far as I know are in demand in the Philippines, and I am already a professional teacher myself. I wonder how can I provide a document stating this.  Professional Licenses: If you have any kind of professional license that could expire unless you return home.  --As mentioned, I have a professional teaching license in Philippines. It will expire on October 2017 and can be renewed. My au pair contract is just one year and the possible start date is on December 2015 so that would end on December 2016. Can I just present my license along with the other documents? "
1487,Is Saarbrücken worth living in?,"I'm looking to study abroad and there is this master in Saarbrücken which I really like. The problem I find with it is that it doesn't look like a big city at all. I've been living in Barcelona for the past three years and I was looking for a smaller city.   However, I really like living a cosmopolitan life in a city with lots of cultural offer and festivals, music, night life... I was wondering, is Saarbrücken as bland as it seems? For what I've been able to find it looks more like a small town in the middle of nowhere.  So, is Saarbrücken worth moving to, or is it just a more or less little city with almost nothing to do in it?  "
1488,How to find tax accountant to advise on double taxation for US citizen working in UK for US company,"I am looking for a tax accountant in either the US or UK who would be willing to consult with me about the following situation:     A US citizen will be moving to the UK on a Tier 2 (spousal) visa for one year (that does not overlap with the tax year in either country). She will work from home in the UK, for a US company that will pay into her US bank. What are our tax liabilities in both countries?   Having spoken to the UK HMRC, it seems that the UK's answer will depend on the US's answer, which in turns depends on the UK's answer.   I'm not looking for advice about the question above, just specifically whether or not there exists a tax accountant (or some other service) that I can consult with who could advise me on the tax situation in both countries at once. I could not find anyone via Google. Do such people exist? "

1490,UK PLAB visa refusal,"I recently got a visa refusal for uk visit visa. As my father is sponsoring me he encashed some of the money from his fixed deposit and transferred in to his account i provided the evidence of encashment with my visa application.   Decision  ""I have refused your application for a visit visa because I am not satisfied that you meet the requirements of paragraph(s) V4.2 (a) and V4.2 (c) of Appendix V and visitors Appendix 3: Immigration rules of visitors because:  You have applied for a visa to undertake your PLAB 2 examination in the UK. Whilst you have provided evidence of your registration for this exam I must also consider your personal and financial circumstances.  You state that you have been employed as a Doctor with the xxx since June 2015, where you earn a monthly income of PKR 20,000. In support of his statement you have provided a letter of reference from the head of department. However , this document has been produced a your own request and I am not satisfied that this single letter,in isolation,supports your circumstances. If I were to accept this document then I must consider that you have only been employed in this capacity for less than 3 months prior to submission of your UK visa application.  With regards to the proposed expenditure you state that 3000 pounds is available for your visit and that your father will meet all of the costs associated with your stay. In support of this statement you have provided an affidavit from your father and his personal bank account statement. However, there are a number of recent, large cash deposits which are inconsistent with the overall transactional history of the account. I therefore consider that the balance has been inflated just prior to submission of your UK visa application.  In the absence of evidence to demonstrate the origin of these funds, I am not satisfied that these will remain available to you or that this account statement is an accurate reflection of his financial circumstances.  Given the evidence before me I am not satisfied that you have accurately presented your circumstances or intentions in wishing to enter United Kingdom. I am therefore not satisfied that you are genuinely seeking entry for a purpose permitted by the visitor routes or that you will leave the United Kingdom at the end of your visit. I therefore refuse your application under paragraphs V4.2 (a) and V4.2 (c) of Appendix V  Q1 : I plan to reapply in Jan 2016 , i contacted the bank from where the fixed deposits were cashed and transferred in to the account. They are ready to provide me with a encashment certificate that will state the amount withdrawn with dates. Is that evidence sufficient enough to prove the origin of the funds?  Q2 : How should my father balance his account statement after the deposits. He receives monthly pension , rents from the properties and interest from the fixed deposits.   Q3 : As i stated i will reapply in Jan 2016 by then i will be unemployed as i will quit my job next month due to my upcoming exams I will explain in my application that i resigned from my job and will attach a experience certificate given to me by the hospital. Will my unemployment and resignation from the job , raise any red flags or have a negative impact on my application which will lead to refusal?  My father would still be supporting me financially when i will reapply. "

1494,What are the requirements for an EEA family permit to enter the UK?,"Background: The person is married to an EEA citizen. They currently live outside Europe. They're traveling to the UK together.  Do they need to show any proof of income, hotel reservation, return or health insurance for the application? Or on arrival? Does the EEA citizen need to show evidence of prospective employment?  The official source only mentions passports, marriage certificate and photo.  However I've heard about these other requirements, including from consulates of other EU countries (not about the UK in that case). Are they really not required for the UK? Are people just confusing it with the more common standard visitor visa (which does requires them)? Or is it recommended, albeit not required, to have them because the acceptance criteria are subjective? "
1495,"Applying for EEA family permit to enter the UK, with marriage realized outside Europe","Is a certified translation (made in the country we live in) of the marriage certificate enough? What are the requirements for this translation?  I'm asking this because an Italian consulate (I'm an Italian-Brazilian citizen) informed us that, to use our marriage rights in Italy, we'd need to make a ""transcription"" to make it valid in that country. That meant pay a fee, send the original to Italy and wait 90 days. "
1496,Am I eligible for a Dutch passport (both parents now British)?,"Please help me find out if I can become a Dutch National.  I was born in Nigeria 1971 to a Dutch expatriate mother and a British expatriate father. As there was no European Community at the time my mother was advised to change her nationality to British, as otherwise I might be refused either a Dutch or a British passport. So, both my parents are now British.  My grandmother was Dutch and born in Drenthe in the early 1900s. I have 16 Dutch uncles and aunties, 21 Dutch cousins and I speak (but don't write) the language fluently/very proficiently. I spent about 6 years of my childhood living in The Netherlands and attended school there for 2 years.  My mother has a Dutch pension from when she worked there before meeting my father and becoming an expatriate. She does not have a British pension as she has never worked in Britain, and only ever lived in Britain for 2 years before retirement.  Is there any chance that I am eligible for a Dutch passport? What is the best way to prove my eligibility under my circumstances? "

1498,"Got a green card, stayed 6 months, paperwork says she can come back but can she?","My mother-in-law visited me and my wife last year by obtaining her green card. She also got her social security number. She came to the USA in June 2017 and left back to her home country, Iraq, inNovember 2017. Her paperwork says she is allowed to visit the US with her green card as long as she doesn't stay more than, I think it's mentioned a year, in her home country.  She wanted to come see us again and was wondering if any changes have been made since she last left (November 2017). Is there any issue with her visiting us? I am afraid that she gets all the way here and she is told to go back to her home country (north Iraq).  I did read this:     A Green Card is valid for readmission to the United States after a trip abroad if you do not leave for longer than 1 year. If your trip will last longer than 1 year, a reentry permit is needed.   From the USCIS site: [website]Since she left in November 2017 and we are in August 2018, this would mean she is allowed to come to the US without further complications or forms, correct? If on the other hand we were in December 2018 right now she would then have to apply for reentry it appears. "

1502,Using moving boxes as checked luggage?,"My wife and  don't have much stuff that we want to bring with us when when move. As such I have determined that it would be best just to check an extra piece of luggage each with the airline when we fly over.  Between my wife and I we only actually have 1 or 2 suitably large suitcases. It seems like buying new (or even second hand) rolling luggage just for single use in the move is a bit of a waste. As such we are considering other options to fill out the rest.  One option I particularly like is the idea of buying some sturdy moving boxes, like you would use if having your stuff transported. Having used those before when moving house, they are not your ordinary box. Heavy duty, double-reinforced corrugated cardboard.  I feel like they would stand-up to the punishment of a flight no problem. They will be perhaps a bit of a pain to move about at each end when moving between plane, trains and taxis. But so would having extra rolling luggage, and at most of those points a trolley can be arranged.  Is this viable? Has  anyone first (or second) hand experience of doing this? "

1505,Entering the Schengen area with one passport and legally remaining with another,I have obtained my visa to study in the Schengen area. It is valid from September 4. However my flight is on September 2 (flights are full and I cannot change it). I can enter the Schengen area as a tourist on my second passport and then once my visa is valid I can remain and study in that area legally with my other passport.  Will it be an issue if I do not have an exit stamp on the passport I have entered? Will it be an issue if I do not have an entering stamp on the passport that carries my student visa? How can I approach this issue without having to fly out of the Schengen area with the passport I have entered and reenter with my valid visa?  I plan to study in Spain.

1509,Time period to renew GNIB,"I am currently living in Ireland with a GNIB Stamp 2 permit, which will expire in about a month. Before this, I was given permission to stay for three months, but quickly got the GNIB card after a month or so (having been able to book an appointment with a lot of time).   I will be leaving for 10 days to another EU country before the expiration date and returning after the expiration date.   There are two possible scenarios bad scenarios for me at this moment:    I may get an appointment before I leave but the new IRP will arrive after I left (there's a 10 day wait). I may not get an appointment before I leave, so my GNIB will expire while I am away, hopefully with an appointment booked after the return date.   On the other hand, INIS (Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service) has now issued a new permit, the IRP (Irish Residence Permit), and their webpage reads (emphasis mine)     Do not apply for a new IRP if you currently hold a valid GNIB card. Wait until your GNIB card expires (or is lost or stolen) and then apply as normal.   Question. Does this mean there is some allowed period of time after the GNIB expires where it is legal to stay in the country? If not, what measures should I take, given the possible scenarios above, so that when I return to the country I do not have a problem with INIS at the airport?  Note: I am a Latin American citizen that does not require a visa to enter (or reenter) Ireland, and can stay (if allowed) up to three months before requiring a permit. I hold a scholarship from Ireland's main college for the following two years (hence the Stamp 2), meaning they pay for the fees and provide me with a stipend.  "

We're assuming I'm entering as a French citizen.   I don't believe I need a visa, for how long is this going to remain true? How is the UK dealing with EU citizens? Am I going to eventually get thrown out? Is there a date I need to move by? Am I allowed to work? Is there any legal restrictions from me accepting a job offer the day after I move in? Am I covered under the NHS health insurance? Is there a premium? Will I eventually not be covered? Will I have access to federally subsided loans for university? Is there any legal restrictions on me, for example, living in an apartment? Am I allowed to enter into a contract with a landlord? I could not find a way to contact the British government with these questions. The local embassy does not take inquiries. Is there any way I can get these questions answered in writing from the government?   Thanks in advance (: "

I want to get a contract before leaving Canada, but pretty much every recruiter I talked to seem to suggest me to opt for a work sponsorship instead.  Should I get contracts before or after leaving, considering the fact that most recruiters tell me to get sponsorship instead since I'm not already in the UK? Is it because companies do not want to do contractual business with someone still abroad, or is there another reason? "
1519,I am a freelance web developer with all clients in UK but looking to move with family to Germany,"I am a freelance web developer with all clients in UK but looking to move with family to Germany.  So would I need to register as a freelancer in Germany and how soon, if I travel back to England a lot to do meetings and work?  If I do have to register for tax how does it work as a freelancer, I was told I would need a large insurance bound in case someone sued me?  Can I just pay tax in the UK or would I have to move and stop tax there? I understand it maybe only a few months and then you have to change.  I am English, she and our kids are German if it matters. "
1520,How to handle moving between countries with different tax year dates?,"As I understand it, quite a few countries have double-taxation agreements between themselves, which dictate how you handle income and taxation in one country if resident in another. A fair number of these (but by no means all!) have clauses in them which mean that if you are deemed to be tax resident in one of them, you are automatically not a tax resident in the other one.   In theory, this should mean that if last year you were tax resident in County A, then this year you move to Country B and are counted as a tax resident there for this year, then you pay your taxes for last year to Country A and this year's to Country B. (Leaving aside complications about income you still get from Country A while living in Country B, which may well still be paid to A with B giving you a credit for the tax already paid)  Sounds simple enough, but... What happens when Countries A and B have different dates for their tax years?  (eg you move from the UK to France on 1st Feb, and are deemed to be a French tax payer for that French tax = calendar year, how does it work with the UK tax year running to the 5th April?) "
1521,"Are personal income taxes paid for income for a full year, even when moving from Sweden to Canada mid-year, for a Dutch citizen?","There are a number of questions related to taxes on this site, and Wikipedia has an article on tax residency.  This question on varying tax dates seems to imply income might be counted for a full year.  It never occurred to me this might be the case, so now I'm confused.  The Wikipedia article on double taxation is not helpful.  If I simply move abroad to take a new job, can double taxation possibly arise?  Example: in 2014, a Dutch citizen with no taxable property lives in Sweden during January and February, and has income exclusively from local employment.  Then, he/she moves to Canada, where he/she lives for the rest of the year, again with income exclusively from local employment.  In my possibly naive understanding, he/she was a Swedish resident with Swedish taxable income January–February, and a Canadian resident with Canadian taxable income March–December, and would pay taxes to Sweden for the first two months, and to Canada for the remaining ten months.  Is this correct?  If yes, then how could double taxation be a problem?  Does the Canadian tax office somehow care about income I had within the year, but before becoming a Canadian resident? "
1522,"As a non-citizen former resident of Sweden, how do I inform authorities of my new address?","I am a former resident of Sweden, but not a citizen there.  When I moved abroad, I informed the Swedish tax authorities of my new address.  How do I inform the tax authorities of moving from one foreign address to another one?  Neither of two possible forms apply:   SKV 7665 Anmälan - Flyttning till utlandet.  This form is for the initial move abroad, to be filled while still registered as a resident in Sweden. SKV 7842 Anmälan - Ny adress/röstlängd för utvandrad.  Although this form is for registering a new address while living abroad, it is only for Swedish citizens, as it relates to being registered in the database of Swedish citizens eligible to participate in Swedish elections.   I used SKV 7842, but it seems not to have worked as I did not receive any confirmation.  How do I correctly inform Swedish tax authorities of a new address while living abroad? "
1523,"Malaysian seeking asylum in US, can't get B1/B2 or C1 visa. Thinking of crossing to San Diego from Tijuana","Is that a good idea? That seems like my only option left. I can't get a visa to transit/arrive in the US, which is probably the point of visas precisely: to weed out asylum seekers. Any blind spots I'm missing?  Apparently, Mexicans are showing up all the time and being turned away at the SoCal ports-of-entry, even though they're claiming asylum, so is there a big chance that they ignore me like they do the Mexicans? Can I just keep showing up every day, until I get myself successfully detained and given a credible fear interview, at which point I contact an attorney? "
1524,Is it possible to switch to a UK Tier 2 ICT Long-term Staff visa in the United Kingdom?,"Can the application process for switching from a UK Tier 2 ICT Short-term multiple entry visa to a UK Tier 2 ICT Long-term multiple entry visa be carried out in the United Kingdom? Or will the visa need to be processed from the home country? The applicants will continue to work for the same employer as mentioned in the short-term visa application. The official webpage explicitly says that holders of multiple entry work permits are not eligible for the same, but I think I might be misunderstanding. "

The agency has the main core in Europe and I live in the United States (under J2 visa with work permit).

1526,Moving to South Africa to live with a South African citizen,"I am both a U.S citizen as well as a South African citizen. Next summer I plan to permanently move to South Africa with my boyfriend. I should be able to get into the country with just a one way ticket, right? And what about my boyfriend? (non S.A citizen) will he need a certain visa or just proof that he will be living with me? Since we are moving permanently we don't want to pay the extra money for a return trip, since we won't be returning. Would it be easier to get him in if we were married? I don't want any problems at the airport but I can't seem to find an answer anywhere online. "
1527,The importance of a Bachelors Degree,"I'm a Java Software developer, planning to move to Toronto from South America in the next few months. The problem  is, I have not finished my Bachelors Degree in CS, but I have a few years of experience working as a full time developer for many companies.  Here where I live, the Bachelors Degree is not a must have in order to get a job, and since I had to pay for it myself I could not finish it yet.  Do you guys think I could get a job in Toronto with a incomplete degree, experience and a Java Programmer I certificate? If so, I would receive an entry level salary?  EDIT: Explaining my situation a little bit better, I could finish my degree in one year, although that would be hard and expensive. I can see that not having a degree could make it harder for me to get a job, but the urge to left my country has led me to consider this possibility.   I thought I could go with a working permit, find work there and then apply for permanent residency, and, if possible, finish my degree in Canada. "
1528,What to do after a small car incident in Germany?,"I got into a small fender-bender yesterday and did not really know what to do. I want to know the proper actions one should take when dealing with such situations.  I'll first describe in short my incident: I was backing out of a parking spot of a gardening store. When I was completely out of the spot and on the driveway, the car that was in the opposite parking spot started to back out as well and hit me. What I really want to say here is that it was not my fault. This is a minor incident: I have a small dent and a lot of small scratches. Nevertheless, this lowers the value of the car and needs to be fixed.  Therefore, what I really need to know is:   Should the police be called for such minor issues? Does it suffice to take the other driver's insurance details or must one also get something else, like a short statement? Must the incident be declared somewhere?

1529,What is the process for a Dutch citizen (but non-resident) to get a NIE + Social + Residence card in Spain?,"I was born in Canada and acquired Dutch citizenship (by birth) while living there.  I have never resided in the EU, but have recently relocated to Spain.  I have secured legitimate employment, to begin in 7 weeks.  In order to legally work here I understand that I need a NIE and a Social Security number.  Today I was told that I should begin by declaring myself a resident.  From there I can get my NIE (using my resident number and a contract from my employer), and then my Social Security number (using the NIE).  Is this the correct order?  Will my not having a Dutch residence number/card be a problem in this process?  I do have the support of my employer, but I believe that the process may have changed since they last navigated it and so I would like as much information as I can get. "

1531,How do you re-enter the US if changing status and then taking a short trip abroad?,"A friend of mine is going to study in the US, but will enter 2-3 months in advance to explore his new home and prepare for things. Therefore he is planning to get a B2 ""prospective student"" visa and then change Status to F1 before he starts school.  I'm aware that the USCIS doesn't issue visa stickers.  Therefore my question is:  If the person takes a short trip to Canada or Latin America whilst in School (i.e. after having switched to F1 Status), how can he re-enter the US?  (my understanding is that re-entering after a trip of max 30 days to Canada or Mexico is completely painless, but what about if he were to go somewhere else, such as to Brazil for a week?) "
1532,Entering the UK on a Tier 1 (Exceptional talent) 5 year visa earlier than the originally submitted 'intended date of arrival',"Looking for clarity on the following. I have been granted a Tier 1 Visa for exceptional talent. This gives me 5 years and 4 months. Upon sending my application in for processing I indicated that my intended date of arrival was the 3rd of November 2016. Since submitting this, I have been offered work in my field and will need to arrive on the the 5th of October 2016. This will see me entering 4 weeks earlier than intended. Should I have a letter to take with me supporting this reason for earlier entry? I was given endorsement from the Arts Council of England in August of this year and am awaiting my physical visa and passport back within the next few days. Not sure where I stand on this matter with entering earlier?  "
1533,My girlfriend is with me in Canada and couldn't register to the university in France,"My girlfriend wanted to follow me to Canada, Québec for 4 months (from september to december), where I'm staying as an exchange student.  She originally planned to subscribe to distance courses at her university for one year, so she would still be covered by social welfare as she would still be a student. In the end, for some reasons, she couldn't.   She's now in Canada without any social welfare (well, she will be 4 days from now) and I'm very worried . The consequence is that she will no longer have any status in France, so I believe that put her in an illegal situation in Canada. Is there any solution?   e.g. I'm registered at the RAMQ due to agreement between France and Québec. Is there any way she could benefit from that?  I'll add that she's a French citizen and got a tourism visa. "
1534,Uk Spouse Visa/Dependant,I am married to a British national and would like to apply for a spouse visa for me and my daughter ( my husband is not the father) the child's birth certificate does not have fathers name. I am take sole care of the child.   My question is do i need a letter from the father to consent her travelling? Apart from Birth certificate and passport what other documents do I need?  Note we meet the other requirements   We are Kenyans and I don't have any legal documents saying I have sole responsibility. I practically live with her and I make all decisions in regards to her.  
1535,Dutch and French national got married in Sweden and are resident in the UK. Are they legally married in the UK for practical purposes?,"I am a Dutch citizen and got married to a French citizen while we were both resident in Sweden in 2012.  Presently we are living in England, United Kingdom.  How do we inform the relevant authorities such that we are legally married in the UK?  Do we at all?  From Gov.UK:     Contact the local authorities in the country where you want to get married or enter into a civil partnership to find out what you need to do.      Your marriage or civil partnership should be recognised in the UK if you follow the correct process according to local law - you won’t need to register it in the UK.   I'm confused by should be recognised and won't need to register.  That seems contradictory.  How can the UK “recognise” the marriage if the Register Office are not informed?  I expect it should be relevant for banking, inheritance, tenancies, medical decisions when either partner is unconscious, and perhaps other situations.  Is there any form of UK registration required, or do we simply show (a certified translation of) our Swedish marriage certificate / civil status extract for any of those situations?  It seems odd that our marital status in the UK civil registry does not say that we are legally married. "
1536,"Am I still ""ordinarily resident"" in the UK if I do a Master's degree abroad?","I am a UK citizen in my final year of an undergraduate degree in the UK. I am considering doing a Master's degree in mainland Europe, which would be two years long. However, I am also looking into the option of returning to the UK later for a PhD and am concerned that this will make me ineligible for funding.   Most of the funding bodies for the hard sciences seem to require that a potential PhD student has been ""ordinarily resident"" in the UK for the past three years, but it is unclear how this applies to students. For example, if I claimed that my parents' house (where my bank accounts etc are still registered to, as I do not have a stable address as a student) was my ""ordinary residence"", and that I had returned to the UK on short trips over the course of my masters degree, would that be accepted? Could I claim that I am only in Europe for the purposes of study and my ""ordinary residence"" is the UK because that is where I hold citizenship? Or once you finish an undergraduate degree and study abroad can you no longer claim this? "
1537,Do I need to change my residence status in the NL?,"I am in the Netherlands as a Skilled Migrant worker (Kennismigrant). My residence permit expires in 2020.  Since moving here, I've decided to change employers. My new employer is not set up to sponsor me in the Netherlands. Does this matter?  My plan was to switch to a spouse visa to remain in the Netherlands, but my reading in a few places suggests that once I have a residence card as a skilled migrant, I can work essentially anywhere, with no further sponsorship requirements. Is this accurate?  Example:     Employers are generally required to obtain a work permit before they can hire employees from outside the EU to work in the Netherlands. An exception is the skilled migrant category where the employer does not need to apply for a work permit. source   However, other sources seem to contradict this understanding (and seem more in line with what I would expect):     If you are not able to find a new job within the three months - one that matches the requirements of your permit - your residence permit will be withdrawn with retroactive effect as from the termination date. source  "

1540,What benefit has the Diversity Immigrant Visa program? (Green Card Lottery),"The registration period for the Diversity Immigrant Visa program 2018 (DV-2018) will begin shortly, on Oct 4, 12pm EDT.  How exactly is the lottery green card different from ""normal"" green cards? What exactly is the benefit of the program?   To the best of my knowledge, a non-US citizen would be able to obtain a US working visa if she happened to enter into a work contract with an US-based company. On the other hand, if some non-US citizen would win a green card in the ""lottery"" and would therefore be allowed to live and work in the US, she would still need to find a job in the US in order to make a living (on a permanent basis).   This leaves me with the impression that for a non-US citizen to be able to live in the US, it mainly depends on an employer's choice to hire that person or not.  It makes me wonder which practical benefits the ""lottery"" green card provides from the point of view of an (potential) expat who would like to live and work in the US. "

1542,German visa and Blue Card,"I have an offer from a German employer and the salary is 63K Euros. I am in India right now, and want to understand the correct visa process and ability to work in Germany.  During a conversation with an HR person, I was told to obtain a travel visa which is valid for 3 months. When this visa is granted, I'm supposed to travel to Germany and complete my joining formalities. After that, they will initiate a process for obtaining my Blue Card, which will allow me to remain in Germany and work.  I have not heard of this procedure before. I did some research on the Blue Card, and it looked alright, but I'm still concerned.   Here are the answers that I want to know.   What kind of visa would be raised when I have to travel from India to Germany? Is it the same as Schengen visa? Is this visa process legitimate? I mean, the process of getting a visa to travel from India to Germany and then applying for a Bluecard. How much money would be required to be shown in account to obtain the visa for travel from India to Germany?  "

Before they moved, they had made a Will in England, which at the time was simple as they lived there and had all their stuff there. Now they've been out in Australia for a while, most of their finances are out there too, but some remain UK-based and likely always will be.   They're about to update their Will, and have received conflicting advice from Expat friends. Some people have told them to do one Will for their UK-based stuff left with a solicitor in the UK + a second Will for their Aussie stuff with someone out there. Others have said to just write one Australian will which breaks out what's in what country.  What's the situation when moving from one Common Law country to another WRT Wills? One in each country?

After trying everything i can, i think i can safely say i am stuck with private insurance now.  After this acceptance, i am now gather info on how is it going to be several years down the line. I am now 30 and planning to stay in Germany forever. So far i am getting conflicting information on how is it going to be with the premiums later in life. I read articles and hear from some people that the private insurance premiums can go as high as 1000 Euros per month at the time of retirement. Some says it remains somewhere around the public insurance premiums. I really have no idea which one to believe. I would rather find a nice job in another country while the market is still hot than being stranded in a foreign land in old age.  My questions: - I have Gothaer private insurance and they charge about 550 per month. Any idea how much is the premium going to be when i am around the age of 60 ? - I am paying less than the public insurance at the moment. Would i be fine if i think i can just save the money saved now to pay for increased premiums later ? "

Could we do the following?   We go to Portugal together and she stays the maximum allowed length of time in that country. Then we take a flight to Sweden, and stay the maximum time. Then back to portugal.   Is it possible to bunny-hop like that to stay together in Europe?  We don’t like Argentina since they target white Europeans like myself (for scams, robberies, corrupt police, etc) and it’s not safe for me there at all and she doesn’t want me to risk that. So we’re trying to find a way to spend uninterrupted time together without involving Argentina.  We would be super grateful for any guidance.

1572,German Bank Account: Deutsche vs CommerzBank,"I'll be arriving shortly in Germany for Work and my company has asked me to tell them my preferred bank to arrange an appointment. I'm looking at various options and Commerz Bank seems to quite good however I have few questions:   Where does it mention that if I have incoming 1200Euro per month, there's no fee? And also what does it mean by incoming amount per month, do I need to maintain that balance monthly at all times or just a deposit of 1200 per month is enough but I'm free to use it as I wish? Say 1200E was deposited into the account and I can then either withdraw it completely from ATM or whatever. It still wouldn't count towards fee, right? Second, all their prices are listed in German. Can some one tell me their Credit Card annual fee compared to Deutsche Bank? Also usually what are the allowed limits on Credit Cards usually between Standard vs Gold etc. in Germany? My company is saying that Deutsche Bank will offer no fee for running account for their employees but I'll have to pay for Credit Cards and Rent Deposit accounts etc. which I'm assuming lower and free respectively in case of CommerzBank. So overall my current assumption is that CommerzBank will be cheaper in the long run compared to Deutsche Bank even if they are offering free account maintenance fee.   Thanks. "

I recently started an online business (April this year) and it has started to generate money, only in the £100s.   I remember I had to show my pay slips, P60 and bank statements showing my normal job income going in, which is a fair bit above the £18,000 threshold. I also had a signed letter from my employer, confirming my salary.  I recently got a bank account for the business, but before transactions were going to my current account where my normal job wage goes. Should I explain these payments? Or should I just talk about my normal job?   If I declare my online business income, I'm not sure how much I would declare per annum as its only just started, some weeks I might earn nothing, some a couple of hundred etc. I also have no tax returns for it yet as I wont have to do that till April next year.

1574,Can I apply for a work visa whilst in the USA - entered on a ESTA,I am a UK Citizen - I lived in MD for three years with my parents as a child (ARMY). I now live in the UK permanently.   I have entered the USA on a Visa Waiver Program. I have found a small town  company whom has requested I work for them for 6 months. Am I able to apply for this visa whilst in the USA already? Or will I need to return to the UK and apply there?   Which visa do I need to apply for &amp; what are the chances of it being approved? I have just finished university in the UK and have a permanent residency in the UK. My parents are able to fund me completely and I have friends here I am able to stay with.   I am stressing as I am aware I can only stay 90 days.  Any help would be fantastic as I cannot afford an immigration lawyer myself.  
1575,Employers right in Germany,I am in a critical situation. I was working for an employer since last 11 months and then I left them to start with a new employer. My previous employer had issued me a blue card and on a green paper (Zusatzblatt) the employer name is written with certain conditions.  1). Now I have already started working for a new employer and then afterwards I have informed ABH about my employer change. Did I did the right thing or should I had informed them earlier before starting the employment with new employer ?  2). My old employer is asking me again and again about my new employer name and my start date with them. Do they have any right to ask me any such questions ?  Thanks in advance for your answer. 
1576,Extending Working holiday visa to Work visa,"I'm currently in Germany on a working holiday visa, and have received a job offer, for which I need a work visa/blue card. Since it's impossible to get an appointment at the Auslandebehorde any time soon, I'm looking for ways to start working ASAP.  I remember reading recently on a forum (can't find the link now unfortunately) about someone who managed to extend/change their working holiday/language visa to a temporary working visa, on which they could legally work, until they got their blue card.  I was wondering if anyone can confirm, or has had a similar experience?  bonus question: is it possible to work full time on my WHV until I get my blue card? "

Am I allowed to work on a WHV, of course with paying full taxes etc? "
1578,How to reapply for Canadian working visa (IEC) after rejection due to not submitting a document?,"I have applied under one of my nationalities that had more favourable applicants/spots ratio. I received the invitation and have completed and submitted the application to my knowledge.  My issue came with having to submit form IMM5257B stating past countries I have been to. I have filled in the form and submitted it, website was very buggy and I couldn't initially submit it so I stated my problem in the communication form and sent along with the IMM5257B form.  Few days later I got a message saying that the form has not been submitted and to resubmit it with additional 5 years worth of visited countries. Letter stated that:  Failure to provide said document or a status update of your efforts to acquire said document, will result in your application being refused.    Now here I should have gotten the clue that something wasn't correct, but I brushed it aside and assumed that the wording was unimportant and simply they just required it resubmitted (rather than submitted) with additional countries that I have visited.    So I did it all again, and to my surprise I got a message yesterday that my application has been rejected due to not submitting the IMM5257B form. This had me baffled as I was sure I logged in and uploaded the updated document. I have messaged them via the portal stating what happened again and how I believe I have submitted everything, but I assume such immigration decisions are usually final and when they are not it's because a lawyer is involved. At the end it stated that:  You are welcome to reapply if you feel that you can respond to these concerns and can demonstrate that your situation meets the requirements. All new applications must be accompanied by a new processing fee.   Is there a known mechanism of contacting someone who is part of the immigration visa approval process and can look into me having actually at least sent them a message with the required document?   Assuming I'm just an idiot and each time I just didn't press some sneaky hidden submit button on a totally not glitchy page not suffering from random downtime, I still have submitted a request stating my problem with the portal and attached the needed form.   Can I reapply again and pay again or is would that require me getting another invitation to apply, as this one is already lost?   I don't mind paying that hefty fee once more, but this would likely be impossible, as you get only one invitation per nationality per season.   If that's the case could I reapply with another one of my citizenships?    I would like to get IEC as soon as possible and I'm curious whether that is an allowed maneuver. I failed at getting the visa on one passport so I could reapply with another passport in the same yearly window. Something has changed for that country's pool and there is a lot of spaces so I'd say I am guaranteed to get a place.  To resubmit it with secondary citizenship I would have to withdrew the application that I initially got invited under, if the request I have sent out actually reached someone and it was indeed a system error and I might be given another opportunity to provide the IMM5257B form, guess it wouldn't make a difference since I voluntarily pulled out while waiting to be contacted.  Sorry if my thoughts are a little bit over the show, this whole thing took me by surprise. "

1580,NOC for 1 year student visa. Is it reasonable?,"I work for a company in the software industry. I've been admitted to a Spanish university and I am currently applying for a student visa. The duration of the study program is 1 year. One of the required document is:        A letter from the workplace explaining the employee leave date and the leave approval from the company.      I guess that this document is the No Objection Certificate (NOC).  While I can understand the NOC for a tourist visa or short term visa, I find it unreasonable to ask the company I'm working in to give me NOC for a whole 1 year. Is my reasoning correct ? Should I try to get the NOC anyway or ignore this requirement ? "
1581,Net salary calculation in the UK,"I have a hard time trying to understand how net salary is calculated when you work in the UK.   I have used this calculator to find out my net monthly salary based on the gross amount, and it just gives me one number as my annual net, and monthly net is just annual/12. But in reality it seems to be more complicated: for example,  different tax rates apply depending on how much you have earned so far this year.

1582,Evidence for continuous residence to apply for UK citizenship as a EU student?,One of the requirements for applying for British citizenship through naturalization is:      During the last five years you must not have been outside the United   Kingdom for more than 450 days (about 15 months);   How is that proven as an EU citizen? Does the government already automatically know how long you stayed in the UK for (using their airport records) if you're a EU student?   Or do you need to show your flight tickets?

1595,UK student visa refused but they made an error in calculation,"I submitted an application for a student visa on June 19. I received the decision today which was a refusal. When I read the refusal letter, it says that I need a total of £32,025 pounds for the remaining tuition and maintenance fees.  That is not correct: I'm applying for a PGCE which is one year. It costs £13,920. I already paid £2475, so £11,445 remains; the maintenance fees should be 9 x £1,015 = £9,135. The total I should have in my bank account should be at least £20,580 pounds. My Saudi bank statement shows £23,529 pounds.   I don't understand how they calculated the £32,025 or where they getting it from. Would this means that they made a mistake?

1598,How to prove Means of Subsistence for two years of graduate school in Europe?,"I'm a US citizen who applied for graduate school in Italy this year. I was accepted, but am deferring my enrollment till next year and working this year because I know I won't be able to meet the Means of Subsistence requirement for a student visa in the Schengen countries.  According to schengenvisainfo.com,  you can prove this Means of Subsistence through,     A personal bank statement indicating your financial movements (for at least 3 last months),   Credit card,   Cash,   Traveller’s cheques,   Pay slips,   Proof of employment,   Supporting document to attest sponsor’s readiness to cover your expenses during your stay,   Proof of prepaid accommodation,   Document about accommodation in private,   Proof of prepaid transport,   Other   In talking about my target country, Italy, they only list the required amount of euros necessary in the bank statement. In my case, I would be staying for two years, the length of the graduate program, and so I fall under the category of,     For Stays over 20 days:   The overall amount is 206.58€/person and 118.79€/ two and more persons, plus the daily amount is 27.89€/person and 17,04/ two and more persons.   So if I add that up, and I do hope I'm wrong here, it would come out to me needing (206.58€ + 27.89€ x 730days) 20,566.28€ or $24,538.45 USD in a bank statement. I'm not totally broke, but I'm far from that. I'm going to be teaching English in China for the next year and I definitely won't be able to save up that much money within that time either.  Main question: Do you actually need to prove you have that much money for a two year student visa before going to Italy? And to what extent could you offset lacking that much money by securing an English teaching job beforehand (what I see to be my most plausible solution)?   Relevant questions: What have other people who've applied for a similar visa used to prove they meet the Means of Subsistence requirement? As well, what's been the lowest amount of money you've had listed on your bank statement when submitting for such a visa and not had your application denied? "

1601,Working but not studying with a student visa in Canada,I have a 4-year-long Canadian student visa (issued in August 2014). I have both a French and a Swiss passport and I used my Swiss passport when I applied for my student visa.  I love my life in Canada but don't quite like my studies and I might have an opportunity for an interesting job (in Canada). I know that with my student visa I am allowed to get a job. I don't think I am required to deliver any document to the Canadian government to prove that I am still studying (although the information will be clear on my tax declaration).  Can I freely drop my studies and stay in Canada to work until the end of my student visa? Does it appear like I am lying to the government? Can I get into trouble for that? Does it decrease my chances to later apply for another visa or for permanent residency? 
1602,Moving to France to work and get residency from non-EU country,"I want to settle in France. I am a 39 year old Australian living in Australia. I am single and I have no dependants so I am only concerned about myself in this process.  My understanding of the process is this:   Get a job offer from an employer in France (while I'm still in Australia)   Wait for them to fill in the temporary work permit paperwork and submit it to the appropriate French government department  Fly to Sydney from my home city to apply for a working visa in person   Fly back home  Wait at least 2 weeks for notification of whether the visa was approved or not (could be up to 2 months) If the visa was issued, fly to France and start working! After five years of living in France start the process for permanent residency or citizenship   Alternatively, marry a French citizen and wait two years, but I'm not banking on that!    I have completed a TEFL (Teaching English as a Foreign Language) course so I am qualified to work as an English Teacher, which I understand is one of the easiest jobs to get in France as an English speaking foreigner. I have been in contact with an agency that would hire me instantly... if only I already had a working visa! They employ over 1000 foreigners every year but they don't submit the form for the temporary work permit. Most people they hire are students, who are allowed to work up to 20 hours a week on a student visa. If you want to apply for a student visa you have to do so before your 31st birthday, so I am too old to qualify for that.  The TEFL industry is huge in France, with most jobs being placed in August/September and January. I am planning to go in January if I can get everything worked out. This will give me three months to finalise my life in Australia. I rent a house by myself so I need time to dispose of my car, whitegoods, furniture, books, DVDs, etc. Fortunately, I don't own the house I live in so I don't need to sell it, just notify my landlord giving them sufficient advance notice.  I usually work as programmer in Australia but I am not planning on changing jobs quickly in France. As long as I enjoy what I'm doing, I can live off the income and it's in France I don't mind. I have enough savings that I could support myself for a short time if money was tight. It's probably hard for me to get a programming job in France anyway as French employers are required by law to fill all positions with French or EU citizens if available first.  I am also interested in working in the Netherlands on a short-term basis but not settling there. I mention this only in case there is a way of working in one EU country, then easily transferring to another one.  As far as I can tell, the only option for me is to get a working visa before I go to France (Australians can only be issued French visas in Sydney). I can't go to France to look for work because if I was offered a job I'd have to fly back to Australia and wait at least 2 weeks before being issued a visa, which is not guaranteed. Most of the advice I'm reading online says that to get a job as an English Teacher you need to be in France for face-to-face interviews.  Am I missing some relatively easy way of making this happen? Is there another way I could work in France long-term with a view to staying permanently? "

1605,Moving from Portugal to the UK,"I'm a portuguese software developer and I have the opportunity to work in the UK, more specifically in the south, around Southampton. Here's some info:  I have a wife and kid (18 months old) and my idea is a move with the whole family there. She's unemployed and has a licentiate degree in Child Education but no perspective of work in her area here. She can do any kind of work though and is willing to, even here, so in England even more. She can speak English pretty well and make herself understood, I'm sure daily practice would get her to speak fluently in a couple of months.  My question is, with a single salary (mine) of £40K gross per year (£30K net), is life with my family sustainable there?  My concerns are with the house rents and mostly, the childcare. I hear the prices in England for nurseries / pre-schools is pretty high (even the highest in Europe!). Here in Portugal, our kid attends a nursery for around 60€ (+/- £45) per month and we can leave him at the grandparents, when we have that need, for brief periods of time. In England, we won't have relatives to do that, so nurseries / kindergardens / pre-schools / whatever are a major concern for us now.  In a short list:   is £40K per year enough for a family of three? will my wife have trouble finding a job?  "
1606,Do I need international health insurance in Singapore (moving from EU)?,"Some insurance companies offer ""international health insurance"" for people working abroad.   I might move to Singapore in some time, working for a Singaporean company. Currently I'm thinking about health insurance, and I sumbled across this article:     Expatriates are exempted from CPF contributions and do not qualified for any subsidies except for services in Emergency Department. Thus, it is compulsory to have a good international health insurance. One can acquire such health insurance either through the employer or directly from an insurer, an agent or through an independent intermediary like Expatmedicare.   Source  The company I plan to work for sent me an offer that states:     Medical Benefits:      1) Primary Care (GP) (Outpatient) Medical Claims (only employee) at co-payment scheme of $5 per visit unlimited.      2) Specialist Care   (Outpatient) at co-payment of $15 per visit unlimited for panel visit and standard X-ray and lab test.      3) Hospitalization leave, 46 days as per MOM regulation.   I wonder, who pays for medicine, if I would be prescribed some?  Does it make sense to have additional international healthcare on top of that?    "
1607,Should I open a US bank account for my study abroad?,"I am going to start a year's study in the US, transferring from the UK. I will be staying in San Diego, CA.  In the UK, I currently have a student account with Santander and a general account with HSBC. Ideally, I'd like to use my student account while abroad but fear that I will run into too many costs, such as transfer fees and conversion costs etc.  Would opening a bank account in the US and transferring my money in bulk be beneficial, or would I be better off using my English bank accounts?  I have also heard of an international debit card service that companies like the Post Office run but since seeing the failure that is the Travel Money card, I'm sceptical. Any thoughts on this?    Note that this is a post migration from this post on Travel SE, which was put on hold due to irrelevancy to that site. "
1608,How to renew student visa in France?,"I have two questions:   What docs are needed to renew a student visa in France? some people online claim you need a birth certificate? which i don't think it's right. Assuming, I don't renew my visa, can I stay past it just to travel Europe? or should I exit the Schengen area (say to the UK) and come back as a tourist?   I think the visa time frame doesn't affect your visa-free 90 days period right? I asked this at the consulate and they just said there should be no problem but you know how consulates are. Just want to make sure.  "

1610,Residence/work permit in Germany when working remotely for US company without German subsidiary,"I am a US citizen moving to Berlin, Germany at the end of this month, and I'll be employed full-time by a San Francisco Bay Area-based technology startup, helping them to establish a presence in the European market--essentially a head of operations role. I plan to stay in the region for 2-3 years.   My future employer does not currently have a German subsidiary or branch, and I expect to be paid by the US entity, at least in the near-term. When it comes time to build a team in the region (3-6 months down the line), the company will set up a subsidiary or branch as necessary.   I'll be able to provide all of the required residence permit application materials without issue, and my salary will be more than sufficient for living comfortably in Berlin.   My question is this: will it be possible for me to receive a residence permit if my employer has no German subsidiary, and if so, what sort of permit is the best to apply for? I don't believe that the company will be able to formally 'sponsor' me if there's no German entity, though I'll be able to provide proof of employment, salary, etc.   In terms of background, I have worked in San Francisco in technology for 7+ years, but I am not a software engineer--my background is in product management and partnerships. I have a 4-year college degree as well as a certification in data science from a bootcamp-ish organization.  I have reviewed this thread (Moving to Germany, working remotely for company in US. What sort of visa do I need to stay?) which was helpful but not directly relevant, because the asker was soon-to-be-married to an EU citizen.   Another note, not sure if meaningful: my girlfriend is making the move with me and has received a job offer from a German company that will be sponsoring her residence permit.   Danke! "
1611,Non-EU spouse moving to Spain with EU National together,"I am Ukrainian citizen, with a permanent green card in USA. My husband is Polish Citizen/American Citizen. We want to move to Spain. Everyone is saying I should be entering on Tourist Visa and then applying for residency. But we are having our marriage certificate duly recognized in his home country. Does that give me a right to apply for a different visa now?   We can't apply for reunification for EU family members, because we are both going there for the first time together, and he did not previously lived there and doesn't have (NIE #, address etc.) No Consulate in US would give me direct answers. Do I really need to apply for a tourist visa, or residence visa on my own, providing millions of documents, income etc, when I am already recognized as his spouse in EU? Is there a different visa/or route I should be taking?  Anyone can give some feedback/suggestions/advice on that ?  "
1612,What is the earliest day I can enter USA with H1-B visa (21st or 22nd of September)? Does it depend on the actual work start date?,"I should be able to enter 10 days before the day I'm authorized to start working (October, 1). This should be the 21st of September. Still some sources say that you cannot enter until the 22nd of September.  So, is it 21st or 22nd?  My first day of work will be October, 5. Does this change anything regarding the earliest entry date? "
1613,Do I need to provide a date of departure to apply to a EEA Family Permit in the UK?,"I am a French citizen, married to a Russian citizen, and I live in the UK. She is now filling the application for a family permit, to join me, and once there, she will apply to a residence card to stay permanently with me.  During the application for the family permit, they ask for a duration of stay:  How long do you intend to stay in the UK?  On which date will you leave the UK?   What should she answer to that? A stay of 6 month (the duration of the visa)?   Also, the form asks if she intends to work in the UK. But if she answers ""yes"", could it look suspicious to the agent?  "
1614,"How to get NHS dental care as a new UK resident, EU national?","I am a EU national and UK resident.  I need dental care but no GP care.  I understand that a GP can provide me with an NHS number.  Do I need to register with a GP in order to get an NHS number in order to get NHS-priced dental care?  Or is this not needed, and can the dentist provide me with an NHS number — or do I not need an NHS number at all for dental care? "
1615,Appropriate visa for visiting student research in Australia,I have been offered to join a University in Australia as a visiting student research on a project for 3-6 months (depends on the visa duration).   I am currently enrolled as a    Student in the University in New Zealand with Indian Passport and  staying in India from last 1 month.   What kind of visa do I need for this? I am a bit confused between    Training and Research visa subclass 402 (Occupational Trainee Stream) and  Temporary Work visa (Short stay activity) subclass-400.    Can someone please suggest anything regarding this?

1617,Tier 4 (General) Student visa refusals,"International (non-EU) students must apply for a Tier 4 (General) Student visa in order to study at a UK university. The general (common) reasons for a visa refusal seem to be showing incorrect documents, having insufficient funds or a suspect immigration history, amongst others.  What about smaller issues, like submitting a passport photo that's older than 1 month? Or having a course title on the application form that differs from that in the CAS by one word? Are these issues serious enough to warrant a visa refusal or not?  From De Montfort University FAQ section:     Why could my visa application be refused?      Prior to refusing your visa application, the UKVI will have assessed all the information you have provided with your visa application and any information they have regarding your immigration history, and decided that you did not meet the requirements of having a valid CAS, sufficient maintenance or for other reasons such as your immigration history. You will be issued with a notice of refusal of entry clearance which will state the full reason your visa application was unsuccessful.  "
1618,ECA for Bachelor degree,"I have done Bachelor of Technology course (4 years) from India. Do I need to have ECA for Bachelor degree only or should I have it for my 10+2 i.e. higher secondary as well?

1619,Landlord in Spain Withholding Apartment Deposit,"Earlier this year I moved to Spain for 6 months as part of a work project. While there, I stayed in a rented apartment, which my company paid for. However, I had to pay for the security deposit out of my own money as that was my responsibility.  I've since moved back to the UK and have been repeatedly ignored by my ex-landlord regarding the repayment of the deposit. They've not claimed any repair or redecoration costs (the apartment was cleaner when I left it than when I moved in), they've just ignored the issue entirely in subsequent emails with them.  I feel like I may be chasing a lost cause here as I'm not even in the same country anymore, and land lords the world over seem to get away with screwing tenants out of money. Anyway, does any body have any experience with recovering these costs in a similar situation, particularly Spain?  I should note, I have a signed receipt and also an online record of the money transfer. I may try and get my company to intervene on my behalf if I can, but is there anything else I can try first? "

IBAN replaces local bank account numbers.  A question from 2016 complains that in practice, institutions insist on a local German bank account.  How is this now in 2018?

1622,Is FEA (ZAV) Pre approval mandatory for a software development job in Germany,"I have a job offer from a small software startup from Kassel, Germany. I'm a software developer with 4+ years of experience and have a relevant Degree in Computer Science Engineering.  My Visa appointment is next week. My employer has not filed for FEA approval, nor has he published the job posting to any job portals in Germany. Because I was already working as a freelance software developer (through upwork), the employer directly offered me a permanent position (1 year contract that will be renewed later).   My Questions :   Will not having FEA pre approval affect my visa approval?  My salary is above the blue card norms for IT Specialist category, will this compensate for not having the FEA pre approval? Is it normal to get the FEA approval after entering Germany?   What do you think?  I'm from India btw,  Thanks in advance for any advice "
1623,Marriage visitor visa for US citizens with children,"Obviously I can come in and out of UK as I have done so in the last 7 years. I have entered UK for multiple times and my longest stay was a month. I and my partner would like to get married and since we want to do it right by abiding immigration rules, we are looking at marriage visitor visa since I don’t plan to stay in UK. My question is, I have two children who are US citizens, do I apply for them? If so, in what type of visa? They will be coming with me for the wedding and I’m not sure if they can just enter the UK like how we have been doing without a visa requirement. Thanks in advance! "
1624,UK expat living and working in Spain - switching to freelancing possible?,"I'm an English expat and have been living and working in Mallorca, Spain for the past two years.  I have been contacted by a remote-only software development company who have employees globally, and their HQ is in Australia.   If I were to take a job with this company, what would I need to do to continue living and working here in Mallorca? Would I need to register my own business, pay an accountant to sort out things? I've never worked 'freelance' before, if this would even count as freelancing.  Also, with Brexit potentially on the horizon, could switching from working with a Spanish company to a non-Spanish one potentially jeapordize my chance of remaining in Spain? "
1625,UK spouse visa questions,"I intend to apply for UK spouse visa. My wife is English; she is exempt from financial requirements: she's on Personal Independence Payment (PIP) and Employment and Support Allowance (ESA).   I've known her since September 2017, but we lost our chat history from September through December 2017. We have a lots of pictures of us together, ones from our marriage, and with family and friends.   The problem is that my wife is estranged from her family so I don't have any contact with them. Is that going to be a problem and would the Home Office doubt our relationship?   I am going to apply this November. Is this going to be enough time to prove that we are in a valid relationship?   Additional notes: If I am paying my wife that's to help her because we share everything so I don't think it should be payment to get visa and I said my wife estranged because this factor make it worst. I am going because my wife needs me she is alone there in addition I am English teacher and I work   her friends didn't attend the wedding ceremony we have been together more than 1 year we lost the beginning of our conversation when we still didn't met so I can't cover that period by pictures  "
1626,Do I need Federal Employment Agency approval for a Blue Card in a high salary shortage occupation?,"In Berlin, Germany, the Blue Card requirements says the following:     When engaging in employment         with an annual gross income of at least EUR 52,000 (or gross income of EUR 4,333 monthly) or,   in shortage occupations, an annual gross income of EUR 40,560 (or gross income of EUR 3,380 monthly), and when in possession of a German university or university college qualification,         no approval is required from the German Federal Employment Agency (Bundesagentur für Arbeit).      However, when         holding a foreign university or university college qualification and   engaging in employment in a shortage occupation,         the Federal Employment Agency must provide approval.   The first and second parts seem contradictory.  So my salary is above 52k and I'm in a shortage occupation with a foreign degree.  Going by the first part, it would seem like I don't need approval (income is above 52k - check, no approval necessary). I would expect this part to say ""in non-shortage occupations"" (or some variant of that), if that were true. Since there's no condition, it should apply for everyone above that income.  Going by the second part, it would seem like I do need approval (since both of those things are true).  So... which is it? Do I need approval?  If this question should be asked to some official entity instead, I'd appreciate some advice about who to ask. "
1627,Validity and Use of Carte de Sejour,My husband and I have already received our Carte du Sejour (Passeport Talent) here in France which will expire on 2021. My employment contract with my French employer was not renewed so we're now going back to Philippines. Questions: 1. Can we enter to any Schengen country (other than France) from Philippines using our Carte du Sejour? 2. Will our residence permit be invalid once my French employment contract has been terminated?

My current employer has sponsored my H-1B visa for the year 2019 and it was picked in the lottery process and recently I have received the ""Request for Additional Evidence"".   The point here is, I am not sure whether I would get the H-1B approval or not, so thinking to have a Plan-B to stay in the USA or at least go to Canada to work for like 5 years before going back to my Home country.   What is the procedure for me(considering my current situation) to get a Canadian visa(working)? Can I apply it from here(USA) without travelling back to my Home country? Required documentation would be really helpful. Are there any other viable options for me to stay in USA legally and continue my work without pursuing another degree/marrying some citizen?  Note: I do have one more opportunity to get sponsored for H-1B for next year, but considering my OPT STEM expires by May 1st week, that is like trying to hit a fast moving Plane(at cruising altitudes) from the top of the Burj Khalifa.  Any suggestions are welcome.  "
1629,Visa requirements for children born abroad,"just looking for info as I find the Uk gov website confusing regarding visas for children born abroad and I cannot find anything specific relating to my situation.  I am a British Citizen not by decent currently residing in the Philippines and me and my wife who is a Filipino national have just had a baby boy.  We are wanting to visit the Uk for a vacation next March 2019 by which time the baby will be six months old.  My wife already has a five year visa so have no problem there, but do I have to apply and wait until I can get a UK passport for my son in order for us to visit the Uk?, or can I get my son a Filipino passport in the interim period and apply for a visa to visit the UK while we are waiting for the processing of the UK passport? Having to wait for the issuance of the Uk passport will probably mean we couldn't visit the UK in March due to the processing times.  Any advice please? "
1630,Can I be paid for work I did outside the UK while visiting on a tourist visa?,"I work remotely as a software developer, and am going to visit the UK for 6 months (just by showing my US passport upon entry for a tourist visa since I have never been to the UK before). I have housing accommodations arranged and sufficient finances for my stay there.  I won’t work while I am there (tourist visa requires that I do not), however    I have a few apps that provide me some income. Is it ok for me to receive that income as long as I don’t work on making any updates/bug fixes for these apps while in the UK? Similarly, if I finish some remote work shortly before I leave, sometimes I won’t get paid for a month or so afterwards. Is it okay for me to receive that pay for work I did outside the UK?  "
1631,Emigrate to UK from Argentina,"My Argentinian friend would like to know what to do to live permanently in the UK.   According to gov.uk the coalition government handed over visa responsibility to VFS Global. So is it a case of visiting the website to apply for a working visa or will she have to apply for a job first, be accepted and then ask the company if they have a sponsor licence and then apply for a working visa?  Also whilst working and not leaving the country would permanent residency be granted after 5 years? "

1633,Is it possible to stay in Ireland with a work visa provided by another EEA country?,"Hypothetically, if one were working in Ireland and didn't have time for the disorganized Irish government to sort out a working visa to permit full time work, would a working visa from another EEA country be a possible avenue?  In other words, if a company has subsidiaries in EEA countries other than Ireland could it allow an employee to work in Ireland, even if ""remotely working"" from that country? "
1634,How to avoid fees when making purchases in a different country?,"I asked a similar question here about credit cards:  How can I (a US citizen) set up my bank/money when I move to Portugal?  From the answer there it seems like there are some cards that have no international transaction fees but there is always some sort of other fee(annual fees and hidden fees). I actually found a card that seems to have no fees:  [website]but I can't get it because I live in the US and it hasn't launched in the US yet.  Besides finding a no fees credit card, are there any other ways that I can avoid international transaction fees? What about PayPal? Obviously I could carry a bunch of cash on me but that's probably a little too risky. "
1635,Canada- Is work from home possible in Canada on Intra Company transfer visa?,Is work from home possible in Canada on Canadian ICT visa (Intra Company transfer visa)?   Is it required for the work permit holder to work from an office (work permit location) even if the rest of the team works internationally and the only benefit would be helping the Canadian business and providing better round the clock support.  I am trying to understand the various federal/provincial rules relating to working from a specific location or not while on Work Permit? I could not find any mention about work from home in any of the help sections.  Are there any province specific rules in play? Target provinces are Ontario and BC.

1637,China visa/work permit transfer,"If everything goes according to plan, I will transfer from working for a university to working for a local media organization in January. This is in Beijing. To transfer a work permit, the old employer has to give you a release letter, preferably ~30 days before it expires. My university is going to hold me to finishing my contract (no problem there), but does anyone have experience with transferring the visa at the end of a contract, and you didn't have to leave the country? Does the new employer's HR get you some kind of transitional visa?  I'd like to avoid having to make a totally new visa/work permit application. Right now I'm just making sure I have a good relationship with the relevant people at my university so they are more inclined to be helpful. Do you have any idea what the process would be likely to look like?  Thank you! "
1638,Does holding a Canadian citizenship enable a person to get US H1b / L1 much easier than citizenship from third-world countries?,What are the benefits of holding Canadian citizenship in terms of getting a work permit in US/Europe compared to other third world countries?

I have saved up some money and I would like to use this money in Italy. There is a  chance that I might return to USA after 3 years.   I am not sure what the best way to transfer this money is.  I would like to close my USA bank accounts at some point in time as they are not free (Wells Fargo).   Should I convert my money into euros, store it in a currency card and take it to Italy?

1641,Am I eligible for a UK Ancestry Visa if my British grandparent was born outside the UK?,"I am asking this question for a friend who is an Australian citizen. I have read through the eligibility documents and it seems as though she is not eligible to go through the Ancestry Visa route but we just wanted to ensure we've checked every avenue.  In 1926, her British great-grandparents were working in Egypt (they had been posted there by their employer, a British company) and they gave birth to their son who is my friend's grandparent.  Does the simple fact that his birthplace was outside the UK mean she is ineligible despite the fact that he is a British citizen and spent the majority of his life in UK? Or is it potentially more complicated than that?  For instance, we're not sure how his birth was registered, how soon after they returned to their home, etc...is it worth looking into these details as there may be some potential admin loopholes? Or is it a clear cut case? "
1642,Registering child as a British citizen,"I'm looking to register a UK-born EU citizen child under 10 as a British citizen. He is not a citizen by birth (neither parent was settled at the time). They are both settled now meaning he can be registered under section 1(3) in form MN1.  Neither parent has a permanent residence document issued even through they have been resident for more than 9 years. My understanding is although they acquired it automatically, at least one of them has to apply for the certificate before the MN1 application to prove the child is eligible for British citizenship. Please correct me if I'm wrong.   But, the application mentions:     Date father became settled in the UK (for example, granted indefinite leave to remain)   and     Date mother became settled in the UK (for example, granted indefinite leave to remain)   So, if only one of them applies for a certificate (although both are settled), do I only fill out one of those fields, for the parent that has the certificate with the date they became settled in the UK and leave the other one blank?  Also, I'm confused about this part:     State if and when the child was given indefinite leave to   enter/remain in the UK. If the child’s parent is an EEA national, a   Swiss national or a family member of an EEA or Swiss national   you should ensure that they qualify for permanent residence.    If the child is born in the UK and ordinarily resident for all his life, yet again like his parents, doesn't have a permanent residence document, do I just leave this blank because the application is based on the place of birth and parent's settled status in the UK?  Thank you for taking the time. "
1643,Acquiring work rights in UK,"I possess the following document ""Carta di Soggiorno di Familiare di Un Cittadino Dell'Unione"" (Residence Card of a family member of a Union Citizen, Italy) issued by the Italian authority.

1644,Best water supply in China,"I will move to Nanjing, China in the future. I’m slightly worried about the quality of drinking water and water for cooking etc. What is the best option?   Tap water - almost certainly a bad idea? as could contain bacteria and harmful pollutants Bottled water. I have heard that even standards for bottled water are poor. Are any brands especially reliable? Is it affordable to use only bottled water? A water filtration system. Can they return tap water to a safe, good standard? Is there a particular type that is suitable for China’s tap water? Do they require much maintainance? Delivery of barreled water for use in a water cooler. This sounds convenient, but are the suppliers reputable?  "
1645,Websites which offer a comparison of loans in Austria not in German,"I'm Italian, and I've been living in Austria for seven months. Since I don't speak German, I need some help finding a website for loan terms comparison in Austria preferably in Italian.  I've found a wonderful website which makes this kind of comparison but unfortunately it's only for Germany: [website]I've tried to find it via a Google search but it is not exactly what I was looking for.  the problem is that for me is like Arabic.. in Italy we have TAN and TAEG interest tax. The second is comprehensive of everything (insurance, expenses, and so on). - In Austria (?). A good answer could include at least one example.. "
1646,A EU remote worker operating via a LLC in the USA,"I'm currently based in Germany (but originally from another EU country) and will be working remotely as a software developer for a US company on and off for a few months in a year. They suggested that it might be easier (for various purposes) to open an LLC in Delaware or Nevada. Its convenient for them and it lets me retain the freedom to move around as much as I like + it might even to some extent be cheaper tax-wise paying taxes over there (if I pay taxes in the US - double taxation agreement means that I would not have to pay them again in Germany right?).  The problem is I'm not really sure what the overhead is in having it go through an LLC. Not worried about smaller expenses here (like opening the LLC, franchise/tax/agent fees) - but am not really sure how to tax my personal earnings and at what rate? The confusing thing is that when I'm reading about Nevada LLCs online - it says no personal income tax? Does that mean that I'd pay 0 in taxes (to the IRS) when getting the money out from the LLC to me? That can't be right.  Let say the LLC makes 75k USD - how much out of that could I really get after tax? (bare in mind that I'm sitting in EU so there will probably be 0 deductibles) "

1648,Working remotely until I get visa,"My question is pretty basic and tough at the same time. A US company just offered me a job and will apply for my H1B also. But thing is that they want me to work for them as a full time employee in my current location before they get the visa approved. The pay is obviously less than what I will be getting in US. Should I accept the offer ?.  What If they don't issue H1B because they would be getting the work done in alot cheaper when I am here.  And one more thing, they say they can only apply for Visa in next Fiscal year i,e October because the Visa cap is closed, is it true ?  "
1649,Tax refund after leaving Germany,"I am Italian and last year I worked 6 months in Germany. Therefore I paid the taxes in Germany. I have heard that if you stay in Germany less than one year you may reclaim the tax refund. Is it true? If this is the case, how can I achieve it? I worked at a university: who/what should I ask for it? I have all required document (tax statements)    I have seen there is already an open question on StackExchange (German tax refund after moving abroad), but it does not helps me out with my problem.

1650,Am I eligible to migrate as skilled worker?,"I am 28 years old, Brazilian and I graduated last year (February 2013, to be more exactly) as a Bachelor in Computer Science. I'm reading about the migration process and I want to migrate to Australia for example (but I also considered other destinations as well).  I've read some news about the need for skilled people in my area (technology - software developer), recently.    I would like to know: Am I eligible to migrate as a skilled worker?  Is it necessary to have more years of work experience in the area?  Is there an other way to migrate to these countries? My point is that I have a Bachelor in Computer Science, and that should mean something, right?   I'm working in the area some 3 years already, mainly as a freelancer, but from this officialy only for 9 months (since I finished the college), and I had to quit because of my mom health problems.    Is there any hope for me? "
1651,Until what date do you have to pay rent in France when vacating a flat?,"As I came to understand, when you are vacating a flat in France, there can be many key dates:   The date on which you would like to leave, that you write in your letter, The actual date that corresponds to the date your letter was received plus three months, and The date when you hand back to keys and make the ""état des lieux"".   As for my specific, I moved out on 2 April, so I sent my letter by registered mail on 1 January. But La Poste being what it is, or maybe it's just that my landlord wasn't home on 2 January, the receipt shows that the letter has been received on 3 January.  The landlord later contacted me and told me he wouldn't be available for ""état des lieux"" on 3 April, and gave me an appointment on 6 April. We agreed that I wouldn't pay the partial rent for April and that would be deducted from my deposit.  In those circumstances, should I have to pay rent until the 2nd, the 3rd or the 6th? I for one thought I would have to pay three days in April, but my landlord has charged me for five. Can someone explain why five? "
1652,What should I specify in an invitation letter for parents and siblings visiting UK?,"My wife's parents and siblings are planning to visit my family in the UK. We are all Indonesians by nationality. They need to apply for family visitor visas, and one of the documents I need to supply them is an invitation letter.    What do I need to specify in this invitation letter?  Do I need to write one letter for each visitor or can it be combined? Who should sign the letter? Is it I, my wife, or both of us?  "
1653,How can I begin my career abroad?,"I'm from Malaysia, 21 and my B.s.c in computing is expected to complete next year. I can speak English and Mandarin. How do I start my career abroad? What is the best place for computer science guys? "
1654,No last name on documents,I plan to apply for my MS degree in Europe or the United States. The problem is that my name – written in English – becomes a single name with no last name.  Persian: حسیب الله English: Haseebullah  My passport and all my degrees and certificates bear my name in this format. All the forms for visa and university admission on paper or online makes it mandatory to give a last name.   What should I write in the last name section? Will it affect my chances of admission and visa if I have a single name?  
1655,Can a non-EU citizen with a EU partner live and work in the EU?,"I'm a South African citizen and have been in a relationship with a Polish girl for 8 years.  We have been living in South Africa most of this time - over 6 years now - but we would like to move to Europe, probably not to Poland itself.  How do I go about this?  I've been looking for employment in countries like the Netherlands, Germany, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland (not EU I know) and Spain but it seems companies are very reluctant to hire a non-EU citizen.  Would it be easier to get some kind of spousal relationship permit and look for a job whilst in the EU and in possession of such a temporary visa? "
1656,Reclaiming Social Security Money from EU when relocating?,"As an Indian national residing in Spain for 6 years, I have been paying a lot towards Social Security (health, unemployment &amp; pension). Now am deciding to resettle in India forgoing any future interests towards living in EU. Is there a way to reclaim a part  of the money (that towards pension) I have paid as social security ?   Are there ways for better tax reclamation as well ? "
1657,"Getting a UK Provisional (learners) driving license, as a newly arrived EU Citizen?","From the Can I drive with my EU driving license in United Kingdom? question, we know that a newly arrived EU citizen with an EU country issued full driving license is fine to drive on it in the UK. From this question on Travel.SE about learners permits, we know that the same rules don't apply to provisional / learners permits, and they're not normally valid abroad.  If you were an EU citizen without a full driving license, newly arrived in the UK, and you wanted to continue to learn to drive, it therefore seems that you'd need to get yourself a UK provisional (learners) license, then use that to continue your learning.   What's the process for getting one as a someone newly arrived in the UK from elsewhere in the EU? What documents do you need to get hold of first? And what process do you have to follow to apply? "
1658,Will US Embassy verify identity with and without middle name?,"I am a US citizen and have run into difficulties abroad regarding some documents containing my middle name and some without. I was given 10 days to get a 'declaration from the embassy' that 'First Last' is the same person as 'First Middle Last'.  I looked through the embassy website and I can find nothing about whether they would issue such a declaration. There is a consular appointment just before the deadline is up, so there is one chance to get it.  Does the embassy issue declarations like this? I have a passport with one name and a DL with the other. Will that be enough? "
1659,Do USA citizen working as a contractor in Canada need to register anything in either USA or Canada?,"I am an American citizen who will be working in Canada for 3 months as a contractor/freelancer. I already have a contract. This is my first time working as a non-salaried employee. Is there anything I need to do in the US (e.g. register myself or set anything up) before I start my short term work in Canada?  I’m also in the process of applying for the NAFTA professionals working visa and it asks for evidence of company relationship. Since I won’t be working for a US company (just as a freelancer on my own), do I actually need to provide this/what do I need to provide? "
1660,Credit card when new in Germany,"I've lived in Germany for 5 months and I am employed full time with an above average salary.  I've applied for a regular credit card (via Consors Finanz) but I was automatically denied¹, which does not surprise me.  When I lived in Canada, I had a secured credit card where I put 500[tex] limit, which I found rather low but was later raised to 500[tex] (requiring me to raise the fixed savings account to $1250).  When I lived in the UK, I had a ""rebuild your credit"" card with a 59% APR, which didn't bother me because I always pay off in full, and a £250 limit (later raised automatically).  Are there similar products in Germany?  I need a credit card so that I can rent cars (and some other items).  I've found Kreditkarte ohne Schufa but it's not clear to me whether those are real credit cards that will help for things like rental cars.  I already have a prepaid multi-currency Mastercard debit card.  May I have better luck getting a credit card through my Sparkasse (which has a monthly fee)?    ¹   After filling my details such as address and income and agreeing to a Schufa check, after a couple of minutes the credit card website replied with:         Leider können wir aktuell Ihrem Kreditwunsch nicht entsprechen.

1661,Infant of American father/German mother: Is it possible to travel by air to USA on German passport with visa waiver?,"Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on my situation.   I am an American citizen by birth who now has a baby with a German woman. The baby was born in Phillipines. With official documents, including the Phillipines (NSO/PSA-authorized) Certificate of Live Birth with Apostille from Dept of Foreign Affairs, and German kinderreisse (aka child’s passport), we were able to travel to German.  And so, here we are in Germany.  My partner (out of wedlock) and infant son will travel to USA to meet my parents. They both have German passports, and are prepared to attain an ESTA.   Question 1: is it REQUIRED that my son attain an American passport in order to go to the US?  Question 2: We did not report the birth to US Consulate in Phillipines. As we are now here in Germany, I am considering filing CRBA. I want to know if anybody has experience filing CRBA in a country which the baby was not born. As we are now in the process of attaining a German birth certificate, it seems that it will not be finished before we need to file CRBA. And, of course, we have an official Phillipines birth certificate which we could use to file CRBA. Is this possible to use, the Phillipines birth certificate, rather than the German?  Question 3: if someone is a dual citizen, must they always possess a passport from both countries while traveling internationally? "

1663,How can I drive a US purchased and financed car in Canada for 2 years?,"I am moving from US to Canada.  I hold a Canadian work permit and will work in Ontario for 2 years.  I've recently financed a car in the US and I'd like to bring it to Canada.  I'm aware of the fact that my vehicle is exempted from RIV registration, because I meet the ""Temporary Importation"" conditions.   My questions are:   As my car is financed, does it still meet this exemption condition?  Should I get any authorization from the lender and provide in Canada?  Am I allowed to get car insurance in Canada for my car?  Is it necessary to register this car in Canada while financed in US? "
1664,Working remotely for a foreign company while a student in Japan: dealing with Japanese taxes,"I'm going to start graduate school in Japan soon, and there is a remote job that I might take, which I will bring to Japan. I understand that there's a debate about whether this constitutes work, but since students can apply for leave to work up to 28 hours per week, there should be no grey areas in this zone.  However, how shall I deal with the taxes? I assume I need to report my taxes: should I just do it like any other Japanese freelance/remote worker? "
1665,How fast can my spouse get her green card based on my green card?,"I'm not a US citizen, I received my GC in June 2018. My girlfriend is Chinese citizen and studies in US.

On the web site travel.state.gov here Visa Bulletin shows ""C"" or ""current"" under the application category F2A. Does it mean that if the marriage happens now we can file all documents immediately and can get GC really fast? "

1667,Brexit: what happens to an EU citizen signing for a UK job now?,"I haven't been able to figure out what's the status of an EU citizen signing up for a UK job now, starting sometime in the future, if the company is not able to provide Visa sponsorship.  In particular,    What happens if Brexit happens between the present moment and the actual start date? What happens if Brexit happens sometime after the actual start date but before all the paperwork is in order? Is it possible that the EU citizen will have to give up the job?   What are the risks that one runs by signing up for a UK job now? "
1668,Moving to another EU State with a Blue Card,"If I move to another EU member state, do I need to create a new Blue Card for that country, or my current Blue Card should be good to go?  I find it confusing that it seems that the whole idea of the EU blue card is to have a unified document which I can use in all participating states, but if I have to make an entire new one every time I switch countries, the whole idea seems odd to me.   In the case I have to create a new Blue Card, does the fact that I currently hold one make any difference, or the process is the same as if you did not have one to begin with? In the case I don't need to issue a new Blue Card, I noticed that there are differences of the minimum required income you should have to get a Blue Card of that country. If you switch countries, does your income needs to also match the minimum requirement of the country which issued the Blue Card, or the new hosting country?   Note that I am close to complete 2 years of tenure in my current job already. "

I've already prepared all the legal documents. However, I'm really concerned about the consulate interview as it's gonna be in a different country, because there's no German embassy in my country.  What kind of question they will ask (the general purpose of their question about what)? Dose the fact that I have to make the interview in different county add more challenging to these questions? Will they ask to provide additional documents to the ones listed on the consulate website?  If someone has similar experience, it would be appreciated if he/she could share it with us, as I'll do. "

I currently live in Germany as a student and I hold German citizenship. The freelance job requires me to go only once a month for 4-5 days to the office.  The company is a tech company and I would be doing some tech + marketing job.  Do I need to pay taxes in Germany or in the Netherlands?

1673,Inter-Country Civil Partnership Recognized?,"As a follow-up to my question a couple of days ago on which visa I needed to move to Scotland, I've completed my visa application providing for a civil union within 3 months of my arrival.  However, in the application there was absolutely no mention of the fact that civil unions, at least in the UK, are only for same-sex couples.  (Sorry, Martin Bonner, I didn't listen to what you said because I'd done so much research and never seen a thing about this.)  So my quandary is this: if John and I go to another country for a civil union, will UK immigration accept it?  And will I even be allowed to leave Scotland to have the civil union performed within my first three months there?  It's Friday afternoon.  I've called the attorneys in my family, our solicitors in Scotland, and don't know where else to try.  I have an appointment Monday to get my bio-metric card.  If all else fails, I'll cancel that and get a refund on my visa app.  I fly out Oct. 1 - hope that happens. "
1674,"Denied entry to UK in 2009, can I apply for a student visa in 2019?","I was denied entry into a UK airport when I was a student in UK in 2009. My college then was not on the list of providers, and I had admitted to UKVI after they pressed me that I had not attended college since my last visa application for leave to remain in UK. The immigration officer said I had used deception in my last application for leave to remain.  I was removed at port at UK airport and my residence permit retained. That was in 2009. Now in 2019 I wish to make a tier 4 visa application from India.  This time in 2019 I have received an unconditional offer in MSc mechanical engineering from a top 3 UK university. So apart from the negative feedback can anyone give me a ray of hope? Also what can I say about my historic old denial at port in 2009? "

I have a 2 years BA degree sometimes also referred to as Associate Degree. There are 2 questions I'm not sure about:   I've been told I'm not eligible for a blue card but this should suffice for a Work Permit? My field of study and my field of work are different, but I have 5 years of demonstrable experience in my field of work, is that ok?   I'd like to add here that I had to drop out of my bachelor's after 3rd year because of poor grades. I love software development but just wasn't good academically.

The application process was rather quite simple and easy, but I'm quite confused about one of the documents that they're asking for.  I needs to bring a ""The Passport or travel document for the sponsor (my husband) from British Citizen"" I have no idea what they could be asking for since I'm clearly requesting an EEA Family Permit and wouldn't be able to do so if I was a British National. I also clearly stated on the application form that I was a Dutch National.  Any clues to which document they're asking for? Is this a mistake?  Thanks in advance "

1681,Buying a property in France when living in the UK,"I am French, but have been living in the UK for the past 20+ years, where I pay all my taxes. Recently, I have inherited a small amount of money in France from my late grandparents, which I would like to use as a deposit to buy a flat in France with my wife (who's British), as an investiment property (for letting).   However, the bank is imposing some draconian restrictions which in practice means they won't lend money to us because we can't meet their requirements of minimum income or personal wealth. Apparently, this is because we are ""non residents"", i.e. don't pay our taxes in France, and they claim those restrictions are imposed on them by the UK government, not of their own choosing. It's not clear whether it's their interpretation of whatever regulations/restrictions are in place or whether their hands are really tied. I have done some searching on the Internet but came up blank. I have also contacted the UK embassy/consulate in France, who were unable (unwilling?) to answer my questions.  Does anybody know what restrictions are imposed by the UK on French financial institutions for lending to non-residents? I have only approached one bank so far, the one I've been with all my life. "

I resigned from my previous employer (Thai based) as I got a better opportunity and gave them my notice period.  However previously I submitted to them my passport for a Schengen visa to the company travel co-coordinator. When I asked for the passport they kept saying it is not with them as it has been forwarded to the embassy for visa processing. But from internal resources I came to know that it was never submitted for any visa and it was still with the employer. When I pressured them to return my passport, they said it still has a valid USA visa (B1/B2) and you cannot enter the USA on this visa for another company to work as it was issued through them.  I forced them to return my passport. But they removed the U.S. visa stamp/sticker which was in it. I asked them for it and at first they kept saying that they didn’t know about it. Later they said they disposed of it as they couldn't allow me to utilize this visa.  Is my visa no longer valid, as my previous employer stated?

I tried looking on the website of the town I am going to register but it is all written in German only. "
1692,What are the import charges or fees moving to the USA?**,"What are the import charges or fees moving to the USA?  Short Question:   I will be moving to the USA on a K-1 Fiance(e) Visa in December, to then get a Green Card. I will be flying with some luggage in the plane, the rest will be surface shipped. It will be leaving the UK about a fortnight before I leave, and arriving in the US about a fortnight after I arrive. What will I have to pay to get my belongings over the border?  Full Question:  Visa Context  I have my interview date for a K-1 Fiancé(e) Visa in November and have a provisional wedding date with my lovely bride set for the end of December.   (Why so little time? The medical process took more than two months longer than usual which is why the timescale seems a little short - under normal circumstances the interview would have been around September. We applied for the visa and decided on the wedding date during Winter 2015-16, the alternative was Summer 2017. Winter 2017 was a reasonable date and we still have time despite about 10 weeks unexpected delays.)   However, this question is not about the visa or the heavy visa charges (several thousand in-all). If the interview fails, the shipping company to not charge for cancelling or postponing shipping provided they have over 10 days notice before the pick-up date.  Shipping Contents  I am planning to ship approximately £4,500-£5,000 worth of my personal belongings. My provisional estimate for valuation is as follows:     Musical Instruments (£3000)   Guitars (£200 electric, £670 electric, £280 electro-acoustic, £800 electric bass), each in a hard case worth £80,   Keyboard (£250),    Electric Guitar Amplifier (£250),    Effects Pedals (£75, x2),    Cables, stands, etc. worth approx. £100      Books (£800)   Approximately 10 antiques, 10 academic textbooks, and 10 hardback rulebooks, with detailed valuations totalling £500, plus about 100 mundane second-hand paperbacks (estimating £3 value each to replace)      Clothing (£375):   Approximately ten T-shirts (£5 ea), ten shirts (£15), five trousers (£15), five warm tops (£20), approximate value      Other (£236):   Three Antique/Ornamental Swords (the shipping company have confirmed they will take them), worth £81 together but the old auction valuations need updating as some restoration has been done.,    Box files with printed material, papers and writings from my hobbies, education, and personal stuff (letters, birthday cards) etc., approximately twenty boxes, valued at £5 each (cost to rebuy blank paper and empty box files),  One beautiful handmade scrapbook made by my sweet bride, valued at £30 (the raw materials)      Media (£175):   Approx. 10 CDs, 5 DVD sets, 5 PC Games, approximate values.   I will be taking insurance with the shipping company's partner at a cost of 4 or 4.5% of the total value for my items, which covers partial and total damage, loss, theft, etc., which is comforting. I include this detail above in case it is relevant. For example, if printed matter has no duty, but musical instruments do.  Shipping Company Information  The company terms and conditions state:      Our quotation, unless otherwise stated, does not include insurance, cancellation/postponement waivers, customs duties, port charges including (but not limited to) demurrage, inspections, or any fees, or taxes payable to government bodies or agencies.   Emphasis mine  The quotation from the shipping company includes:     UK Export Documentation and UK Customs Electronic Filing Fees £39.00.      USA Customs Clearance and advance Homeland Security Filing Fees £120.00   Customs information  I have found this:     You may import furniture, dishes, linens, libraries, artwork and similar household furnishings for your personal use free of duty. To be eligible for duty-free exemption, the articles must have either been available for your use or used in a household where you were a resident for one year. The year of use does not need to be continuous, nor does it need to be the year immediately before the date of importation. ([website]So I assume by books will come under that - if I can prove that they were in my household use for a year. (How on earth DO I prove that? Will I be asked to?)  The same link describes ""Tools of the Trade"" as being duty free.  Can I count my music kit as ""tools of the trade""? I do not use them to make a living. My day job is actually a preschool assistant, music is a hobby I'd one day like to get paid for (I've only gigged for free and not recently). I am about to begin playing regularly (unpaid) in my church as part of the worship team, too. Does that make a difference? I have some free demos out online and have done unpaid gigs with friends before - do they count now?   What if, in the next few weeks, I recorded and released an album and put it out available to buy? I actually already have recordings, I've just haven't released them (yet). If I released some music commercially, could they then be tools of the trade?, or would I have to be doing it full-time to count?  Bottom Line  What Customs Duties and Port Charges, or any other similar costs such as taxes, could I incur, in the circumstances and for the items I will be shipping?  Many thanks "

1694,European bank account,"I am looking for a good bank account with mobile banking. I move a lot and have clients from e.g. Spain and Italy. I am an EU citizen and mostly move around the Eurozone. There is no point in opening n bank accounts in n countries, since I would not be able to keep track of it.  I prefer EUR and SEK accounts, since these currencies are AFAIK fairly stable. I was thinking about using PayPal or an equivalent to receive my salary, but that would feel rather uncomfortable, I think. Most companies are obliged to keep track of their spending, therefore they require some kind of bank connection if you want to come work for them.  I heard about Nemea Bank and similar institutions taking the innovative approach, but some of them seem... unreliable.  [website]What's your experience with that? Any sensible recommendations? "
1695,Study Abroad - When can I move to France?,"My girlfriend and I want to study abroad in France. For both of us it's one of those bucket list things. We're planning to leave in the Spring of 2018. I will be 30, and she will be 31 at the time of our departure. Both of us are US citizens. I plan on going to a University for my masters and she will do a PhD program. In our ""dream"" phase of this planning we wanted to leave early say April and do a bunch of traveling in Europe before our classes start. Now that we've been researching this plan we're not too sure that we will be able to do this.  From usa.campusfrance.org it states:  Campus France Step By Step Visa You must schedule an in-person appointment at your assigned consulate via its official website. The consulate website features an online calendar that shows available timeslots.  Appointments for visa applications are available in the morning only. Your visa appointment must take place no more than 90 days before your departure to France.    According to the application for the French Consulate in Washington DC, US:  French Consulate Washington DC Application The starting date of the visa cannot be earlier than 3 weeks before the starting date as written on your official letter of enrollment.   So it seems like the earliest we can fly to France is 3 weeks prior to classes starting. So I have two questions:   I can make my appointment 90 days prior to my departure date. With processing, say I enter France 60 days before my start date. Will I be able to do this with a short term visa and then it would seamlessly transition to my student visa?   or can I do this?   Sign up for Summer French Classes at the University I plan on attending for my academic studies and get my visa set for an earlier date. I will plan so that I start classes in June, but I've seen courses that are only a couple weeks long. So could hypothetically take the rest of the summer off and travel? According to Campus France this sounds like a possibility:    Campus France Step By Step Visa If you plan to complete two consecutive programs (such as a program in French as a foreign language, followed by an academic program), obtain admission to both programs before applying for your visa. That will ensure that your visa will be valid for the full length of your period of study.  "

1698,"Can I buy a car in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, and take it to Turkey?","As a Turkish citizen, would I be able to buy, insure, and register a car in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq? Luxury vehicles (and the petrol/gasoline prices) are much less expensive there than in Turkey.   When I enter on my Turkish passport, the passport stamp says that you have to visit the Directorate of Residence within 10 days of entering the country. Does that mean you're allowed to purchase a vehicle, too?  It is possible to take the car with you when you return to Turkey?

1709,In need of some answers about returning to the US,"I have a particular situation. I entered the US with a 3 month-stay visa in 2004 and stayed there until 2013. I don't remember the exact date I entered the US; I was probably 14 years old, since I started high school there. I renewed my French passport in the US in 2013 in order to return to France, because I was tired of being an immigrant with no papers/visa. I also wanted to see my close relatives after being apart 9 years away. Now that I am back in France, all I think about is returning to the US because life in France isn't what I expected. I got used to the American way of life and I miss it a lot. I didn't graduate from high school; I left and went off to work in a fast food restaurant.  They didn't even stamp my passport when I came back to France, so my passport is as clean as water, nothing on it. Don't know if that helps or not so just wanted to point that out.  What can I do to go back to the US? A friend of mine told me to buy a ticket to the US to see if I can enter the US again? What are some steps for me to check if I can enter the US? I paid to check with ESTA to see if I can, I put the information of my passport and everything but I answered ""No"" to all the questions such as ""have you ever stayed in the US"" and apparently my passport's good to go since I got authorization to enter the US from ESTA.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.  P.S : I was not arrested nor did anything out of the ordinary P.S 2 : I left the US willingly by myself. "

1712,"EU citizen, permanent resident in UK, applying for British citizenship","I'm a EU citizen living in the UK since 2001. In 2014 I obtained the permanent residency certificate for EU/EEA citizens, using application form EEA(PR). This form asks to prove whether the applicant fulfils residence requirements in terms of presence in the UK. Specifically, it asks to list all travel in the five years prior to the application and sets a limit to the number of days spent outside the UK. Specifically, these are: ""To satisfy the residence requirement you should not have been absent for more than 90 days in the last 12 months. And the total number of days absence for the whole 5 year period should not exceed 450.""  I fulfilled these requirements and obtained a permanent residency permit. I believe that once permanent residency is acquired, one is able to travel in and out of the UK without restriction, provided the absence period does not exceed 2 years, in which case the permanent residency status is lost.   From July 2014 to September 2015 I have attended a graduate course at a EU university. During this time, I have come back to the UK only sporadically. I have been back in the UK since September 2015 but I have since travelled extensively within the EU.   I would now like to apply for British citizenship. Section 2 of the AN form asks the same information that I needed to provide for the permanent residency application. It also asks, for EU/EEA citizens, to provide the details of the permanent residency permit.   My questions are:   As a permanent resident, do I need to provide this evidence, even    though the permanent residency status allows me to travel in and out of the UK without restrictions? As I studied abroad and I have also travelled extensively, I may not meet the residence requirements set out above. However I do have    a permanent residency status. How is this apparent conflict resolved?   I have searched extensively, but I haven't been able to find any clarity regarding the above, expecially point 2.  Additional comments  Thanks for the great answers below and in the comments.  I can see how, formally, there may not be a conflict between the PR and the citizenship's residence requirements, but I still cannot get my head around the following:   PR and citizenship are not handled by different government departments. Both applications go to the Home Office. It's the Home Office that decides in both cases. The residence requirements are the same for PR and citizenship I have fulfilled the PR requirements and I have had a PR certificate since 2014 confirming that. Given that i'm one person, how could I both be permanent resident and not permanent resident at the same time? The PR application and citizenship application for EEA/EU citizens have now been directly and explicitly linked by the Home Office by asking for the PR certificate to be obtained before an application for citizenship can be made. The number of the certificate is asked for in the citizenship application form. What is the purpose of that if the same requirements need to be proven again?   Perhaps i'm just not getting some finer points of the law, but this  still seems like an inconsistency to me. I suspect it may just be one of those bureaucratic inconsistencies that just have to be accepted. "

I'm not an expert on immigration but is the employer allowed to do this and sponsor her for a visa (she told me they'd sponsor her for a H1B, Google-ing tells me it's a specialist US visa).  Is it not allowed for the club to offer to sponsor her, they said they liked the fact she'd had 13 years of experience in lap-dancing (not counting a short 6-momnth stint as a car saleswoman) and really wanted to employ her and have invited her for interview in mid-September in New York (around Manhattan, IIRC).  My sister wants to take the job but is unsure of the practicalities about immigration to the US, employment etc.  Can anyone please explain what she'll need to do to actually get the job, and also, is the employer breaking any US laws I know of? I know over here we couldn't employ any US citizens for this sort of job because the job has to go to British or EU citizens first.  I've Googled the club she mentioned and it's genuine, gets good reviews, so this job isn't fake, but is it unusual for a lap-dancing club to head-hunt someone via their personal site?  We're currently on holiday up in Edinburgh, using the wi-fi so I may not have time to respond just yet.   Would really welcome the advice! "
1729,I still did not receive my student visa from the Portuguese embassy and my college starts in 9 days. What should I do? Please help,"Hello all and I would appreciate your help!  I applied for a Portuguese student visa around 2-3 months ago to pursue my Masters in Portugal, but I still haven't received any response back from the embassy. (I have gotten the Schengen tourist visa before 3 times.)  My mother went to the embassy yesterday, and they told her that they sent the passport and all my documents to Portugal and the acceptance comes from Portugal and not from the local embassy.  My college starts in 9 days and I am already very scared because I will be pursuing my Masters studies and if I do not get the visa acceptance then all the plans I have made for the next 2 years will be ruined.  Any suggestions or help? Does anyone know if I can contact someone from Portugal who gives the visas and email them about my case? Because obviously, it is not the local embassy that gives the visas, as they explained that they already sent the documents to Portugal and the acceptance or rejection comes from there. They said that they can not do anything about it because it is out of their hands.  I am a Lebanese national also with São Tomé nationality, where I am now. I applied directly to the Portuguese Embassy in São Tomé.  My application and its disposition appear to be stalled somewhere in the pipeline between here and the decision-making hub in Portugal, and the embassy here is unable to get definitive status information.  I need a way to either learn the status of my application or to elevate its priority. What can I do? "
1730,Citizenship limitations for E2 visa,"The company I currently work for is British and I'm resident in the UK but I have an Italian passport. My company wants to bring me to their office in the US with an E2 visa but they believe that they can't do so because I'm not British.  Italy though is included in the list of Treaty Countries, does it matter that the company is British? Is that a real blocker?  Thanks "
1731,Requirements for B1 and L1b visa,"I am an employee of a British company, an IT consultancy that trains and hires software developers to employ them as contractors for their clients.  I am resident in the UK but I have an Italian passport and my company is trying to transfer me for 4/6 months into their office in New York. I am also in the process / awaiting for a K1 (fiancee) visa so my intention is to return to the UK when the new visa is ready and re-enter the States with it.  I can't get initially transferred with an E2 visa (that's the usual mean my employer uses for its employees) since I'm not a British citizen. That means that now my options are:   B1 visa (""Temporary Business Visitor"") - my employer used this with its first transferred employees L1b visa (""Intracompany Transferee Specialized Knowledge"")   Eligibility for B visa:  I intend to stay temporarily, I have proof that I want to return to the UK because I will be issued the fiancee' visa and have to attend the interview at the consulate in London. I could keep my current rent in the UK too if that helps.  Q1: Is it true though that this type of visa is constrained to a single client/address? (being my employer an IT consultancy that would be an issue because I could easily have to change work location)  Eligibility for L1b visa:  I have been working for my employer for more than 2 years and I could say that I have specialized knowledge for my employer since:  -- ""The term specialized knowledge refers to the employee's understanding of the employer company, including its products, services, research, equipment, techniques, management or other interests and its application in international markets, or advanced knowledge of the company's processes and procedures""   -- My employer forged a development process that we use in our projects (they also published two books on this).  Q2: This visa may be the best fit, are there any issues with this given the  described circumstances?  Thanks "
1732,Leaving Germany for 1 year EU Blue Card Status,"I have an EU Blue Card with my wife and two children (they are here due to family reunion) based in Munich.  I have read that EU Blue card is valid for one year if you stay in a non EU country. If you stay longer than 1 year, then it is cancelled.  My questions;  - Is that 1 year time in total for the whole EU Blue Card validity period? For example my wife and children visit their relatives frequently and stay for 3-4 months at each visit. Should i sum all time periods they were out of Germany and check if total time sums up to 1 year or is it 1 year for each visit and nothing to be worried about?   As a EU Blue Card holder, does this rule only apply to me? Are my wife and children allowed stay for any period in a non EU country? Or is it valid for family members also?   Thanks. "
1733,Is there a personal recruiter/agent service in Madrid/Spain?,"Both me and my girlfriend are EU nationals (same country) and recently I moved to Madrid/Spain to work at a big company. For the last several months we are trying to find her a job as well, but given that she has studied Literature and she speaks English and a bit of French, it's proving somewhat difficult and frustrating to be honest.  We have tried applying to all big recruitment/interim companies like Randstad, Manpower, Page, Adecco etc but also private schools for teaching/tutoring etc, however nothing came out of it. We also went to many places/stores/companies and gave her CV, we talked to people, networked as much as possible, but still nothing.  She of course plans to improve her CV by learning Spanish and doing a Masters in something more catchy, but that will take time, so in the meantime what other options are there?   I thought that maybe hiring a personal recruitment agent, who would work with us and help her find something/anything (for a fee of course) would be an option, as they are usually more well connected. So, my question is: how can I find a personal recruitment agent in Madrid/Spain whom we could hire to help her find a job?  PS I have already asked Randstad et al, but they don't provide these kind of services and since they work for the employers, they don't really care that much for another candidate. "
1734,"Minor Crime Record - Visibility, Confidentiality and usefulness of getting it cleared","More than 11 years ago I had a DUI in Italy.   I recently asked documentation about this at the records office in Italy and they stated that my crime is not publicly visible to companies but it is visible to police, judges, airport guards, etc.   1. Soon I will move to the States and since I'll declare this record at my interview at the consulate (one DUI should not create troubles for a K1 visa) will it become publicly visible to US companies during a background check or only to the American police?  2. Does it have any actual value to get the ""crime"" cleared from my record? Is there any actual benefit in spending 2000 euro to clear it if the record will still be visible but just say ""cleared""?  3. Maybe the most important part: if I give ownership of my fiancee visa process to my current employer (they offered to pay the fees and give me their attorneys assistance) will my employer find out about it or can I ask the attorney to keep it confidential? I didn't have to declare the DUI on the forms for the fiancee visa request meaning that I will get the fiancee visa (one single DUI is not an issue). Anyway, I will have to declare it on the forms for AOS (Adjustment Of Status - green card request) so at that point I would still need confidentiality. Is it feasible?  Thanks "
1735,Non-regulated job in Germany - Regular Work Permit for IT Specialists,"In my ZAB certificate, it was mentioned that my foreign degree was not equivalent to a German bachelor's degree ruling me out from getting a Blue card. It was also mentioned that my foreign degree offers employment opportunities to non-regulated professions in my ZAB certificate. I did not find the IT/Software positions on the database of regulated professions in Germany, and I also found links that ""IT Specialist"" jobs do not require a degree.   How can I get a regular work permit on these conditions? What about rules on Federal Employment Agency? Am I only allowed to apply at job postings at their site? Do you know other important things that needed to be considered? "
1736,What should I do if I have misplaced my old expired passports?,"I have misplaced my 2 old expired passports. I have my current passport with me. However, I need the old ones for my Australian student visa application. What should I do? My old passports expired 7 years back and I had kept them with me but now I am not able to find them anymore. I also tried to make a police report but the officer rejected it on the basis that there is no certain date of loss and they do not know where they will look for it. Also, they asked for photocopies of my old passports but I don't have a single copy of it. What should I do now? "
1737,Mother in law leaving to go to home country - wants to visit Jordan - is a visa needed?,Mother in law in June was given a green card (IR5 type - mother of a daughter having a US citizen) back in June.  She visited us and plans to return to Iraq sometime in November.  She has another daughter in the country of Jordan who is staying there temporarily.  Since the country of Jordan neighbors Iraq and she is headed to Iraq she thought it would be nice to visit her other daughter who lives in Jordan.  She plans to stay two weeks in Jordan.  Simple question is does she need to obtain a Visa to go to Jordan?  What are the steps taken if she does need one?  Or is this not needed?  Just as an FYI she is an Iraqi Citizen and as mentioned has a green card (IR5 type).

1740,Singapore PR status and re-entry permit,"I am a Singapore PR since 2013.   Before that, I was studying in Singapore (2005-2011, BEng/MEng). I started working as an engineer in 2011. I left Singapore in 2015 and my re-entry permit will be expiring in March 2018. Since I don't have a job in Singapore my chances of renewing the re-entry permit are extremely low, perhaps nil.  Is there is a chance I can get the permit renewed if I Volunteer to contribute to the CPF? If so, what are my chances?  If my re-entry permit renewal gets rejected, is it mandatory to renounce my PR?  Can I not renounce my PR, and in a few years' time can I come to Singapore, find a new job, and start working? Should I first get an EP pass and go through the process from beginning or I simply apply for a new re-entry permit? "

Now the problem is that the daughter's visa has been refused two times, i.e. when they applied for her visa, it was refused (for the first time, not tourism) and then they tried for a tourism visa (didn't work either, second time refused).  I wanted to help them but I have no idea how. Is there a way to get the baby with her mother? Who can we contact in this regard? Any help will be highly appreciated. "
1742,The visa before German Blue Card,"I applied for a blue card at the embassy of Germany in London. I got a visa for 6 months. The lady working there told me this is temporary and that when I arrive to Hamburg I can collect my blue card.  After arriving here, I sent an email to the local foreign office. They replied saying that I need to ""apply"" for it. And that I need to bring:   Filled application form Passport Biometric passport picture  Rental agreement Confirmation of health insurance Salary slips you got in Germany until your appointment.   My questions are:   Does this mean the decision has not been made yet? Can an Airbnb booking (for 3-6 months) be considered as a rental agreement? Can my wife apply for a worker's spouse visa (i.e. family reunion) while I am with this temporary working visa? (because the appointement for the blue card is after 2 months) Finally, my contract is for one year because I am working on a project. But the company told me they want to keep me after the project. Would a letter showing that the employer intends to employ me permanently extend the period of the blue card at this stage?  "
1743,Fiscal residence without having an address in France,"Here's my situation. Currently I am an expatriate in France doing a PhD and so receiving a salary in France.   As part of a project I will go for 3 months in another country (non-EU) and I will leave my current residence, so I will not have anymore an address in France. Note that I will still receive a salary from France in this period and I will not be paid by the destination country.  The goal is to come back, stay at my friend's place and look for a new apartment once I'm back. I am not sure when I will be back. It could vary between 20 December and 15 January.  Next year, as I've done this year, I will have to specify where I was resident on the 1st of January in the tax declaration (in order to compute the Taxe d'habitation I guess).  So the questions that now arise are the following:   If my friend is hosting me and I specify his address, would he have consequences in the computation of his taxes (i.e., increase or decrease)? (scenario 1 - back before the 1st of January) Which address should I specify if the 1st of January I was abroad without an accommodation? In France? (scenario 2 - back after the 1st of January)  "

1747,Blue-sky contract negotiations with a small US startup - what to put in there?,"I'm an Israeli expat researcher in the Netherlands, and I'm about to get an offer from a tech company based in Texas. The offer will initially be to work remotely, and at some point (probably when/if I'm granted a visa) to move to the US and continue working there. My initial status (employee vs contractor) is yet to be determined, but eventually it's going to be a 'proper' employee.  The company I'm going to work for is very small, so in many senses I'm their first hire and first serious contract where not everything is clear and agreed among friend in advance.   In the initial ""negotiations"" discussion I had with one of them, they assumed we would talk mostly/only about the amount of money to be paid and the amount of equity to be offered (and maybe some schedules). But I obviously brought up several other fundamental issues, such as IP rights, various social benefits, expenses etc. This was met with a bit of surprise, but followed by the realization that much of this needs to be agreed and probably formalized.   So now I'm in a situation where we're discussing what kinds of things to put in the contract. I'm not talking about boilerplate legalistic phrasing of things, but the ""meat"" of the conditions. I'm going to get an offer with a bunch of such terms that the company thinks should be placed in the contract, but I will likely add some of my own.  If this were back in Israel, I think I would have most of everything covered, since I know the labor laws more or less, I know how various things get interpreted, I know what's customary and what's considered outlandish etc. But in my condition it really feels like I'm writing something from scratch which could contain basically anything; and they're not constrained by corporate procedures and past practice.  My questions are, therefore:   Are there templates or sample contracts I could consult, at least for inspiration, that are relevant to my condition? What are some subjects or conditions you think are important for me to place in the contract?  What are some subjects or conditions you think are important for me to avoid having in the contract?  "
1748,Israeli working in the Netherlands for a US company - what's the tax situation?,"I'm an Israeli expat living in the Netherlands and am likely to start working for a US company (registered in the US and has no presence in the Netherlands nor in Israel). To make things even more complicated, during my first months of employment I may or may not move to Israel and then to the US.  Previously I've been employed in the Netherlands for a couple of years.  My questions are:   Which institutions of which states do I need to report to about being employed? Which states would I pay which taxes / tax-like fees to? (personal revenue tax, national insurance / health insurance, other kinds of tax)   Notes:   Eventually I will work as an employee. Initially I think I'll work as an employee but I'm not sure. You can make whichever assumption you like or discuss both options.  "

1751,Australian Skilled Independent Visa - How can I prove I have been employed in my nominated skilled occupation,"I am planning to apply for the Skilled Independent (Subclass 189) visa in the next few years. The Australian immigration page writes that one might get plus points if the applicant has been working in his/her nominated skilled occupation or in an occupation closely related to it.  I have no doubt that if the applicant makes such a statement, he/she has to be able to support it with evidence. My question is - how can this be proven? In my specific case, I don't want my employer to know about my intentions of moving there until it is absolutely necessary. Is there any way of providing evidence of my employment without involving my employer? As a related question, what if I get a new job meanwhile, before applying for the visa? If the only way of proving my employment is to provide papers from my employer then do I have to contact all my previous employers so that the total duration of working in the nominated occupation adds up for the necessary X years?

1756,Working remotely for an offshore company while on a working holiday visa,"I am an Australian, looking to move to Ireland on a Working Holiday Authorization. My question is not taxation related.  Can I possibly work for my company in Australia remotely (over the internet) while living in Ireland on a WHA, or is it a visa requirement to work for a company in Ireland?  I presumed WHA gives one the right to work, but one could technically live there without work too as long as one can prove that they have sufficient funds? But, I read some conflicting information over the internet.  Cheers    Reply from Embassy of Ireland in Australia  There is no legal requirement for  you to work for an Irish based company.  You may need to talk to an accountant about where you will be tax-resident if working for an Australian company remotely in Ireland.  This should still not preclude you from travelling to Ireland on a WHA, the primary purpose of which is for an extended holiday allowing for casual work to support oneself. "
1757,"As an F1 student, what if I'm allowed to work in the US but won't need H1B sponsorship from employers?","Im an engineering grad student under F1 status planning to graduate in 3 months. I haven't started my OPT process but plan to as soon as possible to obtain it by January. On job applications, the following two questions consistently appear:  1) If hired, can you furnish proof that you are eligible to work in the country where the job resides?  2) Will you now or in the future require sponsorship for an immigration-related employment benefit?  I would like to make sure I am not lying by answering 1) Yes and 2) No. The following will justify my answers:  1) Yes, I can furnish proof on the grounds that my OPT will be done by the time I graduate and I can thus provide this proof given a certain timeframe  2) No, I will not require sponsorship after my OPT expires. If the employer judges my work worth an H1B sponsorship, I will gladly accept it, however I do not now, or in the future require the employer to do anything on my behalf. Of course, I would like to have sponsorship but I do not require it.  Please let me know if I am answering these questions truthfully, bearing in mind that any other combination of answers automatically disqualifies my application on the grounds that I require sponsorship.

1758,Australian Skilled Independent Visa - What are the chances of my application getting accepted,"I am planning to apply for the Skilled Independent (Subclass 189) Australian Visa over the next few years.  I have read about the process of applying for this visa on the Australian immigration website, where I have found that the process is basically as follows (correct me please if I am wrong here): the applicant must send an Expression of Interest in which he/she makes statements about several things, such as education, health and character aspects etc. EoI is done online, and has no cost apart from any cost that is from having the necessary documents translated. The applicant has to sum up everything here that he/she can be awarded points for, as described in the pointing table, and these statements must be supported by some sort of evidence. As a result of uploading everything related to EoI, the applicant's points can be calculated, and if he/she meets the point requirement, which is right now 60 points, he/she might be invited for application.  I guess the chance behind the word might differs based on the number of people applying for the same visa with the same nominated skilled occupation, but I am not sure about this, so please verify/correct me about this.  My main question is, after the EoI being revised by the authority, one might be invited to actually apply for the visa, which does have a cost, at the time of writing this, 3600 AUD. However, as I understand this, there still is no warranty of the application being accepted. So what chances does (if the occupation matters, a software developer holding an Bolognean System MSc degree) someone have of having his/her visa accepted? If it is refused, is the application cost lost?  Thanks "

1761,How cost-effective is getting a driving license as a PhD student in the US?,"I am considering getting a PhD in the US (mainly East or West coast universities), and I am debating on the importance of getting a driving license.   I did my undergraduate studies in the UK, where there was an excellent public transport system of buses, metro and trains. As such, I was able to travel to and around Europe, as well as around individual cities, without needing a driver's license at all.   However, I have heard many stories that due to the ubiquity of cars in the US, public transport systems are terrible in comparison to Europe. One of my friends (who also lacked a license) ended up paying over a hundred dollars for an airport transfer to his university, due to the lack of public transport options.   How necessary is a car in the transport of an average American PhD student?  Is it cost-effective to get a driving license solely for the purposes of travelling around the US during the 5-6 years of PhD study?  "
1762,Rights for spouses of EU citizens; French residence permit in a timely manner?,"I'm going to write in first person to make it easier to explain the situation, though it doesn't refer to me.  I am the spouse of an EU citizen (not Croatian), but I am not an EU citizen myself.  We moved to France earlier this year, my spouse has a fixed-term work contract here.  Getting a residence permit is proving to be a nightmare for me.  After more than 5 months I still haven't received it, I am unable to get any information on how long it will take, and the Prefecture keeps being inconsistent in their requirements (they request documents by post that they assured me they absolutely don't need when I brought them in person earlier, etc.).  It is also very hard to deal with them because we do not speak any French, while all their employees who deal with foreigners seems to only speak French and nothing else.  Not having the residence permit means that I cannot travel out of the country (which I need to do to honour family commitments) and I can only get a temporary work-contract, which cannot be renewed indefinitely this I might lose my job.  These things are causing me considerable stress.  Questions:   My understanding is that spouses of EU citizens are entitled to the same treatment as EU citizens themselves:     During their stay in your new country, your non-EU spouse, (grand)children or (grand)parents should be treated as nationals, notably as regards access to employment, pay and benefits facilitating access to work, enrolment in schools, etc.   Under what conditions does this apply?  Is my treatment here in France illegal? (I.e. in practice I cannot get a fixed-term work contract because the residence permit is a requirement, and it doesn't seem like I will get it any time soon. I also don't have freedom of movement.) I have seen comments online that according to EU law the residence permit (of a spouse of an EU citizen) cannot be delayed for more than a certain amount of time.  What is the exact legal situation?  For how long can they delay it? Even if there are EU laws that require that the residence permit should be issued within a certain amount of time, I have a bad feeling that France might simply not respect them.  What can I do in practice to move this along?  At the Prefecture everyone seems to be denying personal responsibility. What are the exact conditions under which I can get the residence permit? They were asking for several payslips of my spouse before they even started processing my request.  This was taking a very long time.  What other options are there?  Is it possible to simply show that I have enough funds to support myself through a bank statement (they didn't seem to be open to this option), and does it go faster? Is there any way to check on the status of the application?  At the Prefecture I was told that this is not possible, and that I will not even be notified when it is ready.  They said I must go and check in person which means that I need to take a full day off and queue for several hours just to be told that they still have no idea when it will be ready.   In general, are there any EU laws that I can practically use to obtain a French residence permit in a timely manner as a spouse of an EU citizen? "
1763,What do I need to do to move in with a friend and his family in another country?,I live in the United States and my friend lives over in England with his family.  There's a very good chance that I'm going to be living with them somewhere down the line. I'll be working for my friend's father along with my friend.  What kind of Visa would I need? This would most definitely be more than a 6 month stay and such.  I don't exactly know where to begin - what preparations (paperwork-wise) would I need? Like a passport and such. 
1764,EEA Family permit for dependent child,I am an Indian citizen and my age is 25. I'm student and graduated from a reputed university of U.K. I came back to India after completing my degree and a week before my student visa was supposed to expire. Currently I'm living in a rented accommodation in new delhi and I'm financially dependent on my father as I'm still studying.   My father is a EEA national and wishes to travel to U.K.  and I want to travel with him through the EEA family permit. My father has never been to U.K. before and would face a language barrier too.  Could anybody please tell me if it is possible for me to travel to U.K. with him?  I was thinking about using EEA family permit for dependent. I can provide proofs of being financially dependent on my father like bank transactions.   What are the chances of being refused for EEA family permit? Please advise me on this and provide me with some better alternative way. 
1765,Can I have a P1 Visa and O1-B visa in the USA at same time?,"I am a circus artist from Canada and I currently have a P1 visa, where I perform in the USA as part of a performance team. I am applying for an O-1B visa because I have been offered another employment opportunity in the same city, as an individual performer, with a separate company.  I know I can have a P and O visa at same time but can I be working for separate companies under each visa at same time? I heard I can only work for one company at a time since they require different visas.  The work/performances I do under the P1 visa is only part time and so I have lots of time off throughout the week to be working elsewhere. I want to make the most of my time here in the USA and so would like to be working/performing with both companies at same time.  Is there something specific I need to do on my form I-129 to show that I would like to get a concurrent visa but in a different category than a P1? Do I need to leave the USA and come back in under the new visa just to get the visa stamp in my passport? ( Canadians do not need to get actual visas into their passports for temporary work permits) "
1766,Does a U.S. citizen have to give up his credit cards and bank accounts when he moves abroad?,"Credit card applications usually say ""must be a U.S. resident"".  If a U.S. citizen moves abroad temporarily, and he doesn't want to use his friends' or relatives' U.S. addresses to get his mail, and his foreign address is uncertain, or is in a country with unreliable mail, what happens to his bank and credit accounts?  Must he give them up? Can and should he use an accountant or an attorney in the U.S. to handle his finances (and if so how much would that cost, typically)?  Is there a standard name for this service? "
1767,How to safely apartment hunt remotely in the US?,"I'm in the US and relocating across the country for work.  I am not able to go to the new location to see apartments in person nor does my employer offer any relocation assistance.  In this situation, how does one find an apartment or rental house?  Without seeing a property how does one ensure they are not simply being scammed by someone posting a fake apartment ad and asking for deposit money or personal information for a background check? "
1768,"After employer change, do I have to go to US Embassy for visa stamping again?","I got my H1B Visa stamped last year and it is (was?) valid till 2017. It was through my earlier employer ABC. I have changed the job and my new employer got my Visa transferred. Now, it is valid till 2016 (so not 2017 anymore).    I am going back for vacation. My colleagues told me that I need to go to US embassy to get the Visa stamped as I have changed the employer. I talked regarding this with the employer. My employer in turn contacted their attorney. I got the reply that I don't need to go to Embassy for stamping. He said that when I will come back then at port of entry my Visa (and I-94) will be updated.    I am totally confused who is right. Can you guys please let me know, do I need to go for stamping?  "
1769,Income needed to maintain indefinite leave to stay in the UK,"I believe there will be a change in applying for indefinite leave to stay in the UK from 2016 so that minimum income is £35,000.

1770,Did not get passport stamped in Oman to UAE,"I am in Dubai with a tourist visa and had to exit UAE-to-Oman for a visa change. I got a job in Dubai and had to get my Employment Visa stamped. So I went from Dubai to Oman to ""exit"". However in Oman, I somehow found my self in the airport straight to my flight's gate possibly not getting into the stamp section. So I didn't get my passport stamped. I only knew that I had to get my passport stamped when I asked the other passengers who are also exiting. When I went to Dubai, the immigration office still stamped on my Employment Visa. I'm not sure if the Oman stamps weren't required or he didn't notice it. Or the only thing he needed to see is the Dubai exit stamp.  Will I be in trouble for this? Will my Employment Visa be completed or are the Oman entry/exit stamps required when processing my visa change? "
1771,Spouse visa category and IHS payment,"I applied from Nigeria for a settlement visa to join my wife in the UK who is a British citizen and my sponsor and meets the financial requirements. All supporting documents have been submitted with the application. While filling the application form online, i choose the visa category 'settlement' and sub type to be 'marriage' . I filled the form online and there was no option of paying the IHS fee. I have submitted the application and awaiting a decision without paying for IHS as the option wasn't presented to me. I however later realised after submitting the application that the visa sub type 'husband' would have given me an option to pay for the IHS.  Can this possibly affect the decision being made? Is there any way I can pay for it and send to the home office before a decision is made? "
1772,Europeans expats who own an online business - how did you go about getting a USA visa?,I'm a EU citizen and want to live in USA for a few years.  ESTA is only for 3 months however and I'm guessing I can't just hop out of the country for a week and then return indefinitely.  I have enough savings to live comfortably in NYC/LA but don't have like $500k+ to drop on an investor visa like it's nothing. I do run a few online businesses though so maybe I can open up LLCs in USA and get a business visa of some sort?  What do you recommend or who do you recommend contacting for such problems?

1775,Acquiring UK permanent residence through a parent for EU citizen,"I'm an EU citizen resident in the UK for more than 10 years and am in the process of applying for a permanent residence document to apply for British citizenship. This question relates to my 17 year old son, also an EU citizen who has been exercising his EU Treaty Rights since 2016.  Per the GOV UK website:      If your parent is eligible for settled status      You’ll be eligible for settled status once your parent has settled   status, even if:         you’ve lived in the UK for less than 5 years    you arrive in the UK after 31 December 2020      Even through he will not be eligible for settled status on his own as he doesn't meet the residence criteria, it's quite clear that he will automatically be eligible for settled status after mine is granted.  However, I'm not quite sure what happens if I apply and be granted British citizenship before he applies and is granted his settled status. Should I therefore not apply before that?  Also, does the procedure relating to settled status after UK's exit from the EU depend on any kind of deal or no deal with the EU? What I'm getting at is if what is outlined on the GOV UK page likely to change? The following quote makes it as if it was all rock solid as only that one part, completely irrelevant to me, is subject to any kind of approval.     How long you can live outside the UK is still subject to approval by Parliament.   It is quite important for us to know as it will help him decide whether to apply to study abroad or not.  Lastly, my timeline for applying for British citizenship was to wait at least 6 years - 5 years to be eligible to apply for British citizenship and another year to hold the document for at least a year. However, as my son is going to receive settled status in his 3rd year of residence. Therefore, are we correct in understanding that he will be able to apply for citizenship in June 2021, after 5 years of residence? "
1776,Reimbursement for municipal and water taxes when leaving mid-year?,"Alas, I've left the Netherlands... Tot ziens, mijn mooie thuis weg van huis...  Now, I was living in Amsterdam, I left in mid-year (June), after having paid the full year's municipal taxes (WOZ-beschikking gebruiker and Afvalstoffenheffing) and the yearly water charge (Waterschapsbelasting) to WaterNet.  My question: Can I get a refund for the relative part of the year in which I had already left? If so, is there some specific procedure for making such a request, or do I just go on their respective websites and use the contact form to ask? "
1777,Gap in evidence of work experience,"I worked in a small company for 2 years after my studies, but I don't have any payslips or bank statement as I was getting the salary as cash. Only thing I am having is an experience certificate.   I am from India. The salary I got was less than the tax threshold, so I didn't have to pay tax. Also, the company is closed very soon after I left.   I want to apply for a Skilled PR Visa to Australia. But, I am not sure whether or not to mention this work experience as its lack of strong evidence.    If I mention the work experience, the application may refuse due to lack of evidence? (I didn't mention that work experience with the next employers as they suggested. They said that it may make a problem in background verification as the company was closed) If I don't mention, there would be 2 years of gap in work experience. Do I need to bother about this?  "
1778,"Entering the UK as a visitor, 5 years after tier 4 visa was curtailed","I am hoping someone can assist me, as I am unsure of what to do in this situation: I was a student in the UK 5 years ago. I rushed into the decision of studying abroad and chose a course that was unsuitable for me. I also had anxiety issues that I was dealing with. Anyway, I had poor attendance and wasn't performing well academically. The university I was at informed that they were going to revoke their sponsorship. I received the curtailment letter shortly thereafter, and I left the UK immediately (I did not overstay the curtailed visa). I enrolled at a university in my home country, I graduated, and now have a full time job.  In 2016, I acquired a new citizenship that allows me to enter the UK as a visitor visa-free. I am planning on going to the UK in  mid-October 2018 using my newly acquired citizenship for 10 days to visit my brother who's currently undertaking his masters degree there. Will I face problems at immigration when I try to enter?   I'll be bringing important documents with me (return home ticket, proof of employment, hotel reservation...etc). Will that be enough or do I need to take further steps? "
1779,Marriage Visitor Visa - Eventually Settle in UK (US Citizen),"I'm a US citizen intending on marrying my UK citizen fiancé. However, I'm not sure whether my situation will fall under a Marriage Visitor Visit or a Fiancé Visa. I'm still a little new to this but I want to apply for a visitor visa because at the time of marriage, I will have too many investments at home and cannot stay indefinitely in the UK. However, after some time, I would like to immigrate to the UK once everything settles down. Is that possible or is this considered ""cheating the system""? I know with a Fiancé, you show intent of settlement but again, I cannot settle immediately. Can someone please help me understand which option is best? Thanks! "
1780,I am on B1/B2 visa and want to open a credit union account in the US. Can I apply for ITIN to do this? Is this a bad idea?,"I am on a B1/B2 visa and want to open a Boeing Employee Credit Union (BECU) checking/savings account in Washington State. My purpose is so that I could have a checking/savings account with 0 USD maintaining balance that I could use to save some money and then spend for travel and leisure and treating relatives, whenever I visit my relatives who are US citizens in WA. I have family members who have accounts, which makes me eligible. The only thing that I’m lacking is an SSN (which I am not qualified for because I am not a US citizen or worker), or an ITIN.  Can I apply for ITIN to do this? Is this a bad idea? I wanted to specifically ask if having a US bank account and an ITIN will have any future ramifications to my plans of applying for H1B, or like when my current company would sponsor me for an L1B visa, or if in the future I would decide to take a masters degree in the US via F1 visa, or if in the future there would be opportunities to apply for a green card via employment based immigration. Will this pose unnecessary risk and questions? "
1781,Can I register a Nebenwohnung before I have a Hauptwohnung?,"Suppose that married persons X and Y are moving to Germany.  They will share a Hauptwohnung (primary residence) in city A, but X will additionally occupy a Nebenwohnung (secondary residence) in city B because X has a job at the other end of the country.  So far so good: both will register as Hauptwohnung in city A, and X will additionally register as Nebenwohnung in city B.  However, due to timing reasons, X is moving to Germany before Y does, and will live primarily in what will be the Nebenwohnung for the first 6 weeks or so.  Can X register their residency in city B as Nebenwohnung, before X and Y together register their residency in city A as Hauptwohnung?  Or must X initially register residency as city B as Hauptwohnung, and then re-register in city B as Nebenwohnung as soon as Y moves to Germany and both partners register together in city A as Hauptwohnnung?  The registration form (example from Offenbach, but I expect it's the same elsewhere) appears not to ask people registering a Nebenwohnung, what their Hauptwohnung is, although it does ask for address details for the Ehegatte (partner). "
1782,"Moving to Germany to take up two jobs, but will need two homes. I've heard the costs for the second home may be tax-deductible. Under what conditions?","Consider the situation in Can I register a Nebenwohnung before I have a Hauptwohnung?:     Suppose that married persons X and Y are moving to Germany. They will share a Hauptwohnung (primary residence) in city A, but X will additionally occupy a Nebenwohnung (secondary residence) in city B because X has a job at the other end of the country. So far so good: both will register as Hauptwohnung in city A, and X will additionally register as Nebenwohnung in city B.   I've heard that under certain circumstances, they might be able to deduct (some of the) costs for the Nebenwohnung that X occupies several days per week, from income tax — and perhaps the travel costs, too.   For example, see Haupt- und Nebenwohnsitz: Rechtlichte Regelungen, which states, among other things:     Wird der Zweitswohnsitz nur aus berüflichen Gründen genutzt, besteht die Möglichkeit, die doppelte Haushaltsführung steuerlich geltend zu machen.   (...)     Wer steuerlich befreit werden will, muss mindestens 10% der Steuern, die auf den Hauptwohnsitz fallen, selbst bezahlen.   It's not clear to me what those conditions mean in practice.  I'm not familiar with German legalese.  For example:  When they say aus berüflichen Grunden, would that include that the second job is simply too far away, or does it mean for business purposes only?  I read something about Betriebsausgabe vs. Werbungskosten but it's not clear to me if it can be deducted in either case or only if it counts as a Betriebsausgabe.  In our case it wouldn't, because X and Y are both employees (both are Beambte, in case it matters).  And on the payment of the taxes for the Hauptwohnsitz.  Are they talking about real estate taxes?  Does that imply X and Y must own the Hauptwohnung in city A, or do tenants pay those taxes themselves too and would this condition not pose any problems?  It is useful to know this in advance, for it may be financially more advantageous to have a single shared primary residence together where only one person travels back and forth weekly, compared to a more symmetric situation where both travel back and forth fortnightly, as we did in the past in England. "
1783,US Credit Building strategy: Have both an Unsecured and a Secured Credit Card?,"I'm about to immigrate under EB3 visa (employment-based green card), and I'm applying for some unsecured credit cards (CreditStacks, Advancial, and American Express Global Card Transfers - but I also accept other suggestions if any).  I read here that a good diversity (credit mix) will help improve my score.  Assuming that I can get one unsecured card, does it still make sense to also get a secured card?   Will it help my credit-score if I get 2 unsecured cards?  Additionally, for getting a good mortgage rate in the future, should my spouse also worry about building her own credit score? "

1785,How can an American moving to Germany get necessary work and residency permits? Already have job,"TL;DR - In what order, and how, can an American moving to Germany get the necessary work and residency permits to (a) ship in his belongings via a moving company and (b) legally begin working? I already have the job (signed Arbeitsvertrag).  Full details:  I'm a U.S. citizen &amp; resident, and have worked for 2 1/2 years for a U.S. subsidiary of a German company. I've accepted an offer from that company to move to Germany in January and work there. My wife and two children will be moving with me. I have a rough plan in mind, but am quite confused about how to implement the plan.  Some key points:   I already have a signed job offer / work contract (Arbeitsvertrag) starting the first week of January 2019. I already have a signed apartment rental contract (Mietvertrag) starting 1 December 2018 (the landlord knows we won't actually arrive until January). I meet all requirements for the EU Blue Card.   Here are the challenges I face:   The moving company has informed us that we need a residency permit (or blue card) or a temporary work permit and a copy of an application for a residency permit/card in order for our belongings to clear customs. I believe I can't actually begin working at the German office until I have at least a temporary work permit. My nearest German Consulate in the U.S. (Chicago) doesn't have any available appointments in their calendar for the next 2 months. Even if they did, I understand it can take 3 months or more to receive the blue card and that you have to surrender your passport, which would mean we can't go to Germany in January. I can't get an address registration (Anmeldebestätigung) until we actually arrive in Germany because the landlord must sign a form (Wohnungsgeberbestätigung) stating that we live there. I understand it can take several weeks to get an appointment at an Ausländerbehörde, and we can't even make the appointment until we have the Anmeldebestätigung (we tried, in person during our last trip, and they refused).   So, can anyone recommend the best way to proceed? One solution could be to ship our belongings and immediately travel to Germany, drop off a suitcase in our apartment, get the landlord to sign the Wohnungsgeberbestätigung, run to the Bürgeramt and get the Anmeldebestätigung, and then go to the Ausländerbehörde and beg to get a temporary work permit until we can straighten out the Blue Card. But I've extremely concerned that all these steps will take so long that I'll be (a) stuck with my belongings in customs limbo because I can't provide the appropriate permits and (b) stuck in Germany with no belongings and no legal right to work.  Although my employer is a medium sized and stable international company, they have very little experience bringing foreign employees to Germany and have not been able to help with these questions. That said, they have been extremely helpful and are willing to provide anything I might need to expedite the process.   Can I hire a visa services company to do all this for me, for a (probably large) fee? Can I fly to the German Embassy in Washington, D.C. and get this done quicker? Would a letter of urgency from my German employer help speed things along? Who should I show it to? Any other ideas?  "
1786,While waiting for a Swedish residency card I am not allowed to travel in the EU/Schengen zone,Can I please get clarity why Swedish Immigration would not extend a residency permit while waiting for a residency card? Leaving one without any legal residency documentation for 15 months. I am an EU spouse and have no legal document (permit) to travel within the EU while waiting for the residency card.

1787,AIG Global Expatriate Assistance program,"AIG has this program targeted at new immigrants to the US, especially those who don't have any credit history. With a sign up fee of 440$, it's supposed to help us to get unsecured credit card, mortgage, car insurance (at decent price), etc.  I'm having trouble deciding whether to opt for this program. What,  What are the alternatives? Can I ""build credit history"" through other means?  Also, how much of a credit history (e.g. in terms of months) would I gain by starting US life with an unsecured card instead of prepaid cards? "
1788,Working remotely for a foreign company in Canada as a dependent of a student,"I have question about visas and working in Canada.  My wife is going to study in Canada for a year or two so our 2 children and I are going with her as so-called ""dependents"" on her visa. We currently live in Japan, and I work remotely for a Swedish company as a software developer. I was wondering if it's possible to continue working on my current job, and if so, what the best way to do that is.  This link (which if I understand correctly is the official authority on immigration) says, on the subject of what isn't considered work,      long distance (by telephone or Internet) work done by a temporary resident whose employer is outside Canada and who is remunerated from outside Canada;   .. which I take as ""as long as you get paid to a non-Canadian bank account it's fine since it won't be considered work"". But I don't know for sure that my assumptions about Canadian immigration law are correct and it would be nice if there is somewhere I can get an official and unequivocal answer to this instead of later finding out I'm in legal trouble. I also don't know if ""funneling"" my salary through a non-Canadian bank account into a Canadian one is considered perfectly legal, or if going about it this way will close any doors when it comes to getting another visa in the future - I'd rather pay taxes in Canada and get paid into a Canadian bank account since that will be cheaper, more convenient and feel more reasonable but that seems to be a dealbreaker.  Is there somewhere I can get a confirmation that this is a valid approach? (or does anyone know a reason why it wouldn't be?) "
1789,Can I convert the UK Standard-Visitor Visa to a Fiancee Visa?,"I've found a lot of conflicting information regarding this on StackExchange and other websites together and I'd like to know if anyone knew anything definite about this. I am from the United States of America and I plan on visiting my partner in Scotland in January or February - my partner has thrown around the idea of proposal before in the past and is now very much talking about it, to the point where I'm making this post. I am more than happy to live in the United Kingdom as my partner has an established work life and I am floating around seasonal work in my life here in the United States. My living situation in the United States is not of the most positive with a lot of stress due to family and a blatant disregard for me as a human because of my LGBT identity. If he were to pop the question, would I be able to elevate my standard visitors visa to a fiancee visa assuming he/we could provide all the necessary documents? (on-track to earn 19,500 with 6 months+ of payslips to prove, facebook messages, facebook friend data ""became friends with _____ nearly 6 years ago"", discord messages, photographs of us together in various clean situations as he's visited me in the United States as I've visited him in the United Kingdom previously and a secondary account of our relationship by both a UK national and US national, lives in a private rental with...two cats, if that's relevant at all but I don't want the home office to believe they're being intentionally misled at all).  I've attempted to do my own research and I've hit a few walls -  this question, posted on StackExchange a year and then some ago resolved with the original poster saying that it's ""totally fine"" - I've reached out to them personally but with no response. and then I found this question - again posted on StackExchange where this person, was sadly denied a marriage visitor visa and in the answer states that the only visa possible in-country to switch to is the fiance visa, but in the same light, I've found posts saying that the fiancee visa must be applied to outside of the country regardless of circumstance. I'm a bit of the worried type and I'd like to be able to plan ahead to whatever happens, especially when it comes to something like this. If this is possible, that's wonderful! I'm really glad. If not - I'll leave the country at the end of my visit and apply for a fiance visa abroad while staying at a friends flat; or maybe I'm reading sub-text that isn't there and he's not going to propose to me at all. :P   Either way, thank you all for any help that you can give me. I really do appreciate it no matter what you have to say.  Another thing is that I do plan on staying with him for the entire duration of the standard visitors visa of 6 months - I understand that my best chances of being approved for this is that I be completely forthright with the home office officer(? term is wrong ?) I was a student that was studying constantly for two years straight before realizing that I didn't want to be doing that, basically, cue the very-early-life crisis. I ended up going to Scotland to finally meet my long-time boyfriend while he continued to be closeted to his family and friends but only for a weeks time initially - he quit work as he realized he was unhappy with it and came to visit me for a month, after that, I visited him for a month and a half over the holidays, after that, he visited me in the states for two months before finally visiting him for 3 months - last having left the United Kingdom in August of 2018. We both began working again after dealing with some mental health issues, him under the NHS and me under....capitalism - I guess. If I told the officer this information, along with information regarding financial status and that fun stuff - what are my chances of being approved for the full 6-months? I would be looking into purchasing a return flight 6 months after my initial flight but I don't know if they're even listed that far ahead and that's something the officers generally wanted to see the most from me when I went previously.

I understand that I can start working once the USCIS sends the acknowledgment receipt. My question is about my status in the interim period between leaving my current job and the wait for the receipt. Will I be considered out of status? Can I wait in the USA or do I have to leave the country? I will still get paid two weeks from the date of leaving of my current job as per the regular pay cycle. 
1795,What type of visa should I get to participate in startup programs in Germany?,"I am from Asia and want to participate in startup programs in Germany*. What type of visa should I get? I also like to know if my proposal is accepted in an accelerator/incubator, what kind of visa do I need?  If I want to create a new startup/company in Germany, are there startup/entrepreneurship visa for that? Where can I read the requirements and apply for that? What is the Germany government website that I can use?  * E.g. programs like what this institute provides: [website]"
1796,Permanent residency in Germany with an expired passport,"In 2020 I will get my PR in Germany, however in 2021 my passport will expire in May and I will have to wait till September to reach 30 years old and be able to apply at my embassy for a new passport (from the age of 29 till 30, males are not able to renew their passports unless they give a final exemption from the military service).   Are these 4 months going to be a problem? I am not willing to travel in this period anyway, but can I expect any trouble with the Auslanderbehörde because of my expired passport in that period? "
1797,What does it mean to be resident?,"I am aware that for tax purposes, most countries use various criteria for classifying individuals as residents. These are generally a combination of physical presence and other ties.  What does ""being resident"" or ""your country of residence"" mean in the context of immigration laws? Some immigration forms ask about country of current and previous residence.   Is a resident for tax purposes automatically a resident for immigration purposes? If somebody has obtained a temporary or permanent residence permit of a country, but does not ""live"" there, is he a resident of that country? If someone is living in a country illegally, would that be considered his country of residence?   Edit: for greater clarity, this is for immigration purposes. Some questions that are asked:   provide details for the countries that you have lived in for last 10 years police record certificates for countries that you have lived in for longer than six months  Example form: [website]  B6. List all addresses where you have lived for the past 10   years   (Note: Residences should include, without limitation, any   place where you have lived for a period of 6 months or more)""  "
1798,how to return I-94?,"I'm Canadian and was working US from 2015 till 2018 on TN visa.  I got paper I-94 when I crossed border in September 2015.  I left US July 31 2018 and my TN expired September 18.  But I still have I-94 in my Canadian passport.  According this site I need:     Turn in your I-94 Departure Record and documentation that you left the   United States to:       (for UPS/Fedex)       Coleman Data Solutions 3043      Sanitarium Road Suite 2 Akron,       OH 44312 DHS - CBP SBU   Is this information still correct?  From other side if I look at my Travel history, I see the following:     2018-07-31 Departure ATL   So US Immigration knows that I left US.  Do they still need my I-94 record? "
1799,Is the VFS's city relevant from where you apply for a UK visa?,"Following the completion of my short term work visa, my organization has asked me to return to India to apply for a United Kingdom ICT Tier 2 Long Term work visa. I already have the paperwork ready, and I have to select a VFS centre on the online application. Is it mandatory that I apply from the same city as that of my organization (which would be the VFS Bangalore centre), or can I apply from a VFS in another city in India?  My permanent residence is in Calcutta, and hence I am looking at the option to apply from VFS Calcutta. Do you see any potential problems in applying from a different city than my organization? "
1800,Waiting time when applying for a German passport abroad?,"I've noticed that there are a fair amount of Germans on this website. I just applied for my first German passport at the consulate and they told me that it takes around 8-10 weeks to arrive, which seems a bit excessive. For those of you who are Germans living outside of Germany, how long did it take for you to receive your passport? Also, from what consular post did you apply? "
1801,Is registering a vehicle in Great Britain and using it in and outside of Britain possible?,"Here are the details. I work both in Britain (own a British Limited Company) and outside of Britain. I am not a permanent resident in Britain but live permanently in another EU country. My question is this: Can i register a car in Great Britain (either on my company or on me) and drive it around Europe, since i will be promoting my business?. How many months can i be outside of Britain before i have to get back for MOT inspection and the like? (is 6 months the correct answer?) What sort of papers shall i have on me to prove i am not a permanent resident in UK but work there as well as in other countries of EU?  "
1802,To Canada From Switzerland for a PhD: principal versus secondary residency?,"I am currently living in Switzerland (I have a swiss Passeport) and am leaving to Vancouver, BC, Canada next September to start a PhD. I am asking for general advice to the question ""Should I announce myself in primary residency in Canada and in secondary residency in Switzerland or the opposite?"" Do I even have the choice of not-being in primary residency in Canada?  I guess this decision may influence   Taxation  given my PhD salary and current bank account it will probably not make a big different : )  Rights for opening a bank account  it is the question that bothers me the most right now  Rights for having a job off-campus Health insurance  although according to this source I would tend to think it makes no difference  Other insurances Driving license  Especially: Will Switzerland validates my Canadian driving license?  eventually some other things?…  "

1804,Has the 2014 ikamet changes affected any of the requirements to apply for Turkish citizenship?,"As a US citizen residing in Turkey currently holding a 5 year ikamet I was hoping to be eligible to apply for citizenship in 2017. The old laws required a period of continuous residency in order to be eligible, but they seemed flexible (i.e. open to interpretation by local immigration offices) as far as what the employment requirements were.  It seems, from the chatter, like the 2014 changes to the ikamet system will change that. However I cannot find any concrete sources for what the actual requirements have changed to (or will be in 2017). What, if anything, has changed about the requirements for US citizens applying for dual citizenship in Turkey? I am especially interest in not having had a history of in-country employment. Has that been made a requirement? "
1805,Returning To The US - Tax Considerations?,"US citizens living abroad need to file income tax (American citizens living abroad still have to pay tax to US - legal ways to avoid?) but there is a Foreign Earned Income Exclusion ([website]In my situation, I'm an ex-pat that is considering returning to the US.    US Taxes are based on calendar years, so if I work from Jan-Oct (for example) I will pay local taxes on those 10 months and I will not qualify for the FEIE mentioned above.  Does this mean I will need to pay US income taxes on top of the local taxes?  Would I pay less taxes by returning to the US on Jan 1st verse May 1st, assuming equal incomes in both countries? "
1806,Is he still a US national after giving up his US citizenship?,"I have some doubts on the definitions of US national and US citizenship.  Let's suppose: A man was born in Los Angeles, CA. So he was a US national and US citizen. When he was 18 years old, he gave up his US citizenship, and obtained Chinese citizenship. Then he is no longer a US citizen, but is he still a US national? Is he required a US visa if he wants to travel in US? "
1807,Do I need a visa to study in Germany as a holder of Netherlands residence permit?,"I came to Netherlands one year ago for my studies in Hospitality Management (Euro BA). There is one year in Netherlands, a second year in Germany and a 3rd year in UK. I have a Netherlands residence permit and I am a non-EU International student.  I asked my school in Germany that if I need a German study visa to continue my 2nd year in Germany and they said no. But I don't know whether it is even possible as my visa is for the Netherlands only.  How will this work now? If I go there, will my school help me getting residence permit or not?  I am really confused, has anyone been through such situation? "
1808,"My Polish driver's license was issued 10 years ago, is it valid in EU?","I've got a Polish driver's license, it's older style, so it has unlimited validity. I'm supposed to exchange that for a newer one, with 15 years validity, but officially I have until 2033 to do that.   On the other hand, I've heard that some countries do not accept unlimited validity and apply their rules. If the document was issued more than 10 years ago is it still valid in EU? Does it matter in that case, that I'm a resident of the Netherlands?  "
1809,"I am a non-EU citizen, one of 3 directors of a company in the UK. How can I work in the UK?","The situation is that I am one of 3 directors of a digital agency set up in the UK. We are a remote team with multiple UK and Europe based clients, and our team is all over the world.   I am not an EU citizen. I would like to go over to the UK to assist with growing the business. The only way I can see this working is if our company applies to be a sponsor, and then sponsors me to work in the UK in a formal position.    Is this a viable option? Are there any other options available in this case?  "
1810,Brazilian son of a UK citizen,I am a Brazilian citizen and my wife has dual nationality: Brazilian and British. Our son was born in Brazil. Now we are moving to the UK to stay for an indeterminate period of time. Does my son have the right to the UK citizenship? What are the requirements? 
1811,Ohio>Arizona>Germany>France driver's license conversion?,"I originally took my driving test in Ohio at the age of 16 and received an Ohio license. While I was in college in Arizona, I converted that license to an Arizona one. Last year, I converted the Arizona license to a German license per the reciprocity agreement. Now I have license cards for Germany and Arizona as well as a card for Ohio with a hole punched in it.  Now I have lived in France for almost 1 year so I need to get my license figured out. I see that the prefecture websites all say that if you have a license from a country that has reciprocity with France then they distinguish between a license that is actually from that country and a license that has been converted from elsewhere. In this way, if my German license was converted from an Arizona license, and considering that Arizona does not have reciprocity with France, I must take a test to get a French license.  However, it seems to me that my Ohio license may be relevant, as Ohio does have reciprocity with France. As France treats the states basically as separate countries for the purpose of licensing, it seems that I could perhaps show my records regarding the conversion of the original Ohio license. From the wording on the French websites, I believe the inverse would be true. If I had an Ohio license that was converted from an Arizona license, it seems I would be required to take a new test (if the French had a good way to verify the origin of the Ohio license, as they likely do with German licenses).  Is there any mechanism by which I can provide documentation for the entire chain of licenses to prove that I was originally licensed in a state with reciprocity and thus eligible for a free conversion to a French license? I also realize it is possible that my German license may not even be relevant. Perhaps I can just show them the Arizona license and convert it, given that I can get documentation proving it is exchanged for an Ohio license? "
1812,What is the official status of a foreign born child to US Citizen parent who meets all requirements to pass citizenship?,"Presumed Facts:  Child Name: Zod  Child Age: 2 years old  1) Zod was born to a US Citizen parent and non US Citizen Parent in a foreign country.  2) US Citizen parent meets all requirements to pass citizenship to child (US citizen parent lived in US for 10+ years after parent was 18, was married at time of child's birth, and child is under 18 years of age. All documents in order.  Visit to US Embassy  When Zod is 2 years old, the US Citizen parent takes the child to the US Embassy and fills out form DS-2029, (Application for Consular Report of Birth Abroad), since all requirements are met, the child would be considered a US Citizen. (At worst a DNA test would be asked for and passed).  Question:  What is the legal definition of the child's status prior to filing the Application for Consular Report of Birth Abroad, during the child's first two years of life in the eyes of the United States? (foreign national, US national, undocumented citizen... etc)? "
1813,"USA - Singapore, What do I need to know?","I'm a younger US citizen with a higher-tier job in the tech sector. My fiance and I have decided that we would like to explore the idea of moving to Singapore in the next five years or so. By that time we will be married, have no children, and be bringing our dog (or two if we get another).  We are at the very beginning stages of the planning process so I have very little hard information on Singapore and what it's like to emigrate there. What I am looking for here is anyone that can share personal experiences or can point me to good resources about the process of being a US citizen and moving there. Here are some specific questions, though they are just the tip of the iceberg and I'm also looking for questions I didn't even know to ask:   I've heard it's (relatively) easy to emigrate to Singapore if you can find a job there, which is also not terribly difficult if you're in one of their major sectors like finance. Being a tech infrastructure expert it's usually not hard to find a place in any sort of business. Does that logic hold true in this instance? How easy is it to bring a pet (specifically a dog)? I'm assuming I'll be living in a high-rise apartment because that is the majority of the housing available, but are they generally accepting of dogs there? Are there any hurdles to citizenship other than finding a job? For example, I know that Japan is fairly restrictive of whom they make citizens, but I have heard no such reports about Singapore. How long should I expect the process to take from start to finish (excluding finances, finding a job, and any travel planning)? As in, from the moment I decide it's time to start whatever paperwork or requests are necessary to the time I am finally able to relax in my new home with my family. What are the major hurdles I must overcome (socially, financially, government-wise, etc) to complete this process? This is the one question where I specifically want discussion of finances (but don't forget the rest of the hurdles!), because while I am confident in being able to muster up the change to make this happen sooner or later, I am not unfortunately made of money, so it has to be discussed at some point. Specifically, how much does each piece of the puzzle cost (visas, living expenses, travel, etc)? What are the major differences between the US and Singapore in social and federal responsibility? As in, what kinds of personal rights would I lose or gain, what behaviors are considered acceptable or unacceptable, etc.   Of course if you have any other recommendations or questions I should be asking feel free to contribute! "
1814,"Answer for ""Are you legally eligible to work in the United States?"" in academic/postdoc position","The following sentence is asked in early stage of all academic positions and postdoc jobs advertised in US-based universities or institutes:     Are you legally eligible to work in the United States?   I Googled this question and found many people have confusion over this question. Some of the answers to this question is here and here.   However, this question is ambiguous and can be interpreted in at least two different ways:    The applicant is considered eligible if he/she is in the US at the time of application submission as a citizen, green card holder or a work/study visa holder and can immediately start to work. The applicant is considered eligible if he/she is not in US nor is citizen and work Visa holder, but is can apply for work permit, come to US, and then work in US.   Which one is correct interpretation?  I think the confusion comes out of the term eligibility because according to the Merriam Webster Dictionary, eligibility means able to be chosen for something, able to do or receive something. In our case it means able to be chosen for a job in US market, able to do or receive work offer in US.   So, I, like many other foreigners outside US, am eligible to apply for visa and work in US because I am adult older than 18 without any conviction record or illegal entry to US or illegal stay in US. So there is nothing to stop me from getting visa and hence I am eligible to apply for a job, get job offer if qualified from a US employer and then apply for the VISA to enter US.  The confusion is further intensified when some employers use the following sentence instead of the above one     Are you legally authorized to work in the United States?   Why some employers use ""Authorized""? Is this a different question?  To me, the second question is much more clearer than the first one, since it asks about authority or right of working in US.  So I think in this way:  while I (without citizenship, green card, or any work visa) am ELIGIBLE to apply from my home country for a work visa, I am NOT AUTHORIZED at the time of application to work in US because I am not in US and have currently no  official work permit from the government. Is this right?  Question 1: So how should I as an alien without citizenship, green card, student visa, work visa, visitor visa, or any other document that enables me to work in US should answer this question?  Question 2: How does saying ""NO"" to this question impacts on chance of getting interview by universities for academic or postdoc positions? "

1816,Notarizing a signature for a document to be sent to the US (AZ) while in France,"I need to get a certified copy of my Arizona driving record. This requires me to complete this form and send it to the Arizona Motor Vehicle Division (AZ MVD) along with a check. The form unfortunately requires a notarized signature. I see that I can theoretically go to the US embassy in Paris or the consulate in Lyon, but those are expensive (50USD) and time consuming, as I don't live in those cities. Plus I would need an appointment, and I need to send this document out as soon as possible.  I called the AZ MVD and spoke to a level-1 (the lowest level) representative to see if there was any way around this notary requirement. She was pretty sure I could get a seal from a French notary. She also said I could go to a motor vehicle office here. I'm pretty certain that the second option won't get me anywhere. Could she be right about the first (or even the second)?  I've read a bit online and it seems that the French notaries have more power than American notaries, but it seems that they can still certify signatures. But will the seal resemble what they are used to seeing at the AZ MVD and are they likely to accept such a document? If not, what's the quickest way to get what I need without leaving my town (Chalon-sur-Saône)? "
1817,"German Students' Health insurance policy, when studying for a year abroad?","I have been studying in Germany since 2009. In Germany, in order to continue being enrolled at a university as international student, you have to have a health insurance which costs you around 80 Euros per month (in my case AOK). After finishing my Bachelor degree I went for one year in Asia for an exchange program (my first Masters year). Unfortunately I had to pay the insurance in South Korea (the German one doesn't offer long term travel insurance) and continue to pay the insurance in Germany in order to keep my enrolled status. Those were 12x80 Euros wasted, which is not a small amount of money.   Now again I'm back to Asia for an internship which will last one year and I really don't want to keep paying an insurance I don't use in Germany. Is somebody familiar with this experience? Is there any way to avoid paying while I am not in Germany and without being kicked out from university? "

A few questions:   this shouldn't contain VAT (Mwst.) right? should I qoute some article of German law on why VAT is not needed? the crazy thing is I found websites saying that you're not obliged to translate your invoices (from German) to English but I find that a bit rude - would an invoice in English still be ""legal"" in Germany? what info from my client should I have on this invoice? Name and address or is his US? tax number also required? Or not needed?  "
1819,Top personal income tax deductibles in Germany?,"Just moved to and started working as a freelancer in Germany and was wondering what things/deductibles are the best way to rescue some money from the taxman at the end of the year?  I'm a graphic designer and unfortunately have almost 0 expenses throuhout the year - will not need new hardware or software, don't have a car and work remotely most of the time (few travel expenses). It seems I'm doomed to pay a lot of tax - or how do you guys save money on that? What would be the ""biggest"" deductibles? "
1820,Tax for income from outside of country in Sweden,"I'm a foreign and non-EU student in Sweden (Sorry! I don't speak Swedish yet but learning it), I have 2 question about taxes:   Should I pay tax for the money which my parent send me for studying and living to my Swedish bank account (they will send money from Russia)? Is there any limit for amount they send monthly? I have an online website and I sell digital products on it to worldwide customers, I use a USA based company to process online payments for my website, and this company send my earnings to my Russian bank (in Russia) monthly, now if I change the bank and ask that company to send my earnings to my Swedish bank in Sweden, then should I pay tax for it in Sweden?

1821,How long does a Work Permit last in Canada?,My girlfriend is from Sweden. She is coming to Canada with me and has a Work Permit already.  Question 1:  How long can she stay in Canada on a Work Permit?  Question 2:  Does she need any other type of visa to enter (Temporary Resident Visa or Visitors Visa) or is a Work Permit enough?  
1822,Practicing German in daily activity to prepare for time abroad,"English is my first language. I have taken four semesters of university German in preparation to go abroad in 2015 to work and study.  My question is this - how can I practice and improve my German in the coming months before heading over? Is there something I can listen to in my car, a good website to practice with, etc?  I'm most concerned with improving my speaking and listening abilities. Let me know what I can do! "
1823,Mobile carriers in France and how they work across the EU,"I am planning to move to France and I am a bit curious, how do cellular carriers/networks operate in the European Union?

Please do let me know, simply because I don't know. "
1824,"Does anyone know about the ""Carte de commerçant étranger""?","I'm looking at the Carte de commerçant étranger, a French long stay visa for those who are able to make their own business/living in France. I'm wondering if anyone on here has ever done this, how did you do it? What kind of questions did they ask you that you think they would ask anyone? How was the département in renewing your visa? I mean, I have heard horror stories about immigrants interacting with the département and I know that it takes five years to qualify for permanent residency and citizenship.  So, if anyone has any details, please let me know. :) "
1825,Working self-employed in England,"My question is about working self-employed in England. The visa type I'm interested in only allows me to become a self-employed individual and requires me to pay tax depending on my income. So, in my case, this means that I can only offer my services to different clients/companies not as a permanent employee but as a freelancer. This is where my worries start. How do I find out what sort of contract I would be offered (before entering England) if I started doing some work in England. OR would companies help me out on this by drawing up a contract special to my circumstances? If not, How am I supposed to prove to the Home Office that my deals with the clients/companies are all legit and in compliance with the restrictions of the visa? "
1826,German work council agreement,"I have a German Master degree and applied for a PhD position in one of the German companies.

These include in   particular the agreement of the works council to your employment. The   necessary administrative procedures in the hiring process will be   started promptly. We will inform you as soon as all approvals have   been received.   My query is as I have a Master degree from German University why should I need an approval from work council? And can anyone explain what is this agreement thing along with the possible reasons they will not agree to my employment?  And another thing is, this PhD position is in the field of Mechanical Engineering, so does this TVL E13 100% is enough to apply for a Blue card?    N.B: I have almost one year work experience in Germany as Research assistant. "

1828,Studying abroad as an F1 student,"From this source:     If you leave the United States for more than five months and are not able to remain enrolled at your U.S., SEVP-certified school, you will not be able to maintain your student status. To resume your studies in the United States, you will need to seek readmission in initial status, which includes obtaining a new Form I-20 and paying the I-901 SEVIS fee again. To seek readmission, please speak with your designated school official.   Does it mean that if I (a grad student on F1) am absent from the US for, say, 10 months (studying abroad as an exchange student) and if I'm enrolled in 8 credit hours (which is, I believe, the minimal number of credit hours for graduate students to maintain their F1 status), then I can re-enter the US on the same F1 visa  that I had before leaving the US (provided it remains valid)? Or does the above mean that regardless of anything, if I'm absent for more than 5 months, then I'm automatically not maintaining my F1 status and I need to apply for a new F1 visa with a new I-20 after the exchange program is over?  Also, can I enter the US during the above-mentioned hypothetical 10-month period on the same F1 visa that I had before leaving the US (if it's valid)? "
1829,Is it likely I would be denied reentry as a transfer pending F1 student?,"I am currently a F1 student staying in the United States. I am planning on travelling to Canada in a couple of days and am worried I might there might be issues during my reentry.  I have just transferred from a small town university to an elite university in my field. However, I had financial support in the smaller school which I do not have in this school. I am perfectly able to fund my education with my own savings, but I also have taken some loans just to keep some wiggle rooms. I have not started classes in this university.  I however was initially denied a visa into the United States with this University (say University A) and funding scenario last year (on basis of finances I suppose, but they handed me the 214b leaflet), so I came with full funding a semester later in a university B and studied for a semester. Now I have managed loans and am going to University A.  Will the CBP make problems while reentering the US from my 10 days conference attendance trip to Canada? I can show enough funds for the 2 years mentioned in my transfer funding i20 through loans and savings (the actual cost will be half of what's mentioned in the i20). Will there be problems since I was once denied visa for this university?  Should I just cancel this trip and stay in the US to complete one semester at least in new school?  I need urgent help. Thanks a lot! "
1830,Germany work permit visa denial,"My long term work permit visa got rejected stating that:     You do not  fulfill the requirement to work as ""Leiharbeitnehmer"" as intended according to section 2 No.3 of your work contract.

If we request an email to CO for the visa of the whole family instead of Main Applicant, is it possible CO allow us to travel with the Main applicant to NZ? What is the time frame for converting JSV to RV?   Please suggest the possible way and guide us on what to do? Please share any other aspects and points what is not in my mind now?  Thanks  Edit: my wife got 175 points in EOI. She does not have a NZ job offer. "
1832,Getting the Canadian citizenship for my 3 years old child,"I do not know what to do, and I am stressed about the situation. I would appreciate some guidance or comments.  I was born in Canada, my father is Canadian and I lived there several years in my life (even worked there for a few months when I was a teenager). My mother is French and I also lived several years in France where I live now, and I have the dual citizenship. I also lived in South America where I got a child, about 3 years ago. From what I read in the official Canadian government websites, my child is Canadian and I should gather documents to get his proof of citizenship, which would allow him to get a Canadian passport. This is what I have done back in 2017, I sent the documents to the Canadian embassy in Paris and they sent them to the place that deals with the paperwork and delivers the proof of citizenship. Back at that time, the expected time to get a response from the Government was 18 months (1 year and a half), now it's been reduced to 8 months I think. It's written that if we do not get a reply within that time-frame, something is likely wrong and the response will likely be negative.  In my case it's been about two years now, so I emailed them a few months back and they could not provide any new information. The status is that it's still being decided, and that it is placed in the unusual cases, but there is no reason mentioned. I do not know why this could be the case at all. The only ""strange thing"" about my application is that, as described in my earlier question, my name differs between Canada and France due to (now outdated) laws. But I assume my case is far from the only one, since all it takes is to have had a composite family name in Canada and then the French transcription of birth, before the year 2000 or something like that. That's really the only thing that is a bit unusual that I can think of. In a way, it is similar to the case of a Chinese person who has his Chinese name transcribed in roman letters: his name differs between the two country governments.  So, I have paid (I can't remember if it was about 100 CAD or something like that), and more importantly, I have spent time doing all the paperwork. Now I started to work and I have very few free time to do all this paperwork, and I am becoming stressed that my child would be denied to have his proof of citizenship. If I either ask them again what the status is,  or if I wait until I get a negative reply and retry to get his proof of citizenship done, I fear I will hinder his chances to ever get the proof of Canadian citizenship, for if he decides to move there when he gets older.  I do not want to hurt his chances. I do not know what to do. What should I do? Or, what could I possibly do? The waiting time is insane, this really makes no sense to me.  Edit on 21th of August, 2019: I just received the certificate of the proof of citizenship. It took a really long time, but in the end I finally got him this precious document! I am very happy, a lot of stress is relieved... though I will have to do the same for his little sister who is about to born in the next days.  "

1839,Changing Airlines in Spain - UK Citizen without Passport,"My son's UK citizenship came through today, we're not applying for his UK passport from here (Bolivia) instead we're travelling to the Republic on his Bolivian passport and then we'll drive to Northern Ireland and apply for it when we get there.  We're now looking for flights, and there are no direct flights from anywhere in South America to Dublin. Therefore we're looking at a stopover in Spain.  My question is twofold: firstly Iberia have a flight all under them, which goes through Madrid, and is all within terminal 4 and 4s - would any visa be necessary in that case?  Secondly, if we were to change airlines, and therefore change terminals (from 4S to 2, in case it matters) would we need a schengen visa for that?  I know that Bolivia is NOT on the list of countries that need a transit visa, but as to whether this would be considered transit I'm super confused and the information is mixed online.  Thank you all! "

However they need a quick start, and the star date (also in the certificate) is 9th September. Even if I complete the application today or tomorrow, I need to give a month's notice at the current job, so can't wait to have an answer before resigning. My questions are: 1) In your experience, how long does it take to get a new BRP when changing Tier 2 Sponsors? Would you recommend paying the premium fare, to get a result before next month? 2) In your experience, how likely is it to have a switch of sponsors refused? I would be moving into a shortage occupation job, in case that makes any difference. 3) If for any reason it all goes wrong and the switch of sponsors is refused, what are my options? Is it possible to ""un-resign""? Would I have to leave the country immediately? Thanks in advance. "
1843,Cheapest way for having a car in Singapore for 6 months/1 year,"Due to some circumstances I might need to go and stay for work in Singapore. What is the cheapest way to have a reasonable car in Singapore for 6 months to a year? I love the MRT in Singapore, but I need to have a car due to my long commute.   My commute will be around 30 minutes by car, and the reason for the car is that the work is in the high traffic/industrial area; and some taxis won't take me there! Unless I call them.

1849,US Immigration - Visa Retrogression,"I recently attended an interview with USCIS for my 'green card' in the EB-3 category.    Although my interview was 'successful', the USCIS officer advised me that he was not able to put my case through to be finalized and have my green card issued because the State Dept had issued their new Visa Bulletin for Aug 2019 and although my category was marked as 'Current' in the July bulletin, its priority date had been 'retrogressed' back to July 2016 in the August bulletin. Had my interview taken place one day earlier (July 31 instead of August 1), the July priority date would have applied and my green card been issued.  Once this 'retrogression' has taken place, does it sometimes get restored back to its previous state within the next few months, or is it most likely that my category will only once again become 'current' in the next year? If it's only likely to become current next year - when does 'next year' actually start? Would it be in October like other US immigration related appear to be, or will it only be January 2020? "

1852,Do I need a sponsorship for a Canadian work permit as an EU citizen?,"I am an EU citizen (under 25 years of age), with a Bachelor's and a Master's degree. I'm currently applying to Canadian positions, and often the application form has a question in the form ""Do you now or in the future require sponsorship to obtain work authorization?"".  I know that to apply for a work permit in Canada, I need a job offer. But do I need sponsorship? The role would be Software Engineer. I understand that the employer may have to file a LMIA (Labour Market Impact Assessment) request when hiring a foreign worker. Does that count as sponsorship?  I already determined that I do not qualify for Express Entry or other fast-track programs, so I would go for the regular ""work permit"" route. "

1854,Can I apply for a UK visa just to visit the Estonian Embassy in London?,"I just got hired in a company in Estonia as a web developer. I am Nigerian and there's no Estonian Representation here in Nigeria for long stay Visas.  I apparently just got back from Estonia o Tuesday(06/08/19) from a visit to the company for the final job interview. I applied through the Belgium embassy in Nigeria on the basis of a Job interview and was given a schengen Visa for 10 days(multiple entry). I got the Job offer and the visa expires by the end of August.   The mobility agent the company assigned to me suggested that I should apply for short stay Visas in either of the following embassies in Nigeria: UK, Cairo, India or Isreal. There are Estonian representations in these countries where I could then apply for long stay Visa.  There are a couple of challenges listed below:  1. Cairo often makes it difficult for Nigerians. They could hold one's passport for months and return it without a visa. It's therefore not an option for me.  2. Isreal only gives out visa to tour groups in Nigeria. It costs a fortune here to join a tour group. Pretty expensive. It's therefore not an option.  3. India too makes it terribly tough for Nigerians. It's a no go area.  This leaves me with UK. I've been to the UK as a minor twice(2005 and 2008). The UK transit visa is only valid for 48hrs and is therefore not an option since it'll take the Estonian embassy 2 - 4 days to process the long stay visa.  My best option now is to apply for UK short stay visa. But how do I explain that I'm coming to the UK to just apply for a long term visa for Estonia and then head from the Uk to Estonia right away  Will the UK find my reason for applying credible and give me a visa?  Or could there be any other way to approach this issue? "
1855,Can I change date of birth and name on US visa after entering US,"I am an international student currently studying in the USA. My actual date of birth is 15th May, 1996. But for some personal reasons, I have been using my DOB as 15th May, 1993 and all of my identity documents have the same DOB (including my passport and US visa).   My paternal grandmother was a US citizen, and she had submitted petition for my father for family based immigration. And there, she used my real DOB (15th May, 1996). She also changed my name in the petition (My real name is Fatima Akbar Shelly, where ""Fatima Akbar"" is my first name and ""Shelly"" is my last name. All of my identity documents have this name. But in the petition, she put my name as ""Fatima Akbar"", where ""Fatima"" is my first name, and ""Akbar"" is my last name.) I was unaware of this, hence I kept my DOB and name as I have always been using.  Now my question is:  What should I do in the above mentioned circumstances? I already have a valid US visa with my DOB as 15th May, 1993 and name as ""Fatima Akbar Shelly"". I have already got my Masters, and all of my educational and social documents also include the same DOB and name. Now, can I change my name (as ""Fatima Akbar"") and DOB (as 15th May, 1996) in all of the documents like visa, passport and all the educational and social documents in the US? Can I immigrate to US with my father? Please kindly help me with your kind suggestions. "

1857,"Transfer from F1 to H1B without OPT, H1B got approved","I’m currently a second-year Ph.D. student holding an F1 visa. Due to the bad relationship with my advisor, I quit from the current Ph.D. program in April (actually, my adviser stop my funding to force me to leave the US.). However, I found a company that willing to sponsor me a work VISA. My sponsor submitted the H1B petition in April and finally, I luckily got picked in the pool and the petition got approved (Case status: On May 23, 2019, we approved your Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker. We will mail your approval notice. Please follow the instructions in the notice). Now I’m waiting for the official documents.  As you all know, it is almost the fall semester when the regular international student must register the courses. To maintain my F1 status before I get the work VISA, I must register 9 credits hours as a full-time student in fall. Here come to my questions:   Do I have to register the course as usual to maintain my F1 status to stay in the US? (Since my VISA status is changing, I don’t know if I got some special period that I can legally stay in the US without registering as a full-time student.) In this summer semester, I registered 2 credits of CPT so that I could work for my sponsor in the summer. Can I register 2 or 3 credits CPT course in this upcoming fall as a part-time student and work for my sponsor again while maintaining my legal immigration status?   I do investigate the possibility of doing a part-time Ph.D. while holding an H1B. There is no confliction between H1B VISA and part-time student (It could be either self-supported or company sponsorship.). I hope I could register as fewer credits as possible but legally work for my sponsor to compensate for the living expense. My question is how can I maximize my benefits in the transition period (assuming I will receive the official H1B VISA by Oct 1st).   My case and description may be wordy, but I do need your help and advice. Please feel free to leave anything. Thank you in advance. "

I have been hired by an employer in Tokyo, but they have not told me my exact placement yet, and I have not booked a flight.  I just handed in my COE and other visa application stuff to the consulate. The guy who took my application noticed that I had put ""TBD"" for some fields on the form, and I explained that I was waiting to hear the exact placement details. He said that was fine, except for the ""Date of arrival in Japan"" which needed a specific date. After I wrote down an estimated arrival date, he clarified that it couldn't be changed, which presumably meant I could only arrive on that exact day.  My employer seems to think the date can be estimated and isn't set in stone. I also do not remember any entry date on my last entry visa for Japan.

My options and my doubts about those options are:  1) Apply for EEA family permit  a) Do you think I'm eligible to ask for EEA family permit?   b) In the case that I apply for EEA family permit, Do you know if I can work in the meantime?   c) In the case that I apply for EEA family permit, If I cannot work in the meantime:    * Can I convert my visa to a working visa [only in the case his contract will be extended and I found a job (qualified job)].    * Do I have to leave UK before the application of the working permit?    * How long do I have to stay outside UK before apply for a work permit?  2) If I apply for a tourism visa, instead of the EEA family permit  a) If I ask for a tourism visa, Can I ask right after a working visa in the case his contract will be extended and I found a job (qualified job)? Do I have to leave UK for some time before asking the working visa?  b) It would be a problem if I apply for a working visa right after my tourist visa expires (or before the tourism visa expires) ?

What documents exactly would a potential landlord want to see?  Could a landlord demand a higher deposit since I am new in the UK (and less predictable)? Or maybe a bank guarantee? Would an agency or private landlord be more flexible? Would it be easier to find something if I it has a time limit. This way, they know they get rid of the tenant, if it happens that he doesn't pay. Or do they prefer long term tenants? The French company I work for has no offices in the UK.  "

I know that it used to be 3 months for unfurnished and 1 month for furnished.  However, I was told that recently (within the past year) this has been dropped to 1 month even for unfurnished apartments, but only in certain popular areas in some cities.  Is this correct?  I am unable to find any references online. I am interested in Lyon and Villeurbanne in particular.  I am in a situation where I may not know 3 months in advance whether I will be able to keep a job in the same city or whether I will need to move (likely away from France).  Either way I am going to talk to the landlord well in advance and see if we can come to some agreement.  However, I do not expect that they will do anything for me beyond what is legally required.

Basically, the company is giving me the opportunity to spend some time in one of the international offices (I can choose which one) as an exchange program (the main purpose is to practice English). They will give me an extra budget to be spent for renting a room there and the flight.   The company is not happy about applying for a work visa. I will work under an Italian contract, and I know that it is quite common for some companies to arrange some training in its international offices.   My question is will this be acceptable? Can I apply only for the travel visa (3 months) or will it be rejected?  If this is relevant, I am a statistician with a Master's degree. "
1867,Working with an EEA family permit in UK,I’m not sure about what I have to do in order to work in UK with an EEA family permit in UK.   Can a non European work in UK with an EEA family permit? Can I work immediately? What is required in order to work in UK with this permit?  What are the rights with an EEA family permit? How does the health insurance work for a non European? Do I have to buy one?  I heard that we need some kind of number to give to the employer in order to work. Do you know what is that?  
1868,J1 visa - Confusion in how to apply,"I am a freelancer ( web dev ) and a student from India. The company I work for ( in USA ), asked me for a internship.

But I don't know any sponsor or even don't know where do I find them.  I have questions like:     What should the company?   What should I do?   Who are the sponsor and host?   I am having no guide in this. Can anyone guide me on this? Thank you very much in advance. "
1869,Bring wife from Germany to the UK,"I am asking on behalf of my brother.  My brother is a British national. He brought his wife from Afghanistan to Germany where he has been living and working for the last 4 months. Now, he is planning on coming to the UK.    Does he need to be working in the UK before he applies for a visa for his wife to enter the UK? What document(s) does he need in applying for his wife's UK visa?  When his wife comes to the UK, when does she apply for Indefinite Leave to Remain or a British passport? In the future, will she need to pass the English language test?  "
1870,Port Removal from Ireland and ILR Application in the UK,"I'm an Irish citizen; my girlfriend and I live in London. Last Christmas, we tried to go to Ireland on the boat, but my girlfriend didn't have her passport with her (she is Turkish and has a UK Self-Employed Visa). The immigration team at the port stopped her and sent her back on the boat as she didn't have the right documents.   They gave her a 2-page document:    The first page was directed to the Ship Company - a Carrier's Removal Direction under section 5(10)(b) of the Immigration Act 2003; The second page was addressed to her under the Immigration Act:       (g) that the non-national is not in possession of a valid passport or other equivalent document, issued by or on behalf of an authority recognised by the Government, which establishes his or her identity and nationality.   She has had tourist visas to Ireland twice before and the person at Port immigration told us that this sort of removal was not a big deal.   Now she is again applying for an Irish tourist visa, and one of the questions asks about removal from a port in Ireland. How will last year's removal affect getting a tourist visa?  Also, most importantly, she will be applying for an indefinite visa in the UK in February. How will this situation effects her ILR application? "

1876,Qualifying period for British Citizenship application,"Keeping the following in mind:   I have moved to the UK in 2001, and been in paid employment since 2002 I did apply for the PR certificate and obtained it in 2014. My application form was based on the period 2009-2014, but arguably i did achieve PR status in 2007. (5 years of residency) Since 2014 i have been in and out of the country for study and work.  Never for more than 2 years, so I haven't lost PR, but I might not fulfil the residency requirements for BC if based on the last 5 years.   Based on the above, my question is: can i shop around for the qualifying period for British Citizenship? In other words, can i base my BC application on the period, say, 2003-2008, given that by 2008 i had already had PR status for 1 years. Or can it only be based on the last 5 years? "
1877,Applying for a UK Spousal Visa from Moscow,"A spouse application has three parts: the passport, the form, and the supporting documents.    The procedure is that the applicant makes an appointment and reports to their cognisant application centre for their biometrics enrolment.

1878,Do I need to be locally based to get a job in Hong Kong?,"I am a UK national in my late twenties, currently working in London but planning to move to Hong Kong. I have 4 years experience working in IT consultancy. I work for a global company, but there does not seem to be a possibility for me to transfer internally any time soon. I have had minimal luck with applications made for HK roles over the last 7 months while I've been working in the UK (believe my remote location situation may be screening me out of some immediately).  If I were to resign from my UK job and turn up at a HK airport in a month's time, how likely would I be to find a comparable role within 3 months?  Without going in to specifics of my exact skills, experience and desired salary, some pointers from experienced expats on the following would be highly valued:   For someone requiring visa sponsorship, what is the likelihood is of finding a role in a professional occupation in HK within 3 months? Is it commonly achievable to do so without making a trade-off on living standards? Any advice for me to de-risk this move in general?  "
1879,Travel outside Canada during Post-Graduation Work Permit transition period,"I am planning to apply for Post-Graduation Work Permit on Jan 15, 2017. And I am considering traveling back to my home country between Jan 20 and Feb 12. My study permit expires in Dec 2017 which is one more year to go.  My concern is what if the work permit gets issued before Feb 11 and I actually have it with me while entering the border, I will only have my study permit. Will it still be valid at that point, or does it become invalid when a post-grad work permit is issued? My Temporary Resident Visa also expires in Dec 2017.  I saw a post by Mangara asking about the same matter, some answers were about implied status, which I don't think will be a issue for me.   Can anyone help me out please?  Thank you! "
1880,I have a 3 year German Aufenthaltserlaubnis in IT and I want to renegotiate my hours. What should I look out for?,"I'm a US expat holding a 3-year German Aufenthaltserlaubnis, and an unlimited work contract as a software developer.  I'm planning to re-negotiate my working contract to reduce my working hours from 40 hours to something like 24.  As I understand it, per TzBfG, because I've worked at my company for longer than 6 months, and because it employs at least 15 people, I have the right to request part-time hours, and my employer must negotiate with me, unless they can cite significant ""operational reasons"" why the request can't be accepted.  I'm unsure whether reduced working hours and reduced salary could have implications for my visa status.  Minimum salary? For instance, I know that the EU Blue Card for ""MINT"" workers requires a minimum salary of 37,752 €. So far I've found no such minimum for the Aufenthaltserlaubnis. Does such a minimum salary, or for example a minimum hourly work week, exist for the Aufenthaltserlaubnis?  Are there other concerns I haven't listed? For instance, will I need to contact the Ausländerbehörde when my contract changes? Would my visa status need to be reviewed? Could it adversely affect me when it's time to renew my visa?  Separately, I would not be at all surprised if they attempt to refuse my request, since I am a key member of a small team. However a second about TzBfG suggests that it is very difficult for an employer to prove that the costs / consequences of reduced working hours are ""disproportionate."" Does anyone have experience with this process?  Thanks in advance!   "

My cousin who has a business in USA has invited me to visit USA for 6 months. I will be staying with him and we both will be visiting many cities in USA as tourists. He will be paying for all of my trip as I do not have sufficient funds to fund my trip on my own. Can I work remotely for my US employer while in US?

Will I have to pay taxes in US if I work remotely for my employer?

1892,Article 10 UK residence card - travel restrictions & Evidence of right to reside in the UK,"I am married to an Irish national who has been living in the UK for more than 10 years. The article 10 stipulates the following:     evidence that your EEA national family member is in the UK, and evidence that they have a right of residence in the UK because: they have been in the UK for less than three months, or they are in the UK as a worker, self-employed person, self-sufficient person or student, or they have acquired a right of permanent residence in the UK under EU law.   As a lot of Irish citizens they do not require evidence to remain in the UK. I have an EEA-UK resident card that allows me to enter-remain in the UK. I have a conference to attend in Portugal and won't be travelling with my EU spouse. The question is what other evidence of his presence in the UK and any other evidence of his right to remain could ? bring since he is Irish?  I feel a bit confused.   Thanks. "
1893,"EU citizen from UK wants to live permanently with Japanese citizen, currently living in Germany, having a baby and wants to get married","I (British Citizen) and my Japanese long-term girlfriend (27 years old) live in Germany since July 2017. I use freedom to move EU rights, she uses a working holiday visa (valid 1 year). We both are currently employed. She is pregnant (5 weeks) and we are worried this may affect our right to live in the EU - Germany or UK - together.  We want to raise the child/have a family and get married in the future. We are concerned. Will the pregnancy void her right to live in Germany?  Will we both be able to live in Germany permanently? Or can we move to the UK in the future to be close to my family?  We would like to live in Germany but do not want to lose the right to move to the UK either before/after our child is born. Or if this is the case, we would like to return to the UK as we both speak English and my family is there, and will be much needed help when we have a child.  We intend to get married. In which country would be best to do this - Germany, UK or Japan?  We both have cohabited in Germany and registered our residence at the Bürgeramt here in Berlin since August 2017. We also lived together in the UK for a period of 2 months prior to our move to Germany from May 2017 to July 2017. Then Miku lived with me on a visitor visa (2 months) before our move to Germany, where we wanted to start our life together.  Miku has lived in the UK on a student visa (studying English) prior to this for 6 months from October 2016 to February 2017, before leaving to work in Japan (February 2017 - May 2017). We met and became a couple in October 2016 when she was studying in the UK.  We need advice. We want to know what our best option to continue living together is, especially since Brexit may affect my rights as a UK citizen in Europe. We want to raise our child together. Is it possible for us to have our child in Germany or the UK? How do we get married? Which country would be best for us to live in permanently - the UK or Germany?  If we were to return to the UK as an EEA family, would our rights be revoked after Brexit is final? If so, would it be better for us to apply for permanent residence in Germany as we want to settle and plan our life together?  So far I understand that I, as a EU resident in Germany, would be able to return to the UK with Miku if we got married, lived in Germany, and had been in employment and lived together as residents of Germany for more than 3 months - longer if possible. We are currently trying to integrate into the German society by working, paying taxes and insurance, trying to learn the language and also trying to enjoy our new life in the capital, Berlin. We would love to stay here forever, but are scared we could be forced to leave separately. With this in mind, we are considering whether it would be better to return to the UK to raise our future child and seek permanent residence in England, UK instead.  Summary:  Non-married couple - 1 UK citizen, 1 Japanese citizen seeking permanent residence together either in Germany or UK. If we do, is it possible for the non-EU family member to work as well?  Have an unborn child on the way (5 weeks pregnant).  We currently live together in Germany since July 2017. We have our residence registered with the authorities as we live at the same address together in Berlin since August 2017.  We both have work in Germany since August 2017. Previously lived in the UK, me as a UK citizen all my life, Miku as a Japanese citizen on a student visa, October 2016 - February 2017 and again on a visitor visa from May 2017 to July 2017).  We want to live together permanently with the right to raise our future child. We are considering either staying in Germany or returning to the UK. We want the right to marry and the right to have our child become a citizen of the country in which we live. "

1897,Health checkup (Gesundheits-Check-up) in Germany before 35 years old?,"It seems that in Germany, under public insurance, you're entitled to a full body health checkup every 2 years once you reach the age of 35 ([website]  Gesundheits-Check-up      Check-up (alle zwei Jahre) bei Frauen und Männern ab dem Alter von 35 Jahren: Ganzkörperuntersuchung mit Blutdruckmessung, Blutproben zur Ermittlung der Blutzucker- und Cholesterinwerte, Urinuntersuchung, ausführliches Gespräch mit dem Arzt.   However, what if somebody is over 18 but not 35 yet, but still wants to comprehensively check their health conditions? Do they have to pay the full cost of the health checkup in this case then (i.e. the public insurer bears absolutely no cost)? If so, approximately how much could the cost be? Is there any kind of health check that they might be able to perform under the coverage of a health insurance at all? "

1899,In Italy am I legally obligated to show proof of return when travelling with a residence permit near expiry?,"I am living in Italy with a residence permit renewable permit.  I was flying from Italy to Austria last month for a short weekend trip. At that time my permit was near expiry. Four days remaining to be exact.  There is no immigration control when travelling inside the Schengen area, so this happened at the boarding gate when providing ID proof to the airport staff (not immigration staff).  The airport staff at the counter saw that my permit was near expiry and asked me when I was returning, to which I stated Monday. Then she asked me for my return flight ticket.  At the time, I thought nothing of it. But later when I recounted the incident to my colleagues they asked why did I even show my return ticket, because they are not immigration officers and cannot ask for such proof.  Therefore I pose the question here, am I legally obligated to provide such proof to non border control personnel? If so, why?  My logic for ""no"" is if I wanted to remain outside my country of residence beyond my date of return, it doesn't matter if the expiry is three days or months from my date of travel.  My logic for ""yes"" is Why create a hassle? "
1900,Following up on Italian citizenship,"I applied for Italian citizenship early this year (around January). I was eligible to do so because of my Italian heritage.

1905,Tier 4 dependent visa refused - Administrative review guidance needed,"I have been doing my PhD from Newcastle university since 2013. I got married in October 2016. I went back to Pakistan to get married and stayed until December and then came back to finish my PhD. While I was in the final stages of my PhD, I could not bring my wife as I felt I would not be able to give her any time, as I was in the university from morning till late night finishing my thesis.  From January 217 to September 2017 I made 2 visits to Pakistan to be with my wife. Recently I finished my thesis and submitted it. So naturally I was confident I could now enjoy my time with my partner. She applied for her dependent visa on 6th September and got a decision yesterday. She was refused entry to the UK.  I performed extensive research before applying in hope of getting her accepted. The following documents were sent with the application.   A copy of recent bank statement (showing that I have adequate funds to sustain her). A copy of my passport and student visa (visa expiring March 2018). A copy of my UK driving license. A copy of my student ID card. A confirmation of enrolment letter from the school office (stating that I am enrolled in a PhD course from November 2013 to November 2017). The original and translated marriage certificate. Marriage photographs showing our marriage ceremony and function. Marriage invitation card. Some pictures from our honeymoon and our other trips together. Screenshots of our Whatsapp chat from when we first started talking in May 2016. Copy of tenancy agreement. Invitation letter. TB certificate   Below is the decision from the decision letter:     You have applied to join ____, who you state is your husband. I note a   marriage certificate dated 27 October 2016, and text conversations   covering a few months prior to the marriage (May – September 2016)   have been provided. However, you have provided no other clear evidence   of your relationship subsisting to the present date, or an intention   to live together permanently with your sponsor. Furthermore, I note   that you have stated you wish to travel on 23 October 2017, Mr ___    has been studying since late 2013 and is due to complete his course on   30 November 2017. I am not satisfied it is clear why this application   has been submitted now.      I am not satisfied to the balance of probability that your claimed   marriage is subsisting or that you and your sponsor intend to live   with the other as their spouse or civil partner throughout your   proposed stay in the UK. 319C (d)(e)      I have refused your visa application on this occasion because I am not   satisfied that you meet all of the requirements of paragraph 319C of   the Immigration Rules.   I have been allowed one administrative review.  I have some concerns with the decision. Firstly, it made no mention of the photographs I sent showing our marriage, our trips together, and the ECO even mentioned that nothing other than marriage certificate and chats were presented whereas we sent many pictures. Furthermore, the ECO stated that the chats provided were from May - September 2016, whereas I provided the chats from May 2016 - September 2017. He/She omitted an year of our conversations.  Is this normal for such info to be overlooked and not mentioned?  Also, the ECO states that I am to finish my course in November 2017 and she is scheduled to visit in October 2017. I believe the ECO thinks that my wife joining me for a month is pointless. Which is a fair point if I was doing a Master's or any other taught course.  I argue that I am doing my PhD, the school letter stating that I am to finish by November is my thesis submission deadline. I am to submit my thesis by end of November, after which the external examiners read the thesis and then a viva exam is arranged by the university. Any PhD graduate is aware of this and knows that this takes about 3 to 4 months. So I will most probably be staying until February 2018. On this point I feel it is justified to want to have my wife join me for these 5 months.  Thank you for reading this far, and I appreciate your expert opinions in this matter. Do I have a chance for review? Will my points make any difference? Do my points even seem valid to anyone else other than me? "
1906,Selecting a health plan in Texas,"It's possible that I may move to Texas next year. Ignoring any potential legislation changes, I'd like to understand what my options are going to be, health-care-wise. I will likely earn a respectable salary, so I don't expect to need to be very stingy and look for the cheaper options - but I have heard health care is incredibly expensive in the US and that the health insurance companies may rip people off or exploit their poor choices of plans etc.   Specifically:   What are the different classes or categories of health coverage or health plans? I know that there are plans which are offered following the Affordable Care Act, but that those are kind of sub-par, and that there's such a thing as ""cadillac plans"". According to this page, there are only 3 health care providers to individuals: Blue Cross/Shield, FirstCare, Oscar Insurance. Are these indeed the only places I should be looking for health coverage options? My employer will likely offer me some kind of plan - they're just starting to set these things up so there are no details yet. Is it typically a good idea or a bad idea to opt for the plans employers offer? (I don't mean terribly exploitative employers, but rather - small tech companies.) Or - do employers, even small ones, typically get better conditions than what you can get as an individual? Are there some kind of health-care ""consumer"" collectives or cooperatives for bargaining with care providers? Perhaps something the labor unions have?   Note I didn't ask for recommendations for any specific plans since I assume that would be somewhat opinion-based and possibly biased. "
1907,Can I get a(n internationally-recognized) Debit card in the Netherlands?,"Some airline companies (easyJet in particular) don't seem to offer payment with iDEAL, but do seem offer a reduced fee (quite significantly reduced - 9 EUR or so) for using a debit card, e.g. Mastercard Debit or Visa Debit.  Can I get one of those issued in the Netherlands?  Also, assuming the answer to the first question is affirmative: I have an ABN AMRO bank account and an ICS Mastercard (a credit card); do those help me / make it cheaper for me to get such a debit card? "
1908,Long stay in the US of unmarried partner with B2,"I moved to the US with a O-1 visa. I have a relationship with my partner, we live together but we are not married. She moved to the US with me under a B2 visa, since we read it is common that unmarried couples use the B2 visa for these purposes if they are cohabitating partners. We plan to be in the US up to three years.  After the interview in the consulate, she got a multiple entry visa that is valid for 10 years. However, the consulate officer told us she won't be able to live in the US. In fact, after landing in the US, the border officer put a stamp on her passport valid for 6 months (we passed the border together). We will visit our home country (and come back to the US) before those 6 months.  My questions are:   Can I safely suppose the border officer will renew her stamp for at least 6 months more after coming back from our home country? Is it possible to get a stamp for 1 year? Otherwise, is it possible that a border officer denies her entry after entering the US several times with the same B2 visa?  "
1909,Shipping personal effects from USA to Italy,"I am soon relocating from USA (New York, NY) to Italy. I have a bunch of personal effects (e.g., clothes, books, a game console, some souvenirs) that I would like to ship to Italy. I think I can fit these into two large boxes, say max 60-65 lbs (30 kg) each (probably less).  Any suggestion on how to do that in a relatively cheap (and secure) way? I have been looking at prices on UPS, FedEx, and DHL, and they are astronomical. Time is not a primary concern, it may take up to a couple of weeks (as long as it is secure).  Also, how to avoid VAT or customs? All of these are personal belongings. "
1910,Dependent visa for France,"I'm Swathi and recently entered France on a student visa, for a 2 year program. The visa is for one year only and then I'll need to extend my stay.  I want to know if my spouse can join me in France on a dependent visa now. as I have been a resident for exactly one month, or should I wait a few months? If my spouse comes here, can he work full or part-time on a dependent visa? "
1911,Travel with récépissé for Carte de Séjour,"My wife (Canadian) just got a récépissé for her Carte de Séjour application. The agent told us she cannot travel until she receives her CdS!  Unfortunately we already booked a trip to North America for the week before our appointment, and we cannot delay that trip.   Can we get into any trouble when we re-enter France? We will carry our marriage certificate with us (I am EU citizen). What I am more concerned about: could we have an issue at the Prefecture appointment afterwards if they see (e.g. from a passport stamp) that we left the country while waiting for the CdS?   I asked an earlier question on this topic, but now the situation is more specific.  (Added info: at the time of our re-entry, we will have spent less than 90 days in Schengen and only about 40 days in France. When I mentioned the upcoming trip to the agent, she basically advised to not show the récépissé at the border and not get a passport stamp, or otherwise she said we'd have to start the whole process over...) "
1912,Home country address or U.S address in DS 160 form for H4?,"My husband's H1 B is approved and H1B status starts on Oct 1st, 2017. I'm planning to travel to India (home country)in November. In the form DS 160 for H4 visa, should I enter my home country address or my current US address? Also, when asked for ""spouse's address"", should I write his Indian home address or our current U S  address? "
1913,Applying for b1 visa before starting employment,"1) I have recently left my employer to take up a job with another company. I have another 3 weeks to go before joining the new employer.   However the new employer wants me to process my B1 visa so that I can travel to USA in the 1st week of joining to attend a 2 week training. This means I will have to attend the visa interview before I joining the new employer. Will this cause issues in the interview?  2) Also since I have not joined the new company yet, I do not have any payslips to show the visa officer. What can I do to fix this problem?  3) Finally, since I am technically between jobs, which company should I list as my current employer in the DS-160 form.  Please advice me on this. "
1914,Get BSN and bank accounts in the Netherlands for me and my partner,"I found a job in the Netherlands and now my future employer needs to arrange a working visa for me.  I will relocate with my partner, and the visa for her has to be arranged by ourselves. She will not work for some time once we'll relocate.  Currently we are citizens of a non-EU country.  Recently my employer has contacted me and told me that I need to:   Register as a non-resident in person in the Netherlands. After this, I'll get my BSN (social security number). With this BSN I should open my bank account in the Netherlands. And I also should provide my employer with the address in the Netherlands where I registered (I doubt I need to at this point).   The process looks a bit complicated and the employer doesn't answer very fast, so hopefully you can shed light and answer some of my questions.   Am I understanding it right that at first I should register as a non-resident for my employer to apply for a visa for me and once I get my visa I'll register as a resident (I won't live in the Netherlands/EU while visa is getting arranged)? Should I register at the city hall (such as Amsterdam City Hall)/local city office or just visit a local tax office (in Amsterdam or any other Dutch city)? My thought is that I can use a local tax office to get my BSN, since at first I register as a non-resident. Should I choose a city other than Amsterdam to speed up the process? If I register as a non-resident, can I do it without an address in the Netherlands? I want to find an accommodation once my working visa is issued, not before. I was told I will get my bank account instantly. But how long getting a BSN will take? Will I manage to get a BSN in 1-2 days? Or I will need to wait for 1 week? Or if I apply at the local tax office, even in Amsterdam, will it be fast? Since I will relocate with my partner and we have to arrange the visa for her ourselves, should I travel this time with her to get BSN and bank account for her also? Or this is not necessary and she won't need all of this until I get my own visa? What is the perfect time to apply for a visa for my partner? Once my visa is issued or before?  "
1915,Do real estate agents in Melbourne actively help you find a rental?,"I'm from Amsterdam and here it's very common for expats to get active assistance from real estate agents who will select rental properties based on your requirements/preferences and then take you for an afternoon/day to view these properties. Do they also do this in Melbourne? And if so, can anyone recommend me some agencies?  If not, what expectations should I have regarding the time it will take me to find a rental? I was thinking to arrive in Melbourne 10 days before having my first working day at my new job, thinking that would be enough to find an apartment and get settled. Am I being unrealistic here? "
1916,How to find the best place for currency exchange in the UK?,"I've recently moved to London and brought some foreign currency (namely, US dollars) in cash with me. What would be the best place to exchange these for pounds?  I'll open a bank account soon, but I'm not sure if banks here provide good exchange rates (this is definitely not the case in my home country). In addition, I've heard many exchange offices charge very high commission, so I was wondering what's the ""standard practice"" here (e.g. is there a website that compares exchange rates that would allow me to find the best option)? "
1917,Apply for Bulgarian residence permit after marrying a Bulgarian woman?,I have a Bulgarian girlfriend and we are going to marry but am now in Egypt. What's the best solution to go to Bulgaria and marry her or she come to Egypt and then apply for D visa and then travel to Bulgaria and apply for residence? If I marry her in Egypt what requirements for me and her to make sure that I will get the D visa? 
1918,Can I apply for a German registration certificate [Meldeschein] as a resident of a flat-share?,"I'm a U.S. software developer looking to re-locate to Berlin. I will be seeking a limited residence permit (Aufenthaltserlaubnis) which requires a local registration (Meldeschein.)  I understand that one must apply for the Meldeschein within 14 days of arrival in Berlin (this period varies by locality,) and to do so one must provide proof of German residence in addition to one's passport.  Articles which discuss this process frequently define such ""proof of residence"" as a lease or a rental contract.[1] I've found one in particular which expands on this criteria: ""Rental agreement, lease, or confirmation letter.""[2]  With the understanding that flat-shares often involve less formality than rents and sub-letting, my question is: can I reasonably expect to apply for the Meldeschein as a resident of a Wohngenmeinschaft flat-share?  Am I likely to find a WG which will include me in their rental agreement / contract / lease? Is there any difference between these, or do they just mean lease / lease / lease?  Notes   e.g., [website][website]"
1919,"Is it true that you don't need a degree to work as an ""IT specialist"" in Germany? What exactly classifies as ""IT specialist"" in this context?","I've already seen the questions Do I need a degree in IT to apply for an EU Blue Card as a software engineer or is any degree enough? and What&#39;s my degree worth in Germany?. Both answers state that you'd have to get your degree recognized in order to work as a software engineer in Germany.   However, on DAAD's website, there's a document (page 5) stating that for ""IT specialists"" and ""language teachers"", there's no need for any degree at all:      For jobs requiring qualified professional training, approval may be issued for qualified workers with a recognised degree or a foreign university degree equivalent to a German university degree (Section 27 No. 1 Employment Regulation), to IT specialists (Section 27 No. 2 Employment Regulation) or language teachers (Section 26 Employment Regulation).   Also, in the question Blue Card vs Regular Work Permit for IT Specialists, the OP states he already works as an ""IT specialist"" on a regular work permit in Germany but doesn't have any degree. So I'm quite confused.  One explanation I've come up with is that to apply for a Blue Card you do still need a degree, while to apply for a regular German work permit you don't need a degree. I'm not sure if such an interpretation of the above information makes much sense.  Also, I'm not sure what the term ""IT specialist"" exactly means. It seems that any software engineer should classify but I can't find the place where an exact definition is given. "
1920,Can an EU citizen move to another EU country to work remotely at a job not in the EU?,"If I were a dual citizen of the United States and Italy and had a job in the Untied States that I could perform remotely, could I move to an EU country other than Italy and work remotely for the U.S. company while living in Europe?  How would taxation and health insurance work? Does freedom of movement to work apply if the job is not actually based in the place you hope to move, but could be performed from there? "
1921,J1 Research Scholar visa and 12 months bar,"I have been on a J1 student intern visa this spring, visa covering the period from Feb 9, 2015 to Aug 7, 2015 (180 days, or 5 months and 25 days). Am I subject to the twelve months bar that comes with the J1 Research Scholar visa? I have not been able to find a definitive clear condition on the bar. Does it apply if the stay was >=180 days, or >=6 months?  Also, I used the 30 day grace period to get settled end of January and left early September, does this grace period count towards the J1 stay length?  Finally, if I am subject to this bar, is there any alternative? I might get offered a research position at a university and I'm looking at visa options. H1B might be another option but more lengthy and cumbersome to get? "
1922,Soon to be PhD Applied Math graduate looking to emigrate UK for better life quality. Just not sure where?,"Soon to be PhD Applied Math graduate looking to emigrate from UK. I hold a British passport and hence have access to the EU countries.   Unfortunately the UK doesn't seem to treat its STEM graduates very well. Given the number of years of education it has taken to gain these skills, and factoring in both the cost and lack of earning, the  compensation and stability is really very poor; particular so in engineering and academia. Let me be clear that I'm not looking to become mega rich or a free ride, however with the house prices, rental and living costs etc a middle class lifestyle in the UK is all but dead for my generation. I am also looking at quantitative finance jobs, however they are getting harder to come by.   I am therefore looking to emigrate from UK, however I'm really struggling to find information on  PhD level jobs abroad in countries that offer a good standard of living. Has anyone else in a similar situation made this leap? Are there any website that offer advice? "
1923,Am I entitled to benefit from the Egypt-US tax treaty?,"I applied to the tax treaty between the US and Egypt under article 22 for the years 2012 and 2013.  This is because I find the following conditions apply:   I was a resident in Egypt before I came to the US. I am invited by a university (by Columbia University through an H-1B visa). My work is in the public interest (funded by the department of defense). The expected period of employment (at the time when I came) did not expected to exceed two years.   However, I got an IRS audit that disallows the treaty because they claim condition 4 has not been met, because in my visa petition, it is mentioned that the intended period of employment is three years (my H-1B visa is three years by the way). My invitation letter also states that the project is expected to be for a minimum of two years.  However, my initial contract (and all subsequent contracts) was for one-year. My invitation letter was for one year as well. Yes, it states the project is expected to be for a minimum of two years, but this is not guaranteed because is depends on the funding and my performance.. etc. Additionally, my employer believes there was no expectation to exceed two years, and the three-year thing in my visa petition is just a routine done by the university for everybody to decrease the amount of possible future paperwork. The employer sent my auditor a letter indicating all of this to support my case, but the auditor is still inconvenienced.  Now, who is right, the auditor or me? Should I appeal? I appreciate you help. Thank you! "

1925,Dual citizenship uk/us. Moving back with family,"I am a UK born that moved to US, married and became naturalized early this year. I've been in the US for 13 years. My husband is a US citizen by birth.  I have two elementary aged kids that I believe automatically have dual citizenship too.  We are looking into relocation to UK and what it would take.    Even though my kids are now dual citizens, is it truly automatic, or do we still have to apply/register them as UK citizens?  If we do have to apply, is this easier done before entering UK? Which route should be taken to adjust my husband's status? And how soon would he be able to work?  "
1926,Studying in the Netherlands for one year; Must my children go to school?,"I am going to relocate to the Netherlands next spring and stay there for about a year. I am moving there with my children, and would like to know whether they must attend local school?  Is it possible to have the children at home, and teach them myself? (I would prefer them to learn to read and write in their native language during the year, instead of trying to learn a new language to speak.) "
1927,Australian freelancer moving to France,"I am a freelance medical writer/editor and would like to live and work in France. I would plan to keep working for my Australian clients. In that situation would I need a visa to live in France? I can provide evidence of good income and ongoing commitments from Australian clients. If I am allowed to live there under these circumstances, would I be expected to pay tax in France on my Australian income? I assume I would have to have private health insurance. "
1928,Offered contract while visiting husband who teaches in England on Tier 2 visa. Options?,"I am a US citizen visiting my spouse who teaches in the UK on a Tier 2 visa and have been offered a consulting contract (and temporary visa sponsorship) with a college in the UK for the next 2 months.  I have been told by immigration professionals that I must return to the US to apply for a visa which would further delay and possibly negate my contract work opportunity.  What are my options since my spouse is only tier 2?  Is there any way for me, as a US citizen visiting the UK on my passport only, to get a temporary work or other visa while I am in the UK or do I have to return to the US to apply?  Thank you very much for your help!!! "
1929,US permanent resident working as an independent contractor in Spain,"I am a permanent resident in the US. I've been offered a part-time job as an overseas software developer for a very small company in Spain. Their idea is that I'll give them invoices for the software I'd make, working from my home in the US. I don't have experience with taxes beyond being taxed as an employee in the US and my home country (not the US or Spain), and I wonder, is this even feasible and reasonable? I'm trying to find out if all the work setting everything up is worth the trouble.  I'd have to register myself as an independent contractor in the US, first thing. Can I then bill somebody overseas? Do I have to file US and Spain tax returns? (I guess I don't have to file a Spain tax return since I'm not a resident). Is there something else I need to consider? "
1930,Moving around EU as a UK EU citizen,"I am a remote worker currently living in the UK, homeowner, with my own ltd company, working for UK clients.  I use things like upwork and freelancer sites to carry out my work, invoice etc and pay taxes to HMRC in the UK.  I am planning to move next year and rent a place in Spain for probably more than the 90 days I keep hearing about, maybe 6 months, after renting out my place (all declared to UK above board etc) in the UK.   What I'm struggling to understand and get others views on how they do it, to long term rent somewhere in Spain, with the view I may come back etc for work - but simply rent and not need to pay double tax?  I possibly will need insurances, a bank account and to buy a car etc, but I am not earning income or providing services within Spain - basically I'm just doing it to stay in warmer climes!  Does anyone have any UK EU to EU experiences they can share?  I'm not trying to dodge taxes, local NI or responsibilities but I find it hard to see how remote workers get by? "
1931,UK car rental 12 month resident having foreign and UK licence,"I have two licenses:   A full not expired Omani (foreign) licence that I have owned for 5 years. A full not expired UK one I got by passing my test 1 month ago. I did this because a UK resident isn't allowed to use a foreign licence after 12 months.   Renting a car with most companies in the UK requires you to have had a licence for at least 1 year. My UK licence doesn't meet this requirement but Omani one does. Conversely my Omani one isn't legal to drive with (as I am resident for more than 12 months) but my UK one is.  My questions are:   Can I rent a car in the UK with my Omani Licence and if police stops me I show my UK licence as proof? Will I be insured? I am worried my insurance is on my Omani Licence which is illegal to drive with since it's been 12 months residency so if I ever try and claim they will say I wasn't insured on my UK licence. If I won't be insured from question 2, can I buy insurance against my UK licence so even if I hired a car using my Omani licence which invalidates the insurance provided by the car rental company I will still be covered by this new insurance I got? Normal insurances require you to give the car's number plate beforehand so not sure how this would work for car hire or if there even is a service like this available.   Do note that when talking to some companies like Hertz they basically said they will book on my Omani one and not put in the records I own a UK one or that my Omani one is invalid since I'm a resident, this is why I am most worried about whether I am insured or illegally driving with no insurance! "
1932,"Internship in Germany for recent US university graduate, visa?","I'm a US citizen who just received an offer for a paid internship that has potential to turn into a full-time position later on (for now, the internship duration will be 3 months). Though it is an internship, since I am no longer an actual student, do I just apply for a normal, general employment visa or is there another visa I need to apply for?  Also, do I need to be registered at a residence (Anmeldung) before I apply for the visa (I'm already staying in Berlin)? "
1933,Options for EU person to move to Spain without a having secured apriori a job,"Both my girlfriend and I are EU citizens (same country) and recently I moved to Spain as I got a job in Madrid. Now, we are planning for my girlfriend to also come along, but the problem is we couldn't find her a job a priori as her field of expertise is rather too specialized (bachelor in classical studies). Also all study programs like the bachelor, masters program at the local universities require a knowledge of spanish (B1 level), which she doesn't speak yet.   I talked to the Spanish consulate in my home country and they said it is possible for an EU person to live in Spain without having a job if they can prove they have the financial means to do so (but didn't clarify what this means, ie what amount of money etc) and a health insurance.   The main problem (and vicious circle) that I foresee is how can you prove you have the financial means to live there without a bank account, which you can only open if you are registered, which you can only do if you can prove you can afford to live there!!!  So, my question is: is it possible for an EU citizen to move to Spain for a long term (>90 days) without a job or having been accepted to a university, but also manage to register properly with the authorities (get a NIE) and open a bank account and all that? If so can you share you experience and any possible options I missed?  PS.1 A friend suggested contacting an abogado (lawyer) who specializes in these kinds of things, but before I do that I would like to get some input first :)  PS.2 I know she can come as a tourist for 90 days and then try to find something, but she is reluctant to do so I'm afraid...

1935,Question of Tier 2 Work Visa - UK,"I was on a UK Tier 2 Work Visa which was issued for three years and which has just expired. I left the UK permanently on the day before the expiry date of the visa. The position I was working in (research) was a fixed-term contract (3 years).  Can I apply for another position in the UK? If I am selected, naturally, the organization will apply for a Cert. of Sponsorship.  But I was recently given to understand that the UK does not allow for Work Permit holders whose permits have expired/ ended to apply for a new work permit for a period of 12 months from the date of expiry of their previous work permit.  Is this accurate? I have not been able to find any such information on the Border Agency site but I was told this verbally by a UK Immigration Lawyer.  Any inputs on this would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!  Edit (new): Above I mentioned the point about the 12 month timeframe. More accurately, I was told by this lawyer that the 12-month limit actually is from the day you leave the UK evidenced by the arrival stamp on your passport as the UK does not issue an exit stamp on your passport.  Edit: I had posted this question to this site's sister site and was redirected here. "
1936,Returning goods bought online in Poland as foreigner,"I am a Czech national living just at the Polish border. I want to buy a laptop online at Polish online store called Morele.net. The store offers the goods to be sent to a Polish post office for pickup (Poczta Polska - Odbiór w Placówce). I am able to fill my Czech address on their site for invoicing and still get the ""pickup at post"" option. Am I eligible for the 14-day return period that is offered by the company (zwrot) just in case there is a problem with the goods?  The terms of the site are here:   Zwrot zakupionego towaru w ciągu 14 dni (odstąpienie od umowy) Zwrot zakupionego towaru w ciągu 14 dni - English translation by Google Wzór odstąpienia od umowy Regulamin sklepu Morele.net   The main question is whether these conditions (and polish laws) apply for a non-polish national too when the business is done in Poland (pickup at post). I guess the 14-day return period is a part of polish law (Czech law has exactly the same thing too).  Does anyone have experience with such return? My guess would be since both Czech Republic and Poland are members of European Union, the terms should be the same for all EU citizens? In case of the return, I would simply send the laptop back to Morele from a Polish post office. "

Now I want to take my wife and child along with me. I am planning to take a tourist Visa for them and after they come to Italy, I would like to apply for Family Reunion so that they don't go back after 90 days validity of tourist Visa.  Is this possible? I have applied for Residence Permit (permisso di soggiorno) for myself and it may take three months to get that and apply for Family Reunion.

1938,"Do I need to pay the property tax under ""Box 3"" in the Netherlands if not renting out the apartment?","I am considering buying an apartment in Amsterdam where I would stay for weekends while working in Switzerland during the week. I would not rent out the apartment nor reside in the Netherlands. Thus, would I need to pay the ""Box 3"" tax on property? Is it tax that you pay automatically as a property owner or you only need to pay it if you actually rent the apartment out? I am from a EU country.  "
1939,How long does it take to renew carte de sejour?,"I finally got my carte de sejour in France.  It took nearly 7 months.  It is valid only for 1 year starting from the date of my application, i.e. valid for the next 5 months only.  Given that the first time it took 7 months to process it, how long will it take to renew it?  When do I have to apply for renewal?  How will the renewal process affect my ability to travel outside of France?  During the 7 months waiting period I could not leave without having to get a new visa and restart the whole process. "
1940,"As an Australian, can I get a work visa for France without returning to Australia?","I'm currently on a working holiday visa in France and employed, and I have been offered a CDI (permanent contract) along with visa sponsorship. But I wanted to know how I go about processing this.   I know I cannot extend the Working Holiday Visa, but all the information I can find on standard working visas indicate I'll need to go back to Australia to hand in my passport/file the paperwork.  Can I not just apply to have the paperwork done here, and activate the new visa the next time I hop over to the UK and back?  Basically, if I am Australian and have been offered a CDI in France along with visa sponsorship, can I make the visa applications in Europe somewhere? "

My questions are:   My uncle (brother of my mother) is an Italian national; can I apply for an EEA family permit as the extended family member of Italian citizen? What proof should I present to relate myself to my uncle?  I have some documents such as my birth certificate and the birth certificates of my uncle and my mother. I have a certificate from the municipality (comune) that shows that my uncle and I have lived in the same house in Italy for more than 3 years My uncle is self employed, so he has sufficient funds to support me during the visit to the UK.

How ever the first organization where I have worked for 2 years that I worked was closed and I am not able to reach any one from management of that organization. Hence my question is  If I unable to get the experience letter for those 2 years, how it is impacting my GC? If there is any negative impact how can I minimize it? "
1943,Paying bill in Switzerland,"I am new to Switzerland (Suisse Romande, French speaking part) but I do hold a Swiss citizenship so I have to fill the same paper as all Swiss citizens.  Anyway I have to pay my health insurance (prime d'assurance maladie) but I have no idea how to do it, there are a few choices, I chose ""bulletin de versement"" thinking it would be easy but it seems that I cannot pay using only the 2 series of number they gave me.  I contacted the insurance saying I would like to pay by BVR (at La poste) or by payment card, they told me I can fill an empty BVR with the number they gave me with the bulletin de versement.  Anyone knows how to do it ? In this case can I pay with my card ? (last time I paid to La poste I could only pay in cash...)  Or better, anyone knows how I have to proceed to make a bank transfer or pay with a payment card ?  (keep in mind that the way to pay a bill is very different in Switzerland than in the rest of Europe so any answer from other European countries experience might no work here) "
1944,Remote work employed in non-resident country,"I am wondering about the legal details of a work situation. I would work remotely for a company that's not in the country I reside. That would mean the following situation:   I am a citizen of country A I am a resident in country B I am an employee of a company based in country C   I am specifically wondering about whether it is legal to be an employee of a company based in this country C (and receive income in this country in the currency of this country) without being a resident and without any visa.  What authority in this country may I contact to know whether this is allowed? Immigration services (even though I would not be a resident)? Tax services (I assume I would pay taxes there anyway)? some other labour authority?  My current knowledge is that countries usually allow residence and work if the person holds a specific visa, but in that case I am not a resident of that country, hence my question.  In short: does being an employee of a company based in a country C require any particular autorization? And which authority would be in charge? "
1945,Visa Change in Germany,"If a person visiting Germany from Pakistan marries a Dutch Girl in Germany, can he change the visa without leaving or will he have to leave?  Secondly what will be the process for Applying for a residence permit? "
1946,Blue card + starting my own business,"Are Blue Card holders in Germany allowed to start a business besides their work as an employee?  I'm a non-EU engineer, with a blue card, working fulltime in a company in Germany.  I want to cofound a GmbH or mini-GmbH (UG) to work on my own project in my free time.   Assuming that my current employer will let me have my own business in my free time, Do you think the immigration office will also let me do this thing? What do I need to do in order to get the required permission?  P.S. My work permit is only for working in the current company. There is nothing mentioned about letting me be the director manager of a company. "
1947,"US Expat, married foreign girlfriend while on vacation in the US, returned to her home country together. Visa process","I live and work in Hong Kong as a US Citizen.  In June of this year I attended a conference in the US, and after my girlfriend flew to the US on a valid tourist visa and we did a vacation trip around the US.  While on this trip we got married, finished the trip, and returned to Hong Kong.  With the civil unrest developing in Hong Kong, I am looking for opportunities outside of Hong Kong.  One obvious options is to seek a job in the US, however I want to try to minimize separation, as not only is it not healthy for our relationship but again the civil unrest in Hong Kong as well as the costliness of paying for an apartment in Hong Kong.  She does currently still have the valid tourist visa in her old passport with her old name.  Would I be looking at the full 1 year process before she could come to the US?  If I end up not finding a job in the US is it possible to maintain the immigration visa we obtain for her to enter the US and receive the temporary green card for a few years until I do get a job in the US?

1948,Can my mother get Czech citizenship through this new law that was recently passed in the Czech parliament?,"I am currently having a hard time finding a long form version of this law in English, but I have some basic information about my mother if y'all can help. Here's a list of facts followed by a list of questions.    One side of my mother's family is Czech, through her father. My mother's great grandparents were born in Czechia in 1863, 1859, 1862,and 1865. These great grandparents were married in Czechia in 1884 and 1880. We have records of these births and marriages that are all displayed in Czech archives. We have immigration records to the United States from one group, and death records from another.  My mother's grandparents on the Czech side of her family were born in Czechia in 1886 and 1880, and were married in 1905 before immigrating to America in 1906. There are census records and births in the United States, along with immigration records that confirm this. They died in the 1940s in the United States, after living there for 40 years. The grandfather applied for US Citizenship, whereas the grandfather did not.  My mother's father was born in 1913 in the United States. Her mother gave birth to her out of wedlock in 1959, and our family was aware of the father and his family for quite some time. His brother was born in Czechia in 1906 and was naturalized in the USA later. Basically, my mother was born out of wedlock in 1959 and genetics tests prove the fact as well, proving her relationship to her Czech grandparents. My mother's mother is irrelevant, her family was is from the USA for a very long time.  As stated, we have extensive records of all of this.   The questions are:    Does she qualify for Czech citizenship under this new law?  If not, why? If yes, could this citizenship be passed to her children and grandchildren?    Thank you for your time.   "
1949,UK work permit for US citizen?,"How does it work, for a US citizen to get a UK work &amp; residency permit?   Is a job offer necessary? I presume tourist visa is enough to visit &amp; look for work? "
1950,Does student permit refusal from one country affect a student permit for another country?,"I am an Indian citizen, I applied for a tourist visa in Canada, in 2014. It got rejected as I had no travel history and on other grounds. My maternal uncle is a citizen of Canada and my mother is a single mother in India they gave us a refugee status claim reason. We assumed that it was because my uncle lives there.  In 2016 they again rejected my tourist visa on financial, and purpose of visit grounds. I was again confused as to why they refused it, as we were going to visit our uncle.  I created a travel history and travelled to Singapore and Malaysia.  In 2019: Thinking that previously I was a minor and now I am an adult I would overcome what happened in the past I applied for a student permit as I got accepted in York University I filed the visa under sds category. It still got rejected saying that I wont leave Canada after my stay (purpose of visit).  Now its Aug 2019, I am thinking of going for the February intake in Australia for my higher studies.  Keeping in mind I do not have the best luck with visas is it safe to apply to an Australian University and then apply for a visa?  Do Canada and Australia share immigration information? Do Commonwealth countries share immigration information such as previous rejections?  Will the past Canadian refusals effect my Australian visa application? "
1951,Changing title in the same company under Blue Card,"I have blue card, and I want to change my role within the same employer. Working hours, address, and salary are all same as well. Do I need to get approval from Foreigners Office?   I haven't competed 2 years yet.   Berlin Foreigner Office says ""it's not necessary if the name of your occupation changes, although the employment modalities continue  to correspond to those in the job description"". What is meant by ""modalities""?  Thank you  "
1952,Australia PR - Role of HR,"I am HR by profession. I have 11 years of experience (10 with different companies and 1 with consultancy).  As on date, I am able to see only two roles under for my portfolio; Human Resource Manager and Recruitment Consultant falling under STSOL list.   I am in search of answers for following questions  1) Should proceed with my immigration process under STSOL list?  2) What happens once the term ends? 3) Are there chances that these job roles would be active for longer time? Actually 2 months back there was a 3rd role of HR Adviser which is now inactive. 4) Since I am processing my immigration process on my own, I need a sample experience letter format which is one of the ACS requirement.

1953,"Specific case scenario, when to apply for citizenship?","I want to apply for citizenship, and my case is as follows: I became a lawful permanent resident of the US on 07-31-2014, but l left the country for more than a year (from that date to 11-13-2015 the date I returned to the US). Then, on May 19, 2018, I left the country and stayed abroad for 3 months. And, finally, I visited my country (Iraq) on May 13, 2019 and stayed for 3 months.  In nutshell my trips are:   So, my questions are:   Am I eligible to apply for citizenship? When to apply, exactly?    Notes:   I paid taxes for all years after becoming a permanent resident. All my trips were to my country of birth: Iraq.  "
1954,Is it allowed to work ONLINE on F-1 visa?,"As I've understood, its not allowed to work off campus on F-1 visa. However what about online freelance work, for example something on fiverr or some other freelance website? Is that against the law too? I couldn't find information related to it. "
1955,"Can I stay in Europe if I'm waiting for work visa for Germany after a work visa for sweden, but the swedish work visa expires","Pretty much everything is in the question.  My girlfriend is from the US and has been working in Sweden for a couple of years now. She has applied for a work visa for Germany as she got a job there. However, the application is taking a long time and the Swedish visa will expire while she waits.  She will have to pick up her visa in Stockholm but she has a flat in Germany only at that point.   Can she stay in the EU while waiting for her application to be processed ? Can she move between Sweden and Germany? "
1956,"Flagpoling for study permit - Ontario, Canada","I arrived to Toronto using an eTA (I come from a visa exempt country)  before my study permit was issued. After a long story in the borders office at the airport, I was given a TRV until mid September and I would have to work things out by then. They also told me I would have to pass the Canadian borders and come back in order to activate my study permit after receiving the correspondence letter.  2 days later my permit gets approved so I found out that what I have to do is called flagpoling.  It turned out that flagpoling is a thing that people do in order to get their papers done faster. After reading a lot of Niagara flagpoling experiences from people pursuing a faster procedure, it occured many times that border officers denied service after a certain number of people per day (on a first come first serve policy).  tl;dr If I have no other way than crossing the borders to activate the study permit, is there still a  chance that I will get denied of service? Also should I just visit the bridge the earlier I can or just any of the working times (8am-midnight) should do?  edit Consulate people were more ignorant than me (or acted like this) so here I am again. Just bumping the post because everywhere I go to ask they tell me they just don't know. "
1957,Made a mistake while filling the employment details in IMM 5710E for my PGWP,Just noticed that i made a mistake while filling the employment details in IMM 5710E for my PGWP. The field where it asks for current employment details i have filled in my previous employment details which i worked from 2016 to 2018. But i was currently working part time during my studies here in Canada.  What exactly should be filled in current employment occupation field?  Will this be an issue as issue? Is there anything that i can do to correct this mistake as i have already submitted it? 
1958,Request for advice - Validation of settlement permit during absence from Germany,"I have a Niederlassungserlaubnis. I am planning to move to my home country for self employment and pursue an external part-time PhD from a German university (will visit Germany once a year for progress review and discussion). In case my self employment attempt fails, I would like to come back to Germany to finish my PhD as a full-time researcher at the university and then find a job.  Do you think the Ausländerbehörde will agree to keep my Niederlassungserlaubnis valid in my case? Will it help my case if I have a Dauraufenthalt EU since it allows 24 months of absence for prior Blue card holders? "
1959,Travel insurance (and flight tickets) for Long Term Schengen Visa,"I am going to apply for a Long Term Schengen visa soon for a job I am going to start in Luxembourg. And I am unable to determine whether I need to get travel insurance or not. The VFS website says I do need Schengen travel insurance for a minimum duration of 3 months, but, on the other hand, travel insurance companies have a clause about not settling claims before the traveller's return to India. This doesn't make any sense since I am applying for a long term visa.   I also have a similar doubt regarding flight tickets. I already have my 'Authorization to stay' issued by the Luxembourgish immigration department. So, is it necessary to present dummy/actual flight tickets?  Can anyone share their experience of applying for a Long term Schengen Visa? And tell me about what documents are actually necessary to get the Visa? "
1960,Fingerprints not Taken for Spanish Long Term Visa,I applied for Spanish long term visa for study purpose. In the application day the officer took my papers then they took a picture of me (using their installed camera). There was a fingerprint machine beside the camera but I wasn't asked to give my fingerprints.  After the visa processing period had passed I went to the embassy and received my passport with the visa (type D) stamped on it. The officer gave me the passport and went inside so I assumed that this was all (they didn't say any single word).  Now I'm not sure if it's OK that my fingerprints was not taken. Does anyone has experience with this type of Visa ? Should I contact them to ask about this ?

1962,How to plan travel from and re-entry to Canada while applying for a PR card,"I have a CoPR expiring in Feb 2020 and I can travel to Canada for a couple of days only to apply for a PR card before CoPR expires.   Do the immigration officers bother about my return date (as to knowing that PR processing can take up to 6 weeks, why am I leaving so soon without a PR card)? The address I would give for PR card delivery will obviously a friend's, do officers bother? I have heard its not allowed for me to have my PR card couriered from that friend to me in India, is it because PR travel document is the official way to go? I read in some blogs that they can seize the PR card at borders even? If PR travel document is the way to go, can I use that to go back to Canada and then collect my PR card from my friend, I mean will the PR card still be valid even if I used a PR travel document the second time?   I saw a similar question: [website]"
1963,How can I switch from a Tier 4 Visa to EU Pre-Settled Status in the UK?,"I am currently resident in the UK on a Tier 4 Student Visa in a non-EU passport. I was recently granted simplified naturalisation in an EU country on the basis of my ancestry. Thus, I now hold dual nationality between an EU and non-EU country.  I would like to remain in the UK, and thus wish to switch from my current Tier 4 status (in my non-EU passport) to EU pre-settlement status (as an EU citizen).  I have failed to locate any relevant information on what needs to be done in order to accomplish this.  Do I need to inform the Home Office that I have acquired foreign EU citizenship and thus wish to cancel my current leave to remain via a Change of Circumstance Form? Or can I just go ahead and apply for Pre-Settled Status, and ask to cancel my student visa after this is granted (or will they automatically cancel it)?   Do I need to exit the UK and re-enter on my EU passport before doing this? "
1964,How long can I stay in Germany after quitting my Blue Card job?,"I am from a non-EU country and hold a German ""Blue Card EU"" which is tied to a job I had in Germany. I worked there for 1 year but stopped working there last week.  I am now in the process of applying for a Swiss working permit and I intend to move there and begin working there when that is finished. I was told that it could take more than 3 months though to get the working permit, which is kind of worrying because I am only allowed 90 visa-free days in the Schengen zone.  Therefore my question is: how long can I stay in Germany now that I have quit the job for which I had my Blue Card? Citizens of my country get 90 visa free days, so there's that, but do I get any ""extra"" time thanks to my blue card? It surely musn't expire as soon as I quit my job, right? "
1965,Investing in the US stock Market while on F-1 OPT,"I have started work (on OPT) recently. I was wondering if I am legally allowed to invest in the US stock market, because I have heard that most of my income must be from my primary field of education (computer science, in my case).  So am I allowed to invest and what counts as ""most of my income""? Is there a percentage or something like that? "
1966,Can one enter UK with a family member using a Spanish permanent residence card,"I have a friend of 21 years old and his father is a Spanish national but he holds Spanish ""larga duracion residence card"" which was given to him by his father.

1967,The meaning of 'sponsor' in the EEA FP application,"My brief background: I am a non-EEA national married to a Spanish EEA national. We have been married for 4 years, and I have been a legal Spanish resident since 2010.  Our plan is pretty straightforward: to apply for EEA FP to grant an entry for me, travel together to the UK, for my husband to exercise his Treaty rights and to settle down there.   As I'm filling out the EEA FP online form, I have a couple of doubts, and I'd appreciate any advice on a couple of questions I've got in the process:   I am currently unemployed but I am not financially dependent on my husband. Even so, in order to get the best chance of getting an EEA FP, what is the best answer when asked 'What is your current working status?'? Is there any substantial difference in answering with 'Unemployed' over'Supported by Spouse/Partner', and vice versa? What exactly is meant by 'sponsor' in 'Are you being sponsored by a person' question? I am uncertain whether, given our situation, I even have a sponsor. Is 'sponsor' used in:   legal context, as in 'my EEA-national husband who is going to exercise Treaty rights in the UK, and consequently transfers me the theoretical right of residence in the UK, as long as he stays there and is considered a qualified person'?  or financial context, as in 'my EEA-national husband, who supports me (and my application) financially?    I mean, if I state that I am unemployed, and answer that both my husband and I are going to cover the costs of our trip to the UK, should I still mention my husband as my sponsor?  Could anyone help out, please? "
1968,What is a “Nachweis über die getrennte Namensführung”?,"My French wife and my Dutch self got married when we were both living in Sweden.  We have each kept our birth name after marriage.  We are moving from England to Germany and along with my marriage certificate (Heiratsurkunde) and a dozen other documents, my next employer is asking for a Nachweis über die getrennte Namensführung, which I understand to mean proof of separated name use.  From Wikipedia, I understand that Zuerst übergangsweise und mit der Neuregelung des gesamten Namensrechts 1993 endgültig behält bei Nichterklärung eines Ehenamens jeder Ehegatte den zum Zeitpunkt der Eheschließung geführten Namen (getrennte Namensführung) solange, bis die Ehegatten zu einem beliebigen Zeitpunkt gegenüber dem Standesbeamten durch öffentlich zu beglaubigende Erklärung einen Ehenamen bestimmen.  What exactly is a Nachweis über die getrennte Namensführung?  Is it enough to send a copy of her ID (they're asking for mine anyway), or is this a more formal document that we may only be able to get after we will have moved and registered with the Meldebehörde?  We could also get a Swedish Familjebevis translated (our marriage is not currently registered with Dutch, English, or French authorities). "
1969,I need to apply for a national D visa in Italy but have no country of residence,"I am a Brazilian citizen, however I have just completed my undergraduate degree in the UK (my visa is expiring in one week) and my parents live in Germany. I have been accepted into a masters programme in Italy starting in February and need to apply for a student visa.   My problem is that I have no proof of residency in Brazil, as I do not live there nor do I have family that I can stay with. There is no way for me to go back to Brazil at the moment.  Can I apply for an Italian student visa while staying with my parents as a tourist in Germany?  Alternatively, could I enter Italy as a tourist and then apply for a student visa from there? "
1970,"UK Citizen, wife and son are Canadian- can they be in the country while waiting for a visa?","I am a UK citizen and my wife and son are Canadian citizens. I was living in Canada for the past five years and have recently moved back for work and obviously, I would want my wife and son to join me in the UK ASAP. I am two months away from achieving the six-month requirement to be able to sponsor them to live in the UK and they have been staying with me for the past few months on visitor visas.  As I understand, they will need to leave the UK in order to apply for a spousal visa (let me know if this isn't the case). My question is whether they can leave, apply, and return to the UK on a visitor visa while we wait for a decision on our spousal application. Ideally, they could leave for a weekend, apply and come back- I really don't want to live apart for them again for another three months. Do they need to return to Canada or could we take a holiday to Europe and apply? That would be much cheaper.  I also understand that as I am a British Citizen 'not of descent', ie that I was born here, my parents were born here etc. my son may already have British citizenship- is this the case and if so how can we have that legally recognized? Can he be issued a UK passport or dual citizenship?  Thanks in advance for your help. "

And How many years should I stay in Italy to apply for permanent residency if I am on work permit ( for study visa it’s 5 yrs) as we do plan to settle in Italy? "
1972,"How can I get a Steuer-Identifikationsnummer (tax ID no.) a month before my date of employment, without physically moving a month before?","I am a Dutch citizen moving from the United Kingdom to Germany.  I have received a conditional employment offer.  My next employer has asked me to submit my Lohnsteuerklasse und Steuer-Identifikationsnummer (salary tax classification and tax identification number) at least one month prior to my start of employment.  I understand that I can obtain those from Finanzamt (finance office), but apparently only after I have registered with the Meldebehörde (registration authority), for which I apparently need a Wohnungsgeberbestätigung.  Is there any way I can get obtain the Lohnsteuerklasse und Steuer-Identifikationsnummer (at least) a month before my start of employment, without physically moving a month before I am due to start (which might mean being unemployed for a month)?  I suppose I would need to rent a place to get a Wohnungsgeberbestätigung, but signing a lease in order to register more than a month before I move without actually moving would be costly (double rent), and I fear it may be considered fraudulent, too.  Similarly fraudulent may be to temporarily register at my wifes Zweitwohnung (secondary residence) without ever planning to live there (and the landlord may be unwilling to provide a Wohnungsgeberbestätigung for two for an apartment so small it is only fit for one).  Is there another way out of this catch? "
1973,Passport renewal : H-1B visa stamping on soon to expire passport,"I am on H-1B in the USA and I recently got a new job. My passport is set to expire sometime in 2019 but the H-1B (I-797) expires sometime in 2021. I want to go to India and get the new H-1B stamp on my passport.  So my I-797 expiry date is greater than my passport expiration.  Is that a problem?  Will I be able to get a stamp for the new H-1B?  Or should I renew my passport here in the USA and then get the stamp for the new H-1B?  Also, can I renew my passport after my employer has started my green card application? "
1974,Can I start the Krankenkasse application process before moving to Germany?,"Can I start the process of registering with a Krankenkasse (German statutory health insurance fund) before I have a German address?  From krankenkassen.de:     EU-Bürger, die in Deutschland als Arbeitnehmer angestellt werden, sollten sich rechtzeitig vor Arbeitsbeginn um eine Mitgliedschaft in einer Krankenkasse kümmern.   Translated in English:     EU citizens, that are employed in Germany, shall take care of membership of a statutory health insurance fund in time before the start of employment.   My future employer has stated essentially the same.  The form on krankenkassen.de does allow for people moving from abroad (example), where I can fill in that I need to join because I was formerly insured abroad.  But the form appears to require a German address.  I know my future employer and their address, but I don't have a German address yet (and wasn't planning on having one until some days before I start working, and not a long-term address until a while after I start working).  Is not having a (permanent) German address (=registration with Meldebehörde) an obstacle for the registration with a Krankenkasse? "

I came to Poland on March 17 (with a work permit), and got my Blue Card on August 17; it is valid until  August 2020.  I got an offer from an Amsterdam IT company, but they are not interested in helping me out with documents.  Do I need to have a work permit The Netherlands?  As I would be terminating the job in Poland, do I need to hand in my existing Blue Card?  Is it better to wait for 2 years before thinking of changing jobs, in or outside of Poland? "
1976,How long can I stay in France after my titre de séjour and récépissé have ended,"My titre de séjour ended 1st October, one month after my original work contract ended.  However, my contract was extended until the end of December, so I went to the prefecture (in September) to apply for a new titre de séjour.   Weirdly, they asked for more information, either a new contract past the 31st December or and attestation of the end of the contract and ability to receive employment benefits from the Pôle Emploi…   They gave me a récépissé valid until the 1st January. However, more contract finishes 31st December so they is no way I can be out of France by this time.  Questions   How long can I remain in France after my after my titre de séjour and récépissé have ended? If I can't remain at all, can I extend the récépissé?  Did they make a mistake in not granting me another titre de séjour?  "
1977,How is a German real estate living area defined?,"For the area of a (rental) home, I would assume that 35 m² means 35 m² of indoor area, excluding only the garden (if applicable).  That means, if we rent a German apartment that is 35 m², it will be the same size as where we live now in England.  However, from this (previous revision, now edited) answer by Martin Bonner, it appears it may not be that simple:     It is quite common in Germany for not all space within an apartment to count - toilets/bathrooms may not count at all, kitchens/balconies count half, and living rooms/bedrooms are fully counted. (...) if you got the 100sqm from the property details (rather than your husband getting out a tape measure), they will already have done that pro-rating.   Is this a general rule?  For example, does that mean that if an apartment somewhere in southern Hessen is advertised as 35 m² on Immobilienscout or another real estate website, it is actually even larger than 35 m²? "
1978,Can I visit France from Germany if I have a 6 months National Visa valid for Deutschland?,"I've got an employment visa for 6 months to Germany. I'd like to visit Paris, France(Family) during the holidays. Will I be allowed to? My visa states that it is valid for Deutschland. Do I need an additional visa to enter France? I'm an Indian National. Thanks for any help "
1979,Immigrant Visa Interview,"If you answered no to the DS 160 question ""Do you have any relative in the US?"" and later in life, a relative in the US files an immigrant petition on your behalf, will the consular officer easily notice the discrepancy during an immigrant visa interview?  "
1980,Traveled to Oman from Malaysia. Passport or visa was not stamped,"I'm asking for a friend. She travelled to Oman from Malaysia on a work visa. Upon arrival, they directed her to a different line where she just literally walked past immigration, thinking that it was just the practice, only to realize that the rest of her colleagues, who were already there, had had their passport and visas stamped.  Will there be an issue flying back to her home country? Or are there any precautionary steps that should be taken in this case? "
1981,How long does it take for a Ukraine work permit visa to be issued?,"I applied for a work permit visa for Ukraine on the 7th of September and on the 8th of October, I attended the interview. After the interview, the consular official said it would make its decision and let me know through VFS. I heard the same said to other visa applicants when I was at the centre.   For Ukraine, you have submit the documents at the VFS visa center India. How long does it usually take to process a work visa? Is the delay any sign of a negative decision? "
1982,Is there any possibility to obtain German Citizenship before 6 years without marriage?,"I read many times that the minimum requirement for period lived in Germany is 8 years and can be dropped to 6 years (I am talking about non-married to German citizen). My question is, can this be by any mean less than 6 years even by 2 or 3 months? And when can I start the process of application? "
1983,How likely it is to get a job in programming in Germany for a non-EU without a degree?,"I know the question might be a bit too specific, but I'm interested in knowing these details preferably from people who might already have had a successful experience.  Basically: I don't have any college degree, I only have skills. I already understand the process for application (such as the fact that I need a signed job offer) and I know that it IS technically possible to get it because there's no law saying you can't get a work visa without a degree. However, it's also technically possible for Merkel herself to issue an honorary German citizenship for me, but we all know that's unlikely.  I'd like to add that I speak German and have the official certificates from the Goethe center, would that help in gaining a visa?  Furthermore I'd like to add that I'm talking about a normal work visa, I know that the blue card requires a degree.  So, assuming that I pass an interview and get an offer, how likely would it be for the government to actually accept me? Any success stories would be appreciated. "
1984,"US Born, UK Citizen Mother, do I qualify for UK Passport?","I was born in the US before 1983 and my mother was born and raised in the UK. I've never lived in the UK. Do I qualify for a UK passport\citizenship?  Even if I do, would I be able to live anywhere in the EU, since the UK is part of the EU? What about Brexit? Thank you all. "
1985,Withdrawing money to buy a car in Japan,"I'm an American living in Japan, and I'm looking to buy a car in Japan in the next couple months. I have a Chase bank account with a debit card and a Sapphire credit card.   Unfortunately, I don't think I'll be able to find a place that allows credit cards for buying a car, or that would be the best option.  I've also been informed by the dealer that they don't have any connection with Chase bank, so sending money directly from the bank won't work either.  So it seems that I'm left with withdrawing cash. Which I wouldn't have an issue with, but my Chase card has a 3% foreign exchange rate adjustment fee + a [tex]500 per day. So I'd be hit with the fees several times.  Do I have any other options for withdrawing money? Is there some kind of prepaid card I can charge with my debit card / credit card and withdraw money without limitations or fees? (I searched for one with no luck)  My wife has a Japanese bank account, so any way to transfer money to her account from my American account without fees would also be awesome. "
1986,[US]Twitch Streaming during OPT,"I have a F-1 Student Visa and will be granted optional practical training (OPT) soon. My full time will be at Amazon (Washington, US) which is a parent company of Twitch. I know that it not legal to earn revenue from a different source other than the company associated with your OPT.  Twitch is a streaming platform where you can earn money and/or donations from people who watch you playing online games.  Query 1: Is it legal to earn on Twitch if I am full time at Amazon on my OPT?  Query 2: Are Twitch donations legal irrespective of where I work on my OPT?  Query 3: Is it legal to earn on Twitch (as a streamer) if I work at Twitch (as a Software Developer) on my OPT? "
1987,Is there a possibility to bring a widowed old parent to Germany if “hardship” is proven?,"My mother is in Sri Lanka, and is widowed and old. She is financially and emotionally dependent on me. I am working in Germany on a 3 year blue card. If I prove my mother's hardship, is there a way to bring her and make her stay until mine? I consulted a German immigration lawyer and he denied immediately saying its not possible and that I'll only waste the money. But in the law I have read that if ""hardship"" is experienced, adult dependents could be brought over. I can sponsor mom for all her needs including insurance and any other cost. Is there any one who has done this or who could provide me an advice as to whether there are any chances of succeeding at all? Last few days have been hopeless, so any help would be much appreciated. "
1988,Which countries in EU guarantee paid lunch break?,In Poland full time employees have a 15 minutes lunch break that counts as paid work time. Employee can start work at 8 am at leave at 4 pm. In Germany employees have to take a 30 minutes lunch break that doesn't count as work time. If employees start at 8 am they have to stay at least until 4:30 pm.  Which countries in EU guarantee employees paid lunch break (like Poland)? What's the duration of those breaks? 
1989,Do I normally need a Haftpflichtversicherung (liability insurance) to rent in Germany?,"For either long-term renting or Wohnen auf Zeit (shorter term, furnished rentals) in Germany, is a Haftpflichtversicherung (liability insurance) normally required?  For example, I looked through the Youniq furnished apartments for a Zweitwohnung (secondary residence), which are mostly but not only rented out to students, and they require not only what I would expect (Arbeitsvertrag (work contract), Einkommensbescheide der letzten drei Monate (evidence of income last three months), Ausweiskopie (copy of ID)), but also a Bestätigung über Haftpflichtversicherung (confirmation of liability insurance).  Although not a problem per se to obtain, it does add yet another layer of complication of newly settling in Germany, which may be hard enough as it is.  Is this a usual requirement, or is this something particular? "
1990,"How to send/receive a used phone from USA to Europe, what about duties and tax?","A friend from the United States wants to give me a used phone, free of charge. The only cost that I should be concerned with are the duties/VAT, I think (Poland).   How should we send/declare the package and its value (it would go through the USPS) to pay the least amount? The phone new was [tex]400 US.   Should the declared value be that [tex]800 value? And also, should this phone be sent in its original box? "
1991,I've left the EU. Should I keep my bank account and credit card?,"I was expatriated in the Netherlands for a little under three years, and am now back in my home country (Palestine/Israel). I don't expect to live in the EU again in the near future.  I still have an active Dutch bank account (ABN AMRO) and a credit card associated with it (ICS).  Should I cancel my credit card? Should I close my bank account? (Or rather, what are the pros and cons of doing so?)  Also, if I do close them, how soon should I do so after I've left? "
1992,China Z visa: what happens if I quit the job during probation period?,"I have changed my plans and I don't want to work in China. It is my probation period and I want to quit in 3 days. I did not get a residence permit and I came here on the 10th of October with a Z visa.   Can I leave the country if the duration of stay on this visa says 000 days, which means I am required to get the residence permit within 30 days after entry? What if I fail to get the residence permit and want to leave China within 30 days? Is it possible to leave the country? "
1993,US visa process for medical graduate,"The case is as follows:   Physician with EU citizenship.  Cardiology training completed in the EU, never worked in the US. Interest in pursuing a medical fellowship in the US with several options to choose from. ECFMG exams completed, certificate to be delivered soon. USMLE Step 3 not taken yet.   Questions:   Can the candidate already start the visa application process even though USMLE Step 3 is not done yet? Apparently, this last step seems required in some States. If some fellowship positions are not ACGME accredited, what options does the candidate have at the end of their training should they wish to stay in the US?   If this SE is not the right place to ask, thanks for advising a more suitable community; cheers. "
1994,Will F3 family-based petition affect the B2 visa application of my wife and infant child?,"Here is my situation:   My father (US Citizen) has filed a family-based petition for me 2 years back after I was newly married. I now fall under Family Third Preference (F3): Married sons and daughters of U.S. citizens, and their spouses and minor children. Now that I have an infant first-born (1 year old as of this writing), I would like to apply for B2 visa for him and my wife so that we could visit my parents on the coming holidays. We intend to stay for only 1 week (December 25 up to New Year). I have existing valid US B1/B2 Visa and have travelled to the US multiple times and have proven that I always returned home and never overstayed. My wife has solid work track record of more than 5 straight years (3 years in her first company and more than 2 years in her current company).    Does the petition raised by my father for me have any effect on the B2 Visa application if my wife and baby? I want to of course avoid refusal and am seeking advise what is the best course of action and answer to the consular officer if the question arises on my wife’s interview?  We want to prove that we only want to visit my parents for the holidays and we will never unlawfully overstay. "
1995,"Is “Wohnen auf Zeit” easier to organise from abroad than normal rental, or do landlords still insist on Schufa, work contract, and meeting the tenant?","Challenges renting a regular home from abroad  There are some practical challenging facing new immigrants seeking accommodation in Germany.  Some of those apply generally, some are more strongly or exclusively the case in Germany:   The need for SCHUFA, which normally required a German bank account, which requires a German registration, which requires already living there. The need to view a place in person.  Not only to know what the tenant is renting, but the landlord or their representative will also insist on meeting the tenant in person. Payslips for the last three months, which an immigrant moving to Germany to take on a job may not yet have. A work contract, which some immigrants may not yet have. Probably some others I'm not thinking of at the moment.   Challenges with staying in hotels initially  Hotels, hostels, airbnb may be a way out in the beginning, but those have some major disadvantages:   Apparently they are not obliged to fill a Wohnungsgeberbestätigung, which means one cannot register with the Meldebehörde, which will make it complicated/impossible to get a bank account or Steueridentifikationsnummer, which employers (and perhaps others) will need Contrary to what I thought, it seems hostels/hotels do have to provide a Wohnungsgeberbestätigung for guests staying ≥3 months and requesting one. Cannot usually mark ones name on the mailbox, which means one cannot receive mail or only in a limited way (I believe) Hotels or hostels may refuse to have guests staying for longer than 2 weeks up to 3 months, because then they would have to deal with the consequences of people registering as resident there (but this may depend on the location) (Example case of someone describing this situation). May be a very expensive solution to do for ≥3 months (and for a shorter stay I might not get a Wohnungsgeberbestätigung).   Does Wohnen auf Zeit solve both problems?  In Germany there is a thing called Wohnen auf Zeit.  Apparently, this is typically furnished accommodation which is often rented out for a period of 1–12 months.  Some of it is private, some by companies such as Homecompany, city-residence, or Youniq.  Does Wohnen auf Zeit generally share the practical challenges that immigrants face renting regular accommodation, or is this easier to organise in advance?  Would they still insist on having a SCHUFA, meeting the tenant, and seeing payslips?  From a tenants point of view, there is less risk renting a place sight unseen if a legitimate (corporate) landlord or agent has good reviews/testimonials and the tenant only intend to stay for 3–6 months (as long as the tenant needs to find a regular rental home).  There is less risk for the landlord if the tenant provides evidence they can pay the full 3–6 months, and the landlord can get easily get rid of the tenant after this relatively short period.  If I understand correctly, the landlord for Wohnen auf Zeit is required to provide a Wohnungsgeberbestätigung when asked when asked; after all registration is mandatory for international moves if the tenant stays more than 3 months and for domestic moves if the tenant stays more than 6, and a Wohnungsgeberbestätigung is needed to register.  It appears like the perfect way out (of course at a price).  Is it, or are there some caveats I am missing? "
1996,What other documents other than Passport are considered an ID when applying for renewing the residency in Germany?,"Is Passport the only acceptable form of ID that I can use to renew my residency in Germany, or there other alternatives that can be presented as an ID?

1997,Changing nationality,"I am a British national (yeah, I don't like admitting to it so please forgive me).  My dream is to win Euromillions so that I can buy a plot of land in Cyprus, build a nice villa with pool and move out there.  What would I need to do to be able to live out there as a Cypriot national?  From what I've read on the interweb, the UK Government is extremely reluctant to allow one of its net contributors (i.e taxpayers) to jump ship and make you leap through hoops to even get anywhere close to leaving.  Any advice? "
1998,Rejoining University after 7 months - under F1,"I am from India. I went to US a University in Spring 2014 for MS program under F1 Visa. But due to serious health issues, I had to leave US even before the start of the program in US.  Now, I have settled stuff. I am prepared to go and complete my course in this Fall. I will receive my I-20 in a week or so.   So, will I need to go through the same process of F1 Visa again? I know that under F1 status, I cannot be outside US for more than 5 months. So what will happen in my case? "
1999,Consequences of declaring 'Konfessionslos' when formally belonging to Church in Germany,"For many people migrating for work to Germany it's quite surprising, or even shocking, that they are asked about their religion by the employer. They are usually not informed about the consequences, and most people answer according to the formal (and not subjective) fact that they are baptised, even if they are atheists or agnostics.  However, being aware about the church tax in Germany, many people prefer to state they are confession-free (Konfessionslos), because they feel they are not the members of the Church (no religious activities).   On the example of Poland, formally, anyone baptised in Catholic Church is the member of the Catholic Church, and formally leaving the Church is practically impossible (according to people who have tried). So, formally any worker from Poland, that was baptised and arrives to Germany, is Catholic.   What are, then, the consequences of declaring yourself atheist based on your conscience, not on the formal state? You will not be registered for Church Tax, but if the tax office would want to check the religious membership, they would get the answer that the given person ""belongs"" to the Catholic Church. Will any actions be taken against such person, or the actual state would count as more important than the formal one? "
2000,H1 visa: Timing for visa interview when on leave of absence,"I am an Indian citizen and I hold a PhD from a US university. I am currently working in France on a Scientific/D visa. I have accepted a position in the USA at a university as a ""teaching assistant professor"". The US job was to start in August 2014 but I have been granted a leave of absence (l.o.a) until August 2015. This l.o.a was granted to me by the US university because they prefer I work in France for a year (until 2015) to improve my professional skills. However, they wanted me to sign a contract to start this year so that they may grant an l.o.a for one year (to avoid future lack of funding issues).  I will need a H1 visa for the job in the USA. Can I have the US university petition for an H1 right now so that I may attend the visa interview at a US consulate in France or should I have them petition for it for next year (2015)?  As I understand, since the offer letter I signed shows a starting date of Aug 2014, I am in the clear to have an H1 visa interview this year despite not joining the job until Aug 2015.  Am I wrong about something? This information will prove useful when I have a teleconference with my employers in the USA and also help my current employers figure out if I will be applying for a US visa this year or next and from where (France or India).

2001,Opinions about Dutch school for kids near Delft,"I am considering moving to Delft (or close by) for less than a year - I will have a position at TU Delft during that time. I have two children, a 12 year old (going into 7th grade) and a 4 year old. The international school in Delft does not offer a middle years program for the 12 year old, and it is quite pricey. Does anyone have an opinion of the local dutch schools like Grotius College for English speaking students? Will it be okay to send my children to public Dutch school for a while? What about the international school in the Hague?  "
2002,Unemployment and health insurance in Germany,"I am a German citizen who has been living abroad since I was ten years old. I am planning on moving back to Germany in a few month with my family. I have a daughter and non EU citizen husband.  I am very confused about unemployment and health insurance. I have a BA from a non EU country. I heard I can not apply for unemployment until I have work for at least two year, because I am a university graduate. I do not think I till be able to find work immediately and I will be with my daughter house hunting so we can bring my husband  over. I really need health insurance especially for my daughter. We can not afford private. What can I do? Do I have to be a student or employed? I won't even be registered until I did a house, which should be about a month. What advice do you have for me?  "

2004,What's the maximum time to leave once student status expires,"If a non-citizen of the US has been able to live in the country for some time under a student visa, and their educational program ends, how long do they have to leave the country (e.g. before forced deportation hearings get started)? The USCIS must have a basic fixed policy.  Also, if the case is different but the only difference is a work visa instead, how long after work visa is no longer good must person leave? "
2005,What happens if I fail the G2 road test with 2+ years of foreign experience?,"With 2+ years of foreign driving experience, new residents of Ontario with licenses ineligible for direct exchange (such as a license from The Netherlands), can skip the graduated licensing system and take the G2 road test directly.  For example, see exchange foreign drivers license.  I recall reading or hearing that if one under these circumstances fails the G2 road test, then the credited foreign driving experience is annulled and one has to go through the full graduated system, thus forcing one to wait at least 20 months to take the G2 road test again.  However, I'm unable to verify this information now.  What happens if one fails the G2 road test (G2 exit test) with credited foreign driving experience?  Can one take the test again soon after, or must one indeed go through the full graduated system? "
2006,What to do if an NHS centre doesn't believe you are entitled to free use and charges you for treatment,"Based on the NHS site, you are entitled to free healthcare if you are an ordinary resident in the UK. But it can happen that you are still denied free healthcare (if they believe you are not an ordinary resident), in which case you have to pay upfront before they start your treatement, and you have to try to claim your money back.  Unfortunately the steps to do this are not really documented on the NHS websites. Searching on google for topics related to NHS refunds only result in issues regarding dental and optical care, as they are not (usually) free for patients.   Does anyone know what steps are needed to be taken to sort this thing out? "

2011,Do EU citizens get Kindergeld (child benefit) if they live in Germany with their children?,"Do citizens of the EU have the right to get Kindergeld (child benefit) for their children, if they (all the family) live in Germany?

2013,How can a minor foreign-born child of a US citizen parent and non-US citizen parent get US citizenship if the US citizen parent refuses?,"Zork, 12, was born in a foreign country to a US citizen parent and a non-US citizen parent. At the time of Zork's birth, the US citizen parent had (and currently has) all the requirements to pass US citizenship to Zork. The US citizen parent had strong anti-US political views, so they did not want US citizenship to 'oppress the child'. They never registered Zork's birth with the embassy. The US citizen parent left the foreign country and is assumed to be in the US.  If the US citizen parent ignores all communication, what steps should be taken by Zork to confirm his status as a US citizen?  Additional info:   The US citizen parent lived 10+ years in the US after turning 18. The US citizen parent and the non-US citizen parent had a marriage ceremony in accordance with local customs, but did not get government official papers: obtaining them requires a substantial application fee/bribe. The US citizen parent lived 8 years in the family household. For this particular foreign country, a police officer's salary is $90/month (just an example) thus the idea of paying retainer fees for a US-based attorney or hiring US private investigators is not viable.   The main issues are:   The US citizen parent ignores all forms of contact and is no longer located in the foreign country and won't return to visit the embassy. All posted rules assume that the parent is willing to enter an embassy and submit to a blood test (if required). However if the parent refuses to answer emails, phone calls, and is basically not interested in assisting this process in any way, nor willing to return to the foreign country, etc, since the child is automatically granted US citizenship at birth, is there a way to compel the US citizen parent or (I am out of ideas)..? Is this situation winnable by the child without some ""guardian angel"" / 'Deus ex machina' type of intervention?  "
2014,"Do you need to pay US taxes if you are a US citizen by birth, who was never in the USA?","It is known, that the USA not only taxes their residents, but their citizens as well. But what happens if someone is a US citizen at birth, who never lived in the USA? Do they also need to pay taxes? I think if they never want to have anything to do with the USA, then it won't really be a problem from them, but there might be cases when you want to use your US citizenship, and have to deal with the USA.   For example consider the following scenarios:   Never lived in the USA, and doesn't intend to, but might visit the USA for travel (and intends to use the US citizenship to enter the country) Never lived in the USA, has already worked in another country, but intends to move to the USA. Never lived in the USA, but wants a US passport, to make it easier to get visas for other countries. Doesn't really intend to go to the USA.   What happens in these cases? Do you have to retroactively pay the taxes on your income? Or do you only need to start doing it once you ""formalized"" your US citizenship (be getting your passport / entering the country, etc.)  Edit: Since it seems you need to do your US taxes as well, I'm mainly interested in the answers the various sanctions you might get if you don't do them. This might be quite common, as someone who never lived in the US will probably not know his obligations to a state he never lived in. "
2015,Nomad living - Moving retirement funds between many countries?,"I have a bit of an unusual work lifestyle. I'm constantly moving between countries. I've been living and working so far in Brazil, Germany, Czech Republic, the UK, Canada and now I'm moving to Singapore.  I will most likely not stop there. I'm 37 years old and I'm starting to get worried about what will be with my retirement fund. I paid taxes and national insurances, which would cover for my retirement, in all those countries.  How can I possibly use, retrieve or move those funds around and to where (if I have no clue yet where I will settle down), so I have a guarantee that I'll have some fund when I go into retirement?  I have German and Brazilian citizenship, so I was wondering maybe I could set a retirement plan in one of those countries… Anyone with the same issue?  Could you recommend a specialist?   I don't even know who I could ask. "

2019,What might happen if one continues driving with a foreign license beyond the grace period?,"Most (all?) legislations require that people moving in from other legislations need to exchange their driving license if they wish to continue driving.  Ontario is no exception.  Suppose somebody is told they need more practice, because they moved to a big city where traffic is more difficult to navigate than where they got their license and where they're used to driving.  Suppose this person decides to drive with a license that would be perfectly valid elsewhere, just not exchanged.  If the police pull over, how likely are they to find out?  And if they do find out, is it ""driving without a license"" (apparently a 325$ fine and a ""3 year conviction""), or is the consequence different?  This is all, of course, entirely hypothetical...?

2021,"What does ""to the exclusion of all others"" entail for partner migration to Australia?","My partners and I are polyamorous: we all have multiple serious dating relationships, with the knowledge and approval of all parties. One of my partners is an Australian citizen living in the state of Victoria. All of her partners are foreigners living overseas. Currently, no one is married to anyone or in any relationship that would be recognised as de facto under Victorian law.  My partner's fiance wants to move to Australia and marry my partner. He's planning to apply for a prospective marriage visa, followed by a partner visa once they are married.  The partner migration booklet lists ""a mutual commitment to a shared life as husband and wife to the exclusion of all others"" as a visa requirement for married couples. (For de facto couples it's ""a mutual commitment to a shared life to the exclusion of all others"".)  What is needed to meet this requirement?  Of course they can't marry any other people, but that's already in marriage law. Do my partner and I have to break up, or would lesser restrictions (e.g. remaining long-distance, not sharing money, not going out as a couple) be enough?  Conversely, if we break up, we would like to stay friends, which implies calling each other often and visiting each other. It seems difficult to prove that the calls and visits are purely friendly and we are not simply hiding a continuing relationship. Would these actions make it impossible for my partner and her fiance to prove that they are now exclusive?  Is there any way to find a migration agent with experience on this problem? "

2024,Living in Germany and getting a driving license from Italy or USA,"I am originally from Egypt. I know how to drive and I have an Egyptian driving license. But unfortunately it is not valid in Germany, where I live at the moment.   Getting a driving license in Germany is really expensive. I would have to pay almost 1000 EUR in the process, even if I bypass some steps by translating my Egyptian driving license. Also the practical test is difficult and many pass in their second or even third time.   I heard that getting a driving license from the US is fairly easy and costs only 20 USD, I am visiting the for two weeks in about 6 months. Also the city where I live in Germany is about 2 hours away from Italy. I could do the test there, which is also easier and cheaper. And both are valid in Germany.

2026,Australian visa subclass 189,"I plan to apply for Australia subclass 189 visa for myself and my partner and am looking to confirm some of the details.    For the Skilled Occupations Lists: I know that my skill should be on the nominated skills list for us to get 5 points. Should our skills be the same skills or do the partner's skills matter?  The Skilled Occupations List is very specific, and the university information is general. How can I know which skills on the list are matched with my degree? For example, if the degree is in economics, which skills does it match?  If someone gets 60 points, what percentage is needed to be accepted?   If I'm living in a country that does not charge taxes, what documents should be provided to prove work experience?    "
2027,"Wife found job in Germany, while I am still looking. Should I apply for a permit with her now?","We are both citizens of a non-EU country. Her new employer took care of German employment authority approvals and she will apply for a national visa next week. My current company is looking for a job for me in Germany, but it will take some time. I am also considering a career change so I am applying for some jobs myself as well.   The questions are:   Should I apply with her, basing my application on her work visa?  Would it be a problem if I get the German national visa while continuing to work for my current employer in a non-EU country for at least a couple more months?  "
2028,How do I properly fill out the Georgia birth certificate request form?,Bit of a dumb question. I need to request a couple of copies of a Georgia birth certificate to use as proof of US citizenship but the top of the form is confusing me: [website]What should I put in all of the boxes if I want 2 copies? Something like this?  [ 2 ] full size copies [ 2 ] total number of copies [ 2 ] amount received                                                           $30   Or are some of these supposed to be checkboxes? I figure the Photocopy of valid ID field is just to remind me to include one?

2030,What are the exact conditions under which an EU citizen may be entitled to bring his (elderly) parents into the EU?,"Assuming one is an EU citizen, under which condition are their (non-EU) elderly parents treated as ""EU Family Members""? E.g. the Czech Ministry of the Interior says the following:     descendant or ancestor or else descendant or ancestor of a spouse of an EU citizen, who is due to meeting his basic needs dependent on nutrition or on other necessary care provided by this EU citizen or his spouse, or was dependent on this nutrition or care immediately prior to entering the territory, in a state of which the person concerned is a citizen or in a state in which the person concerned has permitted stay. (Act on the Residence of Foreign Nationals in the Czech Republic no longer sets the condition of dependency in the context of a dependent person).   Does this mean that as long as the EU citizen is paying for the living expenses of his parents, he is entitled to bring them over into the EU? Or do those parents need to have some sort of a lasting disability that requires constant care?  References to EU case law would be particularly appreciated. "
2031,UK EEA Family Permit Refusal for Lack of Communication Evidence,"I'm married to an EEA national, a Romanian. We've been together for 3 years and 8 months (44 months), and have been married a year ago, on the 11th Nov 2015. My wife has visited me twice in my country, Algeria.   I applied to the UK for an EEA Family Permit on 19th Oct 2016, and provided a full file to show that we have a genuine marriage. I was aware that the supporting documents are crucial, and included photographs of my wife pictured with my parents, brothers and cousins.   I keep in touch with my wife daily, but didn't know how to attach that sort of evidence to the visa application (download and print, download FB and Skype coversations onto USB flash?). I went ahead and applied without any proof of our communication. I got a refusal and both my wife and I are devastated.   The refusal says that I have the right to appeal within 28 days, I'm requesting another  appointment and re-applying.  How do I show the proof of our constant communication?          You have stated that you have met in person on 2 occasions. The photographs in support of your application are of your wedding and other occasions where you claim to have met. In the covering letter from your sponsor, she has stated that she met you in person when she visited you in December 2014. She goes onto further state that she visited you again in October 2015 and returned back to the UK in December 2015. Given the fact you have been in a relationship for 43 months and spent the vast majority of your relationship living apart from one another, I would expect to see other means of contact between you to cover these periods. You claim to keep in contact via the internet however you have provided no evidence to support this. It is only reasonable to expect that in a genuine subsisting, supportive and affectionate relationship, which you claim has existed since March 2013, that there would be significant evidence of regular contact, in the form of chat and call records. Given the background to your relationship, lack of evidence of any correspondence between you, I am not satisfied that you have genuinely formed a relationship, that you have been in regular contact, and that your marriage is subsisting.   In view of your failure to provide satisfactory evidence, I am not satisfied that you are the family member of an EEA national in accordance with Regulation 7 of the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006.     "
2032,Wife issued short-term visa for residence in Spain as spouse of EU citizen,"I'm a British citizen and my wife is Filipina. She received a visa so that she can come and join me in Spain and live here with me, as is her right as the spouse of an EU citizen.  She made it clear in her application that she was applying for a visa for residence but the visa she was given is a Type C Schengen Visa. From what I can see this is a short-term visa and she would need a Type D for residence.  I know that it doesn't matter once she's in the country as she can apply for her Resident's Card but I'm worried that they're not going to let her fly or enter at the border with a Type C visa if she doesn't have proof that she's returning to the Philippines after 90 days.  I contacted the embassy when she was first issued the visa and they confirmed it was the correct type. However, she was advised by the Commission on Filipinos Overseas (basically the Filipino government agency for people who are emigrating) that it was a tourist visa and she was unlikely to be able to enter Spain without providing proof of return flights and all that. I contacted the embassy again to triple check and they again confirmed that she had the right visa type, but really I'm not sure I trust what they say as they messed us around a bit with her visa application and didn't follow the law properly.  Is this normal for a visa for family reunification for the spouse of an EU citizen? Is it possible she'll have any problems flying on a Type C visa when she isn't intending to return after 90 days?  Any help or advice with would be much appreciated. "
2033,What documents are needed for an EU permanent resident to work in Sweden?,"Assuming one is a permanent resident of an EU state other than Sweden (e.g. Czech Republic), what documents are needed for them to work in Sweden? The Swedish Migration Agency mentions that:     If you have previously held long-term resident status in another EU country and now fulfil the requirements for long-term resident status in Sweden, you may apply to transfer the status from the other country to Sweden.   This raises the following questions:   Is it possible to start working in Sweden and then apply for a Swedish residence permit? Or do you have to apply for one in advance? What does ""transfer the status"" mean? Are you going to lose your old EU permanent residency card when you receive your Swedish one? What documents are needed to apply for a residency permit for the purpose of work? Is a work contract sufficient? How long does the process of receiving a Swedish residency card take for EU residents?  "
2034,From which age are Israeli citizens returning to Israel exempt from service in the army?,"An Israeli citizen left Israel with their parents before the age of 16. Neither they or their parents returned to Israel since. The Israeli army doesn't consider said person a deserter and the consulate extends their passport without issues.  The following questions then arise:   Can said person return to Israel for a short visit without triggering the need to serve in the army? From which age are they fully exempt from the mandatory service, even if returning for permanent residence?  "
2035,Spouse without marriage in Denmark,"I am an EU citizen working in Denmark and my boyfriend is also an EU citizen, studying (not working) in Denmark. We are not married, but live together.  I recently came across this article and I am wondering whether my partner is eligible for SU.   Is sharing an address considered enough proof that we are a couple? For example, here it is stated that ""‘spouse’ is used as an umbrella term for both spouse and cohabiting partner."" If not, is a marriage certificate the only option or is there another legal document we could obtain?  "
2036,Changing employer while on TN,I am a Canadian citizen working in the U.S. on a TN visa. I am changing my job (employer). Would I need to reenter the U.S. on a new TN visa?

How many years of work experience would be necessary in order to be considered by an american company for a H1B visa?  I read that work experience is not strictly necessary (for instance here) but all job offers offering a visa say 3+ years experience.  Also is it correct that I am not allowed to pay the visa by myself, the company interested in hiring me has to do it applying for the lottery? (Example here)  Thanks "
2038,U.S.V.A. health coverage outside of CONUS?,"I have been getting much of my health care from the U.S. Veteran's Administration (VA).  They tell me that they will pay for services if I am more than forty miles (68 KM) from a VA facility.  (I suspect that only applies within USA.)  I do know they cover emergencies anywhere.  Is anyone non-disabled getting non-emergency healthcare paid for by VA outside of U.S. territory?  What is covered and what is ""on your own""?  Please don't waste bandwidth telling me VA care is sub-standard.  I already know.  I'm just trying to figure out how much insurance to buy before I go to Spain.  UPDATE: To my surprise, someone from the VA not only responded, but responded after midnight!  Unfortunately, all they gave me was a URI for a page about care for service-connected disabilities.  I was able to find in Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) that the V.A. ""may contract with"" other providers.  Don't know whether that means they make a deal with a local provider as needed for a specific veteran or whether they only pay for care by providers they made deals with for general service in some area.

2039,"Importing used car from Italy, how to get export plates","I'm planning to buy a used car in Italy and export it to another EU state, and am wondering how to register the car to take it home.  The regular way (for residents) is to go to a studio di consulenza automobilistica with the previous owner, where both request the trapasso, i.e. registration of ownership change. The studio issues a written statement that the procedure is ongoing, and the new owner can drive off with the new car immediately. After about a week, the new owner returns to the studio, where a sticker with his details is placed in the registration certificate.  Being an EU citizen, I could do the same, even without being a resident of Italy. However, that would require me to pay the IPT (imposta privinciale di trascrizione, a registration tax due for every trapasso) of several hundred euros and get a regular one-year insurance.  Since I have no residence in Italy, I understand I could get EE (export) plates for the car, for which I wouldn't have to pay the IPT.   How is the procedure for that? Will any regular studio di consulenza automobilistica issue these plates for me? Where do I get insurance for an EE-registered car? How long does the procedure take? How much does it cost?  "
2040,Mon projet Québec immigration application IELTS confusion,"I submitted my application successfully within the August 16-22, 2016, intake period. The IELTS information I provided was based on academic, not general training, scores (Speaking 5.5, Listening, Reading and Writing 6). I did this because my IELTS GT was out of date, and I wasn't able to sit another test before the August deadline.   Is this going to be a problem?  Would I be able to take another IELTS and provide updated scores? My other factors (i.e., education, qualifications etc.) are okay. "
2041,"Will a child of a a long-term UK resident EU national, born in the UK, be British?","My wife is Swedish, she's lived in the UK for 10 years and we're pregnant. I assumed her permanent resident status (lived in the UK for more than 5 years) would automatically grant our children British citizenship.  However, I just read the language of the rules:     Children born: on or after 30 April 2006 will be British citizens if at least one parent [who is an EEA national, but not a UK citizen] lived in the UK continuously for five years pursuant to their rights under European law prior to the birth.   My wife is a ""permanent resident"" and kept a bank account and her ""primary address"" is in the UK, and now we're back, but she spent in the neighborhood of 22 months (cumulative) traveling the world with me. We went back to the UK 3 different times, but not for more than about 1-2 months each time (longest continuous absence was 13 months).  I guess my questions are, do those 5 years have to be directly prior to the birth of the child? Or anytime prior? And if it's directly prior, will having kept a permanent address in the UK suffice? She spent a full eight years both studying and working before traveling. Will British citizenship be a given for my child or are we going to have something to prove?  Edit:  I'm not sure I want to jump to conclusions just yet, but I just found this: [website]""Evidence that one parent has exercised treaty rights in the UK for 5 years"" doesn't imply in the 5 years directly prior to the birth of the child.  Does anyone have any conflicting info? "
2042,Possible H1B visa application,"I'm in J-1 status (since 2010), currently doing Academic training. I came to the US in 2010 and got bachelor's and master's degrees in electrical engineering.   I've been working for almost a year in my post-school academic training and my company wants to keep me. We are thinking about applying for H1B visa. My question is regarding traveling.  Is it ok to travel outside the US for Christmas and then apply for H1B visa after returning? I ask because I'd be re-entering the US in J-1 status but I don't know if applying for H1B, say within a month of re-entering the US, could negatively affect my application (if it could be seen as having pre-conceived intent to change status)?   Obviously, it's not pre-conceived intent when you think that I've had this J-1 visa for 6 years and when I initially got it, I proved no intent to have a different status other than J-1 but I am not sure if by leaving for Christmas and coming back forces me to again show intent to keep J-1 status or 'clears' the intent I had when I got the visa for the first time 6 years earlier.  Thanks for the help "

2044,Unmarried USAF posted in UK wanting to stay,"Some background:  My boyfriend works for the US Airforce and is posted at RAF Mildenhall. I am a British Citizen. His contract expires on 23rd November 2018 and he wants to stay in the UK. I am in the process of buying a house with only my name on the mortgage, where he will be informally renting from me.  It looks like our best option is for me to sponsor him for a ""partner of a settled person"" Visa (as I earn over £18,500 but he does not) until he can apply for British citizenship.   My concern:  A ""partner of a settled person"" Visa requires proof that you have been in a relationship for 2 years. We have been dating since November 2015 but he has been living in his dorm and I with my parents. However proof that you have been in a relationship constitutes of a joint bank account or post going to the same address, neither of which will likely be done until January when we move into the house.  Does any one have experience here? Are there are better options? How stringently is the 2 years defined, does a month or two make a difference? "

My girlfriend (and soon to be wife) is a British citizen. However, being an EU national, I never entered the UK using my passports, but only my identity card, i.e. I don't have any passport stamps.

2046,"I may move to the US, but I'm kind of scared of the gun violence","I may be moving to the US in several months (for work). I'm very worried about gun violence in the US, where:   In 2016, there were more mass shootings than days of the year. In 2016, over 15,000 people were shot to death (over 33,000 people were killed by guns overall including suicides, accidents etc.). And that's not counting the wounded. In 2011, over 450,000 people were victims of a crime committed with a firearm. Statistics show that the US is in a ""world of its own"" relative to other developed states in the world: I live in the Netherlands right now, and it has 13x less gun deaths per million people (2.1 vs 31.2). Even law enforcement in the US is heavily armed and extremely prone to violence, shootings particularly, having killed 1095 people in 2015.   Specifically, I may be moving to Texas, which is a ""concealed carry"" state, in which people can even hide their guns, and though this requires a license, the government is required to issue that license and there isn't much/any restriction regarding who gets it.  My questions are:   Generally speaking, what should I do / be aware of so as to reduce the chances of being involved in gun violence (other than living as a hermit)? What can I do to avoid being worried about the gun issue? I mean, the fear of the police, fear of people who seem unfriendly/intimidating and brandish guns, and suspecting people might be concealing and gun and might pull it out if you cross them.  "

Sometime in the future, we may plan to leave the UK, and a general plan might be to resign from our jobs, and spend a week or two not working, but packing up our things, saying goodbye, etc. before definitively leaving.

2050,Council taxes now that I'm moving because I'm changing job,"Not sure whom should I ask for this information. I recently got a new permanent job, and I'm moving because I need to stay closer to where I work. Among the stuff that needs to be done there's setting the council taxes apparently. I'm moving into a totally different town and I was used to have ""all bill included"" and all sort of expenses in my previous renting contract.  Now the question is should my employer in general deducts the council taxes from my salary? Or should I pay it in a different way?  I actually assume my former employer has payed the taxes for me, by deduction. But just for future references I think it's for the best if I know what happens. "

Now I'm expatriated in the Netherlands. So,   Can I get a visa only from the embassy in Tel Aviv, or also from the embassy here in the Netherlands? Or perhaps even at the US consulate in Amsterdam? If both back home and in the Netherlands are possibilitie4s - is there a benefit (e.g. in terms of processing time) of doing it at the Tel Aviv embassy rather than in the Netherlands?  "

One organisation from NYC really liked me and wants a phone interview and upon it being successful face to face interview.   In my CV I clearly stated that my native language is not English (despite full professional proficiency in English) and that I am currently in South America for a volunteer placement.   I have a US B2 tourist visa, but since I have no address in my CV I didn't mention I will need a working visa.  I'm trying to be fair but at the same time to see how far can I go.  My question is two-fold.   Will it be easier to get a US working visa with a non-profit behind me that offered me a position and are willing to help? When should I mention my situation (non-US citizen, no working visa)? Should it be during the phone interview, or should I keep it about my skills, see if they think I am a good fit and let them decide later if I'm worth the trouble of obtaining the visa?  "

2057,How can I get my stuff to a Caribbean island?,"I need to ship a lot of stuff to a Caribbean island, maybe half a container full of stuff. I realize that I can call a freight forwarder on the island and have them tell me what to do, but I would like to understand the process better.  Presumably container ships only go to the island once in a while, so I need to find out which ships are going at what times and what ports of call they have in the US before going there.  For example, if there is a ship loading up in Miami and then delivering to various islands, then I just need to make sure that my container is in Miami and gets loaded onto that ship. How do I find out which ships are viable?  Also, lets say that I am not shipping my own container, but only a lift van. Then, in that case, I need to ship my lift van to Miami, get it loaded into somebody else's container that is destined for my island.  How does the system work? I assume freight forwarders use some kind of database to find out all the relevant information. Is that a database that I can use? "

2060,"EU citizen and EU child, non-EU spouse - Netherlands visa","I am an EU citizen (not Dutch), with an EU child, married to a non-EU spouse (South African). I am moving to the Netherlands and am trying to understand the process.  I asked an initial question about this in the past. The IND referred me to this link.  My problem is I am getting conflicting information from the IND in the Netherlands as opposed to the embassy in South Africa.  The IND states we need to have my wife apply for a Schengen 90-day visa in South Africa, then apply for a residence permit in the Netherlands once we arrive.  The Dutch embassy in South Africa told me that we cannot apply for a Schengen, but should rather apply for a MVV.  My questions are:   Do we apply for a Schengen or MVV visa in South Africa to allow my wife to enter the Netherlands? Can we travel together to the Netherlands and may my wife remain in the Netherlands while the residence card is being processed? If a Schengen visa, is it not a problem if the 90 days run out prior to the residence card being issued? On the IND website link I provided, the EU family member has to prove that: 'Has lawful residence in the Netherlands (a proof or registration or a valid residence document)' - what does this requirement mean?   I have a small child and want to avoid a situation where he would be separated from his mother. "

I need advice or some clarification about this process:   Get a job offer Apply for work permit (Critical Skills Employement permit in my case) After get a work permit, Me and my wife could apply for a long term visa After visa is approved, we could enter Ireland   Are these steps correct? Or should I do this process first and then, my wife should start the process?  Also, we need to travel with our pet, Is enough having vaccines documentation in order?  Any advice or suggestion is well received. Thanks  EDIT 1:  As @natalie-n stated, the only work permit that allows a partner of the permit holder to apply for family join visa is Critical Skills Employment permit.   EDIT 2:  I made it! I move to Ireland with my wife and my dog :3 "
2063,Renewing a conditional green card,"I received my Green Card on 07/25/2016 as a result of my wife's sponsorship. In my card, I see that the expiration date is set to 07/25/2018 since I have a conditional permanent status of 2 years.   I am planning to take a vacation outside of the US between May 2018 and the end of June 2018. That way I would still have 25 days before my card expires.  My questions is, will there be any issues for me to get back into the US if I return by the end of June? I am planning to apply for a renewal before I leave the country and will that void the existing green card I have? Can I travel with a 2 year green card while I have already applied for the renewal and is in process? "
2064,Is a renter of a room in France required by law to provide a proof of residence?,"In France every resident is required to possess a proof of residence, which must be a utility bill, and a declaration by the landlord if the bill is not in the person's name. French landlords often don't want to provide this document, usually because they don't want their renters to declare their address to any government controlled database so that they can avoid declaring the rent for tax purposes.  On the other hand, this creates a huge burden on the renter since a proof of residence is required to obtain many mandatory services, like opening a bank account (yes, this is mandatory in France). The rent agreement cannot be used as a proof of residence.  If a renter find him/herself in this situation, could this person oblige the landlord to provide this document? Is this document actually mandatory to be provided by the landlord to the renter? "
2065,Can an EU resident live anywhere in the EU?,"Suppose that someone (non-EU citizen) has permanent residency in one EU country. Can she live in another EU country? What are the risks? If the police say something, can she show the permanent residency card? Would there no basically be no problems as long as that person does not want to work or use the public service of the second country? "
2066,France: how to calculate total tax burden (including social security),"Say I got a job in France with a salary of 43,000 euro per year, and I am a citizen of another EU country.  What will my total tax burden be?  I know I can calculate my income tax using a table like that found here.  However, I know I also must pay social security (per the rates here?). However this appears to be partially tax-deductible.  I'm struggling to come up with a clear calculation of how much tax + social security I will have to pay in total on this salary?  Also, are there any other taxes or tax-like payments that I am missing here? E.g. will I also need to pay for health insurance?  Thanks! "
2067,Conditions of keeping an EU National spouse visa (UK),"I am a Russian citizen living in the UK on a spouse visa (married to an EU national). When I was applying, one of the conditions of getting a visa was that my wife had a full-time job, which she has. Now we've moved together and I found a good job for myself, which makes a comfortable living for both of us. So my wife and I were talking about her leaving her current job in order to find a better one, which can mean her being without a job for several months. Will that be a problem for my visa? Does my wife still need to have a job after I received a visa? I think she can't have a jobseeker's status either, because we earn enough as a family. "
2068,Converting Study visa Schengen to Work visa for short period?,"I have a valid study Schengen visa. I stay in EU country. I have finished my studies and I have got an internship for 120 days in Switzerland. Do I need another work visa? If yes, should I be applying in the country where I have stay permit?  If the period is less than 90, will I still need work permit in Swiss (if the previous Schengen is valid)?  "
2069,"Non-EU citizen living in the UK, moving to Italy with Italian husband","I hope someone can help with a step-by-step explanation as I haven't got a clear understanding as a result of my communication with Turkish and Italian consulates.  I am a Turkish national. I've been living in the UK for 10 years (no British passport) and married for 1.5 years to an Italian citizen (practicing his EU treaty, 7 years). We have decided to move to Milano, Italy, in two months and intend to stay there permanently. In the meantime, I hold a residence card of family member of an EU citizen, issued by the UK. This enables me to live and work in the UK and travel in the EU without a visa (under the EU law and not UK law). So, I don't have any problem entering Italy without a visa for short visits.   First, we still haven't got our marriage registered in AIRE, the Italian consulate in London yet. We're wondering whether it makes sense to register it here in London or when we arrive in Italy, considering we have only 2 months left here. I don't want to be told that I should have done it in London when I am already in Italy. Also, I am scared that it might take months if we do it through AIRE. Do I need to apply for a visa or a residence card (similar to what I have here in the UK) to remain in Italy with my husband? Do I need to apply for it at the Italian consulate in London or in Italy? Where in Italy if so? Are there any other documents/certifications I should obtain while in Italy?  "
2070,Can an EU 'Permanent Resident' work in non-Schengen country like the UK?,"So I'm Australian, but living as a Permanent Resident in The Netherlands. I know I'm free to work anywhere in the Schengen zone with certain conditions etc.  BUT - how about non-Schengen countries like the UK? They say you must be an EU CITIZEN in order to work in the UK and that they do not recognise permanent residents as being ""citizens"" and they only look at the passport of the person coming to the country.  This is from the un-Help desk on the Home Office phone line, so I'm not sure this is correct, but the consulate won't help either. Any ideas? "
2071,Moving to Spain with non-EU partner,"Me and my boyfriend are both non-EU citizens (I'm a Russian citizen and he is a Colombian citizen). Currently we are living in the Netherlands with working permits as knowledge migrants and we are also registered as partners, which is an equivalent of pareja de hecho in Spain.  I got a job offer in Barcelona, and now the company that is going to contract me started with a paperwork of getting a working visa for me.  What would be the easiest way to bring my partner with me? Can he also apply to Spanish visa based on my application? "
2072,US state (or other country) with sub-16 driver's license?,"In many (most?) states in the USA, people can drive alone legally at age 16.  (Typically at 15 they can drive under supervision of an adult driver, and then on the 16th birthday can pass a test so as to drive fully alone.)  i) is there a US state where the drive-alone age is younger than 16?  (Setting aside ""hardship"" licenses: in some eg. rural areas people can get a driver's license before 16 if especially needed because of, eg., medical issues etc.)  ii) indeed, setting aside the US, is there a 1st or 2nd world country where, again, one can get a license to drive (alone) younger than 16?  I really couldn't find a ""list of driver's license ages"" on a worldwide basis, nor on an intra-US basis. "
2073,Finances to Settle in the UK under spouse visa new rules (after 2018) as self-employed,"This is a complex question as so it seems the rules have not been fully made up for settlement in 2018, but I come from a non-EU country and my wife is a British citizen with no other nationality.  We have applied for my visa under the spouse new rules (after July 2012) and have already done it twice (first leave to remain, followed by second leave to remain). I will complete 5 years under the new rules in 2018, where I'll be eligible for settlement. The new rules state that your sponsor (the British citizen) should earn £18,600 to successfully sponsor you (additional to other relationship requirements etc..) and once you are in the UK, both of your incomes can sum up together to complete the £18,600. We have already gone through this process and completed the first two steps using income from paid employment all the time.  The rules regarding settlement are a bit vague now and don't have concrete answer to what evidence is required to settle under the new rules (at least in the financial aspect), but it is very likely that they will require you to show the same £18,600 using the same criteria that it is needed for the Limited leave to remain rules.    This is our projected situation for the time we apply for settlement in 2018: My wife is doing a PhD and receives a stipend/grant every month. She will continue her PhD until about September 2018, but that's her only income and according to the rules for leave to remain, they will not accept evidence for grants if you can't prove that you are going to receive the grant for 12 months after application date (so if say we apply in February 2018, there will only be 7 months more of stipend income). I'm very sure even if we provide them evidence that she will get a postdoctorate that earns more than enough as soon as she finishes her degree that won't count either (they won't accept promises of future employment unless it's an entry clearance application and the offer is for the sponsor coming from abroad and within 3 months of visa date). So in this case we are a bit stuck and we can't use her income.  I'm self-employed and will probably earn more than enough each year until we apply, but if the rules are to be the same as the leave to remain rules,   I'm a bit confused to know what documents to show (and this is where my question goes):  Will it suffice to prove this requirement by only showing the following?:   Accounts certified by your accountant for the previous tax year (which I suppose must be 2016/17 because the year 2017/18 will only finish in April 2018, correct?) Letter from HMRC with your UTR Tax return for that year (2016/17) which will show evidence of NIC payments and your income after taxes   I hope if someone had experience applying under the new rules (July 2012) for entry clearance and leave to remain, using self-employment income can confirm this is correct/enough? "
2074,Living in France as a researcher,"It seems that the average salary for researchers in France (see for example here) is much lower than the average salary for professors (with both teaching and research duties) in any other western country (in particular, US, UK, Germany, Switzerland).      Is this difference motivated by substantially lower living expenses   (e.g., real estate market, public transport, income taxes) compared to   the aforementioned countries?       Where can one find data (or other information) on this topic?     Background   Personally I spent several month in France, but in the form of many short (academic) stays, so I'm not able to evaluate precisely the cost of living permanenty there. However, I'm interested in moving to France, and I'm trying to make an informed choice. Therefore, another question is     Where can one find useful information about living in France aimed   precisely at scholars (e.g., dealing with two-body problem)?  "
2075,Applying for jobs in Singapore without Employment Pass?,"I'm an Australian citizen looking to work in Singapore. I believe I would meet the requirements for an Employment Pass.  According to the self assessment tool I met the criteria.  I've noticed some advertised positions specifically mention visa sponsorship.  If a position does not mention sponsorship, is it worth applying? I do not technically have the right to work in Singapore.  Is it a usual process for HR departments to assist with obtaining an Employment Pass? "
2076,"Traveling to London for 5+ months, can I enroll my son in school?","I'm traveling to London for what will be about a 5 month trip. I'm a UK citizen (by descent), and have never lived in the UK. With me will be my son, a US citizen (and not UK), who is 4 years old. Will it be possible to enroll him in (preferably a public) school? Alternatively, what other kinds of non-formal educational environments could I look into? (I.e. day programs that an adult can accompany a child to). My apologies if this is not the right Stack Exchange site for this question. I realize it might not qualify as an expatriate-related question, but I figured many expatriates might have done a similar process to the one I mention. Any help or tips are greatly appreciated. "
2077,"Parcel from family delayed in Spanish customs, as if merchandise. What to do?","Our family has sent us a (Halloween...) parcel to Spain from overseas. This parcel contains a collection of our own things from before we moved to Spain, each of insignificant value. Unfortunately, it has been delayed in customs, and it appears we are due to undergo a complex procedure with the goal of paying import tax or something like that.  We are confused. The parcel is already ours, we're not buying it from overseas. Worse, we're required to provide receipt and proof of payment, even the approximate cost of the package would be difficult to evaluate. We bought some of these things years ago, so these documents are very much lost.  And the instructions are very confusing. We essentially must:   Fill in the form on paper. Scan it with the receipt and enter into the specified website. Receive a quote by email. Walk to the nearest Correos office and pay it. Go home and wait for the parcel.   Did anyone encounter something like this in Spain? Is this supposed to happen to personal things? Would it be possible to explain to the post office that the parcel contains personal things? What would be the best course of action?  Below is enclosed the original letter from Correos, with the personal information removed:    "

2079,Main differences between living in Lausanne and Zürich,"   What are the main differences between living in Lausanne and Zürich?   In particular, in terms of taxes, difficulty and affordability of renting/buying a (family) accomodation in a near town, internal public transport, and commuting from near towns, childcare, support for families, education system, etc.  I'm aware that the language spoken in  Zürich is German, while in Lausanne is French.

2080,Economically inactive savings requirement Germany for non-EU spouse to get residence permit,"My non-eu spouse and I plan to move to Germany next year. I am a British citizen, however currently we both live in South Korea, where we both work. We are intending to spend some time to travel together during the first part of next year which means that neither of us will be working directly prior to entering Germany, so won't be able to prove any current income on arrival. I would prefer not to find employment immediately on entering Germany as I will be working on a personal art project that will not bring any income for a few months. However, my wife would like to begin work immediately on entering Germany.   We both have savings which will total around 13,000-15,000 euro when entering Germany. Can I exercise my EU treaty rights as economically inactive in Germany with our savings and will this allow her to apply for a residence card allowing her to begin work immediately?   If this isn't possible, I would seek a very minimal part time job, perhaps 10 or less hours per week, would this be sufficient in order for me to exercise my EU treaty rights enabling her to apply for a residence card?

2083,"An EEA returning to original country does ""EU law"" or ""Domestic law"" for Family Reunification","My wife is German, we have been living in Mexico (I am Mexican) and she got a job in Belgium. As we understand: in our case, Family Reunification will be governed by ""EU law"" since she is an EEA citizen.  Recently she found out that there is the possibility for her to transfer (same company) to Germany with a new German contract. Doing a bit of research we found out that ""German law"" would apply for Family Reunification if she is working in Germany. But what happens when we first apply for Family Reunification in Belgium?  A friend of ours mentioned a something, and this is is particularly what I would like to ask here: She said that If an EEA resides/works in EU but outside of his/her country for a certain amount of time and that EEA person returns to reside/work to his/her country of citizenship, then EU law will apply instead of domestic law for Family Reunification.  Does anyone knows about this? what is it called? Where I can find more information about it? "
2084,Must I register my child's birth outside the USA?,"My child was born outside the USA, and is possibly † a USA citizen according to the rules. She is a UK citizen and has a UK passport she has travelled on within europe already.   Must my child travel on a USA passport (they already have a UK passport); and, therefore must I register the birth with the embassy (i.e. obtain a CRBA) before taking my child to the USA?   Links to the official documents that confirm/deny this are really what I need.  From the embassy FAQs (highlighting mine)     If your child has a claim to U.S. citizenship, s/he is required to enter and depart the United States on a valid U.S. passport. S/he should not enter the United States on a foreign passport with a visa, or visa free under the Visa Waiver Program.   The wording here is confusing - one sentence says ""required"", the other ""should not"" (as opposed to ""must not"" or ""cannot"").  I am asking as my child is under a year old and we have booked trips to see her grandparents in the USA for christmas. We were unaware of these potential rules and have not got her USA passport, SSN or CRBA yet. Does that therefore mean she cannot enter the USA on her UK passport? If so then we have a problem we need to deal with.  † for the purposes of this question I will assume she is a US citizen "

I then received a letter back from the landlord saying the following to me:     Wir bestätigen den Eingang des oben genannten Schreibens sowie das   Mietvertragsende zum 31.01.2017.      Bitte vereinbaren Sie rechtzeitig vor Vertragsende einen   Übergabetermin mit unserem Büro.

2087,Graduating Canadian F-1 Student: TN vs. OPT,"I am a Canadian student graduating from a US university. As far as I know, I have two visa options when it comes employment in the industry: F-1 OPT and TN.   What are the advantages and disadvantages of each? For one thing, I know that OPT allows me to work for multiple employers for an unrestricted amount of time each day for a year (before extension), but TN restricts me to one employer only. I need to pay a ~$400 USCIS processing fee however, for OPT. Are there other considerations in choosing between the two? "

I am about to move to Germany and to start the application process to obtain a residence/work permit via my German spouse with a local German Ausländeramt as directed by the consulate general in New York. For US citizens, the process may be started, as a special case, after entering Germany.  The set of rules to follow to obtain the permit (per the consulate) is here: [website]At the bottom there is a section:     Work will be automatically permitted on approval of the residence permit.

2090,"Do I still have to pay the Runkfunkbeitrag as a tenant sharing a house with landlords, while paying the ""Warmmiete"" already?","I recently moved to Germany and I currently live in a house shared with the landlords, whereby I pay a fixed ""Warmmiete"" every month and don't have to pay anything extra for electricity, gas, internet etc.  I just received a letter from ARD 2DF Deutschlandradio Beitragsservice asking about the Rundfunkbeitrag. It seems to state that under the new 2013 regulation, it's ""Eine Wohnung - ein Beitrag"". Therefore, it seems to me that I shouldn't have to pay any extra under this situation, and thus should select ""Ein Familienangehöriger/Mitbewohner zahlt für diese Wohnung bereits Rundfunkbeiträge""?  The website then asks me ""Die Beitragsnummer lautet""... Does this mean I'll have to ask the landlords for the Beitragsnummer of their payment and fill it in, or does it refer to something else?  Also, what should I do once I move out of this address? If I inform the Bürgeramt, will they automatically inform the television and then they send me another letter?

2092,Help needed if possible!,"I'm applying for visa (re-applying to the UK for EEA FM) tomorrow and I've attached this letter which I want to enhance. Can you please help me with that?  Here's my letter to the consulate:     To whom it may concern,   I am writing to you to clarify my situation why I did not provide satisfactory evidence of my relationship with my wife what led to a refusal, and all respectfully demanding you to review the decision you took towards us.       I am the EEA national family member, (my name), I am married to a Romanian, (my parter's name) who is settled in the UK, arriving there on the 9th February 2014.    We've been together for 3 years and 8 months (44 months), and have been married a year ago, on the 11th Nov 2015. My wife has visited me twice in my country, Algeria.   I applied to the UK for an EEA Family Permit on 19th Oct 2016, and provided a file to show that we have a genuine marriage. I was aware that the supporting documents are crucial, and included photographs of my wife pictured with my parents, brothers and cousins.       On the cover letter we’ve listed what documents we were providing, the communication evidence was included, I keep in touch with my wife daily, but we did not show the proof of  communication for the reason that how difficult it is to back to the year 2013, since our relationship began and go through such long period of 44 months to obtain the conversation history, we didn’t give it such significance that the Family Permit request would be refused due to it.   Another reason why I did not include our communication proof is that I didn't know how to attach that sort of evidence to the visa application (download and print or download FB and Skype conversations onto USB flash?). I went ahead and applied without any proof of our communication.    I had the right to appeal against the refusal, but my wife and I have chosen to re-apply as you stated that you’re expecting to see our communication evidence covering up the period we’ve been together. This time we did include the evidence of our chat history.   We strongly believe that refusal was wrongly taken, thus we are re-applying again, including what you are expecting of evidence to prove our marriage is genuine, none of a sham marriage or relationship of convenience. We hope that you examine our application, and revise the decision you gave towards us.   We would appreciate your attention to this matter.   Faithfully yours,    My name  "

I have maybe three cubic meters of stuff that I haven't yet had time to sort through, so I'd like to bring it with me rather than store it for however long I'm on the road.  (It is what's left of sixty years of accumulation by me and my late wife, both not-quite-hoarders but pretty close.)  I'm not changing permanent residence because I don't have one.  Sold it when I retired.  There are some books, some clothes, some electronic parts, more than ten photo albums, and lots of paper (files).  I'm guessing three cubic meters.  Certainly far less than ten.  Resale value less than a hundred US dollars.  Can I travel with it on a freighter without paying a fortune?

2094,Why are the British visa fees so expensive?,"My wife and I are preparing to travel back from Japan together to the UK.   Documentation itself isn't easy, but we check all the boxes.   My question is, why are the costs for this so expensive?   Due to my new job starting in January, for us to leave together would require faster processing, with the IHS service charge we're looking at over 2,000 pounds for just the visa.   Whereas in Japan, it would cost us somewhere in the region of 40 pounds.   I'm just curious why its so expensive? Are these arbitrary amounts produced by government to put people off? Are they eventually leading to benefits for the people paying taxes in the UK?  "

No other site I've looked at or testimonial I've read has specifically mentioned something like this.  Not even the embassy (which I know isn't necessarily up-to-date) mentions anything like this: [website]Is this a new law or something, or it just overstated?

(3) Would my current work permit allow me to easily look for jobs in other EU countries? "

I want to take it with me (I'm a software developer), but I'm doubtful that I can fit it in my luggage, so I'm thinking of shipping it.  The shipping costs seem affordable (†), but Kenyan customs fees are a mystery to me. This is not a new iMac. Should I expect to pay duty or taxes on it? How much? Are my customs-associated risks higher if I ship it than if I check it as luggage?  † Detail: A site like myus.com quotes me ~$200 to send it, which is cheaper than  "
2099,Are citizenship test questions updated?,"A recent Washington Times Web feature presents a sample of questions as being from a US Citizenship test, including ""How many justices are on the Supreme Court?""  The answer choices are 7, 8, 9, or 12, and 9 is marked as the correct answer.     If a person were taking the test today, should they answer a question like this with 9 (the number of available positions) or 8 (the number of justices actually on the Supreme Court)? Are other questions on citizenship tests generally updated to reflect current events? While this particular question came from a US test, answers about other countries' tests are welcome too. "

2101,What is my legal status in between K-1 visa and Permanent Resident (USA)?,"I've been given my K-1 fiancé(e) visa and will be moving to the USA (Colorado) and marrying my fiancée this month.   A K-1 lets me enter the US for 90 days, marry, apply for a GC, and then ""remain in the United States while USCIS processes the application."" [[website]I want to be able to answer the question in the situation that an official or police officer asks ""how are you legally here?"" at all stages of this process:   Before I'm married, I can say ""I'm on a K-1 visa and about to get married"". Easy. Once I'm married, I'll apply for the Green Card. Until my 90 days runs out I can still answer ""I'm on a K-1 visa, just got married, and am applying for a Green Card"".  After the 90 days but BEFORE the GC application comes through (which can take months or even years), what do I say?  Once I get the GC after 6 months or so, I can say ""I'm on a Green Card"", easy.   As the K-1 will expire after being married but before receiving the Green Card, I am concerned an official not familiar with the process (such as a police officer on patrol) will say: ""This visa stamp says it expired [date]. I don't care if you're 'waiting for your application to be approved', that means you haven't got one, you can't be in the US if you have neither a current visa or a GC"".  Is there some name or legal title for myself, or some document I can show after my 90 days but before receiving the GC?   I would assume that the GC application give me a receipt of some kind but I haven't had this confirmed.  Thank you for your time "

2103,Do I qualify as a Permanent Resident of the UK?,"I'm a German citizen who has lived in the UK since 2006. With Brexit and all, I thought it was about time I got my permanent residence document. I started as a high school student in 2006, and graduated from Uni in 2013. I've been either self-employed or unemployed since then (with other odd jobs and global travels sprinkled in).  I thought I acquired permanent residence status in January of 2011, however, I like so many other students, only now realize they must have been covered by comprehensive sickness insurance (CSI) to qualify for permanent residence.  I know some have said if I got a residence card before the CSI requirement kicked in in June of 2011, I would still be covered. I didn't do that.  Here's the kicker: My earliest letter from a school dates to January of 2006, and so theoretically, I acquired the status in 2011 - 6 months before the new law went into affect. Now my thinking is that once I have the status, no one can take it away from me as long as I'm physically present in the country and never gone for more than 2 years (the time period set by the EU for loss of permanent residence). So, I should be able to apply for the proof document without showing proof of insurance.  However, the language I've read is confusing. It seems that maybe the requirement was always there, but before they didn't require it for the application.  Is it true that only ""new permanent residents"" after 2011 need CSI? Or are they saying this was always the case..the only difference now is they're going to ask for proof of it?  Does that question make sense? "
2104,Registering a car in Lithuania without being a resident,"As an EU citizen, do I need a address in Lithuania in order to register a car there?  Regitra just states that owner data will be verified against the Lithuanian Register of Residents, and if one is not registered as a resident, the owner needs to provide some proof for the address which will appear in the registration papers, such as an identity card or an apartment rental contract.

Edit: by relocation service, I do not mean movers (so the people who physically pack your belongings and move them to another country), rather a service that sorts out the particulars of life at your new location, e.g. helps you find a place to live, place your children in nursery or school, sets you up with tax numbers etc, gets you registered with a doctor, etc. etc. "

Thus we are looking to establish legal residency in the Netherlands pre-Brexit so that we can be grandfathered in when/should Brexit take place. All advice on this matter is welcome though I have two specific questions:  In your collective experience, what exactly is needed to register with the municipality: is a longish term lease needed or can an AirBNB booking plus assurances that we are looking for something long term enough? Does my whole family (partner, infant) need to be present at the registration office or can I take all of our passports/documents in?   Note, I have contacted the municipality (Maastricht) to ask these same questions but the autoreply I got said there might be a few weeks wait...time we don't have. "

Being UK resident, I am not allowed to drive foreign registered car in UK. Which is totally stupid, but whatever.   Now to my question, how should I proceed when I am actually moving out? I own a van in my home country which I want to use for that purpose. Am I supposed to rent a van in UK, drive it across the Channel with all my belongings, load them into my Schengen van, return the UK van back to UK, cross the Channel on foot and drive my Schengen van home? Well.... that just seems silly. I also don't intend to hire man and a van to move my stuff over the border.   If the police pull me over in the UK, how do they tell whether I am a tourist or a resident? I do not have UK citizenship, I only have my home country Passport, ID and Driving License.   I have already sent an email to DVLA, but I'd like to know other people opinions and hopefully even some experience.   Thanks for any advice. "

We have been told that if his hospital writes a letter describing his illness and his inability to travel, she can travel with her kids without him travelling with them and she will be allowed to enter the UK from Italy. Are there any legal grounds for that?  My brother-in-law used to work regularly till January this year but lost his job and then went to Pak for three months trip in early this year. He hasn't been able to find any regular job and has been doing a few hours here and there to make ends meet till he has diagnosed a month ago.

2121,Insurance and use registration-exempt vehicles in other member states,"Vehicles of the classes L1e, L2e and L6e with EU type approval do not require registration anywhere in the EU. In most cases, the driver requires an AM driving licence and in all cases an insurance policy is required. The most common type of such vehicles is a moped.  I'd like to buy, use and keep such a vehicle in another member state indefinitely.  Background/reasons:   I don't need the vehicle in my country of residence. Driving it back and forth is not possible as such vehicles have a maximum speed of 45 km per hour and the distance exceeds 1000 km. Cost and environmental reasons make a normal car unacceptable.  The same applies to rental vehicles. Light vehicles are usually not available for rent, and if they are rental costs prohibitively high. As I intend to use the vehicle in rural regions, not having any vehicle at all is not an alternative. Insurers in my country of residence don't seem to have heard of such vehicles. The don't mention them on their websites and in the calls I made so far, the other end a. didn't know the vehicle classes and b. didn't know what a moped is. Insurers are reluctant to issue insurance policies to non-residents or insure cars that are used more than 6 months in members states they don't operate in. The Motor Directive 2009/103/EC appears to ignore these vehicle completely by stating:       ""In order to exclude any possible misinterpretation of this Directive   and to make it easier to obtain insurance cover for vehicles bearing   temporary plates, the definition of the territory in which the vehicle   is normally based should refer to the territory of the State of which   the vehicle bears a registration plate, irrespective of whether such a   plate is permanent or temporary.""   So...  How do I insure the vehicle?  Or as long version:  - Am I actually allowed to keep the vehicle in a different member state? And what exactly would these restrictions be?  - I know that somewhere an insurer is obliged to provide me with a policy. However, insurers in which member state? In a. my country of residence b. the country where the vehicle is actually used or c. any member state.  Can it be that I've tapped into a legal vacuum here?  Apart from direct answers, any suggestions on where to obtain further information are appreciated. "
2122,Schengen visa and 180-day rule,"So I have a question if anyone can help me regarding the finer point of the Schengen visa!

We then traveled by train to Berlin, where my partner is studying at university for a year. I returned to and flew out of Amsterdam at the end of May and returned to Australia.  My ticket to go back to visit my partner (for 6 weeks) would have me leaving Australia and entering Germany on the 5th of August 2014. This is 167 days after I entered the Netherlands in February.  Basically i want to know JUST HOW STRICT the Schengen visa requirements are. Would I be allowed in even though i am just shy of the 180 days? was my entry and exit from Amsterdam electronically recorded? Would it make a difference that I am returning to Germany and not the netherlands?  Any advice/experience would be much appreciated as i am meant to leave in just over a week, and didn't realise i hadn't made the exact 180 days. "

My question is how can I, as a permanent resident holder in Germany, bring my partner along? Can I sponsor him for a visa? Will he be able to work? I've been scouring the immigration and consulates websites for Germany and all the information I can find is for EU or German citizens bringing partners into Germany - but I am neither.  My partner does not hold a job in one of the ""required skills"" type of industries, but he does speak some German. Ideally I'd like to get him a work visa, and then find him a job in his field once he arrives to Germany. We're not concerned with being able to find a job, but rather having a work visa before looking for one as his field is not one in which sponsorship happens.  "
2124,Using a Pay As You Go mobile phone in the UK,"I just moved to the UK from the USA.  In the USA I only used Tracfones.  They were cheap and easy to use.  There was no fuss.  After arriving in the UK I purchased a Nokia 105 pay-as-you-go phone.  In the phone store I also purchased an 'O2 PP BIG Bundle 20 pound COMBI SIM', which I guess is a SIM card on the O2 network.  The salesman asked if I wanted to 'top-up' which I assume means 'add minutes to the phone' which I did.  I think this top-up charge is included as part of the 20 pound charge mentioned above.  Having now tried to use the Nokia phone for the first time I thought I saw that I have 400 minutes.    Someone called me from within the same room and I was able to hear that person on the phone.  I also tried to call that person from within the same room and their phone rang.  So far, everything went as I expected.  However, that same person also called my phone and left a voice message.  I cannot figure out how to access the message.  The manual that came with the phone says nothing about voice messages.  Nor does a separate manual I found online.  Someone suggested I need to dial 901 to access voice messages.  Apparently I also need to 'top-up', which I thought I already did.  Apparently I need a separate 'top-up' to access voice messages, separate from the 'top-up' I paid to make phone calls.  I tried to call the store from which I bought the phone to ask how to make this second 'top-up', since I do not yet have a UK bank debit card and cannot seem to make this second 'top-up' using my US debit or credit cards.  However, when I tried to call the store, which is 3.5 miles away, my call was 'diverted' and a recorded message told me that I need to 'top-up'!  Does this mean I need three top-ups to use this phone?   one top-up to call somebody in the same room a second top-up to access voice-mail messages a third top-up to call a store 3.5 miles away   How many top-ups do I need to use a mobile phone in the UK?  And how do I pay these top-ups with a US credit card or debit card?  "

2139,UK Ancestral visa - dependents: which visa type my I select,"I am South African and want to apply for my UK Ancestry visa. I have filled in the forms, paid all the money and am waiting to go for my appointment.  This morning I applied for my 3 children but I used the incorrect visa type. And lots of tears and drama I have managed to click the refund button (it was not working) it will take 28 days to get my R90 000 back.  Now I am trying to get the right visa type. I would like to submit all our applications in on the same day. IS THIS POSSIBLE?  We called the UK visa number it cost GBP10, a chinese person answered and told us to read the website, then put us on hold. I also drove to my nearest visa center and managed to get someone to talk to me. She said I must choose ""ancestry-child"" but this does not exist on the website.  I see another question answered saying you must select ""work - no tier - dependants more than 6 months"" I have started another application but near the end it asks for the sponsors UK status (british citizen. EEA national. permanent resident. temporary resident) what must I write if my ancestral visa has not been approved yet? "
2140,Does the validity of working holiday visa on France expire if I get out of the Schengen area?,"I consider applying for a working and holiday visa for France.  If I understand it correctly, even though it is only in France where I can stay validly, no one checks my visa and passport even while I'm in other Schengen countries since there is no border check. So it happens when I get out of the Schengen area that I finally get the stamp on my passport.  However in this case, does my working and holiday visa expire once I exit out of the Schengen area, even though there remains a few months? Or can I enter France again until the initial expiration date of the visa?  Also if I can enter France again, is it possible to enter it from another Schengen country via a transfer flight (e.g. a flight from Beijing to Paris with Frankfurt as a transfer, operated by Luthahansa)? "
2141,I failed to notify ward office of fixed residence within 14 days. What will happen?,"I arrived in Japan on August 2 and now it's October 15. I'm on an Engineer visa (5 years) and I'm working in Japan. It's the first time I entered Japan for work.  I failed to give notice to my local ward about my residence address, the one that you have to notify within 14 days. According to the Ministry of Justice's website, my residence status could be revoked... I plan to go to the ward office tomorrow.  In theory, I could be charged for a fine up to 200,000 yens, am I right? I just wanted to know how toasted I am. Has anyone experienced this? "
2142,Is IELTS/TOEFL/German language proficiency score required for German student visa for PhD?,"I have received a PhD admission from the Max Planck Institute. I have been collaborating with researchers there for a year as a part of my Bachelor's thesis and before that, I was a research intern there. So, I did not need to submit any English language score for the admission process.  Will I be required one by the embassy for the visa? I saw this mentioned in some online sources. I am not sure how strong this requirement is. Can I get some form of waiver from MPI? "
2143,Relocation to UK with British child,"I am married to a UK citizen who is living in the UK with his child, my stepson, who is also a UK citizen. My husband can't earn the £18,600, due to his situation, caring for a child alone.  I'm a non-EU citizen, living in Lagos with my daughter who is also a UK citizen. How can my daughter and I join my husband stepson? I am the only one who needs a visa.  1) If I accompany my child as a visitor to the UK, do I need to supply my bank statement?   2) Can I relocate to an EU country close to UK with my child, as she can claim to be an EU citizen? My husband and stepson could visit more easily than coming to Lagos every time.  "
2144,Tier 4 Visa application,I am planning on applying for a Tier 4 visa to do a Master's degree in medicine in the UK.   Will two previous UK visit visa refusals have a negative affect on my application? My husband is a resident in the UK; he has his own flat and I'll be living there with him throughout my studies. Could this affect my chances of getting the student visa in any way?    I am indeed a genuine student and this research opportunity will have a tremendous impact on my professional portfolio. 
2145,How to buy Italian editions of books in Australia?,"I'm going to stay in Australia for a long period and I really miss reading some book, but I'm not proficient enough to read novels in English.   Is there any Australian (online, most probably) book shop that sells foreign-language editions of popular books/novels? Being Australia such a popular destination for immigrants of any nationality, I'd suppose such a thing to exist. Specifically I'm looking for Italian ones.  I've looked online and I can find some shops of foreign language books, but they're often only educational material or books that were originally published in that language. What I'm looking for instead is popular best sellers that you would for sure find in a local book shop, but in Italian. As an example, where could I buy the Italian edition of an Harry Potter book, or of a George R.R. Martin book?  Of course, an alternative would be to buy a Kindle and e-books, but I'd prefer paper if there exists some way to find books.  If you know any local shop instead of an online one, I'm in the Perth area. "
2146,US citizen applying for UK settlement visa/entry (3 part question),"Background: My husband is a UK citizen (by birth, born, raised, etc). We have 3 children together. We all lived together in the US. Recently (May2017) we went to visit family in the UK. Sometime in the summer we decided that moving there was the next option for our family (we'd talked  about it more and more). We have no true ties any longer to the US with regard to family and he has an ailing parent that the siblings are all taking turns caring for. Since I came over as a visitor, I understood I had no right to stay.  So i went back to the states to finalize things, close up shop so to speak. However, he stayed with our children and we were told to obtain British passports as they are British because their father is. They all go to school in the UK now with no complications according to the magistrate and we're working on me.   I've recently (yesterday) applied and submitted and paid for my settlement visa. In printing out the forms to be submitted I noticed a clerical error. It's minor but could be a big deal as it refers to income. Every reference we'd seen refers to ANNUAL income... but here it apparently did MONTHLY and I didn't catch it. Obviously, if my annual income was in fact my monthly I probably wouldn't even sweat it. But as I don't make 20k per month, this is not the case. Can I make a pen and ink correction and include an explanatory letter (along with supporting documentation)? Or do i risk refusal and in turn, my fee? I ask because if I cancel my application it says it takes up to 90 days for a refund. I miss my family. I'm trying not to drag this out further. And obviously don't have the money to just cancel it, repay now and then wait on the refund to get back eventually.  I'm a self-employed freelance graphic designer. It only asks for my husband's income for the financial requirement. By himself he doesn't make enough to support all of us. But with my income we do with no issues. We're married and have shared a household so everything had been together. Am I missing an option where I get to enter MY income? *note, I have proof (contracts, bank statement, etc) that can prove my income.  If this is denied or we decide to postpone the application (i.e. I cancel it and wait on the refund) can I still go back over as a visitor? I'd like to see my family at least for Christmas. I know there are things like showing proof of return ticket and what not.   "
2147,Lost UK paper driving licence after residing in France for 22 years,"I was asked to show my driving licence at work today to drive a hire car for some VIPs. I have looked and realize I haven't seen it for months. How on earth do I replace a pink UK paper licence I've had since 1981, without losing the right to drive which is absolutely essential for everything I do here? I've been twice to see if I should change it and was told it was okay, so never bothered getting a French licence. Can anybody advise me on this? "
2148,Philippine national moving to Austria to live with boyfriend - Visa options,"I'm a Philippine national working in Dubai. My boyfriend (who is an EU national) is working in Austria full-time and we want to live together so the plan is for me to move to Austria.  I still have some days left on my Schengen multiple-entry visa, which I intend to use soon to visit him. Then I'll be left with very few days on my visa.  My plan is to work or get another degree (study) BSc./MSc. in Austria. I know it is nearly impossible to find a job there while not being there so my plan is to look for a job while there. Also, my professional skills in Austria would require me to speak German.  I've thought of the following possibilities:   Get a student visa to study in Austria and have a part-time job while studying. Maybe drop out of university if I managed to get a full-time job, but that would require to change my visa status, which I believe to not be difficult while being already in Austria with a valid visa. Get a vis to study German. This would be a short-term solution but it would allow me to look for a job while attending the German language school (German would definitely help me getting a job) and let me pursue my career with my current professional skills or change career paths. Get a 6-month or 90-day tourist visa and after landing there request a living permit and then search for a job. How difficult is it to get a living permit from a tourist visa in Austria? Even when my boyfriend will be providing me with housing and support. Is it possible to get a working visa while not actually having a job in Austria? I believe it is not possible at all. Any other possible solution that I've not mentioned?   While I mentioned a visa to study German and for a university degree, and also looking for a job, I do really intend on doing the studies (university or German language) in Austria and not use the visa as an excuse to move to Vienna and not attend anything.  Also, my boyfriend can support me in any way - housing will be provided by him. Is there anything that my boyfriend can do to help me with the visa process?  What are my best options to get a visa to move to Austria? "
2149,Gay Marriage in the EU,"I am an Indian passport holder. I'm in love with a Luxembourg citizen. We have known each other for 2 years. We both are gay. We are planning to get married in a country where gay marriage is legal. The problem for us is, I applied for a Schengen tourist visa and got rejected twice. Can you please help us? Is there any marriage visa in the EU or Luxembourg? "
2150,"Marriage abroad, how to handle the bank residential address?","I am a US citizen (California) preparing to get married abroad, in a country where the process for marriage is well known for being quite slow, and the marriage visa process is just as long. So I'll be somewhat of an expat (no USA home) during the marriage process. The cards are lining up nicely, the company I have spent 5 years with has given me their blessing to work aboard for as long as I need (I work from home now so the work will get done wherever I am).  As I've begun to research this process of moving overseas for a medium-term (1 year) trip, I've come across the frightening reality that banks will close down US citizens bank accounts with short warning if they determine that the citizen does not have a permanent address. While I plan on using a mail scanning service for the bulk of mail, I'm at a loss for what to do about residential address. I know that banks can access the USPS address change database as well, and can detect if you move away from currently registered address within some period of time. (And they can see all the addresses in your credit report, and ask your mobile provider to verify your address, fun!) Losing access to my bank accounts while trying to get married could leave my future wife and myself to be stranded within our marriage or visa application processes.  What's the best way to handle this situation with Bank residential address? The patriot act seems to indicate that next-of-kin addresses can be used for the residential address, and my parents would fit that description. Can I use my parents (Virginia) mailing address safely? Parents don't mind, but I would not have the documents to prove I live there.  Some additional details:   Bank is currently Navy Federal CU, but I'd like to add HSBC account as a backup option due to their presence in marriage country. Getting account abroad is difficult before marriage, and I have payroll that needs to go to an American account. Additionally, American bills to pay while abroad. I'm worried that sending a large wire or transfer of funds to my fiance's account before we are legally marriage will flag things at her bank for suspicious amounts.  "
2151,"What is the point of removing the ""Valid to Work Only with DHS Authorization"" legend from the social security card after getting the green card?","I have read on many websites that after receiving the green card in the United States, it is advised/required to replace the social security card in order to remove the ""Valid to Work Only with DHS Authorization"" legend.   Is it required? What is the point of removing the ""Valid to Work Only with DHS Authorization"" legend from the social security card after getting the green card?  "
2152,EU citizen going to work in the UK. Can my Chinese girlfriend come with me and possibly work in the UK?,I'm a Dutch citizen currently self-employed and living in China. From March 2018 I'll be working full-time as an employee for a UK company in London.   Is it possible for my Chinese girlfriend to come with me (we've been together for 1.5 years)? Is it possible for my Chinese girlfriend to work in the UK? (She will be bored as hell if this is not possible).   She has a Bachelor's degree in marine biology and has a strong grasp of the English language. She speaks and writes fluent Mandarin and Cantonese. She currently works for a company that handles the visa process for people immigrating to the EU. 
2153,Change of employer in type D visa in Germany,"I have a type D visa, work permit for Germany after travelling from India. I got the visa via processing from the Indian employer. I am on deputation.  Now if I find another local employer in Germany who is offering a permanent job, is the work contract of the new employer enough for me to change/transfer the current visa to the new employer? Or do I have to apply for a new visa? Basically what is the process like?   My current work permit has the Indian employer's name under the remarks column, which means basically I can work only for that employer. "

2155,Insurance for UK residents living abroad,Health insurance for ex-pats abroad? I am thinking of buying a house abroad (outside Europe) and living there for probably 9 months of the year and back here for the other 3 months. I would rent out my house in the UK and stay with friends when I returned to UK. My holiday insurance says I should be 'permanently resident in UK'to qualify. How do you define 'permanently resident'?    I`m still on the voters roll. I`m registered with a GP.  I have a bank account here.  I am an OAP here.  I pay taxes here.  I am British.  This is my home country.  I just choose to have a holiday home abroad and holiday abroad for 9 months of the year.    So am I 'permanently resident' here? 
2156,How to read Unique Client Identifier (UCI) for Canadian Express Entry application?,"I am applying on the Canadian Express Entry scheme. In the application form they asked me if I have ever applied for immigration, refugee or citizenship status of Canada before? I did apply for a visit visa last year which was refused. Should I answer yes to this question? When I answer yes, they ask me to provide the Unique Client Identifier (UCI). I found a UCI on my visa letters, but the system is not accepting that UCI because the pattern is wrong. This link ([website]"
2157,Getting a mobile phone contract in Austria,"I am new to Austria, having arrived in Vienna 2 months ago. I would like an Austrian SIM for my mobile phone, but don't understand how to go about getting the best deal, which for me seems to be a SIM on a monthly contract.  At UPC they told me I needed to register with CRIF GmbH (some kind of credit reference agency?) who might take 2 weeks to set up a profile for me and then I could try to apply for a contract with them.  I already have a bank account, contracts for broadband, electricity and gas, Legitimationskarten, and Meldezettel registration, and apartment and garage rental contracts... is it really necessary for me to register with CRIF? If so, are there other agencies I should consider registering with?  UPC also told me that there was no way to get a pre-paid SIM, either with them or with anyone else. I don't find this likely, and hence the doubt over the other things they've told me: what is the best way to get an Austrian SIM after only 2 months in the country? "

The working permit will be issued independently of my wife. A resident permit would be issued to my wife IF she was non-EU too.  BUT, she is an EU national. Further, she would not like to work right now or maybe she would study.  I wonder: After 3 months, what she is supposed to prove? I work and I bring the money, but I'm the non-EU. Does it matter or she is required to work/study/have money in account? The country we will live is not Portugal.   Further, can I require the Blue Card in this situation? "

His H1B (I-797) petitioner and employer (from which he is getting his salary is still the same).    Does he or his organization needs to file H1B amendment in this case or only LCA is sufficient?

She has a 4-year old daughter from a previous relationship, they were never married and he vanished pretty much as soon as the daughter was born. Since then my girlfriend and the father of her child have never made any contact what so ever nor has he made any attempt to contact her or his daughter.  I pretty much know the process of getting married so what I need to know is can I or my wife apply to have both the mother and daughter come to the United Kingdom together or is she only allowed to join me first, then after the first two or so years she is able to bring her daughter to join us in the United Kingdom?  The daughter is so adorable it breaks my heart to think I'm separating them, from birth she hasn't had a dad and now her mother has met me and I've half kind of become a fatherly figure, it may look like to the poor thing I'm taking her mother away from her, it's just heartbreaking so surely there is a system in place for both mother and daughter to come here in the UK together right?

Para C states the reason can be either of the following:   education background employment history level of English relevance of proposed study/ employment inconsistency of info with previous application intention to comply with visa condition and leave Australia on completion.

2167,Does a student coming to Canada for less than 6 months with a travel allowance need a work visa or study permit?,"Why I'm coming to Canada:  I'm currently a fourth year undergraduate engineering student holding an Indian passport. I've been accepted for a 6-month thesis at Ecole Polytechnique, Montreal, Quebec. The thesis is an academic requirement of my university, and comprises the last semester of my undergraduate studies. My university requires me to do a thesis for at least 4 months, although preferably 5 to 5-1/2 months to get the most out of my thesis. My university has no tie ups with any Canadian universities.  What benefits I'm being offered:  My offer letter states that I will be provided a 5000[tex] scholarship, based on my performance during the first 3 months.  What I've looked at so far:  At present, I'm confused about whether I will require a work visa, a study permit, or neither. Since I'm not getting a stipend per se, as far as I can tell, I will not require a work visa, but I'm not very sure. Also, as per the Canadian Immigration and Citizenship website, it seems that a study permit will not be required for a short-term course (6 months or less). Does this mean that I require neither visa? If I require neither, then what type of visa would I require? "
2168,"Don't understand the Schengen area visa system, for staying Denmark? Not sure if I have overstayed?","I am a British citizen, have a British passport.  I don't know if I have overstayed in Denmark, very confused as I thought originally as a UK citizen I could stay there for as long as wanted unless I am working/studying/wanting citizenship/benefits... None of which I have asked for nor claimed. I have been staying with Danish family and travelling.  It has now come to my attention that there is all this stuff about the Schengen zone and that someone with a non-EU passport can only stay for certain period of time and there seems to be conflicting information on an EU passport holders position if they aren't working or claiming anything.   So my question is: What happens if you have stayed longer than 3 months but are, as said, NOT working/studying/claiming any benefits and intend to go back to home country at a certain point... But have not registered with any authorities in this time? Is there punishments for this and what to do about it if in that situation?  I am really worried that I have done something stupid without intention  Did I need some kind of permit or agreement? Because the only reason I did not seek out this was as I thought it was for someone intending to stay in a country andor get work there, which I didn't intend at this time "

2172,USA: Car rental residency country for J1 holder,"I am a Swedish citizen, J1 visa holder in the US since 15 months, so for immigration and tax purposes I am a non-immigrant, non-resident alien. I'm going to rent a car over Thanksgiving, and found that the rates are extremely different depending on if I select USA or Sweden as country of residence - a factor 3 cheaper for Swedes, and that includes liability insurance, which is not included when you are American. I have both a US driving license and a Swedish driving license, but the Swedish license is not valid to use here anymore since I have been here for more than a year.  The rental car company (Alamo) says that they consider you as a resident of the country for which you have a license - so then I am a resident of both?  Can I rent the car showing my Swedish license and still be covered by the liability insurance? "
2173,Can stateless individuals in the European Union legally reside and work there?,"I am curious if anyone has found a solution to staying in the E.U. as a stateless person, with rights to reside and work? A U.S. citizen is allowed to formally renounce their U.S. citizenship at any U.S. embassy, WITHOUT first having another citizenship, thereby becoming stateless. Would such a person then be permitted to remain in the E.U., obtain housing and employment? Or would they be placed into detention indefinitely? (They couldn't be deported back to the U.S., no longer being a U.S. citizen.) "
2174,I've lost my passport and residence permit while staying in Austria. What are my next steps?,"This is a copy of the same question I asked on the travel forum and there they asked me to ask about it here.  I am an Indian student residing in Italy, my girlfriend is also a student from India residing in Vienna, today her wallet containing her passport (with visa) and residence permit were stolen.  We promptly filed a report at the local police station, where the police office told us that the report is enough for travelling to Vienna (she left today).  I printed out the last and front pages of the passport as well as the the visa and attached them to the report, hoping that will be enough for her return trip.  I understand from previous posts that the Embassy at Vienna will issue her a temporary passport.  But I am a bit scared, as she has no other documents with her. Not even the residence permit. How would she go about regenerating everything?  For now we decided that she will go to the local police station in vienna and file another report before proceeding to the embassy for a temporary passport.  But what happens from there? "
2175,What U.S. agencies should I inform on leaving the U.S. to live abroad?,"I left the U.S. to live and work in Berlin, Germany. I arrived 5 days ago.  On the German side, everything is well organized, and moving along.  However until now, I hadn't reflected on which U.S. agencies, if any, I need to inform about my re-location abroad. I just found someone to take over my lease, and forwarded my mail to a relative, and left.  What U.S. agencies should I inform, if any, that I left the U.S. to live abroad?  So far all I've found is that I should inform the IRS that my address has changed -- presumably, I would provide them with my new German address, not a state-side relative's, but I'm working on confirming this.  Am I supposed to inform anyone else? It seems too easy, to just leave. Surely it's harder than this? "
2176,How to become an expat at 22 in a stable 1st world country,I am not quite sure about this but I was wondering I am currently 22 years old and I am a software developer in South Africa.   The recent political tension and instability in the country is forcing me to consider working and possibly immigrating to another country more and more.  What would be the best way to do this? And how? Are there any agencies out there that specialize in finding you a job abroad? Is there anything I should look out for like a red flag? For example I don't want to work in a country for 5 years and not get citizenship. Perhaps a guide to follow would be useful.  I was hoping there would be like an agency that you can give your CV to with countries that you would be interested in then they try to find you a job there.

I’ve read about fines, or even being branded an illegal alien if you overstay the 90-limit. I’ve submitted the application, but expect a few weeks for processing and mailing before I receive the passport—but I only have a little over 30 days left.  Do I still need to leave the Schengen Area at the end of 90-days to avoid penalty?  Is there another way I can prove my British citizenship to stay (and travel) within the EU after the 90-day limit while I await my passport?  Note: I am in Portugal at the moment, but will be in Switzerland when the 90-day limit is reached. "

Will I get deported? And how long is the ban from Norway? Or I am also be banned in the rest of the shengen countries for overstaying here in norway? I hope somebody could answer. 
2179,Dutch dual citizens' loss of Dutch citizenship — can it be avoided if married to a UN employee?,"A Dutch citizen who is also a citizen of another country will lose Dutch nationality after living outside the Kingdom of the Netherlands or the EU for ten years.  The ten-year clock can be reset by, among other things, getting a passport.  People in this situation therefore typically have to be certain that they apply for a new passport every ten years, making sure that there is enough time for the new one to be issued before ten years elapse from the date of issue of the previous one.  There is an exception, however, for those who are outside the Kingdom and the EU in the service of the Netherlands or of an international organization to which the Netherlands belongs.  This exception also extends to those who are living with a spouse or domestic partner who is in such service.  Someone who is burdened by this requirement might wish to make use of the exception for those in foreign service.  My question is about those married to or in a partnership with a staff member of an international organization.  To qualify for this exception, are there any requirements regarding the staff member's nationality, or the nature of the position?  In particular, must the staff member have some connection to the Kingdom (beyond working for an organization of which the Kingdom is a member)?  For example, would a Dutch/American dual national living in New York be able to retain Dutch nationality without applying for a passport, by virtue of being married to a UN staff member?  Would it matter whether the staff member had American citizenship, some non-Dutch EU citizenship, or some non-EU citizenship? "
2180,Changing employment and country with Finnish Blue Card,"I am holding EU Blue card from Finland for more than 18 months. I got a job offer from Germany and I satisfy the requirements of Blue Card from Germany. As a specific condition my future company wants me to join orientation training on their HQ in Switzerland starting from 1st of Nov. I will be doing roundtrips from Zurich to Helsinki for two months. Then I will be relocating to Dusseldorf on 1st of January. I know that I need to make a fresh Blue Card application from German embassy. Also I find following link very useful about changing coutries while holding blue card.   Here my questions;   What is the best timing to apply for the EU Blue Card when you consider my specific situation? I believe I can enter Switzerland with my current Blue Card. So can I delay this application around 1st of Dec. or even after 1st of January? If not, then I apply for German EU blue card as soon as possible. So how long will it take to get my Blue Card? I heard embassy can issue some temporary work permit while I am waiting for new card? but no guarantees. If I get my german EU blue card before 1st of January, what will happen to my residence in Finland, since my children are going to kindergarden, if residency drops they lost their kindergarden. What is the relation between blue card and residency? If I dont get my blue card form Germany after 1st of January, can I rent a house in germany and get a residency so that my children can continue their kindergarden?  "
2181,Extending stay under Family Visa UK,"My fiancee and I would like to settle in the UK. I am a British citizen and she is an American citizen.  She was refused entry November 2018 due to the IO not believing she was a genuine visitor. She received a visit visa May 2019 and visited for 3 weeks August 2019 before leaving.  I do not meet the financial requirements (18,600 GBP) and so I'm seeking to change jobs to meet this. In the meantime before I earn this, we're visiting each other back and forth for 2-3 weeks.  The plan was for me to travel to the USA under the VWP, get married, then return home and apply for a spousal visa some time later. However, we've explored the option of simply waiting until I meet the financial requirement, obtaining a Family Visa as a fiancee and just marrying in the UK and then extending her stay.  Can this be done? How long is the extension for?  The reason for this is because I don't want to marry her then within the space of a couple of months sponsor her for a spousal visa as it could look like a marriage of convenience. We've lots of pictures from our time living together for less than a year in China and we've kept our plane tickets both to and from each other's countries.  I really don't know if I should marry her in the States or just wait until I earn enough for us to marry in the UK, and then apply for a Family Visa. I doubt we can get married before March 2020 as I have just 4 days of annual leave left my job and it doesn't reset until then.  So, does anybody have any advice on the following:   UK citizen using VWP to travel to the USA to marry an American before returning to the UK. Extending stay under Family Visa when entering as a fiancee. Would getting married then quickly applying for a spousal visa raise suspicions? I mean, why would we choose to wait if I'm eligible to sponsor her?  "
2182,UK Tier 4 Visa UCSIS/Biometrics Help,"I posted a similar question in the travel section, however this is super urgent so possibly someone can help me over here...  Basically I had an official appointment at a UCSIS Application Center, which I booked through the UK Visa &amp; Immigration Center for a Tier 4 Visa. I missed the appointment and called only to be told I was not in the system and did not even have an appointment. They advised me to call the UK Visa and Immigration's website, which I did... only to be also told they have no idea what to do. They recommended me to another department and said I'd receive an e-mail within 15 days. Time is of the essence, as I was supposed to be in the UK by the 30th for university, however I believe it is going to be delayed.   Does anyone know as to why this would've happened? Is the UCSIS still processing biometrics? I see there are premium centers available, but for a hefty fee. If I start to book an appointment through them, I want to make sure my previous appointment was voided. I have no idea who to contact anymore as I've contacted both sides with no help.   My only worry is the front cover page of the biometrics, in my visa application I selected the UCSIS location, and have no way of changing it to a premium section now.   Any info in the application that does not match, could cost me being rejected.   If anyone has any further advice as to what I should do next or who to contact, it'd be greatly appreciated. "

2184,Invitation letter for postdoc in China,"I am an Indian citizen and getting a postdoc offer from BIT, Beijing, China and will be applying for work (Z) visa soon. I wish to take my husband along with me on a dependent (S1) visa.  The Institute is providing me an invitation letter to proceed the visa formalities. They have mentioned my name and inviting me there. Now, to ensure that my husband gets S1 visa (which is for > 180 days) and not a tourist visa (L visa, &lt; 180 days), I am asking them to mention my husband's name as an accompanying person in the invitation letter itself. But they are denying it and citing that generally, mentioning the accompanying person's name in invitation is not applicable.   But, my visa agent is saying that this will bleak the possibility of getting an S1 visa for my husband. Is there any chance to include the name in invitation itself? If not, what can be done from my part to ensure my husband an S1 visa?  "
2185,Aufenhaltstitel validity after staying away from Germany for more than a year?,I went to consulate in my home country and they said since my husband is a EU BlueCard holder and I have not been de registered from Germany I can travel with my aufenhaltstitel and it remains valid. My husband is locally employed in Germany and I am planning to join him and therefore went to apply for the Fanily Reunion Visa but was sent back saying my visa is valid and we cannot issue you a schengen visa when you already have a valid visa. And they also said I can very much travel on that visa. Now my question is will i be stopped at the airport? What if they say that my visa is no more valid? Will they know I was out of Germany for more than a year?    Art des Titels    Aufenthaltserlaubnis  Anmerkung   30    
2186,Belgium internship visa from non-EU country,"I am an Indian citizen pursuing studies in France. Now I got a paid internship in Brussels which will last six months. Currently I am in India and I want to apply for a Belgian visa from India.  I understand that I will be needing a type D long-stay visa. But I couldn't find out what category visa I will need.  I see there's a specific Internship visa category in the website of the Belgian consulate in France but I couldn't find a similar category in the website of the Belgian consulate in India.   I mailed the consulate here in India and they informed that I will be needing ""visa D - Single Permit"". But the employer has only provided ""BIS goedkeuren opleidingsplan"". I guess this is not a work permit? Or is this document sufficient to get a ""single permit"" visa? "

I sent off all of my documents in a package at UPS through 2-Day Air mail along with a 2-Day air return label around 10 AM from LA which is to be sent to the VFS Global office in NY.  About an hour later at 11 AM, I received a strange e-mail stating:   “Dear Applicant,    Your online application has been received at the UK Decision Making Centre in Sheffield.    CUSTOMERS IN THE USA  If you enrolled your biometrics at a US Dept of Homeland Security Application Support Centre (ASC) then the processing time on your application will start as soon as we receive confirmation from the New York Scanning Hub that your documents have been received and uploaded to our system. “  I don’t understand why I would’ve received this message, if I JUST sent off my application through the mail. What online application do they mean? Just the UK Visa and Immigration application form, that they might have access to? Is this normal to receive this before even sending off my documents application?   There’s no way my documents application would’ve been sent to NY and then Sheffield in one hour. Highly confused and slightly concerned.   If anyone understands this, it’d be greatly appreciated. Thank you.  "

My sponsor has indicated that they want me to stay an extra year but I'm having problems with visa options as the scheme they are under only allows my visa to be for a maximum of 12 months (ie it will expire this January). A Tier 2 work visa is not an option unfortunately, nor do I have British ancestry.  Can I return home (Australian passport holder), get another 12-month certificate of sponsorship from them, and re-apply for another Tier 5 GAE visa straight away? Or is there a minimum time I have to wait between work visas?  "

Although my husbands previous employer didnt de register him and didnt cancel his aufenhaltstitel as well. And also even if I have not been de registered from germany but my address is showing unknown. What does that mean? Is my aufenhaltstitel still valid? Have I been de registered or is it that they are unable to find my address and hence showing unknown? I have been away from germany for more than a year but the consulate in my home country say my visa is valid. But now I got to know this? What does that mean? 
2190,Overstayed in Norway for 6 days with C type visa 27 days validity,"Recently I traveled to Norway for a job interview by company with valid Schengen visa, SINGLE ENTRY - TYPE C (business visa) valid for 9th to 27th September ( 19 DAYS VALIDITY )  I traveled to Norway on 10th of September and completed my job interview successfully during 11th and 12th September. Company offered me the job and I took it.  Originally I was planned to return on 12th September however on 12th Sept company and I mutually agreed that I will stay another week in order to complete familiarization etc.  So my original ticket was cancelled and new flights were booked to depart on 19th September as follows : Norway - Copenhagen - Munich - Mumbai Everything was going smooth until when I was questioned on 20th Sept by Immigration officer in Munich airport (before boarding flight to Mumbai) as why did I overstay when my visa was allowed to stay only for 4 DAYS  This was shocking to me. Obviously in the whole process, I had not realized that there is limitation for my stay ( Duration of stay 4 days ) in Norway and blunder had happened. I had missed to notice this and only remembered that visa is valid until 27th September. It was unintentional from my end, neither do company HR people checked this before postponing my flights etc. My stay was extended without knowledge of limitation of stay.  I explained the immigration officer all the truth and original plan etc. however he didn’t agree.  I was taken to the inquiry office by Immigration person (police). After few questions, and noting down my residence address (India home town address) and my job position details, company name, I was made sit for about 1/2 an hour. Later, I was shown and asked to sign a form and declaration which stated that overstaying and not having a valid Schengen visa is illegal and punishable act etc. Due to time constraint and nervousness I did not read every word of the form and signed as per instructions from Police.  I was told by police that my case will be presented to the judge who will decide next course of action. Also I was shown a name on the form who will act on my behalf to present my case etc. (I don’t remember exactly). As per Police , I will be informed if any action is needed.  I am obviously very scared that what will happen next. Just to let you know, my company is also preparing my work permit through a 3rd party agency in Norway. My plan is to re-enter Norway in next month and appear in front of Norway police to process the Norwegian work permit and then get residence card. I have planned to work and stay in Norway and company is processing the formalities for that.  I have informed above incident to Norway officer HR person, who mentioned that let’s see what happens next and she would help. I have not informed this to work permit agency thinking that it might be all okay, nothing will happen and to avoid unnecessary mix-up at this stage.  Frankly, I have many questions in mind and am afraid what will happen next. Will I be punished, fined or not allowed to enter Schengen region ? Will I be rejected the next visa which I am planning to re-apply in next month ? Will my new job proposal be withdrawn by company in case this issue escalates ?  Your kind and urgent reply will be highly appreciated. "
2191,Request to expedite I-130 denied. Is there anything I can do?,"Executive Summary:   Q: Is there anything I can do to speed up the I-130 processing time at this juncture?  Q: Is there any way my wife and son can return to the U.S. for a short period?    Overview  I filed the I-130 to petition for my wife and son, accepted on July 24, 2019. The USCIS website says that the processing times are currently 6.5 to 8.5 months for a U.S. citizen filing for a spouse, parent, or child under 21.   Last week I called my congressional office, filled out the necessary paperwork, and requested that the USCIS expedite the petition for my wife and son, on the grounds of financial hardship. Unfortunately, my request was swiftly denied. The response said the following:     Good afternoon,      Thank you for your inquiry on behalf of your constituent requesting   expedited processing of their Form I-130, Petition for Alien Relative.      USCIS records indicate that your constituent’s Form I-130 was received   to the Potomac Service Center on July 24, 2019 and is pending   pre-processing and background checks.   Your constituent’s expedite   request was reviewed and denied. Information regarding expedite   criteria was last updated on May 10, 2019 and is posted on the USCIS   website at www.uscis.gov/forms/expedite-criteria.      Your constituent’s application will be processed within the normal   USCIS processing times, which can be located on the USCIS website at   [website]     Please let our office know if you have any additional questions.   I understand I can appeal or try again if I can file additional paperwork to support my claim. I won't go into too much detail on this but I was laid off in early May 2019 and have not yet been paid for April 2019. I found a new job but I am deep in debt and struggling to pay off bills, beginning to roll over credit card debt, and incurring expensive living in the UK due to the short-term nature and inability to properly plan with the uncertainty of the Visa timing.   The expedite criteria have the following to say:     USCIS may consider an expedite request if it meets one or more of the   following criteria:      Severe financial loss to a company or person, provided that the need   for urgent action is not the result of the petitioner’s or applicant’s   failure to: File the benefit request or the expedite request in a   reasonable time frame, or Respond to any requests for additional   evidence in a reasonably timely manner;       Urgent humanitarian reasons;      Compelling U.S. government interests (such as urgent cases for the   Department of Defense or DHS, or other public safety or national   security interests); or       Clear USCIS error.      When considering severe financial loss to a person: If the expedite   request relates to an application for employment authorization or   student status, the need to obtain employment authorization or student   status, standing alone without any evidence of other compelling   factors does not warrant expedited treatment.      All expedite requests claiming severe financial loss, regardless of   the immigration benefit sought and regardless of whether the claimed   loss is to a company or a person, must be documented to establish the   loss and that the requestor is not able to withstand the temporary   financial loss that is the natural result of normal processing times.   That last part is of particular interest to me: the requestor is not able to withstand the temporary financial loss that is the natural result of normal processing times. I think that describes my situation very well. I'm looking at waiting another 4.5 to 6.5 months right now while my wife and son are living in the UK. I don't think I will be able to afford another 4.5-6.5 months of this. I am crashing at my friends place and my wife is floating around from short-term accommodation to short-term accommodation because she can no longer stay at her mother's house due to mustiness and mold. Even more importantly, I'm extremely worried about the emotional and psychological toll this is taking on my 3-year old son.   So some final questions:    Is there anything I can do to try and speed up the processing of my Immigration forms?  Are there any forms I can file so that my wife and son can re-enter the U.S.? She is unable to enter the U.S. on an ESTA because we were married in March 2019.    I know it was an egregious error on our part for her to leave the country after getting married in the U.S. but without a Visa, but I can't go back and change that now. She returned to the UK shortly after I lost my job and I was pleading with her to move in with my parents but she preferred to go back to the UK. I knew it would be bad if she returned without a Visa but I did not realize it would be this difficult to sort everything out.  "

I left France and will be returning after a year of leaving to marry my French fiance.  My questions: 1. Is my carte de sejour still valid to use to enter France for the wedding? Or do I need to apply for a separate visa? I'm unable to find any info on the prefecture website on whether the carte gets invalid if I leave France.

Is this work permit from the employer, limited only to this company? ie) With this work permit visa (assuming that is valid for a year from the German state), can i search for other companies as well?  2.

2196,Can you Work Remote under F1 STEM OPT?,"I am an International student from India currently in my F1 STEM OPT Visa (valid till 2021).

Question  My company has an option to work remotely from anywhere in the US (All employees are Americans except me). I always wanted to travel around different cities in the US and work from there for few months and move to different city. The best option for me is to work remote. So is it possible to work remote under my current stem visa?  If not, are there any other options to meet my lifelong goal to travel and work in US? "
2197,"Why does my new California drivers license say ""LIMITED-TERM""?","I am student on F1 visa since 2012. I got my California drivers license 2013, valid for 5 years. After 5 years I applied for the Real ID card. Although my visa was valid for another 5 years (until 2022), they put the end date of the I-20 as expiration date (May 2019). For that drivers license I went to DMV and it did not have any indication of ""limited term"" etc.  Now I graduated in June and meanwhile I am on OPT. Although I applied to renew my drivers license already early May (!) it took until now to receive my new Real ID drivers license. It is dated exactly until the end of my OPT so I am pretty sure they cross-checked with USCIS which is why it took so long.  My new license is identical to the old one (except for the dates) but it contains the line ""LIMITED-TERM"".  What does that mean?  And why would I have it on the renewed version but not on my old one? "
2198,How can you register in another EU country as a job seeker?,"I'm a Dutch citizen who is receiving temporary unemployment benefits. I will receive these benefits for 3 months. At the end of the 1st month of my benefits, I will move to Italy to look for a job. I know this is possible and I have also received permission and a ""U2 form"" from my local unemployment office. I am also aware that as a jobseeker, I don't need to register as a resident for the first 6 months.  However, I do want to register my residence in Italy. I need this because I want to eventually go to my local municipality to get an official document stating that I'm registered and living in that address in Italy. I will send this official document to another organization in the Netherlands as proof of my residence in Italy.  Looking through EU law and other information, I cannot find a category for jobseekers' registration. For example looking at the F.A.Q. of the European Commission on citizen's EU rights:     What documents can I be asked to produce to obtain the registration certificate?       A valid identity card or passport and proof that you   comply with the conditions for the right of residence, depending on   your situation: a confirmation of engagement or certificate of   employment, or proof of self-employment, if you are a worker; proof of   enrolment at an accredited educational establishment and of   comprehensive sickness insurance cover, plus a declaration or proof   that you have sufficient resources, if you are a student; otherwise,   proof of comprehensive sickness insurance cover and of sufficient   resources.   This answer covers workers (doesn't apply), self-employed (doesn't apply), student (doesn't apply) or a person with sufficient resources to not work (doesn't apply).  So is there a way to register your residence as a jobseeker in another EU member state? "

2200,12+ month business stay in Spain -- cost of life,"I'm offered a 12+ month long freelance work in Alicante, Spain with €3160 per month after tax. I know that this is a good salary, but I'd like to know how much of this I'll spend for everyday costs of living?  I'm EU citizen, 37 years old male. I'll be living in Spain alone.  I perfectly understand that these costs may vary much, based on how much do I spend on food, how will I be travelling (I don't plan to rent a car) and where I'll be living.  That's why I'm only asking for a very general information -- general average or medium range. I.e. will I spend €1000, €1500, €2000 or more?  If that may help -- I'll be staying alone and picking medium / cheap solutions where ever possible. I want to save as much as possible to support my abroad family and to visit them as often as possible (which requires a lot of air traveling and generates costs).  Is there any website or service (like areavibes.com for USA) which could allow me to estimate costs of living in Spain for single person?

2204,Which EU countries have a well defined process of obtaining a visa + residence permit on the basis of income from remote job for non-EU citizen?,"There is a class of residence (but not work) permits (non lucrativa / non-working / visitor / retiree) for people with stable income sources outside of the country. This kind of residence permit should be perfect for people with remote jobs who want to stay for more than 3 months in a country they like, but don't have relatives or a job there. However, it's hard to find a lot of info on this topic, except for Spain: 1,2.  Judging from those articles, there are plenty of hidden obstacles (like you need to sign the lease before you get the permit; and what to do with it if you're refused?).  Or in Cyprus, you should apply for residence permit (""pink slip"") on the place, so it's not clear how you apply for long term visa to get there. And after you apply for a permit, there is a several months waiting period - what if your visa expires? Should you leave or stay?   So, are there countries where it's actually straightforward to get a visa and then a temporary residence permit for a person with remote job or passive income? "

2209,Medical test for travel to Canada,I am an Indian citizen. I have a valid Canadian Student visa valid from April 2016 to March 2018. I am planning to travel to Canada in early 2017. The validity of my medical test performed for the issuance of the said visa is till December 2016 (as it was done in December 2015).  Will I be able to travel to Canada in early 2017 without having to undergo the medical test again? Can I do the medical test after I arrive in Canada in case I am required to? 
2210,Temporary Residency in Spain: Is there a better way?,"I don't see any duplicates in the suggestions, but some of my previous questions (listed below) are somewhat related.  Consulate website says I can have a “duly accredited representative” do my visa application—but only under certain circumstances.  Otherwise, I have to personally go to Houston both to apply, and to pick up the visa.  And that they keep my passport, preventing me from taking advantage of the ninety-day no-visa option (citizen of USA) while I wait.  Furthermore, as part of the application, I have to include a lease or purchase agreement proving that I already have a place to live in Spain.  (Spain has no hotels?)  So I am supposed to go to Spain, buy or lease a home, then return to USA for two or more months to get permission to live in it!  (And pay for it for those two months that I am not using it!)  They say that all documents must have “certified” translations into Spanish.  Does that mean I’m not allowed to translate them myself even though my Spanish is good enough to survive in remote parts of Mexico, Spain, and Peru for periods of time?  (BTDT)  And I'm puzzled to see on another forum someone claiming that the consulate’s website is wrong, that English is good enough and you don’t need an appointment.  I already have a ticket to Barcelona for 8 Jan 2017.  Is there any way i can avoid coming back for two months after finding an apartment?   Even going into France, England, Italy, etc. would be preferable to going all the way to Houston.  (I say Houston because I have a mailing address in Oklahoma, even though I don’t currently have a home anywhere.)  I guess I should have also mentioned that my income exceeds the €25K requirement, that I have insurance to return me to USA if some urgent need arises, that my medical coverage covers emergencies anywhere, and that I plan to purchase insurance in Spain for routine care (even though I can afford to be self-pay).  Questions somewhat related:  Cheapest way to ship three cubic meters from Oklahoma to Spain?  Can American citizen get an NIE in Spain while on no-visa 90-day visit?  U.S.V.A. health coverage outside of CONUS?  Must have bought or leased before applying for entry?  Which visa for about a year in Spain with flexibility for Schengen?  Where to go to obtain Spanish residency  Can a nomadic US citizen have &quot;bona-fide resident&quot; status? "
2211,How long can I stay in Canada?,"I am an Irish citizen living in the USA with a permanent resident card. I own a house in Canada.   How long can I stay in Canada at one time before returning to USA?    And if I return to USA how soon can I turn around and go back to Canada, and for how long can I stay?  "
2212,Tax implication for US based IRA/401K when retiring to Italy,"If a US citizen retires to Italy, becoming a resident in Italy, and using Italy as the country of tax residence, how will distributions from an IRA/401K be viewed by US IRS?   How is it viewed in Italy?   "
2213,After Brexit - Partner visa for American girlfriend of an Italian living in the UK,"My girlfriend is American, I'm Italian and I'm living in the UK.   I met my girlfriend at the end of March 2015, we started living together from the 1st of July 2015. A few months ago she had to move back to the States and so we're seeing each other every 2/3 months.  Would she be able to get a Partner Visa in the UK this year, after Brexit?  When could we apply for it? Do we have to wait for the date stated on the first proof she has that states that she was living at my same address?  And how long would it take to get this kind of visa? I read around the internet that it could take from a few weeks to several months (and that the price increased of 25% this year). Any more precise estimate?  Thanks "
2214,British Citizen applying for Canadian citizenship,"I am a British citizen living inside the UK. I wish to immigrate to Canada and become a Canadian citizen. I am in a long distance relationship with my partner who I have visited before and wish to stay with in Canada, and we plan to eventually apply for civil partnership or common law partnership (I am unsure as to the differences between these two partnerships, if any).  I am over the age of 18 and have a Level 6 qualification (BSc Software Engineering), and I currently work as a software developer with some work experience under my belt. I have no debts to pay other than my student loans. I don't drive as of yet however I plan to begin lessons very soon.  I have looked online for steps that I would need to take to become a Canadian citizen, but nothing is in one place and conflicting information can be confusing. I would greatly appreciate some help on the matter, and can give additional information on my current situation on request.  EDIT:  Thanks for the information. I've looked up my immigration options, and according to my choices (on the Government of Canada site - [website][website]Which states:     “Full-time” means at least 30 hours of paid work in one week. One year of full-time work is at least 1560 hours.   Now, where I work, I put in 40+ hours a week. Does this mean that I will be able to accrue enough hours to equal the equivalent of 2 years of full-time work in just 1.5 years? Also, does it factor in paid holidays? "
2215,Moving from France to the UK in September - taxes and tax breaks given the different years?,"This is a specialisation of the How to handle moving between countries with different tax year dates question, for what seems like one of the specific edge cases from it.  France uses calendar years for tax years, while the UK for complicated historical reasons uses 6th April - 5th April for personal tax years. As I understand it, from the UK-France tax treaty, if you spend more than half of a year living and working in one of the two countries, then you'll count as a tax resident in that country but not the other.  What happens if you move from France to England in September though? For the sake of argument, let's say you move + change jobs on Saturday 6th September 2014. By this point, you'll have spent more than half of the French tax year (2014) in France. However, you'll also then spend more than half of the UK tax year (2014-2015) in the UK.  In such a case, what things do you need to pay tax on in France, what things do you need to pay tax on in the UK, and what things at the higher rate of the two? Secondly, what French tax-resident savings can you take advantage of / not, and what UK tax-resident savings can you / can't you take advantage of? "
2216,How do I register to vote as a non-resident American citizen?,"Can I register to vote in the United States if I turned 18 in a foreign country and have no intention of returning in the near future?  If so, in what state would I be registering, and what's the process? "
2217,How does US J1 visa termination affect a UK Tier 4 student visa application?,"In 2012 I participated in ""Work and Travel"" student exchange program and obtained J1 visa. But because of conflict with my employer the program was terminated and I had to come back. The problem is that visa sponsor gave me only 5 days to leave USA. Since there were no affordable tickets available on that dates, I overstayed for a week. Is this considered as violation?  Now I am completing my Tier 4 (General) visa application. How do I answer to this question: ""Have you been deported, removed or otherwise required to leave any country including the UK in the last 10 years?""  I didn't get any official order of removal only notified by sponsor employee by phone. "
2218,How are unemployment benefits working in Austria?,"I'm an Italian citizen living in Austria.  I know that after 52 weeks of working there is a right to some unemployment benefits, but for how long and for how much money? And what happens if I leave Austria and get my residence back to Italy?  Are there other requirements?  I've found this link but it's in German and the automatic translation is not completely clear. [website]"
2219,Why is it almost impossible to find a property in UK that accepts pets?,"I've been looking for the last three weeks to get a place to rent in north Kent, as I have to move there for work, and it's impossible to find a property that accepts cats – I'm having two adorable and clean cats – and is decent.  Out of a selection of more than 40 properties (for which financially I'd be amongst the top candidates), on which I was really liking 20, I could only get to visit 3 properties, and those 3 properties were not even decent. Old carpets that look like being more than 10 years old, single glazed windows, kitchen and bathroom not having been updated since last century.  I'm actually trying to get something that is equivalent or better than what I already got, and I'm leaving in central Paris where the rents are in the world's top 10.   All in all, I'm almost feeling discriminated because I'm having pets and I do love them!  So, that's all for the rant, but really, why landlords enforce such a policy in UK? Even though I agree animals can do damages (but humans can do worst), that's also the reason why we give a deposit to cover any extra cleaning or repairing cost!  And what would happen if I say I'm not bringing my cats in, but I actually do? Can I be expelled because of the breach in the contract? And isn't there any law that can protect the tenant to host whoever and whatever he wants during the time of the lease, like we do have in France? "
2220,What are the bombshelters for in Singapore?,"I noticed that all condos have bunkers in Singapore. It's apparantly also a building regulation to have a bunker in newly build condos. I'm just unsure what the incentive was to create this regulation in the first place? What is it that they are supposed to protect you from?   Singapore is very peaceful (last invasion dates back to the Japanese during WWII, not counting the failed Indonesian bombings) so I'm actually curious about this one considering we have one and so do all other expats I know. "
2221,"Driver's license, UK, change of address","In a word, what is (really) required in practice, when changing address for a UK driver's license?  Consider, say, the situation where in the UK you are (genuinely) ""living at a friend's house,"" or you've been spending a lot of time overseas. You may have no bank account statements, or utility bills, or lease.  Does any one have any specific, experiential, facts on this?  Thanks! "
2222,Can you move your No Claims Bonus between EU countries?,"If you have insurance on a car in most of the EU countries your insurance premium is usually reduced for each year where you don't cause an accident. Insurance companies are usually accepting other companies' no claims bonus certificate if you switch the provider in a country.  Would it also be possible to move your NCB between providers inside the EU?  If yes, how, and what papers do I need to get from my current insurance provider? "
2223,Australia: Sponsor hunting on an eVisitor visa?,"Is it possible to come to Australia on an eVisitor (Subclass 651) visa for job and sponsor hunting, and then apply and be granted a 457 visa without leaving the territory? Apparently, people used to do that with the Visitor (Subclass 676) visa, which required people to leave the country (for instance, going to New Zealand) to lodge their 457 application from abroad.  If not, what are the cheapest and easiest ways to go sponsor hunting for a 457 visa? "
2224,Can I use a TV purchased in Japan in the US?,"My TV is old. I want to buy a new one while living in Japan. The only thing holding me back is that I have no idea if the TV would be absolutely worthless in the US if I ended up moving back.  Here are the things I am most worried about:   Power (Japan: 100V, 60 Hz / US: 120V, 60 Hz) -- my TV says ""100V~ 50/60Hz"" Broadcast/Tuners (Can a Japanese TV tuner pick up US broadcasts?)   So given that the electricity is slightly different, and the tuners are potentially different, to what extent can I use a Japanese TV in the US? "
2225,"I'm at the end of my Australia working holiday visa, do I need to leave the country for study visa?","I'm at the end of my Australia working holiday visa, do I need to leave the country, if I decided to study full time for more than 6 months? But the course will be start after my visa ends. Do I need to leave the country? Do I need a different visa after the end of the working holiday visa and before the study start? If my student visa granted, do I enter bridging visa? "
2226,What tax/social security would I have to pay any UK salary I earn while a US resident?,"I'm really confused about this. I read a lot about US residents living abroad and earning. I am not a US Citizen but I am/will be a resident soon.  If I owned a company in the UK and got paid a salary from the UK, what taxes would be incurred in the USA. I understand I would have to pay the normal due NI and income tax in the UK. But what US taxes would be due? Would I have to pay the Self Employment tax for foreign income? Or would it just be some income tax? And would state, city and school district tax me on my foreign income? "
2227,Transferring From Australia Visit Visa to other AU visa,"I would like to know if I go to Australia on visit visa (600), can I change to another visa (e.g. work permit-457) while I will be on visit visa inside Australia ? or Do I have to go outside of Australia and apply for a new visa ? "
2228,How do I renew a USA drivers license if I am as US citizen living abroad with no state address (last address Texas),"I have looked at the government websites (state.tx.us/DriverLicense/nonmilitaryrenewal.htm) and seen the requirements but as a US citizen who has passed their drivers test, why is there no standard US drivers license for those with no state affiliation? Or even better an expat US drivers license..any info anyone? "
2229,T2 / F2 / F3 / ... - Appartment size codes in France,"When I open accommodation adverts in France (for instance Leboncoin.fr), I often see keywords I'm not familiar with:   T2 / T3 F1 / F2 / F3 / ... Studio Chambre de bonne   I'm quite lost in what these things mean. I speak limited French so I manage to use the websites, but this is beyond my knowledge. Could anybody please explain the mentioned notions? "
2230,Transfer US-H1b dossier from one consulate to another,"There are several pages available online on the nitty-gritty of transferring H1B from one employer to another. However, can an H1B file be transferred from one consulate to another?  Here is the situation:  I am an Indian citizen. I have been offered a job in the USA starting May 2015 at a university (exempt from H1B cap or some such). I am currently working in Paris France and hence the university who want to employ me from May 2015 would like to petition for my H1B in Oct and send my ""file"" to the Paris US consulate in Oct 2014. If I were to quit my job in Paris AFTER H1B petition is made for the Paris consulate, can this be transferred to a US consulate in India?  I am looking for if this is possible. A solution is for the US university to ""hold it"" until I quit my job but for several reasons, that option may not be available to me since my situation is fickle.  Please do let me know if any further information would be useful for this question. "
2231,International money transfer online from a French bank,"I opened a bank account with Société Générale in France and got access to their Internet banking. I was surprised to see that a wire transfer can only be done online to another bank in France. For international transfers (to countries outside of the European Union) I'd have to go into a branch (and pay a hefty fee). Is this the case for all French banks or can anyone recommend some that allow international transfers online?  To make matters worse, it turned out that I can only go to the branch (""agency"") where my account was opened! Other Société Générale branches have no access to my account whatsoever, so they cannot do anything for me. Is this also the case for other French banks? Is there a bank that allows its accounts to be used at any of its branches?  Edit: please do not suggest ""money transfer"" services - that's not what the question is about. Neither is there any mention of currency exchange above. "
2232,Why do landlords in France sometimes ask for a RIB?,"When trying to rent an apartment in France, especially in Paris, I noticed that some landlords ask for your RIB (bank account details). I'm curious why they would need this. What do they do with it? Does knowing those details enable them to debit my bank account?! (Because I definitely do not want to enable that!) "
2233,Cancellation of an indefinite leave to remain when divorcing,"I am an Indian citizen, having UK ILR and want to know if ILR will be cancelled if I do not visit UK for 2 years?  Actually I'm getting separated from my husband who is a British national and want to cancel my ILR now which is a precursor to our divorce.  Please advise how will it be revoked? "
2234,Where and how to find an internship in Ireland?,"So, here's the situation. I'm a French student (studying web and computers) and I have an internship to do starting in February.  For personnal reasons I'd like to travel abroad in an English-speaking country using the internship I have to do. I'm particularly interested in going to Ireland because I already went there in vacation and found this country lovely.  So here's my question:  Are there any particular ways to find an internship in Ireland? Like a website, specific forums or websites or such ways? If not, what about jobs (because it's almost the same when you think about it) "
2235,How long does green card take for marriage when applying from Canada?,"I am German citizen who lived in California for many years under F1 visa and I am on OPT right now. In October I will be getting married to a US citizen in California.  I am in the process moving to Canada for an ""adventurous venture"", that means: Maybe I decide things are going well and we'll be staying there for a few years or things won't work out. My spouse will stay in the US for now.  I'll have a Canadian work permit but if things don't work out we want to move back to California (if they do, my spouse will follow permanently to Canada).  While I will be able to enter the US as a tourist (Visa waiver) I want to avoid having a longer time (=weeks or even months) where I am not allowed to work.   How long does it take for me to get the greencard while my spouse is the US and I am in Canada? Is it a good idea to apply for greencard immideately, even though I am in Canada or is it better to wait until I know for sure things won't work out in Canada?   In the latter case I am just afraid it will take many months until I will be allowed to work in the US which is financially prohibitive. "
2236,Can I leave Switzerland while awaiting work and residence permit?,"I  have Type D Visa stamped on my passport which is valid from 15-09-19 to 14-12-19 with multiple entries. I am moving to Geneva for work, possibly for 3 years. I have recently applied (on 2-10-19) for a student permit here which takes at least a month for processing. However, for some personal reasons I wish to travel twice within 45 days after I move during which I might not have obtained my permit. I wished to know if I could travel to (1) Schengen countries, and, (2) back home to India before my permit come (from 5-11 to 10-11)?  More specifically, does my type D visa which is valid for 3 months for multiple entries let me re-enter the country? Or do I need to apply for a fresh re-entry visa after I reach Geneva?  Also, since there is no passport control between Schengen countries, what stops me from leaving Switzerland and going into other Schengen countries like France, Spain and Germany? "
2237,Filipino with multiple work visa - immigration check,"I am a Filipino citizen and have a valid work visa and POEA records (OEC) working in Malaysia. If I were to transfer to another country and get work visa in that country, will I have any trouble if I go home to the Philippines while still have work visa in Malaysia?  Scenario  My work permit in Malaysia is valid until February 2020, and I am planning to go home to the Philippines for Christmas. But I already received my work visa for Hong Kong and will start on April 2020. If I go home on December and come back to Malaysia on January 5, 2020, I would still have a valid work visa for Malaysia and an OEC reflecting that, but no OEC for Hong Kong.  What if the immigration officer in Manila sees that I have a future-dated work visa for Hong Kong? Will they stop me? If I tell them that I will apply for an OEC once I get to Hong Kong, would that be enough? "
2238,Can I live in Germany with my blue card while working remotely for a company in Switzerland?,I am Brazilian and I got a German blue card 8 months ago. I am considering changing jobs and working remotely for a company in Switzerland.   I know that I can change to a German job as long as I go to the registration office and provide them with proof of my new job. But can I do that with a job in another country? Considering that I will remain living in Germany? 
2239,"What type of visa can I apply for, for a long term visit to Austria?","Being a non-EU citizen from a Schengen visa-free country, and with a UK residence permit valid for another year, what type of visa could I apply to be able to stay in Austria for more than 90 days in a 180 days period?   The purpose of the stay will be just visiting my friends in Austria, but I travel for business purposes in the EU area a lot, and this counts towards the 90/180 leaving very few days to spend in Austria.   Is there any way to either be allowed to go through the 90/180 just in Austria or stop the 90/180 count while in Austria? "
2240,Health Insurance and Intended Place of Stay For Research Assistant (PhD) Student in Germany,"My friend, an Indian national, recently completed a Masters level course in France and has been admitted by a German institute for a PhD program. His contract is of 'wissenschaftlicher Mitarbeiter', and will receive a salary and make state contributions. He is applying for a type D visa using with this form and this document checklist, and he will submit his application to the Consulate of Germany in Paris.   Is it correct to select ""Employment"" in question 9 of the form despite this being PhD studies? The form asks in question 6, ""Vorgesehener Aufenthaltsort in der Bundesrepublik Deutschland/Intended place of stay in Germany"". As he has not availed accommodation in Germany yet, is it sufficient to mention the name and postcode of the institute? The last item in the document checklist asks for insurance, but footnote 2 specifies that it is not required for applicants who pay social security contributions. Is it correct to infer that he does not require health insurance, or does he need to purchase private health insurance? Question 12 of the form asks for the intended duration of stay in Germany. Is it correct to enter the start and end date of the contract considering that PhDs may last longer than initially expected? Would it be acceptable to enter the start date as being a few days prior to the start date of the contract?  "
2241,non-US citizens on foreign driver licenses,"It is sometimes stated that non-US citizens can drive up to one-year on their foreign country license (as long as that country is part of the Geneva Compact), the one-year date being computed from the entry date stamped on the I-94 form.  The particular case I'm interested in is J-1 Scholar in NY state, but perhaps this is more general.  Is the above statement correct? if so, is there an official reference?  Is it a correct interpretation that such date is computed from the most recent entry date stamped on I-94? If someone were to travel and leave/enter the US multiple times per year, then effectively could they drive on their foreign driver license as long as J1 status is unchanged?  Is the possession of an 'international driving permit' of any relevance to the above?  See related question, although it does not completely clarify my doubts. "
2242,Am I required to disclose second nationality?,"Scenario:  I am a dual national of countries X and Y and I'm living in third country Z.  I've entered country Z on passport X.  If I'm asked about my nationality in general on documents (but no question directly refers to second nationality), am I obligated to say both X and Y, or may I disclose only one or the other?   If I'm explicitly asked 'do you hold a second nationality' am I obligated to disclose it?  Thank you in advance.  "
2243,Request a copy of Lohnsteuerbescheinigung from abroad (German annual income tax document),"I have returned to the U.S. after some years living in Germany, and my tax advisor needs a copy of my 2018 Lohnsteuerbescheinigung.  Is there a standard way to request a copy of this from abroad?  I did not receive this from my company since I did not close out 2018 with them. I only worked January and half of February, for which I have both monthly statements.  I have emailed one of the Finanzamt offices in Berlin, explaining my situation, providing my full name, eTIN and my Identifikationsnummer, and offering to provide whatever documents are needed to prove my identity digitally. So far I have not received a reply.  Is there a more standard way of requesting this document?  Is there a way of receiving it digitally, not through international snail mail?  Thanks in advance! "
2244,France Residence Permit Cancellation During German Employment Visa Processing Period,"A friend who holds an Indian passport was pursuing a doctoral course in France, and had a French Titre de Sejour which is valid for another two years. He has discontinued his studies in the French institute following the completion of a Master's degree, and was accepted for a doctoral program in a German institute. He will soon be applying for a Type D German National Visa in the Consulate of Germany in Paris.    I understand that his passport and BRP will be returned to him while the consulate processes his application (approximately 2 months), and he will be invited to have the visa stamped.   Since he has discontinued his studies in the French institute, can the French institute report completion of studies to OFII, leading to the curtailment the French residence permit before he receives his German visa? Does he have any rights similar to UK residents with visa applications in progress? If his residence permit is cancelled, does he have any recourse to complete the German visa application, considering that he was required to apply within France, which is as of now his country of residence, and the consulate does not provide any expedited services?  I understand that he is allowed to travel, since his passport and BRP have been returned to him. Will travelling outside the Schengen area cause any problems? "
2245,Re-apply PR due to exit Singapore with expired re-entrance permit,"I have permanent residency in Singapore.   Yesterday, I had to go overseas to visit my family. At airport immigration, the official told me my re-entrance permit expired two weeks ago. The official said that f I leave, my PR will be canceled immediately. However, I can re-apply for PR again soon after I return to Singapore. Due to urgent family matters, I didn't think carefully and left Singapore.  After I arrived and re-united with my family, I thought about everything that is affected if I don't have my PR: my job, my HDB, bank loan, my insurance...  Is it easy to get approval to get my PR back? Usually how long will it take? During this period before approval, can I continue my work, or will I have to stop my job?   I have stayed and worked in Singapore for about 15 years. All the while my husband applied for me and my daughter's PR and re-entrance permits. Until yesterday, it is the first time I heard and knew that PR need a re-entrance permit. It even shocked me that he renewed himself and our daughter re- entrance permits but did not do mine. "
2246,Leave Thailand without problems with Single Entry Working Visa?,"I have a single entry working visa for Thailand. I live and work in Thailand. Can I easily leave Thailand without problems regarding my Visa? Or will there be problems at the airport at emmigration? With leaving, I mean within 1 day, without letting my employer know. Or is it actually required to let my employer know beforehand? "
2247,Works council approval Germany,"Did anyone here need approval from a works council after receiving a job offer? How long did it take? In my case, after 3 rounds of interviews I was offered the position and after accepting it, the HR lady said I now have to wait for works council approval to start the visa / blue card process. "
2248,Can I register national insurance number without an address nor using a business one?,"I am an EU national and have an EU-registerd company. I will be coming to the UK to do some long-term contracts. Problem is I will not be staying in one place for long, so I will have no long-term address.  Can I register a national insurance number without having an address? Or can I use one of the services who scan any incoming mail and email it to me or send it to my current AirBnB? Or do I have to register a business?  The primary reason I even need NIN is my health. I have some chronic conditions that I will require a checkup every 3 months, so I would like to have an opportunity to visit some local doctors to update my scripts, etc.   By the way, can I get NHS number without NIN? Or say pay like a monthly subscription to use the services? "

Is it going to be as average from 1 to 3 months or extra in my case?   And is it true that I can not apply for the fast same-day service just because I have those refusals? "
2251,Moving to British Columbia,"I will soon be moving to Canada and I plan to live in British Columbia. It is my strong desire to stay clear of big cities. I am not rich or investing money or buying a house. I will work and earn a living. If I move to a small town or a village, what are my options to earn? My profession in the past was in the media and entertainment services business. So the jobs in my field are all in Vancouver. But I don't want to necessarily stick to the same domain. I am okay doing anything to earn and live by. Is it possible to get a job at all in a small town and ""start over"" so to speak? or will it be a struggle and not worth it? "
2252,Earliest date possible for submitting my tax declaration in Germany?,"Driven by my personal catastasis, I would like to know when is the earliest date I can submit my tax declaration in Germany?  I want to do it only for year 2019, and I have only my job (no extra income, no property).  My company will give me the Lohnsteuerbescheinigung in early Feb 2019. However, I can sum up all the amounts from the monthly payrolls, and fill the tax declaration with these amounts.

Can I apply for a Residence Permit without having to live with a relative in the Netherlands?  If so, which Residence Permit do I need to submit? "
2254,Should I have declared my stocks as foreign income in my US Tax Returns?,"I am a US citizen who has never lived inside the US. I was born in Belgium and lived there all my life.  This year I became aware of my obligations to declare taxes in the US. Because of this, I went through the IRS Streamlined Filing Compliance Procedure. I filed the last 3 years of 1040s and 6 years of FBARS.  It seems like everything went through correctly and was accepted.  However, at the very end of 2018 I converted part of the stock options from the company I work for into actual stocks. A small part I cashed out. For this I had to fill in the W9 IRS form for my employer. I did not mention any of this (existence of the stocks, nor the W9 form) when filing my taxes.  Now I'm not sure if this was correct. Should I have mentioned that I own stock in the company I work for? Should I have mentioned the small amount of money I made off the stock options? If so, is there anything I can do now to resolve this?  "
2255,VBLklassik vs VBLextra,"I am a national of one of the EU countries (not Germany), currently working at one of the German universities. As such, part of my salary goes to VBL, which is (if I understand correctly) an additional (in addition to the standard one) retirement fund for people working at universities.  VBL itself comes in two varieties: VBLklassik (default) and VBLextra (I can still opt for this one). VBLklassik has significantly higher guaranteed interest rate, but a pension can be paid only to someone who has been working for at least 60 months. VBLextra does not have this requirement.  I am unlikely to stay at the university for 60 months, so, according to VBL brochures, I should switch to VBLextra. However: does it really make sense? I know that I won't be entitled to VBL pension (which wouldn't be that high anyway), but I want to know if:   is it possible to transfer money, with accrued interest rate, from VBLklassik to the retirement fund of another EU country? in case of money withdrawal from VBLklassik, do I get also the accrued interest rate? (in other words: can I just use this fund as savings account?) what else should I know about this system?  "
2256,Work Visa Application Germany - How do I turn in my certified Copy of Diploma?,"I'm a recent graduate with an internship offer in Berlin, Germany. I'm putting together my visa application and it appears they would like proof of my qualifications (which I'm guessing is my college diploma). The form says I can turn these in within two weeks of handing in my visa application, but it doesn't specify exactly how I can do this. It says to turn it in to the relevant employment office. Does that mean the Bundesagentur für Arbeit? Do I have to make an appointment to do that, and how long will it take me? Can I just drop it off? "
2257,Is Civic Integration exam needed for (non-EU) wife of Italian citizen to join him in the Netherlands?,"I'm an Italian citizen residing and working in the Netherlands. My wife is Brazilian. Does she need to pass a ""Civic Integration exam"" in order to join me in the Netherlands and apply for residence?  According to ind.nl, the procedure to obtain a ""residence permit"" or ""mvv"" requires such exam. But to obtain a ""certificate of lawful residence"" (which is specific for family members of EU citizens) no such requirement is mentioned.  As I understand, these are two alternate means for her to reside: one more general, another under EU ""free movement"" laws. Is this correct?  Is this exam really not necessary in our case then (if we take the ""certificate of lawful residence"" path)? "
2258,Would our child have four nationalities?,"I (f) am a dual citizen of Netherlands and Belgium, born in Netherlands. I only hold a Dutch passport but I have all rights to apply for a Belgian passport. My husband is a UK citizen. We are considering moving to the USA. What would the nationality of a child born there be?  I assume he or she would have all four nationalities at least till the age of 26, where the child would lose Dutch and/or Belgian nationality if they haven't lived there or applied for a passport. Is my assumption true or am I missing any rules? Does the fact that I don't hold a Belgian passport make a difference?  "
2259,Non-EU resident moving to the UK with his EU citizen husband,"I am a mexican citizen who is married to a Polish citizen. My husband got a job in the UK to start at the beginning of january. We are very happy for the proposal but now I am facing a difficult situation because it seems that I need to have an EEA family permission before I join my husband.  However, since I'm Mexican, I'm entitled to stay in the UK for a period of three months. I would like to know if it's possible to obtain the EEA family permit once we are already in the UK. I am aware that to obtain such permit it's required to prove my husband has been working in the UK for at least three months. So, we were planning to submit all the required papers before my time in the UK expires. Is it possible to do that?  Also, how long does it take to get this EEA family permit from the moment you submit the papers to the moment you receive it? "
2260,Work permit and visa for Portugal?,"I'm a non-EU national, currently residing on a Critical Skills work permit in Ireland, together with my spouse.  A company in Portugal (I'm in IT) is going to make me an offer this week, to relocate there. They are willing to sponsor me for a work permit. I'd just like to check on the process for myself and my wife:  Step 1: The company applies for a work permit for me. Does anyone know how long this might take to be approved?  Step 2: We need to get visas to land in Portugal from the local Portugese embassy. The thing is - we're from a country whose nationals don't need visas to land in Schengen agreement countries for tourist visits. Would this pertain to our case as well?  Step 3: After we land in Portugal, we need to apply for residence permits straight away - I've heard the approval process can last up to 60 days.  Does anyone know more about this? Also, would my wife be able to go to Portugal alone before me, to sort out an apartment (we have some friends there)? "
2261,marriage to a F1 or H1B visa holder,Do I need a visa or I can use the VWP (ESTA) to get married to an F1 or H1b visa holder? Is it possible to stay in the USA after that or I have to go back to my European Union country? Thank you.

Aside from the listed required forms (registered residence, passport, passport photos, residence permit application, job description form, permission for job application, job offer/contract, rental agreement, bank statement, proof of health insurance, and copies and copies and copies of some of these), are there any other forms I need? I keep reading in various blogs/accounts that people have been sent back because they're missing ""some specific form"" - but no one has said WHAT those forms are. What are some other forms/documents they might ask for? I've read about maybe needing a ""certificate of good conduct"" and a ""certificate of good health"" on older blogs, but the document requirements on my registration page say NOTHING about it. Do I need them? And other forms? "

2264,"Can you get divorced in the USA, as permanent residents who married elsewhere?","Some friends of mine married in the UK (one a British citizen, the other non-EU non-USA), then moved over to the USA not long after. They've been there for a couple of years now. Sadly things haven't gone too well for them, and some sort of separation looks on the cards, possibly even divorce.  What isn't clear, at least from a cursory google, is where a divorce (if needed) would happen. Would it need to be a UK divorce, as that's where they married + that's the citizenship of one of them? Would it need to be a US divorce, as that's where they live together now? Or is it something they could choose between?   (Or is it a complicated state matter, varying depending on the US state they live in?) "
2265,Can a US citizen living in the UK apply for US Global Entry?,"The UK has recently been added to the countries eligible for the US Global Entry program. As part of the Global Entry application, background checks are done to ensure that you're a ""low risk traveller"", and normally those involve checks with where you live.  On the CBP eligibility page, it says that GE is open to US citizens, without making mention of their country of residency. It also (as of quite recently) says it's open to British citizens.  To apply as a British (UK) citizen, you have to first get the UK government to complete background checks on you, and only then are you allowed to apply through the US GOES system. The UK application site for the background check says it's for British Citizens only.  What's the situation for US citizens living in the UK, can they still apply for Global Entry? And if so, do they skip the need for the UK background check, or if not then when process do they need to follow to get it done? "
2266,What are customs requirements when transferring goods through Germany?,"We are planning to move away from Switzerland and we would like to ship most of our belongings from Germany. We will have about 25 boxes to be shipped and I was wondering how to approach customs on entering Germany (from Switzerland).  I am trying to find out how and where to register our goods as being destined for another (non-EU) country. I will send them off the same day and return back into Switzerland straight away, so if there is any ""shipping receipt"" required, I could easily present this.  I assume it's similar to moving to another country (let's say the Netherlands) and just crossing through Germany on the way there. If anyone has moved belongings themselves, how did you deal with the customs requirements on the border to Germany? How did you register your goods?  [UPDATE]  Alright, so I called the German Customs today and was told the following:  When transporting goods through Germany that are destined for another country, you generally can use the ""T1 Versandverfahren"", with which you register your goods at the customs office upon entering Germany.  The point of the ""T1"" registration is that the goods are under ""customs supervision"" and are obviously not to be left inside Germany.  Technically, you are then transporting the goods to an Airport or Harbour or some Shipping company that should process the export for you and you'll get proof that you have exported them again.  However, in my situation I was considering going with DHL and they might not do this or at least its not clear how the process would work right now.  Therefore, you can also announce the export yourself through a so called ""Ausfuhrverfahren"" using ""Form 033025"", which you can find on www.zoll.de  The remaining question is in which order should this happen?  The kind lady on the phone said I should immediately when importing the goods start the ""T1"" and launch the ""Form 033025"" at the same time. It makes more sense to me, though, to first launch the ""T1"", then ship the goods and return to the customs officer to process the ""Form 033025"" for export when I can actually proof that I just shipped them.  Let me know if anyone has done this - it would be a great help! "
2267,Permanent immigration with academics - is this possible?,"I just completed my undergraduate BSc degree in Pure Mathematics and Applied Mathematics in my home country (South Africa). I am continuing my studies next year and starting my postgraduate studies (Honours Degree and Masters Degree) in the same country.  My long term goal, however, is to complete my PhD and remain in academics (lecturing, doing research etc). My wish, is to complete my PhD studies abroad (my thoughts are between countries such as Germany, UK or France). I know that it is possible for me to go over and do my PhD, however, I would wish to remain in the country and work in academia there on a permanent basis.  Is this at all possible? And if so, how likely is it that I will be able to get a permanent job in academics in one of those countries? Would I be able to obtain a ""working permit"" ?  As a side note: I do not currently have any form of dual citizenship or ancestry in the above mentioned countries  "
2268,Slightly earlier entry to the US before starting a work (J1) visa and possibly having a travel(B1) visa,"I'm an Indian citizen, who lived in the US for 6 years before and now in Europe. I've a travel(B1) visa to the US valid till 2024, and I'm awaiting my work visa (J1), which will start from January 15, as far as I know. January 15 is also the start date of my job in the US, and I'd like to enter a little early, say around January 5. The travel visa allows me to enter the US multiple times, without staying longer than 90 days.  My questions are:   1) Will they automatically cancel my B1 when they give me my J1?  If the answer to is yes, then, no need to proceed further!  2) Will I be able to enter the US around January 5 with my travel visa? The way I'm thinking of a positive answer here is: since I already have a travel visa, I can enter and say I'm here to travel. And then, when my work visa starts, I'm all okay. Is this really so?  3) If the answer to 2) is yes, will I have to find an excuse to travel? For example, attending a conference, or visiting friends, or show them that I've a proof of accommodation? I'll have the excuse and the proof of accommodation.  4) Let's say that I show the immigration only the travel visa on my passport, but what if they browse through my passport and also find the work visa? What will happen then? "
2269,Liability insurance for frequent car rentals,"I have currently moved to Ohio, US. I was planning to start renting cars month on month since my company would be reimbursing it. But they refused to reimburse for insurance. So I have to pay the CDW and Liability Protection from my own pocket. My Credit card covers CDW but I am losing my brains over what to do with liability protection.  I have started inquiring about non owner auto policy, but GEICO refused me cover since I am renting cars too frequently and for long duration. I would be calling up other insurance providers and check. Should I remain hopeful? If I have to pay $300-400 for liability every month, It would be better to buy or lease a car isn't it? "
2270,Australian Skilled Independent Visa - Does working as a student count into work experience?,"I'm planning to apply for an Australian Skilled Independent Visa during the years to come. The Immigration&amp;Border protection site of the Australian Government writes that X years of work experience awards extra points for the applicant. It also notes that one has to have worked in the nominated skilled occupation or in any closely related one, at lest 20 paid hours per week.  However, it does not state whether working as a student (with the involvement of a student job agency) is acceptable. Can anyone please clear it up?  As a related question, in this situation, my 'real' employer is the student agency - that is, my salary is transferred from them and I am registered as if I was their employee - though I'm actually doing work for a separate business. (I am not sure if this is clear for everyone, this is how working as a student works in my country, it's a completely legal way, this is pretty much like a labor hire - or however it is said). So given this, who has to supply papers about my employment, the student agency or the company I'm actually working for, maybe both?  Thanks in advance. "

However, I don't think I would ever be able to get a property of my own here, and without it spending retirement in Singapore doesn't look realistic.  I've tried to research this online, but every single piece of information I could find deals with how to withdraw your CPF savings when or if you leave SG.  Does anyone know if it's possible to retire to other country (not Malaysia) but keep your money in CPF and still receive your CPF Life payouts for the rest of your life?  Or, more general question, do you have to withdraw your savings from CPF if you no longer reside in Singapore? "
2273,Applying for residence permit in Germany with type D visa,"I am an exchange student in Germany, with a type D visa for the length of the semester (around 5 months), however, I was offered an internship as well as I am applying for an intensive Germany course for the period of 7 months. I went to the Foreigners Office and they told me it is possible to apply for a residence permit if I provide them with a proof from the deutschkurse or the internship, proof of accommodation, and proof of subsistence. However, a friend of mine just came back from the same Foreigners' Office asking for the same thing and they told him that he would have to go back to our country of origin (Egypt) and then reapply for a new visa? I am a little worried now and I would like to know if I can actually get a residence permit in this condition or not? I have to decide soon. "

2276,Are ISAL M-bags (for shipping books abroad from USA) available for individuals?,"I discovered with excitement a post describing ISAL M-bags to ship a large amount of books abroad from the US. However when looking at the USPS documentation indicated in the same post, ISAL M-bags figure in the ""Commercial prices"" rather than the ""retail prices"". So could someone confirm that ISAL M-bags are available for individuals?   The USPS offices I phoned in NYC did not know about these ISAL M-bags, or suggested it was for businesses and not available for individuals, and others said only airmail M-bag were available and ISAL M-bags were discontinued. If ISAL M-bags are indeed available for individuals, does anyone know of a USPS office in NYC which actually knows about this?  Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Update:   In general USPS officers have no clues what ISAL M-bags are exactly, and will give different answers in each different branches (even branch managers) From what I could gather from the multiple different explanations, this service exists in theory, but is not available because of the latest update of the USPS software used in branches  "

Advised by local agents, we applied for my grand mother as dependent member of EEA national as my mom sends money to her every month and visit her in once in a couple of years.  We applied for her 4 times and it got rejected every time with almost similar reasons like you are not financially dependent, etc.  Below is the refusal reason from her latest (fourth) attempt.    We are not sure what to do now. Thinking to appeal this time but not sure if that will be a good choice given we have to pay huge fees to solicitors.   Please advise what next we should try?  UPDATE :  I was advised by one of our relative that I should try to sponsor my grand mother as I am also a Portuguese citizen living in UK. But I recently got visa for my wife on my sponsorship ( Spouse - EEA Family Member).

2278,What papers do I need so I can start working in the UK as fast as possible?,"I recently posted a question regarding the papers I will need to live legally in the UK with my husband, a Polish citizen. I've got pretty good answers that guided me towards the right steps. So I have been reading a lot about the ""registration certificate or residence card as the family member of a European Economic Area (EEA) or Swiss national"" which I think this is my case. However, in the guide to fill out the application, it is mentioned that it is not mandatory to obtain it but it makes thinks easier. Anyway, I am planning to follow the steps and to obtain such paper to make our lives easier.One of the papers I need to send with my application is at least three payslips which will take three months to gather them. It means that I will be there for three months or more without working.   My question is the following: if in the guidance of the  ""registration certificate or residence card as the family member of a European Economic Area (EEA) or Swiss national"" is stated that this is an optional paper, does that mean that I can work as long as I can prove I am married to a EEA citizen? Do you have any idea about this subject? "

A little more background: My situation is ""Can an international Blue Card holder take his non registered partner with him?"" and based on the comments in that question, plus I took some advice from a lawyer it is best for me to marry or get a civil union. Since my situation is a little particular, we intend to marry in Denmark.   Also related to this question is ""Who (not EU citizen) can apply for residence permit/visa from within Germany?"" which has a very good answer and some mentions to my case, but no concrete reference.

I currently operate as a sole proprietor in Canada. One of my clients wants to keep working with me when I move to Austria, as I can work remotely as a software developer. The catch is that he can only pay me if I invoice him as a Canadian company.  I know that I will need to register as ""self-employed"" in Austria, so that I can pay into social security and health care. My main question is: Can I continue to operate my sole proprietorship in Canada? If I maintain a Canadian address, can I just continue to bill him as I have been doing in the past? Will I need to continue charging him GST, even though the work is being performed from outside Canada? What will be my tax obligations to Canada? "

2289,How soon can my future US employer secure a (H1-B?) work visa (for a UK resident)?,"A US start-up is (touchwood) in the process of offering me a job, which would involve relocating to the USA.  It is a highly specialised job (Machine Learning, DSP, Audio engineering, ...).  They wish to start as soon as possible.  As the start-up comprises only three individuals (who are fully stacked with other tasks) I'm trying to help by doing some research on their behalf into the Visa process.  It looks rather thorny. I present my research below.  It appears as though I'm looking for a H1-B non-immigrant Visa, but one source says these are issued in April and generally have run out by September.   At time of writing it is mid-November.  How long should I expect the process to take?  And if it turns out to be long process, would I be able to work from a different country and visit these people for say five days per month? One paragraph in the research below suggests that as long as I keep the total day count below 31 I am not considered a US resident for tax purposes.  LINKED: Working in USA, for a USA company, temporary without a green card?    RESEARCH  [website]Getting a visa to work in the US isn't easy, although it's a lot easier if you have a job that is relocating there or you have an offer of employment. If you want to work in the US you can apply for several types of visa. The H1-B non-immigrant visa is for skilled, educated individuals working for a sponsoring employer in specific occupations such as engineering, maths, medicine or law.  Finally, the green card entitles you to become a permanent resident. You can get a green card through a job or offer of employment, provided there aren't enough US workers who can do the job. If you don't have a job you could take pot luck in the annual green card lottery. Every year, 55,000 win permanent residence through the scheme. In 2010, more than 15 million people applied.  In other good news, you won't need any vaccinations. What tax will you pay? The moment you become a lawful permanent US resident with a green card you are liable to pay tax in the US on your total worldwide income. You will also be considered a US resident for tax purposes if you meet the ""substantial presence test"", which means you are in the US at least 31 days during the current year, and 183 days over the past three years. If you are a non-resident you will only pay US tax on the income you earn locally. There are currently six income tax brackets ranging from 10% to 35%. These are due to rise from the end of the year to between 15% and 39.6%, unless new legislation prevents it. Each state and local government has its own set of tax rules, which complicates matters. Remember, you may pay less tax in the US but there is no NHS, which means you could spend the money you save on private health insurance.    [website]You need to clarify what sort of job it is so that people on the Forum can understand the visa that is being applied for. If it is an H1B visa (because you have a skills that no American has due to a specialism or labor shortage for your job type over here), then the visa can be fast tracked and processed in 15 days. That is the good news. The downside is all the information gathering and form filling that precedes the application. This can be done in days but mine dragged to 3-4 weeks, as letters of support had to be obtained from previous employers etc. There is also a limit to the number of visas, again, if H1B, so they need to get going quickly - the visa process opens in April and is predicted to reach its limit sometime midsummer, though it dragged out to Sept/Oct in previous years due to weakness of the economy. Finally, the H1B visa does not take affect until 1 October, so that would be the earliest that you could begin work on an H1B. Plenty of info online about visa types, info which you can source yourself - start with USCIS. The example I have given is H1B.     [website]It can help if you have an employer willing to sponsor you, but this is extremely rare - unless you manage to find work with a multinational company and transfer to a US branch to gain entry to the country. The L-1 visa is an option for those within companies willing to transfer you to their US operation for up to five years. Employers looking to fill certain skilled positions can apply for H category visas. These include the H-1, for professionals and outstanding individuals, through to the H-2B temporary worker programme for seasonal workers, such as ski instructors. However, these are very limited in number and the application must be made by the employer rather than the individual.    [website]All immigrant categories, except for ‘immediate relatives’ and ‘special immigrants,’ are numerically limited and annual per-country quotas are prescribed by law. This often has the result, particularly in the family-sponsored categories, that the prospective applicant must wait a long time between the filing of the immigrant visa petition and the issuance of an immigrant visa.

2295,Is my UK permanent residence (ILR) at risk?,"I have been living in the UK for more than 10 years and received permanent residence in 2009. Since 2015, I have traveled between the UK and my country of origin and, most of the time, I've been living there instead of in the UK.  One week ago, I re-entered the UK so that I could return to my home country and bring my child with me. Since I only planned to stay in my UK house for one week, I filled in the landing card showing a one-week stay in the UK.  At Heathrow Airport passport control, the officer and I had a conversation as follows:  Officer: ""So you back to the UK?"" Me: ""Yes."" Officer: ""Where did you fly from?"" Me: (I told him from where.) Officer: ""When did you leave the UK last time?"" Me: ""In the middle of August. About 4 months ago."" Officer: ""So you live in your country now?"" Me: ""No. I just stay there temporarily. My family is in the UK.""   Actually, I wanted to explain my situation but it seemed that the officer did not care. He then wrote some comments on the back of the landing card and stamped on it.  To my understanding, as long as I return to the UK regularly, for example, once a year, the Indefinite Leave to Remain should be valid. I checked the latest immigration rules, but that part has changed.  Now I don't know whether it's okay for me to keep returning to the UK every year. I am also quite worried about the officer's comments. Will this affect me on my next return or even my IRL? BTW, the stamp on my passport is same as before. "
2296,Moving to Germany with partner and small child,"I am currently a UK resident and both me and my partner are EU nationals. We have jobs here, but she will soon go on maternity leave. Her limited duration contract will end while she's on maternity leave and it might or might not be renewed (we don't know yet due to unexpected circumstances). She will receive some maternity allowance and also statutory maternity pay (SMP).  We've been thinking about moving to Germany for a while, but are not sure about the timing. On the one hand, the fact that she'll potentially have to look for another job seems to be a good opportunity to move as she wouldn't lose much by leaving the UK now, but having a little child complicates our situation.  The UK Government website says that benefits such as maternity allowance and SMP are transferable to Germany (for UK citizens, but I assume this would apply to us as well), but I am a bit worried about the period after that. First, would the fact that only one of us works while the other is taking care of our child be a problem for our residency permit? Also, it seems that moms of little children who return to work relatively soon after giving birth are frowned upon and places in nurseries and kindergartens are difficult to get, which brings me to my second concern: in your experience, would she be able to return  work after say 12 months of maternity leave? She'd much rather have a job and not rely on benefits, but if that's absolutely not possible, would we be entitled to any kind of financial support from the government?  We won't definitely move until summer at least, but I would like to hear about your opinion/experience whether this is a very bad moment to go to Germany and we should rather wait for our child to be a bit older.  We'd prefer to move to (or close to) a city such as Berlin or Munich which offers more job opportunities and we won't attempt moving unless at least one of us has a job offer there. I am also aware that there might be regional differences in how working moms are perceived.  "

2307,Fastest way for EU member to marry non-resident Chinese national?,"A Chinese citizen moved to the Netherlands some years ago to enter a ""living together"" contract with a Dutch citizen.  After some time, they decided to ""take a break"" due to issues in the relationship, without breaking the contract so that the Chinese can continue to work and to be able to come back in case of change of minds. This happened about 9 months ago.  During the break, 7 months ago, the Chinese met another person (EU citizen, non-Dutch) and now decided to break the contract and start living with the new person (""living together"" contract or marriage, both are open). By breaking the previous contract, the residence permit (specifically dependent on the Dutch citizen) expires and two weeks are given to leave the country. The number of years in the country were insufficient to acquire citizenship. The original 3-month visa is also expired (no visa needed if a residence permit is available).  Denmark is known to require very little documentation for weddings (passport for EU citizens, passport plus valid visa or residence permit of any kind for non-EU citizens) and to be able to arrange ceremonies in as little as 5 days. However, no visa is available in this case, and no residence permit because it was bound to the ""living together"" contract, now broken.  It is my understanding that the Chinese has no options but to go back to China.  From there, however, I understand that getting a visa to Netherlands is very difficult (especially if the country was left after ending a relationship). This is the list of visa types for the Netherlands: [website]Long stay visas are also possible for getting married, but the couple must prove to have lived together for 6 months. In this case that's not possible, since the Chinese was formally engaged in another relationship.  Tourist visa (cannot post direct link, use the previous one to get the specific list) for non-employed Chinese require a letter from the parents or the sponsor (point 19 of the list), but it's not clear whether the future-partner can be a sponsor and whether the explanation letter can explicitly cite the marriage. Point 21 for unemployed unmarried applicants required a copy of the contract of the parents, also not possible in this case (retired parents). It looks therefore that a touristic visa is not possible.  A visa for meeting friends (cannot post direct link, use the previous one to get the specific list) requires an invitation letter (easy, but unclear whether marriage can be explicitly mentioned), a proof of regular income (not possible since unemployed after returning to China), and again same requirements as the touristic visa (points 23, 25).  It looks like the requirements for Danish touristic visa are equivalent.  Doing the opposite and getting married in China may be an even longer trip within the Chinese bureaucracy.  What is the best way to get married? or, how to ease the visa process to get the Chinese in the EU? "

2314,"Offered Position In United States, Don't Quality For Australian E3 Work Visa, What Are My Options?","I have all but been offered a position with an American company for a software development position. However, I have discovered I am ineligible for an E3 Visa (an Australian resident visa for working in the US) because I don't have a degree and I don't have the equivalent 12 years experience either.  The company has said they can hire me on an exclusive contract as an Australian business and then I can fly to and from every 90 days. I know this isn't an ideal solution, so I am asking those here who perhaps might have been in a similar situation or know of someone who has if there are other options I can explore? I would be willing to fly to a neighbouring country or state and entering the US via alternative means if it means there is potentially an easy way or perhaps visa I haven't heard of for coming to the states for a year.  I know there is a H1-B visa where the company can petition the appropriate agency for a visa, but it is more expensive, has limited intake and takes considerably longer, would I qualify for a H1-B visa? From what I could see, it mentioned needing a degree or experience, but I could have perhaps not been reading the correct information. I have about 10 years experience and my industry is quite specialised, the reason they've expressed interest is because of my experience and unique skillset that fits in with what they are looking for and due to competition and lack of decent developers, they're hiring outside of the country.  Reading this on the requirements section actually makes me think I could get a H1-B visa without a degree:     The nature of the specific duties is so specialized and complex that   the knowledge required to perform the duties is usually associated   with the attainment of a bachelor's or higher degree.   But then it says this under the section can I qualify without a bachelors degree:     Having education, specialized training, and/or progressively   responsible experience that is equivalent to the completion of a U.S.   bachelor’s or higher degree in the specialty occupation, and having   recognition of expertise in the specialty. through progressively   responsible positions directly related to the specialty. In general, 3   years of work experience or training in the field is considered as   equivalent to 1 year of college.   If, only temporarily, I were to sign a contract for development services with the US company (employed as contracting services with an Australian company) and then I fly to and from, could I run into any potential issues with this immigration wise? Technically I am also consulting for them and I would be flying over for business purposes which would include meetings, helping makes decisions and steering the development of the product in many aspects, but also developing while I am there.   If I mentioned business purposes and then said I am consulting and whatnot, would it be suspicious I am flying in and out every 3 months or am I overthinking this? Is it possible to be contracted by an overseas company and travel so often for the maximum stay period without rousing suspicion? I don't want to do anything wrong here.  The company is reputable and not trying to be dodgy, they want me and I want to make this a simple process for both the employer and myself. It would be a concrete contract that would be looked over by lawyers and appropriately approved with clear clauses and stipulations. I just need to know what my options are for travelling and working.  Another option is to fly over, but limit the amount of times and duration and work remotely here in Australia for perhaps 50% of the time. They want me onsite because I will be attending a lot of meetings and moving very quickly trying to find the sweet spot for things, and the timezone differences will make that a difficult task.  I understand this is a difficult topic and any answers here would merely be advice and I should seek the opinion of an immigration lawyer. I haven't received a formal offer or anything yet, so I am just preempting my options and seeing what I can do should an offer come through and I accept it. "
2315,Bringing wife to Ireland on a Green Card,"My wife and I are non-EU nationals. I am currently in the process of obtaining a Green Card, and we should be moving to Cork in December. As far as I can understand, my wife can come with me immediately (of course, we both need visas to land in Ireland), and we can apply for familiy reunification then.  My questions are:   What is the exact procedure for family reunification? What sort of documents do we need to submit (e.g. a court-stamped translated copy of our marriage certificate, copy of my Green Card/GNIB, copy of my employment contract)? Is there an application form that can be downloaded and filled out in advance? Is there a fee to be paid? Can we apply somewhere in Cork City, or do we have to go to Dublin (or maybe mail the documents)? What is the usual waiting time? I heard 12 weeks usually, 6-8 if we're lucky. My concern is that her entry visa to Ireland will be stamped for 90 days, and reunification isn't approved in that time frame. I guess she would need to go back home, and wait for approval, and then re-apply for an Irish visa to come back again?  "

2317,Consequences of changing Ukrainian for Russian Citizenship for an Expat living in France,"I am an Ukrainian Citizen married to a French citizen and living in France of a French Residence Permit for as yet limited validity, obtained based on my marriage certificate + Spouse Visa as granted on my Ukrainian passport. I have real estate property and family in Crimea. In principle I must apply for Russian Citzenship before 31/12/14.    Questions:    If I would apply for Russian Citizenship, would this affect my Residence Permit situation in France  If I don't apply for Russian Citizenship in the Crimea, would this expose me to Russian (Criminal) Administrative Charges ? or loss of Crimean Property Rights ?  Would dual -eventual- French and/or Ukrainian/Russian citizenship be a criminal offense in under Russian Law ?  "
2318,Dual Citizenship after N-600?,"I'm a USA citizen applying for permanent residency in Australia. As part of the form I have to say which countries I'm a citizen for, but I don't actually know...  I became a citizen through an N-600 application (my father was naturalised while I was under 18). Before then I had Canadian and South African citizenship. My understanding is that I retain my other citizenships, since I was under 18 at the time and had no say in the matter of receiving my US citizenship. Does anyone know if that is correct? Am I currently a tri-citizen, or did I lose my other citizenships in the N-600 process? "
2319,Shipping Personal Items from Canada to the US,"I initially studied in Canada and will now be shipping my stuff (mainly my clothes) to New York to continue my studies (as a student). I was told that I would have to complete the CBP 3299 form . I have a few questions I hope you can answer:   Under section II, question 10, I selected A(1) and C(1). My question is: Where do I list the personal effects (the clothing) on the form? I could put it under part D of section IV, but under that section, there is no mention of personal effects for non-residents in A, B or C. To make this question possibly clearer for you to understand, under part IV, I selected B(8), meaning that on the next page, I should only list items which pertain to B(8), i.e. household effects. So as I said earlier, where would I list ""clothing""? My second question pertains to the value given for each item I state. If I do list clothing (which are my used clothes and not for sale), what value should I put? The total value of the clothing may be around $300 but I'm not sure if customs sees this, then I would have to pay duties on my clothing. May I please have your suggestions?  "
2320,Access the U.S. version of The Huffington Post,I moved from the U.S. to the U.K.  While in the U.S. I would frequently check the U.S. version of The Huffington Post for news.  Now that I am in the U.K. every time I try to access the U.S. version of that website I am automatically redirected to the U.K. version.  I have tried using different web browsers and different search engines.  Nothing I have tried has worked.  Perhaps The Huffington Post can remotely detect the country I am in and automatically directs me to that country's version of the site.  Or perhaps the website uses a cookie for that purpose?  How can I access the U.S. version without being in the U.S.?

I have a Canadian Bachelor's in Software Engineering and I'm trying to find out what the specifics are for that field in Germany.  The Foreign Office mentions vaguely that the job market is more open to IT professionals (among others) but no specifics. Do I have to get an equivalence? Is the field regulated? Can I work in my field? 
2324,Citizenship Status,"I am a permanent resident. Recently I was doing research about how to get my citizenship.

2325,Rental contract in France can only be terminated at the end of a calendar month?,"I'm renting a furnished apartment in Paris. It's a standard 1 year contract, the ""Kit Meuble - location habitation non saisonniere"" form. Rent is paid by the calendar month (in fact, I had to pay for a whole month, even though I moved in mid-month). I was told that the rental must end at the end of a calendar month, so I must give notice before the end of the previous month, eg. notice before end of Sep to leave by end of Oct. However, the contract doesn't seem to say anything about that. My reading of it is that I can give notice at any time and am only liable to pay rent for one month from that day, eg. I can give notice on 02-Oct and pay rent only until 02-Nov. Which is it? Is there any law or official government statement about that? "

I know I am allowed to live and work in another EU country with my Dutch citizenship, but seeing as I'm currently a new (stay at home) Mum and therefore it's my spouse who is the one that's working - how does that change things? Can I still get residency in another EU country based on my Dutch citizenship even if I'm currently not working? If yes, can my non-EU spouse still join me and get working rights, or do I have to be working myself in order for him to be able to join me and receive working rights? "

But, for the duration of those six months (June 2018 - December 2018) I paid taxes as a full time employee.  Now for the Permanent Residence(Niederlassungserlaubnis)  the requirement is:     21 months with B1 certificate, or 33 months with A1 of German language.

Our case is of type brother or sister (F4). We got immigrant visas and we all (total of 4 people) traveled to the USA on 10th September 2015.  We submitted green card fees after 3 or 4 days, and received an estimate that we would get our green cards in one month or less.  But today, 18th December, it has been more than 3 months, and we still have not received our green cards yet. We inquired about it and they said that they are still in process.  I want to ask some related questions:   How much longer could it take to get our green cards? Some of us have to move back to Pakistan in about 30 days due to some personal reasons. I know a green card expires in 6 months if you stay outside the U.S. How many days would it take if we apply for extensions of our green cards after we receive them? For how long we can get extensions of the green cards? 2 years? or more?  "

Can I sign an employment contract prior to arrival of the EAD card? with a work start date identical to the start date I requested on my OPT application?  The catch here is I am not sure that the EAD card will arrive on time, as USCIS does not guarantee EAD card arrival by the requested date. "
2337,Is there any way that visas can be sent online?,"I applied for a Dutch visa at the Dutch embassy in Sri Lanka, as a non-EU family member joining his spouse in the Netherlands, so they collected my biometric data and visa application form, and they told me that they will send the data to their regional office in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and they will handle the case.

2338,Pending OPT: Employer needs a start date,I am still waiting for my OPT to process and do not expect that my EAD card will arrive until in about 6 weeks.

Can I provide such a date? i.e can USCIS guarantee that I can begin work at a certain predefined date (through EAD or interim EAD for example). Does the interim EAD still exist?

2341,Coping with an emotional shock as a Foreign student in France,"I am in my 1st year of a PhD in France. I can barely communicate in French. I had to visit the administrative office where 1 out of 3 knows English (call her E) and the other two speaks only French (call them F1 and F2). I asked F1 how do I get the train and bus travel card, using by which students can travel in subsidized rates. F1 gave me a form to fill up, I asked her if it is enough for the card (I had to use google translate to make her understand what I was asking for) and she said yes. Then E came and said me this is enough and asked me if I had a travel card. I said no, in fact I doubted the relevance of her question since I came for the exact thing she is asking. Then the following happens.  She said an immediate big NO. It is clear from her body language that she is not in a good mood. I was stunned and said I don't understand. Again a NO with a tone change and a big shake of head, went to her chair, put on her coat, said something in French with an angry NO again. Two of her colleagues came to the room (it was almost lunch time) and said something her in French looking at me. E was clearly angry and I felt like crying. She stormed out with F2. F1 was there, she took out an application by another student showing the copy of the card, she said me I had to apply the card from the railway station and then the university will make authorisation (google translate again). I thanked her and went out deeply shaken. In fact, one other student told me some days back that I had to go to the station for the application but I completely forgot that information at that moment. My adviser told me they were not the right people for my purpose (I didn't told her the whole tense scenario).  I couldn't stop thinking about it. I kept thinking that it may be because I annoyed them with my ignorance in their language and with my lack of time sense (it was almost lunch time). I tried to mentally justify E's actions. I put me in her place and I cannot justify her. I thought of writing her a letter how I felt. I understand that part of it is my mistake, I should have remembered an acquaintance telling me I had to take the form, I completely missed that.  What should have I done? Should I write her a letter saying how I felt and this is not the right way to react? Should I tell my adviser how I felt? May be its just me or my personality thereby making the scenario highly subjective, I feel myself a sensitive person, but I can't get over it. I wish to know if anyone had similar instances and how to deal with it. "
2342,Frequency of short stays in Japan,"For a short stay in Japan (90 days or less) no visa is needed, only proof that the stay will be shorter than 90 days is required.

Note that:   She will know only late Spring whether she will be accepted for this Master (although it feels unlikely to us that she would not be accepted). She will be taking courses online (Khan Academy and EdX) and will eventually work aside (in the department offering the Master degree). We are fiancée (getting married next summer) and we have been together for long enough to be considered ""common-law"" (not exactly sure of the term though).

We have never lived in Canada before coming with our study visa.   To my understanding  To my understanding, she is allowed to work with her visa but only in parallel of her studies. If I am not mistaken, she can changes her field of studies without notice but I am not sure. I have no idea how this particular case should be treated though.  What do you recommend we do?   Must she cancel her current study visa, apply for a new visa for 6 months only and then apply for a new study visa for her Master degree? Must the change of plans be communicated to CIC (Citizenship and Immigration Canada)?  "

I approached a few immigration lawyers/attorneys for advice, they all want a substantial sum for a consultation. I am reluctant to pay a large sum of money when I have no idea of my chances, I don't want to be strung along, plus I'm aware of a lot of scams so it's put me off even more! (how do you know these companies are verified/legit?)  My intention is to immigrate to CA to work/live on a permanent basis, we have no immediate family that can sponsor us (yet), it could be years before my partner's father has his citizenship.   Before anyone says ""just wait a few years"", we don't want to, we are fed up with the UK.   If my only option is to approach this as a 'non-immigrant' and look at temp visa options, what would people recommend? In my position, should someone look to enter the US on a Tourism visa then casually look for work? If you found a job could you even get employed as you aren't a resident, you are basically on a long holiday.   Any advice on this would be great, apologies if I haven't been clear.   Also, if anyone could recommend a legitimate immigration firm to speak with, that would be great. I've read that someone in a similar position approached their local consulate however their advice resulted in them being denied entry so I may avoid this.  "

So I am planning to send my documents to ACS for skills assessment and I am a bit confused regarding the kind of documents that I should send them.  Before going into the types of documents that I am going to send them , I would like to give a brief overview of the education system in Nepal. In Nepal , after completing grade 10 we appear for School Leaving Certificate (S.L.C.) examinations . Upon completing the exams we get a S.L.C marksheet and a character certificate. After grade 10, we normally join a college to complete grade 11 and 12 . After completing grade 12 we get a combined transcript of grade 11 and 12 and also a character certificate (one character certificate for both grade 11 and 12 ). Then in bachelors aswell we get one transcript and a character certificates. Besides these we also get various other certificates.  And I have worked in three companies as a software engineer.  Now I would like to list the documents that I am planning to send over to ACS   S.L.C. : character certificate and marksheet 11 and 12 :character certificate and marksheet Bachelors : character certificate , transcript and certificate indicating the completion of my bachelors that I received in my convocation. My experience letter of Company a My experience letter of Company b My experience letter of Company c.   As per my understanding my documents are of 6 episodes (I am not totally sure) . Is that so ? Also will these documents be enough or do I need to send more documents?  Similarly the next question that I have is can I file one application stating that I want 189 and 190 visa?  Also for 190 is Victoria or NSW good? (As I am a software engineer , I would like to go to such states which has good opportunites for me to work ) Any suggestions "

I am thinking about Express Entry (Skilled Worker), but my score isn't high enough to be drawn any soon. I think it may take a lot of time before I get a VISA.

2359,A very complicated F1 administrative processing issue. What are my chances if I reapply (or apply for any other country's student visa in the future)?,"Greetings from Turkey;  I got a fully funded PhD offer from Illinois Institute of Technology on last April. I applied for an F1 visa to enroll in for Fall 2016 semester. Even though I got an approval on my interview, my application status remained under administrative processing for almost six months. I had to defer my admission twice, regardless of my efforts and the university's efforts to contact the embassy several times, since they were extremely indifferent and unhelpful. I regularly reminded them of my case and received the same generic answer. Also, I contacted an immigration attorney, who reached out the US Department of State and they told him that they will enquire with the US embassy in Turkey and that I should contact them as well. I did that again, and still got the same answer (that I have to wait and wait). Finally I sent them two letters, one from my supervisor who clearly pointed out the focus of his research (that he wasn't making explosives or biological weapons) and why he needs me, and one from the international office of the university. This time, they told me that I shouldn't have sent them those documents, because I wasn't asked to. This made me think that my case was lost or ignored forever.   At the end, I got really upset and sent the embassy a veeeeery long e-mail that contained literal sentences like ""I can't take this anymore"", ""WHAT COULD I HAVE EVER DONE TO DESERVE THIS?"" and ""Even if I get cancer and the only cure is in the US, I will never set foot in your country"" (I wasn't drunk or high). At the end of the e-mail I requested the withdrawal of my application, which they instantly agreed to like they had been waiting for me to give up already. I am not proud of what I did, but what is done cannot be undone.  My supervisor is trying very hard to help me and he is the coolest person on earth. So, I don't want to let this chance slip away. My question is, what would happen if I tried to apply at the same embassy. %100 administrative processing again? refusal for life? Should I apply for this visa at a different country with a valid excuse?   I know that I may never enter the US for my entire life, so I started applying to schools in other countries, but how would this thing affect my chances of getting a student visa from any other country in the future, especially the FVEY countries? I am worried about the fact that some countries have shared intelligence database. Thanks in advance. "
2360,How complete must the translation be for documents showing evidence of a bona fide marriage?,"I am a US citizen who has lived outside the US for many years and I am trying to obtain a green card for my wife, via form I-130 and the IR-1 visa.  We have documents such as apartment contracts, bank and utility statements, etc. showing a ""bona fide"" relationship but almost none are in English.    I know that the USCIS do not require notarized translations or originals, but do they require the translation of the entire document? For example, an apartment lease is very long, and even the first page has hundreds of technical words that are irrelevant to the main claim that we leased an apartment together.  Would a marked-up copy showing our names in English be enough, even if it left the rest in the native language? Similarly for utilities, do I really need to translate the cost per kWH and tips for saving electricity that are written on my electrical bill? "
2361,Will I lose my student Aufenthaltstitel if I take an academic leave for pregnancy?,"I am a Ukrainian citizen currently studying in Germany and I have my Aufenthaltstitel valid till October 2017.  I am taking academic leave for pregnancy for couple of years starting from the next semester in April. However, I have an important journey planned in April to Spain, Germany and Netherlands and I need to use my Aufenthaltstitel for this journey, as the procedure of getting tourist visa in Ukraine is rather unreliable.  The question is: if I take my academic leave from the university, but I don't de-register from my German address and I continue to pay my student medical insurance, will I be able to travel in April with my aufenthaltstitel?  p.s. and will my Aufenthaltstitel will be valid till October if I de-register from the address?  THANK YOU! "
2362,Questions about VAF4A regarding Issuing Authority and visitor stamps,"We are filling in the VAF4A application form for family settlement for a spouse visa.  We came across a question related to past visas for the UK which asks who was the issuing authority.  My wife is Brazilian, so she does not need a visa to enter the UK for up to 6 months as a visitor.  For her visits, does the 6-month stamp count as the visa and, if so, who is the  issuing authority? Would it be border control?  She also had a Tier 4 student visa (to study an MSc.) which was issued in Rio de Janeiro, but it does not state the Issuing Authority on it. Who would be the issuing Authority? "
2363,How can I get my passport back while my application for UK Permanent Residence is under process?,"I submitted an application for UK Permanent Residence as a single EU citizen living and working in UK for more than 5 years. According to Royal Mail tracking, my application has been delivered to Home Office on 19/12/2016. The fee has been deducted from my bank account, so my application is processed. I just didn't receive any confirmation letter from them; shouldn't they have sent it?   My main concern is that I'm due to have a holiday abroad in 27/02/2017 and I would need my passport back as I already bought the plane ticket and I booked the hotel room. Is any chance for my application to be finished by then, or at least to get my passport back?   How can I contact them in order to request my passport back?  I thought they make copies of my proof documents and that they send back the originals within 15-20 days, but one month has already passed and nothing has happened. "
2364,How to obtain a German work permit for a software engineer without educational background,"I'm a web developer at an intermediate level (some experience but not senior) and I'm about to receive a job offer from an employer in Berlin.  For this purpose, I would require a work permit. However, I do not have any university degree or any training certificate as I've learned the skills necessary by myself, which is fairly common in this profession.  I understand that the Blue Card is not for me so I won't be asking about it. However, the employer and I would like to get a sense of the process and whether I could get the work permit based only on my skills and a contract, without any education certificates.  Is this possible? If so, what's the procedure for both employee and employer? "
2365,Exemption for children in the USA: should I get an ITIN or a SSN for them?,"I am a French citizen on a J1 visa in the USA, and recently became a resident alien. As such, I will be taxed. If I read correctly the IRS page, I can claim exemption for my wife and our two kids (all of them being residents as well, and on J2 visas).  But, as they say,     CAUTION: Your spouse and each dependent must have either a Social   Security Number or an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number in   order to be claimed as an exemption or a dependent.   According to this brochure (second paragraph), my wife can't get a SSN because she is not authorized to to work in the US by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). We're going to re-submit a demand for an ITIN.  However, I think that our children are allowed to get an SSN.   Is that correct: can children on a J2 visa ask for an SSN? Is there any advantage to obtain an SSN rather than an ITIN?   Edit / Update: as it turns out, I used the Tax treaty between France and the USA to be completely exempted from taxes, and hence didn't need to claim any exemption. Consequently, there was no need for ITIN for my dependants, since they weren't claimed as exemptions. "
2366,Am I a New Jersey resident for tax purposes?,"For the tax year 2016, am I considered a New Jersey resident?  The answer is in this official document but one point in there is not clear to me.  I am a French citizen who has lived in NJ since September 2015. I am in the US on a 2-year H1-B visa. So I am  currently considered a temporary visitor in the US (not a resident), however I am a resident alien for US tax purposes (according to the substantial presence test).  Now, for New Jersey, whether I am a resident or not depends on the notion of domicile and of permanent home: I am considered a resident if either NJ is my domicile, or it's not my domicile but it's my permanent home (and I spent more than 183 days there in 2016, which is the case).  The official document gives the definitions of domicile and permanent home but I find them somewhat confusing:    They start by saying ""Domicile is the place you consider your permanent home"" (!!) ""A permanent home is a residence that you maintain permanently as your household"". Great.   In spite of the poor wording, after reading the full thing, I believe that NJ is considered neither my domicile nor my permanent home, since I am only here temporarily (for 2 years -maybe 3). But I am not certain because I find the definitions confusing (e.g. I fail to understand the difference between ""domicile"" and ""permanent home"").  Can anyone please confirm my situation? Thank you! "

2371,Would UK visa/entry problems affect getting a visa for other countries?,"Long story short. Unfortunately, I was removed from the UK by the authorities. I understand that there is definitely going to be a ban on me to the UK. Am I liable to get visa from other countries denied on the basis of that ban (such as New Zealand, Canada or the USA)?  My main concern is to find out whether New Zealand would ban me since my fiance is from New Zealand. Is there going to be an issue in getting a NZ visa because of a possible ban from the UK? "
2372,Are town taxes in the Netherlands separate from those deducted from my salary?,"I received a message from the local town (gemeente). It is in Dutch and, although  I've translated it, I didn't understand it entirely. It is related to taxes, and says that I must pay a certain amount of money before the end of February.  I pay my taxes monthly from my salary. What other tax is it referring to? Should I go ahead and pay? The problem is that the amount is odd. It's not very large, so I am sure that it is not the tax that is taken out of my salary check.  Update: I've asked a friend and am told that these are municipal taxes (garbage collecting ... etc.) and it is assessed yearly. "
2373,Migration to Turkey for Iraqis,"I am an Iraqi national and have a bachelor's degree in Information Technology.   What are the migration opportunities and regulations (student visas, work permits) in Turkey as of January 2017 for educated Iraqis currently living abroad? Once living and studying/working there, how many years have to elapse until an Iraqi can be naturalized (acquire the Turkish nationality and passport)? Does the current country of residence dictate one's chances of migrating to Turkey?   Inquiries about visas/permits   Are student visas obtainable after arrival in Turkey, or must they be obtained prior to arrival? Once there, does buying a property in Turkey qualify an Iraqi to obtain a residence permit?  "
2374,Long expired Canadian residence,My Canadian Residence visa was approved a long time ago. I landed and stayed a week.

2375,Documents required to begin employment in Sweden,"For a non-EU national whose application for a permit to live and work in Sweden has just been approved, the subsequent steps are:   visit Migrationsverket (Migration Agency) or a consulate/embassy to be fingerprinted and photographed receive a residence permit card visit Skatteverket (Tax Agency) to apply for an ID card receive ID card   At which point in this process is it possible to formally enter into a contract with one's employer?   I understand that a personnummer (ID number) is required before one can receive a salary, since the personnummer is needed for taxation. Even if this is the case, is it possible, for example, to begin the period of employment while waiting for the permit card or ID card, defer the salary payment until the ID card is issued, whereupon the salary for the period between the initiation of the contract and the issuing of the ID can be properly taxed and paid out in bulk?

2381,How to get paid while being in the US and while waiting for H-1B?,"I'm currently a contractor for a company in the US and I work remotely from Europe. This company is sponsoring me for H-1B.  This year I would like to travel very often to the US under WT status to see my girlfriend. I won't work while in the US, but I'll be using my Paid Time Off. It is my understanding that under WT status I cannot receive any money from a US company while I'm in the US, even if I'm not working.  If I get past the lottery, when my H-1B petition is processed or during the interview, is it possible that the officer could notice that I received money while I was in the US? In other words, what kind of investigation do they perform while checking my petition?  Now suppose that I want to spend February in the US and I'll be back in March. Something that I could do is to ask my company to hold the payments for February and then give me a double wage in March.  According to my understanding, this would be legally permitted, because I would receive money only while in Europe, but one might say that this is like cheating. Is it possible that an officer could interpret this as a cheat? "
2382,How to Reschedule Biometrics appointment for green card?,"While I am still traveling in Europe I received I797 notice to appear for fingerprint appointment the next business day after the upcoming weekend. The letter says, if I don't show up, then my green card case will be considered abandoned.  What are my options to reschedule biometrics appointment (mail, phone, online)?   Initially my immigration attorney told me to reschedule appointment over phone. Unfortunately, I tried to call USCIS at +1(800)375-5283 and they told me that they can't reschedule these appointments over phone, because ""Alexandria office schedules them and they don't have any control"".  Now, I am trying to understand - if I can ask a friend to send rescheduling request over mail ""the proper way"" by sending back the i797 form. However, it is already Friday and appointment is on Monday. If my friend sends it out will USCIS honor the send date even if they may receive letter later after the original appointment time?   P.S. #1 I am solving this case with my immigration attorney in the meantime, but it seems that rescheduling appointments is a corner case that at least my employer's immigration attorneys is not very aware of. So I would like to hear outside opinion.  P.S. #2 In the worst case I am considering to buy ticket tomorrow back  to the US, but that would be hassle I would like to avoid. "

I will need a new visa stamp -- is it hard? I assume it’s not hard in Singapore.  When I re-enter U.S. to work, perhaps 2021, on the new H1b visa stamp, I will probably work for the same employer P, or possibly a different employer. Will I keep my priority date?

How likely is such a person to be imprisoned and subsequently tortured or executed as soon as they are within North Korean borders?  Even if they are granted an ordinary life of an ordinary North Korean, how likely are they to be subsequently imprisoned and tortured or executed for a very petty crime, like not paying enough respect to Kim or failing to meet work efficiency requirements?  Considering the notorious grave human right violations of the North Korean government, even in spite of the latest reduction of the rampant poverty, how does life in North Korea compare to serving a prison sentence in a Western country?  How harsh is the state's control over every day life?  What are the other dangers?  If the defector changes his mind in the future, how likely is he to leave North Korea? How likely is he to be executd on sight, or imprisoned and subsequently tortured or executed anyway for trying? "

Would any of these countries be problematic for a multiple citizenship? "

2399,Does staying in other Schengen countries using working and holiday visa affect the future entry as a visa-free traveler?,"Suppose that you get a working and holiday visa for one year in Poland. Now, if I understand it correctly, you can stay in other Schengen countries for up to 90 days in any 180 days.  However, suppose that you stay in Italy for the whole period. Since you can travel around the Schengen area without any passport check, no one has a chance to stop you.  But eventually you might get caught randomly, for whatever reasons.   In that case, does it affect the future entry to the Schengen countries as a 90/180 visa-free traveler, not with another working and holiday or any residencial visa for any Schengen countries? Also, does it depend on each country and/or an immigrant officer, or is the deny of the entry decided uniformly? "

2408,Can a student upload youtube videos from their home country while on F1 visa?,A student is in the USA on a student F1 visa. While he/she is studying can they make videos and send them to their parents/siblings in their home country so that they(parents/siblings) can upload them on their own channel? This would mean they(parents/siblings) would get paid for those videos from youtube while they are in their home country while the person staying here in USA is making those videos but isnt uploading them from the USA nor uploading them to his own youtube channel? Ofcourse their parents/siblings are liable for taxes in the home country which they will pay.  EDIT: (12/13/2017) What if the visa holder uploads them on youtube and does not monetize them yet? Then when he/she gets greencard or citizen (if); they can choose to do whatever they wish. Because then the visa holder will not be earning any compensation at all for their videos right? 
2409,Standard visitor or fiance visa,"I am an Indonesian citizen and my boyfriend is a British citizen. We got to know each other through an online forum, discovered we have many common interests and ultimately led to his first visit to Indonesia in the middle of 2017.  Now we are planning for me to visit him next March for about 3 to 4 months and after that I will go back to Indonesia with him (we plan to get married in Indonesia).  We both work with enough income and have no financial issue to settle down.   What options are available for my situation regarding visas? If I apply for a standard visitor visa, I understand that I have to convince the ECO that will be back to my country once my proposed visit is done. However, to stay in the UK for a few months, I will have to quit my job. Will the ECO assume I do not have strong ties to my country? If I apply for a fiance visa, does it require us to get married in the UK only? For some reasons, we actually plan to get married in Indonesia and will apply for a UK spouse visa after that.   I have never been to the UK, this will be my first visit and I do not wish to ruin it. "

We are moving to Greece in the near future and have questions regarding health insurance.  We are both covered under my US employer currently.  I am a US citizen.

I noticed only today that a separate interview needs to be scheduled for each family member as per VFS-France-India     Q:13- We are a family of three. How many appointments do I schedule?      One appointment per person has to be scheduled.   Does this mean that I need to provide my mother and father separate ADAs? 
2425,Moving to Germany with fiancée (both EU citizens) because of work reasons. What if she does not find a job?,"Both me and my fiancée are EU citizens (born in Italy, currently living there). So, we have the right to enter/exit Germany without a visa for short periods.  Now, I have the opportunity to relocate to Germany, as I got a job offer there. I know that we would have to register with the police (polizeiliche Anmeldung) right after we move to our new house.   According to many websites (example here), residence permits are not required for EU citizens who wish to reside in Germany. However, I read reports that Germany might expel jobless EU immigrants if they cannot find a job within 3 months. Other sources report 6 months, but that does not change the essence of the issue: both us need to be workers there.  Although I believe that my fiancée will be able to find a job before 3 months (6, ..), I feel obliged to consider all possible situations. Basically, I need to know what should be done in order to never lose my fiancée. I have three related questions:   What happens if my fiancée cannot find a job within the first 3 months? What happens if my fiancée finds a job, but then becomes jobless again after some time (for any reason)? What happens if we marry in Italy before relocating? Would that solve any issue?  "

A few examples I can imagine of possible implications follow, but please don't take this as a complete or exhaustive list.    Can the location affect the marriage process itself, for instance with the obtaining of marriage licenses or other legal requirements? Can the marriage location affect future residency or citizenship, or the process of obtaining such, of the foreign partner? Can the marriage location affect citizenship of future children?     For reference, my specific situation is that I will be getting married to a Guatemalan/Spanish dual-citizen. I am a US citizen (with Mexican residency). We intend to have our wedding ceremony in Guatemala, but we can do the legal marriage anywhere. "
2428,Is a K-1 fiancé(e) visa required to enter United States?,"I'm reading about the K-1 fiancé(e) visa available to foreign nationals planning to marry a US citizen within the US, and am wondering if its required for someone who has other legal means of entering the US?  Specifically, for an EU citizen who can enter the US under the VWP, should a K-1 application still be done?  Or is the K-1 simply for those who have no other legal means to enter the country? "
2429,Moving into Switzerland in a shared house before finding a job,"I am a French citizen, and I plan to move into Switzerland in order to get a job as a software engineer. I already started looking for opportunities; no contract is secured yet.  The situation is a bit specific since I already found a place to live: friends are sharing a rented house and I'll be joining them as a new roommate. I expect to move in by car with my belongings, settle into the house then look for opportunities from there; this is much easier, especially for job interviews.  The B work permit should be secured only when I'll accept a job offer.  In the meantime, I'll have no official status, like a tourist. But I heard that Swiss officials are cautious about new people moving in town: as soon as a new name appears on a mailbox label, some officer may require the newcomer to announce himself to the contrôle de l'habitant within 8 days. It may happen as I may not have the work permit yet.  Other things to do include :   Telling the customs that the stuff I'm bringing in is mine and part of the moving process so that I do not have to pay duty Opening a bank account Exchanging the French driver license for a Swiss one Set up taxes, health insurance, etc. Buy and register a used car (the one I'll drive to move is not mine and will return to France)   What is a good strategy to do all of the above while remaining compliant with the law? Which of these should be done before and after getting the job? "

I am considered a non-domiciled, but resident tax payer in the UK.   My family and I are looking to move to the USA to work for a potential 3 year opportunity.

However, under EU law, can I remain in the UK as his spouse once my visa expires, and can I work as the non-EU spouse of an EU national? Can I file for the EEA permit?

"
2432,"As a digital nomad, is it possible to live such that one owes no tax obligation?","This answer makes an interesting observation that     At the end of the day it's even possible you're not explicitly required to pay taxes anywhere.   Is this really true?  Under what circumstances could one who travels frequently (such as a digital nomad), and therefore never spends a significant* time in one place, not be liable for any tax in a given year?  * I imagine that ""significant"" would often mean the majority of a year (so 183 days), but I realize that varies by jurisdiction. For a general answer, simply assume the subject never stays in one place long enough to be subject to the local jurisdiction's tax policies. "

2434,"Can I emigrate from Norway to stop being tax resident, while still owning a house?","I am a UK citizen who is tax resident in Norway and I own an apartment in Norway. I want to understand if it is possible to leave Norway and stop being tax resident without selling my house (i.e. let it out).  The only information I can find comes from KPMG which says:  ""Termination of residence in Norway for persons with a total stay in Norway not exceeding 10 years happens when the following requirements are fulfilled:   permanent stay in a foreign country stay in Norway must not exceed 61 days within a 12-month period do not have the disposal of a permanent home in Norway""   But this doesn't specify whether 'disposal' means 'owns' or 'uses'. Does anyone have any experience of this situation, or links to credible sources?  EDIT  I found a better reference in KPMG Tax Facts Norway 2014 that says this: ""To be regarded as emigrated from Norway, an individual who has had a combined stay in Norway for less than 10 years must take permanent residency outside of Norway. The taxpayer or his/her closest relatives must not have a residency used as a permanent home at their disposal in Norway or stay for more than 61 days in Norway during the income year.""  When I contacted Skatteetaten (the Norwegian tax authority) by email they said this: ""You will be tax resident as long as you keep your apartment in Norway, if you do not keep it you will not be tax resident in Norway. Persons who have lived in Norway for less than 10 years, will not be tax resident to Norway the first year they move, if they do not own their own apartment in Norway. Regards Skatt Midtnorge.""  Nordisk eTax, a collaboration that includes Skatteetaten, says ""the requirement that you must not have a house/flat at your disposal means that neither you, nor your spouse/cohabitant or your under-aged children can own (directly or indirectly), lease or otherwise be entitled to use a house/flat in Norway.""  The answer still seems vague. "

Would this be considered fraud?

Does this count as detained? Do I need to mention it?  If so, the police where I live provide a ""letter of good conduct"" - is this what I want? The other (and cheaper) service just states ""search for record"", while the I-751 instructions says that the important part is confirming no charges were filed, so I'm not sure which I should be doing here.

I opened a bank account in France and later added my husband to it and made it a joint account, he does not have any other account, that is our sole account.  My husband recently received a letter from our bank asking to fill out a W9 form because he is american. Our jobs are based in France, we're not hired by an american company to work overseas, the companies we work for are French.   We would fill out the form but we're not sure how, or if we need to fill out 2 of them, the puzzling things being:   I read somewhere that the ""main"" account owner needs to fill out the form, but the letter was addressed to my husband.  Also my bank doesn't seem to realize that I'm american as well since  I opened it using a French ID, so I'm guessing the IRS probably wants to know my whereabouts as well. And, this account being in both of our names, how do we need to fill out this form? Do we need to fill out 2 forms?   I guess to sum it up, do we need to file 2 forms, each with our respective information? Or do we need to just file 1 form together, and if so, how?  Thank you for your help, this is a bit stressful and the information for situations like ours is not easy to find and not very clear. "
2456,Permanent resident of the UK?,"I am German but made the move to the UK in January of 1998. For the first two years I lived here as an AuPair, originally planning on returning to Germany. However, I ended up deciding to stay and made the permanent move in January 2000.   I went straight into a Modern Apprenticeship, earning enough money to support myself. I worked full time in 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004 and up until November 2005.   In 2003 I married my (British) husband. Due to his work we moved to Thailand for a period of almost two years. We lived there from 07/12/2005 to 22/11/2007, only returning to the UK for a short visit inbetween. However, we did own our property in the UK which we let whilst away, so I still had ties to this country.   Whilst in Thailand I gave birth to our first child. When we eventually moved back to the UK, I became a stay at home mum, as my husband was earning enough to make this possible. Other than Child Benefit I've never received or applied for any assistance. We had another child and I did not return to work until September 2015.   Now to my questions: Am I right in thinking that the period from 2000 to 2005 qualified me for permanent residency? Would I then have lost that right when we lived in Thailand, or was I just within the time frame to hold on to it?   If I have lost it, should I have had Comprehensive Sickness Insurance during the time I stayed at home with my children? Despite being married to a Brit and having paid NI before moving to Thailand? To be honest, I had never even heard of CSI before last week, when I looked up info about requirements for permanent residency due to Brexit worries.   I guess the main question is, do I currently have or qualify for permanent residency? I am just really confused right now over my status and how the Brexit will affect my family. "
2457,How does a newborn baby get a UK visa?,"I'm on Tier 2 Sponsorship visa living with my wife in the UK since 2011. They don't count my full-time work on Post Study Work Visa, so that I am not eligible for ILR. My wife is now pregnant and she is planning to give birth in our home country.    Is it a straightforward process for my newborn baby to get dependant visa? Does this happen through the usual dependant application in my home country by applying at the UK Embassy? Can my wife, as a dependant, leave the UK for more than 90 days and not have problems when applying for ILR (when they count days)? I thought this rule applies to main applicants only, i.e. myself. Can my wife leave the UK, for instance, for 6 consecutive months, then return to the UK and, when it is time, apply for ILR? Will my grandchildren have to go through same immigration process as I do now because my child (their parent) will be born outside of the UK?  "

2459,Quitting a job after signing the contract in Germany,"I have completed my Master's in Germany. I have got an offer from a company, which I should accept within 5 days. There is positive feedback from another company, but no offer has been made yet and it is unlikely that one will be made within 5 days time.  The contract I have now says that there will be a probation period of 6 months and if I decide to quit in the first month of joining, the notice period is only 2 weeks.  I would like to sign the contract and accept the offer. However, is there a possibility to quit without having personally gone to the office on the first working day? The contract does not explicity state what happens if I am a no-show.  More importantly, does this 2 week notice period commence from the date of entry or from the date of signing the contract?  Just further information, the starting date mentioned in the received contract is two months from the date of signing the contract.  If it matters, the job applicant is a non-EU citizen. "
2460,German internship visa to job visa conversion,I applied for a German internship visa recently and the process is in its final stages.

2461,Applying for critical skills visa to South Africa after being declared undesirable for 12 months in 2014,"I was previously declared undesirable in South Africa for a period of 12 months from June 2014 to June 2015. For background, I overstayed my visa by 12 hours 4 days after the visa laws changed in 2014. I didn't appeal because I would be studying back in the USA for 12 months and was given legal advice that I did not need to spend up to 36 months and hundreds of dollars appealing it if I did not want to return to South Africa during the period for which I was banned.  Flash forward to 2017. I have gotten a job back in South Africa and qualify for a Critical Skills visa. I have completed all necessary paperwork, spent dozens of hours and hundreds of dollars gathering paperwork and called several embassies in the US to confirm that my prior ""undesirable"" status would not be an issue for this current application. All embassies confirmed that since the ban on entry was for 12 months and expired in 2015, I would be fine with my current visa application. Confirmed this 2 months ago with DC, Chicago and New York.  I arrived yesterday in DC to submit my critical skills visa application. Only then did the consulate decide that I needed an additional letter from DHA confirming that my undesirable status was no longer in effect. I have contacted DHA overstay appeals office, but I am concerned that since my overstay was so long ago that they will not write the letter I now apparently need. SA consulate in DC seemed to think that if I was once declared undesirable, no matter for how long, then I was always ""undesirable"" without a letter from DHA even after the 12 month period listed on my paperwork had passed.  Will my critical skills visa application be fine without this letter? Am I really considered ""undesirable"" forever without a DHA letter despite the fact that all of my paperwork says 12 months? "
2462,My passport not stamped when I left the U.S. How can I reenter?,"I'm an F-1 student in the U.S.  On Dec 28th last year, I left the U.S. temporarily for Japan, where I am a national.  Something was strange with the airport through which I flew out of the U.S.  For one thing, there was no officials there to stamp my passport.  Apparently this made me look suspicious to a custom official at the Japanese airport, who checked my baggage, something that does not happen always.  I am returning back to the U.S. very soon and I am expecting a similar hiccup at the U.S. airport (by the way, I am returning to the same airport).  How can I minimize the possible damage?  Is there something I should prepare?  Is there something that I should avoid?  (For example, I carry my pillow around when I travel, and I do not want it to be ripped by officials to check the contents.  I also carry similar childish items usually and I do not want to be embarrassed.) "
2463,"Income tax question, I have a possible job based in Malta but working 55%+ worldwide","I understand their is another question on this subject but mine is more specific.  Currently a resident in the Netherland and considering the possibility of emigrating to Malta for a job opportunity, where I will not be in the country for the required 183 days.  For non Maltese residents, in order to obtain tax residency in Malta, one needs to reside in Malta for a period of 183 days in a calendar year. Until this period elapses, the applicable rates of tax for non-residents.  But 1. Under Maltese General Tax Law Non Maltese-domiciled EU Nationals have the right to reside in Malta and are entitled to a very favourable tax treatment: - Capital and overseas capital gains can be remitted tax-free. So if you can live off capital, you pay no tax.  So if my Maltese employer pays my salary into an offshore bank account say in the Netherlands where I'm then no longer a resident, could I be double taxed because my resident will default to the Netherlands and in Malta because I'm a non-residents? Or could I be exempt from tax in Malta and be taxed in the Netherland?  I'm looking for some clarity on subject! "

2465,Putting my 14-year-old son in school when moving to to Amesterdam from Sweden,"My family is hoping to relocate to Amsterdam, The Netherlands, by this summer. We currently live in Stockholm, Sweden. We are planning on registering our son, who will be 14 and entering 9th grade in the fall, in a public school (possibly international). I have the following questions and would appreciate any perspective or advice.   How do I register him for public school? I am concerned about the timing and about having the right paperwork. How is the ""mentality""/teaching style of the public education in Amsterdam as compared to the US and/or Sweden? We are originally from Seattle, WA. I was raised in France and I am concerned that Amsterdam may be too strict and demanding for my son. To clarify, the education in the United States (or at least in the school districts my son has attended) tend to follow the lots of content-lots of homework framework and the teachers tend to be in over their heads with both the curriculum and the class sizes. They do not have the time to assist the kids that fall behind, making it easy for the children to get lost in the subject matter. Furthermore, teachers tend to be very passive-aggressive with very strict student-teacher relationships and the fear of always being politically-correct makes communication awkward and often humor has little to no place in the classroom by fear of offending someone. The teaching method in the States tends to be teacher-centered where the teacher is in front of the class and presents the lesson to the class, and the students are to ""play around"" with the subject content on their own time.  Education in Sweden is quite different. It seems that a lot of the school work is handled at school with very little homework given. A lot of the teachers use humor and a very open-ended method of teaching, where children are encouraged to express their opinions and where the students have an almost friend-to-friend relationship with their teachers. Problem-solving skills, creativity, group work, and communication between students seem to be pillars of the education here. The teachers tend to be more moderators and tutors in the classroom than anything else. The kids are encouraged to find the information on their own and to come up with the answer on their own, the teachers being there mostly for guidance and additional explanation that could be necessary. France's education methods tend to be a lot more in line with the States' methods but with teachers being a lot more strict and creativity being perceived as a ""bad thing"". All this is, of course, my take on it. I would be interested to hear what a typical teaching approach or a typical workload is for a middle school class in Amsterdam. Any additional advice or suggestion would be greatly appreciated. I've read quite a few expat blogs on this subject, however I haven't quite found what I'm looking for yet (most info seems to be for younger children).   Thank you very much! - Christel "
2466,US citizen looking to visit UK for 1 year,"I am a US citizen employed at a company that is very flexible with working remotely. My girlfriend is a UK citizen and I want to live with her while continuing to work for my American employer in the UK for 1 year, and I intend to move back to the USA at the end of the visit.   My current understanding is that I can visit the UK for up to 6 months out of the year. Is that correct? Is there any other way to extend the stay up to a year?  If it is not possible to extend my stay up to 6 months, would it be possible to stay for 6 months, go back to the USA for a week or two, and then go back to the UK?

2467,How to be sure a medical appointment will be fully covered by a health insurance in the United States?,"I have recently moved in the United States, and I have a health insurance through my local employer. How to be sure a medical appointment will be fully covered by my health insurance in the United States? (or at least that I will only have to pay a fixed copayment.)  Here are the options I have considered:   if I call the health insurance's customer service prior to my appointment, neither I nor the customer service can guess in advance the diagnosis and procedure codes the physician will bill me for.  if I call the physician prior to my appointment, they cannot guess in advance diagnosis and procedure codes they will bill me, because it depends on what will happen during the appointment. the health insurance refuses to provide a listing of procedure and diagnosis codes that are covered upon request. asking the physician whether the appointment is covered is pointless as nothing legally bound the physician to be correct regarding insurance coverage, and he may simply say he does not know.   None of these options work. What shall I do? Bills can be pretty expensive in this country, even a simple medical appointment may be bill for ~500 USD.    Answering mkennedy's comment: I can check (and I do check) whether the physician is in-network prior to the appointment. But even an in-network physician may result in an uncovered appointment (first-hand experience). Co-workers do share some information, but of course nothing legally binding and information is partial, so it's really not enough. Also it's not so great for patients' privacy. HRs refer me to the insurance's customer service "
2468,Change Of Visa Status From J1 to F1: No Reply From USCIS and About To Miss Semester Start Dates,Here is my situation: I have applied for a change of status from a J1 visa to F1. My university start dates is this Tuesday and I still have not heard back from USCIS. I have spoken to both my home university and university in the U.S. and they are both happy to transfer me to fall semester.  My questions is what do I do? If my COS is eventually approved do I still have to go back to Australia now that my semester start date is well over 5 months away and start a new visa application or do I just give USCIS my new I-20? Should I even bother waiting for a reply now that it is too late or if I leave the US and abandon my application will this reflect badly when I go home to apply for F1 again? Is it likely my application will now be denied anyway because I have missed the semester start date?  Please if anyone can help with even a little bit of information it would be great! I am so worried and confused about what to do not to mention upset I will miss start date. I have called to find information but the officers aren't very helpful.

2481,"PPACA ""no insurance"" fee for American expats living abroad","I searched and commented on another question here, and was prompted to ask my own question separately.  As you may be aware, US citizens without health insurance, as of this coming Sunday 31st January, are liable for the individual shared responsibility payment, described here.  I am aware that there are ways around this for expats, listed as such:     The Affordable Care Act will impact US taxpayers for the first time in   fiscal year 2014, for which US income tax returns are filed in 2015.   Americans living overseas should be aware of the important need to   attach a completed Form 8965 (new) to their 1040. Form 8965 allows you   to describe your status as an overseas resident, which indicates to   the IRS that you benefit from ""deemed covered"" status by a foreign   health plan and do not need to participate in a US plan. If you do not   attach Form 8965, you may be subject to the $600 penalty for not   having US health coverage.      US citizens living abroad are subject to the individual ""shared   responsibility"" provision under the Affordable Care Act. However, US   citizens who are NOT physically present in the United States for at   least 330 full days within a 12-month period are treated as having   ""minimum essential coverage"" for that 12-month period regardless of   whether they enroll in any healthcare coverage.      In addtion, US citizens who are bona fide residents of a foreign   country for an entire taxble year are treated as having minimum   essential coverage for that year. (In general, these individuals   qualify for the foreign earned income exclusion under Section 911.)      Individuals may qualify for this rule even if they cannot use the   Section 911 exclusion for all of their foreign earned income because,   for example, they are employees of the United States Government.   Individulas who qualify for this rule need take no further action to   comply with the individual share responasibility provision during the   months when they qualify. They will report their status with their   federal income tax return on Form 8965.      US citizens who do not meet the foreign physical presence or foreign   residency requirements must have essential coverage, or qualify for a   coverage exemption, or make an individual shared responsibility   payment when they file their federal income tax returns. Note that   ""minimum essential coverage"" includes a group health plan provided by   an overseas employer.   My situation:   Given that I visited family in the US twice this year (Christmas and briefly during summer), if those visits were in excess of 30 days (I'm not sure, have to check), does that mean I have to pay this fee? I am not a permanent resident in my current country of residence, but I am a legal, tax-paying resident as of 3 months in this country and 5 years in the last and I am legally entitled to remain here in excess of one year (3 to be specific). I have been living outside the US for 5 years; I was on a student visa in the UK for the first 5 years, and I moved to France directly from the UK in October, where I am on a scientist visa for the next three years, which is liable to extension. Three years ago, it is possible that I spent 30 days in the US (the longest was 1.5 months in a summer 3 years ago) because I was doing temp work for a US company (I paid income tax on this). Since then, I've only been home for a maximum of two weeks, although I need to check my plane tickets and verify this. I am earning income in France and will be filing a tax return to this end. Before this October, I earned no income as I was a student.   My Questions:  Do I have to pay this fee or purchase health insurance in the US? I have no reason to do this outside of legal obligation. I am recieving excellent health care in France, and I am legally entitled to bringing my prescription medication home with me for short visits, so I have had no need to see a doctor in America for the past 5 years. If I need to do this, what do I need to do by tomorrow?  If I am eligible for the exemption, how do I prove this? Do I have to do anything in particular before the deadline tomorrow?  As a further complication: I do not have a carte vitale (medical green card) in France yet, but since the process takes several  months, I am allowed to see a doctor here, paying out of pocket, and I am reimbursed later. So I don't actually have proof of my health coverage in France yet, as it is dependent on receiving a social security number -- which takes an extremely long time to get, because France. However I have verified that my right to health coverage began on the first day of my contract in France. Is this going to affect my eligibility? I can imagine many US expats on temporary contracts abroad may run into a similar issue.  Is ""per year"" in reference to fiscal/tax year or calendar year?  If I stay in the US for more than 30 days in a given year (e.g. family emergency) am I obligated to hold US health insurance?  Thanks in advance, and I hope other expats also find this useful. "
2482,Can a US Citizen (married to a German) work remotely for a US company and stay on US payroll/benefits and not be an expat?,"I am an American and my boyfriend is German.

I have a NOC class A 2175 job and I am planning to apply for permanent residence. My employer has already filed a pre-screen application under the International Student with a job offer category under OINP in January. The processing time for this application is 90 days. After the approval of this, I have to apply for a Nominee application, the processing time for which is 90 days again which will give me 600 points in my Express Entry profile.   I got married in January. My wife is in India and I want to get her in Canada as soon as possible.   Basically I can think of couple of options:  (1) File my Nominee application as married and wait to get the permanent residence under Express Entry which will take me at least 8 months.   (2) Apply for a work permit for my wife as my dependent. Somebody suggested that this process is quick and generally takes only a month. However I could not find a proper link on CIC to do so.  What is the procedure for this?  What are the requirements?   Do I have to show any balance in my bank account?  Does she need to give IELTS or similar exam before coming here?  A link explaining all of this would be really great.  (3) Any other option that I am not aware of.  UPDATE 1 I have tried calling CIC inquiring this and I have asked a couple questions regarding this. When asked they sent me a generic email dumping all the information in it but not giving answers to my specific questions, so my question still remains the same.  UPDATE 2 I have tried talking to CIC customer service again today to apply for a spousal work permit making my wife as my dependent. Upon talking to them, I told them I had opened up a MyCIC account under my wife's name and that the application showed that I had to upload the IMM1295 but it isn't asking for any information regarding my job which isn't right because the work permit is dependent on the type of job I have. Upon asking CIC customer service representative about the details about where do I need to provide the information about my job and other info, I was told you have to submit it as optional documents with the application which doesn't seem right as these are the most important documents required for this application. I am really hoping I get some help here because other sources are not being helpful right now. "

(My experience of discomfort/discrimination in the UK is primarily suspicious looks, the ladies I've worked with have all been fine with it or enthusiastic to have a man for the children)  Will there be more resistance/discomfort with a man? From staff? Parents?   Would that be more implicit or explicit?  Would I be protected by any discrimination laws differently from the UK?  Does anyone have experience with their own children in the USA? "
2486,Can I renew chinese passport if I renounce US citizenship?,"I have a US citizenship.  My Chinese passport will expire in two years.  I know dual citizenship won't work.  I'm considering renouncing my US citizenship in order to renew my Chinese passport.  Will China regard me as a non-citizen even if I give up my US citizenship, therefore not renewing my passport?  Bottomline question: was it game over as far as my Chinese citizenship goes the moment I became a US citizen?  Will giving up US citizenship help nothing in Chinese government's eyes? "
2487,What happens if my second year visa gets refused while I am in New Zealand and have no money for a flight out of the country?,"I am currently waiting on my partner to receive his next visa, my first year working holiday visa for New Zealand will be up in march, when he receives his I am going to apply for a de facto visa/partnership visa but what happens if it gets refused and I have no savings for a flight back to my country ?     We have spoken to an immigration agent who told me not to apply for my visa until my partner receives his, so we are still currently waiting, his is still being processed so fingers crossed it will be any day now.    I am just worried that mine will be refused and I have no savings to afford a flight out of here, can anyone suggest what to do if this does happen?  "
2488,"Are there countries that allow a foreigner to change their name through their laws while in that country, without PR Status?","Are there countries, in which, a visiting foreigner under some kind of visa, is able to change their name, through that country's laws (and not the laws of their country of origin)? Or is this available only to permanent residents? It can be a new name just to use while being in that country. Like issuing a certificate of a temporary alternative name. I guess the passport name won't change because it's issued by the home country.  "
2489,Why does birth-tourism tend to target the US more than it does Canada?,"Birth-tourism is an act of travelling to another country to give birth there in order for your newborn child to become a citizen of that country. This is a consequence of something called ""jus soli"". Both the US and Canada do unconditionally grant citizenship to anyone born on their soil (except when they don't, such as for children of foreign diplomats).  However, every time I hear about a real life example of this happening, those mothers tend to target the US, but not Canada. But why is that so?   Isn't Canada also a pretty good nation? Besides, the US does have its downsides when compared to Canada, such as taxing its citizens worldwide, regardless of their country of residence (which may become a problem for the child later in life). "
2490,"About to apply for a US visa? Can I get an expedited/emergency interview appointment before ""First Available Appointment"" if I have an emergency?","I have submitted a DS-160 form and I'm now applying for appointment. I am on the payment page and I'm about to pay the $160 fee. A box on the left side of the page says ""First Available Appointment Is Monday January 22, 2018.""  However, I need to get to the US before January 22, and I have document evidence to prove this (I'm applying for an F1 visa and college term begins January 23rd). I am certain that an urgent appointment will be needed. Can I appeal/ask for an appointment before this January 22 date?  Can you please tell me the procedure for emergency/urgent appointment process?  Thank you. "
2491,Does entering by a student visa and not attending the school cause the future ban of the entry in China?,"If you attend a short-term language program in China (usually about 16 to 18 weeks), you apply for a student visa, which is valid for 6 months.  However, many universities let you pay the tuition fee only after you arrive in China. The application costs about 400 RMB, but it's still way cheaper than the tuition fee (about 6,000 to 13,000 RMB).  Now, I consider applying for the program and then not attend the university course, which means I do NOT pay the tuition fee.  My question:   Does this break the law and/or cause any potential side-effect, such as a future ban on entry? How about if I pay the tuition but don't attend the program?   The reason is the student visa is incredibly attractive to travel around China for longer periods, since the tourism visa covers (generally) only up to 30 days. "
2492,Administrative review - extra documents,"My tier 4 visa has been refused as I did not show documents for funds. I forgot to enclose my bank statements in the application, however I do have the sufficient funds. Can I apply for an administrative review in this case and submit the bank statements?  If no, and I have to make a new application, should a new CAS be generated? The existing CAS would not work for the new application, right? "
2493,Tier-4 extension in the UK - Can I apply for premium service without passport?,"I had applied for extending my tier 4 visa but failed to submit my bank statements. I do have the required funds for the required period, but my mistake was in not submitting the documents the first time around.   I have a new CAS from the university now, and I wish to reapply. However my passport has not been returned to me. To overcome all waiting hassles, I wish to apply through the premium service. Can I book the premium service without the passport? Or should I try to get the passport from the Home Office before reapplying? "
2494,Since and until when can I stay in China using a student visa?,"Suppose that you apply for a language program that lasts from 2018-03-10 to 2018-07-20. You are going to apply for the student visa (X2) to stay during the period.  However, I'm sure the legal stay does not start in 2018-03-10 and end in 2018-07-20. It is more like 2018-03-03 and 2018-07-27, or even longer period is allowed.  So after getting the visa, when can I start to enter in China and stay there? And until when must I leave China?  Or since the X2 visa is for people who study there within 180 days, can I decide any 180 days frame as far as it covers the language course? "
2495,Tier 2 ICT dependent visa for the new born baby in UK,"I am looking for a clarification in regards to visa (Tier 2 ICT dependent visa) for our baby.  Please note that I hold an Indian passport and currently working on Tier 2 ICT visa in UK (which is valid till Jan 2020). We are expecting our baby in Feb 2018. Hence this query is regarding visa for the new born baby.   As I have understood, we need to apply for the baby's Indian passport which is clear for me.   We are planning for a trip to India after obtaining Indian passport for the baby. However I am looking for clarifications for below queries please?   Is it mandatory to apply for visa for baby to travel from UK to India on a short trip ? Can we apply for baby's visa after reaching India as my wife and baby are intended to stay in India for about 6 months before flying back to UK.    Thanks in advance for your response.  "
2496,"In Amsterdam, what kind of public workspaces are open on the last week of the year?","I'm from a non-Christian non-European country, and I don't exactly have a good idea of what would be closed and what would be open on the last week of the year here in the Netherlands (and Amsterdam particularly): My workplace is closed, with everyone on vacation for the entire week.  Now, I would like to possibly go somewhere where I could sit down, use a computer, have a desk to write on etc. I was thinking of something like a public library, or perhaps some university building with these kinds of stations. Would these kinds of places be open?  A less-desirable alternative would be some cafe, but those are usually not so well-lit on the inside. But perhaps there are other kinds of publicly-accessible spaces that could do, and are open? "
2497,Freelancing in Germany when earning only little income,"I plan to move to Germany with my spouse soon, and I will be employed full time. We do not speak the language, therefore it would be quite difficult for my spouse to find work.  My spouse would like to do some occasional minor creative work to earn a bit of extra income, if possible. We calculated that this would maybe bring in €500 in an active month, but do not want to commit to doing it regularly.  I am now trying to research how to do this legally, and read up on freelancing in Germany on websites like this one.  I learned that if my spouse registers as a freelancer, they won't be able to use my health insurance anymore.  They will need to purchase their own, which involves a monthly fee of at least €350 if choosing public insurance. There are additional taxes on top of this.  If this is really so, registering as a freelancer may cost as much, or even more than the small income my spouse expects to generate.  (Consider that there may be months with little or no business, but the health insurance still needs to be paid.)  Question: Is there a legal solution that is appropriate for our situation?  We are looking for a way to do only occasional work (perhaps there would be no work at all in some months) without a major commitment (such as a monthly health insurance payment which may end up costing more than what my spouse earns)?  We have no experience with this even in other countries, so I am not even certain that the term I should be searching for is ""freelancing"".  I am not looking for a full explanation about how to proceed.  I am simply trying to understand what is possible, and what may be worth it, so I know in which direction I should be doing more research. "
2498,Effect of marital status change on study visa in Australia,"I was married to an Australian citizen and after around a year we divorced. My marital status on passport and ID card is still single as it was not updated. Now I want to apply for a study visa in Australia. The student visa application form asks for marital status as Married, Never married/single, Divorced, Separated and more.    What should I mention there? Should I tick mark ""Single/NeverMarried"" (as I am single in the records and on my documents) or should I tick ""Divorced""?  I don't know whether I am right or not but I think that if I mention divorced then they may refuse my visa as I was married to an Australian citizen.  Please advise.  Thanks. "
2499,"European in USA for 6 years, but with NO credit history in the USA. What's the procedure to follow?","I have been reading multiple posts but I cannot find a comprehensive answer to my questions. I am European and I have lived in the USA for about 6 years in the last 9 years. I never had a credit card, only debit. Never bought a car (I do not want one, I bike) or asked for a loan or mortgage. I always payed my rent and utility bills on time. I saved a good bunch of money during these years, but I need a loan to buy my dream house.  I called TransUnion and they said I have no credit history whatsoever (I could not pull up a credit report on AnnualCreditreport.com). My questions are:   I need to build my credit history. Should I get a secured credit card or should I get a basic unsecured one, such as an unsecured Capital One Platinum, which from  what I read here is given also to people with no credit score? What is the maximum monthly spending limit I should ask on my secured credit What? Which is the optimum value? I have a bunch of money saved, should I deposit 40k and set a 40k limit? This answer says the higher the better. Is it true? Or is there an optimum for getting credit scores? Given that maximum limit, how much of it should I spend every month to maximize credit scores? I understand less than 30%, but what is best? 3%? 25%? When is the best moment to pay off my credit? Should I pay it in full? This point has NEVER been mentioned anywhere: I am super busy. There is no way I am going to check every month how much I owe and manually pay it off. Is there any way to set an auto-pay? And when is the day I should pay off? Right before the deadline? How many days before? I do not really understand point 7 here. What does this mean: You should keep the reported balance below 30% of the credit limit on your card. This seems to contradict with (still on the point 7 there) try to make a payment before the billing cycle ends because the bank will report the balance to the credit bureaus. If I have made a payment, doesn't the balance go to zero? How can it be 30%? I guess the things above apply only for secured credit cards, right? As for unsecured, what does still hold?   Thank you.

2501,H4 visa interview India: new I 797 but old stamp on passport,"I will be appearing for my H4 visa interview soon. My husband has had a H1-B transfer when he moved to a new job. His passport however still has the old stamp referring to his previous employer and the dates as applicable to the old H1-B.  Would my husband have to get his visa stamp renewed before I appear for the interview?  Note that I have all the documents from his new job i.e I 797, the I-129, employment verification, paystubs, W2.  Also, my husband had asked the immigration team and they said he did not have to get it restamped.  But I am a bit skeptical whether someone at the embassy might say something, like why does the passport not have the new stamp?  Please advise. "
2502,Schengen visa for internship,"I want to do an internship at an engineering company in Munich. As the duration of my stay is less than 90 days, I was told that I must apply for a uniform short-stay Schengen visa. But what should I choose in the form, as my main purpose of journey? (it includes Visit, Study, Business, Other, ...)  Because even though it is an internship, I am not sure if it counts as study, because it is not done as part of my formal coursework, and it is not done in a university (but an engineering corporation). Also it is a paid internship (in the 1000-2000 euros monthly bracket).  Should I choose Other and then state that my reason is internship? Or Study? Or Business? "

2505,Can you use a rental car/car share to pass the road test for a Canadian driving license?,"The page on converting your foreign license to a Canadian one says:     Step 2: With two years' of non-learner driving experience, you'll need to take the Class 5 road test.    Is it possible for me to use a rental car/car share such as Zipcar to pass the test? Or do they want to see the owner of the car before taking you for a spin? "
2506,How often can I repeat the road test in British Columbia?,Foreign drivers who want to convert their license to a Canadian one must pass the Class 5 road test before they're issued a Canadian driving license. But the linked page fails to mention how often one can repeat that test - can I go in every single day until I get it right? Or is there a limit of some sort? 
2507,Is it possible to get a work permit/visa while staying as a tourist in Kosovo?,"I'm from istanbul,Turkey and I want out. I don't think I can live here anymore and would like to move to Prizren,Kosovo. Why Prizren? Because people there speak Turkish, its quiet and its affordable for me. Anyway, I want to live a simpler life and don't want to be a bigshot in companies. Just want to be some chef or waiter in a restaurant. It seems possible that they hire a Turkish in Prizren.  Kosovo gives 90 day stay permit without a visa.  So my question is:  If I get an invitation from an agency and enter the country as a tourist (on paper) and look for a job, then find a job, Will this job get me a work permit? Is it legal to do this?  the other alternative is to get an invitation from a business before moving to Kosovo, but how do I get an invitation from a restaurant owner in Prizren right now? seems very hard.  my source : [website]"

2512,Swiss stay > 3 months for Australian,"I am planning to move to Switzerland to stay with my partner start of next year, and am trying to identify ways to stay for longer than 3 months. I have Australian citizenship and am under 30. I was initially hopeful that I could get a student visa and study German, but have since been told (by a school, potentially biased) that these are only issued for 'high intensity' study of at least a year, amounting to ~10k CHF or so and a large portion of free time. I've also considered getting one of the ""working holiday"" visas issued by other Schengen countries, but I gather that these aren't valid for leaving the country of issue?   I have a bachelors and a good deal of experience doing software dev work, and suppose trying to get a job offer and associated visa is an option.   Is there anything else I could try that I've missed? I'm still not confident about the requirements for the student visas, and can't really ascertain whether there exists a way to get an ""extended tourism"" visa or similar.  "
2513,Getting UK driving licence after moving to Germany,"I'm an EU national who has lived in UK for more that 5 years (enough to be a resident, but not a citizen). I have moved to Germany a month ago and started a new job. A couple of months before moving to Germany I tried to pass my practical driving test and failed and had no time to take it again. In principle I could still go back to UK for a couple of days and retake the test and (if passed) have the licence posted to my old address, from where my friend could send it to me.  My question are:   Is this legal according to German law? Would it be possible for me to exchange this driving licence to a German one after some time?   If I wanted to drive in Germany I would need to exchange a foreign licence to German one, which would include sending them my German registration form which clearly states that at the time my driving licence was issued I was already registered in Germany for a month. If I wanted to take a German driving test I would need to go through the theory and driving lessons again, which would be much more costly and difficult, therefore I do not want to do this.  "

I understand that when my civil status changes (when I get married), I have 90 days to inform the Mexican government.  However, I won't be getting married in Mexico, and we're planning to travel immediately after the wedding--hopefully in Europe.  What are the consequences if I don't inform them of the change quickly enough? Will I lose my residency status, or pay a fine, or what? "

What document should I ask to see? Some countries have a register of property ownership that anyone can search online for a small fee, but that doesn't seem to be the case in France.  The standard rental contract says this at the bottom of page 1:     et déclaré avoir reçu du bailleur un justificatif de sa qualité de   propriétaire (relevé cadastral, facture EDF ou autres)   But I could not find what this ""relevé cadastral"" is. I know what an EDF bill is, but I don't see how it proves ownership - I've had those as tenant. "
2517,Having a child in Italy without medical coverage,"I just recently received an offer to work at the UN in Rome, and I would really like to move my family over there (we're currently in the US, and are US citizens).  However, my wife is 5 months pregnant, and I found out that she will not be covered by my medical insurance.  Are there options for purchasing medical insurance?  Are the costs typically pretty reasonable?  Or, if medical insurance is not possible, what would be the costs (rough estimate) of having a child in Rome? "
2518,Moving to Sweden – social security for my wife?,"I am currently applying for a job in Sweden and if I should get hired, me and my wife (both German citizens) will move there. As far as I understand, as I have a job there I can apply for a Swedish personal number and will therefore be within the Swedish social security system.  But what about my wife? She will quite surely not immediately have a job when we will move there, but under which prerequisites can she join the Swedish social security and are there any benefits she can receive in the first time without having had a job there? "
2519,Contract work for US company based in Germany,"I want to work as a contractor for a US based company and I'm legal resident of Germany with the right for self-employment “selbständige tätigkeit gestattet”.   The german rules seem to say that if you are a freelancer, you must have more than 1 client and you can't earn more than 80% of your income from the same client. (sources – [1], [2])  However, there are plenty of projects that can last 6 or 12 months and that will pay normal monthly salary – so there wouldn't be any need to work for another client.  Did I get the rules right? Is there a way around this limitation? Would registering as “trader” possibly help? If so, what are the implications?

2520,Selective Service Requirements,"I'm currently a green card holder who originally entered the US on a student visa, married an American and got a green card. I'm now looking to get citizenship, but I'm in a bit of a bind about the selective service requirements.   When I got my green card (in 2002) I had just turned 26 the previous October. I believe that when I first started the application for my green card, I must have been 25 (I was 25 when I got married) and I registered for selective service. However, the selective service has no record of me registering, but I must have done or it would have been an issue applying for a green card (and I distinctly remember registering at the post office). I believe what might have happened is this:   I was 25 when I started my green card application, so I registered for selective service. However, at that point I was a lawful non-immigrant still so, I'm guessing, I wasn't registered immediately? Does it become pending at that point? Is it even possible to register if you are a non-immigrant? By the time my green card process was finished and I became an immigrant I had already turned 26. My selective service registration at this point would have been rejected (in which case, letting me know might have been nice) because now I'm too old.   So looking at the n-400 form, part 11 #46 A:  Are you a male who lived in the United States at any time between your 18th and 26th birthday? (This does not include living in the United States as a lawful nonimmigrant)   I original checked ""Yes"", but then realized I had no idea what my selective service number was (for part B). Now I'm thinking I should just check ""No"" and leave it at that. I was a nonimmigrant until I turned 26, right?  Does that sound right? Should I just check ""No"" and move on? Or is this something I need to worry about? I had been living under the belief that I was registered up until now. "
2521,What groups should you / must you disclose?,"On the form to apply for US citizenship (N-400) Part 11, item 9A asks:   Have you ever been a member of, involved in, or in any way associated with, any organizations,   associations, fund, foundation, party, club, society or similar group in the United States  or in any other location in the world?   And then 9B asks you to list those groups (name, purpose and dates).  That seems really broad. What would or would not count here? Obviously membership in a political organization would, but presumably a local book club wouldn't? And surely various internet forums can't count!?! Where's the line here? "
2522,Digital nomad on tourist visa with registered business - registered citizen where?,"So I want to become a digital nomad next March in the Philippines. I'm also working on a startup with a few Filipinos, with whom we already won Startup Weekend Manila and so far it seems promising. We're hoping to have our first potential clients for beta testing with our product in January to February (we already have the clients, just need to finish the development of the product), so hopefully there'll be small revenue shortly after this time.  If there won't be fast enough traction however, I need to freelance. That's where I am confused. If I stay in the Philippines as a tourist and I set up a company in say Hong Kong, how exactly is that possible? In theory as I'm planning to move abroad in the long term and I won't be in Germany anyway, I should sign off from my place of residence and so on, right?   But how exactly is it possible to register a company as a digital nomad if you're not really registered living as a citizen in a specific country? I'd only be on a tourist visa at least for as long until my startup has real revenue and we need to register our business, which would grant me a more ""legal"" visa. "
2523,If I adopt Austrian citizenship can I live in the UK?,"I'm self employed American, currently living in the US, and have the possibility of becoming an Austrian citizen. Once I do this can I move to and live permanently in the UK (and continue to be self employed there)? What are the delays involved or residence requirement involved? Can I for example, move to the UK and live in the UK indefinitely immediately after acquiring Austrian citizenship? "
2524,Exchange from EU to UK driving licence: is it worth it? Will that make the insurance cheaper?,"I'm an UK resident and thinking about buying car and of course insure it. I have an EU driving licence. In terms of insurance, will that have a negative impact? Should I exchange it for a UK licence? "
2525,Can I look for work in Germany as a visitor?,"Is it possible to apply for jobs if I come to Germany as a visitor ?  The details: I'm a Canadian citizen and I work in tech (which I've been told is a less regulated field to get into). I'm aware of the YMA between Canada and Germany, but that requires that I have arrangements before I leave and I'm trying to keep my options open.   I've been in contact with some people from the German embassy and I have to say I'm a little confused. The info on the Foreign Office website says I can enter Germany as a visitor (no visa) and apply for residence (just like that ?) but the embassy staff told me that's if I already have a job offer.  Has anyone tried this, entering as a visitor then look for a job ? "
2526,Would a native English speaker need to buy the study materials for an English proficiency test?,"A certain application for permanent residency in Canada requires submission of the results from one of several English language proficiency tests, like this one. Are tests like this easy for native speakers? I have lived in the US for many years and English is my native language. Should I buy the study materials? I wonder if it would be a waste of money. "
2527,Dual Citizenship travel to Cuba via America,This is actually a question a friend of mine had that I couldn't answer directly and really don't know the laws specifically.  If a person already has dual citizenship (specifically American and Dutch) but was born Dutch are they still required to follow travel resrictions to Cuba?  It is unlawful for an American citizen to travel to Cuba since the trade embargo without being granted permission. Most countries do not require a visa up front when traveling as an American citizen and a visa can easily be obtained upon arrival.  Of course there are ways around this rule but without bending or breaking the law of the US.  Would such a travel under a Dutch visa be detrimental to a US citizenship? 
2528,"For H-1B visas, what are job codes, what are they for and how are they chosen?","I want to understand what job codes are for (while applying for H-1B visa).  How does the immigration lawyer decide which job code to put on there?  Is there a minimum and maximum salary associated with each of these job codes?  Also it will be super helpful if someone can share a list of these job codes. I want in particular to find out for roles for folks with a CS background and EEE background (specifically semiconductors).  Initial research. - Most of my friends come from a Masters background. Few of my friends who have come here on L1 and then transitioned to H1 they have had to apply under a ""job code"". The company with which they are applying usually decides the job code and the person does not have much transparency in this regard.   To understand this process better I want to know the relevance of these job codes. These are some of the job codes I found by Googling [website]I wanted understand a further breakdown of these categories. "
2529,Provisions for US Green Card Applicants not planning to stay in US,This might pose as a contradictory question but the situation is as follows:   I hold an Indian Passport I am currently residing in Germany and looking for employment A decade or more ago my maternal aunt had filed a F4- alien relative immigration petition for my mother and this year it seems to finally go through the National Visa Center. I am a stated dependent on my mother and would also be getting a Green Card I would have to go back to India for an Interview at the U.S. Embassy and get a Green Card since all the paper work has gone through.   Questions  I am very likely to get a Job in Europe and having stayed here for more than a couple of years I would like to stay here for a longer span of time.   Are there provisions where the Embassy might grant me an exception of not having to immediately emigrate to the States or ask me to surrender my Green Card for a long term Visitor Visa?   Is there someone with similar situations who can shed some light on this?  
2530,Question about UK short-term student visa online application form,"I'm currently a master candidate enrolled in a university in China, I'm going to visit Newcastle University for a five-month research exchange.

2532,UK resident driving foreign-registered car,Following information found here:  How long can I drive a EU-registered car in the UK?  I have a question on this bit:     lease an EU-registered car and use this temporarily in the UK   What does it mean? Does it cover car rented in another EU country from private owner (with rental agreement on paper and valid under this EU country law)?

2533,Dual Citizenship and Brexit,"I left Britain over 20 years ago after being homeless as a teenager. While living on the streets, I got involved in teenage criminality, was arrested and was sentenced for it. That with other harsh family situations made me leave England to start again elsewhere in Europe.  Now I live in Denmark and have not been involved in any criminal activities. I have worked and earned a living, until I became too sick to work and was put on medication.  Will my past criminal record affect application to be Danish citizen?  If it will, how can my name be cleared in UK online, since my health cannot allow me to travel there personally?  I ask since the form for application to be citizen indicates that one should mention any jail sentences or crimes for which one is yet to be sentenced in home country. I am English, but after Brexit, I must apply for citizenship in Denmark. Otherwise my wife (who is a foreigner from outside EU) and I risk our marriage, property, benefits and her job if the Brexit rules mean I must return to a homeless state in the UK. Just to mention that I have children here with my ex-wife. "
2534,Made critical mistake regarding visa - didn't notice expiration for my mother in law - now in trouble?,"Almost two years ago I began the journey of trying to help my mother in law visit us in the USA.  Here was that post for some background info if someone is interested: How to help my mother in law migrate - no lawyer wanted!  Fast forward to December 26, 2016 my mother in law was finally granted her visa and was allowed to come here.    Since it was so late my mother in law had to wrap up some things back in Iraq before coming here.  After wrapping up some family matters she went to go purchase a ticket to come here and found out that her visa had expired already?  I didn't believe it since she got the visa December 26, 2016 but sure enough on the visa it had an issue date of December 26, 2016 and an expiration date of February 9, 2017.  This gave her only around 40 days to come to the USA.    Her English is not so great so she never really noticed this and I never asked her for a visa copy or print out until today.  Now she has an expired visa and she had never left the country of Iraq.  I don't know how to proceed as I mentioned it took nearly two years and a lot of money to complete this process.  My wife is completely devastated about this as she was expecting to see her mother and show my mother in law her grand kids.  We have not seen her in close to 15 years.  What are my next steps now?  I am a bit confused on how to proceed.  This is an Immigrant Visa based on my wife bringing her mother here.  She was planning on coming mid January beginning of February  but I told her to hold off due to the Trump policy banning any form of immigration.  And now that she wants to come her visa has expired... "
2535,Visa for US citizen's fiancé/husband,"I'm an Italian citizen, in a 4 years long relationship with a US citizen. We would like to get married by the end of this year, and ideally I would initially move to the USA and find a job there. We know that there are multiple options (getting a fiancé visa, getting married in Italy and applying for a spouse visa...) but we are somewhat lost on which one works best and what we should do in order to make this as painless and fast as possible.  Avoiding huge fees with immigration lawyers would be nice but we are getting in touch with a few of them as well.  Ideal requirements   costs limited to the minimum necessary relative speed in the process: being able to set a date for a religious wedding (-> at the same time or after the civil one) in the USA at the end of summer / in the fall limiting the chance of being refused a visa dealing with as little bureaucracy as possible   What is the best way and what are the steps required for it to work? Personal experiences highly welcome!  Bonus question  Would it be possible for us to have a religious wedding in the USA while I am in the United States only on the Visa Waiver program, while waiting for the results of a visa application? "
2536,Is there such thing as a Greek ancestral visa/passport,"I really would appreciate any help.  My dad was born in Greece in 1951.  Both his parents were born in Greece.  He moved to South Africa to work for a relative in 1965, when he took up residence the same year.  He met my South African mother, they married and I was born in 1972.  In 2009 we tried to do an application in order for us children to get a Greek passport.  The application was rejected as The South African Department of Home Affairs made a mistake by omitting one letter in his surname.  Therefore, my maiden name was incorrect as per the Greek Authorities.  We were told that my father had to apply for Residency again under his correct surname, then marry my mother again, then have our birth certificates re-issued, in order for the process to be successful.  Then I have to re-marry my husband with the correct maiden surname and have my children's birth certificates re-issued.   Is there a way one can apply for an ancestral visa, and ultimately obtain a Greek passport? Does one have to give up your current citizenship? Is dual South-African / Greek Citizenship allowed?   I really would appreciate any advise I can get. Thank you "
2537,"Lived in Italy and moved to Germany, do I have to file a tax return in Italy?","I moved to Italy last year and worked for 3 months there before moving to Germany for another job and live here since July.  I will file a tax return here for sure (mainly because I know I will get a taxback since I was overtaxed one month for lack of local knowledge).  I don't really want to bother doing so in Italy though... I earned quite a low income during those 3 months (as a salaried employee) and if I had any tax to get back it would be very low anyway.  So all of my salary in Italy was as a salaried employee, but within the same year I got a second source of income which was my job in Germany (never at the same time, left one for the other) - also as a salaried employee.  So I have to file a tax return in Italy?  BTW, I'm an Italian citizen.  Thanks!  Edit:   This is not a duplicate of Do Italian Citizens living abroad have to pay taxes to Italy? as that question asks in a very generic way if any citizen living outside the country need to file the return; my question is regarding a citizen who was a resident for a short period within the year and moved to another EU country.  As per these instructions for Italy and these for Germany, it is unclear, since the only source of income was as a formal employee but I have a residency move within the year. "
2538,Would a US student visa refusal affect my UK Tier 4 visa application?,I have a fully funded phd position in UK and I want to apply for UK Tier 4 visa.However I have been rejected for US student visa 5 years ago and after that I continued my studies in Europe.

To make it easier and cheaper to travel around the city, I'm interested in getting a car. However, as I'm leaving the country in September, I need to get rid of the car before that.

2540,Working with an X2 visa in China,"I am currently living and working in China as a practicum student under an X2 visa with UIBE. I am actually working for a company that has a relationship with the university, rather than actually enrolled there. I wasn't told I would be on a X2 visa before I moved here.   I am wondering if my visa is connected to the University, or my employer? Meaning if I quit the current job, can my employer cancel my visa? I am looking to switch employers but there might be a gap between one visa to the next, which is a big no no here. "
2541,Residency as spouse of EU,"Wondering if I'm going to have a legal situation on my hands? My husband (an EU citizen) and I retired to Europe from America in mid-2015. I was told by the US embassy before moving that I did not need a visa (I am American). We have since purchased a house in France (January 2016) and intend to stay here. I am in the middle of securing my Carte de Sejour and they keep asking for proof of my whereabouts all this time. Since I deal in cash and didn't know enough to keep receipts, I am coming up empty in the ""prove it"" department! Am I in default on the timing to get my residency permit? It's been over a year since we signed for the house, but we just moved in during October 2016, when I applied for my CDS. Any sound advice is appreciated.  In response to some comments:  I have no idea why the Prefecture is asking for my whereabouts since we arrived in Europe.  To clarify, we traveled inside Europe from the time we arrived in the summer of 2015 until we moved into our new house in France in October of 2016 (15 months). I did not secure a residency permit anywhere, because we were staying with friends and didn't really have a permanent residence. Perhaps I should have applied for the CDS when we signed for the house in January 2016, even though we really weren't staying in France for extended periods. Just trying to find out if it's going be surmountable after all this time. "

2544,"Family name ""nightmare"" between Canada and France","I was born in Canada in the 80's and my parents gave me the family name Y X where Y stands for the family name of my mother and X stands for the family name of my father.  Then in the early 90's we moved to France and my parents had to do the ""Transcription de naissance"" (transcription of birth). There was a problem, however, because back in that time it was not possible to give the family name of the mother to her child. Hence my parents had to register me with the name X and not Y X like I was given in Canada. This made me having my family name differing on my Canadian and French passports as well as on official documents, i.e. my family name was different according to the country I was in.  However on my French ""Copie d'acte de naissance"" (birth certificate), despite my ""Nom"" (family name) showing as X, there is a mention stating that my parents gave me the ""nom patronymique Y X"". And now that I must renew my ID card (carte d'identité), I fell over an official webpage [website]So right now I don't know what my family name is in France. Is it X or Y X? If you could shed some light I'd be happy. "
2545,Port of Entry vs Place of entry into the US,"I am an international Masters student at a university in the United States currently on F-1 visa. I am in my last semester of study and thus applying for Post-completion OPT. For this, one of the forms that I need to fill is form I-765. One of the fields in this form asks ""Place of last entry into the U.S.""  I came to US from my home country in Aug 2015 in an Etihad flight which had a layover at Abu Dhabi airport before landing on SFO International Airport. Since, Abu Dhabi now has a facility to to process all immigration and customs clearance, I got my pre-clearance at Abu Dhabi by CBP officers and my visa was stamped with AUH(Abu Dhabi) code. Finally, I caught the connecting flight and landed into the US at the SFO Airport. My travel history document available on CBP website indicates the port of entry as Abu Dhabi.  Now, coming back to my questions about the field in the form I-765, what should be my answer to the question:""Place of last entry into the U.S."" ?  Should it be Abu Dhabi(International Airport) or San Francisco(International Airport)?  Thanks in advance. "
2546,Getting married in the US on an ESTA,"I am getting married to my American fiancée in the US this summer.  We are currently living together outside of the US (and, should it matter, also outside of my own country of origin, Germany) and would be only visiting the US for a few weeks around the wedding, so an ESTA would be sufficient, time span-wise. I do not plan to stay in the states afterwards.  Question Should I still get an immigrant fiancé visa? If not, would I need to convince the immigration officer of my good intentions of not being an immigrant, and how would I do that? "
2547,J2 visa renewal,"My husband's J2 visa expired and he has a valid job permit until Dec 2017. Our DS-2019 is also valid until DEC 2017. My question is, can he renew his visa inside the US? Or he has to go back to Venezuela in order to do so? Is it possible for him to renew that visa somewhere else? Like Mexico or Canada which are closer? "
2548,What reasons are there to exchange an EU driving licence to a UK/GB one?,"As I understand, it is legal to drive in the United Kingdom with an EU/EEA licence until you are 70 years old, with no residence time limit. Are there reasons to exchange it to a GB license anyway? I can think of a few things:   Cheaper car insurance. Is it enough to offset the £43 + various costs of exchanging? The license needs renewal anyway, and reviewing it would be difficult or impossible. Getting an identity document other than a passport. Brexit worries, but there should be plenty of time to exchange it if necessary later.  "
2549,I am going to the UK as a visiting researcher and I might stay later. I'm funded by a grant from home (USA). What sort of visa should I get?,Short-term study visa seems to fit the bill but I want to be extra careful as I may end up extending my stay. I've done my research already but am seeking to hear a few anecdotal experiences similar to mine before I apply for the visa.  I'm not getting paid (which suggests short-term study) but I'd like as much freedom as possible and I'm going to be receiving a grant from home (in North Carolina). Would that count as compensation?   What's the call? 
2550,Schengen visa to a residency permit for a same-sex marriage in Germany,"A few days ago, my boyfriend, who is a German citizen, and I were married in Denmark. Ours is a same-sex union, and we don't know what awaits us in Germany.  I am a Yemeni citizen (a third-world country that is at war and executes gays). I am living in Turkey under a one-year short term tourist residency permit; I am not able to work with that permit.   I applied for a Schengen visa through the German Embassy and got a visa valid for one month. Using this Schengen visa, I was able to enter Denmark and get married. However, we can't register this marriage in Germany. To do that, I would have to exit Germany and apply for a family reunion visa.   Is it true that the German authorities will ask me to exit the country and apply for a family reunion visa, even though I'm gay, Yemeni and my residency in Turkey will expire in August?  If I do that, I doubt they will ever grant me a visa again.  What if I applied for asylum;  would I still be able to live with my husband or I have to go to a refugee center? "
2551,Refusal of EEA Family Permit,"My wife is a British Citizen and I am South African and have been living and working (permanent placements) in Ireland for roughly 2 years.  My wife was asked about an internal move within her organisation that would also require us to move the UK. We started the EEA Family Permit process and provided everything the checklist indicated. A week ago we received our 'notice of immigration decision' where it was indicated that our application has been refused on the below points:   You state that your wife Kelly is residing in Ireland with you and is a British national. You have provided no evidence that she currently holds a British passport.   her British passport was sent along with mine when the application was submitted. Could it have been overlooked simply because it was not part of the documents that were scanned in and sent immediately while our passports were sent separately via the VAC?  You have failed to provide evidence that your EEA national family member is a qualified person in accordance with Regulation 6 of the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2016. I am, therefore, not satisfied that your EEA national family member is residing in the UK in accordance with the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2016   when one reads Regulation 6 of the EEA Immigration Regulations 2016, specifically 6(6) ""Condition B is that the person provides evidence of seeking employment and having a genuine chance of being engaged."" it should be clear that when having a signed letter from a senior HR Administrator within her company that confirms the process of an internal transfer to the London office for continuing her permanent employment that the second point for refusal should then also be an error    We have been granted right to appeal but are unsure of the above. We would like to ask for assistance in deciding if we are to continue with the appeal or start a new application?  Many thanks in advance, Ryan "
2552,Ex-pats in the Philippines and the 'Real Property Tax',"I've recently heard about the 'Real Property Tax' in the Philippines. It appears to be a tax based on value of owned 'real property' that goes to the local government. Unfortunately I can't really find out much more about it.   It's not clear what counts as 'real property' -- in my particular case I'd like to know if a condo unit counts and who (if anyone) is liable for the tax but any general, clear, and preferably official information would be useful.  Is it safe to assume that if I'm due to pay tax that someone will inform me somehow? I.e. if I haven't got any demand for money I don't need to pay any -- that would seem to make sense but it wouldn't surprise me if that's not the way it works. I know, in most places, ignorance of the tax law is no excuse.   I'm trying to get answers from other avenues, and I'll post if I have any success, but I don't really want to pay someone to look at this -- the information must be freely available somewhere, no?  "
2553,Who to list as an emergency contact when living overseas?,"When one is living single overseas does it make sense to list an emergency contact who lives in the country of origin (assume it to be at least a 8 hour flight)?

I am married to an EU national and we are already living together in the UK. In order to have my residence card, I need to apply for a ""registration certificate or residence card as the family member of a European Economic Area (EEA) or Swiss national"" We filled out the application form and now we just have to send it with our passports,  my husband's and mine, to the address indicated in the application form: Home Office – EEA applications PO Box 590 Durham, DH99 1AD Although we know this is a government address, I feel worry about putting our passports in an envelop without knowing when will they be back or whether they will get to the right address safely.  Our Passport and national IDs are the most important pieces of identification we have. This is the reason why we are concerned about sending them away from us.  According to the application form, it is a requirement to send my passport and my sponsor's.  Can you make me feel better about this please? Is it really safe to send such important documents away from the owner? How long will they take to come back to us ? "
2555,Can a english(non-chinese) speaker survive living in Beijing?,"Essentially, I have just received a job offer to do research in Beijing. I do not know a word of Chinese Mandarin. I applied for the job in a rather sporadic way (this was at the end of a PhD, where one usually deals with the existential crisis of unemployment).   In any case, it's at a great institute with a figure head in my chosen field and from an academic point of view this is a great opportunity, however I remain a little worried I won't be able to survive without knowing chinese. This is not to say I won't learn, but I can't imagine knowing such a language before leaving (3-4 months), if I were to accept. Once I have settled down, I would indeed learn as much as I can but I don't see myself being fluent, but perhaps enough to survive.   So I guess real question is, how hard are those first couple months going to be? Has any anyone else been in a similar situation and can tell me what it was like?  I would imagine being close to the universities, Tsing Hua, Peking. "
2556,Non-EU girlfriend (wife?) following me to Germany - how can she work?,"I was wondering if anyone of you could help me or give me some advice with the following situation:  I am an Austrian citizen currently living with my American girlfriend in the US. In early March I am going to move to Berlin for work, while she stays back in the US for a couple of months. In Summer however, I'd like her to join me in Berlin for several months, and maybe even permanently (thought that's not decided yet).  My main concern is, will she somehow be able to work as well when she eventually follows me to Berlin?  We were talking about getting married for a while now. And after reading this page (Link 1) and this page (Link 2) it seems that getting married would be a legitimate option to enable her to look for work in Germany (remember, I am Austrian and hence EU laws would apply). Please correct me if I have misinterpreted things.  Lastly, does it matter where we would get married? Because we might actually do it while I am still here in the US, as long as Germany/EU recognizes our marriage.  Thank you very much for all your help and guidance! "

2559,"Credit card - ""building credit"" and applying for cards","So, I have been approved for a global transfer of my AMEX card from the UK to the US and I know it will take time to build credit rating/scoring. I am also wondering if it is as good idea to apply for another credit card? Will it harm or do any damage to my non credit rating at the moment or when credit does finally start to build?   The reason I would like another card is simply due to the benefits I can get (membership benefits) compared to the current AMEX card I have. "
2560,US citizen coming to UK for work and subsequent studies,"I am United States citizen and looking to move to the UK. Currently, applying to graduate school there, which would start in October this year. However, I would like to go as soon as March to join my significant other, who is an EU national working / settled in London. I want to be able to work during this period, ideally paid work. I am looking for advice on visas and programs - the best way to legally get me there quickly and allow me to be more than just a tourist for the next 6 months.    Visitor visa: Is it allowed to enter on a standard visitor visa, look for work, and then switch to the appropriate visa? Would I have to leave the UK in between? Partner visa: Based on the rules, I do not think our relationship will convince immigration, as we have not officially lived together nor do we have any other proof of combined assets. Are these stipulations strictly enforced, or might we have a shot just saying we have been a couple since 2014? Work visa: I'm guessing I have no chance at a serious sponsorship knowing that I want to be in school instead in a matter of months. Work visa, such as Tier 5 temporary work: From my research, I am hoping I could have a fixed-term internship, research position, or job for a few months with this visa. If so, what is the best way to find one? I would love some advice on job searching from outside the UK. Should I apply for internships as normal from job websites; or is there a smarter way to find vacancies? Can I contact Tier 5 sponsorship bodies directly for help? Should I approach companies or universities directly for opportunities or research positions? Do I have any hope of being taken seriously, or finding something in a timely manner?   Are there any other potential routes?  I have a bachelor's degree in Biomedical Engineering and significant research experience with neuroscience and data science. "
2561,"As an EEA national in the UK for 5+ years, how do you get a ""permanent residence card"" or ""document that shows you have permanent residence""?","If you're thinking of applying to become a British Citizen, two of the requirements are:        been granted indefinite leave to stay in the UK (this means there’s no specific date that you have to leave) or permanent residence if you’re an EEA national (and you have a permanent residence card or document that shows you have permanent residence)   had indefinite leave to stay in the UK for the last 12 months (or permanent residence if you’re an EEA national with a permanent residence card or document that shows you have permanent residence)      From my reading, that means that if you're a citizen of an EEA country, you don't need to apply for or be granted indefinite leave to stay, instead you need something around permanent residency.  However, when you follow the link given about permanent residence cards, it only talks about family members of EEA nationals in the Eligibility section. I can't see anything there about EEA nationals themselves.  If you're an EEA national who's been in the UK for 5+ years, and you're pondering applying to become a British Citizen, what should you be doing on the proof of permanent residency front? Do you ignore the eligibility section on the ""Apply for a UK residence card"" page and apply for the card anyway? Or is there an alternate route you should be taking? Perhaps the document that shows you have permanent residence or section kicks in here? "

I am hoping to boost my career in freelance writing upon moving, and currently work for a couple of people over here in the UK. I have received a substantial number of offers to work on a full-time formal basis when I graduate, and I'm hoping to take them up on the offer despite the fact that I will be living abroad, as all work can be completed remotely.   My only issue is that of the Dutch tax system. How (if it's even possible, or worth it) would I go about living in the Netherlands, yet working for UK clients and earning pounds sterling by doing so? Also, what is the protocol for working freelance in the Netherlands? Could anyone help me with this? Any information or advice whatsoever would be appreciated.  Thanks! "

2567,Working in Switzerland with a Romanian passport,"I am an Israeli that also has a Romanian citizenship. I got a job offer from an Israeli company that has offices in Zurich and were interested in employing me there.  According to what I've read, EU citizens other then Bulgarians and Romanians can freely search for work for 3 months in Switzerland. Does the restriction for Romanians and Bulgarians also apply if I already have a job when I arrive?  If it does, is there an option to request a working visa based on other factors? "

2569,Studying in another EU country as a EU long-term resident,"I have the status mentioned in the title and I have obtained this permit in the Netherlands. The directive that created this status (2003/109/EG and later 2011/51/EU) states that I should be able to enjoy the same rights as a Dutch person in the areas such as work, education, social security and so on.  My question is as follows. Suppose that I would like to study in another EU country. Would I then pay the same amount of tuition fee as a Dutch person, which is significantly lower than the tuition fee for an Non-EU national? Or is my enjoyment of such rights limited to the Netherlands only? "

But now I also got a letter from TGKK asking me if I was drunk, it there is any witness and so on..

We would be moving from the USA.  The first question is about that the electric fences that surround apartment complexes there. What happens if there is ever a blackout in the neighborhood? Do the complexes have power generators that kick in in those situations?  What is the policy and prevailing culture about individual gun ownership? Is it relatively common for residents to carry a gun, like in some parts of USA? "

I have filled out the forms to arrange for my NI; they've posted it to this specific address. Does it mean they have this as my permanent resident address, or do I have to fill out an AR-11?  What are the consequences for late filing?  If this is required, what should I put under ""old address""? "

2574,Australia visa Immigrant country-of-origin preferences?,"Just a general question for those lucky enough to hold dual-triple-etc citizenships. Does Australia Immigration have preferences/bias to the number of skilled independent worker visa's (subclass 189) given out to different countries?

So I don't have any special study or work visa for Korea. The Korean consulate tells me I need a special visa to apply for an ARC (Alien registration card).

I normally pay all my taxes in Italy. Is it possible to pay taxes in USA on one job (service work-self employed) that I did for an American client / USA resident that was paid into an account in USA ? Or do I have to pay the taxes on it in Italy?  I am also a Italian citizen and resident, both work and taxes. I am also an American citizen, not resident.   I always declare my earnings in USA, but I am exempt from most taxes because the USA has an exemption from double taxing for people who earn under $80,000 yearly and pay the taxes on it in Italy.  What I was trying to understand is can I pay taxes on the work I did in USA only in USA, not where I am resident, Italy? Of course, taxes are much higher in Italy. Also It would be a good thing for me to pay into Social Security that otherwise I don't have to. "

I'm sure many people must have been in this situation before. "

2582,German courses in Rostock,"I have recently (six months ago) moved to Rostock and I am working full time as a consultant of a German company. My contract has been reconfirmed for another full year, with good chances to keep going on for a bit even after that.  I do not speak German at all (I work in IT and in the office I can work effectively with English) but I think it would be better to start learning it.  This will be my own private initiative (i.e. I pay out of my own pocket) and will have to do that outside office hours.  Here in Rostock I have seen Inlingua, Berlitz and a place called s-cool, there are probably more, but these three are also very close to my apartment so I'd start with these to simplify the logistic.  I think a regular class (or even better, one-on-one lessons) would work better for me (I don't trust myself to stay focused with self-studying, at least for languages).  I am also aware that ultimately it's the teacher and how well you get along with his/her style and personality, but I'd like to get at least some idea about which of these to try first.  Finally, in case it matters, my native language is Italian.  (I am also aware that there might be state sponsored or university courses that might be way cheaper, but I'd like to try the ""commercial"" courses first)  Question: any suggestions/ideas about which one to try first? Any idea of the costs? "

Would it be possible to enter first on the tourist visa and then 10 days before I start my job go to Canada (I'll live very close) and re-enter USA on E3?

I have negotiated with my supervisor to keep working with him for three months more but from my home country in Europe. Do I need to extend my J1 visa for these three months if I'm not going to travel to the US during that time?  In addition, I want to apply for other job positions in the US after completing my contract with the university. Is it easier for the future company that sponsors me (if any!) to transfer a J1 visa than creating a new one (H1B I guess)? "
2588,UK ILR/Permanent Residency Automatically Canceled after 2 years of being overseas?,"I have an Indefinite leave to remain (ILR) in UK.

What are the restrictions that could prevent a visitor, worker, student, spouse, or tourist from renting a flat or apartment? What are the penalties?  Must I show a prospective landlord my ENTIRE travel history? Can the landlord make photocopies and thus expose me to identity theft?  Will the landlord keep my documents safe?  Most importantly, how much extra time should I plan for when renting accommodation to allow for this new rule?  Note: I'm not asking if you agree with the rule, it's a matter a law. And I'm not asking how they plan to enforce it, because culpability lies solely upon the landlord, not the migrant. "

We were not planning to apply for any government assistance and were paying medical insurance for the in-law out of pocket. And then Obamacare happened and the cheapest insurance we can get now is 500+ a month now (vs 150 we used to pay).   I see that in the i-864 form there is this section:      ""What Other Consequences Are There?      If an intending immigrant becomes a permanent resident in the United   States based on a Form I-864 that you have signed, then until your   obligations under the Form I-864 terminate, your income and assets may   be considered (""deemed"") to be available to that person, in   determining whether he or she is eligible for certain Federal   means-tested public benefits and also for State or local means-tested   public benefits, if the State or local government's rules provide for   consideration (""deeming”) of your income and assets as available to   the person.

What are other exceptions from section 403(c) I can't find a full list.  "

Amusing that A, B and C are among the EU countries that have this rule in their tax code, and that I am originally a citizen of A and I am self-employed. I work online and my clients are from all over the world: In any given year, I stay 100 days in A, 100 days in B and 165/6 days in C.  So where am I obliged to pay income tax? apparently Nowhere!  Does this plan work? If yes, where can be A, B and C? If not, why not? and where should I pay taxes at the end of the year? "
2593,Applying for EEA Family Permit UK,"My wife has been working in UK full time for almost 3 years. We met one year ago and we recently got married. She has visited me in my home country 3 times in this year and stayed for 15 days. Since we are both working full time and she can't find a job in my country as she doesn't speak my language, we couldn't spend more time together than vacations. We speak daily via messages, voice and video calls since we've met.  We have a plan to visit her family in her home country soon and then apply for an EEA FP to join her.  After checking the procedure I found 2 things confusing and one thing scaring me: , Question 8.2.9     Have you lived with the EEA National in a relationship like a marriage or civil partnership at any time (including since a wedding or civil partnership ceremony)?   Is our situation a yes or a no?!!  Question 8.9.1     Where do you and the EEA National plan to live in  the UK?   My wife is renting a room in London and if I am going to join her there we will rent our own place since I'm taking my savings with me to cover the rent and other expenses until I find a job. So I don't know how to answer this one either.  The most important thing that I found in forums and that scares us is rejection on the ground of marriage of convenience. We have a genuine relationship and I don't know how to prove it, because they say applying after the marriage is considered as sham marriage. Are pictures of us together, and our conversations enough a proof? Printing all of this out would produce a novel! "
2594,Entry/Exit Data for UK,I will be applying for a tourist visa as a Non-EU national to visit the UK with my husband.  As part of this process I will be required to provide entry/exit dates.

My wife was born in Peru, according to Peruvian law that granted her citizenship according to Jus Soli, additionally we still have her original passport from Peru. She was adopted by American parents as an infant and became a naturalized citizen when she was 3. We have all the documentation proving this, Birth certificate, Naturalization papers, passports, etc. This all occurred in the early to mid 90's.  My question, does she retain her citizenship to Peru? If her citizenship was renounced wouldn't we have official documentation showing it, issued from either the US or Peruvian governments? "

I left UK and want to visit UK as a tourist,"I used to work in the UK under a Tier 2 visa, and my residence permit is valid until December 2017.  I left my Job in October 2015 and left the country.  Now I want to visit the UK as a tourist.  So, do I need a visit visa, or can I use the same residence permit which has validity till December 2017?

2597,Citizenship for a UK born child from EEA parents after 5 years,"These are the things I know:   Children born in the UK by EEA parents before they obtained PR status are not British Citizens, but once the parents obtain the status they can register to become one. Children born in the UK by EEA parents after they obtained PR status are British Citizens.   Getting PR status is supposedly automatic after excercising treaty rights for five years. However getting proof of this takes supposedly a long time as there is a huge backlog of PR applications yet to be processed.  So what happens to children who were born after the parents obtained PR status but before they get the proper paperwork about it. Are they British citizens? If yes, how to prove this to obtain a British passport for them? "

2599,Does Germany recognize the Surinder Singh ruling?,"Under the Surinder Singh ruling, an EU citizen can choose to be treated under EU freedom of movement law in his or her own country after having exercised freedom of movement in another EU country.  This is reflected in EU documents.  For example (emphasis added):     if you are an EU citizen and have never lived in another EU country only national rules will apply..   However, materials from Germany seem to omit the possibility for Germans to be treated under EU law after living elsewhere in the EU.  For example:     Familienangehörige von Deutschen bekommen keine Aufenthaltskarte nach dem Freizügigkeitsgesetz.... [translation: Family members of Germans cannot get a residence card according to the freedom of movement law....]   Does Germany in fact allow Germans to bring their family members to Germany under freedom of movement when they've lived elsewhere in the EU?  If so, is there an official source where this information is available? "

If I were able, and the J-1 were approved, would I have to go back to my home country and then re-enter the US on the J-1?   Or, is it better to apply for J-1 while I'm in the States? I read that this option might take much longer (6 months). "

Een postzegel plakken is NIET nodig.   i.e. essentially ""Send this completed form, postage stamp not required"". Well, ok, but - do I just drop this piece of paper in one of the orange postal boxes? Also, what about my account details appearing just like that for everyone to see? On the other hand, if I do put it in an envelope - won't the postal service expect a stamp? "

I already know that you can visit the UK with no visa for up to 6 months. But we would like to stay longer and want to see if there is a way to do so.  Now here are some important factors...   My wife is a UK citizen (has UK/US dual citizenship) but she only is a UK citizen because of her mom who was born a UK citizen. My wife was born and has lived in the US but because of her mom she gets the dual citizenship. We will be living with her Grandmother who has lived in England all her life. My wife works for an Engineering company who is allowing her to work 100% remote while she is over there. They technically have an office in England but she will be working for a project that is US based still. They decided not to ""transfer"" her to the UK office because she would get paid a lot less.   So I think regardless she can stay as long as she wants cause she has the dual citizenship, but we need to find a way for me to be able to stay longer.  Given the situation above, would I be able to get a spouse visa? Since she will technically be working on a US based project, will that not allow me to do that? Can she even tell immigration that she is doing that? Even though she has dual citizenship?  If that is not possible... her grandmother is 82 and is legally blind, is there some sort of caregiver visa I can get to help my wife take care of her?  Or maybe sign up for a class and get a student visa?  Just trying to figure out an option.  Thank!   Branden  "
2614,ZAB comparability statement for german EU blue card visa,"I am a software engineer from Lahore, Pakistan with a job offer from a Munich based German company. I full-fill the requirements of an EU Blue-card which requires an initial work visa from my country to travel to Germany. Upon initial inquiry, German Embassy in Pakistan has asked me to get an equivalence certificate from ZAB. I applied to ZAB more than a month ago, paid the fee and they told me to expect two weeks for processing but since then they have not responded to my emails. Now the appointment with Embassy is just around the corner and it does not look like I will get any news from ZAB before that.   My degree is categorized as 'Entspricht' and the university is listed as H+ in Anabin database.  I guess my options are limited in the sense that I can tell Embassy staff that I have applied for a ZAB certificate but I am still waiting. Would this be reason enough for them to turn down my application? The appointment cycle at German Embassy is very long and next attempt may not be available before a couple of months.   Are there other any options available? Appreciate response from people who have been in similar situation before.  "
2615,My wife has an interview for a job in Australia (we are based in London). What can I do in terms of a visa if she is offered / takes the job?,"My wife and I are based in London.  She has an interview (being held in London) for a teaching job in Australia (Ballarat, specifically), starting in January 2018.  I work as a Data Scientist and I understand that my profession is listed on the Skilled Occupations List, too.  Assuming she gets the job, what options are there for me in terms of a visa?  Also, assuming that I can go over with her and that everything is taken care of in terms of a visa, do we have to live in Ballarat or can we live anywhere (""where"" we live isn't relevant in the context of this question)?  I have read multiple texts stating that we will be limited to living only in the area where she acquires work for at least 2 years; is there a visa that we can apply for which will allow us to live anywhere, regardless of the job location?

2616,Getting married in Norway - does my partner need to OWN A HOUSE?,"I come from outside EU/Schengen and my Norwegian boyfriend and I want to get married in Norway. I checked the application process and necessary documents. We seem to fulfil all criteria, but there is one that causes some doubts. According to UDI website, he needs to ""have a house where I would live with him"" and provide this:  Housing documentation the lease or the deeds (in Norwegian: 'skjøte' or 'grunnboksutskrift') for the house/apartment  Thing is, he doesn't own a house. He is renting a place, which is a case for the most of the young people here. I don't quite understand what skjøte and grunnboksutskrift are. Is it satisfactory that he is renting a house or does he actually need to own one?  Can I  not get married if he is not a house owner? "
2617,"Tel Aviv safety, cost of living, etc",I am an Indian citizen. I am going to travel to Tel Aviv for long term. So my company is going to apply for a work permit.   Is it safe to live long-term in Tel Aviv and would it be safe to bring my family after 1 year? What is the salary range for a senior technical consultant in the banking industry? Please share the cost of living for a bachelor.  Any racism in Tel Aviv? Any terrorism in Tel Aviv? Would it be possible to apply for a job in Saudi Arabia or any Arab countries after a long stay in Israel?  
2618,"W8-BEN / W9 mandatory for J2 (J1-dependent)? If so, how to get an ITIN?","I moved from France to the United States of Amercia with my wife a couple of months ago. I'm on a J1 Visa, working for an University as a Research Scholar and my wife is on a J2 visa. She does not work, and we are both French citizens.  When we informed our French bank that we moved to the USA, they asked us to fill W8-BEN or W9 forms, depending if we were US person or Non Us person.  My situation was ""easy"" and common: I registered at the Foreign National Information System (FNIS), filled a SS-5 to get a Social Security Number (SSN), and then completed a W8-BEN and a form 8233 (certification for withholding exemption).   My wife's situation is more complex, as it seems. It seems that she needs a SSN or a ITIN to fill a W8-BEN or a W9. She can't apply for a SSN, as she does not work, so we filled a W7 form (Application for IRS Individual Taxpayer Identification Number). It came back with a rejection letter:     We received your application for an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN) but have rejected it because you didn't provide an exception number or correct information in check box (h).   The aforementioned box contains     Additional information for a and f: Enter Treaty Country : … and treaty article number: …   As we are in the a case (Nonresident alien required to get ITIN to claim tax treaty benefit), we indicated in those fields respectively ""France"" and ""Article #20 (J2-dependant)"".  I called the IRS this morning, and I've been told that our application was rejected because we did not provide the original documents needed (among which, her passport), so that we had to come in person to one of the IRS office. The person I had on the phone did not seem really informed of our situation, and I'm really puzzled by the mismatch between his answer and what's written in the rejection letter.  Sorry for the long background, my question is: do we need her to fill a W8-BEN to please our French bank or to make a joint tax return? If so, how can we get a ITIN number for her? "
2619,F1 Visa and Bank statement requirement,"Well, in USA, I have to show that I can pay the tuition fee and also support myself. If I receive tuition waiver,I need not pay tuition fee, but I have to support myself. If I receive a TAship offer, then I can show that and say that I have my means to support myself in USA. The TAship amount is enough for the living expenses in the United States.   When I face the visa interview, will I have to bring bank statement to show some amount of money? How much?  My economic condition is not good.  "
2620,Income tax status for US citizen married to G-4 visa holder,"A US citizen (or green card holder) marries a G-4 visa holder.  The G-4 spouse works for an international organization in the US and pays no income tax.  How does such a couple file with the IRS?  Must the US spouse file as ""married filing separately""?

2621,Obtaining German residence permit when someone guarantees,"I've heard there is a possibility for obtaining residence permit in Germany if someone else guarantees to be caretaker, and shows enough proof their income is at least 2100 eur. per month.

2622,What is the UK correspondence to this job,"In my home country, Portugal, there is a job title that translates into something like ""Health and Safety at Work Technician"".  This technician is someone that works for a company and knows about security laws and standards that must be regarded at work, ensuring that at the company the security measures are being applied, workers are safe and the company doesn't break any security law.  What is the corresponding job for this in the UK? If I was to look for a job having these qualifications, what should I look for? "
2623,Is it possible to switch from tourist visa to other status while in Japan?,"I am looking for academic jobs and Japan came up as one potential possibility.  I am in the USA now and my visa is tied to my work here, meaning that when my appointment is up, I need to leave.  There might be a gap of a couple of months between the end of my current appointment and the start of the appointment in Japan.  For various reasons it would be strongly preferable for me to go directly to Japan from the USA instead of spending that gap in another country.  Is this possible?  Is it at all legally possible to go directly to Japan on a tourist visa, then change status while there?  If possible, is it relatively easy or common to do so?  Or is trying to do this likely to lead to significant bureaucratic complications?  (I am aware that in the USA trying to do something like this is not recommended and risky, but I have absolutely no idea about Japan.)  More details on my situation:     I am married.  I can stay 90 days visa-free in Japan, but my spouse does need a visa.  The question applies to both of us. In this question I'm not interested in discussing staying in a third country during the gap.  "

2625,UK NARIC Statement of Comparability for Spouse Job Seekers,"The UK NARIC site states...     The UK NARIC Statement of Comparability is an officially recognised   document that confirms the recognition of an overseas qualification   and its comparable level in the UK, irrespective of it being an   academic, vocational or professional award. It is used by   universities, colleges, employers and Government departments and   agencies forming part of their decision-making process. A Statement of   Comparability can be used to help support applications made under   Tiers 1 and 2 of the Points Based System for immigration to the UK;   particularly the Graduate Entrepreneur route within Tier 1.   Source:  NARIC Statement of Comparability  While the UK scuttled most of the Tier 1 route some time ago and the other tiered routes are evolved beyond recognition, a NARIC Statement of Comparability can be used to meet the English speaking requirement for all migrants, including spouses.  It costs GBP 55 and takes about 6 weeks.  The product is a letter like this sample.  I am already aware that NARIC does not enjoy an esteemed position by some expats who have used them in the Tiered routes.  A spouse does not require a work permit and does not need to show the Home Office anything from NARIC. The question concerns UK employers and the standards they would use.  For those incoming migrant spouses who wish to seek professional employment, is getting such a Statement of Comparability to show prospective employers an advisable preparatory step?  Is it a good thing to 'have on hand'? Or do contemporary HR departments have sufficient information at their fingertips with Google? "
