0,Importing source from Ancestry or FamilySearch into Gramps automatically?,"I've been using ancestry.com for a couple of years online, and recently got their desktop software to help manage trees better. One of the reasons I had created my trees online was the ease of incorporating sources for the events in people's timelines. One of the problems with the way Ancestry.com does it is that it makes it difficult (though not impossible) to use the same record as a source for facts/events about multiple people. This seems to come up often on marriage and death records that mention parents' names, on ships' manifests that mention relatives, etc.  I have read some interest descriptions of gramps on this site, an have installed a copy. I imported a small GEDCOM tree to test things out. As described in the documentation, some of my source information didn't get copied into gamps. (Mostly these seemed to be notes describing the sources.)  I like the idea of treating sources as first-class objects, but I am concerned about the tedious and error-prone data-entry that I think I need to do to add new sources to a gramps database. Here I am thinking about an example of finding a census record on ancestry.com or a marriage record on FamilySearch, and then having to transcribe it into gamps.   So I would like to know what are established best practices for adding new sources to gramps for records found through online searches? Is there a way to import the stuff in some semi-automatic way, or must everything be re-typed? How are images of documents best handled? What are good naming patterns for image files? "
1,What is the earliest age a boy in England could get married in the 1800s?,"My wife has an ancestor named Charles Davies. The 1841 and 1851 Wales censuses as well as his marriage record state that he was born in Flintshire, Wales between 1813 and 1816. A search for his baptismal record (electornic, published indexes, and microfilm) always pulls up the same two Charles Davies born in 1818 or 1821. The problem is our Charles was married in 1835, which would put his age at 17 or 14 respectively. I know that getting married at 14 is very unlikely, but what about age 17? What is the earliest age that was considered proper for a boy to get married in England in the 1800's? "
2,How can I search Findmypast for children born to a given set of parents?,"Findmypast is an excellent resource for UK records, but is there an easy way that I can find the parish baptisms for any child born to a given set of parents? It is easy to do on Ancestry and FamilySearch by adding the names of parents, the expected surname of the children, and leaving the given name field blank. But I cannot see any way to do this on Findmypast besides entering in just the surname. That usually brings up too many results, especially since the parents names are not shown in the search results list. Is there a better way? "

4,"The terms ""strafgefangener"" and ""arbaither""","I have a 4x great grandfather that was from Kaltbrunn, St. Gallen, Switzerland, but died in Ludwigsburg, Wurttemberg.  He died in 1849 and associated with his death entry in the Wurttemberg Catholic church records there is mention of him as ""Arbaither"" and that his profession is ""Strafgefangener"", if I have read the script correctly.  Do these terms have something to do with prisoner?  Was he a prisoner of war, or was he in a work house like situation or poor house?. Thank you! "
5,Sources for Border Crossings between Toronto and Chicago in early 1890's?,"What records might exist for border crossings and travel in early 1890's between Toronto, Ontario, Canada, and Chicago, Cook County, Illinois, USA, probably via Michigan?  The family members involved were British (some born in the UK, some born in Canada).  The family were present in Canada in the 1881 and 1901 censuses, but not in the 1891.  There is evidence at least some of them were in Chicago for at least part of this time (especially 1889-1897).  Since there's no 1890 US Census I'm looking for other sources to find out more.  Ancestry's ""Border Crossings: From Canada to U.S., 1895-1954"" doesn't have any Michigan crossings listed (although they do have some Michigan arrivals for the 1900's, not mentioned on the dataset description).  Are there any other records (shipping, railroad, border control) that would mention people crossing this border?   "

7,How do I convert my RAW FamilyTreeDNA FamilyFinder test result files to Ancestry or 23andMe format?,"How do I convert the the RAW FamilyTreeDNA.com Family Finder Autosomal and X DNA result files into another sites format like Ancestry.com's or 23andMe's format?    There is a growing need to do this as many third party utilities, including currently GEDMATCH.com (potentially permanently) in the very near future, may require it to not be in this multi-part format that FamilyTreeDNA.com uses.   What methods (whether it be a application or a procedure) are available to convert this data format so we can use the results in these utilities? "

9,How should I show my step-mother?,"I am using an online service for my family tree, and this got me wondering. How should I show my step-mother and my half-siblings? I mean, will my father's marriage to my step-mother be on the same level, underneath or something else? "
10,How common was it for a father to be at the birth in the late 1700s early 1800s?,"I've got several old records for this family, all births for children of Johannes and Anna Gerdruth. They all seem to explicitly state that Johannes was present at the birth.  The fact that they all say this leads me to think this isn't common for the time, is that true? Given that he was a shepherd, I wonder if it was possibly the distance to help that would have necessitated it.    6./ d(en) 26 ten ejus(dem) Johannes, des Schäfers Johannei Zaun et ux.

12,Tracing an ancestor from Scotland back to Ireland?,I have a brick wall with Robert Ferrier born circa 1817 to David Ferrier and Margaret McLachlan. He died 15th May 1899 in Houston Renfrewshire. He married Flora McKay 12 July 1840 in Paisley.   I have searched for any clues using [website]
13,What is Ellen M Berry's relationship in this Census Record?,"I'm looking at the 1880 census record for a Ellen M Berry. She stuck out to me as odd, being much younger than anyone else in the family, despite the transcription saying she was a daughter. She also has a different last name. I looked at the image of the record, and I see something written immediately before the word Daughter that clearly doesn't fit into the column it is supposed to indicate. I believe it says ""Grand"", as in ""Granddaughter"", but I'm just not good enough at reading such writing to get it perfect. What is the relationship?  I should add that I'm 90% positive that Alfred and Ruth married sometime in the 1870's, for a number of reasons. Previous census records indicate Alfred is married to a Mary, and there seems to be a mixture of the two. I have parents listed for each, that don't match, so I'm quite sure they are two different people. My theory is that Ellen is Ruth's granddaughter from a previous marriage, and I'm hoping this record can prove that. Alfred's oldest child was born in 1858, but she died in 1875, age 17, and no other child of Alfreds even makes sense.    "
14,Finding records for indentured servants in South Carolina?,"We strongly suspect that our ancestor, Elizabeth Turley, who married Meredith Helm, came to South Carolina as an indentured servant.  She was born in Speldhurst, England in 1778, and was the only one of her family to come to America, having done so by age 15, when she was having children in South Carolina.  She lived in Camben District, Fairfield County, South Carolina.  Does a record still exist to show that this did happen?  Is there a history of this family? "
15,"Finding cause of death in 1909 for Scotsman James McMillan in Nagasaki, Japan?","James McMillan was chief engineer for the Straits Steamship Company on the Perak in 1908, working between Singapore, Port Swettenham and Penang. This information is contained in a letter written to the family by James.  James' youngest daughter was Shigeko Mabel McMillan, who married Robert Walker jr. in 1937.    What was the cause of death of James McMillan who died at his wife's home in Nagasaki on 13 Sept. 1909, aged 49?  Memorial found at Find A Grave, which notes:     James McMillan was born in Adrossan, Scotland. He served as a chief engineer in Penang before coming to Nagasaki.         He died at the home (No. 81 Uma-machi) of his Japanese wife on September 13, 1909 at the age of forty-seven and was buried at Sakamoto International Cemetery.         McMillan was survived by his wife and four children. His youngest daughter, Shigeko Mabel McMillan, married Robert Walker, Jr. in 1937.        Burial: Sakamoto International Cemetery, Nagasaki, Nagasaki, Japan   James' DOB: 23 May 1862 at Ardrossan, Ayr, Scotland, as recorded in a Family document. "
16,How many generations back is suggested by 6 mutations on a yDNA-67 match?,"I have a yDNA-111 test that finds a match with a yDNA-67 test with 6 mutations and a name variation, Thorp vs Tharp.  Statistically, how many generations away would our common ancestor be to give a mean of 6 mutations?  How many generations plus or minus would you need to add to the mean to include one standard deviation?  It is suggested that the common ancestor might be 9 generations away, so I'm wondering if that is realistic?  I would imagine that mutations are rarer and thus 6 mutations out of 67 markers would take more than 9 generations to get an average of 3 down our line and another 3 down their line from the common ancestor.  Note that the haplogroup is predicted to be: R-M269 and the Ysearch ID is SC8P7. "
17,Understanding 1807-1812 Pennsylvania land records document?,"We found this record a while ago, and have always been a bit puzzled by it, so I'm hoping for some input. The first bit appears that Sarah Penrod may still be living (dated 1807). The second bit dated 1812 seems as if she's died.   I suppose I'm confused as to whether Sarah Penrod is deceased or not in 1807, and if her daughter (Mary Bateman) is the individual responsible for distributing the 8 shares of land, or if Mary is simply selling her land?   Is Christian Rice inheriting land from Sarah Penrod via Mary Bateman?   It's always seemed like an inheritance to me, but never having seen one before, I would love a second opinion here! I do not know who Christian's mother is, only that his father died when he was a child, so it's quite possible this is his mother who had since remarried (although none of his children are named Sarah). Here's the land record:      To all people to whom these present shall come, John Bateman and Mary   his wife, of Somerset Township, Somerset County and State of   Pennsylvania send greeting, know ye that we the said John Bateman and   Mary his wife, for and in consideration of the sum of one hundred and   twenty dollars, lawful money of the United States to them in hand   paid, hath released, remised, and forever quit claims and by these   presents doth for themselves and their heirs and assigns remise   release and forever quit claim all the estate, right, title, interest,   claim and demand whatsoever, of them the said John and Mary of into   and out of the one undivided eighth part of a certain, messuage, and   tract of land situate in the township County and State first   above-mentioned, adjoining on the south of Christian Rice and Michael   Walters on the north Jacob Lehmer, Peter Copp and others on the east   and west being the messuage, land of plantation whereon Mrs. Sarah   Penrod now lives and occupies, with the appurtenances unto Christian   Rice, innkeeper, of Milford Township in the County and State aforesaid   his heirs and assigns.

18,Identifying Pennsylvania ancestors born early 1900s?,I have hit a brickwall when trying to find any information on my great grandparents on my grandfather's side.    I found his obituary online when I was actually looking for my uncle's obituary on my mother's side.  My great grandfather's name (Benjamin Earnest) is the same as my brother's name and information I find seems to go back to my brother who I know is very much still alive. My great grandmother's name is Mary Earnest (maiden name: Stevenson).   I just know that they lived in Pennsylvania and that my grandfather Ronald L. Earnest was born in Butler in 1936. ([website]I tried finding a census record for 1940 since my grandfather was born in 1936 and was not able to.  I have tried Ancestry.com and Familysearch.org and I can't seem to find anything on any of them which is really frustrating. I have also asked my half brother if he knew anything and he didn't know any information.  I am starting to think I am doing something wrong as I can't seem to find any information and all I want to do is identify my great grandparents. 
19,Gramps syncing with Dropbox or via second Genealogy program?,"I use Gramps almost daily and I am very satisfied with it. The only downside it has, in my opinion, is the fact that synchronising its database is fairly risky via Dropbox, s. here, or hassle-ish via USB stick.  Does someone use another program for the sole purpose of synchronising the xml (or gpkg) file exported from Gramps (v. 4.2.2.) on PC 1 (Linux) in order to import it to Gramps (v. 4.2.2.) on PC 2 (Win Vista)? If so, which one?  Does someone has day-to-day experience with Gramps and Dropbox-Sync on two computer? Is it really that dangerous?  "

21,Offline availability of commercially available online sources?,"I want to gain an understanding of commercial genealogy services from the perspective of a market that is described as ""embryonic"" (Germany)  in Ancestry's Ancestry Global Family History Report 2014.  Especially I am wondering to which extent genealogical sources (excluding those from FamilySearch) from the US/UK hosted by Ancestry, MyHeritage and other major commercial players are still available for research elsewhere (public archives, libraries, ...)? Are there sources that are not available elsewhere anymore, resulting in an oligopoly or even a monopoly for commercial providers?  This question might not be answerable in numbers, but maybe you can describe some tendencies. "
22,Deciphering an Intended Marriage from England around 1800,"I have a record that is an Intent to Marriage for my very great grandparents George Dutton and Ann Davies. I'm trying to understand exactly what it means, including the handwritten portions. Specifically, I have the following questions:   My transcription of the handwritten text states ""George Dutton of Coddington in the bounty and Diocese of? bertha Darem?r and Robert Ruseve of ????? in the land ??????"" I don't see Ann's name here at all (It is mentioned in a part I omitted below). The printed text states We, so I would think her name would be in there. of Coddington, does that imply that George was born there? Is there anything else in there to indicate where he was born? The printed portion states something about giving ""the Sum of Five hundred Pounds of good and lawful Money ..."" Was that the cost of marriage in that day? That seems like a very high cost, and I had never heard of a wedding costing such a high cost, I'm just wondering what the story is with that.    "
23,Unable to import data from Ancestor Research Tool (ART)?,"I spent a couple of weeks researching my family tree back in 1999 documenting my findings in a program from Everton Publishers named Ancestor Research Tool.  It appears to be a Foxpro database I can open and view the dbf file, the folder contains the following extensions: cdx dbc dbm fpt dbf and an exe that won't start.  The program is long gone I've searched high and low for the program online, called the old 800 # (no joy) and the Everton website is inaccessible. Can anybody help me recover my data?

24,What does O.S. K.U.V stand for on a headstone?,"I'm looking at the headstone picture shown on this page:   [website]    Which has an O.S. K.U.V. symbol with two hands shaking.  The grave is for Louis Kovach, a coal miner who was born on 30 Jun 1872 in Austria and died on 29 Mar 1913 in Samaritan Sanitarium, Pittsburg, Crawford County, Kansas.  He arrived in America in 1904 and lived in East Mineral, Cherokee County, Kansas.  He died in a coal mining accident that broke his back.  One suggestion for K.U.V. is ""Kranken Unterstuetzungs Verein"" which translates to ""Sick Support Team"".  The O.S. probably is ""Order of S...."". "
25,Looking for information on fathers of children born out of wedlock,"My aunt had a baby out of wedlock in Florida in the late 1930s or as late as 1941.

26,"Allegheny County, Lilly PA, April 1924 List of those Involved in KKK & Residents Clash","I am finding evidence that a distant cousin may have participated in or been an organizer of the Lilly, PA Klu Klux Klan incident where 400 armed Klan members attempted a cross burning in the town and were confronted by the townspeople. Shots were fired and 4 eventually died.  In The Ku Klux Klan in Western Pennsylvania, 1921–1928 by John Craig as well as in newspaper articles the individual is specifically mentioned by their initials and last name. Unfortunately there are several relatives known to have those initials and lived in that area during the time period as well as potential for other family members potentially being involved.  I found in this journal article, the following text: ""and now stored at the State Archives in Harrisburg. These provide additional information on the 1920s — notably the names and occupations of Klan members and a very detailed series of materials on the next decade."" AND ""Loucks, Pennsylvania. This work can now be supplemented by the very substantial Klanarchives :Pennsylvania State Archives, State Police Records, RG30: Ku Klux Klan records (hereafter cited as ""Klan archive"").

The latter includes a wide selection of Klan pamphlets and newspapers.""  I have been poking around the PA State Archives Page and found these documents in The New Deal Collection, box group 30 which confirms the above mentioned statements and these do not seem to be part of ARIAS or any of the other online documents.      My specific question is: Has anyone taken inventory of the membership or even the leadership details of these 5 boxes of documents and microfilmed, digitized, or even made summary list of those documents and made it available online or something I could request via my library? OR Is anyone aware of a full list of individuals (newspaper articles mention a couple dozen only) involved on both sides of the Lilly, PA incident that may be available in now publicly available information?    Note: Yes I could hire a researcher to go and view the state Archives, but this at this point is a curiosity and am just looking for a summary document / membership list vs. details of the content and it is not in my direct line. That said I also do not plan on contacting the current form of the extremist organization for this information as I doubt if they still had records of this detail they would provide it. "
27,Requesting copies of WWII Draft Registration cards?,"Background  An ancestor of mine from Iowa should have registered for the WWII draft in the Fourth Registration, which is also known as the Old Man’s Registration.  FamilySearch has a collection for these records, but records from Iowa have not been indexed (and Iowa is not available for browsing either).  The physical copy of these draft registration cards are at the National Archives in St. Louis, MO, US.  Question  What is a cost effective way to obtain a (scanned) copy of a document from this collection?  I would prefer if I did not have to go to the National Archives myself to obtain the copy. Is there a company (or individual) that I could pay to obtain this copy on my behalf? "

The attending physician says he last saw her on August 5 (or is it 15) and that she died at 12:45am.  I'm thinking the date of death is really August 5th at 12:45 in the morning and that the death certificate incorrectly put August 18, the removal date as the date of death, but that seems a long time from the 5th to the 18th before burial, so perhaps its really the 15th.  What is the best way to determine the actual date of death here?  I couldn't find any obituaries. "
29,Exporting my tree from Ancestry without latest version of Family Tree Maker,"Is it possible to export data from Ancestry without Family Tree Maker?    I am in the very frustrating situation of having bought Family Tree Maker twice before.  The latest version I have is FTM 2010 for the Mac.    Both versions now won't connect to Ancestry and all the support relates to later versions and upgrading.  Because of this I started using just the Ancestry website directly, but realise now I am locked in, and can't get at my data without buying yet another copy of FTM and this is the only place all my data exists.  Apart from the unnecessary expense, the reviews are awful: [website]Does anyone know of any other snazzy ways of getting my data out of Ancestry? "
30,"Why use name Ebzeebra for Ebbot Millman (nee Martin) on 1840 gravestone at Marystow, Devon, England?","My 4th great grandmother Ebbot Martin was baptised on 7 Nov 1773 at Beaworthy, Devon, England.    Ebbot married John Millman on 14 Sep 1795, also at Beaworthy.  John and Ebbot had at least nine children:    William was baptised on 13 Mar 1796 at Northlew, Devon as the son of John Millman and Ibbett his Wife Susanna was baptised on 6 May 1798 at Northlew, Devon as the daughter of John Millman and Ibbott his Wife.

However, her name seemed to revert, to Ebbeat Millman of Coryton, for her burial record on 22 Dec 1840 at Marystow, Devon.  Then on her gravestone (photo courtesy of Clare Esson) a new and striking name of Ebzeebra appears with the inscription saying:     Ebzeebra wife of John Millman of the parish of Coryton Who died the   19th day of December 1840 aged 65 years ALSO of Susanna daughter of   the above and wife of William Creber who died the 25th day of May 1834   aged 36 years Where they dwelt in the mortal land     Does anyone have an idea as to why such a name would have been chosen for her grave when it does not appear to have been recorded for her anywhere else?  It may or may not be related but two of her granddaughters were named Hephzibah, presumably after her.  Furthermore, Googling ""ebzeebra"" suggests Ebbot's gravestone name has been used for no one else on the web! "
31,Searching for great grandfather Arnold Kuhn who lived in Poland then Russia?,"Is there any way to trace the origins of my great grandfather Arnold Kuhn?  He lived in poland and had a family there I believe towards the end of the 1800s and early 1900s.   At some point he moved alone to Russia and met my grandfather's mother, but they could not marry because his polish wife did not let him divorce. Consequently, my grandfather got his russian mother's name.   Arnold Kuhn died when my grandfather was still very young and they escaped at wartime to Finland where my grandfather grew up.  Is there any way to find the origins of my Polish great grandfather Arnold Kuhn and precisely where he came from?   We have a one photograph of him. "
32,Did Edward Buten change his name from Edward Bulen?,"For several years I have hit a dead end with one branch of my family tree.  My Great Grandfather Edward Buten married by Great Grandmother Elizabeth Mary Ann Dunnington in 1893 at the Islington Registry Office.  The Buten name is so rare, that nearly all records in the UK since 1893 are of members of my family.  Edward Buten's occupation is given as warehouseman/dockworker and his address is 38 Clayton Street, Islington. and was born c. 1861 Paddington, London.  I could not find any mention of Edward in any records prior to 1893, so I did it the old fashion way and looked up the address.  Living there in 1891 was Edward Bulen, b. c. 1861 Paddington, Wharf Labourer:    On balance it appears that this is the same person, although married to Louisa.  Did Edward change his name from Bulen to Buten or does this look like a transcription error? How would a professional genealogist proceed and break through this brick wall? "
33,Birth place points to Quaker Monthly Meeting,"I was perusing some in-laws to my ancestors, and noticed something interesting. One gentleman's birthplace was listed as Stillwater MM, Belmont, Ohio. I couldn't find any Stillwater in Belmont county, but then found out that the MM stands for Monthly Meeting for a Quaker congregation. The Stillwater Monthly Meeting meetinghouse is located in Barnesville, Belmont, Ohio. In other words, Stillwater MM is more of a description of which congregation you belonged to, rather than the name of place you were born (although your congregation has ties to your local geography).  I am curious about what the purpose of listing the birthplace as Stillwater MM is. Does that mean that the ancestor was born at the meetinghouse? Or just within the congregation's geographical boundaries? If the latter, then it would be more difficult to pin down a more specific location, since Stillwater MM is a boundary that extends beyond the town of Barnesville (which is just where the meetinghouse is).  I arrived at these conclusions and questions after researching for quite some time about the Quaker terminology. I was and am still confused about it, and think it might be worth disambiguating for future researchers and giving a more understandable location for those not familiar with Quaker administration.  Is anyone familiar with these types of locations for vital records? How do I interpret them?    Update (copied from comments):   Some have been quoting ""Encyclopedia of Quaker Genealogy, Vol IV, By Wm Wade Hinshaw"" for instance. Makes sense, that it's a Quaker record. Not all instances of ""Stillwater MM"" traces back to this collection, but enough do to assume that many of them might have originated there even though not cited.  "
34,Find Austrian vital records?,My grandfather was born 1931 in Deutchkreutz Austria. Are there any websites I could find any records of his (especially birth record)? I tried to look up his name in Ancestry with no luck.  Are there JRI-Poland-like websites dedicated for Austria? 
35,Searching and analyzing Valuation Rolls in Scotland in the early 20th Century?,"Whenever I find a street address for a person I'm researching, I like to look for property records to find out whatever I can about the building the person was living in.  Even when the person is a tenant rather than a property owner, there are often useful clues to be found (especially in the US, where property tax records can reveal how many units are in a multi-family dwelling).  Brief descriptions in the Family Search Research Wiki article on Scotland Land and Property and a brief page on The National Archives of Scotland talk about Valuation Rolls, a property record which ""gathered information about the ownership and tenancy of land and houses in order to raise property taxes"".    A fuller description of the records can be found at the website National Records of Scotland, which has a Research Guide and a more extensive article on how the Valuation rolls between 1855 and 1975 were divided into counties and burghs.  Sample images of the Valuation Rolls can be seen on this article Launch of the Valuation Rolls in Scotland for 1915 - March 2012. The records are searchable on Scotlands People by name, but the images are available as pay-per-view only.    My research subject is William Henry Cole, born around 1890, who can be found in other questions here.  He was a Mason, and according to the Mason Membership Cards (accessed via Ancestry.com), his mother lodge was Clyde Lodge #408 in Glasgow.  The membership secretary at his mother lodge very kindly provided an address from their records of 1 Holmhead Street, Glasgow.    My date bounds for this address are after Census Day, 1911, where he was enumerated with his family in Cheshire, and before October of 1924, where an outbound UK passenger list gives his former address in Belfast.  Given the dates of his participation with the lodge, my estimate for when this address might have been valid is somewhere around 1913.  Scotlands People has Valuation Rolls for the following years:      1875 1885 1895 1905 1915 1920 1925   Of these years, it seems likely that William Henry Cole would only appear as a tenant or inhabitant in 1915, and perhaps in 1920; in 1901, he is still living with his family, and by the time the 1925 data was collected, he was already in the US.  Searching in all places with surname Cole fixed and first names beginning with W yields 16 results in 1915, 17 results in 1920, and 15 results in 1925, none of which are 1 Holmhead Street.  Using the Advanced Search in 1915 for Holmhead and setting City: GLASGOW CITY; Parish: GLASGOW; Place: """"; Burgh: ""GLASGOW"" yields 179 records on Holmhead Street and other places which include the name Holmhead.  This yields an owner and several tenant occupiers.  If I were on a subscription website where all the images were available to view, I would collect the images for the most likely candidates from my search by name, and whatever I could find for 1 Holmhead Street for reference purposes.  But on pay-per-view, I dislike paying for images when I have no idea whether they are likely to be useful in future; if I want to pay for specific images, I have a long list of documents (wills and certificates) which have higher priority.    So I'm wondering what strategies would be best, for capturing the search results and storing them, in case I want to come back to this record set later on, and what other records might be helpful to use in conjunction with these records.  If I had gotten a hit for William Henry Cole at 1 Holmhead Street, I would have purchased the image to see what else I might find, but there's no guarantee that the William Henry Cole I found elsewhere in Glasgow is the William Henry Cole I'm looking for.   One strategy might be to make a spreadsheet of the wide by-name search and show which people show up in multiple years at the same location, and thus are likely to be too old to be my person of interest.   I also plan to collect the search results during this free access period for the address given for the William Henry Cole I found at a different address in Glasgow, in case it does turn out to be the right person.  There's no guarantee that other tenants at that address are his associates, but without a list of the names, I won't able to recognize them if they turn up in other records.  If you have experience working with Valuation Rolls, what techniques worked well for gathering and organizing the information you found during your searches and analysis? "
36,What is sibling of son-in-law or daughter-in-law called?,"Is there a term for the sibling of ones son-in-law or daughter-in-law?

38,Name of the church for this parish register?,"This is a slip that identifies the parish register for the marriage of Frédéric Cormier and Emma Tétreault (see the related question Finding Actes notariés (Notarial Acts) when Notary's name is known?).  The register is from Notre Dame de (something) in the Diocèse de Saint-Hyacinthe, but I cannot make out the name of the parish.  The locality on the record page is Richelieu, Québec.

39,What might 'pitt Zink' in 1873 South Australian diary mean?,"Below is the entry for 23 May 1873 in the diary of my 3rd great grandfather Thomas Hitchcox which was written at Fullarton, South Australia.  Thomas had emigrated from Staffordshire, England in 1854 (at age 57) where he had been a school master (at least 1821-1827), maltster and farmer.    Most of it is very easy to read but there are two words that I am uncertain of the spelling/meaning.  Weather showery Wark finished the Shed and ???? ???? on the old Stable and hung Froggatts' new Gate   The words replaced by question marks above seem to be pitt Zink but if that is their spelling then what is their meaning?  I suspect it may be something to do with putting zinc on a roof, as some sort of early galvanized iron, but would like to be more certain. "
40,Explaining risks when seeking DNA testing by cousin?,"It has recently occurred to me that I have been in intermittent contact with a second cousin who shares my father Y-DNA (subject to any mutations in the last two generations, which should be slight).  I don't believe he has ever had or considered Y-DNA, and I would like to pay for a test for him, as I have no other identified direct male descendants of my father's male line. My father, his siblings, their father and their father are all deceased and I can't identify any other candidate.  What should I say when broaching the subject to him to reassure him about his privacy/keeping control of the results and persuade him to test?   This is similar to Asking distant cousins for DNA? but the difference from that question is that I would particularly like to describe to him clearly and simply what the real risks of DNA testing are, and why some perceived risks are not risks at all. Some of these risks might be privacy risks; others might be risks from what he learns. "

42,"Why did many 19th century death certificates list age in years, months and days?","This isn't a question about any particular death certificate, but rather a general question. On modern birth certificates, say after 1950, the general style seems to be to give the date of death, the age in full years and then the date of birth. This seems quite logical.  However, on older death certificates, usually before 1900, the forms asked for the date of death and the age of the deceased in years, months and days. Why would this be done? Is there some benefit to this that I am not seeing?  Clearly, people in the 19th century did not wake up each morning telling their family ""In case I die today, I am 79 years, 10 months and 8 days old."" I assume that, like today, the relatives knew the birth date (or at least an approximation thereof), gave that to the town clerk and the clerk then manually calculated out the age for the certificate.  The obvious problem with this is that it introduces extra chances for error. In addition to a mis-remembered or misheard birth date, the clerk could make an error in arithmetic or when copying the answer over, and we as genealogists could make an error when re-computing the birth date (although I'm sure they weren't concerned with us at the time). And as I have found in my own research, arithmetic or transcription errors certainly occurred, as I have at least one death certificate from the transition period (about 1900-1950) where it asks for date of death, age in years months and days and date of birth, and the information is self-contradictory.  So given that making an error seems more likely with this practice, why was it done? Isn't the exact date of birth more important than the exact age? Or is that just a modern view?    It was pointed out to me in the comments that this might not have been a universal practice, so for clarity, I am from New England and most of my records are from New Hampshire and Massachusetts, with a smattering from Vermont and Rhode Island.  This is an example of the usual format, from NH, with the age in years/months/days and no birth date. The latest example of this style that I found from a quick scan through my images was from 1916.   And this is an example of a self-contradictory death certificate. It gives the date of death as June 5, 1912, the age as 89 years, 9 months and 13 days and the date of birth as August 23, 1822. However, if you use an online calculator and subtract the age from the date of death, you get a birth date of September 23, 1822.  As to how these dates and ages were calculated, I'm not entirely sure. Today there are formulas such as this one ([website]Of course, there is another potential wrinkle in all this. Suppose the deceased was born in New Hampshire in 1740 and died in 1820, living through the Julian to Gregorian switch. The clerk is given a birth date and calculates the age. He could calculate the right age. Or, the family could give him the Julian date and he could fail to account for the missing 11 days. Or they could give him a date that was already converted to Gregorian, but he could accidently convert it a second time, putting his result off by three weeks.  As you can see, the potential pitfalls of doing this are nearly endless. "

44,Does having child of DNA tested parent help find parent's DNA ancestors?,"If a parent (Charlie, a male) has been autosomal tested, and does not have either of his deceased parents (Alice and Bob) tested, and thus he does not have his autosomal DNA phased between their mother (Alice) and father (Bob), does testing one or more children of Charlie (Dick, Elizabeth, Frank, and George) help with phasing Charlie?    What if some of Charlie's children (Frank and George) are with a different spouse of Charlie than the others (Dick and Elizabeth), does that help more?  Are there any tools to help with this phasing like we see with GEDmatch giving phased results for Charlie when a parent (Alice or Bob) is tested only we want to phase Charlie, using the aid of his tested children, Dick, Elizabeth, Frank, and George.

45,"Finding parents of John Brown 1774-1845 born Kingsbury Episcopi, Somerset, England?","Henry Brown was born 1746 who I have attributed to being the father of John Brown. The records show he was a sojouner and agricultural labourer, so he was down as a sojourner as he probably traveled around going from farm to farm where workers were needed for the plowing or harvest but returning home between times., and from the parish point of view he would not be entitled to any poor relief.   He married a Mary WILLY from Kingsbury Episcopi but where did he come from?   Have I attributed the wrong father to John?   John first married Ann MEAD and shortly after her death in 1799 he married Elizabeth MUNCKTON.  "

I need to take a lot of notes about the various members and I need to see the pedigree in a semi-graphical manner while taking these notes and making comparisons.  An actual pedigree chart has become impossible to manage.  I got to thinking that perhaps a spreadsheet would be more efficient, but I've been hitting walls with whether to orient it vertically or horizontally since both have their advantages / disadvantages.  Has anyone had a familiar experience where a lot of information and research is going on simultaneously that needs to be captured with a somewhat visual representation of the relationships?    If so, what worked for you?    Are there better methods than a spreadsheet? "

I have a picture of my Great Great Grandfather he definitely looks Chinese, his father was 100 percent Chinese and he married a Native American they would be my Great Great Great Grandparents, why am I not showing any percentage of Asian or Native American on my results?  If my father were tested would it possibly show up on him since it would be his Great Great Grandfather? "
50,Half siblings using cMs (centimorgans),I used ancestry to obtain my results.  I found my 1st cousins and aunt on my father's side.  The process of elimination resulted that this one young lady has to be my sister but she came up my 1st cousin. There is no other men to test.  Looking at the range given for 1st cousins she is outside the perimeters.      Our shared cMs is 1170 which is outside the perimeters of 1st cousins but not quite in the perimeters of half-siblings.    1st cousin amount of cMs is between 680-1150 Halfsibling amount of cMs is between 1450-2050  What about the amounts outside the range?    Is she likely to be my sister? 
51,Using DNA to link individuals after a name change,"How do I go about using genetic testing to support (or disprove) the identity of an individual before a name change?  My great-great-grandfather, Everett T Malcom, would just say, ""It's me own business"" whenever someone asked him about his parents, siblings, or personal history before he turned up in Utah in about 1888. What little information his only child, Glendora, was able to glean from him hasn't turned up any matches for the names he gave for parents and siblings. Glendora reports his parents' names as ""John Malcom"" and ""Jane Stokes"".  It's widely thought among my relatives that Everett must have changed his name when he moved west, for whatever reason, and cut off ties with his past life.  A likely candidate for his original identity is Mark Ellsworth Templin, son of John Wesley Templin and Jane Stokes of Goshen, Mahoning, Ohio. The strongest match here is that the maiden names of John Templin's two previous wives match the maiden names for John Malcom's two previous wives, as reported by Glendora. Additionally, several given names of siblings match, and the timeline and geography work out well (for details, please see discussion on Family Search Tree).  Could genetic testing be helpful in supporting (or disproving) the theory that Everett T Malcom and Mark Ellsworth Templin are one and the same? If so, what strategies would be most helpful? Everett T Malcom's closest living relative is a grandson (my great-uncle). Mark Ellsworth Templin's son, Charles, doesn't appear to have left any children, based on his wife's obituary. Should I contact descendants of Mark's siblings and ask them for their genetic info to compare with my great-uncle? What are the names of the tests for this that I should look for when shopping for a DNA company? "
52,"How can genetic relatives be related to both maternal and paternal sides, but not each other?","I am completely ignorant to all of the genetics of ancestry, although I have a keen interest in family history.  I did a DNA test through 23andme, as did my mother and a paternal aunt.  In my list of DNA relatives I noticed that there are at least 4 people who are genetically related to me, my mom and my paternal aunt.  These 4 people are not genetically related to each other. Nor is my paternal aunt related to my mom. How can this be?   Additionally, a different person that I am genetically related to (we may share 3rd great grandparents) does not appear to be genetically related to my mom or my paternal aunt.    Could someone please explain this to me in layman's terms? "
53,"Statistical Genealogy, or Knowing what is an extraordinary claim","It is often said in genealogy (or any field of research, really) that “extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence”. Fair enough. But how does one know what is an extraordinary claim? We can extrapolate from our own experience and society, but our ancestors often lived in very different times and circumstances. What might seem extraordinary or strange to us might have been quite common to them and vice versa.   I'm a moderator on the Mathematica.SE site, so I’m aware of the social network analysis capabilities in Mathematica, even though I’ve never really used them. They, and a recent post on Stephen Wolfram’s blog got me thinking about the genealogical equivalent.   The big sites like Ancestry.com, Familysearch.org and FindMyPast.co.uk have all collected literally millions of trees and built up profiles of tens of millions of individuals and families. It seems obvious that one could build up statistical statements about what was most common historically, and then people could compare their current hypotheses about their own ancestors to these statements to help decide if they are making “extraordinary claims”. I’ll give some examples to show what I mean. Bear in mind that the following are all completely made up, but are the sort of thing I had in mind:     15% of men and 16% of women born in 18th century England married more than once; only 2% of either men or women married more than twice. ( ok so my great^4 grandmother probably didn't marry five times and those are different Alice Smiths... )   Or:     94% of people who were not nobility born in Kent between 1650 and 1800 married someone born within twenty miles of them. Less than 1% married someone born more than 50 miles away. ( ok so I can probably rule out that baptism from Lancashire as being for my great^5 grandfather who married and died in Dorset...)   Or:     Only 10% of men born in the 1700s in England who subsequently married did so for the first time after they turned 30, and if their parents married before the age of 25, only 3% married after the age of 30. ( hmm, so my great^5 uncle is probably that guy, not that guy who married eight years later. So his wife is most likely to be this woman not that one...)   So my question is: has anyone done this, even over a restricted field such as a particular century or country? Surely there is a statistically-minded Mormon over at FamilySearch or wherever who has thought of doing this? While the exceptional cases clearly can still have happened, it would surely help people formulate their hypotheses if they had an idea how likely or unlikely certain outcomes might have been.  EDIT  Lots of good responses in the answers and comments. I agree that the data are very dirty. But I'm an economist and thus used to dealing with messy, poorly measured data. The question is whether the errors in the data are enough to materially skew the kinds of statistical statements I have in mind. I can imagine that there would be some skew away from correct conclusions that happened to be unusual (the thrice-married woman, the 17th century couple born 100 miles apart etc). But for a lot of things, the errors in people’s trees would cancel each other out. I think this is the difference between a statistical approach and an historical approach. "
54,Locating a 20th century New York Death record,"My Spanish great uncle was born Salvador Mouris Campos and naturalized as Compos.  He was born July 1, 1886 and traveled from Havana to New York in 1917. Was subsequently drafted for WW1 that year. In WW2 at the age of 56 in 1942 I have a record that he was also drafted and in 1951 he was naturalized at the age of 65.  All the addresses I have are for him living in NY.

55,Dixie Kiefer died on a mountain. Should I include the mountain's name in the place of death?,"I discovered this weekend that Dixie Kiefer is my first cousin three times removed. Dixie was a well known, respected, and battered Navy commander. After surviving the sinking of the Yorktown and at Midway and two kamikaze attacks on the Ticonderoga, he died when his Navy transport plane crashed into Beacon Mountain, New York.  How do I record the place of his death?  The trivial answer is ""Beacon Mountain, New York, United States"", and that's how I recorded it in the FamilySearch Family Tree, but I'm concerned about the ability of place authorities to know where that is. FamilySearch's place authority doesn't recognize it because their authority only has administrative places and not geographical features (or so I believe).  Beacon Mountain is technically in the town of Fishkill. Should I record the place of death as ""Fishkill, Dutchess County, New York, United States""?   I could be very specific and say ""Beacon Mountain, Fishkill, Dutchess County, New York, United States"". Would most place authorities be smart enough to ignore the ""Beacon Mountain"" part of that and keep the rest?  "
56,"Strategy for distinguishing between two possible baptisms, and thus people, parents, etc.?","My partner has an ancestor, Peggy Crossley, probably born around 1750, who married Henry Rawlinson in Burnley, Lancaster (source) in October 1767.  I have two candidate baptismal records that seem plausible, though neither of them have any link to the James Crosley who witnessed the marriage.   daughter of John Crosley baptised 14 Oct 1750 in Heptonstall, Yorkshire, about 13 miles from Burnley daughter of Abram and Ann Crossley, baptised 23 Sep 1750 in Rochdale, Lancashire, about 16 miles from Burnley.   I have no particular reason to favour one or the other possibility, and this far back there aren't many other records to go on.  Does anyone have any suggestions for approaches to take to help work out which is the right one? If it helps, I'm pretty sure the other one married a William Howorth, also in Burnley. "
57,Who are the Ancestors of William Yensull?,"William Yensull (also spelled Yensule or Yencule) became a Naturalized Citizen of the United States on April 20th, 1896. Based on his Naturalization Certificate, issued in the Illinois county of Christian, he was previously a citizen of Russia and it has been documented as his place of birth.   It is estimated that he was born in 1875 based on an Illinois Miners Certificate, issued on the 1st of October 1915, and the Naturalization Certificate. He married Kazy Kaserovich (aka Cassie Zelenski) in Saint Louis on the 27th of October 1914.  William lived in Illinois for at least 20 years but died in Ohio the 7th of January 1934. I'd like to find information on his parents (or other relatives), but mostly, any information that allows tracking him from Russia to America.  To complicate William's lineage further, there is talk that his mother was of Navajo descent and, though William was born in Russia, his father had met his mother in America and brought her to Russia.

58,"Jacob Fisher and Sarah Hodges (married in 1773 in Sharon, MA) - who were their childen?","Page 27 of the Sharon, Massachusetts Vital Records show Jacob Fisher and his wife Sarah had a son Jacob born 30 Apr 1776:  Jacob, s. of Jacob and Sarah, Apr. 30, 1776   Page 94 of those records show a marriage record of Jacob Fisher to Sarah Hodges on 7 Oct 1773:  Fisher ... Jacob and Sarah Hodges Oct 7, 1773.   I am interested in who are the children of Jacob Fisher and Sarah Hodges. I am presuming they are the same as the parents in the previous record so one child is Jacob born 1776. But the question holds even if they are different.   Through the DNA testing, I found I shared common DNA with someone. We both have Fishers in our ancestry (my paternal grandmother). However we have not yet been able to connect the dots and so we are trying to extend our Fisher line to find common overlap. The reason for asking about the children is look for links with my shared-dna correspondent. Note if we can find a potential connection, the dna evidence may be collaborating, non-definitive, evidence. "
59,"Confirming Ancestry.com tree information about Anthony White (b. 1700, Luenbeg, Scotland)?","I realize that ancestry.com is a mix of user input and archived records, but as a programmer I firmly believe in the GIGO theory (Garbage in, garbage out).  I have gone through hints and trees, and I am fairly certain (90% probability) of the correctness of the information through about 4 or 5 generations, since this is corroborated by family records/verbal history.  Going back to about the 7th/8th generation back, I have found some ancestors that have the title Sir (Sir James White and Sir Thomas White, Luenbeg, Scotland, brothers to my great x6 grandfather), and I am interested in finding out more about them in particular (Everyone wants to be noble, hey?)  How do I go about make sure what I've connected on ancestry.com back that far is correct? What is/should be my next step(s)?  More information:  Direct ancestor:   Anthony White, B 1700 Luenbeg, Scotland. Wife - Mary Ralston (And a google search for Luenbeg matches several trees with the same information, although more than a few have it as ""Luenbeg"", so unverifiable information).  Brothers:    Sir James White, B 1695 Paisley, Renfrewshire, Scotland.  Sir Thomas White, B 1726 Lurgan, Armagh Ireland Alexander White B 1702, Scotland.   Evidently they all came to the US (date unknown) and died in Pennsylvania in the 1770 range. "
60,Searching for 1948 C&EI Railroad Employee?,"My mother never knew her father. She was the product of a very ""brief"" relationship that took place when my 16 year old grandmother was visiting her grandparents in Evansville, Indiana from Washington state. I am assuming that she met my grandfather (a C&amp;EI Railroad Employee) while she was taking the train to Indiana.   Here are the ""Facts"" that she had given us before she died:  This man's name was private (but I have first name, middle initial and surname), he was 21 years old (in 1948) and he worked for C&amp;EI as a brakeman and/or Fireman (She has said both in different accounts). He worked at the Evansville roundhouse. She would visit him at work during the weeks/month that she was staying at her Grandparents.  She goes back to Washington and discovers she's pregnant. She writes a letter to the sheriff in Evansville (why, I have no idea) asking him to ""pass it on"" to the father to let him know shes expecting. She never gets a reply. She writes the sheriff again to tell the father that she had a girl. Again, no response.   That's all we have been told. My mother was born in November of 48, so that means that my grandmother was in Evansville during Feb-Mar of 48 where she met this guy. I have looked at Evansville city directories, C&amp;EI Employee magazines from the early fifties, census records, contacted the C&amp;EI Historical society, poured over the Browning Genealogy site - you name it and I am getting nowhere.  The ONLY person of the right name (According to C&amp;EI Historical society) that worked for C&amp;EI (As a brakeman interestingly enough) did live in Evansville - BUT he would have been 55+ years old - I mean that's quite the age difference from a 16 year old girl.   Why would she have lied about his age? Embarrassment I guess?   I have made contact with the grandchildren of this person and while they admit that the family was pretty messed up they are doubtful that this was the man who fathered my mother. The only other lead I got out of that is that this family were related to two other families in the area - one of whom shared the same forename as my grandfather who fit the age (would have been 21 in 1948) and was a ""rounder"" with the women as they called him. He also worked as a brakeman for C&amp;EI in evansville - problem is, in the 1948 city directory his occupation is ""driver"" with no company listed, and doesnt show up at C&amp;EI until 1951.  The main questions I have are:   Could he have just completely lied about his name and gotten away with it? I'm assuming he would have had a name badge at work and coworkers calling him by his real name so that's doubtful. I have thought about the possibility that my grandmother was making a bunch of stuff up but really, and I mean this nicely, she just wasn't bright enough to be so elaborate and have such detail about the whole thing. So all I have for possibilities at this point are:   1) It WAS the 55 year old  - but the age gap  2) It was the 21 year old (b 1927 d 2007) - but not sure he was even at C&amp;EI in 48 and then there's the whole completely different name thing  3) It was some other person of the same name who fits her exact description and he died/disappeared/moved away shortly thereafter?  Oh and just for fun - My grandmother spelled the surname with an ""E"" at the end but the family I found don't. But I've gotten nowhere with that either. "
61,Does Ancestry.com have a developer API?,"I'd like to access to access data programmatically on Ancestry.com.  Other sites provide their own APIs for this: e.g. MyHerigate has the Family Graph API [website]I can't find any indication that such an API exists on the Ancestry web site, but there is at least one site that seems to make use of such API: myCanvas.com.  if I select the ""Family History Books"" from the menu on MyCanvas and then click on one of the book options I get this: ""We can use your family tree from Ancestry to automatically build your book or poster. This is the easiest way to get started on your family history book or poster. If you would like to use your Ancestry tree, please log in using your Ancestry account now.""  So it seems the API exists, but maybe it's private?  Does Ancestry.com have a developer API? And if so, how can I get access to it? "
62,Are there any published guidelines for organizing a family narrative other than in the Register-style generation-by-generation format?,"The common format I've seen for published family trees (e.g., Register-style) start with a particular ancestral couple and move forward generation by generation.  This has the advantage that the numbers run in sequence, but I've found that it can be difficult reading for non-genealogists, as grandparents, parents, and children may be scattered throughout.  I'm considering organizing a narrative that traces each line from top to bottom rather than generation by generation (vertically rather than horizontally - I would have said ""depth-first"", bit it isn't quite).  If I use the Register-style numbering, the numbers would be out of sequence, but I'm hoping that a complete name/number index will compensate.  My question is: are there any published guidelines for organizing a family narrative in this way?  Or even a good published example of such?  I've seen some published genealogies where the primary surname line(s) were presented in the standard way, but with other lines presented separately.  I'm looking for something more general than that, if possible. "
63,"Tracing child adopted from Washington County, Tennessee Poor Farm in the 1930s?","I am looking for a 3rd cousin. I have been working on ancestry information, and came across a close family member Florence who was adopted out.  She was born in 1927 in Johnson City, Tennessee. In the early 1930's her parents divorced, and the mother took the 3 children they had together.   Her mother placed them on a Poor Farm for temporary care while she went to Washington DC to look for work. When she came back for her children, Florence had been adopted out.  I have been in touch with the Grandchildren of Florence's sister, Louise and what I know so far is:   I tried submitting to the state of Tennessee for them to give me her adoption records (with Florence's great nephew's listed on there in case they needed to contact them), and they denied my claim saying that I am not a qualified applicant. They continue to allude to the fact that she may have been a black market adoption (which is what I have suspected all along). The Poor Farm that Florence and her siblings were put into was most likely run by an Uncle on their Grandmother's side, but they wouldn't have known it. Reason being that their father's mother put her own 2 boys up for adoption after their father was shot and killed and then split.  Florence &amp; Louise's mother had another family with another man. All this happened in Johnson City, Tennessee.  The only reason I know that the Poor Farm was most likely one run by an Uncle is because I have made contact with my Great Great Grandmother's side of the family (she was 1 of 28 children) and have learned some that way.   She is likely now deceased, but I just want to know what happened to Florence C. ??? and who adopted her and name she took? "
64,Jensen vs Jorgensen: Last Name for Danish,"I am using FamilySearch, and have found a marriage where there are two husbands. I am questioning if these are duplicates. They have the same first name (Anders), but different last names. These last names are Jensen and Jorgensen. As far as I have seen, these two Danish names have been common throughout history. Are these the same names and people, or are they indeed different people?  Also, what is generally the case?  To answer Harry Vervet's question, that is exactly how FamilySearch shows it.  Here are the vitals:  Anders Jorgensen:   Birth: 7 Aug 1815 - Bojskov, Tyrsrup, Hdsl, Den Death: 10 Dec 1875 - Oksenvadmark, Oksenvad, Hdsl, Den Marriage: 7 Nov 1845 - Jels, Hdsl, Den   Meta Christina Kjaergaard:   Birth: 12 Mar 1823 - Grongaard, Nustrup, Hdsl, Den Death: unknown Marriage: same as previous   NOTE: I do not speak Danish "
65,"Finding archival records for tracing father of illegitimate child in mid 1880s County Down, Ireland?","In a couple of weeks, I will be travelling to Ireland for a two-week vacation.  Part of my trip will be spent in the Belfast area, visiting both the General Register Office for Northern Ireland (GRONI) and the Public Record Office for Northern Ireland (PRONI).  One of the more interesting research questions I intend to investigate concerns a John Bigham, whose birth certificate from 1886 lists only his mother's name -- Mary Nelson Bigham.  On the 1901 census, however, I find him living with his maternal grandparents, but his surname is given as McGaffin.  I can find no record of a marriage between Mary Bigham and a McGaffin in the intervening period; indeed, I can find no definitive record of John's mother post his birth certificate.  However, John continued to use the McGaffin name right up to his death.  While McGaffin is a relatively rare name in Ireland (even with spelling variations factored in), there are a number of candidates in the local and neighbouring parishes.  I'm therefore looking for additional records to narrow the field and bring further clarity to the situation.  What was the Irish practice in cases of illegitimacy in this timeframe?  Was it similar to the ""bastardy bonds"" issued in England; if so, do these records survive today?  What should I be looking for at PRONI?  (Or, alternatively, in records that may be in the National Archives in Dublin?)  Are there any other records which might be of use to me?  I understand school records from the period are kept at PRONI, which could afford some insight into parents/guardianship. "
66,Is there an archive of Polish or Hungarian passport applications from 1900-1940 from New York consulates?,"I'm wondering if anyone knows if there are archives which contain Polish passport applications or Hungarian passport applications from respective consulates in New York between 1900 and 1940. Would they be available in any archives in Poland and/or Hungary/Sweden, or does such a collection likely not exist?  In terms of Hungary, according to Rodakiewicz, Erla (1919) Foreign-born: A Bulletin of International Service (page 22) and A Guide to the United States' History of Recognition, Diplomatic, and Consular Relations, by Country, since 1776: Hungary from the Office of the Historian at the US State Department's website, there was not a Hungarian consulate in New York until 1922.   Here is an example of a Hungarian passport issued by the Swedish Legation in 1920. "
67,Accessing returns from the Marriage Duty Act (1695)?,"In The Oxford Companion to Family and Local History, on the subject of the Marriage Duty Act (1695), David Hey writes:      A tax on 'Marriages, Births and Burials and upon Bachelors and   Widowers for the term of five years' lasted eleven years, from 1695 to   1706. The tax on vital events was charged as and when they occurred. Bachelors aged over 25 and childless widowers made an annual payment.   Members of families in receipt of alms were exempt. A complete   enumeration of the population was required for the efficient   administration of this tax. A comprehensive listing of surviving   returns by Christine Vialls is available at the Institute of Heraldic   and Genealogical Studies, Canterbury.   The parish registers and other transcripts for a particular Nottinghamshire parish of interest to me do not survive before about 1710, so I am eager to learn if other sources exist which may be helpful in tracing a particular pair of ancestors who married in about 1700.  I understand that the survival of returns under the Marriage Duty Act is quite poor, but I am unsure how to determine if returns exist for my parish of interest. As far as I am aware, the returns would be archived locally, however I have had no success finding any mention of these returns in the Nottinghamshire Archives Catalogue.  The next obvious step is looking at that ""comprehensive listing of surviving returns by Christine Vialls"" mentioned in the above book. However at present I have no opportunity to visit IHGS to look at this listing.  How can I locate Marriage Duty Act tax returns for Notts? Or alternatively, how might I access Vialls's listing without visiting IHGS – in other words is it accessible elsewhere? "

Campbell would be a friend or relative of the family or someone with a business connection to them.  For context, the parents of the deceased (M.E. Folkes) were Lyman Jairus Strong and Martha H.

My parents and grandparents are all deceased. My dad was an only child.   I can trace and connect with cousins on my mother's side and only my grandmother on my dad's side. My DNA matches all have a last name in common that I do not have.   I am beginning to think that my dad is my dad, but my grandpa is not my biological grandpa. So... I am not sure where to go from here in my family history.  My question is if you match on your DNA with other's that are 1st or 2nd generations then how could that show up if we don't share a common relative?  If you are 1 generation, does that mean cousin or could it be sibling?   Could this Autosomal DNA test be wrong in its relationships? "

We uploaded our results to Gedmatch and it just confirmed that information.   I uploaded my daughter's results to compare to him and she shares 1100 centiMorgans with him (but no cm on the X).  We are trying to figure out with certainty if we actually are 1/2 siblings.  Is his father my biological father?

I have no matches for my surname.  Other than that one match, I get no matches until yDNA-12 that has 129 matches.  Does this suggest that my area of the tree is just not tested much at Family Tree so far?  Is this common?

78,Determining location/address of Robert John Steven Sellers in 1900 from Sands and Macdougall Directory for South Australia?,"Relatively recently I have discovered what a wealth of information is available about my South Australian ancestors in the annual Boothby and then Sands and Macdougall Directories from 1864 to 1973 that are available online to view for free at the State Library of South Australia web site.  What I am yet to discover is how to distinguish residential from business addresses and how to interpret the street names and numbers?  I am aware of this warning from the web site above:     Things to remember:         From 1873 a street by street listing was compiled for the city, listing both businesses and private dwellings by location. Note that   street numbers in the city have changed at least twice.      Here I will use just one directory and one of my ancestors to see if someone has any advice on how to interpret them.  These are two entries in the Sands and Macdougall Directory for 1900 that I believe correspond to my 2nd great grandfather Robert John Steven Sellers/Sellars about whom I have previously asked:   Was Robert John Steven Sellers first to cycle Adelaide to Melbourne? What churches in/near Ward 6, Albany, New York State might have baptized Scottish baby in 1854? Finding New York City/State records relating to Sellars family (British subjects) births/deaths mid 19th century?   Although he was born in Albany, New York, USA of Scottish parents, the entries below are from Adelaide, South Australia where he spent most of his adult life.    On page 23/1182 (in the ALPHABETICAL STREET DIRECTORY) I find an entry 160 Sellars, R, civil service and on the previous page there is a subheading of Regent st under a larger heading of Halifax st - N side    On page 881/1182 (in the ALPHABETICAL DIRECTORY) I find another entry SELLARS R J. S., draughtsman, 160 Halifax St    Read together I am confident that his occupation is Draughtsman and his employer is the Civil Service - this corresponds to much other information I have about him.  I am not certain whether his address is residential or work (but I suspect the former) and whether at that time it was 160 Regent Street or 160 Halifax Street (I think the latter).  Does someone perhaps know how to turn the above address information into a modern Adelaide street address that I could look at via Google StreetView or next time I am in Adelaide?  If the above corresponds to 160 Halifax Street, Adelaide, South Australia today then I think clicking here has you looking at it. "
79,"What might occupation of ""public school"" mean in 1885 Sands and Macdougall Directory (for South Australia)?","Below is an image from the Sands and Macdougall Directory in South Australia for 1885 which lists Sellars Louisa, public school, Hindmarsh on page 388/984.    Hindmarsh is an inner suburb of Adelaide, and my great grandmother Louisa Margaret Sellers was born on 29 Dec 1878 at Medindie (another inner suburb of Adelaide).  I think this may be her, but I am wondering how to interpret ""public school"" because I am used to entries in these directories usually referring to heads of households (who were then most often adult males) and that part of the entry being an occupation.  Her father, Robert John Steven Sellers, does not appear to have been listed in 1885, but in 1884 he was at Young Street, Parkside (another inner suburb of Adelaide) and in 1886 he was at Halifax Street, Adelaide. Louisa Sellars is not listed in either of those two years but in 1886 she seems to have been replaced by a Lavinia R. Sellars (public school, Hindmrsh; who may be worth me investigating further).      I am not yet certain that this Louisa Sellars and my great grandmother Louisa Margaret Sellers/Sellars are the same person and so I am after advice purely on how to interpret the entry.    Does it perhaps mean/suggest:   Louisa Sellars was living at a public school in Hindmarsh (and her parents elsewhere)? Louisa Sellars was attending a public school in Hindmarsh (and living with her parents elsewhere)? Louisa Sellars was attending a public school (i.e. was a student) somewhere and living in Hindmarsh (presumably with her parents)? or something else?  "
80,How to reach out to strangers that could be relatives from an illegitimate birth?,"I am trying to determine the best approach to reach out to a group of people that may be related to my immediate family but these people could be surprised by the news.  After my grandparent's death, my mother discovered that her father was not her biological father.  The only record we have is the biological father's name listed as the father on my mother's birth certificate.  There are other details but that information is beyond the scope of this question.  The biological father passed away in 2002.  I know through research that he had 5 children and we believe 4 are still alive.  I have what we believe to be their physical addresses and would like to reach out to them, not for any monetary reason, but for information about the man only.  I know this could be quite a shock to them to learn after 50 years that they might have a sister and other family they had no idea about.  For that matter the biological father might not have even known since he was in the army during this time and may have gone overseas before the pregnancy was known.  So the question is...  Do I write and send a certified letter to each of the surviving children?  Do I hire a third party... say a lawyer... to be the intermediary and don't contact them directly?  Any other suggestions?  I just wanted to pose this question to this group and see what opinions others might have on this approach.  Thank you "

83,What records document how African Americans received their Surname in early New York state?,"My understanding is that pre-American revolution New York state had free blacks and slaves, then during the war both sides offered freedom to those that fought. Eventually, in 1799 slavery was officially 'phased out' by those being born after the date and those becoming indentured servants while in many cases conditions remained the same until the mid-1820s or so.  My question is what was the practice of these individuals obtaining their Surname and how was it documented (i.e 'freedom paperwork', 'release from indentured servitude', etc) specifically in New York state (even more specifically outside of New York City, such as the Hudson Valley) as I realize conditions were different in different areas.   Such as was    Chosen for them They chose Did they automatically get the name of their employer / owner?   Note: There are both articles supporting and contradicting this theory.  Other...?   and were there any 'guidelines or rules' for this?  I ask as in my research during this period and following it I see individuals appearing as African American on the census and other records, but the rest of the family in the area as well as its origins through today are mostly Caucasian except for the descendants of these individuals. I would like to determine the relationship in which they came about the name.  For example:     Kingston, New York there are Palatine Souser's from a German speaking region of Europe dating back until at least 1732 (and likely before), then in the 1850 Census two land owning African American Souser households appear ungrouped from other Souser's with the eldest having birth year of 1794. In that same census but far separated in pages are the Caucasian Souser's also owning land in that area. There are then various other African American Souser's that appear in newspaper articles and censuses through at least the 1930s in Saugerties, NY and New York City in parallel to the Caucasian Souser's as well as the African American line survives today.    The only indication of any Souser I have found to date of a slave in any household in any period or location is in the 1790 Census of a Souser household showed 1 slave of unknown gender or age (which I am embarrassed by) in a household of 4 whites. From what I can tell they Souser's of the period were middle class with being farmers, a mill worker, a tavern owner, and a constable. That head of household listed with a slave I believe died in 1808 and none of the individuals listed on the 1850 census are listed on the abstract of his will nor any record I have found to date, but it is very plausible the individuals listed in the 1850 census are descendants due to the 60 year difference of that 1 slave listed.   So I am looking for clues, guidelines, or at least establish theories on how the name was acquired to help guide further research rather than taking shots in the dark or resorting to more expensive genetic testing that may be inconclusive. I will add as far as I am aware at this time none were recorded as mulatto.   So again to clarify scope of what I am asking: What were the practices of the day, in the context of New York State, for African Americans to receive their surname  / last name and how was it documented?

84,"Is it proper to record the place name ""United States of America"" or ""USA"" as part of a historical event that pre-dates 1776?","   Possible Duplicate:   Should I use the modern (what it is called now) or historical (what it was called) place name?       I use Family Tree Maker which always tries to get me to accept ""USA"" in a place name regardless of the time of the event. Why would such a widely-used program ""insist"" on this method of data entry unless is is acceptable? I strip off the USA and ""Ignore"" the program's correction. Antiquarian place names (eg. Massachusetts Bay Colony) are not even in the database. Help me sleep better by affirming my thinking. "
85,Merchant marine - how to research people who worked on ships?,"I am researching a relative who disappears from conventional genealogical records. He married and fathered children regularly until his wife died but does not appear in census records with his family nor in city directories. Family lore says that he was a seaman working ships traveling between Philadelphia and Houston in the 1860-1880 period. How do I research the merchant marine? What online record sources are there of seamen? What offline sources do I check, for instance, the National Archives or LDS microfilm? If, as the family assumes, he died at sea, how do I document that?  The specifics are  Francis McCloskey born 1840-ish in Ireland immigrated to Philadelphia, date unknown married Ellen Lafferty in 1863 seven children were born between 1864 and 1873; four died as infants, three were living when the wife died in a fire in 1873. Of the three living children, one was adopted by a relative and two were put in an orphan home.   Where was the father when the mother died and why didn't he take care of the children? When did he die and where?  "
86,Determining if soldier in US Civil War was German mercenary?,"I am looking for ways to determine if Civil War soldiers were hired mercenaries. I know the name of my great-great grandfather only from a census record when he was living with his son. From that 1880 census I also have his approximate age. From city directories I know he lived in Philadelphia from 1875- 1891.  His son Emanuel (my great-grandfather), when being interviewed after being awarded a silver star, told stories to the reporter of ""his grandfather who fought against Napoleon at Waterloo, or of his father who fought for the Union under Lincoln and later ag[ai]nst France under Bismark."" (From newsclipping). Emanuel told those same stories to my father as a child. These are my only hints to find my great-great grandfather, or anyone before him in that line.  Supposing the war stories told by my great-grandfather about his father are true, how could I go about finding a Frederick Ziegler who fought in the Civil War (there were many) from Wurtemburg (still quite a few) but who was a paid mercenary who returned to Germany to fight in the Franco-Prussian War (1870-1871)?  While it is possible he immigrated and joined the army right off the boat, it seems more likely that he was a paid mercenary because he returned (according to the stories) to Germany to fight in the Franco-Prussian War. Any suggestions? "
87,"What is the significance of a ""right of dower"" in this 1830s era deed (Ohio/New Hampshire, USA)?","Working with 19th-century deeds, I often find the wife has executed the deed in what is described as an act of relinquishing her ""right of Dower.""  (Corrections to the way I have described that execution are welcome.)  Below is an example of one such deed, ca1830. The relevant clause reads, ""And I Asenath Preston wife of the said William Preston in consideration aforesaid do hereby relinquish my right of Dower in the before mentioned premises.""   I'm interested both in what Asenath was ""relinquishing"" and why.  The deed obviously calls Asenath his wife, but is there any other meaning can be drawn from the wife's act to ""relinquish her right of Dower.""    As to the second part of the question, some context/back story. For ten years, we could not find evidence about how William Preston of Defiance, Ohio, had acquired the subject property interest in Rumney, New Hampshire.1 Knowing that William and Asenath had married in 1820, at one time I hoped Asenath's release of dower might provide a clue about when and/or in what hame the interest had been acquired.2   Graphic follows; click HERE to view a resizable version of the deed.     1 The 1829 sale (this deed) identified the underlying property only as ""the lands which Jabes H. Weld &amp; Oliver F. Weld conveyed to Daniel Easton by their deed dated 21st Nov A.D. 1803 &amp; recorded in the Register of Deeds for [Grafton County book 37, p. 557]. Even intense research in the Grafton deed books did not provide any related transaction between William Preston and either the Welds, their business or Daniel Eaton.  2 At the time, I asked myself questions like this:   The entry for this deed in the registry book does not carry the wife's name (it reads, ""William Preston to Collins Preston""). Is my understanding correct that she was not a ""grantor"" of the deed, even though her signature (or mark) appears? (Including that when I cite this source, the deed is described as ""William Preston to Collins Preston,"" not ""William and Asenath Preston to Collins Preston."") Does ""Dower"" attach regardless of when the property was acquired (before or during a marriage), or would it only attached if the property had been acquired before the marriage? Only if acquired during the marriage? If a wife releases her Dower, does that mean the property had been held by the husband as his ""sole and separate"" asset?  Would the wife have had a right of Dower if she had been a co-owner? What if the couple had held the property as joint tenants (joint tenancy)?  What if the property had been held by the wife? Would the husband have been required to release his ""dower?""  "

89,When does an alternate spelling due to spelling reform warrant preservation?,"In comments on a question about whether to use historical or modern place names, @LennartRegebro raised the interesting question of spelling reform, and whether it was fine to use reformed spelling for place names in languages that experienced such reform (e.g., Swedish, German, Russian).   It occurred to me that while at first glance the answer seems inconsequential (it probably does it matter if you use ß or ss in German), in some cases the answer may not be so obvious. For example, what is the correct way to handle to romanized Chinese names (as rendered in English)? Is it appropriate to use the modern spelling standard called Pinyin, introduced in 1956, for names associated with events that occurred prior to 1956, when the Wade-Giles romanization was the dominant standard? "
90,Is there a transcription standard that separates unclear words from added words?,"Right from the beginning I picked up the habit of adding [square brackets] round unclear or illegible words / letters in transcriptions and &lt; angle brackets > round words / letters that I added myself to make the transcript clearer. However, I am totally unclear where I got this idea from and I have never found anyone else advocating this standard.   As I wish to continue to distinguish the two cases, I intend to carry on doing it and will explain my convention in a note to the transcript. But I'd like to justify it if I can - so can anyone point me to a standard that distinguishes the two? Or justify why I shouldn't do so?  Example for clarity: I would transcribe a will with an unclear signature from the testator thus:  ""This is the Last Will and Testament of ... ... ... &lt; signed > John [Dee]"" The word ""&lt; signed >"" is not present in the original text, it simply indicates that the name following is a signature. ""[Dee]"" represents text that is unclear so it could be our old friend John Doe.   Many books would transcribe this as  ""This is the Last Will and Testament of ... ... ... [signed] John [Dee]"" This would leave me to query whether the word ""signed"" is present in the original text (as it could be if I were transcribing what is already a transcription).  Grateful for any thought on this distinction. "

94,"Does ""in the 70th year of her life"" mean she was 69?","I'm transcribing and tabulating some inscriptions from our local churchyard. Some are easy: ""... who departed this life on the 8 of June 1801 Aged 72 Years"". That means, I think, that she died on or after her 72nd birthday, and before her 73rd birthday.  Others give me pause for thought. ""She Departed this Life June ye 4th 1743 in ye 22nd year of her Age"". Should I understand that to mean that she died on or after her 21st birthday, and before her 22nd birthday, so she was 21 when she died? Given that someone who died ""in the first year of her life"" would die before her first birthday?  I'm aware that these ages are often wrong anyway, but I'd like to do something consistent with other people's work.  "

96,Given Name in parenthesis on Cemetery Stones,"I know the maiden name of someone is sometimes shown in parenthesis on a headstone.   But I have sometimes seen first names with a name following that in parenthesis, for example:    In cases like this, is it usual that the person's real name is listed without parenthesis and the used/commonly-known name in parenthesis, or is it usually the other way around?   In the above example, you would think that Betty would be the wife's given name at birth, and Hye would be the husband's given name at birth, but that would be inconsistently using the parenthesis on the same stone, which doesn't seem logical.  Or could there be other reasons for a given name to be shown in parenthesis? "
97,"What should I look for during a research trip to Knoxville, Tennessee?","Most of my family history is in North Carolina and East Tennessee (1750s-present) and I do most of my research remotely from Texas, so I'm generally limited to sources like Ancestry and FHL. My relatives moved to Tennessee around 1810 and lived mostly in sleepy towns and rural areas south of Knoxville, so I'm looking for anything interesting after that point.  But I have a trip coming up to Knoxville to visit family and I'm planning to go do some local research with my brother at local libraries.  I know what I can find online and I have some experience looking in historical archives (mostly at NCSA and GA), but I'm a little more lost when it comes to research at county or city resources.  What kinds of evidence should I look for that are far less likely to be digitized and indexed online, especially items I could find at a normal (not historical) library or county archive?   Some ideas I've had so far:   Headstones Land ownership or tax records Wills (these are generally online) Newspapers (apparently very few survived from what I've heard so far) Local school yearbooks   Are there other local records that are often overlooked that might be accessible to the general public?

98,Understanding entries in Charlotte County Personal Tax Table for Deceased Person?,"I'm looking at the Charlotte County Personal Tax records for 1798 (paywalled) as shown in this image:    Isaac Brizendine died in 1797, and I believe the first line ends with Estate and the second line ends with Heir, but it is hard to read.    Have I interpreted those correctly?    Why does Isaac have two entries?    Would it be a minor child over age 16 that is the Heir and his brothers Joshua should be around age 18 and illegible, begins with an I or a J, that are over 18?    Or could the second Isaac be a Jr. and it reads Junior and not Heir?  Note the following from the Library of Virginia:     Personal property tax records are a substitute for records of those counties where destruction of the original deeds, wills, or other records has occurred. By studying the lists from year to year, researchers may trace an ancestor to determine the date of departure from a locality, or possibly the year of death. The name of a taxpayer will continue on the tax list, noted as “deceased” or “estate,” until the estate is settled.  "
99,Deciphering part of 1799 probate from USA?,"In the numbered parts (which I've highlighted) of the probate for Joseph Eayers pictured below:   Does that mean Joseph was a widow? And what does the ""third"" and ""excepted"" part mean? Does ""incapable of a division"" mean there was dispute/fighting over splitting the will? The signing of this in 1799 was a year after Josephs death in 1798 so this may explain the year long gap. If not, how long would it take for wills have been processed in early America? There was thought Joseph (Sr.) had a son named Joseph (Jr.) as well. In this instance, is the will referring to dead Joseph Sr. or alive son Joseph Jr.? And if its the son Jr, is he the one that pays out his father inheritance to his sibling ""co-heirs""?      "

103,How can I get USCIS to send me electronic results instead of paper?,"I've been researching relatives that immigrated to the United States during the early 20th century and have done search reports with USCIS Genealogy Index Search Request.  In my index search requests, you can specify whether you want paper or electronic results and I always request electronic.  This has worked for the search index report first stage, but on every second stage requesting records, they keep sending me paper copies instead of electronic.  I would prefer electronic as I expect it has more information than a printout that I then scan into my computer.  I tried submitting a follow up request via their ticket system, but that fell on deaf ears.  One example of this is I create a records request for the following for one person in response to the index search request giving these documents as being available:  File Series    File Number  C-File         C-4841275  AR-2 Form      A-3528497   These are C-File (Certificate Files, September 27, 1906 - March 31, 1956) and AR-2 (Alien Registration Forms on Microfilm, 1940 - 1944).

104,Confirming possible half sibling from AncestryDNA?,"It took a few months to process this shocking news from  my dna results from ancestry.

She is experienced searching her family tree with 2000+ people. We share 1499 cm across 47 segments. I also share 758 cm with her son. My daughter also matched with her family. The match is an only child.   I saw no dna matches on my father's side.   About a dozen I recognized from my mother's side.   We texted back &amp; forth &amp; saw that our families lived in the same town where I was born. I have other siblings, I am in the middle . One sister is being tested. The match is an only child.

105,Establishing Native American Lineage via Online Database Tools?,"I have one (maybe two) Native American lines in my family tree. Genetic testing has confirmed this presence, but tracking down some specifics with deceased grandparents whose own parent or grandparent was of a certain tribe make things a little difficult to track when they're deceased and the stigma of being a Native American was considered a ""bad thing"" at that time societally.  The article How Do I Legally Prove Native American Ancestry? by Henry Louis Gates Jr. and NEHGS Researcher Meaghan E.H. Siekman really points one in the right direction for documentation purposes. This points to the even more helpful document from The Office of Public Affairs-Indian Affairs: A Guide to Tracing American Indian &amp; Alaska Native Ancestry  The common factor seems to be that one must track their lineal descent (see page 5 from above PDF):     ... it can be said that two commonly found requirements for membership   are: 1) lineal descent from someone named on the tribe's base roll [a   ""base roll"" is a tribe’s original list of members as designated in a   tribal constitution or other document specifying enrollment criteria]   or 2) lineal descent from a tribal member who descends from someone   whose name appears on the base roll. Other conditions such as tribal   blood quantum, residency, or continued contact with the tribe also are   common.   This got me thinking about certain tools online that make finding certain relatives easier by accessing online services to establish matches. Such services are Veteran Finder, Relative Finder and Pedigree Pie.  Are there any online databases or similar options that facilitate efficient research for American Indian (Native American) ancestry? "
106,Interpreting runs of homozygosity data to determine how closely parents were related?,"According to Gedmatch's Are your parents related? tool, my grandmother's DNA shows several runs of homozygosity (ROH):  Chr Start Location  End Location    Centimorgans (cM)   SNPs 3   180690286       192749897       23.5                2151 8   11855773        21377758        17                  2555 9   22131034        30815690        11.3                1612 10  36514828        63439845        16.6                3005 14  93668370        106176088       28.4                2381   Gedmatch gives the conclusion:      This analysis indicates that your parents are probably related within   the last several generations.   My grandmother's parents were known to be second cousins, so this is no surprise.  However, I am wondering how this data, in particular the number and length of ROH can help determine how closely one's parents are related.  This is my grandmother's family tree as determined via traditional genealogical methods, showing her inter-related ancestors:    As you can see, her parents were not only second cousins, but also double third cousins.  I have no doubt that the two great grandmothers were sisters, but proving the generation above (i.e. the fact that the two great great grandmothers were also sisters) has been challenging with paper records alone. Does this ROH data provide evidence in support of this genealogy? Or in other words, how does one interpret the number and length of ROH in terms of degree of relationship between the parents? "
107,Can this Verlustliste record be excluded or verified based on what (little) I know?,"My mother (who is only related by marriage to the family in question) recounted a story that my great-grandmother's little brother died in the first World War when he and a group of fellow young officers were on town leave, and a Serbian soldier came along and shot him in the back.  Now, my mother has a much better memory for these sorts of family stories than most people, me included, but I still can't place much weight on any of the details (not least because they come through the filter of my memory of what my mother said). So let's just say that the young man was a soldier, possibly an officer, in the Austro-Hungarian army during WWI, and died during the war.  The more certain details: he was born on Dec. 3, 1886 in Budapest, Hungary, and was given the names Béla Ferencz at his baptism on Dec. 9 ([website]Both the OCR-based search at the Austrian State Library ([website]Other relevant tidbits: The name Adalbert (or Albert) was sometimes used as a German ""translation"" of the native Hungarian name Béla.  Béla's elder sister spoke fluent German as well as her native Hungarian. This came in handy when she became the cantor-teacher's wife in Harta, a Danube Schwabian village about 80 km (50 mi) south of Budapest. (The marriage was in 1902.)  My question is: what is known about the unit and rank and whatnot given in the Loss List? Can any of it exclude (or much less likely, verify) the entry as a match to my relative? Is there any hope of more information somewhere to go with such an anemic entry in the Loss Lists?    Edited to add more detail about what it is I'm trying to find out: The Loss List entry, anemic as it is, gives a unit and subunit, and comes with a date. Is there someplace where I can look up information about that unit, such as where it was based or where the people in it mostly came from, and what it was doing (where it was) in the summer of 1914?  Alternately, is there an archive somewhere that would have files about the members of Austria-Hungary's infantry regiment 53, company 2, where I could look up Adalbert Gaiter's birthdate or mother's name?

109,What is the teacher's last name?,"Recently, I found my great-great grandmother's (Emily Griffiths) 5th grade report card from 1895 nailed to the wall in the attic over the garage (don't ask me why it was there, I took it down and put it in a safer place pending my ability to get it preserved).  Anyway, most of it is pretty easy to read, but unfortunately I have always had trouble reading cursive, especially in isolation. I can't read the last name of the teacher (Elizabeth W(?)....ich?), what grade Emily got for ""Conduct"", or what word is written after ""History"" under the listing of the various classes. Presumably that word explains why history is the only class were a numerical grade was given.  I have attached two different images showing the report card. Note that I had to reduce the quality so that the file size would be small enough to post on here. Could someone who can read cursive better than I can please identify the indicated words?   "
110,Explaining how all DNA matches are shared with Half sibling?,"I have DNA matches from Ancestry, FTDNA, GEDMatch, and My Heritage.  My half-sister also tested with Ancestry.  It confirms we are half siblings and share the same mother.  I do not know who my father was, so in my search, I realized that ALL of my DNA matches are shared with my half sister.  I was trying to isolate those matches we don't share, in hopes that I could find my father and/or relatives. I am new to genealogy, so I don't know if I am way off in this understanding.   How can this be that all of our matches are connected in some way?    How can I find my father in this case?    There are so many features of GEDMatch that are too complicated and advanced for me. "
111,Interpreting matches with low cM values and high SNPs (or vice versa)?,"On GEDmatch's autosomal one-to-one report, a match contains a column for cM and a column for SNPs values, for each of the matching chromosomes.  Normally you look for high cM values as an indicator of genetic distance (and to some degree, generational distance).  But I also understand that it's important to take into account the number of SNPs in relation to the cM value (the greater the SNPs, the better it is).  But, in my research, I've discovered high cM values with very low SNPs (for example, a common value that I find is: 14cM / 128SNP). On the other hand, I have very low cM values with very high SNPs (3.2cM / 4968SNPs).  I've not found these contrasting amounts useful for establishing valid matches so far (and often delete them from my database).  But I'm wondering if I should take these ""extreme"" segment matches more seriously -- do they have any value?  How should I interpret them? "
112,Can a person adopt their own parent or grandparent?,"A recent question on Finding Loops in GEDCOM files got me to wonder if there are some loops that are valid.  Of course there is science fiction, where a person goes back in time and parents their own ancestor. And there is the famous I'm My Own Grandpa song, but that is where he becomes his own grandfather through marriage, so he wouldn't be his own true ancestor and it wouldn't show up as a loop in a GEDCOM.  What I'm thinking of are adoptions. I can see a case where a person might legally adopt an invalid parent or grandparent so that they have caregiver rights or maybe there is some other valid legal reason for them to do so.  If that would be the case, then this would be a valid loop, where a child or grandchild is also the legal parent of their parent or grandparent.   Has this happened, or is this even legally allowed in any country in the world?  Are there any other non-science fiction ways in which a person can validly become their own ancestor and thus create a valid loop in a GEDCOM file? "

I already know it is important to locate and photograph them, so I am thinking more about the stones (and the writing upon them), and what happens when a lease on a plot expires?  Does anyone have experience of enlisting support from all or a number of extant (many now distant) cousins to try and look after the graves of ancestors buried between about 1850 and 1920? "
114,What does it mean for woman to have the title of Mistress in a marriage record?,"I found a marriage record* where the woman has the title of ""Mistress"". What does that title mean in this case? I know that title of ""Mistress"" has multiple meanings.  The woman was previously married (the previous husband died) and was born in France. I suppose one of those facts is relevant, or perhaps both.  The marriage occurred in Montana on Dec 7th, 1923.  * The record on the right. "
115,"Why would FamilySearch.org index be showing a person's age in a marriage, if that's not in the Parish Record?","This problem is somewhat similar to an earlier question of mine, but the issue is more general than before. In one tree I am researching, I can find a marriage record for Nathaniel Claughton and Martha Howgate in 1791 in Guisely in both Ancestry.com and FamilySearch.org (the date is off, but it's the same people). Based on his death record as well at the date of his marriage, he was probably born around 1770. They had several children, including another Nathaniel born 1802, before Martha died in 1822. This can all be traced through both Ancestry.com and FamilySearch.  Here's where it gets weird. There is a record for a Nathaniel Claughton marrying a Sarah Smith in December 1822. I had this as a marriage involving the younger Nathaniel, based on the Ancestry.com scan of the parish record, and the fact that there don’t seem to be other Claughtons in Guiseley at the time – though there are others in nearby towns in West Yorkshire. But the FamilySearch.org index listing lists both members of the couple as being 50 years old, which would be consistent with the elder Nathaniel remarrying soon after Martha died.  In her answer to my earlier question, ColeValleyGirl indicated that Familysearch.org tends to be based on Bishop’s Transcripts not the original parish record. In contrast the Ancestry.com scans are clearly the original parish register.  I suspect that the marriage to Sarah Smith was incorrectly annotated in the Bishop’s transcripts: in the marriage to Martha Howgate, Nathaniel made a mark rather than signing. But in the marriage to Sarah Smith, that Nathaniel signed the register.  So I'm going to conclude that the original parish register had no ages recorded, that the illiterate and literate Nathaniels were different people (but father and son), and that the ages in the FamilySearch.org index were erroneous additions to the Bishop’s Transcript, probably because the elder Nathaniel was a property owner and therefore better known.  Is it common for FamilySearch.org indexes of marriages (and burials, I suppose) to have extraneous information added compared to the original parish register, and if so, how much weight should be put on that extra information if it conflicts with a scan of the parish register?   I am trying to construct a question of general use here, rather than one specific to this particular case. "
116,Creating and improving family tree online with help from relatives?,"I know of Publishing family tree online? but my requirements are different.  I would like to have my family tree online to create and improve it with relatives. I'm looking for a tool to share my work and let others help me. It's very important for me to be able to publish privately my birth, death and marriage certificates and link them to the correct tree node. I also would like to be able to share notes or comments. A solution could be create links to my dropbox, google or skydrive folder. What website or software is able to do that? "
117,What determined which prisoners sentenced to transportation were actually transported?,"Thomas Duffett (baptised 1785 Stalbridge, Dorset, England) had a couple of run-ins with the law and got himself sentenced to 7 years transportation. Twice. But he never left the country.  The first time around, in December 1816, he was sentenced to death for sheep stealing. The sentence was commuted to 7 years transportation and he was transferred to the prison hulk Laurel in Portsmouth Harbour in May 1817. He next shows up in the  Prison Hulk registers, first in the Laurel and then in the York. The York register shows his 'disposal' as PFP (which means a Free Pardon); the date is not very legible but looks like sometime in 1821 (which ties in with the fact that he had children born in early 1817 and then 1822).  In January 1849 he was again sentenced to 7 years transportation, for stealing timber this time. The Sherborne Mercury in October 1849 includes reference to the fact that the Government had rejected him as unfit to go on account of ill-health and the Secretary of State might be asked to remit his sentence. The Dorchester Prisons admission and discharge register shows an annotation after his original sentence of transportation showing that it was commuted to 2 years hard labour, and he was back home in time for the 1851 census in Stalbridge.  He died in 1856 in the Sturminster Union Poorhouse and was buried at Stalbridge Parish Church.  So: what determined that he spent about 4 years imprisoned in England from 1817-1821 and then received a Free pardon, when other prisoners in the same period were being transported? And what would render a man unfit for transportation in 1849, although he survived 2 years hard labour instead and survived another 5 years after that?    Sources:    Ancestry.co.uk.

121,Locating a marriage record for Jacob Bennett and his wife Zipporah in 18th century Connecticut?,"Jacob Bennett was born in 1735 in Connecticut according to AGBI and Barbour Collection. My father's research showed Jacob married Zipporah but he did not cite his sources nor know Zipporah's maiden name. In searching (google, myheritage.com, geni.com, ancestry.com, NEHGS,...) for more information on Zipporah I discovered other uncited references to Zipporah and some give her maiden name as Smith eg:        JACOB5 BENNETT (ISSAC4, JOHN3, JOHN2, EDWARD1) was born 06 Oct 1735 in Preston, New London, CT, and died Bef. 1825. He married ZIPPORAH SMITH, daughter of SAMUEL SMITH.      which I found here in Genealogy.com.  Note there is some confusion possible when researching Jacob Bennett as he had a son with the same name and there was another Jacob Bennett born nearby only a few years apart. There is also confusion reseraching Zipporah Smith as there is a Zipporah Smith who married into the descendants of William Brewter so is better documented in Mayflower Society research.   Where and when were Jacob Bennett and Zipporah married? What was her maiden name and what can be discovered about her birth? "
122,"19th Century Debtors Prison Records, London","I have found (I think) two records for Demetrius Rogers in Ancestry's Marshalsea (London) debtors prison records.  The first has ""Dematris Rogers"" brought into custody on 11 Sep 1812:  (This record appears in the discharged section but judging by structure and content it's actually a committal, but that section had overflowed.)  The second (not indexed properly on Ancestry) has his discharge on 27 Oct 1812:   I'm having trouble understanding exactly what some of the terms mean. I've looked, but haven't found a guide to these documents. Ancestry's own ""about"" page for this data set is not particularly helpful.  For the first record, I read that Rogers was brought in at the suit of attorneys Charles Henry Thorp and Joseph Thorp, with damages of £40 and ""sums sworn"" of £20. I can't decipher the text after that.  For the second, it's not clear to me what the ""C.C."", ""C.M"", ""P.F."" and ""R.R."" fields are. The first three look like amounts of money (3/6, 10/6, 10/10 as pounds/shillings?) and the fourth has initials, perhaps of the officer authorising the release. The ""How discharged"" column is also obscure. It looks most like ""HC to KB"". My best guess is ""High Court to Kings Bench"", indicating that he was transferred to Kings Bench debtors prison. The following page has someone with ""HC to Fleet"", which was yet another debtors prison, so that fits. I cannot find any record of Rogers in the Kings Bench documents on Ancestry, though.  Does anyone have more experience with these documents, or any ideas how to read them properly? "

124,Making sense of conflicting death dates for Juliet D. (Strong) Wilder?,"Julia/Juliet/Juliette D. (Strong) Wilder is known to be the daughter of James A. and Eleanor (Denton) Strong: Michigan census records show James (1850, 1860) and Eleanor Strong (1850) living with Julia/Juliette Welder/Walter and her husband, whose name appears with hers in census records as A. A. Welder (1850), E Weilter (1860), Arebus Wilder (1870), and Arelas Wilder (1880). I also have a 1925 entry from ""The Boston Transcript"" reading: ""James Strong died in Detroit, Mich., at the age of ninety-nine, at the home of his daughter, Juliette Wilder, about 1865.""  The following grave marker in Elmwood Cemetery, Detroit gives the names and dates of birth and death of Aretas A. Wilder (3 April 1809 - 1 September 1888) and Juliet D. Wilder (23 May 1812 - 17 January 1889).    Detroit records confirm the death date of 1 September 1888 for Eratus A. Wilder, who is listed as widowed. Detroit records show Juliet D. Wilder with a death date of 12 January 1888 and also widowed. Note that his death date is consistent with the grave marker, while hers is not. A contemporary newspaper account gives her death date as 17 January 1889, describing her as the ""widow of the late Aretus A. Wilder"".  How can these discrepancies be resolved? Were there two different Julia/Juliet/Juliette Wilders who died in 1888-1889 in Detroit (only one of whom is found in search), or is the date in the official record incorrect? "
125,Where to find online records of New York City Potter's Field / Hart Island pre-1980?,"I recently have read a few articles about New York City's Potter's field on Hart Island.   According to Wikpedia's article Hart Island (New York) and a New York City Corrections Department history page an estimated 750,000 to 1,000,000+ people have been buried in mass graves from 1868 to Present and burials continue at a rate of about 2000-3000 burials per year currently.   Per the articles:     The records of the coffin row-and-column placement are kept between five and 10 years.....those plot burial records are turned over to the Municipal Archives.   And some of these records post 9/1/1977 -> approximately 2007 have been made available.     In 2009 the digital mapping of grave trenches using the Global Positioning System was started. In 2013 the New York City Department of Correction created a searchable database on its website of the people buried on the island starting in 1977 and it contains 66,000 entries.4   The Hart Project website allows you to search 1980 to 2008 and Find-A-Grave has some sort of search but doesn't match the Hart Project, FamilySearch's New York Death Records do not seem to completely cover the period from what I can tell, and the NYC Department of Corrections' Hart Island Lookup Service has more recent records.   From these searches I was able to locate a few possible names of interest.  I reviewed similar NYC questions here.  The New York City Department of Records' website has a genealogy section, but it is for vital records searches; there is no cemetery search in their List of Holdings.  The Vital Records search requires specific searches and there does not seem to be a way to search for all Hart Island Burials.  Are earlier Hart Island specific records or indexes available elsewhere online from the 1868 to 1980? "
126,"Which UK county type to use for data entry: historic, ceremonial, registration, or administrative?","This question is related to: Should I use the modern (what it is called now) or historical (what it was called) place name? There is no doubt that the standard is to record the name of the place as it was at the time of the event. However, with counties in the UK, this is not always clear cut.  At various times there were (to name a few):   historic counties ceremonial counties registration counties administrative counties county boroughs   Many of these geographies overlap and were in concurrent use, but the boundaries were not the same. Furthermore, the administrative counties and boroughs changed frequently over time. This makes it very difficult to know which geography to use when entering genealogical events into a family history database.  As an example, I was born post-1974 in an area in the historic county of Cheshire, and ceremonial county of Greater Manchester. Locals would have still considered the place Cheshire, even though it is technically no longer in formal use. My birth certificate does not even specify an administrative county, only the ""administrative area"" that is the Metropolitan Borough.  Which county type is typically used by genealogists to describe events such as my birth – historic county, ceremonial county, or administrative county borough? "
127,What year does this toy tricycle appear to be?,"I have a glossy photo, measuring 2.75""×4.5"", that I'm trying to date.  Clues are:   The toy tricycle. The clothing of the child.  (Is this a boy or a girl?) The style of home in the background. The sidewalk construction.     I think it is either of a girl born June 1917 or a boy born June 1921 or less likely a boy born March 1933.  Location might be within these ranges:   1917-1920 • 525 North Pleasant Street, Independence, Jackson, Missouri 1923 • 2729 North Main Street, Hutchinson, Kansas 1925 • 233 South Vassar Avenue, Wichita, Kansas 1930 • 3620 Watonga, Fort Worth, Tarrant, Texas 1932 • 4108 Modlin Avenue, Fort Worth, Texas   Given all these clues, what year and place does the picture appear to be taken in?

129,Which British Army regiment did Thomas Stretch join as a drummer boy in 1774?,"Thomas Stretch was born in Norwich in 1763, joined the army, eventually retired in Nottingham and died there in 1851. His Chelsea Pension Discharge record (PDF) from 1807 states 33 years 9 months served, in the 76th Regiment of Foot (""the Hindoostan Regiment"").  A drummer (and private) for the first 27 years of his career, Thomas attained the rank of sergeant for the final 7. After all that, he was ""completely worn out"". 27 years is a lot of drumming, after all.     His discharge record also states his age as 49 in 1807, giving a birth date of 1758, but that doesn't match his other records - his birth/baptism, 1841 census, 1851 census and death records yield birth years of 1763, 1766, 1764 and 1763 respectively (the death cert confirms his regiment and rank too). His stated parish (St James) matches his baptism in St James with Pockthorpe, Norwich.   The discharge gives 33y 9 m of service in Dec 1807, so he enlisted around Mar 1774. That puts his age at about 11! I guess he claimed to be 15, hence the 1758 birth date. It sounds absurd, but drummers of that age weren't unheard of back then. If you were old enough to carry the drum, you were old enough to bang the drum.  But something else doesn't quite add up.  The 76th had four incarnations:     1. 1745 - 1746 (Lord Harcourt's Regiment)     2. 1756 - 1763 (raised as 61st then renamed 76th in 1758)     3. 1777 - 1784  (Macdonald's Highlanders, raised in west Scotland)     4. 1787 - 1881 (Hindoostan Regiment)    Thomas was discharged from that final ""Hindoostan"" incarnation, originally raised for the East India Company in 1787. They had sailed to India that year, remained there for nearly two decades, then left in 1806, and that's consistent with Thomas' discharge the following year in Jersey, where the 76th was then stationed. During that 20 year period, however, Thomas managed to marry (1791, Northampton) and have numerous children (1793 onwards), mostly in Nottingham. Assuming that the regiment wasn't providing a conjugal shuttle service, he must, therefore, have stayed in England. So I presume that Thomas was a drummer in the single Company of the 76th that Wikipedia notes remained in the UK to continue raising forces by Beat of Drum. The birth of his first child was registered in Norwich, and another in Chatham, also a military base. That's consistent with his movement around Britain, but would families normally have accompanied soldiers at such times?  (The transcription of this same record on FindMyPast states the regiment as ""Duke of Wellington's (West Riding Regiment) - 33rd &amp; 76th Foot"". That must be wrong - from Wikipedia on that regiment, the 33rd didn't merge with the 76th until 1881, and it contradicts the clear identification of the 76th in the document.)  The thing is, in 1807 the 76th had then only existed for 20 years in that incarnation, and Thomas had served nearly 34. The 76th did not exist in any incarnation when he enlisted in 1774. Even if there was a gap in his service period, the first two incarnations of the 76th are far too early for Thomas.  So unless the service lengths are very wrong (and they're written quite clearly on both sides of the document), Thomas must have served in another regiment (as a drummer boy) and transferred to the 76th Foot, probably in 1787. The 76th was raised (Wiki again) largely in the Midlands, including Nottingham, where Thomas spent much of his life. That city housed several regiments over the years, so it's plausible that Thomas' earlier regiment took him there. According to the Nottinghamshire History page on the Nottingham Barracks, there wasn't a full barracks there until 1792, before which soldiers were mostly billeted at inns.   I've looked at Wikipedia's List of Regiments of Foot for candidates that may have disbanded in 1787, or a few years either side. There are several, mostly Scottish, and I'm not sure how to find out where they disbanded. None were formed in 1774, though. It's quite possible that Thomas was in more than one regiment prior to the 76th, in which case there won't be a clear pattern match. I'd like to find regiments that recruited in Norwich around 1774, but that doesn't look like a simple search.  The only other Chelsea pension record I've looked at in detail was from my 5th GGF Matthew Stretch (likely Thomas' cousin), and that (PDF) was annotated with the four different regiments in which he served, as a table hand-written on one margin. The next record after Thomas' (also from the 76th) doesn't have any regiment history either, but that could be because it   Was it normal for a discharge/pension document to only note the last regiment served, and yet declare the entire service length? Or is a fuller record expected? There's no dedicated space for it, and Matthew's was hand-drawn, so it clearly wasn't a standard part of the document. Is there anywhere I could seek more information on Thomas' earlier military career? I have found no attestation papers for him as yet. I'm aware of the musty old muster rolls, and I'm sure I’ll visit the National Archives one day, but is there anything more readily available?   So which regiment took in this little boy? "
130,"Meaning of ""Map"" as birthplace on NY 1855 Census?","On the 1855 NY Census, one of my relatives (Mary Whitney) has a birthplace noted as ""Map"". According to the instructions on the census form, that field contains one of the following:   the NY county where the person was born (if born in NY) the state where they were born (if they weren't born in NY) the country where they were born (if they weren't born in the US)   There are three NY counties that begin with ""M"" - Madison, Monroe and Montgomery.  I can't think of a state that might be abbreviated as ""Map"", nor a country. I thought it might be a census abbreviation, but I haven't been able to find anything. I found another entry with ""Unknown"" entered, so it doesn't mean that. And it wasn't just Mary. I found an entire family in that census who had ""Map"" listed for their birthplaces.  Any ideas about what ""Map"" means?    It appears the ""p"" is really a long s, which would be commonly used for a double s, making ""Map"" really ""Mass"". However, how does that explain this entry with both ""Map"" and ""Mass""?   "
131,John Sherwood Clarke: Explaining the two surnames and finding his birth record in France?,"An ancestor, John Sherwood, is noted on his marriage certificate to Maria Berry on 7/4/1834 as being 'aka John Sherwood Clarke'.  From later Bedfordshire censuses, he appears to have been born in France, 'near Bayonne', in 1814.  Several of his children are given Clarke as a middle name, so both names are very significant.  I can find no record of his birth in the French Bayonne birth archives for 1814, 1815 or 1816 under either the name Clarke or Sherwood, nor in the birth archives of nearby Orthez, both being places where his father may have been fighting in the Napoleonic wars.  The only birth I can find that may be relevant is of a John Clarke in France in 1816 within the 7th foot regiment.  Does anyone have any ideas where else I might look for evidence of his birth and/or his return to the UK, in order to find the names of his parents, and to follow up on why he would have registered as Sherwood at his marriage when he had previously used Clarke as his surname? (Adoption perhaps?) "
132,Are there records for Whitecross Debtors Prison Turnkeys in 19th Century London?,"Nether Fustian Continuations and a Drink for Desperate Men  Too often, I underestimate human ingenuity. I had never imagined, for example, that a man would wreath himself in cow-guts full of gin. But here I must admit my shortcomings, as a rather marvellous 1829 article in the Bucks Gazette (British Newspaper Archive, account required) shows. ""A Respectable Man"" covers the trial of John Hench, accused of smuggling said liquor into Whitecross-street, one of London's debtors prisons. This excerpt gives the character of the piece:         Demetrius Rogers, principal turnkey of that prison, produced five-yard long pieces of beef bowels filled with gin; and by his evidence it appeared that he had extracted all these fine, great, spirituous sausages, from the nether fustian continuations of John Hench - within which continuations they had been curiously suspended by loops and nooses of tape and packthread. Demetrius the turnkey, added moreover, that he knew John Hench well enough, and that John Hench well knew the consequences of this spirituous speculation of his; he having been for a long time, and until very lately, an inmate of the prison himself.   The full article in all its glory, with my transcription, is here (PDF).  I confess, I have no curiosity for John Hench, despite his having invented the curly straw. And I care neither for his colonic cocktails*, nor his nether fustian continuations, a garment best left unimagined. No, my person of interest here is Demetrius Rogers**, the turnkey at Whitecross-street debtors prison. He is (probably) the brother-in-law of William Stretch, my 4th great grandfather, and also the most mis-transcribed person in my tree. I've asked about him before, in 19th Century Debtors Prison Records, London.  So what do I know about Demetrius? According to the 1841 census, he was an Irishman, born around 1780. I don't know how or when he came to London. He married Mary Crawley in 1810, and was the landlord of the Falcon Inn, on Portpool Lane, London, in 1811. He found himself in Marshalsea debtors prison for at least several weeks in 1812, possibly transferring to King's Bench. A busy couple of years! Demetrius must have left prison by 1819, as he and Mary were witnesses to the marriage of William Stretch and Elizabeth Crawley then.  By 1835 Demetrius was running the Peacock Inn on Whitecross Street (just opposite the Whitecross-street debtors prison), and must have owned it, or a nearby house, as he appears in the 1837 Poll Books. He is in the 1841 census there, with Mary (and one of William Stretch's daughters) but transferred the licence in 1842, which presumably marks his retirement. Rogers died in 1850, leaving a tidy sum to Mary, but that may be a tale saved for another question.  Three of William's descendants were named Demetrius, presumably in Rogers' honour, so he does seem to have been an important man to my family. His widow Mary lived with our family after Demetrius' death, until her own passing 20 years later.  I've known much of this for a while, but this prison guard role is new to me. It helps fill the gap between Marshalsea in 1812 and the Peacock in 1835. It shows that Rogers remained in the world of debtors prisons, but as poacher turned gamekeeper. This man seems to have had a story, and that makes me want to know more.   There doesn't appear to be much information available on Whitecross-street prison (Wiki), particularly not about staff. There are administrative records listed at the LMA, which I may have to delve into next time I get to London, but there's little online.   Is there anywhere else I can look for information on debtors prison turnkeys and other staff, particularly those who may have been on the other side of the bars for a while? Was such a transition commonplace?    *I propose a new ""a-slice-of-lemon-won't-help"" tag for this.    **There could, of course, be more than one Demetrius Rogers in London at that time. But not many. Records are sparse, but do not suggest a multitude of Demetriuses. Or Demetrii.   "
133,What is the best way to store my own text records into the future?,"Here is what I want to do:     Record my memories somewhere they will last for the next 200 years (or as long as possible), so my posterity etc can get at them   I'd prefer to use a digital format so they can be easily distributed and accessed (i.e., not just write in a book by hand because that's very difficult to make copies; only the person with the physical copy has access)   A FamilySearch Blog post suggested using some type of cloud storage. That's pretty good, but what guarantee do I have the company that provides the service will exist in 200 years? Or won't change their policy and refuse access? Or get hacked. (I suppose it's also possible the cloud servers could be destroyed too). Eg, I was using an iPhone app to record my stories for a while, and then the app got removed from the App Store after a few years (I managed to get a database dump of the data, but now it just sits on my computer).  I thought using FamilySearch's ""Memories"" would be a good fit: if it works well enough for storing my ancestors stories, it should work well enough for my own. Plus FamilySearch actually developed from the Utah Genealogical Society so it's been around for over a hundred years.  Plus, they have the whole granite mountain vault for storing records right? (Not sure if FamilySearch Memories are backed up there though). So is using FamilySearch Memories the best chance at preserving my memories for the next 200+ years? Or what might be better? "
134,Should I preserve my family Bible in a cedar box?,I have a family bible that was dates back to 1864.  When I originally recieved it from my grandmother it was in a cotton zippered pillowcase.  It was taken from me for a few years &amp; when I got it back it was in a plastic shopping bag.  :-(   It is really not in good condition.  I am not interested in getting the book restored but would like to keep it safe.  My husband has offered to make a lidded box for it of cedar.  Would cedar be a good material to use?  Should I wrap the bible in cloth before placing in the cedar box? 
135,"What does 1851 UK Census ""Relation to Head of Family"" entry that looks like ""Depen"" mean?","I've run across a curious designation in the ""Relation to Head of Family"" column of the 1851 Census that I'd like some help figuring out.  Following the entries for the parents and their children who all share the same last name, there is an entry for a 24-year-old woman with a different last name and a ""Relation to Head of Family"" that looks like it could be ""Depen"" (possibly for Dependent?).  The Census says this young woman is employed as a ""Cotton Slubber"" and she is certainly of age at 24, so I'm not quite sure what to make of this.  Has anyone else seen a similar designation?  Am I reading the entry correctly?  Any thoughts about what it might mean?    Judith, thanks for your thoughts on this.  Here's one other wrinkle that I overlooked.  Hannah Yates is also enumerated with this family in the 1841 Census, but in that census (which doesn't include a column for relation to head of household), she's listed as ""F.S.,"" presumably ""Female Servant.""     Since the head of household is listed as a Laborer, it seems a bit odd to think that Hannah Yates was employed as a female servant within the household.  Maybe this is just the way the census enumerator accounted for the presence of an unrelated, non-working teenage girl in household, or maybe she was working as a domestic outside the household?  In any case, the unofficial adoption line is definitely one worth following up.  I'll try to locate a birth record for Hannah to see if that helps me figure anything out. "
136,"Genealogical Standard way to record the US, USA, United States, United States of America?","What is the genealogical standard way to record specifically the United States of America?     I want to be clear this question is specific to storing ""United States of America"", not a general how to record a historical name question (already asked) or formatting of general place names (already asked). It is also not about recording ""British Colonial America"" or the ""United States of America"" (already asked).   There are many way to record the United States of America in a place name and I see a variety in records. So am looking for a 'standardized' way, if one has been set to record it for post American Revolution ""United States of America"". I think in terms of the long term and so am a bit hesitant to use abbreviations record ""USA"" or even shortened  ""United States"" as it could change over time to refer to more than one place such as perhaps one day United States of Africa (hypothetically) which would be unique and unrelated. Usually you have other location data, but not always, you may only have the country.  I am aware of the following ways to record the United States, all of which I have seen in records.   United States of America (long proper name) United States U.S.A. U S A US of A or USofA USA (ISO-3166-A3) 840 (ISO-3166-Numeric) US (ISO-3166-A2) U S As well as various other typos and mis-spellings.   I tend to use the long proper name, but it requires a lot more data entry.   I scanned the NGS's standards page and did not see anything jumping out. Ancestry.com's World Archive Key'n standard's has some guidance on locations, but not whether to use the full name. I also checked the GCG's Genealogy Standards Book (50th Anniv. Ed, pub. 2014) and I did not see anything specific there related to the use of abbreviations of countries or specific to the United States. The later book refers to the United States in the book in its long and short form interchangeably in other reference examples but none are abbreviated and it makes no specific guidance.  I realize some older programs may not support, ""United States of America"", but all modern programs I have seen support the full length.  Is there any other specific standard out there for recording the United States of America for genealogical purposes? "

My current timeline for Margaret (copied from the earlier question) is:   christened on 28 Aug 1808 at St James, Bristol, Gloucester. Father William Morgan and Mother Jane married Thomas Morgan on 20 Aug 1831 at St Bride's Minor, Glamorganshire, Wales in 1841 Census, aged 30 living at place (farm?) called Foesyrefoil (sp?), Coychurch, Thomas Morgan 38 Margaret Morgan 30 Thomas Morgan 9 Margaret Morgan 7 William Morgan 4 Ann Morgan 2 At same address but diff census record is Ann Griffith aged 69 (poss her mother?) in 1851 Census aged 43 living at Trebryn (sp?), Pencoed, with husband Thomas and six children.

139,Custom of hyphenated names in Germany,"I am searching for Joseph/Josef Greiner (my 4th great grandfather and a glass maker from the German Greiner line of glassmakers) and while doing so have gathered literally thousands of records which supposedly ""link"" all the Greiner glassmaking family back to about 1450. A lot of the records, however, present the Greiner name as a hyphenated one and no one can tell me why or where or how!!! Here is a copy of the email I have been sending out to various German genealogy societies and even the German ""state"" archives:   ""I found extensive genealogy records which supposedly are the generations of Greiner glassmakers up to about 1870. Many of the surnames are hyphenated and I don't understand why.  Example: Johann Georg Greiner-Gobes married Anna Koch. They had 8 children. The first born (a son) was named Georg Greiner-Gobes-Sohn. The second child was named Johann Jakob Greiner-Schang. The remaining 6 (both sons and daughters) are listed as Greiner-Gobes.  Another example: Johann Nicolaus Jakob Greiner-Schang married Johanna Muller. They had 3 children; all sons. Each one is listed with a different surname: Greiner-Schang (the oldest), Greiner-Jean (the 2nd) and Greiner-Bandel (the youngest).  Do you know what the hyphenated name means or is used for or where it comes from? Why would it be different so many times in the same family? (I have had as many as 5 different hyphenated surnames in a single Greiner family with the same parents.) I see absolutely NO correlation to the mother's maiden name or even the maternal grandmother's maiden/married name. I am currently working in the 1450-1780 time range. Thanks so much for any assistance.""  I heard back on a couple emails such as the one I sent to the German Genealogical Society and they have no clue; said they've never seen it done and cannot find it as such in records. I was hoping perhaps the hyphenated name was the glasshutte they worked for or the town where it was located but so far no link that way. Some of the more common hyphenated Greiner names are: Adam 24, Durr 86, Fuchs 81, Fuchsnikel 69, Gobes 44, Jobst 30, Matz 44, Schwarzer 44, Toffel 14, Tommelhans 17. The number behind the name indicates the number of records I have for that name.  The majority of the above are from the Miriam Zilli Grafer Index (she died several years ago) but I have found hyphenations in Dr. Rudi Greiner-Adam's books as well. "
140,"Finding 1896-1897 residence of William and Emily Mountjoy Rouse in Adelaide, South Australia?","I have been using the online Sands and Macdougall South Australian Directories to try and trace the residences of my great-grandfather William Rouse (born 26 Jul 1860 and baptized 26 Aug 1860 at Truro St Mary, Cornwall).  From the entries below I can see that in:   1894 he is living at Gilles Street, Adelaide and running an exotic nursery (I was always told that he had commercial rose gardens so this fits) at North Terrace, Kent Town.  He had been living in Gilles Street since 1888. 1895 he is doing the same as in 1894 but on 1 May 1895 he married Emily Mountjoy Creber 1896 he is still running the exotic nursery but his mother Agnes Rouse (nee Green) is listed at Gilles Street instead so I am assuming that he has moved out with his new wife but there is no residential address for him 1897 he is doing the same as in 1896 i.e. there is still no residential address for him 1898 he is still running the exotic nursery and now has a residential address of Mill Street, Clarence Park.  His second and third daughters, Priscilla Mountjoy and Ivy were born in 1900 and 1903 respectively at Clarence Park so the family lived there for some time.   1894:    1895:    1896:    1897:    1898:    I would like to try and determine where Wiliam and Emily Rouse were living in those first two years after they married.  Some things I have considered are:   living with Emily's parents (John Creber and Mary Patience Foot) but I know that until 1905 (when John died) they lived at Meadows Gully, Prospect Hill, which is about 25 miles away and not commutable. living with a sibling - William was the eldest son in Australia but had eight siblings in Adelaide and Emily had seven sisters (all but one older) living around South Australia - I have not ruled this out living onsite at the exotic nursery - I am not sure what evidence I could seek for this renting somewhere in Adelaide - I think this is the most likely because their first daughter Gladys Kathleen Rouse was born on 2 Feb 1896 in Adelaide   How would I find the residence of a newly married couple in 1890s Adelaide when they appear to have left their parental homes but are yet to have a new residence listed in the Sands and Macdougall directory?

Grace gave her age as 17 (I think it was just over 16 and half), and Matthew gave his as 19.  On their Marriage Certificate the two witnesses are clearly written (see below):   George Wills which I suspect would be her father (1806 - 1873) or brother (1841 - ?) Eliza Ann Wills     I would like to try and determine the identity of Eliza Ann Wills.  She does not appear to be a sister (and perhaps not a sister-in-law) to Grace because her siblings appear to have been:   Frances (1836 – ?) Mary Jane (1838 – ?) George (1841 – ?) may have married Ann about 1865 (based on first child born 1866) Richard (1843 – ?) married Louisa Trevorah in 1863 and they appear to have been living in New Zealand at the time William (1845 – ?) may not have married Eliza Davey (1847 – 1910) - one candidate but middle name does not match and appears to have been living in New Zealand at the time Sarah Ellen (1851 – 1868) Susan Mary (1853 – 1875) Edith Ann (1857 – 1894) - suggested by a cousin but was only 8 years old at the time Charles Henry Martin (1859 – 1916) was only 6 years old at the time   If not a sister or sister-in-law then I am thinking that perhaps she was a cousin to Grace, or maybe her aunt or married to her uncle.  So far I have found no likely candidate.  The last theory I have is that she is simply a friend who shares the same surname.  Before I try to exhaustively examine the Family and Neighbours (FAN) of Grace, I thought I would ask this question to see if anyone is aware of an Eliza Ann Wills living at the right time and right place to possibly have been the witness to this marriage?

142,Investigating Compulsory Acquisition of Land near Adelaide in first half of 20th century?,"I have asked a question previously about my great grandfather William Rouse (1860-1948) in Finding 1896-1897 residence of William and Emily Mountjoy Rouse in Adelaide, South Australia? and as I get further into the online Sands and Macdougall South Australian Directories I have become keen to learn more about a family story that was passed down to me about his ""rose gardens that were compulsorily acquired by the South Australian Government"".  So far I have learned that he actually had two nurseries:   Kent Town Nursery at 11 North Terrace, Kent Town (see picture from 1910 Sands and Macdougall directory below) which is adjacent to the CBD of Adelaide and only a stone's throw from the Adelaide Botanic Garden; and      another about two miles away at 96 Seventh Avenue, East Adelaide (abbreviated E.A. and often called St Peters; see picture below from 1939 Sands and Macdougall directory below).       I will be able to look at more directories to get the exact years that his nursery is listed at each address but the move from Kent Town to East Adelaide (St Peters) was between 1910 and 1920.    The Kent Town nursery is often referred to in the directories as Exotic Nursery and seems to be the same one written about in the South Australian Advertiser of 7 Feb 1881.  In the meantime I am wondering what sources there may be to investigate SA Land Ownership and Transfers in order to try and find the basis of our family story about ""compulsory acquisition by the South Australian Government""?

143,How can I quickly source 'events' in Mac Family Tree?,"I am using Mac Family Tree currently as my primary 'tree' database and my biggest issue with it is the ease of 'sourcing' events.   As of this post I am running version 7.3.2.(and as of 7.5 still exists)  My understanding of the way to 'source' something is:   Create the event under the person. Go to the far right gear and click ""Edit Event"" (which takes you to another screen)  Scroll down to the Sources section of the event.  Click ""Add New Source"" or ""Add Existing Source"" If you click ""Add Existing Source"" brings up a dialog where you can selective your repetitive sources like Census Years.  Then once added, you can enter the further details like page, etc..  If you are adding a new source it is another 2 screens deep you have to proceed, then return to step 5 and 6.  Once step 5 and 6 are complete you have to hit back to return to the person. Repeat for each new event. So if adding occupation in year and place of residence for example for a person from a single census you have to repeat this twice.   I have read the manual, broke down and watched the YouTube video for an older verison, and even filed feature requests with the software. Per this generic review, adding sources is ""easy"", so I just want to make sure I am not missing something or if there is an easier way. My personal expectation is that I would be able to right click and add a source from the event in the person screen, just like add an existing location.  Adding a source from to the 'person' is a somewhat similar process, but it does not tie to the event just generically to the person. I am a previous user of Family Tree Maker it was SO much easier on it so I hope I am just missing something.      Is there a way to source an event within a person Mac Family Tree from the person screen?   "

I know there is a separate question for when someone is re-interred (buried and then reburied), but his question is assuming they have not yet been buried yet or are going to be cremated nor have made it to a funeral home as of yet.  This is also assuming that distance travel is is possible (requiring refrigeration/ice) across distances, and that the death certificates I have seen reference funeral homes it is not clear how it all works and IF any publicly available information is generated.   I am also assuming long distance transportation of deceased individuals is relatively new for the general public and even the US military did local burials I believe (off the top of my head) until Korea or Vietnam.   I have read the following seeking clues, but not any clearer..   Transporting Human Remains  SW Airlines Transport Policy that mentions regulations vary by state  Chicago Police Policy for transport of deceased  How to transport from a funeral home site   So the question being, are any records besides funeral home records generated for the transport of the deceased and if possible how was it different pre-WWII?  Note I have not personally had to do it, so am also not clear if it is a local funeral home (not the hospital / coroner) responsible for arranging transport and if it LAW or marketing that a funeral home to funeral home arrangement similar to the transport of firearms that is allowed.

She married first Francis Eaton (Mayflower) then Francis Billington (another Mayflower passenger).    Several family trees try to tie her to the Penn family through the Admiral Sir William's uncle George, but that seems unlikely, and many of those trees have that uncle George dying in Plymouth in 1632- which isn't likely to be true as the Admiral Sir William's will in 1670 refers to his uncle, ""George Penn late of the fforest of Brayden in the County of Wilts gent Deceased"".  Which makes sense, as George was the eldest son and named his grandfather's main heir and executor in the grandfathers 1590/1 will, making him the owner of Penn's Lodge in the vicinity of Minety, Wilts.  This points to the likelihood that George Penn also died there and did not go to Plymouth Colony.    I haven't been able to find any sources of Christian Penn's ancestry other than the ones that tie her to Admiral Sir William's extended family.

From the map provided, this location appears not too far from Lake Superior.      The description in Wikipedia for ""Brome County,"" is interesting because    IGI (submitted) records report baptisms at Shefford for two of Lemuel's older siblings, Caroline Preston (1819-1839) and Michael Merrill Preston (1821-after 1845). 2 A sketch about Lemuel's older brother Joseph William Preston (1826-1893) reports he (Joseph) was born at Standstead. 3    Help identifying ""Broome, L.C."" from both a geographic and jurisdictional perspective is much appreciated.

154,Organizing Research: Should I start a binder system?,"In today's day and age, are newbies still starting binder systems? I am reading Unpuzzling Your Past, 4th edition by Emily Anne Croom and it is very good. She advocates binders that organize by generation and location.     Probably three times as many genealogical organizing systems exist as there are genealogists, for many change their systems along the way. There is no right or wrong way to organize, but there are better and worse ways. The worse ways include spiral notebooks and storage space on the dining room table. The better ways are numerous, usually involving three-ring binders, file folders, or a combination of the two. ...Some genealogists prefer a binder or file folder for each person, or each ancestral couple, with all the notes and documents pertaining to them stored in their binder or folder. I personally prefer binders that contain all my notes on the generations that lived in the same county or same state. I don't want (1) the expense of making three copies of documents that contain information on three brothers or (2) to spend time filing the copies in three folders when I return from research. When I study my notes, I want to see the interaction of family members and generations without having to pull a number of folders and then sort and refile papers.   As she mentions, many people change their systems along the way... I'd just like to start out right. I already have too much loose 'note' paper with scribbles on it; searches that have been completed (whether they found anything or not), hand drawn charts, etc. I know that I am re-doing searches that I have already done, because I seem to keep losing my place between research frenzies. And although I use the computer to input my 'proven' data... There are still lots of questionable details that I don't feel confident enough yet committing to the main tree. So even though I'm using genealogical software, inputting references, linking documents that I find... I still don't seem to be going without paper. Is it time to start a binder system? Or is that just old fashioned, repetitive and redundant?  UPDATE: I am not asking for a description of members' filing systems. I am asking a yes/no question whether people starting genealogy recording now (in the day of computers) still need to plan/anticipate having a hybrid system of computer+paper records? Or is that just duplication and redundancy?  ANSWER SELECTED: The answers provided are all excellent and seem in agreement that starting a strictly paper system in this day of computer software is redundant. I particularly like @Sue Adam's comment: ""I think that strict adherence to this kind of filing system is limiting, overly time consuming and repetitive.""  @Fortier pointed out that our ""use"" of a documentary source (possibly with computer software) can be separate from how we ""preserve"" or store said source.  I now feel more confident in starting a binder (or two) to collect and organize some of my research and original documents, without feeling that I am somehow embarking upon a commitment to duplicate what is already in my computer. That being said, like @lkessler, I am a visual person and will likely print out paper copies from time to time. He says, “Having them sitting in hardcopy in front of you makes them much easier to visualize when you're trying to solve a puzzle, or see what you have and what you're missing.” "
155,Understanding marriage certificate (transfer?) in Nordrhein-Westfalen Archive?,"This record is in the Nordrhein-Westfalen Archive (www.archive.nrw.de).   The players: My GG Grandfather was Karl Theodor Brenner (CT Brenner), born near or in Overath on November 27th, 1811 . His father was Friedrich Wilhelm Brenner (FW Brenner), of whom I know nothing about.  CT Brenners mother was Johanna Christina Carolina Paulus, born in Rösrath, Prussia on September 8th, 1792. And lastly: Johann Wilhelm Forsbach (b. 1786 in Rösrath-Unterlüghause).    The reason the above dates are important for this mystery is the fact that Carolina Paulus was pregnant with CT Brenner while this marriage license was being transferred to Johann Wilhelm Forsbach.   The story: Once upon a time, probably in the middle of the night, I did a random Google search for the birthdate and birth place for CT Brenner. Low and behold I discovered a record in a database (view here!) that had all the correct information, except the last name was Paulus; his mothers maiden.  I contacted the database creator, Bernd Schumalski of Germany, who thankfully understands English fairly well.    Not only did he confirm that CT Brenner was born as a illegitimate child of Friedrich Wilhelm Brenner, he is also a relative through the Paulus line.  Very cool!  My living family tree just exponentiated. Bernd was also the one who pointed me toward the NRW archive.    The mystery: This document is not digitized so I'm only working off the descriptive title: ""Heiratsurkunde des Friedrich Wilhelm Brenner aus Schlüchtern (Grafschaft Hanau) zwecks Heirat mit Carol. Christ. Paulus zu Forsbach 1810-1811.""  Translated by Google, it says ""Marriage certificate of Frederick William Brenner from Schluechtern (county of Hanau) for the purpose of marriage to Carol. Christ. Paulus to Forsbach.""  *****The NRW Archive search results display in a heirarchical category view. This record is categorized in: Landesarchiv NRW Abteilung Rheinland > Großherzogtum Berg > Präfektur des Rheindepartements und Unterpräfekturen > Personenstandswesen > (record here).    Am I interpreting this correctly... as a transfer of marriage license?  If so, and assuming they weren't common with a pregnant mother, can you think of any circumstances or events that might have created this scenario?  Perhaps the death of FW Brenner, prison, military duty, political duty? In regards to the mention of Schleuchtern, Hanau as being ""From"", would a document like this list that in reference to his birthplace, or just where he happened to be living in 1811?   More information just in case it helps:   CT Brenner went all the way to Chur, Switzerland to marry his first wife, Dorathea Fischer. They moved back somewhere near Cologne and had two boys; Frederick William Brenner (b. 1834) and Charles Eduard Brenner (b. 1838). Dorathea died in 1841. CT Brenner and his two sons emigrated to America in 1850, eventually settling in Saginaw, Michigan after brief stays in New York and Ohio. Sometime around 1854 he married Anna Maria Fischer, (b. 1824, in Switzerland) The historical accounts of early Saginaw describe CT Brenner as having very useful political, industrial, and business experience (as well as a fair amount of cash it seems).  Within a short time he built, owned and operated a hotel, a lumber mill, a salt mine, and numerous real estate ventures including the Grand Rapids City Hall.  He was also reluctantly voted into city politics as an Alderman.    He had a deep interest in the affairs of Europe, and in his later days he declared himself to be in competition to outlive both Queen Victoria and Pope Leo. His greatest enjoyment toward the end was reading the daily papers for news of the death of his two competitors.  CT Brenners death certificate names Theodor and Margarethe Brenner as his parents, and I don't know where to go with that one.  Birth records for Friedrich Willhelm Brenner or Theodor Brenner could not be located (in person) in the Wahlscheid registers.  Sidenotes to the endnotes:  Family lore has it that we are originally Swiss, but the only evidence so far is the birthplace of CT Brenner's wives.  An article appeared in the New York Tribune (Feb 14, 1908) stating that CT Brenner was the brother of the newly elected President of Switzerland, Dr. Ernst Brenner.  taken literally this is impossible because Swiss records show Ernst Brenner's dad to be younger than CT Brenner.  Maybe a weird uncle. "
156,Is this Match a Half Niece or a Second Cousin?,"A DNA match for a woman has shown up on my Ancestry DNA as a second cousin with 490 cM. I recently discovered that I am thought to be the half sister of this woman's mother. My full sister shares 446 cM with the woman and my full brother shares 363 cM with her.   Could this girl be the daughter of a half sister?   Using  [website]The generated chart showed a 4.47% chance that I could be the woman's ""half"" aunt. I understand it to show a better chance of me being a second cousin. I also checked my sister's at 446 cM and it only showed a 1.5% chance. My brother's at 363 cM didn't show at all as a ""half"" uncle.   I'm really confused by all this. From what I have read, these numbers fall below the minimum of the range. My father also has 4 brothers. My father and his siblings are all deceased. My sister and I have uploaded our DNA to GEDmatch. We are hoping the woman will do the same.   Should we be able to determine the relationship through GEDmatch?   So far, Ancestry has been very accurate in predicting relationships. "
157,Working with DNA results for multiple profiles across multiple sites,"I manage a number of DNA profiles (for related individuals) across a number of sites:   FamilyTreeDNA (5 profiles) MyHeritage (5 profiles) LivingDNA (2 profiles which will increase to 5 in the near future) Ancestry (1 profile) 23andMe (1 profile) Gedmatch (5 profiles)   Each profile has a plethora of matches at each site; some of these overlap because the match also has their profile at multiple sites. Some of the matches have been correlated with an MRCA; some have not (yet).  (There are also sets of significant 'negative' results -- profiles that could be expected to match under some scenarios and don't).  And I also have a couple of totally unrelated profiles that I manage as a favour to people who tested at my behest but turned out not to be related.  I want to establish a method of working (including record keeping) that allows me to work across the multiple sites to assess likely connections -- if Profile A on site X matches profile B, and B also tested at site Y and matches profile C who hasn't tested at X but did test at Z and matches profile D there... and the matching chromosome segments all overlap...  I'm aware of the product Genome Mate Pro but I want to understand the possible (and best?) ways of working before grabbing a tool which may or may not be the right solution. (Although I don't discount using a tool that's ""good enough"" and adjusting my method of working to match the tool, you first have to be able to assess whether something is ""good enough"").  So: What are the key requirements and considerations for a process or tool(set) to support working with multiple profiles, multiple matches, multiple sites? (I am not looking for a software recommendation, but for guidance on requirements and process that may lead to a software selection or to something else). "
158,"Was Daniel Rich (Jr.?) the grandson of Jacob Rich? Or, the confusing case of Daniel Rich (Sr.?) and Nancy Marshall","I apologize up front, because this is going to be a long, rambling and confusing question, but here goes:  With a high degree of certainty, I can trace one branch of my family tree back to one Daniel Rich (1816 - 1890). For clarity, I will call him Daniel Jr., even though I don't know if that is accurate. The issue arises with his parents and his potential connection to one John Rich/Johannes Reich, which I will get to.   First, a brief map showing the geography of the area in question, the northern Vermont/New Hampshire Border region:      Now, the first half of the story, working backwards from present:  According to his death certificate, Daniel Rich Jr. was 74 years, 2 months and 28 days old when he died on June 30, 1890, which would make his date of birth April 2, 1816, in Lyme, NH (which is south of the area shown in the map above). [As an aside, note the cause of death - anthrax. I assume he farmed sheep]    Now, you will see that his father is listed as Daniel Rich as well, I'll call him Daniel Sr., born in Northumberland, NH, and his mother is listed as Nancy Marshall, born in Stark, NH. So far, so good.  Now, things start to get a bit difficult. I can't find a birth certificate for Daniel Jr. This area was still basically the frontier in 1816, so I'm not shocked by this. However, I also can't find any marriage license or birth records for Daniel Rich Sr. and Nancy Marshall. And they don't show up in the Census together either. However, there is a great deal of paperwork (marriage licenses of children, death certificates, Census, etc.) for one Daniel Rich and Sophia P. Chase. And, if you look on Find-A-Grave, you will find a Daniel Rich (1790 - 1868) who it was claimed was married to Sophia Prescott Chase around 1817 and who died in Northumberland, NH. But the list of children does not include anyone named Daniel.   So, what to do? Well, it turns out I may be able to approach it from the other direction. And so begins Part 2.....    The second half of the story, working forwards from the past.  Now, before anyone says it, yes, I know that one of the cardinal rules of genealogical research is that you don't start from some person you want to be related to and work your way forward trying to prove yourself right. However, family story has it that this part of the family is descended from John Rich (1729 - 1813) of Maidstone, Vt., who was a German immigrant born Johannes Reich. And, there is a great deal of information on him and his children thanks to this book: [website]Anyway, John Rich had 9 children - 3 girls and 6 boys. Of the boys, one died as a toddler and one, named Daniel (of course!), died at age 20 with no kids. Of the 4 remaining boys, only 1, Jacob Rich (1770 - 1827), had a son named Daniel. So he is the only possible direct connection between John Rich and Daniel Rich Jr. from above. But, once again, I can't find birth, marriage, or death records for him.  But wait, there's more! In an effort to fill in the gaps, I read the article on Maidstone, Vt. in the Vermont Historical Gazetteer, Volume 1 ([website]Finally, the summary!  First, if you actually made it this far into the question, kudos, you are more patient than I am. Anyway, what do we have?  Known Ancestor - Daniel Rich Jr., son of Daniel Rich Sr. and Nancy Marshall  Suspected Ancestor - Daniel Rich, son of Jacob Rich, but married to Sophia Chase.  Connection - Moody Rich, younger brother of Daniel Rich, married to Sally Marshall, who had a younger sister named Nancy Marshall.  Which leads to several questions:  1. Is Nancy Marshall, the mother of Daniel Rich Jr., the same person as Nancy Marshall, sister of Sally Marshall?  2. Is Daniel Rich Sr. the same person as Daniel Rich, son of Jacob Rich?  3. If the answer to both of the above is ""yes,"" what was the nature of the relationship between Daniel Rich Sr. and Nancy Marshall? There is no evidence that they were married, and both were married to other people shortly after Daniel Rich Jr. was born. A quick marriage followed by a divorce or annulment seems incredibly unlikely in 1816. An out of wedlock birth is certainly the most obvious possibility, but if that is the case, how likely is it that the resulting child would know not only his mother's real name, but also her place of birth (for the death certificate)? How common and accepted were out of wedlock children in early 19th century frontier New England?  I don't expect anyone to actually know the answers to these questions of course, but I was hoping I might get some good suggestions on how I might approach finding the answers to these questions. "
159,Are there general notions of distance between individuals in a genealogy?,"The terminology Nth cousin Mth removed is common, but I was wondering if there are other notions of ""distance"" on genealogies? For example looking at the Cousin tree (with genetic kinship) chart at the ISOGG Wiki, we see that both first cousin and grand-aunt share ~12.5% of the genome IBD with the individual labeled ""self"". They both are also 4 links away through their MRCAs. Is there a common notion of genealogical distance that captures this? "

161,Can Ancestry.com DNA matches be wrong,"I (female) had an unexpected half sister match (1,866 cM across 49 segments) in Ancestry.com. We are about the same age so I'm assuming sibling. Upon closer examination I realized my brother(A) was actually a half sibling match (1,696 cM across 72 segments)  and not a full brother. This explains why I didn't match anyone related to our father unless it was a descendant of our mother too. And there are dozens of matches to my new half sibling's family to me. My apparent biological father lived two miles from my family. I'm okay with all of this and it actually explains a lot of my childhood but my brother is livid. He thinks it's all a scam or an error.  Also, the daughter (my niece) of another brother (B) matches the new biological family which would point to this brother being a full siblings having the same (new) biological father. This brother's DNA is not in the system. He won't add it because he too thinks this whole scenario is crazy and it is maligning our mother! Both fathers are deceased, hence no DNA from them.  This would have to be a lot of errors! I'm new at this and don't know how to go about verifying these results. How can I prove what's in Ancestry.com is legitimate? Has anyone ever had a ""wrong"" match before? And wrong when there are this many matches?  Too make matters worse, my brother A and I sent our DNA to another company of his choice (Biogene) and it came back as 97% full siblings which indicates Ancestry.com is wrong. I don't know how this could be. I can't find out much on Biogene so don't know if it is reputable or not.  My new half sister hasn't responded so I'm assuming she is trying to reconcile the connection. It is not my intention to disrupt anyone's life so I don't think she's going to be helpful.  Wow, so much to say! First, someone tell me if I'm posting at the right place. Do I edit my original post in this manner or add a comment?  We did cheek swabs with Biogene. My brother ordered the tests. He was looking specifically for a sibling test. He doesn't believe cM's will tell him anything. We don't live close to each other (thank goodness, excuse the editorial).  I've tried to call the company for an explanation of the test and why I don't see cM's on the result. They will not talk to me. I've tried to do research on Biogene but can find very little that's not related to their own PR.  My brother thinks they are the number one DNA company out there.   My brother will not use the companies you suggest as he says it's all a con game and they just want your money. I've pleaded with him to use GEDmatch to no avail.    I have called Ancestry. They were very cordial but really not much help. Just gave me links to their online info.   As far as my new match possibly not being a half sister, I've examined this inside out. I'm definitely new to this game but I'm trying to be organized and methodically and definitely leave the emotion out of it (except for the stress my brother is causing!).  I am not related to any of my father's (my surname) relatives who are in the system.  We were able to get my mother's DNA before this scenario popped up. She is not related to any of my new unexpected matches. My niece from brother B matches the same people I do (with less cM's) and also does not match my father's relatives. This is less officially but a pic of possible biological father as a young man looks amazingly like brother B.   Can I add a screen print of the results from Biogene here if I omit the header with names?  Thanks to everyone who has taken an interest in helping me. I don't have a clue how to rectify this.  My niece who is the daughter of brother B whom I believe must also have the same suspected biological father as me has this relationship to me: 1,652 cM across 62 segments   I can't get the prt scr to work here for the Biogene test results, Any suggestions?  Biogene report   I can't get the cM matches between my niece and my potential half sister. No one is speaking to me! "
162,What is the proper way to denote that a person is known by his/her middle name?,"For people who are known by a name which isn't their first name, it is common to write that name in quotes preceding the surname, such as Thomas ""Tom"" Fudd, or Guy Thomas ""Toddy"" Nichols.  What is the convention when a person goes by their middle name?  Walter Peter Nobb (AKA Peter Nobb)  Would it be correct to say Walter Peter ""Peter"" Nobb? That seems redundant. And yet to say Walter ""Peter"" Nobb gives no indication that Peter is the middle name in addition to being the name the person is known by. "
163,Adequacy of DNA evidence -- how can I improve it?,"Individuals H and J are 2nd cousins (supported by a strong documentation trail) who share two ancestors: John Charles Wright (circa 1830-1904) and Caroline Ellen Brown (circa 1827 – 1871). They share 223cm of DNA which is comfortably within the range of 2nd cousins (DNAPainter).  H and J have a common match (on Ancestry) D who descends from Henry Dillistone Brown born 15 May 1852 in Sawbridgeworth, Hertfordshire, illegitimate son of Caroline Ellen Augusta Brown (also supported by a strong documentation trail).  They share 24.3cm which is (just) feasible for half-second cousins (which the documentation suggests.) (also DNAPainter)  I have double-checked the documentation trails and am happy that they are robust (including determining that the mother of Caroline Ellen Augusta Brown was resident in April 1861 at the address at which Caroline Ellen Brown gave birth to my ancestor in May 1861, and that Ellen the mother of Henry Dillistone Brown signed his Royal Navy enlistment papers as Ellen Wright.)  Although I'm comfortable that the two Carolines are the same person, would these DNA results unsupported by the smoking gun of the mother's residence be sufficient to conclude that Caroline Ellen Augusta Brown and Caroline Ellen Brown are the same person or would I need to look for further DNA evidence? If so, how would I go about it? "
164,Determining cause of 1958 death in England?,"I have an ancestor who died rather young (late forties) at a time when there was no major military conflict.

He died in England in 1958 according to a death registration which contains only the district, year of birth and year of death but no one in my family ever met him so we can't contact any immediate family as of right now.

I have managed to find the birth register (haven't got the certificates right now but may in future) for all of the children. However, a problem arises in that I think Annie fibbed about her age on the 1911 census, as the age on the 1911 census doesn't fit with the age on the 1939 register.  We think they would have married in Cheshire somewhere.  Here's what I have:   1939 Register (subscription required) 1911 census (subscription required)   To summarise the links:  1911 Register lists Annie Elizabeth Ward as the wife of James Spencer Ward, them having been married for 11 years and four children Evelyn, Rose G, Thomas, and James Spencer (Jr). It lists Annie's age as 28 and James' as 31.  The 1939 register shows Annie's birth date as being 20th July 1881. They are registered as living at 6 Mill Street, Chester. "

However, I've looked for James Spencer Ward on the 1901 and he's living in a different house with his father, James Spencer Ward Sr, and he's working as a GPO telegraph wireman. I can't seem to find Annie Elizabeth anywhere on the 1901 census.   What's going on here?   Could the marriage record year be wrong or is there something else afoot?  It all seems like a big mess and something is wrong here. "

They were most likely Jews and he was a shop owner in Safi.  How would you go about looking into British records of citizens living abroad in those days? It would be best to find business records or marriage records.  As I'm Israeli, it's difficult to visit Morocco to find answers, so I'm hoping to find answers through foreign governments.

I have found the baptismal records of many of his children and verified that the surname was spelled Jurkiewicz, such as in the baptism of his daughter Katharine (first on the page).

175,"Were godparents always married, and did they always live in the same village?","While going through some Ukrainian Greek Catholic baptismal records from the 19th century, I have made two observations which I want to validate:   Most godparents appear to be married. This is at least true for the women, since it always lists the husbands name too as a qualifier for who the woman is. So far as I can tell, men don't appear as godparents of anybody until they're married too. Godparents usually lived in the same town. This is a little harder to validate since the records don't say where the godparents are from, but it does list their occupation. Usually the occupation is oppidanei which is Latin for townsmen. Though sometimes it does say ""local farmer"" or ""local shoemaker"".   Are these assumptions safe? Is it likely for a godparent to have been single in the 19th century? Or is it likely that a godparent didn't live in the same village as the child? "
176,Managing the Multiple Maybes,"My question is related to this previous question, but I think I'm looking for a rather different answer because I'm not sure a second software genealogical software package is what I'm looking for. It's also related to this previous question of mine, but now I'm looking for tools/ data storage ideas rather than research strategies. I'm aware of GenQuiry but for my own needs would need something that is not Windows-specific.  As we traverse back each generation, we have research questions (""who was Jane Smith's mother?"") and hypotheses (""the Mary Jones who was born in Bradford in 1780 to James and Anne Jones and who married Fred Smith in Leeds in 1802""), which we can support with evidence.   But before you get to anything quite so precise, there are multiple candidates to consider. Suppose you've just found the birth record of an ancestor (and you're comfortable identifying it as such) and now you know the name of their father. Now it's time to find the father. My preferred approach is to do a broad search on a range of sites (I tend to use Ancestry.com and FamilySearch together, and independent sources of parish records like the Isle of Man archives if that is relevant) and develop a list of candidate people / records. Then it's a matter of winnowing down the list, ruling out the ones it can't be.      It can't be that one, he died as an infant. And it can't be that one, it's too far from where the Census record said he was born. And it can't be that one, because I'm pretty sure he's the one who married her and moved to this entirely different village and didn't have any children with the same name as my ancestor.   My question is, are there preferred tools or methods for storing   The list of candidate personae to be narrowed down The bits and bobs of evidence, records and conclusions that result in that narrowing down   Right now I've got Excel spreadsheets of candidate people, Word documents and notebooks on my iPad full of notes and stray sources, and pages of handwritten notes. My core trees (in Mac Family Tree 7), with the things I am confident of, are clean and sourced and nice, but this preliminary stuff is a mess.   To give you an example, here is a transcription of some notes out of one of my physical notebooks, which allowed me to make a conclusion about the birth record and parents of my ancestor Ann Crowe. (I already had her marriage record to Thomas Quayle, and I knew that I was looking for a Thomas and Ann who had a daughter Ann Eliza.)     Found Ann Eliza Quayle in Jurby in 1841 Census, Father Thomas 45yo -> b ~ 1790, mother Ann 30yo -> b 1810-11. There is an Ann Crow born in Ballaugh 1810 (or christened anyway) to Charles Crow and Margaret Caley (d Ann + Dan Caley according to her will [link]).      Although 1841 Census tended to round to nearest 5 years this is too far from birth dates of 1800 or 1802. On this basis we can rule out the d. of Wm Crowe and Anne Keenen (b 1800) or of John Crowe and Ann Boyd (b 1801).   I can imagine something like Circus Ponies Notebook, DevonThink, Yojimbo or Evernote being useful for collecting this source/thought mash-up. But has anyone developed some principles or tools to help manage this pre-hypothesis research material? "
177,Finding half-sister who may still be living?,"My father (1919-1984) married a woman (born in 1922) in 1943 and had a daughter on 6/18/44 whose name is unknown, prior to getting divorced and marrying my mother.    They were married for only a few years.    The marriage took place in NYC, same about the birthplace.    Me and my siblings (all from the 2nd marriage) are desperately looking for our half-sister.    The information we have is:   Marriage certificate containing my father and his prior spouse details and birth date Birth record of my sister containing the date (no names)   I've tried searching their names on FamilySearch and Ancestry etc. and found no results.    Is this the right board to post names?  P.S. Both my father's and his bride's surnames are very distinct names, I'm sure it refines the search options, does it? "
178,Tracing ancestors in 20th century Romania?,"Sanda Yordanova Genova was born in Braila in 1911.   Yordan Genov Date of birth: 06/02/1907 Place of birth: Cerna Name of spouse: Maria Todorova Ilieva  Nikola Todorov Bonchev Date of birth: 10/09/1902 Place of birth: Cerna Name of spouse: Stanka Andreeva Dimova/ She was born in Nalban, Romania   All of them are Bulgarian and moved to Romania because Bulgaria was under Ottoman rule at the time. But in 1940, according to the stipulations of the Treaty of Craiova, the Bulgarian population from Cerna was resettled to Southern Dobruja. They moved back to Bulgaria, but I am sure that some of the family members have stayed there. I have two problems:   I am pretty sure that the names will be different in Romanian which may reduce my chances to find information. How can I find possible Romanian variants of these names? I could go to Romania, but I do not speak the Romanian   How do I begin researching Romanian ancestors? What places could hold useful records?  "
179,Is immigrant sponsor information archived somewhere?,"A family I am researching fled Germany in the 1930s and settled in Illinois. In the ship's manifest, they listed one relative as a sponsor, but according to a member of that family, several sponsors were required. I am wondering if this sponsorship information is available somewhere, and, if so, how I go about finding it. Is it in NARA? In regional archives? "
180,Is there a comprehensive repository of pre-1841 local censuses in Britain available online?,"The first national Census in Britain was in 1841, but there are several local enumerations of populations of particular parishes and towns, for example:   The parish censuses listed in the answers to this question The 1795 census of the parish of Horsforth in Yorkshire West Riding mentioned on this Genuki page   In the answers to that earlier question, two books/monographs were mentioned   Census Listings, 1522-1930: Holdings in the British Isles by Gibson and Medlycott Pre-1841 Censuses and Population Listings in the British Isles by Colin R Chapman   Neither of these is available online in complete form, though there is a preview of the latter that provides some interesting methodological information about the 1841 Census and its precursors.   But is there a comprehensive source of these records available online, which researchers outside the UK can use? It is worth noting that even though these earlier censuses did not always name everyone in a household, they can still be useful for genealogical purposes, allowing one to establish, for example:   How many households or households of a particular name there were in a particular location, and therefore how likely there are to be multiple people of the same name in that location at that time. (Is that Mary Thing daughter of John Thing the same Mary Thing that is my ancestor? Or was Thing a common name in Whatsitham?) Number of people per household can help establish of there are any children in that household that you've missed.  "

I thought DNA was either A, T, C, or G (Adenine, Thymine, Cytosine and Guanine), so what the heck is R? Does it mean a defect in the DNA or the test failed to resolve that value?  Would a retest with a new sample fix the issue?  Would a new lab test with the old sample fix the issue?  Is there any issue?  I see a table of FASTA DNA Codes that says R means either A or G. "
188,What do these extra numbers mean on this ship manifest?,"I have a ship manifest for the Vaderland, run by Red Star, departing from Antwerp, Belgium and arriving at New York, New York on November 4, 1904: On line 21 is a Robert Gregorčič fromm Austria and of Slovenian descent.

See:   line 10, column 6: 7x33705 6-16-41(?) line 14, column 6: 8x–33616–505–3/3/42 line 21, column 8: 12x – 3100 – (505) 3/25/37 line 22, column 8: 12x – 2810 – (505) 9/29/36 line 27, column 6: 2x66155 12/17/37   What do these mean?  I notice that 505 occurs several times.  Could these be passport numbers and country numbers?  Could the dates be birthdate of their fathers?  The dates are all between 1836 and 1842, suggesting dates for parents of the travellers.  Why would these extra dates be collected and only for some passengers?  In particular, I'm most interested in the entries on line 21 and 22 for my ancestors whose origins I know very little. "

190,Partial matches on Triangulated DNA segments,"With DNA information from FamilyTreeDNA, I have determined trangulation groups. I have chromosome segments of significant size (> 10 cM) over which A (myself) matches B (my known cousin) and A (myself) matches C (some third parties) and I've found out from my cousin that B matches all the C's as well over the entire segment.  This 3-way triangulation is considered extremely reliable and all the third party matches will almost assuredly be related to me and my cousin's MRCA (Most Recent Common Ancestors) and/or some of their ancestors.  I've assigned these matched chromosome segments in my DNA to have originated from my and my cousin's common ancestors.  So now that I have this information, my question is what happens with the people I have found that match me and some of the third parties on one of those segments, but don't match my cousin?  Or the people who match my cousin on one of those segments, but don't match me?   Is there an explanation for this?     To make this clearer, here is a concrete example.    The yellow line with the green X's near the top is my uncle's match on Chromosome 1 with my known third cousin, we'll call Joel. The green X's on that line is the segment where my uncle matches Joel.  Note the green X's of the other 29 lines. The green X area are the exact segments where those people match my uncle AND where those people match Joel. (I got Joel's segment match list from him so that I can do this).   (The pink and blue areas are where that person only matches my uncle, or only matches Joel, but that's really not relevant for this question).  But since we have a segment between 170876383 and 183564808 on chromosome 1 for each of the 29 people who match both my uncle and Joel somewhere on that range, then that is three way triangulation (A matches B, B matches C, and C matches A) and that means that all 29 people are pretty well guaranteed to have a common ancestor who is either my uncle and Joel's common ancestor, or an ancestor further back.  I thought that once this Triangulation segment is arrived at, then anyone else who matches either my uncle or Joel anywhere on the green area must also be in this group with a common ancestor.    But then I found these people, each of whom were only in one of the match files:    The people in column B match either my uncle (Harry) or Joel in Column A. But if they are matching to Harry, they are not in Joels match list. And if they are matching to Joel, they are not in Harry's match list. A large part of those matches is over the 170876383 to 183564808 range where Joel and Harry match with green X's for their common ancestor.  Each of those people are in only one match list, either Harry's or Joel's. Some of the segment lengths are quite significant, and it's unlikely the 13.18 and 12.81 cM segments are not IBD.   So I am confused as to how this can be and I'm looking for possible explanations. "
191,How long after birth would a Catholic baptism have occurred in the late 19th Century in Mexico?,"How long after an infant's birth would the baptism have occurred in the Catholic church in the 1890s in Mexico? I've found a record of a baptism that may be my grandfather's, but it is almost a year after he was born. This seemed odd to me so I thought I would check. Thoughts? "
192,Citing or crediting leads to sources?,"Many of the sources that I have found were a direct result of finding references to them on genealogy websites. For example, a reference on Ancestry.com to FindAGrave.com led me to performing my own searches directly from the originating source (FindAGrave). Another example was finding a copy of one ancestor’s death certificate on FamilySearch.org which took me to SeekingMichigan.org where I could conduct my searches directly. My question, then, is do I need to credit Ancestry.com or FamilySearch.org in the citations for all the records that I find on FindAGrave.com or SeekingMichigan.org, respectively? If so, how do I add that credit to the citation? Or is adding the two genealogical research sites as repositories acceptable? "
193,How accurate are birth dates on the 1939 Register?,"One of the most useful pieces of information on the 1939 Register is the date of birth, since there are no other country-wide records containing birth dates other than civil registration records. Finding a birth date on the Register has solved a brick wall I had for one of my great grandfathers with a very common name; without this information I was unable to determine which birth certificate was the correct one.  But, how accurate is the date of birth field on the 1939 Register? I am not talking about FindMyPast's transcription accuracy – which does leave something to be desired. Rather, has anyone systematically assessed how accurate is the original data?  I understand that no evidence of date of birth was required when householders filled in the National Registration schedule. In browsing the records I have come across a few records with incorrect birth year or birth days. However, given that the Register was later used as the basis for NHS registers, I would hope that errors in the data would be reasonably small.  I think it is important to assess the data accuracy because a lot of birth dates on family trees will be drawn from this dataset – it is a much cheaper alternative to obtaining a birth certificate. If 1% of birth dates are incorrect, that may be acceptable, but if 20% are incorrect then we may need to treat this birth date data with extreme caution.  "
194,How to effectively communicate your tree for DNA Matches in first contact emails?,"In genealogy in general there is a lot of ‘cousin hunting’ but in DNA Genealogy where people do not necessarily also have published trees for you to explore but you are reasonably close matches you have to sometimes make a shot in the dark in your initial communications with the individual match to try to find common ancestor.   This usually seems to be most helpful if you keep it high level narrowed down to last names and be decisive with your information. I have been trying to revise my first contact email for autosomal (ftDNA FamilyFinder, AncestryDNA, 23andMe) matches as well as Y-DNA &amp; mtDNA matches. Other than some specific information included in the introduction of the email I try to convey basic information back to about 5-6 generations which is the effective normal reach of the Autosomal test; though I have had good matches up to 8. Conveying less than 4 though based on most of my matches is usually not effective.   I have not had good luck with graphic screenshots of trees, charts (especially the Fan Chart and Double Ancestor), PDFs, or even GEDs and had much more success with basic text outline. As well Ancestry.com and some other sites messaging system only allow text.   So I have been trying to refine my text outline format for DNA Matching Communications without it becoming confusing and keeping my entire message under 1 printed page if not shorter. I have also tried additional indentation to the bullets and not all email clients (or stack exchange) handle this well or excessive wrapping makes it unreadable to those, especially if they are reading it on their phone. I also do not want to get all crazy with highlighting / coloring as it would be lost in b&amp;w printing.   I am really looking for something simple and not over whelming but conveys the information. It does not need to be out of a program.  The following example is for one line I have used but feel it becomes confusing about generation 5 and start adding previous generation’s name as well as do not always include beyond generation 5.   I have tried other variations of it including 5 generations in 5 lines but I even get lost in it.  Note I use mother / father abbreviations vs. the Great GGG abbreviation to try to denote which side of the family and make it easier to track.  I am really looking for something simple and not over whelming ** but conveys the basic information.**     What are others doing to communicate this same set of information clearly in the same format without overloading the individual being messaged?   Convention:    Each Generation adds a letter to the right side of the label. M=Mother, F=Father; not Male/Female. (Location Abbreviation) The solid FFF.. line is the Y-DNA line and the solid MMM.. is the mtDNA line. The number of families doubles each generation and I usually build these templates out to at least 8 generations (if the information is available) for each individual I am administering their DNA test results.    Note: All but target individual are deceased in this example and I am more than 2 generation removed from it.   Generation 1   a.    S.  Target Individual (IL)  Generation 2 (Parents)   a.    F. Souser ** (PA) / M. Van Duesen (Van Dusen) in (IL)  Generation 3 (Grand Parents) (2 Familie)  a.    FF. Souser (PA) ** / FM. Averill (IL)  b.    MF. Van Duesen or Van Dusen / MM. Allen   (IL)  Generation 4 (Great Grand Parents) (4 Families)   a.    FFF. Souser (PA?) / FFM. Ickes (PA)  b.    FMF. Averill (IL) / FMM. Cole (OH &amp; IL) c.    MFF. Van Duesen / MFM. Pomeroy d.    MMF. Allen / MMM. Miller   Generation 5 (Great Great Grand Parents) (8 Families)  a.    FFFF. Unknown / FFFM. Unknown   b.    FFMF. Ickes (PA) / FFMM. Slick or Sleek (PA)   c.    FMFF. Averill (VT or NH) / FMFM. Standish (England)  d.    FMMF. Cole (OH &amp; NY) / FMMM. Frost e.    MFFF. Van Duesen / MFFM Jordan  f.    MFMF. Pomeroy (NY &amp; MI) / MFMM. Halcomb  (MA &amp; MI) g.    MMMF. Miller (PA) / MMMM. Kuntz or Koontz (PA)?  h.    MMFF. Allen (PA) / MMFM. Plaugh (PA)    **Known to have had another spouse that had at least one child.     This post is meant to both share information of what I am doing, but also seek a specific answer(s)/suggestion to increase information communication efficiency. This is not meant to be a discussion post, please include a personal example or a revised version of the above in your response.   Update: 03/06/15 - As mentioned by Jan Murphy below, I acknowledge if you can communicate a horizontal grid display this is a good option but it is not something that you can get by most websites text based message systems, as well as run into a few other minor constraints.  Though I thought about it, and if you build a grid template and copy and paste it into most email clients it will send it as HTML. This is a great email first contact, but doesn't overcome the text messaging system of Ancestry. I did do some testing and for narrow columns you can get a very slimmed down up couple of generations (&lt;4) through Ancestry.com but the display of it does get messed up a bit. (unless I am missing something) so that puts focuses back on text. "
195,Can we estimate the distribution of last names in 19th century Rhode Island?,"I am researching the histories of a number of Rhode Island families. It would be very useful for me if I had historical data on the distribution of last names in Rhode Island at any point before the Civil War. I could then use this as a baseline to make comparisons against other distributions I've collected data on (e.g. ""the Aldrich family is overrepresented in charitable organizations relative to their actual numbers in the population"").  Is there anywhere I could get such data? Or even just a raw list of the last names of everyone interviewed in the old Censuses?   Any sort of lead would be enormously helpful. If you know of something like this for another state, I'd still be interested. "
196,Rule of Thumb for when Anglo-American surnames became standardized?,"There are good Q&amp;A's on this site about how to identify alternative versions of a given surname, but I have a different question more related to this and this.  I know that when I'm looking at 18th century records, ""William Allen"" may very well be the same person as ""William Allyn."" But the further we get into the 19th century, I feel like this is less likely, and ""Allyn"" may represent a different family (or branch of the family) than ""Allen.""  I am working on a project where identifying potential kinship ties is important. I realize that best practice in any individual case is to find primary documents, which can confirm whether William Allen is actually the Wiliam Allyn who is related to Zachariah Allyn, etc. But I am working with several thousand records, and it won't be practical for me to do this for every case.  So: Do genealogists have any rule of thumb for when Anglo-American surnames became standardized in official records, such that alternate versions of a surname likely indicate a lack of close kinship? When did alternate surnames become signal rather than noise?   (It's worth noting that at the moment, I am looking at families in New England, not on the frontier. I'd imagine standardization hit Providence, RI before it hit the Great Plains. I am also only looking at established English families. I'm aware that non-English immigrant names were not standardized in the 19th century.) "
197,Finding details of recent Will in California?,I want to be sure if I am or am not included in the will of my relative who died in California in 2000.   What kind of lawyer I should refer to investigate. Can a lawyer give idea about cost to look in old will?   How can I investigate if I have inherited any real estate from my relative fourteen years ago? 
198,"What do index numbers mean in Rhode Island Register of Marriages, Births, and Deaths?","I've been unable to figure out what these index numbers in the leftmost column of Rhode Island Marriage, Births, and Deaths registers indicate. The image below is from the first page of the Births/Deaths section, so you can see that there are no headings. I've also looked through the front and back of the book and see no guide to interpretation.  I can tell that these numbers are associated with married couples. For example, 1-50 applies to all children of John and Susannah, and to Susannah herself. After Susannah dies, John marries Elizabeth. All of their offspring are now indicated with 1-51.  However, I have no idea what the referent of these numbers is. Why does that first family have a 3-XXX index? Why does the family underneath 1-51 suddenly jump up to 1-155?   I have no idea how hard it is to answer this question, or whether Rhode Island is idiosyncratic in this regard. I am more than happy to provide whatever additional information might help.   "
199,"How to interpret a reasonable X DNA Match, but no shared cM Autosomal result on GEDMatch?","I recently uploaded one of the Autosomal DNA results I manage to GEDMatch.com and ran the X-Match routine and came up with a puzzling result.   The strongest result by far on the test has 37.2 shared X cMs length (as pictured below) but GEDMatch is reporting 0.00 Autosomal shared cMs with the same individual. My understanding is your total cMs are the combination of Total X and Autosomal cMs even though not X-cMs are not included in the total in all sites.    Both kits being compared are Male, though the two others with 0cMs on Autosomal are female.  X-DNA Result Only from GEDmatch.com   Note: Kit numbers have been excluded intentionally.  The key to reading the above graphic is here:   I emailed the person to confirm they uploaded their autosomal results also as well as try to determine if there is an immediately obvious shared ancestor, but have not heard back.   They have an ""A"" kit which implies they tested on Ancestry.com, which is contained as a single file and uploaded as a single file to GEDMatch, unlike ftDNA which is uploaded as X and Autosomal files. So I would think incomplete data is not the case.  I also read the Working with Autosomal Results question which in the answer stated ""One other minor point of leverage in your situation: If you have a significantly-sized match on your X chromosome, that allows you to exclude your paternal grandfather's side (whether or not your half-sister matches). That is just a result of the normal rule of the X never going from father to son."" which is what I was trying to determine which side an autosomal result was from when I came across this situation.  I also read ISOGG's articles on both how Autosomal scores are calculated (it is different between each site where GEDMatch allows you to score them the same way, such as ftDNA does not include X shared cMs in score) and working with X-Results but it is still not clear as how to interpret this situation.   I have also tried adjusting the minimum cM length all the way down to 4 and still nothing when doing a 1:1 with this kit on the Autosomal test. I have also looked at their ""list"" of matches and they have Autosomal matches with shared cMs but none on the kit I am comparing it to?  Has anyone experienced similar results and is there something else I am missing in its interpretation? "
200,How to connect digitized images to a map?,"This is similar to the earlier question How to index your own digitalized records? but with a twist.  One of my places of interest uses a lot and block survey system and has maps available for download from the city assessor's office (from their GIS system).  These are PDF maps with the block and lot numbers, and often with the footprint of the buildings shown as an outline on the map.  Property Record Cards associated with each tax parcel often note the approximate date of construction of the building on the parcel.  Via Michael John Neill's blog, I discovered that the microfilm of the US Federal Census from 1790-1930 can be downloaded from the Internet Archive for personal viewing on your own computer.   I would like to take an enumeration district and map the parcels on the property tax map against the heads of household on the census).  My goal is to gain a better understanding of the neighborhood, and to locate some people known to have residences in the neighborhood who cannot be found by searching the index by name.    Do tools exist which would allow me to hyperlink the digital images to the PDF documents, or to leave 'sticky notes' on the census that would indicate I had located the street address on the map?  For a one-place study, I might also want to add in City Directory images or other source material which included a street address.  I have tried making spreadsheets and tables to keep track of data sorted by street address, but once I included material from different years, it was too messy to follow.  My ideal application would consist of a layered series of maps, with a different layer for each decade, or for each five-year period in states whose state censuses were taken in years ending in 5.    (For more information on using property records from the USA in your research, and images of maps which are similar to the PDFs I have downloaded, see the series of blog posts by James Tanner, including Understanding Real Property Legal Descriptions for Genealogy: Subdivision Survey, which inspired this question.)

201,Finding 1832 birth details in Romania for Wolf Finkelstein?,Wolf Finkelstein was my great-great grandfather.  He was born in Romania in 1832 which was before that country came into existence.  I don't know how to find out anything about him such as who his parents were.? How could I determine a more precise location and date for his birth?  I think he was born in a town called Jassy which I have also seen spelled Iasi. 
202,Finding a birth record for Samuel McReynolds?,"I can't find a birth record for an ancestor of mine, Samuel McReynolds (1847-1905).   The reason I am trying to find this is that I have no idea who his parents are and I am hoping to find that out.  There is more information in the related question Finding a marriage record for Samuel McReynolds?  I have a death record for Samuel McReynolds (with no parents listed) in which it states that he was born in Saline,Missouri on 13 December 1847, he died November 13 1905 in California.  I know this is the correct death record as his wife is listed.  He doesn't show up in Saline, Missouri on the 1850 Census though.  There are 2 other Samuel McReynolds born in Missouri around the same time and I have concluded that Samuel's parents ARE NOT John McReynolds and Lucinda Meadows or Allen McReynolds and Martha Cooper.  Any suggestions? "
203,Interpreting relationships to head of household in 1855 New York State Census?,"As I delve deeper into the records of my Sillars/Sellars/Sellers ancestors in Albany, New York, USA,  I am developing a much better picture of their lives there but numerous questions remain.  Here I would like to ask if anyone can provide an alternative interpretation to mine related to the household of Hugh Sellars in the 1855 New York State Census (Residence: Albany City, Ward 6, Albany, New York, USA, Line Number: 12, Sheet Number: 1).    The family members in the household with my comments are:   Hugh Sellars, 52, Ship Carpenter, from Scotland, living in Albany for 3 years Mary Sellars, 50, Wife, from England, living in Albany for 3 years - I am now convinced that this is not Mary Ann Risk because she married another Hugh Sellars on 15 Jul 1853 at Glasgow and they were both born in Renfrewshire, Scotland in about 1830 and have been traced through 3-4 censuses each - the 1865 New York Census records that both Mary and Hugh had been married twice Harriet Martin, 32, sister-in-law, from England, living in Albany for 3 years - would this be more likely a sister-in-law to Hugh or Mary?  There is a Harriett Foster, 44, from England, and 3 yo Caroline Foster, born in New York, living with Hugh and Mary for the 1860 Census so perhaps Harriet Martin married Foster in between. Moody M. Hale, 54, son-in-law, Skipper, from U.S., native voter and owner of land - would this be more likely a son-in-law to Hugh or Mary?  I think his age makes both unlikely. The identity of Moody M. Hale seems to be Moody March Hall from Cornish, New Hampshire and is described in this answer to Finding where US citizen owned land and/or was registered to vote in 1855? Elizabeth A. Hale, 18, daughter, from England, living in Albany for 3 years - would this be more likely a daughter to Hugh or Mary or Moody?  The name and age makes me think she is Moody's daughter.  She seems too young to be Moody's wife and in the 1860 Federal Census for Albany I find Hugh Sellers, 25, Seaman, from Scotland, living with Elizabeth Sellers from England, and son William Hale, 3, born in New York so it seems like Elizabeth may have had an illegitimate child and then married Hugh, son of the first Hugh. Then in the 1865 New York Census I find Hugh and Mary Sellers both 60 with their ""son"" William H. Hall who I think must be their grandson.   In isolation I think the above 1855 census record is very hard to interpret so I am trying to place it in context with Albany census records for:   Hugh (senior) and Mary in 1860 and 1865 - I have not yet found them in the 1870 census but a directory says that Hugh was at 311 Washington avenue, Albany Hugh (junior) and Elizabeth in 1860 Robert and Margaret in 1855 - Robert is another son who was living in the same Albany ward as Hugh (senior) that I am still looking for in the 1860 census when I think he may have been in New York City.  A candidate record has been discounted in Seeking image from New York 1860 Federal Census Index?   My question here is probably best summed up as ...  Is there a more likely interpretation of the family relationships of the 1855 household than the hypothesis that I am formulating above?    These Q&amp;As may provide additional background:   Finding evidence for divorce of Hugh Sillars and Agnes Macculloch in mid-19th Century Scotland? Finding Naturalization Record for Hugh Sellars from Scotland who lived in Albany (New York State) 1855-1872? Finding New York City/State records relating to Sellars family (British subjects) births/deaths mid 19th century? What churches in/near Ward 6, Albany, New York State might have baptized Scottish baby in 1854?  "
204,What was occupation of Skipper in 1855 New York State Census?,"In the 1855 New York State Census the household (Residence: Albany City, Ward 6, Albany, New York, USA, Line Number: 12, Sheet Number: 1) of my 4th great grandfather Hugh Sellars, a Ship Carpenter, included Moody M. Hale, 54, son-in-law, Skipper, from U.S., native voter and owner of land.    I have been assuming that a Skipper was something like a Sea Captain but I am now wondering whether it may have an alternative meaning.  I have found that on 19 Jun 1845 a Moody M. Hall arrived in New York from London aboard the Prinz Albert and, although the image is hard to read, it appears to say that he was a 48 yo Farmer from New Hampshire.  Assuming that this is the same person, being a Farmer might tie in with him being reported as an owner of land in the 1855 New York State Census.  Does anyone know what an occupation of Skipper in the 1855 New York State Census might mean?    The identity of Moody M. Hale as Moody March Hall from Cornish, New Hampshire now appears likely and is described in this answer to Finding where US citizen owned land and/or was registered to vote in 1855? "
205,Finding where US citizen owned land and/or was registered to vote in 1855?,"As a spin off from my question What was occupation of Skipper in 1855 New York State Census?, I know (or at least it appears) that Moody M. Hale (or Hall?) was a U.S. land owner and voter in 1855 living in Albany, New York.  With him living in the household of Hugh Sellars rather than his own I am assuming that his land may have been anywhere in the U.S.  On 19 Jun 1845 a Moody M. Hall arrived in New York from London aboard the Prinz Albert and, although the image is hard to read, it appears to say that he was a 48 yo Farmer from New Hampshire, so if this is him perhaps New Hampshire is where I should start looking for his land.  Are there any indexes to US Voters and/or Land Owners in 1855 (or at least that era) that can be used as a shortcut to finding where Moody M. Hale/Hall owned land and/or was registered to vote? "
206,Where was Joseph Brown Lever for 1841 England Census?,"In a self-deleted answer to Tracing Hitchcox migration Liverpool-Adelaide in 1854 on ships Constance and Antelope? user @GinnyButler mentioned that:     On the 1841 census we find Joseph Brown Lever is working for Joseph   Ansell in his shop. His mother Letitia Lever is staying there too.   Presumably as a visitor.   Joseph Brown Lever later married my 2nd great grand aunt Alithea Hitchcox but I have not been able to locate him in the 1841 (or 1861) England Census.  Perhaps Joseph Ansell is her uncle Joseph Anslow or her great uncle of the same name.  Searching for Letitia Lever and Joseph Ansell has not helped me find the 1841 record either.  The information above suggests that the 1841 record has been found and it is one that I would like to review because I am curious about how Alithea from Wheaton Aston near Lapley, Staffordshire came to marry Joseph Lever Brown from Raunds, Northamptonshire.  Where was Joseph Brown Lever for the 1841 England Census? "
207,"Where is/was location of Balintuger, Fife, Scotland?","My 4th great grandmother Elizabeth Doig was born/baptised on 16 May 1790 at Monimail, Fife, Scotland and she married John Moore on 30 Nov 1817 at Cupar, Fife, Scotland.  Her parents were Robert Doig and Janet Irvine Urquart and together they had 10 children with Elizabeth being their fourth. The second and third children were born at nearby Dunbog, the rest at Monimail.  Her birthplace is recorded in the Scotland Census a number of times:   1841: ""Fife, Scotland ... abt 1801"" 1851: ""Monimail, fifeshire ... abt 1793"" 1861: ""Monimail, Fife ... abt 1791"" 1871: ""Balintuger, Fifeshire ... abt 1792""   It is the last of these that I wish to ask about because I have not been able to find the location recorded through Google or any other searches.  Where precisely is/was Balintuger?  I suspect that it must be near Monimail (and/or Dunbog).  Interestingly, ""Balintuger, Fifeshire"" is what is recorded by Ancestry.com whereas FindMyPast simply records ""Fife, Scotland"".  Unfortunately, I do not have an image of the record to examine.  Elizabeth died on 28 May 1878 at 25 Wilson's Place, Portobello, Edinburgh and her death certificate was witnessed by her son-in-law, James Stewart. She was also part of his household in 1871.  I am confident that I am dealing with the same person in all four census records. "
208,Seeking Birth Certificate for Emilie Yznaga in New York City around 1859-1864?,"Does anyone have records of Birth Certificates for births in New York, NY between the years of 1855 and 1864?    If so, would it be possible to locate a birth certificate for a relative named Emilie Yznaga?    She passed on 01 Nov 1944 and the certificate shows her birth year as 1859.    However, her passport applications show 1864 which is a bit of a difference. "

210,How long do results typically take for Ancestry DNA test?,"I ordered a family DNA test from Ancestry.com and sent it in for lab processing, they received it and the web page shows:     Test in Process: Lab processing began on 02/26/2015   It is now four days short of one month, is it typical that the lab processing should take so long, or should I be concerned that my tests may somehow have been corrupted?  What is the normal lab processing time and what might cause lab processing time to vary from that norm? "
211,Who built the SS Persia in Quebec in 1853?,"Like many other Australians with European heritage, I have several ancestors who spent more than 100 days on a ship travelling to Australia in the nineteenth century. There was ample time for births, deaths (and the occasional marriage); so some Australian family historians study those ships as others might towns in the old country.  My current focus for study is the ship Persia which left Plymouth (England) on 16 August 1861 and docked in Brisbane on 3 December. It delivered 438 people (including 4 born at sea) to the new colony of Queensland after losing 22 people on the voyage.  Much information about the vessel can be obtained by analysing the entries in the annual Lloyds Register of Shipping (now available through Google Books).    I am confident of the following.      The Persia was a fully rigged ship of 1684 tons, over 200 feet long and almost 40 foot abeam. She was built in 1853 in Quebec from local timbers (Tamarack, Oak, Elm and Spruce).      In 1856, her bottom was covered in tar and felt then sheathed with yellow metal (an alloy of copper, zinc and tin). However she retained the iron bolts used in the original construction. The sheathing was renewed in 1860. This work was associated with other ""minor repairs"" in each case. Persia was again repaired in 1863.        In 1856, the vessel was operated by Thomas &amp; Co out of London. By 1861, it was under the ownership of G Seymor but remained London registered. However, Persia continued to be subject to the inspection rules for British North American built vessels.   The major hole in my understanding is the name of the builder in Quebec and the identity of the yard in which the various repairs were made. Was the ship returned to the original builder for the refits?  The difficulty is that Persia was an extremely popular name for British ships in the period 1850-70. For most of that time there were at least four vessels of different sizes and rigging registered with Lloyds, all carrying the same name. For example, the vessel I am studying was NOT the Cunard steamship RMS Persia that held the blue riband for fastest trans-atlantic crossing.   I have seen an assertion that the builder in Quebec was George H. Parke (but have found no supporting evidence). Where should I look to find information on ship builders in Quebec in the 1850s?  "
212,Uncovering residents of cemetery when headstones are losing legibility?,"My relatives are in a cemetery where the gravestones are losing their readability. The hamlet office does not know who is buried in some of the graves anymore and they have asked our family for help. We only realized the extent of the deterioration of the cemetery after Grandma died and we realized that there are no oldtimers left in the town anymore to care for the graves (she was covered in weeds). My parents spent days mowing, hauling good soil, sowing grass, and replacing broken vases for the clan.  What steps can I take to track down the (now hidden) members of the cemetery? And are there any preservation techniques for headstones? "
213,How can I establish (and describe) my confidence that the child and adult are the same person?,"My two general questions are:   At what point can one say that, yes, the adult you have identified as your ancestor is the same person as the child you think might be your ancestor, and that you have therefore identified that person’s parents? What are some good strategies for recording your degree of confidence (or lack of confidence) in that identification, and therefore in the link back to the previous generation?   The specific case that inspired the question is the following:   I can show that my great-great-great grandmother was Elizabeth Butcher, who married James Vallins in Swanscombe, Kent, England on 8 December 1827 (familysearch.org reference). I can show that there was an Elizabeth Butcher born to John Butcher and Artilian (Jackson) Butcher and christened  in October 1803 in Swanscombe, Kent. This is around the right time for it to be the same person, based on later Census and death records indicating Elizabeth's age. (familysearch.org reference) People didn't move much, so they are likely to have stayed in this village or the next one (I have several generations of other branches of this family that stayed in Swanscombe or neighbouring Greenhithe their whole lives; we're talking about farm laborers with no means to move elsewhere). According to FreeBMD, Artilian (or Artillion) died in the Deptford district of Kent in 1850, which includes Swanscombe. I have other christening records of other children of John and Artilian also from Swanscombe, dated after Elizabeth would have been born, so the family stayed there. But I don't have any direct evidence that they are the same person (e.g. witnesses to the marriage including her parents or brother, or a death certificate with parents' names included), and I can't prove that there wasn't another Elizabeth Butcher born in that village around the same time (although I can't find one), or that this wasn't a case where the local lad married someone from two villages over. After all, John and Artilian were married in Horton Kirby, seven miles away.    Is this enough to say that this is the right Elizabeth Butcher, and if not, how should I represent this uncertainty? Is it enough to notate my record for Elizabeth with a comment? "
214,"Did Carl M. Olson of Göteburg (Sweden) take 19th century photos in England, and if so, approximately when?","I have a photograph of an ancestor from England who I believe was born in 1818 (in Somerset) but became a police constable and lived in Devon, Gloucestershire and London later in life.  I am guessing that the photo was taken in about 1880.  On the front the photographer's name is ""Carl M. Olson Göteburg"" and on the back it says ""Carl M. Olson Fotograf, Göteborg. Rangströmsliden. Plåten Förvaras För Efterbeställning.""  Does anyone know whether Carl M. Olson travelled to England to take photographs or whether it is more likely that my ancestor travelled to Sweden?    Also, does the wording allow anyone to place a date range on the photo? "
215,"When/why did the BCG abandon ""preponderance of the evidence"" (POE)?

216,How do I Keep my Public Tree right sized to meet my own high quality standards?,"One of the reasons my Ancestry.com tree is public is so that I can make connections to “cousins” I don’t know.

For instance, should I stop with second cousin 1x removed, 1st cousin 2x removed, etc.?  My concerns with have a very large tree:   -it will be meaningless to my descendants -I won’t have time to research and source it correctly -I still have so many gaps in my direct ancestors -It can get expensive quickly to obtain records such as birth, marriage and death – yet I want my information to be as accurate as possible  "

She was born in ca1899 in Missouri. They married sometime between 1917 and 1940. I know this because he is listed on his WW1 draft registration card (1917) as single and on the 1940 census I linked to as married.  I've searched Family Search with the terms, but I can't find anything more. I was hoping to find this on a birth certificate or a marriage certificate, but I have found neither.

220,Understanding DNA ethnicity result?,"I have been trying to understand a DNA result and have been reading lots of info and asking questions of Ancestry.com. Still not finding an explaination that will help me move forward. I apologize if it is obvious, but just need a simple answer. Here is the scenario:  I received my DNA and it is laid out like this:  46% Italy- (which is right on the money, to the actual region, my mothers parents)  42% France-     This is where I am confused. My father and the bulk of all his relatives come from Germany. Going back to the 1700's.   How far back can that 42% French have been inherited from. I keep seeing that DNA is inherited from 50%, from that 50%, and again and again.   How do I have such a large percentage French?   Is there a relative that I need to search for within the last say, 100years, or can it go back further than that? "
221,Making family chart with everyone in it?,"I'd like to make a chart of every family member I know of, similar to Charting all cousins, all aunts, all uncles to degree (all living family in all lines to degree)?   I don't want a pedigree showing all ancestors (like Displaying exponentially growing family tree in practical way?) but a chart including every niece, in-law, and grand-uncle I know of. I have a GEDCOM file with 140 people in it so far.  I made a ""Family Lines Graph"" using Gramps.  (1) Is there an efficient way to include everyone as People of Interest? Like a ""select all"" function?  (2) Are there other programs that can prepare similar charts? I think the Gramps chart isn't very pretty, and it would be great if I could, e.g., make the vertical position of family members correspond to their date of birth or marriage, or if I could emphasize some people by making their pictures bigger.

222,Unknown 1st cousin match who shares matches with both grandparents,"I received notice of the following DNA match through Ancestry:     1,193 cM shared across 46 DNA segments, predicted relationship first   cousin, extremely high.   The next closest match is my nephew (1,562 cM across 58 segments) so this other match is pretty close.  I have only one known first cousin, as my mother (86) had one sister (79) who had one son (44). The age of this match is 31; I am 62.  He and I share matches from BOTH my maternal grandmother and maternal grandfather's side. This all screams ""FAMILY SECRET""!     Based on the amount of our shared DNA, is this match more likely the product of an unknown third child of my grandparents, born between my mother and my aunt, perhaps put up for adoption?  Age-wise, this match could be that offspring's grandson, my 1C1R. Or, a child born out of wedlock to my aunt (possible, but I think I would have heard about) and this would be her grandson, also my 1C1R?  Which makes most sense with the numbers, or are both possible?    I now have my nephew's (brother's son) shared DNA with this match is 751 cM. My daughter's is 560 cM. What does that tell us? "
223,Second cousins or double second cousins?,My parents share a set of first cousins but don’t share any common ancestors. I then share four great grandparents with my second cousins. Would they be considered my second cousins or double second cousins? Am I related to them to the same degree as my first cousins?  Here’s a little more detail: My maternal grandmother's sister married my paternal grandmother's brother. Their children are both of my parents' first cousins on each of their mother's sides. So I’m related to this set of second cousins through both of my grandmothers. What would they be considered?  
224,Which type of DNA test could help spot ancestry from father's great-grandmother?,"My father and his sisters have claimed that their great-grandmother was of a different race from the rest of my family. I've tried 23andMe, and I didn't see any interesting results at 3% of my ancestry composition. If I tried AncestryDNA or Family Tree DNA could I potentially find different results? Since this is a female ancestor of a male ancestor, only autosomal testing can be used to try to locate ancestry from this ancestor, correct? "

228,Brother/sister have fully identical segment -- match only matches one of them on that segment,"Using David Pike's tool:  [website]I found that my mother and her brother are fully identical on the portion of chromosome(s) 4 from position 122.2 million to position 175.9 million.  Both of them tested at FTDNA.  I uploaded both kits to MyHeritage, and today I noticed that a man matches my uncle from position 139.6 million to 150.9 million.  However, this man does not appear as a match to my mother.    How can this be possible?  Being a fully identical region, my mom and uncle should have the exact same sequence of pairs of nucleotides all through this segment.  Even if this man is a false match to one of them, say with the matching alleles bouncing back and forth between the maternal and paternal chromosomes, he should show as a false match to both of them.    All I can think is that David Pike's tool reported that there were two non-matching SNPs in the fully identical region that it assumed were in error and ignored.  But it goes against my impression of MyHeritage that they would have an algorithm that is a stickler for these differences.  If they are willing on one hand to impute data that isn't even there, presumably to show their customers more matches than their competition would, given the same user database, then would they counteract this effect with the other hand by having a very low tolerance for SNP read errors?  But can there be another explanation?  I can't think of one.  (My Uncle and Mother match at MyHeritage as they should, so it's not a matter of uploading the wrong kit or something.) "
229,Finding information about employment at Remington c. 1917,"My great-great grandfather Richard M. Dugdale was a machinist and engineer. During World War One, he was employed by the Remington Arms Company in Ilion, NY. I believe he started working there in late 1915 or early 1916 and he left before 1920 to work at Farrington Manufacturing in Massachusetts.  My understanding is that he was in middle to upper management at Remington. I have a newspaper article from the Utica (NY) Herald Dispatch from March 26, 1917 that reads:     R. M. Dugdale, supervisor of Departments 66 and 67, was presented a diamond stick pin by Donald Wright in behalf of the men employed under Mr. Dugdale. The recipient of the gift responded in an appropriate manner.   Family legend has it that R.M. was involved in the design of a pistol while at Remington, which, based on the timing, must be the Model 51 (or possibly the prototype Model 53). However, his name is not listed on any of the patents for that gun and I have not found any patents for him from before 1920. After leaving Remington, however, he did receive 24 different patents while at Farrington, including those for the Charga-Plate (early mechanical credit card, basically), so he definitely was capable of being involved in design.  How can I track down more information about what his employment entailed? What did departments 66 and 67 do at Remington?   Regular Google searches have turned up nothing. I tried contacting Remington directly but I never heard back. I also posted a similar question on the Remington Society forum (question here: [website]"

231,Can my DNA results be wrong?,"I am a female, who was adopted at birth.    I had been searching for my birthmother and found her through a 2nd cousin match on Ancestry, but she passed away in 2010.  I was able to locate her brother, who was there for my birth.  None of her family knew who my birth father was.    I finally got a 1st cousin match, in May of this year.  He didn't match with any of my bio mom's family, so I figured he had to be on my birth father's side.  I messaged my 1st cousin, who is male.  My 1st cousin told me his father, only had one brother, so we thought it had to be him.  I sent him a letter in June and two weeks later, he called me.  He said that he was dating his, now, wife, at the time, and she did not know about his affair.  He said he remembered having a one night stand with my birth mother, the exact time-frame I would have been conceived.    He told his wife, who was less than thrilled, but is okay now, and his two grown children, and all was well.  We were convinced, I was his daughter.  We have been talking weekly, and have been forming a really close relationship.  He decided to schedule a visit to come meet me in person, but before he came, I told him I'd like do a DNA test with him through Ancestry, just to make 100% sure, so I had it sent to him and he sent his test to Ancestry.    Since we were almost certain I was his daughter, (although it was against my better judgement. He was so anxious to meet me,) our visit was this weekend, even though the test results weren't in yet.  We thought we had another 1-3 weeks before the results were in.  Last night, as I was about to take him back to the hotel, I was going to read my exchange with his nephew, my 1st cousin match, back when I first discovered our initial match on Ancestry.    I had a notification that I had a new DNA match.  HE was the new match.  I started reading the results, but it says ""Close Family"" match, not ""Parent"" match.  I finally read them out loud to him and my husband.  As I read the results to him, we all became heartbroken and crushed.    How could this be?    I am absolutely baffled!!!  It's showing he and I share 1,762 centimorgans shared across 48 DNA segments.  Is he really my Uncle?  My 1st cousin match, who is his nephew, is showing we share 1205 centimorgans shared across 40 DNA segments.  My first cousin match and I put our raw DNA on GEDmatch, and it shows 1.8 generation.  There are NO other brothers.  Also, who I thought was my birth father, remembers being with my birth mother, around the time of my conception.    Could the test be wrong?    I am so upset. "
232,Creating GEDCOM diff of all people in one GEDCOM but not another?,"How can I create a GEDCOM diff of all people in one GEDCOM but not the other.?  I have just got wikitree up to date with one branch of my ancestry tree much that I originally imported into wikitree a year previously, this entailed uploading a GEDOM of 1200 people and checking each one against suggested matches, updating info and then adding the 150 or so people that were not in wikitree.  Now I will continue working in Ancestry.com trying to find more people. At some point I will then do another gedcom export but I don't want to recheck the 1200 people I have already checked as this will take a lot of time for little gain.  I intend to compare the original gedcom file with the new gedcom file to find all the people in file 2 that were not in file 1 and then create a new file just comprising those people that I can then upload into wikitree.  I realize Gedcom files are textual files but just using a regular file diff will not create a gedcom file that I can use, so is there a way to construct a valid 3rd gedcom file.   The Gedcom is actually created by Family Tree Maker after syncing from Ancestry and it does seem to preserve an id when exporting the same person to a different Gedcom so it seems it would be quite easy to check ids and create the required Gedcom.  Is there a tool available that can do such a thing?    I am looking for a tool that will create a new Gedcom tree containing users in tree 2 but not in tree 1. I'm not looking for a GUI tool that lets me navigate two trees and compare their data, which is what Which tools are available for GEDCOM comparison? is about. "
233,Doing neighborhood or street address research in England?,"In the related question Starting pre-1837 research in England and Wales? I have residence information for George Hindley and Hannah Drake from their civil marriage certificate and a census enumeration, both from 1841.  As a next step, I would like to do neighborhood research, such as the approach in this article from the US National Archives' Prologue Magazine:  Discovering Your Neighborhood: How to Use National Archives Records to Find Out More about Where You Live by M. Marie Maxwell.  In the US, for larger cities, NARA holds the enumeration district maps from the Census Bureau, and we have Sanborn Fire Insurance Maps.     For England, is the preferred choice the historical Ordnance Survey maps at National Library of Scotland -- or something else?    TNA's guide for How to Find Census Records says:     For 1871 census registration district maps see Cassinimaps.co.uk   but doesn't talk about maps for other years.  TNA also cautions:     House numbers were rarely given in earlier census years, and in rural   areas you will often find only the name of the village or hamlet.   However, I don't need to search the census by street address. What I'm looking for are ideas to use the information I already have as pointers to other records.   I am also aware of the Historical Directory collection at University of Leicester (and other UK directories elsewhere), but they don't always have the same fine details that you can find in directories in the USA.    What other record collections and what strategies might be useful for surveying an entire neighborhood? "
234,Understanding matching for Shared Ancestor Hints in AncestryDNA?,"This may be related to Why might number of Shared Ancestor Hints go down on AncestryDNA? but I think it is a more specific question, and so, at least for now, I do not think that it should be considered a duplicate.  On Ancestry.com when I click the DNA link at the top I am currently told that I have 25 Shared Ancestor Hints and 130 4th cousins or closer.  Amongst my 4th cousins or closer is an individual X with whom I have 36 centimorgans shared across 3 DNA segments.  X is not amongst my Shared Ancestor Hints, and I am trying to determine the reason for that.   Both X and I have public trees with around 2,000 or more people in them. X has an ancestor named Jane Harvey:   B: 6 Dec 1759 in , Devon, , England D: 14 Sep 1824 in Totnes, Devon, England  I have an ancestor named Jane Harvey:   B: Bef 6 Jun 1759 in Totnes, Devon, England D: 14 Sep 1824 in Totnes, Devon, England  X has an ancestor named James Murch:   B: 5 Aug 1757 in Totnes, Devon, England D: 1810 in Totnes, Devon, England  I have an ancestor named James (II) Murch:   B: 05 Aug 1757 in Totnes, Devon, England D: 31 Dec 1810 in Totnes, Devon, England    Is the way that I have named James Murch as James (II) Murch (whose older brother James died a week after being baptised) the likely reason for X not showing up in my Shared Ancestor Hints or is it something about the dates and locations of the events listed that may be preventing it? "
235,Differences in Half-Sibling Matches,"This is a follow up to Probability of Specific Relationship from AncestryDNA?    I have an Ancestry match with two half-sisters (same mother, different fathers).  The older one by 16 years matches me at 684 CMs and the younger at 461 CMs.    Using the DNADetectives chart, these suggest two possibly different relationships with me although there is a very narrow overlap.    How could two sisters with a common mother, match to me with such a gap in CMs? "
236,"What locality was meant by Trbontle, Yugoslavia?","I have the notes taken on behalf of an illiterate coal miner immigrant for his affidavit for naturalization in 1936.  In there it is written:    which reads:     I am married, wife's name is Theresa Gregorcic. We were married Sept. 26, 1897 at Trbontle, Juga Slovia.  She was born at Vel Cirnik, Austria.   Veliki Cirnik is between city Celje and Novo Mesto. (See map here.)  The issue is that no one from that area knows of any place named Trbontle.  Closest guesses so far are Trbovlje or Trebnje.  Trbovlje is not so far north from Veliki Cirnik, there is also a mine there.  Trebnje is a bit south west from Veliki Cirnik and does not appear to have mining.  The transcriber was probably not a native, but an American, so would Trbontle phonetically sound like either of those two cities as pronounced by a native of one of them?  What cities could he have meant so I can try and find church records for their marriage? "
237,What is the English equivalent to the German term “Spitzenahn”?,"In German, Spitzenahn (plural Spitzenahnen) describes an ancestor (male or female) without parents that are known to you. It is not necessarily a brick wall (or an orphan with never known parents), although it can be. It’s the current limit of your researched family branches.  What is the English equivalent to the German term “Spitzenahn”?  See also the question How do I create a list of my most distant ancestors online or with a Mac?. "
238,Finding personnel records for Railway Company in Panama around 1865?,"Margaret Elizabeth Sellers was born on 28 Jul 1865 at Tradeston, Glasgow.  On her birth certificate (which I have not sighted), the occupation of her father, Robert Sellers (my 3rd great grandfather), is stated as being ""Railway Company, Ship Building Manager, Panama, Central America"".  Was there only one Railway Company operating in Panama at that time?  i.e. the 1855 Panama Railroad.  If so, are its personnel records likely to have survived?  I have reviewed Obtaining personnel records about Panama Canal without going to Panama? but the Panama Canal Company to which that refers seems to belong to a later period (1904-1914).  On the Death Certificate of Robert's wife Margaret (nee Clacher) on 5 Nov 1867 at Tradeston, Glasgow, his occupation was given as ""Railway Company Ship Building Manager"" and this is the last record I am confident to attribute to him.  Our family story is that he and Margaret ""died building the Niagara Falls"" (which makes no sense) and I suspect (with no evidence) that Robert probably died in Panama soon after 1867 and by the 1871 Scotland Census their four children (aged 5-16) were living in Glasgow with Margaret's brother-in-law (John Lamont), sister (Elizabeth) and mother (Mary nee Campbell), which suggests that they had been orphaned.  Consequently, I think it is the Panama Railroad Company records from about 1855 to not long after 1870 that will be the most likely to hold mentions of him. "
239,"Finding 1870 Federal Census image that corresponds to street address in Albany City, New York, USA?","From Ancestry.com. U.S. City Directories, 1821-1989 [database on-line]. Provo, UT, USA: Ancestry.com Operations, Inc., 2011 I know that in 1870 my 4th great grandfather Hugh Sellars was living or at least running a variety store at 311 Washington Ave, Albany City, New York State, USA.    According to the same U.S. City Directories he had been there since at least 1864 and stayed there until at least 1872.  However, while I have found him in the 1865 New York State Census, I have not been able to locate him in the 1870 Federal Census.  Using my subscription to Ancestry.com, or any other means, is it possible to determine which image(s) from the 1870 Federal Census I should be trying to look at?  My problem seems to be the opposite of that in How to find address of building in New York State censuses (1870, St Lawrence, USA)? "
240,Where can I access annual reports of the registrar-general for England after 1920?,"The annual reports of the registrar-general relating to births, marriage, and deaths in England and Wales were published every year since civil registration began, and are available at the Histpop website up to 1920. However, there are no reports after that date. Does anyone know where or how one could access later reports, such as for the 1920s and 1930s?  I find these reports useful for a number of reasons, some of which are related to genealogy, as well as broader historical/epidemiological/health related interests. With relation to genealogy, it is interesting to examine trends of births and deaths in certain localities to put my ancestors in a better context. "
241,"Apprenticeship records for Ship Carpenters at Glasgow, Scotland in first half of 19th Century?","Two of my direct ancestors were Ship Carpenters:    my 4th great grandfather Hugh Sillars was first noted as such in the 1841 Scotland Census: Hugh Sillars 37 Agnes Sillars 30 Robert Sillars 9 Agnes Sillars 8 Hugh Sillars 6 Birth year: abt 1804 Gender: Male Where born: Scotland Civil Parish: Barony County: Lanarkshire Address: Slip Dock Occupation: S Carp J Parish Number: 622; and his son my 3rd great grandfather Robert Sellars was first noted as such in the 1855 New York State Census: Name: Robert Sellers Birth Year: abt 1831 Age:   24 Gender:  Male Relation to Head:  Head Of Household (Head) Residence: Albany City, Ward 6, Albany, New York, USA Household number:   2 Line Number:  36 Sheet Number:    11 Household Members:   Robert Sellers 24 Margaret Clacker 25 Hugh Sellers 5 Robert John Stephen Sellers   1   When he married Margaret Clacher on 1 Feb 1850 at Glasgow, Robert's occupation was given as Carpenter.

242,How to identify formal military photos?,"Is there a web site out there or some place to ask about the context of formal US military photos?  I would like to know the time, location, and reason of a photo.  For example, here are two photos that I know are US Army from WWII, but I don't even know if they were taken in the US or in Europe.  They were clearly officially staged, so there must have been a special event they are related to.  Is there someplace to look this up, ask, etc?      Incredibly, the names and home locations for most of the men are listed on the back.  Yes, even for the large group photo.  Added in response to comments  Yes, the two photos are connected.  I didn't get into the details of these particular photos because I was asking a general question about how to get more information on such things.  Of course I do want information on these photos, but thought it would be off topic here as being too localized or something.  Yes, some of these people may still be living, which is why I haven't mentioned any of the names.  My father (Thomas Greenleaf Lathrop) is in both photos, but he died in 1978 so I can't ask him.  He was in the signal corp during WWII, trained in Camp Kolher outside of Sacramento CA, got shipped to England, then into France and Germany.  These photos could be from Camp Kohler, England, France, Germany, or anywhere else he was stationed until being discharged in Berlin after the war ended. "
243,What are some of the main conventions used in Gramps?,"As I have started recording my family history using evidence based methods in Gramps I've noticed that it is very flexible (too flexible?). I worry that the method in which I record data might seem sensible at first but after running reports or exporting my data I will notice issues with my data that will require bulk editing because I wasn't using a Gramps convention. For example, I'm not sure if it is better to record the details of a marriage in an event or family object and how that will affect GEDCOM exporting.  What are some of the major conventions of entering data into Gramps and what resources are available to help me figure out how to store data in the most 'future-proof' way? "
244,Finding record of Peter J Starrs in USA prior to 1870 Census?,"I have hit a roadblock tracing the Starrs family in Ireland.  Peter J Starrs, born about 1836 in Ireland, immigrated to New York between then and 1860 (most likely in the 1850s).  I cannot find who his parents were, if he had any siblings, etc.  He married Mary Ann McDowell (1844-1880) who was also born in Ireland, but I do not know if they married in Ireland or the U.S. as I cannot find marriage records or immigration records on them.

Suppose a consume DNA testing service company, like 23andMe/Ancestry.com/FamilyTreeDNA, extracts two people's genetic information.   How will the company test the relative relationship of two individuals? Will they use some algorithms to detect the identity-by-descent (IBD) segments?

246,Where did the Vannoske's come from?,"The origin of the Vannoske family (FamilySearch, Ancestry) is the biggest brick wall I have left. Here's what I know:   The obituary of the oldest daughter, Mary Wojnowkski (Mrs Albert Zierak), says she was born in Pozen, Poland and came to the US at the age of 3 which would be around 1866. But it would likely be just after because the next child, Andrew, was also supposedly born in Poland Oct 1866. The next child, Katharine, was born in NY but that was 10 years later so it doesn't help pin down the date very much. Pozen could either be Posen the historical province of Prussia or Poznań the city though it's most likely the province. Most US records for the family use the surname Vannoske but their name was most likely Wojnowski in Poland. I have not been able to find immigration records nor naturalization records. I don't believe the father was naturalized and I was unable to find records for the one son that was born in Poland. I did not have any success searching the Poznan Marriage Project or BaSIA.   I don't know what to do next. I've hopped the pond two other times. Once was to Ukraine which was only possible due to somewhat miraculous circumstances. The other time, in Poland, I had the same mysterious family records with a village name and was lucky enough to find somebody who had been indexing records in that area so I could quickly do a match. But this time I'm not sure whether it's the city or province and I don't know about any records being available.  Are there any other records here in the US which might lend a clue? Are there records from Poland available which I could browse through? Will I likely have to pay someone in Poland to do this for me?  What else can I do? "
247,Citation of both folio and page in England census,"When citing census records for England and Wales (1841-1901), by convention we cite both the folio and page number. Since the page number simply clarifies which side of the folio to look on, why is this necessary or useful? Would it be better simply to cite the page using 'r' (recto) and 'v' (verso) to indicate which side of the folio, as this is consistent with the guidelines for Citing documents in The National Archives?  For example, RG 9/2480, f 70, p 11 would become RG 9/2480, f 70r.  ADDED: As it seems to be the consensus that the use of recto/verso is unclear or confusing, perhaps a better question is why is it necessary to cite the page at all? The folio alone is sufficient to locate a specific record, so why not leave the citation as, for example, RG 9/2480, f 70? "
248,What happens when a last will and testament enters probate?,"In a newspaper, I found mention of an ancestor's last will and testament:     Last will and testament of Ida O.

249,What's on the right-hand page of the 1939 Register?,"Looking at the images for the 1939 Register, FindMyPast only displays the left-hand page and the first column of the right-hand page:    I have heard that the right-hand page contains ""sensitive medical information"" or the like. However, I somehow doubt that one of the columns is specifically devoted to medical notes since it was not until long after the war that the registers became the basis for the NHS registers. And anyway, the original household schedules did not ask for any medical details, so there's no reason there would be a column for it in the register books.  So what exactly is being hidden from view? What are the missing columns? "
250,Finding who owned/managed Yorkshire Hall Plantation in Demerara (Guyana) in early 19th century?,"This question is related to an earlier one (Where to find Will of Giles Chichester from 1820s, probably in Somerset or Guyana?) and more generally to the time that three (possibly four) brothers of my direct ancestors Priscilla (3rd great grandmother) and Robert Chichester (4th great grandfather) spent in Demerara (now Guyana) during the early 19th century.  My current interest is in seeing whether researching Yorkshire Hall plantation might shed some light:   In 1825 William Chichester (Robert's brother) is recorded as being the Proprietor of Plantations Yorkshire Hall and Zealand in      DEMERARA AND ESSEQUIBO VADE-MECUM.  A. Stevenson, at the Guiana   Chronicle Office, 1825 - 311 pages.    William seems to have been associated with Plantation Zealand since at least 13 Aug 1808 when he was cited as a witness in a defamation dispute conducted in the local newspapers, and this mentions that his house is at Plantation Zealand ([website]William may have acquired Yorkshire Hall soon after the death of Mary Skelton because:      The West Yorkshire Archives Service office at Bradford Library holds   the will of Mary Skelton ""late of Little Horton"".

251,Twentieth-century emigration from Romania?,My Grandfather arrived in England round about 1910 and married my Grandmother in 1912.  His surname was Cancea and we believe his first name was Stanley. We have one family letter which looks like he came from Bucherest but would be interested to know how I go about finding more out about his family and why he left Romania?    I have also found out that my Grandma had to change her nationality from British to Romanian to marry my Grandfather in 1912. Why would this have been? 
252,How can I get a link to an Ancestry.com record that doesn't contain search data?,"When I find a record on Ancestry.com, the link contains data about the search I performed to find it, presumably so that Ancestry can provide a link to return to the search results. Here's an example:  [website]While that data may be useful to me in the future, it makes the URL enormous. Just pasting that thing into Chrome's address bar slows my computer down for a few seconds*. Also, people I might share the URL with don't need the extra data.   How can I get a URL to the record which doesn't contain the search data?  I know that I could just delete the extra search parameters, but that would require remembering which of the cryptic parameters are necessary.  Is there a ""permalink"" or ""direct link"" button on record pages? I don't see one, but that doesn't mean it's not there.  * I'm not sure why because it's only ~300 characters; perhaps it's something to do with autocomplete "
253,Breaking through brick wall with circumstantial evidence?,"Wondering if there are techniques to break through a brick wall with circumstantial evidence rather than hard evidence. Drawing a blank on my 3rd great grandfather in my paternal line. He lived in an area where there were many families with the same surname and a well established family tree going back to the first immigrant in 1660. I seem to be one generation away from being able to connect to this tree. Any tips/insight would be greatly appreciated. My 3rd great grandfather died early which seems to be causing problems.  Here's what I know:  My 3rd great grandfather's name is John Perry Emory or Perry Emory (b 1825 d 1860). He had three sons Arthur Wells Emory, Charles Ernest Emory and Ogle Tilghman Emory. They lived in Queen Annes County, Maryland. When I first started I knew my 2nd great grandfathers name was Arthur Emory. I soon found what I believe to be the family in the 1850 census and the fathers name was Perry and his occupation was a sailor which confirmed what my grandfather told me (he died at sea when the children were young). I later came across Arthur Wells Emory's obit and it confirmed that his father's name was John Perry Emory, but the name of Arthur's mother is different than the 1860 census. But, the census has to be correct, I think the obit made a mistake. The only other info I've been able to find on Perry Emory is: ""Pere Emory (which is apparently what he went by) married Sarah Downes May 26, 1851"" from a list of weddings in Queen Annes County.  In this link: [website]I wanted to post an update to this question. It's been quite a journey. I was able to find the parents of Pere Emory. Turns there was a chancery record stating the parents. Pere's father was Peregrine Emory who was from the family I suspected in my initial query. Peregrine Emory the father did inherit around 1000 acres of land, but had sold it all off by the time Pere Jr. was born. Along the way he went bankrupt and that seems to be the reason there weren't any probate records. The chancery record in addition to the FAN leave little doubt that Peregrine is the father.  Would be happy to post a mini case study if anybody is interested. "
254,How can I assess the statistical probability that an individual is the one I seek?,"I have an ancestor Caroline Ellen Brown (also mentioned in this question: How might a &quot;nurse-child&quot; have been placed with their carers?) for whom the marriage and birth records are elusive. The three documents I have found that document an age suggest a birth year of 1828/1829 (Feb 1871 death and burial aged 42 according to her husband) or 1825/1826 (April 1861 census aged 35 according to the staff at Guys Hospital). Her maiden name comes from the birth certificate of her second child Stanley in May 1861.  As she was born prior to 1837, the GRO birth indices are of no use in finding her birth. The 1861 census gives a place of birth of Middlesex, City of London but I'm not relying on this as the provider of the information was likely the institution rather than herself or somebody who knew her. Her marriage ought to be findable via the GRO indices, but I've no strong candidate yet.  Her first known child Agnes was born in Hitchin, Hertfordshire in 1859; and Ellen died and was buried in Cheshunt, Hertfordshire in 1871. Her husband was born in Kidderminster, Worcestershire; and the family lived also in Kent and London. After her death, her husband moved to Aston, Worcestershire, re-married and then moved to Lichfield in Staffordshire where he died in 1904. So there isn't even a strong geographical clue to where I should be looking.  In an ideal world, every parish register in England would be online and I could locate every candidate record for her birth (assuming she was baptised).  Unfortunately, we live in a less-than-ideal world...  But there is (for example) a Caroline Ellen Augusta Brown baptised in Sawbridgeworth, Hertfordshire on 20th May 1827 (according to findmypast.co.uk). Could be... but how likely?  Is there a technique I can apply (maybe based on name frequency in the approximate period of her birth &mdash; say 1820 - 1830) that will tell me how common her combination of names was? If it was very common, then finding this record means absolutely zilch, as there could be hundreds of similar records I can't see because they're not online yet. If, on the other hand, the combination is uncommon, this record warrants further investigation.  So, is there a possible statistical approach here? And if so, what datasets would it depend upon? "
255,Why wait more than 3 years to file the Petition for Naturalization?,"Naturalization in the US was a two step process from 1790 through at least the mid 1900s (I don't know how it works now). The first step was filing a Declaration of Intention which could be done after living in the US for two years. Three years after filing the declaration you could file a Petition for Naturalization. You became a citizen when the petition was granted.  I have found both the Declaration of Intention and Petition for Naturalization for three ancestors. Two of them waited significantly longer than three years to file their petition.   Joseph Basista waited three years: Declaration in 1923 and Petition in 1926. Joseph Yurkiewicz waited six years: Declaration in 1917 and Petition in 1923. Stephan Bazarnicki waited nine years: Declaration in 1894 and Petition in 1903.   Why would Joseph, and especially Stephan, wait so long to file their petitions? Was this normal? Were the advantages to being naturalized not big enough to feel an urgency? Were there conditions or exceptions that could delay their ability to file the petition? I don't mean conditions such as being stranded on an island but perhaps requirements that needed to be met in addition to living in the US for those three years. "
256,The vicar didn't record the baptised child's name! Now what?,"In my in-laws tree, there is an ancestor Robert Judson, son of James Judson who was baptised in Haworth, Yorkshire, 11 July 1736.  I haven't found an obvious candidate for James yet, but I did find a couple of unnamed sons of a Timothy Judson born in the late 1600s in Haworth. (in 1692 and 1698)  When I went to the original scans of the parish records, available on Ancestry.com, it shows that the names of the children were simply not recorded. In most (but not all) cases, it just says ""a son of"" or ""a daughter of"".  I think it might be reasonable to conclude that the 1698 one is our James Judson.   Other James Judsons born in Yorkshire in the plausible age range (here and here) seem to have died as children. Robert was baptised in Haworth, and so were his children, so I have no reason to believe they were a family from a long way away. The father's name Timothy is relatively rare in this period. Douglas Galbi's data set of given names in Northumberland for 1530-1830 contains nearly 40,000 males and their names and dates of birth, contains only 38 Timothys (i.e. 0.1%). I think this is a reasonable comparator set for Yorkshire in the late 17th and early 18th centuries. (This sort of analysis is easy to do in R or Mathematica, less so in Excel because of the size of the data set.) So the fact that James had a son Timothy, leads me to think it might have been a family name. (This sort of pattern is the reason I suggested in my answer to an earlier question that one can't assume that the distribution of first names is independent of the distribution of family names. There are a few other Timothys born to other Judsons later in the 18th century.)   So my questions are:   Are these sorts of no-name dead ends common? How do people handle them? Is this level of evidence considered sufficient for a tentative conclusion by more experienced researchers? I suspect I won't be able to find wills or other documents to triangulate my conclusion, as I believe these were farmworkers or similar without significant property to leave.  "
257,How can I access records from Morocco?,"My father was born in Fes, Morocco in 1936.  He left to go to Israel in the 1950's.  Does anyone know what type of records were kept in that time period or earlier?  Were any kept at all? I don't really know much about his parents and nothing of his grandparents.  I'm assuming the Moroccan records, if there were any, were in either French or Arabic.  How could I access these? "
258,Locating records of coronor's Inquests in Oxfordshire in 1909?,"I have a death certificate issued in Oxford (Oxfordshire, England) in 1909 that says the cause of death, decided by an inquest the next day, was by drowning (in the river).  Where would records of the evidence before the inquest be held?  Is this something that would be at the County records office, or are the details never released?  The local newspaper (Oxford Journal) for that year isn't available on the British Newspapers Archive yet. "

260,"What does the word ""née"" mean when following a woman's name?","For the first time today I have seen the word née following a woman's name. It's often in parenthesis and precedes what appears to be another surname. I'm guessing it's a way of signifying a woman's maiden name, but the notation is very foreign to me. What exactly does it mean? Why is it used to signify a woman's maiden name?  This obituary from 2009 is a good example where it's used twice: Loretta M. (née Kott) and Mary (née Gawlek) Kott. "
261,Finding the Fatherless Feathers,"How common is it to be unable to find baptismal records of a whole family in early 19th century England?  In one tree I am researching, there is a John Feather, who Census records locate in 1861 and 1871 in Manningham, near Bradford, with a birth date of 1836–7 and a birthplace of Heptonstall, Yorkshire. In both his marriage certificates, the spaces for father’s name and rank have a line drawn through, while the brides did provide this information. I infer that he was illegitimate, a common occurrence in Heptonstall’s parish records at the time, but I have been unable to find a birth or baptism record for him.   I have, however, found Census records for him in the 1841 and 1851 Censuses, the first in Todmorden, very close to Heptonstall, and the second in Manningham, as one would expect. The household in 1841 consisted of an older woman, Mally Thomas, and four young adults in their 20s in addition to the five-year-old John: Penelope Feather, Sarah Feather, James Feather and James Jackson. Penelope seems to have married a William Hitchen in 1843, while still living in Heptonstall, and died in 1848 in Manningham.  I infer that she, not Sarah, was John’s mother because the ages fit better and because he named his own eldest daughter Penelope. Nonetheless in the 1851 Census, it is the probable aunt Sarah who he is sharing a household with, again as lodgers with a family of Thomases, Richard and Mary (possibly the same Mally as before?). Unfortunately because they are lodgers, the Census doesn’t indicate the relationship between them.  Here is the weird thing.  There are a couple of families of Feathers in Heptonstall with baptisms in the late 1700s, including a Mally who could be the Mally Thomas mentioned previously. But I cannot find any baptismal records for John, Penelope or Sarah in Heptonstall. There aren't any Feather baptisms in the 1810–30 period in Heptonstall, and the few in nearby Luddenden do not include a Sarah or a Penelope. (At least not in FamilySearch or Ancestry.com that I can find.) and the only Heptonstall baptism of a John Feather in the right time range is one I already know died as an infant.  I can’t rule out that they were baptised elsewhere. Certainly there are a bunch of Feathers in Haworth, but no Penelope’s that I can find. I have no reason to think they were Non-Conformists.  What is the most reasonable hypothesis here?   None of these people were ever baptised, and I’m stuck. They were baptised, but the records aren’t in the usual databases because of transcription errors or legibility problems, and I need to start trawling through the West Yorkshire parish record scans on Ancestry.com page by page?

264,"Military draft in the Imperial German Army: What was the minimum age for being a ""Gefreiter"" in a reserve unit during WWI?","As detailed on Formationsgeschichte – Rekrutierung (agw14-18.de), the drafting system in the German empire was fairly complex.   According to this site there was a conscription of 2 years for most branches of service, starting at the age of 20. The draftee was part of the reserve for 7 years (2 years conscription + another 5 years), then he became part of the Landwehrpflicht.  I want to narrow down the birth year of someone who was fighting in 1915 in an infantry reserve unit (Reserve-Infanterie-Regiment Nr. 227) as a Gefreiter (= Lance Corporal).  Can I safely assume that this person completed his conscription before the war broke out in 1914 and was as a part of the reserve at least 22 years old, thus being born 1892 or earlier? Can I draw any assumptions on his age from his rank in 1915?  Thank you for sharing your experience. "
265,Determining what records are available in a particular locale?,"A common question that any researcher asks themselves is, ""What records are available?"" How can that question be easily answered for a particular locale and time period? I know that I could inspect the catalogs of the major websites with online collections, but what about records that aren't digitized or microfilmed but are sitting in a government archives or church?   I would love to get my hands on a marriage record for Elias Yurkiewicz and Jennie Zuk. FamilySearch has images of church records for the village where they were living when they got married (and microfilm), but they don't include marriage records for the relevant time period. How do I know if the marriage records exist anywhere else? In the most recent episode of Who Do You Think You Are, court records are searched to shed light on a likely divorce. If I ran into a similar situation, how would I know whether court records are available and where to find them? When I don't have any luck with the normal census and BMD records that are commonly available for some areas, I always wonder if any land or probate records exist. Digital State Archives seems like a great resource, but it's limited to state archives in the US. What about local US archives or non-US archives? Genealogy Bank has a vast collection of newspapers, but they're limited to the US and they don't have everything. How can I know if a local archive has copies of old newspapers for the place I'm interested in? fultonhistory.com has digitized many old newspapers from upstate New York. How can I know if some other obscure website covers a different town I'm interested in?   Each time the ""What records are available?"" question is asked, the process for finding an answer appears to be different. Does it have to be that way? Is there one generic process a researcher can follow to figure out what records are available for a particular place and time? "
266,Mary and Mally: were they used interchangeably in Yorkshire in the late 18th century?,"In my previous question on Finding the Fatherless Feathers, I made reference to a Mally Thomas with whom the Feather siblings seemed to be lodging in 1841, in Heptonstall, Yorkshire, England.  In 1851, Sarah Feather was still lodging with a Thomas family, this time a Richard and Mary Thomas, in Manningham, but the implied birth dates of Mary and Mally are similar, and both Richard and Mary were born in Heptonstall. If so, it is probably the Mary Feather and Richard Thomas who married in 1818 in Halifax parish, which includes Heptonstall.  I have found a burial record for a Mally Thomas in 1860 in Manningham, which would be consistent with Richard Thomas turning up as a widower in the 1861 Census (still living with Sarah, now recorded as his “daughter” rather than as a “lodger” as in 1851). That there was a family connection seems consistent with the fact that in 1871, Sarah was still living at the same address without Richard, as they both were in 1861. That would be strange if she was just a lodger.  If Mally was often recorded as Mary, and vice versa, then it seems reasonable to suppose that Mally Thomas in the 1841 Census was the Mally Fether mentioned in the birth record Adrian found and posted as an answer to my earlier question. The Feather siblings living with Mally Thomas in 1841 were therefore living with their since-married mother, and it therefore seems that most of the family moved to Manningham before 1849 (when Penelope died, in Manningham). It would also seem reasonable to hypothesise that Mary Thomas of 1851 was the Mally Thomas of 1841 and of the death record in 1860.  Even if Mally and Mary are not the same person, it seems reasonable to suppose that Sarah (and John) Feather were lodging with some sort of relatives in Manningham, given that Mary's maiden name probably was Feather.  So my question is, can I treat Mally = Mary in records for late 18th century / early 19th century Yorkshire, if I have reason to hypothesise that the records are referring to the same person? "
267,What sources exist for 15th century England?,"Rule #1 for genealogy in the early 21st century has to be “don’t trust information from trees you find online: verify first”. That said, I’ve actually had some quite good results from following back some online trees, and cross-checking for possible alternative candidates for some of the people. I was even able to trace one line from my in-laws’ tree back into the mid-1500s, to Leonard Kighley and Margaret Man of Rylstone.  But some of the trees I find on line that appear to connect to other parts of my in-laws’ tree go back all the way to the 1400s. For example, there are several public trees on Ancestry.com that go back to a Thomas Crudgington born 1425 in Shropshire, and may connect to the Mary Crudgington who married Richard Millichap in Stoke St Milborough, Shropshire, in 1732.  There were no consistent parish records back that far in England. So unless someone has gotten very lucky with wills or some sort of contemporary family history, I’m unsure where they get the information from initially. The information might be wrong, but it is surely not entirely made up? Assuming I can get step by step back from the 1700s to the beginning of extant parish records, how would I go about sourcing information about the earlier people? "
268,What is the standard method for recording married names?,"Suppose Mary A marries John B and then (after his death or divorce) she marries James C.   Rightly or wrongly my impression is that conventional practice in GEDCOM based programs is to record only Mary A as her name because her married names are ""obvious"". It is clear that this practice is creaking where Mary uses married names that are not ""traditional"" (where tradition is that of the English speaking world). Problems here include   Mary A becoming Mary A B and then Mary B C (where the family-name is still one word and the previous family-name migrates to become a given name); Mary becomes Mary A-B (a new compound family-name);   However, this conventional practice can give rise to issues even when Mary's names are traditional, as any diagram (or report) centred on her 2nd marriage only will show, unless adjusted, that Mary A marries James C, when the marriage certificate probably records Mary B marrying James C.  To help overcome this, whenever a woman marries twice, I give her a secondary / alias name of her first married name (Mary B here) and adjust my diagrams to show multiple personal names. Should I be recording all married names to remove any risk of incorrect assumptions?  So - what is the best practice (and / or society standards) for recording married names? And what should it be?   Note husbands changing their name and issues with children's names are out of scope of my question. Note also - I work within GEDCOM practice where (stupidly) no dates can be assigned to Names. "
269,Is it crass to record cause of death? What about for suicide?,"Most death records have a place where 'cause of death' is recorded. I have recently discovered that a number of my relatives committed suicide. It was always acknowledged that they died, but never spoken aloud how it happened. Now, interviewing older members of the family, I am discovering the truth. Even the newspaper articles of the time did not name the true cause of death - only something like ""...found dead at home,"" which could mean anything. So, is it crass to now record for future generations to see how someone died?  In some cases, this information is there if I link to the original source, but I also transcribe details into my genealogy software. Is this something that I should leave blank in my typed transcription, but (obviously) someone could find if they dug deep enough through my research and went to the original source? Or would that just create inconsistencies, since I find most causes of death rather interesting and do type them in. "
270,Which residence should be the preferred residence?,"For most of the people in my tree, I have multiple residence facts because they are in different places at different times during their life.    Entries may be something like: 1900 - Hill County, Texas 1910 - Corpus Christi, Nueces County, Texas 1920 - Alice, Jim Wells County, Texas 1930 - Waco, McLennan County Texas   Family Tree Maker software requires that one residence entry be the ""preferred"" entry.  Which one should I choose?  Does it make any difference?  I would like to be consistent. "
271,Who were the children of Jacob Fisher and Sarah Hodges?,"Page 27 of the Sharon, Massachusetts Vital Records show Jacob Fisher and his wife Sarah had a son Jacob born 30 Apr 1776:     Jacob, s. of Jacob and Sarah, Apr. 30, 1776   Page 94 of those records show a marriage record of Jacob Fisher to Sarah Hodges on 7 Oct 1773:     Fisher ... Jacob and Sarah Hodges Oct 7, 1773.   I am presuming they are the same as the parents in the previous record.  The reason I originally asked this question is that through the DNA testing, I found I shared common DNA with someone. We both have Fishers in our ancestry (my paternal grandmother). However we have not yet been able to connect the dots and so we are trying to extend our Fisher line to find common overlap. The reason for asking about the children is look for links with my shared-dna correspondent. Note if we can find a potential connection, the dna evidence may be collaborating, non-definitive, evidence.  I will ask in another question (and update this one with reference) about the parents of Jacob Sr. Similarly I'll ask in a separate question about whether the Jacob Jr in this link is the Jacob who sired my line. My ancestor (speculating the Jacob Jr above) was in Worcester, MA but there was alot of movement to Worcester in this period (Worcester being a major mustering point for Massachusetts during the  American Revolution) so speculating either Jacob Sr moved there with family or Jacob Jr moved there later.

272,"Difference between ""roomer"" and ""boarder"" in 1930 US census?","I encountered the following situation in a 1930 census of a household of a family I am researching: In addition to mother (head) and daughter, there is a roomer, and three girls with the same last name (ages 15, 13, and 11) shown as boarders.     What are the definitions of the two terms? (My guess is that this was a foster household for the three girls.)   What is the definition of the term ""lodger"" relative to the preceding?   Would these terms be used consistently across all censuses? "
273,Do authoritative renderings exist for coats of arms?,"For a given surname it is easy to find many variations in its coats of arms*. I get the impression that coats of arms were described in records as text and thus were open to interpretation at the time they are rendered. Is this true, or are there actual interpretations of such descriptions that are more official than others?  *I realize surnames may have differing coats (e.g., the same surname having different coats from Ireland v. England.) What I am interested to know is for a specific coat of arms is one rendering the authoritative version versus another? "
274,How can I learn more about ancestors who were Baptist Ministers/preachers in 18th-19th century Wales?,"My great (x4) grandfather John James 1771? - 13 July 1857 who lived at Trecwn Mill, Llanfair Nant Y Gof, Pembrokeshire, Wales was called on his gravestone (in the churchyard of St. Mary's Church, Llanfair Nant Y Gof) ""Y Parch John James"", that is:""The Reverend John James"".  David John's Journal 1882-85 identifies him as the ""Reverend John James, Fishguard"" when referring to the marriage of Ann John (my great x3 grandmother) to his son John James.  The very brief notice of his death in The Bristol Mercury and Western Advertiser on August 8th 1857 names him as ""John James, Baptist Minister"".   There is a second Baptist minister also from Llanfair Nant Y Gof who may be related: William James 1814? - 1851 (son of another John James). He too is buried in the Parish Churchyard with a gravestone that identifies him as a ""preacher with the Baptist denomination"". In Y Cenhadrw Americanaidd 1851 (The American Missionary), his death is reported (in Welsh) thus: ""Died Jan, 22, 1851 of tuberculosis at age 34, William James son of John and Elizabeth James, of Vrondrydd, parish Llanfair-nant-y-gof, Pembrokeshire, who was a good preacher.""  Why might William James's death be of interest in America? And how can I find out more about their activities as Baptists, and in particular the chapels they preached at? (The survival of Baptist chapel records in this area of Pembrokeshire is very poor.) "
275,Locating New England telegraph man (Lemuel Keyser Preston) ca1850?,"Charles H. Dillion, a 20th-century Texas telegraph man and author, called Lemuel Keyser ""L. K."" Preston the ""pioneer of the telegraph in Texas.""1   According to his earlier 1852 marriage record (Providence, Rhode Island)2 Lemuel K. Preston (said age 24) then resided Boston, Mass., supposedly a ""superintendant of telegraph."" Within seven months of the marriage, he was in Texas, working to raise funds and engineer telegraph lines under Galveston Bay.      His name is given, spelled and/or indexed in different ways3, but that hasn't prevented me from locating information about him later. Sigh. Despite a host of attempts, I have NOT been unable to locate this Lemuel Preston just prior to or about the time of his 1852 marriage.   I have looked in the (a) U.S. census of 1850, (b) Boston directories of (i) 1848, (ii) 1849, (iii) 1850, (iv) 1851 and 1851 or (v) 1852. (See also, ""Boston Directory,"" Wikipedia.)

Preston (ca1828-1881) was born at Broome, Lower Canada, the son of Michael and Mary (Merrill) Preston.4  In 1852, Lemuel married Sarah J. ""Josephine"" (Burton) Estabrook (ca1832-1864). She is identified in the marriage record as Josephine Easterbrook, ae 19, residing Boston, daughter of Amos Burton.2 Sarah J. (Burton) Estabrook seems otherwise daughter of daughter of Amos Burton and his wife, Sarah Merrill.5 Sarah J.'s first husband, Silas Estabrook, was probably the Boston printer by that name who died at San Francisco, California, 24 November 18496; he seems associated with his own bit of fame and mystery.   Sarah J. and Lemuel were almost certainly first cousins, so even if they hadn't lived in close proximity ca1850/1, they would have known each other. As these thing go, they would have been parellel cousins, because their mothers, Mary (Merrill) Preston and Sarah (Merrill) (Burton) Baldwin, would be daughters of Joseph and Sarah (Copp) Merrill of Warren, New Hampshire.7      In the 1850 U.S. census, Sarah J. and her two-year old son were living at Boston, Mass., with the woman presumed her mother, then Sarah Baldwin, who has two-year old daughter, Louisa Baldwin (aka Louisa ""Ella L."" Baldwin).7  It seems L. K. Preston followed his occupation to Texas. By the spring of 1853, he was testing methods to drop telegraph lines below Galveston Bay for The New Orleans, Red River Texas Telegraph Company.8 The line under the bay failed and the telegraph suffered other setbacks. Through it all, though, he apparently garnered the respect of those seriously impacted--the newspapers--so that he established life long associations.9   The family resided Galveston, Texas, in 1860. Sarah Josephine10 and her son11 died in November 1864 during a yellow fever outbreak. Lemuel remarried in 1865 to Alice A.

276,Seeking publication specifics for a 20th century news article (USA),"Charles H. Dillon (1889-1967) worked in different capacities for Western Union in Dallas, Texas. In the 1940s and 1950s, he wrote articles about the telegraph for the Texas Almanac and other publications. He also wrote newspaper articles. In 1958, his book,  A story of the telegraph and the Western Union and how they reached the southwest was published.    I'm seeking help finding the publication specifics for a lengthy newspaper article Charles Dillon wrote titled, ""Inventor's Offer of Perpetual Patent Rights to Telegraph Ignored by Texas Republic.""    I'd like to learn the name and date of the publication (hopefully with page/column number references).   Digital images of the lengthy article are online by Frank W. Shiels (Fort Worth), Crown Jewels of the Wire, April 1983 Archives (Letters to the Editor).   A graphic of the opening part of the article follows.     Update 1: This date I spoke with two officials at the Dallas Public Library. While we were not successful in finding the article, I did learn one long standing Dallas paper is no longer published, the Dallas Times Herald. Although issues of this paper are held on microfilm by the Dallas library, no extensive digitization or indexing of its issues has been done. Discussion lamenting all of this online in a 2010 thread, Phorum, ""Dallas Times Herald Archives.""  (I did find that NewspaperArchives has a very few (about 10) early editions of the Dallas Times Herald in its collection, but nothing that would help me.   Update 2: I heard from Casey Greene, Galveston and Texas History Center, Rosenberg Library (Galveston), over the weekend. As a clipping without further reference, the article appears in their vertical file ""Telegraph."" It was carefully clipped and then glued to cardboard backing--leaving almost no way of developing further clues about where or when the article might have been published. Although not publication specifics, I now have the next best thing--a solid reference to the vertical file at an established archive. It works for me.  "
277,How to interpret this Scottish Catholic Register birth/baptism entry?,"I've found the entry for an ancestor's birth in the Scottish Catholic Register (1851, Glasgow) and I'm confused what two annotations might mean. I found it on ScotlandsPeople but have searched the site for tips to no avail.  1) The second column describes the legitimacy of the birth but what does a blank space mean? Is there another possibility other than the parents were not married? I happen to know that one parent was Catholic and the other Presbyterian. Would the Catholic church have regarded that as unlawful?  2) Some of the names have an M or a P to the left of them. Thoughts on what that might mean?   "
278,Travelling to Romania to explore family roots?,"I will be traveling to Romania this spring for about a 2 week stay. Aside from enjoying the tourist side of things, family history exploration will be a priority. I will have a Romanian tour guide with me to assist with translation.   My grandfather's village was Pojorta, near Fagaras city. My grandmother, on the other hand, was from Bukovina, from the village of Burla near Radauti, in the north east part of the country.  What is the probability that I would be able to access records such as censuses, birth and marriage from the period of roughly 1875 to 1910 in these small villages, or the nearest city or town for those villages?   First off, would those records even exist and 2nd, where would they likely be held?   Your response to this would be of much value to me in planning the amount of time I'd need for this research. "
279,Was it mandatory to record a parent as deceased on a marriage certificate?,"I'll try to keep this simple. Two sisters ended up marrying two brothers. As a result the two marriages have a common set of parents.  Therefore, I have two marriage certificates in front of me. Up until now I was only paying attention to the 1942 certificate because it was for my wife's Grandparents. On that certificate it says this under the Groom's father entry:     Alexander Harris   However, I have now looked in more detail at the other marriage certificate from 1938. That one says:     Alexander Campbell Harris (Deceased)   It has the added details of the Groom's father being deceased. Which would mean he was deceased in 1942.  The fact would be correct because of the recent death certificate we found for Alexander which was in 1935.  So, why did the 1942 certificate not state the Groom's father was deceased? I assume it was not mandatory to make these clarifications? "
280,Explaining unknown person found in family listing in 1940 Federal Census of Iowa?,"the 1940 federal census record for my dad's family is 100% accurate for the entire family - names spelled correctly, ages correctly listed - for 2 parents and their 4 children. But the census also lists a 5th sibling, said to have been born in 1936, and so listed as being 4 years old at the time of the census.  I have not provided you with names because I know you don't publish personal info, but the census also provides the 4 year old's name.  My dad and all his living siblings say no such 5th sibling ever existed and say they know nothing about him.  I have briefly searched for IA (where they lived) birth certificates and found nothing.  No cousins by the listed name apparently existed.  The father of the household worked on the railroad so if a 5th child did exist, he could have been born outside of IA.    Can you offer any insights, or suggestions of sources I could check?    Are errors like this - adding an entire person, not just a typo or spelling mistake - in census data common?   "
281,"Combining maiden name, birth and death dates in parentheses","I would like to write a narrative sentence describing the names and birth and death dates of a given individual.

What about italics for the maiden name? "
282,Why would the spelling of a town in Romania be changed upon arrival in Canada?,"My relatives might have been from a place called Sânmihaui, Romania. They were German-speaking.

283,Reading the cause of death for an acute type of pneumonia,I received a death certificate today for my wife's Great Grandmother. Poor lady died at the young age of 47. Ouch - I am 47 in April!

284,Name changes in Canada in the 1920s?,My great-grandfather died in WW1 and then my great-grandmother remarried and had more children with her second husband. This would have been 1920s rural Saskatchewan. All of the children took one last name (not sure if it was the first dad or the second). How would this have been dealt with back then? Would there have been paperwork or would it be informal? 
285,"Reading remarks from Royal Hospital, Chelsea record from early 19th century?","The below picture is cropped from an image at Ancestry.com's UK, Royal Hospital, Chelsea: Regimental Registers of Pensioners, 1713-1882:    It relates to my 4th great grandfather Edmund Rouse who has been the subject of a previous Q&amp;A here about Establishing identity of Edmund Rouse of St Clement, Cabinet Maker, Private in Napoleonic Wars and Weaver?  In previous columns of the same row are pieces of information that give me confidence that this is the same Edmund Rouse that I have identified as my 4th great grandfather:   Admission: May 1812 Name: Edmd Rouse Age: 34 something about 28 Foot (which is the regiment the earlier Q&amp;A said he was in 1804-1809) something in the Private column that I cannot read but it may be the numbers of years he had that rank in different regiments Service: 9 4/12 (presumably 9 years, 4 months) Rate per day: 6d Complaint: nodes on his legs from repeated venereal complaints Where Born: Truro, Cornwall Trade or Occupation: Carpet Weaver   The row from which the cropped image comes is the Remarks, and I think it says:     D. D. Pagent's list / 24 June 181?   Is anybody able to work out the significance of this remark?    I am wondering whether D. D.

286,Cannot find an immigrant in the 1860/70 US Census,"In the US Census from 1860 and 1870, I am looking for a German immigrant named Gustav Adolf (or Adolph) Neumann, born October 27, 1824 in Leipzig, Saxony (Sachsen), Germany, who immigrated to the United States departing the October 10, 1858 from Bremen, Germany arriving in New York, on January 17, 1859. Upon arrival, he dictated to the Immigration Officer that he wanted to be farmer (in the state of New York?), see supporting documents below.  However, I do not find a corresponding person neither in the 1860, nor in the 1870 US Census. Can anyone, please, help me out?  German birth register of Leipzig:    Search entry of Castle Garden:   Extract of the Ship's manifest:   Edit:  I have not further information or documents about this person. I do not know whether he was married nor with whom, nor do I have any knowledge whether he had (ever) children.  However, I could infer some secondary information about the things I do know, i. e. he was not married nor did he have children in Germany before departing to the US.  Unfortunately, I do not know what kind of profession he had (his father was a trader, as well as two of his brothers, two other brothers were painter and lithographer, respectively), however, I do not believe that he was a farmer in his ""previous"" life in Germany as he and his ancestors lived in the city of Leipzig, which did not offer a job place for farmers. If he were he would have lived in smaller towns or villages around Leipzig, which at that time and age would not have been quite likely. Maybe he picked up a job related to that and this would be quite possible in a city like New York with many newspaper circulating?  Speaking of the US Civil War, which started two to three years after he arrived, I found three entries in the Soldiers and Sailors Database (see first three entries). But no birth date is indicated for better identification.   All in all, I hoped it was easier to find out about his whereabouts, but nothing but ambiguous bits of information. :/ It looks like that back then, US censuses or other bureaucratic documents missed the attention to detailed information common in Europe!?  Edit2:  Regarding the question, whether I am sure about the data I have:  I inherited a vast family tree with the birth date and the day of departure of G. A. Neumann, as well as his ancestors and some dates of his siblings. Although, I do not exactly know where my great-grandfather took the information (most likely from primary data such a certificates), the data of that tree have been proven correct in other parts of the tree by primary sources (like the register shown above) I was able to find online.  In addition, I have supporting data here of a project to digitalise and index all index cards made in the 1950s+ by a professional genealogist, called Helga  Moritz, who worked for the German Central Register of Genealogy in Leipzig. All data which are shown on that index card are correct with the data from the family tree given by my great-grandfather, who was dead (died in 1944) before these cards were made. So both sources, the family tree and the index cards, are unrelated and most presumably correct together with the primary source, the birth register, shown above. "
287,"Does AncestryDNA match of 1,697cM indicate half sibling or aunt?","I just received my AncestryDNA results. It shows I have a close family match with a woman who would be my grandmother, aunt, or half-sibling. We matched 1,697cM with 51 shared segments.   It cannot be a grandmother.   Through our shared matches, I was able to determine that the common denominator for the shared matches was my father's mother's mother. She gave birth to a daughter who gave birth to my father, my aunt, and a half brother. All of them are deceased and have been for years -- they did not do DNA testing.   My aunt did not have children (they wouldn't test at 1700 anyhow, correct?) and the half brother who had children wouldn't test at nearly 1700 either and none of them showed up as matches (they are in my family tree).   I am a 47 yr old female. My grandmother died before I was born so we can rule out a grandmother.   Am I missing any other options here?   This looks to be a half-sibling, correct? "
288,Seeking informational resources on “Robinson” family name origin?,"I have hit somewhat of a wall in researching the European lines of my Robinson ancestors.  I did learn of the possibility (vs. likelihood?) that Robinson is not a Scottish name, but rather originated in Northern England, and was further carried on after a Robinson Migration to Northern Ireland (Ulster Province, in particular).  Does anyone know of resources that can verify or debunk this information, and hopefully help me in identifying more of my ancestors? "
289,Are there any online resources to verify death of a inmate at Fort Leavenworth?,"One of my cousins asserts that her Uncle died ""in prison"" at Fort Leavenworth Kansas on 1 Jan 1976.

290,What coal mining towns in Austria were in common migration paths for Slovenians?,"I have a marriage in Austria on January 10, 1898 between Jožefina Gregorčič most likely born in Veliki Cernik, Slovenia on February 24, 1874 and coal miner Alois Kovač born in Austria on June 30, 1872.  They have a marriage commemorative souvenir written in german:   which translates as:     [groom] Alois Kowatsch [bride] Josefa Kowatsch, maiden name Gregortschitsch married 10. January 1898 in Austria.   Her brother was perhaps married in the mining town of Trbovlje in 1897.  Their first son was born on January, 24 1900 in Gladbeck, Coesfeld, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany where Alois was a coal miner before immigrating to the United States in 1904.  I'm trying to get some ideas of possible towns in Austria where they were married so I can search the churches for a marriage record.    Given that Alois was a coal miner, born in Austria and his wife born in Veliki Cirnik, what likely migration path would have taken him to meet his wife and get married in Austria before heading to Germany?    How might I locate common migration paths taken at this time to profile likely towns they got married in? "
291,DNA test to prove/disprove blood relationship going back ten or twelve generations,"On my mother's side I am related (in Southern Germany) to the B. family. My grandfather collected data back as far as my 10G-grandfather. I know nothing about his parents, although there is an old family belief that my 10G-grandfather immigrated from Switzerland, where the B. name also occurs. (It is not a particularly common last name, and back to 1589 all members of the B. family in Southern Germany can be traced back to this individual).   I was recently contacted by a Swiss genealogist who shares the B. last name. According to some research that he shared with me, there are three geographic concentrations of the B. name, in Southern Germany, around Zuerich, Switzerland, and in Thurgau, approximately 50 kilometers (30 miles) from Zuerich.   This member of the B. family also indicated that a DNA test had shown that the Zuerich and Thurgau clusters are not blood related.   Would there be any hope of connecting the Southern German cluster into this sample, to settle whether or not there is a relationship between my cluster and one of the other two?   As I said, I assume that one must go back at least ten generations, and I assume that the DNA has been pretty well shaken up, mixed and diluted in the meantime.   Is there any hope of getting meaningful results out of such a test?   How large a sample might be needed?   How diverse would it have to be, that is, how far back along my cluster of the family would I have to go in order to have a hope of definitive results? "
292,Finding source of father's first name on 1713 Staffordshire baptism from FamilySearch index?,"William Fletcher, who I believe to have been my 6th great grandfather was baptised on 27 Sep 1713 at St Mary, Brewood, Staffordshire, England.  The image of that baptism, from FindMyPast's Staffordshire baptisms (Archive Reference D4014/1/3 Page 40), appears below, and to me it can be seen quite clearly that the christian name of his father has been omitted:    However, FindMyPast presents an England, Births &amp; Baptisms 1538-1975 Transcription (presumably based on FamilySearch information) which says:  Father's first name(s)  Jo Father's last name  Fletcher   Ancestry.com's England, Select Births and Christenings, 1538-1975 (based on England, Births and Christenings, 1538-1975.

Is there another image, or paper record, that these three websites (all citing the same England Births and Christenings, 1538-1975 database) could have been trusting as their source to transcribe William's father's name as Jo?  I note that a father named John appears a few rows down suggesting that the writer of these records did not abbreviate that name to ""Jo"". "

When James C.Siegel died, he was married to Frances (18 FEB 1891 - ?). James Siegel had a son named William Matthew Siegel (1 APR 1907 - 26 APR 1970).

My aunt recently researched our family history and discovered that my great- grandfather was half Mexican. but that's not the problem.

298,Strange results on DNA Test,"I hope someone can help me understand my DNA test results from My Heritage.com.  Since i know that my family is kind of mixed, i thought it would be a great idea to see which parts of foreign DNA i inherited. We live in Northern Germany. My maternal grandmother has definitely slavic heritage and my maternal grandfather is supposed to have also a bulgarian or some southern (slavic) background (he is adopted, so thats what we concluded from the information we had.) the maternal side from my father were German Ashkenazi Jews. Only my paternal grandfather was german.   I was really excited for my results. I'm not at Genealogy Expert, but i thought this test help me to find out why my appearance looks like this. I was told many times that I look really russian or ukrainian. My whole face structure is really slavic and I do have really fair skin and hair.   Isn't it possible to estimate what DNA someone might have based on your looks?   I know that Germany is hard to see as one ethnic group, but I definetly wouldn't see myself as Central/Northern-European looking. But thats what i got: A hundred percent(!) result Central-Europe/Northern Europe Ethnicity estimate.   I still don't understand how this could work?   I know that DNA is not evenly passed down. What confuses me is that i read everywhere that nobody could have a hundred percent of one ethnicity and with my family history it just seems... unrealistic.  "

300,When the same name or family comes up in ancestors of DNA matches,"I am pouring through the family trees of my DNA matches on both GEDMatch.com and Ancestry.com and, while it hasn't helped me solve any road blocks yet in the 2 years since I tested myself, I have noticed groupings of families and even specific names that come up often. What is the likelihood that heavy occurrence of specific names or families indicates an ancestor that I'm unaware of, versus just being a coincidence caused by other factors?  For example, on my Mom's side, we haven't been able to determine what Sherman family her third grandfather descended from. There are not a lot of results for Sherman among her DNA matches, however, the Brownell family of Rhode Island does come up a lot and I know the Brownells and Shermans were close in colonial Rhode Island, USA. Could the fact that dozens of DNA cousins have Brownell family members from colonial Rhode Island in their family tree indicate that my mother's brickwall ancestor is from that family?  Another example, my father's great grandfather was adopted and nothing comes up in his DNA cousin family trees for the biological name, Latour, however, the name Jean Louis Larmeu has come up as an ancestor among his DNA matches dozens of times. Could this indicate an ancestor or could it just be a coincidence that I happen to be related to a lot of people that are related to this person?  Edit: My question is specific to a genealogical principle rather than my particular ancestor and circumstance to engage answers on this principle in general, however, in the example scenarios I provided, the DNA matches do not otherwise have any matching surnames or ancestors and they are all about 4-6th cousins, matching up to the position of my brickwall ancestors, who are my 3rd great grandparents.

301,Were minors always described as such in 18th century wills?,"I have been reading a will (Ancestry UK link), written by Giles Fox of Bourton on the Water, Gloucestershire, in 1780. It was proved after his death in 1789. In it, he leaves his property to his three daughters: Martha, Mary and Elizabeth.  I have good candidates for these three daughters, but there are some similar records to filter through, and an idea of birth dates would be very helpful.  Giles leaves his estate directly to his daughters, who were also executors. Nothing is ""left in trust until they reach 21"", or any similar language that I have seen in other wills where children inherited. So can I assume from this that the three daughters were all adults at the time the will was written? Or is that not certain?  It's certainly likely that they were adults - the inventory (on the page following the will) in 1789 shows that all had married by that point, and one was already widowed. But I'd like to know if the wording of the will is something I can rely on. "
302,Relationship terminology after death of a relative,"Please can someone tell me, when a married woman dies, would her widower still be called the son in law of his late wife's parents?  If so, would that title continue to apply if he remarried? He might then have a new mother and father in law, so could he be son in law to both sets of parents? "
303,What to do with late mother's boxes of documents?,"My late mother had an amateur interest in genealogy of our family. She gathered boxes of clippings and writings and photos, etc. She flew to Europe to visit sites and meet with descendents, etc.    No one in the extended family has any interest in the materials.  What can be done with them?   In case it is relevant ... born in 1929, she is buried in a National Cemetery, my living father served in the Marines.    Since initially writing this Q, it occurred to me that one possibility is to deposit them with US Library of Congress, see this more narrow question:   Submitting genealogy materials to US Library of Congress? "
304,Submitting genealogy materials to US Library of Congress?,"As of 2017-11-17, I'm still waiting for reply from the Local History and Genealogy Collection Development of the US Library of Congress, to my email on 2017-11-13:   My late mother spent many hours researching our family history in various US libraries,  and made special trips to Europe to visit  sites and people.  Would her collection of  genealogical materials be of interest to the  Library?  Our family is quite ordinary, with the possible  exception that she is buried in a National  Cemetery; my living father served in the military.  I would not be offended if you answered no, but  would appreciate hearing back either way.    For reference, this is the LoC page on the topic:  [website]Anyone care to share experiences submitting genealogy materials, published or unpublished, to LoC? In particular, I'm looking for any tips or considerations, such as   pros and cons   formats original materials or copies via Copyright Office or direct  "
305,An explanation for unusual birth record,"I'm trying to find an explanation for why Jane Ann Parry, born in 1857, was born in Kent.  Jane Ann Parry's parents are Thomas Parry and Jane Parry (I know this because of later census records 1861 and 1871 in Chester). She married Joseph Campbell in 1879 in Tranmere.   I looked into both Thomas Parry and Jane Parry (neé Jones) to see where they were born, and they were both born in Chester, and both live in Chester in 1851 and 1861. On census records in 1871, 1881, 1891 Jane is listed as being born in Chatham, Kent circa 1857.  Hence I am trying to figure out why they were in Brompton, near Chatham in Kent in 1857 but not in 1851 and 1861? Any insight or will this never be known? Even speculation is helpful.  Thomas 'occupation was as a ropemaker. I think since ropemaking was so often entwined with shipbuilding and there is a large shipyard in Chatham that may be an avenue of possibility. However,  I have no proof. "
306,"Information on a ship called the ""Bancroft""","My thrice great grandfather Joseph Campbell (born 1854 in Chester) is listed as a ship master on a vessel called ""Bancroft"" docked in Birkenhead in the 1881 census. He is the only listed crew member and I would like to get an insight into what the vessel may have been for. It doesn't seem to have been mentioned in any newspaper articles from my research so far. Was it a fishing vessel? Transport? Recreational (I doubt)?  I haven't traced much further back than this yet in this line. "
307,Sharing genealogical data (from GEDCOM) with family members?,"I recently inherited a large (paper-based) set of records pertaining to my family history. I spent about three days converting one branch of the family to GEDCOM format, using a free software package. So far there are twelve generations and about 300 entries in the tree. The entire package I was given is an inch and a half thick, but I anticipate a lot of duplication and estimate that the complete tree will have around 1000 entries.  At a family gathering today I was asked about sharing the data, and I am at a bit of a loss what to do. I can't just give the GEDCOM source to this person, and asking them to download and install software just to see the tree is a bit much to ask. Unfortunately the software I am using does not seem to allow me to convert the family tree to pdf format. (I am not even sure that a tree drawing is the best way to represent the links.) As you can see I am a newbie, and internet searches have not gotten me very far. I do not even know what search parameters I should use.  Are there (free) solutions out there that would allow me to easily convert the GEDCOM source into something my relatives could look at either on-line (hyperlinked HTML for instance) or on paper? At this point it is hard to gauge how much interest there would be in this tree, but I anticipate further requests and want to design the system up front with easy, user-friendly access in mind.  I have read Publishing family tree online?, but I found the answer not very enlightening. What does it mean/involve to set my ""own domain and site""? How would that help with my goal of distributing the data so that my relatives (probably just a small number of people) can have a look at the family tree? Are there software packages or other resources that can help?  Where would I start?) "
308,How to handle name changes in records?,"Is there a standard for how to write a person's name in genealogy records or family trees?  What I'm getting at is what to do with the maiden names, or previous names. If Peter Svensson was born 1900, married and changed his name to Peter Johansson, and finally died in 1990, what would I call him in a record?  1) Peter Svensson (Johansson), 1900 - 1990 2) Peter Johansson (Svensson), 1900 - 1990   Are there other, better alternatives?  What would be correct or most common? "
309,After a Big-Y test on FamilyTreeDNA does it make sense to order further SNP tests?,"I ordered the Big-Y on top of my yDNA-111 STR test and it specifies many SNPs now that Big-Y is complete, but FTDNA continues to offer to sell me additional SNP tests and packets, in particular the I1 - Z60 SNP Pack.  Does it make any sense to order these? Will they provide additional information not in the Big-Y results?  If so, why are some SNPs included in the Big-Y but not others that I may have? "
310,How to confirm my research of Charles P. Cantrell?,"We have been trying to track down my great grandfather, Charles P. Cantrell. He &amp; my great grandmother (Mary Alice Wilson) married in 1906 in Jackson County, TN. That has been the only definitive record we have had for a long time on their marriage &amp; even proving my great grandfather even existed. I had all but given up hope that I would find him. They had two children, my grandfather, the youngest, born in 1910.  I started looking into different Charles P. Cantrell's on Ancestry.com and found one in Jackson County, TN on a census in 1910. He is living back at home with his father and step-mother, is stated as married (M1 on census) and married for 4 years, doesn’t state any children. But no wife, nor children back with him, he is alone. The age range matches the range he would have been &amp; the marriage dates match too.  Now, on the marriage certificate, it says ‘CP Cantrell aspires of FM Dennis’ to marry. We have no idea who FM Dennis is and have never heard that name before. So when I looked at the 1910 census I noticed that there is a ‘Frank Dennis’ (occupation is Superintendent of Country Private Farm) living next door to my great grandfather who has now come back home. So my family and I are thinking that what probably happened is that FM Dennis, a prominent person in the community with his occupation (?), signed for them to get married and they knew him since he lived next door to my great grandfather. (We do have my great grandfather &amp; his family on a 1900 census, but they are living somewhere else. I’m thinking that they had moved by 1906 when he &amp; my great grandmother got married &amp; was maybe working for FM Dennis or something). We have my great grandmother on a census a few towns over in 1910 working as a servant. So maybe she left him (or vice versa) &amp; he had to go live back with his dad for awhile. We are looking at FM Dennis as the link to confirm that this is my great grandfather &amp; would like your professional opinion on that.  How can I confirm that this is the correct Charles P. Cantrell? "
311,Recording census as event or source in GRAMPS?,"For some reason I am struggling to understand different explanations about this.  I have been told that a Census is an event, and the sheet of paper is a source.  This is similar to a Birth being an event, and the Birth Cert being a source.  Is that correct?    So do I add a single Event of the, say, 1901 census, then what do I add to each person?  Another event?   "
312,How to interpret dates on California Indexes to Electoral Registers,"Ancestry has a collection ""California, Voter Registrations, 1900-1968"". This consists of images of various documents relating to Electoral Registers. In particular, I am looking at the images for San Francisco 1920. I would like to understand how to interpret the dates on what I am calling the Precinct Header.    The date bit reads: ""To and including April 3, 1920"". What does this mean? The data in this Index to a Register must have been collected at a certain point and thus represent the situation at that date (errors and omissions excepted) - can that date be (roughly or accurately) deduced from the April 3 1920 date? So taking Ciro Anzalone as an example: He is recorded as being at 1131 Ocean Avenue. Can we say when he was there?  Two background points to explain this, perhaps: I am trying to trace a family whose mother is known by me as ""Infamous Annie"" for the fact that she never appears with the same husband in consecutive censuses until she gets fairly deep into middle age. Turns out her son, Bert, has at least one similar episode and I am trying to align Directories, Registers and Censuses to work out the story of Bert and his wife. I am convinced he's telling stories in at least one of the Directories but I'm also puzzled about the data in the 1920 Electoral Register and the 1920 Census.  My initial assumption was to interpret these Registers like UK Electoral Registers. Our 1930 Register, for instance, applied for the whole of 1930 but represented the situation at the qualifying date of 1 June 1929. I was therefore imagining the qualifying / effective date for this San Francisco register to be well before 3 April 1920. But that makes no sense in terms of what the Register and Census are then saying to me about Bert's wife leaving him and then returning. "
313,Where is John Knight of Henry Kentucky in 1840 census?,"I'm trying to find the 1840 census record for John Knight, b. 1793 in the 1840 census.  Both Ancestry and FamilySearch list him in their index, but have no record.  Here is result on FamilySearch:    Why is he in the index, but there is no image.  Page 299 is page 28 of 33 at Family Search and is the last page of 32 images shown on Ancestry and is right hand side of two page spread with names on left page.  I searched the left page and see no John Knight.  Where can I find his record?  Why would it be in index but missing from images? "
314,Interpreting DNA test that shows mother was 1/3 Jewish?,I'm assuming that my mother's mother was full or 2/3 Jewish for my mother to end up being 1/3 Jewish. So what does that make me (her son)? Would I be considered to be of Jewish decent if my mother is only part Jewish? 
315,"Passenger list from Antwerp, Belgium to the UK in 1908?",My Grandfather was coming from Romania to the UK around 1910. He went through immigration at Antwerp. How do I find the ship he was on? His name was Stan Cancea.    Last night I found his immigration papers in Antwerp so he came over in March 1908.  It most probably was just a ferry so will be difficult to find. His birth date is different on his immigration paper to his death certificate. So obviously he was older than we all knew! I think I shall try and find out why he came over ie what the situation was like in Romania then and was there lots of immigration? 
316,Can I post this on Familysearch?,"So, I was doing some Family History at my local Family History Center when I came across newspaper articles on NewspaperArchive.com concerning some events that happened to ancestors I was researching. One of them was concerning the murder trial of which one of my ancestors was the victim, and the other a short paragraph about how another ancestor was arrested for seduction.  To ask, is it acceptable to even think about putting a screenshot or a transcription of the article to their respective ancestors without violating copyright? If so, are those stories OK for FamilySearch? I know that there are certain limitations that are there that keep the high quality of memories in FamilySearch.  "
317,Seeking records of 18th century Somerset surgeons named John Chichester?,"This question is related to Interpreting &quot;married by Licence as I am credibly informed&quot; on 1732 Gloucestershire marriage record? in which I began to try to find the birth family of my 5th great grandfather Edward Chichester, who was buried at Leighland, Old Cleeve, Somerset, England on 4 May 1823, aged 89, which puts his birth year at about 1734.  As a recap:     He married Constant/Constance Lyddon on 6 Jun 1765 at Leighland and   they baptised all their children at Leighland/Old Cleeve: John (29 Sep   1765; which may be why he agreed to a 200 pound marriage bond), Robert   (1767), Giles (1769), William (1773), Jane (1776), Charles (1777) and   Thomas (1779).      With Edward naming his first son John, I would not be surprised to   find that as the name of Edward's father, and there was a John   Chichester baptised to Giles on 11 Sep 1703 at Old Cleeve.      John Chichester (presumably that one), and his wife Elizabeth baptised   a son John on 11 Apr 1733 at Leighland, which I think makes a   reasonable case for Edward having a brother named John (1733) and a   father named John (1703).   In Ancestry.com's ""UK, Register of Duties Paid for Apprentices' Indentures, 1710-1811"" I recently found a record for Robert Row of Leigh, Somerset, Surgeon taking on an apprentice John, son of Giles Chichester, of Lyland, Somerset, Yeoman on 9 Oct 1717.    This John Chichester is the candidate I have for Edward's father.  Also in Ancestry.com's ""UK, Register of Duties Paid for Apprentices' Indentures, 1710-1811"", some time ago I found a record for John Ball of Williton, Somerset, Surgeon taking on an apprentice named John Chichester on 30 Apr 1782.    This John Chichester is Edward's eldest son.  He was baptised to Edward and Constant on 29 Sep 1765 at Leighland, Somerset.  Note that the baptism record which is on its own at the bottom of a page is clearly dated 1775 but this is believed to be an error because all other records on that page and the next page are from 1763, 1764, 1765 and 1766.  What type of records might I expect to find that mention West Somerset surgeons in the 18th century?    If I could find a record that says one John Chichester is the grandson/grandfather of the other, then I think I will have my best proof yet that Edward (1734-1823) is the son of John (1703-1774).  I am aware of ""Eighteenth century medics (subscriptions, licences, apprenticeships)"" which I suspect is likely to mention both surgeons named John Chichester but I have not been able to view a copy.  The younger John Chichester married Elizabeth Armstrong on 24 Feb 1783 at Leighland, but was later a physician in South Carolina, USA where he married Mary Beatrix Powell on 10 Nov 1794 and he practised at Charleston until at least 1806 (before returning to England to live in Gloucestershire where he died at Cheltenham in 1830). Consequently, any writings about his life may be found in the US as well as England. "
318,"Understanding Belgium, Antwerp Police Immigration Index Numbers?","  I am referring to the record marked with an arrow.  Can someone tell me what do the numbers or letters in parenthesis after his name and before his birth date mean ?  Also on the extracted info on the left they say ""Other: 1916"" - Can anyone guess where they took this year from and what does it mean?  B.T.W - Just for reference if anyone is specifically interested in this record - IMHO the middle name for this person should be ""Mordeko"" (from Hebrew Mordechai) and not ""Morako"" (I have a birth record for him somewhere else).

319,"Finding apprenticeship record for Blacksmith born 1846 at Illogan, Cornwall, England?","In another, currently unanswered, question (Where was Matthew Nettell, of Illogan, Cornwall, for the 1861 Census?) I sought the 1861 Census location for my 2nd great grandfather Matthew Nettell who was born in 1846 at Illogan, Cornwall and was recorded as being a Blacksmith on his 1865 Marriage Certificate (at Redruth, Cornwall).  Does anyone know the likely apprenticeship path he would have taken to assume this profession, and what records may be available for me to try and find where and when he may have done that? "
320,Finding B.213 forms for Australian Nurse serving mainly in Egypt during World War I?,"This is a follow on question from Interpreting Service Record of QAIMNS nurse in Egypt at time of Gallipoli campaign? which could be referred to for additional background.  My great grand aunt Eleanor Bessie Stacy (1879-1925) was a World War I nurse with Queen Alexandra's Imperial Military Nursing Service (QAIMNS) and later the Australian Army Nursing Service (AANS).    I have a copy of her QAIMNS service record (WO/399/7869) from The National Archives and a small excerpt from that is pictured below.      The last column mentions ""B213"" and my understanding from various web pages like Researching Canadian Soldiers of the First World War is that the B213 forms are a ""Record of promotions, reductions, transfers, casualties, etc., during active service"".  Does anyone know if the B.213 forms related to an Australian Nurse serving mainly in Egypt during World War I are likely to have survived? "
321,How to locate 1940 United States census pages by address?,"I'm not able to locate a George Bismark Foster, married to Ola Kathleen Mundy in the 1940 census records by name search.  I know they were still alive because I have found an April 27, 1942 WWII draft registration card that lists them both as living at 4237 University Blvd., Dallas, Dallas County, Texas.  According to George's death certificate, they moved to Dallas in 1934.  Therefore, I think it is very likely that for the 1940 census they were living in Dallas, and that it was probably also at 4237 University Blvd in 1940.  Therefore, I'd like to find the 1940 census records for University Blvd in Dallas and search the page to try and find their record.  Using Ancestry.com or FamilySearch.org, how can I locate the 1940 census pages for that street in Dallas?  Is there an index by location I can use?  Can I determine the voting district and use that to find the right pages? "
322,Finding origins of Romanian grandparents born in mid 1920s?,"  My Grandparents immigrated to Perth, Western Australia in 1950.   My Grandfather was born in Ploiesti in 1924 and went on to be a soldier in the in the Romanian Airforce during WW2.   During the war he was a Prisoner of war in Germany until Hitler took him as a Radiographer and Navigator. He was a qualified Engineer prior to the war. I know this from the documents we found when he past away. He even kept his ration card and a P.O.W. card.The cards were written in German, the card had a Swastika on it.But his second wife had Dimentia and misplaced that card. I am in the process of tracking it down.  After the war they were in a Displaced People's Camp in Berlin.   My Grandmother was born in Brasov in 1923. She was from German decent and passed away in 1976 - I never got to meet her.  When my Grandfather passed away in 1996 we got a letter telling us that we had inherited some of Ploiesti's oil fields and land in Transylvania. As my Mother couldn't speak Romanian we have never really known, only we know it involved Oil and land in Transylvania and a Vineyard in Ploiesti. However, because we were not Citizens of Romania the Government had confiscated it? And they said they would pass it on to any extended family we had in Romania. Mum now regrets it. My Grandparents had secrets, and because we didn't speak Romanian we couldn't communicate with them. I know from my Aunty that when they were in Romania they had wealth, but not when they fled. All the photos we have showed them looking well off financially. My Grandparents never returned and they made Mum and us promise never to go. As I said ""secrets"".  I desperately want to track down my extended family. All I have is photos that were taken in the 80's and old ones taken before the war. I know that some of my Grandmothers family ended up in Canada. I have my Grandfathers address book from 1978,and it has Romanian addresses that don't seem to exist now. We do have some names in there that Mum believes to be Aunties but they were older than my Grandfather and I have no idea how to contact them.  Because my Grandfathers surname is common it's really hard to find him.      Question: With this mixed German / Romanian ancestry and dispersed geography across a short time period, where do I begin to find who my great grand parents were?  "
323,Are South Australian Miners expected to appear in Boothby and later directories?,"My 2nd great grandfather Edward Sleep, with his wife Charlotte Hancock, immigrated to Port Adelaide, South Australia aboard the William Prowse on 22 Sep 1853.  Edward's occupation was recorded as Miner.  From the birth, marriage and death records of their nine children, all born in South Australia, I have established a timeline for their known residences:   arrived in Kooringa (formerly called The Murray) before 29 Dec 1854 left Kooringa after 2 Dec 1859 arrived Green's Plains (between Paskeville and Moonta) before 25 Oct 1861 left Green's Plains after 29 Nov 1861 arrived Moonta before 12 Mar 1864   At Moonta they may have had several residences because events are recorded as Moonta, then Moonta Mines and finally East Moonta, but these three locations are within a few miles of each other so changing residences would not imply that Edward changed workplaces.  From the timeline and locations above I would expect that Edward as a Miner would have had three employers:   South Australian Mining Association (at Kooringa) Cumberland Mining Company (at Green's Plains) Moonta Mining Company (at Moonta, Moonta Mines and East Moonta)   The mineral being mined mostly at each of these locations was copper and the workforce came primarily from Cornwall (like Edward).  I would like to try and find some details of Edwards employment and for many South Australians this can be done simply by looking them up in the Boothby, then Sands and McDougall, directories but Edward appears to be missing in all that I have searched so far.  Assuming he is found absent from all of them (and I have looked each 5 years up until his death in 1903) is there another source, perhaps mining company records, that I could use to try and get more detail about where and when he was mining? "
324,Married couple presented for fornication in Nottinghamshire (1631)?,"I have been searching for a marriage for Peter Allicocke and Ann. Peter and Ann had five children: Mary (1631), Elizabeth (1634), Peter (1637), Francis (1641), and Edward (1645-1662). The four surviving children, as well as his wife Ann are noted in his will in 1670. I think I may have found a possible marriage on 9 Nov 1630 at Laxton, Nottinghamshire.   The marriage is transcribed by Phillimore (p 48) as: ""Wm. Allicocke &amp; Ann Betney"", 9 Nov 1630  The marriage is transcribed on FamilySearch (Bishop's Transcripts source) as: Richd. Allicocke &amp; Anne Betney, 9 Nov 1630  Clearly there is some ambiguity about the groom's name. There does not appear to be a Richard or William Allicocke having children in this area of Notts at the same time, so I suspect there is an error either in the transcripts or original, and it should be Peter.  There is also some ambiguity about the year of this marriage. On the NFHS records (which also appear on FindMyPast) the marriage date appears as 9 Nov 1629, but I think this is a mistake due to the fact there were only a handful of marriages in this church each year. The previous marriage in the register was on 30 Nov 1629, so the 9 Nov 1630 marriage appears right after it, which is where the confusion arose.  Peter had a daughter baptised on 27 Mar 1631 at Laxton - the baptism register does not name the mother but I believe the mother was Ann.  A ""Peter Alicocke and Ane Betne"" were presented for fornication on 26 Apr 1631 - I'm guessing due to the birth of their daughter the previous month.  It seems strange to me that Peter and Ann would be presented for fornication after they were married, even if a child was born  5 or 6 months into the marriage. In my experience it was not particularly unusual for a child to be born a little sooner after marriage than was proper, and I don't think most couples in this circumstance were usually presented in this way. This is making me doubt whether I have the correct marriage.  Therefore my question is whether it is likely a married couple would be presented for fornication under the circumstances I have described (and can you provide any documented examples)? If not, do you think that the couple married in 1630 is different from the couple presented a few months later?  "
325,How to locate Missouri records for Goodman & Boller undertakers of Boonville?,"I'm trying to locate the records of an undertaker for a burial in 1931.  Goodman &amp; Boller were in business as undertakers until at least 1952.  They also had a furniture store of the same name as shown here.  How can I find if this business has been renamed or bought by another and thus their records might be held in a new company name?  I wish to inquire about a 17 Aug 1931 death and burial of Anna M Faught (married to Foster) in which they list Mt Washington Cess (?hard to read?).  There is no Mt Washington in Boonville, perhaps it was sent to Independence, Missouri, but that cemetery has no findagrave entry for her? "
326,How likely are 1915 Missouri neighbors with same last name to be related?,"I see a George Bismarck Foster (b. May 1869 Missouri – d. abt 1940) married 1890 to Anna M. Faught (b. 5 Jun 1870 Harrisburg, Dauphin, Pennsylvania – d. 17 Aug 1931 Boonville, Cooper, Missouri) that lived at 934 South Main Street, Independence, Jackson, Missouri from at least 1910 to 1920 as evidenced by the 1910 and 1920 censuses and city directories during that time.  (Note that one hand written family tree I got from an ancestor lists George as being born 2 March 1869, whereas the 1900 census says May 1869 that I'm currently using.)  His son, Charles Edward Foster (b. 13 Aug 1895 Missouri – d. 2 Nov 1965 Los Angeles, California) is shown to reside in city directories at 934 South Main Street in 1910, 1911, 1912, 1913, 1914, and 1915.  However, in 1916, the directory lists him living next door at 938 South Main Street.  Then in 1917 the city directory again lists him at 934 South Main Street after he got married in 1917 to Gladys E Sturges before they move into the own house at 115 East Richaud by 8 Jan 1920 according to the 1920 census.  George Bismarck Foster is son of Charles Foster (b. abt 1831 Germany – d. ?) and Margaret Unknown (b. abt 1848 Missouri – d. ?).  He may have a brother Charles and a sister Anna.  I have very little information about his parents and possible siblings, and what I list here may be wrong.  I also see a Charles Henry Foster (b. 16 Jan 1868 Milton, Pike, Illinois – d. 26 Sep 1918 938 South Main Street, Independence, Jackson, Missouri) whose parents were William Ross Foster (b. abt. 1841 Ohio – d. bef 1900) and Amanda Jane Thomas (b. Feb 1847 Illinois – d. ?) and who was married to Minnie A Fischer (b. 17 Jun 1868 Jefferson City, Cole, Missouri – d. 23 Sep 1952 Independence, Jackson, Missouri).  William Ross Foster is of unknown parentage.  Charles Henry Foster lived at 938 South Main Street from at least 1911 to his death in 1918 as evidenced by the city directories.  How likely is it that the Charles Henry Foster at 938 South Main Street is related to the George Bismarck Foster at 934 South Main Street?  Is it likely that Charles Edward Foster's listing 1916 at 938 South Main Street is just an error?  I'm unable to connect these two Foster lines.  Ultimately, I'd like to learn more about George's parents and siblings, but thus far, due to the common names and scant records I have found, this line has been a dead end.  Any suggested resources to pursue would be appreciated. "
327,Finding descendants of British great grand uncle who emigrated to Australia?,"From Finding UK record(s) of British great-grandfather with children born in Japan during 1890s? I have received the information of the person with the possibility of great-grandfather.   However, I have a bigger problem from here which is whether he really is my great-grandfather because there was a brother to him in the information.   If I can find his brother's descendants, then I may be able to learn the kinship with DNA testing.   How can I find the living descendants of this great grand uncle?  I was born and grew up in Japan where research is easy for me but I do not know the best way in Britain and Australia.  C.Z.Ede is the name of the candidate for my great-grandfather and his information can be found at [website]There is also a Mr Peter Zohrab site ([website]Mr Peter Zohrab from that site suggested that I look for descendants of Sydney Cuthbert Ede in Australia or New Zealand. However, I have not yet found any. I am also inquiring at the church in which he was baptized. "
328,Approaching relatives with dementia about family history?,"It is important to write down or record the memories of elderly relatives while we still have the opportunity. However, I find it difficult to know how to best approach this subject even with close family members with dementia or Alzheimer's disease. The person I am thinking about at the moment lost her husband quite recently, and sometimes gets confused about when and where she is today. I do not want to make things harder for her by asking lots of questions.  What techniques work well in these circumstances? How to start the conversation? What ways, for example using photographs, can you trigger memories? Is it better to do this in one sitting, or to bring the subject up more frequently in casual conversation? How to guide the conversation to avoid painful or confusing memories?  Thoughts on any or all of these questions would be useful. "
329,"Is there list of apprenticeship types for FindMyPast record set called Britain, Country Apprentices 1710-1808?","A new set of records has come online at FindMyPast called Britain, Country Apprentices 1710-1808:     What was your family trade? Discover your ancestor in the registers   from the Board of Stamps. The registers recorded the tax paid for each   indenture for an apprentice. The average apprenticeship was seven   years. That is seven years of family history you can reveal through   these records, as well as your ancestor’s parent’s name, his/her   master and the profession they chose. The registers record   apprenticeships from the whole of Great Britain.   I suspect that a number of my ancestors are awaiting my discovery in them.  I maintain a list of occupations uncovered for my ancestors and which ancestors were engaged in each (and when) and I plan to go through them systematically.  Is there a definitive list of occupations for which apprenticeship records can be found in the aforementioned set of records? "
330,Did indentured servants in 1700s Pennsylvania receive different types of land warrants from what other immigrants to PA received?,"I have an ancestor who left Northern Ireland (probably County Down) sometime around 1745-1750 and settled in York County, Pennsylvania.  I think he may have come to America as an indentured servant for a few years, and then set out on his own.  I am trying to confirm whether he was, in fact, an indentured servant.  James Leyburn's book ""The Scotch-Irish"" said that thousands of immigrants who came from Northern Ireland in the 1700s were too poor to pay for their passage. Instead, they would agree to work as indentured servants for a few years in exchange for paid passage to America.  Leyburn's book also said that the legislature in Pennsylvania set certain rules for these contracts of indenture.  One rule was that the indentured servant was entitled to fifty acres of land at the end of the contract (usually four to seven years).  My question is this: When the indentured servant received his warrant for fifty acres, was his warrant any different from the warrants issued to other types (non-indentured) of immigrants?  In other words- is there a way to tell, by looking at the warrant, or by the type of warrant, whether someone was an indentured servant or not?  My ancestor received a warrant for fifty acres in Hallam Township, York County, PA on September 10, 1750.  I have a scanned copy of the warrant.  I'd like to try to figure out whether he was in America for a few years before 1750, serving out a contract of indentured servitude. "
331,Relationship between Baldwin II and IV of the Crusades?,"I'm trying to find out if and how Baldwin II and Baldwin IV, kings of Jerusalem, are related.    Their wikipedia pages don't make it easy to determine this.    So, my question is whether these Baldwins, by virtue of their name and suffix, have to be related?    In other words, can I assume they are at least somewhat closely related?    Who or what determines if a person can become the next person in line to carry a name (with an incremented suffix)?   "
332,Street index for Canada 1921 census,"Is there a street index for the larger cities in the 1921 Canadian census?  (When I first asked this question, the 1921 census (on Ancestry) was images only, with no name index.  Although a name index now exists, a street index is still useful, especially to find known addresses where the name may have been mistranscribed.)  A city like Toronto is divided into districts (north, west etc) and then by 50-100 subdistricts, each of maybe five street sections and twenty images.  Many of the subdistricts have a full list of the parts of the streets in the polling subdivision they cover:     Sub-District 48 - Ward 3  Polling Subdivision no. 80. Comprising   Charles Street, both sides, from Church to Jarvis Street; Hayden   Street, both sides, from Church Street to east end; Bloor Street,   south side, from Church toJrvis Street; Church Street, both sides,   from Isabella to Bloor Street, Jarvis Street, west side, from Isabella   to Bloor Street.   If a subdivision has more than one polling subdivision in it, there is no description of the streets included.  This may be something that is being worked on, to add later.  I was able to copy and paste the descriptions for several districts of Toronto and find the street I wanted by searching the resulting text.  Luckily, the people I looked for hadn't moved since their last known address in 1917, were in a subdistrict where the streets were listed, and were in a short street.  But it would be easier if there was a simple index (street, or section of street, giving district and subdistrict).  Does such a thing exist?  Even better if it includes the streets that are currently missing from the Ancestry listings (the cases where there is more than one polling district in a subdivision).  (update)  Drawing boxes on a map from the subdivision descripions doesn't help, because (in Toronto at least) each street segment in a subdivision is named (there are no further named streets within the area, so nothing else to find).  I've drawn Toronto Centre, ward 3, subdistrict 48 (described above), using geojson.io on a modern day map of Toronto, and published it on gist (and now also embedded an image below:).   Note it's not really a box, just a walking route, with only one side of some streets, both sides of others.  All the street segments are listed in the description.  Looking at other cities, most like Montreal and Vancouver don't have any street descriptions at all, and some like London ONT do have bounding boxes in the description, for that latter case drawing on a map would help.  Using directories to find the ward does really help in a big city, but in the case of Toronto Centre for example there are perhaps 40 subdistricts in a ward, so up to 800 images.   What's needed is a source for the street listings in the cases where Ancestry doesn't list them (usually because it consists of multiple polling subdivisions, see Toronto North for many cases like this). If that information was available, a simple text file search is enough to locate all the segments of a street.   It would also be possible to generate an index from these descriptions, there are typos (""toJrvis"") and inconsistent punctuation which make it tricky but using the ""sides"", ""from"" and ""to"" words could get a maybe 90% good-enough index.  But it's still working from partial data.  (further update) The 1895 electoral maps at LAC may help narrow down the search for a place if the names are unfamiliar (and unchanged by 1921), and the parlimentary ridings history will give the actual boundaries and a history of the changes.

333,How to label old photographs?,"I found about 400 old family photographs in a box, most of the displayed relatives can't be identified. I created a spreadsheet where every image will get a line, I’ll add the studio then, the size, the approx. year, the paper that was used, the place of creation, captions, clues and names given to me by other relatives. This will help me to bring images together where I see no link so far (by sorting the columns).  Before I can do this, I want to number the images. Writing on the back wouldn’t work in all cases, because the backsides are partly black (or artworks themselves). I thought about putting adhesive paper dots with numbers written on them on the backs.   How would you make individual images identifiable and sortable for my workflow described above? What is your solution of choice? Do you put every image in a plastic sleeves that is labeled?  Thank you for your answers. "
334,"When archiving photos, what scan quality should you typically import them at?","There are no shortage of things you can do to photos when you scan them in for archival purposes. You can set the scan resolution, the file's DPI, and you can even post process them to enhance them to be more legible or make repairs.  For archiving photos, it seems to me that it makes sense to scan them at a reasonably high quality (front and back), and then store them unadulterated. Should you want to enhance them, you can make copies of them that can be modified.  But at what quality should we scan and store them at? For example, is 600dpi good for a standard 4x6? Does it make sense to scan all photos at 1200/2400dpi instead?  The obvious problems with simply scanning all photos at 1200+ dpi are:   takes considerably longer for the scan to complete (and with hundreds of photos, you'll be sitting there a long time waiting for the scanner, and then waiting for the computer) significantly increased storage requirements   While the resolution is higher the benefits of this seems unclear. Certainly higher resolution images will print nicely as posters for enlargement, but it seems unlikely that 11x15 or higher posters will be printed for 99% of all photos scanned.

335,Transients and New Arrivals in the U.S. 1940 census,"I've been trying to find the 1940 census entry of Sara Katharina Guenther, born 05 Jul 1908 in Homestead, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, USA. She had just arrived back in the port of New York NY on 28 Mar 1940 from a trip to Romania (undetermined length, but likely several months), where she got married to Andrew Bruno Schuller. (Both are now deceased). They were not travelling together as he arrived later, at La Guardia Field on 24 Aug 1940. Both passenger lists reference 1013 Winona Ave, Chicago, Illinois, as destination address.  There are 2 households at that address in Illinois enumeration district 103-3067, on sheet 8A (heads Louis Lavin &amp; Gilbert Bronson), but Sara is not enumerated there (sheet dated April 12). My conclusion is that she was still in transit from New York on April 1. I've tried various combinations of name and birth information to find Sara and have not found her. Either she not enumerated or her entry has been badly mangled in entry or transcription.  Most EDs have a section for transients staying at hotels. I assume that Sara was traveling through by train back to Illinois from New York, and had started but not finished that journey on the official enumeration date April 1. She may have completed her travel before the official date for transient enumeration April 8.  Should she have been enumerated while on the train? If yes, what ED would have been applicable? If she was in Chicago when her address was enumerated (April 12) but the enumerator was informed that she had not been there on April 1 and had been away for several months, how would her information been handled? I've looked at the enumerator instructions, but have not seen this case addressed.   Arrivals on 28 Mar 1940 at New York NY: 3,354 [New York, Passenger Lists, 1820-1957]    33 [New York State, Passenger and Crew Lists, 1917-1973] 433 born USA - 40 born Pennsylvania (like Sara), 24 born Illinois (her destination) destinations are not indexed at ancestry.com  Passenger List, page 26 14 U.S. citizens (2 naturalized) including Sara*: U.S. addresses: 4 Brooklyn NY - Geza Danyi checked, found with parents in Brooklyn in 1940 census 1 New York NY 1 Maspeth NY 3 Philadelphia PA 1 Cambridge MA 1 New Bedford MA 1 Chicago IL* - Sara Gunther not found in 1940 census 1 Detroit MI - Petru Zioman not found in 1940 census  Assuming that some of the Illinois-born might still be resident in Illinois, checked  - the Gillett family (4 persons arriving in NY), found in Kenilworth, Coook, Illinois, enumerated April 2 1940 - Primo Frighetto, found with parents in Chicago, enumerated 12 Apr 1940, 1935 residence was Venice Italy (long absence!)  So Sara could have arrived in Chicago in plenty of time to be enumerated. [I had already considered that she might have visited with relatives in Pennsylvania and Ohio during her trip]. "

337,Connecting with other descendants of ancestors to find place of burial?,"According to my g-g-grandmother's obit, her first husband, Heert Wilms Heerts, died 3 weeks after they arrived (April 1869) in the USA from Germany. It sounds like they were living near Forreston, Ogle Co., IL, when he died. My g-grandmother was the oldest of 3 children, and she was 5 when they immigrated.   I'm really curious about him:   I can't imagine a young couple with 3 young children leaving their homeland if he was not in good health. Even if this was the case, he would have not been allowed into the USA, due to his health. They made it to IL within 3 weeks of landing in the USA--how could they manage that, if he had health problems?   I have found no obituary or tombstone for him, so how do I find out what he died of, and where he was buried? How can I connect with other descendants of his?

In 1871, Mrs. Heerts moved to this county where she   has since resided.      Mrs. Heerts is survived by five children, two sons, Will of Colfax   township and Ed of Stout, and three daughters, Mrs. Yunker [Junker],   of Buck Grove, Mrs. Myers, of Lincoln township, and Wilmke who was at   home.      The funeral was held at 1 o'clock from the Drake church and was   attended by a large number of friends and relatives.   --Grundy Republican (Grundy Center, Iowa), 6 November 1913  It's possible that Jan/John Heerts may have already been established in Iowa, and there may have been a blurb in the newspaper there?  I have wondered if he might have drowned, a tree fell on him while he was building their home, etc. I have not found ANY info on their family--newspapers, tombstones, etc. in the area. I have wondered if there might be a newspaper back in Germany that might shed some light on it, but I have no idea how to go about researching this, since I don't know German. "
338,Interpreting a name on a Genogram (family tree diagram),"I'm here because while recently sorting through some of my deceased grandfather's belongings I came across a partial genogram pertaining to my deceased mother whom was adopted.    She is noted as ""given middle (adopted/maiden) married [AdditionalName]"" now throughout her life she knew she was adopted, but was told little to no information about her biological lineage.  Is it possible this addition name noted in brackets is potentially her Birth name?  What else might the bracketed name mean?  More info:  The diagram is not hand drawn, it is computer rendered but from which software I can not identify. This notation does not appear elsewhere. Not even for her other 3 siblings all of whom were also adopted. The adoption would have occurred in 1949 Massachusetts. As for other conventions - they are fairly basic; Surnames are uppercased, nicknames are double quoted, maiden names are in parentheses. Then oddly there is this one instance of [Additional Name]. "
339,"Is it OK to use the word ""County"" in an American place-name?","My standard for American place-names is ""settlement, county, state, USA"". I have been entering the county names with the word ""County"" or ""Co"" appended, e.g. ""San Rafael, Marin Co, California, USA"". I notice, however, that James Tanner omitted the ""Co"" in a recent post and I suddenly wondered whether I am transgressing any good practice that, from my side of the Atlantic, I've not noticed. (Rather like an American who innocently refers to ""Lancashire County"" - the words ""shire"" and ""County"" are synonymous) So...  Q1 Is there any reason not to use the words ""County"" or ""Co"" for some or all American county names?  Q2 Are there areas of the USA where counties do not, or did not, exist and I should use something else?  Note I don't always follow my own standard - ""San Francisco, San Francisco Co., California, USA"" seems just a touch pointless. "
340,How to find service record of Boston police detective (1945-1968)?,"I have had no luck finding archives regarding Detective Frank (Franny, Francis) Murphy.  As a boy My Grandmother would show me a photo album with page after page of his exploits on and off duty! I was always amazed and have been unable to locate a thing now. The police department said, Do you know how many Francis Murphy's we have had?  I said he was a detective  and he said it did not matter, I recall he was in Roxbury and he was in the SS, secret services? My Father told me Franny was the kind of cop they wrote about, he lived on a boat in Boston and worked as security for a TV/Radio station in 1968 the year he retired and died.    My Mother showed me her album since then but I cannot find the paper I wrote down the names of his partner on.    I read he was very active in crime fighting, it was as if I was reading scripts for a detective TV show! My Father said Franny was well known as was his Mother and sister Mary, all the police knew them and Franny. Franny lived at home with his Sister and Mother when young and My Grandmother said they could go weeks without seeing him come or go, he was hiding his black eyes and stitches etc from his Mother. There was a story where he jumped off a fire escape and broke a guy's leg, another he was at a bar or restaurant and 2 robbers came in and he killed them off duty! There was one where he and his partner were the subject of an all night ride along, The reporter described Murphy as a squat large built person who could instantly move like lightning and was very good with his fists! It was as if his best buddies were reporters and they wrote about his many adventures to the point I assumed some body would recall him, but no. "

342,How can a London prisoner be Reprieved for Transportation.... and then executed?,"I've been trying to trace the steps of a Richard Talent from London, who is rumored to be the progenitor of the Tallants of Anson County, North Carolina.

I haven't been able to find any evidence of another Richard Talant (or any similar last names) in the Old Bailey records or Ordinary's Accounts, so while these accounts are far from complete, the weight of the evidence is that all of these point to the same individual.  The problem is, if this man was reprieved for transportation in May 1697, why would he have then been executed in November 1697? Was it common for someone to be reprieved and then literally ""miss their boat"" and be executed? "
343,Do photocopiers deteriorate photos and documents worse than scanners?,"I think that both deteriorate the originals, but is photocopying worse than scanning?

Often the obituaries have small errors, like wrong town of birth, or year of immigration is off a year. People most often contact me when a name is misspelled, and I say ""that was the way it was published"". Should I say that, or simply correct it? Normally, I like to leave them as they appeared, But lately, I've taken to adding notations, such as below:   Survived by two sisters, Mrs. Kittel [Keitel] of Cincinnati, Ohio, and Mrs. Morse [Morris] of Brownsville, Texas Survived by .... and 2 grandchildren. [Note: John had 22 grandchildren at the time of his death.]   If an obit or article has a paragraph which is totally false or inaccurate, and I omit it for posterity's sake, should I also omit the source citation, as it is a different article now?

However, all the matches point to a common name as our ancestor.    The highest match is 959 over 42 but the person it matches to is 20 years older then me and I think he has to be an uncle. He is not in good shape and cannot answer our questions. Can he be an uncle?    His daughter comes out as a first cousin as does another person related to them.  My third cousin match is also related to what I think is the common ancestor.  The first cousins are around my age and so is the third cousin - just a few years younger then me.    What does it mean?  The family of the names we think we share used to live in the neighborhood I was born in. "
351,What relation is my Half-Aunt to her DNA Matches?,"I have recently discovered through an Ancestry DNA test + GEDMatch that my Aunt is my half-Aunt and that she and my mother don't share the same biological father. Looking at my Aunt's DNA Matches on GEDMatch she has 2 close relatives who we don't know and who aren't a DNA Match for my mother or I. Jacob who shares 503.7 cMs with my Aunt and Jacobs's full biological sister Sophia who shares 347.8 cMs with my Aunt and is also an X-Match with her with total segments: 69.2 cM (36.405 Pct). Jacob and Sophia's X-Match is Total segments = 86.1 cM (45.349 Pct)  I can narrow it down to definitely being on their father's side as they have 4 half-siblings (shared mother) who my Aunt's not a match with. Also, Their paternal grandmother's side has Irish roots which explain my Aunts 42% Irish when my mother and I are 0%. Jacob is 36% Irish.  The relationship calculator says it's most likely Half-Cousin or 1st Cousin once removed but does the X-Match mean anything? I can't add that into the calculator.  Jacob and Sophia aren't their real names.  Update: I added my Aunt's DNA to MyHeritage and it came up that she has a DNA match with 179.7 cM shared. I contacted The match and we found a common ancestor that would make them 2nd cousins once removed (Which is exactly what MyHeritage DNA predicted) if my Aunt's father is Jacob and Sophia's great uncle. If my Aunt's Father is Jacob and Sophia's half Uncle that would make my Aunt's new match and her 3rd Cousins which the DNA calculator says is only a 9.88% chance. I asked the new match to upload their DNA to GEDMatch and they only share 41.1 cM with Jacob and 46.7 cM with Sophia. so I think this new information definitely rules out my aunt being their half-cousin.  The DNA Jacob and Sophia share with the new Match makes it that there’s only a 10-14% chance they're 3rd Cousins which is confusing.  Well, The MyHeritage DNA Match has given me more information on her tree. I can't see the whole thing as it's on private because she's dealing with her own ancestry drama's. The information has raised more questions then it's answered. Her G-Grandmother is called Hannah, she thinks that Hannah's parents are her and my Aunts common Ancestors. But, I don't have them having a daughter called Hannah, I have them having a daughter called Anna born the same year. Which, they could be the same person, but Hannah married Anna's first cousin... I know what people think about small country villages but this would be the first 1st Cousin relationship or anywhere near that I've ever seen while using ancestry, it definitely wasn't as common as people think.   If Hannah was Anna and the MyHeritage DNA Match was my Aunt's 2nd Cousin Once Removed AND 3rd Cousin once removed wouldn't they share more then 179.7cM? "
352,What was the process for getting started with farming in the 1920s in Saskatchewan?,"If Europeans arrived in Saskatchewan with the intention to stay permanently and become farmers, what would the process have been like in 1924? Would they have to wait or be granted land before arriving? "
353,Medical Family Tree - Information to Obtain,"For most people I'm not going to have any information on them.  For anyone with medical information, I find that I'm only going to get the cause of death.  But for those people who I can obtain more detailed information on, like my more immediate family, or when obtaining information on more distant relatives that voluntarily share things...  What kind of information should I be obtaining? I can't seem to find anything that helps to determine this online. Everything I seem to find is the same thing as when you go to the hospital and are asked about certain things that occurred to your immediate family.  Would you consider having an appendix removed an important thing to record?  And what else is there? Is there any type of a questionnaire to help with this? Unless the person tells me ""I had my gall bladder removed"", I'm not going to remember to inquire ""do you have a gall bladder? did you or any close relatives have a problem with gall stones?""  And then what kind of accessory information would be pertinent to record? I'm thinking dates of affliction, time of issue, if it resolved itself...  I usually rely off of genealogical programs to help me with this. When I discovered programs that recorded educational/occupational/occupancy records, I was astounded, and they helped me determine questions to ask. But I can't seem to find any genealogical program that helps index this. "
354,What does 'civil' mean in a location,"Some locations of events are in the form ""civil, minot, androscoggin, maine"".  What does the'civil' in the location mean?    As an example using FamilySearch I have a whole family that has two entries per person.  George Briggs Massachusetts Births and Christenings, 1639-1915  birth: 11 October 1807 BERKELEY, BRISTOL, MASSACHUSETTS father: George Briggs mother: Eunice  as well as  George Briggs Maine Births and Christenings, 1739-1900  birth: 11 October 1807 CIVIL, MINOT, ANDROSCOGGIN, MAINE residence: 1807 Minot, Androscoggin, Maine, United States father: George Briggs mother: Eunice  I have also seen 'CIVIL' for other families I have been researching.

356,Does Cause of death being Convulsions suggest Cholera?,"Not sure if you can help with this. I received the death certificate of my 3rd Great Uncle today. He died on 15th July 1851 in Bulford, Wiltshire, England and sadly was only 14 days old.  I know that his mother was buried on the same day (19th July 1851) but I have not ordered her death certificate yet.  The cause of his death reads:    I think that is saying:     Convulsions 24 hours   Do you agree? I notice that on Ancestry it says there was an epidemic of cholera in the UK during 1851. I don't know if convulsions is a symptom of that? I was hoping his death certificate would shed more light since he died at the same time as mum (or thereabouts).  Update  Just to let you know I received his mothers death certificate today. Her cause of death (on the same day) was:     Puerperal Fever   According to these various links this is related to chilbirth:  Article 1 Article 2  How this fever affects a baby that has been born I can't say. "
357,How do descendants of twins affect DNA matching?,With respect to AncestryDNA matching. Could a child of an identical twin match a first cousin at a half sibling range?  My friend has suspected her grandfather isn't her biological grandfather. DNA is paving the way for her suspicions to be true. Her closest match (901cm) is the daughter of a twin. I am not sure if that matters but have heard it does affect things.   Would my friend match 901 at a higher level due to 901 descending from a twin?  
358,Reducing risk of confirmation bias with DNA test results?,"This is a follow-up question to Using DNA to link individuals after a name change  My cousins and I are pretty sure my great-great grandfather, Everett T Malcom, changed his name when he moved west. We have a compelling theory that his birth name was Mark Ellsworth Templin, and his parents were John Wesley Templin and Jane Stokes. My great-uncle (Everett's grandson) took a DNA test, and it matched with several descendants of John Wesley Templin and Jane Stokes as ""third cousins"", with ""extremely high"" confidence (according to ancestry.com).  My concern is that the DNA testing companies only let me see the trees for people who are genetic matches. There doesn't seem to be a way to find out if there are other descendants of John Wesley Templin who are not matches.   Doesn't this create a significant risk of confirmation bias?   If so, how do I counteract this?   Is there a site that will let me view DNA info for people whose family trees match, instead of the other way around? "
359,What can I deduce from this newspaper extract?,"There is a brief mention of an ancestor in a couple of Staffordshire newpapers:     2 October 1830 DIED John Wright age 24 of Tettenhall late of Kidderminster and formerly of Wolverhampton   In 1828 when he married (in Hanbury, Worcestershire) he was shown as being 'of the parish of Kidderminster'.  In March 1830, when his son was baptised in Wolverhampton, his abode was shown as Wolverhampton.  It looks probable that he was buried in Wolverhampton in October 1830.  Tettenhall or Tettenhall Regis was a small village a couple of miles from Wolverhampton, and there is a candidate baptism for a John Wright in 1805 in Tettenhall. There is another candidate baptism for him in 1810 in Wolverhampton (noting a birth in 1806).  When the newspaper(s) describe him as 'of Tettenhall' is that likely to mean he was resident in Tettenhall at the time of his death? Or that he came originally from there? Or either, or neither? "
360,Private DNA Test Results for Half Sibling,"I have 2 alleged fathers and have recently ruled out one of them with a private DNA test.  I am now trying to determine whether the other is my father but he is deceased, so I am testing with one of his daughters.    We used a Sibling DNA Test and received the results back yesterday, but I don't quite understand them.    How do I determine whether we are a match?    My results show we have: COMBINED SIBSHIP INDEX (HALF-SIBLING): 0.15, PROBABILITY: 13.6%.    Can anyone make any sense of this? "
361,Will half-brother or half-sister DNA provide more relevant info?,"I was adopted and have identified my birth mother. I have 2 half-siblings though her—a brother and a sister. It turns out that my father is either the same as their father OR his brother.   Would my half-brother of half-sister offer a better DNA comparison if I want to figure this out?  In other words, we are possibly full siblings, or we are half-siblings AND cousins at the same time.  And would the difference in shared percentage of DNA be significant enough to differentiate? (i.e. 50% vs 25+12.5=37.5%) "
362,Half-Sister/1st Cousin Shared DNA,I'm curious to know what the shared DNA would be between half-sisters who are also first cousins. If the mother of both sisters had an affair with one of the sister's father's brothers what would the shared DNA look like? Full sisters? would they still share a full X? 
363,Finding place of birth for Martha Hyde Bell of Quebec?,"What I know:   Martha Hyde was born 1822?  Died February 1849 in Quebec.  Martha Hyde married William Bell in 1847 at Saint Paul’s Presbyterian Church in Quebec.  Martha gave birth to my great grandmother, Mary Ann Bell, in May 1848 in Quebec.   Martha Hyde Bell is buried in Barber Cemetery in Quebec.  I know that William Bell was Irish.   William took Mary Ann as a baby to the state of Maryland USA.     Where was Martha born? "
364,What is date of the photo of woman with wrist watch?,"I've got the following photo that I'm trying to identify the woman wearing a diaphanous shawl in it, and thus would like to estimate the date and location of the photo and age of the woman:    The watch might be a good clue to help date it (also note the pinky ring):  When were watches in fashion to wear and does the style of the watch offer any dating information?  Were diaphanous shawls in fashion for photos in Texas?  The annotation written in lower left may help locate the photo:  Do you think KC is Kansas City?  Do you think 14 is 1914 or the number of the photo?  Could the name be the subject or the photographer?  One candidate for the subject is a Mrs. Carroll., but I don't read the writing as quite stating ""Mrs. Carroll"" and maiden Maggie Thorp married Carroll in 1921.  Maggie lived in Irion County, Texas in 1914.  Here is detail of the face:  She looks to be around age 20.  The candidate Maggie Thorp was born in 1894, so she would have been 20 in 1914.  Here is known photo of Maggie Thorp taken around 1921 or after (about age 27 or older) taken with her husband in Bryan, Texas (would they have been professionally photographed before marriage?) (Full photo is here):  Does this appear to be same person, or just a close relative that looks similar?  The photograph portion of the print measures 7.5"" x 9.5"".  The back of the print has this annotation in the upper right corner:  That appears to read ""No 1892"" which I'm thinking is the photograph number for the studio and not the year.  So in summary, does this photo and wrist watch appear to be from 1914 and does the woman look to be 20 years old and match the 27 year old known photo?    Another unknown, possibly of the same family, possibly the same person:   And here is known sister to Maggie, named Gussie married to Mr. Edens:   There are three sisters in this family, the third is Mollie, but I have no photos of her and she died in 1923 at age 27.  She was married to Mr. Raley.  I found this paywalled Ancestry.com yearbook picture that appears nothing like these photographs, very large nose. "

366,Private baptism in one church followed by baptism in another?,"I have definitively identified my ancestor John Charles Wright born circa 1830, but have two conflicting baptism records for him that I need to reconcile.  John Charles Wright maintained all his life that he was born in Kidderminster (which is where his mother was born and where he lived from the early 1830s until at least 1841).  Findmypast (transcription and image) and Wolverhampton History (transcription) show the baptism of John Charles Wright at Wolverhampton St Peter 25 Mar 1830 (a Thursday) with parents John Wright (a druggist) and Maria. Abode is Wolverhampton, and the baptism was carried out by R. Robinson. There is no indication that this was a private baptism.  Another researcher into the same individual was provided several years ago (by a member of the family) with a hand-written transcription of a Copy of Certificate of Baptism for John Charles Wright (annotated by him) that specifies that he was privately baptised in the vestry of St Mary's Parish Church by the Rev Thos. Cook 1830.  The parents are the same, but described as 'of Kidderminster' (or perhaps only his mother is 'of Kidderminster') and associated details confirm that this was the same individual. (I'm not reproducing the transcription in full because it isn't mine to do so; the whereabouts of the original document is not now known).  The copy certificate appears to have been produced in the mid 1860s in support of a property transaction (Worcestershire Archives report that they do not have any deposits from the relevant solicitors, and the solicitors cannot find anything relevant in their own archives.).  There are two witnesses named (which I suspect were witnesses to the baptism and necessary to make it lawful, and not to the production of the certificate copy, as The Clergyman's Manual 1842 seems to suggest that a clergyman could certify a baptism all by himself). One of the witnesses was definitely resident in Kidderminster from 1829/30 (Trade Directory) to 1841 (census) -- very distinctive spelling of his surname plus occupation and seems to have died in 1841, which supports the assertion that he was witness to the baptism not the certificate copy.  Registers do not start at Wolverhampton St Mary until 1843, so I don't believe that can be the church referred to in the Copy Certificate.  The incumbent at Kidderminster St. Mary in 1830 was not Thos. Cook.  I'm having difficulty finding a list of incumbents for St Peter's (which was an awfully complicated ecclesiastical set up), but can't find any other children baptised by a Thos. Cook in Wolverhampton around that time.  I cannot find any other baptisms for a John Charles Wright in the Midlands in 1830 via the usual search sites (Ancestry, Findmypast, TheGenealogist, FamilySearch, FreeReg).  Is it possible that a private baptism in one church would be followed by a public baptism in another, or rather a public acknowledgement that the child had been baptised (as double-dipping was theoretically disallowed, although there was the 'conditional baptism' loophole -- I baptise this child if it hasn't already been done)?  Or that a copy certificate (presumably hand-copied from a register) could be so wrong?   And if it is possible that the private baptism did not take place in Wolverhampton, how might I track it down? It should surely have appeared in a register somewhere.  Or is there an explanation I haven't thought of? Was he really born in Kidderminster? "
367,Conflicting names of ancestor's parents from different records?,"Winnifred Lydia O'Brien  1896–1979  BIRTH 30 OCT 1896 • Stroud, Gloucestershire, England  DEATH 28 NOV 1979 • New Westminster, British Columbia, Canada  I believe I have found my great-grandmother in the 1926 census of the prairie provinces.

She was also found in the death index: Winifred Lydia Fowler, ""British Columbia Death Registrations, 1872-1986; 1992-1993"" [website]As well as in the 1901 England census: [website][website]However, the names of her parents keeps changing in the records.   On her death cert it says Edward O’Brien of Ireland was her father with an unknown mother.  On the 1901 census it says her mother is Norah O’Brien and the head of the household is Edward Goode but it doesn’t say what relation he has to her.  I found a marriage cert that has a marriage between Norah O’Brien and George Edward Goode.   I guess it could be that she didn't take her husband's last name.  "
368,Why might ancestors be missing from 1926 Canadian census?,"My great-grandparents came to Canada from Romania.

369,Missing Enumeration District/Families in the 1920 U.S. Census,"Edit: The enumeration district for Kennady Township was 0017 and 40-19.  I believe there is an enumeration district that was missed in the 1920 census that contains a few of my ancestors and their peers. I am concerned about the Township of Kennady in Le Flore County, Oklahoma.  I'm not sure what the best source is for enumeration district descriptions, but per Ancestry here they are:     The following link provides the 1930 Enumeration District Map for Kennady Township (I could not find the 1920 equivalent):    [website]Note the irregular shape of the township, with the actual town in the southeast corner. A topographical map reveals that a large hill cuts through the township:   I have outlined some of the relevant landmarks/boundaries as best as possible. The regions above and below the yellow line represent township 7 and 6, respectively. The regions east and west of the blue line represents range 24 E and 23 E, respectively.   Cross-referencing the ED descriptions and the 1930s ED map, it appears that T 7 N, R 23 E is missing, along with a considerable proportion of the Kennady Township's population. I have searched the border townships/counties' enumeration district descriptions (again on Ancestry) and could not find T 7 N, R 23 E.   My questions are (in order of importance):   Can anyone confirm this ED was overlooked? Is there a chance that this region was covered and somehow Ancestry/FamilySearch missed the images, meaning the records still exist? Is there a comprehensive list of ED description that I can better search for T 7 N, R 23? Does an equivalent ED map exist for 1920? If not, then why?   This is a brick wall that has plagued my research for nearly a decade. I truly appreciate any insight or ideas on how I should approach this.  "

372,Finding resting place of deceased Leicestershire clergyman?,"I'm attempting to find the burial location of clergyman Edward Brewer Brooks who I know to have died in my house in 1901 (in the UK).  I can trace his entire career through Crockford's Clerical Directory, and I know his last ""assignment"" was in Hoby with Rotherby, in Leicestershire (UK), but I'm struggling to find where he is now. I've gone so far as to wander around all the local graveyards, thinking he might be in some prominant location, but to no avail. (I've also contacted the local council for his last parish, but they were unable to provide much help.)  I've a couple of questions:   When a clergyman dies, are there any conventions as to where he would be buried? Would he always be buried in his most recent parish, or would he be shipped back to his hometown? (I'm considering a parish to be akin to a ""work placement"", but that might be an unfair way to look at it.) Are there any directories that list final resting places of clergymen, as there for detailing their working life. (I'm suspecting not - I'm clutching at straws... )  "
373,Distinguishing half sibling from niece/nephew using AncestryDNA?,"I did the ancestry DNA test and also uploaded my raw data to GEDmatch. I have located two close family matches and I'm wondering how to find out how close we are. Either half siblings or niece/nephew.   TA (male) &amp; I (female) match at 1897 cM with the longest being 195.6 and 49 segments.  RD (female) and I (female) match at 1821 with the longest being 144.7 and 33 segments (we have X-DNA of 196).  We are all adopted and have NO  biological information or ties to the  biological families. TA and RD have no shared DNA. From what we have read, TA is from the paternal side and RD is from the maternal based on X-DNA -- is that correct?   How can we find out if this is a half sibling or niece/nephew/aunt match? "
374,How did two birth records from the same sub-district end up in different districts?,"I have found a curious inconsistency in registration districts for a couple of 1850s English birth records. I was looking for children of David Hill and his wife Jane (nee Harris) of Little Rissington, a small village in Gloucestershire. Little Rissington, like its better-known close neighbour Bourton on the Water, was part of the Stow on the Wold registration district. A search of that district in the GRO indices did not yield all of the entries that I expected. Widening the search, I found a candidate in the adjacent district of Northleach.  The two certificates (GRO PDFs) do look like they come from births to the same couple:      Summaries:    16 Jan 1856  Mary Jane, dau of David Hill and Jane (formerly Harris), Little Rissington     01 Nov 1857  Thomas, son of David Hill and Jane (formerly Harris), Little Rissington     And this is what I find curious: both births are recorded in the ""District of Bourton on the Water"", and the Registrar's District is ""No. 2 Bourton on the Water"". But the earlier one has a Superintendent Registrar's District of ""Stow on the Wold"", while the later one is ""Northleach"".  UKBMD has pages for both Stow on the Wold and Northleach registration districts. The former has Bourton on the Water and Little Rissington parishes in the Stow district from 1837 to 1937, and ""Bourton on the Water"" is also named as a Sub-district. The Northleach page mentions neither village. So it doesn't look like they were ever part of the Northleach district.  The answer to another question about birth registrations states that:     A birth must be registered in the sub-district in which it occurred – the parents did not get to choose which register office to go to.   People couldn't choose their register office on a whim, and I assume that registrars couldn't choose their district on a whim either!  So as I understand it, this situation should not have happened. Both births should have been registered under Stow on the Wold. The boundary between the two districts is not too far from Rissington, and I could imagine David going to a different register office despite the rule given above, but that office still couldn't have listed Bourton as part of Northleach, because it wasn't.    The registrar's name in each case is William Wells, but the writing does not look like the same hand. Similar in places, but with substantial differences particularly in the capitals. I know that a William Wells was a surgeon and registrar who lived in Bourton on the Water, and died there in 1859 , just a few years after this, aged around 60. I have several other earlier records written by him, and the writing all matches the first (Mary Jane) example well. I don't have any other Northleach records to compare, and I don't know if the same Wells was a registrar for that district as well as Stow (if that was even possible).  The writing at the top (Superintendent Registrar's District) is similar on both records but looks a little different from the main text. If so, that points to at least two people involved in the generation of each record.  So I'm wondering how two births apparently registered in the same sub-district ended up assigned to two different registration districts. Is this due to how these records were created? it looks like an error at the registrar's level, rather than the informant or superintendent registrar. (E.g. if the districts shared a registrar, then perhaps he, or an assistant, used the wrong book one time…) Is this likely to be a common error? "

My Uncle (on my Dad's side) surprises me with 0 matches with his haplogroup H3w. Haplogroup H3w is also common for Ashkenazi.    Can anyone explain this discrepancy?  The only thing I know that may be different is that I initially did the mtFull sequence test. My uncle initially did the mtDNA Plus test and then upgraded to the mtFull sequence test. This shouldn't be the cause of this, should it? "
377,What records are available that might contain someone’s blood type?,"What records are available that might contain someone’s blood type?   Blood types can be helpful in determining paternity or non-paternity. Obviously, we would prefer to use DNA tests, but for people who have passed away without being DNA-tested, and especially if they had no (known) children, then blood types could be useful. Blood types cannot prove paternity, but they can disprove paternity. For example, a type-O mother cannot have a type-A child with a type-O father or with a type-B father. The father must be someone with blood type A or type AB.   Blood typing was invented in the early 20th century and was used on a limited basis in WW I and probably wasn’t widely used until the 1930s or 1940s, so it would obviously never be available before that time period.   The records I know of that might have blood type are dog tags and driver’s licenses.   I also imagine that blood type might be on some birth certificates. That won’t help in my research since birth certificates in Georgia, where my family is from, are subject to privacy restrictions, The only ancestor for which you can legally request a birth certificate in Georgia is your parent.   Are there any other likely ways of determining the blood type of deceased ancestors?  "

379,What are the names in this Status Animarum from Slovenia?,"I have a Status Animarum for Mali Cirnik 12 in the Šentrupert parish records stored at Ljubljana diocese in Austro-Hungarian Empire (present day Slovenia).    The third line matches the birth date of Franc Gregorčič of 27 Nov 1839 and has the proper birth location of Mali Cirnik 12.  It appears Mali Cirnik was called Kleinz Zirnik, perhaps in German, during earlier time frame of this record.    I also think that perhaps the č is written as something like zf giving something like Gregorzfizf instead of the more modern Gregorčič or perhaps this is a german spelling?    But then the r looks more like a m to me.  I think the month on the first line is March and written in German as März, but again the r looks very weird.  The wife's first name might be Maria or something close to that.  The bottom person appears to be for an Ursula born 27 September 1808.  What kind of language is this written in and why does the cursive seem so unusual to my eye?  What I'd like to know is what are the names of the father on line 1, mother on line 2, siblings on lines 3-5, and other folks on lines 6-7?    What is the note written on the last line?    Also, what are the months of birth given?    Are these Slovenian or German month name abbreviations?

383,"Which archive holds records for Swiss Guard serving in Naples, Italy or Vatican?","My great-grandmother was born in Naples in 1853 (implied from the age on her British marriage certificate and British census).  On her marriage certificate, her father's occupation is listed as ""officer of Swiss Veterans Naples"".  Their family name is De Sumichrast which I suspect is a Austro-Hungarian name (possibly Slovakian?).  Whilst the the daughter was born in Italy, her parents may be from abroad.  The Swiss Guard are now only to be found in the sovereign state of Vatican City, but back then they were a fighting force deployed across Southern Italy.  So who has the archive records?  The remnants of the Swiss Guard at Vatican City, or the Italian Government?  I need as much details as possible to trace my family back through Naples to the original part of Austro-Hungary.  The Swiss guard's website contact section to send an email from their web page is broken for me.  I'll probably snail mail them but if Stack Exchange users have wisdom might as well tap it. "

386,How to recover information from a well weathered limestone tombstone?,"I have several times now encountered limestone tombstones that are well weathered, as well as sometimes just dirty or have broken and have been face down or face up for years.   There are numerous tutorials on how to and NOT TO clean a limestone headstone without damaging it;   Some of the better guides on cleaning include:   The National Park Services Guide International Southern Cemetery Association   Though when cleaning may or may not do any good, I may not have permission to do so (some older cemeteries have rules not allowing it), or I may not have the time an intensive multi-hour cleaning for when passing through the area.  What are some options for obtaining information from it, preferably without cleaning it extensively and potentially creating further wear?  I am aware of the wax paper and crayon method but have only had mixed success with it actually coming out any more readable.   I would like to have a couple different methods in my kit if I am going to make a trip to visit some areas and cemeteries to attempt to gather more information. I also do not live in a region of the country where these style of tombstones are as aged or as commonly used to experiment.     Is there any other relatively successful way to get information or images from these style of weathered grave stones?   For example, where the bottom is completely unreadable.

387,Finding information on ancestors who lived in the Polish Borderlands (Kresy),"I have been trying to find more information on one of my family lines which is from the Grodno region in present-day Belarus.  A little background information:  My paternal grandfather's line is from Grodno, and that's as much as I can tell you. He was born in Nowosiółki (Navasiolki), and his brother was born in Dorguń (Dorhuń), about 4km from the present-day Polish/Belarusian border.  I have a scanned copy of a shortened copy of his birth certificate, which states his father and mother's names (although I already had that information), and that he was born in Nowosiółki in 1921 (actually 1923, lied to fight in WWII).   Recently, I was given the names of my great-grandfather's parents, thanks to a relative.  I guess my question would be: Where would I start and which government agencies should I be contacting? Polish or Belarusian?  I do not have much past my grandfather, just his parents names and his grandparents names.  "
388,How accurate do late 20th century Genealogical histories of New England in early 19th century tend to be?,"I am sure there is a term or phrase for this sort of publication-- but unfortunately I don't know the correct one!  I have used/referred to ""Christopher Noble of Portsmouth, N.H. and some of his descendants"" (ASIN B0007185P4, 1987) before, and am thus aware of some of it's inaccuracies (or, perhaps, omissions might be more accurate).   I am now researching another part of my heritage, and am searching for the parents of Lucy Pratt Stowell b approx. 1813 in Hingham or Weymouth, Massachusetts.   Her death record lists Stephen Stowell and Lucy (Pratt?) as her parents; however, I cannot turn up a birth record for her (searching online only so far); other family trees  I see note Noah Stowell and Lucy Pratt as her parents. This seems to originate with ""STOWELL GENEALOGY: A RECORD OF THE DESCENDANTS OF SAMUEL STOWELL OF HINGHAM, MASS."", as I cannot find corresponding birth records.  Pro's of this parentage: Lucy Pratt as mother, naming pattern.  Cons: This would make Noah as her father approximately 50 when she was born, Stephen was listed as her father, not Lucy.    I am also suspicious as I can find birth records for all of the other children listed as this couples children, but not Lucy. I have tried alternate birthdate for her, but to no avail.    Additionally, in referring to ""History of the Town of Hingham, Massachusetts"", I see Noah and Lucy as parents of several children (no Lucy Pratt Stowell), including a Stephen, w. name Mary. The wife not born until 1800 and therefore unlikely a mother to my Lucy Pratt Stowell, but possibly this Stephen could be the father of an illegitimate Lucy? To make things more confusing this stephen is not shown as having any children in the Stowell Genealogy book.  My hypotheses:   (a) Noah WAS her father, and the incorrect information was given at death.   (b) Noah was NOT her father, but she was the illegitimate child of one of his children/a member of this family.   Questions:   Can I/should I take/assume the Stowell Genealogy book is accurate?  How might  I go about researching the possible illegitimacy aspect (we have a long history of sex-out-of-wedlock in this family, so it is definitely possible; Lucy's own daughter was married at about 14, while pregnant)  Short of visiting the East Bridgewater, Weymouth, and/or Hingham libraries/town records, what other hypotheses might there be to Lucy's origins, and how might  I go about researching them? (I start with censuses and birth records, but have read East Bridgewater town proceedings to get a sense of why/how Lucy's husband and father-in-law went bankrupt and corresponding disposition of assets, to give some context re what avenues I've explored/am experienced with).

389,"Searching for birth record for Lucy Pratt Stowell b circa 1813 Norfolk/Plymouth Co, MA","As per my original question(s) here: How accurate do late 20th century Genealogical histories of New England in early 19th century tend to be?  I am searching for a birth record for Lucy P. Stowell (N.B. my family generally notes her name as Lucy Pratt Stowell, but I don't believe I've ever seen the ""Pratt"" actually written out on ""official"" records)   According to the records I can find,  she was born in 1813.  The first record I find of her is the intention to marry from January 1832, when she is noted as being 18.  According to STOWELL GENEALOGY: A RECORD OF THE DESCENDANTS OF SAMUEL STOWELL OF HINGHAM, MASS , the Stowells were generally born/lived in Hingham/Weymouth (towns adjacent to East Bridgewater) On Lucy's death record, her parents are noted as Stephen Stowell and Lucy Pratt.  Lucy Pratt was born in Weymouth and then married in and lived in Hingham (married Noah Stowell, father of 2 different Stephen Stowells, one died young) The Stephen Stowell of the right age to be her father was married to ""Mary"" (according to Stowell genealogy book noted above, quick search of town records) and lived  in Hingham.  Lucy is listed as a child of Noah in the Stowell book, but not further date is given about her. I have searched what Hingham materials ARE available online, plus East Bridgewater births, Plymouth County births, and Norfolk County births (all online at either FamilySearch or Ancestry.com) and cannot find a birth record for Lucy anywhere.  I've also searched americanancestors.org but nothing stood out as interesting enough to get me to pay for a subscription :)    I am aware that Hingham records are comparatively (for New England) difficult to tackle, and perhaps the answer lies in those books/visiting Hingham. Short of that (I am currently in California!) does anyone have any suggestions for how I might further research Lucy's birth record? I should also say that her first ""documented"" child was born in 1834, and given family history, I'd be open to considering her as being born as late as 1820, but since I have a marriage intention from 1832 and she was subsequently very consistent about her birthday, I think 1813 is correct (I have searched 1810-1820, though, to be clear).  Specific Records:   Intention of marriage to Joseph Gannet, January 2, 1832, age given as 18 = (calculated) birthdate 1813  (East Bridgewater town records) Marriage to William Holbrook, July 6, 1845, age given as 32 = (calcluated) birthdate 1812  (East Bridgewater) Death in Quincy, 1888, age given as 74 = (calculated) born 1813/1814 (Massachusetts death records as found on Ancestry.com) States and Federal censuses from 1850-1880, all ages given correspond to a 1812-1814 birthdate.   Less Concrete   A cousin of mine (I know, I know, not a ""record"") has noted her birth date as 13 June 1813; he has the family records, which obviously do not include accurate birth information for Lucy :), and access to family graves, which I do not; I've asked him where this super exact birthdate comes from to no avail, but it corresponds with other date, so possibly useful. According to the Stowell Genealogy book listed above, Lucy Stowell who married Joseph Gannet was born in Scituate, Mass., 21 Sept. 1810. In all other records her birthplace is noted as Hingham, and the date is pretty off in comparison. Also, odd that a Lucy Stowell dau of Noah and Lucy Pratt would have been born in Scituate when the family lived in the same home inhabited by Stowells for ~100 years by 1810, and all other children born in Hingham. Additionally, in reviewing Scituate birth records here, I find no mention of any Stowell births.   "
390,Is George Bismark Foster the son of Dr James W Foster and Arabella?,"I've been struggling with finding the parents to George Bismark Foster with a high degree of confidence.  The death certificate for George Bismark Foster shows he died in Crosby, Minnesota on 9 Feb 1946 and was buried in Booneville, Missouri where he had previously lived with his first wife, Anna M. Faught at her death in 1931 and whom he had married in Missouri in 1890.  I have clear records of George Bismark Foster from 1900 onward with evidence supporting all of the following.        1 Jun 1900 — 221 Maple Avenue, Independence, Jackson, Missouri (Census)   1906 — 522 South Main Street, Independence, Jackson, Missouri (City Directory)   1908 — 522 South Main Street, Independence, Jackson, Missouri (City Directory)   19 Apr 1910 — 934 South Main Street, Independence, Jackson, Missouri (Census)   1911 — 934 South Main Street, Independence, Jackson, Missouri, USA (City Directory)   1912 — 934 South Main Street, Independence, Jackson, Missouri, USA (City Directory)   1913 — 934 South Main Street, Independence, Jackson, Missouri, USA (City Directory)   1914 — 934 South Main Street, Independence, Jackson, Missouri, USA (City Directory)   1915 — 934 South Main Street, Independence, Jackson, Missouri, USA (City Directory)   1917 — 934 South Main Street, Independence, Jackson, Missouri, USA (City Directory)   3 Jan 1920 — 934 South Main Street, Independence, Jackson, Missouri (Census)   1921 — Independence, Jackson, Missouri, USA (Newspaper Ad)   1923 — 2729 North Main Street, Hutchinson, Kansas (City Directory)   7 Apr 1930 — 418 1/2 Spring Street, Boonville, Cooper, Missouri (Census)   16 Aug 1931 — Boonville, Cooper, Missouri (Death of Anna)   1941 — Crosby, Crow Wing, Minnesota (Death certificate)   9 Feb 1946 — 211 3rd Street N. W., Crosby, Crow Wing, Minnesota (Death of George)      However, before 1900, things get very murky.  His death certificate shows:        Father: James Foster of no record   Mother: Arbella Bell of Saint Louis, Missouri      My best lead so far, is for his father to be a Dr. James W. Foster married to an Arbella unknown, but this is a messy connection.  I do find a key city directory listing from 1889 in Kansas City that shows a George B Foster who is a clerk at F. Lack &amp; Son with a residence of 517 Holmes that coincides with Dr. James W Foster living at the same address.  George B Foster is also listed in 1888 as working at Kansas City Heat Power and Light Company at 501 Baird Bldg, but no home address is given, while Dr. James W Foster is still listed as residing at 517 Holmes.  The trouble is that George Bismark Foster death certificate shows his date of birth to be 29 May 1869 in Kansas City, Missouri and the 1900 census agrees and shows he was born in May 1869 in Missouri, but the 1880 census for J W Foster and wife Arrabella Foster shows he is only 9 years old on 2 Jun 1880 and thus born around 1871 in Missouri and the 1870 census for James W Foster and wife Arabella Foster shows he is not yet born on 1 July 1870, corroborating the 1880 census giving an 1871 birth.  How can I square these two conflicting pieces of information?  Is the George B Foster born to James W Foster and Arabella my George Bismark Foster or a different person with a similar name?  The spelling of Arbella varies between all the sources and none of the Dr James W Foster sources give her maiden name of Bell as shown on George's death certificate.  I was not able to find any obituaries to add to my stock of information either.  In 1900, George lists May 1869 birth, does it make sense that it could be off by two years when he is only around 30 years old and then consistently off in his death certificate?  Could he have been an illegitimate child and thus hidden from the 1870 census and fudged in 1870 before going back to the truth in 1900?  The middle name of Bismark or Bismarck seems unusual, does it make sense that a physician would pick such a middle name and not someone in a lower trade.  George's businesses were Confectionary, Fuel, Coal, and Grocery, would a son of a physician likely end up in this line of work?  The Dr. James W Foster is my best lead, but I'm at a loss of how to proceed at this point to get a consistent picture.  Please suggest how I might try and move forward at this impasse? "
391,What is relationship of widower to late wife's family (i.e. in-laws)?,"I am a widower.  I still have a strong personal relationship with my late wife's family, and I regard them as part of my own family.  They are blood of my blood in the sense that my children are related by blood to both me and them,  but if we had not had children, that link would not exist.    My only direct relation to them was by marriage, and with my wife's death, it would seem that that bond no longer exists; at least not formally.     Is there any enduring relationship by law or tradition for ex relations by marriage, and what would it be called?   Also, what if instead of death, we had been separated by divorce?    And what if I were to remarry,  would that change my relationship to my first in-laws?    "

393,Genealogy software based on open database format?,"What open format-based genealogy software do exist?  I am making a research about available genealogy programs and I am a bit disappointed with the results. I am seeking tools which are feature-rich, agile and extendable at the same time. The main requirement for me is format in which app stores genealogy records. It should be open, extendable (e.g. XML-based) and have high-performance (for handling 100 000+ records). Having reviewed genealogy market I didn't find worthy alternatives. The main candidates which meet my requirements are:   GRAMPS (Berkeley DB) RootsMagic (SQLite 3) GeneWeb (text)   Actually, GeneWeb is not fully complies with my requirements as its format is plain text. And the prime cause of my GEDCOM abandonment and drifting towards openness is that GEDCOM, as other text formats are often ambiguous and could be inconsistent, which means different apps interpret it in a different ways. Nevertheless, let it be for the sake of completeness.  In spite of embedded DB (SQLite) in RootsMagic, there is no explicit advantages in it. Moreover, I was completely discouraged by the RootsMagic feature lack, it even have no out-of-the-box export capability except GEDCOM!   Actually, I was overwhelmed with the range of available open-format software, it is inexcusably small! What are the alternatives to the above 3 apps? Web-based engines (like Webtrees) are also appreciated. "

395,Finding residence information for Toronto in the 1840s?,"I am trying to fill out the timeline of tailor George Hindley, his wife Ann/Hannah Drake, and their family between 1841 and 1847.   A rough timeline of the family can be seen by putting some of the collected historical records that are likely to belong to the family in chronological order:   about 1818 According to Hannah's entry in the Williamstown, Massachusetts town records (see below) she was born in Sheffield, England, the daughter of Jonathan Drake. (Birth date estimated by FamilySearch website.) about 1819 According to George Hindley's entry in the Massachusetts town records (see below), he was born in Sheffield and his father's name was Samuel (no mother's name is given, and the field for the birthplace of his parents is blank). (Birth date estimated by FamilySearch website.) 6 June 1841 an Ann Drake and a George Hindley are enumerated in the same 1841 Census household on Bailey Street in Sheffield (HO107/1338/4/23/2); Ann is from Yorkshire; George (tailor) is Not from the County August 1841 from MARRIAGES in Sheffield Independent, 14 August 1841, page 5:        On Sunday last, at Upper Chapel, by the Rev. B. T. Stannus, Mr. George   Hindley, tailor, to Miss Hannah Drake. (I do not have the records from the non-conformist church register yet.)   This is consistent with the Q3 Marriage Registration for George and Hannah in SHEFFIELD    Registration district Volume 22 Page 448 (the marriage estimated to be between late June - September of 1841).   The GRO certificate records a marriage which took place at Upper Chapel on 8th Aug 1841, solemnized by B.T. Stannus. It says George Hindley, tailor, of full age, is the son of Samuel Hindley, shoemaker.  George's residence at time of marriage is Rockingham Street.  Hannah Drake, of full age, daughter of Jonathan Drake, Joiner (?), residence at the time of marriage is Broad Lane.  Witnesses are J. Bridgeford and May Butler; the registrar is Benjamin Kidmore.  (I have not identified the witnesses or their relation to the couple.)   1844 5 Feb eldest son Samuel is born in Toronto, Canada (at the time, part of York County), according to Samuel's 1884 Naturalization petition or ""second papers"" from the Superior Court at Pittsfield Massachusetts in Berkshire County.   1845  Probable date of entry of the family to the United States.  Samuel's Petition for Naturalization asserts that he arrived in North Adams in 1845.  While the area has been settled since 1745, North Adams was not incorporated under that name until 1878 (it was previously the northern part of the city of Adams).  Williamstown is to the west.    1846 (calculated) Albany, New York: birth of daughter Mary Jane (date from Williamstown, Massachusetts town records, from her 1904 marriage to her second husband, Charles E. Ormsbee); her 1900 Census record gives her birthdate as Jan 1846 but lists her birthplace as Massachusetts 1850 The family is enumerated in Adams, Berkshire County, in the US Federal Census 1855 The family is enumerated in Williamstown, Berkshire County, in the Massachusetts State Census.  1856 30 Jun Hannah (Drake) Hindley entry no 23, Deaths Registered in Williamstown aged 38 years 2 months (no days recorded).  Another important waypoint for the timeline is July 1, 1867, the date for Canadian Confederation -- well after the Hindley family is in the US. 1885 06 Nov entry 233 Deaths Registered in the town of North Adams, Massachusetts (Berkshire County): George Hindley, tailor, resident of North Adams -- dies age 66 (no months, days are recorded).     I have many other records for the family's residence in Williamstown and Adams, before Samuel eventually moves to North Adams; he is listed in the North Adams City directories starting in 1876.  In her webinar Find Your American Ancestor Using Canadian Records, presented at the Minnesota Genealogicial Society, Kathryn Lake Hogan suggested several categories of records which might be productive to search:   Maps Immigration Land Records Vital Records Employment Records stories about people visiting e.g. in Newspapers Military Records   Not all of these categories apply for this particular time period.   For example:   Immigration records -- The first set of passport indexes available on Find My Past start in 1855. Canadian passenger lists (for the England to Canada leg of the journey) begin in 1865, well after the family was already in the US.  Outbound passenger lists from England start even later, in 1890.  Border crossing records from Canada to the USA did not begin until 1895. A surname search (using the search terms Hin*, Hen* and Han*) did not find any Hindley families or likely variants in the Library and Archives Canada pre-1865 Immigrants to Canada online searchable index.  Naturalization Records -- All of the known children except for Samuel were born in the USA.  Samuel's Petition for Naturalization is dated ""the fourth Monday of October 1884"".    Clues to Naturalization can be found in the US Federal Censuses for 1870. Both the 1865 Massachusetts State Census and the 1870 US Federal Census records which I believe belongs to Samuel's father George Hindley have tick marks in the column for ""Citizen of US"", but I have not found Naturalization papers for him so far. (Only District Court naturalization records for Berkshire County are online; the local court records for the county are on microfilm.  There are no good candidates in the New England Naturalization Index.)  In the June 1863 Civil War Draft Registrations, the remarks say ""Claims Alienage"" so that places George's Naturalization after this draft record but before Census day in 1870 (assuming both records are accurate, which may not be the case).  So my records wishlist / to do list, so far, is:   find George Hindley's Naturalization papers, if any exist, to see what they assert about the family's date of entry into the United States check land records around Toronto (just in case) and find something about Samuel's birth from local records in Toronto. (Ontario Civil Registration does not begin until 1869.) There are land records and newspaper indexes of births on microfilm, listed in the Family History Library Catalog. Look for information about church affiliation, to see if I can find church records.  E.g. I do not know if the family is connected to Rev. W. J. Hindley of Toronto (and Winnipeg in 1915). the hideously unspecific look for whatever I can find in newspapers, city directories, travel guides, and other records.  I'll start with the FamilySearch Wiki's article on Ontario Genealogy and the Family History Library Catalog, but pointers to little-known resources about Toronto would be appreciated. Identify the witnesses on the marriage certificate of George Hindley and Hannah Drake from Upper Chapel; order the records from Upper Chapel from the archive (in Sheffield).   At the moment, I don't have any information about George Hindley and Hannah Drake's siblings, and I haven't done FAN club research to see if I can find more pointers back to Toronto or other parts of Canada.  This is something I'd like to explore as I find out more about the family's time in Canada.

In some cases, they have used their middle name as their first name, in others they have seemingly just picked a name that they liked and used that instead.  This obviously causes havoc in research, with birth and marriage records not matching the name others in the family remember them as.

One of the answers said that a search of the town's records yield better results.  At least one of the collections listed in that answer is available only at the Family History Library; the others (if available) would have to be ordered and sent to my local FHC.  Before I do so, I would like to work up a research plan (see Are there checklists or templates made for visiting the Family History Library in Salt Lake City?), so I can stay organized while I search these records.  For example -- for the town I'm interested in, the Family History Library Catalog has the following entries:   The Melderegister 1875–1917 or Resident population register consists of 21 separate films, many of which are in the vault, so if I were to take a trip to the FHL, they would have to be ordered in advance.   Heimatsangelegenheiten, Ausländerausweisung, Ehen im Ausland, etc. 1835-1937 has 12 rolls The Bürgerbücher, Steuerregister, Arbeiter, etc. 1664-1938 are a bit more manageable (four rolls).   Heimatscheine Werdau und Umgebung : 1835-1875 (Index to certificates of origin for Werdau and vicinity, including name, birth date, place of origin, date moved, occupation, etc.) is on CD-ROM and can be used at the FHL in Salt Lake City.     From J. Mark Lowe's webinar “Ready-Set-Plan! Developing a One-Step Research Plan,” I understand the basic process of breaking down the research process into individual questions and steps.  Lowe's goal is to have a set of tasks so specified that you can hand them off to a helper to execute (not unlike writing a good question for G&amp;FH.SE).  What I'm struggling with is the problem of how I can make a checklist for myself when I haven't seen the records yet, and don't have a list of what information is likely to be found in them.  I can make up a list of people's names I want to look for in the database, and a list of surname variants, but each new discovery will generate more To Dos.  What is a good strategy for working through a set of microfilms like this?  How do you make an exhaustive search and minimize the chance you will need to re-order the same film again and again?    The entry for Werdau in the online Meyers Gazeteer is: Werdau 2) Werdau, Zwickau, Zwickau, Sachsen.  I also need to look for records held in the other jurisdictions.    Update to address a point made in the comments: I have taken (and recommend) the classes given by webinars from the Family History Library's International Team on reading Old German Script.  Recordings of those classes are available in the Learning Center.  "
399,Seeking 19th century marriage record for Wolf and Amélie Thalmann whose descendants settled in Mannheim?,"Richard (1861-1938, died in Paris, France) from the Thalmann family of Mannheim (in south-west Germany) had about four siblings:   Ernst (founder of Ladenburg-Thalmann Bank in NYC in 1875), Flora (later Rosen), and two(?) others.    The parents were, according to Richard's marriage records (Paris, c. 1894) named Wolf and Amélie, although this may be a francophonisation.  How could I find a marriage record for Wolf and Amélie? "
400,How were the beneficiaries of the 1872 Will of Mary Rogers related?,"My fourth great grandmother was Elizabeth Crawley, born 1791, probably in London. She married William Stretch in 1819 in Whitechapel. The witnesses to their marriage were D. Rogers and Mary Rogers, who I think are Demetrius Rogers and his wife Mary. Demetrius married Mary Crawley in 1810 in St Mary Islington. I suspect that Mary and Elizabeth were sisters, but I cannot yet prove it. And that's really the heart of this question: how were Mary and Elizabeth related? And can I get back to Elizabeth's parents, who are as yet unknown?  (My apologies for any confusion in the text below. There are several each of Mary, Elizabeth, Penelope etc: nominative innovation was not a family tradition. I've tried to make it clear enough by including surnames for most; where surnames are missing they are the principal actors from the opening paragraph.)  After Demetrius died in 1850, Mary lived alone for a while, and later with Elizabeth's descendants (Richard Hill and family) until her own death in 1871. In her will, Mary left a reasonable legacy, ""effects under £4000"". Much of that was probably inherited from Demetrius, who had left her ""public stocks and funds"", among other assets.  The principal beneficiaries (with equal shares of ""two thousand pounds new three pounds per cent annuities ... and the dividends interest and annual proceeds arising and accruing therefrom"") of Mary's will were Mary Elizabeth Hill (my 2nd great grandmother) and her sister Penelope Hill. Mary's will refers to them as her ""nieces"", and also as the daughters of Richard Hill and her ""niece"" Penelope (Stretch) Hill, so they were actually her grand-nieces (I assume that such distinctions were unimportant). That might suggest that Mary and Elizabeth were sisters, but Mary also left money to other ""nieces"" and a ""nephew"", who certainly were not descendants of William and Elizabeth. The pre-eminence of Mary Elizabeth Hill and Penelope Hill might support that direct sibling relationship, or may simply reflect that Mary had lived in the girls' home and been close to them since their birth.  Mary also left some money to Demetrius Stretch and Matthew Stretch, William's sons from his second marriage, but she does not describe them as ""nephews"". This confirms, I think, that she relates to the family through Elizabeth Crawley, and not through William Stretch.  I have managed to trace back all of these nieces and nephews, each reaching a Crawley ancestor somewhere around London in the 1780s-90s. So it's likely that they all are blood relatives of Mary somehow, rather than in-law relatives. But what I haven't been able to do is connect those Crawleys together. Records at this time (mostly pre-1820) are somewhat scarce, after all. (Sadly, I have failed to connect them to the Downton Abbey Crawleys too, but that is perhaps less surprising.)  The main named beneficiaries were:   Mary Elizabeth Hill (niece) Penelope Hill (niece, sister of Mary Elizabeth Hill) Elizabeth Tucker (niece, widow of William Tucker, Coachsmith) Phoebe Hales (niece, wife of Joseph Hales, Silversmith) Mary Ann Allen (niece, wife of Thomas Allen, Silversmith) William Williams (nephew)   This is what I have so far. Individuals in red boxes are primary beneficiaries in Mary's will, while those in blue boxes are otherwise mentioned (relative, executor, minor benefits, forgiven debts etc). The green boxes appear to be a common generation of Crawleys. Some dates are approximate, and only relevant individuals are included.    As you can see, all of the beneficiaries descend from Crawleys of a similar age: Mary, Elizabeth, Phoebe and Lydia. Phoebe did her best to muddy the waters by marrying three times. For Mary to refer to the red individuals as nieces and nephews strongly suggests that they are part of the same extended Crawley family. The implication (and my assumption) is that Mary, Elizabeth, Phoebe and Lydia are all related as siblings or cousins. The only entries I have found for the previous generation are Phoebe's parents John Crawley and Penelope Lunt. The four could all be John Crawley and Penelope Lunt's daughters, but I can't find records to (dis)prove it. The use of the uncommon name ""Penelope"" for Elizabeth's daughter is somewhat suggestive but circumstantial. The age gaps of ~8 years between Lydia, Mary+Elizabeth and Phoebe are large, but not implausible.   So my question is, what should I be looking for next, to try to link these four Crawley women (Mary, Elizabeth, Phoebe and Lydia) together. I've looked on FamilySearch, Ancestry, FindMyPast and TheGenealogist, and not yet found anything to connect them to each other or to a previous generation. For clarity, I can't find any birth/baptism record for Lydia Crawley, and there are multiples for Elizabeth and Mary but none that I can select with confidence.  I can accept that the current state is enough to demonstrate familial relationships, but I'd really like to find Elizabeth's parents - that's been a roadblock for years now, and this is the first time I've had any real insight into the Crawley family.    As an aside, Mary's will primarily benefitted female relatives, and explicitly states that the funds      ""shall not be subject or liable to the debts, controul or engagements of any husband or husbands she or they may hereafter intermarry, but that the same shall be for her or their own separate and inalienable use and benefit, and her or their receipt or receipts alone to my said trustees notwithstanding her or their coverture"".   That's basically legal-speak for ""hers and hers alone"".    (My transcription of the will is here, for anyone who really enjoys ploughing through Victorian legalese.)  On first reading, this seemed (to me) rather progressive for the time, albeit acknowledging that coverture could override Mary's wishes. On further reading, there had been campaigns against coverture (the right of a husband to most of the wife's assets, ultimately because she was not legally considered a separate entity after marriage!) since at least the mid-19th century. The Married Women's Property Act of 1870 finally allowed married women to be the legal owners of earned and inherited money, thereby negating much of coverture. That was enacted after Mary's will was written (1867), but before it was proved (1872). And there was clearly a great deal of social pressure leading up to that Act, so Mary's intentions were at least up-to-date, rather than futuristic. Even so, I wonder how typical such wording was at the time. I found this an interesting little insight into a Victorian social transformation.  "

402,Did Somerset Militia recruit local Cornish soldiers when based at/near Truro around 1798?,"Finding late 18th Century service record of soldier William Hobbs in Somersetshire Militia? was a question about my 4th great grandfather William Hobbs who married Jane Courtenay at Truro St Mary, Cornwall, England in 1798.  In that question, which was focussed on finding Somersetshire Militia records for William, I wrote:     I am not yet confident that I have the correct christening for   William.  I have a current leaning towards the one below on which his   mother's name is given as Betty Hobbs (no father mentioned), and   William and Jane named their second daughter Betty.      ""England Births and Christenings, 1538-1975,"" index, FamilySearch   ([website]  2014), William ... Hobbs, 12 Mar 1762; citing Ditcheat, Somerset,   England, reference Item 21; FHL microfilm 1526603.   I have now realized that this candidate baptism was mainly chosen based on a naïve assumption that someone in the Somertsetshire Militia would probably have been born in Somerset.  However, in Ancestry.com's Cornwall, England, Militia and Sea Fencibles Index, 1780 - 1831 which is from Cornwall Record Office; Truro, Cornwall, England; Cornwall Militia; Class Number: P236/15/1, I have just found two records that look like they may belong to the same William (and Jane) Hobbs:        Name: William Hobbs, Birth Place: Truro St. Mary, Military Year: 1810, Military Place: Cornwall, England, Unit or Occupation: 3rd.   Regt. Local Militia, Spouse: Jane Hobbs, Number of Children: 3,   Status: Substitute, Notes: Paid 6s. per week for 4 weeks   Name: William Hobbs, Birth Place: St Mary Truro, Military Year: 1810, Military Place: Cornwall, England, Unit or Occupation: 3rd Regt   Militia, Spouse: Jane Hobbs, Number of Children: 3, Notes: 6/- per   week      I think these are highly likely to belong to my ancestor William Hobbs because:   they have the correct name for his spouse they have the same birthplace for him as where he was married (Truro St Mary) they have the same occupation (serving in a Militia) they record 3 children when the expected number in 1810 would be 3-4:   William (1798-1859) Eliza (1801 - ?) - perhaps deceased by 1810 Elizabeth (1804-1869) Matthew Courtenay (1808-1811) Matthew Courtenay (1811-1894) - not yet born in 1810 Jane (1815 - ?) - not yet born in 1810    The only lingering doubts in my mind are whether:   a soldier born and living in Cornwall would be a likely recruit for the Somersetshire Militia while based there around 1798 a soldier in the Somersetshire militia in 1798 would be likely to find his way into the Cornwall Militia by 1810   I think both are plausible, and am wondering whether a service record involving a switch of militias has been observed previously?    In the National Archives there are two records that clearly belong to the same William Hobbs.  Both indicate that he had left the Somersetshire Militia by 1802.  The first from Sessions held at Lostwithiel names his father-in-law Matthew Courtenay and informs me about the occupations of both at 13 Jul 1802:     QS/1/7/173   William Hobbs of Truro, brickmaker to appear, and his   surety Matthew Courtenay of Truro, woolcomber.   The second Sessions held at Bodmin names his wife as Jane (nee Courtenay) and also Jane's sister Philippa.  It indicates that William would be spending the next 12 months at Bodmin Bridewell (presumably not the former Bridewell Palace).     QS/1/7/190, 191   William Hobbs, lab., Philippa Courtenay, spinster,   and Jane, wife of W.H., all of Truro, indicted for assault on William   Jolly: Jane Hobbs acquitted. P.C. fined 1s. paid in court and one   month in house of correction.

404,How do I visibly make people aware that a connection is only tenuous and further research is needed?,"Is there some sort of standard or accepted manner in which to indicate that an ancestor's connection to your family line is not fully supported. YET! That it is still in research mode. I'm thinking a symbol in front of the fact in question eg name/DOB/parent's names etc.  I know you can have your sources, but sometimes you can have some sources for that individual but still not know if they are indeed family. This becomes a problem when you add them to your online tree to allow further research and then someone comes along and just blindly copies what you have down as fact. Then someone else copies them, and very soon you can only find matches and hints to information that you added originally.  So is there some sort of symbol you can put in front of a person's name that will be understood by everyone to mean ...'oh, this is just a research possibility!'??   A load of question marks make it look messy, but I will happily continue using question marks if that is all there is.  However, sometimes the name, eg John Smith, is correct but it is the individuals parent's that may or may not be your John Smith's parents! How would you indicate that the name John Smith is definitely correct. That the parent's name of a John Smith are correct but the John Smith and parents that you have found may not necessarily be for your John Smith. In an upfront, at a glance, sort of manner?  Or should I just avoid linking my 'possible' research to my online tree.   Well in that case, I can't find any documented proof that my gran was ever born! She died, but she was never born. Should I remove my entire maternal line from my tree?!   This is just  general example, I have plenty of evidence she existed and I have christening records for her sister, so I can positively connect to ancestors further down the line. But if this was a less recent ancestor - such certainty with little to no linking documents is a lot harder to justify. And if you get it wrong, the mistake propagates across the internet as fact.  I'm not looking for myself as I am well aware of how researched my connections are. This is more for preventing the research being taken as fact by other users, who do not look for sources or read any notes. "

406,"Understanding meaning of professions in 19th century Calabria, Italy?","This is not a pure Italian translation issue, it looks, after investigation and discussion with Italian native speakers, a question more related of how professions are recorded in Calabria (or whole Italy?).  The question is related to a record from the 19th century located in Calabria. I do not know if the registers are in Italian or are in Calabrese (notice during that period Italian unification happened, so each country was having a different language/dialect).  I have noticed that several registers include Italian adjectives as professions, more concretely the professions ""civile"" and ""legale"" (which translates to civil and legal in English).   What do ""civile"" and ""legale"" mean exactly in English as professions? How are professions recorded in Italian (Calabrian) records?  "

Three of the children -- Alfred Robert, Ellen Beatrice, and Walter Thomas -- appear on the same page of a baptism register in Ancestry's collection UK, British Army and Navy Birth, Marriage and Death Records, 1730-1960.    These are at the bottom of a page.  I checked the following page but did not find any other Clarke records. (See the answer for the index page that points to these records.)

The post card was never sent and there is no identifying material on the back other than a stamp box:    which this website suggests was used on postcards made by K Ltd between 1918 and 1936 -- perhaps this is the manufacturer of pre-printed photographic paper (Kodak Ltd?)

412,Did General Winfield Scott have any grandchildren?,"I am trying to either disprove, or find evidence for, an old family story. According to my deceased grandfather, Winfield S Burns (1911-1982), the first male son has been named Winfield Scott in honor of General Winfield Scott (1786-1866) since the mid 1800s. He was supposedly an indirect relation.  The first direct relative I can find with the name is Winfield S Camus (Burns) (b. 1850), who apparently changed his name to his wife’s surname (Mary Burns b. 1848) after the birth of their first son, my great grandfather, Winfield S Burns jr. (b. 1888).  I can find no record of Camus in the US records 1850-1880; he only shows up in the 1910 census when he is already 60 years old.  General Winfield Scott had 2 marriages:  Lucy Baker (1789-1816) (at West Point, NY), with whom he had 3 surviving sons:  Winfield D Scott, Winfield Scott, and Henry Scott  And Maria de Hart Mayo (d. 1862) in Virginia, with whom he had 3 surviving daughters:  Cornelia, Camilla, and Marcella  I cannot find  any marriages for any of these children in FamilySearch and Ancestry.  Does anyone know if any of the Scott children had offspring who were possibly linked to the Camus in the 1800s?    After examining the original documents, it appears that the entry for ""Camus"" may have been an error on Ancestry.com. The comments below will be considered the answer. "
413,"Does a bequest of $1 or ""to be paid on their demand"" mean it is a minor child?","I'm looking at the Will of Zebulon Tharp dated October 1, 1775.  On page three it appears as follows:    Starting at line 8, it reads in part:     ...I also will and bequeath unto my son   Benjamin Tharp the sum of one dollar and unto my son Ze   lan the like sum of one dollar to be paid on their demand after   decease...   A librarian told a friend of mine that this means the two that got $1 were minor children at the time.  One may not wish to bequeath land (like the other four sons get 120 acres each in this will) to a minor child and to avoid issues later, you name the minor explicitly by giving them one dollar.  Alternatively, does the phrase to be paid on their demand mean they are minor children?  Is this correct, can we infer that at the time the will was created that Benjamin was a minor?  Can anyone provide evidentiary support for this practice in the literature?  Or does this just mean the father preferred the other sons? "
414,Reconciling DNA results against what is known of father's (half-German) ancestry?,"I am unsure of who my father is (was).   The man I was told was my father is now deceased. His mother was born in Mannheim, Germany and she came to the US after the war. She had my dad which would have made him half German.  I did a DNA test through ancestry.com and received my results yesterday and I have 0.00% German heritage.   Does this mean that this man is not my father?   The test said I descended from Great Britain at 76%. Can anyone tell me what this means in further detail? Or if I should start looking somewhere else? "
415,What is FTDNA's Chromosome Browser showing for the X chromosome?,"FamilyTreeDNA's Chromosome Browser shows segment matches on each of the 23 chromosomes with up to 5 people at once who are represented by different colors.   Technically these are half-matches because each chromosome has two halves and either half of one person may match either half of the other person.  The 23rd Chromosome is made up of an X and Y chromosome for males, and of two X chromosomes for females. The Y chromosome is not part of the autosomal results, but the X is.  In the Chromosome Browser, the 23rd Chromosome is shown like this (with segment matches of two people superimposed, one in orange and one in blue):    I would have thought that one X would have been shown for males, and two X's for females, but only one X is shown for both males and females.  My question is what is the browser actually showing?  Is it showing any half-matches between either chromosome with the third person?    Let's say the Person is male and the orange lines represent matching segments with another male. This one is simple and it works like any other chromosome and the orange lines show any half-match between the person's one X chromosome and the other male's one X chromosome.  But what is it showing if the person is female having two X chromosomes, and/or the other person is female having two X chromosomes. Is it doing a quarter-match or an eighth match because there's 2 or 4 combinations of X's to half-match?   i.e. If any segment of either of a female's X chromosome half-matched the same segment of either of another female's X chromosome, would that half-match always show up in the Chromosome Browser? "
416,Puzzling Swiss/French date abbreviation?,"  Does anyone know what the capital 'I' might represent in this date? There is no French month that begins with 'I', and the document uses numbers for months as well as spelled out month names interchangeably. I've found every month written somewhere in the document, so I couldn't figure it out by process of elimination. The document is a pedigree chart prepared by a genealogist at the Fribourg Archives in Fribourg, Switzerland in 1936, and there are many dates where this 'I' represents a month. The pedigree chart's information seems to be derived from church records, if that's a clue.  I'm baffled! Any guesses?  "
417,How soon after birth would Roman Catholic baptism normally occur in early 18th century Germany?,"In Germany during the 18th century (esp. early 18th century), how soon after birth would baptism commonly take place? Of course it wasn't the same for every child, but was there some sort of usual time frame to be christened? Was there a specified time frame by the Church or by the government for the parents to baptize their child? I am asking specifically about the Roman Catholic Church.  "
418,"What could an ""X"" under 'Spouse's Previous Husband's Name' mean?","In this marriage record on FamilySearch, there is an ""X"" for 'Spouse's Previous Husband's Name'. What makes this significant is that the groom, Daniel Gebhard(t?), might have been married twice. If the X has any meaning, it could shed some light on whether he was actually married twice and how the first marriage ended, among other information.   My first thought was that it could be a 'N/A' type mark. However, after finding the death certificate, I'm starting to think it might have been to protect privacy or something else. What could the X mean? "
419,"What is the significance of the character ""j"" at the end of a Roman Numeral?","While using an old (1907) book of transcriptions (on-line) The Parish Register of Gargrave in the County of York , I was puzzled by the number of dates recorded in the 16th and early 17th centuries that could be read easily as Roman numerals except for the addition of a j at the end.   The pattern (if there is one) seems to be that if the number would ordinarily end with i then j is appended, but if it ends with v or x then there may be no extra character before the ordinal superscript (but in one case, there is!).  I thought this may be a style quirk of a particular clerk, but now I am seeing it in other sources (but all Yorkshire based and pre-1700, because that is what I am reading at the moment).   Is this a real phenomenon or just a coincidence? How widespread was the practice? What on earth did it mean? Why did they do it?  "

Git  Git (best known on hosted sites like github and bitbucket, but available as a command-line or graphical application on most platforms) is a way to store (mostly) text and programming source files, so that changes to individual lines within the files can be made by different people in different places, and merged together with a full audit trail of who changed what (called ""blame"").  It's also possible to split data off into a branch, make proposed changes to it, and then submit it back to those responsible for the main branch as suggested improvements, which can be accepted or rejected, and merged back into the main branch.  So it's not a free-for-all like a wiki, there are ways to have control over data yet still accept improvements.  It seems it would make a good fit for genealogy source data, which is often text-based (perhaps with images attached).  It would make it easy for transcriptions to be added to and corrected by many people, and more importantly, see who changed it.  It could also be a way to store assertions, and provenance trails - show how a conclusion was reached, in a format that allows corrections and new data.  Existing projects  There are projects around to store gedcom data in git (example: git-ged), which is one way of handling legacy data, but I'm thinking it would be more useful for newer standards that are source-based, rather than just for conclusion reporting formats like Gedcom.  Many of the new standards like Gedcom-X are XML-based (perhaps with an alternate json representation).  Neither XML or (to a lesser extent) json map well to a line-based version control system (because it can be hard to retain the structure when a individual lines are changed by different people at the same time).  It's also difficult for a human to edit those formats.    Although gedcom is line based it again has a structure that is easy to mess up with multiple editors, and has other limitations (lots of cross-references that are easy to break).  Extending Git  Git (and github) have been extended to display data in different ways, for example to map the data if it is in geojson (a geographic point/line format), or to show tables if it is in csv.  So there could be certain requirements (restrictions) of a text-based genealogy format that would make it possible to generate reports from it.  It doesn't have to be directly usable in a program, just something that can be edited by multiple people in a fairly easy way.  CSV  For source data (lists of events, simple transcriptions) it's maybe simplest just to stick to csv (comma separated variables) files, that can be easily imported (and exported) by  most software.   It would be good to have a csv description language with a genealogy vocabulary that describes the data.  The simple data format is one such way to describe csv files.  Has anybody been working on marking up genealogy source files with a system like this?  Open Data  Much of this assumes that the source data (events) are in a format which is shareable (and so editable by many).  Unfortunately very little data currently has suitable licenses, but that is changing. "
421,What Island is likely to be mentioned on 19th Century Somerset Will?,"Today I obtained the 1836 Will of my 4th great grandmother Martha Chichester (nee Noake) who lived in Old Cleeve, Somerset, England.  She mentions two sons living at an Island of ?????? which I am guessing will not be too far away.    Does anybody know what the name of the Island is that is written twice at the end of the third and sixth lines in the graphic below?   "
422,Working with autosomal DNA results,"I have the automsomal DNA results for myself, 3 full sisters and 1 half-sister. We all share a mother, and we all tested with familytreeDNA. Our results are uploaded to gedmatch.com.   Our parents are all deceased, as are their parents. We have no first-cousins (on our mother's side) and no co-operative first cousins on our father's side.  How best can I triangulate or phase using the data I have, to work with DNA matches to narrow down the lines on which we match?  I'm assuming that somebody who doesn't match my half-sister but matches me and/or some of my full-sisters is probably a match in my fathers side. And somebody who matches me or one of my full-sisters plus my half-sister is probably a match on our mother's side.  Given the geography, my mother and father are unlikely to have been related.  Is there anything else I can deduce? "
423,How to record a stillbirth as a genealogical event?,"There are differing legal definitions of the term “stillbirth” in different jurisdictions and also modern registration of these sad events differs from country to country. As a genealogist you encounter stillbirths e.g. as “stillborn son” or “stillborn daughter” in the birth section of church records. Details on the circumstances of the birth are in the majority of cases not available.   At least in the German-language area such stillbirths can be marked with the symbol †* in conventional family trees.   I wonder what is best practice to records stillbirths in family tree software? The child never carried a name. Should I enter ""stillborn son"" like in church records in the first name field? Is it a good idea to add the parent’s surname to the correspondent field to sort the stillbirth among other family members? Should I set the birth and death date to the the day the death child was born, although it might have died earlier and wasn’t born alive? How should I distinguish the entry of a stillbirth from the entry of a child that was born alive and died on the same day, without christening and thus without a name as well? With a note?  So please tell me: What is best practice to record a stillbirth as a genealogical event?  "
424,Citing a conversation with a living relative,"I had a conversation with a relative which provided me some useful information. However, when I (or someone else) read the genealogy some time in the future, there obviously needs to be a citation. However, with the typical GEDCOM citation data fields, I am not sure how to clearly and accurately represent this source. I am using GRAMPS, but I would like this to be correctly exportable to other softwares.  How should I cite a conversation in GEDCOM format so it is both accurate and easy for a reader to understand? More specifically, how should I accomplish this in GRAMPS? "
425,Dealing with incomplete dates for living relatives on Ancestry.com,"I only have day/month dates for some relatives births, but no year. I usually record them as ""25 Dec 19_"" leaving underscores for the last two digits. The problem is the Brothers Keeper software I use assumes the year 19_ is the year 19 A.D. So if I upload a gedcom to Ancestry.com, these living people are designated as dead, and all their info will be shown.   Is there a way to fool the Ancestry.com ""living/non-living"" detector? Will ""25 Dec 19??"" work, or a fake future date, like ""25 Dec 9999"" ?  "
426,Determining who died on particular voyage of ship?,"One voyage of the ship William Stetson began the 26th of April, 1855 in Liverpool, England and ended the 27th of May, 1855 in New York. One account of the voyage says:     The New York Herald of May 30, announces the arrival at that port of the William Stetson, May 27. Two births occurred on board and four deaths.   How can I find the names of the four people who died?  I tried finding the May 30th article from the New York Herald mentioned above. fultonhistory.com has archives of the New York Herald but 1855 seems to be missing May - August.  The Library of Congress lists libraries that have microfilm of the New York Herald but they're all pretty far away from where I live. And even if I were able to visit one, there's no guarantee that the article would contain the names. For example, the New-York Daily Tribune mentions the arrival of the ship William Stetson, but it doesn't even mention the two births and four deaths.  The Mormon Migration website has images of the passenger lists that the Mormons kept, but it doesn't appear to make any mention of people dying, and Mormons weren't the only ones on the ship (though they count for over 50% of the passengers).  Ancestry has the passenger list, but I also wasn't able to find an indication of any deaths. Though it's entirely possible that I just missed something. "
427,How do I search for a newspaper (instead of a person) on Genealogy Bank?,"In trying to answer Determining who died on particular voyage of ship?, I tried searching GenealogyBank.com since I have a paid subscription and wanted to help @JustinY. His question was 'how' so I could have just answered with a link to the site. However, I didn't want him to pay for a subscription just to find it was fruitless. I have used GenealogyBank successfully to find information on my ancestors, but I've never used it to find a particular newspaper from a particular time frame. If I already knew the answer to his question (who died on the voyage of the William Stetson that docked in NY May 1855), then I could look it up by name. But this is the inverse-- how do I find a particular article without the name to then read the name?  I tried reading their help and tried various things, but was unsuccessful in determining how to do it. For example I used keywords but in this particular case the ship name (William Stetson) has 22K hits since that particular name has genealogical significance in it's own right (e.g., I'm a member of the Stetson Kindred). I'm sure it's there and I'm just missing it somehow. So, I thought I'd ask here since others may have the same question.  How do I search for a newspaper (instead of a person) on Genealogy Bank? I.e., a particular newspaper on a particular date. Or a particular article using something other than the name of a person (in this case a ship)? "
428,What were the rules about Massachusetts town marriage intentions ca 1811?,"They say sex and scandal sells. Maybe an updated question that adds a little of both will spice up and clarify my question.   For years I have recorded Massachusetts marriage intentions in my family file. Sure, there are errors and suspected omissions, but I never thought about these intentions in terms of record bias. All that has changed because of the case of John Preston and Mary Cook, 1811, Gloucester, Massachusetts.   I'm on a quest to learn more.   In order to figure out if these intentions were subject to bias, I think I need to understand how the process actually worked. According to the City of Gloucester: Marriage License site, filings today require both parties to appear.   Would both parties have been required to appear in 1811? How did these intentions (aka ""publishments"") come to be and what form did they take? For example, did someone ask the town or church to publish the intentions? Were the intentions just announcements pinned to the church or courthouse door? In 1811, would these have been published in a local paper? Who could order the publication?   For the most part, I wouldn't think record bias would be very likely if both people were from the same town. In the puzzling case of John Preston and Mary Cook, however, the intended parties are not even from the same state.   Here's the story.   A long, long time ago, the marriage intention between ""Miss Mary Cook [of Gloucester]"" and ""John Preston of Rumney, State of New Hampshire"" dated 22 June 1811 was recorded in the ""Publishments"" of Gloucester, Massachusetts (partial page image follows). A corresponding New Hampshire intention has not been found; no record of a marriage between the couple has been located in either place.       From separate research, the man noticed in this record is almost certainly John Preston born 5 Dec 1789, at Rumney, son of William Preston and Elizabeth Clark. John was the brother of my ancestor, William Preston. These two brothers are said to have been soliders in the War of 1812 who became the first white settlers of modern day Defiance, Ohio, after the war.(note 1) John Preston died at Defiance 7 May 1819.(note 2)   As part of the bigger task to advance the proof about these brothers, our family has worked a timeline at both New England and Ohio. The last (latest) known record about either of the brothers at New England had been this 1811 marriage intention.(note 3)  Likewise, the earliest record of either man at Ohio is the Miami County marriage 13 October 1814 of John Preston to Sophia Ewing, dau. daughter of Alexander Ewing of Fort Wayne fame.(note 4) Ewing family materials refer to Sophia's husband separately as ""Captain Preston"" or ""Captain John Preston.""   I had assumed John Preston was present when the 1811 intention was filed and was working from the hypothesis that he remained at New England long enough for the intention to somehow dissolve, but left soon enough to see service in the war and court his bride, Sophia (probably both at Ohio).    Sex? Scandal? We took the case to Jane Walsh and the Gloucester Archives a year ago, hoping to learn more about how the intention was resolved (breakup, marriage, divorce). Jane could find no record of a marriage or marriage dissolution, but she found research partially identifying Mary Cook (note 5) and reporting her first two children as Martha Perkins (said born 4 November 1810) and John Preston (said born 5 February 1813).(note 6)   Wow.   As ""Miss Mary Cook,"" the 1811 intended bride married Zebulon Parsons some 10 years later; it seems the only known marriage associated with this Mary Cook. Births of three Parsons children to Mary and Zebulon were recorded at Gloucester.   Failure to confirm birth of John Preston, 1813: John Preston's birth is not reported in Gloucester's vital records (nor seems the earlier birth of daughter Martha Perkins). While the research is recent and ongoing, notice of these births has so far not been found in the Gloucester town books (now browsable as part of the FamilySearch Historical Record collections).   If Mary Cook's son John Preston was born in 1813, it seemed not impossible, but less likely that he was the son of John Preston of Rumney.  However, the information I developed about this son suggested a birth in 1812 (ala, probably 5 February 1812). For example,    John Preston died 31 August 1868, said age 56 years, 6 mos. [Rockport, Mass. death vital record] (Computes to a birth in February 1812.) John Preston's gravestone, Union Cemetery, Rockport, Mass., reports an age of 56. (So, born ca 1812.) John Preston was was age 53 at the time of the Massachusetts 1865 state census. (So born ca 1812.) John Preston was age 48 at the time of the 1860 U.S. census. (I viewed at Ancestry.com.) So, born ca 1812. John Preston was age 38 in the 1850 U.S. census. [Ancestry indexed as 38; FamilySearch indexed as 35.] Again, so born ca 1812.   If Mary Cook's son, John Preston, had been born in 1812, it seemed likely he was son of my Rumney man--but that analysis supposed dear John Preston (1789-1819) had been a participant in filing the marriage intention.   Wondering whether or not he had to be a participant brings us full circle to inquiring about the customs and practices of filing marriage intentions at Massachusetts in 1811.   P.S. I did think about tags for ""sex"" and ""scandal"" ...    References:   Nevin O. Winter, History of Northwest Ohio (Chicago: Lewis Publishing Co., 1917) 1: 405.  Isabella H.

430,"Missing enumeration of Union St. in Flushing, Queens, NY in 1940 census?","I am looking for the resident of 42-42 Union St, Flushing, Queens, NY in 1940. I tried searching the 1940 census ancestry.com, restricting the search to Flushing with the street name as union (exact). I came up with 70 matches, some on Union Street, and others on Union Turnpike, but the Union Street house numbers were mostly 46-xx, 47-xx, and a couple of 45-xxs. Nothing higher, nothing lower. Removing Flushing from the city constraint does not help much: it returns a couple of families on Union Hall street, and one on Union Tpke  I have tried to use [website]Is this a case of poor indexing? Where are the other addresses on Union street? How do I find them? "
431,What is a plausible explanation for this inconsistency?,"In the 1910 census, I have a family headed by Elias Riback (b. 1876), with wife Sophia (b. 1873) and children Annie (b. 1898), Harry (b. 1902), Bessie (b. 1904), David (b. 1906), and Bernard (b. 1908).    The 1920 census is consistent with this:    In the 1930 census, I find Ellis Ribeck (b. 1875), with wife Sophia (b. 1873), and children David (b., 1907) and Bernhardt (b. 1909). This is reasonably consistent.    In the 1910 census, the couple is reported to have been married for 13 years, placing the date of marriage in 1897, the year before the birth of the first child. Sophia is also listed as having five children, all living, which accounts for the entire family in 1910. So far, so good. In the 1930 census, however, Ellis's age at first marriage is listed at 22 (marriage date: 1899), while Sophia's is given at 33 (marriage date: 1906). While the families match on all other points, I am at a loss as to how to explain the discrepancy.   I also don't know who reported these numbers to the census taker. How is that information recorded in the 1930 census (if at all)? Finally, there is a notation ""al"" between the names of the two sons (David and Bernhardt). What does that mean? "
432,How to deal with adoptions given the changes made to some records?,"In Brazil, when some adoption is authorized by the Justice, it's possible to change the records of the child so the adoptive parents are reported as the parents, leaving no trace of the biological parents.   How can I record such information from adoptions that occured few decades ago? The original documents don't exist anywhere, and the legal documents now state that person A is the child of X and Y, but it isn't biologically true? "
433,Seemingly missing NYC birth records,"I am looking for birth records for the children of David Nechemias and Etta Ehrensaal. From census records, I have Beatrice (b. abt 1897), Helen (b. abt 1904), Sidney (b. about 1907) and Roselyn (b. abt 1911). The first three children should be indexed in the NYC birth index but I cannot find any of them. In particular, I have an estimate of Sidney's birth date from other records as 19 Jun 1906, but I could not find any plausible matches for him even without constraining his last name much.   From the city directory and census records, I am reasonably sure that the family actually did live in New York, at least starting in 1904, because the NYC directory shows a David Nechemias (drygds) at 133 Harrison Ave, and the 1910 census shows David Nechemias's occupation as ""dry goods / own store."" I have not found this family's 1900 census record.  I suppose the two obvious causes for my lack of success are a mis-spelled name or the possibility that they had children elsewhere. I've tried as many wild-card and spelling variants for the name as I could think of. I've tried doing searches unconstrained by geography. What am I missing? What should I do next? "
434,Locating 18th/19th century grave in Massachusetts?,"I am trying to help a friend. He has a Revolutionary War ancestor, Captain Robert Lenthall Eells, buried in the Hanover Center Cemetery in Hanover, Massachusetts ( findagrave, googlemaps).  I grew up in that area and visit periodically so I have tried to find his ancestor's grave for him, but have been unsuccessful in the past. I'll be visiting again and was asking for help in how to locate this particular grave. It's quite a large cemetery so I was looking for a method to find his grave other than just walking around until I found it (I try to do a little of that each trip). We have tried findagrave, talking to the cemetery custodians, and google searches. We did come across a partial plot map in a proposal to restore a small portion of the cemetery but unfortunately he was not in that section.  We have found several Eells (Robert Eells in Lot 62 Section F and George Eells in Lot 60 Section F)but unfortunately not the Robert Eells he was searching for.  The particulars are:     Robert Lenthal Eells: b. 17 Feb 1732 Hanover, d. 19 Jun 1800 Hanover      m. 01 Dec 1757 Scituate       Ruth Copeland: b. 16 Sep 1735 Scituate, d. 21 May 1831 Hanover   He has a findagrave photo request posted, but has not had anyone locate his gravesite yet.  Capt Eells was a cousin of the Barstows, and a leading citizen of his time, and reportedly one of the wealthiest ship builders in the town. His grave was listed in several books of town records with tombstone transcriptions compiled in the late 1800's. Not sure what happened to his marker now.    The lady from the Hanover Department of Public Works tried to help my friend. She was not able to find Capt. Eells in the card file or computer index she had on hand. She said that someone had many years ago walked off with a lot of the old records. They have been trying to restore their database ever since.  I did make another 'walk around' looking for Capt Eells this Thanksgiving (2012) but was unsuccessful. I did upload 86 photos to BillionGraves.com and have some others to upload to findagrave.com. BillionGraves' app is certainly easier to use but I didn't realize I don't get the photo's so I switched back to findagrave mid walk. "
435,What can I learn about Sir William Brereton based on his portrait?,"This portrait of Sir William Brereton (1550-1631) hangs in the Detroit Institute of Arts:    Regarding the portrait I have the following questions:   I assume the number ""1579"" in the corner is the date the portrait was made? What is the (I assume Latin) text below the number? It looks like:  PICTVRA•GVLIELMI• BRERETON•MILITIS HVIVS•DOMI•CODITORIS ANoŒT•SVŒ•28 ~ I know the family motto is ""Opitulante Deo"" and can read it under William Brereton's Coat of Arms. Is there a place online where I might find a larger version of his Coat? What might be a reasonable guess for the portrait embedded within his hat? It looks female to me, but beyond that I have no idea. Are the glove and sword which he is holding symbolic of anything about him, or are they just flourishes to the portrait?  "
436,"What does it mean if cause of death is listed as ""Insanity"" in late 1800s?","My great, great grandmother's cause of death is listed as ""Insanity"" on her death record, and I'm not sure what this means.  She died in Winsted, McLeod County, Minnesota in 1872 at age 37, and had just given birth to a daughter less than a month prior to her death.  Could the ""Insanity"" have anything to do with complications from the birth? Or Postpartum depression? Or is it something else entirely? "
437,Is there a single place I could go in Italy to view birth records from Northern Italy from 1750-1850?,"Where can I go (physically) in Italy to find records from the 1750-1850, for people who were born in the North of Italy?  I know that each city would have their registries, but I am missing the exact cities, and I do not think that going for all possible cities would be suitable.  So, is there a central place where I could find copies and so on? "
438,Managing MyHeritage messages,"I'm wondering if I'm somehow missing/unaware of some features for managing my MyHeritage messages...  I consider myself a full-time amateur genetic genealogist.  I need to contact a lot of matches to get their family information (most don't post it).  Consequently, I have hundreds -- maybe soon thousands -- of messages that I've sent and received with MyHeritage.  I keep a separate database of people I've contacted, but I don't copy the message details to my database.  But, it appears that there is no way to search the messages, nor is there even a system where messages are linked to a match.  Am I wrong?  How do others manage a large number of messages on MyHeritage? "
439,Migrating data from Title field to Occupation event using Gramps?,"When I started using Gramps (older versions 3 &amp; 4) for my family tree, I chose to use the Title field to store their occupation information. Gramps since version 5 offers the capability to print the last occupation event in the relationship graph so I decided to migrate my existing data to a proper occupation event. As I have 900+ persons in my family tree, I would like to automate the process.  Here is how I plan to do things:    query the persons database to get the title field data as well as the person id process this data to a nice input file (I need to reformat the title  information as sometimes I recorded several jobs at once) create occupation events from my input file   I am familiar with python and programming in general but I don't know how to interact with Gramps files. Are there example code or documentation I could use to understand how data is organised?  Better ideas accepted.  EDIT Note : I am currently using v5.0.1  After some research, I know how to do the step 1 above: by using the export menu I can generate a csv where I can find the title and the person id straigth-away.  Step 2 is just me cleaning the data so that's ok. However for step 3,  I am stuck. It looks like I could use the import feature if I was able to generate an xml file in the same format as Gramps. The problem is that Gramps expects something like this:  &lt;person handle=""_cd284dd52627d55ab80"" change=""1554508105"" id=""I0010""&gt;   ...   &lt;eventref hlink=""_e235f0096da3481aebdc5bf0138"" role=""Primary""/&gt;   ... &lt;/person&gt; &lt;event handle=""_e235f0096da3481aebdc5bf0138"" change=""1554508051"" id=""E1346""&gt;   &lt;type&gt;Occupation&lt;/type&gt;   &lt;dateval val=""1892""/&gt;   &lt;description&gt;Teacher&lt;/description&gt; &lt;/event&gt;   And I have no clue on how to generate the handle, change and hlink values so that they don't break Gramps database. I also don't know what happens if I import partial information, does it break the other data? "
440,Deciding between multiple birth names and dates?,"I have some differences on the certificates and census information.  Birth Certificate:       Name: Edith Nellie Hardiman      Birth Date: 16 Sep 1892      Birth Location: Compton Chamberlayne, Wiltshire, England   1892 Baptism  Here is her baptism:       Baptism Date: 25 Dec 1892      Birth Location: Compton Chamberlayne, Wiltshire, England   1901 Census  This is the details from FamilySearch website:    If we calculate 31 Mar 1901 - 16 Sep 1892 the result is:     Or 8 years, 6 months, 15 days excluding the end date.   So this too ties in with the birth certificate.  1911 Census       Name: Edith Ellen Hardiman      Birth Date: 17 Years Old      Birth Location: Compton, Wiltshire, England    Nellie could be considered Ellen I assume? Compton could be considered Compton Chamberlayne I assume? Being 17 indicates a birth year of approx. 1894.   Marriage Certificate 1    She married my Great Grandfather in 1912 and it states:     Name: Edith Ellen Hardiman      Birth Date: 20 Years Old   So this calculates to 1892 again.  Marriage Certificate 2    My Great Grandfather died unexpectedly and thus Edith remarries in 1931:     Name: Edith Ellen Truckle      Birth Date: 37 Years Old    Truckle is correct and this was her first married surname. Being 37 indicates a birth year of approx. 1894.   1939 Register       Name: Edith E Smith      Birth Date: 24 Sep 1895    Smith is correct as that is her new married surname. 1895 is yet another year!     1939 Register Addendum  Here are all entries on the register for the household:    This is my tree:    Although my father has dementia now he over the years he told me that my Grandfather (Frederick George) had three brothers. Note that all of them have passed away thus I can present this information.    Death Certificate  She died in 1977:       Name: Edith Nellie Smith      Birth Date: 24 Sep 1894      Birth Location: Compton Chamberlayne, Wiltshire, England   So we have two names:   Edith Nellie Hardiman Edith Ellen Hardiman   And we have a few birth entries:   16 Sep 1892 1893 (maybe - 1901 census - could be 1892) 24 Sep 1894 24 Sep 1895   Since I have the actual certificates I can confirm that her father remains the same Samuel Hardiman throughout.  At the moment I have used the latter date of 1894 since this is what they all thought:    My gut tells me to just ignore the 1939 Register. They must have been confused. But then my gut also tells me that I should really use the 1892 date as the preferred since it is when she was born:    So my question is two-fold really:   Is Nellie / Ellen interchangeable? Which birth date should be preferred? Birth or death?  "
441,Understanding how to use Massachusetts Marriage Index,"Using Ancestry, I found that my cousin L.F. (a female)  is listed in the Massachusetts Marriage Index as having married in 1947. The index provides a Volume and Page Number for that marriage.  Is there any way to utilize that information to find the name of her spouse?  Presumably, her spouse (name unknown to me) would also be listed in the index of marriages with the same Volume and page number.    What would I expect to see at that volume and page number?  Many marriages or only one? "
442,How to identify 19th century birth record in England when uncertain of parent's given names?,"This question refers to people in a previously posted question about the identity of the mother of Elizabeth Cowan, b. 29 Sep 1824, England, and d. 14 Oct 1896, Ohio, USA: Could &quot;Our Mother&quot; be a term of endearment on 1855 headstone?  Elizabeth's death record in Ohio gives her mother's name as Elizabeth, father's name is Robert (see older question). A Harriet Cowan age 72, is living with Elizabeth and her husband in Ohio in the 1850 census, and her headstone from 1855 reads ""Our Mother"" (see older question). Notes from an older relative give the father's name as Richard, although that is not based on any records, as far as I can tell.  In a biography of her husband in The Centennial Biographical History of Columbus, Ohio (1901) [website]So, likely names for Elizabeth's parents are Robert/Richard &amp; Elizabeth/Harriet Cowan/Cowen/Cowin, and she was born in England between 1820-1830, possibly 'opposite Hyde Park'.  A search of the ancestry database London, England, Church of England Births and Baptisms, 1813-1906 which is from Board of Guardian Records, 1834-1906 and Church of England Parish Registers, 1754-1906. London Metropolitan Archives, London, returns no families that meet all of the given name criteria (any combination of Robert/Richard/Elizabeth/Harriet) with multiple family name spellings.   Broadening the search to all of England using ""England Births and Christenings, 1538-1975,"" database, FamilySearch [website]I cannot locate the family in either the 1841 England Census (which is missing several parishes 'opposite Hyde Park': [website]My question is, without being absolutely certain of the first names of Elizabeth's parents (and there does not seem to be more records about them), and without finding even a 'right name/right time-place' match to follow up on, how can I identify Elizabeth Cowan's birth record? Is it even possible? "
443,Handling nicknames on Ancestry.com?,"I have a relative whose first and middle names were given as ""Mary Magdalena"". However, for her entire life, she went by ""Lena"" and some records even have that listed. Anyone living who remembers her knows her as ""Lena"" (and may not even know her given name), so I would expect them to search for that name.  I'm a complete newbie to genealogy and am using Ancestry.com. I expected there to be a ""Given name"" field and ""Preferred name"" field (or perhaps a ""Nickname"" field""), but all I see is the generic ""Name"" field. I see that I can add more than one name and then set one of them as the ""preferred"" name and others to alternates, but I don't see clarifications on what they mean, or what the best practices are.  In this case, do I set her preferred name as ""Lena"" (since that's what she preferred to go by during her life) and then set the alternate names as ""Mary Magdalena""?   Or is it the opposite with her legal name being the ""preferred"" name aside from her own personal preference?  "

446,Interpreting MyHeritage DNA Match of 973cM?,"I just got a DNA match at MyHeritage with 973 cM, in common, which says first cousin.  My mother had one brother, and it's from her side of the family.  He had a son, who passed at a young age.  I am a novice, and some of the answers I have gotten are over my head.  Being dyslexic has made it more difficult for me to understand.  I have to read, reread and then reread again, to try to get the gist (which I am not getting).  I have common matches to her, from my Grandmas side (Biamtones) my Grandpa side (Deni) also, but there is no one in the family to ask.  She was never told who her dad was, and her mother passed last year, as did my uncle.  I am the oldest in the family, so no one to even hint at.  How can i figure this out?    I have asked her to send me her matches, to see how they match with me.  Is there anything else I can do?  I am not in the position to afford to pay a big fee.  She is my age, born in the city I was born in, and moved away at the age of 5.  Her mother married and lived out of town.  She is my top match.  The next one we share is my Grandmas, brothers granddaughter LC who for some reason has 244 cM in common with Janice, while LC has  138 with me.  If it was our Great Grandfathers child, would it not have been a closer match then it shows to LC?    Plus she would not have my Grandpas family in her DNA matches?   Is that correct? "
447,Understanding half first cousin DNA results when no match?,"We have strong reason to believe we know who my aunt's half first cousin is. However, he is not matching her with autosomnal dna test on ancestry.   Its fair to say ok forget it but there are so many things that point that way.   Is it possible that its just not showing up?  He would be my half first cousin once removed.   Might he show up with me if i took a test?  Also it's his grandfather that is thought to be my dad's and aunt's grandfather. Obviously different grandmothers.  "
448,Cousin claiming to be half sister?,"Thought to be cousins, fathers are brothers, both male parents are deceased.   Is it possible to DNA test accurately enough to verify half sibling when female cousin is daughter of brother of my father?    I am male, mother of cousin is also deceased.    Or is there too much DNA overlap due to fathers being brothers to determine authenticity of claim? "
449,What are some possible reasons that a father's name is missing from a birth certificate - England?,"I posted a previous question about my great-grandmother before but I ordered her birth certificate from the New GRO index [website]However, the name of her father is missing.

450,How is it that Family Photos appear on Postcards?,"I'm going through a photo album with photos that appear to range starting from 1915.  It includes a lot of postcards, which I thought were stock photos, but now I find one that is identified as family members on the back:     What is this practice and when was it most common?  Also, how can I best distinguish actual family photos from stock photos if the backs all look like this one, but have no handwriting? "
451,Approximate Date of this early 20th century photo?,"Here is the photo:    I'm guessing it is around 1915, but wondering if there are clues in the photo to date it better?  The photo measures 3.25"" x 3.875"" and is probably taken in Texas.  Does the clothing, rifle, or car behind them give clues? "
452,Explaining paternal haplogroup of J2a1b1 for Chinese person?,"I'm from Beijing, China. I recently did a DNA test, to my surprise, my paternal haplogroup is J2a1b1.  Also, the test shows that I have 2.7% Balkan which is quite amazing.   How is that possible?   I belong to one of the ethnic minorities in China (Hui People) and I guess some of my ancestors may come from Central Asia.  Is that Balkan ancestry somehow related to my paternal haplogroup? "
453,Matching unknown family member apparent from AncestryDNA?,"I had my DNA test done on Ancestry, when I received my results I showed a 1051 CM match to a Sandra. I knew nothing of this person nor could we find any connection. This person lives in Wales.  Rumor has it my Uncle was in WWII and  he got some gal PG after the war he went back to marry her only to find out she was married. I have been communicating with Sandra trying to figure out how we match. Both her mother and father are deceased. I show no connection to anyone she has listed as her ""father"" nor her mother. I have crossed compared her 1st cousin's to mine and all of the mothers to both are sister's to my uncle. Is there anyway to prove that she is in fact my 1st Cousin and my Uncle was in fact her dad. She has a living brother but does not want to involve him as she feels it would devastate him. Any suggestions?? She thinks taking a test through another site will give her different results.  "
454,Determining a relationship from the 1871 census?,"I am trying to identify the parents of my great-grandfather Thomas Jones (born 5 March 1870 in Dowlais, Merthyr Tyfdil, which ties up with all his census entries from 1881 onwards.)  I know their names but cannot track them down before or after the birth of one of their only known child.  What I know and how  His father was Thomas Jones, 'Agent', and his mother was Elizabeth (formerly Hughes) -- all this information from his birth certificate (using a date of birth found in the 1939 Register, and verifying with the Merthy Tydfil register ofice that there was no other Thomas Jones born in Dowlais on that date.  By the time of my great-grandfather's marriage in 1893, his father was recorded as a deceased Engine Driver (which probably means a stationery engine at a pit).  Looking for siblings  Searching the GRO indices for other children with the surname Jones and others maiden name Hughes born before and after Thomas isn't a feasible proposition -- Jones and Hughes were very common names in the South Wales coal fields.  Looking at the first census after he was born:  My assumption is that if my Thomas was born in March 1870, his age and birth place in the 1871 census would be given quite accurately.  In the 1871 census there are only 6 candidates born in Dowlais between 1869 and 1871; there are a further 9 born in Merthyr Tydfil. None of them have one or both correct parent(s)...   ... except for a Thomas Jones aged 1 in the household of William Harries born abt 1811 and his wife Jane born abt 1816 both in Carmarthenshire. Alongside their unmarried children born 1849 to 1863 (all in Dowlais or Merthyr Tydfil) is an Elizabeth Jones a widow aged 28 (so born abt 1842/1843) in Dowlais and Thomas Jones aged 1 born Dowlais:    (There are no other candidates born Glamorgan with a correct parent and a birthplace that isn't too specific to be an option).  Elizabeth Jones is shown as the granddaugher of William Harries and Jane, which is where this particular difficulty starts.  Can she really be the grandaughter of the head of household?  I have traced Willian and Jane (and their children) back through the censuses to 1851 -- their ages and place of birth are consistent (1811 Carmarthenshire for him and 1818/1820 Carmarthenshire for her.)  I've also correlated the childrens' births via the GRO indices and determined that Jane's surname is Matthews. There is a marriage of William Harries to Jane Matthews in 1846Q2 Merthyr Tydfil. I haven't found either of them conclusively in 1841.  However, if Elizabeth Jones was born 1843, her parents would have been born circa 1827 at the latest, so she cannot possibly be the granddaughter of William and Jane -- either as a result of their current marriage or any potential previous marriages (they did marry unusually late in life, so may have had previous marriages).  What other possibilities exist?  It's possible that she's the illegitimate daughter of Jane, but there isn't an Elizabeth Matthews born to mother with the maiden name Matthews in Merthyr Tydfil between 1841 and 1845. She might also be a legitimate daughter of Jane by a previous marriage, but checking for an Elizabeth born to a mother with the MMN Matthews is an impossible task (especially as the GRO indices won't let you search without a surname).  It's possible that she's the daughter of William by a first marriage, and two possibilities born 1841-1845 in Merthyr Tydfil: Elizabeth Harris 1842S (MMN Roberts) and Elizabeth Harris 1842D (MMN Jones) which I have not yet tracked forward to confirm or eliminate them.  My question(s):  Why is she shown as a grand-daughter when she clearly cannot be one? What other relationship might she have to the family with which she is living? How can I confirm any hypotheses about the relationship? "

456,What does location Boshte mean?,"I've got a Status Animarium from Ljubljana in the early 1800s written in German using Kurrent handwriting and it lists a birth location as ditto Boshte, underlined in red, but I don't understand what that is exactly:    In later records, loco is used to mean the same location as the current household.  In this case, the household is Mali Cirnik 13, so does Boshte mean the same location in German?  Google translate says it is not a word.  Is this some kind of old style German spelling?  What is the exact word in German and what does it mean for the location of birth?  Here is the whole page in case more context is needed:  "

458,"Identifying John Morgan, son of Thomas D. Morgan (1809-1870)?","I have a real dilemma.   I have found a DNA link to the Thomas Morgan (1791-1860) family through Frances Denira ""Fanny"" Morgan (1821-1899), daughter of Benjamin Francis Morgan (1762-1835), who was the son of Thomas and Isabella Chitta Morgan.    After researching back I don't find in Benjamin Francis' line any John Wesley Morgan (1831-1901) who was my great grandfather, but I do find a John Morgan (abt. 1830-?)   Who is the son of Thomas D. Morgan (1809-1870), grandson of John Morgan (1754-1811) and great grandson of Thomas and Isabella Morgan i.e. how do I prove Thomas Morgan's John and my John Wesley are the same person?    John Morgan is mentioned in Thomas' Will but only as John.  Same with census.  Uncle Benjamin Francis' brother is John Morgan f/o Thomas D. Morgan. "
459,Interpreting 17th century German dates?,"I am working on the biography of a distant relative, Anna Bertschinger. The hand-written notes I got handed down from my grandfather state:     verm. 2. post trin. 1649    I understand that this refers to a wedding date, presumably corresponding to the second Sunday after Trinity, which would make it the Sunday ten weeks after Easter. (or is ""2. post trin."" the second /day/ after Trinity Sunday?) According to [website]Is this calculation correct? "
460,"Is DNA match between two parties that ought not be related by ""blood"" possible?","I recently completed a autosomal DNA through ancestry. They reported that I had a possible match to another ancestry user with:     30.0 centimorgans shared across 1 DNA segment   However, it turns out that while we are related by marriage we don't appear to be related by ""blood"".   The only relationship we can detect is that my great grandfather is the other person's father-in-law of their great grandfather.  Assuming that our record genealogies are correct and that there was no ""hanky-panky"" it would seems that the suggestion of a DNA match is incorrect.  How often might this occur, and is it assignable to ""experimental error"" in testing? Other explanations? "
461,Recording dates from old documents?,"This is a follow-up to: Interpreting 17th century German dates?  In documents available to me I have both absolute dates (e.g., 2 March 1648) and relative dates (e.g., 2. post trin. 1649). Since the records in question come from an area where conversion to the Gregorian calendar had not yet taken place, I presume the relative date should be converted to the Julian calendar and recorded in that fashion. Is there then a necessity to record this fact (or generally the fact that dates prior to 1700 are Julian and not Gregorian) or is this tacitly implied? Are there general rules on how to handle such situations? "
462,Formulating a strategy to locate a marriage,"What strategy can I adopt to locate an English marriage record for two ancestors?   Of course, they may not have married at all, but Rebecca Probert points out in Marriage Law for Genealogists the definitive guide that the peak illegitimacy rate in the 19th century is about 7% so the vast majority of children were born within wedlock. As the couple had at least three children, it's most likely that they did marry.  What I know:  My ancestors John Charles Wright and Caroline Ellen Brown had the following known children:   Mary Agnes (or Agnes Mary) born 3 July 1859 in Hitchin, Hertfordshire (mother given as Ellen Wright formerly Brown) Stanley Reynolds born 27 May 1861 in Plumstead, Kent (mother given as Caroline Ellen Wright formerly Brown) George Wright born about 1864 -- no birth registration or certificate located yet; birth year from census records.   John Charles Wright was born between 1825 and 1835 in Kidderminster, Worcestershire, based on census records between 1851 and 1901 (he's not very consistent when reporting his age); in all sources in which I've found him (censuses, children's birth certificates, trade directories) he is named as John Charles/John Chas/J.C. Wright). His occupation from 1851 to 1871 is recorded as Painter and Glazier, Journeyman Grainer, Painter, and Photographer.  In 1851 he is shown as Married (but his wife is not present) living in Marylebone. Thereafter, he is found in census in Kidderminster (1861, again without his wife), and Cheshunt (1871).  Ellen Brown was born around 1828 (from her age at death in 1871); no location is known as I have not found her definitively in any census. Her name is variously shown as Ellen (death, burial, birth of first child) and Caroline Ellen (birth of second child). She may also have appeared as Caroline Wright in the 1861 census, but I'm not confident enough that I've identified her correctly to use this data.  What I've assumed  Both partners would have been at least 18 at their marriage and most likely in their early-to-mid 20s (based on analysis in Marriage Law for Genealogists the definitive guide).  This gives a time frame between 1844 and 1859 (allowing for a margin of error of 2 years on Ellen's birth).  As Ellen would both have been quite old to have their first child in 1859 (circa 30) either (1) there may have been other children born to the couple before 1859; or (2) this was a second marriage for her.  I'm making no assumption about where they married.  What I've tried   A search in the marriage indices on FreeBMD for marriages between John Wright and Caroline Browne(e) or Ellen Brown(e). Result: no candidate marriage. (I've repeated the search on other transcriptions of the indices, and done it with just the surnames; I've also inspected the images of the relevant GRO index pages, all with no success). As we all know, errors and omissions crept in during the production of the GRO marriage indices, so I've also searched online parish registers for the same data, again with no success. Of course, not all parish registers are available online. In case this was Ellen's second marriage (in which case she would appear in the GRO indices with a surname other than Brown) I've searched for all marriages of Ellen or Caroline Brown(e) in the period, identified the possible surnames she might have acquired on her first marriage, and then search for marriages between her potential married names and John Wright.  There were surprisingly few candidate marriages form this exercise, and most of those were easy to eliminate.  Only two possibilities remain that I can't eliminate conclusively without buying the certificates: one in Wrexham, and one in Ormskirk. Both locations seem unlikely. Locating children of the couple born earlier than 1859 would narrow down the time window, but the common surname (Wright) and mother's maiden name (Brown) make this infeasible using the new GRO birth indices (that include mother's maiden name).  I have still to search online baptismal records for children with the correct parents and a match on (one of) the father's occupations.   Are there any other searches I can make that would help directly or indirectly in locating the marriage I seek? "
463,Is it normal to be baptised on same day as birth?,"I'm looking at a transcription of a baptismal record from September 18, 1866 that lists the birth as also being September 18, 1866.   Is it normal for this time period to be baptised on the same day you are born?  Alternatively, could the record just not have exact day, possibly two days earlier as I've seen for several others, that he was baptised? "
464,Determining if 2nd cousin is father from DNA test?,"My partner is waiting on her DNA results. She strongly suspects that her 2nd cousin is her father (long story).   Will the DNA results reveal the possibility from more concentrated markers, or less genetic diversity?   Is it even something that will be picked up on the report?   Do the reports even suggest a possibility of very close inbreeding within a family? "
465,Acceptable number of no-calls in autosomal DNA test results?,"Using Gedmatch's file diagnostics, an autosomal DNA test kit I manage shows that there are 31200 (4.4%) no-calls. In most matching algorithms, a no-call is treated equivalently to a match. Therefore, as Gedmatch states:     This kit has an unusually high number of no-calls, which usually   results in a larger number of false matches.   Which would explain why there are so many matches for this kit with (likely) no actual genetic relationship.  This kit was tested through FamilyTreeDNA.  Is this truly an unusual margin of error? Is it unreasonable to ask FamilyTreeDNA to retest on a new DNA sample? "
466,"Meaning of ""hinterlassen"" in old German marriage record","I found an early 17th century German marriage record in which the groom is marked as ""hinterlassen"" in reference to his father. Does that give me information about the father's date of death? In particular, can I infer that he was dead when the son was born, or is ""hinterlassen"" strictly with reference to the wedding? "
467,What can I deduce (if anything) from these US City Directories,"I'm looking at the City Directories for Youngstown, Ohio (Ancestry.com. U.S. City Directories, 1822-1995 [database on-line]. Provo, UT, USA: Ancestry.com Operations, Inc., 2011. )  My ancestor William Staines (with his wife Catherine) and two of his sons moved to Youngstown from England in the late 1890s. A son from Catherine's previous marriage (Willam Morris) also moved to the USA in the same time frame.  In the 1900 census william Staines the elder is a 68-year old 'Day labourer'; he had been an iron worker from 1851 until at least 1893.  Catherine was 66 in the same census. Neither of them appear in the 1910 census.  In 1900, 1901 and 1902 I can find entries for William Staines (and his wife Catherine), William Staines Jr and Ernest Ernest Staines  In 1903 Ernest is present, but neither of the Williams.  In 1904 Ernest and the younger William are present; the younger William is no longer shown as William jr.  William sr's wife Catherine appears in the 1905 census of New Jersey with her son William Morris; there is no indication that she is a widow, but her husband is not present  By 1908, she is back in Youngstown and recorded as a widow.  I conclude from this that William sr died between 1902 (when he was last recorded in Youngstown) and 1908 (when Catherine is first recorded as a widow).  Does the fact that William jr ceased to be shown as William jr in 1904 suggest that William is dead by then, or could it simply mean that he was no longer resident in Youngstown?  Does the fact that the 1903 directory was published in January 1903 tell me anything about when the data was gathered -- and so, when William sr ceased to be resident for whatever reason? "
468,Shared centimorgans of second cousins with different paternal grandfathers?,"I'm new. Just reading the useful answer to a question about shared centimorgans of first cousins with different paternal grandmothers. I share 238 cM with a second cousin. We can be pretty sure that we share the same great grandmother, but it's possible that she had children by different fathers. With this amount of shared DNA, is it possible that our great grandfathers could have been different? ie could we be half-second cousins or is it more likely that we share the same g grandfather? I share 270 cM with another second cousin (on a different side of the family) where the identity of our g grandfather is not in doubt.  "
469,Interpreting Land Record Abstract pre-1730 Pennsylvania?,"I am researching the 4 generations of my family that arrived in Chester County Pennsylvania between 1682-1715. In order to get a fuller picture of these ancestors, I've just begun looking through the land record abstracts in Abstracts of Chester County Pennsylvania Land Records Vol. 1 1681-1730, Author Carol Bryant.   Here is the relevant text from Land Records Vol. 1: Bond. Isaac Few &amp; Julian Few of the county of Chester, executors of the will of Richard Few, late of Chester county are holden &amp; firmly bound to Thomas Brassey &amp; Caleb Pussey of Chester county, yeomen for 500 pounds. Signed Isaac Few &amp; Julian Few. Delivered in the presence of George Churchman, Henry Brassey &amp; Lawrence Routh. Recorded 16 Aug 1678. (A1:B58)  Questions   What is the definition of Bond in this context? (I haven't been able to find a definition for 'Bond' in this context via google.) I presume that Richard Few bought his land from Thomas Brassey and Caleb Pussey, and still owed them 500 pounds at the time of his death. Is that right? (re: 'are holden &amp; firmly bound') Have Isaac Few &amp; Julian Few personally taken on the debt that Richard Few had with Brassey and Pussey? Or is it likely that it was paid out of Richard Few's estate?  Since the word 'Delivered' is used, does that indicate that Isaac &amp; Julian paid the debt on the spot? What does 'Recorded 16 Aug 1678' refer to?   Notes   I've tried to locate the will for Richard Few. I haven't found one yet, which led me to try looking at the land records instead... I did find an abstract for the will of a Isaac Few. In it Isaac Few renounces his son Richard Few. (My guess is that the Isaac Few referenced in the Land Records is a brother or son of Richard Few...)  "
470,Reading word on 1908 death certificate from New South Wales?,"Today I obtained the Death Certificate of my 2nd great grandfather Robert John Steven Sellers who died in Sydney on 18 Jan 1908.  In the picture below I am trying to read the middle of the three columns which is headed:     Where born and how long in the Australasian Colonies or States   I believe I have been able to make out all but one word (indicated by ??????).  Glasgow,  Scotland ?????? 4 years,  Victoria 29 years, South Australia 14 days,  N.S.Wales     What is the word on the line after Scotland (which I have shown much larger below)?  Could it just be ""About""?    Where born is actually incorrect because he was born 1854 in Albany, New York, USA of parents who were British Subjects (they married 1850 in Glasgow).  He did live in Victoria for 4 years (1874-1878), and South Australia for 29 years (1878-1907) plus a few days before the 14 days he spent on leave in NSW. "
471,Is Unregistered Death possible after 1900 in U.S.?,"I am researching my great uncle, James Barton (no middle initial), trying to find a death record. I believe he was living in Mt. Victory, Hardin County, Ohio in 1900.  I found a 'James Barton' married to Grace Barton with a child (Opalin) listed on this U.S. Census.    I believe this might be my great uncle as he was raised about 50 miles from Mt. Victory.  I know he died before 1910 and following Grace Barton's timeline, I found she remarried in 1910 - on her marriage record she was listed as a widow.  I'm assuming her husband, James Barton died and was buried in Mt. Victory, Ohio.   I have searched multiple on-line databases looking for a death record for my great uncle without success. I have searched in Ohio and surrounding states.  Have also done searches using alternative spelling of the last name.  I recently discovered and contacted the Hardin County Genealogy Society and they are researching to see if they have a death record that has not been indexed. The woman that responded to my email mentioned, '... if his death was recorded, we would have it.'   Is it possible in the U.S. for a death within a city / town to have not been recorded?    Another friend doing family research mentioned that sometimes 'you just can't find a death record'.  I don't understand why that would be possible in the 1900's in the U.S.  It seems there would have to be some kind of death record by a coroner or funeral home in order to bury someone.    UPDATE:  I received feedback from the Hardin County Historical Society and they could not find a death record for my great uncle James Barton.  The woman that responded said she knew of two doctors in Hardin county that 'refused to write death certificates unless they were paid to do so.'   Feedback from user2448131 to my initial inquiry was valuable (Thanks for that!) re: the State of Ohio not making death certificates mandatory until after 1908.  The website linked (Ohio Connections) listing a 'Barton James Sep 25, 1908 Franklin Vol. Sep-Oct/GR9231 Cert. 1936' was not my ancestor - the age at death was too old.  So without a death certificate, where do I look next to find a burial site or accurate date of death?  On the on the 1900 census James's mother claimed five living children, whereas on the 1910 Federal Census his mother claimed she had only four living children.   As I mentioned earlier, on the 1910 Federal Census, I found a James Barton married to Grace (Hall) Barton living in Mt. Victory, Ohio.  Grace Barton remarried in 1910 and the marriage certificate stated she was a widow.    As I've mentioned before, I've checked the major on-line databases (Ancestry, Family Tree, Ohio Vital Records, etc.) and can't find any burial listed for my great uncle.  Any further suggestions?

473,Seeking additional genealogy resources for New York between 1775 and 1850?,"Through Ancestry.com (US membership only - currently) I'm trying to determine if the Thompson side of my family tree tracks back to the McTavish clan of the Scottish Highlands since the name Thompson is apparently the anglicized version of McTavish.  So far, I haven't reached the point where my family crosses over to the US from Scotland, but so far I've traced them back to my great, great, great grandfather Reuben (Ruben) Thompson, born in 1833 in Springwater, Washington County, New York, USA.       I'm trying to find my great, great, great grandfather's father, presumably also named Reuben (misspelled ""Renben""), per the attached image of the Civil War ""Record of Soldiers and Officers in the Military Service"" document (seems he was a deserter!)  There are several Reuben Thompsons in New York and region around 1795-1805 but I can't make a definitive connection to my great, great, great, grandfather, Reuben Thompson, born approx. 1833. The census records from prior to 1850 did not include the names of the household members - only categorizing them by age, gender and status (non-slave or slave).    Are there other online sources in addition to the records available through Ancestry.com?    I am trying where I can find a connection between Reuben Thompson (b. 1833) and his father so I can continue the search backwards from the father?    I'm afraid if I choose the wrong Reuben Thompson to follow backwards, I'll be on a wild goose chase.

474,What would the starting shared cM number be for abnormally close relationships in Autosomal DNA test?,"I have seen in the examination of family trees where individuals sharing a great grand parent marry and have children, somewhat commonly in pre-American Civil War, which I would think would create some interesting confusion when examining Autosomal DNA (atDNA) results?  I have reviewed ISOGG's Autosomal DNA results chart on what to expect, and reviewed the prior questions ""Generational Loss with DNA testing"" &amp; ""Working with Autosomal DNA results"" but they do not address this or other close relationships (both illegal and taboo) on how that might look in an autosomal DNA result, knowing how this might 'look like' would be interesting reference information.  I will also first caveat that I realize that I am aware that more distant relationships will also influence shared cM results such as if you happen to share a relative 5 generations back and didn't know it. In this case I am looking for clarification on what the 'starting number' should be so I can use this for exploring theories about distant relationships as well as for 'orphan' situations.  Question: Has anyone seen a chart (or can produce one or explain) of how the following relationship's offspring would look like with a Autosomal DNA to a common individual?   Such Would you split the difference or still use the 50% rule to have the expected number of shared cMs?    2nd Cousins having a child  1st Cousins having a child  Uncle/Aunt &amp; Niece/Nephew having a child  Brother &amp; Sister having a child  Parent &amp; Child, having a child    In perhaps the easiest example the incest relationship of parent and child; assuming the child had the 3400 cMs of the involved parent (~50%) would their resulting child be higher than 3400 cMs of the involved parent or does other math come into play and by how much?  I am primarily looking for Autosomal shared cMs at this time vs. Autosomal and X, but if you can provide an explanation of X too great. "
475,Other 'non-loyalist' Immigration to Canada following American Revolution from the US,"I am trying to track down a few individuals that I believe may have immigrated to Canada following the American Revolution but before the War of 1812.  Assuming a primary motivation for moving to Canada following the American Revolutionary War was that you were a loyalist, I searched several of the common Loyalist Muster roles but so far not been able to find them or their known spouses.   I also looked at the existing answer to this question Relocating back to the US, 1830-1850: Would there be naturalization records about children born Canada to parents born in the US? Adult children?  The area was still relatively rural at the time and so I assume someone could just pick up and move to Canada at will without being documented.      Question: British Loyalist emigrations to Canada seemed fairly well documented, but if they were not a Loyalist what other documentation should I first be pursuing and checking for the time period that would document their immigration/naturalization/settlement of Americans to Canada?   Going into the American Revolution there were about 20 children of the family under 30 from different siblings believed to be living in the area. In the 1795 Census there is only a handful of head of households and graves do not exist in the area for all of the other individuals.  All I have to go on is mostly a rumor of them moving to Canada, but to cover my bases.   Some vague notes like ""believed they may have moved to Canada, but not sure"". The town of Catskill, New York (where the individuals I am researching were from) was completely razed by the British during the Revolutionary War and the family survived it in its entirety to the best of my knowledge and was there (those who were not fighting) the entire course of the war. Many of the family members are documented on the American side of the war; none have been found on British or Loyalist musters rolls. No graves exist for the individuals exist in the area to account for the difference in their numbers and names. The family otherwise mostly disappears out of American records except for a few, and a couple of those disappear and then reappear 20 years later. The Vetter Historical library says they have no information. A few of the family members were still present in 1790 and 1800 in the area, but by 1820 very few of them were still present (only one sibling and their children of many siblings). One of the siblings children eventually ended up in Michigan in the 1850s after serving in the US military in various campaigns. (who the parents were of these siblings is not clear currently). There are no ship manifests of them reverse immigrating to Europe, at least showing up in US records.   I also haven't found any records of them in Canada or anywhere else so far under the name they had in New York. They were at least 2nd or third generation Americans by this time (originally from a German speaking country) and from the records (family bible and Catskill records) appear to have spoken both some German and as well as English fluently.  Note: I will admit I do not have an International subscription to Ancestry.com or other sites but wanted to see if there were other resources I should check before expanding my subscription to specifically pursue additional information that may or may not exist.

First of all, I'm quite sure his last name is actually Marble, and I've seen this in a few other sources about his name. I don't have a birth date for his mother, Esther, but I do know she was born between 1778 and 1782. What I'm trying to figure out is if I can get an idea of Voleny's birthdate based on the fact that he was included in the will.   Edit: I should have included the actual will, which can be found at FamilySearch. I have included the section with his name, along with my attempt to transcribe, below.       And further I do give conditionally to my Grandson Volney Marvel the   sum of One hundred dollars in case my son Edward should decline to   give a good &amp; sufficient title of a certain piece of land lying in the   town of Charlestown in the County of Montgomery which he my son Edward   now has a title for &amp; in such case the said Volney is to pay to my son   Edward on the receipt of such Deed the sum of One hundred dollars,   then this gift to the said Volney is to be null &amp; void otherwise to be   paid out of my real estate after my decease.

478,Finding my Great-Grandfather when DNA test not conclusive?,"I am from Japan and I have been trying to identify my great-grandfather who was British.  For more background these are two questions that I have asked here previously:   Finding UK record(s) of British great-grandfather with children born in Japan during 1890s? Finding descendants of British great grand uncle who emigrated to Australia?   I have now taken a Family Finder DNA test (Autosomal DNA) but the results appear not to give any hints that will help me to identify my great-grandfather.   The DNA test says that I have a male cousin in Denmark and that this is three to five generations ago. However, I have not been able to make contact with him.   So three people were related to me. One Japanese man, one Japanese woman and Danish man. The two Japanese are more than 5 generations, while the Danish man is from 3 to 5 generation.  If the ancestors of this Danish man become known to me I think it will be very useful.       Is there another DNA test that I should take?   I did a Autosomal / Family Finder test of FamilyTree DNA.  I was matched with 3 people in FamilyTreeDNA. One person in the Danish, two people after is Japanese.  We'll explain the research that I have done. My great-grandfather was in Kobe of Japan in the 1890s. He was officially married and great-grandmother. However, I do not know his name.   As denoted in my other questions in addition to DNA testing I have...   1. I examined the foreigners who lived from the late 1880s until 1900 in Kobe.  2. So, I found a person who continued to live after that.  3. The person was Cecil Zohrab Ede.  4. I ordered the materials of Ede in Archives of the United Kingdom. As a result he was found to have died in Shanghai in 1901. And, he is a bachelor, his property his father has received.  5. I have heard that the great-grandmother went abroad with her husband.  6. So I examined the record of the boarding of the ship. And, I found that in 1893 Mr and Mrs Ede rode to the ship.  7. Because I cannot identify the great-grandfather in the record only, I was asked to test the FamilyTree DNA. When Ede brother offspring relationship if the registration is found I thought. "
479,"In the US, in the late 1800s and early 1900s, why did primarily the men only get naturalized?","In the US, in the late 1800s and early 1900s, why did primarily the men only get naturalized? Why didn't women get naturalized? I've heard some say it's because the citizenship status of the man is all that mattered but censuses still recorded the men as naturalized and the women as aliens, so surely it must have mattered to some extent.

480,"What was required to be entered into ""England, Cheshire, Land Tax Assessments, 1778-1832""","My ancestor, George Dutton, was in Cheshire, England, living there around 1800. I noticed he was in Coddington for a few years in the tax records (1796-1798), disappeared for a few years, got married in 1802 and seems to have returned to Coddington in 1803. In order to fully make sense of this, however, I'm trying to figure if there might have been an event that caused him to not be listed on the tax record for the years 1799-1802. I suspect he moved, met his wife to be, and decided to return to Coddington, but I don't understand enough about the Land Tax Assessment to really understand.  Bottom line, can someone explain what it takes to get mentioned in the tax assessment for a year? And are there any events that would cause a person to not be listed for a few years? "
481,Searching through family tree on Ancestry.com by LOCATION?,"If I want to find a particular person in my family tree on Ancestry, I use the field in the top right-hand corner of the screen that says ""Find a person in this tree"". A drop-down menu then appears, matching whatever I type, that can lead me to that person. But this is searching by NAME. What do I do if I want to search in my family tree by LOCATION?  Is there a way to easily find out who came from say, Cincinnati, or the state of Ohio, without clicking on each and every profile?  UPDATE: I just wanted to give better explanation as to why I need this feature. If I am on a genealogy research trip or if I pick up a community history book, my brain can only remember so many patriarchs/matriarchs for each location. It's challenging to remember all the names of uncles, cousins and neighbours to check also in a resource. It's great when you can plan ahead and prepare a list of people to look up, but sometimes you don't have time to plan ahead, before the resource is right in front of you. Then you may do a search for everything you can remember, but when you get home you later realize that you should have also looked for so-and-so. Or, I might be doing research and my brain might tickle and try to tell me that a location is important.. but it won't necessarily remind me exactly what, or who, I was supposed to remember to look for in that location. Since I have the Ancestry phone app, I can look up the location tags I've assigned really quickly and easily now. Brilliant solution! "

484,Did 19th century English women sometimes change the first name they used?,"I have some confusing, conflicting sources that suggest that the one woman went by two different names. They relate to the parents of Cyril Albert Victor House, born in 1897. His christening record indicates that he was the son of Albert and Martha House, christened in Kingswood, Gloucester, England.  The family turns up in the 1911 Census, stating that they had been married 19 years, so married in 1891 or 1892.  Cyril also turns up with his father Albert in the 1901 Census, but here Albert’s wife is called Pattie. The ages are more or less consistent and the birthplace (Bridport, Dorset) is the same. I can also find Albert and Pattie in the 1891 Census before Cyril was born.  I have been unable to find a marriage record for this couple in 1891–2. FreeBMD and Ancestry both turn up the same results for a search on Albert Edward House, one with an Annie Elizabeth Young, married in Keynsham, which is consistent with their location, but the ages of the spouses don’t match those of the couple I know from Census records, among other things. (The groom’s father’s name is also wrong, for a start – I am pretty sure I have identified Albert in earlier Census records.) The other is  with an Ellen Axten, married near London in Brentford. They turn up in a different 1901 Census record, with no child called Cyril, so they can’t be right.  So the lack of a marriage record is puzzling, but so is the apparent name change. If it hadn’t been for that “years of marriage” field in the 1911 Census, I might have assumed that this was a second marriage and that Martha was Cyril’s stepmother. But then why was she Martha in the christening record in 1897, but Pattie in 1901? Another possibility is that they never actually married legally, and Pattie changed her name to Martha to avoid family repurcussions.  So my question is, how common was it for women of this era to go by different names in different official records?    For what it's worth, I've found the marriage record - in 1889! Someone's arithmetic wasn't so good. Her maiden name was Martha Fowler, daughter of Samuel Fowler, a mariner. "
485,Where can I find information on buildings that have been demolished?,"I'd appreciate suggestions from anyone who has traced the history of houses, multi-family residences, and commercial buildings, on how to find more information about buildings which no longer exist.  One of the pieces of information I use when searching for my focus people and their cluster or FAN (friends/associates/neighbors) is the street address, both of their residences and of their places of employment.  In addition to recording any street address in my person-centric records like the census, BMD records, draft registrations, etc., I use City Directories and other resources associated with that place to see who else is living nearby and to trace who else might be employed at the same company.    If property tax records are online, I look at the city's record card showing what buildings are on the property, which can include notes about building style, an estimate of when the building was constructed, and photos of the buildings.  Some towns have tax maps which can be downloaded.   I also check the addresses against the USPS Zip Code finder, which will report back if the historical address is not currently deliverable.   Many of the families I am studying in the period from 1880 - 1930 lived in company housing which has since been torn down.  If I were in the town itself, I could go to the local public library, consult the historical society, or the local genealogical society.  And I would guess that there is a department in the city itself which would have issued permits for the building demolition, though the records may not be accessible, or still extant for buildings that vanished 100 years ago.  Q1: What might be a good way for a long-distance researcher to find out more about these buildings?  I'd like to find as much as I can on my own before I ask locals to do things on my behalf.    Q2: What other resources might there be for the local researcher? "
486,Run away to join the army,"I have my gggrandfather's military service record from the National Archives at Kew, showing his Royal Garrison Artillery service in the Crimean War.  It gives his place of birth as Montrose, Scotland and that he joined up in Newcastle.  It gives no next of kin.  I have been to the Scottish National Archives in Edinburgh and to Montrose and have found no birth, marriage or death of anyone with his surname within 50 years of the date of birth given on his military record.  Nor of any homophone of the surname that I can think of.  My only guess is that he ran away from home to join the army using a false name - and also probably age.  Is this theory probable?  How could I attempt to trace further back?  For example, are there likely to be missing persons records for the 1850s?  EDIT: I have found him in English censuses after he left the army, also his marriage and death certificates and the birth certificates of his children.  All these later documents are consistent with his military record.  I have found no trace on Scotland's People, LDS or anywhere else.   "
487,Identify people in 20th-century photos once the older relatives are gone?,"My husband and I, and our siblings, are now the oldest generation in our families.  We have photos which have been discovered or have come down to us when our parents died.  I have another friend who is younger than me who is in the same situation; she is researching her mother-in-law's family.  What can we do to identify the people in the photos?    Here's what I've considered so far:   Step 1: Try to date the photos. (There are many resources on the net about how to do this, including related questions here on SE, and my friend and I have already discussed this pretty thoroughly.) Step 2: Try to determine where the photos were taken, if not already known.  In some cases, I might be able to figure out candidates in the photos by checking known addresses of relatives against Google Street View. Step 3: Look for more distant cousins who might have other pictures to compare against. Step 4: Compare photos to other photos found online (yearbook collections, photos posted on Ancestry trees, newspaper photos, Dead Fred, Lost Faces, etc).     I haven't experimented with facial recognition software, so I don't know how effective that might be.  One especially challenging case -- my husband's family has a set of twins.  I don't know if they are identicals or fraternals.   If we were in our parents' hometown (sadly, we aren't) we could:    ask mom's neighbors, members of her church, or any related societies she might have belonged to (One might be able to find mom's neighbors from the period in the photos from city directories or the 1940 Census.  Obituaries can list social clubs -- my aunt's obituary is a masterpiece of genealogical writing in that respect.)  attend her school's reunion ask lodge members, if any of the relatives were members ask people in the same military unit, for relatives who were veterans attend meetings of the local historical society or genealogical society look for other photos in local libraries and local archives   Note: Several of these helpful suggestions for finding local people to consult came from @Canadian Girl Scout in today's weekly chat. Are there other obvious things I've missed?    Looking for houses and identifiable landmarks seems like a good place to start for the city photos, but I don't know what to do about the photos taken in a rural setting.  I'd especially welcome suggestions there for my friend in the Midwest.  @Canadian Girl Scout suggested agricultural societies as one possibility. "
488,How would you handle a census record that is almost certainly the target family but which has too many discrepancies?,"Anna M. Alischer married Charles John Brockhouse in 1928 and had 3 children (1930, 1934, 1942). In 1930 they were enumerated in Beaver Falls, Beaver County, Pennsylvania.  I think I've identified the family's 1940 census enumeration in White Township, Beaver County, Pennsylvania, but I am reluctant to enter the data. There are too many discrepancies for all to be copy errors by the enumerator, who was not careless with the other families that I have evaluated on that census sheet. The informant is marked and should have been knowledgable about the family.  How I have handled the record to date:    I have added the census record in the person notes with a table discussing the conflicts. The (1940) census event has been left open, as if no record had been found.  I have investigated to determine whether individuals with details matching the 1940 census household appear in other records. I have not found any of them. I might add the event citation if additional evidence turns up - for instance, school attendance or land ownership records - showing that the target family was indeed living on Steffin Hill Road between 1935 and 1945.

Printed index to New York City deaths including Queens is cataloged   under: New York (New York). Department of Health. Index to deaths, New   York City, 1888-1965.      Certificates are arranged by certificate number and filing date, not   by date of death.   The two cases from 1902 and 1904 seem relatively straightforward.  I have the search results with the names, death dates, and certificate numbers.  The catalog descriptions seem clear; I should be able to tell which films to view  if I want to see the certificates.  From this catalog description I see that when I have access to the film, without a name index I need to browse by certificate number within each film.    Am I right in assuming that there is no cross-reference of films in the catalog to those with images online, so that if I find a film on that catalog page, to find a death record,  I have to go back 'home', select records, and see what might be online?    As I write this, there is a name index ""New York Deaths and Burials on FamilySearch.org 1795-1952"" but no images yet.  Given a particular film number, is there any way (besides a brute-force method like a Google Search) to determine if the images are online? "
490,What New York City vital records are covered by this index on FamilySearch?,"When records have been extracted and indexed, but the images are not available online, how can I find out more information about how the index was made, and what fields were on the original records?  I am researching a death in College Point, Queens, in 1897 (before the 1898 consolidation of the boroughs into greater New York City).  I have a record which appears on FamlySearch.org as part of a B-batch in the New York-EASy records, indexed as part of the collection ""New York Deaths and Burials, 1795-1952"".  There is a film number, but no image.       Indexing Project (Batch) Number:  B59629-7   System Origin: New York-EASy    GS Film number:   1376367    Reference ID:     rn729   Could the ""rn"" in the reference ID be 'register number'?  Cross-checking with the catalog tab on Family Search, I can see how to order film 1376367, but what is this reference ID? It is not in the same format as the certificate numbers from his mother and aunt's deaths in post-consolidation NYC, but that could be an artifact of the change from records that were kept in each borough versus a consolidated system for NYC as a whole.    How can I find out more information about the EASy batches, and determine what this reference ID might be?      Edited to add what I've discovered so far via catalog search:  Looking the records up in the catalog, film number 1376367 consists of multiple items.  To get College Point, what I need is this item: Record of births and deaths, 1881-1898 /     Flushing (New York). The film notes say:     Index to village of College Point deaths Angerine - Zwiecke 1889-1897   -  FHL US/CAN Film [ 1378869 Item 2 ]   and the notes section says:      Microfilm of original records at the Municipal Archives, New York, New   York. Includes registers from the town of Flushing, 1881-1898; the   village of Flushing, 1889-1898; the village of Richmond Hill,   1895-1897; the village of College Point, 1889-1897; the village of   Whitestone, 1889-1897; the village of Rockaway, 1897-1898; and the   village of Far Rockaway, 1889-1897.   So this does tell me the kind of record (registers, not certificates) that will be seen on the microfilm, and the provenance, and that there is an index on the microfilm as well.  What I don't know yet are the fields, i.e., the column headings in the College Point registers.  I'll revisit some of the personal sites about Queens genealogy that I've bookmarked, the New York Public Library, the Queens Public Library, the State Archives, etc. to see if I can find an answer. "
491,"How to find parents of Elizabeth Meyers (1820-1880), wife of the Amish Benjamin Miller in 19th Century Pennsylvania?","Amish and Amish Mennonite Genealogies (Gingerich &amp; Krieder, 1986) gives an Elizabeth Meyers (born 13 Oct 1820 and died 17 Oct 1880) as the wife of Benjamin Miller (1816-1888, of the Christian Miller lineage). She was born and died in Somerset County, PA, and buried at the Miller Burial Ground in Paint, PA. Benjamin Miller and Elizabeth were married in about 1837. But, I can't find anything more about her or about her parents, other than the 1880 US census where it's noted that both of her parents were also born in Pennsylvania.  Husband Benjamin's ancestry is well-documented, but it's always harder to follow these maternal lines. I can't find anything obvious in census or other information. Does anyone have further clues, or suggestions for where to find them? "
492,First wife / birth mother left out of history?,"Alice Bell Snider (b. 28 Jul 1867, d. 8 Feb 1945 in Henry Co., Iowa) is listed in family records (and indeed in other people's records online) as the daughter of George W. Snider (1839-1905) and Martha Davison (1845-1908). The only problem is that George and Martha were married in Nov 1874, and waiting seven years after the birth of a child seems incredibly unlikely in conservative rural Iowa.  In fact, the 1870 Census shows George with a 3-year-old Alice and infant brother Edward (which matches up), but wife Mary Snider, age 26. By 1880, Alice is 12, Edward is 10, there is a new 1-year-old Orville — and wife Martha, age 34.  This all seems completely consistent with second marriage — and I found a 1865 marriage record that matches: George W. Snyder and Mary Greer, Washington Co., Iowa, United States . The change from i to y is a bit suspect, though, for official records (both census records are Snider). The 1870 census has the family in Missouri (confirmed by the 1885 Iowa census which has that as Edward's birthplace). So, perhaps they moved to Missouri after Alice's birth and then the family returned after Mary died?  Besides that, though, it's a mystery. Other than that marriage record and the census clues, I can't find any mention of her anywhere. Where might I look next in a case like this, where the first wife is apparently ""masked out"" by the second? "
493,Understanding Bessarabia for genealogy?,"My grandparents, Albert Miller (Müller), born 1901, and Maria Staubert, born 1905, grew up in nearby villages in Beassarabia, perhaps Leipzig and another.   They met and and  married in 1925 (I believe in Leipzig). They made 2 attempts to immigrate to  Canada. The first however was stopped by the Navy when they learned my grandfather was a trained blacksmith. They were taken off the boat and sent back for him to work in the Navy. Their second attempt was successful.   My grandfather, pregnant grandmother and their one daughter, Tilly, departed from the Black Sea en route to Halifax, Nova Scotia, where they arrived May 13, 1927. They then took a train to Hannah, Alberta Canada where they had 7 children in total, 3 of whom are still living.  My grandmother, Maria was born to Nicolas and Katerina Staubert. Maria however, may have been known by the last name Keen. When her mother became sick and died, she was taken away from her father and her brother, and sent to live with the Keen family. It was apparently considered unsuitable for her father to raise her and shame was put upon them.  I believe she may have had step siblings within the Keen family however, from my understanding, never felt truly accepted. She never actually knew her brother or that she even had one. She only assumed she had one as she remembered seeing a family photo at one point where she was a baby and there was a young boy of about 2 or 3.  My grandfather Albert had a brother Reinhold Müller.   This is all I know about their history before they arrived in Canada.   I would like to know where Leipzig would be considered now? Moldova, Romania, Ukraine? "
494,Searching marriage records for London by witnesses?,"Today a key piece of information about my 4th great grandmother Sarah Osment Smyth came to my attention when @ValerieFennell wrote:     I have Sarah Osment Smyth as witness at the marriage of James Smith,   Felter and Hatter of Tooley Street Bermondsey to Sarah Jones on the   30th January 1787. Sarah's brother Nathaniel also a Felter &amp; Hatter   was the other witness.I would be grateful if anyone could shine a   light on this, I can't find the parents of James.   It reminded me that people often say ""don't forget to check the witnesses"", and I usually try to figure out the relationship of the witnesses to a marriage that involves the people I am interested in.  In this case it is a marriage I might never have been interested in except for now learning that Sarah Osment Smyth witnessed it.  I would now like to try and find out what other marriages Sarah and her future husband John Stacy, who was also from Bermondsey may have witnessed.  I am aware of a former Q&amp;A, Status of Ted Wildy&#39;s UK Marriage Witness Index?, which discusses searching marriage indexes using witnesses but Sarah and John are not from Cornwall, and no marriages that Sarah witnessed show up in FREEREG.  Is there any index of London marriages that includes Bermondsey which can be searched using witnesses? "
495,Am I part Canadian?,"If my dad and grandma were both born in Canada but my grandfather was born in the US, does that mean I am part Canadian?    They are all US citizens and all my ancestors after my grandma came from other places.    If so how much would the percentage be? "
496,Updating Surname Chart of Male-Line descendants in form of tree?,"I have an old Family Tree or Chart that dates back many centuries. It is a Surname Chart of Male-Line descendants in the form of a tree.  It flows from the bottom upward and the trunk of the tree is the eldest Son of the eldest Son and so on.  The branches are the remaining siblings which branch off to their siblings and so on.    What type of tree is this and where do I find information on the proper protocol?    It was completed back in 1930 and I would like to update it.   Thank You Christia for your answer on my question.  When I saw an email come through from Stack Exchange, I had no idea what it was.  After reading it, I realized that it was an answer to my question posted over a year ago.  I had forgotten about it completely.  Based on what you are saying, I believe my Great Aunt Daisy (1878) might have hired Mr. Meloy, or another artist, to draw up this tree the way she wanted it.  I believe she might have had it done as a gift for her Brother, my Grandfather, Frederick George Sherman (1896).  Their Father, George Sherman (1852) as well as my Grandfather are on the trunk of this tree.  My Father, Russell Lester Sherman (1918) being the oldest of four, is on the truck as well.  My Brother, Alan Wilber Sherman (1942) is the oldest of five and is also on the trunk. This is where the trunk stops.  I, William T Sherman (1955) am the youngest of five and a branch off my Dad’s trunk.  Two of my Brother Alan’s three Children are branches off his trunk and that’s where it stops. My Brother Alan had one Son, William Asa Sherman (1964) and two Daughters.  William has been married and has Children, but no Sons.  Next in line would be my Brother, Curtis Martin Sherman (1949), who had no Children.  I would be next in line and had a Son, Jeffrey T Sherman (1980) who has a Son Preston T Sherman (2004).  So my question is, is it the correct protocol to place myself on the trunk, My Son on the trunk and his Son on the trunk?  Or is there no correct protocol for this type of work and simply just the interpretation of an artist, in which case I can present it whichever way I please?  I do have a location for the original Arthur Sherman Meloy work located at the New York Public Library and plan on getting copies or pictures of it in the near future.  Thank You for your time and knowledge on this subject. "
497,"Two ships, two manifests, same passengers?","I knew that my great-grandmother arrived in the US from Italy in about 1914. When I searched the Ellis Island database I found her easily. Unfortunately, I found her twice. Let me be specific. My great-grandmother, her daughter and her niece are all listed on two different ship's manifests, one (the Berlin) arriving in NY Jan 22, 1914, and the other (the Carpathia) arriving in NY Mar 22, 1914.  There is no question that these are the documents of the same women. Aside from the names being the same, so are the ages, the listed relationships, the (very small) town of origin, the person and place to which they were traveling--are all the same. It also does not seem to be an indexing problem of one manifest having been duplicated accidentally. The pages are different, the handwriting is different and the pages have each ship's name in the header.  How could something like this occur? Assuming that it was extremely unlikely for all three women to have traveled by ship from Italy to the US twice in 2 months, my assumption is that some sort of fraud was involved. Could my relatives have sent their papers back to Italy to be re-used by another group of women of similar age? Did that sort of thing happen often? Does anyone have any other possible explanation?  And, what kind of papers would have been required for immigrants at that time, anyway? "
498,"In 1888, what does ""smothering at the heart"" mean?","The following is the front side of a surgeon's certificate for my 3x-great grandfather (and part of a civil war pension application for his widow).  It was created in 1888.  At one point, he describes his condition by saying     I have something of a smothering at my heart once in a while.   I have never heard this expression before, but my guess is that it means he sometimes has a hard time breathing because his chest becomes tight (as though someone were ""smothering"" him ""at his chest"").  Does this seem right?  Is the some reliable source that explains this phrase?  There is only one search result on Google for the this phrase, and it comes from a play written in 1800.    Image   Full page image can be viewed here.  Transcript     Pulse rate per minute, 102; respiration, 24; temperature, 98.2; height, 5 feet 10 inches; weight, 175 pounds; age, 54 years.      He makes the following statement upon which he bases his claim for    original:   I have it in my back and legs so bad that it   sometimes lays me up for a week at a time   I have some knots on my legs from Rheumatism   I have something of a smothering at my heart once   in a while.  Don’t know whether from Rheumatism   or not.  Rheumatism sometimes also affects my   shoulder      Upon examination we find the following objective conditions: No deformity   or change of structure anywhere excepting a very slight   soft puffiness in both popliteal places.   There is a slight crepitation in both shoulder   joints although he is not complaining of   any pain in either.  There is no change   in area of heart but his pulse is 102 at rest   and as high as 120 during examination.  It   doesn’t seem to be irregular in any way more   than rapid.  We detect no abnormal sound.   We believe this is the result of Rheumatism   Dis  10/18      From the existing condition and the history of this claimant, as stated by himself, it is, in our judg-   ement, ____________ probable that the disability was incurred in the service as he claims, and that it has   not been prolonged or aggravated by vicious habits.  He is, in our opinion, entitled to a 10/18   rating for the disability caused by Irritable heart Result of Rheumatism  "
499,Can I determine the relationship between Mary Anne Wright (nee Harper) and Charles William Kimmons?,"In the 1901 census for England, Mary Ann Wright (nee Harper) was living in Kings Norton, Worcestershire (not Birmingham) with her husband Stanley and her children.  In the 1911 census she's shown as a widow (which was untrue -- see Finding an elusive ancestor after the 1901 census (who may have deserted his family)) boarding with some of her children with a Charles Kimmons at 1 Eton Road Balsall Heath, Worcestershire. Charles is shown as age 32 (also a widower) and she as age 40 (which is probably understated -- she seems to have been born around 1865 although I haven't found a birth record yet, but she was married in 1883).  So fair enough, she's found a place to board after her husband has moved on, and Charles Kimmons is her landlord.  In 1919 at his marriage, Mary Ann's son Bob is shown as resident at 49 Gough Street, Greet, Birmingham.  And in 1920 she's registered as a voter at 49 Gough Street, Greet, Birmingham. Also registered as voters there: Bob Wright and his wife Dorothy, and (!!) Charles Kimmons.  And she shows up at the same address in successive electoral rolls until 1930,  with her son Bob and his wife (before they move out to Medley Road sometime between 1925 and 1927 when my father was born there). And every time Charles [William] Kimmons is listed on the electoral roll at the same address.  She dies there in 1932 and the next trace of Charles Kimmons is on the electoral roll at Medley Road (but not the address where my father was born) in 1939, and then in the 1939 register at the same address, apparently a boarder. He continues to show up on the electoral registers at various addresses until 1955 and apparently dies in 1956.  Mary Ann is always shown as having an Occupational qualification to vote and Charles Kimmons is shown as having a Residential qualification.  It may be significant that Mary Ann always appears first in the electoral roll from 1920 -- but in every other entry I've looked at the property owner or (male) head of the household appears first.  One possibility is that Charles Kimmons moved house some time between 1911 and 1919 and she moved with her family, still as a Boarder.    Another possibility is that there was a less commercial relationship between them.  How likely is it that a family boarding in 1911 would move with their 'landlord' to another property?  Where else might I look to shed some light on the situation?    A potted history of Charles William Kimmons' life -- oh, the joy of an unusual name to research:  There's a civil birth registration that seems to be him in 1881 in Yardley, Birmingham, and the 1939 register shows him as having been born on 25 October 1881. There are militia/military records for him in 1900 (joining the Royal Warwickshire Regiment -- militia) and transferring full-time to the Royal Welsh Regiment in 1901 for 7 years (he states in 1901 that he isn't married).  He was transferred to the Army Reserve in 1909 and discharged in 1913. He must have re-enlisted at some point as he has a medal card for service in France from 1/1/18 with the YMCA corps. According to the electoral rolls -- as above -- he's resident at various addresses in Birmingham from 1920 to 1955 and there's a civil death registration which is probably his in 1956).  I have not found a marriage for him in the Civil Registration indices for England and Wales -- the marriage in 1898 of Charles William Kimmins to a Grace Thirza is not his. He may have married overseas (I don't have access to the relevant subscription services) or he may not have married at all and lied in the 1911 census that he was a widower. "

501,"Linking Sojourners to Illegitimacy at Launceston, Cornwall in 1790s?","I've traced some relatives to Cornwall in the late 1790s,1800's. If I'm right, the first children born to the couple in question were born illegitimately in St Thomas by Launceston, and the remainder born in St Stephens by Launceston. Looking at a map, would I be right in thinking that they are almost the same place? Just a couple of miles apart?  After the first two children are born in St Stephens in 1796 and 1798, the people I presume are the parents are listed as being married in St Thomas, as sojourners, and the rest of the children are born there. I'm guessing the first two children may have been born out of wedlock, and the parents moved away slightly to marry, and had the remaining children thereafter. Would that be the possible meaning of sojourners?   The couple in question are Thomas Peardon (born 1796 St Thomas) and his wife Mary. Their first child Thomas was born in 1796 St Thomas, according to the census of 1841, 51, 61, 71. (I have also found a Thomas PARDON born to the parents Thomas and Mary in St Stephens in 1794 though). I have his sister Mary born in St Thomas in 1797 according to England Births and Christenings, 1538-1975.  Then in England, Phillimore Marriage Registers, 1531-1913, I have the marriage of Thomas Peardon and Mary Jewell at St Stephens in 1801, listed as sojourners. They have already had a son Richard Peardon, born 1801 in St Stephens, according to England, Select Births and Christenings, 1538-1975, and then two more sons, William and Robert, in 1803 and 1806 in St Stephens.  So did they have two children in St Thomas, move to St Stephens to get married and then have the remaining children? "
502,Setting inclusion criteria for a one-place study?,"In my limited spare time I have embarked on a one-place study for my village. This has started out compiling various censuses and parish registers, and now I am in the process of creating a database of persons from the village. The goal is to create a database of the village population over time.  However, I have had some questions about who to include in the study database.  For example, there are people who are lodgers or servants on one census, and appear in no other records. Censuses are just a snapshot in time – the person may have left the village the next day. There are also people who appear in one baptism or marriage record in the village, but never again. I have the additional difficulty that the parish boundaries have changed over the years; the civil parish now includes several villages and hamlets, which again makes it difficult to know who to include.  Now I understand that it will largely come down to personal preference, but the scientist in me would like to formalise who I am to include in the study. I don't envisage this study as including everyone who happened to set foot in the village – that is simply unfeasible.  How should I go about setting my inclusion criteria? What do other one-place studies do? "
503,Why are the lengths GEDmatch.com Chromosome Segment Matching segments not proportional to their cM?,"The GEDmatch.com Chromosome Segment Matching report has the following legend:    One of my reports has the following triangulation match:    The purple segment (&lt; 5 cm) is 102912701 - 111046063 (4.189 cM) and the green segment (10-20 cM) is 149430788 - 154663050 (11.939 cM).  Since the green segment is almost 3 times as many cM, why does the visual show the purple segment being almost twice as long?  Is the match somehow spread out with bits of non-matching portions mixed in, thus getting elongated?  Also, what does the F2 type mean (not show in image)?  I'm getting F2 on each matching person's table entry above the graphic such as the shown one above.  Does such a matching segment mean the two kits are identical in the regions shown? "
504,Strategy to find death of individual with common name?,"I thought I had found the death certificate for my grandfather Thomas Jones (born 1905) but the recent availability of the 1939 register and the Midlands Electoral Rolls have proven me wrong (see Back to the Drawing Board if you want to review the gory details of how I know I'm wrong).  I now have the challenge of finding a death record for an individual with a very common name.  What strategy should I adopt and which records should I search? And if I find a likely record, what corroboration might I look for?  What I do know (or have I been told):   My eldest sister (born 1946) ""remembers him running his beard across her stomach""; his death followed by his mother's death led to a significant change in the circumstances of her and her mother after she was 4 (in 1950).  Or possibly his mother died first... She does think he lived with her and her mother and his parents at sometime at a particular address in Birmingham, which isn't an address I have the family recorded at... yet. (My assessment: my sister was aged 0-5 at the time of her great-grandmother's death in 1951 so the order of events is unreliable. She does however have an account of 4-5 years after the last death before she returned to her mother (and step-father in 1956). He was recorded ""deceased"" at my mother's marriage in 1954. (My assessment: this is often a convenient fiction to explain why an inconvenient parent isn't present but it does fit in with my sister's account). My mother and her grandparents (his parents) lived in Birmingham, England from (at the latest) 1942 until 1954 (although her grandparents died in Birmingham in 1948 and 1951). (My assessment: these records are probably sound, as they tie up by address with other events around the same time in the family) He is not buried in the same grave in Merthyr Tydfil, Wales (where he was born) as his wife (died 1931) and his parents. He was not registered in 1939 at his parent's address in Merthyr Tydfil so was possibly in the Army by then. My mother suggested that he'd been a peacetime soldier before WW2 and maybe afterwards. (I'm awaiting his service record). There's a family 'legend' that he died in an asylum or mental hospital in London from the results of drink possibly Barts but maybe Bethlem or the Maudesley (My assessment: this will have originated with my mother, who could knit convincing stories out of fog but usually with a grain of truth)    I'm hoping for a comprehensive answer that will be of value to others with the same problem in England and Wales.

505,"Seeking immigration record John Redonnett, born in France, who came to US ca 1840s?","John Redonnett appears to have come to the US circa the 1840s but can you suggest where I could look for more information?  Two records indicate that he was born in France.   He is in the 1850 US Census which suggests that he was born in 1822:      ""United States Census, 1850,"" database with images, FamilySearch   (familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:M6J1-PTK : 9 November 2014), John   Redonnett, Bristol, Lincoln, Maine, United States; citing family 525,   NARA microfilm publication M432 (Washington, D.C.: National Archives   and Records Administration, n.d.).

506,"Meaning of ""Tuesday last"" and ""Monday week""?","I'm reading a newspaper article from Friday, 10 Feb 1843, from the Coventry Herald:    In the births, marriages, and deaths column, dates are commonly represented as ""On the 2nd inst."" or ""On the 29th ult."". These are straightforward:   inst. is an abbreviation for instant, meaning of the current month (2nd Feb in the example given) ult. is an abbreviation for ultimo, meaning of the last month (29th Jan)   But I always have trouble interpreting less obvious descriptions of dates, such as:   ""On Tuesday last,..."" ""On Monday week,...""   Does Tuesday last mean the most recent Tuesday (7th Feb), or the Tuesday of last week (31st Jan)? Similarly does Monday week refer to the current week (6th Feb) or the prior week (30th Jan)?    This terminology seems to be commonly used in BMD notices throughout the country at least through the first half of the 19th century. Another example containing multiple uses of the ""Monday week""-type terminology is the following column from the Bradford Observer, 14 Feb 1839 (click for large image):   "
507,Handling theories in Genealogy Software?,"I happen to use Family Tree Maker, but I don't think my question is software specific.  I am using cluster genealogy to solve a particularly difficult problem.  As a part of this process, I have defined a number of theories of varying levels of confidence that I am trying to prove or disprove.    I find it very useful to create a these theories or scenarios in Family Tree Maker because I sometimes need to see things put together to decide if it makes sense.  However, I don't want to pollute my main family tree with guesswork.  Currently, I've been creating additional alternate trees for each theory and sync'd them to ancestry.com.  I've kept these trees in ancestry.com private so no one confuses them as being the Truth.  The problem here is that there is a LOT of duplication between these various Theory trees and setting them up and propagating new facts across all of them is a pain.  What is the best way to go about modeling theories?  Should I just do that outside the scope of my genealogy software?  The question on Transitioning from person-based genealogy to record-based genealogy? is related to my question, but not exactly.  I know most of my people, I am not sure about their relationships. "

509,Why is my ancestor missing from the New GRO Index - England?,"I found my 2x great-grandmother on the 1901 and 1911 censuses.   Norah O'Brien Abt 1861 or 1866 St Albans  1901 census [website]1911 census [website]She married George Edward Goode in 1901.  Both of them say something different about her birthplace and her approximate year of birth.  One says 1861 and one says 1866 the places are different too: St Albans, Middlesex (this place does not exist) St Albans  I tried to search in the New GRO Index for the different years and places and she is not there. [website]I think I found her death certificate.   It says her father was John O'Brien on her marriage certificate but there is no other information. How can I find her birth certificate if it's not in the index? "
510,How many years back are these Gedmatch European matches?,"I got many matches on the Gedmatch website that are from the same heritage background (Irish/English/Dutch/German/Spanish/French). The total cM of shared DNA runs from 10 to 32 cM.  The most common chromosome of all the matches and me is chromosome 15 and all the matches' connections' go back from 4 to 7 generations.  My question is that I am from Algeria. I have 13% Iberian (Spanish and Portuguese) DNA and 56% North African (Amazigh) and 20% Middle East and the Levant (Arab) and 9% African.  I was wondering is these people who matched with me mean that I have a foreign 4’s grandfather or grandmother from those countries and how many years this common ancestry goes back.  Or if these far away connections are normal in Algerian people?  I read that Amazigh Berber DNA have some Irish in them but is this the reason that I have those matches or does it have to be a closer relationship to have many matches like that? Note that the largest cM shared is 32 cM.  I had another bigger one on Family Tree DNA at 46 cM.  I also read about how the Barbary slave trade refers to the slave markets that were lucrative and vast on the Barbary Coast of North Africa, which included the Ottoman provinces of Algeria.  At that time they took people from Ireland and Europe as slaves to North Africa  between the 16th and the middle of the 18th century.  After that the French occupation of Algeria started.  So am really not sure where this blood line started, I would appreciate any help. "

512,Identification of an old postcard,"A question quite very similar to this one. I have an old postcard, probably around WW2 era, probably sent from Germany. Unfortunately this postcard is empty when it comes to handwriting or otherwise personal elements:      This postcard may be the only existing element to identify a missing person in my family tree and thus the most important part for me is to identify the age of this post card or a year when it was published. Which could allow to estimate the year this postcard was actually sent and by this -- to verify or reject the suggestion that this particular person (assumed to be the one, who sent this card) was living and that given age.  I managed to figure out that this particular postcard includes a reproduction of Carl von Bergen's painting -- one of many around ""feeding the ducks"" theme (like this one or this one).  The painting is titled ""Jugend vom Lande"" (""Youth in the country""), marked ""Made in Germany"" and ""number 1158"" though I don't know if this is Carl von Bergen's painting number or postcard number. I am unable to recognize publisher marking (lower left side of revers of the card).  Most of Carl von Bergen's works were painted by the end of nineteenth century or in the beginning of twentieth century, but this says nothing about the year of publication of this postcard or about the date, it was sent.  Can anyone help in this case? "
513,Are the Shoreditch Board of Guardians records for St. Leonards Workhouse online anywhere?,"I'm trying to find information on someone who was born in October 1910 at 204 Hoxton Street, Shoreditch (London, UK) which I have come to learn was the St. Leonards workhouse and hospital.  The short question is - where could I find records of him and his mother for this?  At the National Archives page for St. Leonards it directs you to the LMA. But I've read older forums of people accessing the records online there? Has this now stopped?  At the London Metropolitan Archives for St Leonards Hospital H19/SL it says      ""For the administration of Shoreditch Workhouse and Infirmary 1867-1930 and for registers of inmates in the workhouse and infirmary see the records of Shoreditch Board of Guardians""   On the LMA page for that collection it says that all the records are available on Ancestry.co.uk.  The records I think I want are:  Register of patients, males 1906 00-1910 SHBG/149/013 Register of patients, males 1910 00-1912 SHBG/149/012 Register of patients, female 1908 -1912 SHBG/149/027      but I'm finding it confusing to locate these records online. I've recently done other research on the Islington Workhouse and this made much more sense. I'm wondering if the Shoreditch records were either partially lost or destroyed, or whether Ancestry hasn't finished putting them online? UPDATE: all records a labelled as ""Physical Condition: Fit"" by the LMA.  I know some of these are not transcribed, and I've been browsing the images manually.  Ancestry in this case doesn't have the above references, it uses a USA code, so it's hard to correlate the sources except by name.  I've got a premium membership (not sure if it alters which catalogues are available?), but when I look at the list of catalogues, there doesn't seem to be a Guardians section like there is for the other workhouses.      If you browse the Shoreditch records, you get some of the name-indexed admissions records - which I've come to understand were a recompilation of the primary book which itself was in date order as people arrived and departed.    However this only goes up to 1903.  Scrolling down there is an ""other"" section which does go through 1910, but when I browsed through these images (under G mostly) while there are hundreds of entries for 1908 and other years, suddenly there are only three or four names in 1909, 1910, 1911. Then picks up again in 1912/1913, but it's not like there's pages missing in the archive, it's more like the hospital was closed during this period? They were still recording admissions but only very few.    It's frustrating - as all the records seems to skip exactly the year I'm looking for!  Looking at the last 1903 book, it does have the LMA reference on a sticker on the book. I want SHBG/149/012 and 13, it does seem like the next two books are simply not on Ancestry?    I have also asked Ancestry, but they seem slow to reply. "

515,Proper way to record mother's maiden name in Gramps 5?,"It's not clear to me how both surnames should be entered for women who took their husbands surname when they married. On some genealogy websites I often see married women's names displayed in the format:  first middle maiden surname  I like how the maiden name is rendered in italic. I don't know if that's a convention or not, but I think it makes it easy to understand where the different parts of the name came from, and I'd like to eventually produce a document with names in this format.  I looking at the Gramps interface I see a two different ways I could enter names like this:   Enter the birth name in the preferred name fields in the Person dialog, and enter just the last name as the married name under the ""Names"" tab. The same as number one, but enter the married name as the preferred name, and the birth name as the other name.   Which way should the names be entered? Is there a convention for entering names like this? Additionally, when entering the married and birth names, should I specify the full name in both places?  Edit: The Gramps 5 interface is nearly identical to Gramps 4 from what I can tell. "

521,Historical Census and Authenticity,"I am wondering if anyone knows of cases of where a household might have claimed a member even if they did not live there? For example, I am looking at an individual in New Hampshire in 1850, but there is someone with almost identical details in California at the time. I am wondering if it might be a reasonable assumption that the (respectable) NH family would have claimed her still being at home (because the CA individual was not respectable) and if that was common enough or easy to do at all.  I am aware that the point of being fraudulent is not to be caught, but does anyone know of similar incidents? "

John &amp; Bridget Gillece   This is the baptism of Mary Moore, whose parents were Henry Moore and Margaret (nee Gillece). The second line is the sponsors (godparents), John and Bridget Gillece, who may have been related to Margaret.   My question regards the partially obscured phrase in parentheses in the sponsor line, which I'm having trouble reading/parsing. As it looks like ""per something"", I assume it's a Latin phrase, and the second word may be an abbreviation. I've looked for a few pages either side and can't see another baptism with a similar parenthetical note, so it may not be a particularly common usage.  ""per pro"" (per procurationem) is a possibility, generally used for writing on the behalf of someone else, but how would that make sense in a baptism record? What else might it be? "

529,On what ship did Franz Joseph Kerber (1825-1873) immigrate to the US?,"Franz Joseph Kerber was born in Jan 1825 in Munich, Barvaria. In the 1860 census he was married and my greatgrandmother had been born in 1858. In 1862, he ran the saloon at 82 Front St in Worcester, MA. His wife was also from Germany but from Wertheim and I believe emigrated in 1848 (I'll save her for a different question). They were married in Greenfield, MA (60 mi northwest of Worcester).  Franz (born 1825) was the son of another Franz Joseph Kerber who I believe was born December 20, 1791 in Bayern, Germany and died 1866 in Greenfield, MA. It's possible they immigrated together to the US or it's possible one followed the other.  The timeframe appears to be 1826-1858 and the two endpoints are Germany/environs to probably Boston.  I have not yet put serious effort into this particular task (finding the voyage/ship he immigrated on) and am asking for help in high value places to focus my research.  I have spent some time last year (pre-genealogy.se) at The American Antiquarian Society in Worcester, MA and with google, americanancesors.com, Ellis Island (before realizing timeframe was wrong) websites. Recently I've searched a wider range of sites due to help from the answers to this question - but still have quite alot to do  wrt some of the suggestions already mentioned in answers below and in What details are needed about ancestor to uncover ship they immigrated to America on?.

530,"What does ""privately baptised"" mean in a Welsh parish register of 1799?","The parish register for St. Dogwells, Pembrokeshire has the following entry for 1799:    There is no burial record in this or an adjacent parish church in Wales for an infant John James between 1799 and 1802 with the correct parents.  In the 10 year period in this parish from 1791 - 1800, 9 out of 53 baptisms were recorded as ""privately baptised""; the other 44 were recorded as ""publickly baptised"" or ""baptised"". Of the private baptisms, 3 were followed within a few months by public baptisms.   So: what is the meaning of the phrase ""private baptism""?  A little family context: Thomas James (circa 1768 - 1851) born Llanfair Nant Y Gof, Pembrokeshire and his wife Anne Scourfield (circa 1778 - 1852) born St. Dogwells were married on 3rd April 1798 in St. Dogwells.  I know of at least three children (including this one) but this is the only baptism record I can find for one of the children, which is probably because they were Baptists.

532,Finding records about Germans from Russia (Bessarabia)," Many of my German ancestors seem to have come from a place called Plotzk, Bessarabia.

I am wondering what the earliest publication of a genealogy ""How To"" book might be. Was it published in English or some other language?

Since there seem to be a million books out nowadays that show you how to do genealogy, it's difficult to weed out the current from the first. Can anyone help?

536,Support for variants of family-unit,"I hope everyone will agree that the definition of a ""family unit"" is very subjective. Although many products, and the old GEDCOM format, offer some type of FAM record, I have never seen an agreed definition of it.  Most of us have found family groups where not all the relationships are full-blood ones, or simple parent-child ones, and these may include step children, second spouses, adopted children, in-laws, etc  One convoluted example goes as follows: father deserts household, youngest children put in industrial school, wife has relationship with new man, new man has existing children but new ones born to pair of them, deserted wife dies, partner starts relationship with new woman.  In order to cope with scenarios like this, I want to develop a framework that will accommodate custom definitions of a family-unit, including variants in the same data (as a simplistic example:. natural-family, extended-family). I may even extend this in order to accommodate any type of person grouping.  What I'm after is any information about how this is tackled elsewhere. Are there any products that accommodate different types of family unit? If so, are the terms fixed or can custom ones be defined?  "
537,Has a modern genealogy been traced back to a biblical person?,"I have heard claims that people have traced their genealogy back to King David of the Old Testament. But I've also heard that most (if not all) have major gaps or assumptions in the lineage.  Is there any published genealogy that is properly sourced and considered to be effectively ""proven"" (in a professional genealogical sense) that traced one line back to a biblical character (any person) in the Old or New Testament?    Follow up:  Canadian Girl Scout's excellent answer made me look around for some Jewish lines back to the bible. And I may have found the one I had thought I heard of. Although not a Levite line as CGS suggested, there is a book: The Lurie Legacy by Neil Rosenstein that traces a notable family back through Rashi and Hillel to King David. I have not read it, so I can't comment on whether every step has been validated.  The author of that book is Dr. Neil Rosenstein, a distinguished genealogist. The web page includes some of Dr. Rosenstein's other books that may also go back to biblical times, including ""A Rothschild Saga: From King David to Baron David"".  Could these be examples of validated lineages back to a biblical character?    Follow up #2:    Today I discovered a blog post by Tammy Hepps from 2012 titled: These People Can Trace Themselves to Adam. She indicates some published genealogies that make 3 specific steps back to King David of the Bible.  Her post gives excellent sources to reference and links to many other sites that provide additional detail.     Follow up #3:  Paula Williams Madison was a Keynote speaker at RootsTech 2016. She claims to be connected to the Lowe family of China that has a documented lineage that goes back 3,000 years and 151 generations to 1006 BC. There is a documentary telling her story and she wrote a book about it as well.   I don't know if this line has been properly sourced or not, and it goes back into Chinese history, not biblical history. But it is worth mentioning here because this does go back sufficiently far to get to biblical times.  "
538,How to Trace Ancestors to Switzerland,"Some of my Zimmerman ancestors emigrated from Switzerland to the United States (Tuscarawas, Ohio) in the mid 1800s. When I find them on U.S. Census records, there are a bunch of other Zimmerman families that were also born in Switzerland that live nearby. I figure that they are probably family, but I'm not certain.  My guess is that these people are probably from the same town in Switzerland, probably emigrated together, and would be found together in Switzerland at some point. I'm not sure how to find the information that would confirm that.  How would I go about making the connection from the Zimmermans in this town in Ohio to Zimmermans in Switzerland? Any suggestions? "
539,What are the tools and methods actually used by genealogists in their work?,"I am under the impression that amateur genealogists, like most amateurs undergo a rite of passage before turning their hobby into a passion. One of these rites of passage is finding a tool that works for you. Possibly trying out a number of them along the way and then by and large sticking to it.  I am sure it is not all done at ancestry.com and stored in a cookie cutter software solution. But it can't all be done in physical filing cabinets or custom software either.  What are the tools and methods you as a genealogist are actually using to get the work done? And more importantly why? Are you happy with your current solution or do you think switching to a different system would be too costly (mainly in terms of time investment, loss of information etc.)?       "
540,Citing local BMD registrations in England and Wales,"The index of civil registrations of births, marriages, and deaths in England and Wales can be found on the FreeBMD Web site. This is not yet complete but fuller versions can also be found on the commercial Web sites.  References to these entries usually involve a year, a yearly quarter, a volume, and a page, e.g. 1956/Q2/3c/358, although some of the newer entries have a different type of reference. This list is compiled from the local registrations around the associated registration districts. However, if you request a copy of a certificate from the GRO (General Register Office) then you'll need this reference.  The Web site UKBMD involves transcriptions of the records from the local register offices. Although the data currently has patchy coverage, the transcriptions are incredibly useful as they often give details such as mother's maiden name, spouses name, age at death, etc., for the very old registrations.  I have heard that there are incredible differences between the local registrations and the centrally compiled index, including lost registrations, naming errors, and indexing errors. Hence, after finding a local registration, this should be preferred as a citation. Requesting a copy of a certificate from that site involves a different type of reference whose structure I'm not 100% certain of, and that is then dispatched to the local register office. For instance: HUL/5/305.  My main question here is whether those local references are permanent enough to use in citations? Also, though, do they have a set pattern and does that pattern relate to the central references at all? "

542,How to interpret Samuel Trigg in Early Virginia Immigrants repeated entries?,"I'm looking at the book Early Virginia Immigrants by George Cabell Greer, Hill printing Company, 1912 on page 332 which reads in part:  Triggs, Wm., 1640, by Henry Porter and Raphaell Joyner, James City Co. Trigg, Samuel, 1640, by Henry Porter and Raphaell Joyner, James City Co. Trigg, Elian, wife of Saml. Trigg, 1640, by Henry Porter and Raphaell Joyner, James City Co. Trigg, William, 1639, by Samuell Trigg and Raphael Joyner, James City Co. Trigg, Samuell, 1635, by Thomas Harwood, ________ Co. Trigg, Ellian, wife of Saml. Trigg, 1639, by Saml. Trigg and Raphael Joyner, James City Co.   The first link above gives whole book transcribed to permit search (transcribed by Allen Price in 2011).  The explanation at the top of Price's transcription says:    Each line contains from left to right:       LAST &amp; FIRST - Name of immigrant who came to America       ARRIVAL -  Year of immigrant arrival    SPONSOR - Name of sponsoring person(s) paying passage of immigrant      COUNTY - County in which sponsor received land for payment of passage      I notice what appear to be inconsistencies in that Samuell is listed coming in 1635 by way of Thomas Harwood (I assume this is an indentured servant) and then again in 1640 by Henry Porter and Raphaell Joyner but then William Trigg also comes in 1639 by way of Samuell Trigg and Raphael Joyner.  Searching the transcribed page, I notice that Samuell Trigg works with both Michael Royner and Raphaell Royner for different individuals (including two from above):  Bassett Isabel  1639    Samuell Trigg &amp; Michael Joyner  James City Grannt  Joane   1638    Samuell Trigg &amp; Michael Joyner  James City Rute    Dorothy 1639    Samuell Trigg &amp; Raphael Joyner  James City Sanders Richard 1639    Samuell Trigg &amp; Raphael Joyner  James City Trigg   Ellen   1639    Samuell Trigg &amp; Michael Joyner  James City Trigg   William 1639    Samuell Trigg &amp; Michael Joyner  James City   I'm guessing either there are multiple Samuels or the records are corrupted.  I note that this page documents that his wife is Ellianor and his brother is William Triggs.  Does it make sense for a person to be coming as indentured servant and then sponsoring people at about the same time?  What is the likely meaning with respect to Samuel and his wife Elian? "
543,Where is Daniel Trigg from Ancestry Source?,"This is taken from a record page on from Ancestry for Daniel Trigg from their online database U.S. and Canada, Passenger and Immigration Lists Index, 1500s-1900s, which is derived from Filby:     Original data: Filby, P.

544,Adopted and making sense of my DNA matches: which are paternal vs maternal?,"I am adopted. I know who my birth mother was and that she came from France. I was conceived in a Brothel in a small town that ironically, my adoptive parents lived only miles from, and that I raised my family in! So many of my matches of distant relatives are people I've known all my life!  I do not know who my birth mother's father or mother were or who my father was.  I have lots of matches and have done a triangulation on Gedmatch.    I'm super confused. 75% Spanish Basque, Scottish, Irish, Russian, Jewish, Sardinian, Great Britain make up the rest. Where is the French?  I have found two second cousin matches and four 3rd cousin matches, and 35 4th cousin matches with almost all matches being Spanish Basque.   Which side is my birth father's side?   This has been my life's quest, searching for my family.  Searching for my birth father.  Now, with DNA, I thought I could find him, but it's confusing to figure out which side is which?   How do know if these cousins are mine because maybe my birth mother's father is the common ancestor?

546,How does the GEDMatch Relationship Tree Projection Tool Work?,"This is an advanced question. I know how to use the tool. A good answer will explain how it does what it does. An ideal answer would come from the person who wrote the tool for GEDmatch.   The purpose of the tool is to answer the question: “How might these two people be related?”   The Relationship Tree Projection tool is only available to “Tier 1”, paid members of GEDmatch. (Currently, $10 per month).    The tool is only useable in certain circumstances. First, you must have two people whose results are on GEDmatch. Second, they must have a match in their X-DNA, not just autosomal. Third, you must know the ages of the participants, or at least their relative ages. You will also want to know the genders of the two participants, but I believe this is determined automatically.   When you run the tool, it suggests a small number of family trees showing exactly how the two people might be related. That’s not so surprising. What is surprising to me is that it shows the gender of everyone in the tree. For example, it might suggest not only that your match is your 1st cousin, but that they are the child of an aunt, not an uncle.   In the case where I used this, it suggested that the matches were 1st cousins 2x removed, through a particular tree of males and females. This was the end game of a search for someone’s biological father. When we followed that diagram, it led to someone who we now know was in fact the father.   The tool eliminated many other possible cousinship relationships we would have otherwise had to check.   Are the results shown by the tool merely the most probably family trees, or does it know that the trees it doesn’t show are impossible?  "
547,"Could ""Our Mother"" be a term of endearment on 1855 headstone?","In researching my great great grandmother, Elizabeth Cowan Short, I have located her death record in Franklin County, Ohio, USA (1896), as well as her burial record. They record her birth as 29 September 1824, in London, England, to parents Robert and Elizabeth Cowan. This was probably informed by her husband, John Short, who lived another 30 years.  Sources: Green Lawn Cemetery inscriptions, Columbus, Franklin Co., Ohio: [website]Death record:    The 1850 US Census has Elizabeth (age 24) living with her new husband and infant son in Delaware County, Ohio: [website]Also living in the household is Harriett Cowan, 72, born in England. Harriett's headstone (1855), located on the campus of Kenyon College, Gambier, Knox County, Ohio reads ""Our Mother...Harriett Cowan..."" There is no death record for this burial. From findagrave.com  I have researched the other members of the household and there does not seem to be a family connection. I cannot find any evidence of siblings for Elizabeth. I cannot find any other records that name Elizabeth's parents, other than quick mention of her father in a 1901 biography of her husband. It is possible that Elizabeth's mother was actually Harriett, but she would have been around 46 at the time of her birth. Could the phrase ""Our Mother"" on Harriett's headstone simply be a term of endearment? "
548,Why no DNA match with possible seventh cousin?,Working on my geneology family tree I discovered my 6th generation grandfather link with another person. I had a DNA test and no match came back with the other person who also had DNA test and I have a link to the same person of the family tree.  Is that possible the could be no link between us via DNA and test both still be linked by the same person in the tree? I am a direct descendent and I am not sure if the other person is a direct descendant. I am a male and the other person is a female. The Y-chromosome could be a factor? 
549,When and why to cite contemporaneous certificates as artifacts?,"In the 2007 version of Evidence Explained (I can't speak to the other editions), the section 7.24, Church Record Certificates, discusses the particulars of citing certificates for events such as baptisms and marriage.  Mills mentions the likelihood of such certificates having been issued well after the event occurred. She then goes on to say, ""In other cases, a family has passed down a certificate given by the minister at the time the event occurred. In that case, the certificate would be cited as a family artifact.""  This was surprising to me, and prompted a number of followup questions:   What is the benefit of using the format for an (in my usage case, privately-held) artifact over the church record certificate format? Does this only apply to a timespan as specific as implied in the quote, or would an item mailed to the family shortly thereafter be cited in the same manner? Would this be a good instance to apply layered citations? (I admit I haven't looked into learning about them yet.) Why is the same not applied to state-issued certificates received around the time of the event (e.g., a birth certificate mailed to the parents)?   I am a beginning genealogist who's trying to learn how to do things right. "
550,"Distinguishing half sibling, uncle or half nephew using Ancestry DNA?",My husband did ancestry dna to find any info on his biological fathers side.    He just got a “close family” match with whom they share 1440 cM across 49 segments.  Is it possible to be a half sibling?   Or more likely that is match is my husbands half nephew?    I don’t think the match is my husbands uncle only because of age but maybe possible. 
551,"Travel from Australia to Palestine, 1870s","In Looking for information about Anna Oldag (*10 Oct 1866 in Warmbrunn) I asked a number of questions about my great-grandmother Anna Minna Martha Oldag. I was advised I'd get better response by focussing on specifics, so I am trying with one part of the story, as told by her son in his memoirs.  He states that an aunt of hers traveled from Australia to Jerusalem to help take care of her after the death of her parents. This must have happened in the 1870s, more likely the first half of the decade. How would I go about finding what ships traveled from Australia to that part of the world, including possible transfer points such as Alexandria? Are there passenger lists available online? "
552,How do I determine when to search for non-conformist birth/baptism records?,"I'm searching for the baptism on my ancestor Mary Darby, who was born between 1811 and 1818, and am trying to assess whether I should search in non-conformist records as well as Parish/Established Church register.  [I note that I am making an assumption that she was baptised at all, but that's a subject for a different question.]  The range of birth dates is based on:   her marriage date in 1834 (assuming she was at least 16 and probably 18 or over); the 1841 census (her age was given as 25, but may have been rounded down from at most 29); her death in 1847 (her age was given as 34).   I know the place of her marriage (the Parish Church in Halesowen in Worcester); however in 1834, she would not have been able to marry in a non-conformist church, so this tells me nothing about her religious practices. The marriage was by Banns, which again tells me little -- some non-conformists preferred to marry by licence, by banns was cheaper. Both participants were noted as being 'Of This Parish'.  I know that a least one of her daughters was baptised in the Church of England as a child; and another daughter had several children baptised ditto. Her husband was also baptised in the Church of England.  I intend to search for her baptism records in the parishes of Halesowen (where she married) and Oldbury (where she lived between at least 1836 until her death in 1847; and also the adjacent parishes (identified using information from GENUKI). I anticipate that this will throw up a number of candidates to investigate and eliminate (or not). I can access online or PDF transcriptions of all the relevant PRs for the period in question (from what I judge to be reliable sources). However, non-conformist records are harder to find and there were a number of non-conformist chapels in the search area at the time. Some records will only be available at a physical archives; some will not be accessible at all.  With the information I have, can I confidently exclude the possibility that she came form a non-conformist family? If not, what steps if any can I take to determine this (other than searching the records of 2 dozen or more chapels?) "
553,What proportion of the births or baptisms of children were recorded in early nineteenth century England?,"It's usual to search for a baptism record as a substitute birth record in England in the period prior to the start of Civil Registration (i.e. pre-1837.) (Baptism records may also include birth information, and some non-conformist records include birth information, especially if the denominations in question don't practice child baptism).  How prevalent was baptism in this period? More specifically, what proportion of children were baptised in the Church of England, what proportion recorded in non-conformist records, and what proportion not recorded at all? "
554,Reading Latin date description in 18th century German church record?,"This record of my x-gg's brother shows a wedding date recorded from the church calendar.     What does this mean? (I read the header as ""Fer. II Pascs."" -- is that perchance Easter Monday?) "
555,Who were parents of Johann Gottlieb Drange (b.1850 or 1851),"Johann Gottlieb Drange birthplace is given variously as Darschäwitz, Possen or Posen(possibly misspelled Preußen?), Germany, July 1850. The 1900 US Census lists him as “Jno G. Drange” of Cullom Village, Livingston Co., IL. and gives 1882 as date of immigration (but 1880 in the 1910 census, where he is shown as John G. Drange).  How might I find out who his parents were?    Family tradition says his father was a military officer, but we don’t know anything more. "
556,Interpreting dates in German church registers from 18th century?,"Working with 18th century church records, I found two confusing date entries that I have a hard time wrapping my head around:    The records are from the Untertürkheimer Kirchenbuch (1694-1800), which is available electronically at Ancestry.com (reel 10055947, frame 482).  I read the two record headers as 23d and 24th Sunday after Trinity Sunday, which I can count out from a calendar. These dates are one week apart. However, the dates in the margin are not.    Why are there two dates recorded for each entry? Why do they differ in this case? Could the editorial comment (""cop[ulati] ... ob impregnationem"") have anything to do with the discrepancies?  "
557,Would selling land at a low price to someone of the same surname indicate a familial relationship?,"Using family bible records, deeds, and census records, I have traced my Fulton family line to my 3rd great grandfather Gersham Fulton in Anderson District South Carolina. But I am now at a dead end.   The earliest record I have found is a deed where he purchased about 200 acres for only 10 shillings from a Samuel Fulton in 1791 or 92. Samuel had been granted the land from the governor only 6 months eariler.   I thought the low price might indicate that Samuel was a relative, the father or perhaps an uncle of Gersham. Also, Gersham’s first son was named Samuel.    What else could that price indicate?   Maybe Gersham was an indentured servant?   Maybe he was an illegitimate son of Samuel?   Or am I reading some significance into the price and that is not there?   I have not been able to connect Gersham to Samuel. Gersham’s second son was named Jesse and there was a Samuel and a Jesse in North Carolina who were brothers but I can not make a connection there either.   I believe Gersham married and started his family about the time of the land purchse.  "
558,Reading descriptor preceding name in 18th century German church record?,"I previously asked about this record in Reading Latin date description in 18th century German church record?    Now I am curious about an abbreviation that repeats frequently in this recordset, namely the descriptor preceding the name Jacob Gassmann. The same word also precedes the name of the father of the bride, Johann Jacob Glöckler. Can anyone help me decipher it? "
559,How can I distinguish between name changes and missing records?,"Every now and again I come across a person, who seems to have changed their name. For example, a birth/baptism record may have one name, while subsequent records (marriage, census…) use another for the only child of that age in the family. It's a fairly uncommon thing but not always remarkable (exchanges of first and middle names aren't that unusual, for example). But I have found a family where one child may have had up to three different names. This looks like a big red flag, but then so does the alternative - a stack of missing records - and I can't find a clear way around it either way.   David Hill seems to have resided in the Gloucestershire village of Little Rissington for his entire life. He married twice, and had three daughters (Mary Jane, Amy Gertrude and Emily Florence) and up to three sons (Thomas, John and Charles). For his daughters, the records are mostly present as expected:    each has an entry (or good candidate) in the GRO births index  each has a baptism recorded in the parish church records  Emily Florence died young, leaving a single census entry, a GRO death index entry and a parish burial record  Mary Jane and Amy Gertrude both married in the parish church and have corresponding GRO marriage index entries  Amy Gertrude Hill/Ferriman is found in Little Rissington records until her death in 1937  Mary Jane Hill/Davis probably entered the Stow on the Wold workhouse around 1881, and I think she died there in 1892.   For David's son(s), things are more problematic. In chronological order, I have:   1) 01 Nov 1857 - Thomas Hill born in Little Rissington to David and Jane, according to birth certificate from the GRO. (Thomas' BC was filed under the wrong registration district, as asked about in another question). No GRO birth records are apparent for John Hill or Charles Hill.    2) 25 Dec 1857 - John Hill baptised in Little Rissington to David and Jane (two records on Ancestry - register and copy). No baptism records are found in the Little Rissington parish records for Thomas or Charles Hill.     3) 07 Apr 1861 - Charles Hill (aged 3) in Little Rissington census (Class: RG 9; Piece: 1789; Folio: 84; Page: 6 on Ancestry) with father David, sister Mary Jane and David's sister-in-law Mary Ann Harris. (David's wife Jane had died in 1859.)   4) 02 Apr 1871 - Thomas Hill (aged 13) in Little Rissington census (Class: RG10; Piece: 2654; Folio: 32; Page: 7 on Ancestry) with father David, stepmother Mary Ann and sisters Amy Gertrude and Florence.   5)  24 Dec 1880 - Thomas Hill killed Samuel Palmer after an altercation at a pub in Bourton on the Water (just up the road from Little Rissington). Thomas had been living in Bradford, Yorkshire for ""several years"" before this.   6)  14 Feb 1881 - Thomas Hill was sentenced to life imprisonment for manslaughter and was sent to Pentonville prison in London to begin his sentence.   7) 03 Apr 1881 - David, Mary Ann and Amy Gertrude, plus niece Selina Bolton, in Little Rissington census (Class: RG11; Piece: 2562; Folio: 102; Page: 22 on Ancestry) - no son(s) present. Thomas seems to be in the Pentonville Prison census (Class: RG11; Piece: 248; Folio: 104; Page: 33 on Ancestry).   8) 05 April 1891 - David, Mary Ann, with married daughter Amy Ferriman and her family in Little Rissington census (Class: RG12; Piece: 2037; Folio: 62; Page: 17 on Ancestry) - no son(s) present. Thomas is in Chatham Prison (Class: RG12; Piece: 665; Folio: 103; Page: 7 on Ancestry). Prison records show him transfer to Portland Prison later that year, and then I lose track of him.  The records I have found for the family are tabulated below. Birth dates in parentheses are inferred from baptism or census records (and so are not reliable), otherwise are from GRO records or candidate entries (I have certificate copies for Mary Jane and Thomas, but not Amy or Emily). Grey-shaded records relate to the Hill son(s), with bolded entries being confirmed records (just for clarity). Pink-shaded cells indicate missing records that we might expect to find for three sons.    So three sons of David (and Jane) are named, and have similar birth years, but no two appear in the same census. Thomas was born in Nov 1857, but less than two months later John was baptised. John was never recorded again, and Charles also appears only in a single record. All three sons have similar known or inferred birth dates. No local marriage, death or burial records are found for any of them. The common names don't help, of course, and make it difficult to trace anyone who left the village. But from this table, up to twelve records are ""missing"".  David does not appear to have left a will, and I can't find any other likely records such as Thomas/John/Charles as marriage witnesses in Little Rissington.  If we merge the three sons into one individual, we end up with a complete, duplicate-free record set:       That's a nice, simple model, but a fragile one: a single extra record would shatter it. So the impetus is to seek that extra record, or to explain why none will be found.  There are a few possibilities I can think of:   Births of John and Charles may not have been registered (although all others were). Or their births may be registered in the wrong district… Both are possible, but I have looked at the Stow and Northleach indices and found no good candidate births for either. Thomas' record filing means that I can't fully trust the GRO index for this place and time, but I think it's unlikely that too many more records would be misfiled into yet another registration district. Unregistered births would explain two missing records, but not the rest.  Two of the boys could have died in infancy. But which two? There are no good GRO death or local burial record candidates. And this doesn't offer a satisfactory explanation for the apparent name changes.  Thomas and Charles may not have been baptised in the parish church (although again all others were) Also possible, although I'd expect consistency with this. They weren't baptised in the neighbouring parish church of Bourton on the Water either. Further afield is perhaps possible but hard to trace with such common names.  There could be more than one David Hill and family, and perhaps they moved around. There were quite a few Hill families in Little Rissington through the mid-late 19th century, and most or all of them were related. But I can find only two baptisms for ""David Hill"" and one of those died in infancy. There don't appear to be any other David Hills in the census records at that time either, so I don't think there is any chance of mixing up two similar families.  Records have been lost. The Little Rissington parish baptism, marriage and burial registers look pretty complete for this timeframe. They are available as images on Ancestry, with no obvious missing pages or illegible entries. The baptism record for John appears in the original ledger and a transcript ledger, which do not appear to differ from each other significantly in this date range. There do not appear to be any missing census pages.  The boys may have been sent away to live with other families - David being widowed with young children must have been a difficult time. This may be the best area for more research: the presence of Mary Ann Harris in 1861 does suggest familial support after Jane's death. I have not filled out the families of Jane or Mary Ann, so there could be records showing Hill boys with Jane's relatives, for example. And Thomas had been living in Bradford, Yorkshire for some time to 1881, after all, although I don't know why he went there or if relatives were involved. I have looked for Hill boys in Jane's home town of Shipton under Wychwood, and found nothing. But the family could have moved/spread around. It's also possible that the boys could have been with several related Hill families in Little Rissington - I can't see any obvious candidates but haven't cross-checked every single entry yet.    Some of these options would explain missing birth/baptism records, while others would explain missing census entries. None explain both, so more than one would have to be in effect. Hence the appeal of the ""One Son, Many Names"" model - it explains everything in one go. But it is very hard to prove the negative of ""no more records to be found"".  So are there any further strategies to consider? (Or am I asking for too high a degree of proof?) "
560,Evaluating Ancestry databases without active subscription?,"I have found a match in Ancestry's database U.S. Passport Applications, 1795-1925 but the description is a bit vague.

561,Linking an Individual in two trees using Webtrees?,"I would like to use Webtrees but the issue is that the idea of 'Family trees' is so separated that it doesn't seem like a person can be shared between two trees.   Basically, what I would like to do is have a tree for my dads last name and my moms maiden last name. For simplicity, I will call them John Smith and Jane Doe.  The thought was that the family trees would be 'Smith Tree' and 'Doe Tree'. (later, more trees would be added, for instance, one for my wifes maiden name). Now the issue seems to be that family trees are distinct and separate. (they would be imported as separate GEDCOMs).   So I haven't been able to figure out a way to link myself in my dads tree to myself in my moms tree. That way if I edit myself, it would edit it in both trees.   Basically, what is the standard when it comes to handling this? Is there a way to link that maybe I am missing? Ideally, the link would be set up to link any children I have and automatically add it to the other tree.   As a last solution, I could just have one huge tree that just includes everyone. So far, this has seemed the only way not to have to deal with duplicate records. "
562,How to read DNA matches across multiple related people to a 3rd party?,"I have autosomal tests for myself, my sister, a cousin through my dad's sister, and my mother at Ancestry.com I have a third party that is matched to myself, my sister, and my mom, but not my cousin as follows:   My sister — Very High confidence — 4th-6th cousins. Myself — High confidence — 5th-8th cousins. My mom — Good confidence — 5th-8th cousins. My cousin (through my dad's sister) — No match reported.   This seems strange, why would my sister be a much stronger match than my mom, unless either my mom is not a real match or we are connected through both my mom and my dad.  Are there any DNA tools that allow you to better combine multiple DNA tests to better triangulate where a match is coming from?  I've got all our tests copied over to both gedmatch.com and FamilyTreeDNA.com.  Would either of these sites provide better tools for this case, or is there yet another site I should consider for such analysis? "
563,Origin of young German lady's attire with fore-sleeves and head cover in 1878 photo from Hannover?,"I have attached a scan of the cover and photograph of a picture taken in Hannover in 1878. We believe the young lady to be a sister to my Great-Great Grandmother (Catherine Sophia Dorothea Wilkering) who immigrated to the US from Germany (Schaumburg-Lippe?) in about 1868.  While we do not know the young lady's name, my question has to do with her attire. What is the significance of her outfit with the fore-sleeves and the head covering?   "
564,How to read Swiss Church Book / Kirchenbücher Collection Indexes?,"I recently discovered the Swiss Church / Kirchenbücher book collections, and though you can locate them on FamilySearch, you have to view them in a LDS Family History center or library.  This creates some additional constraints to me reading and going through them (see below).  For context, the specific church books I am wanting to view are listed on the state archives webpage of the canton of Bern as well as in this breakdown of them. This document (in German) also has some examples of what the books themselves look like, and look like they would be some effort to go through. I also know I can order scans of each of the book sets by community on CD, but they are several hundred dollars per CD from Pikton Press, and I lack commercial grade OCR software that I think could both read the hand writing and the German.   Luckily there has been at least one hand written index of them, but I am having a hard time reading them at the library as they do not line up to the reference documents on Family Search.  I am hoping to still extract some value by looking for dates and names, but am not following the format completely of the middle column specifically.  I know they are organized in chronological (date) order. (Note I do not speak German either and each images can take well over a minute to load at my local FHL).  I have been unable to find any typed version of these indexes.  My specific question is: what are the column headers AND what is the date that doesn't have a column header but seems to be consistently present under most records?   As a bonus if there is anything else that seems consistent about the records I would appreciate knowing that as well.  This particular example is from a Toten or Burial record index.     There are Toten (Burial), Taufen (Baptismal), and Verkündungs (Pronouncement/Proclamations???) Indexes.    Link to Family Search Burial Template as an example from one of their guides for the above example record which doesn't align. "
565,Reconciling mid-18th century US marriage records for James Lea and Ann/Anne Tolbert/Herndon?,"I am finding contradictory information about James Lea (of 18th c. America) [JL] and whether he married Ann/Anne Holbert or Terndon.  Of course, it is possible that there is more than one James Lea.  This note from the Caswell County Historical Association describes some of the controversy.  Marriage records (which I assume are considered primary sources) accessible through Ancestry.com [U.S. and International Marriage Records, 1560-1900] show:   JL (b. 1706, VA) marries Anne Herndon in 1731 (VA). JL (b. 1707, VA) marries Ann Herndon in 1731 (VA). JL (b. 1707,  VA) marries Anne Herndon in 1731 (VA). JL (b. 1717, VA ) marries Ann Herndon. JL (b. 1718, EN) marries Anne Tolbert in 1788 (NC). JL (b. 1706) marries Anne Herndon in 1731. JL (b. 1715) marries Ann Tolbert in 1746.   A search at the DAR shows him as having been born in England, unspecified, or Virginia in 1718 and married to Anne Talbert, Ann Tolbert, Anna Tolbert, Annie Tolber, Annie Tolbert, Annie Cialbert, Ann Herndon, Annie Tobbert, Annie Tabbert, etc.  (There are other James Leas born after 1750; I am not including their wives.)  The DAR record for this James Lea lists his spouse as ""ANNE X"" and states: ""DATA IN THE CORRECTION FILE"" and ""SEE DATACF FOR INFO ABOUT MULTIPLE MEN OF THIS NAME IN CASWELL CO. 2/8/2006"", but I don't see a way to get more detail.  This discussion at Geni refers to Ann Tolbert ""Nancy"" HERNDON as being one person.  This post at genealogy.com quotes a document found at DAR National Headquarters, which said that ""Talbot"" was mistakenly transposed to create the last name of ""Ann Talbert"".  I was not able to find birth records for any of these people, except for secondary/tertiary sources like findagrave.com or other unsourced genealogies.  Any suggestions how to sort this out?   "
566,"FamilyEcho incorrectly lists my relationship as ""ex-husband""","I'm new to genealogy and started to build my tree in [website]I started out with myself, and I added a lot of people including my wife. I found an option to specify relationship type and selected ""married"". I was then listed as her husband, and she as my wife. OK! Problem: Revisiting these fields I now discover that we are listed as ""ex-husband"" / ""ex-wife"" and I can't figure out how to fix that. I also don't know how it happened. I've exported the tree in GEDCOM format and in CSV format. It looks like the error is in my record, but I see no way to fix it: In the CSV format, there's a column ""partner"" and a column ""ex-partner"" -- all records are correct except mine which holds the reference to my wife in the ""ex-partner"" column.  In the GEDCOM export file, I can see a line 1 FAMS @F6@ where ""F6"" is the reference to my wife; but I don't see anywhere in GEDCOM that specifies the relationship type, specifically the erroneous ""ex-"" part. The Issue: I found my marriage lines in the end of the GEDCOM file where the and noticed a line reading ""2 TYPE Ending"" underneath ""1 EVEN"". To my untrained eye, this seems to be the culprit - is it indicating that the marriage is noted as ending? That's not actually the case, but I can't see how I can correct it in the web application.    As I've already shared this tree with family members, I'd rather not hand-edit the GEDCOM 5.5.1 formatted file and upload it into a new tree as I attempted that but it didn't seem to work.  How do I fix this incorrect end of relationship in FamilyEcho? "
567,"Is ""mythological"" information relevant?","I am currently trying to get as far as possible in my Ahnentafel. Thanks to a couple of online sources, I have been able to find a lot of ancestry, google helped me get up to this website which offers information, recorded because that part of my Ahnentafel apparently had some heraldy in it (knights and lords, (very) unfortunately not my genealogy though).   This source links me from father to father to the following source on geneanet which seems to contain a ""mythological"" family tree, which ""proves"" my Ahnentafel links to Franconian kings.  Of course this is all pretty darn exciting, but I also find it a bit hard to believe. How legit is a source like this? "
568,Could John Stacy who lived/married at London and later lived at Exmouth (Devon) have been baptized in 1759 at North Petherton (Somerset)?,"I would like to identify the parents of my 4th great grandfather John Stacy.

569,Finding the parents of Guillielmus and Egidius Van Sever?,"So far I have found quite a bit of information on related family trees on myheritage.com (basically it got added automatically to my tree after filling in a couple) and on the following website: [website]I got on my paternal tree up to:  Judocus Van Sever (1756 - 1830) x Barbara van Hemelrijk (1782 - 1843)  son of  Franciscus Josephus Van Sever (? - 1783) x Barbara Soetewey (? - 1760) (They loved their Barbaras...)  son of  Egidius Van Sever (? - 1744) x Gertrudis Van Baerode  son of  Guilielmus Van Sever x Catharina Verplast  I can't get any further than Guililmus though, and the only references I found to him personally was on the other people's family trees. I'd like to be able to expand on my paternal line, but totally ran into a brick wall.  Facts that probably matter is that Van Sever is sometimes misspelled as Van Cever (and Van Severen), and they've always lived in Wezembeek (which is Wezembeek-Oppem nowadays)  Evidence of all paternal relationships are found on the abovementioned website, which is basically a collection of different official registrations. By going to ""persons"" and looking up ""Van Sever"" as a name, all of this can be found.   The only thing that I  can not find evidence from is the last paternal link. I have seen Guilielmus' name appear as the godfather of one of the children of Egidius however, and since it's customary to make the grandfather godfather, that is a bit of supporting evidence. His actual fatherhood is based on secondary evidence from people's family trees on myheritage.com, however. "
570,Interpreting Musgrave's Obituaries (for London) from around 1790?,"On Ancestry.com I found a reference that may be to my 4th great grandfather John Stacy (also discussed in Could John Stacy who lived/married at London and later lived at Exmouth (Devon) have been baptized in 1759 at North Petherton (Somerset)?), referring to Musgrave's Obituaries.  Finding the entry in Musgrave's Obituaries Prior to 1800, vol 5, John Stacye has been recorded as:      Stacye, John, tea-dealer, Gracechurch Str. 3 April 1790. (E.M.319; G.M. 375)   Does anyone know how to interpret such an entry, and in particular does it seem to be a reference to an obituary for John Stacye (in which case it is not my 4th great grandfather, but possibly his father/grandfather)? I'm hoping that (E.M. 319; G.M. 375.) may lead to more details about him recorded elsewhere. "
571,Who was the father of Thomas Jocelyn/Joslin who emigrated to Massachusetts in the Increase (1635),"It is well documented that Thomas Jocelin/Josselyn/Joslin/Jostlin (1592-1660) emigrated to the Massachusetts Colony on the Increase in 1635 with his wife Rebecca and children Rebecca, Dorothy, Nathaniel, Elizabeth, and Mary.    Claim 1  According to an introduction to The Diary of the Rev. Ralph Josselin, 1616-1683 (p. vi):     Ralph Josselyn [the author of the diary] belonged to the ancient family of Josselyn whose name is supposed   to be connected with the town of Josselin in Brittany, the head of the senior   branch of which is the Earl of Roden. There was a Ralph Josselyn of Roxwell in   Essex, yeoman, whose will was proved on May 4 1632; he had seven sons of whom the eldest   was John. John Josselyn was born about 1583 and died in 1636 and was the father   of the author of the diary; he had six other brothers one of whom, Thomas   emigrated to New England in 1635; and in Dr Shaw's ""History of the English Church during   Civil Wars &amp;c"" will be found the names of other members same family.   If I read this correctly, this implies that Ralph Josselyn of Roxwell in Essex was the father of the Thomas who emigrated.  Claim 2  On the other hand, ""The Joscelyn-Joslin Family"" by Laura Elmendorf Skeels in The Journal of American History (1912), says (p. 528):     Thomas Jocelyn or Joslin, eldest son of Sir Thomas by his first wife,   Dorothy was born about 1591. He sailed from London in the good ship   Increase April 17th, 1635, for the Colony of Massachusetts, with his wife, Rebecca...   This article does not include citations.  Claim 3  I am further confused by a 1917 article from The New England Historical and Genealogical Record, which, on pp. 250 and 253, shows Thomas being descended from apparently the same Ralph of Roxwell, co. Essex, yeoman, who died in 1631/2:    On p. 253:    However, a footnote on p. 253 says:   Here's a transcription of the footnote:     In 1886, Mr. William M. Sargent communicated to the REGISTER (vol. 40,   p. 293) the conjecture of a member of the Josselyn family of Ipswich,   co. Suffolk, Eng., that Thomas Josselyn son of Ralph [26] of Roxwell,   co. Essex, was identical with the Thomas Josselyn who emigrated to New   England in 1635. This conjecture however was at that time unsupported   by proof and the member of the family who made it admitted also that   he could not trace ""the origin of this branch of the Josselyn family   nor its connection if any with the Torrel's Hall branch.""   This footnote seems to contradict the earlier part of the page, which claims  that  the Thomas who emigrated to the New World (died at Lancaster, Massachusetts) is the son of Ralph [26].  Any idea how I can sort this out? "
572,How to read Tennessee marriage record,"I am trying to interpret the bottom marriage record from Ancestry.com's ""Tennessee State Marriages, 1780-2002"":    I know that the couple getting married is Lyman J. Strong and Martha H. Green.  What is the significance of the next line, which appears to be ""Z. Green, Bondsman""?  Is that the person officiating, a witness, or something else? From the previous record, it seems that ""by"" is put before the name of the officiant. As for being a witness, I thought that relatives were ineligible.  "
573,How can I find historical city directories for the United States?,"I want to search the entire U.S. from 1750 to 1959 for residences.  I have found the Polk city directories in the archives of some libraries in several cities, and it is useful. But I have to travel there.  I am searching for addresses all over, from Nova Scotia to California and in between.  Are there other city directories, other than telephone directories?  Any online directories?   "
574,Etiquette for asking loved one to share life story before death,"This might be a bit of an odd question, but I figured that at least one or more persons here have been in the situation that I am now.   My question is as follows:     What is the (if any) 'proper etiquette' for telling a   loved one that you wish to record them as they tell their life story,   before they die and all familial information is gone?   I am struggling with how to word it without it coming out so bluntly or being seen as a rude and/or crude question to ask. Obviously, from the standpoint of a genealogist and someone in general that loves and wants to remember their family members, recording someone would seem to be common sense. However, bringing up the subject of death or phrasing your question so that it doesn't come out as, ""I know you're going to die soon, so can I record you?"", can be quite the task (with respect to each personality type). "
575,Finding people who have moved within the same geographical area?,"In an answer to the question How would you handle a census record that is almost certainly the target family but which has too many discrepancies? I wrote about a family in my research area for which I don't have a 1930 Census record.  (I don't want to post the location and surname of this family, because I don't want to violate the privacy of cousins who may still be living in that area.)    Max and Ida lived in Western Massachusetts.  They arrived in the US from Germany in the late 1870s (Max) - early 1880s (Ida). The residence information I've collected so far indicates that they were renters.    What I have so far:   1880 US Federal Census: a good candidate for Max and his family (verified by probate records after I wrote this question) 1900 US Federal Census for Max, Ida, and their three children 1910 US Federal Census for Max, Ida, and their oldest son 1920 US Federal Census for Max, Ida, and their oldest son 1940 US Federal Census for Max (widowed)   In the period between 1920 and 1940, I have city directory listings for Max through the 1929 publication year.  Many of these also list his wife Ida.  The next clue came from the 1940 Census, which says that the residence in 1935 was ""same place"", that is, he was living in the same town, but not the same residence, suggesting he moved in between 1935 and census day 1940.  I have city directories from the publication year 1935 through his death in 1945.  I also have his obituary and funeral notice.   For the three children:   The eldest son remained in town, and I've collected census records, draft registration cards, and city directories.  Max is not listed in the son's household in the 1930 Census, nor is he on the same page.  (I haven't worked outward yet to check the nearby census pages.) His daughter married in 1914 and remained in town until just before the 1930 Census, when she and her husband moved to New Jersey.  Max is not listed in his daughter's household in the 1930 Census. The younger son moved to New York.  I have records through 1919, and then a big gap until 1942 when his WWII Draft card turns up.  Max's obit gives this son's residence in 1945 as New York City.   Max's siblings:   his sister was 'last seen' in a 1924 City directory (age 60)  his brother moved to New York City, and except for a mention in Max's obituary that says his brother lives in New York City, the last record I have for him is the 1920 US Federal Census (living in the Bronx).   My record wantlist:   a death record, obituary, and funeral notice for Ida residence information for Max between 1927ish and 1935 residence information for Max's brother (and nieces and nephews) and Max's son in NYC   Writing this out for the question makes me wonder if Max was living with his youngest son in New York for part of this time, but Max's obituary suggests that his residence in town was continuous.  Max was a well-known businessperson, but the business was sold around 1902, so tracking the business records wouldn't help answer this question.  A possible to-do list:   tracking him through his German social groups double-checking the households of his wife's relatives, his children's spouses' relatives, and his siblings' and their spouses' relatives.  Nothing has turned up so far, but I may have missed someone. doing a NYC one-name study to see if something turns up widening the search to include his old business partner and those relatives   What other searches can I do that wouldn't involve searching for him by surname?  It's a long surname and the indexing is often horrendous.  I can do a wildcard search, but putting in anything longer than three letters before the wildcard doesn't work; it's at that point where the variants start to happen.  I found Max's obit on Genealogy Bank by  searching for his occupation and employer and his address, rather than his name.   "
576,How many sources/citations is too many?,"I've been using GRAMPS, and am a little overwhelmed by the citation abilities. So I guess the question for seasoned veterans of genealogy is where do you put the citations, given the ability to cite every little detail? Or do you put it everywhere?  I've mostly been using the GRAMPS software, so the question may be tilted towards that. But, for example, a census can be cited in:   A family object A census event Residence event for each individual (shared) Occupation event for each individual Each persons estimated birth event (year and place, if no other data is available) The names of each individual The birth relationship for each person (not always confident in the census for that, but sometimes better than nothing) Marriage event Other miscellaneous stuff (some list naturalization date, etc)   Similarly for birth/death certificates.  So how much is too much? Or is it common for people to cite just about everything like that? It's tedious, but I suppose it strengthens the relationships between all the data. "
577,Does the name on this record say Nikiefor?,"I found a strange name on a baptismal record from Biały Kamień which is now part of Ukraine. The records are mostly in Polish and Latin.    It looks like ""Nikiefor"" but that's a very strange name. I've never seen that name before and I've viewed decades worth of records for the town. Plus there are only 169 results for it on Google.  Extra points if you can tell me what the origin of the name is. "

579,What uses are there for the Social Security Number (SSN) of a deceased ancestor?,"The Social Security Death Index (SSDI), or Death Master File (DMF) is an index of the deaths of US persons that have been notified to the US Social Security.  It's available online at various places including FamilySearch.  It shows the social security number (SSN), age, and (for more recent data) the last place of residence of a person.  I understand that the primary use of the SSN on these records is to apply for a copy of the person's social security card application form SS-5, which often reveals information about them (such as parents names).    In addition, it's possible to find the place of issue of an SSN (issued before 2011).  This is listed as ""state"" on the FamilySearch results. It can give clues as to where a person was (with many exceptions) when they first needed a Social Security card, such as when they first started working.  However, are there any other uses for the SSN?  Are there any US public records, applicable to a deceased person, that use or include the SSN?  For example, is there such a thing as a historical credit file that might show residential addresses over time?  Are there historical voter records that include it?    Are there open historical tax records? Is the SSN used in public military records, or in university alumni records? (Whether the number should have been used for such purposes is outside the scope of this question).  In other words, given the SSN of somebody who died possibly decades ago, are there any other records it could provide a key to? "
580,"Is the term ""baptism"" or ""christening"" more accurate in old parish registers?","Looking at Church of England parish registers from the 17th-18th centuries, some pages are titled ""baptisms"" while others ""christenings"". Now we use the terms more or less interchangeably, but would they have been interchangeable three hundred years ago?  When it comes to entering the event into my genealogy program I have the option of entering either. For the sake of accuracy, which should I enter it as? "
581,How can I correct Ellis Island Indexes?,"I found several entries in the Ellis Island index where I am sure that I know better than the index. Is it possible to file corrections somewhere?

582,"What was the ""Old War"" and how should I interpret this pension index card?","I'm looking at this old military pension file index.  Jeptha Tallant is listed under the heading ""Old War"" -- which war is it referring to? I believe he was born in 1811, so the Revolutionary War doesn't fit.  Also, what does the ""Rej."" heading mean, and the ""Invalid"" column, and why does it seem like his file is connected with the name Eleazer Bulkley?  Finally, should I expect to find any other records somewhere? I've had good luck digging up treasures in some pension applications.    2017 update: Subscribers to fold3 can view the index card -- it is from NARA A1158, Pensions indexed by number for Army or Navy service in the Civil War and later, 1860-1934.  For images of the blank cards, see Card Records in Use in the Bureau of Pensions, 1916 (U.S. Government Printing Office, 1916). "
583,Is the IGI a derivative of primary evidence or an original of secondary evidence?,"Looking at the BCG's ""Skillbuilding: Guidelines for Evaluating Genealogical Resources"", I note that derivative sources may include ""transcripts, abstracts, and notes produced from viewing the original or a derivative"" (my emphasis).  That being so, should I view the IGI and other indexes from bodies like FamilySearch and Ancestry as being notes produced from viewing the original? And since the original is primary evidence for the events it records, then this suggests indexes are derivative sources of primary information.  My problem is that this goes so much against the grain of regarding indexes as being secondary, that I find it difficult to believe I've come to the right conclusion. Would it not be better to say that the construction of the index has broken the chain and created a new source, which is an original of secondary evidence? "
584,How to get an elderly person to provide saliva sample for DNA?,"I have an Ancestry autosomal DNA kit that we are trying to get a 95 year old woman to take and having trouble.  I provided the hints that 23andme offers to my cousin that is trying to administer the test:     If providing adequate sample volume is a challenge for you or someone you are assisting, the following may help increase saliva production:         Gently rubbing the outside of your cheeks   Making chewing motions with your mouth   Adding a small amount of sugar to the tip of your tongue   Smelling or imagining sour foods such as lemons   Thinking about your own favorite food         Biting or scraping your cheeks is not recommended; keep in mind that the majority of the cells analyzed in your saliva sample will not be epithelial cells from your cheeks but white blood cells that are found naturally in your saliva.   However, they have now reported back:     I worked with my mom using your list of suggestions. I think she may have produced some saliva, but she wasn't able to spit it out. She seems to automatically swallow the saliva and has nothing to spit out. I am not sure what to do. I talked with her but she doesn't seem to understand. If you have any ideas I am willing to try again if she is.   Now we could switch to cheek swab using Family Tree DNA, but I would prefer to stick with Ancestry since I get DNA circles and can transfer to FTDNA in the future.  Perhaps getting her to look down so gravity is helping as someone rubs the checks?  What other suggestions do folks have in getting saliva for an Ancestry.com DNA sample? "
585,"Reading entry from Quarter Sessions Order Book of Dorset, England 1682-1693?","The clipped image below comes from the Dorset, England, Quarter Sessions Order Books, 1625-1905 via Ancestry.com:     Name: Arthurus Bewsey      Event Date: 1682-1693      Event Place: Dorset, England      Reference Number: QSM 2/1     My 8th great grandfather Arthur Bewcy, a Yeoman, was buried on 29 Mar 1719 at Holnest, Dorset, England     Arthur BEWCY buried 29.3.1719 - see Dorset Online Parish Clerk records for Holnest   I have not tried to read a Quarter Sessions Order Book previously and I am only about 80% sure that I have picked out his name (at bottom left).  I think the last line starts:     Arthurus Bewsey &amp; John ...   but that is all that I can read of it.  According to Ancestry.com:     The records document Quarter Session judges’ decisions in matters that   include settlement inquiries, highway rates, criminal trials,   registers of settlement, orders of removal, bastardy examinations,   apprenticeships, licensing, contracts, lists of justices, and other   matters related to the business of running the county.   so I am very keen to understand what brought my ancestor to a Quarter Session and how he fared there.  Is anyone able to read more or all of the entry related to Arthurus?  For anyone able to use it, this is a link to the image on Ancestry.com, and the entry above is the one at the bottom of the left hand page.  Dorset County Council has posted a PDF guide to quarter sessions which has lots of interesting information about this recordset and says that:     The records for the early to mid 17th century are largely in Latin but   thereafter you will usually find them in English. From 1731 the   records are legally required to be in English   Since this is late 17th century the above suggests that it might be in English but as @HarryVervet has commented this is in Latin. "
586,Finding 1907 New York City arraignment results?,"In searching my great grandfather, I came across an article in The Brooklyn Daily Eagle (6/16/1907) of the arrest of a man with the same name (Harry Farson - not sure if they are one in the same yet, or not). He was arraigned in the Harlem Police Court on 6/15/1907, but, I cannot find ANY information regarding the case after that. I don't know if he was sent to jail. My great grandfather was on the 1905 census with my great grandmother, Minetta, but, not on the 1910 census - so, I am wondering if the man arraigned is my great grandfather, and ended up in jail.   Any advice on where I can find the answer?   His parents are George &amp; Mary, and he had a brother William. 1905 was the year my grandmother was born to Harry and Minetta.....not sure why he'd be on his parents census. He seems to disappear after the 1905 census "
587,Did bigamous marriages need to be annulled?,"I have a great great uncle Ernest who was legally married in England in 1905. He and wife went separate ways shortly after the birth of their daughter, who died at 11 months, but they did not divorce.  Ernest went on to marry bigamously in 1914. He was caught and convicted. This seems not to put him off, as he married bigamously to another woman in 1927. He was still legally married to his first wife. He got away with it for about 12 months, but when he proposed to another woman while already bigamously married, and had banns called in two parish churches, his second bigamous wife got suspicious, informed the police, and he was sentenced to another much longer stint in prison. I know these details from various newspaper reports of his trials.  A marriage where one or both parties were already married was legally null and void. However, it is unclear to me whether the innocent party would need to obtain an annulment or declaration of nullity in order to marry again, since a void marriage never actually took place? Would nullity have been implied with conviction for bigamy? "
588,Reading a Canadian 'Oceans Arrival' form completed in 1924,"I'm studying the FAN club of John Stanley Wright (mentioned at Finding an elusive ancestor after the 1901 census (who may have deserted his family)) in an attempt to narrow down the date range for his death.    I knew I had a great-aunt Suey who migrated to Canada, as my Auntie Dot went to visit her (or possibly her descendants) at the time of the Montreal Expo in 1967.  And searching the records of passengers travelling between the UK and Canada (Montreal, Quebec) revealed not only that great aunt Susan Jane Wright went back and forth a few times, but great aunt Mary Agnes Wright travelled with her sometimes -- and Mary Agnes travelled across to Canada on her own in 1924.  On this occasion she had to fill in a form 30A (Ocean arrivals) -- you can see the original at Library and Archives Canada -- navigate to page 3473.  On the form she states her nearest relative in the UK (usefully, this is her father), but also that she was travelling to join her sisterS (plural) and gives her destination as an address with her sisters Susie and ???? Wright. However, I'm struggling to read the name of the second sister.    Mary Agnes had 4 known sisters: Ellen (b.~1885), Susan Jane (Susie/Suey) (b.~1893), Dorothy b.~1901) and Ethel (B.~1902).  There may be some missing ones -- the details of living and dead children of their mother in 1911 weren't filled in, and there are some possible gaps in the sequence of children after her marriage: 1883, 1885, 1887, 1889, 1891, 1893, 1896, 1898, 1899, 1901, 1902 (dates mostly calculated from census entries). I doubt there were any children born after 1902 who survived as they weren't with their mother in the 1911 census.  Susan Jane definitely travelled to Canada and is mentioned in this record by name.  Dorothy travelled to Canada as a British Home Child in 1912 and died shortly afterwards.  I've not been able to trace Ethel after the census in 1911 when she was 8 (so she would have been circa. 21 in 1924 and so is a possibility for the illegible sister.  I've not been able to trace Ellen after the 1901 census when she was 15. She would have been circa 38 in 1924 and so is another possibility.  However, try as I might, I can't make the illegible name read Ellen (maybe Nellie?) or Ethel... "
589,MacFamilyTree: underlining the preferred first name,"I recently switched to MacFamilyTree (8.0.10) and a) would like to know whether it is possible to have one first name underlined (or somehow highlighted) in the program, like:  John S̲e̲b̲a̲s̲t̲i̲a̲n̲ Smith  The underlined first name (is there a word for it?) would be the name which the person preferred to be called (not a nickname), but the order John Sebastian would be the official order.  b) More generally, how do you highlight the preferred first name of your ancestors? "
590,Did the Army know when somebody in the Reserves died?,"I have now obtained my grandfather (TJ)'s Army Records and they're a very interesting read...  To put it mildly, he was neither a good soldier nor one who believed in staying with the colours throughout his 18 years of active service (of which he spent 5 years either in a state of desertion or AWOL). He also lied through his teeth when he signed up about his marital status and the name of his next of kin (conveniently air-brushing his wife, child and parents out of his background).  They're a very convoluted set of documents but luckily there's a neat summary of his service in a letter to the Police in Winchester in late February 1954 (and why did they need to know, I wonder?)  He was released from Active Service to the Unpaid Army Reserve on 15 April 1946 and released from the possibility of further recall on 10 Feb 1954 (when he would have been approaching 49).  I'm still trying to track down his death, so my key question is: when the Army marked somebody's records as ""Attains age of 4[5?] No further liability for recall"" did they know he was still alive at that time, or was it a purely clerical exercise? Did soldiers in the Reserve have to keep the Army informed if their contact details changed (fat change TJ would have done this, I suspect, although the records for my father, who completed his National Service in 1948 and was also discharged from the Reserves in 1954 recorded a number of changes of address in between 1948 and 1954, so there was apparently some mechanism for notifying changes ...). Did they need to attend any regular activities? Or could a reservist die without his record being updated.  "
591,"If widow remarries, do English records ca 1820 show maiden name?","In England, if a widow remarries, is the marriage record more likely to show her maiden name, or the married name from her previous marriage (circa 1820)?. From what I understand, in Scotland, a widow would use her maiden name, but I don't know the practice in England.  Specifically, I have this record showing that a widow, Maria Morgan, married James Marshall in 1822. I'm trying to determine if it is more likely that ""Morgan"" is her maiden name, or the last name of her deceased husband. "
592,At what age did girls leave home in 1880s England?,"Ellen Sutton (born to Harriet and John Sutton 1868 in Wolverhampton) appears in the 1871 Census, but not the 1881 Census, even though her siblings do. The death index shows that a 4-year-old Ellen Sutton from Wolverhampton died in 1872, so this may be her, but there are later census records for an Ellen Sutton from Wolverhampton in a different household as a lodger and a servant, respectively. Was it common in the 1880s for a 13-year-old girl to leave home to work as a servant or live with relatives? "
593,Incomplete transfers of y-STRs from FamilyTreeDNA to ySearch?,"I have used FamilyTreeDNA's transfer to ySearch for each yDNA test I have had done and I just happened to notice today that for a yDNA-111 test, the transfer is incomplete, transferring only 67 markers even though ySearch.org has entries for many more.  I manually updated all the ones showing - except where they should be blank and corrected several that had a 0 value and now it shows I have 95 markers, still short of the 111 tested.  What is going on?  Is this a bug or is Family Tree DNA trying to make their private platform more valuable, or is something else going on? "

596,"What happened to Gustav Adolf Neumann, 1859 immigrant to the US?","According to notes passed down by my granddad (from an unknown source), I have an relative, Gustav Adolf Neumann, who was born 1824 in Leipzig, Saxony, and who eventually immigrated to the United states, arriving on the sailing ship Louisiana in 1858/1859 from Bremen, Germany, to New York, USA -- see the ship manifest New York Passenger Lists, 1820-1891 and the general United States Germans to America Index, 1850-1897. (I know that the birth year on the passenger list is estimated as 1825, but this is a proven mistake, due to a calculation error in the databases linked above.)  I found potential informatiopn that he might have fought in the US Civil War -- either in the 7th Regiment, New York Infantry or in the 75th Regiment, Pennsylvania Infantry or in the 15th Regiment, New York Heavy Artillery, as seen on the U.S. National Park Service's Soldiers and Sailors Database. But there is no (dis-)proof yet.  Where can I look for more records about his whereabouts, death, marriage or eventual army records?    Search results from U.S. National Park Service Soldiers and Sailors Database:     Results for Soldiers Showing Results 1 - 3 of 3  Neumann , Gustav  Battle Unit Name: 75th Regiment, Pennsylvania Infantry Side:  Union  Neumann , Gustave  Battle Unit Name: 15th Regiment, New York Heavy Artillery Side: Union  Neumann , Gustav  Battle Unit Name: 7th Regiment, New York Infantry Side: Union    (No results with the same search for Confederate Soldiers.)  Addendum:  After a break, I continued the search for Gustav Adolf Neumann whereabouts. I tried the following collections on familysearch:    New York Deaths and Burials, 1795-1952 New York Marriages, 1686-1980 New York Naturalization Index (Soundex), 1792-1906 New York State Census, 1865    without any results.   Do you have any suggestions where to look online for Gustav Adolf Neumann (1824-?)? If he was fighting in the American Civil War, he might have been killed/went missing in action. Is there a ""complete"" list of all/most fallen soldiers during that war somewhere? How likely was it that Gustav Adolf changed his name to one more English and, if so, which would it be given his original names?  "

598,"Apprenticeship records or trade information for 1830s Sheffield, Yorkshire?","This is the same family as in the related question Finding residence information for Toronto in the 1840s?  I have two references to George Hindley in Sheffield, Yorkshire -- both identify him as a tailor.  I'm looking for apprentice records or trade records that might provide further clues to George's origin.  The clues I have in Yorkshire:   1841 Census HO107/1338/23 on Bailey street in Sheffield (extract from FamilySearch) -- transcription at findmypast and image at findmypast:         Joseph Butler       M   40-44   Yorkshire    Mary Butler         F   42-46   Yorkshire   Ann Drake       F   22-26   Yorkshire    John Drake      M   3   Yorkshire    George Hindley      M   20-24       George's entry is marked N (Not born in this County).   marriage announced in the Sheffield Independent August 14, 1841 Page 5:      On Sunday last, at Upper Chapel, by the Rev. B. T. Stannus, Mr. George Hindley, tailor, to Miss Hannah Drake.   Massachusetts records, which pointed toward Sheffield, also gave their parents' names:   The marriage record in Massachusetts from George's second marriage in Pittsfield, Massachusetts (1857) and his Massachusetts death registration (1885) in North Adams say that his father's name was Samuel but no mother's name is given.  Hannah's death registration from Williamstown, Massachusetts in 1856 says that her father's name was Jonathan Drake.   George and Hannah's oldest children were born in Canada (1844) and New York State (1845-6?); all the rest were born in Massachusetts. My best guess for this couples' migration path, based on the records in hand and the reported birthplaces of all the children, is from Sheffield to Toronto, Canada, to Albany New York (via the NY canals or railroads), to Berkshire County, Massachusetts. The date range for emigration is between August 1841 when the couple got married in Sheffield, and Samuel's birth in Toronto (5 Feb 1844 according to Samuel's Naturalization records).  George's son Samuel is a shoemaker. While looking for possible records for Samuel Hindley (candidates for George's father), I found a Samuel Hindley, shoemaker, in nearby East Retford, Notts. -- according to GENUKI nearby places, 22.3 miles (35.9 Km) to the E of Sheffield.  This entry for a George Drake Hindley, a British subject born in the USA, enumarated in Brightside Bierlow, Yorkshire West Riding in the 1871 Census (indexed at FamilySearch) may be George Hindley's son, born 1855 in Williamstown, Berkshire County, Massachusetts, and is under investigation.  Trying to find information on extended family plus friends, associates, and neighbors in Massachusetts has been problematic -- any possible business or occupational-related records for Yorkshire West Riding and the surrounding area would be useful, including general papers on industry in the area for context.

599,Seeking Notation for common ancestors across different family branches?,"You have first cousins, second cousins, cousins thrice removed that share a common ancestor through one family line. You can even be a first cousin, as well as a second cousin, to the same person depending on the different family lines connections. But I'm curious about what we call our ancestors.   If you have an ancestor that is connected to your family lineage multiple times, through different lines, is there a special designation for that relationship?  Random Eg your paternal greatx7 father is the same man as your maternal greatx7 father. Or paternal greatx7 father is the same man as your maternal greatx7 father AND maternal mother's greatx7 father. The examples go on and on (and don't forget about the more incestuous relationships).   Are they your great X 7 father X 3? Third degree? Raised to the third?   More simply. Brother and sister marry. Your dad is your partners dad and any kids you have will have the same grandfather twice. Aunt marries nephew. You dad is you partners grandfather and any kids you have will have the same man as both their grandfather and great grandfather.  And what happens when there is a generation mismatch: when the common ancestor is in generation 7 in one line and generation 8 in another?  CLARIFICATION EDIT: the answers so far have provided very helpful information, unfortunately not exactly what I was asking. Maybe I muddled up my written question.  I'm not asking how to describe the exact lineage of an ancestor eg John Smith is your mother's father's fathers mothers fathers mothers mothers father. Looking at the answers provided, that seems to be pretty well documented with numerous different systems that all have their pros and cons (some very interesting ideas out there).  I investigating if there is a simple notation I can add to a relative's name/ family designator to say they connect to 2, or 3 or more lines. I can then choose to look in more detail at that persons notes etc to figure out the exact different relationships. This would reduce the number of detailed lineage abbreviations I would have to add to the end of some ancestors entries on my tree, if they connect multiple times.  I have attempted to answer my own question. Please have a look. "
600,How to get permission and best order to upgrade DNA testing for deceased person?,"I have a deceased cousin that has a yDNA-12 test from 2004.  I would like to upgrade their test to yDNA-111, BIG-Y, and Family Finder Autosomal.  I'm concerned that their sample is twelve years old and may not be a good one, plus I don't have access to their login on FTDNA.  Also, how long are these samples retained by Family Tree DNA?  How should I approach this with FamilyTreeDNA to get permission and maximize the information we can get out of this sample?  Should I instruct them to upgrade in a particular order?  Should I inform them of the goal and let them drive the process?  Can the Big-Y be done together with the upgrade of the STRs to 111?  Or perhaps it is better to do Big-Y on other distant cousins and based on results of those do targeted testing? "
601,Cannot find ship's manifest for family arriving in the US around 1890,"Some of my distant cousins arrived in the US around 1890, but I have been unable to track down a copy of the ship's manifest that documents the arrival. It is possible that they did not all come together, but this seems unlikely as the children were young around the time of arrival. The family came from Russia, from around St. Petersburg. Here is what I have:  Family as of the arrival date:   Peter (Pesach) Axel, b. abt 1860, d. 1922 Sarah Axel, b. 1860-1865, d. 1933, (wife) Jacob David Axel, b. 1880, d. ? (son) Lewis Axel, b. 1886, d. 1943, (son) Jennie Axel, b. 1888, d. 1976, (daughter) Tamah Axel, b. 1890 or 1891 in Russia or New York, depending on which census records you look at; d. 1983 (Daughter)   Evidence for immigration:   Jacob David Axel's index to naturalization petitions (dated 6 Mar 1905) shows an arrival date of June 15, 1890 in New York. According to his naturalization record, Lewis Axel claims to have arrived in Boston on or about the 9th of June, 1891. Sarah Axel's 1933 death certificate claims that she resided in the the US for 43 years, 40 of which were in New York. This places immigration around 1890, and not to New York. First unambiguously US-born child is Mathies Axel who according to the 1930 and 1940 censuses was born in New Hampshire in 1893; his SSDI entry says he was born in 1892, but helpfully omits the place of birth.   So the evidence points to an arrival some time around 1890-1891, but I cannot find the ship's manifest. I have tried looking for all the children and for the parents, both in Boston, in New York, and elsewhere.  It's possible that the reason I cannot find the information is that their last name was not listed as Axel, but I have not found any hint of what their last name might have been. I have tried searching without specifying the last name, but that too has yielded nothing plausible.  What should I try now? "
602,Why haven't more programs adopted Gramps XML free format?,"What short comings if any does Gramps XML free format have; that has stopped other major genealogy programs adopted it as a transfer format?  Why don't more programs accept it for import seeing it is idempotent?  I am aware of GEDCOM (this is about Gramps XML).  Note:(In reference to a comment by @DaleAthanasias ) The portable gramps package is not specifically what I had in mind, but I admit it would be handier than just sending a GEDCOM and separate media. "
603,What should I be doing to 'preserve' digital media?,"The originals of most sources that genealogist use today reside on paper. Many have been digitized to allow easy access, but the original is still a physical piece of paper in some archive.   As more 'original' sources and more 'research documentation' go online, is it possible it will become outmoded and information will be lost.   For example, I don't have my late father's pc anymore. I copied off it what I thought I needed - but in retrospect may not have been thorough enough. I exported a gedcom from his software and have kept that for the last 5 years. But if I went to recreate his data today I could no longer do that since the programs, data formats, etc no longer exist.  The above paragraph is an example of potentially losing 'research', either my own or of a third party. As more data transitions to being only being available online (eg an obituary, a family reunion photo, etc), should we be doing something to preserve this data for future generations of genealogists?   The digital image of an obituary in an 1880 newspaper can be a prinary source because the it's really just like a 'citation' to the paper that got scanned. It would still be possible to go back to the paper original is there was any question of authenticity of the image. But with an ecopy of a webpage containing an obituary, is my copy of that site still useable as a primary source? Once the webpage disappears, my copy can not be authenticated.  There are some projects to 'archive' the internet. Is any thought being put into 'genealogical relevant' archives?  Is there anything I should be doing to archive my work and e-sources I use?  Are there standards, recommendations, best practices for preservation of genealogically-relevant digital data?   I am asking this question in GFH instead of digital-preservation because it is genealogy specific.  "
604,Incorrect NYC marriage index?,"I looked up the marriage between Lilly Axel and John J. Corper in the NY marriage index, and found this record.  The wedding occurred on Dec 25 1919, and was registered in early 1920.  I then ordered the microfilm for FHL roll #1644060 and looked up marriage certificate #1280, to discover that it listed the wrong couple. In fact, examining the dates on the certificates of film #1644060 suggests that it is from the beginning of 1921, not from 1920. Retroactively looking at the FHL listing for this film, it indeed shows that the roll contains certificates 501-1750 from 1921. The correct film (assuming the certificate number is right) seems to be 1643530.  My questions:    How common are such errors (off by a whole year!)? How trustworthy is the certificate number?  What was the indexing process that led to such errors? What is the most effective way to notify IGG (the keepers of that database) to update it?  "
605,Name change records for New York City (NYC)?,"One of the people I am researching appears to have changed her name: in the 1915 NYC census she appears as Reva Osernoff, living with the Axel family:    Similarly in the 1920 federal and 1930 censuses:      But in her marriage record from 1937, she appears as Riva O Axel.   This suggests that she adopted the name of the family with which she lived most of her life, which is not that surprising. My question is whether this kind of a name change would be documented somewhere. In particular, would her original parents' names be likely to be listed there? (I know her father's name from family lore, but not her mother's name.) "
606,"Where can I search for elusive vital records (birth, names of parents, death) for my great grandmother, Celina Drollet?","Celina/Salina Drollet (or Drowlette,Drolet,Draulette,Drollette,etc) (b. abt 1866) and James Comstock (b. 1874) were the parents of my grandmother Mary Amelia Comstock (Mary was b. Mar 1897 Saranac, NY and she died 1997 in Ithaca,NY).   Celina was married once before she married my great grandfather, James comstock, Born April 1874 in New York. I do not know her maiden name. I have absolutely no clues what her real maiden name was. That name is the key to tracing her geneology and without it I have nothing else to go on. I tried the LDS site, ancestry.com to no avail.   I cannot find any birth, marriage or death records for Celina or even definitive evidence for how her name was actually spelled.  Every census has a different birth year for her.  I would like to find her headstone to see how her first name was finally spelled.  I saw on one census that neither she nor James could read or write. She spoke French among close family members. I find her on several census records and her son Frank and daughter Emma's marriage applications but that is it.Also, I noticed that her daughter Emma was born about 7 years before she married my great grandfather, yet Emma carries the name Comstock. Is Emma from the first marriage and was Selina about 10 years older than James Comstock?   Please help me find Celina's marriage record, burial place. Who were her parents?   Also, where is her husband James Comstock buried? I cannot find his death certificate or burial place or marriage application either.  Celina died first, around 1930 in Saranac , New York area and  she  lived her entire life in the Saranac, NY area. James went to live with my grandmothers sister at the end of his life somewhere in NY. "

608,Is Mariner to Nautical Assessor a likely career change in late 1730s Bermondsey?,"In What records might survive of nautical assessor who died on London Docks in second half of 18th century? I have presented evidence that the father of John Stacy (1759-1831) was Henry Stacy, perukemaker of Bermondsey.  This does not fit with a family story that can be found in ""Colonial Cameos and Genetic Gambits - the Stacy Brown Story"" compiled by Albert E. Stacy (my 1st cousin twice removed) in 1986.  In it he writes on page 12:     Reliable record also has it that John Stacy's father was a nautical   assessor on the London Docks and was killed by a fall in the hold of a   merchant ship in the course of his duty.   It seems unlikely to me that the professions of perukemaker and nautical assessor would belong to the same man.  Yesterday, I came across the Will of John Stacy, mariner, of St Mary Magdalene, Bermondsey that was written on 12 Feb 1736, and proved on 5 Mar 1741, naming his wife Catherine as its executrix:     The National Archives; Kew, England; Prerogative Court of Canterbury   and Related Probate Jurisdictions: Will Registers; Class: PROB 11;   Piece: 717   Although I have no baptism records for John Stacy (1759-1831) or his candidate father, Henry Stacy, perukemaker of Bermondsey, I have found records of three candidate brothers to Henry:   Francis Stacy/Stacey, a Custom House Officer, and his wife Elizabeth, of Long Lane, baptised a son John (born 21 Mar 1748) on 13 Apr 1748 and a daughter Nancy (born 7 Oct 1751) on 3 Nov 1751 at St Mary Magdalen, Bermondsey John Stacey, an Officer, of Snowsfields, buried his son John, age not given, on 20 Jul 1759 at St Mary Magdalen, Bermondsey Thomas Stracey, of Snowsfields, buried his daughter Elizabeth, aged 4, on 8 Feb 1760, at St Mary Magdalen, Bermondsey   Three of the four “brothers” naming a son John, when no other son’s names are known for any of them suggests that their father may have been named John.  From this I am speculating that John Stacy, mariner, may have had four sons born between about 1725 and 1735 when he wrote his Will in 1736, and omitted naming them due to their young ages.  Is it likely that a Mariner might return from the sea to become a Nautical Assessor?  If so, perhaps the family story may have been a mistelling of:     John Stacy's grandfather was a nautical   assessor on the London Docks and was killed by a fall in the hold of a   merchant ship in the course of his duty.

609,Reasons for leaving Germany in 1886?,"Have done much reading, still trying to figure why great-grandparents would have left Germany in 1884-1886?    Went through Luxembourg, then to Antwerp, to Philadelphia. Land ownership,freedom and women's vote could have been attractions to America.   But with German economy developing, and no war then, what could have made them want to leave? "
610,Dealing with different birthplace and names of parents in England?,"I am researching my 2x great-grandmother.   (Ann) Norah O’Brien BIRTH ABT 1860 • St Pancras, Middlesex, England DEATH 16 JAN 1923 • Exeter, Devonshire, England, United Kingdom   Her life has been quite a mystery.  I’ve posted a few questions about her before.   What does &#39;in attendance&#39; mean on an England death certificate? Did my potential ancestor lie about his wife dying so that he could marry again?   Problem  Basically I cannot trace my tree back anymore because there is ambiguity surrounding her parent’s names, her place of birth, and date of birth. I also can’t find any matches on the previous censuses.   She says different things about her age and her birthplace on her marriage certificate, and on the 1901 and 1911 censuses.   1901 census: [website]1911 census: [website]I found her death certificate and I’m confident that it’s hers because the name and the name of her eldest son matches. It would put her birth year at about 1861.  On her marriage certificate it says that she was the daughter of John O’Brien but when I look at this suspected birth certificate it says James O’Brien.  I looked in the GRO Index. I left the place of registration as a wildcard. I tried all years between 1858 and 1868. I also tried both of her names Ann Norah O’Brien and Norah O’Brien.  I found one record for Ann Norah O’Brien in 1860 for St. Pancras.   If I assume that the birth certificate is correct her parents’ names were James O’Brien and Ellen O’Donnell.   I have looked in the 1861, 1871, and 1881 censuses. I only found one record that kind of matches.  [website]"

612,Calculating segment cM from 23andMe matches?,"Going through my list of matches I'm working on a triangulation analysis. (Such that if person A matches from position 10-15 and person B matches from position 10-13 I can break out position 10-13=A&amp;B, 14-15=A.  I want to weight each segment by cM and I figured I can derive some segments using subtraction. For example the cM for 14-15 would be the cM of 10-15 minus the cM for 10-13 as reported by 23andMe.  However I see that 23andMe is giving me different cM values for the same segment in some cases. Example below:    What does this mean? In the same test why would there objectively be a different distance for 2 people between 8,307,849 and 12,628,471? "
613,How is it possible that my ancestor left the workhouse so quickly with a baby?,"I am still researching my 2x great-grandmother.  Ann Norah O'Brien BIRTH ABT 1860 • St Pancras, Middlesex, England DEATH 16 JAN 1923 • Exeter, Devonshire, England, United Kingdom   She had 5 illegitimate children. I ordered all of their birth certificates.  Her eldest son was born in the Bristol Workhouse. She was working as a domestic servant and became pregnant so then she went to the workhouse.   Within a very short period of time (about 2 years) she moved from Bristol to Stroud and appeared to have started a new life. She became a charwoman, a shopkeeper, a hawker and then a housekeeper of no profession.   Her children are spaced about 2 years apart nearly in sequence which would seem like she was in a relationship.  How would it have been possible for her to leave the workhouse so quickly with a young baby and become a charwoman/shopkeeper?  She was working as a domestic servant at 10 St James Parade Bristol in 1894. I found that dwelling in the 1891 census and she wasn't there. What kind of dwelling was this?

617,Understanding double cousins?,"I’ve been trying to find out the identity of my grandfather for quite some time and recently, new DNA matches have meant it easier for me to narrow it down. I have 3 matches that are all descendants of one particular relationship (Bridges/Nisbet) who were their great grandparents and I am roughly 2nd cousin cM to all of them, so looking at their family tree, there are possibly around 3 people who would have been old enough to be my grandfather at the time he was born.   A question was asked of me whether I had considered the father could be a descendant of a sibling to GGrandpa Bridges, but that was refuted as I have Nisbet matches too. Pretty solid so far....  Until I found out that the sister of Bridges married the brother of Nisbet and had their own children etc etc. As there are now two bunches of Bridges/Nisbet DNA, I suppose it does make it possible that I am descendant of this other relationship.   How could the fact there are double cousins get in the way of what I already have done?   Is there a way to find out whether I am a double cousin to these matches or a true cousin?   If I was a double 3rd cousin instead of a true 2nd cousin, my dna matches with these three would be weaker than what they are ( roughly 300cm each)? "

620,Reading cause of death?,Ernst [Ernest] Staines died in 1936 and his cause of death is shown here:    taken from FamilySearch.  I'm having difficulty reading the cause of death.

I can understand him dying from Toxaemia/Gangrene (I suspect we'd call it sepsis now) but would like to understand the full picture. 
621,Seeking DNA-test for family membership of ancestor 400 years back along paternal lines?,"I have foolishly accepted to act as an advisor to my uncle (on my mother's side), and find that I am quite unprepared to do so.  He is trying to follow up a family tradition that his x-GF (all on his paternal line) emigrated to southern Germany from Switzerland in 1589. His last name is concentrated in one village in Germany, whereas the name is quite prevalent throughout Northern Switzerland (with concentrations around Zurich and around Winterthur/St. Gallen). I have been in email contact with a person in Switzerland who shares my uncle's last name and participated in a largish DNA study on Ancestry.   According to this gentleman, there are two unrelated groupings of the family name, which correspond to the geographic distribution. The Winterthur members of the family are related to each other, but not to the Zurich group, and vice versa. The Southern German group was not represented in the study.  My uncle would like to test the family tradition, but he asked me for advice about the DNA tests. It sounds like a Y-DNA test would be most appropriate to prove descendance along the male line. If there is a match with either the Zurich or the Winterthur strain, then that would confirm the family tradition. If not, the tradition looks a bit shaky.  Through the aforementioned gentleman, I think I can get access to one person from each group, but I am not sure if that is a good idea.  On one hand, is it possible to link into the existing study? Since most likely the genetic split would have happened more than 400 years ago, I am not sure what a match or absence thereof would prove.  On the other hand, I have done my own DNA through 23AndMe and was told  my Y-haplogroup. The analysis says that this particular haplogroup arose about 10,000 years ago and is shared by something like 20% of all European males. This seems to indicate that a Y-DNA test might not be all that useful, either.  I have been reading that familytree.com has a proper Y-test, but I do not understand the differences, and I am totally confused at this point.  What is the best DNA test to study whether a male 400 years ago belonged to one of two particular families if all one has is 21st century data? "
622,Missing expected Norwegian ethnicity in Family Tree atDNA results?,"I just received my Family Tree atDNA results which show 97% British Isles. This seems to be a major error because it shows my Dad's lineage (BI) but completely leaves out my mother’s lineage which is all Norwegian documented to the 1600s. But the FT DNA results show not even 1% Scandinavian! How is this possible?  The FTDNA ""matches"" show all of my maternal line Norwegian surnames (from both my grandmother and grandfather) and many proposed cousins in Norway. So FTDNA is picking up and recording my Scandinavian DNA, but not showing it in my Origins section.    Could the results go back as far as the Viking Age when Vikings kidnapped hundreds of men and women from Ireland and brought them back to Norway as slaves to work the farms or be wives/concubines? Or did I inherit just my father's DNA and not my mother's? But why would there be matches for all her ancestral surnames? Was there a British/Irish/Scottish invasion of the Sognefjord at some point 500 years ago that is not common knowledge?  "
623,Interpreting 17th century German church record?,"I'm an amateur genealogist and I have browsed through 17th and 18th century German church records in pursuit of my ancestry and I am now stuck.  Background  My sources come from: [website]I have used the following table to help me interpret the texts: [website]What is blocking me is a birth record for a certain Henning Conrad from 1691. The reason why I believe this is my ancestor is that he is mentioned (at least that is my assumption) in his sons (whom I have much more sources for) birth record from 1716 from the same town (Gestorf). This would make Henning Conrad about 25 years of age at the age of his sons birth which is plausible.          Johann Wilhelm Warneken, He?ning Conrad W???????? ??h? geborn ?? 3?

624,"No age shown for daughter who ""died while the revision was being compiled""","In the 1850 revision list (ревизские сказки) for my ancestor's household it has no age listed for his daughter; but says only “умерла при составлении сказок” (“died while the revision was being compiled”). Meanwhile his sons all have a phrase like “вновь рожденный в 1847 г.” (newly born in 1847) as well as their age in 1850.  Does this notation mean she died in 1850 or does it refer to the entire time since the previous revision, i.e. she died sometime 1834-1850? All other deaths listed in the revisions note the specific year.  Were there specific circumstances in which the age and birth year were both left out of a revision list, such as a newborn infant dying? (The parents married 1833 and had sons born 1837, 1842, 1844 and 1847, so the daughter could plausibly be the oldest child, the 2nd child or a newborn.) "
625,Can half sibling category actually be full sibling?,"I was adopted and used AncestryDNA to help in my search.  Recently, I received an alert that a had a match to a ""Close Family"". People in that category include Aunts, 1/2 siblings.   Is there  possibility that she is immediate family and in fact a full sibling?   Our Ethnicity is different but we have already established that that is quite possible given the mix from our parents.  Both potential parents are deceased so we are not sure how to determine?   My adoption records indicate that her father is my father but then she should have fallen in the Immediate Family category. "

640,"Where are the Nov 1908 to May 1909 Islington Workhouse, Highgate Hill Infirmary records online?","I am looking for records of my family who were in the Islington workhouse and Highgate Hill Infirmary (HHI or St. Mary's) around 1908-1909. I have already found many records including admissions and discharge into the workhouse, hospitals and children's homes plus a settlement exam. However there's a gap in the records on Ancestry just where I need info on the sudden disappearance of my great-grandfather.  I'm looking specifically for HHI records around February-March 1909, but e.g. I can't find the first half of ISBG/278/009 before May. I'm also looking generally for anything up to late 1910 when the remaining family moved to Shoreditch.  These are the London Metropolitan Archives records I'm most interested in:  HIGHGATE HILL INFIRMARY: WEEKLY ADMISSION AND BOARD ORDERS 1908 - 1909 [LMA title] Reference Code:  ISBG/278/008  HIGHGATE HILL INFIRMARY: WEEKLY ADMISSION AND BOARD ORDERS 1909 - 1910 [LMA title] Reference Code:  ISBG/278/009   I have found parts, but they are ""continued from another roll"" which I cannot find. I have looked across the various top-level collection which have different parts of the puzzle. (I don't know why Ancestry has split these LMA series up and scattered them between these collections).  In my travels I have found random parts of books under other items, so I have performed the laborious task of checking every single Islington item in in all collections in the image browser and checking it only contains one book (and documenting the mapping). Usually the giveaway is a high image count - e.g. these indexed 250 page books should be about 600 images, so seeing 900 images is suspicious. Some ancestry items have up to three LMA books hidden in them, depending on the length of the microfilm roll. The ancestry title is usually a best guess at the date range, taken from either the LMA intro slides or perhaps a look at the beginning and end which isn't always reliable.

641,Were Scottish middle names sometimes added later? Eg. Campbell,"I have asked questions relating to Alexander Campbell Harris before.  You may recall that I had issues with his year of birth due to differences between the information on the marriage and death certificate.  Taking the information from the marriage certificate his fathers name was Samuel Harris and his fathers profession was Mechanical Engineer.  On his marriage certificate his name is just Alexander Harris (it is only on his death certificate where his name is recorded as Alexander Campbell Harris).  By using the age at time of death (instead of marriage) it would make his birth 1875.  Family members have always said that there is a Scottish link here because of Campbell. So I decided to use FindMyPast first and the census logs and came up with:    The fathers name and profession is correct and the Alexander there is the right age. But it did not mention a middle name of Campbell.  So I decided to take things further and went to [website]HARRIS ALEXANDER M 1875 595/ 29 Irvine   I purchased credits to view the original document, which contains more information (such as actual date of birth, mothers maiden surname and date of marriage). He is certainly the Alexander Harris from the 1881 census log.  Parents info:    How can I know if this is our Alexander [Campbell] Harris? Is it possible that Campbell crept in later or is this not going to be the right person?  Alexander marriageinfo:   "
642,Run away marriage: why did people go to Maryland?,"I am tracking the marriage certificate of a couple who lived in NYC and who reportedly ran away in Maryland to get married between 1940 and 1945. NYC marriage indexes are available and it is true they are not on there, on any borough.  Before I look more into Maryland (records are not available online) I would like to understand why they would have gone to Maryland.  A few key points:   The groom had been married before and was divorced The groom was 25 years older than the bride (45 vs 20) The groom was not embraced by the bride's family because of different religions   I know that in the 20's and 30's Maryland was the Vegas of the North East because there was no waiting time between getting the license and ceremony and everything could be done in half a day, Elkton being the go-to town for this. However this stopped in 1938 when a law was passed implementing the 48 hours waiting between license and ceremony, and they got married after this.  I believe the groom would not have been able to re-marry in NY because he was divorced and probably at fault. That explains why going to another state to marry again, but why Maryland? why note Delaware? New Jersey? Pennsylvania?  Any pointers as to why Maryland remained a destination for people to re-marry would be very helpful. Cheers! "

647,Y–STR Male Lineage DNA Testing,"My father died never knowing who his biological father was.  His birth certificate has no father mentioned and whenever we speak to his mother who is still alive, she will not reveal any information.  He has a brother in another country who is considered a half-brother, but he may be his paternal brother however I was wondering....  If we were able to get both my DNA and my uncle's DNA sent together to a lab, would Y–STR male lineage DNA testing be able to test with high certainty whether my father and my uncle shared the same father?  Also would getting my uncle to send DNA samples half way across the world pose problems with shipping whilst maintaining viability of a reliable test? "
648,What does “linear forms” mean in this context?,"   Spanish heraldry is chiefly remarkable for the manner in which the different bearings are connected in the shield, and for the frequent divisions of it ""per saltire""; while Italian heraldry is simpler in its linear forms, though the objects and devices it employs more nearly resemble those of German than of English blazonry. (Jenkins, Robert C., Heraldry: English and Foreign, pVI)   Jenkins describes about marshalling of arms in Spanish heraldry and then explains the simplicity of ""linear forms"" in Italian heraldry. Hence, is it possible his intent alludes to a genealogical concept? In other words, is it possible his intent from ""linear forms"" does not refer to the ordinaries, but refers to the simpler forms of ""divisions of the field""?  In other words:   In Spanish heraldry there are a lot of instances with quartering. In Italian heraldry but there are a lot of simple coat of arms with no quartering.  because quartering in heraldry has firm relations with genealogical matters, so, there is a probability that Jenkins wants by use of ""linear forms"" also refers to the genealogical, and not only the heraldic, aspect of subject. (heraldic aspect of subject refers to the category of charges.)  "

650,How to find death record from late 19th century New York (State)?,"I have been looking for the death record of my great grandmother who died in Rochester around 1899. She was around 27 years of age at the time.  Her maiden name was Mary Gagnon, wife of Joseph Bean (also known as Jos Lefebvre). I suspect they lived in Ogdenburg, and were visiting one of Jos' sisters in Rochester when Mary died.   The sister is Selina (Celina), who was married to Raphael Page who lived on Ontario street in ward 16 at the time.  Where should I look for the death record of Mary Bean (nee Gagnon)?    As I said in my last comment, here's a more complete story for my case.  When I first decided to search for my lineages I asked my family for informations. When it came to Jos's history I recieved a couple of different epic stories. The one who caught my attention was told by an uncle who had followed his alleged trace up to Scotland. According to him Jos would have been a scots sailor who entered Canada hidden in a boat hold, kidnapped a rich merchant's daughter in Nova Scotia then ran away in USA with her. That uncle is obsessed by anything pertaining to army epics so that king of saga is dear to him. He came back from Scotland with great clan bloody epics stories he sherish as beeing won by alleged remote ancesters.  I found that saga so bold and there was nothing else serious enough to guide me I decided to start by trying to deny those assumptions. First, if Jos were a sailor, he shouldn't have had any need to hide in a boat to get here. Second, if he had kidnapped a girl in Nova Scotia, he couldn't have been able to travel all the way down to USA without being caught during the travel. Telegraph exists, and trains or boats have to call at some places during the travel. So that part of the saga doesn't make sense to me.  I started with what was available, my grandfather's birth record. My uncle went to Ogdenburg to have it so he could ask for USA citizenship. That record stated his father is Joseph Lefebvre and mother Mary Gagnon. He also got their mariage record. So why his father's family here are Bean ?  I started by consulting the different censuses of the time starting in Ogdenburg. Nothing under Lefebvre. I tought maybe they changed names for any reason. So I chearched for Bean. Then I found Archibald Beans family where Jos stands. He a 7yo boy. That age matches his age at death. The census states the whole family as canadians.  First proof of false assumptions, Jos was not scots and didn't get to Canada by fraude he was too young.  On his mariage record his wife is Mary Gagnon. witness Achiles Lefebvre and Peter Gagnon. Mariage in Ogdenburg 1891.  In the 1874 Montreal Lovell's Peter is listed as working for GTR railways. In the 1894 Lovell's I find Peter He lives near the railway and port at . He's a brakeman. In 1896 he's still listed in the Lovell's but now as a labor.   Archibald Beans lives also in the same area.  I look in the microfilms at LDS churh and finds that Jos has been maried first in 1887. His wife and child died a little more than a year later.  Then I find the original for his mariage with Mary and the birth records of his children except for one daughter, Lidy. His first child dies also less than a year after birth.  Then no other informations found in USA. All those records are under Lefebvre.  I then look for them in Quebec province and find, always in the Lovell's that both Jos and his in law live in Montreal no more than one street apart. The two families seem very close together. Then I find Lidy's birth record there. Jos signs Lefebvre on the paperwork. Jos lives there from 1892 to 1894 then the family leaves for Ogdenburg. Dec. 1895 Alfred, my grandfather, is born.  Then Jos states that Mary died in Rochester. I look in FamilySearch, in US and Canada GenWeb, Ogdenburg Genealogy site, Ancestry.com, CyndisList, Rootsweb. No success.  I used Mary Gagnon and all distortions of the name, Mary Bean, Lefebvre, Mrs Jos Bean etc. Nothing. Nothing.  I started a tree on familytree to draw some infos. No success.   It's like she came from nowhere and vanished. She died during a harsh period of epidemics of all sorts. Maybe she caught some virulent virus and died. I wrote to some churches in the area, no record on her and no answer too. The same for hospitals.  I tought that maybe he got her remains and buried her in Ogdenburg. No chance even in churches or cemetaries.   Maybe it's because I write to them places instead of getting there. I don't know. And I'm out of ideas.  These searches have been made a couple of years ago. I did some again in the last months. A lot of sites say that they have the records but I must pay before I see. I'll have to put a significant budget to consult all what they have available.  That's why I ask for help. Maybe some of you are already using these facilities. I did the same for some Brits and French some years ago. "
651,How to merge Gedcom files?,"A relative has sent me five GEDCOM files of different family branches.

654,Techniques for flagging unconfirmed information?,"I want to be more diligent about how I record the information in my lineage-linked software (I use Family Historian).  This question may be a bit difficult to describe because the plain-English words I might use for some of the concepts are already in use as specific genealogy terms, so bear with me.  (see note added below the dividing line)  For any given source in my source list, the quality of that source may vary.  I might have a digital image of the microfilm (which is the best we can get if the original document has been destroyed), a transcription of what is on the film, and an index to that collection.  The transcription itself might be a digital image of a printed book or an online text which I can scrape.  The same for the index.  The data might be further removed, that is, a one-name or one-place or ethnic study might extract a subset of the records for their own use and publish a transcript or an index.    My goal is to work from the finding aids to the original records, of course.  But while I do this, the process might also include collecting the best versions possible at each step.  E.g. I might start with the information from a website that published a list of German Naturalization records from New England, trace it back to the microfilm they copied it from, and acquire the digital image.  (After that, the REAL fun begins while I use that finding aid to find the original records!)  A program like GenQuiry will let me keep track of where I am in that process, but how might I flag the data in Family Historian that came from the very-poorest-quality sources, to show that this is something to be wary of?  For example: in one of the recently-published collections on Ancestry, their detail page for an entry in a marriage index was incorrect.  Looking at the image, I can see that the printed book's year is correct, but if this had been one of those cases where the data had been published online without the original image being available to view, there wouldn't have been any way to see that the year was wrong because of a transcription error.    How can this especially-shaky data be flagged without causing too much clutter?     The problem is that in the US we tend to use the 3 x 3 analysis grid described by Elizabeth Shown Mills in QuickLesson 17: The Evidence Analysis Process Map, which separates the source (container) from the information inside the source, whereas Family Historian follows the older model of describing the source as Primary/Secondary (rather than Original/Derivative).

655,Can anyone decipher the comment above Louis' name on this 1940 census record?,"Finally posting my first question, after answering many ;-)  The following 1940 census record from Bronx, New York has a comment written above Louis' name.  It seems to start with ""Party has"" or ""Party was"" -- but I can't figure out the last two words.    Can anyone else decipher the comment?  Some additional info that may be helpful:   Milton Davidoff is Louis' nephew -- he was living with the family and the circled X means he provided the household details to the census taker. Milton is on the last line of the page.  Louis' mother-in-law Celia Clayman was also living with them and is listed first on the next page. Louis' occupation in this census is Retail Fisherman Louis died in 1943, just 3 years after this census was taken, at the young age of 40.  So perhaps the comment might be related to him not living at home due to illness, being hospitalized, etc?

656,How old *are* these people?,"I have found records of the Axel family I am researching in several censuses. In addition, I have death records for both Peter and Sarah, the mother and father of the family. Below I present, in convenient tabular fashion, their ages as culled from the relevant census and death records:          Peter   Sarah 1900    40      35      1900 Federal census 1905    50      42      1905 New York State census 1910    49      48      1910 Federal census 1915    60      54      1915 New York State census 1920    58      52      1920 Federal census 1922    70              Peter's death 1925            64      1925 New York State census 1930            69      1930 Federal census 1933            73      Sarah's death   While I cannot be certain of who reported these ages in many cases, the 1920 and 1922 dates are most likely due to Sarah: She signed Peter's death certificate, and she was the only person not working outside the home in their household in 1920. So how on earth could her husband have aged 12 years between those two events? And she herself regressed nicely between 1915 and 1920. Merlin would be proud of her!  Both of them were born in Russia and emigrated around 1890, so I don't have any primary sources for their dates of birth. Other than throwing up my hands, how should I interpret these numbers?

658,Did son-in-law have a different meaning in mid-19th century England?,"Most modern dictionaries define family relationships in a narrow sense. So that ""son in law"" refers to the husband of your daughter. However, I have encountered a very different use in the UK census of 1851.   The 17 year-old son-in-law of Richard Holloway is not the husband of Sarah (or Elizabeth or Mary Anne) but the son of his wife Hannah (father unknown).  I would have expected either stepson or adopted son to be used to describe that relationship. But there is a certain logic to son-in-law, in that a male person not related by birth is being afforded the status of his son. Inheritance might have been a prickly issue but other documents suggest that there would not have been much property to disperse; and Philemon emigrated before Richard's death.  An ngram run on Google Books enables the relative frequency of the use of terms in published texts to be plotted through time. Although that tells us nothing about the meaning with which each is being used.    It is possible that this Census return was simply an isolated instance of the misuse of a term by an individual (either accidental or deliberate, to deflect attention from Philemon's illegitimacy) or it might reflect the more widespread use of a different meaning at that time.  It would be interesting to analyse a sample of documents from the 1851 census for similar cases, but evidence to confirm which meaning was meant would not be readily available. Are there other instances from this timeframe where relationship terms have been used in surprising ways?     Answer by Rob Hoare has provided confirmation that my interpretation is supported by others. Can anyone cite other examples that demonstrate this? "

This might be a desktop-based application such as Calico Pie's Family Historian, or a web-based one, such as MyHeritage's new Pedigree Map. Or it could be a general-purpose GIS program which the user has pressed into service for family history purposes.    To take advantage of mapping features, and other features in the software, users may standardize the place names in their genealogy database to the modern name for a place, rather like the Family History Library or other repositories might choose a specific gazetteer for their place authority -- only in this case, the standard place authority is the current map you see when you use Google Earth, or whatever place authority the GIS system uses.  However, some modern metropolitan areas extend past the borders of counties, and sometimes sprawl over state lines.  If a town crosses county boundaries, how do you make the decision about which county to standardize on?    I would like to know:   What are the criteria you use to make your decision?  Which geographical reference works or tools have been helpful to you?  How do you remember to check records in all the relevant jurisdictions? What are the advantages and disadvantages of using your approach to the problem?   (I'm restricting this question to the US so that we can develop questions and answers for different countries.)    Records generated by a particular county will have a specific county on them.  Records which have a specific street address will reveal which county the residence is in, or where the event took place.  However some items, such as newspaper obituaries, will simply refer to someone being a resident of, or simply ""of"" the town name.  I am assuming that the researcher is recording in notes exactly what appears on the documents.  "
661,Mitosearch Data Entry,"I'm entering my uncle's mtDNA results from FamilyTreeDNA into mitosearch. But I ran into two problems that their help doesn't seem to answer.    Problem 1: FamilyTreeDNA provides differences from two different reference sequences: RSRS (the Reconstructed Sapiens Reference System) and rCRS (the revised Cambridge Reference System).  Which one do I enter into Mitosearch?  Problem 2: See the dropdown in the above image. It allows entry of the four nucleotides A, C, G and T. My uncle's mutations include some heteroplasmy, which is the presence of more than one mtDNA sequence in a cell. They are represented by different letters. In my uncle's case, one of his mutations has a Y, which I understand to represent C or T. How do I enter this into Mitosearch?  "

663,Did Richard Hill and Blanche Todd live in India in the late 19th Century?,"My 2nd great grandmother, Mary Elizabeth Hill had a brother, Richard Demetrius Hill, born in Islington in 1858. He was living with his family in the 1861 census, and with his uncle in 1871. After that, he vanishes. He does not appear to be in the 1881 or 1891 censuses, and has no obvious marriage, offspring or other records in England. Richard eventually turns up, quite dead, in Weymouth in 1895. So where had he been?  A search turned up an unexpected death notice in Rootsweb archives of the Argosy, a newspaper in British Guiana (now Guyana):      Died    HILL - On the 28th October, at 20 Brunswick Terrace, Weymouth, Richard Demetrius Hill, son of Richard Hill, of Gloucester, aged 37; deeply mourned by his sorrowing widow.    The name is right (and uncommon), the age is right, and his father Richard Hill was from a village near Gloucester, so that must be him. But Guyana! And there's a widow!!  Richard's death certificate confirms his travels:   The certificate gives Richard's occupation as:     Commissary Department   British Guiana   Another Rootsweb site, transcribing an 1889 British Guiana Directory (PDF), supports this:     YR  PG       Last       First     Mid         OCC                    Employer                           Address              City/Area     1889   83    Hill      R.       D.         Jr Comm Tax     Chief Commissary Off.     Lombard St           So we turn to the British Guiana Colonists Index (also referenced, for example, by this question from @PolyGeo). On the page for H we find him (and a correlating entry for Blanche Todd on the T page):     HILL, Richard Demetrius   * Born: ABT 1858   * Married TODD, Blanche: 11 APR 1893, St. Michael's, Berbice   * Died: 28 OCT 1895, Weymouth DOR     Back to the Argosy for 1893 (PDF):     Married   HILL-TODD - On the 11th inst., at St Michael's, West Coast, Berbice, by the Rev. W. F. T. Elliot, Richard D. Hill, only son of the late Richard Hill, of Gloucestershire, to Blanche, second daughter of George Todd, Roehampton, Surrey.   So Richard was in Guyana by 1889, working as a tax commissar, and married Blanche Todd there in 1893. (There is also an R.D. Hill working as a plantation Overseer in 1882, I'm not yet sure if that's him.) Within two years, he was back in England, and died there.   I have identified Blanche's family, as there's only one good candidate with George Todd as her father. Richard's Will confirms this, by having Blanche's brother-in-law as an executor. Richard left Blanche his assets in trust, ""whether in in England or British Guiana or elsewhere"". Blanche herself is, I think, in the 1901 census in London, but nothing in 1911. A search for deaths in the interim served up a few possibilities, one of which turned out to be the right Blanche, who came to a rather unfortunate end:    Blanche's body was found on a beach at Walton-le-Soken in Essex in August 1907. This sad and lonely tale made the newspapers, including the London Daily News (BNA link) and the Chelmsford Chronicle (FMP link) (transcribed by me here), as a ""Mystery Woman"" found drowned on the coast.  Blanche's death certificate gives her occupation as:     Widow of   Richard   Demetrius Hill   Commissary   Indian Government   of Eastbourne     And that's where it starts to get confusing. Firstly, I am unsure how to interpret that description. There are, I think, three parts: ""Widow of Richard"", ""Commissary Indian Government"" and ""of Eastbourne"". (I am assuming that ""Indian Government of Eastbourne"" was not the intended reading, as that seems little more than a Daily Mail scare-headline 100 years too early.) The ""Widow"" part is obvious. But it isn't so clear, to me, whether the ""Commissary"" and ""Eastbourne"" parts are describing the occupation and residence of Blanche, or of her late husband.  Is there any convention to this entry, or any way of confirming the attribution of these phrases?  I have no evidence that Richard or Blanche did, or did not, live in Eastbourne, so it could refer to either of them. My current assumption is that the ""Commissary"" part does refer to Richard, as it looks like few women could hold such positions at that time. Richard did work for the Commissary in British Guiana, but I've found no records regarding India, with one exception. The Chelmsford Chronicle article asserted that:     Nothing definite has been ascertained regarding the deceased lady's life for some time anterior to a year or two back, when she came from India, where she resided for a long time with her husband.   Well, that doesn't really make a lot of sense. We know that Richard was in British Guiana from at least 1889 to 1893, and had little chance to go to India before returning to the UK by 1895. But perhaps Blanche and Richard spent time in India before moving to British Guiana and marrying.   If so, where might I find records of their time in India?   There seem to be very few records regarding the Indian Raj government, under which Richard would have worked in that timeframe. I've searched several of the links from the FamilySearch Wiki page for India, with no hits. I have looked in some of the British Army List documents referenced by @JanMurphy in chat, as they also include some Indian Civil Service appointments. Richard does not appear there, either because he was too junior to appear, or because those records didn't include his organisation, or because he wasn't there at all. The Indian Civil Service was an attractive career opportunity at the time, but that Wikipedia page suggests that only top graduates were likely to gain entry, and I've no evidence for Richard having gone to university. That said, I have no idea how Richard and Blanche ended up in British Guiana either - there's no indication that any other family members were there too.  So did Richard and/or Blanche go to India or not? My gut feeling is that India is a red herring, something misremembered by Blanche's sister perhaps. British Guiana is close to (and commonly associated with) the West Indies, and had a substantial Indian population then, so there's certainly room for confusion. The only mentions of India come after both Richard and Blanche had died, thus were second-hand at best. So this may remain as one of those tantalising unprovables that litter any family history. But wouldn't it be nice to know for sure? "
664,Military Record is the first sign of existence,"Are there any accessible records of missing persons in Scotland for the mid 19th Century?  I ask as I have a brick wall with my Great Great Grandfather, David Brighton (1825-1891).    The earliest record I have for him is his military records from the National Archives.  He joined the Royal Garrison Artillery in 1846. Served in the Turkish War and the Crimean War, being decorated in the Battle of Sebastopol.  I have full records of his post-military life - marriage, birth of children, census entries and death.  However, absolutely nothing before his joining the army.  No birth or christening records, no record of any parent with the name Brighton.  The military record states his place of birth as Montrose, Scotland.  I have trawled online records, have been to the Scottish Records Office in Edinburgh, and to Montrose.  There is no record of anyone with the surname Brighton living in that area at that time.  Indeed the staff at the SRO suggested there was noone called Brighton in Scotland at all around this time.  I am left with the conclusion that he gave a false name to the army.  Especially as he joined up at Newcastle on Tyne (Brighton Beach).  So, is there any way of checking for missing persons about that time?  Assuming of course he was reported as missing.  Although I suspect it will be impossible to confirm anyone I find is the same man.  I doubt he would have given a false birthplace too far from his real birthplace as he would have been given away by his accent. "
665,What month was Allie Tharp born as shown in 1900 U.S. census?,"On the 1900 census, the month for line 94, Allie Tharp is not legible to me.  I've compared to other readable dates on the page and cannot determine what month she is reported to have been born in, closest to my eye was Nov, but still pretty far from that.  Note line 90 has the same scribble.  What month was she purported to have been born in 1878?   "
666,What to do with an ancestor's diary?,"I just received a couple of diaries spanning a few years in the early 20th century from a relative. She told me she would like to see them be donated to the local historical society, but to feel free to share them with the family first.  My first question is: is it better to transcribe the diaries or scan them page by page? I'd like to have them printed and bound by one of the popular online book printing sites (the cost is very low so they'd make great holiday gifts!).  Also, the relative who sent me the diaries also possesses the majority of family genealogical resources (photos, documents, etc.). My side of the family was left with nearly nothing from our ancestors, and for this reason I'd like to ask the current owner of the diaries if I could substitute the originals with copies to donate to the historical society. How should I approach this matter? It would mean a lot to me to keep them in the family. "
667,What explains sharing a 28.6 cM DNA segment with a sixth cousin?,"According to GEDmatch.com I have a sixth cousin that matches my autosomal DNA on chromosome 6 in a segment that is 28.6197 cM from 16,806,001 to 42,035,791.  This only overlaps with my first cousin for 8.2424 cM from 36,403,640 to 41,721,750.  It seems strange to me that a sixth cousin would match such a long segment and further that none of my seven other close cousins that are also related to this person have a long segment.  After the matching 8 cM above, another cousin shows a 5.421 cM segment on a different chromosome, all other matching segments are less than 5 cM.  Does this make sense?  Could there be something wrong with the GEDmatch.com analysis or the DNA files?  Why would a match be so uneven across my cousins. "
668,Any issues getting FTDNA sample vials through airport customs?,I'll be flying internationally next week with the express purpose of collecting DNA samples from some Aunts and an Uncle. I'm bringing a number of FTDNA kits with me (totalling 8 vials). I plan on bringing them with me in my carry on luggage. Should I be at all concerned about getting those vials out of and back into the United States from a customs perspective? Does anyone have any experience or advice? 
669,How to generate a report of ancestors by generation?,"Somehow years ago I generated a report (a text file) that listed every person in a Personal Ancestral File (PAF v5) or GEDCOM file by their generation. I only had PAF to work with (and was also playing with a network analyser called Pajek), but I can't find such an option in PAF. How would I have done it?  I've attached here a screenshot of the old file, opened in Notepad, so you can see what information had been generated. The second column (of single-digit numbers) are generation numbers, going from the youngest generation as 1 to oldest generation as 11 (in this dataset). The *.rep file extension might be a clue as to what generated it.   This is not my family tree, it is from anthropological research. So I am not interested in solutions that report on my personal kindred - I'm not in the dataset. In fact, although the names in the dataset are all linked, they belong to multiple descent lines, so any kindred-based solution (e.g. ""tell me about all of Mary's ancestors"") will not work. Somehow I had stumbled upon a report-generator that took all 671 names in the dataset and returned their generational ranking. What might I have used way back all those years ago? What might I use now (preferably without buying anything)?   "
670,Identifying person in two 19th century photos (one from Hannover)?,"I found these 2 photographs in a cache of old family photos.  I suspect they are of my 2nd great grandfather.  I know from other sources that he was from Hannover and is the only family member that is from there.  The photos are mounted on cards with the photographer's studio ads on the back.  RFR: 12/5/2016  Added a 3rd photo that I believe is the same person taken much later in life.  This picture was taken in CT and I'm reasonably certain it is my 2nd great grandfather (the older, seated gentleman).  I have 2 other photos that have notes on the back positively identifying him but they are pretty poor quality.  The one feature that seems to be apparent even in those poor pictures is the corner of the mouth (his left hand side) and that seems to stand out in the 3 photos here.  My questions are:     Are these photos of the same person? Approximate age of person in each photo?  Approximate date of the photos? What kind of uniform is he wearing in the Hannover photo? Any other info you can provide about the photographers, possible military units etc?   My 2nd great grandfather was born in 1851 in Hannover (or that area), married and had at least 2 children in Germany, immigrated to Rockville, CT in 1882 or 1883.  With regards to the H Richer's photo...Following AndyW's suggestion led to a link showing a reverse of another Richer's photo.  That photo had a penciled 1913/04 that is identified as a 'Signatur' and seems to match the date cited for the photo (1913).  Do the penciled '57' and stamped 'A-6811' on my Richer's photo have some significance that can be used to date it?           "
671,"Meaning of term ""Alias"" in 1861 Lincolnshire parish baptism record?","In the 1861 parish baptism record for a probable distant ancestor of mine it gives the parent surname for the baptism of Mary as ""NORWOOD alias DOBBS"". What precisely does this mean?  I guess someone is illegitimate here but I'm not sure who.  From other data I'm fairly sure that the father's name is DOBBS. Mary's GRO birth entry names her as Mary NORWOOD,and in her GRO marriage entry as Mary Norwood DOBBS.  In the 1840 baptism record of the father's sister Jane, the parent surname is entered as ""NORWOOD (DOBBS)"", which presumably also implies ""alias"", and suggests that the illegitimacy covers more than one generation.     I can find no record of a marriage between Mary's parents in the GRO, and I have not checked the parish records as they are not online. "
672,Simple way to visualize First Cousin marriage,"I came across some blood relations / intra family marriages like first cousin marriages in some of my family history books that I have. They are all documented as text in a family history book, not as a pedigree. I tried MyHeritage.com to draw such a tree, but no luck. I don't think I can loop back a child node to an ancestor and create a marriage relation, but has to create another duplicate tree.  Reading about Albert Einstein's family history, I came across such a diagram. Is this the right way to show a family tree which has first cousin marriages or is there a better way? Is there a software or website where I can do something like this? "
673,Does the Church of Latter Day Saints perform a 'baptism for the dead' ritual for everyone they obtain records for?,"I have recently been to a family reunion in which we all offer updates to our branch of the family, such as births, deaths, graduations, etc. Therefore personal data about me, my kids and my parents is shared to a much broader group of relatives - hundreds of them - many of whom I do not know. I recently saw someone who is a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, that I do not know, post questions about my great-grandmother on facebook asking for her death dates and burial location. Another member of the family then scanned and posted the family group sheet onto facebook. It is a closed group, but I still felt strange about what might happen to this information.   Why does the LDS church search for genealogy records?   What do they do with the information (besides store it and make it available to genealogy researchers)? i.e. what is the religious use of this data?   If I have a member of the LDS church in my family, is it inevitable that they will perform a 'baptism for the dead' ritual for me, my kids, my parents, grandparents, etc. once we die?   PLEASE NOTE: I am not a recluse or a luddite. I am not interested in hoarding or hiding my data away, or ceasing my own hobby/interest in genealogy research, but I am concerned about religious activities performed in my or my loved one's names that we are unaware of. Therefore I am seeking clarification on the above questions. Thanks. "

I compared F236166 and F392491 and got no overlap, so I assume that means they half match my kit on opposite sides of the DNA.  Does that suggest that the two kits with no overlap are completely unrelated and thus will not help refine the relationship between my kit and F392491?  I'm interested in tracking down the unknown relation that is suggested to be a 4th level cousin between my kit and F392491 which only match at this location in chromosome 3, hence, I found overlapping matches at that location and only found this F236166 kit for an overlapping position.  How might I use these DNA tools and data to get additional data points to help triangulate exactly how we are related?  I believe the relation is through the Austria region and have no paper records for my connections there, hence, DNA is my best hope at this point. "

683,Seeking candidates for British ancestor who fathered children in Kobe (Japan) during 1890s?,"I have been considering a Mr C.Z. Ede to be the best candidate for my British great-grandfather who fathered children in Japan.   However, during the 1890s, there were many foreigners living in Kobe. So, I am now looking for people with similar backgrounds, as well as C.Z. Ede. The Japan Directory lists foreigners and it has been published every year from around 1870 until the early 1900s. I was looking for a person who lived in Kobe in that document.  The oldest brother of my grandfather was born in January 1893. The youngest of the three brothers was born in September 1899. I have heard that my grandfather did not know his father. So, I think he was in Kobe great from before 1892 until 1899. Roster principle person who was in January of that year is published. Persons listed in list 1900 and I thought that there is a possibility. However, great-grandmother is in the householder on behalf of her father's poor health in 1902. So, I think that is less likely to was in Japan is great-grandfather until 1902.  I think the person who left Japan in 1899 to 1901 in the person who was in Japan in January 1899 is to be a candidate of great-grandfather.  I have extracted a person where there is the possibility in addition to CZEde from its roster.  That is the next name. CZEde thought it was British because the company was the UK system. However, this time candidates, article does not clearly poor nationality. In addition, even obscure description, even I do not know whether individual or otherwise.

684,Who were the parents of the Anna who married Elisha Strong?,"Benjamin Dwight's History of the Descendants of Elder John Strong says that Elisha Strong ""m. Anna Pinneo, b. in 1746 (dau., as the author supposes, of Dea. James Pinneo of Lebanon, Ct., and Priscilla Newcomb)"" (p. 477).  Connecticut Vital Records to 1870 (The Barbour Collection) [available through Ancestry.com or American Ancestors] says that Anne Pineo/Pinneo was b. to James Pinneo and Priscilla Newcomb in Lebanon, CT, on May 15, 1732.    According to Dwight, Elisha and Anna's 8 children were born in the years 1769-1787.  If his wife was born in 1732, as James and Priscilla's daughter was, she would have been about 37 at the time her first child was born and 55 when the last was born.  This seems highly improbable.  If Dwight's birth year of 1746 was correct, she would have been about 25 at the birth of her first child and 41 at the birth of her last, which seems much likelier.  There is further evidence that the Anna who married Elisha Strong was born c. 1746.  Her headstone reads: ""In Memory of Mrs. ANNA STRONG wife of Elisha Strong who died 18 Nov. 1818 in the 72 year of her age"".  The implication seems to be that either:   The Barbour Collection mistranscribed Anne Pinneo's birth year. Elisha Strong married a different Anna (according to Dwight, also a Pinneo).   Porter's Genealogy of the Descendants of Richard Porter reports that the immigrant ancestor James Pinneo (ne Jacques Pineau) had three other sons besides the James who married Priscilla: Daniel, Joseph, and Peter. Perhaps she was the daughter of one of them.  I have only been able to find a list of Peter's children, which does not include an Ann/Anne/Anna.  Can anyone help straighten this out? "
685,What settings to use in GedMatch to confirm a seventh generation relative sharing DNA?,"I have a relative, Nancy Ann Trigg, who is 7 generations removed from me, so I expect I have one part in 2^7 (128) of her DNA in my autosomal DNA test.  I want to confirm this relation and found another who is descended from Nancy (probably around 7 generations too).  Comparing our DNA using gedMatch.com one-to-one comparison, I see:  Minimum threshold size to be included in total = 200 SNPs Mismatch-bunching Limit = 100 SNPs Minimum segment cM to be included in total = 4.0 cM  Chr Start Location  End Location    Centimorgans (cM)   SNPs 7   151,175,924 152,756,368 4.8 362 16  50,944,010  53,233,824  5.1 619 17  51,004,474  52,944,551  4.8 555 17  74,012,247  74,838,408  4.1 328 20  57,728,230  58,795,786  4.8 344 Largest segment = 5.1 cM Total of segments &gt; 4 cM = 23.6 cM   For my sister:  Minimum threshold size to be included in total = 200 SNPs Mismatch-bunching Limit = 100 SNPs Minimum segment cM to be included in total = 4.0 cM  Chr Start Location  End Location    Centimorgans (cM)   SNPs 2   7,479,337   9,272,120   6.1 445 7   29,486,454  31,878,908  4.3 701 16  50,944,010  53,233,824  5.1 620 17  51,004,474  52,944,551  4.8 557 17  70,397,218  72,817,547  4.9 626 17  73,311,163  74,418,948  4.5 350 Largest segment = 6.1 cM Total of segments &gt; 4 cM = 29.7 cM   For my cousin, also a descendant from Nancy:  Minimum threshold size to be included in total = 200 SNPs Mismatch-bunching Limit = 100 SNPs Minimum segment cM to be included in total = 4.0 cM  Chr Start Location  End Location    Centimorgans (cM)   SNPs 1   233,085,889 234,748,871 4.3 354 2   3,608,444   5,477,854   5.4 594 14  22,410,305  24,942,018  5.8 815 17  8,775,320   9,647,621   4.0 270 17  9,842,402   11,448,590  5.1 542 22  15,905,584  16,615,305  4.3 242 22  20,318,833  22,029,269  4.4 276 Largest segment = 5.8 cM Total of segments &gt; 4 cM = 33.2 cM   Then I did my mom, who should be unrelated:  Minimum threshold size to be included in total = 200 SNPs Mismatch-bunching Limit = 100 SNPs Minimum segment cM to be included in total = 4.0 cM  Chr Start Location  End Location    Centimorgans (cM)   SNPs 7   151,239,045 152,627,034 4.2 292 11  128,853,823 130,825,871 5.8 621 12  6,415,678   8,471,737   5.1 486 14  20,572,665  21,284,915  4.1 228 14  29,602,168  31,703,963  4.0 397 20  57,636,249  58,973,822  6.2 448 Largest segment = 6.2 cM Total of segments &gt; 4 cM = 29.3 cM   So, is a threshold of 4.0 cM and 200 SNPs a reasonable setting for a shared ancestor about 7 generations away?  If not, what are better settings to use, or is there a better approach using the Tier 1 tools on GedMatch?  Given that my mom matches just as much as the three who should be related, does that mean randomly picking another person of similar ancestry (e.g. European descent) going to give similar results and thus these matches are no more than random?  Perhaps I need additional distant relations to Nancy to see if we can find a DNA segment that keeps repeating? "
686,How to organize my genealogy downloads?,"My digital genealogy research is organized according to my needs: A flat folder hierarchy, a lot of tags (Finder tags provided by macOS), standardized filenames and tagging schemes. I have no difficulties to find what I need and to find it fast. I am not tied to specific software to handle my files.   What I struggle with is my inbox, namely my download folder: images, text documents, screenshots often sharing the following aspects:   from various sources  not properly named (47925^1^^s^1909^^1-00166.jpg) often not directly related to my current research often downloaded in between and not in a focussed research session    How do you handle these unorganized downloads, these finds by chance and all these pieces that might be relevant somewhen? How to sort them fast and how to store them? "
687,Finding information about Brick Kiln - Motcombe - Dorset,"My 2nd Great Grandmother's birth certificate arrived today.  She was born in 1858 and according to the entry the place of birth was:     Brick Kiln, Motcombe     The registration district was Shaftesbury in the county of Dorset.  I have tried to research Brick Kiln and located this website. It states:     All that part of the Parish of Motcombe called Tout Hill, Enmore Green, Cuttables, Brick Kiln, Calves Lane, Butter-Print, Coles Lane, SherBorne Causeway, Turnpike, Locks Lane, and Duncliff Farm.   But this doesn't tell me much about this actual area. Subsequent searches take me to a cottage:      Update  I did come across this interesting article which includes audio narrative and in part it states:     David Preston has researched Enmore Green’s brick industry and he was   keen to show me some of the historic records related to the brick   kilns, which once operated around the village. “The one at Hawker’s   Hill is well known and there’s a fair amount about that because it   went on for much longer. Nobody knows much about the Long Cross one,   and the brick kiln on Buttermilk Lane though,” said David, adding,   “Brickworks are essentially a bit ephemeral. They are usually on   farmland so if the brickworks closed down, the farmer cleared it away.   There’s not much left.”      These brickworks were situated at the bottom of the hill, below   Shaftesbury, because that’s where the clay lies. David reckons that   there were possibly a dozen brickworks in operation. “It wasn't a huge   enterprise and it was a bit seasonal because brickmaking was weather   dependent. You needed to be able to dry the bricks so there wouldn't   be much going on in the winter.” The industry started here in the   Georgian period. “It was in the middle of the 18th century. They did it   for about 100 years,” David explained.      Brickmaking would not have been a major source of employment in Enmore   Green. “You do find in early records that people were described as   brickmakers but not very many of them. Most of the people would have   been agricultural workers and there were a lot of cheesemakers or   cheese dealers, for some reason.”      The road on which St John’s Church is situated is now referred to as   Church Hill. But its name used to refer to the brickmaking industry.   “It was known as Brick Hill,” said David. “It seems to have changed   around 1910 because that’s when some people give their address as   Church Hill and others give their address as Brick Hill in the school   admissions. Presumably it was because it was more relevant to call it   ‘Church’ rather than ‘Brick’ Hill.”      You can spot the local bricks, if you know what you’re looking for.   “There is a distinctive type of Shaftesbury brick. It’s red with blue   ends and you can see some of them on Bell Street.” The thatched   cottage on that town centre street features this architectural detail.   “Those would have been bricks from Long Cross,” explained David. “The   blue was something to do with the way that they fired them. It   sometimes depends on the type of sand or clay that you are using to   make the brick in the first place.”   Since Enmore Green is heavily associated with Motcombe, it would seem to me then that ""Brick Kiln"" was just a specific kiln there in the village. That said, the audio refers to a map of the kilns but I do not know where to find that.  There is also a specific reference to a Brick Kiln here:    This could be related to this issue? "
688,Creating record for individual where no details are known?,"Where a child is born but no details of the father are known, should a record be created for that person and no details recorded or should no record be created?   The part hinting at this in How should I model family with unknown relationships? does not really answer my query. "
689,Where is Frankford Supply / Bristol Yards Located?,"I have a picture that includes this building that I'm trying to locate from 1958:    I believe the signage reads: Bristol Yards / Frankford Supply Co.  I believe this is in New Jersey, otherwise Pennsylvania.  It is next to this waterway and bridge, travelling toward New York City from Valley Forge:    Neither suggestion here appears correct to me.  Looking on Ancestry.com, I'm not seeing a way to search for businesses, just people.  How might I search business directories from this time period to locate the address or at least city of this business? "
690,Downloading documents at Family History Center (FamilySearch),"In my research there are several documents that can only be accessed at Family History Centers. The term used (when searching for these documents) is that they can be Viewed, does that imply that those documents can not be printed or downloaded/saved to (for example) a flashdrive?  Along those same lines, would such documents be copyrighted? "
691,Does age factor in when calculating relationship on DNA match,"A result of 193 cm from 100 year old, matched up to a 35 yo. Does the age of the participants factor in? The sample also showed  cross match. The relationship is estimated at 2nd to 3rd cousins. Does that mean i should be able to locate a common ancestor easier? "
692,Understanding Cursive /Joined Writing in Irish Register Death,"I hope I am not out of order asking a question re writing again but rethinking my effort on last query has resulted in me finding the record I need.  I am attaching another example of writing that I am struggling with.    Under Column 9 residence of informant the first name is hard to deciper?     X???X -  Gibson, son, present at death, 27 williamstown.  Any insights would be great  "
693,Comparing currency in different time periods?,"In the question How to order copies of English wills (post-1858)? I used as examples these two Probate Calendar entries, which are for a husband and wife. At the bottom I added some notes about the value of the estates, which should have been in a separate question.     ELLIOTT Charles Edward George of The Myrtles Slapton Devonshire   gentleman died 13 September 1911 Probate Exeter 28 January to Augusta   Elliott widow. Effects £631 13s. 11d.   and     ELLIOTT Augusta of The Myrtles Slapton near Kingsbridge Devonshire   widow died 17 April 1947 Probate London 27 September to Caroline   Louisa White spinster. Effects £6696 8s. 4d.   Taken as a raw number, it appears that Augusta increased her wealth by an order of magnitude between 1919 and 1947. But the value of estates from these two years can't be compared directly.  How can I adjust the figures so they are equivalent in terms of spending power, etc. and to get an idea of the worth in today's money?  The section below the line was copied-and-pasted from the earlier question (asked Jul 14 '14 at 17:58).    For completeness I will also include Verbeia's comment (posted Jul 17 '14 at 10:48):     Devaluation doesn't matter for calculating the current value of amounts of money in the past in the same currency. It would only matter if you were trying to convert pounds to US dollars or some other foreign currency. A better converter for past money amounts into current values for the UK is at the Bank of England.   The previous link is broken so I am assuming it was for the Bank of England's Inflation Calculator.    Results from the National Archives' Currency Converter:  Charles' estate --    In 1915, £631 13s 11d would have the same spending worth of 2005's £27,200.82 In 1920, £631 13s 11d would have the same spending worth of 2005's £13,398.27   Augusta's estate:   In 1945, £6,696 8s 4d would have the same spending worth of 2005's £173,772.01 In 1950, £6,696 8s 4d would have the same spending worth of 2005's £152,544.37   (I'm assuming the Archives' calculator takes into effect the devaluation of the pound in 1949, which is discussed in this related question on History.SE, What factors led to the 30% devaluation of pound sterling in 1949?) "
694,How could I be 10% French when there's no French in my mother or father's DNA results?,"Ancestry DNA says I'm 10% French. My father never got tested, but my half sister and cousin on my father's side (who were both identified by the site) both tested as 100% European Jewish. My comparison to my mother (she's on the right) is below. 10% seems well outside the margin of error, but it seems that if my father had enough French for me to get that my sister and cousin would have some too.   I got surprisingly little Italian and German. Maybe the French, Turkish, Spanish should have been Italian and German? Or can something negligible for a parent be non negligible for the child?  "
695,Using NYPL's City Directories of New York City,"I am searching 1900-1910 city Directories for Manhatten,the New York public library digitized these and they are available for view at thier digital Collections website here is 1901 What I can't figure out is how to get to a certain page (image), for example page 2700? Anyone with experience?  Messages to NYPL have gone unanswered. "
696,What is origin of hyphenated or double-barreled surnames?,"I found this answer by John Hanna which implies that the practice originated with the British aristocracy or 'upper-bourgeoisie' as @WS2 dubs them. This makes sense on a hereditary-rule/feudalism perspective where wealth and prestige were major points among families of the ruling class. It is easy to imagine the negotiation of a marriage could include a clause for a hyphenated surname for the newlyweds.  From a modern perspective, this looks an awful lot like marketing or brand management, where the bride's family has to protect their trademark to prevent their brand from being diluted.  I would like to know some of the additional history of this practice. Which family is the first recorded to use hyphenated names? Is the history of their decision documented? Is the practice actually adopted from another language or culture?  Also, at what point did a hyphenated name come to distinguish the individual over the family unit? Stated differently, when did hyphenating your name become popular across all segments of society? I'm guessing this is closely related to the women's liberation movement and civil rights movements in the USA, but I don't have a source for that. "
697,Which parent generally named the babies in 18th and 19th century USA?,"I have found, when researching long-dead ancestors, that sometimes the names that parents chose to give their children are the only glimpse I have into the inner life of those parents.  When I look at a list of sibling names, it makes me smile to picture the parents choosing the names with the same care we took when we named our daughter.  So I've often been curious which parent's tastes and preferences I'm more likely to be looking at in those names.  Among people I know, mothers tend to be the main baby namer in a family.  Fathers typically have input, and sometimes they may take charge.  But, more often than not, the names of babies reflect the tastes and preferences of their mother.  So my question is, how long has this been true of naming?  (American naming, in the case of my ancestors.)  In eighteenth or nineteenth century America, were mothers still the main baby namer?  I realize, of course, that historically babies were more likely to be named after friends and family.  But someone still had to be the one to say, ""Hey, let's name our son after Uncle Joseph."" Was that more likely to be mom or dad?  Or has it varied too much over time and across cultures to say?  (I'm also asking because my 3rd-great-grandparents gave their children names like Iberi, Avoca, and Iranarch.  And I'd love to know which parent's taste is reflected there!)  "
698,What can be gleaned statistically from Surname occurence in Population?,"Is there a calculation or test to determine if the occurrence of a surname in a population in a specific geographical area is statistically significant or just a random distribution?   For example, in a surname study of the most common 42 surnames in a geographic region, the surname Steele occurs 3249 times (3rd most common). The total number of families reporting a surname in the top 42 most common is 79408 and the total population in the geographic region is 119000. Obviously, 3249/119000*100= 2.71% of the population have the Steele surname, but is this statistically significant in population studies? "
699,"What reference materials discuss any ""known issues"" in the microfilms of 1930 US Federal Census?","I have been unable to locate some of the families I'm researching in the 1930 Census (for one example see my question What are good search techniques for finding people who have moved within the same geographical area?).  One well-known guide for US Federal Census information is William Thorndale and William Dollarhide's book Map Guide to the U.S. Federal Censuses, 1790-1920.  However, this work does not include the 1930 Census.  What other Guides exist for 1930?    Some basic information can be found at:   The portal 1930 Federal Population Census at NARA The Ancestry.com Wiki (wikified from their reference work The Source) article on 1930 U.S. Census The FamilySearch Wiki article United States Census 1930 The FamilySearch Wiki article on United States Census, 1930 (FamilySearch Historical Records)/Known Issues   Where else might I find information about other ""known issues"" with the 1930 US Federal Census?  Could there be EDs or pages within EDs which did not get microfilmed?   "
700,"What entitity compiles the ""US Public Records Index""?","There are several compiled indices of US Public Records which have been referred to as the ""US Public Records Index"".  In its various forms, it is compiled from an assortment of different records which are open to the Public in the United States.  Who compiles this information?  There seem to be at least four different collections which have been published under this name over the years.  First, the collections on Ancestry.com:   The ""Old"" USPRI (current data on living people)   Wednesday, March 25, 2009: Randy Seaver's Blog Genea-Musings:  ""Old"" US Public Records Index gone from Ancestry.com      It looks like [website]  Public Records Index database down from their collection. They said   one week ago that they would do this in an Ancestry.com blog post:   I only did a very quick search, but I did not find the Ancesty blog post Randy quoted from.  He goes on to say:     The previous U.S. Public Records Index was for the time period of   about 2000 to the present, although the user could never tell what   years were included for a specific locality or a specific person.    The ""New"" USPRI (""historical"" data)   On Thursday, March 26, 2009, Randy posted about the ""New"" U.S. Public Records Index on Ancestry.com and his blog post says Ancestry.com was showing the source information as follows:     ""Source Information: Ancestry.com.

The FamilySearch.org USPRI   Family Search now has a collection United States Public Records Index.  The catalog description says:     This collection is an index of names, birthdates, addresses, phone   numbers, and possible relatives of people who reside in the United   States between 1970 and 2010. These records were generated from   telephone directories, property tax assessments, credit applications,   and other records available to the public. The collection is now 53%   complete.

In addition to the catalog description already quoted above, the wiki says:     These records have been gathered from multiple sources. The original   sources are not available.

Clearly the information in the Ancestry.com USPRI and the FamilySearch.org USPRI cannot be identical if one collection has coverage from 1950 to 1993, and the other has coverage from 1970 to 2010.  But how many companies have provided this information to these two sites?  Is the MyRelatives.com site owned by Peoplefinders.com or vice-versa, and are either one of these companies a rebranded version of what in 2009 was the Merlin Data Publishing Corporation?  Whatever the source of this information may be, it is one of the most annoying sources ever, since it compiles data from all these sources and throws it all into one big pot with no way of telling which original record it might have come from.  Even worse, I've seen this collection cited as the United States Public Records Office, which makes it sound like some official government entity (as opposed to a commercial data provider).  I'd like to find out more about the compiler(s) of these collections so I can give the real history to the people who are mis-citing it. "
701,What fields are available from a Social Security Death Index (SSDI) search at different websites?,"There are several different websites that offer a search form for the Social Security Death Index, the public-access extract of the Social Security Administration's Death Master File.    Since November 2011, when new the restrictions were enacted, the search results I used to get have changed. RootsWeb's site (which used to have a good search form) doesn't offer a search of the SSDI anymore.    Does it make a difference which website I use?   What fields will I find in a search result? "
702,Techniques for reading poor or illegible images?,"What techniques work for reading poor or illegible images of a source? Turning the source into a negative is one that's often quoted but what other techniques are valuable, and in what circumstances? "
703,Persistent URLs (web addresses) for online records of genealogical events,"Are there any standards, or common usage, for the creation of persistent (long-lived) URLs (web addresses) for genealogy events?  (more accurately these would be called IRIs, but URLs are the more well-known term).  For example, Familysearch uses addresses like [website]Ancestry and Findmypast don't seem to put any effort into making their pages and records easily addressable.  The record returned from a search is often an address like [website]There are some ""persistent URLs"" in the academic, museum and library worlds, such as the Archival Resource Key and the Digital Object Identifier.  Are there any projects in genealogy to use these or similar persistent identifiers (and is the Familysearch identifier connected to these in any way?).  Once records online are identified with persistent identifiers, the identifiers can be used as source references that can be shared and published, with the knowledge that there's a better chance the reference will still be there in years to come.  At present, when a link to a web page is used as part of the source documentation of an event, there's a very good probability the link will be broken eventually (sometimes quite soon). "
704,Working with browsable images of probate records?,"FamilySearch.org makes images available for browsing before the (computer) indexes to the collections are available.  Recently some probate collections have come online, and I have made a couple of tries at browsing the collections to see if I can find research subjects.  How can I make effective use of my time, when I can't view an entire 'microfilm roll' in one session?  Step one of my research plan might be: generate a checklist of deceased individuals whose probate records might be in the area and time covered by the record collection.  The list should include the date of death and enough identifying information to recognize the person when I find their records.  For some of the veterans, this might include dependents who were mentioned in their pension applications.  In more complex cases, step two: create a timeline.  One of the estates I need to find was the subject of an extended dispute, and there are several newspaper accounts which refer to the court calendar, where the executor was required to make a new accounting.  This should provide several pointers to when records might have been made.  Step three might be a search for indexes to probate records for that locality.  What else might be useful when browsing the records?  I need some kind of checklist to keep track of what rolls I've viewed already, or where I left off, if I had to stop in the middle, but I'm not sure what would be most useful.  (One researcher I know created a Google Docs spreadsheet and made her own name index of the records as she went along.)  The specific collections I'm looking at are: Georgia, Probate Records, 1742-1990 and New York, Queens County Probate Records, 1785-1950  but I'd like to work up a checklist that would serve for any locality.  There is a related question: Are there checklists or templates made for visiting the Family History Library in Salt Lake City? -- what I'm trying to puzzle out is what elements need to be on a checklist.    Since I wrote the original question, a card index for administrations in Queens County New York has been published online, so I've found the record I was looking for in that county. See Using a card index to find Probate records. "
705,What is a brother-in-law?,"If someone calls me brother-in-law , what are they to me? A girl called me brother-in-law , what is she to me? A girl who calls me brother-in-law , what should I call her? "
706,Website software that will display 'stories' as well as traditional lineage-linkage,"I've a need to set up a website for a bunch of cousins who (maybe) share a common ancestry but who all definitely descend from people with the same surname in the same small village around 1800 and want to pool efforts to research and display our ancestry.  The website will be privately hosted with PHP and mySQL support.  There are a number of options for hosting a lineage-linked tree (Gramps, TNG) but neither of them seem well suited to showcasing the juicy stories (hellfire Baptist preachers, builders from one family who built houses for another in a town far from home, drunkards who regularly sent their daughters down to the pub of a pennyworth for beer or who avoided dying in a colliery disaster because they were drinking in the pub that day and rolled home long after their wife believed they were dead, wide boys who joined the army to avoid the police and ended up in India for 5 years, policeman who were dismissed the service for visiting a house of ill-repute...)  For clarity, these stories would be compiled using a variety of sources, rarely just oral testimony or family tradition. So for example, we have building deeds and census records and wills and probate records in a large town and census records and BMDs from a small village that demonstrate that one individual who set up as a builder in an industrial town far from home then built several houses for other migrants who arrived from the same home village. (And then left all his wealth to his sons, much to the disgust of his daughters). Or newspaper stories, letters to newspapers, census records, BMDs and references in diaries and journals (of non-relatives) that support an interesting narrative about the life and times of a Baptist preacher in late 18th/early 19th century Wales.  The bare bones will be in the lineage-linked trees, but we want to publish more polished narratives that bring the trees to life. and set the people in their geographical and historical context.  What options can I consider to host myself that will allow:   Collaborative maintenance of (sourced) family trees Publication and linking of stories about the individuals in the tree Information about the history and geography of the 'original village' and the 'destination industrial town'   I've reviewed Publishing family tree online? and Creating and improving family tree online with help from relatives? but none of the answers address the 'story' or 'place' aspect.  Implementing and supporting the website can be a fairly technical activity, but updating the 'stories', 'place information' and 'lineage information' needs to be easy for non-technical people. "
707,1935 residence in the 1940 census,"The 1940 census includes fields for the person's residence in 1935. The fields are city, county, and state. When it says ""same place"" for the residence in 1935, does that refer to the town or to the house? In some cases, such as below, it also shows the name of the state in the ""city"" column.    What can I infer reasonably from the ""same place"" entry? "
708,Citing German marriage documents from 1822,"I found a bunch of documents related to the marriage of Abraham DECKER and Rebekka ARON on FHL film 488380 labeled ""Eheverkündigungen, Heiratsbelege 1816-1826."" The documents are statements about and by the parents and grandparents of the bride and groom. There are almost twenty pages of documents, each from one to four pages long. At least some of them were created by transcribing death registers in various towns where the specific people lived. You can see all of the documents here.   I would like to cite these documents for the names, dates of birth and death, etc. of the people mentioned in them. What is an appropriate citation pattern for these records? How do I identify specific documents on the film when the film has no inherent structure or organization? "
709,Weird date/year issues; what is the correct way to present the summarized information?,"We deal with approximate dates all the time in genealogy. I don't have a problem entering the rationale or the date in my software or writing about it in a narrative.   I'm working on a project now that involves some charting. Specifically, I'm displaying ""life span"" information. Ala, ""Joe Smith (1699-1772)"" or ""Sally Thomas (1710-1781)."" The question arises about how I should display date approximations that are unique when my presentation calls for a summary (year).   Each time I run into one of these ""weird dates"" I ponder whether or not there is some collective wisdom/recognized approach to summarizing the approximate dates as years.     As in the examples, it's sometimes the date and sometimes the circumstance that causes me to pause. For example, should I write 1723/4 to summarize the year for a double date 6 March 1723/4. In the alternative, should I consider the baptismal practices of the day? If the children were usually 6 months of more of age when they were baptized, should my summary then read 1723?   In the third example, since the parents were at court and punished--if I consider court calendars and birth practices, I might deduce the child was likely born four months earlier--so should the year be summarized as ""1684?""   In the alternative, is the year summary always ""just the year"" from the approximated date.  I thumbed through some scholarly journals this morning, but did not spot an example that would have served as my guide. I'm not losing sleep over this but wonder if members of  group have crossed the same path.   Update (clarity): I have revised the graphic/examples in the hope more specifics provide clarity. The problem I find is that my approximate date qualifier doesn't always hold when I move from using a specific date presenting it in some more summarized form (such note DD MMM YYYY but YYYY). "
710,Missing pages from a ship's manifest?,"Images 81 through 109 of a certain collection of ship manifest records on Ancestry.com represent the passengers of the Tenyo Maru, which arrived in San Francisco on 10 May 1915 after calling in a number of ports in Japan and China.  These are the two-page ship's manifest records, but unfortunately, the second page for each set of entries is missing. Is there a way to tell whether these second pages were preserved, and if so, where they can be found? Is the only recourse to go to NARA in Washington DC to examine the records sequentially? "
711,Copyright Issues with Content Providers,"Many people are, or have been, confused by the T&amp;C's of the online content providers regarding copyright and sharing. Some of these seem excessively stringent.  This question relates specifically to what can be copied (and so later shared) from a site without breaking recognised copyright law. For instance, most sites allow you to save a copy of an image, despite them usually having copyright notices embedded within them. What about transcriptions? I know that an indexed database is subject to copyright separate from the source of the transcribed data. So, is making your own transcription from a copyrighted image OK, but copying the provider's transcription is not?  I have written some views on this myself at Derived Creations (currently section 13.2.1) but I am after a more definitive answer about the legality, especially considering different countries. "
712,Passing on our data,"Everyone here will have thought about the longevity of our data, including related artefacts such as photographs, documents, letters. What is the best approach for preserving this and ensuring that it survives our lifetimes?  Issues I am concerned about myself include:   The electronic representation of the core data. It would be naive to expect that all current software products will survive indefinitely. Hence, holding a proprietary database in some archive would not be a good move. If the data is represented in a non-database format (preferably textual in nature) then will that be readable indefinitely? Unfortunately, we only have GEDCOM at the moment and that is already inadequate for use as a definitive version of my data. Should photographs be saved in electronic format or as originals? Is jpg likely to be around for the longer term? How can originals be preserved? Who owns the data? If I give it to some online content provider then they will technically own the content, and may charge my descendants for access. If I pay some site for publishing my data, who pays when I no longer can? What sort of repository would consider and administer privacy issues? Some data should be preserved but not published to the world at large.  "

714,Where would I look for declassified CIA documents regarding 1960-1970s in Chile?,I am trying to research an individual who may have been involved with the CIA operations related to destabilizing the Chilean government during the 1960s and 1970s. I am aware there are a series of document declassified regarding Chile in this time. I have located an archive online with some documentation but it seems poorly presented and impossible to search.  Do a series of PDFs or other searchable text exist for the declassified CIA documents regarding this date and locale? Are there other documents online that are not covered by the link above? 
715,Recording person on Ancestry.com who may or may not have existed?,"I have received an old genealogy report from a relative and it reads thusly (names changed for brevity):  1. Parent b.

Ireland, single.     5.   v Child b. xxxx.         vi Child ? some accounts.   For comments like ""some accounts"" for the last child, how do I represent that on Ancestry.com? (Presumably as if to say, ""this person's existence is debated""?) "
716,Obtaining probate or administration documentation from solicitor?,"These two situations are linked, and relate to relatively recent grants of administration in England.   An individual died intestate about 5 years ago, and having no surviving spouse or children, her many neices and nephews were each entitled to a share of the estate. I have obtained a copy of the grant of letters of administration from HMCTS, so know who administered the estate, but know little else about the family. Can I obtain documentation of who received a share of the estate? A relative died in the early 1990s and upon the terms of her will divided her estate largely between three neices and nephews. However the estate was only valued at £7500, so the executors did not need to apply for probate. Thus there is no entry in the National Probate Calendar. Can I obtain a copy of the will of a person if neither probate nor administration was ever granted?   I know who the solicitor involved was (it happens to be the same firm in both cases, and the firm still exists), and suspect that contacting them would be the only way to answer these questions. Would a solicitor be allowed to release this information for genealogical purposes? Would it be considered acceptable to request this information? "
717,Determining whether FamilySearch entry is my ancestor and not a namesake?,"The Oskar Heftle and Johanna Wilhelmina Brackenhammer found in FamilySearch could be my ancestors but I'm not quite sure.  All I know is that one of my 3rd great grandparents was called ""Oscar Heftlé"" and ""Johanna Brackenhammer"" and were ""from Germany"". I know that Oscar was born in 1845 but do not know any other dates for them. They had a daughter whose name was Mélanie, and she lived in Switzerland and is in my direct matrilineal ancestry (I am not sure if the family as a whole emigrated or if only Mélanie emigrated when she became adult, but this is not my question anyway).  My question is, I do not know how common the forenames Oskar/Oscar and Johanna, as well as the surnames Heftle and Brackenhammer were in Germany in 1845. It is very possible that other persons would be born in the same year sharing the same forename and surname. The FamilySearch entry has no information confirming that they are married and got children, so I can not confirm or deny that this person is one of my ancestors.  It seems today that the name Heftle is almost extinct, Geogen shows only 2 entries remaining in Germany. The name Brackenhammer seems quite rare too. Can I use the fact that those names are rare enough to belive that the linked profiles are indeed my ancestors? Could we however imagine that the names were common 150 years ago? I also do not know how fashionable was the name Oskar and Johanna were in 1845, if they happened to be fashionable it would significantly decrease the probability that those persons were the ancestors I'm looking for.  EDIT:  Since I originally wrote this question, I verified that both were indeed my ancestors with reliable sources. However at the time of asking I couldn't know it yet. "
718,Proper British birth date syntax?,"I happened to come across a Wikipedia page that showed birth dates of a man's children and wives.  Their birth dates appeared to have the format, ""b. Q4, 1968"" as opposed to what his birth date was shown as, a more familiar, ""12 August 1931"".  I think I could assume that the Q4 means fourth quarter.  Is that fiscal quarter?  Is this commonplace in Great Britain?  (I am an American)  I suppose it might be to maintain some privacy, but I'd never seen this before. "
719,"Is there a Polish variant of the name Thillmann, and what does this name mean?","It appears my great-great-grandmother was named Thillmann, and was Silesian Polish, despite her name sounding German. I know many names and surnames have translations between both of those languages, and that the translation is not always obvious (for example Nowak = Neumann).  Does a Polish equivalent of this name exist at all? What could be the meaning of this family name?  Various spellings exists, such as Thielman. "
720,Searching databases for ancestors with aliases?,"I have a probable ancestor about whom I know very little, except for the fact that he used an alias and he is mentioned in his father-in-law's will. The two names are quite common - something along the lines of ""John Smith alias Jones"".  How are aliases typically indexed in major genealogy website databases? E.g. Ancestry, FindMyPast, FamilySearch, TheGenealogist, or others. I am thinking primarily of pre-19th century English parish register or probate record databases, where aliases are most likely to be recorded as such.  What techniques can I use to search these databases for a person recorded with an alias? Obviously a search for John Smith or John Jones alone will turn up a vast number of results, and it is impossible to see if they mention an alias without inspecting them individually.  Any general tips for searching for ancestors with aliases are welcome too. "
721,"In 17th century Scotland/Virginia, could a Jr. have a different name than his father?","According to all known records, John Burnett (b. Scotland 1610, d. Virginia 1686) had sons named John and Thomas.  The will of John's widow, Lucretia, refers to ""MY ELDEST SON JOHN BURNETT"" and ""my son THOMAS BURNETT JUNR."" I find it surprising that the the suffix ""Junior"" appears on the son with a different name than his father.  How unusual is that? The elder John Burnett is believed to be the son of Thomas Burnett (who died before any of John's sons were born). Would that explain John's naming his child ""Thomas Burnett Junior""? "
722,"Determining surname for 1782 baptism in Breconshire, Wales?","In Finding birth/baptism/marriage record for Priscilla who married printer Henry Hughes probably about 1810 in Breconshire, Wales? I sought vital records for Priscilla Hughes, the printer, of Struet, Brecon, Wales.  I now suspect that Priscilla may have been Priscilla Thomas who was baptised on 11 May 1782 at Hay, Breconshire, Wales, to Thomas Howels and Susanna. This is based on her age of death being 57 in 1839, the county where she seems to have spent her known life being Breconshire (Brecon, Hay and Talgarth), and her relatively uncommon Christian name.  ""Wales Births and Baptisms, 1541-1907,"" database, FamilySearch ([website]I have not seen an image of this baptism and am wondering how to interpret her surname?  I am assuming that she was ""Priscilla daughter of Thomas [Howels]"" so would it be appropriate to record her as Priscilla Howels? "
723,"Finding wills/probate for printers of Brecon, Wales who died in 1794, 1820 and 1839?","From Finding birth/baptism/marriage record for Priscilla who married printer Henry Hughes probably about 1810 in Breconshire, Wales? I know that my Hughes ancestors included three prominent printers in Brecon, Wales:   Henry Hughes (ca 1755 - 1794) Henry John Hughes (ca 1781-1820; son of the above) Priscilla Hughes (ca 1782-1839; wife of the above)   On 9 Feb 1820, in the Hereford Journal, Henry advertised a house to let at Wheat Street, Brecon.  He was recorded as being a Printer of Struet, Brecon.    I am not sure whether this was a property owned by Henry, or simply one in which he was acting as an intermediary for its letting, but, in any event, I suspect that the Hughes family would have had assets to do with their printing business that would have meant wills and probate were likely.  However, I have not found a will or probate for any of the three.  Some of their output as printers seems to be present in the National Library of Wales but I have not found their wills/probate there.  Am I overlooking a likely source for any possible wills/probate of theirs?  Would the two Henrys both dying aged 39 mean that they might not yet have been thinking about what happened after their deaths?  If they died without wills, would there be letters of administration somewhere to enable the assets to be handed on?  The eldest son of Henry John and Priscilla, also called Henry (ca 1809 - 1892) was also a Printer and Stationer, at first in London, but mostly in Trevithin/Pontypool, so I am assuming that the printing assets must have passed to him.    His own probate, on 9 May 1892, was granted to his sons Henry (newspaper proprietor and publisher) and David Williams (printer and stationer).   "
724,Autosomal DNA Chromsome Browser - Is there such a thing as a 'family trait' of shared segments?,"I realize the passing of genes is approximately 50/50 (reference Generational Loss of Data with DNA testing) with each generation and which genes are passed are commonly referred to as 'random' based on existing science.   I read the tutorial and then watched the FamilyTreeDNA hour plus long tutorial video on using the Chromosome Browser as well as some videos on their YouTube channel.  Like pointed out in one of the videos.. the 50/50 does not always apply and certain chromosomes can be preserved across generations.   Looking at my known relatives to a common shared ancestor I noticed this in Chromosome 1.  The main display person (dark blue background) and GREEN are half-siblings and share a common ancestor pair who is there great-grandX.   Purple is the grand son of dark blue.  Blue is GGGG-granddaughter of the common pair from a completely different child of the common pair.  Orange is a GGG-granddaughter of another child of a common ancestor pair. Yellow is one of about 4 others of 350 matches who have a small sliver in the that same segment of that area.     This segment starts at 202478548 and in the matches so far go for at least 19.29 cMs to 217120123 (the orange).   Is there such a thing as a common family pair segment region (i.e. the 202.. to 217..) that could be considered something like a ""trait"" (terminology may not be correct) that can be used to hone in on a specific set of relatives (or one of their ancestors) and should it be specifically looked for or utilized as a tool even at smaller segment sizes?   In other words, I realize I should look for other alignments / strong matches / longer segments as well but is it a proven and reasonable technique to hone in on a specific segment range of a single Chromosome to identify a particular relative?   Note: I am only showing part of the overall chromosome browser as I found the part of Chromosome one unique for such distance matches. "

730,How to differentiate John Ormond (husband of Katharine Henderson) from others of the same name?,"John Ormond, weaver, married Katharine Henderson, daughter of James Henderson, in Forfar in 1767. Baptism records can be found for three children:   Jesn Ormond (1768) Forfar Margaret (1771) Forfar Charles Ormond (1776) Forfar   His daughter Margaret married John Spence in Forfar in 1792. Charles married Betty Adamson in 1804 though no information is given on their marriage to confirm whether John is still living or dead.  John Ormond lived in Bankhead of Turfbeg, a farm on the outskirts of Forfar.   However, there were many John Ormonds born between 1700 and 1749 in Forfarshire, and several who were buried between 1775 and 1850 (though none in Forfar and no burial record for Katharine). Weaving was also a very common profession and so isn't very useful as a distinguishing feature. It seems Scottish burial record keeping during this time was extremely incompetent.  Are there any further options I can utilize to attempt to differentiate the John Ormond I am looking for from the others in order to possibly find a burial or baptism for him? I can't find a list of graves in Forfar during this time period online either. Is this simply a case of a name being too common to be traced further? "

For example, Freebmd.org.uk (cross-checked against the images of the old indices) has:     Surname   First name(s)       District    Vol     Page       Births Mar 1860      HARPER     Mary        Dudley  6c 9      Births Dec 1860      HARPER     Mary Ann        Dudley  6c 15      HARPER     Mary Ann        Dudley  6c 114      HARPER     Mary Ann        Dudley  6c 16      HARPER     Mary Ann        Dudley  6c 6   WestMidlandsBMD which is supposedly based on the records held locally (which are the precursors to the GRO indices) has the following (no quarters indexed):     Surname   Forename(s) Sub-District    Registers at      HARPER    Mary  A Dudley (DUD)    Dudley Register Office      HARPER    Mary A  Rowley Regis    Sandwell Register Office      HARPER    Mary A  Rowley Regis    Sandwell Register Office      HARPER    Mary A  Rowley Regis    Sandwell Register Office      HARPER    Mary J  Dudley (DUD)    Dudley Register Office   And the new GRO index of births has:     Name:  Mother's Maiden Surname:       HARPER, MARY       DAINTY      GRO Reference: 1860  M Quarter in DUDLEY  Volume 06C  Page 9   Having read Michael Whittingfield Foster's two books on ""A Comedy of Errors: The Marriage Records of England 1837-1899"" (which analysed the various stages in the record keeping process and assessed the opportunities for errors to creep in) I can well believe there were errors introduced in the process of transferring records from local to central records (and even before that in the process for transferring marriage records from a church to the local registrar).  However, in this case the local records seem to tie up with the old GRO indices (5 births) but the new index only has one.  Was the local index flawed, and the error transferred to the central index? Have entries been stolen from the central index (I have heard of pages being ripped out of the central registers)? Is there any other explanation that I've overlooked? "
733,Committed for Postnatal Depression 1930-40?,"Scenario:  1930-40's UK.  A new mother ""Mary"" (fake name) was institutionalised in an ""asylum"" for what the records state to be ""postnatal depression"".  The records frustratingly do not elaborate further.  We have no further documentation regarding this person other than a death certificate which indicates her date of death to be more than 40 years later at the same location (the place is still operational as an apparently respected mental health / psychiatric health hospital).  I'm deliberately being vague about dates and locations for privacy reasons.  We have no evidence that Mary was ever released at any point during her prolonged ""stay"" at this place.  Our family NEVER mentioned Mary under any circumstances, this leads me to think that her residence was not voluntary and was considered a shameful thing among the family.  Her children were raised by other family members and thereby I am fortunate to exist :).  Only since my more recent elderly relatives passed away was the veil of secrecy removed and hence I came to know about all this.  Basically the only information I have to go on are a self-researched family tree going back a few generations before Mary, including dates, addresses and so on.  My question:  This person is one of my ancestors and I want to know more about what happened to her.  Given the circumstances, do I have any avenues of investigation at my disposal to find out more about why and how Mary was institutionalised?  I fear that too much time has elapsed and also that such medical information is probably protected, but I'm not certain of this.  We have already successfully gone through the process of claiming her negligible ""estate"" through solicitors and so we can therefore prove our familial connection with her 100%.  If there is nothing we can do to find out more, then I'd really like to hear a medical professional's opinion on this story.  Is what happened to Mary something that happened often in that time period?    Why would a diagnosis of Postnatal Depression lead to 40+ years of involuntary detention?    Did the wars have something to do with how such institutions operated? "
734,Civil War-era death records for West Virginia?,"I am looking for the death record of Henry Morrison, born 1826/1829 in Pennsylvania, and living in Wheeling, West Virginia with wife &amp; family at the time of the 1860 federal census (October).   [website]I know that he died before 1864 as his widow is listed in the city directory as a widow by then.  There is one death record for a Henry Morrison in Wheeling, 1 Feb 1862, but his age is wrong and it states that he was unmarried (or maybe not?). [website]I have no evidence to suggest that he was in the Civil War on either side- the census states that he was a businessman in an iron foundry and family stories support this. There are no Civil War pension records for his widow either.  Any suggestions about how to find his 1860-1864 death record with such a common name? "
735,Connecting the Gassmanns of Untertürkheim and Fellbach,"According to family lore, the Gassmann name around Stuttgart derives from two brothers who immigrated from the south (some say Switzerland, others Northern Italy) and settled, respectively, in Untertürkheim and Fellbach, then two independent villages, today suburbs of Stuttgart.  In trying to verify this story, I found the following, although I am not sure of its authenticity:   Jakob (or Johann) Gassmann was born in 1646, married Anna Schönhaar in Untertürkheim in 1664 and died in Untertürkheim in 1693. I am doubtful of this, because I know that all the past church records in Untertürkheim were destroyed in 1693. I do not know the source for the wedding date and location. The earliest mention of a Gassmann in Fellbach is in 1664, when Hannss Gassmann married Maria Magdalena Jutzler on November 15th.    This is certainly consistent with the family lore, but that, of course, is not proof. I am trying to walk the timeline back a little bit, and in particular I am interested in establishing a family relation between Jakob (or Johann) and Hannss Gassmann. If the family tale is true, I have to look to the south for records, but I do not know what sources there might be in Switzerland and/or Northern Italy. Is there anything available on the internet? What else is out there that I might consult? "
736,What is my Lineage?,"My ancestors came over to Missouri from Baden-Württemberg, Germany during the 1880's as part of the 1.4 million German immigration wave that occurred during that time, mainly due to civil war and unrest.

737,GEDCOM: INDI.FAMC vs FAM.CHIL,"This question pertains to processing GEDCOM files. Specifically, establishing the relationships between individuals: Fred is a child of Mary, Mary is married to John, John is a child of George, etc.  Which spouse/child reference in GEDCOM ""wins""? INDI.FAMC/INDI.FAMS or FAM.HUSB/FAM.WIFE/FAM.CHIL? Ideally, I think, each INDI.FAMC is correctly paired with a matching FAM.CHIL, and likewise for INDI.FAMS and FAM.HUSB/FAM.WIFE. Could anyone offer guidance on how inconsistent references ""should"" be handled?  I have encountered GEDCOM files ""in the wild"" where the INDI.FAMC tags are not consistent with the FAM.CHIL tags. In other words, FAM records have CHIL references to INDI records without a matching FAMC reference. A pseudo-GEDCOM  example:  0 @I1@ INDI 1 FAMC @F1@ 0 @I2@ INDI 0 @F1@ FAM 1 CHIL @I2@ 1 CHIL @I1@   Here, family F1 lists person I2 as a child in the family, yet person I2 doesn't have the corresponding FAMC reference. I believe the ""correct"" interpretation is person I2 is not a child of family F1. Am I wrong?  The reason for my concern is also illustrated with the above example: person I2 has become an ""island"", with no relationship within the forest. Using the FAM.CHIL link, person I2 is no longer an ""island"".  Does anyone have any data about specific genealogy programs with a history of writing GEDCOMs with these kinds of problems? E.g. I have a GEDCOM created by ""Ftree for Linux"" with a bunch of these issues. "
738,Compiler / Author of printed Landowner record books in England and Wales?,"The website The Genealogist has a series of printed books which list landowners by county.  Each county book has a heading with the name of the county, followed by the Population in 1871, number of Inhabited Houses, and the Number of Parishes.   The landowner information is laid out in tables with these headers:   Name of Owner Address of Owner Extent of Lands Gross Estimated Rental   I am guessing that the figures for the Population, the number of Inhabited Houses, and the Number of Parishes come from the statistics generated when the 1871 Census record was taken, and that the information in the tables come from rate books such as the ones found in the Plymouth &amp; West Devon Rate Books 1598- 1933 on Find My Past.  What I'd like to know is the provenance of these printed landowner books. I've looked all over The Genealogist and I don't see an answer in their research guides.  The sequences for the individual county books don't seem to include any front matter (title pages, publication information, or lists of abbreviations found in the books).    Gross Estimated Rental is expressed in £. s. which seems clear enough (pounds and shillings).  The Extent of Land is marked A. R. P. -- is this Acre, Rood, Perch as seen on this Conversion Chart and Calculator?    Were these books for England and Wales published by the Office of National Statistics or one of the agencies that came before it?  I'd like to know so I can write a proper citation, and be sure I'm reading the entries correctly.   It would also be useful to know which years these books were published, so I could look for copies at other repositories. This is the kind of book which is ridiculously simple to look for if you know the title of the report, but if you don't already know, searching for the likely keywords yields too many results.    Update: according to the featured article at The Genealogist What Land Did My Ancestor Own or Occupy?, speaking about the Tithe apportionment, it says (emphasis mine):     The apportionment gives us the measurement in acres, roods and perches and the value of the tithe payable to the Rector. Infuriatingly, the size of these units of measurement could vary according to the locality that they were applied.  "
739,Where can I find information about Soviet Union arrests in the 1930s?,"One of my ancestors was arrested and killed in the purges of the 1930's in the Soviet Union.

741,"Is FreeBMD complete for England in the 1880s? (Or, finding Annie Louise Deady)","I am researching the family of Alan Ernest Leofric Chorlton the distinguished engineer and Conservative MP. I am having particular trouble getting good sources on his wife and her family.   Here is what I have so far:   A marriage record (ancestry.com) that states her father to be William Deady, deceased. At the time of her marriage, she was living in London and his permanent address was still in his birthplace, Audenshaw in Lancashire.      Transcription: Marriage solemnised at Christ Church in the parish of Christ Church, Holborn Square in the county of London.   February 14th 1907    Name      Age   Condition   Rank or Prof   Address   Fathers' name   Rank or Prof of Father Alan     Full  Bachelor    Engineer   Oak House,     Thomas Chorlton Solicitor Earnest                              Audenshaw Leofric Chorlton  Annie Full  Spinster   ---     10 Wilson Place    William Deady   Dec? Louise Deady     The 1911 Census (ancestry.com) that states her birthplace as being London, around 1884. She died young, in 1934. This is apparent both in the BMD records and is consistent with the recollection of her daughter.   From the recollections of her (now deceased) younger daughter, I know the following:   She was from a lesser social station than Alan. Apparently despite being a hard kind of guy, he was madly in love with her. She wasn't from an English family – maybe French or Irish.    Try as I might I have not been able to find a matching birth record or pre-1907 Census record for Annie that could confirm her parents. I believe that she is the daughter of the William Deady junior, builder and joiner of Lancashire mentioned in the London Gazette of 1869 in bankruptcy proceedings with his father, William Lloyd Deady. The elder William did indeed serve time in debtors’ prison. It seems they had made some unsuccessful property development investments.  An abbreviated version of my rationale for identifying her parents is as follows:   The only other Annie Louise Deady I have found born in London around the right time was from a poor family and seems to have married a man named Albert Baker (ancestry.com). Her father was also a William Deady, a sadler, so there were two Annies born to William Deadys around the same time. I just don’t think Alan would have crossed paths with someone that poor. The daughter of a failed builder would be below his station, but not so far that their meeting was unlikely. It would make sense for someone with family ties to Lancashire to have been the Annie that Alan met, even if she was born in London. The London birthplace recorded in the Census might not even have been correct, especially if she wanted to conceal the family bankruptcy. The William Deady I believe is her father seems to have been lodging away from his family in the 1881 Census, perhaps keeping a low profile to avoid further legal proceedings. His wife, Mary (nee Prescott) is recorded in that Census (ancestry.com) as married not widowed, but she and their children were living with her mother and siblings. But this is a few years before Annie would have been born. The fact that William’s occupation is ""Dec'd?"" with a question mark on Annie’s marriage certificate suggests she did not know her father’s whereabouts, which again would make sense if he was avoiding debtor’s prison. I can't prove it but the fact that William Lloyd Deady was bankrupted twice and went to debtor’s prison (he died in a Catholic care home) suggests that William junior might have avoided this punishment by laying low. Census records show that William Lloyd Deady was indeed born in Ireland, as was William junior’s elder brother John. Louisa is not such a common given name at this time, so it would make sense if Annie’s middle name was after her maternal aunt, Louisa Richmond Prescott (ancestry.com link to her probate record).   I can't rule out various misspellings in the BMD records, but haven’t found anything that fits either there or the 1901 or 1891 Censuses. (I haven’t been able to find her mother in the either of these Censuses either.)  So my question are:   Could the BMD records on Ancestry and elsewhere be missing enough records, or have enough mistranscribed records, that Annie can’t be found there? Or have I just missed something and I have not got the right William Deady?  "
742,"Were marriage certificates, granted after banns, recorded?","In the groom's parish of Bagillt, Flintshire, Wales, the marriage banns was recorded. At the bottom it says ""Certificate granted Sept 14th 1835"". Would a copy of that certificate have been recorded? What would the certificate say? Is there value in searching for it?  The marriage was recorded in the bride's parish of Llanferras, Denbighshire, Wales but I can't find record of the banns. I'm hoping to find a marriage record which mentions the names of the groom's parents and the certificate mentioned in the banns from Bagillt is my next idea. "
743,How can I ensure that I am making a reasonably exhaustive search?,"I am starting to do research on some veterans who served in the Civil War.  Several of the collections available online that describe service records are compiled databases or indexes collecting all the records about the veterans by name.    Some compiled databases found via online providers like Ancestry display the information for each name as if it were all about one person.  This makes it tempting to fall into the trap of ""it's the right geographical area and the right name, it must be the same person"".    The problems are like the scenarios in the related question How can I establish and describe my confidence that the child and the adult are the same person?  But my question today is the larger one of how to establish the context, and determine the quality, of the records I find.  For example:  a transcription of the notes made in a family Bible (itself a compiled source) records a Daniel Burns.  Some of his family can be located in Vermont.  The Bible says he died in the Civil War in Louisiana. Is this Daniel Burns the same person as the one in this memorial on Find A Grave?  The person who created this memorial knows the person his Daniel Burns married, but not his parents -- the Bible lists the parents of the younger Daniel Burns, but not the person he married.    Daniel Burns from the family Bible (the 'young' Daniel Burns):  Daniel is listed as one of the eight children of Samuel Burns (Sept 20, 1795 - ?) and Lois Stevens (Feb 22, 1800 - Nov 15, 1856), m. March 15 1812.  Daniel's nephew Edson Wellington Burns was born in 1849, in Jericho, Vermont (Chittenden County).  Here is Daniel's information, with the transcriber's notes in parentheses:     Daniel Burns  Jan 14, 1823 - Aug 22, 1862 died in the Civil War   Louisiana      Daniel Burns married someone July 1, 1848 (no name was written down)   Children unknown   The publication date of the Bible is a clue to when the entries were made.  Any events that took place dates before the pub date of the Bible were obviously recorded after those events occurred.  (They could not have been recorded at the time the events happened, because the Bible hadn't been printed yet.)  The Bible was printed and published by Case, Lockwood, and Brainard in 1872.  This means we know that all of Daniel's events took place before this Bible was printed, and they could not have been recorded in this Bible when the events took place.  Even assuming the earliest-case scenario that this Bible was the first printing, and that it was purchased not long after the Bible was printed, the Bible is too new; all this information was added after Daniel's death.    So far, this Bible transcription is the only source I have for the young Daniel which lists him by name.    These are the census records for a family in Jericho which match the information found in the Bible.  The 1830 US Federal Census and the 1840 US Federal Census only list the head of household, Samuel Burns, by name.  The ages of the children are consistent with what I would expect to find, given the information from the Bible.  There is a male of the right age in both of these census households that would correspond to Daniel Burns.  In the collection U.S., Civil War Draft Registrations Records, 1863-1865 on Ancestry.com, this entry made in May 1863 for the 38-year-old Vermont-born farmer, Geo. W. Burns, a resident of Jericho, is the right age to be Daniel's brother George Wallace Burns (Bible: born June 29 1825), the father of Edson Wellington Burns.  Among the other men from Jericho, there is a Daniel of the right age, but he is Daniel B. Bishop, also a farmer.  More investigation is needed to rule out an accident of copying.   In the 1850 Census, this record in Jericho, which I believe is the correct one, has Samuel and Lois, but only one of the eight siblings.  I have not found any other record for Daniel Burns in that census year.  Note that if the dates in the Bible are accurate, Daniel is already married by the time this census was taken.    Corporal Daniel G. Burns:  There is a photo of a headstone on this Find-a-Grave memorial, but it is very difficult to read.  As far as I can see, the information in the memorial did not come from anything on the stone itself.  The burial information associated with this stone is:     Chalmette National Cemetery, Chalmette, St. Bernard Parish, Louisiana, USA   Plot: Section 69 Grave 5557   The creator of the memorial is related to Daniel's wife's family, so I'm assuming some of the information in the memorial, like the statement that Corporal Burns was re-interred,  may have come down through her family.   Looking for historical records consistent with those assertions, I found this family in the 1860 Census, and a result from Ancestry's online database U.S., Civil War Soldier Records and Profiles, 1861-1865.  (In this case, we know the source-of-the-source material: Revised Roster of Vermont Volunteers During the War of the Rebellion 1861-66 published Montpelier: Watchman, 1892, viewable via the Internet Archive, which is itself a compiled source.    This history of the Vermont Volunteers has tables which list residence information, the date of enlistment,  the date of muster, the death date, and a column for remarks.   On Page 271:     SEVENTH REGIMENT   Company A.    Corporals   Daniel G. Burns Jericho, (enlistment) Dec. 7, '61 (muster) Feb. 12, '62    (Remarks) Died Aug. 22, '62 of disease.   The date of death (22 Aug 1862), the hospital at which he died, cause of death, and other information is recorded in the U.S., Registers of Deaths of Volunteers, 1861-1865 (images) on Ancestry.com.    Other records and information to consider:  Corporal Burns' widow Ann is listed in the United States 1890 Census of Union Veterans and Widows of the Civil War.  Ancestry's index reads as Daniel Q. Burns.  She is enumerated in Fairfax, Franklin County, Vermont.  Note that the enumerator or someone else in the office has written ""Killed"" with the date of death across the columns for the date of discharge and the length of service; the length of service was not recorded.       Ann Burns, widow of Daniel G. Burns, Coporal, (Company) A, 7 V(ermon)t   Inf(antry), (enlisted) 7 Dec 1861 Killed Aug. 22, 1862.   An index card from the collection, U.S., Civil War Pension Index: General Index to Pension Files, 1861-1934 (index and images) on Ancestry.com.  The soldier's name is Daniel G. Burns.  He served in Company A of the 7th Vermont Infantry, and his widow Ann Burns' application was filed on October 9, 1862.  There is a application number and a certificate number; the field 'state from which filed' is blank.  An index card from a Vermont, Death Records, 1909-2008 collection on Ancestry.com (index and images) lists in the Jericho, Vermont town records, a Dan'l G. Burns, Laborer, who died of fever in New Orleans, La. on Sept 10, 1862. (Informant on card: E. H. Lane, Town Clerk)  Notes about the sources:  We have the source-of-the-source for this specific entry in the U.S., Civil War Soldier Records and Profiles, 1861-1865, but there are other compiled databases about Civil War soldiers on Ancestry which do not have associated bibliographies, so it is more difficult to find out where the information in the indices or other compiled woks might have come from.  A research guide to the Compiled Military Service Records (CMSR) Compiled by Bryan L. Mulcahy, Reference Librarian, Fort Myers-Lee County Library, is available for download from Rootsweb.    The section about Union Veterans in the guide says:      Sometimes the “volunteer” enlistment papers show age, residence at time of enlistment,    occupation, and physical description.  If the soldier was hospitalized, a bed care card > will show the age, birthplace, marital status, residence, and date/place where soldier   was wounded. If the soldier died, a casualty sheet will show the date   and place of death and next of kin (if known).   Ordering the CMSR for Corporal Daniel G. Burns is likely to show his wife as next of kin (if any is shown) and the best I can hope for him or any of the other Daniel Burns' CMSRs is (maybe) the residence at the time of enlistment, which might confirm the residence and other information given in the Vermont Volunteers' roster.  (It probably won't have any information about his parents, unless he listed either of them as next-of-kin instead of his wife, which doesn't seem likely.)  The historical context:  It is tempting to say ""these must be the same person!"" because the marriage and death dates match, and the place of death matches.  Corporal Daniel G. Burns apparently comes from the same part of Vermont as the family from the Bible.  But BURNS is a common surname, and I dislike hanging an identification on so few pieces of evidence.  As Elizabeth Shown Mills says, one source is not proof.  How might I puzzle out how many men named Daniel Burns might have been in the population of Jericho, Chittenden County, Vermont around this time period?  How many might be in the  surrounding counties and states?  What techniques can I use in searching to estimate how complete the coverage in a record collection might be?    What other questions should I be asking to ensure I am doing a reasonably exhaustive search?    I'm putting some material here which was originally in the comments, and some which was edited out of the initial version of this question.  Since I did not make the extraction, I do not have any notes about changes in handwriting that would provide clues about when the other entries were made.   That information might have some bearing on how long we can establish some of the residence of the family in Vermont after Daniel died, but it's not relevant to determining the data bounds for Daniel's data, given the date of the Bible.  (From the publication date, it seems likely that one of Daniel's siblings purchased the Bible. The parents' generation is the first one listed.)  The topic of the weekly chat, Genealogy Chat 24 May 2014 | What's in a name? prompted me to get the question written before I forgot to post it.  I'll review my records and provide more information about the specific individuals when time allows, but my question here is about the larger question: how I can properly evaluate the quality of the data in each of the items I discover, which includes finding out data about the collections.

749,How to cite scanned image copies of physical books?,"As I presume others have, I've located useful source publications on the Internet Archive. The source templates I have don't seem to cover the case of a scanned copy of a physical book, other than for published microfilms. In this case, it isn't a microfilm, but it isn't a physical book either, so neither template seems to apply.  I'd like to be able to cite the source, indicating both that it's an electronic copy from archive.org, but ideally also including the associated information about the original scanned book (although I think the difficulty of listing multiple repositories for a source has been mentioned here before). I could cite it as a physical book, listing archive.org as the repository, but somehow that doesn't seem correct.  A question that has been asked in the past is What source detail should I include for a digital book? However, it mostly discusses digital books (e-books), not so much scanned copies of physical books. They do suggest just using the physical book template and adding the URL for the scanned version, which I suppose could be made to work. Seems clumsy, though.   My main concern is which template best applies to this case? "

752,"Seeking baptism record for William Slight, born ca 1832 near Haddington, East Lothian, Scotland?","I have mentioned my 3rd great grandfather William Slight before in Finding Edinburgh map engraver apprenticeship records of William Slight in 1840s? and Seeking marriage record for James Slight and Elizabeth Boyd from late 1820s probably near Haddington, East Lothian, Scotland? (in which I originally included this question).  The vital record that I am missing for him is his birth/baptism, which probably happened in about 1832.  This date seems consistent with:   the 1829 marriage banns of his parents the 1841 Scotland Census which gives his age as 9 (with an older sister Susan aged 11) the 1851 England Census which gives his age as 21 his Marriage Certificate says that he was 23 when he married Louisa Moore on 25 Apr 1852 at South Stoneham, Hampshire, England his Death Notice says that he was aged 58 when he died on 6 Feb 1887 the passenger list of the Shand, on which arrived in Portland, Victoria, Australia on 20 Jan 1855, says that he was 22.   His father was James Slight a Mason which I know from William's Marriage Certificate.  The 1841 Scotland Census verifies James (40), Elizabeth (40), Susan (11), William (9) and James (5) Slight living at Court Street, Haddington.  Note: FindMyPast gives their surname as High - they seem to be missing from Ancestry)   He had a sister, Susan Boyd Slight who, according to her Marriage Certificate was the only daughter of late James Slight, Mason, Haddington), when she married Robert Bruce Ewart (a Mason) on 4 Jun 1852 at Saint Cuthberts, Edinburgh.  Her 1873 Death Certificate in Victoria, Australia records her parents as James Slight and Elizabeth Boyd.  He had a younger brother, James Slight, who according to a declaration signed by his sister Susan Ewart (nee Slight) in 1867, was born in May 1839, but the 1841 Census suggests it was probably a few years earlier around 1836.  His mother's name was Elizabeth, which I know from his death record and the 1841 Census, and I believe her to have been Elizabeth Boyd who was born on 2 Aug 1796 and christened on 12 Aug 1796, at Haddington, East Lothian, to Thomas Boyd (a Mason) and Susan Cleugh.  His father appears to have been the James Slight born on 5 Sep 1797 and christened on 12 Sep 1797 at Whitekirk, East Lothian, to William Slight and Isobel Young.  All my searches so far have failed to turn up these vital records which I would love to locate, especially the first one:   William Slight's birth/baptism - probably about 1831-32 at or near Haddington his sister Susan's birth/baptism - probably about 1830-31 at or near Haddington his brother James' birth/baptism - probably about 1836-37 at or near Haddington   [website]However, when I searched the Old Parish Registers Births &amp; Baptisms on 31 Mar 2015 for:      Surname: ""slight""; Surname Option: Variants; Forename: """"; Forename   Option: Prefix; Sex: ""Any""; Date From: 01 January 1801; Date To: 31   December 1840; County: EAST LOTHIAN;   The only Haddington baptisms are:   05/07/1831 SLEIGHT MARY JOHN SLEIGHT/MARY BANE FR2280 (FR2280) F HADDINGTON /EAST LOTHIAN 709/00 0070 0155  24/09/1835 SLEIGHT ISABELLA JOHN SLEIGHT/MARY BANE FR2305 (FR2305) F HADDINGTON /EAST LOTHIAN 709/00 0070 0203    Both of these appear to be William's first cousins' baptisms and I know from FreeReg that:   Mary's was witnessed by ""William [I think this is William's paternal grandfather] and James [I think this is William's father] Sleight"".

753,Inferring date of marriage from dates of marriage banns in Scotland?,"This question is related to the answer from @vervet to Seeking marriage record for James Slight and Elizabeth Boyd from late 1820s probably near Haddington, East Lothian, Scotland?  I am aware of a similar question that relates to Marriage Banns in England and Wales (What are Marriage Banns and how can I use them in my research?) but this one relates to Scotland.  On FreeREG there is record of banns for my 4th great grandparents James Slight and Elizabeth Boyd:     Banns read 15th, 22nd, and 29th March 1829 at Haddington Parish   Church:   James Slight, of Haddington, and Elizabeth Boyd, of Haddington.   Witnessed by Thomas Boyd and William Slight.   If banns were read on these three dates, and in the absence of a marriage record, between those dates, and with three children being issue from the union according to the 1841 Census (see below), what is the most likely date for the marriage to have occurred?   5 Apr 1829 (a week after the third reading) 29 Mar 1829 (immediately after the third reading) or something else?   Knowing what is typical for marriages around that time and place will be helpful, but I am also looking for evidence to support whether this appears to be a typical marriage around that time and place.  The two witnesses appear to be the bride and groom's fathers.  The absence of a marriage record seems odd but I have not yet looked into where the registers (separate?) of marriages and marriage banns (or images) can be accessed to rule out that it may still remain available somewhere to consult.    The 1841 Scotland Census has James (40; Mason J[ourneyman]), Elizabeth (40), Susan (11), William (9) and James (5) Slight living at Court Street, Haddington.

756,"Meaning of ""In Whose Lot Interred: Hugh Sellars"" at Menands (Albany Rural Cemetery) in 1872?","I have previously asked several questions about my 4th great grandfather Hugh Sellars/Sillars that included Finding Naturalization Record for Hugh Sellars from Scotland who lived in Albany (New York State) 1855-1872?  Today I was alerted to a new record set by Ancestry.com:     Ancestry.com. New York, Wills and Probate Records, 1659-1999 [database   on-line]. Provo, UT, USA: Ancestry.com Operations, Inc., 2015.   Original data: New York County, District and Probate Courts.   I have not found Hugh there, but I did find three entries for his second wife Mary related to the same probate and then a burial record for her at:     Ancestry.com. Menands, New York, Albany Rural Cemetery Burial Cards,   1791-2011 [database on-line]. Provo, UT, USA: Ancestry.com Operations,   Inc., 2011. Original data: Albany Rural Cemetery Internment Cards.   Menands, New York: Albany Rural Cemetery.   From those records I now know that:   Mary died on 24 Apr 1872 at Albany with her last residence given as 311 Washington Ave (which is where their Variety Store was located).  She was buried on 26 Apr 1872 at Menands (Albany Rural Cemetery) in Lot 32, Section 103 which was the Lot of Hugh Sellars.  She was aged 67 and born in Devon, England. On 7 May 1872 Caroline Paleur, a daughter of Mary Sellars (who died intestate), was granted the administration of her mother's goods, chattels and credits.  I was not previously aware of this daughter but the 1865 New York State Census recorded that she had 4 children, and this is the first of those that I have been able to find.   There is no mention of Hugh in the probate, but the 1872 Albany Directories records him with a Variety Store and house at 311 Washington Ave which suggests he had been living with Mary until at least close to when she died.  That is the last time he appears in those directories, and the last record that I have of him.  Given the above, what might be inferred from the following on Mary's burial record ...    Does it simply mean that Hugh bought the Lot? Does it mean that Hugh was the first occupant of the Lot? If the latter then it is odd that Mary can be found using [website]As a postscript to this Q&amp;A I contacted the cemetery Registrar as suggested in this answer and, unfortunately, learned that they do not have a copy of the deed to this lot in their files.

759,Accuracy of place of death recorded in the National Probate Calendar?,"When I do not need or wish to obtain a death certificate, I have often used the National Probate Calendar for England &amp; Wales as my main source for death date and place information (in conjunction, of course, with the GRO index).  I have noticed that the inclusion of a death place in the NPC is somewhat variable, and up until 1967 a note along the following lines is included at the beginning of each volume:   This would imply that any instances where the place of death is not included in the index, one can assume that the individual died at their place of residence. However, I have one or two cases where I have reason to doubt this is always true - for example, a case where a death was registered in a district different to the district of residence (yet no death place noted in the NPC).  Therefore, my questions are:   Is it reasonable to assume in cases where no place of death is specified that the place of death was indeed the place of residence? What is the original source data for the information appearing in the National Probate Calendar? Would the death certificate always have been consulted?  "
760,Finding birth parents in Utah 1865,"One of my (very) great grandmothers is known as Mary Alzina Knapp Smith. She was adopted by Elias and Amy Jane Smith upon the death of her mother in childbirth. Elias wrote a letter (Or so I am assured, I don't have said letter) to Mary informing her that her birth parents names were James and Sarah Knapp. Here's what I know about Mary with documentation:  Pre-birth information:   Her adoptive parents were in Iowa in 1850, Salt Lake City in 1860.  The Utah 1856 census has an Elias Smith in Salt Lake City, although it's an index only record.  James Knapp doesn't appear in the Pioneer Overland records. Nor does Sarah or Mary Knapp. In fact, I can't find any record of a Knapp in Utah in any census I checked (1856, 1860, 1870).   Post-birth information   Mary's headstone gives her birthdate as 16 May 1865. Family Search Tree indicates she was born in Salt Lake City. Her death index says she was born in Utah. Mary's birthplace on census records show up as Utah, and in later ones, Idaho. July 6, 1865- Elias Smith wrote in his journal about having a girl live with him by the name of Mary Alzina, 6 weeks old. Her parents were known by the name of Knapp, headed to Montana to mine gold. (See entry below) I can't find a death record of Sarah, or anything, around Mary's birth. Mary shows up in the 1870 census under the household of Elias Smith, as Mary Smith. She shows up after younger children, and as born in Utah. I can't find a record for James Knapp in 1870. Specifically, I can find a number of records in the Eastern United States, but too many in the western states to know anything for sure. There are two in Montana that I'm studying still. The 1880 census includes a ""Mary A Smith"", which is consistent with everything I know, living in Utah (Location not specified closer than this). The order on the record is quite jumbled, with many children-in-law living there, but she is close to the end. I have a number of records beyond that, two marriage records (1884 and 1937), etc. At least one less reliable Utah Pioneer records database shows Mary as having crossed the plains to Utah, although I do not trust the source. Some census records indicate her parents were born in California. In fact, the state of birth of her parents varies dramatically. Her father is listed as Vermont (Adoptive), California, and Iowa, her mother is listed as Ohio (Adoptive), California, and Pennsylvania. (In order of chronological appearance) Mary died 20 Jan 1953 in Moreland, Idaho.   The best source that I have comes from the journal of her adopted family (Elias Smith, father), dated July 6, 1865:     Amy Jane brought with her from her father's an infant child about six weeks old, which had been abandoned by its mother or given by her to some person in this city, and subsequently taken by Amy Jane's mother, who wished to have it, and would still be glad to keep it, but her husband is not willing for her to do so. I have been told that the parents of the child were known while in the city by the name of Knapp, that the mother was quite young, that they were going to the gold mines in Montana Territory. How much truth there may be in the report I do not know. Amy Jane will keep the child, a girl, to whom Amy Jane's mother gave the name of Mary Alzina, till I have an opportunity of placing it with some persons who may wish to raise it that will be likely to treat it kindly and bring it up properly.   From family legend, I have the following quotes, each paragraph from a different person. Aside from this information, I have no evidence supporting any of the claims, but they still are of some interest.     It is true that she was only told that her parents were Knapp but her adopted father Elias Smith who was a judge wrote a letter stating the names of the birth parents. I am in possession of that letter. The story that she was told is in her autobiography of which I have a copy. It is certainly possible that these sources are incorrect but that's all we have at the moment. Elias Smith had extensive journals which I would like to go through at some point.      As far as I know she was only ""told"" that Knapp was her birth parents name. I have yet to find anything that actually states that. No records for Sara(h) or James Knapp at the place and time of her birth. My grandmother (Mary H. Johnson) looked for years.       Julie Caprice Olsen Nielson states: Her birth parents were James and Sarah Knapp. Sarah died in childbirth with Mary and her father felt he could not take care of her. Elias and Amy eventually adopted her.    I'm not quite sure where I should go from here to figure this out. I suppose she might have been cared for a period of time by someone else, and brought eventually to the Smith household. I see in the 1860 census they had a number of people with a variety of last names living with them, it seems like they might have often taken care of ""strays"". Any thoughts on where to go from here to find out information? In particular, I suspect the following might help:   Birth record of Mary Knapp, indicating her parents. Census record from either 1860 or 1870 for James Knapp. (Trying to find his birth record). Should be living in the West, beyond that, I don't know. Death (Or burial) record of a Sarah Knapp- Can't find one of child bearing years in the United States in 1865, but might have missed something. Record of Mary Alzina Knapp crossing the plains into Utah. Any similar sounding last names that are consistent with the story of James and Sarah having a child in Utah 1865, where Sarah died.  "

762,Verifying illegitimacy of 1911 German birth?,"In trying to trace my grandfather's immigration I have discovered that my grandmother (his wife) bears the same surname as her mother. She was born in 1911, but I can't find her birth record at the moment. She was Gertrud Schollhorn. I got the information from her death notice.  The death notice was the reporting of her estate. Filed at NAAIRS (I was there on Monday) it listed her mother Cresenzia Schöllhorn and father John Dill from San Francisco. I couldn't get a copy as it was a bound file. Photo indistinct. The estate was reported by my grandfather.  Is it safe to presume she was born out of wedlock? What was the protocol in 1911? "

765,UK census shows visiting family but no owners,"I'm researching the history of my house, so technically not genealogical, but it still involves sifting through censuses.  The first census (UK census) on which the property appears is from 1881. At this time there's some speculation that the house was still being built as it's un-numbered/un-named, and referred to simply as ""concrete house"".  The house is occupied by a family: a couple and their six children. The entry in the father's Relationship column is noted as being ""Head Visitor"", which would imply the family is visiting the house. However, no other entries for the house appear in the census - i.e. there's no entry for a family who might own the house. (And the house really isn't big enough for two families, or much more than a couple and their 6 children.)  Importantly, the father's occupation is listed as Master Builder.  I know from a record from 2 years later - from 1883 - the house has a name, and is occupied by more prestigious owners (a semi-aristocratic, high-ranking soldier and his family).  My question is this: Is it likely that the builder and his family in fact lived in the house full-time, rather than merely being ""visitors"", but only until the building was completed? If so, is this something that was common and would often show up on census records? And if so, what would be the protocol for the officials recording such census details? (i.e. Where is the line between tenant and visitor?) "
766,Tracing German ancestors in periods that are before church records?,"the oldest male ancestor in my family tree is called Johann Neumann and was working as a notary (since 1672, probably baptised 1626?) in Mittelhausen, Allstedt in Thuringia, Germany and Taucha closed to Leipzig, Saxony.  I did not find any entries in the church register about his parents nor other ways to get to know his parents' names. Older register have been destroyed during the Thirty Years' War, especially in that area.  Is there another possibility to overcome this gap? I was thinking the following:   Gene genealogy to find out from which part of Germany/Europe my ancestors exactly came. To find out the oldest appearance of the surname Neumann in that area and, once found, to trace back to Johann.   What do you think about this two ideas? Are they feasible and realistic?  Is there another way to try out first? "

768,"Would variety store in Albany, New York, USA (1862-1872) leave records and what would it sell?","As mentioned in Finding Naturalization Record for Hugh Sellars from Scotland who lived in Albany (New York State) 1855-1872? my 4th great grandfather Hugh Sellars and his second wife Mary had a variety store, initially at 287 and then mainly at 311 Washington Avenue, Albany, New York State, USA, from about 1862 until 1872 when Mary died and records for Hugh appear to cease.  Hugh's occupation in the 1855, 1860 and 1865 censuses is given as ship carpenter, then in 1870 it is ""variety store"", while Mary's is store keeper in 1860 and ""keeps house"" in 1870, so it looks like the business may have been originally run by Mary then Hugh became more involved later.  What would a variety store at that time and place have sold, and would such a business have needed any form of registration that might leave records that could be uncovered? "
769,Finding information about British slave owner Henry Stanley in Jamaica/England?,"In his will my 2nd great grandfather Henry Stanley Robert Pearce (1821-1868) leaves     all my estate and interest whatsoever in the lands and hereditaments   called Gale Mount and Dunsinane in the island of Jamaica   to his sister Henrica Stanley Leger Pearce (1819-1893).  I watched David Olugosa's ""Britain's Forgotten Slave Owners"" on BBC2 and followed the link to the UCL database of compensation claims where I found Robert Pearce (1793-1861; my 3rd great grandfather) making a claim in 1834 for compensation for Farm Hill, Jamaica as executor &amp; legatee of the will of Henry Stanley of Kennington. Farm Hill is not Gale Mount or Dunsinane but there is clearly a link here.   Henry Stanley's will mentions all the above 3 Pearces. He also names:   Elizabeth Mary Pearce, Robert's wife, as his niece; Henry Turpin of Jamaica, nephew.    Robert Pearce's will make no mention of estates in Jamaica so presumably he had already passed it on to son Henry Stanley Robert Pearce.  My problem is tying Elizabeth Mary Pearce nee Wilkins (1793-1842) to Henry Stanley. Henry Stanley clearly had some influence (financial?) on Robert &amp; Elizabeth as they name both their children after him.   I can find nothing about Henry Stanley other than his will &amp; burial in 1826 at St Mary, Newington, Surrey giving his age as 60 yrs. There are also death notices in various newspapers (e.g. The Gentleman's magazine, Volume 96, Part 1) saying Henry Stanley gentleman of Kennington.   Any suggestions what their connection could have been? Where do I look for more information aside from the ""usual ancestry subscription sites""? "
770,Explaining major discrepancies between Bishop's Transcripts and Parish Registers?,"Bishop's transcripts were copies of parish registers that were sent periodically to the diocesan bishop.  In the past I have noticed minor discrepancies between parish registers and bishop's transcripts, which are to be expected. However, in examining the parish registers and bishop's transcripts for the parish of Quinton, Gloucestershire, I noticed some major discrepancies.  For example, for the years 1781-82 shown below, the parish register is on the left, the bishop's transcript on the right:   Parish Register - 1781 burials  William Priest      Augt 13 Stephen Smith       Augt 15 William Heritage    Sepr 24 Richard Rogers      Sepr 27 Joseph Keely        Decr 1 Thomas Denes        Decr 22 Richard Best        Decr 24   Bishop's Transcript - 1781 burials  Thomas Dennis       Aug 12 Ann Rogers          Aug 22 Richard Best        Sep 12 Thos. Cooley        Sep 24 Mary Sadler         Oct 10 William Smith       Oct 23 Sarah Emms          Nov 20 Thomas &amp; Richard Emms Nov 23   There is nearly nothing consistent between the two copies, apart from the curious similarity in a few names - ""Thomas Denes"" and ""Thomas Dennis"", a ""Joseph Keely"" and ""Thos. Cooley"", a ""Richard Best"" on both lists, though the dates are completely different.  Note that for the year 1782 (also included on the image), the inconsistencies are not so bad, although there are a few entries missing. The bishop's transcript states ""The above is a true Transcript of the Register of the Parish of Quinton taken the 1st Day of July 1782.""  What is the best explanation for the descrepancies between these registers which ought to be identical copies?    Note: Both the PR and BT can viewed on Ancestry.co.uk. Due to the location of this parish near the Warwickshire border it so happens that the PRs are archived at Warwickshire Archives, thus appears under Warwickshire, England, Baptisms, Marriages, and Burials, 1535-1812, while the BTs are under Gloucestershire, England, Baptisms, Marriages and Burials, 1538-1813.

771,Birth record for a Jane Glasson in 18th century Cornwall?,"Jane Glasson married John Short in Whitstone Parish, North Cornwall, England, 6 Jan 1821. [website]Her headstone in Millwood, Knox County, Ohio, USA gives a year of birth as 1799.  They had a son, John, baptized in Jacobstow Parish, (also North Cornwall) 9 July 1826. [website]They had a daughter born in Cornwall, Anna/Anne, for whom I cannot find a birth record, but know of her existence through records in the USA (I'll save that for another question).  Jane's maiden name, Glasson, is supported by 2nd-hand evidence from the biography of her husband in America (page 664): [website]The Glasson surname is very common in south/west Cornwall, but unheard of in North/east Cornwall in the 19th century. There has been extensive research done on the Glasson families of Cornwall (see Penwith genealogy board: [website]Witnesses to the Banns of John Short and Jane Glasson's marriage in Whitstone were Henry PAYNTER and Anthony ARTHUR. The former was a farm owner in Whitstone Parish. PAYNTER was the witness to several marriages during the early 1800's, both family and seemingly non-family. I suspect that Anthony ARTHUR was a labourer on the farm, as his occupation is listed as such in the birth record of his daughter, Sarah Ann, born 4 Nov 1821 in Whitstone. He married Susanna WARREN at Whitstone, 29 March 1821.    There does seem to be a connection between the ARTHUR family and GLASSON family in Crowan. Anthony ARTHUR was born to Anthony and Ann (WARREN) in 1797 (married at Crowan in 1793) there. There was a large GLASSON family in Crowan at that time. Could it be that Jane GLASSON is a cousin of Anthony ARTHUR or Susanna WARREN?   The closest birth record that I have for Jane(or Jenifer, a common nickname) (searched 1770-1810) ([website]daughter of John and Constance (1793) married William Edge at Stoke Damerel, Devon, 12th May 1812 Jennifer daughter of Thomas and Elizabeth was buried at Madron 19th June 1799   So out of this information, I have three questions: 1) What was Jane Glasson doing up in Whitstone in 1821, apparently so far from 'home'? and 2) What is the likelihood that her baptism record is missing or she was never baptized? and 3) if Jane was not originally from North Cornwall, would the banns witnesses be even more likely to have been people she knew from home, or strangers?

I have an ancestor who served with the 3rd or King's Own Regiment of Dragoons in the 1790s on detachment in Scotland but then goes on to serve in the North York Militia circa 1798 onwards, who were also quartered in Scotland. He married there and lived out the rest of his life in Scotland.   My best guess is he had reached the age of 40, been discharged from the army and joined the local militia for the next 5 years so he could stay in Scotland and be with the woman he went onto marry perhaps? Or maybe he transferred out of the army early and saw out his service in the Militia? I have no idea if this would ever have been allowed. Would love to hear anyone else's more plausible theories.   My sources are as follows:    His 1798 marriage certificate from Dunbar, Scotland, states he is a soldier in the North York Militia.  He was involved in a private criminal case whilst a soldier in the Third or King's Own Regiment of Dragoons on detachment in Kirkudbright. This lasted from 1791-93.  NEW INFO: Today, I discovered he was admitted to the Royal Hospital Chelsea in 1792 and discharged back to his regiment (3rd Dragoons) the same year. This fits in nicely with the time of the court case.    So I now have his age - 23, and know that in 1792 he had 6 years service under his belt. I also know his place of birth and occupation!   My question now is:  If he was eventually discharged from the army due to his injuries, these not being severe enough to prevent him serving in the Militia, would he still have had to serve 18 years in total? "
773,Correlating military and civil records for one or two individuals,"This question is, although a little late, inspired by the Weekly Topic Challenge on ""correlating military service records with other sources"". It's also part of an effort to re-examine some of the ""obvious"" assignments in my tree, and check that I haven't jumped to unjustified conclusions. I am seeking to compare two sets of records - civil and military - for ""Matthew Stretch"", with the aim of determining whether or not they refer to the same man.  I can trace a lineage back with (I think) high confidence to William Stretch, who worked as an undertaker by St Giles Cripplegate, London, in the mid 19th century. I'm fairly confident in going back to William's parents, but it involves correlation of multiple sources.   William was born around 1795 in Bethnal Green, according to his census records. There are a few candidates for his baptism record, but only one that matches well for name, year and location:      08 [Oct 1794]   William Son of Matthew &amp; Elizabeth Strech (Painter). Born 11 Sep.   (St Matthew, Bethnal Green)   There's also a plausible baptism of William, son of Thomas and Ann, at St Sepulchre, London. But William named his second son Matthew, and a daughter Elizabeth (although that was also his wife's name), and named no children Thomas or Ann. (William named his first son Demetrius, presumably after this gentleman).  There is only one likely marriage record that I can find for Matthew and Elizabeth:        The marriage of Matthew Stratch, bachelor, and Elizabeth Flight, Spinster, both ""of this Parish"", at All Hallows London Wall on 24 Sep 1788. Matthew marked, Elizabeth signed.     There are no other obviously relevant ""Stratch"" records, so I do think this is a variant of, or typo for, ""Stretch"" (or perhaps Matthew's accent was unclear). The full name of William's aforementioned daughter was Elizabeth Flight Stretch - that middle name correlates nicely with this record (and has no other obvious explanation).  Matthew and Elizabeth seem to have had nine children, most of whom were baptised at St Matthew, Bethnal Green. I'm fairly confident about most of these - there is some nice interplay between family members witnessing each other's marriages, for example.  Matthew and Elizabeth Stretch appear to have died in 1836 and 1835 respectively:    These surely identify a married couple: the pair had the same address (Wilmots Grove, Bethnal Green) and were buried with the same ""Situation"" (plot location) in Globe Fields Burial Ground, Bethnal Green. Most interestingly, the undertaker's name in each case is ""Mr Stretch"". Having looked through the Globe Fields records on Ancestry, I can find only four instances where ""Mr Stretch"" was involved, and all of those interred also had the surname Stretch: Matthew, Elizabeth, and two children who were William's nephews. This suggests that Mr Stretch ""guested"" at Globe Fields solely to inter family members. So the two records above surely show William Stretch the undertaker, burying his own parents Matthew and Elizabeth.  This burial is one of only a few records I can attribute cleanly to Matthew Stretch. His age, 77 in 1836, suggests a birth around 1759, but there aren't too many other records for a man of that name being born at that time. There's Matthew Stritch, an Irishman who appears to have lived about 1761-1839 and died in Walworth, London. A Math Stretch was born in Norwich in 1758, but was buried there the following year. So Matthew's origins are not yet known.  There is, though, a Chelsea Pension record (PDF) for Matthew Stretch, a private discharged from the Royal East London Militia on 15 Mar 1805. It states that Matthew, 46, was born (~1759) in the parish of St Michael, Norwich, and was a painter by trade. He was discharged in London ""having nearly lost his sight, and rendered incapable of military duty from a debilitated constitution"", poor chap. Matthew did not sign the papers, leaving a mark instead.  This looks really interesting - name, age and civilian occupation all look compatible, and it includes a birthplace. So the actual question is quite simple: can I use these records to correlate this ""Soldier Matthew"" to the ""Family Matthew"" who married Elizabeth Flight? "
774,How to research German WWII prisoners of war in British captivity?,"At the end of World War II, many German military units tried to avoid Soviet captivity by turning west and surrendering to western allied forces.   While a simple request to the German Red Cross (Suchdienst) will often result in detailed information on Soviet captivity, tracing POW of the British forces can be cumbersome.  While the National Archives provides an overview on Prisoners of war in British hands, they have only limited resources for world war II and refer to other institutions like “local archives” and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).   The Red Cross has suspended it’s world war II research for conservation purposes. Can I assume that they have substantial resources on German POW in British captivity? How do I move on without the ICRC, when I have no details on the suspected British captivity?  "
775,Finding birth/baptism record for James Chichester who died 1858 in British Guiana?,"James Chichester was my great-great grandfather.  James Chichester was a native of Europe and an inhabitant of the County of East Demerara, British Guiana. James lived in Mahaecony, East Coast Demerara. (These details are written in his will.)   James died November 23, 1858, in Georgetown, British Guiana, and is listed on the British Guiana Colonists Index ""C""   James was one of two brothers who migrated from Europe. It is believed his brother’s name was Edward Chichester.    James fathered eight children with Betsy Anne Joe, namely Charles James; Henry; Thomas; Agnis Giles (nee Chichester); Henry Edward; William; James; and John.   George S. Chichester signed as witness to the will of James' son Charles James Chichester.  How could I try to find his birth and/or baptism record(s)?  I do not have any ship records for him travelling to/from British Guiana.  I have located the listing of the probated will of James Chichester from both Guyana records and the England &amp; Wales National Probate Calendar.  His brother Edward was listed as executor and swore oath to the authentication. I am enclosing a copy of the UK listing.    From the England and Wales, National Probate Calendar Index of Wills and Administration 1858-1966 I obtiained the second listing of James Chichester's Will.  Here is a copy:   "
776,"When have people started keeping Birth, Marriage, and Death records","I know that in more recent times almost every birth, death and marriage was documented and extensive information was often recorded, but when did this become common?  For relatively recent genealogy, 1850+, there are often really good records online, but as you get into the 1700s the records become harder to find. Does anyone know when the government or churches really started officially recording births, marriages, and deaths? At what date am I usually going to be looking for something that is not existent?  I am working primarily in Harford County Maryland if that helps. "
777,Who are the parents of George Juden?,"I've spent a lot of time working on this brick wall and I was hoping for a fresh pair of eyes, heres what I have:  George Juden is my 3rd Great Grandfather, He married Elizabeth Salvage and had five children. His life before this is scattered with conflicting facts and sources which has lead to massive discrepancies between trees on various genealogy websites.   He was born on 25th June 1843 in Upper Beeding, Sussex, England. His birth certificate lists his parents as John Juden, a labourer and Mary Riddick. George was Baptised along with his two siblings, Caroline and Walter on 22 November 1843, the baptism lists them all as being ‘Baseborn’ meaning they were born out of wedlock with the father and are Illegitimate. The only parent listed is Mary. Previous to these baptisms there appears six other Juden births to a John and Mary: William in 1831, Jane in 1833, Ann in 1835, Alfred in 1837, Sarah in 1838 and Mary in 1838. Of these William, Jane and Ann died under the age of five. Another three Baptism records are recorded in 1841 for a Henry Juden, 1845 for a Frederick Juden and 1851 for a Harriet Juden all to Mary Juden and again  all listed as being ‘Baseborn’. Harriet and Henry died in infancy. John and Richard Juden were both baptised in 1804 and 1803 respectively in Upper Beeding to James Juden and Honor Roberts. James and Honor also had: Mary Ann born around 1800, Hannah born around 1801, Eleanor born around 1805, Harriet born around 1807, Caroline born around 1809 and Thomas born around 1812. The 1841 and 1851 Census records list the head of the household as Richard Juden, rather than John Juden, the supposed father. Both of these Census records list Mary’s birthplace as Thorpe, Surrey. There is a Marriage record for a John Juding and a Mary Riddick in Thorpe, Surrey on 15th January 1825. (There are no Juden/Juding/Judin families living in surrey let alone Thorpe so it is very likely to be them). Richard Juden died of Acute Hepatitis in 1851 and was buried 9th April 1851, just ten days after the census was taken. His daughter Harriett was buried four days after that aged 6 months.   This leads me to a few possible conclusions:   Richard Juden in the census results might actually be John Juden but using his brothers name, what happened to his brother would be a mystery so far… John Juden might have died somehow and it either hasn’t been recorded which would be extremely rare or the record has been lost/miss-indexed, or I simply can’t find it, and his brother stepped up to raise his children (and have more with his wife) which wasn’t too uncommon of the time. This seems the most likely. Richard could have died early in his life and consequently John might use John or Richard as his first name. The weird thing is George Juden was born in 1843 yet Richard is the head of the household in 1841. So either John wasn’t living with his wife and his brother was, but they were still intimate or Richard is the real father(or again they are the same person so it doesn’t matter) Very very unlikely but, John and Richard could be the same person although I don’t know how there would be two baptism records.   This 1840 Death Record for John Juden is not the correct one as the certificate lists his age at death as 76. This is at least 30 years older than the John Juden I’m looking for. (This is the same death in a different collection with the birth date on)  This could be a possible record as his father was called James and he died four years before.  Another possible death however I’m not sure why he would have been in Hackney, London.  At the moment I cannot find a death that makes sense for John Juden. This would theoretically need to be between 1837 and 1841 based on the baptism records of his children.  My question is, Who are the parents of George Juden?  Chronological order of information as requested by @PolyGeo  John Juden + Parents + Siblings   27 August 1799 - Marriage - James Juden &amp; Honor Roberts 17 August 1800 - Baptism - Mary Ann Juden daughter of James &amp; Honor 19 July 1801 - Baptism - Hannah Juden daughter of James &amp; Honor 24 April 1803 - Baptism - Richard Juden son of James &amp; Honor 15 January 1804 - Baptism - John Juden son of James &amp; Honor 26 November 1805 - Baptism - Eleanor Juden daughter of James &amp; Honor 22 December 1805 - Burial - Eleanor Juden 29 March 1807 - Baptism - Harriet Juden daughter of James &amp; Honor 3 January 1809 - Baptism - Caroline Juden daughter of James &amp; Honor 7 January 1812 - Baptism - Thomas Juden son of James &amp; Honor 20 January 1812 - Burial - Honor Roberts/Juden 23 January 1812 - Burial - Thomas Juden   George Judens Immediate Family    15 January 1825 - Marriage - John Juding &amp; Mary Riddick 13 September 1831 - Baptism - William Juden son of John &amp; Mary 18 September 1831 -  Burial - William Juden  14 October 1832 - Baptism - Richard Juden son of John &amp; Mary 7 December 1833 - Baptism - Jane Juden daughter of John &amp; Mary 25 January 1835 - Burial - Jane Juden 26 April 1835 - Burial - Ann Juden 25 June 1837 - Baptism - Alfred Juden son of John &amp; Mary Q4 1837 - Birth - Sarah Juden Q4 1837 - Birth - Mary Juden Q1 1838 - Death - Ann Juden 16 September 1838 - Baptism - Sarah Juden daughter of John &amp; Mary 16 September 1838 - Baptism - Mary Juden daughter of John &amp; Mary 1841 Census - Richard Juden(45), Mary Juden(30), Richard Juden(9), Alfred Juden(3), Mary Juden(3), Sarah Juden(3), Walter juden(1), Caroline Juden(1).  13 May 1842 - Baptism - Henry Juden son of (Fathers name 'Not Given') &amp; Mary 22 May 1842 - Burial - Henry Juden  25 June 1843 - Birth - George Juden (Time recorded 11am possible twin?) son of John Juden &amp; Mary Riddick 22 October 1843 - Baptism - Caroline Juden daughter of Mary (Baseborn) 22 October 1843 - Baptism - Walter Juden son of Mary (Baseborn) 22 October 1843 - Baptism - George Juden son of Mary (Baseborn) Q4 1845 - Birth - Frederick Juden 25 December 1845 - Baptism - Frederick Juden son of (Fathers name 'Not Given') &amp; Mary 4 November 1849 - Baptism - Elizabeth Juden daughter of (Fathers name 'Not Given') &amp; Mary 5 January 1851 - Baptism - Harriet Juden daughter of (Fathers name 'Not Given') &amp; Mary (Baseborn) 1851 Census - Rich Juden(52), Mary(48 Born in Thorpe, Surrey), Rich(19), Alfred(16), Mary(14), Caroline(11), Walter(11), George(7), Fred(5), Eliz(3), Harriet(6 Months). 5 April 1851 - Death - Richard Juden 9 April 1851 - Burial - Richard Juden 1861 Census - Mary Juden(54 Born in Thorpe, Surrey), Walter Juden(21), Frederick Juden(15), Lucy(Actually Louise) Holder(24 Walters Wife).    Any help is massively appreciated, however big or small.  Edit/Update 1:  I bought Henry, Elizabeth, Harriet and Frederick Juden‘s birth Certificates seen below:   Henry Juden Birth Certificate   Elizabeth Juden Birth Certificate   Harriet Juden Birth Certificate   Frederick Juden Birth Certificate  Every one of the children’s birth certificates say that John Juden is the father.  I’ve also looked at transcripts from the Upper Beeding Parish Registers(On CD transcribed by www.sfhg.org.uk from originals)  and made a timeline of the children’s marriages:   13/06/1857 – Sarah Juden married Charles Town. In Upper Beeding parish records Richard is listed as BF(Brides Father). 28/10/1860 – Richard Juden married Bengemina Muzzell. In St Andrews Hove parish records John is listed as GF(Grooms Father). 25/12/1860 – Caroline Juden married John Boyde. In Upper beeding parish records Richard is listed as BF. (Walter Juden(Carolines Brother witness) 25/12/1860 – Mary Juden married Charles Hobbs. In Upper beeding paris records Richard is listed as BF 1861 – Walter Juden married Louisa Holder. In Upper beeding parish recrds Richard is listed as GF. (Caroline Boyde(Walters sister) + John Boyde(her husband) witnesses) 25/05/1862 – George Juden married Eliza Salvage. No father listed. 25/12/1866 – Frederick Juden married Ann Emily Laycock. In St Andrews Hove parish records James is listed as GF(Grooms Father). Q2 1882 – Elizabeth Juden married Thomas Brackley.   The children seem to have different opinions as to whom their father is compared to their birth certificates. At this point in time I  believe that the children’s parents are as follows:  John Juden &amp; Mary Riddick:   William Richard Jane Ann Sarah Alfred Mary   Richard Juden &amp; Mary Riddick:   Walter Caroline Henry George Frederick Elizabeth Harriet   Edit/Update 2:  After getting in touch with Steyning Museum one of the researchers there said she knew of a lady that did research on every family that lived in Upper Beeding since 1550 and that when she died, her massive collection of notes was given to an archive that she has a contact at.   After a few emails she sent me 5 pages of notes on the Juden family. Most of it I already have (Baptisms, Marriages and Burials) but one part caught my eye and is the biggest breakthrough in this brick wall... Below are the pages... On page 4 it mentions a Vestry record entry which states: ""Resolved that if Mrs John Juden encourages Richard Juden to come to her house, her pay is to be taken off, which is 3|= per week"".   So it seems there was a bit of a love triangle between Mary and the two Juden brothers! I've ordered a death certificate from 1859 for a John Juden which I'm hoping will be his now that it's a lot more likely that he left the home rather than died, I'll update when I get it.

778,What kind of a place name or institution is 'Mansfield Statutes'?,"In transcribing an 1825 Settlement Examination from Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, the following line appears to read: William Brough ""then hired at Mansfield Statutes to Mr. Milward of Epperstone for a year which he served.""  An online search for ""Mansfield Statutes"" produced several 'hits' for Nottingham newspapers via British Newspaper Archive at Genes Reunited, but I don't have a membership.

785,"Separating families with identical parents' names in the same parish in Norfolk, England from 1730-1760?","There are two individuals, both named William Lark, both married a woman named Mary. I'm quite convinced they are two different families, although they are probably related. They both had several children, christened in Cantley, Buckenham, Norfolk, England, between 1730-1758. There seems to be a natural divide between the two families, but marriage records aren't consistent. I definitely have two marriages between William Larks and women named Mary, one in 1730 (Wright) and another in 1750 (Smith), both in Cantley, Buckenham, Norfolk, England. The dates I have for the christianing of various children are (All in Cantley):   Mary- 1731 William 1734 Sarah- 1740 Anne- 1742 John- 1743 Benjamin- 1751 Samuel 1754 John 1754 (12 days different than Samuel by index, seems to be the same on page 10 of record found at FamilySearch) Samuel 1758   Burials in Cantley also include   John- 1744 (Definitely the 1743 John) William Lark- 1775 William Lark- 1807   All of these records are index only. Normally I would try to look up the original records, and see what I could find from them that might be different, but with index only records...   I have a few theories at this point:   William/ Mary Wright had all of the kids born between 1730-1743. William (Son) married Mary Smith, who then had the last 3 kids born. All of the kids belong to William/ Mary Wright. There might have been a third couple, responsible for some of the kids.   The first one sounds the most plausible to me, but I would really like to get a bit more solid evidence before I consider this closed. Any idea how to continue? "
786,Do we have more female than male ancestors?,"I have read a claim in several sources, including a New York Times article by John Tierney, that we have more female ancestors than male ancestors.      ""Citing recent DNA research, Dr. Baumeister explained that today’s human population is descended from twice as many women as men. Maybe 80 percent of women reproduced, whereas only 40 percent of men did.""   While this may seem unintuitive, it is possible due to pedigree collapse and a lower rate of male repoductive success. A lower rate of male repoductive success (i.e. males were less likely to survive to reproductive maturity) in combination with pedigree collapse may mean that our total number of female ancestors can exceed the total number of male ancestors.  Is this true for a person with predominantly European ancestry? I would particularly like to see genetic or demographic evidence that supports or refutes this idea. If true, it would also be useful to quantify the ratio of male to female ancestors at a given generation level - in other words, roughly how significant is this effect on a genealogical timescale? "
787,Country other than Switzerland where place of origin is not same as place of birth?,"In Switzerland we have a system where the place of origin is not the place of birth - the place of origin is transmitted from father to son just like the surnames are, and is strongly linked with the surname.  I was under the impression that Switzerland was unique in this respect, but I have an ancestor from Austria-Hungary which also has a place of origin which is different from the place of birth : His place of origin is Götzis and his place of birth is Lustenau.  Is there a country other than Switzerland where there is (or used to be) this system where the place of Origin is transmitted from father to son along with the family name ? Was it the case in Austria-Hungary ? Is it still the case in modern Austria ? "

I could do it one at a time on Ancestry.com but there are around 300, so that is very slow.  Instead, I'd like to edit en mass.  I tried editing the 2017 format .ftm file on my Mac that syncs with ancestry.com, but it is not text format, so the surname does not appear as plain text in it.  If I export to GEDCOM and edit the GEDCOM, can I import it back into the same tree and not end up with two copies of people (incorrect and correct spelling)?  If I export to GEDCOM and make a new tree, would I risk losing any information? "
790,How to narrow down the best DNA donors in a large family?,"I've been doing genealogy for quite a while, but am new to DNA, having purchased six tests for Christmas. Not all results are in yet, but I have a few good matches. I'd like to get four more kits in the next year, but my wife and I have lots of relatives, and I'm not sure who to test next.  I've created a chart to show the DNA resources (living relatives) available to us.    My wife (3a) and I (2a) tested at AncestryDNA, and have twelve living aunts and uncles, ages 75 to 90. They all have living cousins, although their numbers are dwindling.   My mother (5a) and my wife's father (6a) are also at Ancestry, and my wife's mother (7a) is at FamilyTreeDNA, because we didn't think she could do the spit test. I have one FamilyTreeDNA kit left over. My cousin (5c1) tested herself at 23andMe, but I have no presence there, yet.  The experts are preaching to test everyone, everywhere, with every test. I'd rather be more frugal, and am only doing autosomal tests for now. I'd like the option to do mtDNA and Y-DNA in the future.  I can add two more generations to the chart before hitting any trouble areas, mainly:  Ancestor 9 (paternal line),  Ancestor 10 (all lines, but have DNA leads on maternal line),  Ancestor 11 (maternal line),  Ancestor 12 (paternal line),  Ancestor 14 (maternal line),  Ancestor 15 (all lines)  My goals:  Confirm paper genealogy.  Find 3rd/4th cousins to trade stories/photos.  Find distant cousins to break through brick walls.  Map Chromosomes and traits of individual ancestors.  Preserve DNA data for future generations.  My questions:   I've considered testing myself at all three big companies (Ancestry, FamilyTree, 23andMe). Is it better, worse, or the same if I test myself (2a) at Ancestry, my sister (2b) at 23andMe, and my brother (2c) at FamilyTree?  Would aunts and uncles be better than siblings in question 1? I'd like to recreate a partial DNA profile for my deceased father (4a) using my siblings. Is there a benefit in that to our (hopefully) ongoing genetic genealogy, or am I being sentimental? He has three living brothers. Experts say to test your oldest relatives first. The thought being that eventually you'll test everyone, and maybe I will. But being old doesn't make you best choice. If you could test only four people on the chart for atDNA, who would it be, where would they test, and why?  Who would be runner-up in fifth place?   UPDATE: I've come a long way in the last 6 months. Here is my family's latest denagram, showing who's been DNA tested. Thanks for all the help!    "
791,Identifying era of Family Bible posted on Facebook?,"I was contacted about a family bible for an ancestor of my wife and which has been posted on FaceBook with some photos, including these two:     From the posted pictures, is there enough information to gauge how old the printing is?

793,Establishing a link between birth and marriage records in an 18th German church register,"I have been browsing a Lutheran church book for the town of Wetter, Marburg-Biedenkopf, Hesse in Germany that details 18th century birth and marriage records, and am trying to establish a link between a known Anna Maria Henckel and her parents and grandparents.  We start here:    I think this is pretty clear. On the 11th November 1774, Johannes Marth, son of Daniel Marth, and Annia Maria Henckel, young daughter of Johann Jost Henckel, were married (in Wetter).  Now, there was only one Anna Maria Henckel with a baptismal record (23 April 1754) in the church book for this town in the previous 40 or so years, and the father's name matches, so I conclude this must be the right person.    Here I have my first problem. The leftmost column is for parents (usually just the father), the middle for the name of the baptised child, and the rightmost for the godparents/sponsors. The father is clearly Johann Jost Henckel, but I can't make out what the word(s) below his name, although I would guess it starts with ""von"", and indicates either the town in which he was born or lived at the time. The column for godparents (patrini in Latin) is pretty clear, and translates as: Anna Maria, Wilhelm Schmitt's daughter from Kirchhain (a nearby town).  For the same date, in another book of baptisms for this town, I have the following record. (Don't ask me why baptismal records are duplicated between these books.)    This is not the clearest, even for Gothic handwriting, but here's my attempt at a transcription, with some abbreviations expanded to the best of my knowledge.     Montag d (der) 23 April T (Tag) ist Joh. Jost Schmidt ein(e) Tochter getauft hat gehaben das Kind als/alt Mutter Johannes ???els Frau ih?? ????????? v. (von) Kirchhain Joh. Wilhelm Schmitts Tochter und ist das Kind Anna Maria genannt(?).   Since I don't really know German, and am missing a few possibly key words, this is proving difficult. The date of baptism matches precisely, but I'm not even sure it is a record for the same child, despite both records mentioning a ""Wilhelm Schmitt"" and ""Kirchhain"", albeit in different places, seemingly. But then I'd wonder why one baptism for that day was present in one book, and the other in the other book, but not both in either book (whereas for most baptisms it seems a record is usually present in both books.)  Now, here is a possible marriage record for Johann Jost Henckel and his wife, Anna Maria's parents, dating to 22 Jan 1751.    This is not so easy to read either. Here's my attempt:     Der 22 Jan. Joh. Jost Henckel von Oberrosphe(?) i: Anna Cath. (Catharina) Mic. (Michael) Schmidts/Schmerzens/Schneiders f. (filia)   My reading of the town name as ""Oberrosphe"" is very unsure, but I know this is a name of a nearby town. A big problem is that this town name doesn't seem to agree with the one in the above image (birth record for Anna Maria). Likewise, the name of Anna Catharina's father is quite tentative. I've made three surname suggestions based on other individuals I've seen in the records (and expecting them to be in genitive case).  So, can anyone help me with deciphering / translating / generally making sense of the above? I'm really not sure if I've established the right connection here, or am going up a blind alley. Thanks in advance. "

795,Why would my Full sibling results 99.7% be so close to my half sibling DNA result 99.6% with my sister,"I recently had sibling DNA testing done with what I thought was my half sister.  Our full sibling results were 99.7%. And our half sibling results were 99.6%. I called Genex the company that did the testing and they said the higher number was correct.  Because I questioned this, they explained the numbers were close because of the amount of DNA that her and I both shared from our mother and father. We are positive that we have the same mother.   My concern is that my sister and I have double cousins, my mothers sister was married to my father‘s brother.   With me and my sister half sibling result being at 99.6% I was curious as to if my uncle could actually be my father causing me and my sisters full sibling results to be that high?    Our parents are have both passed away. However our father’s brother is still alive.   Would further DNA testing help or would we be able to tell by the results that we have already? "

Alexander had other marriages and children all called Irvine, but what I found has David Laird, son of Margaret Anderson and Alexander Irvine 11th Laird of Drum.   This is what I got from another persons tree. I’m interested in David Laird. I don’t have any other info and there was no way to contact the original creator of this tree.

797,Determining shared maternal or paternal lineage via shared DNA segments?,"If DNA cousins and I share the exact same segment of DNA, does it always mean we're related via the same side of the family?   Background: I have taken DNA tests with National Geographic, Ancestry, and 23&amp;me. I really like the more complete, detailed information 23 provides. So, in an attempt to more fully understand my DNA and figure out shared lineage with cousins (whether I'm related to them via my father or mother's side, and perhaps even trace to which exact great or greats), I started a spreadsheet. On it, I have rows for each DNA strand (1-22, plus x) and columns for segments starting from the lowest numeral (1) to the highest, dividing them up in between according to clusters of shared DNA numbers I share with various cousins. Under each strand, I have a row for each cousin. The result is that I have found multiple cousins who line up in the same column because they share the same exact segment length (e.g., 1-5,679,900) for a particular strand. If I am able to connect with one of those cousins and figure out exactly how we're related (usually by using Ancestry trees), I conclude that I'm related via the same ancestor(s) to everyone else who shares those specific segments.   Then it occurred to me that my thinking might be completely off, since I'm so confused about DNA. Because half of each segment comes from the maternal side and half from the paternal side (I think), then my spreadsheet is worthless. Or is it? Please advise.  "

801,Explaining DNA mystery of unexpected 1st cousin?,"I wanted someone to confirm my thoughts or give me some guidance.   I have uncovered a possible 1st cousin mystery dna match. (ancestry)( I know all my first cousins and no one has done a dna test.)   I had my Dad do a Dna test (Ancestry), his results suggest  great grandparent/aunt/ uncle / half sibling. I share 683 centimorgans 38 segments, and my Dad shares 1340 centimorgans and 50 segments with the mystery person.   What makes this interesting is this person shares dna with us from both maternal and paternal sides.(my Dad's father/mother). I know this because I am aware of confirmed relationships.    I take from this that it's possible that:   one of my aunts gave up a child.(unknown to us) .  I do know that my grandfather's sister gave a child up probably in the 1920's.BUT the only way it could be this mystery person is if the father was somehow a relative of my grandmother. like her brother  Right? (it could happen) .This scenario would make them double cousins and would inflate the shared dna by double?     Am I right to assume these are the only ways we can share both paternal and maternal dna in those amounts? "
802,Software/tool to generate 'trial' family trees?,"During my research, I often want to 'rough out' simple multi-generation family trees (based on birth/bap/mar/death/bur) to explore, for example, how a bunch of entries in the parish registers on a single parish over a 150-year period (1700 - 1850 say), might fit together; or more simply, how all the individuals shown in a census household might fit together (and thus trigger me to look for supporting data for an hypothesis).  I could generate the trees by hand, but these aren't easy to rearrange as new data comes in, or when I want to try different configurations. I could use my main genealogy software, but that would be overkill and doesn't support easily trying out new 'shapes' of the tree. (Plus I prefer not to enter data there until I have a very high degree of confidence in it.)  Microsoft Visio (Organisation charts) seems like a hammer to crack a nut. Scapple might be another alternative. I have access to both of those.  However, I'd like to explore more targeted charting alternatives (preferably free). Google throws up a plethora of 'solutions', as does GenSoftReviews but I'd value recommendations from the community here.  Minimum requirements:   Add individuals with tentative (editable) bap/mar/bur dates, with links to parents spouses and descendants. Drag and drop individuals or branches of the tree to alternative positions under other branches Visual representation Handle trees showing descendants of multiple starting points (until hopefully I can join the various branches together)   Desirable but not essential:   Warning when date ranges don't make sense (e.g. child bap when mother aged 60)   Does anyone have experience of some software/tool that they'd recommend for this purpose? Or would recommend (with reasoning) staying with the paper-based approach? I'm most used to working with drop-line charts in this way. "
803,How should I cite a microfiche source at The (UK) National Archives?,"In my research, I have consulted the ""Women's Land Army: Index to Service Records of the Second World War"" held on microfiche at The (UK) National Archives (MAF421), as described here.  Consulting Shown Mills' Evidence Explained there are 2 possible 'models' I could use as the basis for constructing the citation:    Fiched manuscript (Preservation Copy)       Many manuscript materials are microfilmed or microfiched for preservation purposes only. They are not sold to the public and are not considered publications. Copies typically exist only at the library or archives that created the film.    National Government Records (Image copies)   The guidance from Shown Mills in this case is less clear cut, as it is predominantly about microfilmed copies of US Records held by US National Archives and National Archives and Records Administration; however, it ought to be possible to extrapolate to the UK situation. The recommended approach seem to be to cite the microfiche as if it were a publication (but quite frankly, this section of the book is as clear as mud to me, hence the question).  Which model should I choose as the basis for my citation?  Quotations are from Evidence Explained, 2007. "
804,Who are the individuals silhouetted in this image?,"(Note: I have more questions about this image than answers, so anything you see in it that is of note to you, please call it out!)  Johan Bauer and his wife Anna Hagen had three children, a son and two daughters. The silhouettes depict two men and a woman, and the dates around the silhouette perimeters don't seem to match with any information given elsewhere in the image. If not the family (based on the information in the image) then to whom might the silhouettes belong?    (full size here.)  Other questions related to this image:   What is this thing? A pre-photography family photo? Is this a common object in German/European/American families in the mid-1800s, or is this unique? If the above is a common pre-photography heirloom, does it help identify when it was created? ""Catharine Elisabeth Wilhelmine Bauer"" is known as ""Minna Bauer"" in every record in which she is found (and similar for other family members). On Ancestry.com how would I document her actual name v. the name she is most commonly known by (v., apparently, the name they are given at baptism)?  "
805,Status of Ted Wildy's UK Marriage Witness Index?,"In the 1990's, Ted Wildy of New Zealand created an index of marriage witnesses, which had contributions of the names of the witnesses of many marriages in the UK (as well as Australia and New Zealand).    After his death in 1997, much of it was lost.  Early fragments of it exist, and a UK site said they were going to put a later version online in 2009, but I don't think anything came of that.  So, this is a two part question.  Does the final Ted Wildy UK marriage witness index exist online in any form?  It was a lot of data for the time, a tiny amount for now, but it would still be nice to see it live on.  Secondly, and more importantly, is anybody doing anything similar now with the much larger amount of data currently available?  For example, parish records for selected counties in England are now on Ancestry and FindMyPast. There could be a project to transcribe the marriage witnesses.  Does any such project exist?  Any other index based on perhaps FreeReg, or from GRO certificates?  Marriage witnesses can be very useful to help identify the bride or the groom, as they are often connected to them in some way, such as being a brother or sister, or come from the same small village.  With an index, it's possible to find more ""known associates"" of a named person as they become a witness for relatives or workmates, and build a more complete picture of their life. "
806,Reliability of houseofnames.com: searching for possible Mayflower descendant,"My grandfather has told me for years that us members of the Briscoe family are directly related to a doctor that came to this country aboard the Mayflower.  He said that in his attic somewhere are personal effects that belonged to him including correspondence, books and a diary but he always had an excuse for not rummaging it up.  For the longest time I thought these were just stories that he told to me when I was a kid, but I am pushing 30 and he is a lot older now, and he recently brought it up again.  It makes me wonder if maybe there is some truth to this.  I did a Google search and the first hit actually mentioned the possibility that such a person existed.     First found in Cumberland, England, in the parish of Newbiggan, where from time immemorial the Briscoes were Lords of the manor of Birkskeugh. Some of the first settlers of this family name or some of its variants were: Dr. John Briscoe who settled in Maryland. He set sail from Newbiggin, Cumberland, and settled in America in 1632; soon after the Mayflower   Source: [website]My first question is if the information on this site is reliable?  I understand that there were probably a thousand original Briscoe families and that just one of those were Scottish Lords, but it might not be coincidence that the information about a Dr. Briscoe being an original settler is strangely similar to stories he shared with me.  It is also possible that he did a very unthorough genealogy search decades ago and fabricated fantastical stories.  My second question is, other than badgering my grandfather to dig up artifacts of questionable existence, what is a more reliable way to easily find out more information about this Dr. Briscoe? "
807,How do I read this descendants tree?,"I have, using Ancestry.co.uk found a link in my distant heritage to the Prettyjohn (variations: Prettejohn, Petitjohn) family originally located in Devon.   One great source of information on this family, leading all the way back to the 16th Century, is this website:     My only problem is I can't understand the way that the tree is formatted at all.  Is this a fairly standard form of documentation?   I have tried to contact the website owner via the email link on the page, but have heard nothing back in over a month. Can anyone decipher it and explain it to me (bearing in mind I am still fairly new to family history)? "
808,What is needed in a Name?,"I wanted to find a way of raising this question within the limited strictures of SE so please bear with me on the explanation.  When we think of personal names, we immediately think of given-names and surnames, often using the more informal and less-correct terms forename and last-name. In almost all places where names are stored - in genealogy and in other areas such as government databases - there is an attempt to formalise names and categorise their elements. Hence, the parochial Western knowledge of worldwide names often gets enshrined in data storage and it can adversely affect people from other cultures.  So, for Western type names, we obviously need to account for possible multiple middle names. Then we find there may be academic titles (e.g. Dr. or Prof.), honorific prefixes (e.g. the honourable, or his holiness), honorific titles (e.g. Sir, Lord, Dame, Lady), or post-nominal letters (e.g. VC, OBE, PhD), generational titles (e.g. .Jr, Sr, I, II, III, etc).  As we move out of the English-speaking world, we find cultures with multiple surnames. The surname category itself has to include patronymic or matronymic names which are a different type of inherited name element. In Far Eastern cultures, there is a generational-name concept that we don't have in the West. There is also a general class of name element called a 'name particle', analogous to a grammatical particle. This includes all those small joining words such as: “von”, “van”, “der”, “de [la]”, “d′”, “the”, “[son] of”, “mc”, “mac"", ""Ó"", ""Ní"", ""Nic"", ""Mhic"", ""Bean"", ""Ui"", ""y"", etc.  Even if the storage supports extended-Latin or non-Latin alphabets, we find different rules for capitalisation (sometimes it is not the first letter of an element, and sometimes it is more than one letter), and sorting (e.g. sorting on the first, last, or other name element).  The Native American cultures effectively have unstructured names that defy all attempts at formalisation, so this is a problem even within the US. A name like Running Deer has no surname concept. If our representation of names is to include pseudonyms, stage names, and other alternatives - any of which could be a simple mononym - then we have to abandon any formalisation.   In my opinion, we're chasing a non-existent formalisation, and all such approaches are doomed. So, my question boils down to: What are the essential properties of a name that we need to record and to distinguish, over and above a simple sequence of name elements? If a product (or data format) supports alternative names for a person, each of which is a simple sequence of elements, then do we really need to know about surnames any other element types?  You might be prepared to answer about inheritance of names and helping the end-user. Well, even ignoring the unstructured Native American example, above, we find multiple rules for inheritance. Some cultures have matrilineal inheritance as opposed to patrilineal. In the Irish culture (and others) the surname is not simply tacked on and there are different rules for men and women of different generations.  It seems for every rule, there will always be valid cases that don't fit. "
809,Facilitators for Adoption,"I have just tried to help with a question elsewhere on adoption and it has fuelled me with a fresh question. Someone wanted to find a connection between a family who ""adopted"" an illegitimate child, and the family of the birth mother.  Unfortunately, I could find no connection. I had a similar situation in my own family and could find no connection there either, e.g. geographical, by marriage, or occupational.  Since adoption was not formalised until about 1926, I had concluded that a third-party was probably involved. My SE question is therefore: were there people who facilitated these arrangements back in 19th century England, e.g. for money? If there were then are there any documentary references? "
810,Immigration from Norway: seeking information about 1871 passage from Quebec to the US,"This question is similar to Rob Hoare's ""Sources for Border Crossings between Toronto and Chicago in early 1890's?"" but the circumstances are different. My question concerns immigration 20 years earlier from Norway via Quebec, and I have different and possibly conflicting information about how the travel from Quebec to the US may have happened.   My ancestors, call them Nels (1845-1931) and Lovise (1839-1913), emigrated from Norway in April 1871 aboard the Atalanta, departing Stavenger.    Shortly before her death, Emma (Vig) Froiland (1885-1978), Nels and Lovise's youngest child, relayed the story of her parents' immigration saying they ""went through [immigration] procedures at New York [and then] came to Milwaukee [Wisconsin] Depot."" The last leg of their journey was across the state of Wisconsin. Emma commented, ""their introduction to the land of milk and honey was a ride in the back of a manure wagon to a one room cabin in the woods."" :-) [Note 1] The website Norway-Heritage has considerable information about this particular voyage, ""Ship Atalanta, J. A. Køhler &amp; Co."" The site reports that in 1871, the ship ""departed from Stavanger on Apr. 25th, and arrived at Quebec on June 23th … [having earlier] arrived to the quarantine station at Grosse Île on June 19th, five were sick with smallpox. She was held in quarantine for four days before she was released and proceeded to Quebec. [Ship was] mastered by Capt. B.A. Reinertsen ..."" The ""Ship Atalanta"" web page provides the tradition of another 1871 passenger, Ole Larson Lee [Storeli] (destined for Leland, La Salle County, Illinois). Lee's report indicates the Atalanta arrived Quebec as planned, ""but Capt. Reinertson sent our train away, trying to persuade us to go by steamship to Chicago, several of the passengers were persuaded, but I and my folks were not, and demanded that he should arrange for us to get another train, which he did. We got a ""Box car"" which had been used for cattle, and in this way we traveled to Detroit, Mich. where our luggage had been sent and was cleared by customs. … When this was over we were brought to an immigration house where we had a delicious meal …  our first … in the United States. [Then] we were taken to the railway, and because they were out of box-cars we were given an old worn-out passenger car."" This passenger reportedly arrived Leland, Illinois on 3 July 1871. [Note 2]   As above, I have an array of information about Nels and Lovise' immigration. I have separate passenger lists for Atalanta that contain their names (Stavenger departure and Quebec arrival). It's reasonable to me that the last leg of their journey may have been in the back of a manure wagon. It's the doughnut hole that I'm trying to sort out--how did they get to that wagon from  Quebec.    Did the Atalanta travel from Quebec to New York? (Seems doubtful to me, in part because it is not mentioned in the description about the 1871 voyage nor in Ole Larsen Lee's story.)  Whether persuaded by the captain or as originally planned, did they take a steamship to Chicago?  Did they take a train to Detroit, as Lee Larsen's party opted to do? Are there 1870s era records from this Detroit immigration house or customs office?    There may be other scenarios.

811,Dating this photograph of a younger Emma (Vig) Froiland,"Emma (Vig) Froiland (1885-1978) was the youngest child born to Nels and Lovise Vig. This is the same Emma (Vig) Froiland who, shortly before her death, relayed family tradition about Nels and Lovise' immigration. See the Genealogy.SE question, ""Immigrating from Norway ...""   Emma married at her home in Avalanche, Wisconsin to Carl M. Froiland in 1906. [Wisconsin Marriages (index) and Emma (Vig) Froiland interview (1977)]. Carl and Emma had three children, born 1907, 1914 and 1922; Carl died in 1927. Emma died at Viroqua, Wisconsin.   My memories of Emma are from the 1960s and 1970s, when she was 80-90 years of age. I remember an Emma fluent in Norwegian and always active; conservative and quite strict.   I later learned that Emma wrote both music and poetry. I have some of her poetry and recently found her name listed in the 1939 Catalog of Copyright Entries: Musical Compositions for a song, ""Then I knew I loved you.""    Though I remember Emma later in her life, I found the picture of a young Emma, below, in a collection of family photographs. I have scanned and shared the photograph with others but have never been able to estimate the date the photograph was taken.     the photograph had already been removed from its backing or enclosure, so I also don't have the benefit of knowing the studio or photographer name (which might help estimate the date)  the paper is heavy, but not stiff  there is no border around the photo, nor is the edge raised or embossed   Other than the difference in size, no alterations were made to the graphic reproduction. I'm hoping the experts here might be able to help date the photograph.   P.S. May we all live to be 93 and leave such a great photo behind.    "
812,What kind of source is a Birth/Marriage/Death certificate?,"I ask this question because all genealogy software or website seems to always ask for citations in/and/or sources. This is great when you find a book or a movie or data in a newspaper. It's easy to identify what is the citation and what is the source. But what kind of source is a Birth/Marriage/Death certificate.  According to the help of my softwares or website I should create a source for each document. So i have 1000 person in my tree. So 1000 birth, probably 500 death and 250 marriage certificates. I won't create 1750 different sources and so 1750 citations.   I decided to create One unique source : civil state or something like civil documents or civil certificates or simply certificates. Is this correct ? What do you suggest ? "

814,Deciphering three words from mid 19th Century Cornwall Marriage Certificate?,"The image below has been clipped from the Marriage Certificate of my 3rd great grandparents Mary Symons and John Billin.  That marriage took place on 5 Feb 1839 in the Chapel of Helston in the Parish of Wendron in the County of Cornwall.    It is all quite easy to read, except for three words (which are in round brackets).  I apologise for the quality of this image but unfortunately it is the best I have to work with, and the certificate has only just been obtained from the General Records Office.  The full sentence to which the words belong is below the image.  The words visible in the image are bolded, and those handwritten are italicised.       Married in the Chapel of Helston according to the Rites and   Ceremonies of the Established Church (????????   ????????   ???????)   by me, J.W.Johns Curate   Does anyone have any thoughts on what the three words in brackets might be?  From the christening records of Mary's younger siblings (those born after 1820) it appears that the Symons denomination was Methodist. I am only now starting to examine how and when my ancestors changed their religions, and wondering whether the words I am unable to read may offer another clue. "
815,What is the correct way to cite a book review?,"How do I cite a book review article which has the same title as the book?  I want to quote the journalist, Jeffrey D. Carlisle, who wrote an article titled ""Chevato: The Story of the Apache Warrior Who Captured Herman Lehmann"" for Chronicles of Oklahoma, published by the Oklahoma Historical Society in January 2008.   The article is a review of the book Chevato: The Story of the Apache Warrior Who Captured Herman Lehmann written in 2007 by William Chebahtah and ‎Nancy McGown Minor.   The quote I want was made by the reviewer, and does not appear in the book. Do I list the authors of the reviewed book? Do I mention that the article is a book review? Are either of these acceptable?      1 - Jeffrey D. Carlisle (2008, January).

816,Finding Devon parish marriage records?,"My husband's family came to the US from England; some of the family stayed in the US, and some returned to the UK.  I have many records from my husband's grandfather's generation that indicate his great-grandparents were Arthur Knowles and Fanny Cole from Slapton in South Devon.  (Most of the records associate the family with Slapton -- one curious discrepancy is that for their two sons, their WWI Draft Registration cards say their birthplace is Slapton, but the WWII Cards say they were born in Plymouth.)  This marriage registration (first found on FreeBMD) is the most likely candidate I've found for a marriage so far:     Marriages Mar 1885   (>99%)          Cole Fanny      Stoke D.    5b 538      Knowles Arthur      Stoke D.    5b 538       Palmer John         Stoke D.    5b 538      Worden Grace        Stoke D.    5b 538      Stoke D. is the Stoke Damerel Registration district.    Here is the same entry on FamilySearch -- note the catalog entry for their database says ""Index courtesy of Findmypast.com.""  This was unexpected -- if Arthur and Fanny had married in Slapton, the marriage would have been registered in the Kingsbridge Registration District. Many of their children were baptised in Slapton, and one of their sons who died in Massachusetts is listed in the Slapton Burial register. Most of the children's births are registered in the Kingsbridge Registration District.  Some years ago, another researcher was kind enough to look in the Devon Record Office but was unable to find a record for a marriage between Arthur and Fanny.  Since FindMyPast recently put a group of Devon Parish Records online, I thought I would try again.  Here are the coverage charts for the Devon Parish Records and the Plymouth Marriage Register.  I was hoping I could find parish records about their marriage online, instead of just assuming ""this is about the right time and the names are right, so these must be the right people!"" and ordering a GRO certificate sight unseen. (Plus as AdrianB38 reminded me, the parish register would have their signatures, which I could compare to the 1911 Census.)    FindMyPast has the banns and parish records for Arthur's second marriage in 1907 (Fanny's death is registered in 4Q 1905) but not for his first marriage.    Why can't we find the parish record for this marriage?  If it is not available online, might there be a record offline, and if so, who might hold it?  The Devon County council's website has a page explaining the Coverage of Devon parish registers online.  That page has two lists, one of parishes whose registers have not been digitised because the incumbents did not give permission, and one of parishes that are not on Find My Past because they have not been digitised yet.    They also advise checking the Parish Register List for information about gaps in coverage.   For Stoke Damerel, the chart says ""STOKE DAMEREL see PLYMOUTH (Devonport)"" and the page of parishes that begin with the letter P  obligingly lists a group of parishes that are part of PLYMOUTH (Devenport).  Marriages for Stoke Damerel are listed for a date range of 1595-1987.  Family Search has some marriages from Stoke Damerel itself online, but the most recent batch listed on Archer Software's list of IGI batches is:     M052421   Marriages   1808-1884   21905   Single     which would not include records from 1Q 1885.  I haven't checked the entire parish list from the PLYMOUTH (Devonport) region against the IGI batches yet, but the fact that I haven't found the record on FamilySearch suggests that a similar situation may exist for other parishes (the batches run out before 1885).  I also need to check the parishes listed in this region against the list of parishes that have not been digitised yet.  Another possibility is that the marriage was recorded in Non-Conformist records since in the 1871 Census, Arthur's father was listed as a boot and shoe maker, with ""Methodist Preacher"" written on the line below; in 1891, Arthur's brother Thomas Henry is listed as ""Thatcher and Local Preacher"".  However the Devon County Council's guide gives a date range for marriage registers ""from 1898"" and that does seem to be the case for most of the listings in their table, though there is one entry that might have coverage from the right date range:     PLYMOUTH: St Georges Terrace Methodist Church, Devonport Marriages   1865-1988 P.2157/13-15   A direct search of the Plymouth Marriage Register on Find My Past for men named Arthur yields 115 results, none of which are a match (there are some records with no surname).  Searching the Devon Marriages for Arthur with no surname yields 7,196 results, all of which have surnames.  (Name variants were checked/ticked for all searches.)  What other information besides the banns could I find, if I have all the information from the GRO certificate?  Presumably a marriage took place or the GRO wouldn't have a registration for it.      Arthur's records:   1911 Census: Arthur (age 48) born Slapton, Devon [census place sometimes mistranscribed as 'Hapton' but the image says Slapton] (with second wife and younger daughters born in USA, youngest daughter born in Slapton) 1901: Arthur is in the US; 1900 US Census (age 37) born 'England' 1891 Census: Arthur (age 27) born ""England Devon"" (with Fanny and children; all others in household are ""Slapton Devon"") 1881 Census: Arthur (age 18) born Slapton, Devon (servant at Prospect House) The rest of Arthur's family in the 1881 Census, in Slapton Village  1871 Census: Arthur A (age 8) born Devon, Slapton birth registration Arthur Albert Knowles 1Q 1863 in Kingsbridge Reg District baptism on 15 Jan 1863 at Slapton, St James the Greater, for an Arthur Albert Knowles, the son of Thomas and Sarah Anne.  Father's occupation is shoemaker; name and occupation are consistent with the 1871 Census.     Arthur's other records show Arthur E. Knowles (his daughter's passport application) and Arthur Ernest Knowles (2nd marriage, and several of the children's baptism records); the likely death registration lists ""Arthur E F A Knowles"" (Totnes 4Q 1918) which is consistent with the date of death given in his daughter's passport application. If this is indeed the right person, the F may stand for Frederick since that name has appeared in the family several times (e.g. Arthur's son, my husband's great-uncle Fred).  Fanny's records:   death registration 4Q 1905 (same quarter as birth of youngest daughter) in Kingsbridge Reg District 1901 in Massachusetts; 1900 US Federal Census says born 'England' 1891: Fanny (age 25) born ""Slapton Devon"" 1881: Fanny (age 18) working as servant at Farlane, born ""Slapton Devon"" [note age doesn't match up with the other records] 1871: my best candidate family is Fanny (age 6) born ""Slapton Devon"" in the household of Nicholas Cole (labourer) and his wife Harriet, enumerated in Brixham (BOOHAY COTTAGE).   baptism 06 Nov 1864 at Slapton, St James the Greater, for a Fanny, daughter of Nicholas (labourer) and Harriet birth registration 4Q 1864 in Kingsbridge Reg District There is an 1881 Census record for a Nicholus and Harriet Cole in Brixham at Boohay cottage that is consistent with the 1871 Census record (Nicholas born Slapton, Harriet born Somerset).    (P.S. my husband reminds me that it's possible that Arthur and Fanny never got married at all, in which case the Stoke Damerel registration might be for another couple altogether.  I think I did do some cursory searches to find historical records that had a John Palmer associated with a wife Grace, but my earlier notes were lost.  No obvious records with an Arthur married to Grace and a John married to Fanny jumped out at me at that time, or for other couples named Arthur and Fanny.)    Update: thanks to Peter Christian's The Genealogist's Internet I found the Guild of One-Name Studies' Marriage Locator, a project which will allow you to plug in the GRO index and get the parish out.    The front page bears the following disclaimer:     This is still a work in progress, and not all the data needed for all   marriages is yet available. New data is continually being added.   I got the following result:     Marriage Locator Search Results      GRO Index: 1885 quarter 1, volume 5b, page 538:      Sorry, we cannot locate the church for this marriage. The entry is   located between entries for Stoke Damerel RO (RD: Stoke Damerel) and   Crediton (RD: Crediton).   Marriage Locator - the principles discusses the problem of coverage for the locator:     Because this project started with a particular focus towards the East   End of London, the records held are richest for the RDs of Stepney,   Mile End, St George in the East, Whitechapel, and Shoreditch for the   years 1837 to 1911. Although our volunteers have contributed data from   other areas and other years, coverage elsewhere can be still patchy   ... but is increasing - we currently have approaching half a million   (over 465,000) entries!   So if your research happens to be in the area covered by the volunteers, it seems as if the locator could be a useful cross-check.    I should also note that during a recent search, for one GRO registration I checked FreeBMD itself, Ancestry's database of FreeBMD results, and FamilySearch.org's version of FreeBMD's results, and got three different answers!  Looking at FreeBMD itself, I was able to look at the image, and I agree with the FreeBMD transcribers. I had heard about problems with Ancestry's database, but this was the first time I had found a problem myself.    Another useful tool: The GENUKI Church Database, which allows one to enter a town name and find the churches within a given distance.    Since the links embedded in the message don't always stand out, I've added this section of Quick links to Resources:   Church Marriage Finder at The Surname Society (thanks to Colin for this link) Marriage Locator at the Guild of One-Name Studies FreeBMD DustyDocs English Parish Registers Online UKBMD GENUKI [website]Topographical Dictionaries at British History Online REGISTRATION DISTRICTS IN ENGLAND AND WALES (GENUKI)     UPDATE:  I have now received the GRO certificate, which confirmed that Arthur and Fanny were married in the Register Office by certificate before the Registrar in Stoke Damerel.

817,Average number of ancestors,"Every individual has two parents, four grand-parents and so on. This would yield an astronomical number of ancestors even after a small number of generations, e.g. 235 &sim; 34 billions. The solution to this paradox is called pedigree collapse which takes into account that some of the ancestors in the binary Ahnentafel are identical, i.e. one and the same subject. This leads to a decrease of the number of ancestors of a given generation.     Are there any empirical statistics about the average number of ancestors of   generation -1, -2, -3, etc. in a given population.   The average number of parents is exactly 2, the average number of grand-parents is slightly less than 4, and so on.  Which mathematical model might yield sensible numbers? Does anyone know a reference? "
818,Wife's surname used as second name to indicate Smyth child named after someone from her Osment family?,"My 5th great grandparents Sarah Osment and John Smyth married on 13 Jul 1764 at Stoke Damerel, Devon.  The ten children I have for them, who appear to have all been christened in or near London, appear to have been named:   John Osment (1766 – 1767),  Sarah Osment (1768 – 1831),  Elizabeth (1771 – 1809),  William (1773 – 1817),  Robert Osment (1774 – 1836),  Mary (1778 – 1799),  Thomas (1780 – ?),  James Osment (1783 – 1803),  Rebecca Osment (1785 – 1829) and  Jemima Osment (1787 – 1817)   I have always found it curious that some had their mother's surname as their second name while others did not, but I had put it down to the sketchy records, and more or less assumed that they all did have it (just that it was not always recorded).  John wrote his Will on 27 Aug 1804 and I have just seen a transcription of it.  All of the children alive at the time were mentioned and are named with or without the Osment second name as per the above list so it really does seem like some had it and others did not.  I have a theory for which it is hard to find evidence yet, because I do not know the previous generation for either Sarah Osment or John Smyth.  My theory is that the Osment second name was given when the child was named after someone from the Osment family.  I think Sarah Osment may have come from Devon (around Plymouth) but have less clues as to whether John Smyth did too.  My understanding is that their burials at Bunhill Fields suggest strongly that they were Dissenters.  Has anybody come across examples where this naming pattern of ...     ""wife's surname used as second name to indicate child named after   someone from her family""   ... has been used?  I recently used Find My Past to discover that Sarah Osment was baptised on 27 Jan 1743 at Plymouth Charles, Devon with parents Robert Osment and Elizabeth.  Her only siblings appear to have been: John (1738), Robert (1742) and Rebecca (1745).  It looks like four of the six children given the Osment name can be accounted for by the naming convention I originally suggested.  However, I have not yet located a Jemima or a James.  As an aside, the eldest daughter of Sarah Osment and John Smyth, Sarah Osment Smyth married John Stacy (my 4th great grandparents).  All eleven of their children were given her maiden name Smyth as their middle name. "
819,Italian Government-Paid Passage,"Why would the Italian government pay for passage of Italians to the US?  What were the contours of this policy and does it reveal meaningful information about the recipients?  In the manifest for a ship from Naples to Ellis Island in 1920, a number of the Italian passengers received passage paid by the government.  On the manifest line under ""By whom was passage paid?"" it says ""Ital. gover."" with ditto marks all down the page for an entire page of passengers.      I know that Australia had a policy of paying for immigration and that the US promise of free land probably encouraged immigration.  Why was Italy paying for emigration?  I could infer that maybe they felt over-population or unemployment were problems and perhaps they wanted to encourage nationals to go abroad to earn money.  Perhaps the recipients had to qualify for the passage by military or other service. "
820,What records might be created in England when people are re-interred?,"There are two people in my database that seem to have two records about their burials -- one in Massachusetts, and one in Devon.  I haven't found any other information that would indicate these are records about different people with the same name. Is it possible that they were re-interred, and if so, where might I go to find more information about their burial in England?  Cecil E. Elliott, son of Charles Elliott and Augusta Knowles   Death Certificate from Massachusetts, Deaths, 1841-1915 on FamilySearch (image).  Reference ID: 403 , GS Film number: 2313119 , Digital Folder Number: 4283142 , Image Number: 01674   According to the Massachusetts Death Certificate, Cecil died on 14 Feb 1909 at the age of 30 years 6 months and 12 days.  Burial was 17 February 1909 in Forestdale Cemetery in Holyoke, Massachusetts.  The informant is Charles Elliott (his father).  The name of the undertaker might be ""Mills Lathrop"". I have an article about his death from one of the local papers, which says that Cecil was a member of Grace Congregational Church, but it does not say what funeral home was in charge.   Devon Burials, Archive reference 3040A/PR/1/17, Burials in Slapton, St James the Greater, Year 1911, page 32, Entry No. 254, by H.G. Warner, the local vicar:     According to this, Cecil was 29 years old.  The abode says Slapton (crossed out) followed by Holyoke, Hampden, Mass; the burial date is 22 Mar 1911.  Charles Edwin Knowles, son of Arthur Knowles and Fanny Cole   Death Registration (city register) image from Massachusetts, Deaths, 1841-1915 on FamilySearch, Reference ID: v 529 p 100 , GS Film number: 2057736 , Digital Folder Number: 4289821 , Image Number: 823    According to this source, Charles died on 12 Jan 1902 at the age of 8 years 7 months and 8 days. Burial in Forestdale Cemetery in Holyoke, Massachusetts (no date given).  I have not located any newspaper accounts for this death, and the register doesn't say, so I don't know what funeral home was in charge of the burial.   Devon Burials, Archive reference 3040A/PR/1/17, Burials in Slapton, St James the Greater, Year 1902, page 24, Entry No. 187, by H.G. Warner, the local vicar:      According to this, Charles was 8 years old.  The abode says Forestdale followed by Holyoke, Mass; the burial date is 04 May 1902. (There is a problem in that the entry reads ""Charles L. Knowles, but the L is in a much fainter line than the rest of the entry.)  When I first saw these records, I assumed that the deceased were entered into the parish records in Slapton because their families had returned to England, and they wanted a record of their children's resting place in the parish records.  But I had forgotten that the English registers are not death records, as they are in Massachusetts, but burial records.  Would a vicar enter a burial if no burial took place?  How would I find out if these two people were actually taken to England and re-interred there?  If the bodies were accompanied, what are the chances I could find someone in the UK Incoming passenger lists?  Would any other records survive in England?  Note that in the USA, there might be two places to find information about a burial -- the funeral home which took care of the burial, and the association in charge of the cemetery.    I plan to hire a professional to search the records at Forestdale Cemetery for me, but I haven't yet done so. Presumably if someone were interred there and then disinterred, there would have been a record made of that, but who knows if any records survived.   I have no idea how common it was in this time period to send someone's body home when they died overseas, or what the expense might be, so any insight is welcome.    Additional records and background:   Devon Baptisms in the parish of Slapton, St James the Greater: an entry on 01 Oct 1893 for Charles Edwin Knowles, son of Arthur Ernest and Fanny a birth registration for Cecil Edward Elliott in 3Q 1879 in Totnes Reg District (England census records indicate he was born in Dartmouth; those parish records are not yet online).  a death record for Cecil's sister Lillian d. 04 Apr 1894.  Note that the register header says ""Residence, and Place of Death, and Burial (if elsewhere)"" -- presumably she is buried in Holyoke but no cemetery is listed. I have not found a burial record for her in Slapton.  a notice of Cecil's death published on Monday, February 15, 1909 in The Republican (Springfield, MA), issue 279, page 8; he is identified as the son of Mr. and Mrs. Charles Elliott.   an account of Cecil's funeral published on Thursday, February 18, 1909 in The Republican (Springfield, MA), issue 282 page 10; it says that burial was in Forestdale Cemetery.  These and other articles in the Republican identify Cecil as a member of Grace Congregational church -- another possible source of records about his life, if not his burial.   prior searches of the British Newspaper Archives gave information about Augusta Elliott's probate, but I did not find articles mentioning either Cecil Elliott or Charles Knowles.   Cecil and Charles are cousins -- Augusta Knowles is Arthur's older sister (assuming all my identifications are correct).    Note this answer to the question Reading comment in 1825 baptism register? What statutes are in effect in this period? "
821,Renaming record-image.jpg files and other files with generic download names,"I'm struggling with the problem of how to name digital images that I download from FamilySearch.org.    When the ""Save As"" dialog box pops up in Windows, there is usually a filename populating the dialog box. If the provider offers a distinct filename, my usual practice is to keep that filename and note it in my records.  Unless the website includes in the filename the date it was downloaded, this allows me to check whether or not I have downloaded it before -- when moving it from my 'new downloads' folder to its place in my permanent storage area, W8 will tell me I already have a copy of the file.    But FamilySearch downloads all Save As ""record-image.jpg"" unless you tell Windows otherwise. The same problem exists when printing PDFs from images on FamilySearch (care is needed or the image gets cropped). The 'Save As' dialog auto-fills with 'untitled.PDF'.  My current practice is to rename the file using some version of the number following the 'pal' (Persistent Archive Link) in the link I took to the image, removing any characters not allowed in a filename (e.g. [website]However, I don't like this solution because when FamilySearch changes how they name everything again, the filename will be meaningless.  See the related question Persistent URLs (web addresses) for online records of genealogical events, especially AdrianB38's answer  -- the issues discussed there are why I want to move away from using the PAL numbers.  Another option might be to use some form of the digital file number in the references given for each search result:      Reference ID: v 445 p 693 , GS Film number: 961512 , Digital Folder   Number: 4225007 , Image Number: 607   Two articles I found which discuss the GS Film number, and how to retrieve items when no online image is available, are  Understanding the source information behind Historical Records results and How to find an image in the FamilySearch Catalog using the film number found in Historical Records.    To solve the 'where did these files come from' problem I place them into a folder labelled with the name of the website until I can work through the batch and rename them.  But a long session on FamilySearch.org might result in a folder with dozens of files that are all called 'record-image' with the later files having the number appended by Windows when it downloads duplicates.   What system do you use?  What are the advantages and disadvantages?  Do you work in batches, or do you find it more efficient to rename each file as it is downloaded?    The image-processing program IrfanView allows the user to add a comment to an image.  (Other programs probably do as well, but IrfanView is the one I use most).  FamilySearch has a ""copy citation"" feature in its viewer, so I plan to copy the citations and attach them to the images with IrfanView's comment feature. This will preserve the citation as it appeared on the day I downloaded or re-visited the image until I can create a multimedia record in Family Historian.    Edited May 2015 to add: it seems that FamilySearch has changed the way they serve images when downloaded -- files now seem to have a reference number in the name.  One of my recent downloads was named      record-image_TH-266-11072-200079-11.jpg   I haven't decoded the reference number yet, but if the name is the same every time it is accessed, this will solve my generic image filename problem.  I'll have to re-access the older images to capture the new filenames as I review my data. "
822,Historical records of money transfers for emigration (Remittance) from England?,"A Wikipedia article defines Remittance as:      A remittance is a transfer of money by a foreign worker to an   individual in his or her home country.   In a city directory from New England dated 1876, an advertisement for Doyle &amp; Finn lists them as Emigration and Exchange Agents for the White Star and Anchor Lines.  The ad reads ""Drafts Payable in Any Part of England, Ireland, and Scotland"".  Some passenger lists offer clues as to whether tickets were bought by the passengers themselves, by remittance, or by another agency such as a government (see related question Italian Government-Paid Passage). For examples of a draft (and a staggering amount of other information about and ephemera from the steamship companies) see The Gjenvick-Gjønvik Archives.  Agencies were often associated with a particular steamship company -- for an example see this list from the GG Archives of names and addresses for the offices and agents of the The Scandinavian-American Line.  The State Library of Queensland has a portal immigration and shipping: getting started and a research guide for immigrants to Australia.  The guide says:     Under what migrant schemes did people arrive? Immigrants travelled    under different schemes. Assisted passengers received a government   subsidy and paid a small charge or were free. Remittance or   Nominated passages were arranged by a friend or relative living in   Australia, who paid a warrant for their passage to the Government.   Indentured immigrants were brought out as contract labourers for employers who paid the Government for their passage.  Unassisted   immigrants paid full fare. More information exists for assisted   passengers but the amount varies according to time period and the   colony or State. Check guides for each State for further information.   I am looking for research guides similar to this one and other pointers to primary sources for assisted and remittance passengers traveling from England to the United States in the late 19th and early 20th century.  What other records might hold clues to transit, apart from the ships' own passenger lists?  Do business records survive for these emigration agencies? If so, who holds these records?    For another breakdown of categories for passengers to Australia and New Zealand, see: Lloyd's Register Foundation Information Centre, Infosheet No. 38 Immigration and Emigration.  This guide contains a table of Libraries, museums and other research institutions holdings records relating to immigration and emigration. including a link to the Guildhall Library Manuscripts Section for Livery Company Documents.  Also of interest (for context):  Report on European Immigration to the United States of America by the United States. Immigration commission, 1891-1892 (published by the  U.S. Government Printing Office, 1893) is available via Google Books. (Discovered through a search for 'assisted passengers'.)  US incoming passenger lists ask the question Who paid passage? on these forms:   22-question list [1893-1906]: Q13 29-question list [1907-1918]: Q15 33-question list [1919-1925]: Q16 36-question list [1925-    ]: Q16   The dates in the list above came from the website of the Capital Area Genealogy Society in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, from their page of downloadable passenger list extract forms.  (Note: pre-1898 passenger lists for the port of New York were stored at Ellis Island and were lost in a fire in June of 1897.  Earlier lists commonly offered for the Port of New York are US Customs House records, which have much less information about the passengers.) "
823,When did printed register books come into use in England and Wales?,"In Evidence Explained on page 35-36, Elizabeth Shown Mills talks about the analysis of public records, e.g. events which are recorded in register books.  She gives an an example a church register book which appears to be an original, but might be an administrative copy.  One of the clues might be that the book is all in the same penmanship where we might expect a variation in handwriting.  Another is that records from an earlier date may have been copied into a form book that was not available at the time the events took place.     Are the entries recorded in a form-type book for a period in which   such books were not the rule?  Preprinted registers discreetly carry   printing dates that may reveal their creation long after the original   events occurred.   How much is known about the form books for parish registers that are used for recording baptisms, births, and deaths in England and Wales?  When did they come into widespread use?  Is there evidence on the pages themselves that might provide clues about when the book itself was printed?  Are there different styles, and if so, how many exist?    (I have image copies of parish register pages from Devon, but I did not scroll back to the beginning of the books while I had access to the collection on Find My Past.) "
824,Is there a resource for easily determining relationships between two relatives?,"In the English language, there are many words for relationships between two relatives. For instance, my father's brother is my ""uncle"", the daughter of my father's brother is my ""first cousin"", the wife of my father's brother is my ""cousin-in-law"" and so on.  I remember once seeing an online resource that would allow you to plug in the two relatives and spit out their relationship. It even included all of those completely confusing ""blah blah  twice removed"" relationships. I have no idea where that link is any more and I've been looking for one such link ever since.  Does anyone know of a resource for easily determining relationships between two relatives in the way I have described?  These previous questions have elements of what I'm looking for, but not completely:  With generations of multiple marriages and step children, how is this family relationship described?  How do I determine a relationship with a cousin? "
825,Citing online image copies with inadequate information or provenance,"In a recent blog post, Elizabeth Shown Mills asked the question Do You ""Just Trust"" Citations Offered by Digital Providers?     EE hopes your answer is no. Today’s image demonstrates why. Not only   do we need to double-check the factual details, but we also need to   consider whether the “ready-made citation” actually covers all   essentials.   Find My Past recently added the Index to New England Naturalization Petitions, 1791-1906, NARA publication M1299.  Unlike Ancestry and FamilySearch, which supply a ready-made citation which can be cut-and-pasted into one's software, Find My Past merely offers a rudimentary transcription which cites the title of the collection and the microfilm number (which spans several rolls), and nothing else.    The display of the image itself says ""New England Naturalizations, 1791-1906 Image"" with no indication of what roll it comes from, or where it might be on the virtual microfilm roll (no ""n of how-many-images"").  They do not offer navigation through the entire virtual roll, so it isn't possible to scroll backwards to see whatever information might be on the cards at the start of the roll.  Unlike the England and Wales Census images where the RG numbers are visible in the image itself, there is nothing showing in the frame.  The only clues are in the name of the image when downloaded, which might be completely arbitrary.  I could save the URL as a rudimentary record as to the path I took to get there, but that could change at any time.    Here's an example of the transcription available from Find My Past:        First name(s)  Fred   Last name  Abelein   Birth year     1860   Birth country  Germany   State  Massachusetts   NARA publication   Index to New England Naturalization Petitions, 1791-1906   NARA publication number    M1299   Record set     New England Naturalizations, 1791-1906   Category   Immigration &amp; Travel   Record collection  Naturalizations   Collections from   United States &amp; Canada      Contrast the information one gets from FamilySearch.org:        Name:  Fred Abelein   Event Type:    Naturalization   Event Place: Massachusetts    Birth Year:    1860   Birthplace:    Germany         Affiliate Publication Title: Index to New England Naturalization   Petitions, 1791-1906 , Affiliate Publication Number: M1299 , Affiliate   Film Number: 47 , GS Film number: 1429717 , Digital Folder Number:    4639023 , Image Number: 00366       Citing this Record    ""New England Petitions for Naturalization Index,   1791-1906,"" index and  images, FamilySearch   ([website]  2014), Fred Abelein, ; citing Massachusetts, NARA  microfilm   publication M1299, roll 47, National Archives and Records  Service,   Washington D.C.; FHL microfilm 1429717.   In the grand scheme of things, this specific example is not really important.  The Index is merely a finding aid to other records, and if I wanted to record where I found the lead to Fred's naturalization record, I could simply discard the Find My Past discovery in favor of the one from FamilySearch.   I don't anticipate finding any records on FMP that I haven't already seen on Ancestry or FamilySearch.  It isn't always easy to tell if they are all using the same index and images provided by NARA. (How to find out that information should probably be a separate question, but on FamilySearch and Ancestry.com, the images show three cards; Find My Past returns the single image for that search result but nothing else, so I don't know if those few cards with images of the reverse can be accessed on FMP -- there is no name on the reverse that could be searched for.)  But what if this were an actual historical record, not simply a finding aid, and (for whatever reason), I could only find it on Find My Past, or Brightsolid's image copy was superior to all the other vendors? How are users supposed to cite the image copy when the vendor gives practically no information about where the image can be located within the virtual microfilm roll or within the collection, or where their image copies come from?     For those not familiar with this collection, here are some links:   A document describing Publication M1299 is available for download at Archives.gov.  (This supplies the Roll numbers which Find My Past didn't bother to put in their abstract.) United States New England Naturalization Index, 1791-1906 on Find-a-Record   See also: Prologue Magazine: A Gold Mine of Naturalization Records in New England for more information about the records for which these cards are an index.  This image, like others, is particularly annoying because there is a note at the bottom of the card that says (over).  There was more information on the other side of the index card.  As far as I can see, the opposite sides of these cards were not filmed a lot of the time.  The NARA description (see link to PDF at bottom) says:     The index consists of 3x5 inch cards arranged by state and thereunder   by name of petitioner, arranged according to the soundex system. The   index refers to the name and location of the court that granted the   certificate of naturalization, and to the volume and page number (or   certificate number) of the naturalization record. The printed cards   have spaces, often left blank, for other information from the   naturalization papers such as place and date of birth.   Of the handful of cards I've found in this collection, only one of the people whose card said (over) had an image of the reverse side in the microfilm.  The information on that card was the date a certificate was issued (which may not coincide with the date of naturalization, the field actually printed on the front side of the card).  One of the things on my To-Do list is to assemble a set of citations for the cards where I have no second image so I can email NARA and confirm that the second side of the card is lost because no image was made.  This is the practical reason I need to be able to specify exactly what images I have been looking at; simply attaching an image to an email won't give an archivist much information about where the ""original"" (in this case, original = the surviving derivative image copy) might be found in their collection.   "
826,Who officiated at this baptism? (need help with handwriting),"This image was clipped from a baptism register that is part of the Devon Parish records at Find My Past. These are baptisms performed in the Year 1888-9 at Slapton, St James the Greater (snippet is from page 62):    My research subject is recorded in entry No. 499, a baptism on 25 Aug 1889, William Henry, the son of William and Florence Elizabeth Cole of Slapton Village.  The column on the right is ""By whom the ceremony was performed"".  Most of the register pages I have examined from this period so far have the name of the Vicar, Honyman G. Warner.  His 1911 Census record is also available at FMP -- here is his signature:    But the baptism I am interested in was performed by someone else, and I can't read the name of the person or his title.  I'm linking the officiants at baptisms, marriages, and burials as associated persons, so I'd like to be able to record this name.   What references exist for this period about the clergy of the Church of England that would list them in chronological order or by parish? (i.e. something that would not require a search by name)  Can you make out the handwriting of this mystery individual?  I'd appreciate your best guess.   Here's what I've discovered so far:   The Clergy of the Church of England Database 1540-1835 (CCEd), which can be searched by the name of the parish, does not cover this period. Find My Past has a collection Clergy List 1896 which can only be searched by name:      The Clergy List 1896 provides details of each member of the Anglican   clergy in England, Wales, Ireland and the Scottish Episcopal Church in   1896. The records contain dates of the appointment to their parish and    you can search for your ancestors by name.   I was able to find the page with Warner's entry, which says ""vic 1885 Slapton, Kingsbridge, Devon"".  There are 26,501 entries, and FMP's search result page only gives a name in the search results, so even if I wanted to, there is no way to page through all of the entries looking for Slapton or to narrow the results.   Google Books has some issues of Crockford's Clerical Directory but as far as I can tell, the latest volume which is available to read online is 1868.   That volume lists:        WARREN, Richard Peter Formerly P.C. of Slapton, Devon, 1838-41 (p 688-9)   ANTRIM, Richard, Slapton, Dartmouth, Devon P.C. of Slapton, Dio. Ex. 1850 (p 14)      ... both of whom are too early to be the person in this register.  All the other mentions to Slapton in that volume of Crockford's are outside the Diocese of Exeter (they aren't the Slapton in South Devon, but refer to the other Slaptons). The handwriting in No. 499 is similar to many of the register entries performed by Antrim.    I plan to cross-check the British Newspaper Archive to see if I can find mentions of H.G. Warner.  I don't think I will find a news story about him taking a sabbatical from the parish, but you never know.  I also plan to look for more historical directories -- I have an earlier listing for Slapton which lists R. Antrim as the Vicar.    Suggestions for other sources, or readings of the name, are welcome!    I also have a guess about the father's occupation, but I'd prefer not to say so I can get fresh readings.  What does the occupation look like to you? "
827,"What might ""biblical"" names for Abel/Foot and Noake children in 17-18th Century Devon indicate?","As I look over my family tree I have started to wonder at the significance of what I call ""biblical"" names in a couple of branches.  For example my 6th great grandparents William Noake and Elizabeth Collis used the following names amongst their 12 children baptised at Long Burton, Devon, England:   Isaac (1731) Israel (1734) Joshua (1741)   When I look for each name elsewhere amongst my direct ancestors and their siblings I find:   Isaac is also used for Isaac Noake (1770) and Isaac Foot (1843).  As an update I have now realised that Isaac Foot's father James lost his mother at the age of 6 and his father's second wife was Mary Isaac so in that case Isaac is a ""family"" name. Israel is also used for Israel Abel (1637), Israel Abel (1673) and his brother Israel Abel (1679), Israel Abel (1709), Israel Abel (1758), Israel Foot (1782), Israel Abel Foot (1834) Joshua was not used again until I look into some cousins of direct ancestors rather than just siblings   If I look at the strongest ""signal"" then I see that the name Israel was first used by Henry Abel and Alse White in Hatherleigh (Devon) to name their son in 1637, and that it has been passed on via the Foot family through another 5-6 generations.  The name Israel in the Noake family seems to have arisen independently because those genes reached me from a different direction than the Abel and Foot genes.  The names Isaac and Joshua do not appear to have been passed on as strongly so I won't comment further on them.   I suspect that these ""biblical naming patterns"" in Devon may help me to deduce something about the religion of the people who were originally using them for their children but am uncertain what.  Do you think my Abel (or White) or Noake (or Collis) ancestors are likely to have been of the Jewish faith, or maybe Quakers, or perhaps something else?  Or in those times, in that English county, was it just fashionable to use such names? "
828,Why would a family baptise at a parish but not marry or bury there?,"I am researching the ancestors of Clementia Underhill, who married William Caldicott in 1703. According to her burial record from 1760, she was born in about 1675.  I believe that she was the daughter of a George Underhill, and have a candidate born in 1645 in Adminghton, Warwickshire to Thomas Underhill and Ann his wife. He was christened in Quinton but the baptism record of his older sister Jane (b 1635) mentions the parents as being of Adminghton. (NB there is another George born to these parents in 1640. I assume that this was a case if infant mortality and name re-use.)  Several other trees on ancestry.com link Thomas Underhill to Whitchurch in Warwickshire, but disagree on his father. I am inclined to reject this because I cannot find a Thomas amongst the Underhills baptised there (the only one that pops up in the index is a transcription error, of a daughter). There's no particular reason to link these two families, that were more than 50km apart. The use of the unusual name Clementia for his putative granddaughter leads me to suspect that he is in fact the son of Clement Underhill, baptised in 1615 at St Mary Abchurch, London. A London residence near Court followed by a return to country estates in the next generation would make sense if they were a relatively elite family.  But all of that is just background. The strange thing is that while I can find baptisms of several children of Thomas and Ann Underhill in Quinton, as well as children of an Edward and a John Underhill, there isn't a single marriage involving a male Underhill or any burials of Underhills in Quinton in the entire period 1600-1650. (I've just been through the scans of the parish records on ancestry.com, page by page. I might have missed a female Underhill getting married because the from was always listed first.) While I can imagine that marriages might be in another parish, that of the other half of the couple, I'm surprised that there were no burials of any Underhills in the same parish as the baptisms. Infant mortality was very high, and there were plenty of burials of children of other families, including unnamed unbaptized children, in these records.   So my question is: what if anything should I infer from the absence of burials in the parish of the baptisms?  EDIT: Here are the entries I've found so far. Note that the early part of this register is in Secretary Hand, which is very hard to read. Consequently the register is quite badly indexed on Ancestry.com.   Maria and Jane Underhill, daughters of Mr Humphrey(?) Underhill and Merriam his wife, baptised 3 May 1626. (mistranscribed as Overhill link, top of right hand page) Anne Underhill, the daughter of Mr Thomas Underhill, baptised 19 Nov 1628.

829,How to order copies of English wills (post-1858)?,"I have the following entry from the National Probate calendar and would like to find the will:     ELLIOTT Augusta of The Myrtles Slapton near Kingsbridge Devonshire   widow died 17 April 1947 Probate London 27 September to Caroline   Louisa White spinster. Effects £6696 8s. 4d.   Herber's Ancestral Trails (second revised edition, 2004) says that the LDS has microfilm of PPR wills from 1858-1925, which is not the right period for Augusta's will.  If I'm reading Herber correctly (p. 217) the valuations post-1898 include real estate unless it was settled elsewhere.  Notices were published in the Glocestershire Echo (6 Oct 1947) and the Cheltenham Chronicle (11 Oct 1947) which give the value of her estate as ""£6,696 gross, with net personalty £6,347.""  This figure may include the value of, or the proceeds from, real estate.  There are several notices about the auction of ""Myrtle Cottage"" in the Western Morning News, between 1 Mar 1947 and 13 June 1947, when the sale is reported as having been on the previous Wednesday: ""The Myrtles, Slapton, for £2.700 to Maj. A. F. Spooner, of Torquay"".  However, it seems odd that a sale, even when arranged for before her death, would be put through before probate was complete.  I'm assuming that unlike many of the other Devon wills I'm interested in, this one may still exist because 1) it was probated in London and 2) it went through probate in 1947, after the bombing of the Exeter Probate Registry.  Older reference works direct me to the National Archives' Documents Online service which is now closed.    Their page Looking for records of a will or administration after 1858 says to request copies of wills and administrations from the Probate Service, but the link goes to a beta and very generic web page that only has phone and email contacts for the court, with no information about ordering documents.  I'm also assuming that it's not likely there are draft copies at the Devon Heritage Centre. Their page Locating Devon Wills and Administrations says:     There is a card index in the Devon Heritage Centre to wills and   administrations found in catalogued collections held there. This   index, which was added to up to about 2002, lists only the name and   date and sometimes the parish of residence of the person for whom the   will exists. It also indexes wills found in the Exeter City Archives   collection held at this office - including Mayor's Court and Orphan'   Court wills.      This card index is being added to the webpage of the Genuki Devon   Wills Project, and therefore most of the card index entries are now   searchable on-line.   I've searched the Devon Wills project at GENUKI and there are no entries, either for Augusta or for her husband Charles (who died in 1919). His will was proved in Exeter so was probably destroyed:     ELLIOTT Charles Edward George of The Myrtles Slapton Devonshire   gentleman died 13 September 1911 Probate Exeter 28 January to Augusta   Elliott widow. Effects £631 13s. 11d.   Has anyone ordered copies of wills since Documents Online was closed?

831,Finding departure dates from port of Bremen?,"Some of the passenger lists for arrivals in the Port of New York found in Ancestry's database New York, Passenger Lists, 1820-1957 come from original records on NARA's Microfilm Publication M237, which Ancestry cites as follows:      Passenger Lists of Vessels Arriving at New York, New York, 1820-1897.   Microfilm Publication M237, 675 rolls. NAI: 6256867. Records of the   U.S. Customs Service, Record Group 36. National Archives at   Washington, D.C.   These are not immigration passenger lists of the type we see from Ellis Island -- those lists from Castle Garden were stored at Ellis Island and were destroyed in the fire at Ellis Island on June 15, 1897.  These are US Customs Service records, which have much less information.  A sample header from the Customs House lists is below. This is from a May 1879 arrival of the ship MAIN at the port of New York:    The departure port of Bremen is listed, but unlike the immigration lists, there is no date of departure.  Departure lists from Bremen for this year do not survive.  Die Maus says:     Unfortunately, all lists from 1875 - 1908 older than 3 years were destroyed due to lack of space in the Bremen Archives.   The site Norway Heritage's page for Norddeutscher Lloyd - 1879 says that the Main's authorization and route was      Via Fredrikshavn and Bremen to New York or Baltimore and on to the final destination   However, the only two search results in their database for 1879 are from November, which is after this New York arrival.  The Immigrant Ships Transcribers Guild (ISTG) has some Bremen departures for the Main -- with the FreeFind function on the site and a Google site search, I found:    an arrival for 8 March 1879 an arrival for 18 April 1879   FamilySearch's Historical Records Collection Germany, Bremen Passenger Departure Lists (FamilySearch Historical Records) starts in 1904 and is too late for this question.  I plan to search newspapers to see if I can find out any other information about this voyage of the Main, and to review the resources in the answers to the question Finding alternate indexes or record sets for passenger lists / ship manifests from Germany?, but I would like to find other resources that would tell me more about the ship's transit time and the departure from Bremen.    A description of the Main from The Ships List says the MAIN could travel at a speed of 13 knots:     MAIN 1868   The first MAIN was a 3,087 gross ton ship, built by Caird &amp; Co, Greenock in 1868 for Norddeutscher Lloyd [North German Lloyd] of Bremen. Her details were - length 332ft x beam 40ft, clipper stem, one funnel, two masts, iron construction, single screw and a speed of 13 knots. There was passenger accommodation for 70-1st, 100-2nd and 600-3rd class. Launched on 22/8/1868, she sailed from Bremen on her maiden voyage to Southampton and New York on 28/11/1868. In 1878 her engines were compounded by the builders and on 6/3/1890 she commenced her last Bremen - New York voyage. On 6/3/1890 she started her final Bremen - Baltimore crossing and the following year was sold to British owners. She was destroyed by fire at Fayal, Azores on 23/3/1892.

834,Starting pre-1837 research in England and Wales?,"What are some effective research strategies for England and Wales, when you are making the transition from the era of civil registration and censuses to the period before civil registration begins?  For a case study, let's use George Hindley and Hannah Drake (see related question Finding residence information for Toronto in the 1840s?).  A rough timeline of the family:   about 1818 According to Hannah's entry in the Williamstown, Massachusetts town records (Massachusetts Deaths, 1841-1915, entry 23 on the linked image), she was born in Sheffield, England, the daughter of Jonathan Drake. (Birth date estimated by FamilySearch website.) about 1819 According to George Hindley's entry in the Williamstown, Massachusetts town records (Massachusetts Deaths, 1841-1915 v 364 p 54 entry 233), he was born in Sheffield and his father's name was Samuel (no mother's name is given, and the field for the birthplace of his parents is blank). (Birth date estimated by FamilySearch website.) 6 June 1841 Ann Drake and George Hindley are enumerated in the same 1841 Census household on Bailey Street in Sheffield (HO107/1338/4/23/2); Ann is from Yorkshire; George (tailor) is Not from the County -- if this is accurate, the discrepancy could be explained by his reported birthplace in the death records being a 'he was from the area' place of origin, citing the nearest large town rather than the actual birthplace. August 1841 The couple marries.  This is from a listing of MARRIAGES in the Sheffield Independent, 14 August 1841, page 5:      On Sunday last, at Upper Chapel, by the Rev. B. T. Stannus, Mr. George Hindley, tailor, to Miss Hannah Drake.   This is likely to be Upper Chapel Unitarian church in the city centre of Sheffield. I found material via Google Books that discusses Rev. Stannus' tenure there. See also this post at Sheffield History: Rev Bartholomew Tealing Stannus which has a transcription of an account of a tea given to welcome him in 1838.    This marriage date is consistent with the Q3 Marriage Registration for George Hindley and Hannah Drake in SHEFFIELD Registration district Volume 22 Page 448 (the marriage estimated to be between late June - September of 1841). (I do not have the certificate or church register yet.)  **see update below line **  I have searched in the newly-released collection of Yorkshire Methodist records on Find My Past (see FindMyPast Friday for 13 Jan 2017 on the blog) which have transcriptions and marriages of Sheffield-area records, but did not find George or Hannah, but there are some other people with the surnames Hindley and Drake that I can follow up on.  The next time and place marker I have for this couple is 1844 when their first son Samuel is born in Toronto, Canada.  All the other information I have about this family is from the United States.  So far I have not been able to find any siblings or other relatives in United States records.  Obviously I need to widen the search, but how?      I don't have the marriage register from Upper Chapel yet, but I have the certificate from the GRO.      Eighth August 1841  George Hindley, of full age, batchelor,  Tailor,   Residence Rockingham Street, father Samuel Hindley, shoemaker      Hannah Drake, spinster, of full age, Residence Broad Lane, father   Johnathan Drake, (occupation unclear -- it might be 'Joiner')      Married in the Upper Chapel according to the rites and ceremonies of   the Presbyterian Dissenters by me, B.T. Stannus, Mins. of Upper Chapel   Witnesses:  J. Bridgeford, May Butler   George's son Samuel J. Hindley is also a shoemaker. While looking for possible records for Samuel Hindley (that is, candidates for George's father), I found a Samuel Hindley, shoemaker, in nearby East Retford, Notts. -- 22.3 miles (35.9 Km) to the E of Sheffield, according to GENUKI nearby places.

835,Should suffixes like Jr (Junior) and Sr (Senior) be added to family tree?,"Should I record Jr (Junior) and Sr (Senior) in family trees?

They are often referred to as Jr and Sr in written history. But in documents such as US Census, State Census, and War records, the Jr/Sr is omitted.   I found How to Use Jr, Sr, II, III, etc. (with Cartoons) at The German-American Genealogist Blog which says that the name can be used. But the website is not clear whether it should be when not recorded in official documents. It just covers convention if someone does decide to use Jr/Sr or Roman number numbering system. "

If so, was Susannah's maiden name Harding, or did Harding come from first husband John (and there is no clue as to the maiden name)? "
838,Take a punch at this (or...identifying a boxer?),"I have found the photo below amid a collection of family photographs. I don't think it's a relative, as we don't – to my knowledge – have any boxers in the family. But I am hoping to identify who this is. The only clue I have is that the word ""Butler"" is scribbled on the back. Is that perhaps the chap's name? I have no idea on a date, maybe early to mid 20th century? Presumably in England, but I suppose could be from anywhere.  Any ideas on who this is or how I might find out who this is?   "
839,Expecting Y-DNA match between 4th cousins to be much closer?,"I recently received results from a Y-DNA test between my uncle and a cousin. They are 4th cousins, 1x removed. I would expect them to match very closely as Y-DNA does not change much, however, at 12 markers they differ by 1 step, at 25 markers there are 3 step differences and they drop off as a match at this level in Family Tree DNA. By 36 markers there are 5 differences.   Does this seem a bit odd?   I was expecting the match to be much closer between 4th cousins.     I just checked, and most appear to be multi-copy markers, which maybe would account for it? The differences occur at DYS385 (the first number), DYS459 (the first number), DYS464 (the first number), CDY (both numbers). But I would think FTDNA would take that into account, and uncle/cousin aren't showing as a match beyond 12 markers. "
840,Seeking birth family of Michał (Michael) Gudzinowicz Praniewicz from Poland/Russia?,"after reaching out to some historical societies in Massachusettes, I learned that I was dealing with two exact people named “Michael Praniewicz” – sorry for all the confusion. Below you will see my edited, much more precise questions.  My main questions are as follows:    Where do you think Ryski, Russia is? This is the place of his birth listed on his naturalization (intent and decloration) papers. I cannot located any town called “Ryski, Russia”.       Furthermore, I found this list of noble people of Vilnius in 19th century. Both of his surnames “Praniewicz” and “Gudzinowicz” – could this just be a coincidence, or should I write to the Lithuania archives to see if they have anything on his birth in Wilno/Vilnius? It sort of makes sense to me because I have been told that our family was a wealthy family. Our last name means ""Son of a Laundered one"" Lol - so we musta been clean/wealthy folks!?   [website]He came to New York on a ship called “Palatia” on July 20, 1900. Looking through ancestory at all of the names, and he does not come up having arrived on the Palatia. Any ideas? Is there a way to search deeper into the ship records?     Full name: Michał (Michael) Gudzinowicz Praniewicz - Alternate spellings of surname: Prenewicz, Pronowicz?   birth date:      April 25th or 30th, 1871 or 1872 (listed on Naturalization papers July 9, 1912 and on death certificate June 24th, 1948)   birth place:    Ryski, Russia (listed on naturalization papers July 9, 1912) (Foreign residence St. Petersburg Russia) Poland (listed on death certificate)  death date: June 20th, 1948 11:35am death place: Allegheny, Pittsburg, Mercy Hospital parent's names: Unknown, but they were Polish   Spouce:  Rozilla OR Rosalie OR Rose, Salachińsk OR Salaczińska OR Salacheeska OR Salawański OR Salatyński OR Sałacztńska   spouse's birth date:    1893 (1940 Census, enumerated in Pennsylvania) 09 Feb 1891 (united states Social Security death index)  OR 11 Feb 1890 (according to Family)  spouse's birth place: Poland (family says “between Poland and Russia) spouse: death date: July 1976 (cannot find death record) marriage date: unknown, cannot find marriage record.

Family says she came to the US at 16 or 17 to live with her sister, met Michael when she worked as a waitress on the southside. He had been in Pennsylvania and owned property since at least 1906. He came into her restaurant and sat at the same booth and ordered coffee all the time. They liked talking because they understood the same language. Family said he was around 44 and she was 18 when they got married. Not sure if this is true.    religion: Catholic If immigrated, residence in US: He stayed in Pennsylvania his whole life.   "
841,What is expected shared cM of cousins with only one shared grandparent?,"Related to What is expected shared cM of double third cousins?, what would the expected range and average shared cM be?  In this case, I'm seeing 64.0 cM over 3 segments.  Looking at the table, that is less than half the expected average (433 cM) and nearly outside half the range (115 cM to 753 cM).  In this case, the further (1R) path includes a terminal paternal link that is a undocumented father with family stories giving the link.  Does this cast doubt on the half 1C1R and perhaps suggest it is more likely 2C1R (and no longer halved), that is the father of the illegitimate child was not the other's grandfather but instead his brother?  In such a path, the cousins most recent shared ancestors are now a married couple, hence no more need to halve the relationship.   Source: ISOGG Autosomal DNA Statistics "
842,Should the GRO Birth Index year be entered as birth year?,"The GRO Index, both the old and new versions, is the cornerstone of genealogy in England and Wales. So much so that for years I have been making certain assumptions based on GRO Index data. For example, I have been using the birth registration year as the birth year in my genealogy database. I am well aware that the year of registration is not necessarily the same as the year of birth, but it was an approximation I was willing to make. From looking at other people's family trees, I am certainly not alone in assuming  birth registration year equals birth year.  How much of a mistake is it to make this approximation? Why or why not might this approximation fail? How should birth years be entered in my genealogy software if the only information I have is the quarter and year of birth registration? "
843,How to add a biography to a person in Gramps?,"I use Gramps to record all my data and would now like to add short biographies to each person. That way I could keep all my information in one place and then write a custom report to generate a document on each person.  Is the best way to use notes, e.g. of type ""Report""?  Can I read the tags associated with a note programmatically? "
844,Y-DNA STR Testing - Zero Matches?,"Back in early 2010, I did a Y-12 test on my second cousin via the Genographic Project. Soon thereafter, I transferred the results over to FTDNA and he had zero matches at the Y-12 level.  Now, all these years later, I finally had a chance to test his father (my first cousin, once removed). For his Father, I did a Y-111 test and a Big-Y. The Father has plenty of Big-Y matches, but for his Y-STR, he only has one match and it's at the Y-12 level: his own son who I tested in 2010!  What is the significance of such a staggering lack of STR matches? What does that mean in simple terms that I can explain to them?  For what it's worth, I also did a Family Finder test on the Father and there are a respectable number of matches, just as there are for his Big-Y. It's only the Y-STR matches which are remarkably vacant. "
845,Becoming a master tailor?,"At the time of the 1841 census, one of my ancestors in Nottinghamshire, England was undertaking his apprenticeship with a tailor. A decade later, on the 1851 census, my ancestor is recorded as a ""tailor (master)"". The apprenticeship must have been completed by 1846, when he married (age 22). Unfortunately his marriage certificate (1846) and son's birth certificate (1848) only give his occupation as ""tailor"", so there are no clues there as to whether he was a master at that time.  I am trying to understand this ancestor's ""professional"" life between the completion of his apprenticeship and 1851.  What was the process for becoming a master tailor? On completion of an apprenticeship in the 1840s, could one immediately become a master, or was there further qualification required (such as admission to a guild)? I understand that often tradesmen would spend a period as a journeyman after their apprenticeship, but I am uncertain whether this was traditional or even compulsory. "
846,Who are the parents of Henry Charles Pynn?,"My 3x Great Grandfather was Henry Charles Pynn (1833-1894). I am trying to figure out who his parents were.  This is his Marriage Certificate to Eliza Pickering. His father is listed as John Henry Pynn, a Shipwright.    The next source I have is his Baptism record, here his parents are listed as ""John Tho. &amp; Charlotte"" John is a Shipwright the same as in the Marriage Certificate. (Bottom entry on picture)    The only two census results I can find for Henry Charles Pynn are the 1881 Census and the 1891 Census. As shown in the pictures below:  1881 Census:  1891 Census:   I can't find any other records relating to his parents. I'm looking for reasonable proof as to who his father is or an explanation as to why his father is listed under different names. As well as who his mother is.

847,What happened to the original household schedules used to produce the 1939 Register?,"The dataset called the 1939 Register of England &amp; Wales, released on FindMyPast, is comprised of the enumerator's transcript books (National Archives RG 101). Using the King's household as an example, the transcript books look like this:    The original data was entered by the householder onto a schedule, which looked like this:    As I understand it, the enumerator confirmed with the householder that the data was correct, issued identity cards, and then transferred the information over to the transcript books as shown above.  What happened to the original household schedules? Were they destroyed, or are they archived somewhere? "
848,What does the term חתן refer to when talking about the relationship between two men?,"I'm doing some genealogy research. Some of my ancestors are somewhat-known Hassidic figures. A few searches on Google yielded information in Hebrew and Yiddish that describes some of their dynasties.  What I can't figure out is the relationship between two men when someone is described as a ""חתן"" of someone else?   I know it's related to father-in-law and son-in-law but I can't figure out which one is which.  For example:     יעקב היה חתן מאנדל   Jacob was the Chasan of Mendel.    I think this means: Jacob was the son in law of mendel.  And:     יהודה לייב וחתנו אברהם   Judah Leib and his Chasan Abraham   I think this means: Judah Leib was the father in law of Abraham  Is my assumption correct? "
849,What did a Scientific/Philosophical Instrument Maker do and what other sources might be worth looking at?,"My 2x Great Grandfather was Robert H Mason, born in 1858 in Romsey, Hampshire to Robert Mason &amp; Ann Pearce. He came from a reasonably poor family where the majority of his siblings and cousins either followed in the footsteps of their parents as Agricultural Labourers or moved to London and mostly became Cab/Coachmen. Robert however, at 22 years old in the 1881 Census was working as a ""Philosophical Instrument Maker"" in Lambeth, England. He is listed on my great grandmothers birth certificate as ""Scientific Instrument Maker"" as well as in a probate record for him. Maybe he showed some sort of aptitude for this sort of thing in his early years and was inducted into an apprenticeship?   He married Milly Bungay in 1883 and had two children, Elinor Kate (1884) and Madeline Annie (1886). He died in 1890 aged 32 of ""Phthisis"" or more likely T.B contracted in London.  I've contacted Lambeth Archives but never received a reply. I'll try again after writing this.  Perhaps there are apprenticeship records or similar guild records?  My question is: Where can I look for records relating to this profession and this man?/Can you find any other records of him relating to his time in work? And what kind of work would he have been likely to be doing at this time?   EDIT: I know he might have been a malnourished child and would probably have not fully matured so might not have been a very useful Labourer. This is a newspaper transcript of his fathers death, he was found dead in a river the younger brother mentioned by Henry Mason is Robert H Mason.

850,Identifying Australian soldier named Williams in World War I photograph (1917)?,"Recently, I was able to obtain an image of a page from my grandmother's 1917 autograph book.  Her name was Gwenyth Jean Stacy (born 16 Dec 1902 at St Peters, Adelaide, South Australia) and at the time she was living with her parents and sisters at Henley Beach which is now a suburb of Adelaide, South Australia.    The date of 9 Jul 1917 is written with names next to three of the photos but I do not know whether that was the date they were taken on.    I have been able to identify the named female as Lorna (or Loran) Wallace Linklater (born 18 Jul 1901 at Semaphore, Port Adelaide, South Australia) and have since contacted a distant relative of hers via Ancestry.com and emailed a copy of Lorna's photograph to her.  At this stage I am not attempting to identify the second female photo because it is unnamed.  It does not appear to be my grandmother, either of her sisters who were eight and eleven years younger than her, or my great grandmother (Louisa Margaret nee Sellers), and its placement on this page suggests that she was a friend rather than relative of my grandmother.  However, I am very hopeful of being able to identify the two soldiers: the one named Williams in this question; and the other in Identifying Australian soldier named Bennett in World War I photograph (1917)?  He appears to be named Les or Leo A. Williams.    Can anyone help me with reading the handwriting and identifying him?    I will then try to contact his family and provide them with an image of his photograph.  Unfortunately his surname is very common, and although his second initial appears to be A I think his first name may be Leo or Les.  I am more than happy to share the pleasure of discovering who he was with anyone keen to look at Australian military records.  Some places that I have looked but that are worth revisiting are:   National Archives of Australia: Army – World War I: 1914–18 Australian War Memorial: First World War, 1914–18   One last piece of background, that may be relevant to this page, is that my late mother told me that my great grandmother held parties for Australian soldiers.  I do not know (and wish I had checked) whether it was this great grandmother of mine, or my mother's other grandmother, but I now suspect that it was this one.     "
851,Identifying Australian soldier named Bennett in World War I photograph (1917)?,"For more background to this question please see Identifying Australian soldier named Williams in World War I photograph (1917)?  This is a photograph of what I believe to be an Australian soldier from World War I named Bennett, and I would like to identify him.

852,Organizing geographical reference material for English parishes?,"My main research is kept on my computer -- I attach sources to Ancestry's and Find My Past's online trees primarily as a means to keep track of what records I've already found on Ancestry and Find My Past.  But there's a weakness in both lineage-linked software and online trees -- they don't provide tools to keep track of data about localities in the same way that we can keep track of information about people.   One of the problems of doing research online with sites like Ancestry and Find My Past is that the same locality can be reported in the search results under many different names.  You might find someone in the same place and not recognize it because the place name that turns up in the search results is not the one you expected to see.  For one of my families living in Plymouth for three decades, when I attached the 1891 Census to the tree, Ancestry's online tree system assigned them a Residence in Charles, Devon, England.  When you look at the record abstract in the New Ancestry interface, this is what you see:   Civil parish:    Charles Ecclesiastical parish:   Emmanuel Town:    Laira County/Island:   Devon Country: England Registration district:   Plymouth Sub registration district:   Charles   For the same record (matching archive reference of RG12/1725/24/41), Find My Past's transcription reports ""Belgrave Road, Plymouth, Devon, England"".  Here's the transcription as it appears on FamilySearch.  It's a simple matter to edit the fact on the online tree to say ""Plymouth"" instead of ""Charles"" and to note the address and various sub-districts in the description field.  In many modern programs, we need to regularize the place name to make use of queries and mapping tools.  But if we record all the place names as they appear in the original source, how can we make use of that information?  What I'm trying to do now is make up research notes about the locality which I can refer to, in case I am offline and I can't make use of the GENUKI gazetteer, A Vision of Britain, maps.familysearch.org, or Curious Fox's lists of villages.  I would like something I can refer to quickly, so if I am evaluating a baptism for Emmanuel Parish in Plymouth, I can see at a glance that I am in the same area as this family from this census.  I am currently cross-checking all my other records against the electoral rolls (and the 1939 Register for those people still living in 1939).  I can capture pages from all of my favorite geographical reference sites, but I want to make some kind of summary of what I've collected.  Do you transcribe the entire census record, headers and all?   The blank form for the 1891 Census has spaces to record:   Civil Parish Municipal Borough Municipal Ward Urban Sanitary District Town or Village or Hamlet Rural Sanitary District Parliamentary Borough or Division Ecclesiastical Parish or District   Ecclesiastical Parish is useful when cross-checking against baptisms and other church records; parliamentary boroughs and divisions are clues for tracing electoral rolls.  Even the sanitary districts can be used as clues to other records; I've found articles about local water quality via the British Newspaper Archive.  How do you organize this material? Do you keep spreadsheets, make tables, or some other method? What are the advantages and disadvantages of the methods you use?    Since writing the question, I see I could have saved myself a great deal of difficulty by going directly to Lewis' A Topographical Dictionary of England at British History Online, but at the time I wrote the question, I didn't know about the website; I was only vaguely aware of Lewis as the source behind A Vision of Britain.

853,Seeking marriage record of Pierce Butler and Anne Reynolds before 1832 in Ireland?,"I am seeking Catherine Marie Butler's PARENTS' names, their birth, death, etc., because I found and have copies of Catherine's name listed in ""THE IRELAND, SELECT CATHOLIC BIRTH AND BAPTISM REGISTERS, 1763-1912"" as ""SEPT 9, 1832 - BAPTISM PLACE: WESTLAND ROW, DUBLIN, IRELAND - CATHERINE M. BUTLER - FATHER: PIERCE BUTLER, MOTHER: ANNE - SS - MICHAEL REDMOND, CATH WHITE"" (I don't know what the column ""SS"" means, and I assume Michael Redmond and Cath White were her godparents/witnesses?)    Our historic and large family records and trees passed down through my generations show Catherine being born on 9/5/1832, baptized 4 days later, and listing her parents as PIERCE BUTLER &amp; ANNE REYNOLDS, but I haven't found details on them!    Our family records show that Catherine was born into wealth and nobility, so I, through research, suspect that PIERCE'S MIDDLE NAME MIGHT BE ""SOMERSET"", born 1/25/1801, died 7/28/1865, maybe lived in Kilkenny Castle.    He was an Irish politician in the United Kingdom House of Commons. On 2/3/1855, he married Jessy Anne Warren who could be his 2nd wife after Catherine's mother died and after she and Thomas immigrated to America in 1850.      I HAVE much info on Catherine: born 9/5/1832 in Dublin to ""Pierce and Anne""; maybe in Kilkenny Castle? She died in Pass Christian, MS on 4/22/1889 and is buried in St. Paul's Catholic Cemetery along with her husband, Charles Aloysius McDonald (10/22/1821 - 2/20/1890). I have copies of their marriage certificate and of their ""Find A Graves"" which I have visited several times.  Catherine's parents are not listed.  After Catherine's mother died, her father remarried sometime before Catherine was 17 because she at age 17, AGAINST HER FATHER'S WISHES &amp; DEMANDS - HE EVEN THREATENED TO DISINHERIT HER, immigrated to America, (I HAVE COPIES OF THE SHIP'S PASSENGER LIST), arriving in New Orleans on the ship GEORGE EVANS on 11/23/1850 with her younger brother, Thomas Butler, so that she could be governess to the children of her cousins, Percival Butler McCutchon and Jane Butler Browder McCutchon who lived in New Orleans. Percival and Jane were cousins who married each other: his and her mothers were sisters whose Father was Col. William Butler, one of the ""FIGHTING BUTLERS"".   In New Orleans on 1/11/1853, Catherine married another Irish immigrant, Charles Aloysius McDonald (a 31-year-old widower - his 1st wife was Kate Redmond - with 3 young children, who had immigrated to America in 1849, landing in New York, then moving to New Orleans). Charles was a brick mason.  Charles and Catherine moved to Pass Christian, MS where they raised 9 children, among them being my grandmother, Caroline Elizabeth McDonald, who married William John Bohn. They, too, lived in Pass Christian and raised 6 children, among them my deceased father, Hugh De Lacy Bohn.   Most of these relatives are buried in 2 cemeteries in Pass Christian, MS. "
854,Is Xmas 24th a common way to refer to 24th December (Christmas Eve)?,"I recently received an image from the inside cover of a book (""The Poetical Works of Lord Byron"") that I believe belonged to my great grandmother Mary Ellen Nettell (1869-1932) who was known as ""Nellie"".  At the time, Nellie would have been living in a suburb of Adelaide, South Australia, but she was born to Cornish parents in Angaston, South Australia and grew up there, possibly with some German influences from its other early settlers.    The easy to read inscription is:     To dear Nellie from Sadie With fondest love Xmas 24th. 1908.   I am sure the date being referred to is 24 Dec 1908, and while I commonly see ""Christmas Eve"" written as ""Xmas Eve"", I have never seen it written as ""Xmas 24th"".  Is ""Xmas 24th"" a way to refer to Christmas Eve that anyone has come across?    Note: I tried searching on the English Language &amp; Usage Stack Exchange, and although probably on topic for both sites, I thought I would post here in preference. "
855,"What uniform is this (US Army branch, where and when)?","I was going through some old photos and newspaper clippings that my grandmother (1913-2007) left behind here in Norway, when I came across this photo of a uniformed young man. To be honest I have no idea who it is, but I know she had an uncle who was born in 1888 and went to the US in 1907 (supposedly to Wisconsin), so that might be a link.  But could anyone tell from the uniform when this was, and also where he served? I see that the button on his collar says US 48. Could it be the 48th regiment or something? How does that match with him being born in 1888.   "

If not, what might be some other tools we might use? "
858,No first name on baptism record?,"I'm looking at the indexed record of a Drumond, son of Walter Drumond and Jennat Mcneil, baptised 07 September 1732 in Drymen, Stirling, Scotland. This record strikes me as unusual, as there was no first name given, and I would suspect that it indicates that the child died essentially at birth. Is there another explanation for this?  The entry in the original parish register reads:     Walter Drumond and Jennat Mcneill in Gartfarran had a child Baptised   called [blank]     In the event that this is not a child who died extremely young and didn't have a name, is there any suggestion as to how I might find the name of the child?

859,Receiving medical care at Nottingham General Hospital in the 1830s?,"I have two ancestors who I know were patients at Nottingham General Hospital. One ancestor died at the hospital in 1835. The other was there at the time of the 1841 census, and died at home a few months later. A death notice in the local newspaper reports ""His end was peace,"" suggesting a prolonged illness.  They both lived about 15-20 miles from Nottingham, and were about 60 years old. Neither were wealthy; one was a weaver, the other a labourer. This got me wondering about how unusual it was for someone of limited means to go to the county hospital at the end of life in the 1830s or 1840s. My impression is that most of my ancestors died at home during this period.  How was patient care at at Nottingham General Hospital funded in the 1830s? Would they themselves likely have had to pay for medical care they received? If not, could anyone have gone to the county hospital and expect to recieve treatment? "

862,Finding details of an 1821 Berks County Pennsylvania Guardian appointment of two minors?,"I am looking on Ancestry.com and trying to locate the detail of the following records to establish more information and parents and the orphans themselves.  It is known two Michael Saussers were in Berks county PA that passed away in 1821 as well as one of their sons Michael Sausser in the area but he would have only been 14 at the time of these records and unlikely able to be a guardian. The younger of the two Michaels had several children including a Joseph and Catherine... but Catherine was 19 in 1821 and Joseph was 15 so unlikely to need a guardian they also had younger children not listed. The only other known person named Joseph Sausser/Sauser/Souser at the time was 6 years old with unknown parents / siblings.  Ancestry has later probate/adoption records on file in the 1840s but nothing from this time period I have found.      My primary question is where can I find the detail of these index records to find out who these individuals were?   I searched Berks County's website of Probate records and found one entry for one of the Michaels mentioned above and plan on likely submitting a research request for it but it wouldn't necessarily contain the details of these adoption records which is the detail I am specifically after. There are no birth records though being returned for any variant of the surname for the time period on their site.  Document 1: From 1821 referencing page 481-483? Michael listed as ""Children Guardian"" as well as ""Inquisitor""? Catherine and Joseph as ""Guardian Appointed""    Document 2 From 1821 referencing page 483. Michael listed as ""Children Guardian"" Catherine and Joseph as ""Guardian Appointed"".    Document 3: From 1824:  Michael Sauser listed as ""Account"" referencing page 390.   I have found in other adoption paperwork that the appointed guardian is supposed to report every three years until I believe at least the child's 14th birthday their state of being so I am guessing that is what the 1824 record entry is listing.  The first and the third are from:  Index to Orphans Court Proceedings, Vol 001-017 Source Information Ancestry.com. Pennsylvania, Wills and Probate Records, 1683-1993 [database on-line].

863,Finding records of Transport-office that John Smyth worked for in London prior to 1806?,"I have been trying to determine the occupation(s) of my 4th great grandfather John Smyth, who married Sara Osment on 13 Jul 1764 at Stoke Damerel, Devon, when a ""Captain's Clarke ... on his majestys Ship Firm"" (see What might word &quot;wise&quot; mean on 1764 Marriage Record of John Smyth and Sarah Osment from Stoke Damerel, Devon, England?).  From then until his death (buried 23 Jan 1806) I have quite a good record of where he was living from the baptism records of his children, and land tax records for London and Surrey:   12 May 1766 • Minster, Kent 23 Mar 1767 • London, Middlesex 04 Feb 1768 • St Botolph Aldgate, London 14 Dec 1772 • Stepney, London 11 Sep 1773 • Bermondsey, Surrey 22 Oct 1774 • London, London 12 Jun 1780 • Middlesex 1780 • Southwark, St Olave, Surrey 1782 • Southwark, St Olave, Surrey 22 Feb 1783 • St Olave, Bermondsey, Surrey 1783 • Southwark, St Olave, Surrey 1784 • Southwark, St Olave, Surrey 04 Aug 1785 • St Leonard Shoreditch, Middlesex 1786 • St Leonard, Shoreditch 11 Mar 1787 • St Leonard Shoreditch, Middlesex 1787 • St Leonard, Shoreditch 1791 • Southwark, St Olave, Surrey 17 Jul 1792 • St Botolph Aldgate, London 22 Jan 1795 • London, Middlesex 1797 • St Leonard, Shoreditch 1798 • St Leonard, Shoreditch 1800 • St Leonard, Shoreditch 1801 • St Leonard, Shoreditch 1802 • St Leonard, Shoreditch 27 Aug 1804 • St Leonard Shoreditch, Middlesex 1804 • St Leonard, Shoreditch 1805 • St Leonard, Shoreditch 23 Jan 1806 • St Leonard Shoreditch, Middlesex   In his will (written 1804) he leaves £3,800 to his children which I think made him quite wealthy for that time so I am assuming he must have been quite successful in between his time as Captain's Clerk on the Ship Firm, and when he died but I have not been able to find any indication of what he did.  From his will it appears that he had lent his son-in-law John Stacy (Linen Draper/Grocer in 1822, Grocer/Tea Dealer/Shopkeeper/Dealer in Sundries in 1830; in Exmouth, Devon) and his son Thomas Smyth (Oilman in 1818, Grocer/Tea Dealer in 1825; in London) money (about £250 each) before 1804 so I am thinking that he may have had knowledge of their business areas.  I have just been scouring the British Newspaper Archives to try and find his name linked to those occupations or any of the above addresses and the only thing that I have found which looks remotely hopeful is the image below from the Morning Advertiser of 14 July 1806:    This seems to be the insured deceased who are about to have their life insurance policies paid out, and with John Smyth being buried on 23 Jan 1806 I am thinking that may have counted as ""1805 (Old Stile)"", and make this quite likely to be the correct John Smyth.  If so, what would be the ""Transport-office"" that is being referred to, and is it likely that its staff records have survived?  I am hopeful that details of the policy with ""Amicable Society for a Perpetual Assurance Office"" may also be available via The National Archives where there is an email address that I am going to pursue separately.    As a footnote to this, I was able to obtain scans of the pages related to John Smyth in ""NU158 Amicable Society, Claims register March 1806"" and ""NU1548 Amicable Society, Board minute book L 1796-1808"" related to John's policies No. 908 (admitted 2 Nov 1775) and No. 527 (admitted 14 Aug 1783) which note his position with the ""Sick and Hurt Office Towerhill but late of the Transport Office"", and have the payouts of £160 for each policy being collected by his eldest living son, and executor, William Smyth on 31 July 1806.

865,Determining the area covered by an Enumeration District (ED) on the 1939 Register?,"The way places are organized and indexed in the 1939 Register has me somewhat befuddled. Sometimes even when looking at an original page, the parish or village name is not shown, making it difficult to know where the household you are looking at was actually located. This may be due to the fact that other redacted lines on the page cover this key information. Fortunately, for the images I have looked at so far, I know where the addresses were even though it is not always obvious from looking at the record. However, I am wondering if any information can be gleaned from the Enumeration District (ED) codes.  Take this example from reference RG 101/6272A. At the top of the page is written three pieces of location information:   E.D. Letter Code: ROLQ Borough, U.D. or R.D.: Southwell R.D. [Rural District] Registration District and Sub-district: 431/2   The enumeration districts used in the 1939 Register were based largely on those from 1931 census. Using the 1931 census reports it is a fairly straightforward matter to determine that registration district 431 is Southwell, and sub-district 2 is Kneesall. However, there are still a large number of parishes in this rural district and registration sub-district.  FindMyPast have published a list of ED area codes which is useful to bookmark even though it does not tell me any more than is on the record itself. This list confirms that ROL corresponds to Southwell RD. The ED letter code is based on this three digit area code plus an additional sequential letter.  Clearly there are a number of EDs within Southwell RD (one of which is ROLQ). Presumably each enumeration district had specific boundaries - otherwise people could be easily duplicated.  I am unsure whether the area covered by an ED was determined by local or national authorities. This could affect where ED information can be found.  How can I determine what area was covered by an ED - either boundary descriptions, maps, or lists of parishes (or parts of parishes) included in that ED? "

I currently store it in a photo archival storage box. I currently live in Phoenix, Arizona. In general, our climate is generally hot and very dry. The Bible is not yet falling apart, but I do not want to handle it often.   Is there something else I should do to prolong the life of this Bible?

I know my great-grand-father had siblings, two for sure but I believe from talking with other relatives that there could be many more.  How can I find or research who my great-great-grand-father and his children were? I know he is from Germany. I know that most records are kept by the churches but how can I get a starting point as to what church to contact?

One thing that I am concerned with is privacy. I just published all the info I received - birth date, middle names etc. Since then I wondered if that is a reasonable thing to do.

What if the date is April 28, 1719?    Clarification:    Okay. I obviously didn't make this question clear enough. Let me try to make my question clearer:  Genealogists use double dates to try to prevent misinterpreting a Gregorian date for a Julian date and vice versa.  Let's say I have a record containing a date from this confusing time period.    How do I know whether its a Julian date or a Gregorian date? If it's a Julian date, how do I display it?

Are there circumstances that would make this dicey or questionable?  I regularly use Find A Grave in my research, but have yet to become a contributor of images. Would like to in the future, but just wondering if the posting of pics is 100% okay? Also wondering if the children of a deceased relative could feel possessive about a tombstone...?

881,Assessing accuracy and confidence in different types of records?,"My assumption is that an official country census is probably at the highest level of accuracy as although individuals may report details incorrectly, there is a fair amount of cross checking, but where there are other records is there a way to measure the level of assurance we can gain from them?

885,Tracing residence in England during WW2?,"This notice from the Cheltenham Chronicle published on October 11, 1947 refers to Mrs. Augusta Elliott as ""formerly of High-street, Cheltenham"".    I am trying to determine when she might have lived in or visited the area.  A rough timeline:   1855 Augusta Knowles born in Slapton near Kingsbridge in Devon 1861, 1871 enumerated in Slapton 1878 marriage to Charles Edward George Elliott (reg Q2 Totnes  5b page  5b   341 -- need to order certificate) 2 Aug 1879 son Cecil born in Dartmouth 1881 Census: Visiting Augusta's relatives in Brixham 19 Mar 1886 daughter Lillian born in Massachusetts family goes back and forth between Massachusetts and Devon several times between 1886 and 1910; they are in Massachusetts on census day in 1900 1910 Census in Massachusetts 1911 Census in Slapton 13 Sep 1919 Charles dies in Slapton (at The Myrtles) 1920 Augusta listed in Slapton in Electoral Registers (Spring, Autumn) 1939 National Registration -- Augusta is in Slapton (Evacuation of the South Hams: residents had to vacate by 20 December 1943 according to The Slapton Evacuation and were away until about August 1944.) 1944 Jun 16 in Cheltenham (from will -- see update) 1947 National Probate calendar ""ELLIOTT Augusta of The Myrtles Slapton near Kingsbridge Devonshire widow died 17 April 1947"" 1947 11 June: Auction of The Myrtles   1947 27th Sep   notice from the PPR attached to will: Augusta Elliott ""died on the 17th day of April 1947 at The Myrtles Slapton aforesaid""   The newspaper article about her probate is the only reference I have for anyone in the family, immediate or extended, as being from or associated with Gloucestershire. My hypothesis is that Augusta may have been in Cheltenham during the evacuation of the South Hams in World War 2.    However, I have no Gloucestershire contacts in any of the records for her or her extended family members.  All known family members lived in Devon, Hampshire, Kent, or Westmorland.    The other possible window is around 1890/1891 -- the 1890 US Federal Census was destroyed, and I have not located the 1891 Census.  Charles was born around 1855 in Devonport. In the 1861 and 1871 Census, he and his family are in Stoke Damerel.  All of the records I have found for Charles' siblings so far are in Devon (Devonport, Stoke Damerel, or Brixham).    Update:    The 1886 Wright´s Directory of Bristol and Clifton has a Charles Elliott, grocer, located in Watley's End (in the listings for places near Bristol), which needs a follow-up, but by 19 Mar 1886 Augusta is in Massachusetts.  Ancestry's database Gloucestershire, England, Electoral Registers, 1832-1974 for the Parliamentary Division Cheltenham has registers up to 1939, then they resume with 1945, Spring and Autumn.  There are no good matches for Augusta -- there are a few hits for an A. Elliott in Thornbury in the late 1940s. There are a few results in the Cheltenham registers for a Charles Elliott in 1920, but these are likely to be a different person (since Charles E G Elliott is already deceased by that time).  Update (17 Sep 2019):   1944 16th? day of June?: will of Augusta Elliott  ""who is at present residing at 407A, High Street, The Strand, Cheltenham in the County of Gloucestershire, Widow""  What other records besides newspapers and directories might be useful in filling in the rest of the timeline, now that I have a street address? What records would you use to determine when Augusta Elliott returned to The Myrtles? "
886,Could Francis Tolvert Greenway baptised 1774 at Falmouth be Francis Green who married Grace Woodley 1798 at Totnes?,"I have asked a question about my 4th great grandfather Francis Green previously as Finding late 18th Century service record of Francis Green in Cornish Militia?  Francis Green was, according to:   the 1841 Census, born about 1776 in Cornwall the 1851 Census, born about 1767 (his age is difficult to read and may be 84 or 64 but the latter would make him aged 11 when married!) at Falmouth, Cornwall. his burial, aged 94, in 1860, born about 1766   However, I have not been able to locate either a baptism or birth record for a Francis Green born anywhere in Cornwall between 1760 and 1780.  The nearest candidate is probably:  Name:   Francis Tolvert Greenway Gender: Male Birth Date: 5 May 1774 Baptism Date:   10 Jun 1774 Baptism Place:  Falmouth, Cornwall, England Father: William Greenway Mother: Mary FHL Film Number:    267525   Despite that baptism being in about the right place, at about the right time, with a name that conceivably could be shortened to Francis Green by accident or design I considered this to be a long shot until I started to think about why his second son was baptised John Soil Green (20 Nov 1803 at Brixham, Devon).  His first son William Woodley Green, baptised 14 Feb 1799, at Lustleigh, Devon, has a middle name matching his mother's maiden name, so I thought it likely that Soil might be a family name too.  These first two children from the marriage were followed by nine more baptisms, and only the last two of those were given middle names: Joseph (1806), Francis (1806), Henry (1808), Henrietta (1816), Charles (1816), Cordelia (1816), Amelia (1818), Matilda Grace (1821) and James Woodley (1826).  Those last two middle names match the maiden name of their mother Grace Woodley.  While researching Francis' candidate parents (William and Mary Greenway) I found their marriage record:  Name    William Greenway Gender  Male Marriage Date   30 Jan 1774 Marriage Place  Falmouth, Cornwall, England Spouse  Mary Sowell FHL Film Number 267525   It strikes me that Mary's maiden name of Sowell and the middle name of Francis Green's second son John Soil Green could be two variants of the same name.  My current theory is that Francis Tolvert Greenway baptised 1774 at Falmouth and Francis Green who married Grace Woodley 1798 at Totnes may be the same person.  To try and disprove that theory I have looked widely for records of a Francis Tolvert Greenway (or a Francis Greenway with or without middle names like Talbot because his sister Mary's middle name was Tolbot, and his maternal grandmother's maiden name was Talbot) beyond that baptism record, and have found none.  I have found burial records for all known members of the birth family of Francis Tolvert Greenway at Falmouth (except for his father William Greenway - no burial record found yet):   sister Mary Tolbot Greenway baptised 8 Apr 1776 at Falmouth and buried 22 Jun 1778 at Falmouth, aged 2 years sister Sarah Greenway baptised 3 Jun 1778 at Falmouth and buried 6 Jun 1778 at Falmouth, aged 3 days mother Mary Greenway buried 10 Jun 1778 at Falmouth, aged 24 years (matching the baptism of Mary Sowell on 8 Mar 1754 at Falmouth)   It seems like the childhood of Francis Tolvert Greenway was tragic because, when aged about 4 years, he lost two sisters (aged 3 days and 2 years respectively) and his mother within the space of about 19 days.  Presumably, he was then brought up by his father.  If Francis Green is the son of William Greenway then it is unsurprising that Francis' eldest son is named William.  Would the above body of evidence be approaching that needed to meet the Genealogical Proof Standard necessary to conclude that Francis Tolvert Greenway baptised 1774 at Falmouth is the same person as Francis Green who married Grace Woodley 1798 at Totnes?    This image is the clipped signatures of Francis Green and Grace Woodley from their marriage record at Totnes, Devon (where both were of the parish, and Francis was recorded as being in the Cornish Militia).  From this simple gauge it appears that both were literate.    Francis Green's home life was not always harmonious because The Royal Cornwall Gazette of 24 Oct 1856 reported that Francis and his son Francis had been assaulted by their son and brother Charles.    I am including some more details about Francis Green who married Grace Woodley at Totnes, Devon on 13 Feb 1798 comes from his military background (see Finding late 18th Century service record of Francis Green in Cornish Militia?) and the baptisms of their children:   William Woodley at Lustleigh, Devon on 14 Feb 1799 John Soil at Brixham, Devon on 20 Nov 1803 Joseph and Francis (twins) at St Clement, Cornwall on 9 Mar 1806 Henry at St Clement on 21 Feb 1808 Cordelia and Henrietta (twins) and Charles (who appears older from 1841 Census) at St Clement on 23 Jun 1816 Amelia at St Clement on 22 Nov 1818 Matilda Grace at St Clement on 7 Oct 1821 James Woodley at St Clement on 5 Feb 1826   These locations, events (including a birth estimate of 1770) and dates are mapped below and seem to support Francis having been born in Cornwall (Falmouth is the only place named for this event, and that was in the 1851 Census, the 1841 Census just says Cornwall), having been part of the Cornish militia for at least some, and I suspect all, of the 6 or so years that he lived in Devon, and then returning with his wife Grace and at least two children to Cornwall, where he spent the rest of his life around Truro (St Clement and St Mary).

889,How can I strengthen my identification of Luke Hallam and his wife Ann in 18th century Nottinghamshire?,"My ancestors John Brooks and Ann Hallam married in November 1798 in Clifton with Glapton, Nottinghamshire. The couple had 8 children baptised between 1800 and 1813. (All sources except where specified are the Marriage, Baptism and Burial Indices prepared by Nottingham Family History Society).  In the 1841 census Ann is shown as being 66 years old; her death certificate (1848) shows her as 75 years old. These two data points suggest a date of birth between November 1772 and June 1775.  There are 4 Ann Hallams baptised in Clifton with Glapton between  1769 and 1776; two of these can be eliminated as they died (a) in 1769 and (b) in 1829.  This leaves Ann Hallam daughter to Robert Hallam and Ann Wilkinson (baptised 1770) and Ann Hallam, daughter of Luke Hallam and his wife Ann (baptised 1773).   If 'my' Ann was baptised in 1770, she would have been at least 30 when she had her first child (assuming baptisms took place close to birth), which is old by the standards of the day. (The Ann baptised in 1773 would have been circa 27, which is also a little on the shady side).  Based on the data available, I've identified Ann daughter of Luke and Ann as my likely ancestor, and now want to move on to identifying Luke and Ann.  The name Luke Hallam is not common in the Clifton with Glapton Parish Registers. It appears at the baptism of his 6 children with Ann between 1773 and 1783; at his marriage to Mary Stevens in August 1803 (Ann was buried in March 1803); and at his burial in December 1820.  None of these records give his age. When I visited Clifton churchyard in 2009, I was unable to locate the graves of many Hallams and definitely not these two.  Ann (his wife) only appears in the registers at the baptism of her children, and at her burial in 1803. None of these records give her age.  However, their first child (Ann) was baptised in 1773; assuming this took place within 1-2 years of their marriage, I can estimate a marriage date of 1771-1772; and if they were older than 18 when married, I can estimate birth dates of 1753 or earlier.  Searching the Nottinghamshire Family History Society Marriage Index 1533-1929 (which has excellent coverage), there are only 2 marriages of a Luke Hallam to an Ann[e] in Nottinghamshire -- one in 1694 (too early) and one in 1772 (Luke Hallam to Anne Gervas on 20 Apr 1772 in the parish of Plumtree.)  Plumtree is 5 miles from Clifton so the geography is not a problem; and the date ties up with the baptism of their first child in December 1773.  However, it is possible that they married outside Nottinghamshire...  A Luke Hallam married Ann Mee on 1 Feb 1768 in Barrow upon Soar, Leicestershire (they were both 'of this parish'), but they were baptising children in Barrow Upon Soar in the same period as Luke and Ann in Clifton, so can be eliminated. There are no other marriages between Luke Hallam (and variants) and Ann (and variants) between 1750 and 1800 in any online index I can find.  Are there any other records I could consult which would strengthen the case for Luke Hallam and Ann Gervas being the parents of Ann Hallam baptised 1773 in Cifton with Glapton? Or do I have sufficient evidence to make the case already? "
890,What is being recorded in this Latin church vital record?,"I have a document from the Ljubljana archives in Slovenia that I do not understand:    As best I can tell, it is written in Latin and there are alternating columns for male and female sex.  I think a date and house number are in the first column.  Is this some kind of baptism record?  I think I'm most interested in the * entry with numeral 8:    Which appears to read:  8 Mathias, Andreas Lousheg ejurgue   vxoais gealaudis Vedmayerin fil   Lagid: Sub Ino Ashiber, Bsarhiealus   erl 13 January 1771 per N. R. I.   Malhiam Mervezh Cogreral: Baboini   Anton Kovalshekshiel Glhorina Sebastian     Ex Hoarbauza   What kind of record is this?  Baptism, marriage, death, status animarum, or something else?  Why does it have this unusual organization that is new to me?  I think it might be a baptism record for Andre or Mathias Gregortschitsch with parents Sebastian Gregortschitsch and Gertrud Gotschitinn who live in Rosenberg 1 of Šentrupert. "
891,"The elusive Michael Gassmann of Birlenbach, France","I am trying to track down an individual named Michel/Michael Gassmann/Gaßmann in Birlenbach, Alsace (Departement Bas-Rhin), France. Here is what I know about him:   Between 1668 and 1684 he is named as godparent (""Gevatter""/""Tauffzeug"") no fewer than ten times. Up until 1674 he is identified as the son of the late Ulrich Gassmann. The first of these records is here. In 1682 his little boy (""Söhnlein"") is buried. (There is no birth record of the child, even though the records seem pretty complete otherwise.) Between 1683 and 1697 he has four other children with his wife Margaretha. (Marriage records in this time are incomplete, and I could not find his.) Here is a link to one of these four birth records. On September 9, 1711, a sixth child, Hanns Michael Gassmann, is getting married. I could not find his birth record, either. Here is the marriage record.   The main question is: Can all these records belong to the same person? For that, it seems he would have had to have been named as a godparent while still in his teens. And then there is the sheer number of godparenthoods, and the last names on these records do not repeat. It it almost looks as though he may have just happened to be in church and handy at the time. This strikes me as rather unusual, but perhaps that was a common occurrence in those days? (These records are from Alsace, so I am not sure whether I should apply German or French norms, even if I knew what they were.)   What makes this one so puzzling and frustrating is not that there are no records, but rather that there are so many of them, with just two or three crucial ones missing. What other internet resources might there be to nail things down? "
892,Helping my son find his unknown biological father,"My son's biological father and his family is unknown. Both my son and I took Ancestry DNA tests. Then I went through his matches for ""shared matches"" - if I didn't show up, I assumed the match was from his paternal side. Is this assumption correct?  Now we've both uploaded our raw data to GEDmatch and FTDNA. Is there a one-to-many test for my son's dna that excludes matches to me?  Is there some other DNA test we should do? "
893,Finding original spelling of Polish name Vazuka which was anglicized on arrival to US?,"My last name is Vazuka, but it is polish and was anglicized upon arrival to the US.   How do you spell it in Polish?  How do you pronounce Vazuka in Polish? "
894,Half brother and sister related to other family?,"After taking an AncestryDNA test, I matched a half brother, who I'll refer to as Y to preserve privacy, and sister, who I'll refer to as X.  Both appear to come from the maternal side (both adopted and all family information verifies a male and female child).   My results now show that my full sister, who I'll refer to as S (and I grew up with) is actually my half sibling. I share no paternal DNA with her, but share maternal DNA. We all have the same mother.   However, my half-brother Y and half-sister X do not show my (assumed) full-sister S as a DNA match. A transplant surgeon verified that I am half sister to each of them.   What in the world is going on here?    Why don't Y and X appear as a DNA match to S?   We are confident we all share the same mother. Mother has passed and no idea who the father could be. "

896,How many CentiMorgans would a half 2nd cousin be?,"I have a cousin who is adopted. I am related on her father's side, but we don't know who he is. Ancestry says she and I share 250 cM in 12 segments, Gedmatch says 255.2 cM in 11 segments. She shows up as a 2nd cousin on Ancestry, but she only shares 48 cM in 5 segments with my nephew (my sister's son). Ancestry has him listed as her 4th cousin. I know who our shared ancestors are, but the male had 2 children by his first wife, then the rest (my line) by his 2nd.   I was just wondering if she came through the first wife and was my half 2nd cousin, and therefore my nephews half 3rd?   Would that explain the difference?   Does anyone know what the numbers are for a half 2nd cousin?   Or do you think she is a full 2nd cousin? "
897,Assessing the frequency of surname in an 18th century English parish,"I have a set of marriage and baptism records for an 18th century/early 19th century English parish, and want to assess the probability that the participants are related in some way, before I spend hours and days tracking all mentions of the surnames in the relevant (and adjacent) parish records. If they're common surnames in the area at the time, it's probably wasted effort.  I know there are resources that look at the frequency of surnames in the 19th century censuses, but is there anything earlier?  My data (so far) (all sources from the Rowley Regis Parish registers published by Midlands Ancestors except where noted).

These were the parents of Mary Darby (bapt 1813) who married Richard Nightingale above.   The Darby link is visible (but where does Isaac Darby fit in?) And how can I determine if the Nightingales are likely to be related? "
898,Has Ancestry.com stopped making available gedcoms?,"I stopped doing genealogy about 12 years ago, but have recently taken it up again.  Last when I was doing it, members of Ancestry.com could upload GEDCOMs and download those of other members.  I recently re-subscribed to Ancestry and see that they have a GEDCOM upload option, but I do not see any option to search or download GEDCOMs of other members. Also, when I do searches which I know contain name in other people's GEDCOMs I see no results pointing to those GEDCOMs.  What has happened to the GEDCOM support on Ancestry.com? Can somebody catch me up the last 12 years? "
899,"What is ""Geschwisterkind von muetterlicher seit""?","I have a death record from 1790 Alsace. It concerns a one-year old child named Johann Philipp Gassmann, son of Johann Erhardt Gassmann and Margaretha Bley. As seems customary in Alsace at the time, the entry in the church register was signed by several witnesses (for lack of a better term), including Daniel Bley, the ""unmarried brother of the child's mother"", and Michael Heinrich (not sure if that's the last name), who is identified as ""Geschwisterkind von muetterlicher seit"".   What is that?   How does he fit into the family?   Can it be inferred that Heinrich is his last name?   Could it be Bley?    Someone wanted to see an image of the record. This was actually a bit trickier than I thought, but here it is:  My read of this record: ""Den 10ten May starb an einem ??fluss und damit verbundenen Gichtern des Johann Erhard Gassmann Buergers zu Birlenbach mit Margaretha einer gebohrenen Bleyin seiner Ehefrau ehelich erzeugtes Soehnlein Namens Johann Philipp. Es ward den 12ten darauf auf dem dasigen Gottesacker zur Erde bestattet, alt 1 Jahr weniger 9 Tage.

900,Should Male or Female Sibling Take DNA Test?,My sister and I are looking to do a DNA test to aid in our genealogy research.  What is best practice here?  Would one of us provide better results or will they be the same? 
901,"What is ""dritter Grad der Blutsverwandtschaft"" (third degree/grade of blood relationship)","Just found the term ""dritter Grad der Blutsverwandtschaft"" in a 1793 marriage record of northern Alsace. I know that I can translate this to ""third degree or grade of blood relationship"", but that does not really help me. Are we talking about second cousins? third cousins?      Added after some reflection: The two men so identified were members of the bride's wedding party, but neither was the groom. I have not seen such identifications in any other records from the era and area. Why would they be added here? "
902,"Seeking 1880 Birth Record of Santa Catherine Gazzanovich at Brecon, Wales?","My Grandmothers sister was Mary Evans,born Merthyr Tydfil 1856.  On the 5th may 1875 in Cardiff she married Nicoli Gazzanovich.  Their daughter Santa Catherine Gazzanovich was born in 1880 according to the 1891 census records for Cardiff (RG12/4835/109/41, address 240 Roberts Street), that puts her place of birth as Brecon.  In the 1881 records for Nicoli and Mary Gazzanovich in Cardiff (RG11/5280/147/97), Santa is not there, although she was born 1880.  Nicola (Ship Carpenter) and Mary Gazzanovich baptised Santa Catherine on 6 May 1887 while living at 3 Robert St, Roath, Glamorgan.  Just over a week earlier John (Surveyor?) and Amy Gazzanovich baptised Mary on 28 Apr 1887 while living at 3 Robert St, Roath. FindMyPast has images of both baptisms.  @HarryVervet suggests that the earlier baptism may have been an adult one of Mary Evans  Mary Gazzanovich died in Cardiff in 1900 and shortly afterwards Santa married William Howard Lewis in Q2 1900 in District of Cardiff (11A/613), and later immigrated to America.  In the 1901 Census William Lewis (Marine Stoker, born Cardiff, aged about 27) and Santa Lewis (his wife, born Cardiff, aged about 22) are living at 65 Stockland Street, Parish of St Mary.  An American census gives her birth as Cardiff 19 Jun 1880.  Santa married  again on 16 Nov 1910 at Pennington, South Dakota, USA to Hale M Crowhurst. She died in Oregon in 1950.  How can I find details of her birth? "

Family Tree says he is a 2nd or 3rd cousin.    How do I know which one he is?    Since we know the connection is on my birth mother's side, would I be looking for grandparents on his mother or father's side or great-grandparents? "
904,Origin of surname Jess in Poland/Germany?,"It always puzzled me, where is my last name from?   I have no clue, since I have never seen encountered my last name anywhere else.   We come from Poland. Our family supposedly comes from around Düsseldorf.   But is this last name German?   Or did they move there from somewhere else?  The topic of my family's origins is a taboo at my house, so I don't know much, but here's what I know   One of my ancestors, Aleksander Jess, died during the Nazi times in Nazi Germany. I have seen the death certificate once. No, there's no way I can possibly post the picture. Why? As I have said, it's a huge taboo at my house. I'd have to ask somebody where is it. Edward Teofil Jess, was born on 05.03.1889 (European way of writing down the date) in Kalisz, Poland. He was the son of Krzysztof Jess and Zofia from the house Neumann. He studied in Petersburg and in Warsaw, at the University of Technology. He fought in the WWI, the Polish-Soviet war (1919-1921) and the World War II. He had a wife and a daughter, Zofia.

906,"What information is contained in Isle of Man birth, marriage, and death certificates?","Today I discovered a relative who was born on the Isle of Man. I am considering ordering her birth certificate, which got me wondering about what would actually be on it.  It appears civil registration in the Isle of Man was independent of civil registration in the other countries of the UK. There are a number of differences between BMD certificates from England &amp; Wales compared to those from Scotland or Ireland. For example, see the previous question titled: UK death certificate details in 1908.   What fields are given on a birth, marriage, and death certificate from the Isle of Man? What are the differences compared to other countries of the UK? Has the content of BMD certificates changed since the start of civil registration?  "
907,Does the available evidence support these assumptions?,"I'm devising a complex search strategy to identify the birth and parents of my great-grandmother Mary Ann Harper. She's already discussed here: Where was Mary Ann Harper in the 1881 England census? and here: Locating an elusive UK birth record (Mary Ann Harper born circa 1865 possibly Dudley, England)? and I hope I've taken full account of the answers to those questions in the formulation of my strategy.  As it's based on a number of assumptions, I need to assess what flaws exist in the assumptions and correct them before I implement the search strategy. (I'll ask a separate question about the search strategy, as the two elements combined produced a long unwieldy post, and I want to make sure my assumptions are the best they can be before finalising the search strategy).  Question  I'm asking:    Are my assumptions justifiable, given the evidence currently available? How should I amend them, and why?   Assumptions  Forename:   In the majority the records in which she has been identified (from her marriage certificate in 1883 to her death certificate in 1932, including the birth certificates and marriage register entries for several of her children, the censuses from 1891 to 1911 and electoral registers from 1918-1930) she is identified as Mary Ann. In a small minority of the records she is identified only as Mary.  I am assuming she was known as Mary Ann (by choice) or Mary at all points in her life , but will also consider variants such as Mary Annie, Mary Anne and Maryann and possible mis-spellings/mis-transcriptions of those variants, as well as Polly or Molly as a childhood name.  My search will also include other names beginning with Mary such as Mary Alice or Mary Elizabeth, for the purposes of elimination (as they may also appear in records as simple Mary).  I think variants such as Marie, Maria, Marisa and a whole host of others are unlikely (except as transcription errors), as are Ann or Nancy (based on the fact that she used neither in later life).    Surname:  In all the records I have seen where this is recorded, it's shown as Harper but I'll consider variant spellings as well, primarily Harpur, Harpour and Harp; and be alert for mis-transcriptions (Hasper and Harker seem to be repeat offences).  More importantly, I'll consider three hypotheses for her surname:   She was born Harper, either legitimate (father named Harper) or illegitimate (mother named Harper, no father named). She remained a Harper until she married. She was born a Harper but her mother remarried. Mary Ann adopted her step-father's surname (or was erroneously recorded with her step-father's surname in censuses) but used her birth name on her marriage certificate. She was born with another surname, but her mother subsequently married a Harper. Mary Ann adopted his surname and married under it.   In case 1 and 3, I'd expect to see her recorded as a Harper in the 1881 census (2 years before her marriage) and possibly earlier censuses as well. In case 2, she could be recorded as anything.    Birth year:  Her age at marriage in 1883 was given as 18, suggesting an birth year of 1864/1865, which is consistent with her ages in the 1891 and 1901 census.  In 1911, she is shown as 40 years old, which would give a birth date of 1870/1871,  but I think it highly unlikely she was married at 12/13 years old (although it would have been legal at 13) and having her first child 4 months later.  At her death in 1932 she was aged 66, suggesting 1865/66 for her birth.  Her known children were born between 1883 and 1902, which doesn't constrain the likely birth range any further.  I am therefore assuming she was born between 1860 and 1870; and that it's most likely but not certain she was born in the middle of that range (1864 to 1866).    Birth place:  The censuses from 1891 to 1901 (which are the only evidence so far for place of birth) consistently state that she was born in Dudley (which was at various times in Staffordshire or Worcestershire, but Staffordshire around the expected time of her birth). However, I'm not relying on this, as it might simply be the first place she remembered living.  At her marriage she was living in the poorest part of central Birmingham. Her children were born variously in or near Burton-on-Trent (including her first child), or in or around Birmingham.  I am making no assumptions about her birth place, as there isn't enough evidence to support any.    Residence:  Although I'm making no assumptions about her birth place, I think it likely but not certain that she was resident in England before her marriage in 1883, long enough to meet her future husband and fall pregnant in late 1882.    Parents names:   I have no evidence for her mother's name.  Her father is named as James Harper (deceased) in her marriage certificate, but that could be:   The name of her birth father or step-father. A fiction concocted to diguise the fact that she was illegitimate.   I am making no assumptions about her parents' names. "
908,Bauch Family records Berlin-Charlottenburg,"How can I find out about my grandfather's siblings?  Would a German death certificate for my great grandfather have his immediate family listed?

Berlin telephone directories and a photo have the family in Berlin up until 1922. "
909,Early NY and PA research,"I've hit a difficult spot in my research, and I'm hoping for some research suggestions. My ancestor, Christian Rice was born in Orange County NY in 1762 (""near Goshen""). In his pension application, he states that his mother was a widow when he was about four years of age (abt 1766), at which time they moved to Wyoming Valley (part of Pennsylvania &amp; Connecticut during this period in time), and then to Jenkins Fort in Pennsylvania. They then moved to Sunbury, Northumberland County PA around 1779 when he enlisted in the revolution, then moved to Hempfield Twp, Lancaster Co., PA, where he lived until about 1788. He then moved to Brothersvalley Twp, Bedford Co, PA, and then Milford Twp, Somerset Co., PA, where he died in 1842.   I've had a lot of difficulty trying to locate the names of Christian's parents. The most I know about his family is that he had a sister (name unknown), and his mother was a young widow. I know she was still alive by at least 1779 at the time of his discharge from the military service. Based on the 1790 and 1800 Somerset County, PA census records, I believe his mother may have lived with him as there is an older woman in the household. In the tax records for Lancaster Co., Christian is listed as a single freeman. He is the only Rice in Hempfield Twp, which makes me think his mom would have lived there under a married name, or she lived elsewhere.   Basically, I'm unsure of where to look next. I wrote to the Orange &amp; Ulster NY Historical societies, and they could not locate a birth record for Christian, nor any death records that could be potential candidates for Christian's father. Online, I found records for Harrison Meeting house in Montgomery, NY that have a Christoph Reuss born to Christoph &amp; Catherine in 1762. This record is a very strong contender, but there's not proof yet. This record also lists a sister named Maria, and does not list any sponsors other than the parents, which could indicate that they did not actually reside in that area, if this is indeed the correct birth record for him.  I checked NY and neighboring PA counties for wills and probate records for Rice's who died between 1762-1775 or so, since his father died around that time. While there were some, they did not fit with what was known about the family, so I ruled them out. I would also think his mother would have remarried shortly after she was widowed as she had two young children, but I've no idea where to look for such a record. As far as I know, Wyoming Valley could have been a part of Berks, Northampton, or Northumberland Counties in PA, and some records may also be in Connecticut.   I would appreciate any advice as to where to look next, or which research avenues to pursue in order to find Christian's parents. I'm afraid I'll have to hire a professional genealogist for help, but I've done so much research thus far, that I would hate to pass it off to someone else. This is the text of his pension application, which has provided the most clues for my research:     State of Pennsylvania   Somerset County   In testimony that the foregoing is correct I William H. Postlethwaite Prothonotary of the Court of Common Pleas of Somerset County have hereunto set my hand and affixed my official seal this 27th day of April 1838.   W.H. Postlethwaite   Prothonotary              Christian Rice   Petition of Christian Rice a revolutionary soldier for pension. May 28, 1838   Ref to the Committee on Rev.y Pensions              To the Honorable the Senate and Members of the House of Representatives of the United States in General Congress assembled-   The petition of Christian Rice a resident of Milford township, Somerset County and State of Pennsylvania Humbly represents.   That your petitioner was born in the state of New York, Orange County, near Goshen in the year 1762 on the 25th of April. When about four years of age, petitioner’s mother, a widow, removed to Wyoming and thence to Jenkins Fort in the state of Pennsylvania. When about sixteen years of age your petitioner had gone to Sunbury on some business for two or three days, and on his return he ascertained that the Indians had approached Fort Jenkins and killed seven men and wounded his sister while she was attempting to make her escape to the fort. At this news, your petitioner was so much enraged that he went immediately back to Sunbury where he enlisted in the year 1778 in the month of May or June in the company of Captain Thomas Gascon.   Petitioner though his memory has failed much, is certain that he enlisted from the fact that he was promised four dollars at the time and eight dollars a month for six months which however, he never received. From Sunbury, petitioner with part of his company, marched to Wyoming where the troops were to assemble. From Wyoming, they marched to Tioga where they built a small fort. They remained at Tioga fort until General Morgan came there with his rifle regiment. From Tioga fort they marched to Chemung, an Indian village. General Sullivan in command. The Indians were in possession of a small fort at Chemung, an attack was made upon the fort and after a sharp engagement, the fort was stormed and the Indians driven out with the loss of some thirty or upwards of their men about the same number of our troops were killed and wounded. Amongst the wounded, petitioner recollects Lieutenant MCurdy who was shot through the knee and taken to Wyoming where his leg was amputated and he afterwards died. From Chemung we marched to Queen Esther’s town, an Indian village from which the Indians had fled. We destroyed all their corn and the village. From Queen Esther’s town the army went on but your petitioner with others was detached to take the wounded to Wyoming. From Wyoming we returned to fort Tioga and there remained until the army returned. From Tioga we marched back to Wyoming and thence to Cox’s town where we were discharged. Petitioner received a written discharge after serving six months which discharge with the record of his age was burned in his mother’s house by the Indians. Petitioner recollects no other officers but those mentioned and Lieutenants Moses MCurdy and John Meads and another young officer which petitioner recollects from the following circumstance, viz: two men had been detected in stealing a keg of flour and were sentenced to run the gauntlet. Petitioner had broken his stick near the point so that in striking the men he would be unable to injure them. The young officer alluded to ?? behind struck your petitioner with a ratan using this language “you damned young rascal, I will make an honest soldier of you.”   Your petitioner knows of no witness now living who can prove the service detailed and from age and disease produced as petitioner believes by his service in the army, his memory has become so treacherous that he may have forgotten some of the dates mentioned in this petition. But he knows the facts as stated are all correct. He is now seventy six years of age and so far a cripple as to be helpless and unable to leave the door unless helped or carried. Your petitioner is in necessitous circumstances and actually needs such pittance as your Honorable bodies or either of them may grant him to secure to him the actual necessaries of life. He further declares that his name is not on the pension roll of any agency in any state and that he doth henceforth renounce all title to any other pension or annuity than the one now prayed for.

910,"Is a half-sibling match on AncestryDNA reliable, or is more testing needed?","I'm new at the DNA testing but here are my results. After receiving my DNA results in January 2016 my first match was with a known cousin who is also on Ancestry with a score of 959 centimorgans at 41 segments. That's all the information from the site but I thought this looks very reliable since she is a known first cousin.  My second match came a day later with a male individual with a shared score of 1775 centimorgans at 46 segments and the predicted relationship is HALF SIBLING. Since they are adopted this would make him my half brother, same father but different mothers.   When I consulted and asked Ancestry DNA about the results they said their test was very reliable with those high scores. Another option they suggested was to take a relationship test but half brother testing still may or may not be confirmed with this test and show the same result. The documentation is limited and there is only hear-say information about the possible relationship between the couple.   Should I take these results as reliable or does anyone recommend a test that would be more conclusive? There are no parents still living.  If I can rule out everything except half-brother would you still recommend either GEDMatch or FTDNA? If yes, which would be better? "

912,Finding period travel information -- or How far away is too far?,"This is related to the question Why would a family baptise at a parish but not marry or bury there?.  If you've exhausted all the records available to you for a parish, and you want to widen your search, how can you tell if you've traveled 'too far' in your attempts to make an exhaustive search?  Some local travel information can be found on websites such as Devon Heritage.  But how do we take these materials and put them into the proper historical context?  In the US, research guides often suggest the use of topographic maps like the USGS Historical Topographic Map Collection.  In the UK, one can access Ordnance Survey Maps - Six-inch England and Wales, 1842-1952 at the National Library of Scotland or the historical maps available at A Vision of Britain Through Time or [website]Historical maps are a great resource, but how do you get a feel for how people commonly travelled, and how far was 'too far'?  Obviously it varies with economic status, as we can see from this exchange in Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice:     ""It must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a   distance of her own family and friends.""      ""An easy distance, do you call it?  It is nearly fifty miles.""      ""And what is fifty miles of good road?  Little more than half a day's   journey.  Yes, I call it a very easy distance.""   In my husband's family, I have several instances of census records where grandchildren are listed in the households of their grandparents, nieces visiting aunts, and so on, so the family connections quickly become evident.  In the US, I also have several notices from the gossip-filled small town newspapers which list which family is visiting and from where.  Without those hints, how can you tell if you have strayed past Elizabeth's, or Darcy's, ""easy distance""?       Note the distances children were allowed to travel alone in this article:  How children lost the right to roam in four generations     The generations who walked everywhere would, it seems to me, have a much different sense of distance than those of us raised to go everywhere by car.  City dwellers would likely be different than those raised in rural areas, etc.   "
913,"Descendants of Sir William Blackstone, a historical puzzle","I have been researching my paternal line and have come across a stumbling block.  My line can be traced pretty easily back to the beginning of the 19th century in Ohio, where we come across one Ebenezer Blackstone (1776?-1824).  Try as I might, I cannot go back any further, but my searches have come across the following passage which may or may not prove fruitful.  At   [website]we have the following passage of interest.     September 25, 1859, he married Miss Ionia Blackstone, great-great-great-granddaughter of William Blackstone, the famous   author of Blackstone's commentary on law; also of George Fox, the   famous leader of the Quakers; and a third cousin of ex-President   Rutnerford B. Hayes. Her father, Ebenezer Blackstone, was born in   Smithfield, Ohio, and was a son of William Blackstone, a dry-goods   merchant of Philadelphia, and later a resident of Smithfield; he   married Miss Ann Price, whose mother was a daughter of George Fox.   William's father, Ebenezer, was born in England, where his father,   William Blackstone, was a leading attorney and writer upon law. The   various branches of the family were allied with the Society of   Friends. Ebenezer Blackstone, Jr., engaged in the dry-goods business   in Middletown, Guernsey County, Ohio, where his daughter, Ionia, was   born.    I would like some help interpreting that passage, in light of the following facts.  As far as I can tell, the lineage here is Sir William, William, Ebenezer, William, Ebenezer, Ionia.  It is my hypothesis that the first Ebenezer listed here is my Ebenezer, but that is not really relevant for the rest of the question.  It is a fact (as much as is possible) that Ann Price and William Blackstone married in 1808.  (from ancestry.com)  Public trees there have William being born in 1787.  It is also a fact that Sir William married Sarah Clitherow about 1760 and had a number of children including two named William.  The first, born in 1762, died as a child, and the second, born in 1769, survived until adulthood.  There are also public trees on ancestry.com that indicate a son William by a previous marriage (to Margaret Smith) born in 1756.  It seems unlikely that any of these children could have had a grandchild born in 1787, as the passage implies.  I have not been able to locate any additional biographical information that would indicate that Sir William had any sons before 1756.  Since he is a relatively famous personage, I would assume that his children would be well documented.  So what is the best way to reconcile/verify the claims made in this passage?  I have not been able to track anything else down on ancestry.com.  The public trees there are fairly prone to error in any case.  The SAR/DAR websites are not helpful here as the immigration occurred after the Revolutionary War.  I have other evidence that indicates that the immigration probably occurred in 1799, but nothing shows up on ancestry.com -- are there other, better, sources of immigration information?  Basically, I have hit a brick wall and would like some additional resources to check.  So after this preamble, I guess my question is the following.  If we assume the lineage Sir William, William, Ebenezer, William, Ebenezer, Ionia is correct, what can we say about the birthdates of these people given that Sir William is well documented as having lived from 1723-1780 and the last William married in 1808?  I am interested both in determining the birthdates of the people listed here and in learning about the resources available for answering such questions.  I will add a separate question for the immigration issue, as it is not the focus of this question. "
914,"Is ""Incain"" an old spelling of insane?","This bishop's transcript  shows cause of death, which is quite illuminating especially the number that are just listed as ""decline"". The record at number 49, of William Towler, has cause of death listed as ""Incain"". Or at least that's what I think it says.  Could it mean ""insane""? Or have I missed something? "
915,What would Captain Richard Boyens do as Toller to Duke of Leeds in Cornwall?,"In another recent question (Is there Index to Cornish Mining Captains that might include Richard Boyens (1750-1838)?) I referred to my 5th great grandfather Richard Boyens (sometimes spelled Boyns) who I believe to have been a Mining Captain at St Just in Penwith, Cornwall.  This link refers to him dying in the house of my 4th great grandfather:  “DEATHS … On Saturday, the 24th [Feb 1838], at the house of his son-in-law, Mr. Joseph Billin, mercer and draper, Helston, Capt. Richard Boyens, formerly of St. Just in Penwith, aged 88 years, for 40 of which he held the situation of toller to the Duke of Leeds. Throughout a long life, he bore a character pre-eminently distinguished for uprightness and integrity.”  I am curious as to what work a ""toller"" would do?  In particular, would it have been a job requiring someone to be full-time (i.e. after retiring as a Mining Captain) or would it have been something that could be done in tandem with what I imagine would be a full-time job as a Mining Captain? "
916,Inferring father/son relationships from Senior (Sr.) / Junior (Jr.) naming?,"As in my other questions, I am investigating the spread of the Blackstone family name in early America. I came across the following tidbits and I would like to know if my interpretation is (likely to be) correct.  In the ""All Kent County, Delaware Probate Records, 1680-1800"" collection on ancestry.com, we have the following items.   In 1792, there was a will executed by Eben Blackiston, Sr. In 1794, there was a will executed by Ebenezer Blackiston, Jr. (and Abraham Redgrave).   My question is simple.  Is this enough evidence to reasonably conclude that there was a father/son combo of Ebenezer Blackistons living in Kent County, Delaware during the 1790s?  This would be an interesting result for me as my current research only has two people by this name in the state at the time, and none of them were part of a Jr./Sr. combination.  If this is not enough evidence, what are some other possibilities I need to consider? "
917,Finding records from the 'manor house',"I have an 1881 Census record for one of my research subjects where he appears as a servant at the local Manor house.    Mark Herber's Ancestral Trails has a section on finding manor house records which is very thorough (obviously) so I have many ideas about where to search.  My question is -- when doing a house history, what information would be useful to have in hand before I begin to search all the archives suggested by Herber?  My preliminary research plan includes   Descendancy research for the head of household in the 1881 Census  A search of the British Newspaper Archives for notes about property transfers A search of historical directories for the house's name and a timeline of its tenants ???   From prior reading, I already know that this particular family line dies out; the last male of the family was killed in the First World War and is in the village's Roll of Honor.    I don't expect any of the manor house records to be of genealogical interest for the servant's families -- to have them identified as '[name] son of [father]' is a lot to ask -- but if I could get records about how many servants were employed by the house at various times, it would be good for context, and if records turned up which actually listed when people were hired and let go, that would be a great 'lucky dip'.    Suggestions and commentary from your own experiences are welcome, including what search terms were useful when searching archives' catalogs for named house records.  For those who can't resist working the problem, here's the census record in question at Family Search:        Household  Role    Gender  Age     Birthplace    Eliza Bastard  Head    F   75      Slapton, Devon, England    Sarah Bastard  Daughter    F   44  Slapton, Devon, England    Charlotte Randall  Servant     F   26  Stokenham, Devon, England    Arthur Knowles     Servant     M   18  Slapton, Devon, England   Name:  Arthur Knowles    Age (Original):    18    Gender:    Male    Birth Year:    1863    Birthplace:    Slapton, Devon, England    Relationship to Head of Household:     Servant    Marital Status:    Single    Occupation:    General Servant    Address:   Prospect House    Event Place:   Slapton, Devonshire,  England    Record Type:   Household    Affiliate Publication Number:  RG11 Piece/Folio:   2180 / 67 Page Number:  3      Edited to add: it may also be useful, or more useful, to have records about the tenants. The 1881 Census is the only record so far where I have an explicit association between Arthur Knowles and the Bastard family.  Arthur's occupation in 1891 is 'thatcher', so if they owned thatched cottages they might have been his employer.  In a later census (1911) he lists his occupation as ""Jobbing Gardener"".  (In 1901 on Census Day, Arthur and his family are in the USA, so there is no 1901 Census record.)    Morris and Co.'s Commercial Directory and Gazetteer (1870) lists under 'Clergy and Gentry':     Bastard Richard, Esq., Prospect house   Other census records in Slapton with Eliza Bastard born 1805:   1841 Census at Pool House, with husband Richard 1851 Census at Poole House, with husband Richard 1861 Census at Prospect House, with husband Richard 1871 Census at Prospect House, with husband Richard 1891 Census at Prospect House   In the 1901 Census Mary Bastard is head of household at Prospect House; sister Sarah is still in residence.  In the 1911 Census Sarah is head of household at Prospect House.    The larger question of ""where might I find a 'lucky dip' apart from newspaper records is perhaps better as a chat topic.  "
918,Am I related to this family?,"I have a puzzling genealogical question, but first you must be prefaced.  My family tree contains two half-siblings. (Google ""half-sibling family tree"" to see what I mean.)  Now my half siblings and I share the same mother. My father's last name is Smith and my half-brother's father's last name is Jones  In what ways am I related to the Jones?  For example, am I related to my half-brother's father, because I am related to his son, who is obviously related to him?  To clarify, my mother never married with one of the Smiths, only with the Jones. This is why I used the terms ""marriage"" and then ""relationship"", respectively.   Basically, my relation to the Jones' only extends to my half-brother, anything afterwards, and the relation dissolves or isn't present? "
919,How can I establish an early 19th century birthplace?,"I have been investigating my ancestor, Vestus/Sylvester Blackstone with a goal of getting an accurate timeline for some of the major events in his life.  I am trying to resolve a number of contradictions, and in particular I would like to figure out where he was born.  The Daughters of the American Revolution has a nice database online.  Sylvester is found in the DAR descendants database with the following information:     Sylvester Blackstone born on (c) - - 1812 at PA   died at Fairfield Co OH on 9 - Nov - 1854 and his  ( 1st ) wife   Matilda A White born on (c) - - 1818 at VA   died at Fairfield Co OH on (p) - - 1850 married on 7 - Dec - 1837    The wife, marriage date and death date match up nicely with my ancestor Vestus, which is why I believe that they are the same person.  This also matches nicely with this gravesite which gives the name Vestus and the same death date.  A number of Vestus' children were alive for the 1880 US Census which asked for the father's birthplace as one of their questions.  All the children that I've located in that census given Vestus' birthplace as Ohio.  Vestus' birthdate is also hard to pin down, but for the purposes of this question you may assume that it is between 1809 and 1812.    I have not thus far been able to locate any sort of official record of his birth on ancestry.com.  It may be there, but I've not found it though I've done some extensive wildcard based searches.  Given that, and given that I would like to establish his birthplace, what are some other resources I should consider?  Note: Those of you who recognize my name may remember that there is some evidence of the Blackstones of this era being Quakers.  I've not been able to find anything there, either. "
920,Were British Army families stationed overseas enumerated in any Census returns?,"I have located a record for Alfred Clarke in the United Kingdom, Chelsea Pensioners' Service Records.  The TNA record series number is WO 97, and the original images are available at Find My Past.  Seven images are available on Find My Past for this service member, a four-page bound folder/jacket with his attestations and discharge information, plus three loose sheets with pay information and other details of his military career.    Alfred's records state that he was born around 1840 in Brighton, Sussex, England.  His date of attestation is 26 August 1858; he served with the Royal Artillery, and was discharged on 2 August 1881.  He married Emily Knowles on 24 January 1869 in Woolwich (where the Royal Artillery's headquarters was located).   One of the loose sheets, with a heading MILITARY HISTORY SHEET, has an outline of his service:        Home 26 August 1858  to 6 April 1860    China 7 April 1860  to 9 May 1861   Home  10 May 1861  to 8 February 1875   India 9 February 1875 to 11 May 1881   Home 12 May 1881 to 2 Aug 1881      These are the Census Days for the period under study:        1861:  7 April   1871:  2 April   1881:  3 April      In 1861 Alfred is single, serving in China.    In 1871, he is serving at ""Home"", presumably somewhere within the British Isles.  Wife Emily is enumerated in her father's household in Slapton in South Devon, along with son Alfred age 1, born in County Cork, Ireland.  (Emily's age is slightly off, so son Alfred's age may not be accurate either.  Alfred (the father) did spend some time in Ireland; he passed a course in Equitation at Dublin from January to March 1870.)  In 1881, Alfred is either in India, or on his way back from India.  I can infer that Emily was with him for some of his service there, because I have baptism records for sons Walter Thomas (born 24 Aug 1875, baptised 28 Sep 1875 at Camp Ahmedabad) and Frederick Richard (born 24 May 1880, baptised 6 Jun 1880 at Camp Belgaum).  Their baptism records show that Alfred had been appointed Sergeant Major for his battery.  I have not been able to find any other records for son Alfred except for the 1871 Census.  It would be useful to find other records with the whole family while Alfred was still under age.  Were military families like the Clarkes, who were stationed overseas, enumerated in 1881?      Since writing the question, I have found more records which I think may belong to this family, so I will post a quick update.  The National School Admission Registers &amp; Log-Books 1870-1914 on Find My Past contained an admissions entry for three Clarke children who came from India.  These records include birth dates for the children, and often indicate what schools the children have transferred from.  All three are on the same register page, on three consecutive lines, with an admissions date of 12 Sep 1881 (and an exit date of 23 Dec 1881).  All three have as their father's name Alfred Clarke.  The middle child (in age), a girl born in 1872, was previously unknown to me, but the other two are Alfred Robert (born 23 October 1869) and Walter Thomas (born 24 Aug 1875).   I will be cross-checking the information in the school register against the The GRO Regimental Birth Indices Supplement (1761 to 1924) on Find My Past which includes registrations from the British nationals armed forces births 1761-2005, and the Ireland Births and Baptisms on FamilySearch.org, and other vital records information, to fill out the timeline for the family.   "
921,Interpreting tours of duty on British Army service records?,"More details about this service member are in my question Were British Army families stationed overseas enumerated in any Census returns?   Alfred Clarke, b. 1840, from Brighton, Sussex, England, service No. 178/2, served in the Royal Artillery, as shown in his entry from the Chelsea Pensioners British Army Service Records 1760-1913, images accessed on Find My Past.   One of the loose sheets, with a heading MILITARY HISTORY SHEET, has an outline of his service:        Home 26 August 1858 to 6 April 1860   China 7 April 1860 to 9 May 1861   Home 10 May 1861 to 8 February 1875   India 9 February 1875 to 11 May 1881   Home 12 May 1881 to 2 Aug 1881      I would like to know the British Army's custom for entering these dates.  Does the 11 May 1881 end date for his India service mean that his unit departed from India in May, or does it indicate their arrival in England?  When Alfred's unit was assigned to China service, does the 7 April 1860 start date reflect the date the unit left the UK for China, the date the unit arrived in China, or something else?  It seems likely that the date could reflect the effective date of the orders for the unit.  If I investigate the records of the Royal Artillery, might I be able to find those orders?    My research 'to do' list includes   transcribing the loose sheets in Alfred's records, which list his promotions and other events in his military career, with an eye toward recording which smaller sub-unit of the RA he was assigned to (compiling a version of the List of Royal Artillery Batteries for his time period) cross-checking that data against Stations of the Royal Artillery in India and other data from The Nafziger Collection of Orders of Battle making a list of the places the RA were stationed during his enlistment, and finding the location of the barracks, to help in searching other record collections e.g. the 1871 Census. searching in the British Newspaper Archives reviewing Herber's Ancestral Trails for clues about other records to search on the book wishlist: My Ancestor was in the British Army from the Society of Genealogists     Update to the research plan:  Find My Past has GRO Regimental Birth Indices (1761 to 1924) consisting of:   British Nationals Armed Forces Births 1761-2005 British Nationals Armed Forces Marriages 1761-2005 British Nationals Armed Forces Deaths 1761-2005   As well as the usual Volume and page reference you'd expect for a GRO index, these list the regiment, which is extremely useful for sorting out same-name military dependents.  If your service member is on Home duty and has school age children, you may be able to find some of them in the National School Admission Registers &amp; Log-Books 1870-1914.  I am currently cross-checking the birth dates from one of these registers against the GRO Regimental indexes and Ireland Birth and Baptisms information on Family Search, to cross-check against Alfred's list of postings.

922,Using a card index to find Probate records?,"Since I asked the question about working with unindexed probate records, I have located some card indexes for administrations in Queens County New York online (as images which can be browsed) and one record of interest is here:      ""New York, Probate Records, 1629-1971,"" images, FamilySearch   ([website]  : accessed 30 Jul 2014), Queens > General card index 1900-1987 Kinna,   Florence May-Koenig, Evelyn E. > image 931 of 6104.   This is a rough transcription of the card:     KISPERT, Pauline       317-1902      (Ad) 6-17-1902       6-8-1902   College Point   This is an administration for Pauline Kispert who died in College Point, Queens County, New York.  I have several newspapers from the Brooklyn Daily Eagle and other Brooklyn newspapers -- an obituary, court calendar entries, news items about the administration of her estate, and the dispute about her estate between Pauline's husband Edward Kispert and her brother Charles R. Herre.    Since there are multiple instances in the newspaper about the administration of her estate, I didn't know what to expect if I found an index.  But I am assuming that the Court would attempt to keep all the papers relating to her estate in a single file.  I have looked at the first roll in this series of microfilm rolls, but I don't see a card with a legend explaining what these entries are.  The apparent dates are American style (m-dd-yyyy).    The bottom line ""6-8-1902 College Point"" is her place and date of death (it agrees with Ancestry's online index [New York City, Deaths, 1892-1902; online index, Ancestry.com] and articles in the papers).   (Ad) probably refers to an administration, since I know from the newspaper accounts that her husband was granted letters of administration.  So presumably the ""(Ad) 6-17-1902"" refers to his petition to the court?  This would be the right time period, since the newspaper articles say that he was granted the letters of administration around 25 Jun 1902.  I've navigated to what I thought might be the correct file:      ""New York, Probate Records, 1629-1971,"" Queens > Letters of   administration 1898-1903 vol Y-AA   Pauline's record is here:     ""New York, Probate Records, 1629-1971,"" images, FamilySearch   ([website]  vol Y-AA > image 889 of 1210.   This is definitely a record about the people I am looking for.  Note the handwritten note at the top of the page that the letters were revoked in October 1903.  The name of the Surrogate at the bottom of the grants is the same name as I found in the newspaper articles.    But what is this mysterious number 317-1902 from the index card?  It is not the page number of this grant -- the printed number in this volume at the top of the page is 386.   Might it be a pointer to a box or file #317 for the packet of loose papers about the estate, and the reason I'm not seeing it yet is that the films are not yet online?  I did see a note in one of the wiki articles that the Queens County Probate records were not online, so perhaps that was referring to the probate packets themselves and not these bound volumes.  Any tips or a pointer to a 'how to use the index' document would be appreciated.

924,Could an Ohio resident be in the Indiana militia? (Timeline resolution),"It is part of my family's tradition that a particular ancestor of mine was a participant in the Battle of Tippecanoe, on November 19, 1811, but I am having a little trouble confirming it.  Here are the pertinent facts from the time period...  Notes: My ancestors are named Ebenezer Blackstone and Sophia White.  Sophia's father's name was John.  Their first child was named Vestus.  I will try to source most of the information below, but for the purposes of this question you may assume it is accurate.     1803 : John appears in Waterford Township, Washington County, Ohio in a census.      1810 : In January, Ebenezer and Sophia marry in Marietta, Ohio (close to the wife's family).      1810 : The newlyweds do not appear in the federal census.  In particular, they did not settle in Marietta as the census records survived for that county.  The rest of Ohio was lost, as was Indiana though not Pennsylvania.      1810 : John White is not listed as living in Waterford Township.  In addition, there is some unsubstantiated lore that he moved to Athens county at some time.  Perhaps it happened between 1803 and 1810 as this would explain the lack of census data for him.      1811 : (November).  Someone with my ancestor's name participates in the Battle of Tippecanoe in Indiana.  The strange thing is that the soldier was actually a member of  a company of infantry of the Indiana Militia.        1812 : (January) Vestus is born, likely in Pennsylvania, but possibly in Ohio.  (Sources differ here, though Vestus answered PA for the 1840 Census, so that seems most authoratative to me.)      1816 : By this time the family is reunited and is back in Ohio, in Athens County.  A couple more kids have been born, though one likely died quite young.   The big stumbling block for me is the fact that the participant in the battle was in the Indiana Militia, and it seems unlikely to me that the newlyweds settled in Indiana at any time.  It is another documented fact that some groups of soldiers stopped in Marietta on their way to the Indiana Territory where they were going to end up in the battle, so I was thinking that my ancestor could have joined them at that time (and letting his pregnant wife stay with family in PA) but if that were the case then would it even be possible for him to end up in the Indiana Militia?  On the other hand, I've tracked everyone I can identify that shared a name with my ancestor, and I cannot identify the battle participant with any of them easily.  I guess if I had to boil this down to one question it would be : Under what circumstances, if any, could a resident of Ohio end up in the Indiana Militia in the year 1811?  Summarizing some of the comments...    For Sophia and Ebenezer to be ""missing"" in the 1810 census one of two things is true.  Either they were living with another family and Ebenezer was not the head of household, or they settled in an area where the census data was lost.  This could be Ohio (outside of Washington County) or Indiana.  To accept an answer for this question (though the discussion has been quite fruitful for me) I would like to see some authoritative evidence one way or another as to whether the Indiana Militia had members who were not residents of Indiana, as I think it most likely that my family did not settle in Indiana before coming back to Ohio.  The population counts seem to indicate that there were probably non-Hoosiers in the militia, for if not then 5% of the male population of the state would have been involved in the battle.  Still, I'd like something a little more authoritative. "
925,Getting started in Irish research?,"A friend's wife has started to research her family history, and has fallen at the first hurdle: one of her ancestors is Irish (born circa 1865 and died in Omagh, Northern Ireland in 1948 -- there's a rumour of a church window dedicated to her in a local Presbyterian Church in 1950).  What are the basic steps for getting started in (Northern) Irish (Protestant) genealogy? What are the key resources that can be searched online for this period?    "
926,Determining parents of 19th Century Swiss ancestor?,"I started getting into genealogy thanks to Ancestry.com and I have run into a brick wall. I am looking for the parents of Christopher Stukey (born somewhere between 1843 and 1848 in Switzerland) his wife is Cornelia Williams, born 1848. He eventually settled and died in Lewis County, NY. The area of Switzerland he was born in that I have found online was listed as ""Lauraine, Switzerland"" which I have looked for and can't seem to find anywhere. I am just very curious as to who his parents were and how far back I can find this, as this is where my last name, ""Stukey"" comes from.  Any help would be appreciated greatly, thank you.  Here is (sadly) the most descriptive thing I have found as far as Lauraine... [website]"
927,Finding late 1930's ship departures from the Port of San Francisco?,"I have been able to locate arrival records from Europe to the United States but have not been able to have success with the reverse. My grandfather and his mother returned back to Europe soon after arrival into San Francisco but I have not been able to locate a record. In order to narrow my search, is there an index of passenger ships embarking from San Francisco, CA to Germany / Czechoslovakia between 1936 and 1943?   Context:   My grandfather arrived to San Francisco, CA by ship from Zwodau, Czechoslovakia as a toddler with his mother (Gertrude Unger, maiden name: Posselt or Possolt) on July 23, 1936 aboard the M/S Seattle [1]. She was coming to meet and marry her fiancé Rudolf Stach [2] which she did on July 30, 1936 [4]. Family lore says that my great great grandmother Barbara Stachova (Rudolf's mother) was not happy when she learned he had married an already divorced woman with child and secretly sent Gerdi and young son away by train. However, we never had contact with that side of the family and are trying to figure out what really happened.   My grandfather and his mother did not return to the USA until 1952 at which point he finished his last year of high school, married my grandmother and joined the US military. My grandfather said that his grandfather Otto Possolt raised him and he was very unhappy to leave him and come to the US.

928,Reading Finnish Parish Records," I believe this is the birth record of Kasia Fredrika Tormanen B: 15 JUN 1858, D: 17 SEP 1900 in Kemi, Finland.    I am finding it very difficult to read and translate the writing on this page. Although the parish is in Finland, the months are written in Swedish. I cannot read the headings along the top of the page and I am not sure if the body of the text is also written in Swedish or Finnish. Kasia is supposed to have been born in Kemi on June 15th; I can see ""Juni"" and I can see ""15"", but what does the number 18 refer to? Also, what do the numbers along the right-hand columns refer to?    From what I can decipher, the text reads:     ""Torparen (crofter?) Josef Johansson Tormanens &amp; hsn Anna Greta Matts   drs barn: Caisa Fredrika. Faddr: Pehr Majala oned ksn Greta Mathil da;   Matts Tormanen med hrn Anna Lisa; mngk. Pehr Pelts och jhr Sofia   Lillia. af G.W. Appelgren.""     There are so many names in here, which ones are the parents? Are the others witnesses or grandparents?      Also, Kaisa married Matti Laho, B: 13 MAR 1853, D: 6 NOV 1901. I am finding this record even harder to read that the previous one. I think that I can see ""Laho"" in there, but maybe it is just wishful thinking? The date is right. I'm not certain that he was born in Kemi, but it would make sense given that they eventually married. Can anyone decipher this? I have linked both individuals to the digital scans of the records held by The National Archives Service of Finland so that you can see the full page of handwriting. "
929,How to transfer data between different versions of gramps?,"Using Gramps on Linux and Windows is causing problems with sharing the same data. Windows is on version 3.4.8 but Linux on 3.4.0. Data exported from Windows does not import into 3.4.0 on Linux. How can share data across when using different versions? Even if versions are the same at some stage, they will fall apart again. Are there conversion tools available, or a more suitable data format for this purpose? I tried GEDCOM but all the media links are lost. "
930,Finding evidence for divorce of Hugh Sillars and Agnes Macculloch in mid-19th Century Scotland?,"This question involves some of the same family as an earlier question of mine (Finding New York City/State records relating to Sellars family (British subjects) births/deaths mid 19th century?) but is intended to be standalone.  My 4th great grandparents Hugh Sillars and Agnes Macculloch were married on 15 Aug 1830 at Irvine, Ayrshire, Scotland.    Hugh and Agnes had five children:   Robert Sillars born 15 Oct 1830, and christened 7 Nov 1830 at Dundonald, Ayrshire, Scotland with parents Hugh Sillars and Agnes Mcculloch Agnes Sillars born 13 Apr 1833, and christened 28 Apr 1833 at Dundonald, Ayrshire, with parents Hugh Sillars and Agnes Mccully  Hugh Sellars born 03 May 1835 at Govan, Lanarkshire, Scotland with parents Hugh Sellars and Agnes Mcculloch Jane Cowan Sellars born 28 Dec 1836 at Govan, Lanarkshire, Scotland with parents Hugh Sellars and Agnes Mcculloch  Margaret Sellars born 21 Feb 1844 at Glasgow, Lanarkshire, Scotland with parents Hugh Sellars and Agnes Mcculloch   I see the family in the 1841 Scotland Census where Hugh Sillars 37 born about 1804, an S Carp J [which I think is short for a Ship Carpenter Journeyman], is living at Slip Dock, Barony, Lanarkshire, Scotland with his wife Agnes Sillars 30 and children Robert Sillars 9, Agnes Sillars 8 and Hugh Sillars 6.  The 1844 christening is the last time I see the names of Hugh Sellars and Agnes Macculloch linked in a record and I suspect that they may have divorced.    To support my theory that their marriage foundered I have three pieces of evidence:   Agnes Macculloch marries Robert Thomson on 16 Nov 1846 at Dundonald, Ayrshire, Scotland The 1855 New York State Census finds Hugh Sellars 52, Ship Carpenter, born in Scotland, living at Albany City, Ward 6, Albany, New York, USA with his wife Mary Sellars 50 (born in England) and four others Harriet Martin 32 Moody M Hale 54 Elizabeth A Hale 18 and Elick Crawford 26 The 1865 New York State Census finds Hugh Sellars 60, Ship Carpenter, born in Scotland, living at Albany City, Ward 6, Albany, New York, USA with his wife Mary Sellars 60 (born in England) and two others: William H Hall, aged 8, recorded as Hugh's son (?) and Caroline R Foster, aged 7, a Boarder.  Both Hugh and Mary are recorded as having been married twice.   All was not settled on the work front for Hugh either because on 5 Apr 1848 he applied for a form of bankruptcy called Cessio Bonorum as both a partner of H. Sellars and Co, and as an individual.  This suggests why emigration to the U.S.A. may have appealed to him.  If I have surmised correctly above, where would I look for a record of the divorce? I am also interested to know whether any alternative theory of ""double bigamy"" would have any credibility in that time and place? "
931,Resolving conflicts between conclusions of different researchers (internet & professional historian)?,"One of my ancestors was named John White.  He was a very early settler of Ohio, marrying Priscilla Devol in 1790 when Ohio was still part of the Northwest Territory.  Here is a timeline with some relevant (and undisputed) facts...     1758 : John is born on October 20 in Pomfret, Connecticut      1778-1780 : John served in the Revolutionary War.      1789? : John arrives in the Northwest Territory.      1790 : John marries Priscilla Devol in Marietta.      1791 : John and wife are living in Fort Frye Garrison.      1791 : Sophia White is born in Marietta.   It is interesting (to me at least) that there is a fundamental question about this reasonably well documented man.  Who are his parents?  If one listens to the wisdom of the internet, as exhibited by the good people of ancestry.com, his parents were a couple named Jacob White and Dinah Cutler.  In fact, in the public trees where John and his parents appear, there is a single exception (which will be described quite soon) who does not list this couple as his parents.  The single exception is a tree I submitted that is based on the work Genealogical and Personal History of the Upper Monongahela Valley, Volume 3 by the professional historian, James Morton Callahan.  In this book, we have the following snippet...    Further along it becomes quite clear that John (4) is the John White we are interested in.  It mentioned his marriage to Priscilla Devol and Sophia being born.  However the parents of John given here are John (3) and Unknown.    Normally, when faced with a choice between a professional and the internet, I'd go with the professional every time.  Indeed, after digging a little further we get a little more insight.  The Barbour Collection of Connecticut Town Birth Records (pre-1870) lists a John White being born in Pomfret to Jacob and Dinah, but on October 21, 1762, not October 20, 1758.  Given that the 1758 is clearly legible on our John White's gravestone, and that John White is a common enough name that even a small town can have two of them born a few years apart, my guess is that the historian is right, but I'd like to hear other opinions on this.  Boiling this down to one question...  Given all of the information posted, should I go with the professional or with the internet?  Update: Here's a summary of the facts I have.   The Barbour Collection contains a record of a John White being born to Jacob White and Dinah Cutler in Pomfret, CT on October 21, 1762. The same collection contains no records of a John White being born in Pomfret on October 20, 1758.  (Subquestion : How complete are these records for that time period?  This is rhetorical and not meant to be answered here...) John White was a Revolutionary Soldier.  (Rhetorical subquestions: Would a teenager have been allowed to participate in the war?  Could he have changed his stated birthday in order to join the army?) John White had an ""uncle"" named Amos Grosvenor.  The Barbour Collection has an Amos from Pomfret marrying a Mary Hutchins in 1755 (and no other marriages for said Amos).  If he is really John's uncle, this would seem to eliminate the Jacob/Dinah possibility.   All in all, I think the best way to resolve this would be to investigate the Amos Grosvenor link more thoroughly.     "

933,How do I record names involving adoptions in a family tree?,"My grandfather's second wife had three children from her previous marriage.  After they married, my grandfather legally adopted her children, which changed their last names.  When I record the children in my family tree software (or in my online tree) I am able to show the adoption, and so the children show up under their biological father, as well as under my grandfather, but I'm only able to have their last name displayed one way.  What is really the best way to record the last names of these children so I can research them when they still lived with their biological father, as well as once they were adopted by my grandfather?  Should I include both last names in the ""last name"" field? "

938,What are the ethics rules for recording information on living persons on online genealogy sites?,"   Possible Duplicate:   What information should or can I publish to a web site?       One concern I have with recording information about LIVING persons on sites like Ancestry.ca, the site I use, is that nothing I record should be accessible to anyone who is going to use the information for identity-theft, or phishing schemes (""Help, I'm your uncle Dave in Nigeria, and I'm trapped, can you send me some money?"").    Are there OTHER ethical concerns than identity theft, or phishing, that must be considered when recording information about people who are still alive, and including them in family-tree diagrams and databases that could be accessed online?   Ethical concerns might mean I should limit strictly what information is recorded, including perhaps, that one should not record the current residential addresses of persons still living, in case the online databases of sites like Ancestry.ca were to be hacked.  The rules that a professional or a very-conscientious amateur would follow, are what I want to know.  Update Similar question here asks what is legal or okay to publish and is very similar.  My question is different in that I am wondering if there are other things that it is not ethical to RECORD for living persons. I agree that they are similar, but maybe not duplicates.  Maybe there's no difference, so if this is closed as duplicate I'm okay with that. My intention is not to share publically ANY of this information, but rather to just record it. But the recording that I make online must not be usable by identity-theft people, so for instance, full birth date would be recorded, and perhaps NOT any current address, email or phone numbers. "
939,Birth record for Illinois or Michigan birth in 1881?,"I am having trouble locating a reliable birth record for a person in my tree. According to the 1900 census record, a certain Mollie Goetz/Getz was born in Feb 1881 in Illinois.       ""United States Census, 1900,"" index and images, FamilySearch ([website]Her parents were married in Van Buren, Michigan on 18 May 1880.

However, I have not been able to find a reliable birth record for Mollie either in Michigan or in Illinois. Obviously, I don't have a 1890 census to check where the family was at the time, but a person matching the name and occupation of the 1900 census entry (Henry Goetz, cutter) is listed in the 1882 Chicago city directory on Ancestry.com.    I have checked the Illinois birth index and the Michigan birth index, both of which cover the right date range, and found nothing probable. I have tried all sorts of variations of spelling for the Goetz name and for Mollie, and tried searching on dates alone. Nothing comes up.   What should I try next? "
940,Seeking copy of 19th century South African birth certificate?,"I'm trying to find the birth certificate of my wife's great grandmother who was probably born in Durban, South Africa in 1884.

941,"What did it mean to come of age in 1684 at Saco (now Maine, USA)?","John Presbury died 1679 of Saco, now Maine, USA, but then Massachusetts Bay Colony. John left minor sons including William Presbury. John's estate was administered by others until his son, William, ""came of age"" in 1684; at that time administration of the estate was relinquished to the son.   The various information above and other bits of family history was originally derived from Sybil Noyes, Charles Thornton Libby and Walter Goodwin Davis, Genealogical Dictionary of Maine and New Hampshire (Portland, ME, USA: The Southward Press, 1928), p. 567-568, entries for John Presbury and William Presbury.    Although I have located many of the records from which Libby and others worked from, the record of John Presbury's probate file remains elusive, more because I seem to seek it when work is in process on the collections and/or archives. There is a fair chance that when I do locate the probate record, it will provide the same information that Libby did regarding William Presbury's age--he was granted administrator's rights because he had ""come of age.""   I'd really like a better understanding of how old William Presbury was in 1684 when he ""came of age"".   What resource would provide insight into the laws and customs of this region in the late 17th century as same pertains to age of majority and the administration of an estate?   Even better, can someone answer the question of what ""coming of age"" meant in the context of estate administration at Saco in 1684?  "
942,When and Why Did Juniors Stop Being Promoted to Seniors?,"My name is T. Wetmore IV. My father, grandfather and great grandfather had the names you might expect, and specifically my grandfather was named T. Wetmore Jr. I found an inscription in a book given to my grandfather that read, ""To my grand nephew Thomas Trask Wetmore, third, from Aunt Myra Jane Denby, Montclair, N J, November 30th 1899."" I found this early in my genealogical ""career"" and it confused me greatly. I knew the book was a gift to my grandfather, but who was Aunt Myra and why did she call him the ""third""? I eventually figured it out -- when my grandfather was given the book, he had a living great uncle also named T. Wetmore, so he was the youngest of three living T. Wetmores. Myra was a half sister of this great uncle. When his great uncle died my grandfather ""shifted"" from being the third to being ""junior."" By the rules that seemed to have applied at the time, I should now be T. Wetmore Sr. and my son T. Wetmore Jr., yet we call him T. Wetmore V.  It seems that in the past there were different rules for suffixes like Jr., Sr., III, IV. When someone died the younger ones got ""promoted"" one level higher in list. This doesn't happen any more.  Does anyone know when or why the ""rule"" changed? Or was there never a rule and different families just used different practices? Kings and Popes have always kept their ""numbers,"" but apparantly we common folk haven't always until recently.  Note especially that in the case described here the three T. Wetmores were not even in a direct line; they were simply three living and related men with the same name. "
943,"Why are scanning devices (such as FlipPal) allowed in some archives, but not in others?","The American National Archives and Library of Congress both allow the scanning of documents with some scanners (see what's allowed and what's not). FlipPal is one of their approved ones. Lorine McGinnis Schulze has also had great success doing personal scanning at her local archives (Olive Tree Genealogy blog). I've recently purchased a FlipPal and love it for home use, but now I want to start bringing it along on my research trips to repositories and am intimidated by the many organizations that have a blanket rule ""No Scanning.""  Is there something that the National Archives knows that others don't? Wouldn't they be one of the best judges of whether something is harmful to the records or not? Or, are they just weighing out the benefits vs. risks with letting people use these scanners... Like, increased access to records in exchange for the risk of some damage accruing to the record? "
944,Finding New York birth record from around 1804?,"My 3rd great grandfather, Charles James Sanderson, was born around 1804 in New York according to the 1851 and 1861 England Census (and some other references I've been able to find).  The earliest record I am able to find of him is his first marriage, in 1825, in England.  I am able to trace most of his life in England, including his second marriage, the birth of his 12 children, his will, found in the London Archives, through to his death and burial in London, England in 1866.  What I have not been able to figure out are the names of his parents, his place of birth, and his date of birth, or when he left New York and arrived in England.  Does anyone have a suggestion on where I might look to find Charles' record of birth (since I don't know if he was born in New York City or simply New York State)?  How I might discover the names of his parents? "
945,Case for seeking quotation to digitize Greenwich Hospital School admission record of John Smyth in about 1755?,"My 4th great grandfather John Smyth was a Captain's Clerk on the HMS Firm when he married Sarah Osment on 13 Jul 1764 at Stoke Damerel, Devon, England.  When he was buried at Bunhill Fields Burial Ground (London, England) on 23 Jan 1806, his age was given as 66 which suggests that he was born about 1740.  In the National Archives I have found a record that I suspect may belong to him:     Reference: ADM 73/347/31        Description: John Smyth. When admitted to Greenwich Hospital School:   Not stated.   Parents' names: Jeremiah and Mary Smyth.   Applicant baptised 7 May 1741 in Oxwich, County Glamorgan.    Date: 1728-1870        Held by: The National Archives, Kew        Physical description: 6 document(s)     The same page states:     This record has not been digitised and cannot be downloaded.  Request   a quotation for a copy to be digitised or printed and sent to you.   I am holding off on asking for that quotation while I try to be more sure that it is the correct John Smyth but if it is then the above documents could be something of a ""treasure trove"" for me because I found a Greenwich Hospital School admission documents set described at SOG-UK-L Archives as being:     Later my 3x gt grandfather applied for 4 of his children to enter the   Royal Hospital, Greenwich, as it was called by then. These   application records were in ADM64 (1830s).      Both sets of records included a lot of information including in my 3   x gt grandfather's application a baptismal certificate for him as   well as his parent's marriage certficate (remember this was 1808).      All records included details of the father's service up to the time   of application including all ships they served on with beginning and   end dates. In the case of the ones from the 1830s it also had the   names of all other children in the family.      From memory they were in alphabetical order, folded likes wills and piled   into boxes.   After serving on the HMS Firm I have been able to find records that John worked in three inter-related government offices (Sick and Hurt Office, Transport Office and Prisoners of War Department) from at least 1775 until his death in 1806 - see  Finding records of Transport-office that John Smyth worked for in London prior to 1806?  These all seem to be related to the Navy.  I think my next step is to get a quotation for the contents of ADM 73/347/31 to be digitised but I am wondering if I have missed taking any obvious steps to establish the identity of my ancestor with this John Smyth first?  I am very confident of my line to John Smyth who left an 1806 Will naming my 3rd great grandparents John Stacy and Sarah Osment Smyth. "
946,Where is the Friedrichsbruch near Kokotzko in West Prussia / Poland?,"I hoping to clarify where exactly Friedrichsburg / Friedrichsbruch or perhaps a similar variant immediately close to Kokotzko Poland.  Per this document there were about 21 different variants of Friedrichsburg / Friedrichsbruch in Prussia.  I found in other records references and looking at some other individuals' trees that indicate Kokotzko, Culm, West Prussia as well which from the maps appears to be the same area of today's Poland almost on the Baltic Sea.     I see some people in their trees identify it on their map as the Fredricksburg near Brandenburg or Lower Saxony and list the country as Germany; which I do not believe aligns with the records themselves nor my particular chronology.   This record from the above links has helped narrow my search:  Town|Pr| Kreis (district)|Protestant Parish|Catholic Parish|Civil Records Office  Friedrichsbruch|West Prussia|Culm|Kokotzko|Unislaw|Friedrichsbruch  and I have found via a couple sources that Culm is now Chelmno and there is a Kockcko in the immediate vicinity between Chelmno and Unislaw but no Friedrichsbruch.   My specific records for the individual I am researching specifically says born in Friedrichsburg on 15 JUN 1864 , then it says they were christened a month later on 18 JUL 1864 in ""Kokotzko West Prussia"". The women the individual eventually married her and all of her family are also listed as from Friedrichsburg, West Prussia. At least a couple of their children were also born there as well.  I know where Friedrichsburg in Lower Saxony in what is today Germany, but the christening in Kokoszkowy, Poland (almost 900 km via today's shortest route) or Kokoszka,Chojnice, Poland (700 km via today's shortest route) a month later with a new born infant seem unlikely. There is also a Friedrichsbruch in Brandenburg that is approximately 250 K from Kokoszka in Poland and almost 600 km from the place in today's Czech republic.  There is a similar query I found on the web ""Where is Cokotzky / Kokotzcÿ?""  that does not end with a definitive conclusion but did have the following text referenced   From Family Search     ""Parish register of baptisms, for Scharnese, Westpreußen, Germany, now   Czarze and surrounding area in Chełmno district, Bydgoszcz, Poland.   Includes records of Kokotzko, Westpreußen, Germany, now Kokocko   (Chełmno), Bydgoszcz, Poland. Text in Latin and German.""   This does not explain the Friedrichsburg / Friedrichsbruch reference though found in other records as I cannot find the Friedrichsbruch in the Culm region of Poland.  I have also found a single vague reference on Wikipedia to Płosków in Złotów Co. Poland which is 70 km from Kokoszka, Poland and 110 km from Kokoszkowy, Poland, and 120 km from Chelmno and I do not believe is considered the Culm region.      ""Płosków [ˈpwɔskuf] (German: Friedrichsbruch) is a village in the   administrative district of Gmina Złotów, within Złotów County, Greater   Poland Voivodeship, in west-central Poland.1""   I mapped some variants of Friedrichsberg (red) and variants / references of Kokotzko (yellow)  and none seem to really align to Clum/Klum/Chelmno (green) and none are immediately close to the known location.     I understand its location might be in a Map Guide to German Parish Registers Vol. 45 – West Prussia II but I do not have access to it via the local library or inter-library loan to investigate.  So the root of my question is where exactly is/was the Friedrichsbruch, Culm, Kokotzko in West Prussia? "
947,Would Royal Navy Captain's Log (1759-1766) be likely to mention Captain's Clerk?,"I have found a National Archives record that may be useful to me but, before outlaying what could be considerable cost to get it copied, I would like to try and assess what it might contain.     Reference: ADM 51/3834   Description: Captains' logs, including:   FIRM (1759 Feb 15-1763 May 13).   FIRM (1763 Nov 15-1766 Oct 30)   Date: 1759-1766   Held by: The National Archives, Kew   From his 13 Jul 1764 marriage record I know that John Smyth was the Captain's Clerk aboard HMS Firm.  I also suspect that the John Smyth who was baptised 7 May 1741 and attended Greenwich Hospital School may have been him and, if so, his graduation from there would be expected around the same time as the HMS Firm launched on 15 Jan 1759.  The above record would appear to cover the period during which he served on HMS Firm.  Does anyone have experience of examining Captain's Logs from this era to advise whether they would be likely to record things like:   the name of the Captain's Clerk, when a Captain's Clerk joined and left the ship, and whether the Captain's Clerk assisted the Captain to write his log?   Alternatively, maybe the Master's log:     Reference: ADM 52/853   Description: Firm   Date: 1759 Feb 24 - 1763 May   21   Held by: The National Archives, Kew     Related to my questions:   Case for seeking quotation to digitize Greenwich Hospital School admission record of John Smyth in about 1755?

948,Entering marriage banns into my database – one fact or three?,"Most genealogy programs support Marriage Banns facts. In GEDCOM it is the MARB tag, associated with a date and a place.  Banns were a:     Proclamation or public notice given in church of an intended marriage,   in order that those who know of any impediment thereto may have   opportunity of lodging objections.   In England, banns were usually published on three consecutive Sundays. Do you enter three identically sourced facts with just a different day, or do you just create one fact for the event?   Neither way is ideal. In the first method, it seems very redundant and not particularly useful to have three nearly identical facts. In the second method when using only one fact, which date of the three do you decide to enter?  What are the best practices for handling marriage banns events in genealogy databases? "
949,What records of smallpox vaccination exist?,"Over on the History of Science &amp; Mathematics site I asked a question about what vaccinations infants recieved in late nineteenth century England. I learned that smallpox vaccination became compulsory in 1853 under the Vaccination Act. Apparently this was regulated at the level of the local registrar, who was sent a certificate by the medical practitioner upon vaccination of an infant.  This raises the question: what records (if any) survive that document vaccination, and where and how might I locate these records? For example, did the local registrar produce a systematic record of the information contained in the vaccination certificates he was sent?  I feel that for the Vaccination Act to be enforcable, some detailed record of who was vaccinated had to have been made. If such a record does exist, it could be a useful adjunct to civil registration records. My primary location of interest is Nottinghamshire, England although I welcome any answers pertaining to other parts of the country. "

Based on Jan Murphy's suggestion, I looked up the school head, Ela Hockaday b. March 12, 1875 and found her in ED number 255-38 on page 29 at the address of 5601 Bonita in Dallas.  On the prior page, a bunch of employees are listed, but no students are shown on either page 28 or 29.  On page 28, a note says ""School Dormitory"" at 2407 Greenville Avenue.  Therefore, it appears I need to locate this child with her widowed father on the census somewhere. "
952,What records might survive of nautical assessor who died on London Docks in second half of 18th century?,"In Could John Stacy who lived/married at London and later lived at Exmouth (Devon) have been baptized in 1759 at North Petherton (Somerset)? I have been trying to identify the parents of John Stacy (1759-1831).  Today I was reading ""Colonial Cameos and Genetic Gambits - the Stacy Brown Story"" compiled by Albert E. Stacy (my 1st cousin twice removed) in 1986.  In it he writes on page 12:     Reliable record also has it that John Stacy's father was a nautical   assessor on the London Docks and was killed by a fall in the hold of a   merchant ship in the course of his duty.   He does not elaborate on what reliable record that came from but later, on page 18, he writes:     My dear cousin Elfreda of Buckhurst Hill, London, recalls:      ""When I was about thirteen years old (1904) we spent a holiday in   Exmouth and great-aunt Agnes Leatt joined us for a week.  She was an   old lady then in her eighties and one day when we were walking dorn   The Strand she pointed out an old-fashioned, double fronted shop with   slightly bowed windows of smallish panes as the one she remembered   John Stacy occupied.""   Consequently, I am assuming that he may have had access to some oral history that possibly reached him intact.  I gather that a nautical assessor was someone who worked for an insurance company and assessed the damages on any ruined cargo that arrived at the docks.  Does anyone know of a record source that might help me learn more about a nautical assessor named Stacy who worked (and died) on the London Docks and presumably died in about the last quarter of the 18th century?

954,Who were the parents of Joseph Souser b. 1815 d. 1883 in Pennsylvania?,"My long ongoing brick wall that I have been trying to break down for 15+ years is who the parents of Joseph ?NMN? Souser b.4/25/1815 (Pennsylvania?) d. 1/7/1883 (Dauphin, PA). Married Emilian Ickes 1835 in Bedford, PA.   Find a Grave  This is believed to be him (date of photograph unknown).   A long running rumor:     Said to be an orphan, and was raised by someone other than a Souser. He ran away from them at the age of 12, and became a shoemaker's apprentice (where?). Which he then continued to do the rest of his life. The use of the name Souser is not know if it is his actual original name, or an adopted name. He had just always used it. He also believed he had a brother, but never was able to find him, so was not sure. When he ran away he swam across the Susquehanna river it is said..   To date I have done Y-111 and Autosomal DNA tests on several the Sausser's &amp; Sauser's in the area completed or pending  and multiple lines of his descendants and so far not been able to triangulate a either side of his parents clearly.   There are still some Souser &amp; Sauser lines that have not yet been DNA tested which I am working on.. in particular the Catskill, NY Souser line which split up after the American Revolutionary War; the main surviving line in Michigan today.   My closest DNA match is to two Cooper's which I have a 0 &amp; 1 generational GAP on Y-37 (but they have not tested higher) and have not responded to me upgrading their kits and they both originated in New York state and passed to the midwest through this time period. I have no Y-67 or Y-111 matches beyond his direct descendants.  My closest historical leads in the time frame has been the Sausser's in Berks, PA who were tailors and shoemakers and a two of the early child tombstones in the family plot in Bedford, PA are spelled Sausser (but his marriage record in 1835 in Bedford is Souser). The adoption of Joseph Souser Michael Sausser's children but that has  not panned out..   For the the Michael Sausser (b.1731) and the two Swiss Sauser / Souser lines have all test I-M253 Haplogroup so far; but Joseph Souser's descendants are all M-269 (R-Z278/CTS12074->R-Y19146 SNP Branch per YFull).  I have so far found no other adoption / probate records have been found for a Joseph with the birth date in the area.  His will also does not give any clues on his parentage.  "
955,DNA Features of Genealogy Software,"Have any traditional genealogy software programs that people use for recording their genealogy research added any features to support DNA research?  I know there are a lot of DNA utility programs out there, but I'm more interested in features that have been added to what could be your main genealogy software for recording your information. This will include desktop programs and online family tree programs.  Examples of some features might be the ability to record DNA data for any individual, provide autosomal percentages between people, indicate Y-DNA or mt-DNA candidates for your ancestors, or anything else that might be of use.

961,When did Abraham Decker (b. 1839) die?,"Abraham Decker was born on 12 Sep 1839 in Gauersheim, in the Pfalz region of Bavaria. He emigrated to the United States in 1859. (Although he was born in the Pfalz and not in Hesse which is shown as his origin on the ship's manifest, the two are quite close by.)    On March 29, 1874, in Philadelphia, PA, Abraham Deckert married Bessie Cohn, as can be seen from this record from Congregation Rodeph Shalom found on Ancestry.com.     My guess is that these names are actually misspelled, and that the bride and groom were Bessie Cohen and Abraham Decker, for the following reasons:   In another record from the same synagogue we see this:      We then find the following entry in the 1880 census from Chicago, Il:      Finally, Bessie Cohen dies in 1929 in Illinois. Her husband's name is Abraham Decker, and her father's name is given as Meyer Cohen.   In the 1900 and 1910 censuses, Bessie is listed as a widow. The problem is that I cannot find the death record for her husband Abraham Decker. I've searched on Ancestry.com and on familysearch.org for various spellings of Decker and Abraham, and found nothing plausible.   The city directory for Chicago was not much help in localizing Abraham's death. There was an Abraham Decker listed in the 1870s and 1880s, but he was a shoe maker, whereas the 1880 census lists my Abraham Decker as a huckster. In 1887 there was an Abraham M Decker in Chicago who was a commission merchant, which is more plausible, but not close enough. In 1891, there are two Abraham Deckers listed: Abraham M Decker (real estate) and Abraham Decker (no occupation given). The second one is not likely to be the right guy: he is, in fact likely to be his first cousin, based on the address and which other Deckers are at the same address that year.   A Mrs. Bessie Decker appears in the 1888 directory, but is not marked as a widow. (Others women are.) On the other hand, no male Decker appears at the same address in 1888.In 1898, there does appear an entry for Mrs. Bessie Decker (wid. Abraham) so that narrows his death range a bit over the 1900 census, but not by much.  So when did he die? Where should I be looking next?  (Note: these Abraham Deckers are his cousins, but none of them is this particular Abraham Decker.) "
962,How likely is it that the England & Wales Census would be wrong about an age by ten years?,"Or is it just a gap in the records?  My 3xgreat-grandmother, Sarah Rule, is shown in the 1851, 1871 and 1881 Censuses for England and Wales with ages that would indicate a date of birth around 1809–1811, and a place of birth as Hull, Yorkshire, England. (The 1861 Census seems to include a possible match, mispelt ""Rull"", so I'm not relying on it.) Likewise her death record on FreeBMD suggests a birth date in this range. I also have a marriage record for her marriage to William Henry Gale (see, eg this FamilySearch link) that is consistent with her stated place of birth.  But the only birth or christening record I can find in Yorkshire for a Sarah Rule in this time frame is this one, which is the right place, but about 8–10 years out, in 1801.  I know people sometimes lied about their age when they got married and then had to keep up the pretense, but how likely is it that a discrepancy that large would go unnoticed? Alternatively, is it possible the birth record has been mistranscribed?   Are there alternative sources of Yorkshire christening records that I might be able to search to find her? "
963,From visa to naturalization,"I have found an arrival record (Ancestry.com) for Annelise Morgenthau, age 20, arriving in New York on 26 Nov 1947 on the ship Marine Jumper. Her visa number is given as QIV 6631 (issued on 26 Sep 1947 in London), and an annotation on the second sheet implies that she is intending to become a permanent resident. She is coming to join a friend or relative who is listed as F. Kahn:    Kahn is Annelise's mother's maiden name, which gives me more confidence that this is the right person. Perhaps she is coming to join her uncle...  Unfortunately, I cannot find any other trace of her in the US, and would like to explore the possibility that I can find her naturalization papers through the visa number and date of issue.  What is the right way to proceed? How do I find a naturalization request or other pertinent information based on the entry visa number? "

I have seen the many advertisements for ancestry.com and similar sites. Everything seems to work seamlessly and quickly.

970,Finding clues for a missing immigrant in the 1870 Census?,"With regards to my previous question, What happened to Gustav Adolf Neumann, 1859 immigrant to the US? and despite the very good answers, it seems like my ancestor, Gustav Adolf Neumann (born on October 27, 1824 in Leipzig, Saxony in Germany and who reached New York on Jan 17, 1859) is nowhere to be found, see more details in post linked above. He seems to have perished in the black of history.  I have found no traces in the 1860 census. Interestingly, the 1870 census offers a person, which - based on his birth year - could be the one. However, his name does not match entirely. Then, the 1880 census does not have again a Gustave Neumann in Missouri or any other close match.  I have checked for naturalisation, but they are very ambiguous as most (all?) of them do not show the birth year/birth date of the persons.  I checked several death/marriage databases all on familysearch.org, but to no avail.  I was searching on all databases for Gustav Neumann, Gustav Newman, Adolf Neumann, Adolf Newman, Adolph Neumann, or Adolf Newman with the birth years 1824 to 1825 each time.  Does someone has a clue, an idea where to look at? Was I rushy, did I overlook something? "

973,Who was William Chittel (Chettle) of Studley?,"A friend owns an English lantern clock with the inscription ""Wm Chittel of Studly"". The clock dates to about 1635, and probably before 1642 as it is decorated with a ring of flowers that was used before the English Civil War.  It was almost certainly made in London.  As there is no Chittel or Chettle in the list of Clockmaker Masters and their Apprentices from the Worshipful Company of Clockmakers, it seems most likely that William Chittel/Chettle was the owner of this clock, and so was relatively well off for the period (as these were not common items).  Another clock is known with the inscription ""Wm Chettle Studly"" which dates to about 1670. It may be that this clock was owned by the same man, or by a relative.  My question: Is it possible to determine who William Chittel/Chettle of Studly was, or at least to narrow down the possibilities? Which Studley was this? And can we determine if the clocks were owned by the same man or potentially by (e.g.) a father and son.  There was a Chittle/Chettle family who lived near the Warwickshire village of Studley, but there are a number of other ""Studley""s in England, so this isn't conclusive.  Edited to clarify: The clock has been assessed by a number of experts, and although there's a difference in opinion about whether Chittel was the owner or maker, and where it was made, the (approximate) dating is sound. "
974,What month was the 1864 Census for Re-Organizing the Georgia Militia taken?,"The 1864 Census for Re-Organizing the Georgia Militia is a useful source for researching in Georgia. It was done during the ahem, late unpleasantness, between the northern and southern US to locate potential draftees for the southern army.   Many, but not all, individuals' ages in this document are given as ""xx Years, yy Months"". This could identify a birthday down to the month, or distinguish between individuals with similar or identical names. However, without knowing the month the census was taken, it is impossible to translate such an age to an absolute year and month.   Possibly the census was taken in different months in different counties. If so, is it possible to determine those dates?   I don't see any reference to when, exactly, this census was taken. I viewed the census on Ancestry, if that matters.  "

977,DNA second cousin who is parent?,I have found a second cousin and have narrowed her down to being the granddaughter of my paternal Grandmother's only sibling (a sister). My new second cousin is adopted and excited to finally know about her birth family. I was wondering without opening a can of worms and disrupting folks is there a way we can figure out if we are related via her birth mom or father? My father (would be her parent's first cousin) took a DNA test and doesn't share an X with her (I don't either). Are we just stuck at this point until someone from that family group takes a DNA test? or is is a good guess that it is the mother?  
978,Determing if DNA match is half sibling or 1st cousin?,The person in question matches a known aunt with 1718 cM and 56 segments. He matches a known 1st cousin with 967 cM and 49 segments.    He matches another relative with 2057 cM and 57 segments.  Could he be a 1st cousin or half sibling with this data to this other relative?    The real question is which of two brothers are the father of this individual?    The 2057 cM and 57 segment match is on the son of one of the brothers (the other relative).  The issue is neither of the brothers will take a DNA test so we hoped this reading of 2057 cM and 57 segments would be conclusive that he is a half sibling.    Is this possible to tell?  
979,"Determining birth year (~1837) and birthplace of Jeremiah Ryan from Drumwood, Tipperary, Ireland?","I've been trying to track down when and where Jeremiah Ryan was born. Over the years he has given a range of inconsistent birthdates while living in New Zealand. He died on 21 Jun 1907.  Names written in NZ/Ireland records: Jerry, Dermot, Joseph.   The earliest age I've found was when he immigrated to NZ in 1875. His birthday would have been 1837. The age given at his death would have him born in 1827. The age given on his daughter Johanna Ryan's birth certificate would have him born in 1836.   His parents we believe were Michael Ryan and Bridget Burke. I have been unable to track down any information about his parents, so I'm wondering if this is correct.   His wife Mary Hayes was born on 24 May 1841, Drumwood, Tipperary. She was baptised in Sologhead and Oola, Tipperary.  All their children that were born in Ireland were in Drumwood and baptised in Sologhead and Oola.  Mary and Jeremiah were married 30 Jan 1862 (Witness: John Hayes and Johanna Dwyer) in Sologhead and Oola, Tipperary.  Mary's mother Johanna Fleming was born in Drumwood.  He may have had a brother Michael Ryan, but still researching this theory.   I'm wondering if Jeremiah was born outside of Drumwood.   Can anyone find any information that could help or the baptism itself?     I've found a possible child of Jeremiah's, if true it would have died early and would have been the first child. It was baptised in Sologhead and Oola, but they used the residence place of Moanmore (Ancery had it as Monvore). That could be the hint needed to solve this.

980,Did the Ryan family leave a footprint in England when immigrating to New Zealand in 1875 and 1883?,"I’m researching how my Ryan family left Ireland. Jeremiah (Jerry, Joseph) Ryan and Mary Hayes took 3 children Bridget (Bid), Honora (Norah) and Thomas Ryan. Martin Frances Ryan stayed behind. They were living around Drumwood/Chadville/Clonganhue in Tipperary.  They arrived in Wellington, New Zealand, 22, May 1875 on the Hindostan. Total cost to the NZ Government: 43 pounds, 10 shillings. On the same ship, there was the Power family, of which one is/becomes a Priest and marries Martin Frances Ryan in NZ.  The ship originally left Gravesend, England on 10 Feb 1875. [website]Martin Frances Ryan (age 18) left a few years later to join with his family. He arrived in Wellington, New Zealand on 17 Feb 1884 by British Queen. The cost to NZ government: 15 pounds.  The British Queen left London on 28th December 1883 and Plymouth at 6.30 p.m. on the following day. My guess Martin was at Plymouth (any evidence?). [website]Family tree: [website]I don’t know when any of the family left Ireland. The last known location before England was on the 14th Dec 1873, when Thomas Ryan was born in Clonganhue, Co Tipperary, Ireland.  Is there any evidence of the family footprint being in England? "
981,Would a deceased father be named on his child's baptism record?,"I'm searching for the bmd records of a couple (Samuel and Ann Page) who were baptising their children in Brierley Hill Staffordshire in the early nineteenth century:    Maria Page baptised March 1803 Sarah Page baptised May 1806 Samuel Page baptised Jan 1808.   There are no children of the couple baptised earlier than 1803 or later than 1808 in that Parish, or in the adjacent parish of Kingswinford. (St Michaels was a chapelry of St Mary Kingswinford until 1848).  Samuel the younger lived between 1834 and 1888 in the Brierley Hill/Brockmoor/Kingswinford area, so it seems unlikely (but not impossible) his parents moved away when he was a baby.  There is a burial in Brierley Hill of a Samuel Page aged 29 on 2 August 1807 (implying a birth in 1777/1778); and a possible marriage of Samuel Page to Nancy Holt in Kingswinford in September 1798 (no consent of parents was required, which implies a birth in or before 1777). There is no other marriage in the area between a Samuel Page and Ann/Nan/Hannah/Nancy between 1783 and 1803, according to ""England, Select Marriages 1538-1973"" on Ancestry (and elsewhere). There is also a baptism in June 1778 in Brierley Hill of a Samuel Page (Freereg.org.uk) to Samuel and Sophia (some sources say Sobiesketh).  I have therefore tentatively identified these as Samuel the elder's baptism marriage and death; although a gap of five years between marriage and baptism of the first child is unusually long, there could have been a miscarriage or stillbirth in that period.  But...  when Samuel the younger was baptised (Jan 1808), he was recorded as the son of Samuel and Ann Page (not just Ann Page). Would the deceased father usually be named in such circumstances (perhaps to indicate that the child was legitimate)? I've seen other PRs where a child is recorded as the legitimate child of a widow without naming the father.  Or does the naming of the father indicate that the father is still alive in Jan 1808?  (All events unless otherwise stated are recorded in the Parish Register transcriptions for St Michael's Brierley Hill and St Mary's Kingswinford produced by the Staffordshire Parish Registers Society.)

983,Assessing the coverage of various collections?,"This is perhaps a little more of a meta-question, but it has come to mind repeatedly over the past few weeks.  I'll start with a specific example.  In this question, I bring up the case of my ancestor, John White.  He is claimed to be (and claims to be) from Pomfret, Connecticut.  Pomfret is one of the town which is represented in the Barbour Collection, which purports to document all births, marriages, and deaths in certain cities in CT before 1850.  Here are the relevant facts:   John's birthdate is given as October 20, 1758 in Pomfret, Connecticut on his headstone. There is no John White with that birthdate in the Barbour Collection. There is a John White in the collection with a birthdate of October 21, 1762.  This is the only John White born in Pomfret in the collection and there is only one other John White born within three years of the birthdate on my ancestor's headstone.   From these facts it is clear that either my ancestor was missed in the collection or that the collection is mistaken about his birthdate or that the birthdate given on his headstone is wrong.  I know that the way to resolve this is to do a little more research and look for supporting evidence one way or the other.  This question is not about how to resolve this particular issue.  Instead, I have a slightly more general question.  If we are given a collection which purports to be ""complete"" in the sense that it claims to list all of the events of a given type in a given locality over a given timeframe, how do we go about assessing the accuracy of that statement?  Going back to John White, is it more likely that he was completely missed, that the collection was wrong, or that his headstone is wrong?  With what frequency are there mistakes in the collection?  With what frequency are there misses in the collection?    An additional bit of info on this particular case.  John White was a Revolutionary veteran and is in the DAR database with the 1758 birthdate.  I don't know how strictly accurate the DAR database is, but I believe that they have genealogists that determine the accuracy of lineages presented in applications, and it wouldn't surprise me if their info on actual participants was held to a higher level of accuracy than some of the other info. "
984,Where can I find early-20th century residence and trade information in the United Kingdom?,"I'm trying to fill in the gaps between the records I already have about William Henry Cole, born in Slapton, Devon, England around 1890, died in Holyoke, Massachusetts in 1943.    The relevant part of his timeline for this question is:   1901 Census age 11 with father William (44), mother Florence E (36), sister Olive (10), and brother Harold (3) at 12 Buxton Road, Rock Ferry, Cheshire (Civil Parish: Birkenhead) 1911 Census age 21 with with father William (54), mother Florence E (46), sister Olive (20), and brother Harold (13) at 533 New Chester Rd, Rock Ferry, Cheshire (Civil Parish: Birkenhead). His profession is ""Apprentice Hot Water Engineer"" 1913: He is initiated into the Masons.  His lodge is Clyde no 408 Glasgow, Scotland; his occupation is steamfitter.  (This card came from an index created later in Massachusetts, USA, so the event was recorded afterwards, when the memberbship index cards were created.)  The collection is Massachusetts Grand Lodge of Masons Membership Cards 1733–1990. New England Historic Genealogical Society, Boston, Massachusetts (accessed via Ancestry.com: Massachusetts, Mason Membership Cards, 1733-1990) 1921: 19 June Census day in 1921.  The 1921 Census (not yet released) might list Place of work and industry. 1924: He departs the UK for the United States on the Celtic, arriving in New York on 10 Nov 1924. On the UK Outward passenger list, the previous address is 136 Mountcollyer St, Belfast.  The US passenger list agrees that he is coming from Ireland, and gives his mother's address as 42, Highfield Road, Rock Ferry, Cheshire.  His visa was issued in Belfast.    He becomes a member of the William Whiting Lodge of Masons in Holyoke in 1926;  his obituary from 1943 says that he came to the USA in 1924, and lists his surviving siblings Olive and Harold in England, and his membership in the William Whiting Lodge of Masons.  I'd like to collect more information about his whereabouts between 1911 and 1924. One obvious record which would fill in the gap would be the 1921 Census, which is not yet released.  Apparently there has been some debate about whether the ONS can release the 1921 Census because of the data protection acts; the release date might be in 2022, 100 years after the census was collected.    This thread Data Protection and the 1921 Census on the Who Do You Think You Are? magazine's forum mentions a 1915 National Registration, ""which enumerated everyone (male and female) born between the 16th of August 1850 and the 15 August 1900"".    I'm looking for early 20th century sources in the UK such as school yearbooks, trade directories,  Masonic membership information, other directories that might have residence information, and any other records that might shed more light on this period.  (If I find WWI service records, I will add them to this timeline;  negative search results so far.)   The Derby Scheme: National Registration Act 1915.

985,List of Sacraments on Catholic Death Register doesn't include Marriage,"Today in the mail I received a copy of the death register for Maryanna Zierak. The list of Sacraments includes Confirmation, Communion, and Extreme Unction (Anointing of the Sick). Why doesn't it include Marriage? She was married. Perhaps because it just didn't fit?  I mostly ask because I'm trying to find her marriage record, or any other record which might contain her parent's names. I'm hoping that the absence of Marriage as a sacrament means either she wasn't married in the Catholic church or wasn't married in that parish or there's no record of it or.... something. Anything.

986,What is the name of the sister and what is the town in this passenger list?,"I am trying to research my husband's grandparents.

This is from the column that states who is their nearest relative in the country they are alien from. The top image is showing more of the handwriting to help with deciphering, and the second one is a crop in of what I am interested in which is lines 5-8 of the first image.

987,"Locating Manorial Records of 1843-9 Copyhold by William Hitchcox in Wheaton Aston, Staffordshire, England?","In 1837-1839 and 1842, my 3rd great grandfather Thomas Hitchcox was listed as a voter living at Wheaton Aston in the Parish of Lapley, Staffordshire, England and was qualified to vote by owning Freehold Estate/Land with entries in the UK Poll Books and Electoral Registers like that below:    However, in every year from 1843-1849, although Thomas is still qualified to vote by his Freehold House and Land, occupied by Self, his eldest son William Hitchcox (born 1821) also starts to be listed as a Lapley voter, qualified by his Copyhold House and Land, which was occupied by Thomas Hitchcox and others.  William himself is working as a druggist (or pharmacist) and initially living at Dale-end, Birmingham (1843-1844) and later (1845-1849) at Red Lion Street, Wolverhampton.    The entries in the UK Poll Books and Electoral Registers for those years are like that below:    Although a number of letters between William and Thomas survive from the period, none talk about their properties, and I am keen to understand more about the Freehold house and land of Thomas, and the Copyhold house and land of his son William (that was occupied by his father Thomas and others).  It looks to me like Thomas continues to own the same freehold house and land while William makes a copyhold purchase of a new house and land.  From Freehold and copyhold land in 18th century England? and Wikipedia etc, I have learned about the difference between Copyhold and Freehold and am assuming that there must have been two properties (probably adjacent) that Thomas was farming and living on while his son pursued his profession as a druggist.  To try and clarify this I think my next logical step will be to try and determine if the manorial records might still exist to provide a record of how the Copyhold came into William's hands and I have found some useful advice at Finding records from the &#39;manor house&#39;.  Does anybody know whether manorial records for this part of Staffordshire are likely to exist, whether they are likely/certain to contain Copyhold information, and how to best access them from Australia (where both William and Thomas end up a few years later after selling up in Staffordshire)? "
988,What German provinces were recorded in the 1920 Census?,"In the 1920 Census, my husband's great-grandmother and 2-great-grandmother were enumerated with a birthplace Saxony.  There is a note next to the birthplace which may be in a different hand that says Ger (presumably for Germany). I have a passenger list from 1882 which seems to read ""Saxony"" as well.    Previous (1900, 1910) and later (1930, 1940) census records show the birthplace of the family members as Germany. The lazy genealogists' answer for this difference in reporting might be, ""oh, the family didn't want to say they were from Germany because of the war"".  I'm putting aside this interesting social question for the more practical one:  if the birthplace was recorded as  Saxony in the 1920 Census, what did that mean?  Does it mean where Saxony was as of 1 January 1920? My ultimate goal is to gather more information about the possible locations for the family's origin in Germany.    The article Wikipedia: Saxony (disambiguation) shows the problem: the Kingdom of Saxony (1806–1918), and the Province of Saxony (1816–1945) are two different regions.  The town that has passed down in the family tradition as the place of origin is in modern-day North Rhine-Westphalia, which is covered -- if Saxony = Old Saxony.  (Not likely, for reasons noted in this answer.)    Edited to add: Before I wrote the question, I didn't know that the subject heading for places in Germany in the Catalog of the Family History Library are based on Meyers Orts. See FamilySearch Wiki article: German Historical Geography.  I'd like to find statistics or research about the birthplaces recorded for German-American citizens in 1920. A table that listed all the provinces or regions that were recorded in the census would make it easier to see how the provinces reported in 1920 matched up with Meyers Orts.      Update: Some new digital images have been posted online at FamilySearch, and I have used the index card from the Index to New England Naturalizations to locate the naturalization records for my husband's 2-great-grandfather.   His birthplace is listed as Werdau (in the Free State of Saxony).    So the mystery remains about why the family story said his wife was ""from"" the other town (in North Rhine-Westphalia).   "
989,Tracing genealogy of people with particular Polish surname?,"I am trying to trace the genealogy of one or more people with the surname ""Wozniack.""    I believe that it is Polish name and that these people are of Polish descent  Where in Poland are people with this surname likely to be found/come from?   If I took a field trip over to Poland, what resources might be available  there for tracing them that would not be available to me now (sitting at a desk, working online, in the U.S.)? "
990,Contacting living distant relatives?,"During my research, I have identified some people currently living who I believe are distant relatives. They are a brother and sister, who are my wife's third cousins. Neither has a family tree on Ancestry.com, so the obvious approach isn't possible. I have tried the following courses of action:   Sent the brother a direct email to a plausible email address I found online. No answer. Sent the brother an invitation through LinkedIn because he was a 3rd-degree connection in my network. The message did not appear to get forwarded by an intervening connection.   Now I can do one of these things:   Contact the sister through Facebook (although I am not keen on creating a Facebook account) Sending a regular letter to: either one of the 3rd cousins, or to their parents who are still alive.   Are there other reasonable things to try? What's a good way to word the letter to the parents?   I had attached a copy of a family group portrait that includes a common ancestor to the email I sent (step 1). I can also include a printed copy in a regular letter.  The broader question here is what are good strategies for contacting people who are potential relatives? The goal is establish a connection, rather than to freak people out or to cause them to think I want something from them.    Following some of the answers, I sent a letter including a family photo and a hand-written note, and received a phone call the day after they received it. We had a great conversation with more to come.  "
991,"Of a death certificate and a gravestone, which record should be trusted more in determining birth date?","I have an ancestor for whom I have very little information for.  I am trying to identify the exact birth date for this person.  I have a death certificate which lists the birth date as ""May 1st"", however the gravestone for this person lists ""May 4"".  I am certain that the numbers were readable, so there is definitely a discrepancy in the dates.  Which record should be trusted more?  I know that the family supplies the date for both the death certificate and the gravestone, however I would suggest the family would be more concerned that it be correct on the gravestone, as the death certificate might be created in haste.  Is there general guidance for this?  For those who may be curious, attached below are the records.  I missed it before, but the year of the birthdate is actually different by 1 as well. (1962 on the gravestone and 1961 on the death certificate)  I am actually more concerned about the year than the actual date, of course.    "
992,Finding original surname of adopted child from New York?,"My late father-in-law was adopted by his step-father when he was 10. My late grandmother-in-law never talked about her first husband and there is some confusion on the first husband's surname.   My father-in-law was born in 1934 in Syracuse, New York.   I went to the New York State archives in Albany and got a copy of my father-in-law's birth certificate. The certificate was altered at the time of the adoption and his step-father's name was overwritten with the fact of the date of the adoption.   I've been unsuccessful at finding any documentation on the marriage or on his birth other than the birth certificate. I searched local newspapers.   I have not been able to locate him or his mother in the 1940 census. They were not living with her parents and I can not find her under her maiden name. Without the surname, I do not know how to locate either of them in the census.  Is there any way to find the birth father's surname?   Are adoption records (for New York State for a 1930s birth and 1940s adoption) accessible? "
993,Tracing Jewish ancestors in Germany before 1800,"I have been able to trace my wife's ancestors to people born in the 1790s in the Pfalz region of Germany and in Alsace using civil records of births and deaths. Those records books were started in the 1790s as part of Napoleon's influence. My understanding is that Napoleon also decreed that Jews had to take on last names at that time (rather than relying on first name and patronymic) to make record-keeping easier.  What sorts of records can I use to investigate the family lines further? Where are such records kept, and if the locations of such records vary by region, how does one go about discovering where these may be? Whereas Catholic or Protestant family lines would be documented in the church records (and perhaps available from familysearch.org), what are appropriate sources for Jewish records? "

Can someone explain these or guide me to a definitive list of what they entail?  "
995,What details are needed about ancestor to uncover ship they immigrated to America on?,"What basic information do I need to have about my ancestor before I start looking for the ship that he/she came to America on?  So that I don't waste a lot of time fruitlessly searching for a ship - what information should I try to find first, before I look for the ship?   If I know a name and possible spellings of that name and a birth date, what else do I need to know in order to confidently connect them to a particular ship? "
996,When did patronymics cease to be used in North Wales?,"Searching for the marriage of Griffith Roberts and Jane Pritchard sometime between 1855 (when the groom would have been about 18 and the bride 25) and 1866 in Caernarvonshire, Wales (where they were both born and resident at the birth of their two known children in 1859 and 1866 ), I haven't found a single marriage in the GRO indices or the North Wales BMD indices (cross-checked against the parish registers that are available on-line) that exactly fits the bill.  However, I have found the marriage of Griffith Roberts to Jane Parry daughter of Henry Prichard in 1858 . The ages difference between the participants matches the age difference in later censuses (Jane 6-7 years older than Griffith). The marriage took place in in Llanllyfni, which is the parish where both children were born, and the bride's residence is the same as the family's residence in the census 3 years later.  If patronymics were still in use of this area of North Wales in 1858,and Jane might be referred to as Jane ap Harry (Jane Parry), then this is a very good match.  So: were patronymics still in use in 1859 in this part of North Wales? And would Jane have been recorded as Jane Parry, even though properly she would have been Jane verch Harry?  Update: @Fortiter very helpfully pointed me to Rowlands, John, and Rowlands, Sheila, eds. The Surnames of Wales for Family Historians and Others, 2nd ed. Baltimore, MD: Genealogical Publishing Company, 1999. ISBN: 0-80631-516-4, where I found:     As late as 1862, the marriage took place in Llangi'an, of Ellen   Roberts, daughter of Robert Jones, and such an event, though by then   unusual, could be replicated in other parts of rural north and west   Wales.   which suggests that the timeframe is possible and also that, by then, verch wasn't always used but that a suffix 's' or  prefix 'p' were used to form the second name, even for daughters.  Second update: There's a very good post on the timelines for patronymics in Wales at this Rootsweb thread, confirming that the timeframe is possible.  Third update: John and Sheila Rowlands, The Surnames of Wales Updated and Expanded, Llandysul, Ceredigion, Wales, Gomer Press in association with the National Library of Wales, 2013 includes a Survey of Transition in Wales away from patronymic naming, based on analysis of probate information from 1509 onwards. They demonstrate that, in 1858, 10% of name in my area of interest were still based on the patronymic naming system. "
997,What was the nature of record keeping for land ownership in the Pfalz prior to the introduction of the cadastre/Kataster system?,"Some time in the 1840s the French cadastre system of recording land ownership for tax purposes was introduced into the Pfalz region of Bavaria. Records such as the one shown below identified parcels owned by a particular individual, recorded the taxation amounts, and provided some information about how the owner came to possess the parcel.    The details of individual parcels were arranged in a table like this:    There was also an associated map that showed locations of the various parcels. My question is what kinds of property records were kept in the Pfalz region prior to the introduction of this system, and what was the origin of these parcel numbers? Was a survey done specifically for this purpose, or were results of earlier surveys reused? Who kept track of land ownership prior to the Kataster system? Do these records survive to the present day, and, if so, where can they be found? In the same archive as the Kataster records? Elsewhere? What are they called? "

1001,Can anyone interpret this report of a ship's charter for cargo?,"In California Digital Newspaper Collection, there is a 'Shipping Intelligence' report I am trying to understand. It's in ""Charters"", ""Shipping Intelligence"", San Francisco Call, 25 January 1896, p.12, col.6 - search for 'Glenclova', which is the name of the ship, if you want to see it.  'Glenclova' appears to have been chartered to transport lumber from the Puget Sound area to Australia, for she is reported in that edition of the SF Call as   ""Glenclova loads lumber on the Sound for Sydney, 35s., option of Melbourne, Adelaide or Port Pirie, 45s.""   I'm trying to understand exactly what this entry means and wonder if anyone has experience of shipping reports and can confirm or deny my thoughts?   My initial guess is that an export company had chartered her to take timber from the USA to Australia - initially to Sydney, but they had an option to continue on to one of the other three ports (which are further round the Australian coast from Sydney), no doubt depending on where the best price could be obtained.   What is of interest to me is what the 35 or 45 shillings bit means. Is 35s the unit price the ship charges to transport a certain amount of timber (1 ton?) to Sydney.

1002,Are there mtDNA societies like there are surname societies for Y-DNA?,"Males get their Y-DNA from their father and both males and females get their mtDNA from their mother. Because surnames generally follow the Y-DNA, groups of individuals with the same Y-DNA can find each other thru surname societies. Is there an equivalent to a surname society for people who share mtDNA? Ie are there any societies arranged around matrilineal lines instead of surnames? "
1003,Provenance of Cook County death indexes,"Ancestry.com has two indexes for deaths in Cook County:     Ancestry.com. Cook County, Illinois Death Index, 1908-1988 [database on-line]. Provo, UT, USA: Ancestry.com Operations Inc, 2008.       Original data: Cook County Clerk. Cook County Clerk Genealogy Records. Cook County Clerk’s Office, Chicago, IL: Cook County Clerk, 2008.   and     Ancestry.com. Cook County, Illinois, Deaths Index, 1878-1922 [database on-line]. Provo, UT, USA: Ancestry.com Operations, Inc., 2011.       Original data:       Illinois, Cook County Deaths 1878–1922.” Index. FamilySearch, Salt Lake City, Utah, 2010. Illinois Department of Public Health. “Birth and Death Records, 1916–present."" Division of Vital Records, Springfield, Illinois.   Are these indexes based on the same ingestion of the records, or can they be considered somewhat independent? The reason I am asking is that I am looking for a death record for Samuel M. Rothschild, whose death is reported here in the Chicago Tribune on 7 Jan 1920:    If the two collections are based on the same scan of the data, then the omission of the same record from both collections is not an independent event, probabilistically-speaking. If, however, the two scans are independent, it seems much less likely that they both accidentally skipped the same record. Then the possibilities are that he did not die in Cook County, or that his death was not reported. His death is not recorded in the Illinois State death index either, and his death notice does not mention him dying away from home, so I am at a bit of a loss to account for the details of his death.  What other hypotheses should I entertain? Where else might he have died? For the record, he sometimes went by the name Marcus, and was born in 1835 in Germany, probably in Hesse-Darmstadt. "
1004,How to narrow down date of U.S. census data collection before 1850?,"Starting in 1850, the U.S. census had a date at the top of the page for when the enumeration was recorded for the families on that page.  I was looking at the 1830 census and 1840 census in Claiborne, Louisiana in particular and see on Wikipedia that those censuses were recorded as of June 1, 1830 and June 1, 1840.  For the family I'm interested in, I looked at the first page and last page of the section, hoping there might be a date there, but none were found.  Where might I find clues as to a more precise date the family was enumerated?  I know that 1850 census was also conducted on June 1, 1850, but have seen pages dated September.  Was the census taker supposed to enumerate as of June 1st and ignore any births since then and give ages as of June 1st?  If so, how well did they typically follow these directions in the 1830 and 1840 censuses? "
1005,Ways to find headstone names in Mexican cemeteries?,"I am a complete newbie.

He most likely emigrated alone to the U.S. about 1855.   From US Census Records presented in Finding record of Peter J Starrs in USA prior to 1870 Census? I believe that the Peter Starrs I seek was born about 1836 in Ireland. Most likely Northern Ireland as most Starrs seem to come from there.   His estimated year of birth is different from 1870 (says 1829-1830) to 1880 (says 1836) census records (but it is him).  His wife, Mary Ann Starrs (McDowell-maiden name) died in July 6th, 1880 in NYC.

1012,What are chances of a yDNA match by chance and not by close common ancestor?,"On FamilyTreeDNA, they have their TiP Report that gives the probability that two matching members shared a common ancestor within the last number of generations.  E.g., for a yDNA-37 match with 4 variations it suggests 90.6% within the last 12 generations.  Now for this yDNA test on my side of the match, we know the paternal line with a very high level of confidence back to the 1600s and ten generations due to yDNA triangulation of the paper trails.  Therefore, I'm wondering, could it be this is a false positive?  It seems to me that you could have two separate lines that go back many hundreds of years that just happened to mutate and by coincidence end up in the same general area of yDNA and thus appear as a match.  I know a NPE is also a possibility, but perhaps this type of coincidence is too?  If so, what is the probability of a yDNA match where surnames do not come close to each other being a false positive?

My Heritage has been suggested but I do not wish to publish my tree on that site.  I need something simple.  
1015,How were absentees recorded on the Protestation Returns?,"The Protestation Returns of 1641/2 are currently being digitised and made freely accessible on the UK Parliament website.  My understanding is that for each parish the oath was performed by everybody on a single day in February or March of 1641/2. Were only inhabitants of the parish recorded on the return for that parish? How were visitors or travellers handled? Did anyone qualified to take the oath take it, regardless of where their permanent abode was? If someone was away at the time of the Protestation, might they have been added at a later date?  When interpreting these returns it seems important to understand precisely who was qualified to take the oath in a parish. "
1016,Looking for shipping information leaving England in September 1879 for Japan,"I am looking for shipping information about one James Main Dixon (1856 (Paisley)-1933 (Los Angeles)) who left England in September 1879 for Yokohama, Japan.

1017,What happened to the 1896 London census records?,"A little known fact is that a census of London was performed in 1896.  On GENUKI it states:     A quinquennial census was held covering the London County Council area   on 29 March 1896, paid for by the local authority, and with primary   aim of establishing parochial populations in connection with local   rates. In line with the recommendations of the Treasury Committee   which had developed the proposals for the 1891 census, this was only a   summary enumeration, in which name, sex and relationship to head of   household of each person were recorded. The enumerators' books from   this census are believed not to have survived.      The Registrar General published a summary as a Parliamentary Paper in   August 1896, and the LCC published a statistical return giving the   population in each ward or parish divided into males and females, the   number of rated households, and the numbers of inhabited and   uninhabited houses (this was LCC Official Publications Vol.27, at LMA   under reference SC/PPS/063/027). There are no personal details in   either publication.   This suggests that the records containing individual details ""are believed not to have survived."" However, I have been unable to find a definitive source to confirm this. Were the 1896 London census enumeration records destroyed intentionally, or accidentally? Or do they actually still survive and are archived somewhere? It would not be the first time for records thought to have been lost to resurface. If they did survive it would be useful to track families between 1891 and 1901. "
1018,How do we properly use née for given names?,"I know after checking various sites that née is often used after the current family name and before the maiden family name for a woman.  But how is it properly used before a person's original given name?   The first name my mother uses is Rita, and that's how she has been known by everybody since she was a child. But she was actually born Rebecca. For some reason she has used Rita all her life and I believe even her driver's license says Rita. But her birth certificate says Rebecca. I'm not sure how it is listed with social security. At any rate, her birth given name and the name she has actually used all her life are different.  If we were to use née in this case, would this be correct?     Rita née Rebecca Lerner  "
1019,"Identifying parents of John & William Milman who were baptised 1800 & 1805 at Okehampton, Devon, England?","Susanna Millman was my 3rd great grandmother and she married William Creber on 25 Dec 1820 at Marystow, Devon, England.  She is mentioned in Why use name Ebzeebra for Ebbot Millman (nee Martin) on 1840 gravestone at Marystow, Devon, England? which can be considered a complementary question to this one.  That Susanna was the daughter of Ebzeebra/Ebbot and John Millman, and the wife of William is supported strongly by her gravestone which says:     Ebzeebra wife of John Millman of the parish of Coryton Who died the   19th day of December 1840 aged 65 years ALSO of Susanna daughter of   the above and wife of William Creber who died the 25th day of May 1834   aged 36 years Where they dwelt in the mortal land   Susanna's parents (Ebbot Martin and John Millman married on 14 Sep 1795 at Beaworthy, Devon and they may have had nine children.

1020,Why is GEDmatch report omitting some matches?,"I ran a GEDmatch multi-kit analysis and got this report for Matches with Joseph's kit, for chromosome 12:     And putting a different kit in first position, I get this report for matches with Charlotte:     The strange thing I notice is on Chromosome 12, in the first report I get several matches that span as much as from 1,359,590 to 5,316,226 (about 12.3 cM).  In the second report, I get Edna matching Charlotte from 1,517,192 to 3,941,530 (7.58692 cM).  The segment matches Charlotte from the first report, so why doesn't Edna appear in the first report?

1021,Balancing availability and privacy for family stories?,"I would like to interview relatives about their lives and stories, and those of their ancestors and descendants, and I'd like to share these stories, but I want to strike a balance between what is available and what is private.  This is the same sort of balance wherein online family trees typically only share information about deceased persons, or in which census data, which is private, becomes public 4 generations later (in several countries).  How do I do this?  To be clear, I'm not asking how to do interviews, and I'm not asking how to share the stories, although that has its own complications.  Is it reasonable to say this?     Tell me your stories; I will share them with family, and after you   pass away, I'll make them available to everyone.   And if so, what of stories of deceased ancestors?   It'd be nice to put things like that on FamilySearch or on Youtube, available to everyone who is interested, now.   What about stories of grandchildren? Should I wait for the grandchild to die?  Lastly, I assume I should obtain some sort of permission slip, either a form, or perhaps a recorded statement.  I can't be the only one who desires to do this, and to balance the needs of privacy now with availability later.   What techniques would you recommend to achieve this? "
1022,Analyzing Wurttemberg church records discovered via FamilySearch?,"I am researching an ancestor, Johann Gottlieb Berner, and I am finding two people by this name in FamilySearch:   JGB, born in Unterturkheim, Wurttemberg on 12 Jan 1847 to Gottlieb Berner and Regina Dothea (sic!)

(see [website]The marriage between Gottlieb Berner and Regina Dorothea Wirth is well documented; they had twelve other children between 1830 and 1850, but I have been unable to find any mention of Eva Rosina Wirth.

Conversely, how likely is it that there really are two Johann Gottlieb Berners in Unterturkheim, born on the same day?

1024,"Seeking to verify 1862 Scottish marriage, birth and death records for a Henry Clifford stationed with the Royal Navy at Leith","In researching Henry Clifford (b 1839, Ewell, Surrey), grandparents' names in lieu of parents' names disallows certainty of his marriage to a Jane Young in Edinburgh 1862.   Henry volunteered w/the Royal Naval in Wales in 1861, and was a 2nd class stoker aboard HMS Edinburgh, a ""stationary ship"" in the Port of Leith.   Later GRO and children's baptismal records show a wife named Jane Young. The Scottish marriage record is the only marriage record I've found.   Henry was previously a gunpowder maker, as was his father. He gives ""engine keeper"" as is occupation on the marriage record, and ""gunpowder maker"" as his father's occupation, both which concur with many other records.   In the two years following the marriage, birth and death records of their first child (verified by address), Henry states ""gunpowder maker"" as occupation.   There seems a high likelihood that I have the correct record, save two burning questions:   Would an enlisted Royal Navy man marry onshore?   Why would a groom give his grandparents' names in lieu of his parents' names on a Scottish civil marriage record?   "

1026,How should I interpret this sequence of records?,"I'm searching for the marriage of the parents of one of my ancestors, and the baptisms of her siblings, and have a sequence of events that could have multiple interpretations.    Ann[e] Westwood was born in 1811 in Kingswinford Staffordshire (according to the 1841 and 1851 censuses, and her 1852 death certificate).  She married Samuel Page in Kingswinford in 1831.  The census records of 1841 and 1851 have her living in Brockmoor, Kingswinford; she died in 1852 in the Union Workhouse in Wordsley a few miles away. All 12 of her children and her husband were baptised within the Church of England (in Brierley Hill), so I consider it very likely that she was baptised in the Church of England, as well. (It is of course possible that she wasn't baptised at all -- see What proportion of the births or baptisms of children were recorded in early nineteenth century England?)  The best fit baptism given the evidence from other records is:   Anne Westwood baptised Brierley Hill (a chapelry of Kingswinford that was closer to Brockmoor than the main church) on 28 Jul 1811, daughter of Edward Westwood and Hannah.   And that's where the fun begins.    I've found the following marriages of an Edward Westwood in Staffordshire from 1777-1811 (assuming his wife was less than 50 when she gave birth to Anne, and 16 or more then she married) in Kingswinford and adjacent parishes:   26 Sep 1802 Kingswinford Edward x Eleanor Thomson  31 May 1803 Kingswinford Edward x Elizabeth Guest  4 Mar 1804 Wombourne Edward Westwood x Mary Aston. This couple were baptising children in Wombourne between 1807 and 1812 so can be eliminated.   Note: In this period couples whose nearest church was in Brierley Hill still married in Kingswinford.  There is no marriage between an Edward Westwood and an Ann/Hannah/Nancy, nor any Westward marriages.    Looking for baptisms with a father of Edward in Kingswinford or Brierley Hill in the period up to 20 years after the two remaining candidate marriages, I find:   Mary 26 Dec 1802 BH Edward x Eleanor Thomas 23 Sep 1804 BH Edward x Eleanor Thomas 5 Oct 1806 KW Edward x Elizabeth Sarah 19 Apr 1807 BH Edward x Eleanor (buried 19 Jun 1807) Maria 19 Mar 1809 BH Edward x Eleanor Anne 28 Jul 1811 BH Edward x Hanh Sarah 17 Jul 1814 BH Edward x Eleanor (Brockmoor, Collier) William 19 Jan 1817 BH Edward x Elzth (Brockmoor, Miner) Eliza 7 Nov 1819 BH Edward x Eleanor (Brockmoor, Miner) James 19 May 1822 BH Edward x Eleanor (Brockmoor, Miner) Maria Jane 2 Oct 1823 BH Edward x Anne (Moor Lane, Black bottle manufacturer) Jos 15 Jun 1825 BH Edward x Eleanor (Brockmoor, Collier) (also buried 15 Jun 1825)   The only Westwood children I have found baptised to Edward Westwood and Hannah/Ann/Nancy between 1802 and 1822 are: Edward, Josiah, Alfred, Olivia, Samuel baptised 1816 - 1830 in Warwickshire/Birmingham to Edward Westwood and Hannah Thompson. Edward and Hannah married in 1813 in Aston Warwickshire,so I have eliminated this family.  All searches have been done on on all of: Ancestry, Findmypast, Freereg and in PDF versions of parish register transcripts for Kingswinford and Brierley Hill.    How  should I interpret this sequence of  records? And what other searches should I carry out to resolve the question of Anne Westwood's parentage? "

1028,Using shared cM to determine likelihood of misattributed paternity?,"My ancestor Harriet Smith was born in the mid-1850s in England. Her birth certificate shows both of her parents (John Smith and Sarah Johnson). For the purposes of the birth registration, John and Sarah were recorded as if a married couple.  John and Sarah were married the month after Harriet's birth.  However, Sarah was baptised a year later and the baptism registration records her as Harriet, illegitimate daughter of Sarah Johnson. This baptism record also notes the date of birth, and given this was in a small rural parish I am certain that this is the same Harriet.  John and Sarah went on to have 8 more children.  Harriet does not appear on any census with her parents (she is with her maternal uncle in 1861, and in service by 1871).  Harriet's marriage certificate shows her father as John Smith.  The question remains whether John was actually the father of Harriet, particularly given he is omitted from her baptism record over a year after her birth and marriage to her mother.    I have been trying to use DNA to solve this problem. Fortunately I have been able to test the DNA of Harriet's granddaughter.  Harriet's granddaughter (E) matches with several descendants of Harriet's sister (or half-sister?) Eliza. Eliza was certainly a daughter of both Sarah and John. E matches with the following people:   W (presumed 2nd cousin twice removed): 61 cM, 5 segments G (presumed 2C2R): 54 cM, 3 segments S (presumed 2C3R): 17 cM, 2 segments M (presumed 2C3R): 11 cM, 1 segment   These matches shown as a tree:      These matching segments seem smaller than I would expect for a full second cousin twice removed, although only marginally so. According to the most recent data of the Shared cM Project:   2C2R: average 74 cM, range 0 – 261 cM 2C3R: average 57 cM, range 0 – 139 cM Half 2C2R: average 61 cM, range 0 – 363 cM Half 2C3R: insufficient data   Note there is a small sample size for each of these relationships, particularly the half-relationships.  Clearly the shared cM for E and the cousins are within the range for both the full and the half-2C2R and 2C3R relationships, so it would seem to me that this DNA data is not particularly conclusive as to whether John was Harriet's father.  The questions:   Does this DNA data provide any evidence at all as to whether John was Harriet's father? If not, are there any further methods (either DNA or otherwise) that may be used to elucidate this relationship?  "

1030,Explaining major discrepancy in genomic position between Gedmatch and MyHeritage?,"I have identified a discrepancy with several test kits that were tested at Ancestry, with results transferred to both Gedmatch and MyHeritage, all relating to the same area at the end of chromosome 19.  For one segment match on chromosome 19, Gedmatch and MyHeritage show the match at two different close but non-overlapping locations:  Gedmatch:   MyHeritage:   As you can see, Gedmatch states the match is in the 59M-63M position, while MyHeritage shows this segment in the 54M-59M position. When going to map these results in DNA Painter, they therefore appear to be two distinct segments, when in reality they are actually the same matching segment (the blue and green should be overlapping):   The other segment matches between these two people all are very similar in terms of genomic position, on both Gedmatch and MyHeritage.  Now small differences I could live with, since each service uses different SNPs. But there is something not right here.   How to explain the discrepancy? Is this occuring due an error on the part of Gedmatch, MyHeritage, or with the actual kit data from Ancestry? "
1031,Half Siblings not showing up as DNA matches?,"I am managing the DNA accounts of my adopted brother. He has been tested directly with Ancestry and 23andMe. In 2017 FTDNA was allowing users to upload their raw dna data for a fee, and they would be given their matches same as if they had submitted a direct sample. (Or so I've been told)   I have found both his birth parents (unmarried)  and the birth father has been tested at 23andme to confirm paternity. He passed.   So. Apparently my adopted brother has a half sibling. A brother, who would share the same father, different mothers.  This half sibling was registered with FTDNA several years before my brother. He should have been his highest match, and yet he doesn't show up as a DNA match at all on ftdna. They should share 700 cm roughly, if I am not wrong. Half brother insists they don't match because he has a ""mutation"" of his y haplogroup.   My understanding is that should not affect them matching as half siblings? It is highly possible they share no DNA as the relationship between his parents was rocky at best.  Can 2 half siblings not show up as matches at all? And would the mutation in his brother's haplogroup cause this?  "
1032,"I'm a 2nd cousin to someone, my brother is a distant cousin?","My brother and I have both been tested on 23andme.  There are many people that show up at different relationships and I'm trying to understand how there can be large differences in predicted relationships.  We are of Ashkenazi heritage and I've heard that can make relationships seem closer than they actually are. My brother and I do show up as brothers (48% shared), so it's not that.  One example is a person is predicted to be a 2nd cousin to me (81cm, 10 segments) but a distant cousin to my brother (43cm, 6 segments). We both share the same 10.5cm segment with this other person but I also share segments of approx 9, 11, 10, 12 that my brother does not, plus 5 in the 5-6 range. My brother has a 8cm segment with this person I don't have then four of 5-6cm that do not match mine.  So given I don't share any long segments with this person and the total is on the low side for 2nd cousins, could it be that the smaller segments that seem to have pushed me into a closer predicted relationship are just IBS and the person is really farther from me than 2nd cousin? Or do you think we are 2nd cousins and my brother just didn't happen to inherit enough of the same DNA segments from our common ancestor?  We have a family tree that only goes back 2 generation for the most part but know the names of our grandparents siblings and their descendants.  Unfortunately we don't recognize the names as belonging to anyone in the family tree we know about. However most of the people that match as 2nd cousins to me or my brother are listed as distant cousins to the other brother. I'm trying to figure out if the predicted relationship of 2nd cousin is real and there is some unexplained people in our genealogy or if they are really more distant relatives. "
1033,"Using ""shared DNA"" column in 23andme for triangulation?","On the 23andme site when you compare dna with a relative there is a column labeled ""Shared DNA"" and the description on their site says     Shared DNA means that you and your two genetic relatives share a   portion of the same DNA segment. By clicking on the “Yes” links below   you will be able to view where that overlap occurs in the DNA View of   DNA Relatives tool.   several websites say that this is a true triangulation feature; for example [website]I have 2 questions:   If 23andme has a ""yes"" in this column is there a way to find out how much overlap?  The viewer shows the segments and hovering above them shows the length of each segment but so far it looks like the only way to calculate how much overlap is to eyeball it. Is there an efficient way to use this tool?  I can see spending way too much time on this; first I need to select each relative I have, and then I need to go thru the dozens of pages that show up for each relative because of the 2 columns (one labeled ""You"" and one labeled with the relative I am comparing to) the column for me is in order of closeness but the one for the relative is not. So I might need to go down several pages before I discover that a 3rd cousin to me is a 2nd cousin to my relative I am comparing to.  Each page click takes time to load...   It looks like I have a lot more relatives to work with on 23andme than I do on gedmatch which is why I'm trying to figure out how to do this.  "
1034,Parsing census record (including in-laws) from New York City?,"So I'm getting a bit confused trying to parse  this census record:   [Charles] Graham is the grandfather I care about.  My mother doesn't know much about him since he died when she was young, but the one thing she was sure of were aunts Katie (or katy) and Johanna.  Since the year is right from Graham, this looks like a hit.  Graham' marriage is interesting, but certainly within the realm of possibility as he never married my grandmother (who was also married to someone else).  But I'm curious about his relationship to Catherine, Johanna, and Anna.  It's possible that Graham's (unknown) wife is a Cripps, but why wouldn't she live there (which is what I believe the 7 means).  If instead Catherine Cripps used to be Catherine Graham that would match up with my story (catherine matching katie).  But if that's the case Why is Anna named Anna Meier?  If she was Charles and Catherine's mother, I would expect her name to be Graham, same with Johanna.  Anna is listed as married but maybe Charles father died and she remarried, having Johanna with the new husband?  I feel like I'm missing something and I'm hopeful that someone here can provide an alternate thought process which might help, or some tips to find more details. "
1035,Tracing Hitchcox migration Liverpool-Adelaide in 1854 on ships Constance and Antelope?,"My ancestors Thomas and Jane (nee Anslow) Hitchcox, aged 56 and 57 respectively, immigrated to South Australia in late 1854 with six offspring:   Richmond (from Thomas' first marriage to Jane's deceased sister Elizabeth), aged 30 Elizabeth (inexplicably recorded on the passenger list as Wife [to Richmond who was on the line above?]), aged 22 Keturah, aged 21 Joseph, aged 19 Thomas, aged 17 Robert, aged 14   The front cover of a book entitled ""The Hitchcox Family from Wheaton Aston to Adelaide and a Pugnacious Apothecary"" by Josephine Prescott, with additional material collected and inserted by Robert Brown, with assistance of family members, states that:     They boarded the Antelope, which left from Liverpool on June 6 1854,   and arrived in Adelaide on December 21, 1854.   Inside that book on p.44 it states that:     the Antelope had sailed from Liverpool, carrying Thomas Hitchcox, his   wife Jane, and all his children except Alithea and her family.  The   ship called first at Sydney and Melbourne and arrived in Adelaide on   Thursday December 21, 1854.   The book appears to be a very well researched family history, with lots of personal letters and newspaper articles from around the time and yet I think the reference to the Antelope carrying them from Liverpool to Adelaide is wrong!  The Victoria, Australia, Assisted and Unassisted Passenger Lists, 1839–1923 on Ancestry.com records that Thomas Hitchcox and his family departed Liverpool and arrived in Melbourne during December 1854 on the Constance!    Below are two images from the Passenger List of the Constance which is dated 30 Aug 1854, and says that it is bound for Melbourne.  Where this document was completed is not clear to me.      Consequently, I am confident that the Hitchcox family did arrive in Melbourne aboard the Constance but I have much confusion about the role the Antelope played in their emigration/immigration.  Some thoughts I have are:   Maybe the Antelope carried them from Liverpool to another port where they changed ships to the Constance Maybe the Antelope carried them from Melbourne to Adelaide More than six and a half months to get from Liverpool to Melbourne seems excessive so perhaps there was a change of ship and slight delay in Melbourne or England the date of 30 Aug 1854 on the above passenger list suggests to me that it was only around then that the Constance left England and a voyage time of just under four months seems more likely to me   Does anyone know how I could learn more about the Antelope and its movements in the second half of 1854?  The Antelope does appear to have been in Australian waters in late 1853 (Dead Persons' Society of Perth, Western Australia: Passenger Ships into South Australia) and very early 1854 (Mary-Anne Warner, Mariners and ships in Australian Waters). "
1036,Finding late 18th Century service record of soldier William Hobbs in Somersetshire Militia?,"On the marriage record (from Pallot's Marriage Index via Ancestry.com) of my 4th great grandparents Jane Courtenay and William Hobbs at Truro St Mary, Cornwall, England in 1798, William is recorded as being a ""soldier Somersetshire Militia"".    Is it likely that I will be able to uncover any records of the Somersetshire Militia related to William Hobbs' service in it?  I suspect the records below may be my best bet but they do not appear to be online and some links at [website]  Scope: 1758-1866: 1st Somerset Regiment of Militia records       Repository: Somerset Heritage Centre       Record Reference: G279 link to online catalogue (broken)      NRA catalogue reference: NRA 4320 Somerset RO misc   I am also interested in learning about any campaigns that the Somersetshire Militia may have been engaged in around that time.    As an update I have found an internet source titled The Family History of Alan &amp; Trisha THATCHER that says:     Pay and Muster Rolls for 1798 - first regiment of Somerset Militia.   Colonel Earl Poulett's regiment. Major Philip Staples' company.   Company at Helston in April 1798. William describes as a Private in   stationary quarters 30, earning 1/- per day. John Hobbs in same   company.

1037,At what ages did British students enroll in school in the late 1800s and early 1900s?,"The Archives and Records Association (ARA) in the UK and Ireland is leading a National Digitisation Project and one of the products of this effort has been published by Find My Past:  England and Wales National School Admission Registers and Log-books 1870-1914.  (News story at ARA.)  Some of the towns I study are in this first phase of publication, and I'd like to create a Research Plan with a list of all the people in my database who might have been the right ages to be found in this collection.  The school I am most interested in is a County Primary School, but there are also Church of England Schools, Council Schools, Grammar Schools, National Schools, and others, including ""Infant Schools"".  'Infant' is generally used for newborns now, but the term used to refer to a different age range.    Here is the list of schools available in the records.   My preliminary search is turning up Admissions log books.  How can I find out at what ages children might have enrolled in these schools during this time period?  I know the answer for the USA in my own lifetime and afterwards, and I have some sense of the answer for the USA from reading historical novels, but I haven't researched the question for any periods before that in any country (including my own).    As a rough estimate, I can run a query on my database for anyone who was alive at that date, and exclude all the adults, and let the dataset itself answer the question.  But if anyone knows of research guides on the subject or can offer their own expertise, I'd be grateful.     (Afterthought: it might be easier to start with the school-aged children whose names I know from the 1911 Census and simply work backwards from there, rather than running a query. A child born after Census Day in 1911 would be about three in 1914, so their admittance to school would very likely fall outside this data set.)  The admissions registers note whether a student has transferred from another school, which makes these wonderful records to fill in between the census returns for families with school-aged children.  Update: For a description of the records, see the FamilySearch Research Wiki article England Schools under the section ""School Records"".  (This and the other resources in my self-answer were found after Judith posted her answer.) "
1038,Children born overseas to British Subjects -- what is their citizenship status?,"My husband's great-grandparents came to the USA in 1898, and returned in 1904.  While they were in the USA, they had two girls, one born in 1898, the other in 1900.  On the 1911 Census (England), the girls were listed as British Subjects born in the US, like this:    It's difficult to read, but I think it says ""Brit. Sub by Parentage"".  Would their parents have been required to register their births, or might there be any other paperwork re-asserting their status as British subjects?  Would they have been required to renounce their American citizenship?  The older girl died in 1915 before reaching majority, and the younger, as far as I can tell, married another British Subject in 1919 or 1920.    (The parents of this family did not become naturalized citizens while they were in the US.) "
1039,Finding Naturalization Record for Hugh Sellars from Scotland who lived in Albany (New York State) 1855-1872?,"I have asked an earlier question relating to my fourth great grandfather Hugh Sillars/Sellars: Finding evidence for divorce of Hugh Sillars and Agnes Macculloch in mid-19th Century Scotland? who appears to have migrated to the United States from Scotland prior to 1855 because he appears in the 1855 New York State Census:     Hugh Sellars 52, Ship Carpenter, born in Scotland, living at Albany   City, Ward 6, Albany, New York, USA with his wife Mary Sellars 50   (born in England) and four others Harriet Martin 32 Moody M Hale 54   Elizabeth A Hale 18 and Elick Crawford 26   He appears to live in Albany until 1872 because the:   1860 Federal Census Index has him at 9 W. Albany City (Hugh Sellers) 1862-63 Albany Directories have him with a Variety Store and house at 287 Washington Ave 1864 Albany Directory has him with a Variety Store and house at 311 Washington Ave 1866-72 Albany Directories have him with a Variety Store and house at 311 Washington Ave   When and where Hugh died is not known but I suspect it was soon after 1872 and in Albany, because I have found no later records for him, either there or in Scotland.  Is it likely that someone who lived and worked in Albany for at least 17 years (1855-1872) would not have applied to be naturalized?  If so, where would a naturalization record most likely be found?    I have located an 1865 New York State Census record:     Hugh Sellars 60, Ship Carpenter, born in Scotland, living at Albany   City, Ward 6, Albany, New York, USA with his wife Mary Sellars 60   (born in England) and two others: William H Hall, aged 8, recorded as   Hugh's son (?) and Caroline R Foster, aged 7, a Boarder.    Hugh was recorded as having been naturalized which suggests to me that he not only declared his intent but completed the process.    I have also located an 1870 United States Federal Census Record which is very faint but has:     Hugh Sallon(?), Variety Store, aged 67, born in Scotland, with real   estate valued at $700, a citizen of the US, living in Albany   Subdivision 335, Albany City with his wife Mary, Keep House, aged 66,   born in Scotland, with Caroline Foster, At Home, aged 12, born in New   York and Henry R. Elliott, Carriage Maker, aged 25, born in England,   with personal estate of $100.   This further confirms that he was Naturalized. "
1040,Finding alternate indexes or record sets for passenger lists / ship manifests from Germany?,"I'm researching German immigrants to the USA.  Some of their records can be found in NARA's Access to Archival Databases, in this collection:  Data Files Relating to the Immigration of Germans to the United  States, created, ca. 1977 - 2002, documenting the period 1850 - 1897 -  Collection CIR      Part of:  Collection CIR: Records of the Center for Immigration   Research       Function and Use: The Center for Immigration Research   created this series to promote access to information about German   immigrants to the United States. The information was extracted from   ship passenger lists in the records of the U.S. Customs Service (NARA   Record Group 36).       Scope &amp; Content Note: This series consists of   records of 4,048,907 passengers who arrived at the United States   between 1850 through 1897; about 90 percent identified their country   of origin or nationality as Germany or a ""German"" state, city, or   region.   When I find results from this finding aid, I go to Ancestry or the Castle Garden site and try to access the original images there.  Often the index at Ancestry is very different from the index generated by CIR.    I am trying to find alternate records, indexes, and images for this passenger manifest:     (manifest number) 36703 (ship) NECKAR (departure port) BREMEN &amp; SOUTHAMPTON (arrival date) 06/26/1882 [arriving port of New York]   Steve Morse's One-Step Web page for New York arrivals identifies the microfilm as follows:     (Series) M237 (Roll) 454 (Year) 1882 (Month) June (Day) 26  (Frame)   151 (ship)    neckar  (FHL roll)  1027024   Ancestry's database and images of the microfilm from NARA are published as Passenger Lists, 1820-1957 [database on-line].    This voyage is too early for the Bremen Passenger Lists project sponsored by the Bremen Chamber of Commerce and the Bremen Staatsarchiv. The German passenger manifest of this voyage has probably been destroyed.  Has anyone in Germany indexed the US copies of the passenger lists?  This voyage is also too late to be included in the Board of Trade records for outbound voyages (BT27), Passenger Lists Leaving UK 1890-1960 at Find My Past. Do any outbound passenger lists exist for ships leaving the UK earlier than 1890?      It is not clear to me how much the index at CastleGarden.org differs from the databases at NARA, or how much NARA's databases differ from the CD-ROMs of Germans to America.    The FamilySearch Collection United States Germans to America Index, 1850-1897 is described as follows:      Data files relating to the immigration of Germans to the United States   for arrivals 1850-1897. Created by the Balch Institute for Ethnic   Studies, Center for Immigration Research. In August of 2013, the   National Archives replaced the ARC – Archival Research Catalog - with   the OPA – Online Public Access. ARC identifiers will still work to   access the collections in OPA.   This suggests it is the same data that was published by NARA. (see update about the OPA below the dividing line)  The book series Germans to America has known issues -- links to reviews are below:   Michael P. Palmer, Published Passenger Lists: A Review of German Immigrants and Germans to America, Volumes 1-9 (1850-1855) Prof. Dr. Antonius Holtmann published a series of reviews of Germans to America as the books were being published -- see the section entitled Pitfalls in Glazier/Filby: ""Germans to America"" on this page: Publications (both the German originals and translations in English are on this site).   I am indebted to GenWiki's page Germans to America for the links to the above reviews.  One of the volumes of Series II was reviewed by Giles R. Hoyt (Max Kade German-American Center, IUPUI) and spot-checks similar to those made by Prof. Dr. Holtmann and Michael Palmer revealed the same kind of errors.  Whatever the differences may be between NARA's online version and the book or CD-ROMs, it seems likely that the pitfalls may apply to all three -- which is why I was hoping for lists produced in England or Germany that might have been independently created and indexed.  For example, someone whose research subject left Hamburg in 1850 could consult Clifford Neal Smith's Reconstructed Passenger Lists for 1850: Hamburg to Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, and the United States, Parts 1, 2, 3, &amp; 4:     Working from microfilm copies of the Hamburg police lists, Clifford   Neal Smith has here reconstructed the identities of about 7,000   Hamburg passengers whose names were found among 60 separate lists for   the year 1850. For each entry the compiler provides the following   information: passenger's surname, given name, occupation, birthplace,   and reference number from the police register.   The U.S. Customs Service records, which are the only surviving immigration records for the port of New York before 1892, have very limited information compared to the passenger lists from other ports (or from post-1892 New York arrival records).    Also, the handwriting on the extant customs list is not very good.  If I could find any overlapping segment of the passenger list for this voyage, comparing them would help decipher the handwriting on the US Customs Service list.     As of 20 May 2015, the OPA (Online Public Access) at NARA has been replaced by a new catalog at [website]"
1041,Was Robert John Steven Sellers first to cycle Adelaide to Melbourne?,"My 2nd great grandfather Robert John Steven Sellers has been mentioned in an earlier question: Finding New York City/State records relating to Sellars family (British subjects) births/deaths mid 19th century?.  He led an interesting life:   born to Scottish parents in Albany, New York State, USA in 1854, living in New York City around 1857 (when his brother William was born), spending some time in New Grenada (now known as Colombia), Panama  around 1863 (when his brother John was born), living with his aunt in Glasgow after losing his mother (and probably his father) by about 1870, becoming an apprentice seaman by 1871, leaving the sea in 1874 to settle in Melbourne for four years then living in Adelaide for the rest of his life which ended with heart failure in a city street on a very hot day during a visit to Sydney in 1908   His obituary says that he was an enthusiastic cyclist but makes no mention of our family legend which says that he was the first person to cycle from Adelaide to Melbourne, possibly racing against the train.  I have found that such rides occurred by others in 1893 and 1894 without claiming to be the first.  Also, while writing this question I just found another article that confirms that he was cycling from Adelaide to Melbourne on 18 July 1896 but that is clearly not the first such ride nor does it mention an earlier ride.  I suspect that a family story of perhaps ""he was one of the first"" became the legend of ""he was the first, and was racing the train!"".  Does anyone know where I might be able to find out who was the first to complete the ride and when?  If it were him after all, I am assuming that it must have happened between about 1878 (when he moved to Adelaide) and 1893 (when the article above is talking about it being done quicker than previously).  At that time he was between about 24 and 39 years of age so probably at or near the peak of his cycling fitness.    I'm not sure if the direction (Adelaide-Melbourne vs Melbourne-Adelaide) affects my legend but I just found an SA Memory on Early cycling in South Australia which says:     Cycling in Australia developed rapidly after the importation of the   first ordinary or 'penny farthing' bicycle to Melbourne in 1875. A   Melbourne Bicycle Club was formed in 1878 and South Australia followed   in 1881.      The first cycle trip from Melbourne to Adelaide took eight days in 1881.      The bicycle we know today - known then as the safety bicycle - was   introduced to Australia in the late 1880s.      A worldwide cycling craze occurred in the mid 1890s. In 1897 the   number of different brands available in Australia peaked at over 150   spanning the alphabet from Acme to Zimmy. Prices for touring bicycles   dropped dramatically during that decade. About 1897 in rural NSW a new   low priced bicycle cost about the equivalent of four or five weeks   wages for a rural worker.  "
1042,Are there academic studies of genealogists or genealogy networks?,"I am thinking about pursuing a network analysis of the genealogist network on WeRelate.org, and I'm wondering if there is previous literature about genealogist networks in particular, or even just about the attributes and motivations of genealogists.

1043,What are the different type of marriage records used in genealogy research?,I am confused about the different type of marriage records that can be found in my research.  I've seen things such as:   Bonds Banns Licenses Records Certificates   What are the differences between these?  How would I know which one is best to find and use?  How would I know what is available?  Is it based on region and time period? 
1044,"One tree, or a bunch?","I have spent a considerable amount of time creating family trees on Ancestry.com, and documenting them with records found on Ancestry, FamilySearch, and in other web and non-web sources. For a variety of reasons, wound up with more than one tree for the same family (one tree focusing on my mother-in-law's family, and one on my father-in-law's).   In both trees I document not just the immediate descendants, but essentially anyone on whom I can get good evidence, so one of the trees is more like a little forest of inter-married families.  In retrospect, I am wondering if this compartmentalization is a good thing. Would it be better to have a single tree for everyone (containing over 1000 individuals), or separate trees for logical family groupings? What are some less-obvious tradeoffs?   If the answer is to have multiple trees, what is best practice for connecting them, making it easy to jump from one to the next?   How are these decisions different if (as is the case in my trees) there is inter-marriage between families at different generations, creating multiple paths between two family groups/trees? "
1045,"How do you record a person you know existed, but with no (or limited) other details?","The Census of England and Wales 1911 asked for each married woman -- the number of children born alive to this marriage, and the number still living.    This information can reveal the existence of children (living in 1911 or not) in addition to those on the Schedule or already known from other sources.  When I found such an extra sibling to an ancestor, I was inclined to create an entry with the father's surname, dates qualified by before or after, and little else.   This served as a prompt (perhaps even a goad) for me to locate the missing information, but is it considered good practice? Are there better methods than a placeholder for indicating a person about whom (at this time) you know very little?  "
1046,Was Ellis Island the only immigration inspection station in New York in the 1880's?,"This question was brought about by the fact that some of my ancestors immigrated from Russia to New York in the 1880's. The source I have for that fact is a citizenship application. Was Ellis Island the only operating immigration inspection station in New York at the time? If not, what other stations were there? "
1047,Recording same person as foster and adoption parent in Ancestry.com tree?,"The Mildner couple in my tree became foster parents of a young girl in the early 1900s. In 1912, they were sued by the birth mother of the girl for custody, but the judge ruled that the girl could stay with the foster family, after which she was apparently adopted by the family. The adoption was reflected in the change of the girl's last name between the 1910 and the 1920 (and later) censuses.   I had recorded the Mildners as foster parents of the girl. Now if I change the relationship as ""adopted"" I will lose the foster state.   Is there a good way of dealing with this situation other than through extensive notes?   Ancestry.com doesn't seem to provide a way to record date ranges with relationships, and only allows one set of relationships between a parent and a child.   In a comment to a question about names, Jane recommends creating explicit name change records.   How would one do that with Ancestry.com?  "
1048,Where are Illinois County Court records archived?,"According to the Illinois State Genealogical Society newsletter, between 1867 and 1964, adoptions were handled by the County Courts, which were abolished in 1964.   Where does one look now for adoption court files for cases that were handled by these courts? Are these publicly available, or are they only available to direct descendants?  A related question: were proceedings of these courts documented somewhere in digest form that may be more accessible than the originals? "
1049,Finding an elusive ancestor after the 1901 census (who may have deserted his family),"What strategies should I adopt to find an elusive ancestor in the early twentieth century? He may have deserted his family, so I can't rely on records of a wife of children to corroborate identification.  For many years, I thought my great-grandfather [John] Stanley [Reynolds] Wright had a pretty well-documented trajectory through life. Although I hadn't been able to 'kill him off', that was a mere detail for when I had a spare 15 minutes (hah!)  The details I know (or thought I knew):   27 May 1861: Born in Plumstead, Kent, England to parents John Charles Wright and Caroline Ellen Brown. Birth certificate from the GRO shows his name as Stanley Reynolds Wright.  ('Reynolds' is unexplained and is never referenced again that I have found). Source: GRO birth certificate. 1871 census: Living with his father (a widower) in Waltham Cross, Cheshunt, Middlesex (and his older sister and younger bother). His mother died in Feb 1871. He is shown as Stanley Wright. 1881 census: Living with his father and step-mother (and his younger brother) in Kings Norton, Worcestershire. He is shown as Stanley Wright, and his occupation is House Painter &amp;c. 15 April 1883: married Mary Ann Harper at St. Judes Church, Birmingham, aged 21. He is shown as John Stanley Wright, and his occupation is Decorator. Source: GRO marriage certificate. 5 August 1883: Birth of his first child Stanley Charles Wright in Burton Extra, Burton upon Trent. Source: GRO birth certificate. He is shown as Stanley Wright. The birth was registered by his wife Mary. 1885-1891: Birth of children Ellen (Birmingham), Mary (Sutton Coldfield), John (Stapenhill, Derbyshire) Frederick (Stapenhill) Source: 1891 census 1891 census: Living in Stapenhill, Burton on Trent, Derbyshire with his wife and children. He is shown as Stanley Wright and his occupation is House Painter. 1894-1899: Birth of children Susan (Birmingham), Robert (1896 Kings Norton Worcestershire), Frank (Kings Norton), James (Kings Norton).  Source: All 1901 census except Robert born 1896 which is a GRO birth certificate on which the father is shown as Stanley Wright and the birth was registered by Stanley's wife Mary). 1901 census: Living at 40 Highbury Road Kings Norton with his wife Mary and Children (all of whom are living at this point). Occupation: House Painter. 1911 census: Mrs M. Wright is shown as a Widow boarding at 1 Eton Road Balsall Heath (occupation Charwoman) with 5 children: Susan aged 18 (a brushmaker), Robert aged 15, Frank aged 12, Daniel aged 11, Dorothy aged 9 and Ethel aged 8. There's no data given on children born alive/still living/dead.  No sign of sons Stanley and John and Frederick, and daughters Ellen and Mary Agnes (all old enough to be married?).   So: Clearly (!) Stanley Wright the father died between 1901 and 1911 -- more likely after 1902 given there was an 8 year old daughter in 1911.  So I needed to find a death between 1902 and 1911, even if it wasn't coming readily to hand (so to speak). There's no death of a Stanley Wright of anything like the right approximate age between 1902 and 1940 on FreeBMD (the Stanley Charles Wright who dies in 1915 is the son Stanley born 1883).  The real spoke in my wheel came when a cousin in Canada contacted me and told me that Frank Leslie Wright and his younger brother James Daniel and younger sister Dorothy were sent out to Canada as British Home Children because their parents couldn't afford to keep them (with private supporting documentation).  Interesting, I thought, because it told me something about the economic status of my great grand-parents... but then I went looking a little more.  Home Children Records at Library and Archives Canada including the next page tells me that Dorothy, Frank Leslie and James Daniel all went out to Halifax, Nova Scotia on the Carthiginian in 1912, sent by Middlemore Homes which was a charity set up to send needy children from Birmingham to Canada for (supposedly) a better life.  And then I found a source online that summarised the reasons why the children went sent abroad (Library and Archives Canada Search Result in which the parents were reported as separated and the mother was living with 5 children that she couldn't afford to keep. (The 5 children in the 1911 census?)  I can understand why she would tell her landlord in 1911 that she was widowed (more respectable) but tell the Middlemore Home more honestly that she was separated ... but that leaves me with a challenge to find Stanley Wright born 1861 either living or dead in the years post 1902-ish. "
1050,Why were there no Polish given names in Polish village (part of Prussia)?,"In order to find information about my ancestors, I accessed a Catholic church register of a village in the upper part of Silesia, via Family Search. The village, Śmicz, was Polish but was part of Prussia (and, from 1871, the German Empire). The records are from the 1820-1939 time period.  All the records are in German, which is not surprising, considering it was the official language.  What is however more surprising, is that while there is traces of Polish family names, there is absolutely no trace of Polish given names to anyone in the village.  By Polish given names, I mean all the series which ends in -sław, but also other typically Slavic names such as Boris, Marek, Casimir, Lech, etc...  Most given names were extremely unoriginal names that could be used in all languages, such as Joseph, Maria, etc... Not only that, but also some German names, which I do not think can be translated in Polish, were frequent, such as: Georg, Franz, Franziska, Cecilia, Emmanuel, etc...  So, how to explain that? Was there a law that prevented people giving Polish surnames to babies, or were the typical Slavic names just not in fashion in the 19th and early 20th centuries? "
1051,Direct editing of underlying database for Genealogy program?,"I like Gramps, but dislike it from time to time for its complexity when creating events, notes, person etc., too much tabs and submenus.  I would like to be able to edit the underlying database directly (with something looking like the sqlite browser) but this seems to be an imposible thing since Gramps' database has python code combined with its bsddb database, see Directly access Berkeley database for faster editing/updating than via Gramps??  Is there any genealogy program which has a complete but easy (eye candy) interface without this submenus and all? Or is there a program which underlying database I can easily edit? Open-source would be nice, but is not a must have. "
1052,Finding details of where Polish soldier in German Army was living before Great War?,"What I know so far from family sources: My great-grandfather August Masur was polish, and a soldier within the German Army. He surrender to French troops and was made prisoner. Likely he did this on purpose because he didn't want to fight for Germany, but that's a rumour. Very likely this happened at the start phase of the war, in the war of movement, before there was trenches.  He was prisoner in Brittany and was had very good detention conditions. When the war was over, he came to Switzerland and never returned home ever again.  What I figured out from How to find information on German soldiers from World War I and World War II? is that, even though he had an amazing number of namesakes in the German army, I found a card that very likely is his, because his birthdate is noted at the bottom.  Note that a namesake born on the same day is not to be excluded. However, the sheet referenced by this card mentions a prison transfer between two different Brittonian localities, which makes it even more likely that this is my great-grandfather's card.    It appears I can find the regiment he was fighting for: 113th Infantry, 11th company.  I could not find a definitive entry for him in the list of losses (verlurslisten in German language). However, I found an entry that could be him on page 3446. His name and birthplace are severely misspelt (Massur instead of Masur, Schmitzach instead of Schmitsch), but the Company and Infantry numbers seem to match.  What is even stranger is that all the other solders in this page seems to be from Baden, the southwest region of Germany, the region closest to Switzerland, and not at all where he grew up.   Could it be that my great-grandfather was domiciled in that region before the war?  What is missing:  I still have no idea if the entry mentioned above is really him, I have no idea where he lived before the war (most definitely not at home anymore). I don't know why he didn't return home after the war, but instead came to Switzerland with his older brother. "
1053,Burial of a person who committed suicide in 18th century England?,"I have an ancestor who committed suicide in 1748 in rural Northamptonshire, England. The burial register of his parish does not record his burial, but it does note that he ""hung humself lying almost prostrate on his own bed."" I know he was not buried in the churchyard because the number of burials are tallied each year.  This man's widow died about seven years later, but was buried in a nearby parish. It is unlikely she had permanently moved to that parish as the burial register still describes her as of the former parish. This makes me wonder whether her husband's suicide affected where the family decided to have her buried.  What would have been the common practice for burial of a person who committed suicide in the eighteenth century? Are there any records that might contain information about where he was buried? "
1054,Gramps' Prolog Export Function: fancy filter or statistical tool?,"Gramps is one of the most widely used genealogy program as far as I know and has recently seen another addition to its wide array of export features, called prolog as announced here.  Can someone show a more advanced use of prolog in combination with a family tree? Is it a fancy way to filter ones family tree? Or is it possible to conduct statistics with it? What else could be done with prolog and my family tree to enrich my understanding of the genealogical data at hand?  It sounds interesting but I have not understood why a general genealogist would want/need this. Any explanation and enlightenment is highly appreciated! "
1055,Where is Oulu Impijats/Impitaja/Impijas Finland?,"My great grandmother arrived in Quebec on 5 Jul 1907 from Finland.   The ships card showed that she was from Oulu Impijas Finland.  Does anyone know what parish to look for her baptism record in?    I got this record from the Family Search site under Vermont, St. Albans Canadian Border Crossings, 1895-1954  In the same set of records, is the ships records, and it also shows Oulu, Impijas, Finland    I have looked but not yet found her sister, Anna Niemi. "
1056,What are the rules for putting media on different sites?,"I have accounts on many Genealogy Related Sites (FamilySearch, Ancestry, FindMyPast, etc.) and other people are uploading stories and photos to our common ancestors.   Is it okay for me to take photos from Family Search and put them on Ancestry, and Vice versa? Are there some other rules associated with posting it?  "
1057,Using signature comparison as genealogical evidence?,"Often when I am clutching at straws to determine the relationship between individuals or families, I will compare signatures from the relevant documents. There is an inherent bias in my interpretation of this evidence – am I seeing what I want to see? How reliable is signature comparison as a form of genealogical evidence, and how can I make my interpretation more objective?  I will give two examples below which you may refer to in your answer:   Thomas Bourne signatures:       Ralph Hanshaw/Hanshall signatures:      I have reason to believe each of these examples may be signatures of the same man, but I have no definitive evidence one way or the other. Note there was a number of years between the signatures in each case. How might one objectively interpret these? "
1058,Could a beneficiary also be witness to a will?,"I have several wills from 16th/17th century England where a witness to the will had the same name as one of the sons who was a beneficiary in that will. I have always assumed these witnesses were other relatives of the same name rather than the sons.  I would have thought that it would not have been valid or legal for a beneficiary to be a witness to a will, for obvious reasons. However I am unsure where I got this idea into my head and if I am anachronistically  attributing more modern probate laws to this earlier period.  Does ecclesiastical or common law from 16th/17th century England dictate who could and could not be witness to a will? Or was it perfectly acceptable for a son to witness his father's will even if he was one of the main beneficiaries? "
1059,What documentary trail should I expect for a bigamous marriage?,"There is a story in my family about a cousin who had a child just after WW2 (the cousin is deceased and the child doesn't mind details being made public but they aren't necessary to this question).  The mother told everyone for the rest of her life that she had married the father, but only discovered that he had married her bigamously when the police turned up at her hospital bed to tell her the father had died in a motorcycle accident on his way to see his new child, and oh by the way there was another (previous) wife... Personally, I don't believe a word of it, but want to confirm or refute it with evidence.  How should I expect to find the reported marriage and subsequent events recorded? Would any changes have been made to the GRO indices for the marriage when bigamy was identified? And would this have been different if bigamy was identified prior to the death of the bigamous partner?    I will also search for newspaper reports of the fatal accident but don't expect any newspaper coverage of the bigamy as the bigamous individual was dead and thus a little hard to prosecute; if he had been alive when the problem was discovered, newspaper reports of the prosecution would be another angle to investigate. "
1060,Is this Birth Certificate acceptable as proof of surnames?,"I have a copy of a Queensland Birth Certificate for a different individual issued in 2010 for a birth that occurred in 1959.  For the name of the child, there is no surname.  For previous children of relationship, no surname is listed.  The father has a surname shown.  The mother has a first name and a former surname only.  Would this be a mistake by the Registrar-General at time of copying, or do some Queensland Birth Certificates not have this detail.  Can we be certain that any of the children took the father's name?  Can we be certain the mother's former surname was her maiden name? "
1061,"How might a ""nurse-child"" have been placed with their carers?","In the 1861 census of England, the sister of one of my ancestors is shown living as a 'nurse-child' some distance across London from where her mother was in hospital. How would the placement of a nurse-child have been arranged at this time?  (The parents are elusive before 1861 &mdash; no marriage record I can find, and inconclusive census appearances &mdash; so I'm wondering if there might be some family connection to the carers.)    Background info:  Mary Agnes Wright, oldest known daughter of John Charles Wright (1828? - 1904) and Ellen Brown (1829? - 1871) (also known as Caroline Ellen Brown), was born on 3rd July 1859 in Hitchin, Hertfordshire, England. John Wright worked variously during his lifetime as a Grainer, a Painter and Glazier, a Decorator and a Photographer.  Agnes's brother Stanley Reynolds Wright (later known as Stanley Wright or John Stanley Wright) was born on 27th May 1861 in Plumstead, Kent, England.  The family are very hard to find in the census of 2nd April 1861. However, I have come to the conclusion that:   John Wright is a ""Painter on the Tramp"" in Kidderminster, Worcestershire, England. (RG09 piece 2078 folio 27 page 4) Caroline Wright is a Patient at Guys Hospital, Southwark, Surrey (wife of a Journeyman Tailor [sic]) perhaps because of the impending birth. (RG09 piece 316 folio 163 page 3) Agness Wright is a nurse child with the Papworth family in St. Pancras, Middlesex (RG09 piece 105 folio 58 page 28). Of note? Henry Papworth, head of the family was a Painter.   In the 1871 census (2nd April), the family (John, Agnes, Stanley and youngest son George) was reunited in Waltham Cross, Cheshunt). Ellen died on 10th February 1871, also in Cheshunt. "

1063,Finding Expanded Royal Family Lineages,"While aggregating some genealogy data for my family, I recently came across something that has my daughters and I pretty excited.  It would seem that, on my wife's side, there is a traceable lineage to a member of the Royal Family of Denmark.  (In the early 16th century, not the current family.)  I found this in two separate sources, so even if they're fairly questionable it's still worth a deeper look.  Naturally, the first place I went was Wikipedia.  However, her name isn't on that chart.  I wonder, however, if her name would be just outside that chart.  She's referred to as a ""princess"" but that could mean anything, really.  But we all know how wide an actual family tree can be, so it's entirely possible that her name is somewhere adjacent to that direct lineage.  Are there any resources I might be able to check for something like this?  I haven't done a lot of direct research myself, so at the moment I'm just Googling around for sources.  The current royal family has their own website, of course.  And there are other websites dedicated to the same family.  But so far I haven't found anything better than that Wikipedia page.  Note also that her birth would have been pretty close to the space between the first two trees on the Wikipedia page, somewhere around Frederick I or Christian III.  So if there was some sort of changing of the houses around that time then a lot of people may have called themselves a ""princess.""  The actual person in question is listed in The Island Register as ""Princess Biurnag (Bernice) of Denmark"" (DOB unknown) who was married to Aongha Mhartain of Skye, Scotland (born 1558).  They had a son in Skye, Scotland named Taos Gille Mhartain.  (I've sent an email to the address named in the linked source.)  Might there be more expanded lineages that I can dig up somewhere? "
1064,"""Resolution"" of DNA testing","What is the spatial/cultural ""resolution"" of DNA testing for genealogical purposes? How finely can it be used to estimate where a particular person's ancestors were from? I am interested in testing the hypothesis that some of my wife's ancestors who came to the US from the Ukraine had previously emigrated from Germany to the Ukraine. My hypothesis is based on their last names (which are more German-sounding than Russian or Ukrainan), but I am wondering if it would be possible to refute or corroborate it using DNA evidence.   So the basic question is this: does the DNA of Jews from the Ukraine differ from the DNA of Jews living in Germany, and can this difference be detected reliably? "
1065,Preferred file format to exchange images,"I have some old pictures that I want to scan and make available, with all the information that I have about them (like who's in the picture, where it was taken, and so on).  What's the best file format to exchange it? Is it Jpeg ok, or people prefer some other format like tiff ?  And is there some convention on how to write those information, some specific tag that I should use, and so on? "
1066,"Why was Flossie baptised twice (1898,1903) at Stalbridge, Dorset, England?","On 6 September 1903, Flossy Maud Mary Ann Mogg was baptised in Stalbridge Parish Church, Dorset England. Her birth date was given as 10 December 1897, and her parents as Walter Mogg (Farmer) and his wife Ellen. On the same day, the same couple had 2 other children baptised: Harold Charles (born 2 February 1900) and Violet Ellen (born 16 February 1902).  In total, between August 1890 and July 1908, the couple had 8 children baptised in the same church. Or rather 9 children, because on 6 April 1898, Flossie Maud Mogg (born 10 January 1898) was baptised (by the same Rector). Neither of her baptisms are shown as 'private baptism'.  The birth dates given are close enough that this looks like the same child to me; there's also only one record in the GRO indices for a Flossie Maud Mogg born between 1895 and 1905, and no death record.  The 1901 census shows a single family living in Stalbridge with head of household Walter Mogg and wife Ellen; the children present are the five children that the baptismal records say had been born by that time.  So: I'm pretty sure this is one child being baptised twice in the same church by the same Rector. But why? Did the parents and Rector all forget that they had dipped Flossie once? Is it significant that she acquired the additional names Mary Ann the second time around (she didn't use these names when she got married in the same church in 1919, and no other Mary Ann Mogg appears in the records at Stalbridge). Or is there some ecclesiastical reason for baptising somebody twice in the Church of England? "
1067,Citing sources from Facebook and other social media sites,"Today I had reason to cite Facebook as a reference source. I couldn't find any recommendations for such sources, so I'll describe what I did. If anyone has a better method I'd be pleased to hear about it in an answer.  I use Family Tree Maker 2012 and the nearest source template I found was Discussion Forum or List which comes under the category of Publications - Periodicals, Broadcasts and Web Miscellanea. I considered Blog but rejected it, because I wanted to treat the whole of Facebook as a single source and not have to have a source for every individual.  The template for Mailing lists and Online forums results in a source record that looks like this (I've shown the entries I used for Facebook):   Then having created my source, the citation dialog looks like this:   (I've removed all the personal details of the living person I was researching).  That results in a reference note of:  Personal profile for &lt;person&gt;, accessed 2013-01-24 by TPL. &lt;Person name&gt;,  went to &lt;school&gt;; lives in &lt;place&gt;; &lt;relationship status&gt; with &lt;other person&gt;; from &lt;place of birth&gt;; etc.... [website]I also take a screen snipping and attach it under the Media tab, because Facebook information is likely to be ephemeral.  So that's my technique. Clearly it isn't ideal as the reference note reads slightly awkwardly, and Facebook isn't a 'discussion list' really. So how have you done it better? Has someone designed a source template specifically for Facebook and other social media sites? "
1068,"How do I parse this citation into a source, citation detail and citation text?","I've discovered some useful information on FamilySearch.org, and they very helpfully provide a full citation for each record. An example of one I'm specifically interested in is this one:     ""England, Births and Christenings, 1538-1975,"" index, FamilySearch   ([website]  2013), William Long, 18 Jan 1833; citing Berkeley, Gloucester,   England, reference yr 1813-1826 p 108; FHL microfilm 855612.   I'm fairly inexperienced with citations but I'm learning fast, and web sites giving ready-made citations like this is a massive help, but to sanity check what I'm doing, I have the following questions.  Which parts of this citation are the source, the citation detail and citation text? I'm using Family Tree Maker 2012 which has templates based on those presented in the book Evidence Explained by Elizabeth Shown Mills. Which of those templates best matches this style of citation? They are based on American data so it is not always obvious.  Also, the rating of this evidence is important. FTM provides a 4-star rating system where each star represents:   Original or Derivative Clear or Marginal Primary or Secondary Direct or Indirect   My asumptions for the above record were:   Derivative - because the database is a transcription of the original records Clear - because the facts are clearly legible Seconday - because the transcribe didn't have 1st hand knowledge of the facts Direct - because the date of baptism is plainly stated   Do you agree with my classification? Interestingly there is a duplicate record for this baptism, for 13th Jan instead of 18th Jan. 13 and 18 might be easily confused so I can see how this conflicting evidence would arise, but it is odd to find two conflicting records within the same database. "
1069,WW2 Royal Navy Patrol service records mystery,I have a copy of my Great Uncle's sevice record and I'm really stuck on finding out one of the base/ship he is listed as serving with. He sadly died due to illness while on active service in 1943 and is buried in Trinidad and Tobago.   The problem is on his service record it states on the 9th August 1941 he moved from HMS Paris (land base) to Caman. The next entry states Died 7th June 1943 Benbow which makes sense given he died while serving on motor launches from HMS Benbow. The real frustrating part is that I just can not find any reference to a Navy base/ship called Caman.  I've posted on a number of websites but no one has been able to solve this mystery. Is it possible it was written by mistake or does it refer to something else than a ship ????  Any ideas would be fantastic because I've hit a complete brickwall.  Kind regards Adrian 
1070,looking for information on a marriage that took place in russia,"My fathers parents where from poland, We know they escaped to Russia (sibir?) just before WWII and got married there.

1071,Finding more information about Rhode Island grave stone bearing date range 1897-1923?,"Some ancestors of mine immigrated to the US. Jose Correia in 1915 and afterwards his wife, child and mother-in-law.  It seems his wife died while in labor and afterwards the family came back to Portugal. But his wife was definitely buried in the US.  I have found registers of Jose Correia entering the US, but I didn't find the immigration records of the women that went afterwards.  I might have found the grave of his wife Maria Lucinda.   They didn't give her surnames in Portugal, most probably because her father was declared unknown. Anyways the date of birth matches exactly the name on the following grave. Maria L. Correia could be Maria Lucinda. This grave is in the Precious Blood Cemetery in Woonsocket, Rhode Island. It seems to be a catholic cemetery and I called the local parish and unfortunately they couldn't say anything about the grave since there was a fire in the 1950s where they lost a lot of records. I also didn't find anything on familysearch.org which I believe has extensive information about vital records of Rhode Island.    I'm a bit stuck here. How can I find more information about this grave afterwards?(there's nothing online about them) I have his SSN number, I know his address in Woonsocket back then because he was drafted for WWI and WWII. I also know the precise date of Maria Lucinda's birthday and where she was born in Portugal.  List of facts that I have that make me think she is Maria Lucinda:       From the Portuguese christening record I know Maria Lucinda was born on 30 March 1897. It matches the information on the grave.     Yes, there are a lot of records for Maria Correia's since these are common Portuguese names. But there aren't much records for Maria Lucinda and the abbreviation on the grave matches her second name (Lucinda).     It's a known fact in the family that she died in the United States. I know she registered a child in Portugal in January 1916 and that this child also went to the US with Maria Lucinda very early in life.     Her husband was drafted for WWI and he had an address in Woonsocket in Woonsocket in 1917. So I can expect her to be around Woonsocket in 1923, which is where the grave is located. Here's the registration draft:     If you want to give me advice about how I can find more information about Maria Lucinda online, I'd like that. But what I'm really asking is which registry or archive I need to reach out for to ask if they know something about this grave. "
1072,Establishing link between 7th cousins using DNA?,"In linking two branches of my family a male sibling relationship in 1705 is somewhat questionable.   Following male lines back to that period, through seven generations, can DNA analysis be reliably used to establish a positive link?   If so, what specific test would give the greatest level of certainty? "
1073,Checking Daughters/Sons of the American Revolution (DAR/SAR) lineages?,"Two different applications for SAR (Sons of the American Revolution), both crediting the same sources, state the same person born on the same date and serving in the same militia as having been born in two different states.    This leads me to think that, while lineages might be correct, that accompanying marriage dates and locations may have some inherent unreliability.   How can I check these (and DAR = Daughters of the American Revolution) lineages?  The particular person is one Josiah Elston who served in the New Jersey Militia, as noted in the SAR application of Jack Russell Smith to the California Society of SAR, membership #84376.  "
1074,Finding where a marriage took place from the GRO index reference?,"This is a worked case study and is intended as a supplement to the related question Finding Devon parish marriage records?.  There are two different websites which offer help with determining the location of the Anglican church where a marriage took place by entering the GRO index reference.  Surname Society Church Marriage Finder  The Surname Society offers a Church Marriage Finder -- about their databse, the site says:     The database contains details of marriages between 1837 and 1911 and is not yet complete.

GOONS' Marriage Locator  The Guild of One-Name Studies (GOONS) has a Marriage Locator Database which also allows you to enter the GRO index and deduce where the marriage took place.  However, their website cautions:     The Marriage-Locator Database currently contains 613,844 marriage-locator  > points (of which 327,679 are 'cardinal points') in   1,336 Registration Districts.      This is still a work in progress, and not all the data needed for all   marriages is yet available. New data is continually being added.   Their statement of Marriage Locator - the principles explains how the locator works -- it is similar to the process described in What &quot;hidden&quot; clues are there in the GRO Indexes of births and deaths?  The marriage I want to know more about is an 1878 registration for Hannah Knowles.  The marriage was registered in Kingsbridge (Devon) Registration District, Vol 5b Page 328. Ancestry lists the following people for that page:   Name James Bickford Edward Edwards Hannah Knowles Elizabeth Stone     The Surname Society's Finder is not going to help because the database does not have entries from the Kingsbridge RD.  When I entered the GRO Reference into the GOONS Marriage Locator, I got the following message:     Marriage Locator Search Results      GRO Index: 1878 quarter 1, volume 5b, page 328:      Sorry, we cannot locate the church for this marriage. The entry is   located between entries for Stokenham (RD: Kingsbridge) and Newton   Ferrers (RD: Plympton).   Their principles page explains how the volunteers build up the database:     For each of the churches within that RD, they take the following   steps:         First, identifying the earliest marriage in a quarter for a church, and noting down the names of the bride and groom.   Doing the same for the last marriage in the quarter.   Finally, using an online service, or FreeBMD, to find the page numbers where those two marriages have been indexed. These two page   numbers, representing the first and last marriages in a quarter, are   what have been termed the ""Cardinal Points"" for that church.      The widow Hannah Knowles that I am looking for is associated with Aveton Gifford.  I have access to images to the parish register via DevonFHS.  Can I use this information to cross-check the GOONS marriage locator, to see whether they have already established the ""Cardinal Points"" for that register? "
1075,Deciphering Irish Locations & Names (1873 Marriage License),"I have a marriage record from Burt County Nebraska for my Great Great Grandfather.  I'm having trouble with the handwriting, and would appreciate any help in deciphering it.  Specifically, I know from other sources that the groom was born ""near Tralee, County Kerry, Ireland"".  Can anybody make out the actual location written on this document?    I am also finding it difficult trying to decipher the mothers' maiden names.  First names appear to be Ellen and Jane.  But the last names aren't coming together for me.  Thoughts?    The full document is available for download here if anyone wants a closer look at it.

While there are a number of reasons why I might not be able to find them, one that I have not yet ruled out is that they were serving in the military abroad.  At the time of the 1901 census, the Second Boer War (1899-1902) was near its height.  How many (or what percentage of) British men and women were serving in the Boer War at the time of the 1901 census, and are therefore not enumerated on that census? Should I consider it likely that a missing woman on the 1901 census may have been a nurse or otherwise serving in the Boer War? Any additional demographic data (age, occupation, etc.) about those serving in the Boer War would be a bonus. "

1081,Tracing relationships on FamilySearch's Family Tree through more than 15 generations?,"Why can FamilySearch.org Family Tree trace relationships only up to 15 generations?    If I find an ancestor who is 15 generations removed, the site will show me exactly how I am related, and will trace the lineage.  But if s/he is more than 15 generations removed, it will not trace the lineage.  Working back from myself, sometimes through the paternal line and sometime through the maternal line, I found an ancestor 19 generations removed, but now I can't find him again.    Any ideas for solving? "
1082,Different genetic relation strength through maternal vs paternal line?,"Is there a different genetic relation strength through maternal vs paternal line? In other words:   am I more related to my mother than to my father or are they exactly equal?  Or another way to ask it is am I any less related to my mother's mother's mother than to my father's father's father? If I branch off my family tree through my maternal grandmother's mother (Gen N), then is my genetic connection to my paternal grandfather's father the same?  "
1083,How likely is it that I am related to a specific person who was living 20 or 30 generations ago?,"I have discovered that I am related to someone specific who lived in 1066.  How likely is this? In other words, the answer could be “No big deal. When you go back that many generations,the math shows that you are X percent likely to be related to anyone, where X is large - say 50-90% - because you have so many ancestors and the population then was so small.” Or the answer could be “WOW, that’s significant. Because the likelihood of that is small, where X is low.” So maybe the general question is “What is the likelihood that Person A, living now, is related to Person B, living in 1066?” And to specify even more narrowly, let’s constrain to the European/ Scandinavian/ Finnish populations that existed then. "
1084,Is longest cM a better predictor of relatedness than total cM for Ashkenazi Jews?,"As an Ashkenazi Jew, I'm used to matches being predicted to be closer than they really are. My father recently got a match to an adoptee of 348.3 shared cM, with a longest segment of 57.4 cM (according to MyHeritage.com). Because of Ashkenazi endogamy, I've learned not to pay too much attention to shared cM; however, I've never seen such a long segment for someone not already known to be related. Can I ""trust"" longest shared segments more than total shared segments?   While longest shared segment seems more robust, I know enough statistics to understand why it would vary more than total shared segments. I also see empirically that I share the same longest segment of 57.4 cM, but my total shared DNA with the adoptee is 249.3 cM.  If so, where is the best place to find estimates of relatedness based on longest shared cM? I couldn't find anything at ISOGG, but I did find The Shared cM Project. The latest update appears to be based solely on total shared segments, not longest shared segment, but the 2015 post The Shared cM Project – Longest Shared Segment seems to provide what I want. Blaine Bettinger divides the data into endogamous and non-endogamous categories, using this question on the data entry form to classify people: ""Is there any endogamy or known cousin marriages that could impact the amount of shared DNA for this particular relationship?"" As a member of an endogamous ethnicity with no known cousin marriages (on that side of the family), I'm not sure which data would apply.  UPDATE  I believe I've identified the birth father, by intersecting the information from the adoptee with my family tree. Consistent with aem's prediction and the linked data, the adoptee would be my father's second cousin once removed and my third cousin. "

1087,Taking endogamy into account when analyzing DNA matches?,How can I be certain how closely I actually relate to my cousin matches when I know that I have a person in my tree who is my 4th Great Aunt on my Father's Maternal side.  This same person is possibly my 4th Great Grandmother on my Father's Paternal side.  How would endogamy affect my matches to her descendants?  How much more closely would we appear to match? 
1088,Strategies for finding biological grandparents using DNA matches?,"I need some advice to help track down my biological grandmother. My father was adopted in 1920 and died in 2000 without knowing the identity of his biological parents. I have his birth certificate but I am not certain that the name of his mother is her real name. I DNA tested with Ancestry and found 1000+ matches. To my surprise, one shared 1752 centimorgans with me. By process of elimination, he has to be a hitherto unknown half-brother. I am certain he is on my father’s side because none of my cousins on my mother’s side who tested with Ancestry share matches with him. I have tried to contact him but have not heard from him. It would be nice if I could have him upload his raw data to GEDMatch but I do not expect to hear from him. I did find matches for people at 222, 169, 140, 64, and 60 centimorgans all of whom were kind enough to allow access to their family trees. By filling out my tree with their information I was able to locate my paternal grandfather. All of these people fell into the proper place on the genealogy chart based on the centimorgans we share.  On Ancestry there are 5 matches I know to be maternal cousins. I used them to eliminate shared matches leaving what should be paternal matches. I’m not sure if I am on the right track but I also eliminated those that matched with the half-brother leaving matches that, theoretically, should only be to my paternal grandmother’s family.   Am I on the right track here or am I missing something?   Additionally, how should I use the information about the half-brother to trace up family trees and back down to find my grandmother?   I’m just not sure how far back to go or what relationship to look for. "
1089,Can half-siblings show different relationships to extended family?,"My husband has found a half sibling, first on Ancestry showing a match of 1542 cm over 77 segments, and then confirmed on 23andme with a suggested relationship of ""half sibling"". Ancestry only showed ""close family - 1st cousin"" so the 23andme test was done to confirm.    Neither of them knew their birth father, and both of their mothers have similar stories about where they met him, his background, etc. Both mothers are American with European background, but the birth father had arrived from a different country shortly before they were born (and DNA shows they both have almost 50% of this nationality, which their mothers do not have).    They are 4 years apart in age, so we had ruled out grandparent relationships. Based on the accounts of the birth father's age, aunt/uncle is not possible.  But on 23andme, my husband and his half sister show different family relationships with extended family on that side.    For instance my husband has two ""2nd cousins"" sharing about 3%, while his half sister shows these relatives as 3rd to 4th cousins, sharing 1% or less. Another relative shows 3rd cousin to my husband but 5th to her. Is this likely to happen with half siblings, due to how the DNA is distributed? Or does it mean something else? "

(and?) Annie daughter of William"" - I can't see anything that looks like ""Lorberg"" there.  Am I missing something, or looking in the wrong place?

1095,"Is Tanguay's ""Dictionnaire Genealogique"" considered to be reliable?","Fr. Cyprien Tanguay's Dictionnaire généalogique des familles canadiennes depuis la fondation de la colonie jusqu'à nos jours (Montréal: Eusèbe Senécal, 1871-1890) covers many of my French-Canadian ancestors from the 17th and 18th centuries. In many (most?) cases, his is the only source I have been able to find. (I'm an amateur with a very limited research budget...)  Wikipedia says:     Although his dictionary does contain some errors and occasional speculations on possible relationships for which no evidence was known to Fr. Tanguay, his work is of a high calibre and has withstood the passage of time exceedingly well.   This statement does not cite any references, so I'm not sure what experts think.   Do experts still consider his work to be sound? How likely is my research to contain errors where my sole source for facts is Tanguay? I'd also be interested in knowing if there is some collection or critique of his work that would enumerate the errors or speculations. In the absence of access to original records, what are the risks of relying upon Tanguay's Dictionnaire?  "
1096,"When a genealogist decides to formally publish their years of family history research, are the privacy concerns the same as for online publication?","Specifically, are they allowed to include in the publication mention of family members that are living?  Does this also apply to less formal print publications, such as binders created at family reunions? Many family clans create publications that include details about birth, death, milestone dates such as graduation, place of residence, etc. of multiple members of the family (living or deceased). Some members are included in this information whether they attend the reunion or not (perhaps their info is added by a well-meaning Aunt Mabel). Are the privacy rules here the same as for online publication? How would they differ?  NOTE: There have been numerous questions about the right to publish information online, but I'm wondering how this differs for bound print publications. If Aunt Mabel decides to write a book, can she include me in her story about the clan? "

1098,"Sharing research results, getting credit","Say you've spent a considerable amount of time, and perhaps some money as well, documenting a set of families. The work has paid off, and one of the rewards is to share it with people who may be living descendants of those documented by your research.   The problem is that once you publish your research on a public web site of your choice, nothing prevents other (well-meaning) people&mdash;often your relatives!&mdash;from copying your work without attribution and incorporating the metadata and images related to the records you uncovered into their trees.   In some areas of human intellectual endeavor (e.g., academic publishing), this would be considered plagiarism. In other areas Creative Commons or other licensing may be used to allow reuse but to require people to give credit to the authors of the documents or other artifacts (e.g., software source code).  How should genealogists approach this situation? I can imagine several possible tactics, each with its own trade-offs:   Don't publish anything in machine-readable ways. Making it difficult to incorporate information into other people's trees will deter some people; those who are not deterred are much more likely to cite the source. The downside is that fewer people will see the information because it will not be as easy to find, and that re-typing information from it (using it as a source) will be a source of errors. Publish machine-readable information, but do so with privacy settings that require others to ask for documents. This makes it easier to keep track of who gets the information, and you might be able to ask them to attribute to work appropriately. No guarantees, of course. Publish machine-readable information publicly, and contact those who use your information after the fact to ask them to give due credit. They are less likely to bother, but it does benefit more people who have access to the evidence you have collected. Don't care about who does what. After all, as we used to say in an early (and successful) non-genealogical research project I was involved in, ""your ideas will be stolen, whether they are yours or not.""   I am curious to know which of these, or what other, solutions people have adopted, and if there are ways in which we can change best practices in the field to reward the effort that goes into our research.  Clarification:  Many of the excellent answers below had assumed a more polished form of publication than I had intended to convey in my question. I was referring merely to the accumulation of historical records associated with people in a tree, such as one that might be maintained at Ancestry.com. Clearly the copyright-able aspect of this is not the individual record, but the accumulation of such records to document an individual's (or a family) history. My gut feeling about this is that since it may have taken a considerable effort to put this together, that effort should be recognized. That was the point of my question: how best to protect that intellectual (and modest financial) effort? "
1099,Tracking family names and migration patterns using GIS?,"I posted a question, Using web mapping and geocoding to track genealogical data, over at Geographic Information Systems SE awhile ago, so I was quite excited when I saw the proposal for this site. I realised that my question has two components, namely the GIS side and the genealogical side, which is why I thought I would post the relevant part here.  Over the last year, I have gotten involved in researching my family tree. My paternal grandfather came from a remote island in the Atlantic, along with hundreds of others of his generation, and many of them settled within the same area. As the island is very small, they shared a small number of family names (a few dozen surnames, with multiple variations of the same name).   The recently established Society has compiled a small contacts database of known descendants living in the city (and by extension, any family members who are in other parts of the country as well). At the moment, all they have is the basic contact details of the individuals, and once every few months, a meeting is held to touch base with everyone.   Coming from a GIS background, I know the Society can benefit greatly from my mapping skills to keep track of the descendants, and eventually start tracing back the family trees spatially. What I would like to know is, from a genealogical viewpoint, is simply starting with known family surnames enough? What data should I request from the Society members? I don't want to broadly request ""all the data you have"", as it would add too much complexity at this stage.  To clarify, I would not be keeping track of the family relationships per se, but more a case of ""out of the 20 Jones who originally arrived here, there are now 300 Jones families"" etc. I would be relying on the other members of the society to provide the genealogical data, while I would build up and analyse the spatial information. "
1100,Reducing cost of BMD Certificates in England and Wales?,"The cost of BMD certificates from the General Records Office (GRO) of England and Wales is quite expensive (£9.25 at time of writing) but what is preventing the obvious streamlining of this?  The GRO, now part of the Identity and Passport Service, only send copies of certificates by post, and they're on fancy paper with an official stamp at the bottom. This works OK, even with international postage, although it usually takes a couple of weeks for them to arrive. Even with this cost, though, the GRO claim the process is losing money (hence the previous price increase).  There have been a number of discussions about doing electronic, research-only certificates by email, and even a recent petition (BMD ePetition) but I'm not aware of anything happening in response.  The advantages seem obvious to me: digital copies mean savings on paper, printing and postage. There must be some type of electronic scan in process now so why not persist the images and index them for potential further use. This would contribute to an image database from which the GRO could leverage further monies in the future. Furthermore, since people (including me) would be more inclined to buy extra certificates at the lower cost then the GRO might actually make more money, and also save further money by having to do less manual searches on behalf of people.  Is the lack of movement due to bureaucracy, legislation, or some other obstacle? "

1103,What is the Russian town in this census listing?,"I'm trying to determine my (step-)grandparents' birth place from the 1916 Canadian Census. The relevant portion is this:    For context, here is the entire record. The people in question are listed as Louis Keslar (line 3) and Sara Keslar (line 4).  I've been struggling with this since February when I discovered the record. The transcription of the information at the Ancestry.com page lists the towns as ""Ogec, Russia"":    Clearly, the town name could be interpreted many different ways just from the handwriting and Oyic is quite possible as well. The key thing is that the spelling will not be correct. Louis and Sara did not write the name of the town and wouldn't have been able to spell it in English. They would have just said it to the census taker with their accents and the census taker wrote what it sounded like as best as possible with very poor handwriting.  The clues I know that I've used to try to pin this down:   They were Jewish and it was most likely a town with a lot of Jewish people. They were born around 1878 and 1876 and came over in 1904 and 1906. Russia back then had extended boundaries and included much of today's Poland and more They spoke Yiddish and the town's actual name could have been in Polish or Russian script.   The difficulty is that only Louis and Sara came over, with no other family and no one else from their town came with them. Louis was escaping the army in 1904 and Sara joined him in 1906. Determining the town will ultimately unleash a whole new frontier of discovery. I have not yet tracked down their ships records, which is a laborious task, since none of the Canadian ship records are indexed. It is a matter of manually going through the microfilms one by one. I'll need a month minimum to do so. But the information in Canadian ships records are not usually helpful, except for seeing the people before and after, who they might have come with. In their case, I suspect they came alone and the ship's records in my mind will most likely show that.   There is still the possibility that they may have changed names when they came over, if they were afraid of being traced by the army. We don't know of any contact they had with anyone back in Russia after they came over. To the people who remembered them, they never talked about Russia or relatives.   The only other major clue I had was a picture of Louis in the Russian Czar's army which I asked about in Extract Facts from an Army Portrait. The clue it provided is that the picture was taken in Chelm. In a comment in that question, I said (incorrectly) that this record said ""Osek"" which with the record now displayed above, clearly was incorrect. The ""eureka"" in that question was that I thought the town might be Osiek, which is not too far from Chelm.   I followed that up checking out the Osiek listing at the Poland Jewish Records Indexing site, and I have been in contact with Orit Lavi, the town leader. As it turns out, there is no Kessler or Katkow (Sara's maiden name) or anything similar in Osiek. There are at least two other significant towns named Osiek near enough to Chelm, but now my hope that the town was named Osiek is diminishing.  Going back again to the original town: ""Ogec"", ""Oyec"" or whatever. The real problem is that so many towns have the same or similar names in the Poland/Russia area. I've gone through the JewishGen Gazetteer numerous times to try all possible similarly-sounding town names. The problem with any one sound is you either get zero towns listed, or you get dozens.   Examples from the JewishGen Gazetteer:  ""Ogec"" gives nothing. ""Oyec"" gives a town near Mongolia (very unlikely) ""Osec"" gives 70 matches, most of which are in Poland.  The ""j"" sound in Russian is written by two Cryllic characters.pronounced ""zh"" which may make finding the current name of the town difficult.   So yes, I see I've got a lot of research ahead of me.  But what I'd like to know in this question, is if anyone sees any clues in the discussion above that I have missed to help me identify or narrow down which town this may be.  "

The population in 1800-1820 was just over 200 according to [website]John James (1771? - 1857) was a miller and Baptist preacher who lived at Trecwn Mill, Llanfair Nant Y Gof from at least 1797 (according to Pembrokeshire Land Tax records, the Tithe apportionments for the parish in 1838, the censuses of 1841 and 1851,  and the death burial and probate records for John).  In censuses from 1841 on, his wife's name was recorded as Mary and her birth year as circa 1771. She died in 1851. The censuses show the family having children between 1798 and 1815; there may be earlier children of whom I have found no trace yet. As the family were Baptists, none of the children's births were recorded in the registers of the local Parish Church. I don't know what chapel they worshipped at, but in any case the survival of Baptist chapel records in this area of Pembrokeshire is very poor.  (The couple were buried in the local parish church, so there is no clue from that as to where they worshipped).  The marriage of John and Mary would have taken place in the local Parish Church, but the Parish Registers for Llanfair Nant Y Gof don't survive before 1801. There are a handful of earlier Bishops Transcripts, but none for the period when the couple would have married.    There are no property transactions for which records survive at Pembrokeshire RO or the National Library of Wales involving the mill at Trecwn which might shed light on the family.  There are no wills or other records at TNA that shed any light.  In 1809, the will of John Francis of Treberva in Llanfair Nant Y Gof was made and proven (viewable online at The National Library of Wales). In this will, he leaves money to his eldest daughter Mary the wife of John James.  It may also be relevant that John and Mary James named a daughter Frances.  Although there are other John James in Llanfair Nant Y Gof in the early 1800s, there is no other John James married to a Mary. What steps can I take to prove or disprove that Mary wife of John James of Trecwn Mill is also Mary eldest daughter of John Francis of Treberva?  Both Trecwn Mill and Treberva are shown on the 1838 tithe map of the parish and are half a mile apart. "
1105,Where are genealogical data standards futures currently being discussed/developed?,"   Possible Duplicate:   What standards exist for the exchange of genealogical information?       The GEDCOM standard has been moribund for many years since it was abandoned by the Mormon church.  There have been a number of efforts to create a more robust and feature-full standard, but they've all collapsed under their own weight before achieving critical mass.  One such effort was the Gentech Data Model developed in 1998 as the core of a next generation standard.  The answers to the related question What standards exist for the exchange of genealogical information? mention a number of more recent efforts including OpenGen, BetterGEDCOM, FHISO, and GEDCOM-X.  Are there any other alternatives to GEDCOM being actively developed?  Where are they being discussed?

1106,Finding pre-1900 German records?,"I've searched the internet quite a bit, but I'm still unable to usefully find any information on my German relatives - mostly due to the language barrier. I'm looking for records around the early 1900's and back.  In the English speaking world there are a few big names in Genealogy such as the Ancestry sites, but does the same apply for German records? Is there a well stocked website that can help me?  Berlin is the only area I know for definite that I have ancestors, but I'm told that there have been some in the south of Germany too. "
1107,Transitioning from person-based genealogy to record-based genealogy?,"When we start genealogy we know the persons who are closest to us in time so we are comfortable using software where each person record is a unique ""conclusion"" person. We create a person record for each real person as we add them, and then we add additional facts and events to those records as we learn more. This style of genealogy is called ""person based genealogy.""  When we get farther back in time we can no longer be sure about the exact persons that the evidence  refers to, so we must collect evidence from as many record sources as we can, and only when we think we understand the proper set of persons and relationships that best fit the evidence, can we create the conclusion person records. This style of genealogy is called ""record based genealogy.""  In a nutshell, person based genealogy is when you create your person records first and add facts and events later. Record based genealogy is when you must collect the evidence first and only later, when you have enough evidence to make decisions, can you create the person records.  Today's software systems are based on person based genealogy. Every person record in a database is assumed to be a unique person, and if you discover that two records are the same person your immediate reaction is to merge them.  But when you get far enough back that you must use record based genealogy, you are faced with the problem of recording all the facts and events before you know enough to create the person records to attach the facts and events to.  How do you store the evidence you have collected before you have enough to confidently decide who are the real persons being mentioned?  Personally I use ""persona"" records for this, but there must be lots of other options. Many of the experienced genealogists here have obviously faced this issue and have come up with their own unique solutions.  The question is: How do you store evidence about persons, once you have reached the transition into record based genealogy, so before you know enough to create the conclusion person records that the evidence applies to? You HAVE the evidence. You don't yet know what PERSONS the evidence BELONGS to. How do you STORE the evidence so you can find it and evaluate during the decision process? "

1109,Did uncle of Grace Martin Wills (or perhaps of Matthew Nettell) own the Gosforth?,"Quite a detailed story of the arrival of my 2nd great grandparents Matthew Nettell and Grace Martin Wills in South Australia came down to me via my late mother.  The story, as I recall it, says:     Both were only children who eloped to marry in Australia, causing   their parents to disown them.  They were aided in their passage by   Grace's uncle who owned a ship called the Gosforth which carried them   to Port Adelaide where they were married two days later on Christmas   Day 1865.   It's a nice story, with elements of truth, but after failing to find any evidence of their marriage in South Australia, I obtained their marriage certificate showing that they married before leaving England on 23 Sep 1865 at Redruth, Cornwall.  Grace gave her age as 17 (I think it was just over 16 and half), and Matthew gave his as 19.    The marriage seems to have been witnessed by Grace's brother George Wills and her new sister-in-law Eliza Ann Wills (see Finding identity of Eliza Ann Wills who witnessed marriage of Grace Martin Wills and Matthew Nettell in 1865 at Redruth, Cornwall?).    In any event, at least one member of the Wills family seems to have been part of the marriage ceremony which to my mind means it was not an elopement.   Matthew was the 6th of 9 children to Edward Nettell and Maria Hocking, and Grace was one of 11 children to George Wills and Frances Angove, so both were far from only children.   Matthew and Grace Nettell are listed amongst the passengers who arrived in Port Adelaide on the Gosforth on 23 Dec 1865 so that part is confirmed!  To confirm or refute whether an uncle (of either Grace or Matthew) owned the Gosforth, I am keen to find out who did own the Gosforth at the time of this voyage in 1865.  There is considerable information about this voyage of the Gosforth at the TheShipsList but it does not include the owner.  Is there another likely record source that I could use to find who it was?    I'll try to add here what I know of the occupations for any of the uncles, but Ancestry is down at the moment.  My recollection is that the occupations I know of are not in the vicinity of ship owning. "
1110,"Reports of Run Aways, Homeless Children, Orphaned Children in ~1815-1830 PA?","I have a significant gap in my lineage and am trying to determine additional sources to check to make the linkage.   The story goes that my many greats grandfather born in 1815 was a run away and there is no record of whom his parents are or were. One story goes he was lent out as a young child, possibly due to being orphaned, illegitimate, but somewhere in his teens ~1826-1835 he ran away and settled in Western Pennsylvania where he spent the rest of his life.   I have made some attempts to contact the Historical Society of PA researchers (was not overly impressed with their feedback as they didn't provide me anything new and only confirmed information I provided and already had sources for) and didn't come up with anything new.   I also did some online searches for orphanage records for of couple of the counties he may have potentially come from, including someone with the same last name that died leaving his children. I have a suspicion he may have adopted his last name from this individual as I can account for this individuals children's lineage and time/place work out.   To clarify he was Caucassion and his youngest child that died young spelled their last name differently than recorded on Census both with the more German spelling of Sausser vs. Souser. All children after that and his are spelled Souser. His name was Joseph Souser with no middle name known.  Note: Edited to be more specific to my research on request as original request was meant to be more general so it could help others as well.  ~Timeline:   Born April 1815; probably Pennsylvania but not a 100% sure of that. Confident with birth date.  Answered place of birth on census as ""PA"".     (assumed)  1821 there is a death of a someone named ""Sauser""/""Sausser"" that had another child born 1813 in Berks Co., PA that survived. No mention of second child in documents I have encountered so far in any documents. ~1826-1828 Believed have ran away and story goes he swam across the Susquehanna River; possibly 'bound out' up to that time before then. Location Unknown.  1840 Registered place of residence is St. Claire Twp, Bedford, PA. I've checked with them they don't know where he came from. 1840 Either before 1840 or after 1840 he was a Shoemaker's apprentice 1860 Census forward a farmer. 1840+ I have pretty definitive records including record of marriage.   So my questions are:   Where could I check to determine someone registering or finding some information they had taken someone in (perhaps a run away or a orphan) by the person who took them in's name (and preferably also with a child first name and age at least) but not necessarily adopt them?  Is there a register of assistance, run away, or something like that of church or societies that existed listing names of those assisted but not necessarily they placed into a home.  Is there a register of apprenticeship agreements / or 'took someone in' (not adoption) that was required by law or was general best practice then?  "
1111,"Seeking marriage record for James Slight and Elizabeth Boyd from late 1820s probably near Haddington, East Lothian, Scotland?","I have mentioned my 3rd great grandfather William Slight before in Finding Edinburgh map engraver apprenticeship records of William Slight in 1840s? and am continuing to pursue his baptism record in Seeking baptism record for William Slight, born ca 1832 near Haddington, East Lothian, Scotland?  Here I am looking for the marriage of his parents, my 4th great grandparents, James Slight and Elizabeth Boyd, which I deduce to have occurred in the late 1820s at or near Haddington.  From William's Marriage Certificate I know that his father was James Slight a Mason.  The 1841 Scotland Census verifies James (40; Mason J[ourneyman]), Elizabeth (40), Susan (11), William (9) and James (5) Slight living at Court Street, Haddington.  Note: FindMyPast gives their surname as High - they seem to be missing from Ancestry)   William had a sister, Susan Boyd Slight who, according to her Marriage Certificate was the only daughter of late James Slight, Mason, Haddington), when she married Robert Bruce Ewart (a Mason) on 4 Jun 1852 at Saint Cuthberts, Edinburgh.  Her 1873 Death Certificate in Victoria, Australia records her parents as James Slight and Elizabeth Boyd.  He had a younger brother, James Slight, who according to a declaration signed in Victoria (Australia) by his sister Susan Ewart (nee Slight) in 1867, was born in May 1839, but the 1841 Census suggests it was probably a few years earlier around 1836.  His mother's name was Elizabeth, which I know from his death record and the 1841 Census, and I believe her to have been Elizabeth Boyd who was born on 2 Aug 1796 and christened on 12 Aug 1796, at Haddington, East Lothian, to Thomas Boyd (a Mason) and Susan Cleugh.  His father appears to have been the James Slight born on 5 Sep 1797 and christened on 12 Sep 1797 at Whitekirk, East Lothian, to William Slight and Isobel Young.   [website]However, when I search the Old Parish Registers Births &amp; Baptisms I am unable to find it.    Does anyone have any suggestions of where/how else I could look for this elusive marriage record? "
1112,"Finding online parish records for churches in Werdau, Saxony, Germany","I'm studying a group of Germans that immigrated to the United States around 1860 to the mid-1880s.  My source for their birth place is their local court naturalization papers on FamilySearch.  Many of them say they were born in Werdau -- one record says ""born in Werdau in the County of Zwickau in Germany"". (This is consistent with what I've learned from local histories -- the town I'm studying recruited many immigrants for their skills in the weaving industries.)  The online version of Volume V28, Page 522 of the 1911 Encyclopedia Britannica has this entry for Werdau:     WERDAU, a town of Germany, in the kingdom of Saxony, on the Pleisse, in the industrial district of Zwickau, and 40 M. S. of Leipzig. Pop. (1905) 19,473. Its chief industries are cotton and wool-spinning and the weaving of cloth, but machinery of various kinds, paper and a few other articles are also manufactured. In addition to the usual schools, Werdau contains a weaving-school. The town is mentioned as early as 1304 and in 1398 it was purchased by the margrave of Meissen, who afterwards became elector of Saxony. See Stichard, Chronik der Fabrikstadt Werdau (2nd ed., Werdau, 1865).   End of Article: WERDAU   The entry on the online Meyers Gazetteer is Werdau 2) Werdau, Zwickau, Zwickau, Sachsen.    Many members of this group were also members of the local Lutheran church in the US (in Massachusetts).    FamilySearch's website seems to have little coverage.  I have found some Werdau-born people on FamilySearch, but they are 'strays' (people born in Werdau who turn up in some extracted burial records from other areas of Germany).  The FamilySearch catalog has some church records for Werdau, for which one can order FHL  microfilm, but they are LDS records (no surprise there), not Lutheran.    What online resources (indexes, transcriptions) are available for Lutheran parish records in Germany for this time period? "
1113,Learning German scripts (handwriting and printing) used in 19th century records,"In my related question about finding parish records in Saxony, Germany lejonet reminded me about other resources for Werdau in the Family History Catalog.    The Family History Library has resident population registers, documentations of origin, and citizen rolls.  Before I order the microfilms, I'd like to familiarize myself with the forms of these records, which includes learning how to read them.    What tutorials exist for learning how to read old German handwriting, and books printed in older German typescripts?  If you taught yourself how to read it, what techniques (e.g. flash cards) worked for you? "
1114,"Identifying photograph which may be Margaret Morgan (1808-1902) taken at Bridgend, Glamorgan, Wales?","Below is a photograph (I apologize for the quality; it is not in my possession to re-scan) of a woman who I think could be my 3rd great grandmother Margaret Morgan who was:   christened on 28 Aug 1808 at St James, Bristol, Gloucester. Father William Morgan and Mother Jane married Thomas Morgan on 20 Aug 1831 at St Bride's Minor, Glamorganshire, Wales in 1841 Census, aged 30 living at place (farm?) called Foesyrefoil (sp?), Coychurch, Thomas Morgan 38 Margaret Morgan 30 Thomas Morgan 9 Margaret Morgan 7 William Morgan 4 Ann Morgan 2 At same address but diff census record is Ann Griffith aged 69 (poss her mother?) in 1851 Census aged 43 living at Trebryn (sp?), Pencoed, with husband Thomas and six children. Birthplace given as City of Bristol. Thomas Morgan 42 Margaret Morgan 43 William Morgan 14 Catherine Morgan 8 Martha Morgan 6 John Morgan 4 Elizabeth Morgan 3 James Morgan 1 in 1861 Census aged 53 living at Trabrin Beach (sp?), Coychurch with husband Thomas and two children. Birthplace given as Bristol. Thomas Morgan 52 Margret Morgan 53 Elizabeth Morgan 13 Edwin Morgan 6 in 1871 Census aged 63, living at Tybryn, Coychurch, born in Bristol Thomas Morgan 62 Margaret Morgan 63 James Morgan 20 in 1881 Census aged 73, living at Trebryn, Pencoed, born in Bristol, living with husband Thomas aged 72     The word Morgan has been written on both sides of the photograph, I think by my great uncle Thomas Chedester Browning (born 1904; who was Margaret's great grandson) in Australia around the early 1970s.    To try and date the photograph I used [website]The photographer is Edwin Lott and he labelled like this:    LOTT Edwin 8 Nolton St, Bridgend 1875, 1884  LOTT Edwin Nolton St, Bridgend 1880  LOTT Edwin Nolton Studio, Bridgend 1891, 1895, 1901  LOTT Edwin 9 Nolton Studio, Bridgend 1906, 1910, 1914, 1920    I suspect the photo was most likely taken 1891-1901 but taking account of the “gap years” above could have been 1885-1905   Let’s say she is 75 years old which means that I am looking for a Morgan lady born about 1820.   Almost all the records I have from Bridgend are Thomas and Margaret Morgan’s family so she and her daughters seem the best candidates.    Margaret was born 1808 – could lady in photo be 83-93 (or 77-94 using ""gap years"")? I have not yet seen her Death Certificate but I think she lived to 94 (died 1902) so I think the age may fit.  Daughters Catherine/Kate, Margaret and Elizabeth were born 1843-1848 so the oldest, Kate would only be 48-58 (or 42-62) i.e. all too young.    I think the photograph may be Margaret Morgan (1808-1902) but can anyone see anything in the photo and my logic above that would seem to support/refute that tentative identification? "
1115,Dating and identifying Penzance photos – are they of George and Fanny Wills?,"Below are two photographs (each 6.3 x 10.3 cm on very stiff card nearly 1 mm thick) that were placed next to each other in the album of my great grandfather Thomas Anslow Hitchcox.  The album was given to Thomas by his mother (my 2nd great grandmother) whose maiden name was Emma Symons Treloar Billin on 5 Feb 1890 (his 22nd birthday).      On each of the two photographs has been written, in the hand of my grandfather Robert George Hitchcox, the word ""WILLS"".  The photographs are near the back of the album in an area where a number of photos have an ""X"" written on them, meaning that my grandfather did not know who they were, and a number of others have no markings.  In the front of the album there tend to be labelled photographs of Thomas and his siblings and his wife but one of his mother is also near the back.  On 7 Feb 1894, at Angaston, South Australia, Thomas married Mary Ellen Nettell whose parents Matthew Nettell and Grace Martin Wills arrived at Port Adelaide, South Australia on 23 Dec 1865 (see Did uncle of Grace Martin Wills (or perhaps of Matthew Nettell) own the Gosforth?).  I suspect that these photos are of Grace's parents George Wills (1806-1873) and Frances ""Fanny"" Angove (1815-1899).  That would make them Thomas' wife's grandparents.  During his life George was recorded as having the occupations of Miner (1841 Census), Rail Labourer (1851 Census), Miner's Labourer (1861 Census) and Carrier (1865 Marriage  Certificate of his daughter Grace; 1871 Census).  Both George and Frances appear to have lived their entire lives at Illogan, Cornwall, England which is about 18 miles from Penzance where the photos appear to have been taken.  They appear to have been 9 years apart in age, and I think that fits with the photos.  I suspect that these may have been photographs taken shortly before Grace and Matthew left for Australia, perhaps around the time they married on 23 Sep 1865, but the reverses of the photos look a lot like this one by the same photographer from 1853.    Unfortunately, I have not yet found a site suitable to use for dating photographs by Robert. H. Preston although it looks like efforts have commenced here.  Can anyone suggest whether the ages, dress, photo date/location, etc of these two people can be used to support/refute my theory that they belong to George Wills (1806-1873) and Frances ""Fanny"" Angove (1815-1899)?

1116,Pennsylvania cultural transition from German to English and guidance on Englishification?,"I am trying to perform some research in the Pennsylvania area and have run into a couple of instances where I encountered German and English transitions or just pure German; specifically in tombstones and Newspaper that are in German and then later transition to English.   For example in the 1850 Berks County is still producing a German newspaper as well as I found in a local cemeteries where I believe someone is a transition of German looking tombstones near English ones implying it may be the same family.  For example German ""Sausser"" and English ""Souser""  My specific questions:   Was there a particular period where German went out of 'style' in Central Pennsylvania and families transitioned to English or was there some sort of mandate to do so?  Is there any online guide for best general guidance on translation of similar records, such as something I can use as a guide to take pronunciation of the day so I can use as a guide to tell how ""Sausser"" or ""Sauser"" or ""Souser"" or ""Sous zu"" (with an accent?) were pronounced and if they same map to the English ""Souser"" consistently as well as script utilized at the time (i.e. like the 'f' looking 's' in the link above)? I did find this reference dictionary but it does not cover pronunciation. Should all 'public records' (not Church records) from this period be in English, or were public records from this period in German. If public records were in German, is there any separate German based archives may be a resource but may not yet online or translated yet that would have records of pre-1840 Pennsylvania and I could be referenced to?

1117,"Could photo be Edward Nettell (1812-1879) and Maria Hocking (1811-1902) of Illogan, Cornwall?","Below is a photograph from the album of my great grandfather Thomas Anslow Hitchcox.

The photograph was near the back of the album in an area where a number of photos have an ""X"" written on them, meaning that my grandfather (son of the album owner) did not know who they were, and a number of others like this one having no markings.  In the front of the album there tend to be labelled photographs of Thomas and his siblings and his wife but one of his mother is also near the back.  Any labels in the album were by my grandfather (son of the album owner) and were probably added in the 1960s.  This one was on the same page as the photographs discussed in Dating and identifying Penzance photos – are they of George and Fanny Wills?.  On 7 Feb 1894, at Angaston, South Australia, Thomas married Mary Ellen Nettell whose parents Matthew Nettell and Grace Martin Wills arrived at Port Adelaide, South Australia on 23 Dec 1865 (see Did uncle of Grace Martin Wills (or perhaps of Matthew Nettell) own the Gosforth?).  I do not think that this photo relates to Thomas' father's family because they came from Staffordshire.  His mother's family, named Billin, came from Helston, but her father died in Adelaide in 1853 and her two grandfathers died in Helston in 1839 and 1840.  I cannot rule out other members of her family because Helston is only about 10 miles from Redruth in Cornwall (where the photo was taken) but I think there are better candidates.  I suspect that these photos are of Matthew's parents Edward Nettell (1812-1879) and Maria Hocking (1811-1902) which would make them Thomas' wife's grandparents.  During his life Edward was recorded as having the occupations of Cooper or Wood Turner.  Both Edward and Maria appear to have lived their lives predominantly at Illogan (3 miles from Redruth) but I suspect that these may have been photographs taken shortly before Grace and Matthew left for Australia, and probably around the time they married on 23 Sep 1865, at Redruth.    From the reverse of the photograph and something I found at [website]  James Chenhall was born at Redruth in 1845, son of James and Grace   Chenhall. His photographic career probably started with his acting as   an assistant to one of the older Redruth photographers, and he first   appears in 1866, when he was aged 21, as 'photographic artist,   Buller's Row, Redruth'.   A few years later, James Chenhall moved to   No. 11 West End, a better address in the same town and an index of   commercial success. He continued there until 1910, after which he is   not mentioned, and had either retired or died.   Can anyone suggest whether the ages, dress, photo date/location, etc of these two people can be used to support/refute my theory that they might be Edward Nettell (1812-1879) and Maria Hocking (1811-1902)?    The size of the photo and some other requested information:  The 'texture' of the photograph is matte  It appears to be glued onto the paper, and uniformly so.   No light passes through it i.e. if I hold it up to the sun and hold my finger behind it there is no shadow.  The smell is of old paper/cardboard.  The height of the card is 10.2 mm and the photo itself is 8.9 mm. The width of the card is 6.2 mm and the photo itself is 5.4 mm.     "

1120,Where was Mary Ann Harper in the 1881 England census?,"As described at Locating an elusive UK birth record (Mary Ann Harper born circa 1865 possibly Dudley, England)? Mary Ann Harper is particularly elusive.  Two years before her marriage at age 18 I'd expect to find her in the census with her parents (father James Harper, unless she lied and was illegitimate) or in service locally (either Dudley where she was supposedly born or close to the parish she married in in 1883) but I haven't tracked her down.  What techniques can I deploy to locate her in the 1881 census?  What I do know:   Mary Ann Harper (spinster, aged 18) was married after Banns on 15th April 1883 to John Stanley Wright at St. Lukes Church, Birmingham, Warwickshire, England. She named her father as James Harper (deceased) with no occupation given. Both parties gave their address as Hill Street. The witnesses were a J. Marshall and a D. Marshall. [Source: Copy of the relevant entry of marriage from the General Register Office]  From census records after her marriage, I have: an approximate year of birth (1865), and supposed place of birth (Dudley, England).

1121,"Where to find Will of Giles Chichester from 1820s, probably in Somerset or Guyana?","My 4th great grandparents Robert Chichester (1767-1830) and Martha Noake (1762-1836) married on 13 Apr 1797 at Branscombe, Devon and had five children:   Priscilla (my 3rd great grandmother) was born illegitimate on 22 Sep 1796 and baptised on 16 Oct 1796 at Branscombe.  She was given her father's surname at the outset so paternity is established. Jane was born about 1798-99 (I base this estimate on her age being given as 40 in the 1841 Census, 55 in the 1851 Census, 63 in the 1861 Census, 72 in the 1871 Census and 82 in the 1881 Census) at Old Cleeve, Somerset (1851-1881 Censuses all agree). Giles was baptised on 21 Jun 1801 at Broadwey, Dorset Jared was baptised on 20 Mar 1803 at Broadwey, Dorset  Thomas was perhaps born in about 1805 and probably in Dorset, Devon or Somerset but all I know is that he died a bachelor on 25 Dec 1838, as a Planter in British Guiana (now Guyana), and his 1872 probate of 450 pounds was awarded to his sister Jane.  I am unclear why that took 34 years to happen but I will leave that to another question.  I have not found a Will for Thomas.   Thomas living in Guyana is confirmed by his mother Martha's Will (see What Island is likely to be mentioned on 19th Century Somerset Will?) which says that both Jared and Thomas are Gentlemen on the ""Island"" of Demerara.  She mentions Jared first which makes me think he is older than Thomas.  Her will also mentions that:     my property principally consists of what was left to my late husband   and myself by our son Giles Chichester and that it remains due to me   from my said sons Executors  from whom neither my husband nor myself   received any part of the  principal moneys but always received the   annual sum of thirty two pounds from William Chichester Esquire one of   such Executors by quarterly payments   Her husband Robert was buried on 27 Feb 1830 so I can deduce that Giles died some time before then.  I also know that the William Chichester mentioned is Robert's brother and uncle to Giles, Jared and Thomas, and that he too was living in Demarara where he was also an executor of Jared's Will when he died at sea on 23 Jul 1837 on the way back to England.  Jared's Will mentions that:     I give and bequeath to my late brother's son John Chichester my silver   watch formerly worn by his father as a small token of remembrance   Unless there is another brother that I do not know about, and which would appear to contradict Martha's Will listing her five children, this means that Giles had a son and presumably a wife.  The above is a long story, but my question is whether anyone has any ideas about how I could locate the Will of Giles Chichester?  For me this is a key document because I think it should establish whether he was living in Demerara (Guyana) like his two brothers and uncle, and more details.  My suspicion is that he married, had a child and died in Guyana because I can find no trace of him, wife or child in England. "
1122,Proving Jane Middleton of Somerset only Next of Kin in 1872 to Thomas Chichester who died 1838 in Guyana?,"From the England &amp; Wales National Probate Calendar entry below I know that my 3rd great grand uncle Thomas Chichester (who is mentioned in Where to find Will of Giles Chichester from 1820s, probably in Somerset or Guyana?) left Effects under £450 and on:     19 February [1872]. Administration of the effects of Thomas Chichester   late of Plantation Ruimveld in the County of Lunemary in the Colony of   British Guiana Planter a Bachelor who died 25 December 1838 at   Plantation Ruimveld was granted at the Principal Registry to Jane   Middleton of Stogumber in the County of Somerset Widow the Sister and   only Next of Kin.   The grant of administration 34 years after the death seems unusual, and I suspect that there may have been no will found.  At the time of Thomas' death both of his brothers (Giles and Jared) were already deceased.  At the time administration was granted, both of Thomas' sisters were still alive:   Jane of Stogumber, Somerset (widow of William Middleton) Priscilla of Old Cleeve, Somerset (widow of William Browning)   Consequently, I am thinking that there must have been some additional documents involved to prove that Jane was Thomas' ""only Next of Kin"".    Does anyone know the likely nature of that documentation and where it might now be found?    I am hoping that it is something that may have been kept separate from the pre-1858 Somerset Wills that were destroyed by German bombing in 1942. "
1123,"Are there any tools to search unstructured, digital data?","While I have been searching for ancestors in early America (late 1700s) I have found multiple records that have been OCR'd and made available online.

1124,How can you use FamilyTreeDNA's Search tool to contact matches / find contact information?,"How can you use FamilyTreeDNA's Search tool to contact matches / find contact information?  I have been continually challenged (as described in the challenges below) by trying to figure out how to use FamilyTreeDNA's ""New and Improved Search Tool"" for productive purposes and make contact with individuals.  I am hoping someone has been able to successfully dissect the maze for productive purpose and can explain how they have worked through these challenges to be able to make contacts with individuals or the owners of the trees that show up in these searches.    Challenge 1:  If for example I search for my last name ""Souser"" as a non-logged in user I get 25 results.   As a logged in user I get the same results as an individual user as well as a project administrator.   If you open ""Private Member Tree"" or the individual named in the screenshot you can see details of their tree.. but you have no way to contact them. The named individual here is actually known (4th cousin to the person logged in) but doesn't show up in Autosomal / Family Finder under that name.  Challenge 2:  This particular example, for someone who has mtDNA, Y-111, BigY, and FamilyFinder, though shows someone who share a common ancestor (Joseph Souser only 2 generations differences and their tree you click on reflects this) but I do not know the name of who they are and there is no one in the first 5 pages of this individuals autosomal / family finder results that have this Blair Souser in their results; again it provides no way to contact them. So I am dead on the water on using this information or making contact with them.   Challenge 3:  I am result 12 on the search; I see the following under different roles as a ftDNA customer. I also have my information as ""Basic Information &amp; Tree for my Matches"", not entirely private.  As the project administrator (myself)    As my grandfather I see the following, which shows me as a match; but still have no way to contact me.   Note: Only the FamilyTree Icon is clickable and takes you to the same icon as the text ""Christopher Souser's Tree"" but the Match and ftDNA customer icons have no links.  As myself (not my project administrator account)    As someone under the project who is not directly related performing the search.   Challenge 4: Then depending on your privacy settings the results that are from my own tree, the user conducting the search get marked like one of the following; including for ones' self as well as other members in your attached GEDCOM to your profile; but the information appears in public searches for non-logged in users.    OR it lists all contents of your tree (the user doing the search) and does not filter out yourself or content of your own tree.  I confirmed this challenge by changing a detail in the tree and it does not identify it as my own tree or filter out the content from my own tree.. further adding to the confusion of trying to use this 'tool'.  I have invested significant amounts of money in ftDNA and so I have contacted FamilyTreeDNA support a couple of times now and have yet to figure out a productive use of this feature and looking for a way to productively use this tool; if it exists.  The responses from FamilyTreeDNA that I have received are:     ""For privacy reasons we cannot release information to non matches.""   Which would make sense if it actually worked this way and it facilitated me contacting my matches via this tool.     ""It is a tool that is available to anyone who navigates to our site. It will be even more useful for our customers who have completed testing as you can further filter results to that who are DNA matches.""   This would make sense if that were true.. but someone who has completed every single test (FF, mtDNAFull, Y111,BigY) they offer I would think the tool would then be of use to me..   I have challenged them on whether it is purely marketing but received no response and they have been unable to provide any useful application example via their support process to date.  The only semi-productive usage has been to troll random users trees but does not tie into any other features of the site and is complicated by the inconsistent results illustrated above.     Question: How can you use FamilyTreeDNA's Search tool to contact matches / find contact information?  "

1126,Locating records of a man employed by Rufford Abbey for 70 years?," Rufford Abbey, early 20th century, photo credit ruffLives    I have an ancestor who appears to have been employed at Rufford Abbey in Nottinghamshire his entire life. When he died aged about 87 in 1850, the local newspaper notes that he had been employed by the successive Earls of Scarborough for upwards of seventy years. He would therefore have been employed by the estate from c.1780 to 1850. The article also notes he was receiving a weekly pension of 10 shillings from the 8th Earl.  This man was an agricultural labourer. A surviving 1801 census shows he was employed in agriculture, and the 1841 census confirms him as an ""Ag Lab"".  I was wondering if any estate records might survive that may give more details about his employment. Google brings up a list of employees from 1856 that records many of those who worked at Rufford Abbey at that time. Apparently this list was made upon the death of the 8th Earl of Scarborough. Sadly this is after my ancestor died, so he obviously does not appear on these lists.  What records from Rufford Abbey survive that might contain information about employees from 1780-1850? How might I go about accessing such records? I am guessing many of the records will be held at Nottinghamshire Archives but I am not having much luck using their catalogue to find records that pertain to the period 1780-1850. "
1127,Finding Specific Railroad Segments in the United Started named after employees?,"I have found at least two references in notes passed down to my be others that indicated they might have Railroad spur / section was named after them.   Searching Newspaper.com and Google Books while they tend to be named after the geographic area or a local business, there are some references to spurs named after specific individuals.     I have googled their names a couple different ways and not been able to find anything specifically under their name or a reference site for looking up such things. This was primarily in the 1880-1960 time frame, but I am thinking the naming would have been more so in the 1900-1940 time frame.   The two specific examples, both of which I had passed down to me from different individuals,  I have are for Chester Emerson Souser (C.E. Souser) in Nebraska working for the Union Pacific RR and Ross Russell (R.R. Souser) in Pennsylvania working for the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad.  RR in particular is mentioned frequently in news articles due to being injured in a major train accident. George W. and J.S. Souser also worked for the railroad but not as prominently mentioned; W.B. Souser in Youngstown, PA also was a railroad man and mentioned in several news articles but doubt with his participation in this incident he got anything named after him.  In searching so far, and not being a railroad enthusiast, it seems Spurs / Sections were effecting 'accounting sections' with their associated fees / tariffs / staffing; so possibly accounting records may also be a potential source.  I mainly want to know where it was, and acknowledging that the railroad spur may not even exist today, or it may have just been honorary, or even just be incorrect family lore....     Question: Is there any search Railroad enthusiast or Historical Record sites that that I could search for these place's designated names whether they be geographic, named after a person, ranch, local lore, business, etc to be able to be able to determine the facts behind these notes as well as use for related research?

1128,Would having the exact same GRO Birth Index reference mean two children born to the same parents were twins?,"I have two ancestors, Mary Juden and Sarah Juden.

1129,Best practices for producing document abstracts or summaries?,"I usually transcribe documents or manuscripts in full so that I do not miss important details. However, often these documents ramble on for pages and pages of legal jargon, so it is useful to produce a summary or abstract of the document for sharing and for future quick reference. I am thinking primarily of wills where there is a tendency to include a lot of superfluous or repetitive information.  What are the best practices for producing document abstracts? Are there published or widely-accepted guidelines for this? In particular, I have struggled to know how to best handle the following points:   What tense to use in the abstract? These documents are usually written in the first person (""I bequeath to John my son...""), and should that tense be maintained in the abstract, or is it acceptable/preferable to transpose it into third person (""He bequeaths to his son John..."")? Should original spellings and abbreviations be maintained? In a transcription, one should attempt to reproduce the text verbatim, but in an abstract is it acceptable to expand abbreviations or correct obvious spelling mistakes of names or places? For example, writing ""William"" instead of ""Wm"" in the abstract, or correcting ""Darbyshire"" to ""Derbyshire"". Can I change the order of information in my abstract? For instance, in a will the testator makes bequests to son John, then wife Ann, then sister Jane, then daughter Mary, then son William; in the abstract I might start with wife Ann, then sons John and William, daughter Mary, and lastly sister Jane. Or is a goal of the abstract simply to go through the document noting the key points, but omitting superfluous information, in which case the order should not be changed?   In addition I would welcome any other insights into producing quality and consistent document abstracts. I realise I've mentioned a lot of closely related questions here but I'm not expecting anyone to address all of them in an answer. "
1130,Understanding chromosomes and centiMorgans,"I am very new to this so please be patient with me.  I had a DNA test via Ancestry which didn't tell me very much and so I uploaded the data to GEDmatch.  My top 3 matches are:     A:11 chr matches, 372.6 cM, longest 62.6 cM   B:13 chr matches, 381.6, cM, longest 49.6 cM   C:10 chr matches, 348.9 cM, longest 48.7 cM     Now, I know who these people are. A and C are brother and sister and are my 2nd cousins. B is my father's full cousin, so my 1st cousin once removed.  So far so good. We are closely related so would expect good matches.  My 4th best match according to GEDmatch is:   D:2 chr matches, 51.2 cM, longest 38.8 cM - I don't know who this person is.   So now we come to my question(s):    Do closer relatives match on more chromosomes or is this irrelevant?   Do the actual chromosomes that you match on make any difference in interpretation?     Does the longest matching cM mean anything above 7 cM? e.g. in the example above A and C are both related to me in the same way but the longest cM is quite different.    None of the sources I have read address these questions.  "
1131,"What ""hidden"" clues are there in the GRO Indexes of births and deaths?","This Q&amp;A is inspired by Jan Murphy's question – Finding Devon parish marriage records? – but this one pertains to the birth and death indexes for England &amp; Wales.  We all will have come across the problem where we are looking for a birth or death record, but there are several possible entries in the GRO index, all in the expected district and same time-frame. This makes it difficult to determine which is the right entry if you cannot locate some other corroborating evidence such as a baptism/burial.  What clues can I find in the GRO index to help me determine which is the right entry, and thus which certificate is worth ordering? "
1132,My Father passed away - next test(s) on what remains of his DNA sample?,"I posted this general question over at the forum on FamilyTreeDNA. Though I received a reply, there is still no answer to my question, so I thought I'd try my luck at posting here.  Anyhow, in early 2009 I bought two kits for the Genographic Project and dutifully had my father do his cheek swabs: one kit for his Y-Chromosome, and one for his mtDNA. Once that was completed, I had his samples transferred to Family Tree DNA.  Then, late in 2009 I paid to have an mtFullSequence done on his mtDNA sample.  My father passed away in 2015. In early 2016, I phoned FTNDA to discuss. The first thing they did was arrange to merge his two original samples into one kit. Then, they suggested doing Family Finder. I did that and recently obtained the interesting results.  So, all told what I have done on my father is:   Y-12 (originally done for the Genographic Project) mtFullSequence Family Finder   My father's Y Haplogroup is R-M269 and I am being presented with the M343 SNP pack on FTNDA.  My question is, what now? My father is gone so the sample that remains with FTDNA is old and finite (their customer service says they still have ""one container"" of his DNA). His siblings have all passed away -- unfortunately, with no samples taken. What is the best way to make use of the sample of my father's DNA that is left?  Should I refine the Y-Chromosome to Y-111? That seems the most natural (though I'm a male and carry it too). Should any SNP tests best be done on his remaining sample as opposed to on me? Or, should I do nothing and just let his 2009 samples continue to sit at FTDNA?  By phone, FTDNA said that they should have enough left to do the Y-111 and a SNP pack which is great, but I'd love to know independent of their customer service if that is the wisest way to make use of the remaining DNA sample which they have?  Full disclosure: I did have my father do 23andMe in 2010 and I did have his blood drawn and sent to a DNA Bank. I hope to never touch his banked DNA (except maybe to do a full sequence someday), but at least it does exist. My question now is solely how to best make use of my father's remaining sample at Family Tree DNA? "
1133,Is there a centralized Historical Society index / database for the United States?,"Is there a centralized directory or database of local historical societies or organizations for the United States which shows the information and services they provide in a consistent format for each society?  I did look at the Local Historical Society Genealogy question which to a degree spurred this question about resources utilized and available to them.   I know internet search engines like Google/Bing/Yahoo/etc exist -- but finding out their location and hours of operation requires individually searching for each society, knowing the exact names, etc. -- and their region / period of coverage is not always apparent.  Even though technically several of these are libraries they commonly also do not show up in searches on WorldCat as a library nor their holdings.  I also know Cyndi's List has a list of societies, but it is just that -- a list of societies and a link to their websites, not a searchable index with areas of coverage, nor services they provide.   All of the societies are using different tools and website formats, so trying to navigate their websites to figure out what services they provide and how to initiate requests for services can be pretty frustrating sometimes.  Key Data Points I am looking for, the areas of coverage in particular being searchable.   Name of the Society / Historical Library  Geographic Areas of Coverage Years of Coverage  Website  Contact Information    Phone Number  Mailing Address   Collection Holding, especially Unique Ones Publications Research Fees  Cost of Membership / Membership Benefits      Question: Is there a centralized Historical Society index / database for the United States that contains this type of information?

1135,"Interpreting 1801 Settlement Examination from Marystow, Devon, England?","In a comment on Meaning of term Sojourner on 1794 Marriage Record at Marystow (Devon) for John Creber? @ColeValleyGirl alerted me to the existence of a Settlement Examination for a John Creber at Marystow who seemed likely to be my 4th great grandfather.  There appear to have been two men named John Creber living in Marystow at that time:   John Creber baptised 29 Dec 1766 as the son of John and Mary [website]John Creber baptised 9 Mar 1773 as the son of Richard and Mary from Milton Abbot [website]The two John Crebers appear to be 1st cousins.  Yesterday, FindMyPast released an image of the examination document which I have transcribed below:     Hundred of Lifton in DEVON      THE Examination of John Creber an Inmate in the Parish of Marystow in   the said Hundred of Lifton taken on Oath this Twentieth day of January   in the Year 1801 before us Arthur Kelly and John Cudlipp Esq. two of   his Majesty’s Justices of the Peace for the said County, acting in and   for the said Hundred touching the place of his last legal Settlement.      WHO SAITH, that about the Year 1788, he lived a Covenant Servant with   one John Lang of the Parish of Milton abbot in the said County and   received his Wages, he then went to the Parish of Marystow and lived   with his Father Richard Creber for five years for his Meat, Drink,   Washing and Lodging and has done nothing to gain a Settlement since.      John Creber [signature]      Sworn at Lifton this 20th Day of January 1801 before us ___      Arthur Kelly [signature]      Jno Cudlipp [signature]   I am confident that this examination is of my 4th great grandfather, and not his cousin because the signature on the Examination:    appears to match the signature on the record of his marriage to Harriet Palmer on 9 Jun 1794 at Marystow (when he was described as a Sojourner in the parish):    The way I am interpreting this new and revisited evidence is that John was born to Richard and Mary either at Milton Abbot, or at Marystow, but either way their parish of settlement was Milton Abbot.  It is unclear where John lived between 1773 and 1787, but in about 1788 he was working as a Covenant Servant for John Lang at Milton Abbot, and soon after that he returned/moved to live at Marystow.  I think this settlement examination is his acknowledgement that he has no right to settlement in Marystow.  For settlement examination documents like this one would there normally be any follow up documentation expected that might clarify where John lived prior to 1788, what a Covenant Servant was, and why that was an important statement to include at the beginning of this document?

1136,Deleting information from Ancestry.com,"If I upload an image to my family tree on Ancestry.com/.ca/.uk, etc. and someone shares/downloads it into their own tree - then if I later delete the image from my tree, does the other person still get to keep their copy of it? Have I lost the opportunity to claim ownership of the image and control its use?  For example, if I upload a scanned photo and then relatives request that I remove it...

1137,How many ancestors alive 1000 years ago does a person have on average?,"I was thinking about something the other day (that is probably stupid), and thought this would be a good place to talk about it.  If someone wanted to draw its family tree over the last 1000 years, he'd write a binary tree with a depth of about 40 (counting 25 years on average between each generations). This tree would have 240 leaves, or about 1012 ancestors on the deeper level. That is obviously much more than the total world population and a stupid figure when you think about it.  The only explanation that I can think of is that a real genealogy tree must have ""linked"" branches at several levels that change the actual number of ancestors. Anyway, for an average person, how many ancestors would that make? Could one assume that all or nearly all of the persons that lived in its country or world region a 1000 years ago would be part of its ancestors? "
1138,Is there a way to get an overview of ancestry.com member trees?,"I recently started on ancestry.com building my family history, starting from nothing to over 150 people in about a month.

I'm assuming I'll pay eventually but wanted to wait until I had built up my data. On the other hand, if there is a lot of data available, I'll pull the trigger sooner.  I don't want to start paying to get access to some record just to find out it was a short-lived effort with nothing significant in it.  Secondly, what is accessible in these public member trees?

1139,"What is somebody's ""real"" surname from a set of possible spelling variants?","How do you decide what is somebody's ""real"" surname?  Is there some hierarchy of data sources that you follow or do you just go by preponderance of usage?

For example, I have a relative who remarried and her second husband's and her new last name was Kenny according to 1930 census. However her 1934 death certificate shows Kenney.  Yet her husband's 1932 death certificate shows Kinney.  So how to decide what is ""correct""? I'd like to know, given the circumstances outlined, what ""best practices"" are recommended by those of you who have been at this a while and know what you're doing.  Her husband immigrated from Croatia according to the census so there's a chance that his birth name was none of these. "
1140,Losing FamilySearch.org functionality from links to digital images. What am I doing wrong?,"I frequently use links to digitized images at FamilySearch (below, ""digital links""). Sometimes these are to entries in unindexed collections, while other times, it's just easier to refer someone to a ""range"" of entries rather than a whole series of different indexed accounts.   I'm used to the digital links opening as an image in the FamilySearch page. Separate from the image shown, the FamilySearch page generally identifies the collection, any hierarchy and an image/sequence number.

1141,Finding Edinburgh map engraver apprenticeship records of William Slight in 1840s?,"My 3rd great grandfather, William Slight, was born about 1832 in Haddington, East Lothian, Scotland to James Slight (a Mason) and Elizabeth Boyd (daughter of a Mason).  In the 1841 Scotland Census he was living at Court Street, Haddington with his parents James (40) and Elizabeth (40), his siblings Susan (11) and James (5), as well as an Irishman called Peter Murphy (25).  In the 1851 England Census he was recorded as working in Southampton as an ""Engraver at Map Office"" which means at the Ordnance Survey.  He married Louisa Dorothea Hope Moore in 1852 at South Stoneham a few miles from Southampton and their first child (Elizabeth) was born in 1853 at Southampton.  In late 1854 the family of three left Plymouth aboard the Shand and arrived in early 1855 at Portland, Victoria.  I know lots about the Australian part of their lives but would like to learn more about William's early life in Scotland.  I suspect that Susan, William and James were  orphaned not too long after 1841 but I do not know when or where either of their parents died.    My understanding is that Map Engraving was a highly skilled profession and I suspect that in the late 1840s he would have worked for a company in or near Edinburgh St Cuthberts because:   his sister Susan Boyd Slight married there in 1852;  his future wife Louisa was a Kitchen Maid in the household of Lord Fullerton there in the 1851 Scotland Census; and in 1851 he was lodging in Southampton with the family of another Map Engraver called Thomas McLeod who had married there in 1839.     Prior to this period, I believe the Ordnance Survey ""outsourced"" maps of Scotland to Edinburgh companies but, when it moved office to Southampton in the early 1840s they brought that function ""in-house"", which was why some (many?) Edinburgh map engravers followed the work there.  David Law, who was also lodging with Thomas McLeod in 1851, ""was one of many Edinburgh engravers who studied at the Trustees' Academy"" so I suspect that William may have too.    However, I have not been able to uncover any apprenticeship, guild admission or employment records for him in Scotland, or anything to say definitively that he was living in Edinburgh, so am hoping someone may be able to provide me with some ideas about where to look next?  I also have a theory that William Slight may have worked for the same company as Thomas McLeod (while both were in Edinburgh) and I found that the latter engraved a map of Arbroath before 1842 but I have not yet found who published this map to help zero in on what surviving company records William Slight should be looked for in.

1142,The identity of Priscilla Kimball Preston. Can you help track down an old extracted record and help solve a 17th century mystery?,"We all know it should not take 1200 words to explain a transcription error ...   A 17th century personality, ""Priscilla Kimball Preston,"" reported by FamilySearch's FamilyTree causes a conflict in my family research. I've had problems directly identifying the source specifics reported about her on new.FamilySearch.org. I'm hoping the experts on Genealogy.StackExchange can help me get to the bottom of this.   A series of questions below relate to the same problem. Since there is more than one way to slay this dragon, partial answers are welcome!  ""Priscilla Kimball Preston"" and the source  In new.FamilySearch.org, this ""Priscilla Kimball Preston"" (_ _ - _ _) is combined profile no. L8WP-GM6. The profile was developed from only two underlying submissions (identified as KGH5-CSK and KGH5-CXH).     Better yet, the combined profile reports two sources (and only two)--both cite extracted records. The citations to these extractions appear identical, but for a different ""Record Number.""      Source type: Other, Image number: 384, Record   number: 698, Batch number: I04821­2, Batch number: I04821­2, Location   in source: p 78, Source template: INDEX05, Locality: Beverly, Essex,   Massachusetts, United States, Language: English ­ Repaging,   Contributor: EXTRACTION      Source type: Other, Image number: 384, Record   number: 691, Batch number: I04821­2, Batch number: I04821­2, Location   in source: p 78, Source template: INDEX05, Locality: Beverly, Essex,   Massachusetts, United States, Language: English ­ Repaging,   Contributor: EXTRACTION   Question 1: From the citations above, is anyone able to otherwise identify a specific source title and source record from which the information about ""Priscilla Kimball Preston"" was devised?   ""Priscilla Kimball Preston"" and the IGI  I could not get the extracted record itself to return in a search of the name ""Priscilla Kimball Preston"" from the FamilySearch collection, ""International Genealogical Index (IGI)"" for ""Community Contributed IGI"" records."" (Nor did it return in a search of ""Community Contributed IGI."")   The batch number given in the citations is ""I04821­2"" (this batch number seems repeated twice in each citation). According to the wiki article, 'IGI Batch Number Descriptions,"" batches identified with a leading ""I"" are indices. Unfortunately, these are not further explained.      Question 2: Should I be able to locate the actual extracted entry in a search of the IGI? If the answer is yes, then what is the correct way of using the citations and IGI search parameters so the extracted record indeed returns? In the alternative, was this extraction excluded from the IGI for some obvious reason? (I thought all extractions would have been in the IGI).  Inferior/convoluted approach to devising the extracted record  The profile of ""Priscilla Kimball Preston"" (L8WP-GM6) in new.FamilySearch.org lacks much by which she would be identified directly (no birth or death information about her, for example). new.FamilySearch.org does identify her by associating problematic birth specifics for three immediate family members--two children and a husband (father of the children). Information from the summary profiles of the associated family members is shown below; the genealogical improbability should be obvious--a man born 1728 did not father children born earlier.      Many submissions combined to develop those three associated profiles. Through a reasonably convoluted process, I'm able to identify underlying submissions in the other profiles that probably relate to the extracted data.   William Preston (profile K2NM-FNP). From among the submissions (54) making up his profile, I'm able to locate two submissions that each contain a matching reference (KGH5-CSK or KGH5-CXH) to those of Priscilla Kimball Preston. About him, these submissions do not report about a date of birth. They only report his (a) name (""William Preston""); (b) gender (male) and (c) wife's name (""Priscilla Kimball Preston"").   More about his profile. There are many sources, including extracted records, for his profile. None that I could see refer to a specific submission, but two of the extracted records are identical to those of Priscilla Kimball Preston, as below; emphasis added. :       Source type: Other, Image number: 384, Record number: 691, Batch   number: I04821-2, Batch number: I04821-2, Location in source: p 78,   Source template: INDEX05, Locality: Beverly, Essex, Massachusetts,   United States, Language: English - Repaging, Contributor: EXTRACTION      Source type: Other, Image number: 384, Record number: 698, Batch   number: I04821-2, Batch number: I04821-2, Location in source: p 78,   Source template: INDEX05, Locality: Beverly, Essex, Massachusetts,   United States, Language: English - Repaging, Contributor: EXTRACTION   In the case of the two daughters, I found similar but not identical submission references and in each case, these were the only entries that reported a mother ""Priscilla Kimball Preston.""  Mary Presson (profile LH8V-2PB). From among the submissions (21) making up her profile, one submission (KGH5-CSF) reports a birth 5 Mar 1695 at Beverly, Essex [County], Massachusetts; parents William Preston and Priscilla Kimball Preston.

Question 3: I only know what I know. Lacking identifiable entries in the IGI (see Question 2), is there any way to locate all ""extractions"" about William Preston and Priscilla Kimball Preston that might similarly be associated with the same source and page ""78?""   Likely the infamous ""page 78""  All the sources/citations described above identify a now infamous page, ""78"" in materials authored by or about Beverly, Essex County, Massachusetts. I'm able to otherwise identify a set of ""Preston"" records that appear such a numbered page. Yet other obvious record groups about Beverly can be excluded because the ""Presson/Preston, etc."" entries appear in those books on pages numbered higher than 78. Shown below is the upper section of page ""78"" from family pages in the Beverly town clerks records. See ""Massachusetts, Town Clerk, Vital and Towns Records, 1579-2001""; digital images, FamilySearch.org, Vol. 3 (M to S), p. 78; viewed as image 385 of 589.     Although I can't explain why there are not similar entries for all the children of ""William Preston and Priscilla ..."" reported on the page, I suspect that this ""Priscilla Kimball Preston"" personality was created by a mis-transcription of what was otherwise the name ""Priscilla Randall.""     I'm comfortable with the logic (""Priscilla Kimball Preston"" vs ""Priscilla Randall""), but it would sure make for a more straight forward explanation if I was able to directly identify the source from the citations above (see question 1) and/or locate the precise entry in the IGI (see question 2).    It shouldn't take 1,200 words and four graphics to explain a transcription error. In the mean time, we do what we gotta do.   "
1143,Cornish parish records lost in fire?,"I have a brickwall in the form of my great great grandfather whom I know from our family bible was born in Cornwall in 1811. I've found him (Robert Chapman and his wife Elizabeth nee Shapling and their family) in Cornwall the 1841 census and his death certificate 2 years later.  I also have wedding notice (not certificate) but that is it. I have his wife's ancestors traced back several centuries but despite looking for nearly 20 years, I can find no record of his birth or baptism. Someone told me that a large number of Cornish archives were lost in a fire; can anyone confirm that and is there any record of which parish records were lost?  Finally, any idea where I might get access to Cornish records that still exist? "

However, I can find matches born in other counties. How likely is it that someone born in, say Norfolk, 1811 would 'migrate' to Cornwall (where I know he got married in Werrington, Cornwall in 1828 aged 17) presumably looking for work (he was a joiner/carpenter)?   By that time we were experiencing the industrial revolution - canals were thriving from around 1777 but soon started to decline with the advent of the railways. How extensive were rail connections around 1825 - where there ways to get from Norfolk to Cornwall? Does anyone know were I might view such records? "

1147,What is this Delaware marriage document?,"I recently found (via ancestry.com) this document regarding the marriage of my great-grandparents (specifically my father's mother's parents) in 1883, from the Delaware Marriage Records, 1744-1912. The text, along with any typos I've introduced and italics denoting fields that were filled in by hand, is:     Marriage records, vol. 40 p. 293      Know all Men by these Presents,   That We, Abram Vandegrift and Albert Vasey   are held and firmly bound to the State of Delaware, in the   sum of two hundred dollars, lawful money of the said State,   to be paid to the said State of Delaware, to which payment   well and truly to be made we bind ourselves, and each of us,   jointly and severally, our and each of our heirs, executors   and administrators, firmly by the presents.  Sealed with our   seals and dated this First day of January in the year of   our Lord one thousand eight hundred and eighty-Three      The condition of the above written Obligation is such,   that if Abram Vandegrift aforesaid and Miss Emma Cleaver   may lawfully unite themselves in marriage, and if there be no   legal objection to celebrating the rites of marriage between   them, then this obligation shall be void, otherwise to be   and remain in force.      Signed, Sealed and Delivered in Presence of   John Vasey      Abram Vandegrift [seal]   Albert Vasey [seal]   It seems similar to ""banns of marriage"", but it's significantly different, particularly in the mention of $200 (which was a great deal of money back then).  I've never heard of a document like this. Was its use common and widespread? And given the date of January 1, 1883, what can I assume about when they were actually married?   "
1148,Preservation of original documents and photographs,"Over the Christmas period this year I was staying with my elderly Grandfather and knowing my interest in the family history, he pulled out a load of certificates and documents from my late Grandmothers side of the family.  Some if them dated back to the early 1800s. I promptly got out my camera to document them and incorporate them into my research.  I am fairly competent with digital archiving and back-ups. Some of the answers in this question have helped in that regard, but it strikes me that these documents are still very legible and (mostly) in good condition.  What I would like to know is:   Is it feasible to keep the originals for future generations of my family, or should I just digitise and not worry about the originals.   If not:   How should I go about preserving the original hard copies of these when they come into my possession permanently? Are there any procedures / storage environments that an individual can feasibly implement that will ensure their continued survival?   I guess that any answers could also be applied to archiving photographic history as well as documents and certificates, or are there different optimum storage environments? "

If I was to get in touch with the Dienststelle and send a scanned copy of both sides, would it help to locate the records faster?  Unfortunately, my last name is different from his, but I do have a long form copy of my birth certificate and marriage certificate of my parents. My grandfather's name appears on the marriage certificate so I can prove a connection. Also, would these records indicate previous military information or citizenship? "

1155,GRO rules for sub-districts of birth registrations?,"This is a worked case study related to What &quot;hidden&quot; clues are there in the GRO Indexes of births and deaths?  Nicholas Tabb's WWI Draft Registration card lists his birth date as 31 Oct 1887 and his birth place at Slapton, Devon, England.  Searching for Nicholas on findmypast turns up the following records:   a birth registration in 1887 Q4 in Kingsbridge Registration District, Vol 5b page 194 (FreeBMDs transcription agrees with this) 1891 Census: Ven Cottage, Stoke Fleming, Kingsbridge, Devon, England; Nicholas (aged 3) is the son of the head of household, born in Stokenham 1901 Census return, Week Cottages, Dartmouth, Totnes, Devon, England; Nicholas (aged 13) is the son of the head of household, born in Stokenham   A search for Nicholas Tabb in the Devon Baptisms doesn't give any results (both Slapton and Stokenham baptisms are in this record set).   The 1891 census says Nicholas's parents John and Annie are born in Slapton, and I have located them with two children in Slapton in the 1881 Census in Slapton Village.   Could Nicholas have given the Draft Registrar his parents' birthplace instead of his own?  What other clues do we have?  The rest of the family in the 1891 Census:   Walter J     Tabb    Son     Single  Male    10  1881    Scholar     Slapton, Devon, England Lillian  Tabb    Daughter    Single  Female  8   1883    Scholar     Stokenham, Devon, England Frederick    Tabb    Son     Single  Male    6   1885    Scholar     Stokenham, Devon, England Ann Maria    Tabb    Daughter    Single  Female  4   1887    Scholar     Stokenham, Devon, England Nicholas     Tabb    Son     Single  Male    3   1888    -   Stokenham, Devon, England   The children in 1901 Census:   Lilian   Tabb    Daughter    Single  Female  18  1883    House Keeper    Stokenham, Devon, England Annie    Tabb    Daughter    Single  Female  14  1887    -   Stokenham, Devon, England Nicholas     Tabb    Son     Single  Male    13  1888    Gardener's Boy  Stokenham, Devon, England Herbert  Tabb    Son     Single  Male    9   1892    Scholar     Stoke Fleming, Devon, England   Given the migration pattern that is revealed from the birthplaces of the older siblings, it seems likely that the family was in Stokenham in 1887 and the family moved to Stoke Fleming before census day in 1891.   So what hidden clues can we get from the GRO birth registration?  Using the method in the linked question, Nicholas' birth reg on page 194 appears to be in the Stokenham sub-district.  The first two sub-districts from Kingsbridge registration district in the 1881 Census registration districts report from Histpop.org are:   Blackawton: parish Blackawaton, Stokefleming, Slapton Stokenham: parishes of Stokenham, Sherford, Charleton, South Pool, Chivelstone, East Portlemouth   My question is: is it necessary to register a birth from Stokenham in Stokenham sub-district?   If a family lived close by the border of the sub-district, could they register in the neighboring sub-district, or would the GRO list the birth in the sub-district where it belonged, regardless of what office was visited?  (Note that in the US, if a person registered for the draft in WWI away from their usual residence,their draft card was forwarded to their local office.) "
1156,Seeking business records of South Australian general hawkers and drapers around 1880?,"My 3rd great uncle Thomas Hitchcox (born 12 May 1837 and baptised 14 Jun 1837 at Brewood, Staffordshire) has been asked about in another question (Tracing police service of South Australian constable from 1855 to 1861?) and is a bit of an enigma because he lived in many places in South Australia and New South Wales, and although not yet confirmed, he may also have been a bigamist who changed his name to Thomas Cox and died in Tasmania in 1906.  Today I came across a newspaper notice in ""The Express and Telegraph"" of 28 Sep 1880:    I think the Thomas Hitchcox mentioned here may be him.  Are there government records available for the registration, and dissolution, of businesses in South Australia around 1880 that might list a few details about those conducting them?  Intriguingly there is a Thomas Hitchcoy [sic?], draper, recorded at Terowie (less than 50 miles from Paratoo) in the 1882, 1883 and 1884 Boothby Directories, and the occupation of draper was recorded for Thomas when he arrived in South Australia at the end of 1854 and also on the 1869 birth certificate of his third son Henry Francis Hitchcox (at Hartley, NSW).  In between the above records the New South Wales Government Gazette (Sydney, NSW : 1832 - 1900) of Fri 17 Mar 1882 [Issue No.119 (SUPPLEMENT)] on Page 1553 has No. 6. LIST OF LETTERS RETURNED FROM THE COUNTRY, AND NOW LYING AT THIS OFFICE UNCLAIMED had an item ""107. Hitchcox, T., Mount Browne"".  Mount Browne was a mining area in north west NSW much more easily serviced from South Australia (like Broken Hill) than Sydney.  It seems possible that he spent time at Mount Browne in the period 1880-1882 too.    The Thomas Hitchcox in this question does not appear to be the Thomas Hitchcox who was admitted to Adelaide's Destitute Asylum (GRG 28/5 Destitute Asylum Admissions 1870 - 1873, 1881 - July 1906) because that one was born about 1804 and arrived in the colony in a different ship (Bolton in 1849/50).

On GEDmatch, I compare Alice to Bob and get 36.8937 cM and then compare Alice to Charlie and get 82.9541 cM, but comparing Bob to Charlie gets zero matching.

I understand that because these kits are not phased and two values are at every position, you can get false positives, but given the very long length of 12,460,601 to 48,458,402 shouldn't that be near zero probability to be a false positive?  Does this suggest some kind of corruption in the DNA test data or blank spaces in the data?  What would explain such a long false positive? "
1160,Is Rosa Balladares mother of all these children?,"I am looking for the children of Rosa Balladares, born in Nicaragua. I found the corresponding records on FamilySearch.  When I was able to access the mentioned records some months ago, I was asking myself, whether anyone would guess whether the Rosa mentioned in all this records is the mother of all listed children?

1162,I can't see the original images on the website -- now what?,"It happens to us all -- we read a local history or a genealogy book from the late 1800s, or someone gives us a list of records they have seen, or we collect links to records from a website, and then the terms of the agreement change, so the records are no longer visible. How do you cope when you can't see the original images?    For an example, see Is Rosa Balladares mother of all these children?. "
1163,"Reading surname in 1873 diary from Fullarton, South Australia?","I am currently transcribing the 1873 Diary of my 3rd Great Grandfather Thomas Hitchcox who lived at Fullarton (suburb of Adelaide), South Australia, when he wrote it.  The image below contains a family name that I cannot determine.  The rest says:     A family from Victoria named ? came to live at Barn Abbey     I have found out a little about Barn Abbey:     When European settlers arrived in the 1830’s and began appropriating   the Adelaide Plains land from its indigenous inhabitants, a   considerable area in Fullarton was bought by James Frew. The suburb   owes its name to his wife, Jane Fullarton, and ‘Barn Abbey” at 16 Fern   Avenue is said to be the first stone building in Fullarton.      After a few changes of ownership of Barn Abbey, the house and a parcel   of land surrounding it was sold to James Fairbrother, who established   an orchard and a factory making awardwinning- jam on the property.   which was exciting because I had been wondering who a man named Fairbrother in the diary may have been but I am no closer to knowing what the hard to read family name is.  To me it looks like Strutten but there are no births, marriages or deaths of anyone in South Australia by that name.  Are you able to discern the name?  In case it helps Thomas had been a school master turned farmer at Wheaton Aston, near Lapley, Staffordshire before emigrating to South Australia in 1854.  I am happy to provide samples of any letter combinations that may be helpful to clarifying the spelling of this surname.    I have found a second mention of this family in the same diary on Friday 2 May 1873:    Here the surname looks more like Scrutten and a search of [website]"
1164,Deep Web Search Tools for Genealogy?,"I somehow assume that there are more information publicly available on the internet about ancestors than google can/does show us. I see this sometimes when new relevant search results come up after I searched again for a known ancestors typing his/hers full name and a location, which was very prominent during his/hers life.  I have heard about the fact that most parts of the internet are not searchable (~90 %), see image below.   Is the deep web relevant to us in terms of genealogical research? Are there any (open source/commandline) tools, which can access the deep web or did I completely misunderstood the principle of the deep web?    "
1165,Average age at marriage in Highland Scotland in 18th century,"I am seeking the parents of my 3x-great-grandmother, Isabella Colville, who was baptised in 1785 in Invergowrie. According to her baptism record, her father was John Colville. Her eldest sibling (plural, actually – they appear to have been twins) were born in 1780, and the youngest in 1794.  I have two candidate Johns.   son of George Colville and Agnes Gibson, Dundee 1739 - early but close geographically - Invergowrie is part of the Liff and Benvie parish in what was then called Forfarshire, on the outskirts of Dundee, even though Invergowrie itself is in Perthshire.  son of John Colville and Margaret Newlands b Arbroath, 1755 - better timing but further geographically   While I've seen assertions that the average age at marriage was 25–30, I'm mindful of the old Scottish advice, quoted in the family history my aunt wrote:     Marry a woman whose child-bearing years are limited and who, as the eldest of a large family, is already experienced at housekeeping in an economical manner.   Indeed, Isabella's oldest child Elizabeth (my great-great-grandmother) was 36 when she married.  With that in mind, would it be unreasonable to expect that John was about 40 when he married and 55 when his youngest child was born?  Some initial Googling has not turned up any scholarly sources that would suggest late marriage was common in Scotland, but there is that folklore and a few verified examples even in my own tree.  I'm going to keep tracing the two Johns, as set out in the answers to this earlier question of mine, but in the meantime, are there any historical studies of population demography in Scotland that might help me? "
1166,Generational Loss of Data with DNA Testing,"I have personally done the Y-DNA, the add-on Y-block with FamilyTreeDNA, mtDNA, and new FamilyFinder/AncestryDNA (via Ancestry) which i plan in transferring to FamilyTreeDNA just recently as a base line.  I have a long way to go to understand how to process the results and the little colorful infopack from Ancestry.com on my Y-DNA and mtDNA tests were just worthless, but I would like to still think it is valuable to have the DNA raw results.   I am not completely clear on the next steps (and at this exact moment not concerned with that) but as I learn more about it and the usage of it in general evolves I do not want to 'lose access to information' as people pass, which is a concern with any research and would like to collect as much valuable information now while it is available.  Both of my parents are still living and my oldest living ancestors in my family in their late 50s but only one of my grandparents are surviving.   A) I have my 93 year old grand father on my father's side.  B) I have the sister of my grand mother on my father's side in her late 80s.  C) I have the sister of my grand father on my mother's side in her late 80s.  D) I have my mother as the oldest ancestor on my mother's side for females.   Also:   E) There is a big void in my family trees pre-1800 on many lines and I have been able to make contact with several individuals that ""may"" be related but their family line lost the last name usually with their parents or their grand parents. Many of these are in their late 50s or 60s and have agreed to take AncestryDNA test if it might be useful for my research.   My questions are related to resolution basically and the generational loss of detail that my results would not provide with each generation.    How much more additional benefit would I gain by having each of the individuals above (A-E) take Autosomal DNA test (via Ancestry or FamilyTreeDNA for example) ? Would the Autosomal be the 'best bang for the buck' test to request for each of them or should I have the oldest ones take a different test? Would having someone in group E take the Autosomal DNA test facilitate determination of how many generations ago we shared an ancestor, if at all or at least give a ballpark?   Update: Added Graphic 11/28/2015 To Illustrate what I am trying to link: AS AN EXAMPLE of one of the many things I am trying to tie together: I am a member of the 'J.S.' line, I have members of the 'C.S.' line willing to take the test lined up. We are trying to determine at this point primarily if 'C.S.' and 'J.S.' lines share a common ancestor. Both lines are trying to determine if we are related to the 'M.S.' or 'P.S.' lines but are unsure if DNA testing will really provide any great value in answering this testing at this point due to dilution, and if so what test should we be performing and on whom. The 'C.S' line we do not have a direct male descendant line but the 'J.S.' line does.   "
1167,How Complete is GEDCOM Export from Various Programs?,"One major concern when using my genealogy software program is that I can later export all the data that I entered to GEDCOM. This could be for the purpose of backup, giving to someone else who uses a different program, or possibly transferring from one program to another.  I do understand that GEDCOM does not transfer perfectly because some programs don't write it correctly and others do not read it correctly. But my concern here is whether or not all the data I enter into my program will be exported by my program into GEDCOM. If the data does not export in the first place, then it will be impossible to transfer it.   The test would be to use the program's data entry forms to put dummy data into every possible input field (maybe use the name of the input field so you can identify it again in the GEDCOM) and then see what does not make it into the GEDCOM. It would be necessary to locate every single input form, tab and window in the program where data can be entered.  I think it is very important to know what fields do not get exported to GEDCOM in the program I use. Knowing the fields that do not export will allow me to avoid bothering to enter any data into the fields.   If I decide to switch programs, I would like to see a comparison of how complete the GEDCOM exports are of those programs before I move to them.  Have there been any data ""coverage"" tests done on genealogy programs? Are there any vendors who have done this test on their own program and have shown that 100% of what is can be entered into it will be exported to GEDCOM?    Follow-up Dec 3: ColeValleyGirl pointed out in her comment on Arnold's answer that Family Historian stores all its data in a GEDCOM file. I checked and in fact there are no auxiliary files used. So FH is a case where 100% of its data is in the GEDCOM and it is safe to enter any information into Family Historian and not worry that you won't be able to get it out again.  The same would hold true for any program that solely uses GEDCOM for its file format. One other program I can think of that does this is Tom Wetmore's program Lifelines.   Of course, a program using GEDCOM as a database would have to either:   Export the data for non-standard features using many user-defined tags and non-GEDCOM standard structures, Not include many non-standard features, or Do the bad thing and allow users to input the data for those features, but save them outside the GEDCOM.   1 and 2 are okay. 3 would be bad. Family Historian tends to do the number 2 thing excluding many of the useful features other programs have, such as Place-level data or citation templates.  So Family Historian and Lifelines and other such programs that use GEDCOM as their entire database would be good programs to use without the worry of entering data that will not export again.  Now that we know this, I'm still interested in knowing if anyone has done this coverage test on programs that store their data in their own proprietary database format. "
1168,Genealogical records from Rensselaer county?,"I'm looking for genealogical records, specifically marriages and births, from the late 1700's and early 1800's from Rensselaer county. I'm struggling to find a good source of them online. Is there such a source online that is available, and if not, are there recommended sources to find them in a library, perhaps the Library of Congress?  For reference, I've searched every online source from the Family Search page, but it seems like many of the records from Rensselaer county are very fragmented. These sources include:   Abstract Wills of Resselaer County (Found some records, but only names) New York, Births and Christenings, 1640-1962 Names of Persons for Whom Marriage Licenses Were Issued By the Secretary of the Province of New York, Previous to 1784 New York Marriages, 1686–1890 10,000 Vital Records of Eastern New York (Found Edward Penney Jr and wife, which helped me to find some of his kids, but still looking for more about his family.) New York Marriage Notices Barber Collection- Newspaper Marriages Some Rensselaer Co. Residents Married in Bennington, VT, 1809-1828   As much as possible, I'm focusing on the period from about 1780-1830.  More specifically, I'm trying to track Edward Penney, born about 1742, married definitely to a Phebe (Maiden name unknown), and possibly to a Thankful Bangs. All marriage dates for him are unknown. He definitely had at least 3 sons, Ammiel, Benjamin, and Edward (Jr), and 5 daughters.  Their married names (as of 1824): Thankful Horton (Possibly Haughton), Rachel, Phebe Carpenter, Esther Marvel (Possibly Marble), and Hannah Townsend.   Edward definitely lived in Pittstown, New York when he died in 1824, as did his wife Phebe, who died in 1833. I've been able to piece together some information by searching, but I'm struggling to get anything more definitive. "
1169,How to organize your sources (digital system),"I'm using an application to store and work on my research. I can have a source, with multiple entities referring to it. Each entity has a unique ""page"" for the source. Additionally each source can have multiple media items under it. So I have sources like:   United States Census, 1920 United States Census, 1930 United States Census, 1940 Pennsylvania Death Certificates Ohio Marriage Records Ohio Marriage Certificate Ohio Death Certificate   Under each source I have Media images labeled like:   United States Census, 1930  Carnegie Ward 1, 15B Pittsburgh Ward 12, 6B Cleveland District 809, 10B  Ohio Death Certificate  1939, #44796 1948, #67623 1950, #66703    Each person/event is then sourced like:   John Doe, Death  Ohio Death Certificate, Page: 1939, #44796  Jane Doe, Death  Ohio Death Certificate, Page: 1948, #67623  Mary Poppins, Census  United States Census, 1930, Page: Cleveland District 809, 10B    Is this OK? Should I be doing it different? I thought about having each item be a source Ohio Death Certificate, Page: 1948, #67623 but then I would have a ton of sources in no real groups. Right now I'm at &lt; 500 people and &lt; 100 documents but I'm getting more documents each day. What so people with > 1000 people and documents do? "
1170,Catch 22: how do you know if a data provider's sub will be valuable to you — before you subscribe?,"One of the questions I constantly struggle with is how to evaluate whether it is worth it to me to subscribe or buy credits on Pay-Per-View (PPV) at the websites of the big data providers.  (Side note: if you are trying to evaluate whether a site will be useful to you, the question What can be gained by paying for a subscription website such as Ancestry.com? may also be of interest to you.  This question is about evaluating the coverage a site has for the historical record collections we want to search.)  One approach might be to look for a one-to-one correspondence between data sets (i.e. to examine whether a particular data set on Ancestry and Find My Past actually comes from Family Search and can be searched for free there), but what happens when someone has a data set exclusive to that subscription site?  How do you guess whether there will be enough people in the data set to make it worth your while, before you pay?  Especially now when times are tight, there are only so many subscriptions I can afford.  What are some search strategies I can use to figure out whether there will be enough content for me to subscribe?  As I get more experienced, and sign up for short-term subscriptions, I can see the value of making detailed research plans and keeping track of what records I want to find.   I'm currently using the following tools:   GenQuiry, the research manager written by our own ColeValleyGirl GenSmarts, a research-assistant program that reads your files and looks for gaps in your research GenDetective, a newer research-assistant program that has a different way of organizing things than GenSmarts A research journal (I use Scrivener and Scapple from Literature and Latte) and a research log (e.g. spreadsheets in LibreOffice Calc) Source Research Checklists similar to the ones designed by Crista Cowan (YouTube video) and DearMYRTLE and Cousin Russ (YouTube Video) Russ demonstrates a really cool feature in Google Sheets that allows you to run a Google search from within a sheet, so if you want to save links to particular databases within a sheet, it's easy to do so.  If you find a database like the WWI Draft Registration Cards behind a paywall, you can search for places you can find the same dataset for free.   What I'm looking for now are suggestions about how to run searches and evaluate the hits you get when a lot of the information that would tell you whether it might be the person you want (or not) is masked.  If the question isn't clear, let me know and I'll edit it.    Here's an example of what I mean by ""masked"" search results.  In my answer below, I will refer to the limited subset that shows up in the search result summary list as ""teaser results"":  Search results from Ancestry.com for the 1920 Census:  Logged in with a subscription:     Name  Parent or spouse names  Home in 1940 (City, County, State)     Birth Year  Birthplace  Relation to Head of House          Leo Durocher      George A, Clara     West Springfield, Hampden,   Massachusetts     abt 1906    Massachusetts   Son   If you pop out the information card:        Name:   Leo Durocher    Age:    14     Birth Year: 1906    Birthplace: Massachusetts   Home in 1920:   West Springfield, Hampden, Massachusetts    Street: Elmdale Avenue    Race:   White    Gender: Male    Relation to Head of House:  Son    Marital Status: Single    Father's Name:  George A Durocher    Father's Birthplace:    New York    Mother's Name:  Clara Durocher    Mother's Birthplace:    Canada    Able to Speak English:  Yes    Occupation: Apprentice   Industry:   Plumbing    Employment Field:   Wage or Salary    Attended School:    No    Able to read:   Yes    Able to Write:  Yes    Household Members      Name    Age    George A Durocher   43    Clara Durocher  41    Clarence Durocher   21   Raymond Durocher    19    Armand Durocher 16    Leo Durocher    14    Thomas Sweeney  21    Ruth Allen  35      And without a subscription (signed in as a 'registered guest', or free/unsubscribed user):     Leo Durocher      George A, Clara     city, Hampden, Massachusetts    abt 1906     Massachusetts   info   and the pop-out says:     Name: Leo Durocher    Age:  14    Birth Year:   1906          There's more to see    A picture of the original document    And things like Birthplace     Home in 1920    Street     Race    Gender     Relation to Head of House    Marital Status     Father's Name    Father's Birthplace    Mother's Name    Mother's Birthplace    Able to Speak English    Occupation     Industry    Employment   Field      Attended School    Able to read       Able to Write    Household Members      If you are in the US and you search the international collections, so much of the search result is masked out, it's difficult to guess whether the record might belong to anyone you are looking for.  How do you cope with the 'this might be, except that I can't see anything?' scenario? "
1171,"What churches in/near Ward 6, Albany, New York State might have baptized Scottish baby in 1854?","I have asked an earlier question about the brief time my 2nd great grandfather Robert John Steven Sellers and his parents Robert Sellers and Margaret Clacher spent at Albany in New York State as Finding New York City/State records relating to Sellars family (British subjects) births/deaths mid 19th century?  My understanding is that Robert John Steven Sellers was born on 3 Jan 1854 but I have no source for that precise date and I would like to see if I can verify or discount it.  The 3 Jan 1854 date would seem a little unlikely because on 10 May 1854 his mother ""Mrs Margaret Sellars"" and his older brother Hugh, aged 3, arrived in New York on the ""Mary Morris"" after travelling from Glasgow.  There was no infant recorded in the column for that purpose and it seems too soon after Robert's apparent birth date to have left him in the U.S.   From an answer to the earlier question it seems like, unless he was born elsewhere (which I have no reason to suspect), there is no possibility of me finding a civil registration for his birth:     For Albany, the Vital Statistics Department's genealogy page says they   began registering births and deaths in 1870.  So it appears that a birth    record won't exist for your relative who was born in Albany in 1854.   I am confident that he was born in Albany in 1854 because:   the 1855 New York State Census records one year old Robert John Stephen Sellers as living with his parents Robert Sellers and Margaret Clacher at Albany City, Ward 6, Albany, New York, USA (HOUSEHOLD NUMBER: 2, LINE NUMBER: 39, SHEET NUMBER: 11) and that he was born in the U.S. the 1861 Scotland Census records Robert Sillars, aged 6, born ""America, US"" the 1871 Scotland Census records Robert Sellars, aged 16, born ""State of New York Britsh Bubject, albany"" an 8 Jul 1874 Certificate of Discharge and Character from the ship Oakworth in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia says Robert Sellers was born 1854 in ""Albany, USA""   Where should I look for an 1854 baptism record of Robert John Steven/Stephen Sellers/Sellars/Sillars in Albany?  I think these pieces of evidence may help narrow the search:   His parents Robert Sellers and Margaret Clacher were married on 1 Feb 1850 at Brownfield Church, Glasgow, Lanarkshire, Scotland which seems to be at least associated with Glasgow Free Presbyterian Churches which may indicate their religion - although they came from Ayrshire and Dunbartonshire respectively so this church may just have been convenient for them.  They are recorded as residing in Glasgow but there is nothing to say that they were ""of the parish"". His grandfather Hugh Sellars had a variety store at 287 and 311 Washington Ave 1862-72 and was also recorded in the 1855 and 1865 New York State Censuses as living at Albany City, Ward 6 so it seems likely that this was part of their ""neighbourhood"".   Does the above perhaps point at any particular churches in Albany whose baptism records I could try to access?     I have not yet tried to find out how many churches were in Ward 6 of Albany in 1854.  The ""History of the First Presbyterian church of Albany, N.Y.; lists of its officers, and a complete catalogue of its members from its organization (1877)"" looks like it has the names of that church's members up until 1877 but does not include anyone by the name of Sillars, Sellars or Sellers. It looks like it may be possible to obtain a map to determine the boundary of Ward 6 of Albany in 1854 via FamilySearch.org which says:      A large collection of pre-1900 ward maps for every major American   city, including Albany, Brooklyn, Buffalo, New York, and Rochester, is   Ward Maps of United States Cities FHL film 1377700; 6016554–782  "

So would the person have left the Julian dates alone when entering in this document or would they have converted them to Gregorian?  I expect they would have been left alone, and that is how ancestry.com is showing this date (27 Nov 1751), but I would like confirmation. "
1176,Returning World War I era German dog tags?,"I have 2 World War I ""dog tags"", one each from two different soldiers, which provides name, DOB and some regimental info. One of them I think may include some address information. Is there any way I can research these individuals? Ultimately, if they've any living relatives, I would like to return these tags to them. Any ideas? "
1177,Interpreting comments and abbreviations on death record abstracts,"In the last few days I have been looking at abstracts / e-copies of Death Certificates on Ancestry and FamilySearch primarily. While I have not obtained any originals or photos of any yet I have seen great variation in the information on them and a great source of information for the information on the deceased parents if the information is available, especially in the comments section, if present.   My question, taking into account that certificates vary by state and time period: Is there a general guide for interpreting them and the abbreviations they may have in the comments sections?  For example in IL from the 1920s on one I found ""11d at place DTH"" .  Ref: FHL FILM NUMBER:  1818999, Death certificates for the state of Illinois, 1916-1945, excluding Chicago with the exception of stillbirths; index, 1916-1938; internet index, 1916-1950.  The rest of the family is known to have survived and they were buried 2 days after their death. I thought maybe there was a school fire (this is from a child) and searched Google and the County Historical Societies website which even has a 'Disasters"" section and nothing was mentioned. But this is just an example of why I want to know how to interpret them...  My question: I am looking for a reference guide I may use to interpret these type of comments and was wondering if anyone has come across any other guides like they have for other record types mentioned in the forum? "
1178,What could the numbers after an affidavit of a burial mean?,"In the parish records for Kirkheaton, West Yorkshire, some of the early 18th-century records have an ""aff."" notation at the end of a burial record (Ancestry.com example). I presume that means that the writer of the parish register received affidavits that the burial took place, rather than presiding over it himself.  Some of these notations have a number after them, as in this case of the infant son Thomas of one Joseph Jubbs of Whitely. You can see the next entry also shows a similar notation, with a 15 rather than a 12, for William son of Thomas Deison (sp?) of Dolton.    So I thought maybe it was the number of days the child lived, until I saw the same notation for the burial of an adult, incidentally for the same Deison family.    So I thought maybe this was the number of people who attested to the event, which took place in private burial grounds. The families concerned all seem to be located in villages within the parish but not near the parish church.  Does anyone have any information about what these numbers might mean? "
1179,What is uniform worn by Herr Schedler in photo taken late 19th century in Hannover?,"I have a scan of this photo.  It is believed to be the brother of Pauline Schedler (1860 - 1937).  She was born in Thann, Alsace, France and family legend has it she fled to the UK in the 1870s during the Franco-Prussian War.  Her parents were from Heilbronn and I think this brother was born there.  The photo is approx. 3cm x 10cm and was taken in Hannover.  I am assuming late 19th Century.  I am guessing this is a German uniform - is it military?  Anyone have any ideas how I can find out what uniform it is, or any other scraps or details and help me place Herr Schedler?    I also have this one, the family are not sure if it is the same person or a twin:   "
1180,"Are parents listed on marriage certificate ""proof"" of parentage?","I have traced back to a John McAllister born in 1856 in St Quivox, Ayrshire in Scotland.  I have his marriage certificate which names both his parents (Thomas McAllister and Martha Strachan) however I also have his birth certificate that only names the mother and labels him as illegitimate. On his birth certificate he is named ""John Strachan"" but then amended to ""Archibald Strachan"".  Archibald is Thomas's father's name.   He then appears in the 1861 census.  Martha McKie (MacKie is the surname of a previous husband/partner) is named as head of the house with her two sons William McKie and John McAllister.  Thomas and Martha marry later in 1861.  He then appears on the 1871 census as Archibald McAllister (same age) but from then on the name Archibald is never seen again and he goes as John McAllister.  Does the fact that Thomas is named as the father on John's marriage certificate give any certainty or does it only indicate that is who he considered his father (or even believed was his father)?  Does the fact he is named ""McAllister"" in the census while his mother is listed as ""McKie"" give additional weight to Thomas being the father?  Obviously not even an explicit legal document tells if he really is the biological father - only that he claimed to be.  To make things slightly more complex, Martha's family seems very dysfunctional with several illegitimate children.  UPDATE: After looking back at my records I have corrected some information above - in particular the marriage is not later in the year he was born but later in the year of the census. "
1181,How should I organise my family archive?,"I want to create a family archive of all the physical (non-digital) artefacts I have collected over the years and have wrestled with the proper way to do this with many false starts.    I need a system that helps me easily locate items but that is future proof, as the archive can only grow in size.  The items range from documents and photos, to souvenirs collected by my ancestors.  This is what I have come up with so far:   Create a digital copy of the item (i.e., scan or photograph). Transcribe it if appropriate. Describe it (what should be included here?) an index it (how?). Put in an acid free folder within an opaque box and label it. (how to label/reference?).   What are the best/recommended ways of organising the digital copies, transcripts, indexing the physical copies and labelling the folders and boxes?  I'd eventually love to make the digital version of the archive available online for all my relatives to enjoy. "
1182,"How to overcome, within reason, constraints in the US on obtaining older records not yet at 50/100 year mark?","Very much understanding the privacy concerns of possibly living individuals in the last 100 years I was wondering if there is alternative repositories for obtaining the details for genealogical purposes on a death certificate without obtaining a copy. In particular I am looking for pre-1950 and in most cases pre-1935 but after 1915 some of which may not be made public in my lifetime.  I really have no need in most cases for an image of one and like many online records just looking for a 'non-certified' summary with a source just to obtain things like mother and father, place of birth listed on the certificate, and a bonus would be cause of death. The parents in some states, you also need in some states to request a birth certificate even that extended beyond the 100 years so in some places it can be a catch 22.  For those who have not yet attempted this yet I included two examples below and I have discussed over the phone with usually very friendly and helpful Vital Records staff. None of these individuals to date so far knew off the top of their head how to get the information other than 'waiting it out', finding a child (which in some cases they are also deceased and their grandchild is not eligible), or finding an obituary in a newspaper or genealogical record to obtain the information. The couple that I have spoken to on the phone also do not provide 'unofficial copies', but only official ones with a single procedure.  Idaho: ""Birth records are legally confidential in Idaho for 100 years. Marriage, death and divorce records are legally confidential for 50 years. Only immediate family members or their legal representatives may receive copies of these records.""  Illinois: ""Original, photographic or microphotographic reproductions of original records of births 100 years old and older and deaths 50 years old and older, and marriage records 75 years old and older on file in the State Office of Vital Records and in the custody of the county clerks may be made available for inspection in the Illinois State Archives reference area""  Note: I have seen 100/100, 100/75/50, and 100/50 year periods.  I am aware that some information gets scanned and inputted into repositories like the Social Security Death Index, Newspapers.com, and eventually National Archives and some repositories on Ancestry.com.     My question: Has anyone identified alternative means (without executing legal action) to obtain information directly off of the certificates in another repository for those in particular that are pre-WWII, even if just death certificates summary information that have not quite reached the 100 year mark?  "
1183,What is written after John Lark's name?,"This snippet comes from Family Search and the parish of Trunch, Norfolk, England.    I started looking at this record because I believe John Larke was married twice, once to an Elizabeth Vial, and a second time to an Elizabeth Buttle (I guess he had a thing for girls named Elizabeth...). I have two questions from this record that are attempting to prove this theory:   What is written after John Larke's name? It looks to me like Single Mem, but that doesn't make any sense to me. Does the Number 2 in the lower left hand corner indicate a second marriage? Or is there any clue that would indicate this is a second marriage?  "
1184,Are there any Genealogical / Historical Photo Request Communities?,"I have been curious if there are any specific Historical Genealogical Photo Request Specific Forums / Communities out there that anyone knows about?  I am aware of the primary one for Find-a-Grave in which people request photos of gravestones and such, as well as one for ships which is of use for seeing what people immigrated on. I also know Genealogy.com also seems to have one but it seems to be very ill-frequented and not a lot of success.   My thought process is the following and why I ask: While searching Newspapers.com I came across several articles mentioning my relatives (some of which I have no photos of) and in some cases sketches, photos, or just physical descriptions of them. Specific examples are sporting events that someone may have taken photographs at or even a better example several members of my family have been in the clergy and conducted funerals and weddings, which at least for the later it is common for photos of the bride and groom to be photographed with the officiate of the ceremony.  I know in some cases I can contact local historical societies for sporting and community events, but they wouldn't likely have some of the more obscure events or large scale events where people are not identified (i.e. I'd have to find them in the crowd) as well as which someone might have remembered they photographed and have sitting in a box somewhere or on their computer (I for example have thousands of original photos in my possession).   I know there are stock photo agencies and the National Archives that are searchable which I have very limited success for historical specific historical photos for genealogical purposes, and have in some cases been successful searching Google Image Search and trolling Flickr for old family photos people have posted; none of these though facilitate a 'request' system for ""Does anyone have a photograph from or of..."".     The question: Where is a large enough and active community one can request a photo of a historical event or person and might within a reasonable time (a year or two) have a reasonable chance of getting a response from the community's users if well refined enough but not too specific of a request?  "
1185,How can I get Soviet era arrest documents?,I saw many people having arrest and interrogation transcripts of people arrested in the 1930s in the Soviet Union.  Where can I get such documents? Are they online? 
1186,"Is this a half niece/uncle relationship vs 1st cousin once removed, or something else?","I've been in search of my deceased father's biological family.  He was placed for a closed adoption 60+ years ago.  I've discovered the two families who parented him thanks to Ancestry DNA matches.  We've been able to narrow it down further on one side to a woman who I thought likely mothered him.  Her past and looks fit perfectly down to the year she placed a baby for adoption.    This woman's biological son took a DNA test to confirm our relationship.  He's only showing up as a 519 centimorgan match across 25 segments.  This is matching at about the same level as my father's 1st cousins (my first cousins once removed).  Is there still a chance he's my half uncle at these levels or a way we can confirm our relationship further?    I'm female and an only child.  Based on the results, I'm leaning towards him actually being a 1st cousin to my late dad but the coincidences of his mother's past are uncanny.  The chart levels I've been referencing show the half uncle/niece relationship falling between 540-1175cm, so we are just under that.   For further reference here: This man has another confirmed half brother from a different side (unrelated to my side) and he's only matching 1272cms to him which was at the low level of half siblings.  Chart levels for half siblings are usually between 1320-2100cm. Perhaps this man is at the low level with his half brother and me??    Two of my other close matches for first cousins once removed, from the same family, are showing at 422cm across 16 segments and 416cm across 21 segments.  I have one other first cousin once removed from the other side of my father's family coming in at a slightly higher level of 565cm across 25 segments.    I've done a 23 and Me test but he has not.  This is all strictly from Ancestry results.   "
1187,How to help adoptee find her father without outing him?,"I provide a lot of background, which may not all be essential. Feel free to skip to the question.  Background  I was contacted by a woman who got a 3rd cousin match with me online. She told me that she was an adoptee curious about her biological father, although she did not want to intrude on his life. She told me the little she knew about her father: his ethnicity and that he was in a certain branch of the armed services at a certain base 9 months before she was born. (She had already determined the identity of her late biological mother and had enjoyed getting to know her relatives on her mother's side of the family.)  In our entire family tree, I only found one man of the right generation who had served in that branch of the armed services. He was a second cousin of my father (as would be predicted by the DNA match). Searching online records, I found that a few years before the woman's birth, he was stationed at the base she mentioned. I was confident that I had discovered her father. Let me add that few people of my ethnicity join the branch of the military of her biological father. (Her DNA results showed her to be approximately 50% of this ethnicity, which differed from her biological mother's.)  My father's second cousin is still alive. After getting his email address discreetly from a close relative of his (without saying why I wanted it), I gave the man the above information, emphasizing that the woman did not want to importune or embarrass him and that we were willing to keep the relationship secret. I asked him to let me know if my conclusion was incorrect, in which case we'd keep looking, or how he would like to proceed if he was the father.  A week later, I received a reply emphatically stating that he could not be the woman's father, that he had only one serious relationship in his life, with the woman he married. (I had known he had gotten married a year or two after the adoptee was born and that his wife was still living.) He said the adoptee would have to look elsewhere and that he wished her well with the search.  He did not say that he was not at that location at the time the pregnancy originated or that he did not know the biological mother, whose name I provided. Yesterday, I thanked him for the information, asking if he knew any other family member who was in that branch of the armed services in that location at that time. If so, would he please tell the man or me. I have not gotten a reply (and don't expect one).  I would still like to help this woman find the identity of her father (if she isn't too discouraged by what has happened so far). Of course, I will suggest comparing her DNA with those of others of my paternal relatives so we can narrow the match down. (Right now, her DNA is on a different site than most of my relatives. FYI, I am knowledgeable about genetic genealogy. I'm a longtime member of Genealogy Stack Exchange but am using a different account to protect people's privacy, even though I've obscured the details.)  Question  How can I investigate this further without outing the father? If I email members of my extended family asking ""Do you know anyone who was in &lt;branch of the armed services&gt;, serving at &lt;name of base&gt; in &lt;year&gt;?"", everyone will think of this man (or anyone else in the family who meets the criteria). This would out the father, at least to relatives close enough to him to know these details. Neither the adoptee nor I wants to embarrass the father.  If I decide to start asking relatives, should I first let the veteran I emailed know that I will be doing so if he is unable to help me identify the father discreetly, or would that seem like blackmail? Should I wait to pursue this research until his death (he's an old man)? His wife's death? He has legitimate children.  Of course, I will do nothing without the adoptee's consent. What I would like to know is what course of action to offer/advise to her.  Update  The adoptee does not want the matter pursued, and I will respect her wishes. "
1188,What can I infer about John Wright from this 1841 census entry?,"The 1841 census for England and Wales (Piece number 1208, Book number 8, Folio number 26, Page number 2) has a John Wright aged 11 at Coventry Street, Kidderminster, Worcestershire, England. He is shown as being in a household on his own; the other household in the same property is that of Edward Harper a Publican.  Can I infer anything about John from this census record other than his name, approximate date of birth and county of birth? What circumstances might lead to an 11 year old appearing in the census in this way?    "
1189,Why would I match someone in a region neither of my parents do?,"I was surprised to find someone show up in FTDNA as a 2nd-3rd cousin to me (168 shared cM, 34 segments with a minimum length of 5 cM) but not among the 17,667 matches of my father or the 18,178 matches of my father.   Fortunately, the person's DNA was also on GEDmatch, where I could compare his DNA to mine and my parents'. The chromosome browser showed me as inheriting most of the segments that my parents had in common with that person; however, on chromosome 14, I had a 3.1 cM match to the person in a region in which neither of my parents matches him. Something similar occurs on chromosome 20, where my match with the unknown person (4.47 cM) is longer than my mother's match to him (3.13 cM) and my father has no match.  Is the likely explanation that my parents have matches too small to show up unless they're combined in me? For example, they could each have a 2 cM stretch:  Mom ------XX------- Dad --------XX----- me  ------XXXX-----   Or is there a different explanation? In general, what is a reasonable minimum cM threshold?  I am an Ashkenazi Jew. My parents are not closely related to each other. "
1190,Interpreting a Freemasons' Lodge Register,"According to the records available on Ancestry, Edward Harper of Kidderminster joined the Lodge of Hope and Charity on 30 April 1836 aged 35 (so born approx 1801, which ties up with the 1841 census when he was shown as aged 45); he was a victualler (later publican).  According to this source (from the same recordset) he continued as a member until 1844.    I'm having problems reading the word in the column for 1844 which (I assume) explains how/why he left. Other records on the page state clearly 'dead' or 'resigned' or 'excluded' or 'withdrew'.  The best I can read the reason here is '6withdw' which might mean withdrawal?  If it was withdrawal, how did that differ from resignation, and can I infer anything from the act of withdrawal instead of resignation?  It may be relevant (or a total red herring) that there's a death of an Edward Harper in Kidderminster in 1844 (aged 13 according to the GRO indices). Edward the Freemason had a son born in 1830 so it could have been him. However, I haven't found Edward the elder in the 1851 census and if the age at death for the 1844 death is mistranscribed (13 and not 43) it may be he died in 1844. I may have to order the death certificate to be sure. "
1191,Is this close family member on AncestryDNA a half sibling?,"on ancestry.com i got a ""close family"" match, with 1,430 centimorgans shared across 58 DNA segments - it says it could be a niece, aunt, or half sibling (range includes 1st cousin, but i have read that's unlikely?) i ruled out grandparent because of age. the person attached a small family tree (only 7 people)  there is a couple, gives where they were born and died, then says they had one son (name is private), then he married (shows his spouses parents, also both deceased) and that couple had one daughter. (assuming my match is the last person on tree - female) the tree stops there. only the deceased names are listed - i'm assuming the  couple at the top of tree are ""grandparents"" of my close match (and me?)....and if they had only one son and then they only had one daughter, then she couldn't be my aunt or niece or 1st cousin...so more likely my half sibling?   i just don't know where to go because i have such limited information, no addresses, or dates of immigration, or obituaries attached, this close match hasn't logged on to ancestry in months - another possibility is the tree was never completed. "
1192,Relationship to DNA match who may share my mother with my great-uncle,"I know this will sound far-fetched, but maybe someone can help me.  DNA Match through Ancestry shows:   'First Cousin' match at 820 CM over 37 segments (Let's call him Tom) 'Second Cousin' match at 541 CM over 32 segments (Let's call her Sue) 'Close Family' match at 1408 CM over 59 segments (Let's call him J.D.)   What I know from contacting Tom:   'First Cousin' (Tom) is the son of my great-uncle on my dad's side 'Second Cousin' (Sue) is the full sister of (Tom) 'Close Family' (J.D.) does not actually show a name, only initials, and his results are managed by 'Second Cousin' (Sue).  I know nothing else about him.   Questions:   Why are Tom and Sue different levels of cousin (1st and 2nd) to me if they are full siblings? How would J.D. be related to me? Is it possible that my mother could possibly be the mother to one of these matches (a 1/2 sibling)?  I know she had a 'creepy' uncle who she does not want to talk about, and on my birth certificate it shows there was one child born before me (she says it's a clerical error). If it helps, I am in my 50's and so are my matches (except J.D. whom I have no info about).   "
1193,How could we be related. All combinations make zero sense,"I the poster is K2 as related below  Objective:   Learn how T and G fit into the K's tree  T&amp;G appeared in DNA match with CM to K2 (K1 is still in testing)  BackGround  T and G are siblings born in the mid 47 and 57(Their parents were born in 1921) K and K2 are siblings born in 66  (Their parents were born in 43 and 44)  K2 and T match 971 CM across 35 segments.  K2 and G match 828 CM across 33 segments  K2 and CB who is G's daughter matches with 307 across 15 segments  According to DNApainter they say with 100% certainty that K2 and T's relationship is one of the following. The probability only drops to 96%  for the same relationship status between K2 and G.  Here are the possible combinations according to DNApainter and my (K2)'s explanation as to why this wouldn't make sense. And input is much appreciated. What am I missing??  Great Grandparent or Great Grandchild possibility = That can’t be, were only 19 years apart.   Great Uncle/Aunt or Great Niece/ Nephew= Again for that be true the T and G would both have to be siblings to K and K2 grandparents. Again, K and K2's grandparents were born between 1908 and 1924.  Again, extremely unlikely in my opinion.   Half Aunt/ Uncle or Half Niece Nephew. = That would require you both to be half siblings to either one of K and K2’s parents. K and K2’s parents were born in 43 and 44. Or that K and K2 both are half siblings to T and G’s parents. T and G’s parents born in 1921, K and K2 born in 66.  1st Cousin= That would require one parent from T and G to be a full sibling to one of K and K2’s parents. Again, since both 2 sets of parents are 23 years apart, I find that extremely doubtful.  Additional info  To be clear I (K2) DON'T recognize anyone on shared matches with T or his sister G. I do have known DNA matches myself, these matches are My dad’s 1C This person would be my Dad’s Mom,  Brothers son. That would make him to me 1C1R  Next known connection for me. This person is my Dads 1C. This person would be my Dads Moms Sisters son. That would make him to me 1C1R  Next know is a 2nd cousin. She is the daughter of the above referenced 1C1R  Next known connection is a 2nd cousin. His Dad and my Mom are 1st Cousins.  These 2 first cousins, mothers are sisters (My Mom and his Dad)  None of these known people match anyone from T and G or shared matches.  So “ If I understand this”. The connection to T and G for me HAS TO BE on my Moms Dad side or on my Dads, Dad side. I say that because I have cousins that don’t match T and G from my Dads Mom side and my Moms Mom side. Is that correct?  So I presume having my Moms DNA tested should either say its her and her Dads side, or she will not make a connection to T and G , then by deduction it will have to be my Dads Dad side that T and G fit into. Is that correct??   Assuming my Mom isn’t a match for T and G, would having a DNA test on my Dads 1C , the relation would be my Dads, Dad, Brothers son  Would that help answer where T and G fit in? , if the connection isn’t on my Moms side  Unfortunately, the older generations are dying off quickly. "
1194,Who were the wives of John Ervin (1791-1843)?,"According to Benjamin Shinn in Biographical Memories of Blackford County (The Bowen Publishing Company, 1900, p. 240):     John Ervin was prominent among the early settlers. His early life was   spent in Maryland; then he lived in Perry county, Ohio, and came here   in 1837. He was married twice, his wives being half sisters.      There were ﬁve children by the ﬁrst wife and eight by the second. The   oldest, Naomi, married Hamilton Wheatcraft, and after his death she   married Nicholas Friend, the ﬁrst sheriff of Blackford county. They   soon went to Iowa; the second, Nancy, married Francis H. Graham,   probably the ﬁrst merchant in Hartford City, who came from Belmont   county, Ohio. He returned to Ohio and in about 1865 went to Missouri.   He was a Methodist preacher, and died in 1875 while he was presiding   elder of the Macon City district. Mary, the next child, married   Frederick Seelig, at one time county agent and afterwards county   commissioner. Samuel was the next, and was one of the county’s best   citizens, and Sophia, the youngest of the ﬁrst children, became the   wife of Abraham Cassel, the ﬁrst county surveyor.      Elizabeth, the   oldest of the last wife’s children, married Rev. William Anderson, a   Methodist minister. The other children were: George W., James E.,   Daniel A., William McK., Jacob E., Benjamin F. and Joshia E. The   latter, the only one living, has been for many years a Methodist   preacher in the North Indiana conference, and John Ervin himself was a   local preacher of considerable ability.   I have been trying to identify John Ervin's wives.  Children of John Ervin and his first wife  John Ervin's first daughter, Naomi, was born in 1812. Samuel Ervin appears in the 1880 census, in which the birthplaces of his parents are listed as Pennsylvania. Sophia (Ervin) Cassell, the last child of John Ervin's first wife, was born in 1816. From this, we know that the first wife was of childbearing age in 1812 and lived into 1816.  Children of John Ervin and his second wife  I know that John Ervin was buried with his [second] wife, Catherine Jane, who died June 30, 1849, in either her 40th or 46th year (the inscription is unclear). According to the 1880 census record for James E. Ervin, his mother's birthplace as Maryland. The death certificate for John and Catherine Jane's last child, Joshua Evan Ervin, lists his parents as John Ervin and Catherine Micky, both birthplaces of Indiana.  I have not been able to find anyone named Catherine Micky. I suspect her maiden name is the same as the full middle name of their son, identified by Shinn as William McK. Based on the dates of births of William's older brother George Washington Ervin and his younger brother Jacob Emory Ervin, I know William's birth was between 1828 and 1840.  Can any of you determine William McK Ervin's full name or the full names of John Ervin's two wives? I have not been able to find John Ervin's will or any relevant information about him not shown here or on his WikiTree page, which I wrote. Further information I have collected on the family is visible in my Ancestry tree (free account required). "
1195,Confirming a connection,"Ancestry connected me with 2 people that are siblings, (Unknown to me) .Our DNA match between me and the other 2 is  850 and 971 CM respectively. They are 10 and 20 years older than me as well.  Based on timelines and Geographical proximity to my Paternal grandparents, I'm left to wonder if my Grandfather was biologically my Dads Dad or not. My THEORY is that these 2 siblings Dad may be my biological Grandfather before he even met his subsequent wife and had children. These 2 would then fit right in on the DNA match percentage to me , the timeline makes sense, and their Dad was living in the small neighborhood of my grandmother during the time of my Dads birth.  My Grandparents only had 1 child (My Dad) 5 years into their 10 year marriage. (That alone seems odd)  I am able to trace DNA and known relationships to my Dads Moms family and my Moms, Moms family. So I do know who my parents are.   I have asked an elderly first cousin of my Dads to take a DNA test and he has agreed. Since my Dad and his cous share a grandfather, there should be some DNA connection to me and my Dads cousin. (I would think). If there ends up being no connection, how can I establish that these 2 siblings actually are the half siblings to my deceased father?. Right now besides the connection to these 2 children and that their dad was living close by to my Grandparents, I have nothing else to prove that their Dad is my grandfather (biological). Is there some other test , or something in our DNA results that would be more conclusive?  As a followup... I am a Male. The 2 siblings are 10 years apart. one Male, one female. The male to me and him match 971CM, I match 850CM to his sister "
1196,DNA results from Ancestry,"A friend of mine took a DNA test with Ancestry.com a while back. Now I (a trained mathematician) am being asked to help interpret the results, and I am finding myself totally out of my depth.   The main traits come from three regions, A shows 36%, B shows 35% and C shows 23%, respectively. The parents are known to have migrated from region A and B, respectively, and from relatively homogeneous populations, and I was wondering about region C. My take on this is that percentages ought to hew closely to integer multiples of (1/2)^n$; a fraction of 1/3 seems unlikely. So I read the 36% and 35% as really both being approximations of 3/8, and the 23% being an approximation of 1/2. I then figured that this means that each parent is 3/4 of their respective base region, and 1/4 of region C. Interpreting this further, I ventured the guess that of the four great-grandparents on both the maternal and paternal lines one was a carrier from region C.  Does any of this make sense? Is there any place where I could read up on the mathematics of genetics?   (FWIW, Ancestry also gives confidence bounds. For Region A these are 21% and 49%, for region B they are 28% and 42%, and for Region C they are 15% and 30%. Given that the percentages are highly correlated --- they have to add up tom something close to 1, for instance --- this seems consistent with my interpretation.) "
1197,Phased psuedo-kit on GEDmatch -- what accounts for huge drops in SNP count?,"I guess first I should make sure I understand how GEDmatch stores raw data -- I'd guess that during ""tokenization"", GEDmatch turns my raw data file into a format that it likes, i.e., perhaps replacing A, T, G, C with numbers or replacing names of loci with numbers, etc. And because raw data comes from different companies in different forms, this process ""standardizes"" the information GEDmatch is using. But I assume it is equivalent to having the information in my file -- i.e., a list of loci names, corresponding chromosome and position, and a pair of nucleotides, i.e., A, T, G, or C.  Is this essentially correct?  I saw recently on another forum a description of what GEDmatch does to create a psuedo-kit phased between a parent and child:  ""They are then simply taking the SNP differences between the child's kit and the parent's kit, removing those alleles of the tested parent that can be confirmed to be necessarily present in the other parent, removing any no-calls, and creating the new ""pseudo kit"" from those values...which will always have decidedly fewer SNPs than actual raw test results. ""  Here's what I draw from this post:  As I understand it, a phased parent/child kit is a substitute for the child's kit. The idea is that the substitute will reveal matches to the child known to be on that parent's side.  It sounds like data is stored as pairs of alleles, and when a single allele in the child does not match either allele of the corresponding pair in the given parent, it is attributed to the other parent and stripped out, and no-calls are stripped out as well.    Is this roughly what the phased kit will contain?  Then here's the problem I can't wrap my brain around: I would guess less than half of the alleles would be removed since one allele in each pair for the child DID come from the given parent and sometimes both parents would have matching alleles by chance (Also I presume the no-call percentage is just a few percent).    Using GEDmatch Genesis, I phased my kit with my mother's (hers was uploaded to GEDmatch) and saw the number of tokens decrease from 450000 to 190000 in the phased pseudo-kit.  Perhaps this has something to do with Genesis being in beta and the kits being on the different sites, but I've heard reports of SNP counts dropping almost 10-fold between a kit and a pseudo kit.  And in my own case, the number of tokens used used for chromosome 1 dropped from 37969 to 0 after phasing!  What is wrong with my understanding and accounts for these huge drops in amounts of data? "
1198,Is Whole Genome Testing in any way useful for Genealogy?,"There are several DNA testing companies out there that are excellent for genealogists. These include Ancestry DNA, Family Tree DNA, MyHeritage DNA and 23andMe.   These companies provide match lists of possible relatives, links and hints to the family trees on their sites, tools to compare DNA segments, and ability to download your matches or raw data so that you can work with them offline or upload them to other sites (like GEDmatch).  From a DNA sample, they can provide autosomal, X-DNA, Y-DNA and mt-DNA information, each of which is useful for genealogists in their own way.   These tests sample about 700,000 SNPs out of the approximately 10 million SNPs we have. They were selected because they are the SNPs that vary most between humans. There are almost 3 billion more locations that don't vary among humans.  A whole genome test will test all 3 billion positions. It has come down in price and may be obtained from some companies for less than $1000.  For example, the company YSEQ does a Whole Genome Sequence, where they say:    … but they don't say what it is that makes this ""Specifically for Genealogy Researchers"".  So my question is if there is anything useful to a genealogist, for the purposes of helping to find their ancestors, that a whole genome test can provide that would provide enough added value over and above the standard autosomal, Y-DNA and mtDNA tests, that will make it worth the purchase?  i.e. Should I get a whole genome test? If so, how will it help me advance my genealogical research?  Would the same hold true for a whole Exome sequencing test? "
1199,Finding illegitimate boy after birth in 1903?,"Edward James Logan Reid was born in May 1903 to Margaret Reid. I can find no record of him until 1923 in Canada as Edward James Fraser. Margaret had married James Fraser in Ontario in 1915.  Where was he?   Who was his father?   He was well educated. He never married and his history only became provided after my mother, his sister died. A real mystery.   And where did the name Logan come from?   He was born in Edinburgh and died in Brampton, Ontario. "
1200,What do you do with photos after scanning them?,"I've acquired four trunks filled with old pictures, some in frames, some loose, that I'm planning on scanning into my genealogy program.  What does one do with them after scanning?  Surely you wouldn't toss them.  Donate them somewhere?  Pawn them off to another relative?  Keep them around forever?  I'm not sure I want to keep four trunks filled with old pictures around.  Has anyone dealt with this issue? "
1201,"Are there different amounts of ""fuzziness"" in the endpoints when doing pairwise 1-1 comparisons among three people at GEDmatch?","I was performing a triangulation at GEDmatch and obtained the following start and end points for the triangulated segment on Chromosome 1 for each comparison:  Person A with Person B:     19,899,991   to  35,145,961  Person A with Person C:     29,909,642  to   36,528,222  Person B with Person C:     29,812,459  to   40,717,609  It is clear from the total shared cM that none of these people is closely related to any other, so these are definitely half-matches on these segments.  I infer then that there is a single chromosome segment that each of these people has an identical copy of going from  29,909,642  to   35,145,961  Now it would seem to me that the shared segment between A and C continuing to the right of this to position 36,528,222 and the longer segment shared between B and C continuing on to 40,717,609 really must be a match on that same chromosome -- it would be too unbelievable that the match had just switched over from one of the two chromosomes to the other and matched up perfectly.  So it seems reasonable to infer that if it were possible to splice these three segments together to form one large segment from  19,899,991 to 40,717,619,  then the shared common ancestor who gave rise to these segments would have a copy of this long segment on one of his/her chromosomes.  Even though the ends of this segment were not triangulated, the fact that they are contiguous with the triangulated segment inherited from the common ancestor makes it very, very likely that they also descended from the same ancestor.  Is that a reasonable deduction? (The rest of what I write makes this assumption.)    It is not possible to tell exactly which chunk of this long segment A got by a single comparison with either B or C, but you should be able to figure it out from the two comparisons together.  However, in this example, I seem to run into a paradox:  From the A to B comparsion, either A or B must have only a piece of the inherited segment ending at 35,145,961.  Looking at the A to C comparison, which has endpoint 36,528,222 significantly farther along the segment, it would seem to be B who has the segment that stops at 35,145,961.  But looking at the B to C comparison, it would seem that person B got a piece of the ancestral segment continuing at least as far 40,717,619, the conclusion from the previous sentence.  So I am confused.  Can this be resolved by saying that 36,528,222 is not actually significantly farther than 35,145,961?  That there was a different amount of fuzziness in the right endpoint when doing the A to B and A to C comparisons?  1.4 million positions to me seems like it would be more than fuzz, but perhaps not?  If that really is a significant difference, what else can account for the comparison data above? "
1202,"Conducting research on Chinese village named P'an Yu, Guangdong Province?","According to audio recordings of my grandfather, he was from a village called Pung Wu, that he said was as large as the city of Vancouver and filled with many shops. I think that he means P'an Yu (Panyu District), that was incorporated into the megacity of Guangzhou.  This makes sense, since his father also came to Canada around 1884-85 to work for the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) and approximately 85% of the Chinese living in Canada at this time came from one of three counties: T'ai-shan, K'ai-ping and P'an-yu [source: Home County and Clan Origins of Overseas Chinese in Canada  in the Early 1880s, by David Chuen-Yan Lai]. Also according to the above source, the Chinese displayed ""chain migration"" similar to other ethnic groups where multiple members of families or villages over the years would migrate to a new region or country. They then tended to follow in the professions of their village-mates or relatives. I have found mention of other Chinese with the same clan name as my grandfather coming in the 1870's to work for CPR. It is mentioned that they are from ""Panyu"".  So, it seems likely that there is some family migration happening starting as early as 1870 from Panyu to Canada and that these men were employed in the railroad.     Unfortunately, the likelihood of locating information on ancestors who worked on the construction of Canadian railroads is remote. This is true not only of the Chinese, but also of others who were employed in railway construction. There is a Canadian Pacific Railway Archives, but its holdings relate to the operation of the railway, not to its construction. The contractors who built the railway and the sub-contractors who hired railway workers on their behalf, were usually not Canadian, and it is doubtful that their records have survived. The genealogical search is further complicated because, in the case of the Chinese, labourers were not hired as individuals, but in large groups of perhaps one thousand men [source: Vancouver Public Library, Chinese-Canadian Genealogy].   Is it is possible to find BMD, emigration or other travel-related records for a Chinese village in English? How should I tackle this?  "
1203,How should I deal with different alphabets?,"How should I record a name when a different alphabet was the ""native alphabet"" of the person?  For example, Polish, Czech and Russian letters aren't well represented in Latin (modern portuguese) alphabet. Recording names, places, and so on, using just ""my alphabet"" could make it harder for someone looking for informations about my family.  And it gets worse when we're dealing with my wife's parents, since his father is japanese...  How can I deal with that? What approaches have you used ? "

1205,Could 'Annie' be a Pseudonym for Augusta,"There is a branch of my paternal grandmother's family that I am currently trying to document. I have a copy of her grandfather's (my great grandfather) birth certificate.    I apologise for that rather rushed stitching together of two images.  As you can see from this, his fathers name was John William Holmes and his mothers name was Annie Holmes, formerly Wate.  The place of residence is listed as 95 Christian Road.  While searching for records on-line of John Joseph and his family, I have been unable to find any records that match all three names. Annie is always missing. I have tried Ann, Anne, Annie, etc.., but to no avail.  However, there is an 1881 census record that list the father as John Wm Holmes, the son as Joseph John Holmes and the mother as Augusta Holmes. This lists the address of Joseph John's birth as being Commercial Rd.  There is also a young daughter by the name of Annie Augusta Holmes.  Knowing the area quite well (I used to deliver camera equipment in London) I know that Commercial Road in Tower Hamlets, London has a junction with Christian Street. Not only that but 95 is at the end that intersects Commercial street. Link to Google maps for your reference.  So, the questions I am asking are:   Can I be reasonable confident that this census record relates to my ancestors? Could it be that Annie was a pseudonym for Augusta? If so, why would she declare her name to be Annie on one offical document and Augusta on another 5 years later?  "
1206,Was there a special Marriage license for Non-US Citizens in 1925?,"My Great Uncle and Aunt sailed from Belfast, Northern Ireland to New York in August 1925.  They were married on 25th November 1925 in Philadelphia and i have never been able to obtain a wedding certificate.  My Great Aunts sister had been living in Philadelphia since 1921 and I am guessing they lodged with her until they moved onto British Guiana in early 1926.  In my quest to find a wedding certificate  Question:  As they never became American citizens would they have needed a special type of license to get married in Philadelphia?  I have already contacted the Philadelphia County Marriage Records and they are asking for €35 just for an initial search.  I want to ensure before I authorize this (or be as sure as I can) that the record could be there.  Is there anywhere else  in the State they could be?  I have added more information on this link which may provide clues as  it details everything I have discovered about their movements in the 1920s  Marriage Details   Date of Marriage: 25th November 1925 Husband:  Thomas Frederick Smith Wife: Charlotte Evelyn Silcock   Adage:  As suggest by GeneJ (comments)  I have reviewed the Philadelphia Marriage Index, for Thomas Smith (Image 129 of 339), Thomas Smyth (Image 137 of 339) without any luck.  I am 100% sure they were married 25th November 1925 in Philadelphia as it states this information on Thomas's WW2 records, his last will and testament and Evelyn Smith probate.  I am guessing because Philadelphia County records want to charge me for a search, then there must be more marriage records than what appears on this index. "
1207,Gravestones without date of death seems odd. Is it common?,"One of my objectives is to find the gravestones of my ancestors. I notice many of them have date of death and age of the deceased instead of the birthday. This makes a certain sense to me since it's something known at the time of death. However some (two examples are a husband and wife David Andrews and Naomi Briggs (Andrews)) have the date of birth but do not have the date of death, even the year. One has the place of death (which would imply if was done post mortem so wasn't just a case of a precut memorial while the person was still living). Was this a common practice at some point or was it unique to this particular couple? "
1208,Were 19th century Austro-Hungarians in Sweden or Swedes in Austria-Hungary (Carpathian Mts)?,"I am researching a family that I strongly believe has Carpatho-Rusyn roots, at least on one side. However, I have not been able to find any birth information for any of the children, their parents, or THEIR parents. I've conducted a very thorough search at this point for birth information without any success.   Strangely, I've discovered birth information for 3 individuals that match perfectly to this family...IN SWEDEN. Until discovering these birth records there was absolutely NO connection to Sweden, or anywhere outside of present-day Hungary, Ukraine, or Slovakia. None whatsoever. Everything matches - names, years of birth. Just the location is wrong.   Is there a historical reason Austro-Hungarians in the 19th century would have traveled to rural Sweden? (Kalmar, Lönneberga)   Could it have been for work or military, for example?   On the reverse end, would there have been a reason for Swedes to travel to the Carpathian Mountain region?   The male has a surname that isn't striking me as ""Swedish"" (Almas), while the female has a definite Swedish ring to it.   Could a Swede and an Austro-Hungarian have met somewhere?   I find this so unlikely, but I want to investigate all of the possibilities before I dismiss these records since they fit perfectly. "
1209,Elinor is a Hassall (identifying a Welsh woman born in the late 18th century from a single record),"In 1805, according to the Bishops Transcripts for Little Newcastle in Pembrokeshire, Wales, Elinor Hassall married John John. John, his descendants and relatives of the family were predominantly Baptists, so it seems reasonable to assume that Elinor was as well. The Parish Registers for marriages in Little Newcastle haven't survived pre-1813, so no information about witnesses etc. is available.  I haven't been able to identify where Elinor might have been born; there are no other HASSELL/HASSALL/HAZEL events that I can trace in Little Newcastle. Where I might look for her?  Elinor is my great x4 grandmother.  Additional information:   The 1841 census for Little Newcastle suggests that Elinor was born between 1781 and 1786. She isn't present in the 1851 census, so most likely died before then. This region of Pembrokeshire is just above the Landsker so it is possible that she would have needed to speak Welsh day-to-day, so may have been born in a Welsh-speaking area. In correspondence with a descendant of the Hassalls of Kilrue/Llanfihangel Penbedw and formerly Worcestershire) we have been unable to establish a legitimate link (and are pretty sure there isn't one, among other things, as that family were Anglican). Nor can I find a legitimate link to Charles Hassall of Eastwood, near Narberth (related to the Hassalls of Kilrue), although he was steward to the Llanstinan estate, which wasn't that far from Little Newcastle. David John in his journals says that he does not know any further details other than her name (Elinor) and the fact that she married John John, who was brother to David John's grandfather.   Edited to add:    My current possibilities for Elinor (in no particular order) are:   Her name wasn’t Hassall at all – the incumbent at Little Newcastle made a mistake  filling in the PR or BT. This would be more likely if there were other Hassalls in the parish that he was accustomed to dealing with, but I can’t find any trace of another Little Newcastle baptism burial or marriage involving a Hassall or any variant. Her name was Hassall but she originated further afield, as all the Hassalls I’ve found in Pembrokeshire are linked to a single prominent Hassall line (of Kilrue/Eastwood), and she clearly isn’t a legitimate member of those lines (according to the descendents of that line who have researched it thoroughly). I’d need to explain how she ended up in Pembrokeshire in 1805 without (apparently) any nearby family – perhaps she was in service? She married into a Welsh-speaking family, but language may not have been a barrier.  Her name was a variant of Hassall – Hassell, Hossall, Hazel, Haskell, etc. There are some Haskells baptising and burying a child in Gumfreston circa 1812, and of course there could be others lurking in parish registers (or indices) I don’t have access to.  Her name was Hassall, she was the last of her line and all the previous events in her family are in lost PRs or non-conformist records. She was the illegitimate daughter of Charles Hassall ( a member of the prominent Hassall family in Kilrhue/Eastwood) and she (and/or the incumbent at Little Newcastle) knew her parentage. (She married before the death of Charles Hassall, which may or may not be significant). Given the standing of Charles Hassall, there is unlikely to be a smoking gun in the form of a bastardy bond or similar (he could have afforded a private settlement), and the PRs for Little Newcastle are lost for the relevant period, but of course she might show up in another parish with a helpful notation from the incumbent… or in chapel records. Of relevance: Charles Hassall was steward of Llanstinan (not too far from Little Newcastle) possibly about the time than Elinor was conceived;and Elinor's eldest son was called Charles, the first recorded time that name had appeared in her husband's family.   I may be missing some possibilities? "
1210,Why was my great-grandfather honorably discharged from the US Army so many times?,"Just this morning I found the military records of my great-grandfather. The first thing I noticed among them are an unusual number of honorable discharge papers.       Dates of Service     | Reason for Discharge ----------------------------------------------------------   7 Jul 1911 -  6 Jul 1914 | Expiration of term of service 29 Jul 1914 - 21 Jun 1920 | Sec 30 Act of Congress Approved June 4, 1920  4 Aug 1920 -  3 Aug 1923 | Expiration term of service  4 Aug 1923 - 20 Sep 1924 | purchase per section III. for 18, AR. 615-360  1 Oct 1924 - 30 Sep 1927 | Expiration of service  1 Oct 1927 - 30 Sep 1930 | Expiration of service  1 Oct 1930 - 30 Sep 1933 | Expiration of service  1 Oct 1933 - 30 Sep 1936 | Expiration of service  1 Oct 1936 - 30 Sep 1939 | Expiration of service             - 31 Dec 1942 | Retirement*   I was previously under the impression that it was abnormal to re-enter the military after being discharged, so it shocked me to see so many discharge papers. However, this makes it seem normal to be discharged after each assignment.  Why go through the formalities of discharging and re-enlisting? Why not just have some vacation time between terms of service? Was my great-grandfather fickle? Or was this normal in the early 1900s?  * Technically, retirement is not a form of discharge "
1211,Is there a standard reference for alternative forms of a given or personal name?,"I learned as a child that Uncle Jim was really my father's brother James. As a beginning family historian, I discovered that my g-g-grandfather often wrote the same name as Jas.  I could learn more of these the hard way (by treating one person in my tree as two) but I will never know how much I don't know. It seems that programs like Ancestry must have an automated way to match up different names that are really the same.  I want to look for a reference work that will list the possible names that one person might go by. But I am not even sure what to call it. Some will be simple contractions, others are almost abbreviations with extra letters added, and then there are ones that seem like individual nicknames until you find that several people with the same real name share them.  So is there a standard reference that genealogists would use for this? Or is there even a term for these modified or variant given names that a librarian would recognize when I ask for help?   "
1212,Any restrictions on the use of municipal coats-of-arms?,"One element of documenting family history is to place the lives of ancestors in the context of their place and time.  Many of the places we study have their own history, evolving from farming villages to manufacturing centres to dormitory suburbs (for example). That history is documented in many different forms, included the design of armorial bearings. The images selected to represent the area can provide important insights into its nature and history.   All kinds of entities can possess (so-called) coats-of-arms -- people, families, organizations and municipalities (towns and other levels of government). I am referring to the designs usually depicted on a shield or a flag, NOT the more elaborate presentations used as seals on documents.   Typically, there are restrictions on the use of arms, which may be outlined in the grant document. We normally hear about people who use individual coats-of-arms as if they were family coats-of-arms, without authorization. And organizations will protect trademarks.  A town (or similar body) may not only display its arms on its official buildings, but also mould them into street furniture and even print them on bus tickets. You can also see the use of municipal shields and flags in a lot of non-official settings.   Who has a ""right"" to display images of these? Is residence (current or former) in the area a sufficient reason? What are the other restrictions on the use of municipal coats-of-arms? It seems that municipal coats-of-arms treated differently to individual/family coats-of-arms. Why? "
1213,Where is the transcription effort for various census and other large record sets documented?,"I am looking for a description of the process that was used to transcribe data in the various censuses (US, UK, etc.). I would like to know some basic statistics about the process:   When was it done for the various censuses?  How many people were involved? What sort of error checking was performed? How many records were processed in total? On average per transcriber? Were transcribers paid or were they volunteers? Were some paid for QA?   In particular, I am interested in the description of the earliest examples of this kind of work.  CLARIFICATION:  I am interested in understanding the effort that was required to coordinate a large group of volunteers to convert a set of handwritten documents into an electronic format that subsequently can be indexed. No two collections (or transcription efforts) are the same, so I don't think there is a single answer to each of my sub-questions. Rather, expect that the various censuses were all done differently, but an overall average effort may emerge as the single answer. I would be very happy with some references that document the transcription and QA processes. Does this help clarify some of the issues raised in the comments? "
1214,Correctly identifying individual who goes by multiple names?,"This question is general to all inquiries where a person has differing last names in multiple records. In my particular case, I am researching my 3rd great grandfather Simon Zoller (1840-1902) and I have noticed that his last name differs in many records during his lifetime. I have found records with the first names of Simon and Simeon and the last names of Zoller, Zollar, Zolar, Soler, and Solar in marriage, census, and death records. Since his last name is not consistent, I want to be absolutely sure I have the right person when I attach documents to him in my family tree application.   To complicate matters, I was not previously aware of the name of his first wife. According to 1870 US census, the oldest child in the household was born around 1860 but my 3rd great grandmother Caroline was born around 1848. Due to the unlikelihood of her being a mother at the age of 12, I have concluded that she must have been his second wife and I have been looking for records of his first wife. I found some marriage records for a potential first wife Margaret (but no death record) using the familysearch.org with the last name Solar, but how can I be sure I have the right person? My grandfather thinks it unlikely that my ancestor would be called Solar in any records so I am trying to amass enough data in order to definitively say I have identified his first wife.  This is the data I have been using to tell myself I have the right person and not a person with a similar name:   Matching or similar first name.  Matching or similar last name. Matching birth year.  Matching birth state.  Matching occupation. Matching residence (city, county, and/or state).  Marriage date to first wife fits the timeframe of the birth of the first child.  Daughter born the same year as marriage to second wife also is named Margaret. 1860 census record for Simeon and Margaret Soler live nearby a Phillip Soler, whose birth date and state match brother Phillip Zoller in 1850 census.   How can I be sure I have the right person? What criteria need to be met for a genealogist to conclude that two records are referencing the same person, despite differences in name spelling? What particular data points and how many data points does one need to conclude that there was not a similarly named person living in the area around the same time and that I in fact have the right person?

1215,What were UK reserved occupations during World War 2?,"In the United Kingdom, men in certain essential occupations were exempt from military service in World War 2.     Which occupations were reserved?   Is there an accesible list or reference book I could refer to?   Did the list of reserved occupations change during the war?  "
1216,Where can I find more information on Danish 16th century priests?,"My family is from Gotland, and in my family tree I have two priests who moved in from Denmark(*). Since Gotland nowadays is Swedish and these men are from Denmark I'm stuck, I know nothing about how to research this in Denmark.  I know Danish records from this time is sparse, but I wonder if there may be some other wedge into this? How did priests get educated during this time in Denmark? Maybe those institutions kept records?  Note that I'm not looking for advice on how to find information about people in general. I'm asking specifically where I can find information about Danish 16th century priests.   (*) Søren Jensen - dead about 1593, and Påvel Nielsen, 1536-1620 "
1217,Are there online searchable Census Records for Australian states other than NSW?,"At Ancestry.com there are searchable Census Records for New South Wales (NSW) but no other states - are these available elsewhere?  I am particularly interested in any from South Australia (but other states too) because I have hundreds of ancestors and relatives from there (dating back to at least 1849) and would like to fill in the story of where they lived, and what they did to a level of detail greater than Births, Deaths and Marriages (which I am also occasionally missing).  I can get some of that from digitised newspapers at Trove but with Census records of England and Wales for the same period being so accessible, I had hoped Australian access might be comparable. "
1218,New York City vital records collections,"I had the good fortune to start my online genealogical searching on people who lived in Chicago, and then moved to California. Both Ancestry.com and Family Search web sites provide a number of collections of BMD records from the late 19th to the mid-20th centuries, making it possible to find information on people's children, spouses and parents.  Recently, I've had to do some searching for similar records for people who lived in New York City, and I have been surprised by the lack of such collections. Yes, I can find marriages (1894-1937) through stevemorse.org but births are only available in the (1880-1909) range, and parents' names are not indexed.   For deaths, the Illinois death index (1916-1947) may list parents and spouses names, occupations, the cemetery where the person was buried, etc. Nothing similar seems to exist for New York.   The odd thing is that collections do exist, but there aren't very many records in them. The New York deaths and burials 1795-1952 collection, for example, only has 682,387 records in it.  What are the reasons for these differences? "
1219,Finding 20th Century vital records in Germany?,"Every person I look for with few exceptions I find no records for. For example:  First: Heinz Last:  Zaun Birth: Germany Date:  1928 Death: Germany Date:  1957   I know this to be true, his son is alive and has given me the dates and information. Yet searching for brith/death certificates or any records of his life come up empty for me. What am I doing wrong with my searches?  I kinda feel if I can't find records for a more recent person in my tree how am I ever going to find someone further back.  familysearch.org  ancestry.com - The tree it finds is mine.    I do have a specific location in Germany - Marburg. But I get no better results with the added detail. I know, from talking to family, his parents - both birth and death dates, full names, and I have pictures. Still I can't find any vital records on them either.  It just seems odd, I can find other Zauns that may or may not be related to me but nothing on the family members I know exists back to my great and great-great relatives on my fathers side. On my mothers side the family gets HUGE quickly and still, once outside of the US, I can find nothing, and in the US I can find very little. I wan't expecting this to be easy-peasy but I was expecting the internet to be somewhat helpful - it's just discouraging. "
1220,How to make Gramps show more than 5 generations in the pedigree view,"I just installed Gramps the other day and am rather new to it. When I go to Pedigree view, it only shows me five generations at a time. How do I change this (as in make it show more)? Or is it not possible? "
1221,Recording name for infant who died unnamed?,"Going back in my genealogy, I find children who died in infancy. Some were given names, some weren't. How should I record those with no given names? Often there were multiple unnamed children in a single family. I usually know the gender of the child, but even then there are cases with two unnamed males or such.    How should I record this to make it clear at first glance (1) this child had no given name, and (2) this is not the same as the other unnamed child (if there is one in that family)?  Is there a standard convention?  "
1222,Tracing Japanese ancestor who immigrated to Hawaii?,"I am a 1/4 Japanese. My mom is half and my Grandmother full. My Great-grandmother was full Japanese and the one that moved from Japan to Hawaii. That is where she had my Grandmother.   So, I am 3rd generation in America. Over these years my family has lost or not shared for whatever reason the history of my family. Since, high school I have been really into learning anything about my heritage but I have only a hand-full of information.  I know that my Great-grandmother after leaving Japan converted to Catholicism. I don't know the exact time that she moved to America but I think it was around WW2 so I can understand her hiding who she was. She stopped speaking Japanese and never taught my Grandmother. I know my Great-grandmother by the name of ""Grandma Luta"". Luta was her second married name? I'm not super sure. I have also been told that she was married once and it was maybe (And even my family couldn't say this for sure either..) Kunimori? I have tried looking up that name ANYWHERE and nothing comes up.   My family is pretty sure that she had brothers or sisters back in Japan, plus you know, parents of course..But no names unfortunately.   When my Great-grandmother passed away..my Great-uncle threw out a lot of things as well... We're pretty sure lots of family pictures and letters are now destroyed. Not to mention my Great-grandmother seemed to leave most of her family heirlooms to her friends... not family.. so even more history gone.   Anyways, I guess what I am trying to know are there agencies in Hawaii and Japan that I could look into to find my family in Japan? Even being 3 generations away from them, I wonder about them. I feel really empty not knowing this part of me. And I would love to be able to talk to my own kids one day about Japanese heritage.  "
1223,"Proving parents of Thomas Morgan of Tre-bryn, Pencoed, Coychurch, Glamorgan, Wales about 1808 were Thomas and Ann?","The family bible of my 2nd great grandparents Thomas Chichester Browning and Ann nee Morgan states that Ann was born on 15 Apr 1839 in the parish of Coychurch, Glamorgan, Wales, and that she was the daughter of Thomas Morgan of Tre-bryn.   Ann's parents, Thomas Morgan and Margaret nee Morgan, appear in five censuses and for the first four of these they have between one and six of their eleven children (listed below) living with them.    Childrens' Baptisms/Births   Thomas (1831 – 1895) was born on 25 Dec 1831 at Pencoed and baptised on 29 Jan 1832 at Tabernacle and Bethel Independent, Bridgend and Coychurch Higher, as the son of Thomas Morgan (Labourer) and Margaret (formerly Morgan) who were living at Penprisk Margaret (1834 – 1850) was born on 8 Jan 1834 and baptised on 11 Feb 1834 at Tabernacle and Bethel Independent, Bridgend and Coychurch Higher, as the daughter of  Thomas Morgans (Farmer) and Margaret (formerly Morgans), who were living at Hendin (= Hendre?) William (1837 – 1855) was born on 14 Jan 1837 in the Middle Hamlet of The Parish of Coychurch and baptised on 22 Feb 1837 at Bethel Chapel (Independent), Bridgend, as the son of Thomas Morgan (Labourer) and Margaret (formerly Morgan) who were living at Ffos-yr-efail Ann (1839 – 1897) was born on 15 Apr 1839 in the Parish of Coychurch according to the Browning Family Bible and a birth which appear to be hers was registered at Bridgend in Q2 1839 Catherine (""Kate""; 1843 – ?) from census records appears to have been born about 1843 and there are four candidate registrations for her at Bridgend from Q4 1842 to Q2 1843. Martha (1845 – ?) from census records appears to have been born about 1845 and there are two candidate registrations for her at Bridgend in Q4 1844 and Q2 1846 John (1847 – ?) from census records appears to have been born about 1847 and there is a registration likely to be his at Bridgend in Q1 1847 (making the Q2 1846 registration for Martha less likely than the one in Q4 1844) Elizabeth (1848 – 1919) and Sarah (1848 – 1849) were presumably twins, both baptised on 8 Mar 1848 at Coychurch as the daughters of Thomas (labourer) and Margaret, living at Taibryn [sic] James (1850 – 1913) was baptised on 9 Apr 1850 at Coychurch as the son of Thomas (labourer) and Margaret, living at Trebryn  Edwin (1854 – 1907)  was baptised on 28 Jun 1854 at Coychurch as the son of Thomas (labourer) and Margaret, living at Trebryn    Every time one of the children appears in those census records their age matches what would be expected from this combination of records, with the last four confirming their parents' names and residence at Tre-bryn.  Consequently, I am very confident that this Thomas Morgan (and his wife Margaret nee Morgan) were my 3rd great grandparents.  However, it is not so easy to identify Thomas' parents, my 4th great grandparents.  Census Summary  His age and birth location were listed in five censuses:  Census Age Inferred year of birth Location of Birth  Occupation        Residence 1841   33       1802-1803         Glamorgan          Ag.

1226,Reading words on old document relating to share of Will?,"I was just given this old document by my grandmother. It is a document relating to a share of a Will in which her grandmother was mentioned (Emily Pynn nee Hughes). There are a few words I cannot make out which I have highlighted in Bold. I've had to cut it down to 2MB in size to be able to upload it. I have a much higher resolution scan if needed which I can send upon request.  I should also mention that the name Hunstad is mentioned on another document relating to a different will. Although that is a transcription so it could well be Hanstad.  What is the full transcription of this document?    My Transcription is as follows:   Mary Ann Hughes (or Wright) a daughter of William Wright deceased was entitled under the will of James Wright late of Copthorne Worth who died on the 27th of October 1889 to a share of residue amounting to seventeen pounds and four pence – The said Mary Ann Hughes (or Wright) died intestate on the 17th of May 1890 having no property except the said share and an inscorance of Two pounds and Sixteen shillings which insurance money has been devoted towards funeral and incidental expenses leaving Two Pounds of funeral expenses but no debts owing – It has been since her death ascertained that the said Mary Ann Hughes or Wright was as is believed never married so that her mother Eliza Wright and her brothers and sisters: Sarah Jane Hunstad, Ann Hollands, John Wright, Stephen Wright and Elizabeth Atkins would each be beneficially entitled to one sixth part of such share subject to the said Two pounds remaining due for funeral and to the expenses of administration if any – Such six persons entitled have requested and authorised the trustees and executors of the said James Wright to pay to and equally between the three children of the said Mary Ann Hughes or Wright and who until recently have been supposed to be her legitimate children namely: Emily Pynn, Frederick and Alfred (and the ??? of which Alfred born September 23 1873 although under age to be a good discharge) for their own subjective use the said share in residue less such Two pounds and also for any expenses incidental to such share –  August 6:1890. Received £7:0:2 namely my full share £5:0:2 and £2 for balance of funeral (Emily Pynn)  August 6:1890 Received £5:01 my full share (x Frederick Hughes)  August 6:1890 Received £5:01 my full share (Alfred Hughes) "
1227,Is Saisy a known 19th century Irish/English nickname for Sarah?,"In the 1873 diary of my 3rd great grandfather Thomas Hitchcox (1797-1874), written at Fullarton, South Australia, he writes about his son William (1821-1902) and another person who I suspect to be William's wife Sarah Ida Eustace Lithgow, who according to their 31 Oct 1854 marriage notice, was the ""only daughter of the late D. Lithgow, Esq, M. D., Collon, County of Louth, Ireland.""    However, he has not written Sarah, and instead appears to have written Saisy, but not clearly.  Some examples of that writing follow:    The last line above from Sunday 26 Jan 1873 starts ""Wm &amp; Saisy(?)""    The middle line above from Sunday 2 Mar 1873 starts ""Wm &amp; Saisy(?)""    The last line above from Sunday 20 Apr 1873 starts ""Wm &amp; Saisy(?)""    The last line above from Sunday 1 Jun 1873 starts ""Wm &amp; Saisy(?)""    The last line above from Sunday 21 Dec 1873 after 10 days saying that he had been very ill/unwell, and in a shaky hand appears to start ""Wm &amp; Sasie(?)""  Is Saisy a known 19th century nickname for Sarah in Ireland and/or England?  Thomas and William had emigrated from Wheaton Aston, Staffordshire, England to South Australia in 1854 and 1851 respectively.  William and Sarah had only two children (both daughters):   Josephine Elizabeth born 4 Mar 1857 at Glenelg, South Australia   This is how he writes her name on 13 Apr 1873, as ""Josey"":     Ida Eustace born 10 Aug 1860 at Glenelg, South Australia   This is how he writes her name on 13 Mar 1873, as ""Ida"":    so Thomas does not appear to be referring to one of them.

1228,Why are 99% of my Ashkenazi DNA matches not in the Middle East or Central Asia?,"I took DNA tests through four major services: familytreedna, 23andMe, ancestry, and NatGeo/Helix. I am identified no less than 85% Ashkenazi. I also ran my results through dnaland, gedmatch, and wegene. All identified more Euro-dna than the big-four.   My question is this. I received well over a thousand matches. If my K1a1b1a and GL1324 supposedly originated in the Near East as recently as a thousand years ago, how come 99% of my matches are in Europe, USA, and Australia? Shouldnt the frequency of matches be greater from the Middle East and Caucasious/Central Asia?  "
1229,"What Exactly are the ""Jewish Records"" on Ancestry.com?","Ancestry.com has a category under the title Jewish Records, but I'm interested as to how it works exactly. Does anyone who is known to have been Jewish show up in the records, or is there something I'm missing? Maybe it has to do with other users on the site assigning a person the status as a Jew.   What exactly makes a record ""Jewish,"" anyway? For instance, census records show up in the Jewish Record Collection, but why do they, when the U.S Federal Census does not include one's religious alignment? "
1230,Locating given surname listed in Virginia Tax Records from late 18th and early 19th century?,"I'm browsing the Binns Virginia Personal and Land tax records from 1780s, 1790s, and 1800s to try and locate more sources in my research.  In so doing, Binns has some indexing, but it appears to be incomplete, so I've been browsing the records to find ancestors.  For example, looking at Botetourt County, Virginia Personal Property Tax Lists 1783 - 1810, I found William Samples in the index for his 1799 entry listed as 1799A on page 15, but browsing the non-free area, I find that same record under page 9.  It appears to subscription area gives two pages at a time and the images are not identical.  What determines whether an item is in the index?  Is it just random as they build the index, as to whether an entry is listed?  Why is the same page available in two different images?  Did the collector go around the county in alphabetical order?  What about the listing order of names in the record?  It seems to be ordered by last name, did the tax collector follow any logic to their order?  In the 1795B entry, I see William Samples again on May 9, 1795.  Why was he with all the other last names beginning with 'S' but in the middle after names beginning 'Sh' on April 4th?  Also, on prior page 8, the 'S's begin on March 25th after the 'R's section that ends with March 24th, but the 'S' begins with James Shackey.  It seems all the 'Sh' names are together on dates near each other.  What are the patterns of entry in the tax books and how can this be used to help search for a given surname and not miss them by error.  Was a person taxed every year, so if you don't find them, you should keep looking? "
1231,How to Decipher months in Virginia tax records with Information on the Collection Methodology?,"I'm browsing the Binns Virginia Personal and Land tax records from 1780s, 1790s, and 1800s and often the month is very hard to read.  For example, I think William Samples is July 12, 1799, but very hard to be sure.  Looking at prior dates around this, it appears prior listing is May and June is skipped.    I try and use nearby legible months to decipher a month that is not clear.  Are entries always in chronological order, for example, do months get skipped?  What was the method actually used to collect the taxes, why was everyone spread out on different days of the year?  Is the date you paid just random as they got to you?  Did the collector go around the county in alphabetical order?  In summary: How can I use the method and process of tax collection to inform me in reading months in the tax records that are difficult to read? "
1232,Finding paternal grandfather?,"My paternal grandfather's name was not permitted to be on the birth register of my father. How does one find  Unknown Unknown? through time and place? Thru DNA tests? through a GEDmatch?  I think I've tried them all.    My autosomal DNA TEST shows a definite Jewish (Ashkenazi) dna from Lithuania now called Belarus. This person was very likely in Karlsruhe or Frankfurt in March 1907. My grandmother Anna's family seems not to have been rich enough to travel long distances as a general rule. An inference I made after meeting the three Bermans two years ago is that my and my son's keen interests in the arts comes from that Jewish family line.  Other than that I don't know anything about him.   I am female and my father had no living male relatives except for his father. I had two sons and both had the same test taken.   As for a GEDmatch, I'm at a point where I've run it and received results. Now I must write people short letters to get further information. "
1233,Duplicate Identities and Persons and Incorrect Records,"How do I discover the cause of and fix duplicate records on Ancestry, and on FamilySearch?   How do I find the true dates and places of life events, the true names of people, and their true relation to me when incorrect information is submitted for them or they have records stating contradicting information or are missing information?   How can I get these people's records changed once I do discover the truth?   For example, my paternal great-grandmother, Golden Blanche Sorenson (married name is Steele and she was born on August 1894 in Mammoth, Juab, Utah and deceased since May 1935), has ""Missing Standardized Death Date"" and ""Missing Standardized Death Place"", and I researched her birthdate and she has:   some on Ancestry that has August 2nd and August 4th, and some other records which say August 3rd. Her FamilySearch profile says August 2nd and her Ancestry profile says August 4th while providing multiple records with more than one birth date.      "
1234,Percentages of nucleotides in raw DNA,"I just had Excel compute the percentage of each nucleotide appearing as the first letter in each position in a raw DNA file.  Then I had it compute the percentage of each nucleotide in the second position.  I got the following percentages (in positions with calls):  1st position  A 31.05   T 16.21    C 31.11    G 21.64  2nd position  A 16.30  T 31.02  C 21.78  G  30.89  The first thing that stands out to me is that this looks decidedly non-random.  The second is that the A and T percentages in the first spot are very close to the T and A percentages in the second spot, and similarly with the C and G.  So while the data in each position seems non-random, the percentage of A, T, C, and G looks much closer to random when all of the letters are grouped together, regardless of position.  (I haven't yet tried a chi-squared test to see if they are believably random).  Question 1:  does everybody observe this?  Is it special to this kit?  Question 2:  How can there be such a tight relationship between what's happening in each position?    Some background for Question 2:  It seems that sequencing machines have no ability to determine at each position which letter came from which chromosome -- i.e., the first position at consecutive positions won't necessarily correspond to nucleotides attached to the same chromosome -- i.e. the letters in the first position can be jumping back and forth between chromosomes.  Or at least, so I thought comparing the data files of a brother and sister.  In areas where there was half-match, the matching letter would jump back and forth between the first and second position.  But if that is the case, I'd expect to find equal percentages of A's occuring in first position as in the second, equal percentages of T's, etc. "

The line for him ends with this notation:    The last payment number is shown in March 1848, which leads me to interpret the handwritten notation as ""25 June 48"", followed by something illegible to me.

As I’ve learned, this is on the low side for half siblings and the very high side for first cousins. Is there a way I can determine which is correct given that the two potential fathers are deceased? Based on the family story, it is more likely that we are half siblings but the low number leaves lingering thoughts that my uncle could have been the father. I understand that it would be rare that we are first cousins with that number but isn’t it also rare to have such a low number for a half sibling? "
1237,What is the meaning of Xed out entries in Massachusetts vital records?,"For the neophyte (me), I'd like to understand the significance of an entry in a marriage register that appears to have been X'ed out.  In the following the fields for date of marriage, ages, and number of marriages is X'ed out. What is the significance of that?

1239,Historical Business Documents (1905-1930) Colorado,"My family owned a book store in Aspen from around 1905 to around 1930, and I'm trying to find whatever documentation I can on it.  The Aspen Historical Society has a few city directories and a lot of phone books, which I have analyzed, but I'm wondering if any of the legal documents for the business might still be available - state tax filings, federal tax filings, letters of incorporation, that sort of thing.  I have no idea how to even start looking for something like that.  Does a business, when it is shutting down, have to file some kind of paperwork with any of the various governmental agencies?  Something to say ""don't get confused when I don't send you any taxes next year""? "
1240,Are birth records of US adoptees really sealed?,"My family history used to be cut and dry...My Mom was adopted to a good home. Taken in by the dentist of her biological mother, an 18 yr old immigrant from Ireland who was impregnated by her employer——a much older prominent Jewish man from Hyde Park in Chicago. As I’ve become older, I feel this story isn’t true. My Mother was born at Cook County Hospital in Chicago, IL. She says her birth records are sealed in a way I’ve been unable to imagine how and why; the legalities; how do you get through life without a birth certificate? is this possible? Is it impossible to ever discover the truth? "
1241,Reconstructing autosomal genomes of Mayflower passengers,"I imagine no group of 100 people has been as genealogically documented as the Mayflower passengers.  And with an estimated 35,000,000 descendants living today, the number of descendants genetic tests should be large and growing.  But a typical descendant who is lucky enough to share some DNA with her Mayflower ancestor will only share a short segment.  This segment will typically get lost during genetic genealogy research, crowded out by larger segments or segments with MRCAs in a more recent time-frame.  So I wonder, is it now feasible or will it be soon to track down several thousand descendants of a given Mayflower passenger who are willing to take DNA tests?  Some mining of such a large data set may accomplish what individuals cannot, being unable to see the forest for the trees.  If analysis revealed a short piece of chromosome where almost all of several thousand kits were unique, but, say, 25 kits all matched, that may be more convincing evidence that the segment is IBD from that ancestor.  And at least in my own research, beginning with known genealogical connections and searching for DNA matches has been much more fruitful than trying the reverse.  There would be several issues here:  1) How many DNA tests exist for confirmed descendants of a given Mayflower passenger?  How many of these people would be willing to contribute to such a project?  (I presume most people who have been confirmed with membership in the Mayflower Society and who have kits are already primed to contribute.)  2) How many kits do you need for an ancestor 13 or more generations back to have a hope of identifying even a single short segment through data mining?  I'm not thinking we could reconstruct close to the whole genome for any passenger, but IMO finding even a single 5cM segment through such a process would be marvelous.  If we could construct significant proportions of genomes, then perhaps we'd see some surprises, like unknown familial connections between different passengers.  So I guess my questions are:  is such a project feasible?  Is there interest?  Is there one in the works?  (I'm also interested to know how many y-chromosomes have been identified for the male passengers and how many mitochondrial sequences are known for the females ones.) "
1242,Seeking image from New York 1860 Federal Census Index?,"In Interpreting relationships to head of household in 1855 New York State Census? I mentioned that:     Robert [Sellars] is another son who [in 1855] was living in the same Albany ward   as Hugh (senior) that I am still looking for in the 1860 census when I   think he may have been in New York City   I think that I may have found him in a record from:     Ancestry.com. New York, Compiled Census and Census Substitutes Index,   1790-1890 [database on-line].

1243,Segments with no matches,"I am beginning the process of forming triangulation groups, and I wonder:  what do people do with segments on which there are no matches?  I found such a segment already just on the first chromosome I have examined.  There is a region with no matches over the threshold on any of FTDNA, MyHeritage, or GEDmatch.    I can think of a couple of reasons: * going back many, many generations and following this segment through my ancestors, it just so happened by chance that all other descendants had this segment excised at some point through recombination (or at least, all descendants that tested DNA at these places) * a mutation happened recently, close enough to another mutation to cause otherwise matching segments to be flagged as non-matches.  Is one of these the more likely explanation?    Should I view short matching segments in such a region as more reliable, i.e., more likely to be IBD, say because it is a personal ""anti-pileup region""? "
1244,When triangulation is not transitive,"I'm focusing on triangulation groups and so looking at matching segments that overlap each other.  I'm frequently finding the situation where, at a single website, match A's segment is shown as triangulating with match B's segment, and match B's segment is shown as triangulating with match C's segment, but match A is not shown as triangulating with person C.  Sometimes, the explanation is that the overlap between the segments inherited by A and C is too small, below the threshold established by the company to flag people as matches.  But I'm frequently finding intransitivity even when this is not the case. For instance, I just found on MyHeritage the situation:  Person A and Person B have exactly the same start and end position for their segments that match my kit, and these segments are shown as triangulating.  Person C has a segment contained within the segment of A and B, and her segment is shown as triangulating with A's but not with B's. In the situation I'm looking at now the longer segments are 14cM and the shorter one contained within them is 12cM.  I can only guess that person A and B actually had a few differences that were ignored, person B and person C also had a few differences that were ignored, but person A and person C had the union of these differences and put together there were too many for them to be called a match.  Is that what I should assume is happening here?  Can I put these people all in the same triangulation group, or should I be hesitant?   "
1245,Understanding high match on autosomal and X dna?,I have an autosomal match of 1125 centimorgans with largest cm of 128 and a X dna match of 108 with largest cm of 67. 1 8 generations apart.   The lady I match to was adopted and knows nothing of her biological family.   I know we match on my fathers side because my mother and her share no dna.   My father died when I was 8 years old and his parents before I was born. I  know very little about my fathers side of the family.   I was hoping you could help me understand how her and I might be related. The amount of centimorgans we have in common suggest we are first cousins or she is my half aunt. She was born 12 years before my father if that matters. Also she shows dna matches with distant relatives on both my paternal grandparents side.   What are the possibilities for our relationship?   Also when you have a x dna match does that mean my paternal grandmother is a direct match to her or could it also be from a sister of my paternal grandmother? 
1246,What happened to Gustav Adolf Neumann - part II?,"In light of former questions asked on Genealogy Stackexchange like What happened to Gustav Adolf Neumann, 1859 immigrant to the US? and Finding clues for a missing immigrant in the 1870 Census?, I continue to struggle with finding out the whereabouts of one of my ancestors, Gustav Adolf (Adolph) Neumann (probably written sometimes as Naumann or Newman in the USA).  The problem I have is that, as US immigration records in the 1860s or so seem to care little about the full name of the applicants and their birth date and places back in the country of origin, I do not know to proved or falsify that the records below are from ""my"" Gustav Adolf Neumann or from somebody else.  I cannot find a petition or another document of the naturalisation process (apart of the two below) which seems complete in the sense that birth date and place are recorded next to his name and age. How can I find it?  These are the information I have gathered and which are proven by records:   Born on 27.10.1824 in Leipzig, Saxony, Germany Worked as a copyist in Leipzig He left for the United States on 30.10.1858 from Bremen, Germany to New York in a ship called “Louisiana” (from an inherited family tree) He reached New York on 17.01.1859, indicated that he would be farmer (which I think is a lie) and that he would like to stay in the state of New York (he was then 34 years old), see ship manifest below (from the New York Passenger Lists, 1820-1891 and CastleGarden)     I thought that he might have liked to become US citizen at some point in time and learnt that - in case so - the Naturalization Law of 1803 must have been applied on him. This law would require him to stay at least 5 years in the country (until 1864) and that he the earliest applies three years in advance (around 1861) before he would be eligible for getting the citizenship (the fastest in 1864).  In addition, I learnt that the step to be naturalised would be loosely three-fold: first you give a Declaration of Intention, then an Oath and then you would present yourself to a judge, before eventually getting the US citizenship.  So I searched for it, but the US records seem to lag precision (in that time).  For example, I found a passport application from August 26, 1861 within the United States Passport Applications, 1795-1925 Collection, however, I do not know whether it is ""my"" Gustav as I do not know the place of birth of the person. His age would fit and the place, New York, where he intended to stay, but I struggle to fit this application in.   This seems to be the Declaration of Intention.    Then for August 1861 I found an apparent oath given by a Gustav Neumann within the United States Passport Applications, 1795-1925 collection, which I believe could be the Oath he would need to give in a second step. Again, time and space do fit.    However, now the Oath says that he would have been naturalised already and would be ""of California"".   "
1247,GEDCOM NOTE_RECORD vs. embedded note,"I'll start off with a little GEDCOM background information before firing off my questions.  The GEDCOM 5.5.1 specification distinguishes record structures (which have xref-ids) from substructures which are contained in records.  For notes, there is a NOTE_RECORD and a NOTE_STRUCTURE. The NOTE_STRUCTURE substructure is embedded by many other records and substructures. The NOTE_STRUCTURE is essentially a wrapper to either an embedded note or a reference to a NOTE_RECORD via its xref-id.    My questions are from the perspective of a GEDCOM writer:  When should a note be embedded and when should it be a stand-alone record? Are there any applications that have an explicit interface to generate NOTE_RECORDs?  I am trying to simplify my GEDCOM writer while not limiting its future expansion. I can visualize an application that offers the user an opportunity to enter free-form notes (as NOTE_RECORDs) that could later be referenced in other contexts. A NOTE_RECORD also offers the opportunity to enter a source citation, user reference, and change date.  It seems to be more common that notes are entered in the context of some other record type, and in that case it is easier to implement them as embedded. "
1248,Seeking birth or adoption record for adopted ancestor in 1860s USA?,"My great-great-grandmother Leona was born in the early 1860s. She was adopted as a young child (we think less than five years old) when her mother died; her father was apparently unfit in some fashion, because she and at least one sibling were adopted. The only story my uncle ever heard was that once her father tried to visit, and she ran and hid under the bed until he left -- she always considered her adoptive parents to be her family and never showed any interest in discussing the adoption, even though my uncle (an avid family historian) had often tried to ask.  We think we know that her former last name was Booth, because she was invited to the funeral of her brother (James Booth). Unfortunately, we're not entirely sure about even that, because maybe James was adopted by the Booths rather than keeping his birth name.  We've researched town and county records (this was in or around Corning, Steuben County, New York) and haven't found a birth record for any Leona of any last name. Registering births wasn't required until a few years after she was born, though.  What are some other resources that I could try looking into that might have some record of this adoption?   Facilitators for Adoption suggested such things as local churches, which I'm starting to build a contact list for.  Are there other community organizations in the US in general, or New York State in particular, that might have been involved in adoptions at the time? "
1249,What is the best practice for posting certificates online?,"I have been slowly acquiring birth, marriage and death certificates. Is there a best practice or accepted procedure for posting the United States certificates online, including to Geanealogy.se (to add necessary information to a question)? I would not post a certificate for any living person - however, how about a certificate for a deceased person whose children are still living?  For instance, the marriage certificate might include living witnesses and the death certificate might include a living person. "
1250,Is there a society for the descendants of Mayflower passenger William Bradford?,"Wiliam Bradford (March 19, 1590 – May 9, 1657) came over on the Mayflower, was governor,  and was one of the original clebrebrants of Thanksgiving.  Descendants are eligible for joining the Mayflower Society. Is there a genealogical society for his descendants? I searched on the internet and found some references  to the Society of Governor William Bradford Descendants at [website]but the website doesn't appear to be working. Is any one a member? Can they direct me to how to contact the society. "
1251,Conflict between Kent Online Parish Records and FamilySearch.org database - which to believe?,"I have an ancestor, William Vollins or Vallins, who I believe was the son of Richard Vollins and Mary (Bowler), b 1777 in St Mary Cray, Kent (near Orpington). There are many other Vollins/Vallins family members in the Orpington area. He later married Sarah Crump in Wilmington, Kent (FamilySearch.org reference).  Here is the FamilySearch.org reference for his christening.  However, I have also found an index on the web site of the Kent Online Parish Clerk which suggests that he was rather the son of William and Mary Vollins.  The birth dates and christening dates are identical, but the parents' names differ. It has to be the same person being born, but perhaps the parents' names were mistranscribed. But for which record?  Does anyone have experience with the Kent OPC indices to know if it is likely to be more reliable or less reliable than FamilySearch.org? "
1252,What word appears after after the birthdate of this Scottish record?,"I hope this is not something obvious... I have tried to figure out what the word following the birthdate here is: ""Patrick Dunlop shepherd in Brukside and Jean Wood his spouse had a son baptized named John (was born the 1st ???), witnesses to the baptism Mr. John Hay Esq. younger of Hopes and Joseph Anderson.""  The word looks like 'jnstand' to me, which I can't make head nor tails of.  The record above this one also has a word after the birthdate that I can't figure out. The one above that looks like 'September past'. What is this pattern and what are they saying?   "
1253,"What does the occupation ""Works in Woods"" mean?","In an 1880 US Census entry, the occupation of Daniel Card is listed as ""Works in Woods."" What does that mean?  Where I grew up, the word ""woods"" was a synonym for forest so I immediately thought ""Works in the Forest"". If that's true, what kind of work was he likely doing in the forest? Lumbering? I also see how ""Works in Woods"" could be another way to say ""Carpenter"".  The census entry is from Pennsylvania. You can see on the image that many others who lived near him had the same occupation. "
1254,"How to record ""at sea"" as a location","In my database, locations are ""all"" entered in the form City, County, State, Country (mostly the US).  But I have two I am not sure how to handle.  One relative was born ""at sea"" (between England and the US--you can see it in the ship records).   For this person I just entered ""at sea,"" was there a better way to do that?  The answers to the question What is the correct location for a person born at sea? address recording and storing the result when in a text format.

1255,Would an immigrant to the US pre-1800 be hiding beans? (When were food restrictions first placed on immigrants to the US)?,"I am looking into ""Mitchell Family Beans,"" purplish beans pinto like with brown spots (see below).  These have been passed down a couple generations in a Mitchell family of Idaho (formerly Missouri). I was once told a Mitchell ancestor brought these to the US through Ellis Island, most likely from Ireland, hidden in the lining of their coat. A great story!  But since these Mitchell's were in Kentucky and Virginia before 1800, they did not come through Ellis Island (which saw its first immigrant 1 Jan 1892). So I am wondering about the rest of the story.     Would have been hidden?  When were food restrictions first placed on immigrants to the US?   Obviously the lining of the coat part could be true even if the beans were not hidden.  For example, they could accidentally have been there from having beans in a pocket some time earlier.  But would an immigrant pre-1800 be hiding beans?   "
1256,What are the benefits of starting a genealogy blog?,"It seems that there are a million genealogy blogs (waaaaaay too many to follow). I'm sure that many are begun and then abandoned, but I can't help feeling that I'm missing something... Is there a natural progression towards eventually blogging about your genealogy experiences and research? Is it a networking thing? Why do so many people start blogging about their research or the industry? Here are some reasons that I can think of:   You have a product or service to sell.   You want relatives to find you/your research and make contact.   You want to record your thoughts and research.   You want to become popular enough to make money from your blog and/or receive free stuff.   Can someone please describe the benefits of starting a genealogy blog? I feel that I already have enough commitments in my life and don't want to embark upon something that I don't need. ...but I feel that maybe I'm not aware of all the positives and may be missing out on something positive.

1257,Can anyone find the definition of Parts on FamilySearch Indexing Projects?,"FamilySearch publishes ""Project Completion Percentages"" on the page ""FamilySearch Indexing Updates"". (That may or may not be the only or best place). On that page we find, for instance, that ""US (Community Project), New York, New York—Passenger Lists, 1942–1957 [Part F]"" is 11.33% complete (arbitrated?) at time of writing. This percentage is however, meaningless unless we know how many Parts there are, and / or what the size of each Part is and the complete Project is.   I seem to have been making this point in various places for literally years. Am I missing something? Is there a definition of the Part sizes somewhere? If so, where, please? "
1258,What steps should I take to retrieve lost sources?,"I've lost my sources for an individual. Either I never wrote it down or it's been lost by my software (probably the former).   I realized this when I came back to this individual the other day and saw the birth recorded as in Yugoslavia about 1864. For those who know their history, this is a problem. Yugoslavia wasn't formed until post-WWI (1918). My course of action was to review the original source (probably a birth or immigration record). Unfortunately, my sources were not listed and I could not find them. A preliminary search did not uncover anything.  With a situation like this, what should I do?   Obviously, the best case scenario is to be more careful about recording sources in the first place, but what steps should I take to retrieve my source(s) when something like this does happen? "
1259,Finding New York City/State records relating to Sellars family (British subjects) births/deaths mid 19th century?,"On advice of @efgen I split this question into two - one for New York and one for Panama, but left the same detail for both thinking the fact that Robert Sellars was in both geographic areas might help solve the ""mystery"".  I now know considerably more than I did when first posing this question so will try to revise it without changing its original nature  Please only provide Answer(s) for New York here.  My 3rd great grandfather Robert Sellars was born 15 Oct 1830 in Dundonald, Ayrshire, Scotland, and with his wife Margaret Clacher, had three sons born abroad:   Robert John Steven in Albany, New York, USA on 3 Jan 1854 William in New York City, USA in about 1857 - record has now been found John in Panama, South America in about 1863   He also had two other children born in Scotland:   Hugh in Glasgow about 1850 Margaret Elizabeth in Glasgow on 28 Jul 1865   There is also a tantalizing photograph of what is believed to be Robert John Steven ""with his sister Margaret"" at ages of about 5 and 3 suggesting that another daughter may have been born about 1856, perhaps in Albany or New York City.  There are various Census appearances (1861, 1871, 1881) by his children (except for the Margaret who may have been born in about 1856) and wife, Margaret (nee Clacher) living back in Scotland, there is nothing to indicate that Robert ever returned.  I have found the family in the 1855 New York State Census at Albany where Robert Sellars (24), a Ship Carpenter is living with wife Margaret Clacker (25) and sons Hugh (5) and Robert John Stephen Sellars (1).  Robert is recorded as having been living there for one year while it appears that his family joined him more recently.  I know that Margaret and Hugh arrived in New York on 10 May 1854 aboard the ""Mary Morris"".  I have not been able to locate any of the family in any subsequent US Census but Robert's father Hugh Sellars, also a Ship Carpenter, aged 52, is also in the 1855 New York State Census at Albany living with what I resume to be his second wife Mary, aged 50, born in England.  Robert's father Hugh appears to live at Albany through to at least 1872 because he is recorded as having a Variety Store and house at 311 Washington Avenue in eight Albany Directories (and at 287 Washington Avenue in two before that).  He is also in Albany for the 1860 Federal Census but I have not seen an image of that to learn more than basic details.  Of Robert himself the only other things I know are that in the 1861 Census his wife Margaret is recorded as being a Ship Carpenter's Wife (not widow), and on the 1865 Birth Certificate (which I have not seen) of his daughter Margaret Elizabeth I believe it records his occupation as being ""Railway Company, Ship Building Manager, Panama, Central America"".  My overall question is where to find New York City and Albany birth and death records for the mid-late 1850s and possibly early 1860s?  I wish to use them to verify the date and location of these events:   Birth of Robert John Steven (or Stephen?) Sellars on 3 Jan 1854 in Albany Possible birth of Margaret Sellars in about 1856 in Albany or New York City Birth of William Sellars in about 1857 in New York City Possible death of Margaret Sellars aged about 5 or less before 1861 most likely in New York City Death of Hugh Sellars aged about 68 or more after 1872 in Albany Death of Mary Sellars aged anywhere over about 50 after about 1855 in Albany - record has now been found     I recently located an 1865 New York State Census record, and I think there are some other updates that I can and should make to this question, but for now ...     Hugh Sellars 60, Ship Carpenter, born in Scotland, living at Albany   City, Ward 6, Albany, New York, USA with his wife Mary Sellars 60   (born in England) and two others: William H Hall, aged 8, recorded as   Hugh's son (?) and Caroline R Foster, aged 7, a Boarder. Hugh was   recorded as having been naturalized which suggests to me that he not   only declared his intent but completed the process.  "
1260,Finding 1863 birth of John Sellars and death of his father Robert (British subjects) around 1870 in Panama/Colombia?,"This question is related to Finding New York City/State records relating to Sellars family (British subjects) births/deaths mid 19th century?.  I have a Scottish ancestor, Robert Sellars born 1830, who with wife Margaret Clacher, had a fourth son John born in New Grenada (now country of Colombia), Panama, South America in about 1863.  More details on John:  1871 Scottish Census  Age: 8 Residence: Glasgow Maxwell, Lanarkshire, Scotland Name: John Sellars  Age: 8  Estimated Birth Year: abt 1863  Relationship: Nephew  Gender: Male  Where born: South America Br S, Panama   1881 Scottish Census  Age: 18 Residence: Glasgow Kinning Park, Lanarkshire, Scotland Name: John Sellars  Age: 18  Estimated Birth Year: abt 1863  Relationship: Nephew-in-law  Gender: Male  Where born: Panann, State of New Grenada   I had overlooked the ""State of Grenada"" bit and from Wikipedia have just learned that ""Nueva Granada later became the Republic of Colombia"".  I have no direct record of Robert after the 1855 New York State Census (see Finding New York City/State records relating to Sellars family (British subjects) births/deaths mid 19th century?).  However the children he later fathered, and his wife's Death Certificate from 5 Nov 1867 in Tradeston, Glasgow (in a relative's hands) apparently has her husband's job as ""Railway Company Ship Building Manager"". indicate that he was probably still alive in 1867.  I am keen to learn where to find Colombia/Panama birth and death records from the late 1850s and 1860s in order to verify the:   Birth of John there in about 1863 The probable death of Robert there at age about 37 or older, in about 1867 or later.     It is interesting to read about this Civil War ship at FamilySearch:     Warren. Class: Sailing ship; wood. Sold at auction, January 1, 1863, at Panama, for $3,900. Went out of commission and turned over to   Panama Railway Co., January 2, 1863. Commission for sale was $195.   I think this is an event that Robert as the ""Railway Company Ship Building Manager"" who was in Panama that year would have had to have had some involvement. "
