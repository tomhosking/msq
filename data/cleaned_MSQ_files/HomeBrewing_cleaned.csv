0,Are German Merkur or Herkules hops noble enough to sub in a Pilsener?,"On an impulse last week I picked up some German Merkur and Herkules hops from the LHBS to use as flavoring and aroma hops in a pilsner, because I thought they might be an interesting twist. But now I'm not sure if they will really fit the style, or even the style of a ""light lager"", since they're described as primarily bittering with some dual-use on the hop reference sites I've found for merkur and a conference poster comparing them.   Has anyone had experience using them for their aroma? Or using them at all?   Both have an AA of around 13-14, which is high for flavoring and aroma schedules, but the labels claim they're good for all parts of the schedule for pilsners. I haven't experimented, but have noticed (and also been told) that you can get a fair amount of bitterness from even a 25 or 30 minute boil, despite conventional knowledge. Does it sound like I might get appropriate bitterness if I left out a bittering hop and threw one of them in around 30 minutes, and the other around 5? And more importantly, which one should be used for each step? I could just open them both and choose after smelling them on brew day, if no one has recommendations. "
1,"Brett, Pedio, Lacto. Reuse and kegging",I have 6 gallons of a bretted whit that has been sitting in the basement for 8 months and a Pedio/Lacto/Brett Dubbel that has been working for about 7 months.   If I wanted to reuse these cultures could I just throw wort on top? I know that one method is to use oak chips to preserve the bugs and use the chips/cubes from beer to beer.   I was thinking of racking the finished beer into kegs that I use for other beers. The issue that I see is the chance of cross contamination. The beer that goes into the kegs is gone within a month so is this really an issue? Would one use a separate keg for bugged beers?   Has anyone used the same equip for bugged beers and had issues? Star San and B-Brite seem like a pretty harsh environment for a yeast to live through if the equip was properly sanitized.  
2,What is the best way to flavor beer with Oak?,"Background:  I've purchased some lovely dark roasted oak chips that I plan on soaking in bourbon and using to flavor an Irish Red.  Friends of mine who have seasoned their beer on oak chips claim that you should rack your beer onto it in a secondary and ""rotate"" once every couple weeks to keep the oak exposed to flavor the beer.  I've looked around at a number of sources on the subject, but I want to know what Homebrewing thinks is the best way to do this.  Research:  The options I've found for flavoring are:   Add chips to primary after it has mostly cleared up.  Place chips in a secondary and rack the beer onto them. Boil the wort with the chips. Add Oak tea (boil water or soak in liquor and then add that) to primary or secondary.   With many variations in between.  I'm looking for a good full-bodied oak flavor.  The Question:  What is the best way to add oak (chips) to a beer in order to impart the most flavor?    What say you? "
3,What bourbons work well for flavoring beer?,"Background:  I am a large fan of bourbon flavored beers and have flavored a number of my homebrews with various bourbons with a wide range of results.  Question:  What bourbons/whiskies result in a good flavor in beer?  For anyone starting out with flavoring using bourbon, this is a question that will likely be raised along with:   Is there a difference between soaking oak in bourbon and just adding the bourbon straight into secondary? Adding Bourbon flavor to a beer How much bourbon is the right amount?   And potentially:   What is the best way to flavor beer with Oak?  "
4,Brettanomyces and Bottle Conditioning,"When working with brettanomyces ""Brett"" should I adjust the amount of priming sugar I use?  Does brett have any affect on quantity or quality (fineness of bubbles etc.) of carbonation in the bottle?  I ask as I've never used brettanomyces before and want to avoid bottle bombs as much as possible. "
5,Should I rack lager before pitching yeast?,"Yesterday I brewed my first Lager. I chilled the wort to about 72 degrees and figured i should get it colder before pitching. So i got the wort into a carboy and then got the carboy into to the freezer at 50F and left it there overnight. This morning i was about to pitch the yeast but noticed about 3 inches of sediment (is this cold break?) on the bottom of the carboy.  At this point i did not know what to do, do i pitch the yeast as is or do i rack the wort to another carboy leaving all that material behind?  "
6,"Need help accenting the ""clove"" character of my Hefes","So I enjoy the heck outa making Hefeweizens. Its a great style and very wonderful when fresh. However, my Hefe's never seem to hit that ""clove"" note properly, they always lean much more towards the ""banana"" side of the flavor spectrum.  I suspect this is because I am a single infusion masher. I've never bothered with a protein rest or any kind of steps, I just hit 150-155F and let it sit for an hour. Works great on my other beers, but I think it's making my Hefe's a little one dimensional.  I ferment in a fridge, usually at 64F, so it's not a temp control issue leading to more banana flavor. Furthermore, I like WLP380 Hefe IV yeast, which is supposed to give more balanced clove/banana than the WLP300. As such, I am pointing the finger at my mash schedule.  Does anyone have a mash schedule they use to accent the clove character? And if its not too much, would you mind explaining what volumes of water you use to hit those steps?  Or, if you think there's something else I can try besides a different mash schedule, that would be great too. Thanks! "
7,"Does a malt ""late addition"" affect OG?","I'm following a recipe from a book for an IPA that calls for the following (simplified) steps:   Boil water (3G/11L) Add Light DME (1lb/450g) &amp; return to boil Add hops At 45 mins, add LME (6.6lb/3kg) Add hops, etc &amp; boil another 15 mins   I've put the malt ingredients into both Beer Calculus and BrewMate but the SG/OG I'm getting are way off.  The book says I'm should expect 1.068 yet Beer Calculus is 1.049 &amp; BrewMate is 1.048.  BC has the exact brands of extract, but BM does not, though that does not seem to make a noteworthy difference.  I'm using the brands listed by the recipe (Briess).  The only thing I can see that's different from BM/BC and the recipe is that the calculators don't have any option for a late malt addition for the extract.  Will the late addition cause a higher SG?  Should I add more malt to kick it up?  Or could there be something else at play? "
8,Estery fruit flavors in my vanilla bourbon imperial porter,"I'm still pretty new to home brewing, so I'm sure I made about a hundred mistakes with this beer. I brewed a 1.079 OG imperial porter, and used Safale 05 (only one pack, unfortunately). First of all, I think I under-pitched the yeast, and then I only kept it in primary for seven days. I tasted it during racking, and there were definitely some pretty distinct fruity flavors there that I did not expect or want. The gravity read 1.032, so I assumed I did not have enough yeast for that big of a beer, and the yeast got really stressed out, hence the fruit. I added 1.70 cups of bourbon, an ounce of oak chips, and three cut-up vanilla beans at secondary, as per the recipe that I found. Since the gravity was still so high, I repitched into secondary with a new pack of 05, hoping that would kick-start more fermentation and get the gravity down to 1.017 where it's supposed to be. After four days, there is barely any activity in the airlock, so I don't think it's fermenting. Is there any hope for this beer turning out, or for those fruity flavors to disappear? I'm also concerned about leaving it in secondary with the oak chips and vanilla beans for too long. Could someone please point me in the right direction? "
9,What is a protein rest?,"I am new to all grain brewing and mashing, however I am about to brew a Belgian Witbier (Northern Brewer all grain kit) and I have a question about the mash schedule.  I have only done a single step mash before (with a batch sparge) which is super easy, however this recipe is calling for a multi step mash:   Protein Rest: 122°F for 20 minutes Sacch’ Rest: 152 F for 60 minutes Mashout: 170°F for 10 minutes   With the grain bill as follows:   3.5 lbs. Weyermann Pale Wheat 3.5 lbs. Belgian Pilsner 1 lbs. Flaked Oats   All of the grains came in 1 pre-mixed bag not separately.  What is a protein rest?  What water ratio do I use for this?  How do I get the mash up to 152 after this (mash in a cooler so I can't apply a heat source), just by add boiling water to it?  If so what should I be looking to keep left over for the sparge/mashout?  I usually use a 1.25 gts./lbs. ratio for mash water and try to hit 6.5 gallons in the brew pot pre-boil.  I am assuming the 'Sacch Rest' is same as my regular mash step, and the mashout being the sparge?  Is this not correct? "
10,Kegging and less-than-keg-sized batches,What are the drawbacks (if any) of using a 4-gallon batch with a 5-gallon kegging system? And what if the batch is only two gallons? 
11,How to safely remove mold from corks?,"I have a mead that has been sitting bottled in a cool underground closet for about a year, and the corks appear to have some mold growing on the outside.   Apparently the closet is a bit more moist than it should be.  I was hoping to age this mead for quite a few years, so swilling it is not the preferred method of dealing with this.  What is a safe way to remove the mold from the corks?  Will I need to open and re-cork all of the bottles?    What can I do to prevent this in the future?   Will a wax coating help?  EDIT  I've looked around online a bit, and now I have another question...   Is a moldy cork actually bad?   Will filaments from the mold eventually dig in to the body of the cork deep enough to reach the mead? "
12,Can carbonate reducing solution lead to off flavours?,"I live in an area with very high alkalinity ~ 320 mg / l CaCO3. I am planing on using Carbonate Reducing Solution CRS to bring the alkality down to acceptable levels for pale ales. To lower the alkalinity to ~ 40 mg/l CaCO3 i will need to add roughly 1.5 ml of CRS for every litre of mash liquid.   My question is, at this level Am i likely to taste the CRS? If there are likely to be off flavours i will probably cut my tap water with a known bottled water, although in the UK it is difficult to get hold of RO or DI water. Is there a better acid source to achieve my goal?  "
13,Adding strawberries to half of a batch - too much oxidation in carboy?,"I am currently fermenting a blonde ale, and I was thinking of adding strawberries after primary fermentation. However I don't want a full batch of stawberry ale, so I plan to rack only half of the 5 gallon batch onto strawberries.  I have another 5 gallon carboy that I can use, but am I risking significant oxidation by having half the carboy full of air? Is there anything else I can do? Should I buy a couple 1 gallon growlers? Other options?   Thanks! "
14,Can I make urwagwa?,"Urwagwa is a popular beer in Rwanda made from bananas, and I'd like to brew some myself. The recipes and methods I've read online have some very traditional methods (e.g. Bury the bananas for a while!) and most recipes ask for Sorghum as a leavening agent.   I'd like to know if anyone has a substitute for the sorghum and also for the method (the ones I have read only require the brew to be fermented for 24 hours - could/should it be done for longer?)   Could I just follow some basic banana beer recipe - or will that just leave me with something nice, but not authentic?  Sorry if this is too specific, but I got a bit curious and wanted to make something exotic. "
15,Benefits and drawbacks to different tubing types?,"We're making some big upgrades to our homebrew system and one of them involves moving everything to 1/2"" fittings and barbs. This means we need 1/2"" tubing that will easily and reliably fit on the barbs.  My question is regarding different options in tubing. I've been using the 3/8"" clear plastic tubing from the LHBS, but I'm curious if anyone has thoughts on other options. Silicon tubing has better temperature characteristics I hear? Does it last longer? Do you worry at all about impacts on the beer? Are there other better options out there?  Specifically I will need tubing to recirculate (I suppose by hand for now) and sparge in our new converted keg mash tun, as well as standard racking needs of course. Eventually (hopefully not too long) I plan on adding a march pump as well.  I haven't been worried about tubing up to now because racking just doesn't take that long, but I was curious if anyone had strong feelings on the matter. Do you all use the clear plastic tubing or have you found a way that works better? "
16,Yeast for very high gravity (1.138) stout,"I'm planning to brew a very high gravity stout. I'm expecting an OG between about 1.118 and 1.138 depending on how much my efficiency suffers. I've done this before with decent results, but I think I can provide a better fermentation than I have before.  I'm planning to mash pretty low (140-145F) so that I will have a very fermentable wort, and to minimize residual sugars.  I expect that I will want to use two yeasts; one to achieve the desired flavors (esters) and one to brave the extreme alcohol concentration and eat what it can. I'll probably stick with something like Wyeast 1272 (American Ale II) for the former; the latter I am a bit unsure about.  In the past, I've used champagne yeast, and I can't say I really had problems with it. However, even with a mash focused in the beta-amylase range, I still had a pretty sweet beer -- even after aging for a couple years. I'm wondering if another high-alcohol-tolerance yeast might attenuate a little better.  To this end, I'm considering using another yeast, like the Wyeast 775 Cider Yeast, that claims to attenuate much higher (over 80%). Wyeast even claims in its description of the yeast that it can be used for high gravity beers. In my case in particular, can a yeast really affect attenuation that much?  More subjectively, would you recommend another yeast for high alcohol fermentation?  I'm planning to ferment a bit lower to help keep excessive esters / fusel alcohols out. Something like 66F. Is this appropriate, or will I be hampering fermentation?  Lastly, should I let let the ""base yeast"" ferment until it has virtually stopped before pitching my high-alcohol-tolerance yeast, or should I pitch as it nears its theoretical tolerance limit? I ask because I'm concerned about the effects that might occur when the yeast hits its limit.  Edit: I'm aiming for a 10 gallon batch.  More Edit: I'm shooting for as much attenuation as possible. If I can get it up near 80, I'll be quite happy. I think I'll make a low gravity Dry Stout as a starter (5-10 gallons at about 1.040). "
17,What's the minimum safe immersion time to sanitize something with StarSan?,"How long should I keep something immersed in StarSan/swish it around for to ensure that it's as sanitized as I could reasonably hope it'll be?  I know everyone has a rule of thumb for this (I use 1min myself), but I was wondering if there are any hard numbers (culture tests or contamination rates etc) for this. How long does StarSan take to effectively sanitize something (clean plastic or metal)? "
18,Any need to stop yeast before kegging?,"I'm brewing to keg for the first time, finally. I am planning to force carbonate and was wondering: Are there was any steps I need to take to stop any active yeast before putting it in the keg and gassing it up?  Is this even something I need to worry about?  It will have been fermenting about two weeks before going into the keg. "
19,How to properly keep a warm kegged beer (short term),"This is a combination keg/carbonation/beer storage question.  I have only fridge/freezer room for either a carboy or my (currently 1) keg.   I have about half of the corny keg left of a light cream ale, and had to boot it out of my fridge to put in an IPA for a couple/3 week cycle. It was properly carbonated (seemed to work great at 11ish PSI) before I pulled it out and am keeping in a 75ish degree room.  For fun (and science!) I drew a glass off of it yesterday and it was all foam and then flat [tasting] beer under it.   So, my questions, in ""teach a man to fish"" style (and assuming there are no leaks in my system, which I believe to be true):  1) what is the phenomenon that changes how the carbonation level of the beer appears when it is at room temperature? In my mind, I think of a carbonated beer as having bubbles suspended in the liquid once the container is properly pressurized. i.e. a headspace of CO2 that is of sufficient pressure to keep the CO2 suspended in the beer. When dispensing, the pressure equalizes again to maintain that pressure. It's hard for me to visualize how the beer could come out ""flat"" looking if the pressure level of the system hasn't changed. Note, I turned off the CO2 when I took it into room temperature, as it seemed like the right thing to do(?).  Now, at room temp CO2 expands I believe (?), but why exactly did that result in what I observed? I think if I understand that, I'll understand much more about the process.  2) Given #1, and knowing that the beer style matters as far as how it ages, what would you target as a general rule/deadline to get it cold again?   3) Given #1 and #2, should I purge the keg while it is warm and sitting until it's cold again? If so, why?  I know that's a mouthful (or 3), but I feel like I'll understand much more and be able to fish (and drink) if I get these concepts nailed down :)  Thanks! (And as always, if you have articles or chapters of books you'd point to, I'd love those as well/alternately).   (This is brew #4, so surely I'll start to run out of questions soon...) "
20,How to get rid of gas from mead?,"I have brewed 5L of mead (1 part honey to 3 parts water). After 9 months I can no longer see any sedimentation in the bottle, however when I taste the mead I can feel it's a little sparkling (besides that it tastes okay). Does it mean, that the mead is still immature or will the gas leave when I put the mead in room temperature? (it now stands in a cellar with temperature several centigrades below room temperature).  So what should I do? Wait a little more or is it safe to bottle the mead now? "
21,Storing a counter-flow chiller,"I just got a counter-flow chiller put together and have used it a couple times. Needs some tweaks, but man it really chilled the wort!  After I was done I ran some hot water through it and tried to drain it as best as I could. I was wondering what the best way to possibly store the chiller for a couple of weeks would be so I don't get any weird growth or something inside? Any thoughts?    Is blowing it out good enough?  Can I keep starsan in it and just cap the ends? Is that bad for the copper?   Thanks everyone!  "
22,Brew kettle ball valve straining,"I have a 10 gallon brew kettle with a ball valve. I have used it a couple times, and now own a counter-flow chiller. I noticed that all of the hot-break at the bottom of my kettle really seems to gunk up the ball valve and the speed of the draining. I mean it it still flows, but it does add some time to the draining. There are 2 things that I want to be able to do:   Be able to add a dip tube of some sort. Right now I leave a sizable amount of liquid at the bottom of the kettle, since the ball valve is off the bottom just a tad ( which turns out to be a bit of liquid in a 10 gallon kettle)...what is the best way to go about this? Also, with the dip tube of some sort, is there a way to maybe strain some of the hot break out? I mean it feels like it would clog any mesh I try to put in its way. Any thoughts? Is it worth it? I'm not getting a stuck drain, just slowed I guess.   Thanks for all of your help! "
23,Yeast Starter blew out!,"I made a 2L starter with 2 Wyeast 1056 smack packs, yeast nutrient, a shot of O2 at the beginning and intermittent shaking. Last night it was going strong and this morning it had a nice high krausen.   Then I went to work and came home to find that it went nuts. It wasn't much, but there was a nice little puddle of yeast next to the flask.  I've learned my lesson to use larger than a 2L flask for a 2L starter.  My questions are:  Did I lose too much yeast?   I'm not brewing until tomorrow morning so will there be enough reproduction of yeast cells by then to replace the lost yeast?  Or, should I just not worry and pitch it like planned? "
24,How long can you store StarSan in its concentrated form?,"I recently got back into brewing after a 5 year hiatus, and noticed that my StarSan is a little darker in color than the stuff they sell at the LHBS. The guy at the LHBS said it can lose its potency, but should be fine. I used a little bit more than I would have (not much) if it was fresh, and everything seemed normal.  Has anybody here had to store StarSan for a long period of time (2-5 years)? And if so, how did it work out? "
25,Fastest method of wort chilling,"I've heard of many different methods of chilling wort,  What is the fastest?  And what's the best cost vs speed solution? "
26,What differentiates the lag phase from fermentation?,"When making a starter, the intent is to make yeast. We use stirplates in part to continually oxidize the wort, enabling the yeast to multiply.  In this question about starter oxidation, one of the answers talks about lag transitioning to fermentation and quotes:  Fermentation (Wikipedia) says,     even in the presence of abundant oxygen, yeast cells   greatly prefer fermentation to oxidative phosphorylation, as long as   sugars are readily available for consumption (a phenomenon known as   the Crabtree effect)   Which makes me wonder, ""what really causes/encourages yeast to multiply?"". If there's plenty of oxygen and sugar, why doesn't yeast just keep multiplying? "
27,Does suspended yeast contribute to high SG?,"I've got a SMaSH beer (Baird Maris Otter and EKG) finishing in primary. It's been fermenting for just over a week. Starting Gravity was 1.046. I mashed at 154F for 60 minutes. Fermented with WY1335 British Ale II. I didn't make a starter, since the yeast was very fresh, ~95% viability. I oxygenated with pure O2 for 90 seconds. High krausen was observed at 36 hours, and fermentation was vigorous.  1335 is described as medium attenuation, high flocculation. I expected the beer to have started clearing by now, but it's still very cloudy.  I pulled a sample with a wine thief and measured the SG, and took a swig. It tastes very slightly sweet. If I had to guess, I would say 1.012. However, the hydrometer was reading over 1.020 even after de-gassing the sample.  I've drunk a lot of hydrometer samples, and I can't believe that this beer really has so much residual sugar -- it just tastes too dry. Is there anything that could be affecting the hydrometer reading? I wouldn't think that suspended yeast would affect SG, since it's not in solution and therefore not affecting the density of the liquid. Am I wrong? Is there something else that could contribute to an anomalously high gravity reading? "
28,Worried about extent of inflation of Wyeast 4766 package,My friend and I were trying to ferment some raspberries using the WYEAST 4766 Cider yeast. Now it's 1 day after we activated the package and it is still only partially inflated.   Should we buy a new one or do you think it is just a slowly growing yeast and it should be fine? Did anybody else have experiences when using this yeast for mead/wine or cider?  thanks for your answer! 
29,Should I worry about this smell?,"I have  stout fermenting and it has been in my carboy for a little over a week. Yesterday I opened the carboy to make a small intial addition of coffee beans and cacao nibs. Well when I opened it and smelled the brew, I got a strange almost plastic or rubber smell coming up from it.   Is this due to how young it is?  Should I worry about it?   I did everything down to the last detail so I cannot imagine it is contaminated. I hope the smell goes away. "
30,Carbonating a keg outside of a fridge until it is ready,"My refrigerator is full but I am kegging two Saisons today.   I plan on letting them sit in room temperature for 2 weeks and then moving them into the refrigerator when they are fully carbonated.   Given that my room temperature in the day is about 78F, but my refrigerator is 40*F, how do I set the PSI to account for the change in temperature 2 weeks from now?  Do I simply set the PSI to account for room temperature, and then change the PSI downward after I move the kegs into the colder environment? "
31,Yeast Problems!,"Brewing a porter, pitched my yeast and started with a 1.056. My air conditioner broke for 1 day and the beer got to about 80 degrees after about 1 1/2 weeks of fermentation.  Beer has been sitting at 1.036 for two weeks now. Can I repitch? Or is it needing to be dumped? And if I can repitch, does it need to be transferred to a new bucket first? "
32,Additional equipment for cornelius kegging,"My local supplier is selling refurbished cornelius kegs for a decent price and I would like to pick one up. I don't know the first thing about kegging though, and more importantly what additional supplies I need to keg up a brew.  I had a quick look at this tutorial but am still a bit confused. Here's my list so far:  Keg:    Gas Regulator:    Gas Tank (I'm sceptical about this):    Beer/Gas line and fittings:  Disconnects:    Beer Tap:    Or  (Seems quite pricey but if it's far superior then I'd get it)   Beer Line (Only needed with compensator tap?):    Gas Line:    Washers for good measure?:    Does this seem like a reasonable shopping list? Do I need one / more of anything? This is my supplier, if anyone wants to make alternative suggestions, they would be more than welcome to.  Any advice is greatly appreciated! "
33,When should I add campden tablets?,"So I'm still pretty new to home brewing, I recently finished my first batch of cider from a kit and the end results where ok. Nothing amazing, but it was something I made and feels extra rewarding.  Now onto the question, I plan to start my 2nd brew tomorrow, again, from a cider kit (This kit to be precise). I will be using tap water for my brew, since it's not really possible for me to transport 20 litres (5 gallons) of bottled water, without a car. I want to know, at what stage should I add my campden tablet(s) to remove all chlorine from the water?  Should I put the water in the bucket tonight, add the tablet(s) and then leave it 24hr, before adding the mixture, sugar and yeast?  Or, should I wait till tomorrow, add the sugar and mixture, then add the tablets and wait 24 hours before adding the yeast?  Bonus Question: Best ways to add carbonation to my cider? The sugar added into he pressure keg created lots of c02 to push the liquid out the tap, but the cider itself is flat when tasting.  Thanks and sorry for the long post :) "
34,Best way to estimate remaining fermentable sugars?,"This question is kind of for the chemists here, but I'm open to any ideas.  In this question Denny Conn, who is far more experienced than me, asserted that a beer is likely finished fermenting, despite being at 1.036 (from a start of 1.056). This would be a beer that's about 2.6% alcohol and 9% unfermentables. To me, that would be undrinkable. Many people suggested rousing the yeast and/or re-pitching to finish out the fermentation.  The important point is, how do you know whether that supposedly stuck beer has any fermentable sugar left? The yeast might have given up early, which is a common enough problem. Or maybe the mash temp was missed by a lot? Or maybe something toxic got into the beer, causing the yeast to die early.  Other than re-pitching and hoping for the best, is there any way to measure the simple sugars? I usually suggest tasting the beer, but the amount of hops will affect the interpretation (as will the taster). I'm hoping for a test as quick and clear as a starch test. "
35,Dynamics temperature measurement,"We fight to keep the fermentation temperature controlled, usually constant, but the fermentation is an exothermic activity, so in one side we try to remove energy, and in the other (inside, mainly in the middle), the energy is produced, and keep increasing along the fermentation.  So, if we measure the temperature in the fermenter walls we'll get one very near to the last one applied in the environment that is cooling the fermenter. But if we measure inside the fermenter (the wort), and keep going from edges to the center of the fermenter, the temperature grows progressively.  Considering the thermodynamics in fermentation when cooling is done from fermenter walls, if we measure the most hot point, we will have a lot of wort (in the fermenter edges) some degrees below the expected temperature. So if we measure it in the edges, we'll have a lot of wort (in the center) above the expected temperature.   In the dynamics of fermentation temperature control, how/where is the best spot to measure the temperature ? Center, edges, 1/2 from the center ? "
36,Which kind of hop should be used on a First Wort Hopped (FWH) beer?,Should I use Aroma or Bittering hop on my FWH? The time between the FWH and the boiling should be taken into account or it does not matter? 
37,Mash Boiler – What's a good boiler?,i'm new to the brewing game and am currently waiting for a few whole grain brews to come of age.  One thing i'd like to do is purchase a larger mash boiler and dedicate a bit of space in the shed for my 'micro-brewery'.  What makes a good boiler? Where should I start?  Any suggestions would be gratefully received!  Rik 
38,Sweeting and Bottling a cider/cyser,"I fermented 5 gallons of cider from 1.044 to 1.0. It's very tart, so I want to add 2 lbs of honey to sweeten it up.   I also want to bottle it with some carbonation. How do I prevent the honey from fermenting it back down to 1.0 and still sweeten the cyser?   I looked at carbonation tablets, but they just appear to be modified sugar cubes. If I stop the fermentation with Campden, can I still bottle carb it? "
39,Kegging process and serving PSI,"I'm now the proud owner of a corny keg. I just have a couple of questions about carbonating the beer and then what to do during / after serving.  As far as I'm aware, to carbonate the beer I just need to stick the Keg + Co2 tank at 10/12 PSI in a fridge at around 7C / 45f for a week.  Then I can turn the gas off to minimize leaking.  My first question is, what PSI to serve at?  I purchased this dispenser + hose + tap solution which has me worried. The length of the tube is about 22cm or 8.66"". The width of the tube seems to be 5/16"" or 8mm. Material appears to be PVC braided vinyl. The height from the keg seems negligible given the length of the dispenser.  I have had a look at some of the calculations for dispensing the beer but I'm don't think I'm doing it right.  It seems that I would have to bleed the all the gas from the keg before serving and then set the pressure to about 1 PSI to get anything except foam out of it. Would I then have to set the pressure back to 10 PSI to ensure the beer stays carbonated?  I'm just wondering if I should bite the bullet and purchase something like this to avoid any headaches when pouring day comes around.  Any advice is appreciated! "
40,"Homebrewing Soda, Safety Concerns","I wanted to try making my own soda this summer, and finally got around to it 10 days ago. Here's the thing. I didn't have/use any specialized equipment. I boiled water with sugar ~15 minutes, and combined it in 2-liter soda bottles with cool tapwater (dangerous?), flavor extracts and sucralose and let it get colder. Then added champagne yeast. Then stashed them in a dark cupboard. Today, I poured a little into a cup and it's fizzy and smells like it has a bit of alcohol, too.  But I know microbes can really mess things up and I just wanted to ask: Could the method I used be dangerous? Is there a risk of me having unintentionally grown a life-threatening bacteria, like the one that causes botulism? Thanks in advance. "
41,Sour Starter From Dregs,I bought Nordic Saison from Hill Farmstead and loved it. I have a Saison recipe that I really like and I want to try and sour that. I took the dregs from a 750ml of the Nordic and threw it in a small starter (1.030). I'm including a photo after three days. It looks like things are going well but I need to create another starter to bolster the culture. Maybe a step up to 1.040 and maybe 1.5 liters this time. Can someone confirm this and include any tips?  Also I read some references (after the fact) to using an airlock with sour starters. What's the reason for this and did I ruin it by not doing that?   
42,Should I use beer gas to dispense carbonated kegs?,"Suppose I have a keg of carbonated beer and a kegerator. Can I hook the keg up to beer gas (nitrogen, CO2 mix)? Would this affect the beer in any way, or would I have to carbonate with the beer gas to get any advantage to pushing with beer gas? Would I need a stout faucet? Longer lines to balance the system? "
43,Regarding CO2 in my keg,"Just kegged my American Stout last night. Gave it a little agitation at 30 psi, then left it at serving pressure around 8-9psi. First taste, it's great! The only slight thing I noticed I can only describe as ""the taste of the smell of an empty keg that has been filed and pressurized with CO2"".  Am I right to think this is the flavor of partially carbonated beer and will mellow/balance out in a week at serving pressure?  It's completely tolerable, I don't even remotely mind the flavor, but just wondering if anyone has experience with this?  The IIPA I kegged and carbonated the night before was agitated for around 3-5 minutes at 30psi, but the beer was already cold crashed for a week so it instantly absorbed all of the gas and was perfect and ready to go.  "
44,Necessity of Fermentation Temp Control while Brewing in Rural Paraguay?,"I'll be brewing for my second time in Paraguay and have a quick question in regards to the summer conditions down here. How important is it to maintain the fermentation yeast temperature range after primary fermentation? My main issue here is the heat (I live in a small hut with no AC). Also when it comes to bottling, if it's in the high 80s will that simply equate to a faster carbonation time or it may also potentially have negative effects?  "
45,Racking flavour - too strong?,i'm about to rack off my first batch of full-grain IPA. It's a small batch that has been fermenting about 14 days in a demijohn.  I tasted some briefly when racking and it tasted very strong which is not a bad thing but unexpected tbh. I thought maybe it's over fermented but after reading Is it possible to over-ferment? post i am unsure that's the case.  Now don't get me wrong it tastes fine but just very strong. Apparently i'm to add some sugar water and condition in in the bottle - Will this mellow the flavour?   Any advise would be gratefully received!  Thanks all!  Rik 
46,Krausening / Pitching Actively-Fermenting Wort,"I heard on one of the old Jamil shows that pitching actively-fermenting starter is a good way to get noticeable but subtle yeast character in a beer.  You need to start with an adequate amount of yeast, but basically to 'get the yeast going' before pitching it.  He was referring specifically to saisons, where you want a good amount, but (IMO) still subtle ester and phenol production, and a complete fermentation.  He was saying it was better to do this as opposed to purposely underpitching or fermenting hot, both of which are risky to say the least.    We ended up trying this on two IPA's with Conan yeast (from which we wanted ester production) and the results were awesome.  78 and 82% attenuation with the esters we wanted.    My question is does anyone know the science behind this method, assuming, as stated, equivalent pitch rates?  Why it creates SOME yeast 'character', but not too much?  The yeast are already in the growth phase, and I guess it would maybe minimize lag phase? "
47,Think my fermentation is stuck,"I brewed my 5th homebrew this Saturday, an all-grain American stout.  By Sunday I had very minimal bubbling.  Monday there was a bit more but far less than my previous batches.  Today there are none.  I've never had a batch bubble this little.  Typically in 24-48 hours the bubbling is pretty intense.  Not so with this batch.  I rehydrated dry yeast (Nottingham) and pitched at the manufacturers recommended temp.  Should I re-pitch more yeast?  Is my brew bad? "
48,Making a French Cider,"Ahoy!   I've been making ciders for last year (with more experience on beers and meads). Two things happened. I tried a french cider couple a month ago and I liked it to the point, that I won't mind making it myself. Also, 5 weeks ago I used French Saison Yeast (Wyeast 3711) on my common cider and on my session mead (both SG=1.050, FG=1.002). The result was fantastic (awesome aroma, taste and even appearance is somewhat close to the standard).  So, I've got some calcium chrolide for keeving in home environment, in couple of weeks I'll be getting a fresh pressed (early harvest) sweet cider from one of the local orchards. My question is, are there any restrictions on yeasts in French Ciders? All the recipes (not that many) suggest using like champaign yeasts. Would it be too odd and out of style if I use Saison Yeast?  Just trying to experiment a bit :) "
49,My ginger beer is a thick sludge. Where might I have gone wrong?,"I'm a novice fermenter who loves ginger beer, so I thought I'd try to make my own. I ordered some ginger beer plant from these guys and followed their guide: [website]For my first batch I added 1/2 cup white sugar, GBP, and the juice of 4"" of ginger root to a quart of water. I let it sit covered with cloth for 4 days, then I strained the liquid into two swingtop bottles and added 1 tsp. of white sugar to each bottle. I put the bottles in the fridge and ""burped"" them every day. After 3 days I tried the ginger beer, but it was too flat and sweet. The problem seemed obvious to me: I didn't allow enough time, and the fridge was too cold, for good fermentation.  For the second batch I added 1/4 cup white sugar, 1/4 cup light brown sugar, the GBP I separated from the 1st batch, and ginger juice to a quart of water. This time I let it sit for 7 days. I strained the liquid into 2 bottles again, but did not add extra sugar (I think I must have been scared of too much sweetness at the end). I did not put the bottles in the fridge but let them sit for 7 more days, opening them daily to release pressure (of which there didn't seem to be any).  Today I poured one of the bottles into a glass and a thick sludge came out. I tried a sip, and it did seem to have an alcohol bite to it, but this is definitely not what I had in mind.  What did I make? Is it salvageable in any way? But most importantly, how do I avoid this in the future? "
50,Effects of Over Carbonation,"I keg my beer and use force-carbonation to carbonate it. Does anyone know if there are any negative consequences to over-carbonating the beer, other than excessive foaming? Are there any long-term affects on the taste, texture, aroma, etc. if one were to over-carb a beer and then allow it to come down to normal carbonation over time? "
51,Pin lock dip tube requires multiple o-rings?,"I use pin lock kegs, and until now all of them have been Firestone/Spartanburg. I recently received a Cornelius brand three-gallon pin lock keg. The post threads on this keg are different from all the others, and so are the poppets. The ones that are installed look like this.  The problem I have is that if I only place a single o-ring on each dip tube, the posts leak from underneath. The posts just screw right on with no resistance, and it doesn't create a seal with the dip tube o-ring. I have to have two o-rings on each dip tube to create the seal. (I noticed there were two o-rings when I disassembled it to clean it.)  Is this normal? It really seems like the poppet is just too short. I've found this poppet, which is 1/8"" inch taller than the ones that it came with. It says it is for a Cornelius Type 'R', but I don't know if that's what I have. "
52,Breaking down liquid malt extract,"I've been brewing 2 gal batches of beer from extracts like Mr Beer. Their LME packets are only 8.8 oz. Can I take a 3.3 lb. can, dilute it with a sufficient amount of water and divide it up into 6 containers to use at a later time? How long can it keep? "
53,What effect do water ions have on mash efficiency *other* than adjusting Ph?,"I searched the questions and did not find an answer to my particular question.  As the title says, my question is: What effect do water ions have on mash efficiency other than adjusting Ph?  Put another way, do ions like Calcium, sulfate, carbonate, magnesium, etc. have a direct impact on mash efficiency or is their role limited to adjusting Ph?  Back story:  Brewed on Sunday for the first time with reverse osmosis water, which has virtually no water ions and a Ph of 7.  I used a buffering solution to adjust Ph to 5.2, confirmed with a digital Ph meter.  Other than that, I did not add back those ions until the boil phase.  My efficiency was horrible.  I think it was because I was also using new grain bags that were too tight, but I'm curious whether I should add the salts BEFORE the mash.   Thank you, Sean "
54,How fast does boiling water de-oxygenate?,Conventional wisdom states that dissolved oxygen is driven out of wort when it is boiled. I can certainly understand that after 60-90 minutes of boiling the oxygen would be all gone. What about when boiling wort for 10 minutes for making a yeast starter? How much of the oxygen is still there and how much oxygenation is needed? 
55,Maximum maximum Fermentation length,"I'm going to brew a batch of beer today.  I'm not sure how long I should keep the beer fermented. What is the maximum amount of time, that home brew beer can ferment  without it going bad ??? "
56,Head on a brigalow homebrew,"I've been testing out my brigalow homebrew! All the reviews I've found said its one of the worst kit beers out! Being my very first home brew... can't comment on comparison but can say that by tweaking the instructions a bit... I've now got a beautiful beer! I've no idea of ales, lagers, and all of that!   Carbonation is not too bad but very little head. How do I change that? How do you know if it has completed the carbonation process? Does carbonation and head retention go hand in hand?  "
57,Adding honey after initial fermentation,"I have a few carboys with various mead concoctions. Unfortunately I didn't have enough starting sugar so I want to add some honey to restart and get my ABV above its current level of 4%. I don't have much head space left to add more honey.   What is the best way to add more sugars and re-measure gravity for ABC calculations?  In the future, what should my starting S.G. be? "
58,Mead Aging - Pasteurize or not?,"I never aged mead before, I usually just let them finish the fermentation, back-sweet with honey, bottle and drink in a few days/weeks.  I make my mead in glass bottles of 750ml, 1L and 1.5L (I don't have a big carboy, they are very expensive here). I have a 1.5 L that I wish to age for a year to test. My question are:    Is 1 year aging a good starting point? Should I rack it before aging? If yes, how many times?  Should I rack it after aging? Should I back-sweet it before or after aging? In case of back-sweeting, should I pasteurize the mead or add any chemicals to kill the yeast? Which? I live in a subtropical climate place, with temperatures ranging from -5°C(23°F) to 35°C(95°F), will it be possible to age in ambient temperature or should I leave it in my refrigerator?  "
59,Is there any real need for a heating element on an STC 1000 fridge setup ( for most/many setups)?,"I am building a fermentation fridge based on an STC1000. Clearly if I had a heating side to it I would no doubt be better able to control the temperature; but I am not sure whether the heating element that I'm getting will be in in time for my next brew and I just got to thinking ... do I really need a heating element?   My point being that given that in my own circumstance the fridge would be located in a room temperature environment surely there's no real need for a heating side as the temperature if it gets too low will just heat up eventually ... probably slower than ideal, granted.  but my question is this: — Would the heating side be something which is ""ideal"" rather than something which is ""necessary"" in a scenario where the fridge is in an aprox 20C environment and I'm using US05 yeast ( which doesn't need high temperatures and has a reasonably wide temperature range), and given the fact that I'm reasonably new to homebrew so at this point I'm aiming more for good beers than great beers; to quote John Palmer ?  — and if I'm wrong about this could this please be explained. "
60,Input on recipe idea (are my calculations correct),"I'm looking for some input as to whether my planned recipe looks right.  I have only just finished my first ever brew and wanted to try my hand at pulling together my own recipe (but I am not skilled enough, nor do I have all necessary equipment to do all grain or start partial mashes, so would be looking at extract with some steeped speciality grains).  At the same time, I have been drinking a lot of Brooklyn Brewer's Sorachi Ace saison beer recently and it is probably my favourite ever beer, so I though I would try and clone it.   From the Brooklyn website I know that the beer has an OG of 15 degrees plato (about 1.062 gravity) and an IBU of 34.  I also know that a little while back, they produced a homebrew kit which shows the hopping schedule but unfortunately not quantities (1/8 hops @ 60mins; 1/8 hops @ 30mins; 4/8 hops @ 0mins when boil is turned off and remaining 2/8 hops for dry hopping after 3 days of fermentation).  I know they use a belgian strain yeast too.  So... I was thinking of something like this:  My questions are:   Do the calculations look right?   The hops added at 0 mins when the heat is turned off and Belgian candi sugar stirred in to dissolve - my understanding is that there will be no efficiency and therefore no IBU contribution.  If they are being strained from the wort, is this not a MASSIVE (given the amount used) waste of money and hops? Or is it a case that there would be an IBU contribution while the candi sugar is added and dissolved and then while the wort cools?  If so, I definitely need to rethink my hop schedule, but I'm not sure how to calculate IBU contribution while the wort cools in order to adjust my other scheduled amounts. The yeast - Brooklyn use their own strain of Belgian yeast so I figured this would do the job - but does anyone know if it will be good for a beer that typically has or aims to achieve an FG of around 1.005 or an ABV of approx. 7.2%?   Thoughts/comments/guidance much appreciated, though I am happy method-wise and do appreciate it is not always necessary to boil extract I do feel it is worthwhile if nothing else to get experience of the boil and understand the process better, so really looking for advice on the recipe per se.

61,"Semi-Sweet, Medium ABV, Sparkling Mead - Is it possible?","I may asking to much for a homegamer but is it possible to make semi-sweet/sweet mead carbonated?  I'm trying go for around 1.05 FG and 7%~10% ABV. This can be done easily fermenting dry then adding honey afterwards. But if I want to make it sparking I need to ferment it further, which will either leave me with a dry sparkling mead or a a semi-sweet flat mead... Or a bottle bomb.  I was thinking about it and I came up with three ideas.   Fermented it dry, add extra honey for priming, add a non-fermenting sweetener (Stevia? Lactose? Xylitol?) Fermented it dry, kill the yeast via pasteurization/chemicals, add extra honey to desired FG, add dry ice for carbonation. Fermented it dry, add extra honey to desired FG, add a bit more honey for the priming, pastureize after a couple of day. (But how to be sure that is in the desired FG/Carbonation?)   What do you think? Any other ideas? Or is it impossible to do this? "
62,GCB Materials on Cold Wort Aeration,"Currently studying for the General Certificate in Brewing from the IBD.  The section on wort oxygenation/aeration states that a disadvantage of in-line cold wort aeration is the     need to increase solubility by injecting small bubbles or ensuring vigorous mixing and injecting when wort pressure is high   Wouldn't the relatively cool temperature of the wort actually increase the solubility of the oxygen, and so reduce the need for vigorous mixing?  Or is this actually a reference to the aeration taking place inline, and so being at relatively higher pressure than when in the fermentation vessel? If so, I wondered why it isn't listed as a disadvantage for inline hot wort aeration as well. "
63,"After remaining inactive for a long time, what gear would need to be replaced and what gear can be cleaned/reused?","It's been over 5 years since I brewed my last batch.  I'll be moving in a few months into a new place and I'll be able to start brewing again, the problem is what equipment is toast from sitting idle after that long and what equipment can be cleaned/sanitized and put back to use?  I am going to assume that metal/glass stuff is on the clean/sanitize list, but what about plastic fermenters?  Hoses?  Airlocks and other plastic/rubber stuff?  What about chemicals like PBW, Yeast nutrient/energizer, or sanitizers? "
64,What are best practices for cleaning and passivating stainless steel pot/fermenter?,"What are the recommended ways to (a) clean/sanitize stainless steel and (b) if necessarry passivize the stainless steel after the treatment?  While there is a question asking about ""Cleaning stainless steel"", this question, despite its title, is rather ""how to revocer/repair a damaged stainless steel"".  What I would like to know is:   what chemicals to use for cleaning (detergents and sanitizers)  what chemicals to avoid (to not deteriorate the stainless steal) what tools to use / to avoid (i.e. are ""abrasive cleaning pads"" a no-go, as they scar the surface)? when/is re-passivation of the stainless steel necessary?   To give some background to the question here some background:  My brew-setup (pots, fermenters, valves) consists of stainless steel alloys which I want to clean, i.e. remove also not eye-visible biological agents (in order to avoid contamination. Even though my setup is stainless steel alloys of the 300 series, it might be necessary to follow up any cleaning agent, with a passivating, re-passivation step, as to not risk the anti-corrosive attribute of the stainless steel. "
65,"Are there levels of infection in a beer or is it a case that it's either ""infected"" or ""not infected""?","I am trying to understand the nature of infections in beer. I find it difficult to imagine ( considering there are wild yeasts and moulds and micro-organisms in the air - aren't there? ) a scenario where a beer is 100% free of infection, or is this normally the case with a properly brewed batch? Or is it a case that when infection is lower than some threshold we don't notice it and that beer is considered to not be infected?   I am interested because being new to homebrew and educating my palate, particularly with regard to off flavours I often wonder whether I have some kind of infection. But I would usually discount this if the beer is question is pretty drinkable, because I would have assumed that an infected beer would REALLY stand out and not really the kind of thing easily confused with an off flavour, but considering what I was asking about above; could it be possible to have a small amount, or even a tiny amount, of infection being responsible for off flavour if we define infection as ""above a certain ( detectable ) threshold""?  If that's the case then is it a case that we're trying to reduce infection rather than avoid it, or is it possible to avoid it altogether - and is it a case that minute infections are common but to the degree that we eradicate these we are likely to get better tasting beers?

66,Poor Carbonation,Simpley stout from midwest supplies:tested bottle after 1 week. Sharp sparkeling bubbles like soda no foam. Oily residue on top after bubbles dissapate. Did add safe ale 05 to botteling bucket used belgian candi drops in bottels. Save it or pitch it?? 
67,Iodophor and StarSan reaction?,"I have a spray bottle of Iodophor, and a spray bottle of StarSan.  Is there any issue with the two products reacting with each other?  In other words, can I spray something with StarSan, and if I accidentally spray it again with Iodophor, is there any concern? "
68,Safale US-05 Temperature Drop,"I am brewing a stout and using Safale US-05. Here in middle Georgia the weather is already plenty warm so I'm using a water bath to keep my wort at a stable temperature. I pitched this yeast at a temp of 60°F and planned to let the temp gradually grow 1-2 degrees per day until primary was finished. I'm on my fourth day of fermentation. Things seemed to be still going well until I checked my wort temp this morning and it was 69°F.   I was worried about the temperature rising too much while at work, so I chucked a frozen gallon jug in the water bath to neutralize the yeast activity, but I came home on my lunch break to find the wort temp at around 62°F. Obviously, I'm worried about the yeasties going down for a nap prematurely.   I'm curious how resilient is Safale US-05 to temperature drops. I know some yeast strains can handle it, but 7 degrees feels like a lot to me. OG was 1.076 and fermentation didn't reach high krausen until yesterday morning.   If my fears are realized and fermentation stalls, should I raise the temp to 75°F and try to stir them up or keep the temp at 70°F and stir them up? What are my options? "
69,"Aged beer, yeast","I have aged my bourbon brown in secondary with bourbon and wood chips thrown in, it's been aging for 6 months now.

70,Fermentation issues,Just started an Coopers Amber Ale. Started out good....bubbled profusely for 2 maybe 3days and then just stopped? It slowed down to almost no bubbling in the airlock. Did take a sample from the tap and its down to 1012 on the hydrometer. Will do another this afternoon. Is the sudden slowing down of bubbling in the airlock a problem? Id prefer not to open the fermenter. What else could be an indication that something went wrong? 
71,Orange wine - do these recipes make sense?,"I've been thinking of making orange wine. I have found a few recipes online, though I'm not sure if these recipes make sense.  The first one:  [website]Two more:  [website]The first recipe listed seems to use a lot of sugar - 3 pounds for 6.5 pints (I think that will come to ~ 3 litres, &lt; 1 gallon). And then there's the juice from oranges on top of that, which will have more sugar!  The first recipe on the second page I linked calls for just over 1 pound for a total of 1 gallon of liquid (including the juice from the oranges).  And then the second recipe on the second page also calls for 3 pounds of sugar.  Is there a reason that orange wine recipes seem to call for so much sugar? Is it likely that the sugar will be consumed during fermentation, producing a dry, high-alcohol drink, or is the quantity of sugar so high to ensure a sweeter final product? "
72,Would this grain bill make an Amber Ale?,"I am planning a small experimental 1 gallon BIAB batch of something like an Amber Ale.  According to one article I've found:  Description of Typical Grain Bill     Amber Ale is traditionally made with American two row pale malt as the   base, making up 60-85% of the grain bill. Medium to dark crystal malts   are used to provide color and caramel flavor, typically making up   10-20% of the grain bill.   My Proposed Grain Bill   2 lbs. Briess Organic 2-Row 0.5 lb.  Briess Caramel 60L 0.5 lb.  Crisp Amber Malt   If I were to follow the amounts above, which would put my base malt at 66% and medium/dark malts at 33% (higher than normal for this style), what would I get?   Would it simply be a darker than normal Amber Ale or would it cross into another style? "
73,Off flavors that seem to be related to carbonation drops,"The last two batches I have brewed have been 1 gallon batches using carb drops. I have used these before a handful of times without issue but the last two seem over carbonated and leave a funny taste in my mouth that's reminiscent of helium or CO2 rather. Tho, from what I have read, the carb drops are ""great"" because they can help with consistency and avoid over carbonating. Is it possible these off flavors could be related to something else? The current beer I'm referencing has been bottled for 4 weeks now. Is it possible the flavor is still maturing and this carbonated taste will dial back a bit in time?   Has anyone experienced anything similar? I'm having a hard time explaining this taste and could be off entirely on its origin.  "
74,Belgian funk taste,"Have made a couple of beers with Belle Saison yeast and have seen a couple of posts about this and other belgian yeast producing funky flavor. After having tasted my own beer I have to agree, there is differently a flavor that I can not define as anything else than funk. I'm not yet certain if I dislike it or actualy like it but I do lik that the beer gets dryer. In any case two questions:  Does anybody know what this flavor comes from?  Will it develop on the bottle and if so how? "
75,Beer made at around 13°C (55°F),I do not have much opportunity in the way of temperature control when it comes to fermentation but I do have a hallway where if I close the door I get around 13°C ambient (measured about 40cm above the floor). I'm wondering if there are any yeast and beer styles I can make that would be okay at this temperature?  I'm worried about both diacetyl and sulphur but guess I could bring the fermentor into a room that is closer to 20-22°C for a diacetyl rest after primary fermentation? 
76,Bubbles within glass,"  Hello. I have been brewing for a few months and your advice has been extremely valuable. Thanks.   I have a question about glass bottles such as this one in the photo.

Thanks for your help  Regards Rob "
77,Cotton looking mold on my sour,"This is the second time I'm doing a no-boil, fast lacto sour. I had nearly 3 lbs of grain (with about 9% acid malt) for a 1 gallon batch. I did BIAB for 1 hour and put right into a fermenter. I let it cool down to about 100 °F and pitched 2 pills of Lactobacillus plantarum from Swanson Probiotics. It sits in a room without A/C, so the heat remains fairly high especially now with a heat wave in Southern California. Day 2 I added 2 more lacto pills.   Here is a pic from day 3, which looks fairly normal:    On day 4, I noticed a patch of cotton-looking growth at the top left of this picture (hard to notice):    pH dropped from 4.54 on day 1 to 3.57 on day 4. I tasted a little sample from day 4 and I can taste the sourness. The smell seems normal: there is no vomit, fecal smell, but rather earthiness.  Should I remove that cotton growth? Keep it and boil? Just let it go normally? Last year I did this same method (BIAB, no boil, lacto, saison yeast, dry hop) but with L. delbrueckii and had a great success. But with this cotton thing, I'm slightly concerned. "
78,Can I increase secondary fermentation temperature after a week?,"My ale batch (US-05) was fermented at 68ºF for 11 days, when I removed the sediment and moved it to a Secondary Fermentation with a much lower temperature (41ºF) for a week now.  Since yeast has to be active in order to refine the beer taste (which is kind of the point of secondary fermentation), I wonder if it would be useful to increase temperature now, back to around 70ºF. I dread letting all the last week work, which is creating cold break and more sediment, will be lost (or: will the sediment go back to the beer?). Could I add some table sugar to help the yeast get back to life a little bit?  Finally, can I just bottle right now and let the yeast do its work inside bottle, with the help of prime sugar?  What do you fellow homebrewers think? I will add the hops for dry hopping now. Can I increase the temperature either way?  Thaks a lot :) "
79,When is the right time for kegging?,Hi I am about to keg for 1st time and my question is this do we force carbonate right after fermentation is over?For example a lager beer style will go for laggering before or after  force carbonation? 
80,Stuck Fermentation on Cider?,"I previously posted about a cider that kept bubbling. Since then, the cider stopped bubbling. I checked the current gravity, and wonder if I have a stuck fermentation because the specific gravity has not changed for five days..  OG was 13.5°Brix on a properly calibrated refractometer. The current gravity is 5.6°Bx, and has been there for five days. The cider is apple juice concentrate diluted to the OG, and pitched with 6 g of properly rehydrated Mangrove Jack M44 yeast. I did not use any yeast nutrient.  I understand the FG should end up at 0°Bx.   The cider has been fermenting since Nov. 19. Original fermentation temp in the cellar was 66-67°F for 3 weeks. It naturally dropped to 63°F. I brought it upstairs a week ago, and it is at 70°F.  Should I just expect the cider to take a long time, and exhibit more patience? Or does more need to be done? Rock the carboy to rouse the yeast? Increase the temp more? Move if back to the cellar. "
81,Temperature of maturing,"When we say that we leave the beer to mature, at what temperature does that happen and does it need to be carbonated? Can a beer mature in a keg? "
82,Filtering Beer with Coffee Filter,"I want to know if anybody has tried filtering beer with coffee filters? I'm tempted to play with this idea at a later date. I would be concerned about aerating the beer too much, so again has anyone made any enclosed rigs for the coffee filters?  Because the microns of the filter is not heavily regulated, I'm imagining some sort of spaced-out-multi-layered structure of filters clamped together could work.Anyone have any examples, tutorials or projects with this? "
83,Why are green bottle less favoured?,"I'm reading a lot about people not liking green/clear bottles and going for brown bottles, which I believe is traditional and correct in regards to protection from UV/Daylight.  But why is it such an issue? I store mine in the fridge, garage, cupboard and in cardboard boxes. If prolonged storage in sunlight is removed what is the issue? I can't imagine an hour or so in a ice bucket at a BBQ can do much harm, can it?    Related: Does skunk off flavour go away? What does skunked beer taste like, How would you describe skunked beer? "
84,How long can I store crushed and whole grain?,I want to buy a large pack (25kg) but i will only use 10kg to start. How long can I store the rest? How long can they be stored if crushed?  
85,Maintaining a constant room temperature,"There's a lot of discussion about maintaining the correct temperature of fermentation vessels, but pretty much all of the stuff I read assumes people are either in the desert or the arctic! Being in the north of England our outside temperature can vary (in extreme cases) between -10C (14F) and 30C (86F). There are times when I would be wanting to reduce the temperature of my FV, but other times when I would like to raise it.  There are methods like the wet blanket, refrigerator, or fish tank heater solutions but all of these require that you man a sentinel post to watch over your brew to tweak the temperature either way.  So, let's say I'm wanting to set up a dedicated fermentation room (and perhaps another dedicated conditioning room) and I want to keep the temperature constant which may involve either heating or warming compared to the outside temperature. I would also like to use a ""set it and forget it"" type system. What is the easiest way to achieve this? Is there a single type of product that can do this or do I need to rely on separate heating and cooling systems?  In the UK we don't have houses with air conditioning as standard because it is rarely used - therefore I have no real experience of its capabilities other than their use for cooling hot, stuffy offices... would that be the correct solution?  Cheers! "

87,Would radon in the water supply affect the brew?,I am looking at a place to buy and start a nano-brewery; it has a radon mitigation system. Are there any effects from radon mitigation on the water quality? How will it affect the beer taste and quality?   
88,What Beer Line or Hose Size Fits the Cornelius/Corny Keg Barbed Quick Disconnects?,"I'm needing hoses to run to and from my barbed ball-lock quick disconnect on my cornelius keg.   Which diameter should I be getting? Do I need reinforced hoses?     Answer:   1/4"" (6mm) Inner Diameter. 3/16"" (5mm) Inner Diameter, with boiling water to soften and stretch. Reinforced is not required.  "
89,How did people know whether their brews were done before the hydrometer was invented?,"All advice I've seen given here and on other brew sites relies heavily on the use of a hydrometer, which I assume is a somewhat recent invention. However, people have been brewing and drinking for thousands of years - what did they do in the past? Does anybody here brew without the use of measure-reading instruments?  edit: I'm not talking about just beer, I'm wondering about any alcohol ferment (beer, wine, cider, etc). "
90,CO2 All Gone - Leaked through tap?,"I've had my CO2 tank hooked up to a 3-keg keezer for 6 months with no issue - and then one day I went downstairs and the CO2 is empty - but I haven't used nearly enough for it to be empty - and last time I checked the gauge (a week ago) there was plenty of gas left.  My question is - is it possible for one of my taps (perlicks) to be open enough to leak out co2, but not to be dripping beer?  Is there a chance that's how I lost the gas?  Thanks! "
91,Will a Yeast Starter Exposed to Sunlight Materially Effect the Beer?,"I know not to expose a fermenting carboy to sunlight, but is it OK to expose a yeast starter? I have two of them next to a window with blinds that are ineffective at blocking sunlight. I didn't think about it until now. May I proceed with brewing or should I throw these yeast starters down the drain? "
92,How to Use a Johnson Temperature Controller in Combination with a Ferawrap - Probe conflict with Raspberry PI,"I received the Johnson A419 Digital Temperature Controller and will be getting a Fermwrap today in the mail (and I will be brewing tonight hopefully).  I noticed that the Johnson model comes with a probe. Do I sanitize this probe and place it through the airlock into my wort?  I currently use a Raspberry Pi with DS18B20 temperature probes to monitor the temperature of my wort, which I store in a database. I sanitize these probes and place it through the airlocks into my wort.  I would not be able to fit both the DS18B20 and the Johnson probe through the airlock as the diameter isn't big enough.  Must I sacrifice my statistical experiment to accomodate the Johnson probe?  On the other hand, is there a way for me to put the Johnson probe through the airlock and then read send the temperatures from the Johnson Control to my Raspberry Pi (Or first to my Arduino and then to my RPi)?  Any ideas? "
93,How to Use a Johnson Digital Temperature Controller with a Fermwrap - General Questions,"This is my first temperature controller and first use of a Fermwrap.  I understand that the Johnson A419 Temperature Controller can only do hot or cold at one time. Which mode does it default to when you buy it?  I plugged in the Fermwrap into the controller and set the controller's set point to 80F. The Controller read 66F, but the Fermwrap did not warm up. Not sure whether or not the default mode was cold, I set the set point to 50*F and a green light switched on. I assume this means that the Fermwrap is about to warm up. I flipped the jumpers to set the controller to hot mode.  I set the controller's set point to 80*F and the differential to 1.  I laid the Fermwrap on the ground and put the johnson probe directly on it, and the probe quickly warmed to ~74*F.   I then taped the Fermwrap onto a carboy full of water. My Raspberry Pi with its waterproof DS18B20 temperature probe is telling me the water is 65.18*F. The Johnson probe that I taped to the carboy with styrafoam is at 68*f.  The water in the carboy is not heating up -- How hot can the Fermawrap get? Or more appropriately, given an ambient temperature, let's say 40*F, can the Fermwrap pull the carboy up to 60-70*F? I've read about people using a freezer with Fermwraps wrapped around a carboy to support ale temperatures, so I would think this would be OK.  I'll update this question, but the carboy is not moving up in temperature. The Fermwrap barely goes around 1/2 of the circumference of the carboy.  I'm wondering if it will just take a while to heat that much water and/or if the Fermwrap is simply ineffectual. The temperature is supposed to drop to 45*F tonight. Can I expect the Fermwrap to counter the drop in temperature quickly enough?  Are there any tricks I should be doing? I thought about wrapping the carboy in some kind of insulating material, but the piece of paper that came with the fermwrap suggested that this would be inappropriate.   Edit - 17:50 PST the temperature of the water has increased from 65.18 to 65.3.  Edit - 18:10 PST increased to 65.4116*F  Edit - 18:50 PST increased to 65.6366*F. The Johnson probe on the outside of the carboy says 72*F. I thought it would have been in line with the temperature of the water in the carboy.  Edit - 23:10 PST increased to 68.45*F. Johnson probe reads a whopping 76*F. This doesn't look good.  Edit - 01:00 PST increased to 70.025  Edit - 10:00 PST the following day increased to 72.95. The Johnson probe reads 72. This looks better. "
94,Leftover Juicing Pulp in Beer?,"I'm a very new homebrewer and this may be a really wacky question, but I'm curious nonetheless. Every time I've made fresh juice using a juicer, I'm at a loss for what to do with the leftover pulp, and I feel bad throwing it away. I'd read of recipes utilizing the pulp in bread or muffins, but I'm not much of a baker. But, I was wondering if the pulp could possibly be used in a homebrew. Obviously, there's loads of beer being made with fruits and spices,but has anyone heard of pulp in particular being used? Any insight on when would be a good time to add it to the wort/beer? While boiling and adding malt? Right before starting fermentation? Any insight would be really appreciated. Thanks for reading!  "

98,Little hop aroma in first batch,"So... I just enjoyed my fist bottle of my first batch of home brew, and overall it was a success.  I know the saying is ""pour your first batch down the drain!"", but my first batch will certainly give me beer for a few weeks.  Not the best beer I have ever had, but certainly drinkable and hoppy.  It was a Double IPA kit from Brewer's Best, with Columbus hops for flavor and Cascade hops for aroma.  I could sit here and try to analyze my beer all day long, but I want to keep this simple and ""pick on"" the two biggest flaws I can detect.  The first is that the hop aroma disappeared almost immediately after opening the bottle.  When I first cracked the cap, it had a nice strong aroma, and after I poured it into my glass it also had an aroma.  However, after a few sips the aroma was gone.  The second flaw was the color, it had much more of an amber color than most double IPA's I have seen.    So, my questions are, what are some common mistakes or errors in the brewing process which I could look to correct in my second batch to reverse these flaws??  I boiled for 60 minutes, adding Columbus Hops at the start and with 15 minutes left, and then adding the Cascade hops at the end.  I let the wort cool in an ice bath, and it took about 2 hours to cool.  I transferred to my primary fermenter via a siphon, and I let it ferment for 15 days.  I bottled on 12/30/2013 and two weeks later (today) I cracked open my first bottle.  Thanks! Chris "
99,Is it important to reach pitch temps quickly?,"I have seen lots of posts where guys say they stayed up late because their wort hadn't reached pitch temp until 4am or somethinglike that.   What is the harm in just going to bed at 1 or 2, waking up and pitching 6 hours later? or even 8 hours later? "
100,Cold Crashing in the bottle?," Is it possible or advantageous to cold crash after bottling?  I am aftaid if I cold crash for 2-3 weeks before I bottle that all the yeast will settle out and I wont have any to provide carbonation in the bottle. If I cold crash in the bottle, will the increased sediment contribute to long-term storage issues?   Assume that I hit my FG and that no additional fermentation will take place (other than bottle carbing) "
101,Thick blobs of yeast cake looking stuff in my bottles (Image Added),"The last batch of beer I have made seems to have a lot more sediment in it than any of my other beers. It has been sitting for 3 weeks and some of the bottles when I pour have gloopy looking sediment which I am presuming is a yeast cake type of thing?  The beer is a Muntons Connoisseurs Larger with an OG of 1.048. I used Copper Tun Czech Pilsner No 62 for the first time (instead of 1kg of dextrose) and added an extra cup of castor sugar. After 6 days fermenting I added Wakatu hops by dry hopping without using a muslin bag and let it sit for another 10 days before bottling. The FG was 1.010.  The beer tastes fine but there is a bit of wastage when I am pouring them. Is the extra sediment cause by the use of the Copper Tun Czech Pilsner No 62 or is it something else I may have done?   The only difference between this beer and the others I have made is the additional Copper Tun Czech Pilsner No 62 and not using a muslin bag with the hops. I also note that the OG and FG are higher than I normally would have.  Here is the difference between two beers I have done. One was using the method above, the other was using dextrose, and hopped in a muslin bag. I had to use the flash for the image so you cant see the clarity as good but you can see the sediment better.  "
102,Krausen: Blow off tube or Larger Headspace?,"Krausen: to blow-off or not to blow-off?  With a large krausen (foamy head) in a fermentation vessel (FV), often the best remedy is to use a blow-off tube into a bottle of sanitizer.  Question: Would it be better to have a sufficient amount of head-space, so that nothing is lost from the FV, allowing all the yeast, wort, flavour, and hops to remain inside the FV? Has anyone noticed any loss of flavour with excessive blow-off, such as the loss of hop profile? "
103,Colour adjustment,"Is there a difference between darker malts in the color they give to the brew?   Melanoiden malts are said to give a red color, chocolate malts should render the beer brown. But there is just one color scale (EBC, SRM) that seems to go from yellow to brown.   Will I get a red color if I add a tiny bit of chocolate malt or will it just turn out brownish?  "
104,What is the point of mashing out?,"I know it stops the enzymes from breaking down any more sugar, but is there any other point to it?

In it the hosts talk about not boiling LME but instead just adding it straight to the fermentor, or really late in the boil. I have been boiling mine for the full 60 min as instructed by my LHBS.  Question is.    -What is the point to not boiling the LME for the full time?   -Can this be done with any LME? I think my LHBS buys in bulk and re-packages (it comes in a plastic tub with thier label but still says it is coopers)  -How will this effect the beer overall in regards to color, clarity, taste etc?  -In regard to these questions, does it change if I do a partial (2.5 gal) boil or a full boil? "
107,Is there a difference between soaking oak in bourbon and just adding the bourbon straight into secondary?,"As I was thinking about how I want to make my bourbon oak stout, I was thinking of how to soak the oak in bourbon.  I wanted to get the bourbon into the wood, for the purpose of putting it into my beer where it would get the bourbon out.    Is there a reason to do this?  It just sounds better than pouring a small amount of bourbon directly in, but I can't think of how it's different.  EDIT: I've thought some more about this.  I've had bourbon barrel aged beers, and the taste of Bourbon can be extreme.  What doesn't make sense is that there can't be that much bourbon liquid contained in the wood itself, let alone brought into the beer aged in it.  So does the wood somehow soak up flavor, allowing you to get the flavor without the alcohol and water? "
108,What causes wort darkening in the kettle?,"What reaction is happening in the wort to cause darkening?  Maltose for example doesn't caramelize until 365F.  Maillard reactions are another source of non-enzymatic browning, but they require low moisture, alkaline conditions and occur at 310F (on average).  So why does my wort get darker as it boils? "
109,How to use a Hambleton Bard s30 cylinder?,I've recently purchased a second hand (hence no instructions) pressure barrel keg that has an s30 adaptor that fits a Hambleton Bard cylinder (which I have also bought).

110,Airlock gasket on primary fermenter fell in when reinserting airlock,"I was checking the gravity on my fermenting beer and took the top off my bucket to do so.  When reattaching the airlock, the black rubber gasket on the bucket fell in.  I tried to fish it out with a sanitized spoon but was unsuccessful.  Will this affect my beer in the end?  I'm about half a week in to a 2-week fermentation and the active fermentation is done and that's why I was checking the gravity.  It's actually at the final gravity the kit says it should be at.  How should I get the airlock to stay in place for the remaining week and a half? "
111,Bad smell in pump tubing,"I recently upgraded from relying on gravity to a pump to transfer wort.   After the first use (an IPA),  the thermoplastic tubing that I used has a distinctive smell that I attribute to the hot hop resins.   Is an off smell in the tubing likely to contribute to off flavors or aromas in future brews?   I have cleaned it twice by pumping hot oxyclean through it, and am currently soaking the tubes in hot oxyclean, but the scent remains.   Is there a better way to clean it, so that it won't have this odor? "
112,Quantifying the level of hoppiness in a beer,Does anyone know of some sort of measurement for the hoppiness of a beer?  Late hop additions don't add much to the bitterness (IBUs) but they can add tons of hop flavor.  Is there some way to quantify this? 
113,Is there a way to get an average alcohol reading if I forgot to take a before reading??? ,Im a first time brewer and everything was going good until i realized i did not take a before reading.....    Is there still a way to get an average alcohol reading???  THANKS 
114,Confused about using a carboy,"I am BRAND NEW to home-brewing having just got a kit yesterday.  The nice gent at the supply store gave us so much information that my head was swimming when we left.  After reading web sites and ""How To Brew"" first edition, I am still confused on where in the brewing process the carboy comes into play.   The first brew I will be making is from a kit for a Belgian Ale.  The gent said to leave that in the fermenter for 'about 3 weeks' then bottle it.  At what stage in this do I use the carboy? Do I even need to use it?  thank for helping a newbie.  "

116,Mash / Hops Timing Confusion,"I am getting started with my first brewing experience, I have some doubt in my mind, and I was hoping someone could clear this up for me once and for all.  I have seen a lot of beer recipes that leave some vagueness to the hop addition timing, and the length of mashing out.  How long do you steep the grains/extract/sugar if the recipe doesn't say?  When a recipe lists some hops, and then a time, is that the time that passes after the wort starts boiling to add the hops, or is that the amount of time to leave the hops in?   Should I always assume a 90 minute boil?  Thanks.  "
117,Can I add more yeast during primary fermentation?,"I've got a brew that's been on primary fermentation for 10 days and still haven't seen any activity in the airlock (again).  Gravity has dropped from 1.040 to 1.014, but I'd still like to raise the alcohol content a little and am worried the beer will come out flat (much like my previous attempt).  I believe the problem is that it's too damn hot here and the yeast have been killed off, despite keeping the fermenter under an aircon vent &amp; starting fermentation at midnight.  I'd like to drop the carboy into an ice bath to get it nice &amp; cold, and then add more yeast.  Will this work?  Is there anything I need to consider? "
118,Good slant vials?,"I've been looking into making yeast slants, thinking it could be fun.  I've been looking for some test tubes online, and have a few questions.     Is it tough to use test tubes with stoppers rather than screw on caps? Will I be able to properly sanitize polyethylene, or should I spend the extra few bucks on glass?  Where is a good place to get them?  Are petri dishes better than test tubes?  "
119,How should I prep bottle conditioned beer for a competition?,"I'm going to start entering my beers in competitions.  I'm really interested in getting good feedback from BJCP judges.  To improve my showing, is there anything I should do with my bottle conditioned beer beer before dropping it off (or shipping it?)  In my experience the beer really benefits from some time in the fridge after conditioning has completed.  Typically I let it condition at 70+F for about three weeks, then I move the beer to my cellar and put as much as I can in the beer fridge.  The longer it spends in the fridge, the clearer the beer becomes and the more the yeast sediment compacts.  For a competition, is it better to chill the bottles in the fridge for a few weeks before dropping them off, or will the return to room temperature adversely affect the beer?  Is it better to leave the competition-bound bottles at room or cellar temp? "
120,Is there a limit to how many times you re-use bottles?,"I had my first bottle bomb ever yesterday, after 3 years of brewing.  I've had some bottles break during opening, some while bottling, and it's usually not a big deal, though sad.  Having one shoot out all over my laundry room is a much bigger problem that I'd like to prevent.  How many times do you re-use bottles, and how do you count if you do?  Is there any other way to evaluate the condition of the bottle?  This one was a 22 oz bottle bought at my local homebrew store 3 years ago, and appears to be the weakest type of bottle I use.    EDIT: Just for reference, I sanitize using iodaphor in tap water, so I don't believe there's much temperature shock. "
121,Does yeast choice matter as much in ginger beer?,"I'm about to brew a ginger beer and was wondering if the choice of yeast is as important in a ginger beer, where the ginger dominates the flavour.  I've got the yeast-under-the-cap packet and a US-05 to choose from &amp; wondering if the results will be much different.  Does the yeast choice make a noticable difference?  Why? "
122,What BJCP category does this breakfast stout fall under?,"Into what BJCP category should I enter this beer for competition?  I think I have to enter it in 21A - spice, herb, or vegetable beer - due to the use of cacao nibs, coffee, and bourbon.  The underlying style, I think, is either 13C - Oatmeal Stout - or 13f - Russian Imperial Stout.  It is an oatmeal stout, but the OG was 1.080, which is too high for 13C.  Can I enter this into one of the stout categories, or does it have to go into one of the specialty categories (21 or 23)?  I based the recipe on a clone of Founder's Breakfast Stout I found online.  That commercial beer is listed as an example of style 21A.  Recipe:   14 lb US 2-row 1 lb 6 oz flaked oats 1 lb chocolate malt 12 oz roasted barley 9 oz black patent 7 oz crystal 120   Mash at 154 for 60 minutes.  Boil for 60 minutes.   1 oz Nugget @ 60 min. 0.5 oz Mt. Hood @ 30 min. 0.5 oz Mt. Hood @ 0 min.   Final SG: 1.020  Two weeks in secondary with 1 pint cold-brewed Sumatra coffee and eight ounces raw cracked cacao nibs soaked in 1 cup Maker's Mark.  I calculate the bourbon added 0.5% abv to the beer, assuming it was all released from the cacao nibs. "
123,How should I combine grain and hot water when doughing in,"   Possible Duplicate:   Should the grain or strike water be added to the mash tun first?       Should I add water first, then grain? Grain, then water? Both at the same time?   I'm worried that adding grain to hot water might expose some of the grain to too high a temperature.

125,Effect of boil size on IBUs,"I have the following recipe on beercalculus:  [website]beercalculus (along with most IBU calculators), ask for both a target batch size (which for me is 5 gallons), and a boil size. I'm not sure what to put in for the boil size, because I do a partial boil of 2 gallons (I'm brewing with extract), then mix with water to bring the batch size up to 5 gallons. The boil size has a big effect on the final IBU's, so I'm trying to determine 2 things:   For partial boils, what would I put into one of these calculator for boil size? Why does the boil size effect the IBUs? I would have thought only the final batch size would matter, because the same amount of alpha acids are being dissolved regardless.   Thanks in advance! "
126,Measure water before or after adding Malt Extract?,"I just started doing a trial run of my first batch and I had a question.  I have a kettle that holds about 6 gallons.  If my batch size is to be 5 gallons and we assume 1 gallon will boil off, then this needs to be filled up to the 6 gallon mark after all of the ingredients go in, right?  So I may be only using 4 gallons of water, and the extra volume will be taken up by DME, right (ie., not 6 gallons of water + ingredients, 6 gallons total)? "
127,Beer calculators and batch/boil size with late fermentable additions,"It seems to me that the calculator that I have been using for my recipes (Beer Calculus) allows me to change my batch size, but does not let me adjust WHEN I add my fermentables, as to allow for higher hop utilization on a partial boil by adding a fair amount of DME and sugars at the 15/10 minute mark.  Does anyone have any input on what I should do with this?  Should I just calculate this by hand?  I suppose I could tell the calculator I am doing a full boil, half the water and fermentables, and use the same amount of hops since the gravity should be identical, and then add the other half of fermentables towards the end, finishing with pre-boiled water in the fermenter to achieve my batch size.  Is this an appropriate way to go about this?  Thanks again. "
128,Common practices for adding liquor to homebrew?,"I'm thinking about introducing sambuca (maybe grappa) into my next homebrew.  What are the common practices for adding?  secondary? bottling?  Recommendations for getting the ""right"" amount without dosing the whole batch? "
129,Final Gravity A Little Off,"I am at day 12 of my first brew from a True Brew Belgian Ale.  I checked the gravity at day 6 (the kit said I could be ready to bottle after 7 days even though everyone says let it go for a few weeks).  The reading I got was 1.020.  I let it go and checked it again (day 12) and got the same reading of 1.020.  According to the kit, FG should be between 1.007 and 1.011.  Is that 0.010 a big issue? It has been at the same gravity reading for 7 days days, what are the chances it will drop any more if I leave it in the primary?  Differences between Day 6 and Day 12 are:  - The beer is clearer, not as foggy and looks a lot like other Belgian Ales I have had. - On Day 6, there was quite a bit of 'fizziness' when I tasted it.  On Day 12, the 'fizziness' is much less but the bitterness is quite high (more so than the pale ale I am drinking right now)  Will the bitterness dissipate some if I leave it in the primary longer or during bottle conditioning? "
130,Homebrew Calendar/Planning Software/Site?,"Does anyone know of a solid application for pre-planning your homebrews? I have a really tight schedule, and determining when to start a batch can be a real hairball. There are lots of variables and points in time to consider.  For example, on a particular beer: I know I want my yeast on a plate for 36 hours, then 24 in the fridge, then equalizing for 6 before pitching, then 10 days in ferment, then 7 on dry hops, then 2 weeks keg conditioning, then ... you get the picture.  I'd love to be able to put these variables into something, then set either a start or end time for the entire process, and see where it all falls on a calendar. Then I can shift the whole process around until it fits my schedule, without changing the time between the individual variables.  I do this all manually on google calendar right now, but it's tedious and error prone to make changes. Thoughts? "
131,Primary fermentation taking a long time,"I brewed a California Common recipe that I've used successfully in the past on 10/15. I used Wyeast 2112 and made a starter that got going pretty well so I was feeling good about the brew. It's been bubbling in the airlock since then, though it has slowed down by now (bubbles every 30 seconds, roughly).  I took a measurement a week ago, thinking that the gravity would be pretty low since it had been bubbling for awhile, but to my dismay it was still at 1.040 (OG was 1.082).  My question is, is there a problem that it's taking so long to get down to a reasonable gravity? Or should I just let it continue to ferment and hope that it gets there eventually?  "
132,How do I culture yeast from a commercial beer? Is it legal?,"If I like the flavor profile of a yeast in a commercial beer, how would I go about culturing it?  I have some very basic lab equipment, but I can buy anything that's reasonably priced.  Also, would it be legal? "

137,How do I cut my extract brewing cost?,"I'm trying to reduce my cost-per-beer, without investing in an all-grain setup. I know I'm pretty limited with what I can tweak (can't get around needing sugar, yeast, and hops), but here in Montana it runs about $40 for each batch (even using Muntons yeast!). I'd like to reduce that if possible.  Any tips or tricks out there? Recommended places to shop? Brands to buy? Secret techniques I can't even imagine?  Thanks! "
138,How likely is contamination in an average batch?,"I sanitize everything; carboy, bottles, bottle caps, tubing, funnels, etc; because I was essentially told that my beer would turn to deadly poison without it.  I accept sterilizing the lot once because I understand the complications of infections, but how anal do I have to be after that point?   If I wash my hands regularly do I need to sanitize them as well? Do I even need to wash regularly, between touching everything? Do I need to sanitize the rim of the mouths of bottles? Do I need to resanitize equipment mid-use if it's been left out for a while (minutes, not days)? Can I sanitize bottles in advance? If equipment is cleaned and put away clean, can it just be rinsed and used without sanitizing next brew?   Not looking for answers to only these exact questions, but the experience of long-time brewers who can offer some anecdotal evidence would be appreciated. "
139,Is it OK to starting fermentation while wort is still warm?,"I'm just getting started, so in my first couple batches I realized I had a problem cooling the wort all the way down to 60°F/16°C recommended by my instructions.  I boil all of my water, but I don't have all day to let it cool before introducing the wort, which also needs to cool. Please let me know if I'm doing anything totally wrong or can be done better.  The best I've been able to do in the shortest amount of time is boil my water, let cool for 15 minutes and dump into my sterilized plastic fermenter pail. I place the pail in a utility tub full of cold water to cool while I start the wort.  After the wort is done boiling, I place that vessel in a bath of ice water in the sink.  I bring it down to 90°F/32°C before racking into the pail.  By this time, the entire mixture is about 90°F/32°C.  When I take my original gravity reading, it's always way off the mark from recommended due to temperature.  I adjust my reading to 60°F/16°C reference temperature.  Pail is then pitched with yeast, sealed, placed in basement, and airlocked.  1) Is there any harm to start fermentation while warm?  Will this affect the beer quality?  2) Is there any harm to let the wort sit longer to cool before going into the fermenter? "
140,How do I determine where the off-flavors of my brew are coming from?,"Is there a website I can visit that will describe where different off-flavors come from? For instance, if the beer tastes malty, fruity, or bitter, where can I go to determine why? "

145,Optimal counterflow wort chiller,"I am planning to build a counterflow wort chiller using a hose outside of a copper tube.  There are a great variety of lengths and types available commercially and I have read that many commercial solutions are not long enough to chill properly   What is the optimal length for a counter flow wort chiller?  It seems that with counterflow, it should not matter whether you are chilling 3 or 5 gallons.  Is this correct?  Do you just need the correct length to ensure that wort entering at ~200 °F cools to &lt;=70 °F by the end? Are there any particular construction materials and/or designs that work particularly well?  I am planning to purchase hose rated to up to  212 °F, copper tubing, and T (or similar) fitting on each side to separate hose from tubing.   EDIT: What factors affect the flow rate of wort within the chiller? "
146,Sloe wine: going very slowly,"Having started enough sloe gin this year to last a decade, I decided to use the rest of the fruit to brew some sloe wine. I'm new to brewing, and this might seem like an odd choice, but I have high hoped for it.  I boiled up 2kg of sloes with 2kg of sugar and not a lot of water, and put it all in a demijohn with some wine yeast provided by more experienced brewers.  It's been going a couple of weeks now. It was never very fast, peaking at one glub through the air lock every 30 seconds or so, but it's now even slower. I tried adding more sugar and mixing, but that didn't seem to make any difference. The mixture inside is very dense, dark and strong, so I can't really see what's going on in there. It's also not very wet.  The question is: should I be worried by this lack of activity, or is it natural for this kind of brewing? Should I be doing anything to fix it, or just leaving it alone? "

151,"When brewing a gruit, how do alternatives to hops, such as mugwort, affect the bitterness and flavor?","I have read about gruits (beers made with no hops, using other herbs in their stead).  Apparently, this was a commonly used technique before hops became so prevalent.  Mugwort seems to be one of the most common herbs used in gruits.  How does mugwort differ from hops, in terms of usage (how much to add, and when) and in the final product (taste, head retention, shelf life, etc).  Have you used any other herbs?  How do they compare to hops? "
152,How long should a barleywine be aged before bottling?,"I generally rack my beers to secondary for about a week before bottling just to clarify them a bit, but as I understand it, barleywines should be aged much longer to allow some flavors to develop and for others to mellow out.  How long should a barleywine-style ale be aged in secondary before bottling? How long should it be bottle conditioned? I know this will vary based on recipe, but are there some generally accepted guidelines? "
153,Is this recipe correct,"Hi I'm brewing some apple wine at the moment, following a recipe for a dry apple wine from CJJ Berry's ""First Steps in Winemaking"" (2006 reprint p185).  The recipe lists ONLY the following ingredients:   2.75k apples (I used golden delicious) 1 kilo sugar 150ml white grape concentrate 1 teaspoon citric acid 4.5L water Yeast &amp; nutrient   At no point in the recipe does it mention adding the citric acid, but it does mention within the method that you should ""strain the stewed apple liquid onto the sugar and the thinly peeled rind of the lemon "" (my emphasis). The lemon juice is added with the yeast. The lemon is never mentioned in the ingredients.   Obviously there's a printing error/typo that never got picked up in proofing, but should I be using both lemon and citric acid, or only one? The wine has just about stopped fermenting, and I'm about to rack it off for bulk aging. If I needed to add the citric acid now (I used only the lemon) is it too late? "
154,"Can anyone recommend a starters kit, available in the UK?","I have inherited a garage after a recent move, and as I also have off street parking, it seems only right and natural that I start to indulge my desire to start homebrewing.

A lot of people have advised me to start with a kit, and I wonder firstly is this good advice, and secondly if anyone has one they would recommend? I am without anything more than space, with regards to equipment, so is it a good idea to opt for one that comes with bit of kit?  any help would be warmly appreciated. "

I've had trouble in the past with 'bigger' beers (this one is ~7, ish) that have conditioned a long period of time.  When do I know I should reintroduce yeast at bottling time? Is it a function of time and ABV?  How should I go about re-yeasting? I'm assuming I should use a neutral strain of yeast, but how much should I use?  "

I stopped it back up and bottled it a few days later without problems.  But, I would like to know how this happened?  I waited a little over a week to transfer to the secondary.  The fermentation lock was bubbling once every couple minutes.  So, I'm thinking primary fermentation was done.  I cleaned the secondary carboy really good (so I thought) and added the hops.  Any ideas here?  Is this just a contamination issue?   "
158,Using mason jars to bottle in?,"Has anyone used mason jars to bottle in? What were your results if so? They are being sealed like when you can, so I'm especially curious if they hold pressure well.  (I know they are clear, and that presents risks as far as light exposure is concerned.) "
159,Keezer ~ Collar vs Faucet top tower,"I am just getting ready to setup my keezer. I like the ease of use with a collar, but my little 7 cubic foot freezer is only as tall as my junk. I am concerned that it will be uncomfortable to draw a nug and even worse for a pitcher at that height.  The tower has its own drawbacks obviously, such as cutting a hole in the freezer lid and opening the lid with the tower, and limiting my capacity to 2 kegs with a 10# CO2 bottle.  For you guys out there that have had keezers for awhile, how do you feel about your setups? would you have gone the other route if you could? are you comfy while pulling draughts?  What else have I forgotten to ask?  thanks in advance for your input! "
160,Testing Bottling Carbonation,"So, I bottled 6 days ago. I'm a little impatient, and want to see how my carbonation is going. What can I expect if I pop one open today? I haven't noticed any difference in the beer in the bottle, aside from the expected settling of the final sediment. By 'pop' I mean the 'spssss' sound when opening.  Further, if the cap pops when opened today, is it ready (obviously depends on testing and drinking it)? If not, how long until it's ready, given the pop and carb level after only 6 days?  EDIT1 Just put one in the fridge. Will report back in an hour on the status. Here's hoping I get at least a little carb :)  EDIT2 Just popped the test bottle. Got the pressure when popping the top, got a slight head. Feels half flat, as expected after only a week. Tastes amazing! This is my first bottle from my first batch. I think I did good, this is a very flavorful beer, good body, aroma, mouth feel. I'm proud to name it 'Frist'. "
161,What are Esters?,"I am reading a lot about yeast cell production and ester production.  I think I have a good handle on the yeast cell production, but what are esters?  Is that part of what the yeast consume that give beer a off flavor?  I am trying to get as much info as I can to produce the best possible brew.  "
162,How do I get a turkey baster out of a carboy?,"When I was pulling wort out of a carboy to take a hydrometer reading, the bottom part of the baster separated from the head and fell into the carboy. What's the best way to get it out with the fewest question marks for contaminating (""infecting"") the wort?  I have some mason line that I could use to fish it out, but I'm worried that, no matter how long I soak the mason line in sanitizer, it won't completely sanitize. Am I needlessly worried? Help. "
163,Longer time on yeast for a bigger beer?,"I ferment all my beers single stage in a glass carboy immersed in a water bath to maintain temperature. This is the first time I've made a bigger beer (this one started at 1.080) on this system. I made a nice big starter and aerated twice. It took off well and visible signs of yeast activity are essentially gone after a week; everything looks great.  Typically I would allow another 1-2 weeks for the yeast to clean up before bottling. My question is: with a bigger beer, and without the option of transferring to another vessel for conditioning (other than a bottle), should I give the beer more extra time on the yeast, or less?  I would guess that additional time would allow the yeast to clean up the larger amount of by-products it likely produced during the adaptation and attenuative phases, but the environment inside the fermentor is also more hostile, so perhaps off flavours from old and dying yeast, which I normally am not concerned with, and have not noticed in my beers, are worth worrying about now? "
164,fermentation and dry hopping,"I'm thinking about dry hopping my current batch. It's still fermenting and bubbling, and the krausen hasn't dissipated yet. Should I wait for fermentation to stop? Should I wait for the krausen to fall out? "
165,Does a protein rest even do anything?,"I have been looking at brewing several recipes that call for a multi-step mash that includes a protein rest. I saw a Mr Wizard article in BYO that sort of defends protein rests.   Just like the questioner in that article, I thought that protein rests were unnecessary for well-modified malts, but Mr Wizard says that brewers still consider a protein rest necessary where there is 20% of more wheat in the grain bill (for clarity purposes, I guess), or to ease separate of wort in the lauter.  This doesn't make sense to me, because it seems that any proteolytic enzymes in the malted wheat (and other malts) would have been destroyed by the malting process, meaning that no protein is being affected by the protein rest. Is it correct that there are no or negligible amounts of proteolytic enzymes in modern malted grains?  Also, as far as separating wort, wouldn't a mash-out step or high-temp sparge do the same, if you bring the mash up to 170°F? "
166,Why is my wort dark?,"I recently brewed a beer with 70% pilsner malt, 28% light munich malt, and 2% chocolate malt.  I used RO water, a 1 hour rest at 156 deg, and fly sparged.  I had no means to check PH.  Beersmith calculated the color at sub 9 SRM, but the inital wort seems darker.  What did I do wrong?  or is it too soon to tell? "
167,Draining Steeping Grains,"What is the correct way to finish using steeping grains.  The recipe I was following called for rinsing the grains with a few quarts of water.  I had them all in two cloth sacks and poured the water over them above the simmering wort.  Should I be squeezing out the sacks? Or just let them drip until they stop dripping?  My beer didn't turn out as dark as expected, so I've been thinking I probably should have squeezed them out a bit more.  Do you use gloves for this type of thing since its so hot? "
168,How to get a richer body when brewing,"I brewed my first home written beer recipe in the end of last year, now I want to improve the beer. It was a simple single hops pale ale recipe, brewed in a 5L container, so it was a very small batch that I cooked for 60 min. Fermented for 3 weeks, and bottled for about 4 weeks before I opened the first one.  5L water 40g Waimea Hops (17% alpha acid) 1 kg Pale ale malt 150 g caramel malt (caraamber 60-80)   The hops was added like this  10g added 60 min prior to the end of the cook 10g added 15 min prior to the end of the cook 20g added 0 min prior to the end of the cook   During lautering, I added a small amount off water at 76 degree celsius.  I added some sugar before bottling to get carbon dioxide in it.  The beer turned out fine, it had a nice bitternes, could probably add some more hops at the beginning. But the body was not great, in my taste it was a bit ""watery"".   A beer brewing friend of mine told me that I could add some malt extract to get a richer body. Is there anything else I could do to achieve that?  What steps during the brewing process affect the body? Would I get a richer body if I didn't add any extra water during lautering? "
169,Turn Bottling Bin into a Mash Tun?,"If I attach a removable mesh filter to hold back the grains and I properly insulate the entire bottling bin, can I dual wield it as a bottler and as a mashing tun?  What benefits are there to having two separate items instead of combined one? "
170,"How to use ""natural"" Irish moss","I've just bought this stuff (pictured) - what appears to be Irish moss in its natural, dried state.  Being a bit of a noob I haven't used Irish moss before, thinking (perhaps foolishly) that my beers could be clear with it. Nope... at least, not so far. So, I bought this particular product for a couple of reasons...   For various personal reasons I like to keep my beers as ""natural"" as possible - I'd rather not start adding pig bones, fish bits, or lab-produced carrageenan. Call me weird, but I'd rather avoid anything that comes in those little white snap-top pots with unclear labelling. So, if I'm going to start using some kind of clearing agent I'd rather be using something that is as natural as possible... hence this choice of product over normal pre-prepared Irish moss. This product cost only £10 for 250g, which is at least 50% cheaper than buying it in pots.   My question is, simply and noobishly, how best do I use this? Perhaps more specifically...   Generically, how much do I use? Currently I'm doing 5 gallon batches. Do I put it in the last 15 minutes of the boil? Do I put it in as it is, or do I grind it to a powder to increase its surface area contact? Do I need to rehydrate it first? Anything else I should know?   Ta very  much!   "
171,"Define ""yeast slurry""","If I'm creating a yeast starter from previously harvested yeast I'm supposed to know how many cells are in my slurry to effectively calculate how much yeast to use in my next batch.  To me common sense suggests that a fully-settled layer in the refrigerator will be pretty consistent in the number of yeast cell per unit volume - some may not be viable, yes, but a consistent density non-the-less.  However, as far as I understand it, and according to Wyeast ([website]By my reckoning, and reading the Wyeast page, there are approximately 2 billion yeast cells per millilitre of fully-settled yeast cake. Is this not a more sensible way to gauge your slurry? "
172,Canning unfermented wort for yeast farming?,"Canning is often used to preserve foods: the microorganisms inside mason jars are killed by a boiling water bath and sealed when removed. Small amounts of unfermented wort are useful when yeast farming. Has anyone tried canning unfermented wort so that you have a small amount on hand? Specifically I'm thinking of:   Preparing the mix like a yeast starter. Say 1/2 cup of dried malt extract to half a liter of water. (Per quart jar- leaving them roughly half full.) Cap the jars with standard canning lids and bands.  Process in a boiling hot water bath for 15 minutes. (My thoughts: basically the same as boiling for 15 minutes.)  Remove from caner and let cool for 24 hours. (They should seal during this time.)   At this point you'd have jars of unfermented wort ready to use. So instead of going through the whole boiling process for a yeast starter, maybe you just sterile a flask and add in the wort and yeast.  Anyone try something like this? Thoughts or advice? "
173,Beer gas on corny keg,I have an existing keg of beer that I would like to switch to beer gas.  Is this feasible? Are there any problems with doing this? 
174,Starting out with fruit wine?,"I have never brewed, but I am playing with the thought of starting to make fruit wines. While I can get very good alcohol of other categories, fruit wines are rare, and some types are not sold here at all (e.g. orange wine).   I glanced at the process in the Wikipedia article, but it didn't go into specifics. What do I need, in terms of equipment and conditions, to produce something drinkable? My grandparents used to make grapewine in the basement, but I don't like the harsh taste, so I suppose I will need to control the conditions more tightly.   I would prefer the sweeter, more fruity versions above the fully dried ones, if this makes a difference. But I want actual fermented wine, not liqueur like triple sec.   I am not much worried about the need to get ingredients or master the process. I am accustomed to sourcing and dealing with unusual ingredients and additives for cooking, and also have no problem with measuring and tightly controlling food I am creating (measuring sugar content and temperature in candy making, measuring and adjusting pH of sauces, etc). I am more asking about the basic set of tools I will need to create a batch of wine, and also what conditions the wine needs during fermentation and aging - is the corner of the kitchen good enough, or do I need some kind of air conditioned cabinet/wine fridge? "
175,barley content in whisky from barley grains,"Of the whiskey in a barrel, what % of it is barley?    From what I understand, to make wort only 20% of spent grain is left.  This leads to a figure of 80% of the grain dissolved in the wort.  After the yeast is added, the wort is distilled, separating the alcohols and leaving stuff behind.  Seemingly the barley that has dissolved in the wort, does not get distilled and gets left behind?  What is the original ratio of water liters to kg of grain? After distillation, what % of the mixture is distilled off, and what % is left behind? What would the barley grain makeup of the whiskey mixture be, or just alcohol is distilled taking the converted barley sugars, but leaving all the ""barley juice"" behind? "
176,"Irish Ale Yeast - Strain Selection, Fermentation Temps, and Re-using Yeast","I am brewing an Irish Red Ale, followed by a Dry Irish Stout, both this week, and then I need to re-use that yeast within the following two to three weeks for an ESB (1.053 OG recipe was picked by a brewing buddy and calls for Wyeast 1084). All batches will be 2.5 gallons. The ESB recipe calls for pitching and fermentation at 70°F. For the red and the stout, I am hewing close to the BCS recipes (1.042 and 1.044 OGs) - except that I will sour 5% of the wort for the stout (and then boil and add to active fermentation.  I am considering using the same yeast strain for all three batches. I am also planning to just pitch a fresh vial or smack-pack of liquid yeast into the first batch (pitching rate is right on per Mr Malty's pitching rate calculator).  Questions:   I am going for ""dry-ness"" on all three beers. Is there a significant difference in attenuation between WLP004 and Wyeast 1084?  Brewer's Friend calculates I will get a couple more points of attenuation using Wyeast 1084. I don't have any fermentation temp control. My cellar is 62-63°F. I am thinking about putting the fermenter in a large tub of water and sticking it in a spare room where the temp fluctuates between 66°F and 70°F, hoping that internal beer temps will stay in the high 60s°F. Will this higher temp lead to production of esters inappropriate for these styles? I have heard that Irish Ale yeasts sometimes have trouble finishing. Have you experienced this? This may be subjective, but would you recommend another yeast for the stout to achieve adequate dryness? I have seen many recipes call for US-05. I am trying to figure out how to use the same yeast for all three recipes. My current thinking is to rack Batch 1 to another vessel, and then pitch Batch 2 onto the yeast cake. Do you have a better suggestion?  For Batch 3, I could leave some beer on the yeast cake and move the vessel to 20°F-45°F (garage) or 62°F (cellar), store for 1-3 weeks, and then re-warm and pitch Batch 3 onto the yeast cake. Is  Is there a more proper way to save the yeast for Batch 3 - either harvest some of the yeast cake from Batch 1 before pitching Batch 2, or wash the yeast cake  Will using the yeast for three generations cause a problem as long as the first two fermentations are strong? I have heard that three generations from low- to moderate-OG beers if OK.   Sorry for so many questions. Thanks for the help! "
177,Do I have contamination('infection')?,"Beer Kit: Brewferm TarwebierThis was my first time using StarSan as it's hard to get in my neck of woods.

I stored the StarSan for a few days after cleaning bottles, before I reused it to clean my FV, I that that was okay to do? could this be the source of the contamination, some bottles had a few little specks of mold? :(  "
178,Why Reuse Yeast?,"Sorry for seeming clueless, but I am clueless. I've only brewed about 15 batches, or less, of extract beers. Thus far, I've always bought prepackaged recipe ""kits"" similar to a Betty Croker cake mix. Since finding this site, I am seeing a lot of questions regarding washing, rinsing and reusing yeast, but I havent seen (found) a reason why you wold? Is it just economical?  Cheers! "
179,Juniper berries for brewing pale ales,"I love the aroma of Juniper and want to feature it in my next pale ale. I'm currently extract/kit brewing, and I had a few questions about how to go about this:   I read some tips about adding to secondary over at this question. Does it ever make sense to add Juniper at another time? Say during the wort boil? I'm going for a flavor roughly along the lines of Mammoth Mountain Brewing Co.'s ""IPA 395"". Does anyone know what kind of Juniper produces this flavor (there seem to be many species...) If I am starting with a pale ale recipe, should I omit hops at any point in favor of the juniper? Or do I just add both?   Thanks! "
180,How much oak cubes should I use for 5 gallon batch?,"I am planning to brew 3 batches of Imperial Stout at the same time with the same recipe.   The difference is that I will age two batches with different oak cubes (one will be soaked in bourbon, one will be plain oak) and one will be left as it is. I want to compare 3 batches at the end. Anyway...  How many oz of cubes (assuming they are 1/2"") should I use for a 5 gallon batch? How long should I keep them in the carboy, so I won't over-oak the stout (I heard that it might be an issue)?  Thanks. "
181,Reducing Bitterness level in Imperial Stout,"I am about to brew an imperial stout, and I was wondering, about bitterness level in it.   I want to create a smooth sweetish imperial stout (maybe somewhat on the same level with a milk stout), but strong in the same time.   Should I use less bitter hops to reduce IBU to 50? Should I use more specialty grains (like honey malt)? Or should I age it with oak little bit longer to add vanilla taste? Should I use a specific Yeast that are less active (WLP099 vs WLP039 vs WLP001)?  I have a feeling, that it could be a combination of all of it, but it would be interesting to hear it from somebody with experience.  Thanks. "
182,"When dry hopping, do you wait for clearing before bottling?","I'm still a beginner, this forum has helped me a great deal. I made an IPA, which cleared very well in the primary.  It was transferred to a secondary for dry hopping, adding a muslin bag with 1 oz Citra pellet hops, it's been a week and I pulled the hops, satisfied with the flavor.  I got some sediment in the bottom of the carboy, but the beer isn't as clear as it was following the primary. Should I wait to bottle or just go with it as is, carefully racking to a bottling bucket? Will any carry over sediment settle in the bottle?  Thanks for the help and patience. "
183,Can I switch keg from regular pump to kegerator,"Would it be possible for me to use a regular store bought pump to tap a keg, then untap it and place it in a kegerator with a co2 pump without the keg going flat?  Would I be able to change out the oxygen that gets put into the keg with co2, or would I be spoiling the keg much quicker because I use the regular pump? Thanks.   "
184,Make vodka with baking yeast?,Is it possible to use normal yeast from tesco (for baking) to make vodka?  I want to try making it in a 2 litre bottle since I'm space limited but could buy a 5 litre bottle in the future. How much of the yeast and how sugar would I need to add to a 2 litre bottle to make a decent amount of vodka? How much time would it take to brew and how strong would it be? Also whats the easiest way to make a DIY airlock thing?   I have absolutely no experience except from youtube videos so I could really use some hints. I want to place it in a cabinet in my desk so I'm space limited but I'm thinking of getting even eight 2 litre bottles and having a total output of 16 litres in the end depending how much vodka each bottle produces 
185,Quick advice for dry-hopping and racking to secondary,"tomorrow I'll brew an English style IPA with extract. I want to dry-hop in the conditioning phase, so, considering I'm using S04 on a small batch, I'll probably add the hops on Wednesday. It should be more than finished by then according to my experience.  Two questions:   do you think it's ok if I dry-hop in the primary? how long should I dry hop for?   Batch size is 10 liters and I was thinking of dry-hopping 15 grams of EKG.  "
186,Making pineapple beer with bakers yeast,"Its my first time ever trying to brew some sort of beer. I decided to try making a 5 litre batch of pineapple beer. I added one pineapple, 1 kg of sugar, approx 5 litres of boiled water and 14 grams of dry bakers yeast. All inside a 5 litre plastic bottle with a make shift airlock made out of pens and plastic straws. I wrapped it in a blanket to keep it nice and toasty. I added the yeast at around 30-35 degrees celsius. What kind of results should i expect and how long should i let it ferment for? Ive read that 10 days should be okay but im not sure. What kind of strength will i be looking at alcohol % wise? Ive read pineapple beer can range from 1% to 5%   If anyone is interested i can post a pic of it later and keep yous updated on how it turns out. "
187,Carbonation in bottles,"Well I've bottled my Coopers Amber Ale, about 4 weeks ago, with:   600g Malt 200g Dextrose  200g Corn Syrup Powder    In the last few days, I've noticed a few bottles (PET) have fizzed out some of the brew! Maybe half to an inch? They smell good but I've felt all the other bottles and they are so full of carbonation it feels like glass bottles! So I've cracked each just to let some of the gas out! Is that a problem? Don't know why? Beer smells ok! Im not throwing them out yet!   Any Ideas?    Additional information:   750ml bottles with 2 carbonation drops I got 3 same readings on the hydrometer (took 9 days) 23L batch  "
188,Interpreting single-infusion mash instructions with two temperatures listed,"I've been brewing all-grain for a while now, but I can't figure out why the recipes I read have the following.  Take this example:  Mash Schedule: Single Infusion, Light Body Total Grain Weight: 10.25 lb (4.7Kg) Single Infusion, Light Body Step Time Name Description Step Temp  75 min Mash In Add 12.81 qt of water at 163.7°F 152.0°F  10 min Mash Out Add 8.20 qt of water at 196.6°F 168.0°F  Sparge with 2.64 gallons 168.0°F water   Why do the Mash In and Mash Out have two different temperature readings if it's single infusion?  Did the brewer mash in at the first temp (in this case 163.7°F/73°C) to get to the second temp (152.0°F/67°C)?  This is what is seems to me, yet if that is the case I don't think mashing out at 196.6°F would get to a final temp of 168°F.  In any event, if someone could clarify this for me it would be appreciated! "
189,Correction of Tinseth's for pellets vs cones,As I understand Tinseth's formula is derived from curve fitting (as I read it from his article).   However I can't see if he's using pellets or cones and I think that the utilization differs. I expect that eventually one would get the same utilization from hops and pellets so the difference in the formula should then be in the time constant in the time factor. That would lead to a formula like:  IBU = ... (1-exp(-kt))/4.15   Should one use different value for k depending on if I use pellets or whole hops? Which one does the standard value of k=0.04 applie? Or is there a different formula for the use of pellets or whole hops? 
190,"PBW, or Oxyclean Free, that is the question","Ok so it gone like this :   Me : I red on some forums that I could save a lot of money by switching from PBW to Oxyclean Free. Do you want to go to Walmart tonight?  Him : You mean the cloth cleaner? Hum, there's no way it's food grade.  Me : I don't think PBW is neither.  Him : Well, I don't think you're right. Like dish soap, PBW must be somewhat similar in terms of food regulation. And I don't find the full chemistry compounds of Oxyclean. Also, it's a really strong stuff, it may detach some  micro particles of plastic off your bucket.     So I'm asking you guys.. is it safe or not? Should I play safe and buy that expensive pbw?   Thanks! "
191,Mashing in food-grade plastic fermentation bucket,"So I have been dabbling with the use of my sous vide immersion heater for maintaining a perfect mash temperature (it's pretty unbelievable how efficient and accurate these guys are). I have only been doing smaller batches (~3 gallons) up until now. As I have looked to go bigger I have tried to find polycarbonate food bath containers that are large enough, but without much luck. Then it hit me...my MoreBeer Buckets are food grade up to 180 degrees!  So, my plan is to mash in there and then move to two 6 gallon kettles for a split boil (working with an electric glass stove top that won't allow me to achieve a boil on a full 5+ gallons of wort).   Question is, do you think the spigots are also food grade? If not, I can always just use my bucket that does not have a hole/spigot, but it would be much easier to transfer the mashed liquid into the two kettles with the spigot vs. pouring straight from the bucket or siphoning.   Thoughts?  Thanks! "
192,Exactly how big is a ball lock keg post supposed to be,"I recently ordered a pair of used ball lock Cornelius kegs from a website. One of the posts of one of the kegs is slightly bigger than the other. In order to get the beer out line onto the keg in the first place, I needed a mallet. I could not get the out line off even with a monkey wrench and a screwdriver. I eventually chopped the ball lock connector in half with a dremel tool.  The problem post is 15.81 mm. I was able to measure 4 other posts, on my various other kegs. They measure 15.53mm, 15.63mm, 15.47mm, 15.83mm. This is about 0.3mm of difference between the biggest and smallest parts. I have never put a connector on the 15.83mm post.   For my day job, I am an engineer. When two parts are supposed to snap together, it is important to machine those parts to a precise size, or you will find yourself jamming things together and prying them apart. 0.3 mm sounds very small, but it makes a huge difference in whether two parts can fit.  On my old keg, I have always had trouble with one of the posts. I always have to fight to get connectors on and off of it. I suspect that I have an issue with an incorrectly sized post or an incorrectly sized connector.  How big is a ball lock post supposed to be? Are sticky, difficult connectors a common problem? "
193,White film at top of bottle,"After 7 days in bottle I find out a white film at the top of the beer. This film isn't in every bottle, just in 1/3 of batch.  I openned one and it's tasted good.  I need to know if it's an infection or a normal issue of bottle's fermentation.  [website]"
194,Can transporting bottles affect the outcome of the brew?,"Background  Due to the limitations of my apartment, I decided to brew at a friend's house. Once my double IPA had finished its fermentation phases, I proceeded to bottling it. Shortly afterwards, I packed them into my car and (carefully) drove home (~15 mins).  Question  Due to the jostling of the bottles during the drive, and the shifting that happened while carrying them up and down stairs, is it likely that this has significantly affected my brew?  More generically, can transportation/shifting of bottled brew affect the outcome? If so, which qualities might be affected? "
195,"Someone wants me to brew them a batch, what logistics can be used?","I have not seen anything on this subject, but recently I had a beer tasting and there were several people that wanted a batch for parties or weddings.  How do you handle the logistics with such requests?  I talked about a keg, but I do not know how to handle the gas with such a request.  I talked about bottles and I have a lot of them for beer.  What would be the best solution to provide a party of people some home brew when they are asking for it and said they would pay what ever they needed? "
196,"New England IPA - What sets it apart from a ""traditional"" IPA?","Background  I've heard a lot of buzz about the New England IPA lately. After reading this article, I've gathered that it features fruitiness, cloudiness, and somewhat creamy medium bitterness. The specific aromatics and tastes seem to be a bit at-large. Haziness also seems to be a consistent characteristic.  After having done a few West Coast IPAs (largely consisting of Cascade, Simcoe, and Centennial pellets), I haven't been able to nail down exactly which hops, yeasts, or other ingredients seem to be ""successful"" for this style. A few other pieces such as these tips and this recipe seem to be good starting places, but I'm still not entirely sold.  As Nate Reynolds of GotBeer.com mentions here, the BJCP (Beer Judge Certification Program) has not yet recognized this as a full-fledged ""style"", so there may be some degree of educated opinion rather than fact. I hope to gain some experienced insight on the New England IPA, nevertheless.    Question  What, exactly, sets the New England IPA apart from a ""traditional"" IPA or even a West Coast IPA?  Furthermore, has anyone had repeated success with this style, and would be able to share your tips/recipes? "
197,Adding peaches during the boil or during secondary?,"I'm thinking about doing a Peach IPA, recipe isn't set in stone yet. I definitely want to taste the peaches, but I don't want it to taste like someone spilled beer in an a peach juice bottle. I'm doing a one gallon batch. I'm trying to decide whether to add the peaches in the initial boil or in a secondary. Are there relative merits to each? Has anyone tried this before? "
198,Soda: Fermentation dynamics and off-flavours,"I came here not only to solve my off-flavour issue, but also to learn more about early stage of fermentation. I am making sodas (mostly Ginger Beer) which I am fermenting for carbonation. Everything went well all winter and I didn't have an issue, but suddenly, two batches in a row, I am smelling and tasting solvent like/nail polish off-flavour. According to the descriptors it seems like it could be ethyl-acetate. The recipe I am using stayed the same, I suppose this could have something to do with the dynamics of the fermentation.  My variables are following: I have a 13 Brix solution made with inverted cane sugar (its taste is part of the drink's signature) and I am pitching it with 2.5g of EC-1118 per 10 litres. What has changed is temperature. In the winter I have put the fermenter in the warmest place in the house (+/- 21 °C), now that the heating is turned off, the temperature has actually dropped to around 17 °C. The fermentation is noticeably slower. The usual 24 hours in the primary produced less froth and the finished soda is less carbonated after similar time in the bottle (i usually pasteurise after 16-20 hours of in-bottle carbonation, staying rather on the safe side)  What seems a little counterintuitive is that most discussions and resources online point to high pitching temperatures as the main culprit. Others say that actually low temperatures actually help the production of esters. One resource hinted me at the concurrence of high metabolism and low growth rate. However my current sugar content should be a piece of pie for the EC-1118, so I wouldn't think this is high SG problem.   Should I just pitch more in lower temps? Or should I avoid lower temps altogether?  I have rejected the idea of too much aeration, I doubt the yeast would respire with this much sugar. Am I missing something? Thanks for discussing, I am keen on learning more about the mechanics of the process:-) "
199,Can I 'No Chill' in sanke kegs?,"I'm trying to stop using plastic in my brewing and tought that it was a good idea to ""No Chill"" in sanke kegs (type ""S"" spear) instead of my old HDPE containers. But I dont' know if the valve will hold the negative pressure that the no chilling process create.  The valve will let the outside air come in? Or maybe the keg will knead to the inside with the vacuum? Please report your experience doing that or tell me ways to make it safe. "
200,Wyeast yeast replacements: US-05?,"it's my first question here.  I've downloaded Brewdog recipe book, and they use yeasts like Wyeast 1056 - American Ale, Wyeast 1272 - American Ale II and WLP099 Super High Gravity Ale for Imperial Stouts. Recipes: #6, #7, #21, #29, #70.  In my country I can't buy these yeasts, but I can buy Fermentis Safale and Mangrove Jacks.  I found out that Safale US-05 is a replacement for Wyeast 1056 - American Ale. Is it correct?  What is the replacement for Wyeast 1272 - American Ale II? And for WLP099 Super High Gravity Ale (I need it for Tokyo*). "
201,Flavoring Cider at bottling,"The general caution I read when I started this batch of cider was to not do flavoring during fermentation as to avoid off taste weirdness. So my cider is now fermented and I'd like to keep it dry but would like to add some flavoring. Potentially ginger.  I have carbonation drops that I plan to use for carbonation, I figure these will impart some sweetness by themselves whether I like it or not. But in terms of adding flavoring, what are my options?  To do ginger at this point my only idea is to gri her ginger and steep it like a tea to make some sort of ginger flavored water, then add some to each bottle right as I bottle. But I would guess That ginger will naturally have some sugar in it(?) so I fear that might screw things up.  This is all an experiment and a small batch but hoping someone might have some advice.  "
202,Can a bad odor from an empty fermenter be a sign of contamination?,"I'm new to the hobby and recently made my first brew,  I've used a simple plastic fermenter (25L) for primary,  and after I finished the bottling process I washed the fermenter and waited for a couple of weeks before washing it again thoroughly.  By the time I got around to the second wash a bad odor has developed and hasn't disappear completely when I finished washing.  The beer from the first brew turned out ok, I don't think it's the source of the odor, It mighty have been the water from the first wash, I used a hose behind my house.   Can this odor contaminate my wort if I'll use the same fermenter again? Will it affect the quality of the brew?  And if so, is there any way to get rid of it without ruining the Fermenter? "
203,Can I move a keg that has been lagering?,Let's say I've been lagering a keg for a good couple of months. The cold has cause all the precipitate to settle at the bottom of the keg and I've got crystal clear beer!  What happens if I move this keg to my kegerator and jostle it around a bit? Am I going to essentially lose months of lagering time because I shook it and mixed all the precipitate back into the beer? 
204,How often can I rack?,"Okay,  so I made a really sweet mead with 18 lbs clover honey, so it's pretty dark. Do you have to rack more often to try to clear meads with more honey? And also,  how often can I rack,  and how many times? I have only racked once into secondary fermenter. Thank you!  "
205,Best way to clean moldy fermentation bucket,"I've just had a major house move. During the move, I noticed my fermentation bucket had developed mold. Quite large mounds (to me anyway) of perhaps 0.25in diameter, in the corner of the base. Clearly I didn't do a good job of cleaning it last time I used it.  So far I've only rinsed with high pressure water - basically to remove the odour for the move. How should I best kill and clean this stuff ready for brewing? Is regular StarSan sufficient?  Of course chlorine bleach would really clean it but it would leave a bad taste. Perhaps something else? Or perhaps I should just replace the bucket at chalk it up to ""remember to clean the bucket properly"". "
206,Where to put sugar during recipie editing on brewersfriend?,I'm putting recipe on brewersfriend and I want to add sugar at the end of boiling.  My question is in which section should I put it?  Fermentables (as late addition) or Other Ingredients (but it won't be taken into account during calculations)? 
207,Dry-hopping creates CO2 pressure,"I'm conditioning an IPA. After 2 weeks in primary and 2 in secondary all activity had ceased.  Then I dry hopped fairly modestly - 75g or so - and 2 weeks into that the thing seems to have gone CO2 crazy.  Last night I pulled the Corny valve to equalise pressure.  Tonight the keg has enough pressure to dispense very quickly.  How can this be happening?  The gravity isn't dropping any more from a reasonable 1.012 (from ~1.050), so I don't get what's powering it.  Any ideas?! "
208,Where tanins are good in beers?,"Although tanin gives an unpleasant astringent effect in beers, in wines - also, but - it is known as antioxidant and protector against UV light. So, in beers can tanins also be welcome at least considering aging ? Or hops react to O2 and light more quickly than tanins ? "
209,Adding Apple/Caramel to Brown Ale,"Fellow home brewer here with a question. My buddies and I are looking at making an Apple Caramel Brown Ale for this fall but are having trouble agreeing on a way to add the apple and caramel.   We'd like a strong apple taste and sneaky end hit of caramel to overpower the malt. We're using DME. We don't have an official recipe just yet so we're open to suggestions!   How should we add the apple? I've read suggestions such as adding during the boil, freezing it, cooking and freezing. What do you do to get optimum apple taste? We want people to know there's apple in the beer but not have it taste like apple cider. More apple, less sugar if possible. Also, how much do we add in a 5 gal batch?   Thanks!  "
210,Yeast plate not showing single colonies,Why do my yeast plates end up looking like this?   And not this?    My yeast plate is composed of wort + agar. 
211,Racetrack or standard kegs?,"I purchased a pair of ball lock corny kegs at a garage sale recently, and they are in great shape, although they're missing the top cap.   Is there an easy way to tell whether they are standard or racetrack? Are there standard measurements available for each size, so I could measure the opening and discover it that way? "
212,Which is a better fermentation method for high gravity beers?,"I'm looking to brew a high gravity porter for christmas this year, aiming for OG 1.100.  I've browsed several questions on this site relating to high gravity beers and the tendency seems to be towards putting in all fermentables and yeast(s) right at the start of fermentation and just letting it crack on.  My question is, is this method more favourable over doing a secondary pitch of yeast along with a secondary addition of fermentables into the primary after an initial fermentation period?  My plan was to initially use enough fermentables to reach 6/7% ABV (FG equivalent) using US-05 at the low end of the fermentation temperature range, leave that to go for 3/4 days and take a gravity reading. Following on from that, I would add a second lot of boiled malt along with a high ABV tolerant yeast and allow that to ferment slowly over the next week or so, slowing upping the temperature until everything has fermented out. How does this sound? "
213,"If a beer recipe calls for secondary fermentation, should I do it even though there are drawbacks?","I just finished brewing my 3rd batch of beer (after taking 2 years off) and I started looking up the debate about secondary fermentation. I found this article which I think was explained very well by the accepted answer.   The brew that I just made has been fermenting for 3 days so far. It is a Red Hook ESB brew that I have a recipe for. The recipe says you should rack it to a secondary after 4 days. However, going off of this quote from that link,     So, the new rule of thumb: don’t rack a beer to a secondary, ever, unless you are going to conduct a secondary fermentation.""   I should not rack this ale to a secondary. Seems like almost all recipes from books say you should do a secondary. To be totally clear, I have 2 questions,   Should I rack this to a secondary? If I do not rack a beer to a secondary, how can I improve clarity?   "
214,1 Gallon Full Mash Brew,"So I have never done a full mash brew before only ever malt extract brews. But after reading this article thought I would give it a go using a 1 gallon method as oppose to a 5.   However I have a few questions.    Do I simply divide all ingredient quantities by 5 if using a 5 gallon recipe? I figured yes about malt but not too sure about hops, do I still need to use the full amount stated to impart flavour or should I divide the quantity by 5 as well? The Sparge - obviously I have never done this beforeas I have only ever done malt extract method and thus have no special equipment and don't really want to buy any right now. So using just a colander and or a sieve how would I achieve this stage successfully? I would really appreciate a fairly thorough yet simple explanation if at all possible as I am slightly confused about this stage.   Thanks a lot in advance.  "
215,A recipe for a winter version of a wheat beer?,"I brewed a great american wheat beer over the summer, and got to thinking about winter brew time.  Is there such a thing as a dark wheat beer?   I see a few recipes on brewtoad but not much. It doesnt really seem to be a ""thing"". Maybe I'm using the wrong terminology in my search? Perhaps there's something else I should consider? "
216,Cider - Process Question,"I have been making Beer and Wine for quite some time and am familiar with the processes and am pleased with my results.  I have really taking a shine to hard cider, I made a batch last year using BA-11 yeast, adding only yeast nutrient and pectin enzyme to the raw cider.  Results are excellent IMO.  My question is, I just started a 3 gallon batch in my large mouth 6 1/2 gallon primary. Usually I treat it like wine, transfer to a secondary, clear, rack, top off and then after a few months prime and bottle.   In light of this, can I treat this like beer?  That is, ferment, give it about two weeks to clear in the primary, then rack onto the priming solution and bottle, allowing it to age in the bottle for few months before consuming? All in all I'm trying to speed up the process from treating it like wine and more like a beer process.    "
217,Trub versus Lees,"What is the difference between Trub and Lees?  I've only heard about lees in regards to wine, i.e. the leftovers in the bottle. Note, Wikipedia says Lees is not only leftover grape bits, but also dead yeast.  OTH, Trub is the leftovers after a homebrew boil. I've also heard the settled yeast after bottle conditioning called trub.  Could the bottle conditioning 'trub' also be called 'lees'? Is there a technical difference? Is there an etymological difference? (I realize that last question might be better fit for the ELL or English stacks, please advise) "
218,dead space in a mash tun,"My mash tun has a good false bottom, in a stainless steel 15 gallon kettle. The false bottom sits almost two inches above the bottom the kettle.  The maker of the equipment, MoreBeer, says to measure the mash water used from the false bottom. Is this overly diluting the wort? Should the space below the false bottom be less?   "
219,Wine Thief or a simpler way to sample wort from a carboy?,"I was unable to get an O.G. sample from my first batch in the carboy (tried using a long siphon tube with my finger held over one end...), so I'm trying to buy a wine thief to take final gravity, but most seem too short for a 5 gal batch in a 6.5 gal carboy. I saw homebrewsupply.com sells a simple, $5 plastic baster. Any reason why this isn't a good solution? Or suggestions for finding a wine thief that's more than 12 inches long?  Thanks for helping a new brewer! "
220,Brewing with rice. Rice cooker vs Cereal Mash?,Instead of performing a cereal mash which can be done as so:   Mill rice Mix 10-15% malted barley to provide a fluid mash Raise temp to 158F for 30 minutes  Boil for 15-20 minutes Add to main mash   Can I instead?   Cook rice as normal in rice cooker Add to main mash   It seems to me that both steps are processes are basically the same. The rice will be gelatinized in either method because boiling is involved. In a cereal mash one of the differences is that malted barley is added to the very finely ground rice so you don't produce a very thick easily burned pudding.   I guess I might see less efficiency using a rice cooker since I haven't ground up my rice? 
221,CO2 for duvel clone - Strong Golden Ale,"What is the CO2 level for a Strong Golden Ale?  Each calculator have a different value:   3.3 - source 2.5-3.2 - source 1.9-2.4 - source 1.9 -2.4  source   It is correct if I use 160.36g of sucrose for 20 liters, 26ºc and 2.9 of CO2?  There is a risk of explode the bottle with this setup?   I read that a value higher than 8g/liter could explode, and 160.36/20 is 8.018.  Thanks "
222,I waited 48 hours to pitch and detected fermention prior to pitching,"I brewed on Monday but pitched over 48 hours later on Wednesday, because my temperature control was finicky and I wanted to wait  until the wort hit the proper temperature before pitching. Normally I would wait only 1 minute to 12 hours until pitching.  However, before I pitched, I noticed clear signs of fermentation: the white bubbly layer on top of the wort and a bubbling airlock.  I can only presume this is some form of contamination. I pitched the yeast anyway and will hope for the best.  However, I would like to know the following:  Given that my wort started fermenting before I pitched the yeast, does this imply that the beer would have been contaminated even if I had pitched earlier, that my sanitation was poor? Or, is it simply the nature of the beast that wild yeast and other stuff will get in the wort regardless of my sanitation habits, and now they have a 48 hour head start on my yeast strain?  Was it poor sanitation or is pitching 48 hours a bad idea in general? "
223,Stuck second fermentation - suphites to blame?,"I'm making a sparkling elderflower wine. It's in a 25l plastic bucket with a trap. The first fermentation went well. I racked it, added sulphites (Campden tabs), added fining, left for a couple of months. At this point the wine smelled great, but had a bitter aftertaste (not acidic), probably a bacterial effect, so I racked again and filtered, giving me a nice clear wine that tasted fine, with an alcolohol content of about 6.4%.  After reading various articles on sparkling wine making, I added more Campden tabs (a smaller amount) to ensure there were no more bacteria and left it for 2 days for it to gas out. Then I added yeast and a sugar solution for the secondary fermentation and bottled it. Now I'm finding that the fermentation is stuck - after a week, there is nothing happening in the bottles, no gas production at all. I've read that sulphites should be gone within a day or two, so it's OK to use them for sparkling wines if they are given time. I've also read that though sulphites are often used to 'kill' yeasts, they don't apparently kill them, just slow them down.  Is my second fermentation dead? Or do I just need to give it more time?  Update  As the posted answers suggested it might, this did eventually kick off and it'a been a success overall. I'm still getting a slight bitter aftertaste, so this year I'll get the sulphites in earlier to make sure I kill off any bacteria before they get a chance to take hold. "
224,Will this recipe make drinkable mead?,"I want to make mead, but lack any real equipment/skill. I have done ""wine"" and ""mead"" before, but only at the ""hooch"" level of quality and control. All I have access to is a siphon tube and ~2L plastic bottles. There is a store that sells brewing equipment, but I didn't think I cared much for clearing my wine or stopping the yeast from producing since I do not trust the products that well. This may be an argument from ignorance though so bear with me.   My idea was to:   use 12oz of honey, 1 tablespoon of cinnamon, 1/2 of orange and some orange zest. sanitize equipment(2L bottles) via antibacterial soap and/or rubbing alcohol. Let dry upside down, rinse several times. put ingredients into 2L bottle, fill 4/5ths the way full with water, shake to mix. add 1 packet of bread yeast, shake to mix. close cap until almost shut to allow for airflow for C02 out of the bottle. cover cap with rubber glove, tied at base to prevent contaminants from dust, and to allow for determination of fermentation via C02 production. wait 3 weeks, use sterilized siphon filter off from top of bottle my ""mead"", into new sterile container. Cap tight, refrigerate? enjoy????   I guess the only thing i am concerned about is caping the bottle tight after I re-bottle it, for if fermentation is still active, it could cause a bursting of the bottle. I could try and do SG readings with a hydrometer I  have, but I feel given my lack of equipment( no graduated cylinder ), exposing my product to air to test multiple times would be folly and pointless. Should I attempt to degass in any way, and if so how would I given my lack of equipment/skill? "
225,How to keep bugs away?,"I'm making cider and I dont have the space to brew inside so I'm brewing outside.  It draws a lot of attention from bugs, particularly yellow jackets.  I have it in a sealed container, so there's no risk of contamination from bugs or bacteria.    I dont want to get stung when I check on my brew, there are always at least 20 yellow jackets around my brew.  I tried moving it multiple times, but they always manage to find it.  Has anybody else experienced this problem?  How would I go about stopping the yellow jackets from swarming around the brew? "
226,How to make a mead beer/ale,"Mead (in the UK at least) seems to generally be made as a wine, typically flat around 12% ABV.  I'm interested in making more of a beer/ale type drink... carbonated, around 5% ABV, by fermenting honey (not adding honey to a regular ale). Something you can quaff a frothy pint of, basically!  Is it simply a case of dividing the amount of honey I use by a third to a half, and priming my bottles as I would to bottle-ferment an ale? Or would this come out horrible? I saw a suggestion it might taste very 'thin' and wondered what I might add as well as pure honey... maybe some treacle/molasses for instance? "
227,I boiled my PVC thermometer probe - health concerns?,I have a digital thermometer with a probe. The probe is stainless steel but the cable and probe housing are apparently made of PVC. In my last brew I just submerged the whole probe in the boiler before the grain steep and left it there until I had cooled the wort. It was a 75m boil.   It's occurred to me now that this was a really stupid idea. The thermometer still seems to be working ok but I'm worried that chemicals will have leached into the beer. Should I throw the beer out or drink it? I can't really find any useful info on whether PVC is toxic under those circumstances.  UPDATE ON THIS Thanks very much for your answers. In the end I opted to throw out this batch. I expect it would have been perfectly fine but I don't want to be sitting there with cancer in twenty years wondering about it. 
228,Does adding extra sugar to dark ales (e.g. stouts) better their flavour?,I've heard anecdotal accounts of people adding extra sugar (more than the recommended amounts) to their secondary fermentation when brewing dark ales such as stouts and porters. Apparently this can be even better if brown sugar is used. I have heard that some added up to 1Kg extra!  Have people tried this? How much can be considered the 'right' amount to add?  Thanks for your time 
229,Should I factor out sugar-to-alcohol conversion in stage 2 of a three-wort batch?,"I am planning to make a tripel with OG near 1.085. I need to make a strong starter before subjecting yeast to that kind of gravity. I have read that 1.040 is a good gravity for making a starter. So I have the following plan in mind:   Cook a 1-gallon first wort with an OG of 1.040. Pitch one Wyeast activator pack. After 24-36 hours, cook 2 more gallons of wort, cool, and add to the first gallon. After another 24-36 hours, cook, cool and add the rest of the wort to a total of 5.5 gallons, with all the remaining fermentables to bring the estimated OG to 1.085 (that's a 1.085 if all fermentables had gone into all 5.5 gallons from the start.)   My question is at stage 2. Regardless of whatever else might be wrong with this plan, should I:   be adding 2 gallons of 1.040 wort, being consistent with the 1.040 ideal for starters? Or since I am about to add it to one gallon that has already underwent some fermentation, should I add something more like 2 gallons at 1.050? That will then average out to 3 gallons at 1.040, but with some alcohol content already present?   Which choice leaves me with a healthier yeast count for stage 3? (And if my numbers are off - say I should be staring with stage 1 at only 0.5 gallon instead of 1 - I'd still like to know if in principle I should be factoring out the gravity that has already been fermented away.)  And if there is anything else wrong with this plan, don't hesitate to let me know :) The  fermentables are: 11 lb extra light LME, 1 lb specialty grains, 1 lb liquid candi sugar, and 0.5 lb maple sugar, brought up to 5.5 gallons. "
230,What amounts and times should I use to clean/sterilize my brewing equipment?,"There are actually 2 questions here. The first one is more of an opinion (although I would like to know), but the correct answer will only be awarded for the second question.  I have been researching online to find out what the best way is to clean and sanitise your equipment. From what I have gathered so far, I was going to use Oxiclean to clean my equipment, and Hydrogen Peroxide to sanitise it. These both seem to work well, are no rinse solutions, and are pretty cheap.  My first question is, are these good choices for this?  My second question is, what amount of these should I dilute them  with, and how long do I soak my things for in order to ensure they are properly clean? Should I just use warm water? "
231,Any reason not to lower a hydrometer into my secondary?,"Is there any reason not to simply lower a hydrometer into my carboy during secondary fermentation, so that I can monitor gravity just by peeking in with a flashlight?   I'm thinking about doing this with a recent tripel batch, so I don't have to disturb it multiple times by taking readings. I'll take precautions like sterilizing the hydrometer. I also think I will tie something like dental floss (sterilized) to it so that I can gently lower it in, drape the loose end over the lip wedged between the lip and the bung, and remove it safely later.  It'll sit there like an iceberg poking its head out, and I can act early if I start to feel like fermentation has stuck. Keep in mind this a beer I would like to leave in the secondary for 3-6 months.  This seems like a good idea to me, but I have lots of ""good"" ideas that turn out bad. Is there any reason you would not do something like this (either from experience or imagination)? "
232,Sour Off flavor,"Our last 4 or 5 batches have had a distinctive sour flavor to them even though each has been a completely different style (wit, brown, 2 stout, hefe).   What are the common reasons to get a sour off flavor?  Extra Info / What we have tried:   Extra sanitization, but either we are still missing it or thats not the problem we do BIAB have a consistent 64F fermenter not all done with the same yeast (but it was all dry yeast) the sour is not wanted..    We ordered new tubing, new siphon, new yeast (not dry) and just did a batch last night hoping one of those will fix it. Any advice? "
233,Wine yeast for beer?,Has anyone ever used wine yeast for a batch of beer or a beer yeast for a batch of wine? I brew beer and my neighbor makes wine and we have been toying with the idea of trying to make a batch of our respected libations with the others yeast. Thoughts? I doubt it will turn out to be my best ever. But as we all know beer making is like a big chemistry experiment and what's more fun than trying new variables?  I've got some Wyeast 3787 that a fellow brewer gave to me and so I thought that might be a decent strain for my buddy. Not sure what he was thinking of giving to me though. I think he said something about Wyeast 4783 but he has a whole mix of yeast so there's no telling. 
234,How Long Will a Keg Hold Carbonation if Disconnected from the CO2 Tank?,How long will a keg hold carbonation if it is disconnected from the CO2 tank?  Does the type of keg matter? 
235,Priming a Tap-A-Draft system,"I just got a Tap-A-Draft system ([website]The TAD came with 3 6L PET bottles.  I have 2 5 gallon batches that are ready to be bottled and I have a 3rd batch I am about to brew, so I wanted to fill 1 6L (1.5g) bottle from each batch and 12oz bottle the rest. My problem is that I can't seem to find a real source that tells me how much priming sugar to use per 1.5g bottle.  I've seen everything from '6 slightly rounded teaspoons per bottle' to '1 heaping tablespoon' to '1/3 cup per 5 gallons'.  EDIT: These 'measurements' do not make me feel good, I usually like to do my sugar by weight.  I would like to know if anybody has any experience with this.  Also, since I am only going to be putting 1.5g out of my 5g into this Tap-a-Draft bottle I normally bottle a 5g batch with 5 oz. of priming sugar.  It looks like the TAD takes much less than that to carbonate (I'm assuming because you use CO2 for the dispenser) so I will need to factor that in, if I use 5 oz. for 5g I should only be using 3.5 oz. to bottle the remaining 3.5g in my 12oz bottles.  Here are the instructions from Midwest Supplies.  They say to add 6 rounded teaspoons to each bottle directly.  Do you not need to boil the priming sugar w/ water first?  I usually do that when bottling so that I know it is disolved, then I put that in the bottling bucket and rack my beer out of the carboy onto that to make sure it is mixed well.  Will I be ok if I bottle the TAD with the same ratio of priming sugar that I use for the regular glass bottles or should I be using less priming sugar in these PET bottles meaning I would have to do 2 different mixtures? "
236,Premature Kegging - leave batch in keg or rack to carboy?,"I kegged a batch of hefeweizen on Sunday morning and force carbonated. My all-grain recipe was a combination of several that I found online, but largely an original creation. The plan was to leave the batch in primary for a week and then transfer to secondary for three weeks or so. Life circumstances prevented me from racking the beer to secondary, so it sat in primary for nearly two and half weeks. One of the weizen recipes I consulted called for a two week primary fermentation with no secondary, so I went ahead and kegged without a secondary fermentation.  Things of note:   Pitched one pouch of Wyeast 3638 Bavarian Wheat Blend in wort cooled to 64 degrees.  Fermented at a steady 68 degrees (temperature controlled by putting it in my basement, which is really steadily 68 this time of year). Fermentation was really active for 4-5 days. After that, there was no visible sign of fermentation activity, however, I did not pull a sample until beer was kegged. The beer tasted good out of the carboy after 2.5 weeks (albeit 68 degrees and flat) On Monday night, the batch was sufficiently carbonated but tasted a little green; mostly a little too sweet. Definitely drinkable and on the right track, but I probably jumped the gun a little. The gravity right before kegging was very near the expected final gravity. Expected OG 1.051, expected FG 1.014; actual OG 1.056, actual FG 1.020.    Bottom line: the beer doesn't seem finished now that I've carbonated it. Should I leave it in the pressurized keg in the fridge and condition for a few weeks to a month; or should I release pressure, let it go flat, and put it back into a carboy to finish out? "
237,Flanders Red from Brewing Classic Styles,I am interested in brewing the Flanders red that is found in Brewing Classic Styles. Jamil mentions using the Wyeast 3763 or WLP655 and leaving it sit for a year until the pellicle forms then falls back into the beer. He doesn't mention about racking the beer off of the primary yeast cake. Should you rack your beer off? Is that not the point of the sour mixes? Is it OK to let them sit for a year like that?   I'm just curious because I don't want to waste a year and find out I should have racked it over :-)  Thanks everyone for your help! 
238,Recycling/Reusing Bottles?,"Are Glass Beer Bottles safe to recycle/reuse? Since I can't know who drank out of it and what could be in it, I want to be sure that this is safe to do.  What type of disinfection reagent would I use, and would I use warm or cold water? (I think warm water - unless it's boiling - actually helps some bacteria to thrive?) "
239,cleaning copper,"Copper is great for all sorts of things, manifolds for your cooler based mashing tun, as well as that wort chiller you can't live without.  However, copper gets really dirty, really quickly, and I don't think that any of us want all of those oxides in our brew.  To date, I have been cleaning my wort chiller by soaking it in a bucket of star-san, which seems like a waste and it takes a long time to wait around for it to get nice and shiny.  Soon I will be building a copper manifold as I get into all grain brewing this summer.  So my question is, what is the best / easiest / fastest way to get these copper parts clean enough for a day of brewing?  Would it be better to trade them out for stainless components instead? "
240,Can I Use Printer Paper for Labels,"I plan to do enough brewing this summer to have more than one brew available for drinking. Therefore, I want to label my bottles.   I know about using milk for attaching labels, but I was wondering if anyone has used regular printer paper for labels? Or is it too thick to attach properly? "
241,Start a little business of hemp beer,My father started a small cultivation of hemp (~ 2 ha) for business. I would like to start to make my beer from hemp. Unfortunately i am an absolute beginner on this subject.    Which are the most delicate steps? Are there some references of this kind?  
242,Berliner Weisse questions,"I have a Berliner Weisse (1.035 O.G.) that has been fermenting on WLP630 (berliner weisse lacto blend) for about 5 days now. This is my first attempt at both a sour style beer and a starting gravity this low. My main question is about fermentation and conditioning, should I ferment like I normally would then transfer off the yeast and continue sour in a ""secondary"" and if so is there any suggestions on proper timing for original fermentation and then conditioning? Also I am considering going straight to bottle with this batch, I have bottled a couple batches a long time ago and am curios if I should do anything different bottling a sour especially one with this high of carb. My last question is about fermentation temp, I was up around 74F for a couple days before i could get it down just below 70F, should I expect any off flavor or will the sour aspect cover it? "
243,Ideas for rescuing an under-pitched and under-hopped batch,"A few batches ago, I had a ""learning experience"". I now have some pretty good ideas of where I went wrong (mainly, not having any idea how to design a recipe), but I'm wondering what I can do with a case of not-very-tasty (but not completely ruined) beer. This mess started with:   Using too much molasses (12oz jar of molasses, with 9lbs DME) Pitching a single smack-pack into a wort with OG of 1.090+ Using about half of the amount of hops I probably needed   The batch finished around 1.025, tastes way too sweet, and is not carbonating after about 6 weeks in the bottle. Things I have tried:   Warming the bottles up (it's summer in Georgia. They're not too cold) Inverting the bottles (rewarded me with a tiny hiss after a week. Still flat and sweet) Mixing with a light beer (it takes a full bottle of light lager with half bottle of my beer-syrup to make something drinkable)   I have another batch that is about ready to bottle. I was planning on pouring my remaining 36 bottles of beer-syrup into the empty fermenter (on top of this batch's yeast), and adding a gallon of heavily-hopped light (1.030) wort to try to bring the IBUs and body back in line with something resembling beer. I would let it re-ferment for a few days before re-bottling.  Does anyone think this would work? Is there something easier I can try? Should I just use this batch to cook ribs? Am I just embarrassing myself on the internet here? "
244,How does electrical conductivity of a fermenting liquid change over time?,"Has anyone ever measured how the conductivity of fermenting liquids changes over time?    I have a hypothesis that it does change over time, and that as the fermentation rates and stages change, so will the capacitance of the wort.  Also, that one will see more capacitance change during early fermentation, but it will settle down to a steady value as fermentation dies down, flocculation occurs, etc.  Why do I ask?  I would like to digitally measure fermentation activity without directly sampling to measure specific gravity.  Measuring SG would be great, but what I'm really interested in is activity level of fermentation.  I'm not trying to calculate SG - I'll do that when I transfer the batch from primary -> secondary -> bottling.  I'm thinking though that seeing that conductivity value level out is what's the signal for when to transfer.  Thoughts?  I've found online that seem to say this might be worth pursuing a bit.  For example here is a paper titled, ""Electrical conductivity as a tool for analysing fermentation processes for production of cheese starters"" [website]Another article at [website]"
245,How can I restart fermentation on a stuck strong dark belgian ale?,"What can we do to restart fermentation that got stuck over the winter?  Our club brewed about 7 gallons of this recipe in November. Primary went well, but then the weather got cold and the yeast went dormant, leaving the gravity at ~1.045. We left it until the weather got warmer this spring. When it didn't come back on it's own, we pitched several packets of dry champagne yeast. The first packet didn't seem to do anything, so we moved it to an even warmer (75ish deg) room and pitched more yeast. It's now bubbling slowly, but has only come down in gravity to 1.040 in the past week. Are there any additional things we could try to get it going again? "
246,When is it the optimal time to add flavoring?,I purchased a bottle of raspberry flavoring from a home brew store for a Lambic brew that is still in secondary. I don't believe the flavoring has any fermentables in it.  Should this flavoring be added to the secondary?  Or should I add it at bottling? 
247,What will happen if the main fermentable in a beer was mostly table sugar?,I wanted to brew a pale ale.  Long story short crushing grains for all-grain brewing has a dramatic impact on efficiency.  I went to a new homebrew store and didn't bother to check whether the grain was crushed effectively.  Turns out it wasn't and so after mashing the wort had very little sugar.  So I decided that instead of throwing the batch out I would attempt a rescue.  But I had no malt extract but I did have table sugar (not the white stuff but the organic brown cane sugar kind).  Has anyone tried this before?  I tried a taste after transferring and it tasted a bit like vodka.  Should I expect that taste to linger or will it mellow?  Here is the recipe:  [website]
248,What will be the effect of allowing fermentation temperature to drop on a nearly finished fermentation?,"I brewed this Northern Brewer saison kit and picked the Wyeast 3724 belgian saison yeast.  Only later did I discover that this yeast has a tendency to stall out.  So as a preventative measure I started fermentation pretty warm (75F) and have been slowly knotching it up over the last two weeks (now at 85F).  My gravity is now down to 1.010 or so, and, wanting to save electricity, I was just going to remove the heater and controller.  The beer would drop to 75F.  Let's presume that the next reading I take 5 days after the last reading is the same.  What would be the difference if I maintained the temperature versus letting the temperature fall to 75F (upstairs)?  or to 65F(basement)? "
249,What burner would be appropriate for a 1BBL brew system?,I'm building 1bbl brew system one question I have relates to a recommended burner  Do you think any burner would do for brewing the whole bbl? I'm inclined to get a  Bayou burners that for outdoors use: [website]. 
250,Reusing Yeast From previous Fermentation,When I finish fermentation I am left with a large amount of extra yeast in the bottom of the carboy.   Can I reuse this yeast in any way?  Hopefully to avoid buying yeast again every single batch? 
251,What is the proper method of pitching a starter?,"What's the proper method of pitching a starter? Do I just pour the whole thing in or do I need to ""harvest"" a certain portion of it?  I just started using starters (.25-.5 Gallons water + 2-4 cups Pale LME + 1 White Labs vial). I've been just dumping the whole contents of the starter (after a vigorous shake) into the primary. Is there a better / more correct way of pitching a starter? Am I risking adding off-flavors? "
252,When do I add spices to spice up a holiday brew?,"I just brewed my first oatmeal stout (the Brewer's Best kit), and decided I'd try to add a little ""holiday"" flair. At my local brewing supply store, I found a recipe for a holiday ale, so I followed the spicing directions used in that, but I wonder if there's a better way.  Here are the ingredients I used:   1 orange, with whole cloves stuck into the skin cinnamon sticks peeled ginger root   Here's what I did:  During the last 15 minutes of boiling the wort, I put all of the above in an extra grain bag I had laying around and added them to the wort. I boiled for 15 minutes before pulling the spices out.  I'm wondering if that's enough time to get the flavors from the spices. I didn't add anything to the primary fermenter. Should I additional spices when I rack it off to the secondary?   What other spices or flavors work well with holiday beers? "
253,Should a starter be hopped?,"Should I add hops to my starter recipe? I just started using starters, and I haven't been hopping them at all. I didn't even think of adding hops until I read some of the answers on this question. What are the reasons to hop or not hop a starter? "
254,Do I need to add 6-Row to my extract + grains dunkelweizen for proper conversion?,"Do I need to add some 6-Row or otherwise tweak this recipe? I'm going to be brewing a dunkelweizen later this month. My recipe uses 6 lbs. of wheat extract and 2.5 lbs. of caramel and chocolate wheat, and the yeast is Wyeast's Weihenstephaner (3068). I'm planning to steep the wheat in a mesh bag in 5 gallons of water for at 155F for 45 minutes before the boil. Looking at some all-grain recipes for dunkelweizen I see that some add 6-Row barley to help the wheat convert. Do I need to add some to my recipe or will the liquor I get from steeping + the extract ferment well enough on its own? "
255,Has anyone had experience with first wort hopping? Did you find the results worthwhile?,Has anyone seen a marked improvement in hop flavor/quality from first wort hopping (adding hops at sparge) vs. late hopping vs. dry hopping vs. a hopback? Are there specific advantages to doing so? Hints for doing so? 
256,Anyone have experience doing a decoction with a pressure cooker?,"How were the results compared to a traditional decoction? Any tricks to know about?  Edit: For some context, see here. "
257,Reusing twist-off bottles,"I've heard it said that twist-off bottles should be avoided when reusing bottles for homebrewing.  I've also heard a few people saying they've used plenty of them with no ill effects.  Given that (at least around here) twist-offs are much easier to come by in quantity, I ask:   Should twist-offs be avoided? What are their disadvantages? If one was going to use them, what steps should be taken to minimize their problems?  "
258,AHS 1% alcohol boost?,"Austin Homebrew Supllies offers an option on all it's kits:     1% Alcohol Boost:   Add 1% alcohol to your beer without compromising its flavor. Brewvint Alcohol Boost is 55% maltose/45% glucose, a very fermentable mix with little flavor contribution.   I'm curious about anyone's experiences with this.  Does it really not affect flavor?  Could I (theoretically) add several of these?  Any other drawbacks to them? "
259,Using yeast from a local brewery,"My favorite local brew-pub has a standing offer to share their yeast with homebrewers; bring in a jar &amp; they will fill it for you.  Aside from the obvious ""it's free,"" why is their yeast desirable? How does it differ from yeast I might buy at my local brewery supply store, and where did they get it from?  This question is related to this question about the effects of yeast on a recipe, but I'm also interested in:   The details of where yeast comes from How to identify a desirable yeast How to pair it with a specific recipe How strains of yeast evolve, or how to create/grow (not sure it this makes sense) a yeast that has the desired properties for your specific recipe  "
260,How to adjust alcohol content of a beer?,"I have read stories about people brewing beer with an extremely high alcohol content, and am curious about how they do it.  At a basic level, I know that alcohol is a byproduct of yeast breaking down sugars, but how can you increase the alcohol content of your brew without ruining the flavor? Virtually all of my recipes turn out around 5%-7% ABV. Is increasing that number just a matter of adding certain kinds of sugar? How does it change the flavor of the beer? "
261,Consequences of infection in a beer?,"Everyone learns during their first brewing experience that you have to carefully sanitize anything that touches your wort after the boil to avoid infection.  What happens when wort gets infected? How do you identify an infection, and what can be done about it? Can you discover it before you bottle? Does infection mean losing the batch, or can you recover from it? If you can recover, how is the flavor of the beer affected? Is infection a strong possibility if you don't sanitize, or is just paranoid beer-lovers trying to avoid the worst-case scenario: wasting good beer? "
262,What kind of paper should I use for bottle labels?,"Do I need to use heavier paper (ie, 30 lb) for labels?  Would regular printer paper work just as well? "
263,Does bottle color matter for a given beer style?,"With clear, green, and brown bottles abound (e.g., Corona, Heineken, and Yeungling respectively), is there a hard and fast rule for what color of bottle to use for a given beer style?  Also, are brown bottles a good all-around solution? "
264,Per-bottle priming tablets?,"The ""Why is our beer not carbonating?"" question mentions ""sugar tablets"".  I am aware of a product called ""prime tabs"", but as far as I can tell that product is not longer being produced.  I have used Cooper's Carbonation Drops.  They're pretty good, but I would rather find something with greater granularity.  Does anyone know of any such thing? "
265,What is a good resource for flavor contributions of different ingredients?,"For those of us who are still brewing from kits and recipes and want to branch out and try building our own flavors, what resources are there that describe the various flavors contributed by particular specialty malts and strains of hops?  For example, how would the flavor profile of an Irish Red change if I replaced the Kent Golding Hops with, say, Saaz or Cascade hops?  Or if I were to replace some of the Cara Munich malt with a Crystal malt? "
266,What's the difference between 2-row and 6-row malt?,"I know the difference has to do with how the grains grow on the stock, but I'm not completely sure what that difference is. It also seems like 2-row is more commonly used as a base malt, but I've seen some recipes that say it's ok to substitute 6-row instead.  Biologically, what's the difference between the two? In terms of brewing, what's the difference between using 2-row malt as opposed to 6-row malt as the base for a beer? "
267,How do I convert between all-grain and extract recipes?,"If I have an all-grain recipe, and I want to convert it to an extract or partial-mash recipe, the easiest way is to replace the base malt with malt extract. Conversely, converting an extract recipe to all-grain involves using a base malt in place of the extract.  Is there a specific grain-to-extract ratio when doing such conversions? If it depends on the specific type of base malt, is there a table somewhere that shows the amount of potential fermentables that are available for different malts? Something that allows me to determine ""X pounds of base malt == Y pounds of malt extract"", and vice-versa. "
268,Permanent Bottle Labels,"I'm considering making permanent labels for my bottles.  I've had a friend create a label design with a blank banner in the center.  My idea is to have the design printed on vinyl stickers and then use a Sharpie or some other marker to label the specific beer that's bottled.  In theory I should be able to clean the ink off with denatured alcohol (or similar) when I go to bottle a new batch.  Has anyone else tried something like this, or perhaps a different method?  Any recommendations on permanent/reusable bottle labels? "
269,How long does StarSan last?,I keep StarSan in a spray bottle for easier sanitizing during brew day.  How long does the StarSan last in that bottle? Is it good forever? 
270,Stuck fermentation - Should I be concerned?,"On Jan 19, I brewed what will end up being a 5 gal. batch of Nut Brown Ale.  I had decent mash efficiency and ended up at 1.046 @ 68 deg. after the boil and subsequent cool.  I then split the total of six(6) gal of wort evenly into two sanitized corneys.  The evening before I made a yeast starter with 2C water to 1/2C light DME and two packets of Safale S-04 dry Ale Yeast and left it on the stir plate with sanitized foil over the top of the flask.  I pitched this yeast split evenly between the two corneys and sealed and shook/stirred the kegs.  Then I installed my air locks which are nothing more than air in connectors with a copper tube for structure running through a vinyl tube to a regular air lock.  I have used this method once before quite successfully.  I stored these in the den with a brew belt around the middle of both kegs.  After only a few hours, I started to see reasonable activity in the air locks.  Just two days later we were hit with a cold snap that dropped the house temp to between 60 and 64.  At that point, the activity stopped completely.  It is now the 31st of Jan.  The cold snap has been over for a couple days now but the former activity has not resumed.  Should I be concerned that the fermentation is completely stalled?  Should I do something to restart it and if so, what? "
271,When and how should I add Maltodextrin,"I am brewing an imperial stout this weekend and I am planning to use 8oz of maltodextrin for 5 gallon batch.   A friend of mine had a kit last time which had a maltodextrin in it but with no instructions. Also, after googling it I didn't find a clear answer (brewers were using it during differently).   I was wondering, when should it be added? In the middle of the boil? Near or after the flame out? Should I just pour the powder in to the kettle or should I mix it with 2 cups of water like corn corn sugar before boiling?  "
272,Wit Beer I'm guessing I don't wanna store it to clear?,"Often the advice with beer is to store it somewhere cool for a while before bottling for various reasons such as taste and clearing and removing chill haze.I'm currently brewing a Wit Beer from BrewFerm and it has the generic instructions for all its beers to store the beer before bottling.I'm thinking for a wit beer, I kind of want to keep it cloudy/hazy, If I store the beer will the majority of the yeast fall out, but still remain cloudy with other particles maybe proteins still give me a haze? Or will this completely clear my wit beer? "
273,Safe to bottle IPA with higher FG than expected?,"The expected FG from my receipt was supposed to be 1014, but it has been stable at 1020 for about 3 weeks now. The wort has been on the fermentation tank for about 4 weeks, it reached 1020 after 1 week and has been stable since.  The temperature in the room was a bit lower than I first thought, but probably not too low. It has been around 18'C (65'F) all weeks.  As I smell the wort, it has a really strong smell that attacks my nose! Kind of like Ammonium bicarbonate, but not as strong.  Is it safe for me bottle this IPA now? If it is needed, the recipe is here:  [website]Edit: Already bottled it, but added a bit more sugar than first planned. Ended up with 8.5 grams per litre. Would this be okay? "
274,Yeast starter timing question,Can anyone give me a time recommendation on how long I should allow a yeast starter sit on the stir plate for before pitching?  I usually make it the night before (about 18 hours prior to pitching) but am wondering if it should go for 24 hours + ideally?  
275,What is the scientific explanation behind open fermentation leading to increased esters and yeast flavor & aroma?,"As a recent experiment, I wanted to try something that was unconventional for most homebrewers, and is widely considered to be clown-crap crazy.  I wanted to ferment a beer topless, without a lid.  I settled on ten gallons of a Belgian Dubbel, split into two batches, one went into a better bottle with bung and airlock, the other half in a bucket without a lid for the first ~48-72 hours.  For those who haven't tried this, I'd highly recommend it at least once, as it is amazing, being able to look into the beer closet/fridge and seeing the yeast snap, crackle, and pop while you look down on it during fermentation.  Due to space constraints in the keezer, I could only get one of the two on tap at a time, so I opted for the closed fermentation half first, during which time I cold crashed the other half in the lagering fridge.  The closed fermentation tasted very similar to what I would expect for a commercial Dubbel;  subdued yeast character, dark fruit, a little clove, hardly any banana, quite malty, a very calm, typical Belgian ale.  I just kegged off and drew a sample of the topless fermentation half, and the best way of describing it is: Woah!  Completely different flavor and aroma.  I get a very profound banana flavor, some clove, some dark fruit, all of it overpowers any malt flavor.  It's almost undesirable, it's so intense.  What is the scientific explanation behind open fermentation leading to more ester formation during fermentation?  I assume it has something to do with the CO2 pressure blanket over the wort, so I wonder if similar results can be seen if using a carboy with a more confined hole in lieu of a wide open a bucket.  Can anyone explain this? "
276,Kegging but without CO2 tank,"I got an annoyance issue here. I have a Cornelius keg 19lt and 15-16 liter batch of Wit-beer almost ready to go, but poorly timed.Issue is I currently don't have the CO2 regulator or Tank. Reason for this is currently I shouldn't really be dropping money to get it within the near future (2 months) and due to other commitments I can't really be spending time bottling either over the same period. I'd like to just dump the whole lot in a keg. Ideally I would like to purge the keg with CO2 before adding the beer.   Will 15ltr of beer in 19ltr tank have too much oxygen in the headspace, and spoil? If I prime and pull pin periodically could I successfully force out the oxygen from the headspace and force carb later if required, when I get some gas? Shall I store my wit-beer in a fridge for 2 months and then stir all the sediment back in, when I get some gas? Shall I just bottle the damn thing?  "
277,What ingredients would be most appropriate to prototype new flavors in a Randall?,"I'm wondering about using a Randall the Enamel Animal to experiment with flavor combinations before mixing up a whole batch.      For example, obviously the flavor of hops comes out nicely with one of these, but what other ingredients are going to work as well?  Can I experiment with things like roasted nuts, coco nibs, etc using a Randall or won't the flavors come through?    I assume that the most effective ingredients will be those that have water soluble flavor compounds (I believe most herbs fall into this category).  It would make sense that fat soluble compounds (cardamon, most spices, etc) would not work well.  I'm not sure about alcohol soluble things (tomatoes, peppers, etc).. "
278,what types of hops can be grown in india ( in rajasthan sami arid zone),I want to grow hops in Rajasthan (India).  How do I get seeds for hops in India?  Are there any companies in India that can provide me with what's necessary to grow my own? 
279,"What are the Consequences of Steeping Grains, Removing Kettle, and Finish the Brew 24 hours later?","I was half way through steeping my specialty grains (from an extract kit) when I realized that my four 6.5 gallon carboys were already in use and I forgot to purchase another one.  I decided to let the temperature get up to 160F and pull the grains out, clean off the lid to my kettle, place it on and threw the kettle in the refrigerator.  I plan on resuming my brew tomorrow, roughly 24 hours from now.  Was this the right thing to do? I called the only people I knew to see if I could purchase a carboy off them because the stores were closed, but no carboys were available.  Would it have been better to make the wort, add the hops, and boil for 60 minutes as usual, put it in an ice bath, then put it in the fridge, and boil it for a few minutes tomorrow before adding yeast?  Thanks. "
280,Steel Cut v. Flaked Oats,"Pound for pound, do steel cut oats deliver the same level of mouthfeel as flaked oats? I ask because I recently made some steel cut oats for breakfast and they seem to be much more gummy than normal flaked oats. Would I use the same amount of steel cut as flaked?  They seemed nuttier too, but that's a different question. "
281,X2 IPA force carb pressure,What is a good pressure to force carb a double IPA in a five gallon keg? Is it possible to over carb when force carbing? This is the my first time trying this method and don't want to over do it if that's possible . Thank you . 
282,Is my beer oxidized?,"I brewed a batch of bitter 5 weeks ago, simple recipe with 90 % pale malt and 10 % crystal. IBU is aout 30. I have brewed this beer before, and it was great.  Everything went perfect, up until I pitched yeast. It is a long story: re-pitched yeast harvested from primary from earlier batch (WLP002), but I pitched way too little. The fermentation did not start within 48 hours, so I repitched fresh yeast. That is to say, the wort was aerated 48 hours before the ""real yeast"" was pitched.  The fermentation then proceeded as normal.  4 weeks later, properly carbonated and all, the beer tastes bad, or ""not that great"". Definitely not infected. It is a strong yeasty taste (the beer is clear), with sawdust like notes, and the bitterness is very pronounced. All notes from caramel malt etc are gone. But to call it ""wet cardboard"" is a stretch, but then again, I have never tasted that.  Is my beer oxidized?  Edit: I have noticed that the bottles have all small bubbles on the inside of the glass. Some bottles have a very, very thin film of something oily in the air/beer interface. Could it be a beginning infection? "
283,Is Star San sanitizer worth the cost?,"I am a college student brewing in my apartment and while I am pretty dirty on occasion, when it comes to brewing beer I try to be on top of it. While I have not had a bad batch thus far, but the home brew store clerk talked me into buying Star San sanitizer (my defenses are down in the home brew store).  Star San allegedly cleans and leaves nutrients for the beer, but is it worth twice the cost of regular sanitizer?    Has anyone had any problems with a cheaper sanitizer?   Thank you for any advice. I am only on my second batch (Double IPA with motueka and mosaic hops) so any input will help. "
284,Can I reuse brewing yeast as a nutritional yeast?,"I have a budding vegan in the house.  Even after reusing yeast for brewing I send a lot of yeast to the compost bin.  Has anyone out there used the yeast as a nutritional supplement?  If so, could any of you share a recipe or a link?  Thanks. "
285,Are there dry yeasts that rival liquids for IPA's?,My HBS just raised the prices of various liquid yeasts. Are there dry yeasts that are as good for IPA's? Recommendations please &amp; should they be pitched dry or as a starter?  Thanks. 
286,Thoughts on increasing flavor of blueberry wine,"I just sampled my blueberry wine that's been aging for a couple of months now in the carboy.  A generous description would be ""light bodied.""  There's not a lot of flavor.  Alcohol, yes, but just a hint of blueberry.  Any thoughts on what one could do to increase the flavor, or is that what blueberry wine is supposed to taste like?  I plan to make a dessert wine out of it.  Will adding sugar later help the flavor? "
287,Didn't get the expected O.G,"I brewed a nano batch of single grain IPA and I don't know what I have done wrong.  Before I started, I calculated the O.G. and F.G. as shown in the picture bellow. After boiling the wort from 5.3 liters to 4.4 liters (~1 hour), I measured the O.G., and found it only to be 1.074 (pre-boil was 1.065).  The beer is in a small carboy now, so I haven't measured the F.G. yet.  Brewing process:   Heated up 4.4 liter of water to 72° Celsius (~161° Fahrenheit) Added crushed grains, the temp is now around 67° Celsius (~152° Fahrenheit) Turned off the stove and waited for an hour, but kept the temperature over 65° Celsius (~149° Fahrenheit) Started lautering with a sieve and washed the grains with warm water(around 67° Celsius), ended up with 5.3 liters of wort Started boiling the wort. After it reached boiling point, I turn down the heat the stove Still boiling a little bit for an hour while I added some hops. After the hour I got 4.4 liters of wort left. Measured the O.G. at 1.074. (used this calculator to get the right O.G. from hot wort) Cooled the wort down and racked it to the carboy &amp; added yeast   Is there anything I'm doing wrong?  Are there some common causes for not achieving an expected O.G.?   "
288,General questions about controllers,"I do 5 gallon all grain batches using a 16 gallon Bayou BK, a 10 gallon water cooler mash tun, and a burner. Eventually I'd like to upgrade my equipment to electric with either a RIMS or HERMS setup, and make some sort of automated system. I've been researching a lot on controllers, but all the information out there is still somewhat fuzzy to me in terms of what they can or cannot do.  For example:   Can BrewPi (or something similar) control the electric kettle(s)? When creating your own DIY BrewPi, why do you need a RaspberryPi and Arduino -- shouldn't the Arduino be able to act as a web server? Can I hook up a Netduino and have it do all the monitoring/controlling along with acting as web server? (I know C#/.NET) Is using a BCS overkill? What about other kinds, such as Brewtroller?   I'm thinking of starting small and using the controller to measure/control my fermentation temperature in order to understand things better. Then I want to upgrade my system to electric and have the controller regulate temperatures in the mash. Finally I would want it to control pumps/flow control. Can the BCS do this? Can Arduino/RPi?  Essentially, I'm looking for a controller FAQ and what it can do.  Update:  I setup a Raspberry Pi 3 running BrewPi connected to an Arduino that powers my mini fridge for controlling fermentation temperatures. So far so good: brewed a lager and two ales successfully, which is critical here in Southern California. The next step is a similar hardware setup for controlling mash and boil temperatures once I eventually build an electric system. "
289,Fermentation seems to be stuck at 1.022 after 2 1/2 weeks,"This my absolutely first time brewing beer.  I'm excited to try brewing my own and experimenting with flavours etc.  I bought a kit from a from a brew store which included a fermenter and everything I thought I'd need. I asked for the recipe for a Leffe Blonde.  So after careful sanitising, I mixed all of the ingredients in the fermenter together, and pitched the yeast. The wort temperature at this stage was 24C/75F. I measured the gravity then, and it was 1.052  It's pretty cold where I am in Sydney now, and after a couple of nights, the fermenter temp dropped to about 16C/61F. I ended up buying a heat pad and temperature controller to keep the fermenter temp between 19-20C/66-68F.  After 4 days the bubbling in the airlock stopped, I measured the gravity at 1.022.  I measured a week later and the gravity hasn't changed. It will now be 3 weeks on Sunday and the gravity still hasn't changed. It tastes a little like beer but quite sweet and yeasty, and it doesn't look like the yeast has flocculated and is still suspended in the wort.  What could be going on, have I somehow got a stuck fermentation? Should I just have some more patience and leave it longer? There is no Krausen on the top of the beer and it seems that the yeast in the kit was an S-33. I don't know what other information to provide...  Any help would be greatly appreciated :) "
290,Using different sugar for priming,"My brew is ready for bottling, this time I doubled the recipe and fermented two Triple Brewferm can kits. I added three cans of Lyle's golden syrup (around 1362 grams), as it gives a better taste. The total amount of the batch is around 18 litres. The OG was 1070 and the FG is now 1014, a bit higher than the predicted 1010.  Should I use the same sugar for priming? Is there a risk of ruining the batch or the taste if using a different type of sugar, i.e. granulated sugar? "
291,"First all-grain batch, probably a disaster.","I've been brewing with extract for 1 year with good results so I decided to move to all-grain brewing, with a Grainfather. Last Sunday I brewed my first beer, an APA from an AG kit, but I made two mistakes when using my new toy:  1 - I accidentally removed the filter so my wort went in the fermenter with all its trub  2 - I failed while using my counterflow chiller and wort entered the fermenter at 40-45°C (105-115 Fahrenheit). Since I don't have a fridge, it took a lot of time to cool down to proper pitching temperature, around 12 hours.  Now the beer has been fermenting for 2-3 days at the right temperature with Mangrove Jack's M44 but it is producing a weird and quite disgusting olive/vegetable smell (maybe DMS?).  I tasted it and obviously that smell/flavor is there.  What do you think? Is it too early to say anything? Can it be DMS?  Should I throw out everything if it still tastes like this when primary is finished? "
292,"My re-hydrated yeast has lost a lot of his foam, is it alive?","Today was a brew day for me, and while I was waiting for the water to boil, I re-hydrated my yeast.  Unfortunately my wort didn't cool as fast as I Hoped and my yeast starter lost all of it's foam in the meantime.  Is it dead? Can I still use the yeast some how?  "
293,"Caramunich 1, 2, and 3 vs. Munich 1, 2, and 3","From my understanding it seems Munich is a base malt whereas Caramunich is a crystal malt, and the numbering is the amount of roasting.  Is that correct?  Are Caramunich and Munich interchangeable? "
294,Making a dried yeast starter,"i only have one 10g pack of dried yeast, but want to brew 10 gallons.Can you make a starter with dried  yeast? Is it benificial to the yeast or should I just rehydrate? "
295,Specific Gravities for Kombucha,The most-recent episode of Basic Brewing Radio has got me thinking about making Kombucha.  What would be a typical OG (original gravity) and FG (final gravity) for a Kombucha? 
296,New siphon advice,"I've been using buckets, taps and hoses so far but want to start using carboys so I need a siphon. Since there are several types around, what do you suggest? I've heard that automatic ones are a bit tougher to clean, what's your experience with them?  I'd buy it here (posting the link so you can see what I can choose from): [website]"
297,Lager than life pilsner,"I was looking at a packet of ""pilsner enzyme"" (an amylase). I know what it does (chops up starch/maltodextrins to simpler sugars, I think...) but I wondered why it is called ""Pilsner enzyme""? Why would one want to add Pilsner enzyme to Pilsner type beers (or any other beer)? And how did the production of pilsner enzyme come about in the brewing industry? Refined Amylase in packets is a relatively modern invention, so how and why was it brought into use? "
298,Adding sugar late - a problem?,"using a home brew kit I followed all the initial instructions implicitly, got to the final stage of adding the dried yeast and stirred it in. 4 hours later I realised I had failed to add the sugar which I then did.  Question1: Was I too late and should I discard it all?  Question2: Even adding the sugar immediately after the yeast does it have a detrimental effect on the brewing process? "
299,Bottling after kegging,I have kegged a nut brown ale and it turned out awesome. I would like to put some of it in bottles to save it and ship to friends. Is that possible? Would I need to do anything to it before putting it in the bottle? 
300,Old Hops; Buy fresh or use leftovers?,I Have some old hops I was thinking about using in a recipe. The hops were stored in the attic/in my car/under my bed. They are a couple of years old (2 I think?) but smell alright. Do you think it's safe to use or should I just buy new? Hops were originally used to stabilize beer and I imagine are pretty robust. The hops still smell good..... 
301,What type of yeast to use for a low ABV mead?,I'm looking to experiment making a low-alcohol mead (i.e. under 8% ABV). In terms of buying a sachet of yeast I can see standard beer/cider/wine variants and obviously for brewing there are loads of special variants. But which would be most suitable for mead (and why)?  And - how critical is it? Would any standard brewing yeast work OK or are there some types which would not be recommended? 
302,cider - during and after second fermentation,"I've just started making my first batch of cider. Using the magnum cider starter kit. Here's the link for instructions so you can see what im doing..  [website]I'm onto the second stage fermentation now and a bit confused on what to do next as the instructions are a bit unclear.  I've transferred ot over into pressure keg and added the 60g of sugar, now it's saying to leave it for around five days and then 'cool to clear'.. what exactly does this mean? Will it ever stop fermenting in the keg? Can I store keg in spare fridge in garage to keep cool and ready to drink as and when I need or will this affect the cider? And can I travel with keg in the car to friends houses etc, or will this disturb segments on bottom if there is any?  Sorry to bombard you with questions but I've search high and low on forums all evening to try and find the answer to these questions  Many thanks in advance 😊  "
303,"When racking my beer, it looked like someone had poured cream in","I made my first beer from a kit and followed the instructions carefully as well as reading around. Specifically, I was very careful about cleaning and sterilisation.  I had a 2 FV setup and after 2 weeks of fermentation racked into my secondary FV when the gravity had stabilised. It all looked fine except that in the first litre or 2 being syphoned into the 2nd FV, I observed a 'creamy blob' floating on top of the beer a bit like an oil patch floating on water. It was quite white and opaque, it looked just like I'd poured a splash of cream in and it was sitting on top.  I was able to remove it with a small sieve in one piece leaving no residual bits behind and continued to rack, then primed and bottled. I've seen no obvious issues with the beer so far - it has bottle fermented and is currently conditioning. One I tested seemed OK considering it was very new, and I had no ill effects! Sadly I didn't get a photo.  I'm just wondering what this is likely to have been? A small infection? Some by-product of fermentation lurking at the bottom of the FV? Something to do with the tap on my primary FV perhaps - I used this tap to take samples and wonder if beer left in the tap could've got infected? "
304,How to approach unknown hops?,"I will have about 1kg of wild hops, gathered last week and frozen. It's wild, but probably it's genotype contains Lubelski (closely related to Saaz), Marynka (bittering hop), and who knows what else.  I want to use it. I will use it. But I wonder - what kinds / styles of beer to brew with it to have best idea about it next year? I can brew few batches with it, used differently. But what styles to brew to get most information for future use, in case I would have access to it next years? I mean, only brewing Pale Ales will give me information about it's taste and aroma, but no information about how it plays with dark malts, for example. I can't try a significant part of known styles, so which ones to try?  What styles or techniques will be most representative for ales, in respect to hops usage and effect? And will allow me to take reasonable assumptions about hop behavior in similar / related styles? "
305,Considerations for temperature control of a freezer?,"I have brewed a few dozen batches of ale, but I'd like to brew a lager and am considering low-cost equipment to purchase. I see many using a chest freezer with a temperature control device (such as described in this question and this answer), so that's what I'm considering first.   However, I'm concerned about the reliability of a freezer when ""harshly"" power-cycled by something of the style of this device. It plugs in between the outlet and the freezer, and seems to work by turning on or off the freezer by essentially ""plugging in and unplugging"" the freezer to keep the contents in the right temperature range.  On compressor-based systems (refrigerators, dehumidifiers, air conditioners, etc.) I see warnings against ""harshly"" power-cycling these type of machines: it seems to imply that plugging and unplugging the system is somehow ""bad"" for unspecified reasons, and (based on the behavior of, e.g., unplugging and re-plugging a dehumidifier) it seems that some systems have some logic to avoid frequently turning on and off the compressor.  Should I be concerned about this at all? From your experience, have you seen any reliability (or other) concerns regarding this type of power-cycling? I'm surprised that I can't find other questions about this, so perhaps I'm just over-thinking this. "
306,Primary Fermentation Only Cuased Bubbles for 2 Days,"I think the area I fermented in was too warm for my Brewers Best Weizenbier.  About 75 degrees instead of the recommended 68-72.  Bubbles were flowing though my airlock for a couple of days, but then stopped. The instructions with the kit said it'd bubble for 4-6 days. I'm assuming it's done fermenting, but afraid it did so too fast and not sure if that's a bad thing.   Advice of next steps?  Go ahead and bottle?  Reyeast? "
307,Cider original gravity is 1.11. Why is it so high?,Bought a Mangrove Jack's brewing kit and some strawberry and pear cider. The cider I bought is supposed to be 4.7% but after following the instructions exactly and checking that the hydrometer was calibrated correctly I read an OG of 1.11?? Why would my original gravity be so high and is this normal for a sweet cider? 
308,"Adding water just after fermentation has started, wait, or not worth it?",I brewed this recipe last night: [website]I don't think we added enough water and it looks like the OG is around 1.1 although the reading could be bad. The beer is already high alcohol content at 8.7%.    Would it be more dangerous then it's worth to top up the fermenter that has just started to 5.5 gallons Should I wait and add bottled water in the secondary fermentation? Just forget about it and wait to see how it turns out?  
309,"I took the airlock off for just a couple of seconds, will it ruin my wine?","My first process was crushing the fruit, putting a lid on it and letting it ferment for 3 weeks. I strained it once, added sugar and put an air lock on. Can it be strained again? What should I do? "
310,How to choose a fridge to convert to a kegerator,"I'm going to be building a kegerator pretty soon and I'm pretty sure that I am going to buy a new fridge. Now, I have 1 corny keg but in the future, I would like 4 kegs hooked up, my wife also would like a chest freezer for storage. I think I can fit 2 kegs with gas in an under the counter fridge, so I'd need 2 and also this chest freezer. I was looking in the store today at refrigerators and I have found a fridge/freezer that I think I can satisfy everyone with! I can fit 4 kegs in the top and enough room for gas and a few bottles of ale. And the wife can have the bottom section for storage. This way will save me about £100.   This is the refrigerator I am thinking of getting: [website]I have a few questions about this idea:   My beer lines will be a little longer, probably 2 meters, will this matter and importantly will it effect the beer? Can I store the gas bottle outside of the fridge? Or does the CO2 have to be chilled also? Can I cut my hole in the side of a fridge?   The benefits to having this style is cost saving and also it will take up less space (although not a massive issue)   Thanks "
311,Fixing keg lid leaks,"I have a few kegs with loose lids. That is, the lever doesn't offer a lot of resistance when you close the lid. I think the kegs are leaking CO2 from the lid. I have heard that putting pennies under the lever may help, but I had another idea. What if I bought a slightly thicker o-ring? Might this solve the leaky lid problem as well? I have a hard time getting the pennies to stay under the levers. "
312,How to tell when hops are dry enough to seal and freeze,I have a hops vine and want to harvest and dry for my son.  I understand I should harvest when they have a slight crunch but before they turn brown. I am using a dehydrator with 75-degree F setting.  my question is how do I know they are dry enough to freeze. They feel dry to touch.  Do I break them apart??  Thanks.   He enjoys brewing but is new and I want to do this but am not sure how. 
313,What sugar to use when transferring to bottle or barrel,"Doing a homebrew for the first time, bought a kit to do it with; figured it be a good student method of saving money :).  Anyway, its currently in the fermenting bin, and when it comes to transferring I plan to transfer into a barrel rather than bottles.  One of the instructions is to add about 3oz of sugar per 5 gallons, but what kind of sugar would this be? Is it more brewing sugar, or can regular sugar or a different kind be used?  Thanks "
314,"Should I use force carbonation, and how do I go about doing it?","I am relatively new to home brewing, and so far I have bottle carbonated all of my batches. However, I have been reading some about force carbonating and I would much rather do that if possible (for clarity, and time). I was checking out this article, and it seems like it should be fairly straight forward, but I do not want to get exploding bottles.  So my two questions are these,   Is there any reason I should not force carbonate my bottles? What would I need, or need to know to go this route?  "
315,Ale yeast at cold temps?,"I made a modified Oktoberfest 11 days ago.  I used an ale yeast to cut down on the time. I let it ferment at 68 degrees Fahrenheit for 4 days, then decided to put it in the fridge at 50 degrees.  I wrapped it in ice belts for 24 hours and dropped the temp to about 60 before transferring it to the fridge at 50.  It's been sitting at 50 for 6 days.  With the ale yeast, is it doing anything or am I just wasting time?  Can I move it back to 68 to 70 room temp?  Mlas "
316,"My propane burner is hard to ignite, and when it does, the flames are small","I have a Bayou Classic KAB4 propane burner, which I've had intermittent success using to bring my wort to a boil. When I hook it up to a full tank it seems to work fine, but when I use a tank that is slightly less than full, it takes several tries for me to ignite it, and when it does, the flames are extremely small - even with careful adjustments to the fuel and air intake valves, the they die quickly. Just to make sure I'm not going completely nuts, when this happens I hook the tank up to my propane grill, and lo and behold, it works perfectly with my grill.  I do notice that when my burner is hooked up to a full tank, I can hear the characteristic propane hiss when I open the valve. With a tank that's mostly full, this hiss is much more faint. (With my grill, the hiss is the same no matter how full the tank is.)  There are no leaks in the hose. I even took the burner into the homebrewing store where I bought it and the guys there couldn't find anything wrong with it. My workaround has been to swap out my propane tank for a full one every time I brew, which has been taking a steady toll on my wallet.  Not sure if this makes any difference, but I brew in an open garage with both the burner and the tank on the ground, roughly at the same elevation. I've seen other brewing setups with the burner elevated. Would elevating the burner above the tank make a difference?  Is there anything else I should check for in my burner, or do I need to modify my setup in some way so my burner will behave more consistently? "
317,"2nd batch cider started, unsure of future process","So I've just put my second batch into primary. My first batch was the magnum apple cider which was quite bland and not strong at all. Wasn't sure to what I was doing but have done a lot of ready since then, but still need further help.  Everyone seems to have different opinions of ways to doing things.  So I've used 23litres of 100% apple juice from the local lidl, added what brewing sugar I had left which took the hydrometer reading up to 1.050. And then added a 5g sachet of cider yeast.  I'm going for a sweet, sparkling cider, kind of like thatchers gold.  On my first go I used a pressure barrel, but I have a friend who owns a pub so will be getting plenty of bottles off him :)  So my questions are,    - how long do I leave in primary?   - do I have to put it in a secondary? If so how long is best?   - can i syphon to bottling bucket then bottle from primary, missing secondary   - what's the best way to backsweeten and carb cider, in a big batch or individual bottles? "
318,Lager still smelling like apples after 2 weeks fermenting,Currently got a lager kit brewing but not sure if it is ready to bottle.   The kit I have says to leave it for 10 days but I didn't seem ready then and had quite a strong apple smell to it although that seems to have got weaker since a few days ago. Should I leave it a bit longer or try warming it up a bit to get the yeast more active again?  Anyone had a similar problem? Still a bit of a newb to home brewing... 
319,"I misread a cider making kit, doubled the sugar",I missed read a cider making kit and put 3.5 kilos of sugar in it instead of 1.7? Could I turn this in to wine by adding a wine yest instead of cider yeast? Or any other advice please apart from read the correct instruction?  23L of Strawberry cider 
320,Ale yeast re pitch,"Okay so I racked this experiment into a 6 gallon glass, slowly brought it up to 68F and re pitched with Safale05.  After 24 hours, there is very little activity.  One bubble every minute.  Is it possible that fermentation completed in the four days at 68F before I dropped the temp too low?  It was down to a rate of about 6 bubbles a minutes.  I don't know much about the gravity aspect yet (only my 4th batch), and just recently purchased a hydrometer.  The reading when I transferred it into the glass 2 days ago was 1.02.  The brew has a very clean finish with good flavors.  Should I bottle?  Should I dump it?  MLAS "
321,Special considerations for primary fermentation in a carboy?,"I brewed my first batch this weekend (Scottish Ale) and have been keeping an eye on it during primary, largely out of curiosity but also first-timer's paranoia.  We added too much water before pitching (lower than expected OG, 1.026-28 vs 1.034-38, and almost no head-space) and as a result it overflowed the airlock on the first night.  Luckily we planned for some overflow and now know to use a blow-off if we're going to do primary in a carboy, or so the Internet says.  That said, I'm still not sure about a few things.  In particular, there's a dark gunk in the neck of the carboy:    After taking this picture the white layer (the krausen?) has gone away but the top, darker layer is still stuck to the top.  Is this okay?  The airlock is still releasing CO2 but much less rapidly.  Also, when we go to transfer the beer for secondary (to another carboy), will that darker layer magically be gone or will we need to scoop it out or something? "
322,Force-carbonation of unfiltered beer?,"It seems that bottle-conditioning is very standard in home-brewing.  I have found some reference to force-carbonation of beer but at a glance I assume it is really only done commercially with filtered beer.  This answer seems to contrast the methods very well but both the question and answer are a little unclear of whether force-carbonating would always be done in conjunction with filtering.  Is force-carbonation ever used by home-brewers (particularly when not filtering, if that's ever done)?  If so, why?  What effect would force-carbonating have on an unfiltered beer, particularly with live yeast still present? "
323,What micron level is good for carbon filtering your water?,"I went and built a version of this filtration system, but the only filter I could find at Home Depot was a 5 micron. The guy in that thread seems to be using a .5 micron. I have been using water coming out of a Brita pitcher (which I love the taste of), however it is very cumbersome to do it this way, which is why I wanted to do this. So I have a few questions concerning water filtration on this,   Is a 5 micron enough? Is it to much? Why does Brita not tell what micron rating their filters are? Better yet, many of the filter manufactures seem to not tell it. Either way I go, should I drop a campden tablet in for good measure?  "
324,Light Sulphur smell,"Started my first batch of Cider! YEY!Got me some nice juice from the orchard nearby. It was only pasteurized when i got it, no campden tablets or sulphites to kill the wild yeast. Started fermantation on 20.9, after 4 days i noticed some light sulphur smel, got me educated a bit and droped some raisins to feed the hungry yeasts. Temperature droped 2 deg Celsius, weather is changing to more cold one.  Q; Have this lightly sulfur smell, got me pack of nutrients will pitch it tomorrow, how long does it take for the sulfur smell to go away? Or how does it work now in this stage of fermentation?  I know that idealy i should drop some nutrients w the yeast but didnt get it on-time. "
325,Are saisons a high or a low alcohol beer?,"I just read the copy in this Northern Brewer saison kit which says ""Saisons are brewed hoppy and fairly strong in order to keep through the summer"".  I had always thought that, as a farmhouse ale, saisons are a low-alcohol beer brewed for consumption by farmhands.  Though now that I think about it, I'm not sure I've ever had a modern saison lower than 5 or 6 percent, which has me doubting the low-alcohol provenance.  Which is it?  And if it's traditionally low-alcohol, why are modern saisons not so? "
326,Degassing wine - how to proceed,"Long time brewer, first time vintner here.  Working through a winexpert Pinot Grigio kit.  Primary and secondary fermentation went off without a hitch.  Got to the stabilizing, degassing, and clarification last night.  The wine is currently in a 6 gallon glass carboy.  I added the stabilzation chemicals as the directions indicated, and stirred for the 2 minutes, as the directions indicated.  I was using a mix-stir gizmo, hooked up to an electric drill.  For these first two minutes, right or wrong (I'm beginning to think wrong), I was stirring full blast with the drill.  Lots of gas came out. I added the clarification chemicals and stirred, full blast for 2 more minutes.  A lot of gas came out again.  I did the ""puff test"" at this point, using the thief to fill a hydrometer test tube about halfway, sealed the lid with my hand, shook it, and released my hand (instructions say puff - still dissolved gas, no puff - you're good to go).  I got a puff.  At this point I was thinking that I probably aerated the wine, and may need to stir slower.  I did some research and began stirring slowly on and off over the course of the next 1.5 hours until stirring no longer produced foam the way it had earlier.  At this point, it was producing very very little foam if any.  My questions are:    Did the over-zealous mix-stirring damage the wine? If the wine is not degassed (never did the puff test again after the 1.5 hour degassing marathon), how shall I proceed?  What is a standard timeframe for letting the wine degas naturally?  I am in no rush. "
327,What's the difference between casking and kegging?,"So this is how my last beer went:  After about three weeks I threw it straight into a keg.  It didn't taste great, but I figured it was still young and just needed more time to condition.  A few weeks later I had something decent and realized that I had never force carbed it.  Over the month that that it took to drink the beer, maybe once or twice I gassed it to push out an extra glass or two when it sluggish and I was still thirsty, but the vast majority of the CO2 came from the yeast itself, not from my tank.  I called it my ""cask"" but I know it wasn't the real thing, right?  I mean, I certainly never sprang for a firkin.  But isn't that the difference between a Cask Beer and a Keg Beer - the force carbing?  So was it a cask beer?  And besides the nomenclature, is anything from the above description bad policy? "
328,How can I clear-up a cloudy cider?,"I've finished my second batch of homemade cider and I'm a little disappointed to find that it is so cloudy. There are no off flavors, I actually am enjoying it, but it's cloudy. It's not just hazy. When in a pint glass and held up to the light, you can see some motion in the haziness. For background, my ingredients were:   5 gallons of apple juice (no preservatives) champagne yeast yeast nutrient pectic enzyme potassium sorbate apple juice concentrate brown sugar   My process was:   sanitize everything (I used San Star) add juice, yeast, pectic enzyme to carboy wait 30 days using a racking cane, siphoned cider into 6 gallon bucket added juice concentrate, brown sugar and potassium sorbate bottled   So, what might I have done wrong to end up with a cloudy cider? What can I do at this point to clear it up? Filter it somehow? Decant? "
329,Using unknown loose hops,"My parents spent some time in Germany recently and brought me back a bag of loose leaf hops as a gift / memento.  Here's the package. All I know is what's on it:    According to Google Translate, the label just says ""Hop Blossoms"" and something about the dose being 1 tea-spoon per cup. I have no idea what they are intended for, but it seems like maybe tea?  Anyway, I thought it would be fun to add them to my next batch of German style beer. I only have 25 grams (0.88 oz), so this is not going to be the entire hop quantity for a batch. However, I have a few concerns:  My concerns:   I have no idea what kind of hops these are. Does it matter or should I just chuck them in the boil? Will improper storage of hops cause them to impart off-flavors? Or will the just be less potent? I put them in the freezer, but obviously the bag is not vacuum sealed, and they were at room temperature for who knows how long. Is there any other possible concern? Is this possibly some translation issue and these aren't even the same kind of hops that are used for beer?  "
330,I moved a Kolsch to secondary after 4 days. Should I repitch yeast?,"This is my first batch ever, a Kolsch from a kit. It fermented like crazy the first 2 days, but after 4 had stopped bubbling, so I moved it to a secondary container. As I was transferring, I noticed a thick layer of lumpy light-tan sediment at the bottom of the primary, which I did not transfer. Is this where most of the yeast was? I'm now worried that there might not be enough yeast in the secondary to complete a proper amount of fermentation.  Also complicating matters is that a friend advised that I didn't need to take the OG reading.  So should I add more yeast into this secondary container? "
331,My first homebrew has a very low alcohol content,"I just finished my first homebrew (yay!), but my hydrometer is reading a very low alcohol content. I brewed an Edme bitter (pre-made wort and I bought the malt extract) and it tastes great, but it's only reading about 1% alcohol content. I have a floating-style hydrometer that came with my brewing kit.  I basically had it in the primary for about 5 days, then in the carboy for another 11-12 days. Then I added my corn dextrose (I believe that's what its called) for carbonation and bottled it in PET bottles. I left it in the bottle about 2 weeks and just started drinking it now.  What did I do wrong to have such a low alcohol content? Did I not leave it to ferment long enough? "
332,Lagering in plastic carboy vs glass,"I use plastic PET carboys (""Better Bottle"" brand) for fermentation, mainly because they're cheaper, lighter, and safer. I use only chemicals to clean them (no brushes), so I'm not too worried about scratching.  However, I'm getting ready for my first lager and wonder if I should get a glass carboy, since the beer will be sitting in it for much longer and I don't want too much oxygen getting in. I've heard that PET bottles have pretty low oxygen permeability (compared to a plastic bucket, say), but it's probably higher than glass.  So is it worth it to get a glass carboy? Or is my airlock / stopper going to let in way more oxygen comparatively, and it doesn't really matter what the carboy is made of? "
333,What amount of taste customization can I do with pre-prepared wort (from a kit)?,"I really enjoy bitter beers, and would really like to add hops to my next brew. However, I've only done one homebrew so far and it was using a pre-made kit (I used the Edme Bitter wort and malt extract). I don't think I'm ready (or, I should say, I wouldn't know how) to make my own wort and malt extract. Is it possible to add hops to my wort before I put it in my primary? When should I add them? And how much? "
334,Can an under-target and under-volume wort be fixed by adding more wort of higher gravity?,"Here's the situation: today I brewed a Kölsch style ale, and I encountered two problems:   The mash wasn't very efficient: 60% instead of 70%. OG 1.038 instead of 1.045. It came in under-volume: 4.5gal instead of 5.5gal. I forgot to factor loss from the hops soaking up wort.   My plan to fix both problems is that tomorrow I will brew 1gal of 1.076 wort and add it to the fermenter to gain back both volume and gravity.  Questions:   Does this plan sound reasonable? Any drawbacks or pitfalls you can think of? Have I done the math right? Do I need to include hops in the new wort addition? I am unsure if the hop utilization of the original wort is sufficient for the full 5.5gal volume or if I need to factor hops into the addition. The wort as-is tastes a little on the bitter side for a Kôlsch, but I've never done a Kölsch before so maybe that's normal at this stage.  Am I over thinking this? Is there an easier way?   Worth noting that I haven't yet pitched the yeast. The wort and the 1q yeast starter (Wyeast 2565 Kölsch; 1/2 cup pils DME; 48 hours on it) are sitting in the ferm chamber at 60F. I assume that no significant problems will be created by letting the wort sit overnight.  The recipe is pretty simple: 8lb pils, 1lb Vienna, .5lb wheat malt; mash @ 149F 60min; boil 60 min; Hallertau 1.75oz @ 60 and .25oz @ 10. Target 1.045/1.011. Ferm @ 60F until complete, then lager for 2-4 weeks. "
335,Ideal fermentation temperature,"I'm just finishing up a DIY fermentation chamber made from a chest freezer, reptile tank heater, and a temperature controller.  Now I just need to figure out what temperature to set!  Most yeast packets have a range of temperature listed. E.g.:   Wyeast strains all have different ranges: generally 10-15 ˚F wide. Safale yeasts have a large range: 59 ˚F to 75 ˚F.   How do I know what to use for a fermentation temperature? Should I attempt to hit the middle of the recommended range? Or does it depend on the recipe? "
336,Did I correctly add fruit flavour to my beer?,"On a whim, I decided to make a raspberry flavoured IPA. I bought a pre-made wort and some liquid malt extract.   Basically, I boiled about 1.5L of water with some raspberries in one of those hop mesh socks. The water got some nice color and a nice smell. Then I added another 0.5L of water and the wort. I mixed the whole thing for about 2 minutes, then I added the liquid malt extract. After a little more mixing I added the mixture to my primary fermenter (pail) and filled it to the top with cold water.  It's currently sitting at 26.5C (a little warm but still within the range given by the wort's instructions). My OG reading was 1.035.  My big issue with this though is the raspberries, did I add them at the right time? Should I have added more? Should I also add some during secondary fermentation? "
337,How do I un-stuck a mead's fermentation?,"Some relevant facts:   18 pounds of Trader Joe's Mesquite honey, water to 5 gallons, yeast nutrient and energizer (I think it was 1 teaspoon of each, but a computer failure ate my notes). Yeast: Wyeast Sweet Mead Smack pack (that was fully swollen). yeast pitched End of November 2011. OG: 1.111 Transferred to secondary after fermentation calmed down, Beginning of January 2012, SG of 1.085 Life got busy, but didn't notice any further fermentation activity, transferred to new carboy in June 2012, gravity still 1.085.   I realize that I've been lucky and have not had any bad batches thusfar (other than from obvious brewer error), but I think my fermentation is stuck.  I have no clue how to revive a stuck fermentation, how do I proceed?  EDIT:  Tested pH and I think it was below 3.2.  The color was closest to 3.2 but did not match either 2.8, 3.2, or 3.6.  I figure I have a pH of either 3.4 or 3.0, but my gut tells me from looking at the color chips and comparing to the color or my test paper that it's 3.0.  So, either my pH is on the bottom end of acceptable, or is too acidic to ferment.  How do I raise the pH?  Do I pitch another package of yeast (since it's been almost 7 months since pitching the first time)?  Do I add more nutrient/energizer? "
338,My yeast isn't floating at the top of my mead,"I just made my first ever batch of mead. I used a stronger yeast (a wine yeast) and the package said to let it sit for about 15 minutes in 50ml of warm water. I did that and added the water and yeast mixture to my fermenter which already had the must (correct terminology?) in it. However, the yeast did not just float at the top like it usually does when used dry, instead some was suspended in the must and some even ended up at the bottom.  Will the yeast float back up in a couple days? Will my fermentation be off? Is this batch ruined? "
339,Chilling with top-off water,"I'm currently extract brewing. I have a large (~8 gal) pot and a good burner, so I've got the capability to brew full-wort.    However, I find that chilling 4-5 gallons in an ice bath is very difficult (i.e. takes forever!) As I'm not ready to invest in a proper chilling solution yet, I was wondering if it would be better to brew smaller (say ~3 gal) worts and then make up the extra 2 gal with very cold water.    I've heard this technique mentioned, but I don't understand the details. What affect might it have on the beer? Can cold water be used to induce cold break? "
340,Measuring yeast activity by collecting CO2,"I've been thinking about ways to measure the progress of the primary fermentation, looking for an alternative to taking samples and measuring the gravity.  I was wondering if anyone has tried to predict the amount of alcohol produced by capturing the CO2 and measuring its volume?   It seems like this should be simple to achieve, you'd just need to run a tube from the primary into a graduated cylinder/bottle submerged in water. As the CO2 enters the bottle, water is forced out, and you can measure the volume easily. It should be possible to calculate the amount of alcohol that has been produced given the volume of CO2 that's been released.  Anyone tried this? "
341,Why does the temperature of bottle conditioning determine the amount of priming sugar?,"When using CO2 calculators or the nomograph on Palmer's site we see that depending on the temperature of your beer, you use a different amount of priming sugar in order to get the same effective carbonation.  Why would temperature effect the amount of CO2?  My (incorrect) logic goes like this:  You put ""X"" number of yeast cells into a bottle with ""Y"" amount of food.  When the yeast are done, you have ""Z"" CO2.  So if you do two bottles, both with X and Y counts, and one bottle is warmer, then all of the food might get consumed sooner (presuming both temperatures are keeping the yeast happy), and you get Z CO2.  But the cooler bottle, once all the food is gone, should also have Z CO2, not Z plus something.  So what is going on that changes the food to CO2 ratio when temperature changes? "
342,What flavors come from fermenting S-04 on the warm side?,"I brewed this 1064 OG recipe and used my reverse flow chiller to get it down to 74F (could have gone cooler, but my starter was at 76F or so).  It fermented like nuts (over 1.5 gallons of krausen before I got the fermcap-s on it).  The air temperature in the room the fermenter was in was about 70 or so, but my sensor indicated the beer got up to 77F.  It's now sitting at a more comfortable 68F, but for the first 24 hours, the temperature was out of control due to (I presume) the heat of the massive fermentation.  Now that the excitement has died down (as well as most of the fermentation activity), what can I expect from this beer, flavor-wise?  Does anyone have any experience with a S-04 or WLP007 or similar Engish ale yeast having it's initial flurry of activity just above the temperature range for the yeast? "
343,Holding a glass carboy by its neck,"Is it safe to carry a filled glass carboy by its neck, using one of these carboy handles?    The weight of the glass + beer, combined with the brittleness of glass, makes me nervous (compared to a PET carboy, which is a more elastic material). Is it possible for the neck of the carboy to fail this way? "
344,When to remove hops and other bittering/aroma agents?,"On brew day, when is the appropriate time to remove the hops and other bittering/aroma agents from the wort? Is it at flameout, or is it once the wort has been fully cooled and is ready for the primary fermenter?   In my case specifically, I am curious about an addition of orange peel at 1 minute left in the boil of a witbier. I didn't feel like it had quite enough time to fully do it's job when I removed all the bags at flameout.   Will leaving them in during the wort cooling result in any off flavors or aromas? Or is this actually what it needs to fully serve its late addition purpose? "
345,Does a given pressure and temperature determine the number of volumes of CO2?,"I have seen ""force carbonation tables"" used by folks who use keg systems.  They apply the tables to getting CO2 forced into a beer, and have an ending number of CO2 volumes in mind, then set the regulator to a certain pressure.  But is it valid to measure temperature and pressure and derive how many volumes of CO2 are in a bottle of beer?    Going from primary to secondary I had a little too much to fit into the secondary, so I put it in this 3 liter bottle to get an early taste.  I squeezed out all the air, put some CO2 on top of it and shook it for a minute or more.  I let it sit in the fridge for a few hours, shook it again.  Then afer another hour, I did this measurement (53F and 22.5 PSI).  Does is this tell me that this beer has about 2.7 (or so) volumes CO2? "
346,What is the purpose of boiling wort?,"Theoretical question here.  What happens when wort is boiled? Why do we do it? Why is the process not done at cooler temperatures?  My limited understanding, with some assistance from this post and this post, is:   Pasteurization Maillard reactions, Melanoidin formation, possibly some caramelization Isomerization of hop acids   But I'm not confident that's the whole story. I know why #1 is important, I can guess at why #2 is important, and I assume #3 is important because all homebrewing instructions tell you to do it.  The genesis of my question is the discovery of this little beastie: [website](I have no intention of buying one. It's just an item of curiosity.)  The kits they sell include LME (presumably pre-hopped) and DME, with dry yeast. The instructional video on the home page show the procedure as putting hot-but-not-boiling water in the machine and then adding the extract and the yeast right on top of it before closing the lid. No boiling of the malts at all. That generates the question: why is wort boiled?  One would presume that these extract kits are pasteurized, removing that part of the boil equation. Digging further in the web site reveals recommendations for doing partial mash; steeping specialty grains and hops (in separate pots) before adding to the machine. There's even a reference to all-grain brewing, assumedly a mash conducted before adding wort to the machine, which led me to the conclusion that the WilliamsWarn is not a brewing machine per se, but rather an automated fermenter with integrated carbonation and serving. But I digress.  So what is the difference in procedure between a normal homebrew process and this machine which allows them to get away without a boil? What purpose does the boil serve us?  Hard facts, assumptions, and wild speculation welcome. "
347,How to cope with stale/chewy grain?,"Context:  I bought a lot of grain in bulk, and have been going through it slower than expected. I stored it all in mouse-proof (but not airtight) containers. I ate a pinch of it the other day, and it was much less crunchy than it was upon purchase. It still tastes fine, and it isn't soft/over-moist, but the maritime climate here (Boston) seems to be reducing its crispness.  Question:  How should I cope with this? Will this cause problems for beers which I brew using these grains? Are there any general adjustments I should make to my process when brewing with older, less-crisp grain? Is this grain a lost cause (please, please let the answer be 'no')?  EDIT: my grain is est. 6 months old.   Cheers! "
348,Why add a tee next to the pump?,"I've seen it recommended in several places to add a tee in the pipe next to the pump used for transferring hot wort. What is the point of this / what benefits do you get? Does the tee go on the input or output side of the pump? This is the pump I'm using, and my current setup has tubing from the ball valve on the kettle directly to the input of the pump, then a ball valve on the output side of the pump, then tubing to the chiller. "
349,How much weight to add to a dry-hop bag?,"It sounds like the best place for the bag of hops should be somewhere in the middle on the carboy (or other container). This will mean that no hops are sitting only half in beer which should increase the saturation of the hops while not dragging the bag all the way down to the bottom so it's sitting in the trub. ref: Is it important to weigh down a hop bag for dry-hopping?  I've heard many examples of objects to use as a weight, but is there a calculation for how much weight you would need to just counter the buoyancy of the hops? Or another method to accomplish the same task? "
350,Aerating bottled apple juice for cider,"I understand that disolved oxygen is good for yeast, and aeration is done near the time of pitching in beer making.  Does this rule hold true for bottled apple juice as it does for wort? Would apple juice be more prone to becoming stale with aeration than wort, or is it best to completely aerate juice as you would wort?  Edit: The juice I'm talking about would be pasturized, not fresh juice squeezed in the orchard. "
351,Gas line : does it need to be sterilized?,"I'm reading websites and I'm viewing videos where people show how to wash kegs, but they never wash their gas line. I was wondering if it's necessary to do so?  I'm asking this because I would like to use the same gas line for my keg full of beer, and sometimes use it to produce sparkling water (which doesn't required the same PSI). So, do I need to wash it every time I want to reconnect it to the keg? "
352,How long can I let my fermentation go in the original bucket?,"I'm brewing a Belgian Tripel. I don't typically use a secondary fermentation. The Tripel however, is my biggest beer so far, and requires much more time. Should I transfer to a secondary?  All I have at the moment are buckets, but I'm considering a carboy purchase. Would that be necessary? "
353,What size keg to get for 23L brews?,"I'm thinking about investing in a keg, etc. done some reading but still have a lot of questions. I currently bottle from brew cans which fill the fermenter to 23L and comes out to about 30x 750ml bottles (22.5L).  I have seen many different size kegs. Does it matter the size? Do you need to leave space in the keg for gas/air or is this bad?  For example I saw a 30L keg for sale 2nd hand. Could I brew 22.5L in this 30L keg?  Also saw 18L kegs - if I got two of these kegs could I fill each with 11L? If I got one could I fill it to the brim (18L) and bottle the remaining few litres? "
354,What is Fermcap-S and what does it do?,"Lately I've been doing some very large boils -- 7 gallons in a 7.5 gallon kettle. To prevent boilovers, I've been using Fermcap-s. It's great, and I've had no boilover problems, but I have no idea how Fermcap works or what's in it. What is this stuff? Other than preventing boilover and excessive kreusen, does it have any effect on my beer? "
355,How can I bottle using corks?,"After downing a bottle of Saison Dupont last night and wishing to re-use the bottle, I wondered if any home brewers have ""capped"" their brews using corks?  The bottle looks like it might be re-usable with regular caps, but using corks is a nice flourish.  Corking could mean potentially re-using champagne bottles too.  Has anyone tried corking their brews?  What's involved? "
356,What is skunking?,"Doing a bit of reading about the effect light can have during fermentation &amp; came across the term 'skunking'.  What is skunking?  What happens to the beer and how do you know if you've skunked a batch?  Other questions address how it occurs &amp; how to prevent it, I'm just not sure what it actually is. "
357,Does a single FermCap addition control both boilovers and blowoffs?,"I love FermCap for controlling boilovers. I add a few drops (less than recommended) as the wort comes up to boiling. It allows me to do other things during the boil to shorten my brew day.  Here's what I'm wondering:  The directions say to add a drop per gallon at the ""start of fermentation"". Does my boil addition count for that? Can I just add the recommended amount for my final volume to the boil and trust that all of it will make it into the fermenter? "
358,Malted or Flaked Rye?,"I'm wanting to make an American Rye Beer, and I'm wondering which sort of rye I should use.   My LHBS carries flaked rye, and the nearby big-box brew supplier carries both flaked and malted rye.     The grist is basically going to be 50% 2-row and 50% rye.   I have a grain crusher and usually brew all-grain batches.  Does it matter what form the rye comes in?   Are there any advantages to one over the other if I'm going to be mashing anyway? "
359,Brewing at Altitude,"How does high altitude affect brewing chemistry? Up here in Denver (5280') or even higher in the mountains (some towns in Colorado are 9000' and higher), water does different things. In Denver, water boils at around 202˚F (~94.4˚C).   How do these atmospheric changes affect things like hop utilization, mash temperature, etc? "
360,Help with Hop Analysis,"I'll try this again. If you grow your own hops, would you pay to have them analyzed? If you have had your hops analyzed, did the analysis help you in subsequent brewing? Was it worth the cost (e.g. how expensive was it, what is a reasonable cost per sample, and would you do it again)?   BTW -  thanks for the editing suggestion, theraccoonbrew :-) I'm not marketing, have honest questions about whether there is a decent level of interest in this and what those who have had it done have experienced. Not certain where a better forum to ask this is, but would certainly appreciate suggestions where to ask if you don't think it belongs here at Homebrewing. "
361,hop back and hot side aeration,"I was thinking of putting a hop back in line with my whirlpool chilling process.  (Pumping hot wort out of the kettle through a hop back and back into the kettle with an immersion chiller running in the kettle).  Should I be concerned with that first blast of hot wort going into the hop back and getting oxidized by the air trapped in the hops?  Maybe it would be best to chill some first, then go through the hop back.  But then I'd be worried about contamination and maybe poorer aroma extraction with the cooler wort.  Thoughts/solutions? "
362,Any way to remove painted on labels?,Is there any way to remove the labels that appear to be painted on to bottles?  Specific example would be the Rogue 22oz. bottles?  I would like to remove these labels to get a clean bottle to put into my rotation.  PS. If this is not an appropriate question for this group I'll remove it. 
363,How long do I roast chocolate nibs to use in cider?,"Read several posts about chocolate stouts and it seems that using nibs as a secondary flavoring without adding to the boil is the consensus. Roasting them first has been suggested, as well as soaking them in vodka. My question is how long should I roast them and at what temperature? What I have are cracked nibs from a chocolatier here in Seattle, do they need to be soaked in vodka? Thanks in advance. "
364,What is the shelf life of canned LME?,I have a buddy that has a Mr. Beer kit he said he is never going to use (It is about 3 years old).  I mostly want it for the P.E.T. bottles but was wondering:  Depending on what ingredients are in the kit would it be ok to try and use some of them? Or would I just be risking a bad batch of beer? 
365,What is the difference between yeast nutrient and yeast accelerator?,"I know what yeast nutrient is, but was browsing around the brew supply and noticed yeast accelerator. Anyone know that the REAL difference (if any) is chemically? See it mentioned through a goggle search, but not certain what it actually does. Does it shorten the fermentation time by enhancing the yeast metabolism rate? Are there downsides if this is the case? Thanks. "
366,are sub-litre starters viable?,"So I was having a discussion about starters with someone, after reading NB's Yeast Pitching Rates document.  In which, I read that, with a stir plate, and considering a two stage propogation, I could get 453B cells with two .5 litre stages.  However, It was brought to my attention that in Jamil's yeast book, he argues that sub-litre starters are pointless.  How can I reconcile this?  Which resource is right? "
367,Dry Hop Filtering and bottling,"This is my first attempt at dry hopping.  I added hop pellets directly into the secondary fermenter.  They have been in for 1 week and many have settled to the bottom, however there is quite a bit still floating and in suspension.  It does not seem like they are settling out any more.  The amount floating seems to have stayed consistent over the last 2 days.  I'm considering tying a sanitized muslin bag to the end of the racking cane when I transfer to the bottling bucket, in order to filter out the excess hop film and floating sediment.  Here's my question:  Will filtering through the muslin bag reduce the amount of yeast in the beer I am bottling, preventing carbonation in the bottle?  Or is the standard muslin bag coarse enough to let sufficient amounts of yeast through?  Thanks in advance, Bob    Thanks guys for the helpful info.  I just bottled tonight using the muslin bag filter to transfer from the secondary to the bottling bucket &amp; it worked great.  It kept all of the remaining floating particles from transfering to the bucket.  Thanks again Bob M. "
368,How to Burtonize my water,"I am participating in the AHA Big Brew day and the beer we'll be making is their English IPA part of this recipe requires modifying my water to be like Burton on the Trent water.  Calcium (Ca) - 268 ppm Magnesium (Mg) - 62 ppm Sodium (Na) - 30 ppm Sulfate (SO4) - 638 ppm Chloride (Cl) - 36 ppm biCarbonate (HCO3) - 141 ppm pH - 8.33    I've looked up my water (Winnipeg, MB [PDF]) and it has  Calcium (Ca) - 21.4 ppm Magnesium (Mg) - 6 ppm Sodium (Na) - 2 ppm Sulfate (SO4) - ??? ppm Chloride (Cl) - 5? ppm biCarbonate (HCO3) - ??? ppm pH - 7.48    I've never done this before, and I sucked at high school chemistry so I'm slightly nervous about modifying my water, but I'd love to start trying it.  So, how do I burtonize my water? What are the required materials? How do I determine how much/little to add? Anything else I should know? "
369,"36 hours after pitching straight from the vial, no signs of fermentation, what now?","After pitching noticed yeast was one month past 'best date' (thanks local homebrew shop).No perceptible activity at +36 hours. No krausen, airlock isn’t bubbling wort looks the same as when i poured it in. What are my best options at this point?    wait and see? make a starter from viable yeast and hope my wort doesn't get infected while it sits at 65? 2a. does the yeast have to match what its already in there? I'm not terribly concerned about hitting a particular style. toss the batch and start over once i have a proper starter?   Thanks.   additional info: yeast kept at 70 degrees or less for 3 hours after leaving brew shop. wort was 75 when pitched. areated by shaking for 5 mins. 2.5 gallons in a 6.5 fermenter = lots of sloshing around.  UPDATE: checked the gravity, and it is definitely fermenting. i'm still very inexperienced, but i have proven to myself that the only way to definitively check fermentation is through the hydrometer.  "
370,recapping my bottles? Will it ruin the outcome of my beer?,I bottled my first batch of homebrew and didnt fill the bottles all the way. So the next day I opened the bottles and poured some more beer into them and recapped them.. I this going to mess up the whole entire batch or am I ok? Now there is about a 1-2 in of air space in the bottles. Just didnt have enough beer in the bottles and didnt want them to explode all over.. Just wanting to know if it will still carbonate after doing that? 
371,How long can yeast be stored?,"If I buy a tube of liquid yeast from my local homebrew store and throw it in the fridge, how long before it's no good?  How 'bout dry yeast? "
372,How much does a full boil affect things?,"I've seen a few threads here and there saying that one thing to do as soon as possible is start doing a full boil (5 gallons in the boil instead of ~3 in the boil with ~2 of water added later).  For reference, I'm considering this in the context of extract brewing.  So, I'm curious- what's your opinion?  If you went to full boils, was it a significant improvement?  Was it worth the cost of a bigger pot and heating method? "
373,How can I maximize dry hops aroma?,"I recently made an IPA. I put an ounce of Cascade pellets in the secondary (for a 23-litre [6-U.S.-gallon] batch), but there is hardly any hops aroma in the finished product. By the end of the two weeks, the hops had all sunk to the bottom, so I know they were exposed to the beer and not just floating. Is an ounce not enough? Is there some other way this could have failed? I trust my LHBS and would assume that they sold me fresh, properly-stored ingredients.  I was using Danstar Nottingham yeast, which is highly-flocculating. Could that have pulled the dry hops out of the wort and deposited it in the trub during the secondary phase? "
374,Why is our Original Gravity low?,When brewing from an extract kit we always seem to be low in the Original Gravity department. It's usually not a lot -- something like 1.055 instead of 1.060. What might be causing this to happen? Is there anything we can do to check and adjust before the fermentation begins? 
375,I want to make a Rauchbier. How do I go about smoking my grain?,"I've never made a Rauchbier before. I have some pear wood that I've been curing for about 5 months now and would like to use. I've got an all-grain setup, but no smoker; I suppose I'll need to get one. I was thinking about an electric smoker because I've heard they are much more efficient than a charcoal smoker. Any dramatic differences?  As far as the process of smoking is concerned, would I just chip the wood, drop it in the smoker, and put the grain on a screen?  Is that the right process? How long should I smoke it for? Are there any tried and true guidelines? If I smoke it ""to taste,"" should I try to get the smoke flavor greater/less/equal to the flavor I want the beer to taste like? "
376,How do you sparge small amounts of grain in a partial mash recipe?,"For less than around 2 pounds of milled grain in a nylon bag, do you need an elaborate sparging process?  Do you need much of the equipment for an all-grain setup, or can you basically just soak the grain in fresh water for a few minutes and then add that to the boil? "
377,What material should I make my brew paddle with?,"I've been using the cheap plastic spoon that you'll typically find at your local homebrew store. It's pretty terrible when it comes to agitating my mash tun. Heat + Resistance = Bent plastic spoon.  I've been thinking about making my own wood paddle. I probably shouldn't laminate wood together, leeched glue compounds probably aren't the best for your health. So, I was thinking about just buying a piece of oak and using a router or jigsaw to shape it. What type of wood should I use? Do I need to go to a specialty lumber store? I've considered just going to Lowe's or Home Depot and picking up some cedar. Is all that stuff chemically treated?  Am I better off just buying a small marine paddle and sanding it? Or are there wood treatment concerns there as well? "
378,What does Irish Moss do?,"I've heard that it helps clear the beer, but how does it do that, and how is it used?  Further, are there any tradeoffs associated with using it? "
379,How do I make a Yeast Starter?,"I know I should be using a Yeast Starter so that I can make sure I have enough, healthy yeast, but I've never managed to go around to it.  How would I start a yeast starter? How long before brewday should I start?  "
380,How Does a Hydrometer Work?,"I know how to use my hydrometer, and I know what numbers to look at and write down on my brewing sheets, but I'm not sure what those numbers actually represent, or even what units I should use to label those readings.   What's the science behind the hydrometer? How are they calibrated? What else should I know about the theory of using one to make better beer? "
381,Aluminium boil pots: Heresy or not?,"Are aluminium pots acceptable as boil vessels?  They're cheap, but I've heard they can produce off-flavors.  Any experiences with them? "
382,Will scaling a recipe from 5 gallons to 1 gallon introduce significant differences?,"Will scaling a recipe down to 1 gallon (i.e.: dividing the amount of each ingredient by 5) produce a pretty close approximation of the results of a full 5 gallon batch? Are there any additional considerations in brewing such a small batch?  I'd like to do some small experimental batches over the winter, using a 2-gallon stockpot on the stovetop instead of my usual brew kettle on an outdoor burner setup. I want to make sure they're pretty close to what a 5-gallon would end up like (esp. taste) so I can decide whether to go ahead with full batches of these recipes in the spring. "
383,What are some methods to increase extraction efficiency and consistency?,"I've got some irregular sugar extraction efficiency problems. My efficiency is regularly low. I need your help. :) I get anywhere from 60% - 85%.  I've fine tuned my mill to the best of my ability, so I don't think that's much of a problem. I use a batch sparge method during the lautering process and I know fly sparging is probably a better way if I'm really concerned with efficiency. But I'm not really interested in doing that. Could grain bed channels be a problem even with batch sparging?  Do you have any other methods that you'd recommend to increase consistency and efficiency?  I use:   10 gallon Igloo cooler MLT Digital cable thermometer for monitoring mash temps Single infusion batch sparge  "
384,How long should a Shiraz age?,"I made a Shiraz from a kit early this spring (bottled in April). I also made a Johannesburg Riesling. I know reds take longer than whites to age, but we've been enjoying the Riesling for some time now (I have only one bottle left), while when I opened a Shiraz last week it was clearly not ready yet. Has anyone else done a Shiraz? How long did it take before it was good? How long before it was in its prime? "
385,Brewing Solid Things: Can Leftover Yeast Be Used for Bread?,"I find myself baking a couple loaves of bread just about every weekend. Has anyone tried reusing their yeast from brewing for baking bread? I've heard that using some of the spent grain in bread recipes works well, but I'm curious if brewing yeasts are significantly different from those used baking that it would produce some not-so-great tasting bread? "
386,My beer tastes like green apples.,"I brewed a blonde ale with extract a little over a month ago.  I fermented in primary for three weeks and have been bottle-conditioning for two weeks.  I didn't take an OG, but the final gravity before bottling was 1.011 (exactly what the recipe called for).  I cracked one open this morning to give it a taste, and while it's good, it has a distinct, syrupy taste similar to green apples.  Any ideas what might have caused this?  Is this a taste which will likely mellow out with time? "
387,Calculating the exact alcohol volume,"Using a hydrometer is great for most people, but the geek in me would like to know the exact alcohol content of my brew.  What would be the process, titration? And what chemicals would I need? "
388,What are some alternatives to hops?,"I have a friend that is allergic to hops and can not drink our beer (or just about any others for that matter).  What alternatives do I have if I want to make a beer for him?  What could I substitute for bittering?  What would my options be for aroma and flavoring hop alternatives?  If I could even just get a bittering component into the beer, I would have "
389,Is it possible to do full boils without a propane burner?,"I currently brew all-grain using a 7.5 gallon pot on a propane burner outside at a house I currently rent. However, I'm planning to move within the year to an apartment in the city and likely won't have the space to do outdoor brewing.  Is there an effective way to do full boils without a propane burner? Is a gas stove absolutely required or are there other ways to do it (multiple burners, etc)? "
390,How should I add mint to my beer?,"I'm making a mint chocolate stout. I've made it before; I added 1.5 ounces of fresh spearmint to the last 10 or 15 minutes of the boil. It turned out alright, but it's not as strong as I'd like. The obvious answer would be to add more mint. But before I make it again, I'd like to utilize your collective experience.  When is the best time to add mint without imparting off flavors?  Should I add it to secondary? (Last time I scooped it out before fermenting)  What type of mint would go best with the roasted malt notes? "
391,Is Wyeast American Ale II a highly flocculant yeast strain?,"I am enjoying being a brewer, I can make beer.  So, now I am trying to refine some of the processes. I generally make IPA's and have been using Wyeast American Ale II yeast.  Once fermentation is done (~5-7 days), how long should I let it sit for the yeast to clean itself up? At this time of year I can cold crash w/o fining to clear things up a bit @ about 35F for a few days. Does this seem ok?  Also, I may be switching to US-05 dry yeast, any variation to the process using this yeast? Thanks. "
392,"Lager: No fermentation, what are my choices?","Last weekend 2 of my friends and me tried brewing a lager (doppelbock) for the first time. Brewing went well, but not the yeast!  We are now 4 days later, and no sign of activity. Gravity taken: did not go down at all.  What are the solutions considering that we don't have access to another lager yeast vial easily (2 hours drive) ?  Can we buy an ale yeast and do it that way instead? What will be the results?  What are the other alternatives, if any?  Thanks!  EDIT:  It worked! It took almost one week but now we're getting something! :)   "
393,Should I worry about mash pH when brewing with RO water?,"I always use RO water to brew.  I have never checked mash pH, but have become concerned since my brews have come out darker than predicted by BrewSmith.  I thought (I read in How to Brew by Palmer) that adding some DME to the mash will normalize mash pH; so that is what I have done.  Is RO water not the way to go?  Or should I be paying more attention to mash pH on lighter beers?  Is there a rule of thumb? "
394,How to read volume from a sight gauge,"I have a 15 gallon kettle and am looking to add a sight gauge to it. I have been looking around and have come across a couple that I like. I would rather get a sight gauge that is encased in metal like the one here. However, I have not read in the description of this gauge or any like it (with the encasing) that include some kind of calibration labels. The only sight gauge I can find that include the labels is here. Am I missing something? Or are some manufacturers not including the labels?   "
395,Which hops should I use (and how should I use them) for bittering without aroma or flavour?,"Looks like I've got a spare day tomorrow so I thought I'd get an AG brew on the go. What I've been wanting to do for a little while is brew a fairly plain, 1-dimensional 5 gallon test brew, and when it comes to dry hopping I will split it into 5 separate containers with a different hop in each. Being just a beginner I figure this would help me understand the flavour contributions from hops a little better.  I've got 5 varieties of hops I've not tried before coming through in the next couple of days so I should be able to get the brew on now in preparation.  So I need to make a simple brew from the ingredients I have. I'm thinking about 5kg Maris Otter and 500g light crystal malt for the grains... Perhaps some maize for better head retention and clarity?  However, when it comes to hops I'm not quite sure what to do... At my disposal tomorrow I have EKG, fuggles, challenger, target and first gold. I want to add hops purely to bitter so that they won't affect the flavour so whichever I choose it'll be for a thorough 60min boil at least with no later additions.  Then, when it comes to dry hopping, how should I proceed? Weight of hops and duration etc.  Any suggestions and tips?  Tips on the grain choice for this experiment greatly received too! "
396,Shelf life of canned and unfermented wort?,"I asked in a prior post about canning wort to have it handy for yeast farming. What would the shelf life be of canned, unfermented wort? Any special steps to extend shelf life, perhaps adding hops?  What I'm getting at, is would it be possible to do a huge batch (several gallons) and keep it for a year or two? On the surface it sounds like it would be plausible, as the contents are sterilized in the canning process and many things have a shelf life this long. "
397,Stevenson's screen for backyard home brewing?,I've moved into a house with no access under the house. I was thinking of brewing beer in a shadowy corner of the backyard.   My question is - is it practical to brew beer in your backyard using a box like a Stevenson's screen? (Or is there a specific alternative to this for home brewing?)  Assumptions:    The weather outside is the Australian summer (15-35 degrees C). Direct exposure to the sunlight would probably wreck the brew.  The point is to shelter the brewing process without having the odours in the house.  This is about about fermenting outside in a shelter  
398,Alternative brews,"I'm relatively new to various forms of alcohol and the processes used to distill them, and so I have a theoretical question.  What kinds of organic matter can't be used to create an alcohol?  There's wheat and rice and various fruits like oranges or grapes that are common for beers, vodka, etc.  And then there's gin which confuses me a bit.  Would it be possible to ferment (for example) pine sap?  Maple sap?  Garlic?  Onions?  Oregon Grapes?  Poison ivy?  Is it the relative expense of some of those materials that makes them rare or non-existent?  Or is it that the results are poor and/or not worth repeating?  Or just non-starting results? "
399,Fermwraps and Contact with Towels or Cardboard ** Safety Question,"I have four carboys in the closet and four in my bedroom on account of doubling production. The carboys in the bedroom have towels wrapped around them to prevent sunlight from hitting them.  I ought to purchase better drapes, but in the meantime, is it ok for me to wrap a Fermwrapped carboy in a towel? Edit: I am referring to safety and efficiency.  Edit: Another thought: I have all the cardboard boxes which the carboys came in. Can I place them upside down over the carboy if it is wrapped in a fermwrap? (it is tall enough to fit the airlock).  Here is what I am worried about the most:  I am using a Raspberry Pi with a commercial relay device (PowerSwitch Tail II) to monitor the temperature of the beer and turn on and off the Fermwrap if the temperature of the wort gets too low or too high, respectively.  I am in the middle of programming it so that:  I initially set the minimum temperature to 30% of the ""optimal temperature range"" and the maximum temperature to 40% of that range, meaning the fermwrap will turn on if the temperature is under 30%, and turn off if over 40%.   In the event that the temperature of the wort goes way higher than I anticipated due to the insulation effect of the towel/cardboard, the minimum and maximum range should decrease by 5%.  In the event that the temp of the wort goes too low, increase the minimum and maximum by 5%.  I'm worried that if I don't program this correctly, the temperature of the fermwrap could possible get too hot and a) ruin the beer; but more importantly b) present a firehazard to the towel or to the cardboard. "
400,At what point on a Yeast's Optimal Temperature Range should the power to a Fermwrap be turned off?,"I finally hooked a PowerSwitch Tail II up to my Raspberry Pi and Fermwrap. The RPi has DS18B20 temperature probes directly measuring the temperature of the wort by going down through the airlock.  For this particular yeast strain, Northern Brewer recommends its optimal temperature range as 66-74°F (18.9-24.3°C).  What I did was subtract 66 from 74 to get 8. I rather arbitrarily chose that the fermwrap should be turned on when the temperature is lower than the bottom 30% of the range -- (8 * 0.3) + 66 = 68.4°F, and the Fermwrap should be turned off when the temperature is hotter than 60% of the range -- (8 * 0.6) + 66 = 70.8°F  ---------- This is 20.2°C and 21.6°C respectively.  I left the house for several hours and came back to find the brew at 74.8°F -- 0.8°F over. The Fermwrap was turned off as it should have been (I am assuming it turned off exactly at 70.8°F). Yet the temperature increased way more than I had intended it.  I figured that by cutting the Fermwrap off at 70.8°F, and given that the ambient temperature was dropping as it was getting later into the night, that the carboy's temperature would not have kept increasing.  What point should I cut the Ferwrap off? Is 60% of the scale too high?  Could the fact that I am surrounding the carboy and the fermwrap with a towel (to block sunlight) have anything to do with it? "
401,"What are the consequences of a ""weak"" boil?","I am new to homebrewing and am getting help from an experienced brewer. So far I think everything has gone OK. I am doing all-grain brewing on a stovetop. I have done 2 brews. I am doing the mash and boil in a 15 gallon kettle. As far as the mash, I have had no problem hitting my target saccharification rest temp and can hold it there (within about +- 3°) for 60 minutes. However when attempting the boil I have run into somewhat of a problem. I can't quite reach a rolling boil. I can only hit about 210° with the lid off. And over the length of the boil, the temp slowly decreases to about 205°. If I leave the lid on, I can hit a nice rolling boil. For future brews, I plan on having a smaller amount of liquid in the kettle and will leave the lid on. Once I noticed I can get a much better boil with the lid it was too late to brew that way because I had about 6.8 gallons in my kettle and needed some of it to evaporate so I can get down to about 5.5 gallons.  So my question is this: What are the chemical, taste, etc. consequences of doing a ""weak"" or ""light"" boil at about 210° ? Will I taste a difference? Would an experienced brewer taste a difference? Was it not 100% sterilized? "
402,How to crush unmalted wheat?,"I made a witbier last weekend from a recipe which called for a pound of unmalted wheat in the grain bill (along with 8 oz pilsner malt, 8 oz flaked wheat, 4 oz flaked oats, and 6 lbs dry malt extract). The unmalted wheat was too hard for the mill at the local homebrew shop. I tried crushing it with a rolling pin with no success. So i wound up using it whole, which left me wondering if that was really effective.   Are there specific techniques for crushing unmalted wheat (assuming you don't have a mill)? Could i grind it in a coffee mill, or a blender?  "
403,"First brewing experience, First kit. need advice","Okay, so I got a homebrew starter kit for xmas about 5 years ago.  it contained 23 litres of prepared wort, a primary pail, a secondary glass carboy and nearly all the tools needed.  I still had to get the cleaning stuff though.  Long story short, the kit sat in my parent's basement for the 5 years untouched.  I was careful to put the airlock into the carboy to prevent dust from entering, as I wasn't sure when i would start.  I haven't ever done anything like this, although I've seen a couple people ferment and bottle, and I've read up quite a bit before i started.  I took some notes here and I would like to get your input and advice.  will this batch work out? I know it might not taste perfect....  Will there be any toxins I should be aware of?  So, I started with a ""FestaBrew Blonde Lager"" wort.  it's 5 years old, but I got fresh yeast for it.  I got a ""Lallemand Windsor Yeast"", British -Style Beer Yeast. (0.388oz, expiry 01/2015)  I had asked the clerk at the brew shop what yeast I need for this lager work I had.  He didn't seem responsive, and all I understood from him is that any yeast will work.  With some research I understand now that any yeast SHOULD work.. but it's the yeast and temperature and time which define an ale or a lager.  The yeast I got was an ale yeast, so I'm trying to follow ale methods.  Feb 22 @ 12am - Cleaned and sanitized the primary, and racking tube and my hydrometer and testing cylinder.  Poured in the wort, making sure to create lots of turbulence.  I then siphoned off a small sample to test later.  I boiled some water, poured 100ml into a sanitized glass, and waited for it to cool down to the ideal temperature that the yeast packet called for.  once at 35 Celsius, I added the yeast, and gave it a small stir to dissolve it.  Then I added it to the wort already in the primary, and gave the whole thing a small stir to evenly distribute it.  I then put the lid on and installed the airlock, with sanitizer in the airlock.  One thing I did notice at this point is that the lid didn't have a gasket and so there wasn't an air-tight seal.  I got a little concerned here.  The sample a siphoned off, without the yeast added had a S.G. of 1.045  Feb 22 @ 12pm - No airlock activity, rather it appears to be ""reversing"", or vacuuming.  I burped the pail/airlock to prevent sanitizer from being sucked in. - probably due to the lid not having a gasket.  I could smell beer from the lid edges.  I peeked through the bunghole and it appears to be active.  Feb 23 @ 12pm - No airlock activity, but still having the vacuum effect.  Burped it again.  Feb 23 @ 10:30pm - Peek through bunghole, yeast is active.  Burped the airlock.  Feb 24 @ 7pm - No airlock activity, no vacuum effect.  No need to burp.  Feb 25 @ 9pm - No activity on airlock, racked into carboy.  Small sample gave a S.G. of 1.013, which indicates that there was some kind of activity.  The sample tastes like beer, and smells like beer.  The beer appears quite cloudy which I'm not sure about, and there was sediment in the pail, which I know is normal.  The airlock began to work immediately when i put it in.  Feb 26 @ 6am - Airlock working just fine, cloudyness starting to fall, as there is about 1"" of clear beer at the top.  No yeast foam observed.  Installed stick on temp guage.  It reads about 65F or lower.  Ambient temp is 74F.  And here we are...  I would appreciate any feed back you have, good or bad.  I have a couple pictures of the cloudyness and the sludge.  But I don't know how to insert them here. "
404,Cloudy beer after bottling?,"We have just made our first brew - an all grain pale ale. As per recipe we left it fermenting for a week, syphoned into a separate bucket, adding the priming sugar and then bottled. The beer is cloudy!! Would like to know why this might be and if the brew will be safe to drink after conditioning?? Thanks 🤞 "
405,I got some sanitiser in brew now I am not sure if its fermenting,I was cooling down my wort in the sink and couple of drops of sanitiser dripped from my hand into the cooling liquid.  I was using VWP and the solution was as per the instructions 1 teaspoon per 4 litres. I would say less than 5ml got into 5 litres of brew.   I pitched my yeast but feel like I am seeing very little action from the bucket. So my questions are   Is it safe for consumption? Will that amount of steriliser kill off my yeast?   Thanks :) 
406,Reusing water from boiling corn cobs?,"I will be boiling corn cobs and I was thinking about reusing this water to make a brew batch.  I know some commercial breweries use corn as an ingredient, but I am unsure how.  I am thinking that a light blonde beer would work well, like a Corona. It could be an all-grain batch, where I would use the water to mash my grain... Or it could be an extract batch, where I would used this ""tinted"" water in the mix...  Has anyone done this? Besides flavour, would it add some corn sugar as well? Any recipe suggestions? "
407,"Elderflower ""Champagne"": would sediments from a first batch help the second one?","I have made elderflower ""champagne"" a few times using a traditional method without added yeast, simply relying on the natural yeasts on the flowers.  Similar to sourdough, the results may vary a bit depending on the ""yeast lottery"" one is playing and yes, sometimes a batch fails. This is usually noticeable after a day or three, I only bottle it up after the smell, taste and fizz tell me that everything is well on the way to the ripe drink. This is what I did with my latest batch this morning.  Now, elderflower season is still in full swing, the weather just right and I'm pondering a second batch. Usually, I'd be cleaning and boiling my fermentation jar before every use, but while bottling, I noticed a generous amount of sediment, which looks like a mix of yeasts and pollen to me.   The sourdough baker in me immediately started wondering:  Would just refilling the jar with fresh water, flowers sugar and citric acid be a good idea? Would the sediment act like a sourdough starter? Or would I commit the cardinal sin of working with a ""dirty jar"" instead, setting me up for failure?  Note that the yeasty-alcoholic-fermenty smell of this batch was particularly nice and that I closed the fermenting jar immediately after pouring out the raw champagne, keeping contamination at a minimum.

408,Making hard cider with very low alcohol,I brew kombucha and want to make cider. How could i make cider with very low alcohol level? i want it to be close to 1% if not lower. Is that possible? 
409,Got major infection in my brew,"Something crazy happened.  Out of my last 8 batches of mead and beer 6 came out infected. I am cleaning my equipment with PBW and sanitizing with Starsan.   I make my batches in the kitchen (both beer and meads). Using clean tools, always keep at most 3-4 days old bucket with starsan solution, and yet, get every 3 out of 4 batches infected.  Does it mean that I got some nasty air bacteria in the air that lands into a carboy? Or can any bacteria survive in Starsan solution? If that is in fact an equipment issue, would bleaching it help? If that is an air bacteria in the kitchen, what's the best solution for that? If that is a fermentation chamber issue (issues happen even if I ferment outside of it) what's the best and most effective way to sanitise it?  Update: This is a new problem. Brewed for 3.5 years. Pretty successfully. Won multiple awards at the State level. Meads I don't boil and usually use different equipment/carboys for them. I changed all hoses and got a brand new 1.5 gallon carboy and few 1 gallon jugs. Got new stoppers and airlocks. Every once in a while I open the lid and ad staggered nutrients.   Any help would be appreciated. I'm loosing really good batches, and money... "
410,Viscosity of a Russian Imperial Stout,"How can I increase the viscosity of a Russian imperial stout?  I've heard of making boils longer Use oats, What do you recommend?  Thank you so much!  Regards, Erik Dobrychtop. Cya o/ "
411,Bitter flavor/tannins,"My second brew was today and I have a sample from before the wart was throw in the fermentation bucket. It's a rye IPA and the sample tastes very bitter. I know that's to be expected, but I feel like it's more bitter than I thought and I am paranoid that the whole grain steeping might have released tannins. This is because we let the temp get slightly above 170 for a brief period (maybe 2 minutes - my girlfriend turned the burners up when I wasn't looking). I guess there's no way to know by asking on here. I guess my question in general is: does the wort(?) taste extremely bitter before fermentation vs. after? Would you be able to definitely taste tannins vs. hop bitterness? (Hops used were Magnum at boil followed by Omega at 35 minutes.) "
412,Carbonation in a 5 gallon keg with priming sugar,If I purchased a 5 gallon keg online could I carbonate the fermented beer by adding the required amount of priming sugar to the keg? Do I need a CO2 tank or will I be fine just carbonating it with sugar? 
413,Storing beer in a keg,After beer is done fermenting can I move it to a keg not carbonate it and let it sit for a long time? Or could it sit for a longer period of time after being carbonated? 
414,Recipe simply calls for caramalt,"Some friends and I wanted to try to recreate the brew dog Vagabond Pale Ale from their diy dog catalog. The grain bill looks as follows   Pale Ale 3.38kg 7.43lb Caramalt 0.5kg 1.1lb Crystal 150 0.19kg 0.41lb   My question is, when a recipe simple states ""caramalt"", which one should you use, cara-pils, cara-vienna, or cara-someother?  I read this page to try to clarify things, but that only helped confirm that they are all similar. Is there a way to know which one might be a better candidate for the beer style? "
415,Kegs head space,Could I buy a 16 gallon keg and only fill it with 10 gallons of beer and just fill all the headspace with co2? Will this cause the beer to absorb too much and be too carbonated? 
416,Step Mash Calculation,"I just brewed my hefeweizen for the 3rd time. At the time of the first batch I'd read an article that suggested a ferulic acid rest at 110°F to accentuate the banana notes in the aroma. I mash in a picnic cooler a la @DennyConn and am having issues with the raising the mash temp to the 150s.    Initial mash is 11.75 lbs of grain and 2.9 Gal. of water @116°F.  I hit the temp fine and let it rest 20 mins.  At 20 mins, I added 3.8 Gal. of water at 170°F and only hit 140°F.  I used the strike temp calculator at Homebrewing.com with the  following data:   Grain Mass - 34 lbs (2.9 Gal. water (@8.5lb/Gal) + 11.75 lbs)  Grain temp - 110°F  Water amount 3.8 Gal.  Target Mash 152°F   I verified using a different calculator and got similar results.  What am I missing?  Also, BeerSmith showed that I needed to use 189°F water for the sac rest and I ignored it in lieu of my regular calculator.  (BTW, I added another 1.5 Gal. at near boiling to her the mash to 150°F to salvage the mash) "
417,Is head space really necessary when bottling still mead?,"I think most of us here leave a head space that is the space left when we pull the wand out of the bottle. So, if we are dealing with still mead is the head space really necessary? Would this space + micro-oxygenation through the cork oxidate much faster long time aged meads? Or is this something we should not concern about?  "
418,Immersion wort chiller length,"Will a 50 feet copper immersion wort chiller chill twice as fast as a 25 feet?  I was thinking that once the water has absorbed all the heat it can, it doesn't matter how long it will travel in the tubbing.  So what is the ideal length ? "
419,Adding high amount of yeast to sugar wash,"Given that I would not care for good flavor.  Would adding 1 lb of hydrated bakers yeast to of a 5 gallon of sugar wash with 17 lbs of sugar make the fermentation process any faster?  How much time would the process take in right temperature?  Both sugar and yeast used are dirt cheap where I am.  I'm going to distill the wash then flavor with strong whiesky essence afterwards so I don't care too much about the flavour of the wash.    Cheers,  S "
420,Higher temperature during first two days after pitching yeast,"I am brewing for the first time. It is a Chinook IPA. The yeast that came with the kit is Safale US-05. I brewed and pitched it on July 4th in the afternoon. The primary fermentation time is 2 weeks as per instructions.  Though the instructions have a temperature range mentioned against the yeast -  I didn't realize that this is the ambient temperature range I need to maintain while fermentation takes place. I learnt later in the night that it's better to maintain a temperature between 62F and 70F and anything above 72 risks esters and off flavors. I checked the fermometer on the side of carboy in the night and it read 76F-78F. Yikes! I immediately wrapped a couple of wet shirts around the carboy and turned up my AC and that brought it down to 74-75. Then I ordered an insulation bag for the carboy into which I can put ice packs and bottles that will bring the temperature down to range I need. The bag won't arrive till tomorrow - July 6th. My question is-  1) when is the most important time for fermentation? Am I already too late? I already have a thick Krausen within 18 hours of pitching.   2) will bringing the temperature down now control the hot alcohol  / off flavors?   Also, I didn't check the temperature when I pitched the yeast.  I'm quite sure it wasnt too warm because I had cooled my wort down in a water bath and added cold water to the carboy + cold water on top to bring the water level up - the tap water is quite cold even in summer where I live. I have a robust fermentation going with constant bubbles in the airlock and a 1.5 inch krausen already.  "
421,pre-boil water the day before?,"I live in an area with hard water and I usually treat my water with a campden tablet. It's usually fine but I'd like to try something different. Can I boil my water the night before brew day and leave in the HLT with lid on ready for the morning?   Will this have any adverse effect on the water? I'm aware that heating it twice may remove some oxygen, is that a problem?  "
422,Why bother with airlock when I can just leave the tube going to the bleach water in place?,"Making my first batch!  Using a Brooklyn Brew Shop kit, and did the active part last night.  I've got the jug in a cool/dark place and it it bubbling away, sending CO2 through the tube in the top of the jug into pot of bleachy water.  My question:  why bother taking out the tube and installing the airlock, like the instructions say to do after a couple of days?  Why not just leave the tube in there, going out to the bleachy water?  Seems to serve fine, but then there might be something I haven't considered. "
423,"Do Some Carbon Filters Remove Chloramines, While Others Don't?","I thought that carbon filtration removed both chlorine and chloramines from water. However, the seller of a reverse osmosis system on Amazon answered a question with this:     This system can remove up to 99% of chlorine. A different inline filter will need to be added in order to remove Chloramines as well.    This particular unit has two carbon filters, one in the beginning and one in the end, both are:     Premium Quick-Connect coconut shell activated carbon filter. Nominal 5 Micron Rating GAC Acid Washed Carbon    Are there different types of carbon filters, some that would filter out chloramine and some that do not?  Edit: I received a response from the seller:     Standard carbon filters can remove traces of chloramines from a water source, but to effectively remove it up to 99%, you would need a carbon filter that uses ""catalytic carbon"" media inside it.  "
424,Cider - Yeast doesn't seem to kick off,"I have 2 x 23L carbouy's full of freshly pressed juice, ready for fermentation.  I began the process by killing off all the wild yeast strains in the apples by adding 1 1/4 teaspoons of sodium metabisulphide to each carbouy and let it sit for 48 hours before pitching the yeast.  After the 48 hours, I added my yeast (which I started the day before with Juice + Yeast until it started boiling then refrigerated to ensure I get a good fermentation)  The next day I removed the yeast from the fridge for 2 hours - saw the yeast bubbling and dumped it into my juice (with 1 cup of liquefied brown sugar to each carbouy for good measure).  However, after a week now, I still have yet to see the fermentation process begin.  The carbouys are in a dark wine cellar (80% humidity/ 16-18 degree celcius).  Does anyone know what might be going on?  It could be any of the following:   The sodiummetabisulphide is still in the must and not allowing the yeast to begin - do I add more yeast? do I add a yeast booster? The temperature is too low - what temperature should it be at?   Any advice is welcome!  Thanks in advance.  Peter "
425,Can I lager in bottles?,"I am planning to do a lager this winter, since I don't have a good way of controlling temperature, I was wondering if it is possible to bottle it with priming sugar, and then lager it? Or should I just move it to secondary to lager, then bottle?  What would be the benefits of doing it either way? "
426,Sitting to long after fermentation,I had brewed one gallon and I let it ferment and then let it sit... I think it has been two months or so after the recommended fermentation of this particular brew. I know it won't continue to ferment or anything but I am wondering if you just let it sit for that long does anything bad happen? Or could I just bottle it like normal and not get sick or anything!? Thank you! 
427,"How to increase gravity / decrease amount of water in my wort, and extract the same amount of sugars?","I have this problem: I'm regularly achieving 90% efficiency with my mash and sparge, and I like this effect. But I usually end up with about 30 ~ 35 liters when I aim for 20 ~ 22 liters. Boil to reduce water takes long time. So I need to reduce amount of water used without loss of sugars. How can I do it?  My current procedure, shown on most recent example:  I took 6kg of malt (weighted when dry), wet-crushed it, and mashed it in water. Total volume of malt + water was about 20 ~ 22 liters. I received about 13~15 liters of first wort at 18 °Bx. Then, before my filter bed got anything near dry,  I started to pour sparge water. I ended up sparge at 2 °Bx, ending up with a total of 35 ~ 37 liters. I didn't mix it up right away, because I don't have pot large enough, so can't tell exact gravity, but at the end I got bit under 22 liters at 17.2 °Bx - perfectly consistent with BrewTarget (expectation was 22 liters at 17.1 °Bx).  Any way to recreate this result without getting to boil away 15 liters of water? Where I might went wrong?  Note - dry vs wet crushing does not change anything in that regard. Wrote it just for completness.  For sparge and filtering, I'm using this:    Except now it's full metal. "
428,Cider confusion,"I recently made cider from my apple trees and hand pressed them and all and I am having trouble figuring everything out.   So far I have made the hard cider two different ways my first time, to test both and eliminate waiting for them to ferment.  I am using cider yeast for both of these.  I used for my first batch:   1 liter cider  3 tbs honey  Enough yeast for 1 gallon ( due to having no way to measure it accurately)   It's been sitting for 7 days not with little bubbles still filling my balloon.   I got a carboy but my container doesn't fit it well.  The second batch is:   1 gallon cider  1 packet of yeast ( good for a gallon)   It has been sitting for about 4 days and is very bloated the bottle ( being that it's plastic and the other ones glass).  This one doesn't have any balloon on it just a cap sealing it.  When will I know if they're done?  How do I bottle them correctly with still allowing them to have some carbonation?   If I pasteurize them will that kill the possibility of having it carbonated when I bottle it?   If anyone know the answers to these please feel free to be as detailed in your answer as possible because YouTube videos and reading online always leaves grey areas.  Thanks a lot  "
429,Possible wild yeast contamination?,"In May I brewed the following beer:   81% Pale 2 row malt 16% Brown malt 3% Black malt   Single step mash at 73C.  With 290g of hops for a total of 103 IBUs.  The OG was 1.077 and it went into primary fermentation at around 18C on 9th May. With an old vial (around 1 year after the best used date) of WLP007 Dry English Ale (I made 2x 1.5l starters for it).  So on the 16th May i checked again and it dropped to 1.036, waited and on the 5th June it still was at 1.036 (figured the fermentation was finished?) so I racked into the secondary and added 50g of Burbon soaked oak chips.  On the 27th of June I racked it of the oak chips as the beer already had a heavy tanninic/woody/unpleasant note.  As I didn't have any space in the cellar I moved it into the flat and stood there (no bottles for filling) at around 23C.   And then the fermentation started again. The airlock got activity and by the 9th of September dropped down to 1.009.  Now 9th of October it went down to 1.006 and activity is still present.  So I was wondering what happened? It is a very attenuative yeast but down to 1.004 should not happen especially with the high mash temperature.  So possibly contamination with a wild yeast? The beer is at the moment quite hash, but at that IBU and alcohol content with not much sugar left it is no wonder.  I thought about waiting for the residual fermentation to stop and then adding lactose to get some sweetness back in? "
430,What types of artificial sweetener are normally used in fruit cider in the UK & US?,"Since yeast will generally eat any sugar you add to your must/cider, adding sugar for sweetness in home-brewing isn't really an option unless you get more elaborate and pasteurise, etc. So artificial sweeteners are the obvious option to allow bottle-conditioned sparkling cider with sensible ABV and a nice level of sweetness... especially the modern trend of sweet ""fruit ciders"".  But what artificial sweeteners are commonly used and easily purchased? There are so many used commercially and some have noticeable flavour (in a bad way) to different people... for instance my wife loves Sprite Zero and Coke Zero but finds other diet sodas have a nasty after-taste from sweeteners.  What sweeteners make sense for home-brewing, and what are their pros/cons? How should I choose which one to use?  They need to be non-fermentable "
431,Do you use rice hulls with your Blichmann False Bottom?,"I used to use a simple drink cooler and screen for a mash tun, but was given a chugger pump, 10 gallon Blichmann G2, and false bottom which I now use in a RIMS setup. The first time I brewed a wheat on the new system I used 1# of rice hulls like I always did, but some of the hulls slipped through the false bottom and clogged my quick disconnects. Has anyone else experienced this?   I brewed the same beer again last week, but left the rice hulls out of the equation and had no issues. I am now wondering if they are even necessary with the Blichmann false bottom.  EDIT Grain Bill:   5 lbs. 2-Row Brewer’s Malt 4 lb. White Wheat Malt 0.5 lb. Flaked Wheat 0.25 lb. Munich Malt 0.25 lb. Aromatic Malt   In your experience, about what amount of Wheat or Oats will cause stuck mashes or lautering problems? "
432,Mold growing on blow-off tube water -- batch ruined?,"I'm brewing my first batch with a brooklyn brew show all-gain kit.  I skipped the airlock and left the blow-off tube in place in a pot of bleachy water.  It's been there for the past two weeks.    Today, I go look at it to start bottling and I see mold growing on the water that the blow-off tube was plugged into!  I guess the bleach evaporated..  Is the batch ruined?  And to avoid this in the future, I suppose I should just re-up the bleach every so often? "
433,Watermelon Wheat Beer - Bitter Taste,"After a week of primary fermentation, I tried adding about 8 pounds of watermelon puree to my secondary fermenter and took a gravity and taste test 10 days later.  The beer still tastes very tart/bitter and not like fresh watermelon.  Any advice? Should I be using a combination of fresh watermelon and watermelon extract?  Will the flavor improve after carbonation? Should I have used more or less watermelon puree?  Should I have used watermelon juice instead of puree?  Also, since I hope to brew a few more fruit beers, I noticed the colour of wheat extract beer is very dark.  Should I be using a combination of liquid wheat extract and golden extract to get a more yellow colour?  I have already read this post:  Watermelon beer, anyone tried brewing? "
434,Total Cider Noob Move,"Following instructions from the Portland Mercury on homebrewing cider, I pitched a whole 5 gram packet of champagne yeast by mistake in my 1 gallon brew. It says that the packet makes a 5 gallon batch... I also never followed the recommended instructions on the packet either by dissolving in 100 degree water. I have, however, added 1/4 teaspoon of yeast nutrient on brew day.   I've been checking the amount of carbonation every day and the bubbles have been very small and not very intense. The liquid is very cloudy (probably due to the ludicrous amounts of yeast I put in) and the airlock bloops have pretty much stopped after a week. After inspecting it closer and messing around with the airlock a bit, I think i may have caused a small crack around the rim of the airlock cap. It seems like it is still likely air tight, but who knows.   So.... The questions I have for you experienced cider home brewers: Is it likely the sugars were eaten by the yeast at a expedited rate and my brew has almost fermented weeks in advance due to the excessive yeast? Or do I have an airlock problem? Or is it going super slow because I didn't prepare the yeast better?  I'm considering getting a new airlock and seeing how the process continues, unless I've completely botched my first batch like a newbie. In that case I would like to start over, but any input helps! Thanks yall. -Aaron "
435,How can I seal off the liquid line on a sankey keg to allow force carbonation?,"I want to carbonate several sankey kegs, but the keg couplers have the liquid line open, so if I apply CO2 to them, the beer will come out if I don't have a serving line connected, I only have 2 serving lines, but I want to carbonate all 6 sankey kegs at the same time, how can I block that line? or is there another thing I need to buy/get to close that line? "
436,Cleaning & sanitizing NPT and weldless fittings,"I just got a new boil kettle with a stainless ball valve attached with a weldless bulkhead fitting, and a stainless barb connected to the NPT outlet of the ball valve.  What's the cleaning procedure for the weldless fitting and the NPT connection? Do I need to remove every fitting and clean and sanitize each part? Or can I just run some hot PBW through the valve after use?  Ideally I'd prefer to not disassemble everything and have to re-tape the NPT joint, but obviously I don't want to set myself up for an infection.  EDIT: @Dale made good point about the heat from the boil sanitize everything. But what about NPT fittings that are downstream? E.g. most plate chillers, pumps, etc. have NPT fittings. Do they need to be disassembled and sanitize before a batch? "
437,Temperature for fermenting a hybrid (california common),"I'm planning to brew a California common ""steam"" beer. I will be using a bottom fermenting lager yeast, specifically Wyeast 2112 California Lager. This is intended for a warmer fermentation, up to 68 degrees(F).  My question is, what will happen if I ferment at 70 degrees? Alternatively, I could move it outside, which would lower the average temperature, yet introduce far more variability. Bad idea? Or should I just give up and find some ale yeast?  "
438,How do I identify the type of poppet I need for a corny keg?,"I just got my first kegs - a couple used, reconditioned corny kegs from beveragefactory.com, still smelling like soda (yay). I've been reading up on the process and it seems like it's a best practice to replace the poppets, along with the O-rings. Wish I knew that before I made the order, or I would have gotten those too.  There are several types of poppets.   How do I identify the the type of poppet I need for my keg?   Also how to I remove and replace them?  I found a couple pages that list some different types:   Poppets from CHI Co.  Poppets from beverage factory   Also any recommendations on other cheap places to get the poppets would be great. eBay seems like it might be a way to go.  I have ball lock Pepsi kegs, and the lids say Corco on them.  tops of my kegs:   "
439,Cherry vishnick,"I've been looking for recipes for cherry vishnick and most of them involve just putting the cherries into a jar of vodka for several weeks. I'd been looking for a recipe that involves fermentation. I found one: [website]The part that involves fermentation:     Put 2 cups of cherries in a really large jar with a cup of sugar. Do not pit the cherries, she warned, because the pits are critical to the fermentation process. Let the fruit and sugar ferment for 2 weeks.   Has anyone tried this before? I'm thinking about doing this but I'm concerned that just putting cherries into water with sugar could easily get mouldy. Should I add some yeast too, to ensure that it ferments correctly? I'm guessing this recipe depends on wild yeast but I've never had any luck with that.    UPDATE  So I'm trying this out. After about a week, the sugar had drawn out all of the moisture of the cherries so now the wrinkly cherries are floating in this thick, pinkish syrup. I hadn't expected it to go as fast as it did - it probably went so fast because it's been unusually warm in the apartment this week. There's a very slight ""sharpness"" to the smell which might be the product of fermentation, but the taste is very sweet and I can't taste any alcohol. When I opened the jar today, it sounded like there was a bit of gas escaping. I might let it sit in the fridge for the second week, before I add the vodka.    Update 2  I am making it again this summer (2013), and this time I am very certain there is some kind of natural fermentation taking place. There are many tiny bubbles all along the edge of the jar, at the top of where the cherries are. The bubbles only started appearing after about 90% of the sugar was dissolved. There's a distinctive sound of pressure being released when I open the lid on the jar, and it smells like it's fermenting (but not in a bad way). I think this time I will wait until the bubbles stop forming before I add the vodka, but I'm wondering if there's any way to estimate (based on the amount of sugar and sour cherries) how much alcohol is going to be produced by this natural fermentation... "
440,Is level of roast indicative of flavor contributions?,"Crisp carries a 630L Chocolate malt, Munton's carries one that's 385L.     Both are UK maltsters, but (not having actually tasted them) I assume that they taste quite different, even though they are both from the UK and both named ""Chocolate Malt"".   Is that a safe assumption?   Is the only way to know to get some of each and taste and brew with it?  If a recipe only states ""Chocolate Malt"", how can I know which to buy (especially if I have to mail-order my grain, and won't have a chance to taste it before purchase)?    "
441,I'm looking to put together a peach porter,"I have heard several fruit beer podcast and they all come to the same conclusion, 1/3 - 1/4 in the primary and the other portion in the secondary (after fermentation). but I was wondering what would happen if I made a somewhat peach cider then blended it with a porter? am I in for trouble or do I have a good thing ahead?

442,Something in the fermentation chamber made my nose hurt,"So last night I checked on my porter, 48 hours on fermentation with Wyeast 1968, bubbling away happily. My ferm chamber is a small chest freezer.  Got a blowoff tube running from the top of the bucket down to a quart or so of StarSan (leftovers from brew day). The sanitizer foams up, of course, and with all the bubbling and krausen coming down the tube a nasty pool of brown gunk had formed on the floor of the freezer. I grabbed a rag and reached down to mop it up...  And that's when I nearly died. My sinuses screamed in pain and I had to jerk my head out of the freezer. There was a knife-sharp effect on my nose by something in the air in the freezer.  I wouldn't say it's a bad smell, per se. There wasn't really a scent. It's that my nose hurt. A lot.  I managed to clean up the mess by pinching my nose shut before diving in, but man, what an experience.  What was that ""smell""? Was it just CO2 buildup in the closed chest and my nose was reacting to a complete lack of oxygen? Could I possibly have an infection, in my beer or in my nose? Any good theories here? "
443,Could I make vinegar from spoiled wine?,"I have about 20 litres of wine, that was not stored properly (warm place, some access of air), and is now sour.   Can I make from spoiled wine vinegar of the commercial quality? If so, do I need a ""mother culture"" or just waiting longer will still produce the same quality?  Similar question, but too detailed for me. I am asking about the feasibility of the idea. "
444,Measuring yeast in a slurry,"Please tell me if I'm being overly simplistic here.  I was reading the book yeast by Chris White and Jamil Zainasheff.  In the book, they talk about measuring how many cells are in a slurry by using a microscope or by dilution until the slurry is clear in a test tube.  However, they also mention that the size and weight (density) of a yeast cell is known, the density of water is also known.  So couldn't one take a yeast slurry, measure its weight and volume and use this measure of density to determine what percentage of the mass is composed of yeast, and what percentage is composed of water?  Clearly, since wort is more dense than distilled water, you may have to wash the slurry first.  But this seems much simpler than whipping out a microscope or doing multiple dilutions.  Should this work?  Note: I'm talking about measuring the number of yeast cells in a slurry, not their viability or vitality. "
445,"can you dry hop in the primary, or do you have to rack into a secondary in order to add the dry hops?","   Possible Duplicate:   Should dry hopping be done in secondary, when to transfer, and for how long?       All this talk about primary vs secondary, and contamination, oxidation, makes it a little apprehensive to rack into a secondary for the purposes of dry hopping. That's why I'd like to know is it cool ti dry hop the primary, or do we have go secondary? "
446,Any way to rescue an overly bitter beer?,"My latest batch of IPA has come out really unpleasantly bitter, it was only supposed to be about 45 IBUs, using a combination of Northdown, Target and Bobek for bittering (60 minutes) and some more Bobek at flame out and for dry hopping.  But I think I may have messup up somewhere as it tastes like it's much much higher than that...  I've not bottled it yet (it's still in the secondary - been there for a couple of weeks), so I was wondering if there was a way I could rescue this batch, or at least make it more pleasant to drink?  Is there something I could add to the secondary, prior to bottling?  Should I just shove it in the bottles and age it for a while to see if it mellows out?  If it's still too harsh after aging, would it be worth trying to blend it with another beer to counteract the over the top bitterness?  If yes, what do you suggest, something more malty?  EDIT:  Here's the details on the hops as requested in the comments...   Northdown (8.1% AA) - 23g at 60min Target (9.3% AA) - 23g at 60min Bobek (5.25% AA) - 23g at 0min, 20g dry hop for 4 days   OG was 1.059, FG was 1.012 "
447,"Accidental steam beer, temp control and diacetyl","I brewed a 16-gallon batch of my Lawnmower Lager, popped it into my Brewhemoth and inoculated it with 3 packets of Saflager S-23.  My chilling solution isn't working as well as I'd hoped, and it's currently around 60F after about 16 hours - I've just got some bubbling in the blowoff.  I expect it'll be in the mid-to-high 60's when I get home from work today due to fermentation kicking into high gear.  I was hoping for 53-57F.  I've got some plans to get the temp down, but if I can't I'm going to call it a California common/steam beer and hope for the best.  Which brings me back around to my question: since a steam beer is typically fermented with lager yeast at ale temps from the start, won't it generate a ton of diacetyl?  And since you're already at ale temps, how do you do a diacetyl rest to clean it up? "
448,How to tell if (and recover from) a diacetyl rest was done too early?,"I've got a lager (Wyeast 2206) that I've just taken out of primary fermentation (at ~8C, for 10 days) for a diacetyl rest (at ~20C).  I picked the time to do it based on ""How To Brew"" suggesting I wait until bubbling slows to 1-4 bubbles / minute.  It was about 18s between bubbles.  It's now at 20C &amp; is bubbling away furiously, so I'm concerned I may have moved it too early.  How can I tell if it is too early?  Does it matter?  What's the impact and can I recover from it? "
449,What effect will doubling the yeast concentration have?,If I want to have a beer ferment in less time would doubling the amount of yeast I pitch help? Will there be any consequences of doing so? Does it matter if I make a starter for them both? 
450,Does bourbon flavor decrease with time in the bottle?,"My first attempt with both oak and bourbon is currently sitting in my carboys, and will for another month and a half, when I'll at least get to taste a little as I bottle.  Then the plan is to let it age for close to a year.  In the latter part of last year I had Rahr &amp; Sons Whiskey Warmer, their Winter Warmer recipe aged in oak barrels, and loved what the oak and bourbon did to smooth and add to the flavor.  My friends kept a bottle for several months, and recently tried it, reporting that it was nowhere near the glory they recalled.  One of my friends works at the brewery and said they had been told that beer was not for aging, but that one released this February, Snowmaggedon, would be.  At the brewery I tasted Snowmaggedon that had also been aged in the same barrels, and it was delicious, however the bottles I acquired, while still very good, had not been aged in the barrels.  I specifically noticed what appear to be oxygen barrier caps on these new bottles, so my question is, does bourbon flavor inevitably fade quickly from beer?  Was what my friends noticed more likely due to oxygen slowly getting in to inferior caps? "
451,What ale yeasts can closely approximate the clean and crisp characteristics of lagers?,"I'd like to brew a black lager.  I don't have a temperature control setup yet, so accepting that my fermentation will be around 68-70 F, what ale yeasts would come the closest to mimicking the clean and crisp characteristics of a lager, or is this possible?  Would adjusting pitching rate/aeration help? "
452,Is primary fermentation finished?,"I'm making a doppelbock with an ale yeast, so I'm fermenting in the mid- to upper 60s. It's 11 days in and all the krausen is gone. The top is speckled with what appears to be bright white yeast colonies. Do I wait to bottle until those are gone? I don't have a hydrometer, so I don't know the gravity situation. I don't see any bubbling or particles moving around, like I could for the first week. The instructions for the recipe simply say to let it ferment a minimum of 2 weeks. Will I hurt it by letting it ferment longer if the surface hasn't cleared up, or should I be safe to simply bottle at 2 weeks? "
453,Does irish moss affect the amount of yeast left at bottling?,"I made a brown ale kit and used irish moss  in it for the first time. After putting it in I realized that I had misunderstood my LHBS and added 1 tablespoon instead of one teaspoon. I left in primary and secondary each for a week to get the eggdrop soup in the fermentors to settle out.   Three weeks later in bottles at 70F they still have very little carbonation. I have tried rolling them every three days for the last two weeks and still no change.   Could the amount of irish moss have caused some of the yeast to get trapped in what fell to the bottom? And the time honored question, after three weeks at those temps and rolling the bottles, is this all the carbonation I could expect to see? "
454,How low can a beer's final gravity be?,"Approximately how low can the finishing gravity of a beer be?  I've been brewing from kits for about 10 years, and went all-grain last year.  I wouldn't expect to see anything lower than 1.006 or so, but my latest blew me away -- it was somewhere around 1.000!  I couldn't believe my eyes.  Has anyone else seen an FG so low?  (BTW, the yeast was Wyeast 1762, and the SG was 1.066, and table sugar contributed probably only about 1.010-1.015 or so.  The grain was all pilsner, and I mashed at about 65 C.) "
455,What's the difference between 2-row and 6 row base malt?,"   Possible Duplicate:   What&#39;s the difference between 2-row and 6-row malt?       I've been brewing all-grain for several years, but have been using recipes and kits. I'm starting to develop my own recipes, using the process outlined in ""Designing Great Beers"" by Ray Daniels, but it's not clear to me what the difference is between 2-row and 6-row base malt.  When should I use one vs. the other?  What are the advantages or disadvantages of each? "
456,will i end up with flat beer?,   Possible Duplicate:   recapping my bottles? Will it ruin the outcome of my beer?       I was wondering if my beer will end up flat no carbonation because i ended up recapping the whole batch. I recapped the batch after i didnt have enough in the bottles. So i poured more in two days after bottling to top them off so i wouldnt have any explode on me.. The main thing that im worried about is that they will not carbonate now?  
457,"Sweet sparkling cider without pasteurizing, sulphites or lactose","We've got an apple tree that produces more fruit than we know what to do with, so being cider lovers, we decided to get into brewing.  Our first batch of cider was very dry so we've been adding sugar after opening which is a pain.  We want a slightly sweet cider that is still alcoholic and are looking for ways to either interrupt the ferment early without ruining the sparkle or sweeten the mix prior to bottling that won't cause an explosion.    I'm alergic/paranoid about sulphites and my wife is lactose intolerant.  I've read pasteurizing negatively affects flavour.  Sulphites and pasturising may also prevent priming...  My cider book makes a vague reference to racking off twice as a way to eliminate yeast and interrupt/slow the fermentation process to produce a sweet cider.  Can anyone explain this?  Or can anyone offer a better suggestion?  TIA, Luke "
458,What happens when beer freezes?,"After a bit of trouble with a thermostat on a 2nd hand fridge, I discovered that my latest batch of bottled, ready-to-drink brew had frozen.  What happens to beer when it freezes?  Will the taste be affected?  Does the level of CO2 change? "
459,What's the flavor profile of Bravo hops?,Have you used Bravo hops? What kind of bitterness/aroma do they confer? 
460,"How do you come up with a recipe to use for ""Second Runnings""?","I recently brewed a Stone Russian Imperial Stout clone, per their official recipe in Brew Magazine.  After collecting my wort, I was draining my mash tun and was saddened to see what appeared to be a perfectly drinkable stout in the making going down my alley.    When you make a really high gravity beer, specifically by increasing your mash not just increasing your boil, and you choose to make a lower gravity beer from the same grain, how do you come up with a recipe?  Do you usually aim for a similar taste, with the same types of hops and yeast?   "
461,Is leaving some cider in the primary bad?,"When bottling my cider (FG 1.000) I ran out of bottles and saw this as an opportunity to flavour the remaining third and try racking.  I added some boiled cinnamon and clove then left it for a day while I got around to purchasing a second carboy.  It occurred to me that this may have been bad when the cider turned brown and, I swear, developed a heavier mouth feel.  I suspect drawing in oxygen through my water lock as I bottled may have started it turning to vinegar.  Could this or anything else bad happen so quick?  (we used apples from our tree with no potassium metabisulphate)  To rescue the situation, I racked the 5 litres to a smaller carboy, begrudgingly adding half a tablet of potassium metabisulphate to kill off anything bad and added a small amount of brown sugar to initiate a small secondary ferment to push the O2 out of the head.  I used brown sugar because i figured the caramel would go well with the cinnamon.  I also decided to back-sweeten with a small about of splenda (to taste).   The contents of my glass carboy looks thick, cloudy and dark.  It concerns me.  Were these measures appropriate?  How long should I expect the secondary ferment and clearing to take?  TIA,  Luke "
462,Needs to be mashed,"I recently had a debate with a brewing buddy of mine about malts that ""need to be mashed"". For instance victory malt is listed in Palmers ""How to Brew"" as being in the needs to be mashed column.  I can understand that there are unconverted starches in the malts and mashing them makes fermentable sugars, blah blah blah.  Base malt certainly needs to be mashed because it normally consists of 80-100% of the grist.  But if you were putting victory malt in at the rate of 5% or less.  What starch load would you really get?   If you made a base wort and steeped 5% of victory in a 6 gallon batch would a starch test even show positive?  What does it matter at such a low amount.  What makes victory different than say crystal or chocolate malt, that it needs to be mashed when we are using them for small flavor or color adjustments?  Victory can't self convert, but neither can Crystal 60.  So what does it really mean ""needs to be mashed""? "
463,What does sour mash do for a sour beer?,"I've only recently been introduced to the glory of sour beers, and I love them.  As a club, we're going to be brewing a sour beer to be aged in oak for years to come, so I was curious to see some questions on here about sour mashes.  It sounds like the process is still similar, you're collecting bacteria and wild yeasts (we'll be using a commercially available combo pack), but is there an inherent value to doing this pre-boil?  Is this simply a way of getting the sour you want and then stopping the process? "
464,Why did my Oktoberfest turn out so light?,"I recently did my first batch of beer: Oktoberfest (True Brew kit).  Brewed up the wort, fermented and bottled to a T.  When it came time to open I was immediately encouraged by great aroma, great color, carbonation and head retention.  I was certain I had done everything right according to the recipe and had achieved a great beer.   Upon tasting I was slightly disappointed by a less characteristic light flavor.  I'm wondering what I did in the process to cause this?  The beer is not bad, just not at all what I expected, very bland.  Perhaps it's the brew kit itself? I usually expect my Oktoberfest's to have a richer full bodied flavor while this Oktoberfest drank more like a very light bodied smooth Amber Ale.    Some important notes: The gentleman at the home brew supply store switched out the initial Lagering yeast of the kit and replaced with an ale yeast so it could be fermented and bottled as an Ale would be versus as a Lager at cooler fermentation.  My wort was more concentrated, I believe 2 gallons in full, and then added to 3 gallons of water.  Fermented for 9 days, aged in bottle for another 10.    Just want to know what I need to correct in my methods before moving forward with my next batch, I am expecting greatness here, but realize the time it takes to achieve it.  I appreciate any response in advance, thank you!  Ryan. "
465,End of Fermentation?,"I emailed this to the Mr. Beer beermaster, but I figured I'd ask here as well.  For my Doppelbock 7.0, this Sunday will make it 3 weeks in the keg for fermentation. The previous beer I made was a pale ale, and I let that one ferment 3 weeks also, and waited to bottle until the surface cleared up. The doppelbock krausen cleared up after about a week, and at about the 1.5-week mark I noticed the surface was speckled with a lot of bright white spots. I assumed it to be yeast colonies, but unlike the yeast colonies for the pale ale, these spots haven't changed since I noticed them. They haven't grown or shrunk. Is this yeast? Is it bacteria? Should I wait to bottle it until it goes away? Is the beer infected? I tasted it, and it didn't have any horrible flavors, though I did notice a decent amount of hop particles in the glass. Is that something that will settle as I bottle condition it? I have been able to keep the temperature between 66 and 68 degrees throughout, except that the first 2 days it was at 56 degrees. "
466,What causes cloudiness in beer?,I've brewed up a few batches of extract beer so far &amp; all have come up crystal clear.  I've just sampled my first batch of beer (ginger ale) that's come up quite cloudy.  What causes cloudiness?  Is it intrinsic to certain styles or is it a byproduct of certain conditions?  Or both? 
467,How full can I fill my bottles?,My first few batches of beer have come out quite undercarbonated.  I believe because I've been quite cautious about how far I fill my bottles up.  This comment backs up my theory.  How can I determine the maximum level to fill my bottles?  Is it related to desired CO2 volumes or should I leave CO2 decisions up to priming sugar? 
468,How long do you boil liquid to be used in a beer?,"I believe this is perhaps only one question, but there are a few different situations, namely   to make a water/DME mixture for a starter, how long? to prime with a sugar water mixture, how long? to prime with gyle (4-6 week old wort from the boil), how long?   I ask because I had been boiling for only a short period, a couple of minutes. I came across an EPA recommendation for 1 minute, or 3 minutes for high altitude (I am at ~6500ft where water boils at 200F), but also found some brewing sites recommending between 15 and 30 minutes. What I haven't found is why the times are different. What I suspect is that common bacteria are killed at 1-2 minutes, and perhaps more of the bacteria brewers are concerned with might take more, but I haven't found anything to support this. A friend pointed out there are some spores that survive 5432F rocket exhaust, so I understand you are never going to be completely sterile, but would like to understand why the guidelines cover a range and be able to make an informed decision about how long to boil.  "
469,Is there a Material Difference between Fermwraps and Non-Branded fermwraps?,"Here is a ""Carboy Heater"" from Adventures in Homebrewing.  Here is an ""Electric Fermentation Heater"" from Northern Brewer.  I just learned yesterday that ""Fermwrap"" is a product from MoreBeer. Looking at the pictures, the Fermwrap looks identical to the non branded products, but I've been able to find the non branded products cheaper than the Fermwrap.  I went ahead and bought more Fermwraps just to be consistent with my previous purchases.  However, are they perfect substitutes for each other, or is one superior? Has anyone tried both? "
470,Two tens to One twenty,"I am thinking of brewing a 20 gallon batch in two parts on two different days back to back. Has anyone tried this before? I am dealing with  a maximum volume of 15 gallons in my brew pot but, my fermenter will hold up to 24 gallons. I'm thinking if I treat each batch as it's own and add the second days batch to the first's I should be ok right? Should I use my normal yeast pitching rates for each batch or, adjust the yeast for the total volume and pitch on the first day?   "
471,How to prepare Hop Tea?,"How does one make a ""Hop Tea"" for taste testing?  I am trying to get a better understanding of different hop flavor profiles. I have heard of making hop teas to do taste tests but I wonder if it's easy as it sounds (hot water+ hops-steep). Has anyone done this, and if there is more than one variety what can be done in between each variety to cleanse the palate? "
472,Do I Always need to add Sugar when bottling?,"I'm doing my second brew after great success with the well documented Brooklyn Brewshop Everyday IPA.   This time is the exact opposite, random recipe and random grains. I went to a brew shop and had the guy make me a 1 gallon Irish Stout kit for St. Paddy's day. I found a recipe online for a coffee Stout and made it a little less than 2 weeks ago. It's time to bottle but it doesn't say anything about adding priming sugars. Is it standard that these always need to be added? Or do the chocolate roasted malts have the sugars already. Also how will I know when it's ready after bottling? "
473,Should I use lemonade or soda pop when making a summer shandy?,"So I am making a wheat beer and am adding lemons and oranges into the second stage of fermenting. I have heard through the beer vine that shandy's are lemonade and beer. Can I just add the lemonade or the soda pop before the bottling, and can it substitute the priming sugar? Also what would you recommend pop or lemonade?  "
474,Does oxygen introduced during bottling get consumed by the yeast during carbing / conditioning?,"I was just thinking about oxidization at bottling time...  If you (accidentally) introduced oxygen into your beer when bottling, wouldn't this be used by the yeast the same way it is when you oxygenate your wort before fermentation?   IE, wouldn't any oxygen in your beer merely be used by the suspended yeast to multiply before the yeast switches back over to anaerobic metabolic pathways and begin to consume the sugars? "
475,What's the best technique to add chamomile?,"I've made a Witbier with tangerine peel and coriander. Though Randy Mosher's Radical Brewing suggests chamomile as a good ""secret ingredient"" for Witbiers, I didn't have any on hand when brewing, so i missed my chance to add it to the boil (and I've wondered how well the taste and aroma would persist anyway).   So now i have a few options:   Add it directly to the secondary (akin to dry hopping), maybe after a little boiling to avoid introducing bacteria Make some chamomile tea and add that at bottling Make a spice potion with vodka or the like, and add that at bottling time   The question: which is most likely to impart the best taste and (secondarily) aroma? And how much would you suggest for a 5 gallon batch?   I want it to still taste like beer, not chamomile tea, but I'd like to impart a reasonable amount of flavor to the result.  Concerns I respectively have for the the above options are:   I'm not sure the essence will get released without boiling.  I've seen other recommendations for this, with some complaining the result was too strong.  I've seen one opinion elsewhere that this spice potion approach doesn't wind up producing much flavor.  "
476,Adding yeast to secondary,"Okay, I am making a strong (imperial-ish) red ale. My original gravity was 1.081. I intended to bring it to a final point at most of 1.020, or if I can even lower.  I was using 2 packs of WLP004 (Irish Ale Yeast). According to reviews it is possible to reach 8-8.5% of ABV with it. After 5 days fermenting process stopped and for last 5 days there was no activity. The gravity stopped at 1.030 and the ale a little bit too sweet.   The temperature of the carboy was within 64F-68F depending on time of the day. I am considering adding more yeast and keeping a temperature at 68F-69F (by using a heating belt at night).  Should I add WLP004 or can I use different one and combine them with WLP001 or WLP07? How much should I add? What are my other choices?  I'm kinda of trying to finish the bath in 2 weeks and condition in bottles for another 3 weeks and serve it by the first weekend in April...   Thank you for your help.    Thank you, everybody. I found an answer. Apparently, the rest of the sugars in my beer are not fermentable. I tried to run the recipe through the recipe calculator, and it says that with WLP004 the final gravity would be 1.029. If I used WLP007 it would get to 1.026.  With IBU of 86 and 1 week of dry hopping with 1oz of Simcoe, it is not bad. Not quite what I was hopping to get, but still good (I'll just call it a know-how).   I will be more accurate next time.  PS. I don't have enough space for full grain, thus I'm doing extract beer. With less control over my wort, it is little bit tricky.  "
477,Questions regarding ingredients specified in recipe,"I was interested in brewing this recipe but I have a couple of questions regarding the grain used.  0.5 lb. crystal malt, 50° Lovibond 0.5 lb. toasted malt, 25° Lovibond   Does this refer to crushed grain because it's an extract brew?  For the toasted malt - would this be a good substitute?     Available at last: the real Belgian BISCUIT malt. This very   light-roasted malt with only 50 EBC of colour, gives a biscuit/bread   aroma to your beer. Use 5-15%.   Also it says:     6 lbs. gold light malt extract   Does this refer to plain old light malt extract? The site I order off doesn't seem to have specifically ""gold light"". "
478,Conversion efficiency,"What is the typical conversion efficiency during a normal single-rest mash (152 F/67 C, 3 l/kg)? I usually get around 80 %, but Braukaiser claims that it should be close to 100 %. I mash for 60 minutes. "
479,Is a yeast starter required for this recipe,"According to brewers-friend, I am short 139 billion yeast cells for a recipe I was estimating. I was planning on trying something along the lines of this recipe.  My original idea was to re-hydrate a packet of Safale S04 and chuck it in. Most of my brews had an F.G between 1.010 to 1.015 but I have not brewed a beer with this high of an O.G  Is brewers-friend being a bit conservative with their estimates or should I take some action to guarantee a good F.G?  Thanks! "
480,Benefits of cold crashing vs risks of moving fermenter,"I have a gose fermenting now that should be ready to bottle this weekend.  My homebrewing setup is very new (I've only been doing it for about 3 months), so I don't have temperature control during fermentation.  However, my basement is very cold this time of year (40-50°F).  I'm considering moving the fermenter (plastic bucket type) from my kitchen down to the basement for a few days in the hope that the lower temperature will improve the clarity of the beer.  How risky is it to move the fermenter near the end of fermentation?  I'm worried that moving it down the stairs will cause sloshing and aeration, or disturb the trub and nullify any clarifying effect from the chilling.  I added a Whirlfloc tablet near the end of the boil, does that reduce the benefit of cold crashing? "
481,Sanitizing with bleach without rinsing,"What concentration of bleach (or Sodium hypochlorite) diluted in water is necessary to sanitize bottles?  How much time is necessary to keep the bottles immersed in the solution, or is sufficient to use a bottle washer that squirts the bleach inside of the bottles (commonly used with 'no-rinse' sanitizers like Star San, alcohol, etc)?  How much time is necessary to wait until the bottles can be used (filled) when not rinsed? "
482,Does Dry Hopping create a white film with bubbles?,"Might be a weird question!  I have brewed, with a friend, 6 batches of beer so far. An IPA, then a Stout, a Saison, a Doppelbock, an Baltic Porter and finally, the same IPA. All grain, always.  Of all these, only twice we had that weird white film over the beer in the carboy, in the second fermentation. It comes with a few white bubbles. there are some lines of that white that are traced, a little bit like a spider web.  Either we got infections in both, or... the dry hopping creates that? Is that possible?  At least I know now that even if it's an infection, I just bottle the beer underneath the pellicle :)  EDIT: Here is the picture   "
483,Capping fermentor for carbonation,"I'm just doing some reading, and it mentioned capping the fermenter to carbonate the beer by trapping the remaining co2. Has anyone given it a go? What were the results? "
484,Does skunking only occur after fermentation starts or finishes?,"I've had discussions with other home brewers who claim that a bi-product (which I've admittedly since forgotten what exactly it was) of fermentation conflicts with the hops to cause skunking of beer.  I've always thought that skunking happens immediately after the beer goes into the carboy, but then it occurred to me that so many brewers are doing their hop additions outside on a burner in broad daylight.  Where is the line drawn?  Does ultraviolet rays cause skunking from the minute they're added to the boil kettle?  Does the beer have to ferment (or begin fermenting) in order for the beer to become skunked?  What is the scientific reason behind beer getting skunked? "
485,What can I learn from fruit beer gravity?,"I just bottled a batch of a watermelon beer where the gravities going into and out of primary matched the predictions (OG 1.050, FG 1.012).  I added watermelon chunks in secondary and when it finished I had a gravity of 1.007.  Can I use this new number to get a new higher ABV (5.6% rather than 5.0%)?  Does this just mean that the water from the fruit diluted the beer that much?  What impact do the sugars from the fruit have? "
486,IBU above 100... how bad is that?,"First of all, I didn't really plan to make a beer with IBU above 100... I popped the hops into the calculator and it came out about 85. So, after the brewing the beer I was going over the printed out recipe, and found that the hops schedule was not reflecting the reality... I recalculated the IBU according to my steps, and it came out as 120 (that is what happens when you put Magnum and Columbus at 60mins of boil).   Anyway, I'm not against hops, and I love hoppy IPAs and DIPAs with tons of hops (I'm a hophead and an addict, I know). However, I've read that a human won't be able to taste bitterness of IBU above 100... In other words IBU 100 and IBU 150 would taste the same... Is it the case?   Will it be bad? Can I neutralize the over-bitterness with any additional ingredients into secondary like oak cubes, maltodextrin, caramel or crystalized honey? Or I just should not worry about it and just enjoy it like an extra bitter IPA?  Thanks guys.   PS. I am documenting every single mistake I make, and so far in 7 batches I didn't repeat any of them twice.   PPS. It was supposed to be an DIAP/IPA with 7.5 ABV, 80 IBU, and 20 SRM.  "
487,Why does Irish moss go in at 15 minutes?,I've always added the Irish moss at 15 minuted left in the boil like I was told when I started. But I'm wondering now why 15 mins? what happens if its in for a couple minutes longer or what happens if its in for a whole hour? or on the other side is it effective as a 10 or 5 min addition?  
488,"After the Ice Bath of the Wort, should I pour the sludge from the kettle into the carboy?","I am just an extract brewer; I buy everything from NB. The instructions say:  ""Fill primary fermenter with 2 gallons of cold water, then pour in the cooled wort. Leave any thick sludge in the bottom of the kettle.""  I typically follow this instruction, but it seems odd to me. I can see from the colorization that there are traces of hops in there.  1) What is the point of this?  2) Should I continue to do it? "
489,Is there a need to stir the kettle at some regular interval while boiling the wort?,"I extract brew. After I boil the three gallons of water, I take the kettle off the stove and pour the sugars in, and stir under I'm convinced it has all been dissolved. Placing the kettle back on the stove, I wait until it boils again before I pour in the bittering hops. At this point I do stir a lot, perhaps 3-5 minutes, to make sure that no ""solid"" part of the hops (I get pellets) would get stuck to the bottom of the kettle.   I do not stir at any time from here to the next hop schedule, where I repeat the 3-5 minute stirring.  Should I be stirring every N minutes, or does it not matter?  Does it matter whether it is extract vs full grain? "
490,"Yeast ""cake"" after bottling","I recently bottled this recipe, last Sunday (2014-03-09). I popped one open today, and it is damn tasty, and even decently carbed after less than a week. However, all the bottles have about a half inch of yeast on the bottom!?  My last batch never carbed up enough, so with this one, I made sure to suck up some of the yeast cake (primary fermenter, no secondary). I don't think I sucked up enough yeast to cause this much in nearly 50 bottles.  Does the yeast continue to multiply while bottled? Is the major yeast in the bottles just a result of what I sucked up into the bottling bucket? I've had previous batches, both with and without secondaries, that carbed up just fine with nearly no settled yeast.  I'm just wondering where did this 'cake' in my bottles come from?  EDIT: I used 4 oz table sugar in just under a 5 gallon batch at about 72F, if any of that makes a difference. "

492,Homebrewing and Cats,"I am somewhat interested in obtaining 2 kittens.  My 1 bedroom apartment already isn't the cleanest. I spray 409 and Windex on all my surfaces before I brew or bottle and call it clean. I'm not going to spend any time picking up cat hair.  If I greatly prefer homebrewing to animals, should I abandon all hope for a pair of cats? What methods exist to minimize the damage from animals to homebrewing in a one bedroom apartment?  I extract brew now but intend on moving to full-grain in the next 3-6 months. "
493,"Rye and sulfur (burnt rubber / skunk), how to explain the connection?",I've come to beleve that brewing with Rye often leads to undesired sulfur based 'burnt rubber' off-flavours. I'm pretty sure about it but I only have the following indirect evidence:   have recently had two Rye IPAs with burnt rubber off-flavour found no less than 10 beers using Rye with comments about rubber on beer advocate and ratebeer found quite some forum discussions where Rye and rubber are mentioned together   If I'm right I wonder why there isn't any information about this to be found anywhere in the net.  Have you seen this combination? Do you know why it happens? Does Rye somehow promote sulfur based off-flavours? 
494,Will More grain in a partial mash give more body to my IPA,"I enjoy IPA's and I think I've made the best one to my taste so far.  The only thing that concerns me is the amount of grain that I used in this recipe, as it was only 1/2 lb of Belgian Aromatic Malt.  It has 6.6 lbs of light LME, half at the beginning of the boil and then the rest at 30 minutes, no DME and uses Warrior hops for bittering up front during the boil and then Cascade 45 minutes into the boil and then Citra with 5 mintues remaining. The body is just a bit light, would more grain help this a bit? This is so good for an easy recipe, just wondering if tinkering would help? Thanks.  Quentin "
495,How does oil inhibit head formation? Do citrus oils inhibit head formation?,Two part question:  (1) How does oil inhibit formation of head in beer? Homebrewers take as gospel that oil-containing ingredients such as nuts will negatively impact head. But I can't find any articles or other materials explaining how and why this is true. I am trying to understand the chemistry of how this works.   (2) Do citrus oils (from citrus zest or orange peel) inhibit head formation? Randy Mosher says that in his experience citrus oils do not affect head. 
496,How much coffee (approx) would go into a 2 Gallon brew?,"Im new to homebrewing (this'll be my 3rd batch ever, but only my second with this kit) using a Mr Beer 2 gallon kit. Im making an American Porter (from extract) and want to impart some coffee flavors into my beer. Ive read on here that the best method for adding coffee to beer is to cold brew the coffee, and add it at flameout or into my fermentation tank. Im currently only using a primary.  Most of the questions/answers Ive seen on here are in regards to 5 gallon batches... About how much cold brewed coffee should be added to my primary fermentation? Should I add cold brewed coffee, or just put the beans into the tank? "
497,I am planning to brew a GRUIT,"In the life of each home-brewer there is a moment when he decides to do something crazy (like gruit). I understand, that chances of me making a drinkable gruit are pretty low... But.. you know.  I already got a nice selection of dried leafs and flowers that are used in cooking (like making disgusting and not so much teas). And I'm trying to experiment with just boiling it as a tea (just like my grand mother used to do).  My question is...  What should I use instead of bittering  hops? Did anybody actually tried to create an alpha-acid chard for herbs other then hops? "
498,A recipe for a White IPA calls for dextrose and lactic acid. What are they used for?,"For my next brew, I'm brewing this Deschutes Chainbreaker White IPA clone recipe using LME as described at the bottom of the page. I'm unfamiliar with the use of lactic acid and dextrose in brewing and I'd like to understand what's going on a little more with these new ingredients.     For 5 gallons (18.93 L)         5.25 lb (2.38 kg) | pale LME   2.5 lb (1.13 kg) wheat LME   5 ml | lactic acid   0.75 oz (21 g) | Bravo pellets, 15% a.a.

Why would I want to add extra sugar (dextrose) instead of more malt/extract sugars? (Bonus question) The all grain recipe calls for white unmalted wheat flakes. Would steeping those grains before the boil add anything to the character of the beer?   Thanks! "
499,Will blending a highly attenuating yeast with a highly alcohol tolerant yeast cleanly lower the final gravity in a very high gravity ale?,"I've brewed some ridiculous beers in the past, my highest original gravity resulting in over a final 18% ABV using WLP099 yeast.  That particular beer turned out well for how inexperienced I was when I decided to go crazy with that, but I wanted to revisit the idea.  My thoughts were to try and brew a crazy, Quadruple IPA (I totally just made that style up, since some commercial breweries have brewed up to whatever they defined as their ""Triple IPA"").  In order to get anywhere near the distinguishable hop character, I need to get the final gravity low.  My intent is to have at least a 15% ABV beer, with well over 100 IBUs, and no higher than a 1.016 final gravity.  I'm hopeful that 1.016 is just enough body, that it will assist the hops with masking the alcohol.  The obvious concerns that I should be able to deal with are:   Mash tun capacity  Expenses for all the grain and dextrose  Several aerations throughout primary fermentation Controlling fermentation temperatures to subdue esters and alcohol burn   What I am uncertain of is how to ensure I get a clean fermentation out of it.  What I initially had in mind was to start the fermentation with an adequate dosage of White Labs' San Diego Super yeast (WLP090), of which I'm a huge fan of for clean ale strains.  I would pitch a sufficient starter to see the entire fermentation through.  According to Mr. Malty, for 6 gallons at 1.130, that's 2 vials at 2.66 liters (using a stir plate).  This would ensure that I have at least enough of WLP090 to pull me through should it need to.  The catch is, I'd also blend in any equally sized starter of White Labs' Super High Gravity Ale Yeast (WLP099) approximately 72-96 hours into the fermentation.  I figure at this high of a gravity, over-pitching is better than under-pitching, and I can make up for the lost IBUs by throwing more hops at it.  I've noticed that the ester profile of WLP099 increases at high gravity, and I want the IPA to be hop forward instead of ester forward.  That's why I'd allow the ester-subdued WLP090 handle the majority of the work, and allow the WLP099 finish up what the WLP090 couldn't.  My questions regarding this are, when taking this approach, using a 2 vial/2.66L starter of WLP090 at the start, and another equally sized starter of WLP099 at the 72-96 hour mark, will the ester profile remain subdued, will the beer still ferment low given how the WLP099 will likely out-ferment the WLP090, and are there any complications I haven't outlined above that will throw a wrench in the bucket?  Will the lesser alcohol tolerant ale strain cleanly ""crap out"" when it hits its max or will it throw crazy, unwanted esters?  Would I just be better off using one of the two strains?  Is the attenuation of WLP099 going to be negatively affected by allowing WLP090 to chew on the wort beforehand?  Any advice would be appreciated. "
500,Fermentation Schedule on a Biere de Garde,"-TLDR version of the questions:  How long could/should you keep fermented beer on the yeast at 72 degrees after reaching an appropriate final gravity before racking/bottling to minimize off-flavor compounds (I’m particularly gunshy about diacetyl and acetaldehyde)?  -Does biere de garde benefit from cold-crashing, and if so, can I cold crash on the yeast, or do I need to rack to a carboy?  I brewed a 55 gallon batch of biere de garde with my homebrew club this past Saturday.  We came out a little light on FG (1.061, compared to recipe target of 1.068), and also had an issue with our plate/pre-chiller set up, and only got most of the wort down to the mid-70’s/low-80’s.  We split up the wort (each guy got 5 gallons).  I had to leave early, and the guy who hosted pitched a cup of Brewer’s Art Resurrection (dubbel) yeast at about 75 degrees, and kept it in his basement, ambient temp of about 70.  Came back a day later, fermenter temp was about 75 with vigorous airlock activity.  Took my fermenter and another for a fellow member and put them in my ferm chest, and dialed back the temperature.  Per Jamil’s recipe, I set the controller to 66 degrees, and placed the probe on the outside of my fermenter (ale pail) with styrofoam/tape on the outside to insulate it from the ambient temp inside the ferm chest.    Jamil says to raise the fermentation temp by one degree or so per day once fermentation slows until you are at 72.  As I noticed airlock activity slowing (I didn’t take a gravity reading) two nights ago, I let it creep up to 67, then 68 last night.  I plan to take a gravity reading tonight.  Also, in Chris White’s book, he notes that a great technique achieve proper attenuation is to pitch on the warmer side (mid/high-70’s), let fermentation start, then ratchet it back to your desired temp (as we did here, somewhat accidentally).  The only caveat is that if you do this, you need to raise the temp back up at the end of fermentation to clean up these compounds.    Here are my questions: I have been operating under the wisdom that as homebrewers, we should not take beer off the yeast for at least 2 weeks.  Even if the krausen subsides and FG is reached, leaving the beer on the yeast can ONLY benefit the beer (autolysis seems to be less of a concern with today’s yeast strains).  However, I am new to temp control, and I know commercial brewers regularly have primary fermentations in the 6-7 day range.  Also, I would like to cold crash this for at least a month.  Should I take it off the yeast before doing so?  "
501,How much yeast nutrient does starter wort need?,"I am going to make a batch of wort to be stored in 1 quart jars to make starters from.  I'd like to add the yeast nutrient (diammonium phosphate and yeast hulls) at this time so I don't have to mix it when making the starter.  How much (per gallon) should I use?  The directions suggest adding 1/2 tsp per 5 gal of wort when making beer.  Since I don't know what I'll be brewing in advance, I'd like something that works for as many different types as possible.  Is there a difference in the amount of nutrient needed for, an ale starter vs. a lager starter or a 1 stage vs. 2 stage starter? "
502,"Wheat Ale ""stuck"" at 1.025?","I am trying to brew a stronger wheat ale, and after 9 days in primary, I seem to be stuck at 1.025. My OG was 1.070 and I pitched a smack pack of Wyeast Bavarian Wheat at about 70F. I had a very vigorous early fermentation (first time i've every had to use a blowoff with a bucket), and fermented at a little higher than usual temps (averaged around 72 degrees). My question is, can I kick start the fermentation at this point to knock off a few more points? I would ideally like to end up around 1.010. I've tried swirling the bucket to stir up the yeast a little, but I don't want to go crazy and accidentally oxidize or taint it at this point. Here are some things I was considering:   Boil a few ounces of water and mix in some yeast food and add that to the primary Buy another smack pack of the same yeast, and add it to the primary Both 1 and 2   Any thoughts? Is it even worth it at this point? I tasted my sample after I measured the gravity, and it was delicious, so I don't want to ruin the batch. I just wanted to try to make a non-traditional stronger wheat ale.  Thanks in advance, Ryan "
503,Can wort layering significantly affect OG reading?,"A few days ago I brewed a 5-gallon recipe with the following fermentables:   8 oz Crystal 20 8 oz Crystal 40 One 3.3 lb can Briess Munich LME 2.5 lb Light LME   Beer Calculus predicts an OG of 1.046.  For the first time in years, I got distracted for a moment and there was a boil-over. This is an annoying complication to my question (which is coming below). I don't believe too much was lost during the boil-over. I know I started with about 1.5 gallons of water when I mashed the grains. After removing the (waterlogged) grains and sparging with maybe a quart of water, I added the syrups. After the boil-over, I noted that I still had about 1.5 gallons in the pot. Now, having cleaned up the mess, I'd say about a pint of wort was lost to my stove top. When I consider the water that would have been removed with the grains, I feel like these numbers add up, but I'll let the experts weigh in on that. If I'm right about losing a pint when there were 2 gallons total, that would reduce Beer Calculus's OG estimate to about 1.043  So I finished my brewing, and topped off the carboy to 5 gallons. After I pitched the yeast, I took a gravity reading: 1.030. That seems incredibly low! At first, I told myself that the combination of losing some concentrated wort during the boil-over and a low efficiency from the mashing might explain it. So I told myself whatever happens will happen with this batch, and I went to bed.  But this morning I had another memory/realization. My girlfriend and I both noticed a ring about 1/3 of the way up in the carboy after the brewing. It was a ring of particulate inside the wort. I thought that was neat - there was a little meteorogical system in the carboy. Liquid of a heavier density had settled to the bottom and the particulate was floating on top of it. Possibly relevant - I used Irish moss in this batch (1/2 tsp for 10 min) which I do not normally use.  So I wonder: could my low OG reading be (in significant part) because I sampled from the top, where the less dense liquid was? Or is this just wishful thinking? I've never before seen the layering I saw with this batch. Does anyone else see that in their recipes? "
504,Carbonated in carboy from primary fermentation?,"I recently brewed a batch and let it set in the carboy for 2 weeks. When it was transfered to the bottling bucket we noticed that it was a little carbonated already, which seemed odd. We ignored it and proceeded on to keg it like normal.  It measured a FG of about 1.002. Which was another red flag but it was not insanely lower than the projected 1.008.  The really odd part was when sugar was added to the keg for it to prime. Right when the sugar was poured into the beer it started overflowing the keg, and sort of foamed but mostly just gushed out, and was pretty neat/messy.   Any ideas what could have caused this effect?  We tasted the beer used to calculate the FG and it tasted good. No noticeable off flavors. One thought was that we did mash at 144, but I don't see how that could effect the carbonation.   Since I am writing this question a few days after the case and have had time to think I wondered if it could have been that the 3 piece was partly blocked from foam but not enough to push it off? I did not notice any hiss, or oddities from the 3 piece when I opened it, although I had ""tasted"" a few brews by that point.  EDIT: fixed FG to take temp into account. "
505,Using a low alcohol tolerance yeast in potentially high alcohol must,"i have posted this question on other forums but haven't really gotten a good answer.  If I am attempting to create a sweet mead and want to avoid backsweetening (lots of additional tweaking) or killing fermentation at a certain point (lots of putting my hands in the fermenter, as a beer brewer something I'm not super comfortable with yet). Can I use a lower alcohol tolerance yeast?  Based on my calculated OG (this may change) I'm looking at 1.122. This is capable of fermenting up to around 15.6% abv. I'd like to stop it around 14-15%. If I use a yeast with a tolerance of 14% (Lalvin 71B or d47), this should leave a significant amount of sugars in the mead by the time the yeast gives out, right? Sugar left means sweet, and the luscious mouthfeel I am looking for.  So what would the impact on the yeast do? Fusel alcohols? Off flavors?  Trying to fumble through this and most of the reading I've found (compleat meadmaker, wild about wines, and the gotmead forum) doesn't do really cover intentionally using a lower tolerance yeast. "
506,Advice for converting to outdoor propane brewing,"Right now I'm a stove top partial mash brewer. I have a 4 gallon pot that I use as my HLT, a 5 gallon igloo cooler as my mash tun and a 7.5 gallon Polarware kettle.  We are moving out of our apartment and buying a house and I will finally have the opportunity to brew outside and do full boils and start transitioning to All-Grain brewing. Our house only has a car port instead of a garage, but I will have a large storage shed in the backyard to store my equipment, so I want to make sure my set up is portable so I can move it to the driveway easily on brew day.  Ultimately I would like to upgrade to the Blichmann Top Tier system. I like keeping things gravity fed for the time being (I've seen my friend struggle with his pump at times on his Sabco system and don't want to deal with that for now). I would turn my Polarware kettle into my new HLT, switch my mash manifold over to a 10 gallon cooler and I would start with a new kettle, either the Blichmann 15 gallon or a 15.5 gallon Keggle. I want to be flexible enough to do 10 gallon batches in the future. I know I would have to redrill a hole and move the thermometer down on the Blichmann for 5 gallon batches. Anyone have a suggestion on either one?  And since I want to upgrade to the Blichmann Top Tier in the future I was thinking of getting a Blichmann burner with the 24"" leg extensions. Has anyone used one of these? I'm just wondering if it is tall enough to drain my HLT into my cooler and then drain the kettle into the carboy or would it have to be propped up even higher for it to be gravity fed? Right now I use an immersion chiller, but in the future I would like to get the Therminator and then I believe I would need it even higher then the 24"" that the burner legs extend it. I guess prop it up in cinder blocks would work?  Anyone else use a single burner system right now that has any suggestions? I figure one burner will work for now where I can heat up my mash water and drain into the cooler, put the cooler on a table and drain the cooler into the kettle while my batch sparge water heats up on the burner. Drain the the sparge into the kettle and then move the kettle to the burner once I have all of my wort collected.  Any and all suggestions would be greatly appreciated! "
507,Freezer-pack-based cooling,"I haven't done any brewing this summer because when I brewed some mead last summer, my apartment was very warm during the days, and I think this higher brewing temperature was related to some solvent-y flavours that some people detected in that batch.  I'd like to start a batch now to be ready later in the fall, but it's still rather warm (gets close to 30C indoors in the daytime) in my apartment. I don't have a budget for a temperature controlled fermenter. I make small batches (5 Litres) and the fermenting jar will fit nicely into a small picnic cooler. My plan was to put a few freezer-packs into an inch of water inside the picnic cooler to lower the temperature overnight and then put the fresh wort in the next day (in contact with the cold water at the bottom to keep it cooler). I imagine I'd have to change the freezer-packs twice a day.  Is this a good idea? I know that the process of fermentation itself will generate a little bit of heat and while I don't think it's enough to overwhelm the freezer-packs and overheat the inside of the cooler, I'm not 100% sure about that. Has anyone used this method before? Does it work (or sound like should work), or should I wait for cooler weather? "
508,Doppelbock fermentation and lagering question!,"Iv'e got a Doppelbock 1.090 brewed 7/19. Pitched the Whit Labs ""X"" at 60 deg. Placed the  carboy in the fridge (first time trying a lager fermentation). Two days later the beer was at 44-46(thats the highest temp I can get my fridge), fermentation was ok (again I'm used to ale temp fermentation), krausen was in between an inch and a half of an inch. I currently use a ""blow-off"" and the air bubble was always below the water level but never at the bottom of the tube. On the 31st (12 days later) my gravity was 1.050 so I decided to warm up the sluggish(?) fermentation by taking it out and wrapping it in a blanket (slow warm-up). Well we had a little heat wave here in Washington and according to the stick-on thermometer temp is now at the last square 76 deg. (currently 1.030)  So my question is what can I expect, and what can I do? fermentation was more then 50% complete so at this point, so am I reducing diacetyls quicker at higher temp or did I not take it far enough? I'm assuming putting it back in the fridge isn't going to do me any good.  I am also looking for advice on lager conditioning as well, this will be one of my wedding beers so I really would like it to be more then good (wedding 9/29)  Thanks for the help guys!! sorry about the length of this question  "
509,Top Cropping Cell Counts,"TLDR:  I have no idea how much top-cropped yeast to pitch into a ~1.055 OG Octoberfest (5.5 gallons)  I am planning on making an Octoberfest (late I know) on August 18th.  Instead of making a boring old starter, I decided to spring for some ingredients and use up the Northern Brewer hops in my freezer and make a steam, which I will do on August 10th.  While different from San Fransisco Lager Yeast, Wyeast's bavarian lager has very similar characteristics (and is likely distantly related) to the SF lager yeast typically used in steams.    Anyway, I'm planning on making a 1.5L starter + yeast nutrient with the BL yeast (smack pack), pitching in the low 60s for the steam.  Then I am planning on top-cropping as much as I can at high krausen (24-36 hours?) off the steam, harvesting into a sanitized mason jar, and pitching that into my Octoberfest Lager at around 50 degrees.    this being my first lager, I am obviously worried about stressing the yeast, excessive sulphur production, etc., however the proprietor of my LHBS told me that it was not advisable to pitch onto an existing yeast cake.  I had heard this wasn't a good idea (but not a horrible idea), as there is a lot of other material in this (dead cells, trub, etc.), but he mainly cited the fact that if you overpitch, the cells won't need to grow, and they will actually competitively crowd each other out/kill each other (!).    I am left with a few alternatives:  1.)  top crop and grow a 1.5-2 L starter for the Oktoberfest 2.)  top crop and pitch as-is (maybe a cup?)  EDIT:  someone on another site just commented that I won't be able to top crop since this is a lager yeast.  aka.  a BOTTOM fermenting yeast.  Even if there is a krausen, it doesn't sound like it will have huge amounts of yeast cells in it.  Maybe I'll just reserve some of my steam starter and do a second starter...making this entire exercise circuitous and pointless.  Gotta love homebrewing! "
510,"Yeast, CO2 Toxicity with mead and beer","Degassing CO2 during early fermentation is important for wine and mead. But why not for beer?

511,harmful mold growing in fermentation freezer?,"I have a freezer that I use for temp control.  However, it's been unplugged all summer and its growing mold.  Is this going to be harmful to my respiratory system for me to open and clean it?  What precautions should I take?  "
512,Yeast Washing - danger in long seperation times?,"I attempted my first yeast washing last night after bottling. I added 1 quart of boiled-then-cooled water to my carboy, swished the yeast cake into suspension, then filled 2 quart jars, each about 3/4th's full. After about 30 minutes there was maybe 1/2"" of seperation. At this time, I really needed to get to bed so I let it sit overnight. In the morning (about 7 hours later) there was a lot more seperation, but the top layer was much clearer than any of the videos I've watched online.  My question is, is it possible too much of the yeast fell out of suspension? Also, I'm confused if there is anything else that needs to be in the jars besides water and yeast cake. Does it need nutrients?  "
513,How quickly can you pull beer through a jockey box with a 70' coil?,"I'm looking at building a jockey box with a 70', 5/16"" (21.3m, 8mm) stainless steel coil (installed in a drum-style cooler.) Seems to be a good compromise between size, weight and cost.  How quickly can I pull cold beer out of it without it foaming?  My back-of-envelope calculation says a 2133.6cm by 0.8cm coil holds &pi; &times; 0.42 &times; 2133.6 = 10723 or just over a litre of beer. The Mythbusters say you can cool a six pack of beer in five minutes with salted ice water, so I'd interpolate that one beer per minute would be achievable.  Can anyone confirm my theory with experimental evidence? "
514,What difference does the crush make for steeped grains?,"I'm wondering if I need to be mindful of how well my grains are crushed if I'm just using them for steeping.  Do I need to get my LHBS to crush my grains or use the rolling pin / bag method?  Or can I just whiz them in my coffee grinder?  Does it matter how crushed they are?  What harm could I cause if I end up with a fine powder?  In this question, Denny mentioned a couple of things: that the crush is less crucial, but also that sticking to 1.5 qt/lb (~3L/kg) is important to regulate the pH for steeping.  Does this change up or down based on how the grain is crushed?  My coffee grinder is fairly inconsistent with it's grinding, so if I over / under crush I'd like to adjust if it's necessary. "

I have seen recipes for making starters using honey, but here's the thing: Honey is expensive.  Malt extract is cheap(er).  I would rather make a starter (which I intend to pour down the drain) with malt extract than honey.  Would this have detrimental effects on the resulting mead? "
516,What causes fermentation to slow down under normal conditions?,"I've got a honey wheat ale in the fermentor, 8 days on it. Wyeast 1010, 1.5L starter. OG 1.054. Temp controlled chest freezer at 65F.  Fermentation appeared to start well, the blowoff hose was gurgling like crazy. I went away for a few days, when I came back the hose was still active but much quieter. On day 7 I took a gravity reading of 1.022.  Given the conditions I would have expected to be closer to FG (1.012-14) after a week. I haven't had such a slow fermentation before, though I haven't used 1010 before, nor do I often brew with honey. I roused the yeast and am now another 2 points down so I know it's not stuck. I'm disappointed because I was hoping to have this beer in the keg by this weekend.  Are there any clues here as to why this fermentation is so slow? I couldn't find any evidence of 1010 being slow, and it seemed so happy the first couple of days. I can only think the problem is in my recipe or process. Maybe after chewing through the honey, the bulk the yeast didn't switch over well to the maltose? "
517,Bringing mash pH down without changing mineral profile too far,"I checked the pH in my mash at the end of my mash yesterday and it was 6.6 (using a calibrated electronic meter).  I'm trying to work out how to get that down into a more normal range without adding so much salt that it throws the water profile off the charts. I measured my water without any additions, and it read 7.2.  I had my water tested by [Ward Labs][2] last year:   pH 7.4 Sodium, Na 10 Potassium, K &lt; 1 Calcium, Ca 46 Magnesium, Mg 11 Total Hardness, CaCO3 161 Nitrate, NO3-N 1.3 (SAFE) Sulfate, SO4-S 6 Chloride, Cl 14 Carbonate, CO3 &lt; 1 Bicarbonate, HCO3 146 Total Alkalinity, CaCO3 120 Total Iron, Fe &lt; 0.01   I'm using the EZWaterCalculator spreadsheet. Recipe is a 7 gallon mash, 7# of 2-row, 10# of wheat malt, 1# of carapils, 1# of aromatic.   According to the calculator, estimated mash pH is 5.94.  I can get that down around 5.6 by adjusting the Gypsum, Calcium Chloride and Epsom Salt, but I have to add so much that the ions in the water profile go way, way over the recommended ranges. And that's still quite a bit lower than the actual reading of the wort.  Do I have other good options for acidifying my mash and staying within my water profile? Are there other calculators out there that will take them into account? "
518,Ways to better utilize hops with a coffeepress?,"I am thinking about trying to utilize the hops I use better by combining late addition and early addition via a coffeepress.  The basic idea is to make a hops-tea in the coffeepress, let it sit for maybe 5 minutes, then press the hops down and pour the tea into a sanitized bottle/bucket and then add the hops from  the press to the boil for the full 60 minutes.   What I hope to achieve is to preserve the aromas you get by late-addition but still get the full bittering out of it.  Has anyone tried this? Would I be combining advantages or disadvantages with this method? "
519,Fermenting mead: low vs high temperature,"I'm planning to make a batch of dry show mead (white wine experience). I have Lalvin 71B-1122 Narbonne yeast, and fermentation temperature range for it is from 59-89° F (15-30°C).   Lets say how different would be my mead (if I'm using lets say Orange Blossom Honey with OG~1.100) if I ferment it at 60F vs 85F?   What's the benefits of using colder temperature vs warmer?  Thanks guys. "
520,How bad can this be?,So i got everything in my fermenting vessel last night and i got up this morning to find that the siphon lock was pushed in. I tried to slowly pull it back up through it's opening but the siphon lock's o-ring came off in the botton and  now its in tje beer. Should i reach in and get it? I am concerned because i think i pitched it too hot. I was a bit tired when finishing up. But i was sure the siphon lock was up last night.   My main concerns:   Because my siphon lock was removed some time in the first 24 hours... Is my beer screwed? if i reach in or use a spoon to get the o-ring... How bad is that? do i need to pitch the yeast again? i think i pitched it at 95. This was out of impatience and not finding my thermometer before i pitched.   Any advice on saving my beer would be nice.  Thank you in advance. 
521,Peaches in Cider,I have about 8 jars of peaches in light syrup I bought from Costco.  I want to add these to a 5 gallon batch of Cider. I'm going to a peach cobbler flavored cider. I'm also planning on adding brown sugar. Should I prep the peaches in any way? Do I add these to secondary? What should I be looking out for? Am I crazy? 
522,Will Sparkolloid slow or stop fermentation?,"Background: My wife drinks cider like a fish drinks water and buying cider at the store was leaving me pretty much broke. The LHBS turned us on to the idea of making our own a couple years ago so we gave it a whirl. Preservative-free apple juice and a Wyeast Cider smack pack yields a decent dry cider that is super easy to make. The best part about it is that she will drink it without much fussing (She is normally pretty fussy about food and drinks). The worst part about it is that it takes a long time to clear. To get a clear product faster, I tried my hand at adding Sparkolloid when there was probably about 10 gravity points left in fermentation. About 8 hours after the addition, it appears that fermentation slowed significantly, nearly stopping. I'm not talking about just the air lock not bubbling as much. The production of CO2 bubbles coming out of the cider itself has nearly halted.   So - did Sparkolloid have something to do with the slowed fermentation? I'm leaning towards no since I could not find anything supporting this idea on the www, but figured I would ask you experts.  Bonus question - When is an appropriate time to add something like Sparkolloid to wines and ciders? In my beer production, I normally just add Irish Moss near the end of the boil and I've never had a turbid batch. "
523,What hop will give me grapefruit-like aroma?,"I'll be making American Wheat beer this weekend. Simple malt bill - half wheat, half barley. I'm planning to use Chinook for bitterness. What would go well with it's resin and ""coniferous forest"" quality, to add a bit of citrus taste and grapefruit aroma? I'm open to dry hopping and don't mind using different hops for last minutes of boil and dry addition. I just don't know which ones to use.  My bets so far was:   Centennial Cascade Simcoe   Is any of them any good for this purpose? In this specific combination? "
524,Can I bottle a beer at 1.028 gravity?,"I have a beer which may or may have finished fermentation. I read about ""stuck fermentation"" and am wondering if I ended up with not enough fermentable sugars.  According to the calculator if i bottle it now it'll still be 3.5%, so very weak, but potentially still recovering a beer out of it.  Or is this one for the drain?  The recipe was a dunkelweizen all grain jobby.  It's been in the fermenter nearly 6 weeks now.  I did try pitching another yeast, but nothing really happened, a bit of gas was given off, but then it just stopped.  The OG was 1.056. How do I know if the mash conversion was complete? I hit the OG that the recipe recommended so I took that as a good sign...  The fermentation temperature was about 18 degrees.. but i've hooked up a brew belt to bring it up a bit just to see if there is any life left. "
525,Should I use Fermaid-O or Fermaid-K while fermenting mead?,"I've been making a mead for last two years, and a huge supporter of staggered nutrients additions to mead where you use Go-Ferm to rehydrate the yeast, adjust pH level with potassium carbonate, and some pectin enzymes with fruit additions.   Also, I'm using Fermaid-K and DAP on days 2-4-6 when the yeasts are strong and healthy enough.  I've been reading that a new trend is substituting Fermaid-K for Fermaid-O (O for organic).   I'm not quite sure how much Fermaid-O should I use per gallon. Since it doesn't contain any DAP in it, amount of DAP should increase, but buy how much?  How much of DAP should I add on days 2-4-6 per gallon?  Since there is no DAP in Fermaid-O it can be added all at once on day 0... What's the appropriate amount?  Oh, and the main question, is it worth it substituting Fermaid-O for Fermaid-K at all?  Thanks, guys. "
526,Alcohol tolerance of wild yeasts,"Here's a question... I have made a cider with wild yeast (whatever was on those apples), and after fermenting it out, I used the same yeast to ferment a session mead (OG~1.060, FG~1.004, ABV~7.3%). It gave a really cool and interesting touch to the mead (much better then original cider).   So, after that I've been thinking, about making a stronger mead. Just out of curiosity, what could be the tolerance of those wild yeasts?   I kinda can guess, that it can go up to 15% (as most of the Saccharomyces), but it would be interesting to find out, what exact strain was growing on the apples (isolated to the Northern California region), Saccharomyces paradoxus?  "
527,Has anyone ever tried soaking grains in bourbon instead of water before smoking malt? Any advice is appreciated too,"I'm going to brew an applewood smoked Märzen and upon doing some research I found some brewers have sprayed their malt with bourbon instead of water during the smoking process to keep the grain moist, this gave me an idea.   My question is: what would be the outcome if instead of the pre-soaking the grain in water prior to smoking you pre-soaked the grain in bourbon or something similar? Has anyone ever tried this or perhaps has any insight on what flavours if any would result? I'll probably try it anyway, but any point of view is appreciated. "
528,How Long to Dry Tubing After Sanitizing?,I use Five Star's iodophor sanitizer. The instructions say to let equipment fully dry before using. This seems almost impossible for plastic tubing. Even after a couple of hours there is still noticeable liquid inside the tubing.   Will this small amount of iodophor liquid affect taste? Should I rinse with hot water before using?  
529,A 15 gallon batch with two 10 gallon mash tuns,"I need to split a 15 gallon batch of beer three ways.  The brew is going to be an Imperial Stout, and the 5 gallon recipe calls for 20lbs of grain (60lbs for 15 gallons). Between the three brewers we have a enough equipment to boil 10 and 5 gallons separately, but my concern is the mash.  We only have two 10 gallon mash tuns.  30lbs of grain in each plus the water won't fit.  If we max out the water and hit our mash temp:   Can we just fly sparge the rest in order to achieve our volume?   Will our mash efficiency take a huge hit or will we get relatively close to our pre-boil gravity? If our mash efficiency does take a hit would mashing longer allow for better conversion?   I know equipment is a factor in efficiency but I'm just looking to see if this is a reasonable approach. "
530,What would cause bottle-carbonation to fail?,"I made a Hydromel (beer-strength mead) around 5% using champagne yeast. After fermentation I split it into a few small batches... some I added ginger, some I added orange zest, some remained un-modified.  After leaving for a while, I then primed it all and bottled. But for some reason while the un-modified version carbonated very nicely, the orange-zested one has remained totally flat. I don't know if the orange could be to blame, or if it's more likely the way I bottled it could have killed the yeast?   What are some common/likely reasons that bottle-carbonation wouldn't work, given that the sugar levels were the same? "
531,can you suggest a recipe for these hops and fermentables?,"I can only find German pilsner malt for brewing in my country. I can find fuggles, saaz, brewers gold, cascade, Syrian,target 2014,HALLERTAU HERSBRUCKER types of hops. and I can find most common fermentis yeast types. what would you brew? or what recipe can you suggest to me with these ingredients? "
532,What to do when american wheat ale turned out to have too high extract?,"I used to have a problem - too much water due to extracting every last bit of sugar. That gave me 90% to 95% efficiency, but also it was a lot of work to boil it down to manageable and usable amounts of wort.  This time I aimed at 70%. I created my grain bill to target 12 Brix (around 1.048 OG). It was simple, 2.5 kg pale ale and 2.5 kg wheat malts. I only sparged to get my 30 liters of preboil volume and then let the rest go to the sink. ""Sadly"", it turned out I did things generally better and yet again - I hit about 16 Brix (1.065) at the end. It seems I still managed to get 90% to 95% sugars, in less water. Good thing, but:   I do not have capabilities to pitch two fermentors now. I plainly refuse to waste such a good wort. For american wheat it'll be too strong. And I really wanted it to be a session beer.   On the bright side, hops I added should bring it to around 35 IBU (here I was intentionally out of style), so even with increased maltiness it should be balanced.  What are my options now? Is fermenting it as is a good way? Do I really have any alternatives?    It was time and past time to pitch it, but I still want to know what I could have done. Answers telling focusing on fermentation as is would be especially valuable, but I'll appreciate all of them - even ones I can't use now. "
533,Conical verses flat based fermenters,"Just to ask what is the general feeling of using a ""Conical"" fermenter rather than a normal flat based fermenting barrel.?                                                    I realize that you cannot use a heat pad, so would have to use heat belts.                See they have 2 valves to the base, one being to drain the beer/yeast sludge with the one above for the transfer to bottling ?                                        Be good to understand other brewers experience's of all this fermenting. "
534,Is Amber Malt suitable to use as a primary grain?,"Wikipedia says about Amber Malt the following...  Amber malt     Amber malt is a more toasted form of pale malt, kilned at temperatures   of 150–160 °C, and is used in brown porter; older formulations of   brown porter use amber malt as a base malt [2](though this was   diastatic and produced in different conditions from a modern amber   malt). Amber malt has a bitter flavor which mellows on aging, and can   be quite intensely flavored; in addition to its use in porter, it also   appears in a diverse range of British beer recipes. ASBC 50-70/EBC   100–140; amber malt has no diastatic power.   What exactly does that last part mean? Does it mean Amber Malt does not give off enough sugars when boiled and is therefore not suitable for use as a primary grain?  The website I bought it from said nothing about it not being suitable as a primary grain. "
535,Keep Homebrew Fresh,Just syphoned a youngs 30 bottle kit into a plastic 5 gallon fermenter. How should I store this to stop it going bad? What's the highest temperature it can be stored at safely? and how can I ensure air doesn't get to the wine (I'm assuming as CO2 is released from the wine it should act as a buffer?)  Should I really be bottling the wine? In the past I've found that a day or so after filling up a bottle of the stuff it's gone nasty (I suspect due to air exposure) and the sheer volume in the fermenter keeps most of it away from oxidation  Any tips would be appreciated 
536,Is yeast cell count a constant function of starter size?,"Does the size of a starter always dictate the cell count of yeast irregardless of how much yeast you started with (ignoring other factors such as aeration, wort density etc)?  For instance let's take two scenarios:  1) I have a 100 mL starter with the cell count of 2 billion. I created a new starter that is 600 mL. I now have a cell count of 8 billion.  2) 1) I have a 100 mL starter with the cell count of 1 billion. I created a new starter that is 600 mL. I now have a cell count of 8 billion.  The math isn't necessarily correct because I forget how it all works, but what I'm trying to illustrate is that no matter how much yeast you started with your always going to have a constant cell count based on the volume of wort. Is this true? "
537,Why does my beer keep getting better the longer I leave it to rest?,I was amazed at how much better my home brews are getting from just leaving them be? Why is that? How exactly can the flavour of beer  improve by just leaving it alone in a non-reactive container? I would love to learn the science behind this phenomenon.   I started with a kg of oats. I decided I wanted to know what coco powder would do in beer? I also thought I would like to know what a few coffee grains would do. So I added them.  I only did a 45 minute boil no hops. I usually do an hour but simply put the African heat got to me. I used an ice bath this time and after adding the yeast I left it over night.  The next day I tried some before I went to bottle but was somewhat disappointed. The coco made it extremely bitter. I also realised that the coco powder I used was a energy type of drink.  This meant it had a whole list of minerals in. This seemed to me to add a very harsh bitter  taste to it. I was almost ready to consider the experiment a failure but to my surprise I tried some today and the harshness seemed to mellow out a great deal. Also the taste of the oats is now much more prominent.  It was amazing to me how big of a difference one day could make. I'm tempted to leave it for a week. 
538,Anyone has experience with Brewolution Brewster device,I talk about this device: [website]It's 28 liter kettle. What is a max output volume if I do allgrain? I have 20 liter fermenters. How to chill the wort to 25C in the output of this kettle? The sparging step uses wort from the kettle or new water from outside? Did you see any video instructions for it?  Thanks 
539,Sour Ale With Pedio but Without Brett,"In planning for a sour ale with peaches and apricot, we did a bit of research on the microorganisms typically used for making sours and put together a recipe for a fairly basic pale ale with Saccharomyces, Brettanomyces, and Pediococcus, adding the fruit during primary.  Our local homebrew shop, however, was out of Brett but we were able to pick up everything else, thinking we'd just use the pedio. After some additional research though, it seems that Brett is practically seen as a requirement with pedio due to its heavy production of diacetyls.  Should we hold off on brewing until we can get Brett or is there something else we can do to help limit diacetyl production?  Is this something that could be addressed with a diacetyl rest (maybe in combination with pitching additional yeast?)? "
540,Calculating alcohol percentage after diluting with a sugar syrup,"I am making Limoncello, I have added 8 lemon zests to 1 liter of 96% alcohol and put everything in a big glass container.  After 1 month I started making the real liqueur by diluting the alcohol down with a sugar syrup. The sugar syrup consists of a dilution of 800 grams sugar in 1 liter of water.  I've put the big container on a scale, used the tare button to put it to zero. In all my silliness I've decided to use the scale/a weight factor in order to 'measure' my dilution - so I went on and added 1 kilogram of my sugar syrup.  I think that the next time it would be better to measure an amount of 1 liter of sugar syrup instead of 1 kilogram - but I am still thinking about this.  Now I am calculating like crazy, but I cannot really figure it out. The most simple and erroneous calculation would be to say:  1 L alcohol + 1 Liter/Kilogram sugar syrup = 2 Liter/Kilograms 1 L alcohol = 96% 2 L mixture = 96 / 2 = 48%   But I know this is wrong. I however cannot figure out how and why this is wrong. Diluting alcohol with water will work this way, I guess. But the added parts sugar to the water makes it hard. So the questions are:   How much alcohol do I have in my mixture? How do I calculate alcohol percentages after diluting with a certain sugar syrup concentration?  "
541,Recycling Screw-top Bottles for Homebrew,"With my budget being somewhat limited I can only really afford to put my wine into sanitised used bottles from store bought wine, rather than proper bottles with corks. My main concern is oxidation and I'm wondering if I'm better off keeping the bulk of my wine in the fermenter (all cleared and syphoned - ready to drink) until I come to drink it?  As my wine is still fairly carbonated is there a way to ensure the head-space of the bottle would be purged of oxygen? or will it always be a matter of time before it goes sour?  Thanks "
542,Wine time frame?,"I set a 1gallon shiraz kit going this afternoon, this is my first wine. I have sealed the demijon with a bung and put an airlock in.

Or any sort of visual confirmation that the fermentation is actually working?  "
543,Will it be too cold to brew in my garage over the winter?,"I was thinking of asking for a Homebrew Starter kit for Christmas this year and would like to set it up to brew and ferment in my garage.  However I am wondering, will it be too cold to brew beer or ferment in the garage over the winter? I am based in the UK, so it will get pretty cold.  Would I need to get some sort of heating in the garage to be able to successfully brew beer? Or should I start the process in the house, before moving it to the garage?  Any advice would be much appreciated.  Gareth "
544,Warming up a demijohn / carboy,"As a continuation to my previous question about a very slow fermentation of sloe wine, I think my demijohn is just too cold where it is. I haven't taken readings - I'm still fuzzy on how - but judging by its activity I'm sure there's plenty of sugar left and not too much alcohol.  Can anybody suggest a safe way of warming it up, without it getting hot enough to harm the yeast? It's too big to fit in the microwave. :)  Once it's warmed up, I assume it will keep its heat for a while? I know after boiling the fruit up, it took until morning before it was even cool enough to add the yeast. "
545,Can you brew using a mini Yorkshire Square?,"Is it possible to brew using the same method as a Yorkshire Square but at home? Since the entire thing is open to the air, it seems like it would be a lot easier to brew like this instead of spending all that time sterilizing your equipment (which actually raises the question, how does this method of brewing even work?!?)   "
546,No-rinse acid sanitizer - is there a risk?,"My homebrewer friends recommend the StarSan acid sanitizer, hands-down.  I tried it once and it foamed everywhere and left a bunch of rings in the carboy and the bottles.  It made me paranoid that it would ruin my batch, but the beer tasted fine.  Ever since, I have been wary of using it because of all the foam.  Is there any risk associated with leftover acid sanitizer in your beer?  What happens to the phosphoric acid and dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid?  Are there trace amounts of it in my beer? Has anyone had a bad experience with it?  Am I doing it wrong? "

549,How would one go about growing their own hops?,"Ignoring the downsides (Hops: buy vs. grow), how would one grow hops in their backyard?    I know that it grows 30 feet tall and that you cut it to the ground in the winter, but how do you get started with growing your own plants?    How long would it take and how many plants would you need if you wanted to brew one small batch of beer each year from your home grown hops?    I live in the north-east.  Is it even practical here?   "
550,What is the best way to store hops?,"I recently got a really good deal on some bulk pellet hops (several pounds).  What is the best way to store them?  I've heard that they should be vacuum sealed and put in the freezer.  Will they be OK for 6-9 months if I store them in a zip-lock bag without being vacuum sealed?  I've also started growing my own hops in the backyard.  I don't get much yet, but I'm anticipating the yield increasing over the next few years.  Do the same storage rules apply to dried whole hops?

551,Why my homebrewed lager beer bottles explode?,"I started home-brewing lager beer last year. I am using ready-kits and the first three times it went quite well.

I tried to open other bottles and they had a LOT of ""air"" inside an a lot of foam came out.  What could have been happened? What are the possibilities of this behavior? "
552,Carbonate beer in a plastic keg,"I am using a 5Gal plastic keg with a brass valve at the top that takes co2 syphon bulbs. The beer has been in there for about a week and i have used 2 bulbs on it so far, but still has no carbonation to speak of. The ambient temperature is about 5-10 C  Do i need to use more bulbs to get some carbonation into the beer?  How many would be a goof number to use? "
553,Fermenting Soda,"Years ago I attempted to ferment Mountain Dew (about a decade ago so my recount of the details may be a bit off).  My goal was to have a drink with similar carbonation, similar flavor, and reasonable amount of alcohol.  Talking with some coworkers who were amateur wine makers, they suggested using a champaign yeast.  I took a 5 gallon carboy, filled it most of the way up with Dew, added yeast, and added granulated sugar until it was sugary enough for that particular yeast to thrive.  I don't recall how much sugar was added but I was shocked that the Dew itself didn't register high enough by itself when tested.  When the fermentation was complete, something to make carbonation was added, it was bottled, and put in a cool dark place for a month or so.  When I finally tried it, the results were a bit disappointing.  There was a flat, yeasty, slightly bitter &amp; alcohol taste, but the Dew flavor was almost nonexistent.  All in all it was a fun experiment that I couldn't wait to try again.  My questions is this... I got a Mr. Beer kit as a gift and I thought about trying my ""Dew Brew"" again.  Is there anything I can do to get better results (more of a Mountain Dew flavor with better carbonization)?  Do I need different equipment?  If the problem was that the Dew was already fairly diluted (relative to most pre-fermented liquids) would it work to go get a bag of the syrup that is used in soda fountains?  thanks! "

555,How do I brew with nuts? Specifically hazelnuts.,"I want to make a beer with some hazelnut flavor to it. Maybe add some cocoa nibs or powder to the wort and make a Nutella-ish beer. My question itself is specific to hazelnuts, but maybe you could enlighten me on how to brew with all types of edible nuts?  My questions/concerns are:   How do I prepare the hazelnuts for the beer? Would I roast them in the oven first? I'll need to de-shell them first, correct? Will the fat content cause the beer to spoil? That what makes Nutella so delicious of course, but fat in beer sounds terrible. Is there anyway to avoid that? When would I add them to the beer? Mash? Boil? Secondary? Depends?   There are probably other things that I'll need to consider. But if anyone could help me out from experience, it'd be much appreciated. "
556,"Proof dry yeast, or just pitch it?","In the past, I've used Wyeast smack packs, where the instructions tell you to make sure that the pack is viable before opening so that you can get refunded for a dud.  I'm a baker, and I use dry yeast all the time in my dough.  When I bake, I always proof (that is, let the dry yeast incubate in tepid water for a few minutes, to ensure viability).  Many people say this is no longer necessary, so maybe it's a bit of a rain dance, but I figure that it's better safe than sorry.  Yesterday, I brewed with a pack of dry Muntons Ale yeast, and right after adding the initial LME to my boil, I took the yeast out to proof in a glass of tepid water (where it sat until the cooled wort went into my primary).  My question is: for those that use dry yeast, do you ever proof before pitching?  Is this a good idea or a bad idea? "

Do they impart different characteristics or are they all pretty much the same?   Fructose Glucose Sucrose Dextrose Maltose Lactose   and any other ones I may be missing.  Also, what are the common sugar sources composed of and what makes them different (what bad/good flavors or characteristics can they impart in your beer)?   Malt Corn sugar Honey Table sugar Candi sugar Corn Syrup Molasses   again, mention any other ones I may be missing. "
558,Do I need to completely fill my keg?,"I'd like to make some smaller batches in order to test recipes, but without the hassle of bottling multiple different beers. The whole process of sanitizing and cleaning bottles takes too long if I'm going to be frequently brewing small test batches. So this brings me to my question:  If I were going to force carbonate 1 gallon of beer in a 5 gallon corny keg, what do I need to know?  What's the best way to expel the air that would be in the keg? CO2 has a higher density than air, correct? Could I just fill the keg with CO2, open the lid, pour in my beer and then increase the pressure to the appropriate level?  Would there be an increased chance of infection? Would it age poorly? Is there any adverse effect of having a large amount of CO2 head space in a keg? "
559,Drink made from fermented lemons?,"I had a neighbor who would bring out a large, 5-6 gallon? glass jar full of lemons(not sure what else was in there) outside for a little bit a few times a week. I know he was making some kind of fermented drink and that it took at least a hand full of months before it was ready. I want to try making some, but sadly I have moved away and I don't even know what it is called.  Anyone have any idea of what something like that would be called?    I don't think it was lemoncello, it would be strange to make it with whole lemons.  "
560,Carbonating Kegs In Quantity,Does anyone have any suggestions for how to build a rig to carbonate multiple corny kegs at one time?    I currently have a high pressure CO2 line in my beer fridge so that I can carbonate one that is cold.  That leaves me at times with only two beers on service pressure while I wait for a new keg to chill and carbonate.  I'm looking to turn a corner of the room into a carbonating station where I could hook up multiple kegs at one time (maybe four or five).  Is there anything special I need to know about building a setup like this?  Extra equipment?  Issues with multiple styles of beer exchanging flavors through the CO2 lines? Etc.? 
561,5 or 6 Gallon Glass Carboy,"I'm looking to pick up a glass carboy, but I'm not sure which size. I brew in 5 gallon batches (just starting out) and I'm wondering if I should go with the 5 gallon or 6 gallon carboy.   Thoughts? Advantages of one vs another?  "
562,What type of reference beer should I use for flavor doctoring?,"I've been looking for resources on how to really taste some of the commonly referred to tastes out there. For instance, people say that phenols taste like band-aids. But I really have no clue what that means.  There are off flavor taste kits available for purchase, but those run around $150, which seems a bit high. But luckily I ran across a nice table in the BJCP study guide which would allow me to doctor beer in order to give it the off flavors that I'm looking to experience.  So my question: What type of reference beer should I use? The guide suggests using a clean lager which seems to makes sense at first. But the main reason for me learning these tastes is so that I can get better at picking them out of the beer that I make. And  rarely make a clean lager; I normally make stronger ales. Should I use one of my homebrews or get some commercial equivalents?  Bonus for anyone that's had experience using the BJCP instructions and could speak from experience. "
563,Can I ferment mead without campden tablets?,"I think that campden tablets lend an odor to my mead that requires my letting the wine breathe for a while. I get headaches from this too.   Assuming I'm right about this, would pasteurization of the must a viable option? Can I use less than the recommended amount of campden tablets and be safe? "
564,Glass Milk bottles?,Just about to start up my next batch and noticed I hac a couple glass milk bottles from Whole Foods lying around. In what ways could they be put to-use in homebrewing? Fermenting a test? Mead? Cider? Maybe just as an alternative when bottling? 
565,I went from bottling to refridge,I bottled then right to refrigerator. What can I expect? Been in the fridge for about 2weeks.Is the Beer lost?Can I remove it now or is it to late? 
566,How to use the hydrometer?,"How do I properly use a hydrometer? How much unfermented wort do I put in the vial to get a good original gravity, possible alcohol by volume reading? "
567,Clarity Ferm Date Stamp,I've got a package of Clarity Ferm with 2 dates stamped in ink on the back of the package:  NOV 11 2016    JUL 22 2017   I bought it from an online retailer about 4 months ago (March 2017).  Does anyone know what to think about the dates?  Should I use it by JUL 22? 
568,Pre-boil volume when doing a separate boil-down,"As per this recipe for a Belgian Dark Strong Ale, I'm brewing a beer where it's suggested you take a portion of the pre-boil wort, and boil it down separately to create a syrup to add back to the main wort later.  Given this, how should I calculate my pre-boil volume?  Should I...  a) Use the same pre-boil volume as usual, but take a portion of this to boil into a syrup  b) Create a larger than usual pre-boil volume, to cater for the amount I take away  c) Just add some boiled top-up water at the end to compensate  d) Something else  ?  I all-grain BIAB, and would need 9.75L (90 min) pre-boil wort for a desired post-boil vol of 6L  "
569,Making Jam with Fruit Pulp?,  As you can see I've got my mixed berry wine pulp. It has sugar mixed in and a liter of water. My question is: Can I use the pulp left over to make jam? Has anybody attempted this? 
570,About reusing spent grain,"I tried to make dog biscuits with my spent grains, but it was not a big success ;-)  I read that we could make more beer reusing the grain again.  I liked the idea of making a lighter version of the beer this way.  If I make an all grain stout, what can I expect to be able to do by reusing the grain?    1- Can I only add some more 2-row to a new mash to raise the OG, letting the flavor and color coming from the crystal and chocolat malt that was already mashed once?  I believe I would get something close to an amber beer. 2- Or is it possible to just batch sparge again and start from there?  Anyone has tried this? "
571,"Fat residues on bottles or glasses, causing bad head retension: how to dissolve and remove it?","I have a rather concrete issue for those of you well versed in the chemical sciences:  The situation  I know for a fact that most of the bottles I am using have been contaminated on the inside with vegetable oil during label removal. In retrospect, my situation could have been easily prevented, but in the mean time I do have hundreds of sub-optimal bottles that I badly want to use. I want to dissolve and remove the fat to make the bottles usable again.   The questions   Is fat dissolution possible while retaining the integrity of the glassware?  Which detergents or chemicals should i use, and what is their actual effect?  "
572,Process and timing to detect a stalled fermenation in order to add more yeast (repitch),"Working with a 1.060 original gravity wort, mashed at 152F, and using the WLP565 Dupont yeast (that is known to stall), when should the brewer investigate if adding a secondary strain of yeast will be required?  Is there a rule of thumb or accepted practice that suggests if X% of expected attenuation is not complete by Y days, then attenuation will very likely require a very long time?  Of course there are various options for the brewer, such as raising the fermentation temperature, removing back pressure, or simply waiting for the fermentation rate to start again.  But this question is about the earliest point where the brewer might know with reasonable certainty that action is going to be required to get the beer to quickly completely attenuate, and what to do at that point.  The default process is to take multiple gravity readings, and when the slope doesn't change from one measurement to the next, then it's time to take action.  But is there a way to ""know"", right away, by taking just one, properly timed measurement?    With this yeast, there are many brewers reporting ""stuck at 1.030"" or ""stalled at 1.035"", which are roughly only 50% or 60% of expected attenuation, but it's usually after a few weeks of frustration and multiple measurements.  Given that in a typical fermentation curve, the majority of the attenuation occurs in the first six days, when should I take the measurement that will indicate a stall, and above what value would indicate a stall? "
573,How big of a batch can I brew on a 16k BTU burner?,"I'm very new to this but home brewing is something I always wanted to try but never got around to it. I have my first batch fermenting made with a PicoBrew Pico appliance which is very nice but I think I might want to try making bigger batches using the brew in a bag method at times as well.  I don't want to go the turkey fryer route and hoping to be able to boil indoors on my natural gas range. My largest burner is 16k BTU, my second largest is 15k BTU. I don't want to use two burners.   What's the largest all grain boil I can do indoors on my 16k burner in a reasonable amount of time?   I'm hoping 2.5 - 3 gallons would be doable in a 5 gallon pot but curious as to what others manage to do indoors.  Found these calculators: For BIAB water volume [website]Also found this calculator for time to boil water. [website]Does that sound about right to anyone that does smaller batches indoors? "
574,"Fermenting Cow's Milk, or making Kumis","Playing around with making my own yeast cultures, one of them has is white while fermenting. That started me thinking, ""can I ferment Cow's Milk?"".  One google search later there is Kumis, made from Mare Milk. But I am not sure how to go about it. This seems to be a nice list of steps:   Get milk. Get enzyme that makes Glucose from Lactose. Maybe add some more glucose. Add yeast to the above. Maybe add yogurt culture, to use the fats and proteins. Let ferment for x hours / days. Strain out solid bits. Enjoy drink.   Will this work?  "
575,FastFermenter System,Is anyone using fastferment conical with the temp jacket to eliminate secondary fermenter?  I am having trouble maintaining my temperature according to the instructions.  Does anyone have a suggestion to maintain a lower temp? 
576,Adding Ingredients to an IPA Kit,"I am a home brewing newbie from the UK.  I have made 2 batches so far; my first was a 1 gallon IPA kit using grains which I was relatively happy with for a first attempt; the second was a 40 pints IPA from a tin which whilst drinkable, was disappointing.  I would like to move into adding my own ingredients to a 40 pints kit (yeast, hop, etc.) but don't really know where to start.  The reviews for this kit [website]What ingredients would people recommend that I add?  Can anyone suggest recipes or a how to guide to follow?  Thanks "
577,Mr Beer sells Brew Max,Does anyone know what Mr Beer Brew Max is? Also what can be substituted for it?I am trying to raise my A.B.V. in my home brew. I ask because I need a substitute. It almost looks like very small pieces of Rock Candy. When add to my wort it seemed to thicken it. Also don't know what kind of effect it has on A.B.V. or the taste of the Beer. The   batch I used it in is cold fermenting now in my fridge. 
578,Difference between 'brewing' beer and wine?,"I haven't been able to sort out the exact differences, it seems to me both of them are blended with yeast in a 'must' for x number of days then bottled for secondary fermentation/carbonation. What am I missing? Of course that's stripping it down to the bare minimum, variations exist; beer often includes hops along the way, white wine grapes are peeled beforehand, etc., but is there a fundamental difference?  Also, from what I understand, sake and cider are made the same way as wine. Cider makes more sense to me as it is also a fruit, but rice (the base of sake) is a cereal grain just like barley/wheat, so does that imply barley could be brewed the same way as sake or wine as well? What would that taste like? Is there a name for it? "
579,Brewing beer in Florida,"I'm considering starting my own project brewing beer, but I'm worried about the temperature of the ferment at rest. I live in Florida where the days are currently getting up to around 90 Fahrenheit, and my house can't be air-conditioned to anything less than 80. Temperature recommendations for brewing beer are just about 70 degrees and there really isn't a way I can get it down to that, any suggestions? Would it still brew, but perhaps taste different? Ferment faster? Do species of yeast exist which prefer these higher temperatures? "
580,Pet bottles force-carbonation,"I use to prime my PET bottles with dextrose and carbonation is usually good.  My last batch did not carbonate well (for reasons that I am investigating...), I will fix this, but my question is about other ways to carbonate my PET bottles.  I'm thinking about kegging in the future, but I don't want to buy everything right now.  So could I buy the following :   5lbs CO2 tank a regulator PET bottle carbonation cap like this one   Then, I could fill my PET bottle with CO2.  But how does it work?  Is it reliable? Can you guide me on the process?      Thanks, "
581,Slight difference pre and post boil gravity,"Long story short. Trying to understand my new set up, I made a mistake, I didn't check the post boil volume and also didn't have good rolling boil. The wort was boiling, but not so much. Simple grain bill:     5.2 kg 2 row (95%),  20g Munich (5%) first wort hops and 80g more at flameout.    Mashed for 80 minutes at 65°C/149°F, mashed out for 10 minutes at 167°F. Boiled for 60 minutes stirring all the time. Pre-boil gravity was 1.050, after boil 1.056.    What is the chance for off flavors?  Have you had similar experience?  Thank you for your time. "
582,How to efficiently use active carbon?,"I have recently become interested in building my own home-brew water filtration unit; during my online research on the subject, I came across active carbon (aka activated charcoal). It seems like it may be a great addition to my current ideas, although I have a few questions:  1: Where can I get active carbon that is okay for human consumption? (It's not like I will be taking it in directly, although drinking water will pass directly through it).  2: How can I effectively use the active carbon, and also use it efficiently?  3: What is the filtering lifespan of active carbon? (How long can it effectively clean water? For a given amount of carbon, and water).  Thank you in advance :) "
583,What are good ways to reduce oxygen after racking a beer?,"I haven't had any problems with homebrews going stale, but I'm curious about what people do to minimize introducing oxygen in later steps of the brewing process.  If you have a closed brewing system, then that's obviously ideal.  But is it possible to pump an inert gas into a secondary carboy before racking?  Are there other steps or tips for reducing oxygen in the process? "
584,Yeasty Tasting Pale Ale,"This is already after the fact, since the batch has been consumed but... My pale ale that I made had quite a 'yeasty' taste. It still wasn't bad, though I would have preferred it to be a bit milder. What is a good course of action to take the next time around to help resolve that? More/less time in fermentation? Use secondary? More time bottle-conditioning? Would any of these affect the yeast taste at all? Thanks! "
585,Reusing yeast slurry after cold-crashing.,"I let a lager sit for 10 weeks in a secondary until it was very clear (the cold helped with clarity), and then used the yeast slurry at the bottom as a starter for another batch. I usually make a starter, but I was brewing and bottling on the same day and tried to take a shortcut.   However, three days later, there are no signs of fermentation (bubbling airlock) in the new batch. Is it likely that the yeast is so dormant that it's taking a while to reactivate, or should I go back to the local homebrew store in a few days and get some additional known-good yeast? The new batch has a fairly low OG (~1.045), but it still should have plenty of sugar to ferment.  What would you do? "
586,Hops in the compost?,"Are there any gardeners out there who use their spent hops in their compost? I know hops are antibacterial, which goes against the goal of getting a good population of composting bacteria, but I don't know how specific the effects are, especially when hops would be a relatively small percent of the total composting matter.  I've seen recommendations in books both ways, but am looking for a good definitive source, or at least some anecdotes. Any ideas? "
587,Williams Warn Personal Brewery,"I just saw this on Wired.com and wondered what the rest of you thought of it.  [website]Some interesting things - carbonation during fermentation?, closed design.  Seems like the closed design is smart for sanitary reasons, however, I've never heard of carbonating during fermentation.  Sounds like something that's only possible in a closed system.  Is it a practice used by the pros? "
588,Can sanitizier liquid be reused?,"Can the sanitizer liquid used to sterilize your equipment be used for several containers in a row?   I got told that I can add my equipment to my larger fermentation vessels to sanitize all at once. But if I have two containers and let one of them soak over night in sanitizer, can I then just fill it into the second container and let it stand for a while? I would add some hot water to warm it up again.  I'm using the  ""VWP cleaner / steriliser"" if its matters. It's labeled ""contains chlorine donor"" but doesn't tell what ingredients it is made from.  "
589,Can I store my fermentation containers filled with sanitizer liquid,"Is there a maximum time I can keep the sanitizer liquid inside the fermentation containers? Would it be OK if I fill them with it and store them for a while, like a couple of weeks?   If not, would it be OK for a few days. Sometimes I fill them with the sterilizer to start some brewing, but then something else comes up and I don't find time to return to it until the next weekend.  I saw that the sanitizer powder tends to fall out from the water after I while and then just lies on the bottom of the container. Sometimes I stir it, to mix it again. "
590,What exactly does all-malt mean?,"My understanding is that all-malt simply means no adjuncts (sugar, corn, rice, ect) in your beer.  They also say that all-malt beers are prone to DMS.  They also say that dark german beers are essentially immune to DMS.  Technically, aren't all german beers all-malt, due to Reinheitsgebot?  Am I missing something? "
591,Is DMS content relevant when using extract?,"Most extract kits suggest simply dropping the extract in the bucket with some boiling water.  Do extract brewers need to be concerned about DMS levels or is that taken care of in the starch conversion process during ""extraction""?  From a purely DMS point-of-view, is it worth doing a partial poil when using extract?  Would a pilsner / light pale extract need to go through the 90 minute boil process? "
592,Do commercial breweries stir in their fermenters to expose more yeast to the wort?,"I noticed that ale yeasts, so called top-fermenting yeast, floats to the top.  Does this mean that the yeast only works on the wort near the top of the fermenter?  Assuming that no oxygen or bacteria is introduced, does it make sense to stir the wort while it's fermenting to distribute the yeast and speed up the fermentation process? "
593,Determining the right gravity after mash in all grain brewing,"Say I am brewing a beer that is supposed to have an OG of 1.050. I'm doing all-grain brewing and at the end of my mash &amp; sparge, if I took the gravity at that point, what should I expect?   I think because I am pre-boil, the gravity at that point would be somewhere lower than the expected 1.050, but can I calculate that to make sure I am on the right track?  If I can figure out an expected post-mash gravity, if I do not hit it, are there adjustments I can make at that point? Boil longer? Add some extract? "
594,How to garde a Biere De Garde?,"Biere De Garde recipes seem to generally recommend a period of 4 to 6 weeks of cold storage, essentially lagering.   My brewing experience consists solely of fermenting ales, so this is somewhat foreign to me.  There is one mention in ""Farmhouse Ales"" (p. 46) of ""...garding on the lees,"" but every other mention of garding does not mention the lees or yeast, so I'm a little unclear on whether or not it's a good idea to do that.  Should I rack to secondary and chill that, or should I just put the whole primary fermentor into the refrigerator for the time recommended?  Edit: To clarify: I'm actually trying to find out whether or not to store the beer on the primary yeast cake during the initial cold storage period (pre carbonation).   Will the yeast autolyse at refrigerator temperatures (32-38F)?   If so, are autolysis flavors appropriate for a BDG? "
595,Any suggestions / stories on heather ale brewing?,I'm interested in hearing about people's experience brewing a heather ale.. from what I understand this was the predominant flavoring of beers before hops and it just seems like an interesting part of brewing to explore.  I have not found a commercial example of this to date.. but I'm interested in trying this myself.  Does anyone have any tips / recipes / stories that you can share about heather ale brewing? Is it worth trying a batch? 
596,Does skunking alter the preservative capabilities of hops?,"We all know letting beer sit in the light for some time without any shield is a bad idea due to the flavor and aroma that are produced, but are there any other effects?   Is a skunked beer more hospitable to microbes than a non-skunked beer?    "
597,What to do when gravity comes out too low?,"We brewed a maibock (from an extract kit) and when we checked our OG it was significantly lower than it should have been. I mean like, really, really low. We decided to attribute this to the wort not being mixed in good enough so we shook it up and took another reading. Still low. We decided to pitch the yeast anyway and then put it in the fridge. Well, after a month or two it's definitely not good beer based on the hoppy flavors and lack of activity. We added some nutrient and the yeasts woke up for a little bit but died off again shortly after. The evidence points to that we didn't get enough sugars in there somehow. We followed the instructions but something must have went wrong. I can get some more details later.  Is there anything we can do to salvage the batch? Why was our gravity so low?  Edit:  Maibock Extract Kit w/ Specialty Grains purchased from the Milwaukee location (we haven't had issues with any of their other kits)  The original gravity measured about a 1.035 after mixing it several times. It did seem a little watery (not fully dissolved) but I'm not sure why this would have been. Since pitching the gravity did lower a little bit but stopped decreasing early on.  The temp has been around 42-44F since the start.  After checking the gravity several weeks later, it is still at 1.030 and hasn't really moved in a couple weeks. "
598,Degrees Plato vs Specific Gravity,"What is the difference between these measurements and is one better than the other for any particular use?  Which measurement scale do you use, why? "
599,Should we primary ferment in carboys prior to transfer into an oak barrel for a solera?,"We are about to undergo a 55 gallon brew as a club, to be added to an oak barrel to be a solera.  Is autolysis enough of a concern to primary ferment in glass and rack into the barrel?    As a secondary question, how and when do you remove yeast sediment from the barrel when you're continually (periodically) adding new wort? "
600,What is the impact of a second d-rest after 3 weeks of lagering?,"We have brewed a number of ales, but recently tried our hand at a pilsner.  After 8 days of fermenting at around 52 degrees F, we brought the pilsner up for a 2-day diacetyl rest at around 68 degrees.  At this point we proved our inexperience by moving the carboy back into the cooler to crash without racking over.  Unsurprisingly, we discovered off flavors, most notably strong diacetyl, when we were preparing to rack over into kegs to serve.  What would be the impact of bringing the carboys up for a second d-rest at this stage?  Will the yeast have enough left in them to dispose of the diacetyl? Are we inviting autolysis?  Any suggestions to salvage the beer?  We are trying to avoid repitching yeast, but if that's the only way, we're open.  Another technique we've read about is bubbling CO2 through the beer and purging the gas repeatedly. Has anyone tried this? "
601,Temperature correction for specific gravity,If I want to convert my specific gravity reading from one temperature to an equivalent specific gravity at 60F how do I do it?  Can you give me a correction factor for this case? 
602,DIY Racking cane / Auto-siphon,I can't seem to find a local supplier that stocks a racking cane or siphon in my area so I'd like to have a go at making my own.  I could find an online supplier but most US stores won't ship to AU &amp; I want to use it in a few days.  I know I can just siphon with tubing but I'd like to use a cane with that rubber nozzle that reduces the muck that comes up.  Can I make my own racking cane?  What's involved? 
603,Any difference between lagering dubbel at 36F versus 45-50F?,"I have a Belgian Dubbel bottle conditioning, the recipe for which came from Brewing Classic Styles.  For this recipe, Jamil says to carbonate the beer, then lager for one month at 45-50F.  I have the ability to do this in my ferm chest, but doing so would mean I can't ferment anything else for that month.  On the other hand, I could put the carbonated bottles into the fridge at 36F for a month before calling them ready to drink.  What is the difference between lagering the conditioned beer at 36F versus 45-50F?  By the time it starts its cold conditioning phase, it will have spent three weeks in the primary, one week in secondary, and four-to-five weeks in the bottle.  The yeast used was WLP500.  Will this ale yeast clean the beer at 45-50F better than it would at 36F?  Is it even active at 45F?  Part of me wants to say he suggest those temps because they're convenient for those who keg: force carbonate, then place the keg in the kegerator, which is typically at 45-50F for serving, and leave it for a month before tapping.  Since I bottle, my serving chamber (the beer fridge), which sits at 36F, is the most convenient place to keep the beer.  If I lager it at 36F, will I be missing the point of lagering at 45-50F? "
604,Longest time in carboy?,"I've been extraordinarily lazy lately and have kept 2 of my beers sitting around for some time.  What is the longest you've kept your beer on primary and still had good results? I'm hearing arguments back and forth as to whether or not autolysis actually exists.  I've had a IIPA dry-hopping in secondary for a month and a half now, and a choc stout sitting in primary for about the same time.  i still have to secondary my stout onto some cacao nibs and vanilla beans as well, so that'll take a couple weeks.  Think I'm still okay? "
605,What is the distinctive flavor in Warsteiner Premium Verum?,"To me, there's a really distinctive flavor in Warsteiner Premium Verum.  I get a ton of it in Warsteiner, a fair bit in Beck's, and a bit in Pilsner Urquell.  I'm quite sure the thing I'm tasting is malt-related, not hop-related.  The BJCP description of 2A German Pilsner makes me think that ""graham cracker"" is perhaps the thing I'm smelling/tasting, but I'm really not sure.  Perhaps it's just a malty sweetness.  I've hoped for the same flavor to show up in my homebrews, but it hasn't yet.  I've made a few batches with just Gambrinus pilsner malt, but haven't been able to get my hands on any other pilsner malts.  If anyone thinks they know the taste I'm referring to, how would you describe it?  And secondarily, how would you achieve it? "
606,What's the best way to rack beer off of fruit?,"I recently brewed a 5.5 gallon batch of witbier.  After primary, I bottled 3 gallons of it and racked the other 2.5 gallons into a 3 gallon carboy atop 24 ounces of raspberries.  After the secondary fermentation had completed and the beer fell clear, there was a good bit of now-beige raspberry gunk in the bottom of the carboy, and just as much floating at the top.  I had a hard time siphoning the beer off of the fruit.  I used an auto-siphon wrapped in nylon pantyhose.  That worked well for preventing the fruit from getting into the siphon, but it kept clogging at the base and I was unable to get the last half gallon or three quarts of beer.  I liked the way the beer turned out and I'll probably do it again, but in the future I want to have a better way to rack off the fruit.  Have you done it before?  What works well for you?  I'm thinking maybe if I secondary in a bucket and build some sort of round screen that I can use to push all the fruit to the bottom - like a French press - then rack from above the screen... "
607,Does preboiling oak cubes kill the brettanomyces,"I have a Flanders Brown ready to be kegged for aging, and I'm going at add some oak cubes for the flavor and oxygen and bugs.  I've heard it's a good idea to boil the cubes first, but I feel like that will kill off the Brettanomyces that naturally live in them.  Is this a valid worry?  Does it even matter since I used a Wyeast strain that has all sorts of lambic bugs to begin with (including the beloved Bretts)? "
608,What about an Unfiltered IPA makes it unfiltered?,I recently tried an unfiltered IPA that was fantastic!  I'm a newbie homebrewer and would like to take a shot at one.  What makes an IPA unfiltered?  Can I take any IPA recipe and modify it to be unfiltered? 
609,Wild yeast taking over?,"I brewed a belgian triple last week.  I was making a starter using white labs trapist yeast, but it didn't take off; must have been a bad vial. So, I picked up a packet of wyeast trapist yeast and pitched that into the same starter to get it going. In the meantime the batch was sitting in the carboy waiting for yeast.  Problem is: while the starter was getting going, and before I pitched any yeast into the carboy, the cooled wort in the fermentor started to ferment. It didn't get going too hard before I pitched a good size starter into it.   Question is: What is going to be the effect of whatever got in to the batch to start it fermenting? And, since I pitched a really healthy starter that made fermentation take off, will the yeast I pitched take over and still make a good tripel?  EDIT: for clarification: When my first starter didn't take off, I added more yeast to it (wyeast).  In the meantime, while waiting for the wyeast starter to get going the carboy of wort started to ferment on its own. "
610,Will rapid ambient temperature drop kill yeast or just slow them down,"I have just put on my first all grain homebrew (a porter) here in Melbourne, Australia.  After a day or so it was bubbling away quite nicely.  A couple of days ago the weather decided to change dramatically and the temperature has dropped from around 18-20 ºC to around 14 ºC. The yeast in use is an ale yeast (Wyeast 1338 - European Ale if I remember rightly).  When I got home from work yesterday the fermenter was no longer really bubbling.  So my question is whether this will simply take longer to complete or whether the yeast is in big trouble?  I suspect it will just take longer (and the taste will be effected) but just wanted confirmation or suggestions?  Cheers, Jon "
611,Is an immersion chiller really necessary?,"I have been reading here about immersion, counterflow and plate chillers and they don't seem to chill the wort much faster than my current method; ice.  Many people have stated that their chillers cool the wort to pitching temperature in 20-25 minutes.  I'm able to to chill mine to 75-80 degrees F in 25 minutes or so just filling my sink with ice and water around the brew pot.  Is the extra 5-10 minutes cooling time really going to make that big of a difference? For the $65+ wort chiller price, I can buy  a lot of ice at the grocery, not to mention the  50 gallons of water I'll save not running the tap for 20 minutes on every batch.  Is an immersion chiller considered essential equipment or is it just another brewing gadget that isn't truly necessary for casual brewers? "
612,Safely adding enzymes (e.g. Beano) to lower final gravity,"I've heard a lot of mixed stories about people adding additional enzymes (Beano, GasX, etc) to their beers to drop the final gravity down very (sometimes undesirably) low.  I've also hear mixed ideas on when it should be added.  As per a comment in a previous question of mine, there's been experience with adding it at kegging to assist with dropping the FG after the fact in the case of a botched attenuation, with the consequence of having to lengthen the aging to allow the enzyme to convert all the sugars it possibly can.  I've also heard that people may add it during the mash (supposedly common in distillation).  If it were added during the mash, would the enzymes denature in the boil, negating the need to lengthen the aging?  Would it have enough time during a 60/90 minute mash and the lautering to have any significance?  Are there any other times/methods to adding enzymes or controlling their conversion to assist with dropping the FG in high gravity beers? "
613,Maintaining Optimal Flavor in a Brown Ale,"I've brewed a lot of Brown Ales, and one thing I have noticed from batch to batch is fairly swift flavor degradation.  The beer will taste excellent after two weeks of conditioning.  I'll be able to pick up various malt contributions and fruity hop flavors.  I used flaked corn in my my most recent batch and it really added a complexity and smoothness to the flavor.  The problem is, it seems, after 3 weeks or so, they all start tasting the same, and all of the subtle flavors I picked up in the first few bottles seems to disappear completely.  For clarification, these are All Grain batches that are conditioned in bottles.  I'm not sure if this is my taste buds failing me, or if the beer is actually degrading that quickly.  This is something you won't typically see happening in a commercial beer, meaning, you can open a beer that's been bottled for months, and it will still taste the same as you'd expect.  I'm sure commercial breweries are using preservatives of some kind, so what if anything might be the culprit in my process and what can I do about it?  A few ideas are:   Possible contamination that doesn't present itself right away Overly carbonated (though I have been careful about this the last few batches) Under carbonated (maybe I'm picking up residual sweetness) Lighter body beers degrade faster? Exposure to light (I keep these in my closet which is usually dark, however) Storage temperature (House temp is usually between 60 and 75 degrees) Poorly crafted recipes that don't hold up over time   Here are a few of the Recipes in question, for reference.

615,"How do I make grape wine at 60%ABV, that tastes good?","Its my first time. I want to make some wine. Please tell me how I increase my wines alcohol percentage around 60%.    Is it possible, Does anyone know the process?  How much yeast, should I use in the grape juice? I have baking yeast and I can’t collect Brewer’s yeast, can I convert baking yeast to brewer’s yeast? Can I add liquid ginger in grapes juice? How do I know if my wine is unfit for drinking?  "
616,How to Properly Increase the Temperature of a Batch after Primary Fermentation,"I've read tidbits how that after the first 3 days of fermentation, you would ideally raise the temperature of the carboy for the remainder of the brew.  How, exactly, does one do this?  Say the Wyeast I buy states an optimal temperature range of 60-72*F (15.5 to 22.2*C), and I don't know enough about the flavor profile at different temperatures of a yeast, so I arbitrarily decide that the midway point is going to be my target temperature.  For the first three days I hold the temperature at 66*F (18.9*C).  Given that (I've heard) only 50% of the batch is brewed in the first three days, why would I want to raise at all?  Assuming I want to raise,   1) Do I raise after 3 days or some other amount? (Rule of thumb here as I'm not going to take gravity readings)  2) how much do I raise the temperature by?  3) how many hours/days do I take to raise the temperature?  4) do I hold it at this temperature for the duration of the brew?  Incidentally, I have 8 carboys going but only 4 fermwraps. Four of the carboys are closer to the end of the brew, and four of them are closer to the start. Is it more important for me to raise the temperatures towards the beginning of the batch that to maintain a raised temperature at the end of a batch? "
617,Can Malt extract or Wort be inverted?,"You can invert Sucrose sugar (UK table sugar) into Fructose and Glucose, by heating with citric acid, (FYI This is how you make belgian candy sugar guys!).  I'm not too hot on my Malt, but there is a cocktail of sugars in there including Maltose after mashing.  Can this (Malt/Malt Extract/Wort) be inverted? bonus question is there any use for this, how does it relate to beer?  I feel this may be a disappointingly quick answer. "
618,Could someone provide info. about brewing salts?,"I have been reading a lot about home brewing. I'm planning actually to build an electronic 5 gallon brewery. Could anyone provide a short explanation when (mashing, boiling ?!), why and how much to use of the following salts?  Gypsum / Calcium Sulphate (CaS04)  Calcium Chloride (CaCl2) Pure / Unscented Epsom Salt (MgS04) Chalk / Calcium Carbonate (CaC03) Baking Soda (NaHC03) Non-Iodized salt / Pickling salt / Kosher salt (NaCl)   Are they really necessary? :/  Cheers!

621,I added sugar and bottled the beer...aged and no carbonation,"We made the beer, it fermented fine, then waited to bottle (maybe too long afterwards) added sugar and bottled.    After waiting for the required time opened a bottle only to find it flat. Can we add more yeast and still save this batch of beer or do we need to start over...? Can the original brew be salvaged? "
622,Does current science have any idea of what components of the biology of yeast make which desired characteristics of beer,"[website]If you haven't heard of this story you have GOT to read it.  ""Scientists streamlined organism's DNA and added sequences in first ever creation of an artificial 'eukaryotic' chromosome""  They took brewers' yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and introduced artificial chromosomes into it. Awesome.   From a layman, this sounds to me like it could hold the potential for revolutionizing our hobby. Why genetically engineer brewers' yeast through ""selective breeding"" when you can inject chromosomes into live yeast and have them reproduce your desired characteristics?  This question boils down to one thing:  Does current science have any idea of what components of the biology of yeast make which desired characteristics of beer?  Or, are we completely unaware of why one strain of yeast imparts some characteristics under certain temperature? "
623,Can I add adjuncts to beer kits?,"I have been given one of those beer kits, namely Coopers International Series Beer Kit English Bitter.  I've used these kits before and I've also made my own beer without the use of such kits. What I'd like to know is can I add things to these kits to make them more my own? I've been reading about subbing dandelions for bittering hops and wondered if it were possible to do this with my kit - seeing as dandelions are so abundant right now? "
624,Gravity reading much lower than exected: why?,"Okay, so my friend and me made an experiment yesterday. We wanted to brew a >20%, 300+ IBU IIPA.  Yeah yeah... I know :)  Now to the question. We used 10.5kg of grain for 26.25 liters of water for the mash. From the recipe calculator, we should have gotten around 1.208 OG. We ""only"" managed to get it to 1.120.  I wanted to ask if anyone had an idea of that poor efficiency. Mash went wonderfully at a temperature of 66°C.   Is there some point where converting to sugars in mash gets a lot harder? Is the hydrometer capable of reading very high gravity readings? Is there anything that you can think of that could create this result?   This is for a 3 gallons batch (11.5 liters).  Thanks! "
625,"What is it about this receipe that makes it an IPA? Or more generally, what makes an IPA?","So I recently brewed up this recipe. When I went to the LHBS to get the grain, the guy there somehow knew, just from the grain bill, that I was making an IPA. Since finding and loving IPAs, I had always liked them for the hops, and I had thought this was what classed them as IPA.  So what is it about the grain bill that makes this an IPA? Or more generally, what makes an IPA? Is it the grains? The hops? Both?   Here is the recipe copied and pasted from: [website]  All-Grain - Rye Pale Ale      Recipe Type: All Grain        Yeast: US-05       Yeast  Starter: No       Batch Size (Gallons): 5.00        Original Gravity: 1.052        Final Gravity: 1.004        IBU: 32.8       Boiling Time (Minutes): 60        Color: 10.2  Primary Fermentation       (# of Days &amp; Temp): 14 Days at 65F        Tasting Notes: Balance of spice from the Rye and Malt sweetness.      This beer is the only beer i have consistently on tap. I have brewed   it about 10 times now and think i have perfected it, although i still   tweak it to experiment.       Grains 5lbs Marris Otter (3.0 SRM)      1.5lb Munich Malt (20.0 SRM)      1.5lb Flaked Rye (2.0 SRM) 1lb Honey Malt (25.0 SRM)      0.5lb Cara-pils (2.0 SRM)      Hops      0.50oz Summit (16.50%) - 60min      0.50oz Centennial (8.60%) - 15min      0.50oz Centennial (8.60%) - 5min      Mash at 154 F for 60min      I ferment for 2 weeks in the Primary then keg. Keg is usually tapped   about one month from the time brewed.       FG listed is my measured FG, but anticipated FG from Beersmith is   1.012.      Hops can be substituted freely. I'v done Summit only, Cascade only,   Centennial and Cascades, etc. Any hop with a citrus flavor will mesh   perfectly.  "
626,Why add extract late,"I have heard mention of late addition of extracts. I was under the impression that you need to boil the extract to kill off any possible nasties?  When I brew, so far always from a prepackaged kit, after the steep, I get the boil going, add the steep/rinse water, bring back to boil, add liquid extract, bring back to boil, add hops, boil 60 min, add finishing hops...  what would I gain or lose by waiting to add the extract? and how late into the boil is considered a late extract addition?  Thanks and Cheers! "
627,Advice on my second batch,"I recently completed my first batch, which was the DIPA kit from Brewer's Best.  It actually turned out much better than I could have imagined, so I was very pleased.  My only complaints, and these were confirmed by friends who tried it, was that while it had a bitter taste, it didn't have a distinctively hoppy taste.  It also had a pleasant aroma, but the aroma was not long lasting.    The hop profile of the kit was Columbus hops added at 0 min and 45 min of the 60 min boil, and then cascade hops added at the end for aroma.  I want to get a bit creative for my second batch, and try to use this kit again but add in some additional hops.  Based on all of the material I have read, the general rule of thumb is early hops for bittering, middle hops for flavoring, and late hops for aroma.    What I want to try is the following hop profile (I did some analysis on characteristics of hops, and picked some I think could be interesting);  Bittering Hops - Simcoe and Chinook  Flavoring Hops - Warrior and Columbus  Aroma - Cascade  I then want to dry hop with Glacier and Palisade.  My question is, with this many hop additions, do I boil for more than 60 minutes?  Is there a right or wrong way to make multiple hop additions during a boil?  A set amount of time I should wait between each addition?  Any advice is appreciated. "
628,Does temperature rise time between mash steps matter?,"When doing a multi-step mash, does the amount of time you take in between steps to raise the temperature make a difference? (Aside from the obvious ""taking longer will make your brew day take longer""). I've only done multi-step mashes a few times. The first time I basically had my burner on the whole time and let the mash temp raise from about 120°F to 152°F over about the course of an hour. The second time, I let it rest at each step without any heat and heated between steps as quickly as I could manage to stir without scorching. Raising quickly certainly takes less brew-day time, but I can't say I noticed any difference in the final wort (disclaimer: these two mashes were not the same grist, so it wasn't an experimental comparison, so to speak).  Is there something happening on the enzymatic level that I'm not aware of? Does this make a difference only when using under modified grain? "
629,Violent fermentation | One day after brewing | Liter spillage from the top,"I am an amateur brewer just cooked my third batch ever three days ago. This time with a couple of friends (which also bought the ingredients from a place I haven't before), so this time I used a different recipe, the one the new store gave us. That recipe had A LOT of sugar in it, and so as I feared, after one day in the bucket, due to extremely violent fermentation about a liter of mead was spilled, probably with a big part of the yeast. I see some signs of fermentation although it doesn't look very active.  What should I do? Is the batch ruined? Should i just wait and see?  Thank you! "
630,Can beer done without hops?,Can hops be substituted by an easy available product? I am from India I was not able to find hops in local markets can anybody help me out? 
631,"After a beer reaches its final gravity, how long does the conditioning step take?","I have been in the habit of leaving my beers in their primary fermenter for three weeks across the board, which is a significant amount of time longer than their primary fermentation usually takes. My rationale is that this gives the yeast time to start cleaning up any off flavours and by-products prior to me bottling the batch.  How long does this secondary process actually take? Given that I give the beer three weeks to carb and condition after bottling, is this time redundant? "
632,how to calculate proper proportions to make drinkable wine,"it's (fairly) easy to read a recipe that's already out there, or use a kit that someone else has already pre-packaged all the ingredients.  but i would like to take it to the next step and be able to calculate the correct proportions myself.  if i have a grape, how can i figure out its sugar content?  how do you know the correct proportions of sugar/liquid/yeast?  how do you know when to move to secondary (tertiary) fermentation?  if you alter those lengths, how will that alter the end product and which characteristics will be altered? "
633,Strong beer at 3%?,"The O.G. was 13 Brix (1.053), and the F.G. was 8 Brix (1.031).  According to the calculation, the beer is only approximately 3% ABV.  But I tried a glass and it's gotta be closer to 5.5%.  20% of the grain bill was Crystal Malt 10L.  Due to the residual unfermentable sugars from the crystal malt, is it possible that the alcohol content is actually much higher than my calculation suggests?  If so, is there a more accurate way to calculate ABV? "
634,Is juiced Ginger root fermentable?,"I occasionally use a juicer to make Ginger root juice (which is quite strong) but lately I've also considered lacto-fermenting this juice.   Which leads me to my question:How fermentable is juiced Ginger really?  I'm aware of how ginger bug is sometimes used to kick start ferments but juiced Ginger is something else entirely. Also, I've read quite a bit about Ginger's antiseptic and antibacterial properties. Wouldn't those same properties render a starter culture useless? "
635,Adding coconut after fermentation,"I am attempting to brew the coconut porter as listed in this thread, which is bubbling away nicely at the moment.   It notes:     after fermentation, rack off into PB or somesuch.    Then toast 700g dessicated coconut in oven for 40min at 150C or until just turning brown - do not burn!! Add 100g of untoasted coconut to the PB with the 700g of toasted coconut - loose.   Leave for 10-14 days, giving a shake around every now and then as the coconut floats to the top.    After my fermentation is complete (I  usually leave my brew for 3 weeks,  no secondary) would racking it out onto the coconut, into a lidded bucket with no airlock, be suitable?   I've only got one fermentation vessel with airlock available, so I was planning on using my bottling bucket for secondary. It's just got a tight fitting lid with no hole for airlock.   Alternatively I can rack off into bucket, clean the fermentation vessel, then put the beer back in there with the coconut?  "
636,Can this juice ferment without added sugar?,"If I wanted to make a hooch out of ""cranberry juice cocktail"", which is composed of ""water, cranberry juice, high fructose corn syrup, cranberry juice concentrate, and ascorbic acid, how would I go about that?

Then again there are statements like      Many times it can be irritating   from [website]Does lemon harm or benefit the plant? Could it be that a small amount of lemon is beneficial while a larger amount can be damaging? Does it make a difference whether I use just the juice, or lemon slices, with or without skin? "
638,Crabbies ginger beer clone recipe,"A few years back I tried brewing my first Ginger beer hoping to get a result that would come close to the one that Crabbies makes (which I love). The result ended up very bitter and it just wasn't a nice drink. That kinda ruined the hobby for me and I gave it up after my first try, but recently I have been thinking about giving it another try. I have tried googling the recipe I used a few years ago, but I did not regcognize it. So my question is: is there a recipe around that comes close to Crabbies ginger beer? And does anyone have experience in brewing Crabbies clone or similar brews? "
639,Rapidly moving particles during fermentation?,I'm about 24 hours into fermenting my first IPA in a carboy using Safale-04.  The fermentation is going well but I noticed small particles floating around in all directions.  My best guess is that these are either clumps of yeast or hop particles (maybe both?) that are being moved around by the CO2 being generated by fermentation.  It might be hard to see but they are the small areas in this picture and they move around almost as fast as I would expect in boiling water:    Is this fairly normal for fermentation with a highly flocculative yeast or a larger amount of hops?  Or maybe this just a really aggressive fermentation? 
640,How do I increase the quantity of Ginger Beer Plant using ingredients I would use anyway?,Very similar to this question I would like to know how to best make my Ginger Beer Plant grow. Another but related question would be what the most important factors for growth are. Water? Temperature? Sugar? Citric acid? I would like to not add lots of stuff that would not usually be part of Ginger Beer.

643,Wild Farmhouse style Cider and BJCP Classification,"Good day, community! I've got a dilemma. 3 month ago I made 3 different ciders (splitting one 3 ways) using the same blend of Granny Smith, Golden Delicious, and Red Delicious apples. It was a freshly pressed sweet apple cider right in front of me. For each of the batch I didn't use any yeast allowing the ciders to ferment naturally (from what ever was on those apples). Fermentation went slightly different giving each batch (3 gallons each) a unique character. The ciders a little bit hazy, with ""rustic"" clearness, like a farm or barn style cider should be.   My question is, which category of the BJCP does it fall into? Judging by apple varieties, it is C1A (New World Cider), but I haven't find any word on wild fermentation in the whole guide  [website]Any suggestions? Any help would be appreciated "
644,Pomagranate mead color,I've been fermenting my pomagranate mead for about 2 weeks now and I'm planning on racking it in a week. My question is why does my mead have a brown red color? Is this a normal colour for pomagranate mead. Is this brown colour from the honey or I added some grape tannin which had a brown colour ( I didn't add that much). I'm going to let if ferment more but I was just curious about the colour. Also is there a way to make it a darker red and less brown?

646,No bubbling after 3 days and no SG reading at start,"I'm doing my first brew and it doesn't seem to be going too well! I know there are loads of questions along these lines but I couldn't find one that matches my scenario closely.  I did all the prep and work but when it came to doing the SG reading I found the hydrometer in my kit was shattered so was unable to take a reading.   I had read that using filtered water was a good idea so I used our filtered-water-dispensing-fridge to get some so was concerned about temperature but also didn't have a thermometer to hand.   Add to that that our heating has broken so the house is much cooler than usual and it hasn't been a great start!  3 days later and very little seems to be happening.  The room where it is doesn't smell malty at all and I'm yet to see any bubbles through the airlock. I had a look inside and it looked pretty much as it did when I left it.   So now I'm not sure what to do! Warm it up in the airing cupboard for a bit and see if it starts? Take an SG reading now (with the replacement not-smashed hydrometer)? ""Pitch"" more yeast (which I assume is just sprinkling more on top)? Give up and get a new kit?  Advice appreciated! "
647,Do I need two tanks in a RIMS system,"I'm looking into building an automated RIMS system. I think I understand the principles pretty well, but there is one sticking point for me. Since the heating element is container in the pipe, I would assume that you have to heat the original volume of water necessary for the brewing, before you add the grain. So how is this done? do automated RIMS systems usually have an extra hot water res that holds some of the pre - heated water, and then a a series of valves are triggered? I would assume the same is true for the sparge water. You need to add water to the system during the sparge, so where does that water come from? "
648,Belgian yeast used to brew a stout,I accidentally pitched wyeast 1762 instead if yeast 1056 to brew a stout. Is my beer ruined? Before I pitch the right into the mix and really make a mess of things can anyone with more knowledge guide me please?  
649,Counterflow Chiller Setup for Optimal Efficiency and Chilling Speed,What is the best configuration where you can decrease your chilling time/increase efficiency.  I know this is a bit loaded so let me clarify.  I have the standard issue 20' copper 3/8'' garden hose counter flow chiller.  Works great but I want to get the most out of it and shorten my brew day.  I currently get 10 gallons down to 70 F using 58 F water (hose 1/2 way open) in about 25 minutes.    I know there are different setups and operations that may improve the efficiency of the CFC. I am curious as to any incite anyone might have. For example:   Is it more efficient to pump your wort rather than using gravity? Is it more efficient run your wort through the bottom CFC Wort in and have it exit from the top to avoid channeling where the wort might not get in complete contact with the copper? Should you run the hose water full bast and regulate the wort flow or vise versa?   I am just looking to change any variable except swapping out the CFC for something else. 
650,Substituting Dark LME with Amber LME in a Stout,"I'm following this stout recipe for the second time (it's a good one). I had planned to double the recipe to make ~ 40ltrs instead of 20ltrs.  The recipe calls for:  (2.7KG)  6 lb. Dark Liquid Malt Extract   My supplies just arrived and my homebrew store substituted 3 x 1.5 Kg Cans of Dark LME with Amber LME.  So I needed 5.5Kg of Dark LME in the first place, I now have 1 x 1.5Kg Dark LME and 3 x 1.5Kg Amber.  Does anybody know what the effect might be on my stout if I use the amber instead of dark? Would it turn out mostly the same except for colour? Just trying to figure out if I should kick up a fuss with my supplier.  Cheers "
651,Force-carbonated Homebrew Keg Foaming,"I see there are other keg-foaming questions on here, but they seem to usually be related to commercial kegs or have answers that I've tried (hastily).   I have a keg of homebrew brown ale and a brand new 2-tap Edgestar Kegerator which has a roughly 1ft tall stainless steel tower. We upgraded the hardware on the kegerator to have a manifold between the two CO2 lines as well as threaded disconnects to support either corny keg (ball lock) connectors or commercial kegs. The kegerator has been cold since Monday, and the keg was chilling for 24 hours on Monday/Tuesday in the kegerator before we started force carbonating it.  We are force-carbing it because we have a holiday party on Friday (tomorrow!) and we want to have it ready by then.  Finding various techniques for force-carbing, we ended up going with 20psi for one day and 30psi for another day, with rocking the keg every couple hours in between, before letting the CO2 out of the head space in the keg and getting it back down to 10psi.   We now have the liquid line connected, and nothing but foam is coming out, pint after pint. The beer itself, once the foam fades, is very flat.  Here's what other people have suggested to fix that I've already confirmed are not a problem:   Get it cold - yep, the keg and the beer coming out of it are cold Use 3/16"" ID tubing - it already came with that Make sure the lines are cold - they are, and the faucet itself gets cold once it starts flowing Make sure the lines are long enough - they are about 3', which according to the L = (P - (H x .5) - 1) / R formula they are more than long enough for 10psi Clean the lines - these are clean, brand-new lines Make sure the lines don't dip below the top of the keg - they're currently spooled up on top of the keg   Based on other answers and other websites, here's what I've tried:   Setting the regulator to zero, clearing CO2 from keg, then slowing raising it back up - no luck at 5, 8, 10, or 12 psi Crank up the pressure to 10-12psi directly after clearing CO2 from keg - no luck   So is there anything I can do to get this ready for tomorrow evening? Is it undercarbonated (since it tastes flat) and the pressure is wrong for pushing it out, or is it overcarbonated and the flat taste is because of the foam? Do I really need to by a tower cooler fan to blow the cold air up into the tower? Or is there no hope for having it ready by tomorrow and we just need to let it sit at 10psi for 2 weeks? "
652,"Are cheap poratable USB microscopes good enough to count yeast, and check vitality?","I have read that a 400x magnification is right for counting yeast on a hemocytometer, and also using dye to check vitality.   I'm looking at using a cheap portable $50 USB microscope. They are rated up to 800x magnification. I suspect that the advertised magnification also factors in digital zooming on these devices. Digital zooming is not magnification. They also seem to have cameras that say 3M or more with interpolation when they are actually 2M or less cameras.   Has anyone tried using these to count yeast? Would I be better of investing in a regular microscope, and buying a camera to fit it?  I will probably buy the cheap USB microscope anyway for other uses like electronics. "
653,"Troubleshooting new keggerator equipment - sanke tap, gas manifold, etc","I've been using a converted chest freezer for nearly a year now for storing and dispensing from corny kegs and for lagering. Depending on whether I have kegs of homebrew, I may have a sanke keg of commercial brew.   I just added two pieces of equipment to the system: a one-to-three gas manifold and a second sanke tap and hooked up two sixth barrel kegs from the same brewery. There was a large discrepancy in how the two kegs dispensed -- one was slow, as if there was almost no pressure; the other was way too pressurized and foamy.  When I adjust gas settings at all -- change pressure on the regulator, bleed gas with pressure relief valve, etc. -- the system hums like a harmonica. This may have come from one of the pressure relief valves (on the sanke tap or on the manifold) and seemed to be a red flag. I have not been able to detect any leaks. Upon visual inspection, everything seems fine as well.  My question is this: Why would these two identical kegs fitted with identical taps filled with beer from the same brewery dispense so dramatically differently? Does one tap have a defective pressure relief valve?   Secondly, a big BBQ party drained both kegs in a day, so I didn't have much time to troubleshoot. How can I further test this if both kegs are blown? "
654,Why did fermentation take so long to start?,"I boiled and pitched a low-gravity (~1.033) Scottish Ale this past Sunday.  The wort was cooled via immersion to under 75° F and then aerated via a whisk-on-drill contraption before pitching the yeast. The house has stayed at a consistent 75° F the whole time, within range of the yeast's comfort zone.   As of this morning (Wednesday), there was no activity to speak of. Despite verifying the airlock and seals were all tight, it was apparent no pressure had been generated. I removed the airlock and found neither krausen or any yeasty smell--it looked and smelled the same as before I lidded it on Sunday.  When I came home this afternoon, I was about to attempt a re-pitch when I found something rather different. The airlock was bubbling away. I popped the top I found quite a healthy-looking (if a bit dark) krausen, and a definite yeasty smell. Perhaps it wasn't quite the smell I expected (I'm not used to smelling it mid-fermentation), but it certainly smelled more of beer than of wort.  So what was going on the past three days that made the yeast take so long to kick in? Do I need to worry about acquiring an infection during this time without alcohol, and particularly having now opened the lid twice (I'd never opened it before bottling time in the past)? Or should I just relax, not worry, and drink a homebrew? "
655,Guides or tutorials for propane automated RIMS / HERMS,"I'm considering trying to piece together a propane HERMS system, inspired by the awesome-looking Blichmann Tower of Power. I know there are several well-known electric HERMS guides (e.g. The Electric Brewery and Brutus), but I want to stick with propane for now.  Are there any good build guides? Where should I start? "
656,Water Volume on Palmer's Spreadsheet,"Anyone have any experience with Palmer's Spreadsheet?  The way it was described to me and the way I read and understand it now states that for the water volume in Step 4 you just put the amount of water for the initial mash strike. So for my purposes right now only put 3 gallons, even though I will eventually have 6.25 gallons in my kettle pre-boil once the mash and sparge are complete.   Then adjust my salts and minerals for the 3 gallons until I reach the desired water profile.  I was told to then split the total salt/minerals additions into two parts.  Put one part into the mash and the other addition into the boil kettle once all the wort is collected.   Can anyone explain why you would only calculate for 3 gallons and not 6.5 gallons? Is the spreadsheet accounting for this? I feel like you would need to calculate for 6.25 gallons since that is what you would be boiling in the kettle.  I've read a lot of posts of other people saying they just put the total pre boil volume in there and not the mash sacchrifaction volume and it's starting to confuse me.   Listening to Brew Strong, Palmer states that you put only the initial 3 gallons for mash and then you have to calculate an additional salt/mineral addition for the other 4 gallons that would top off your kettle for say a 7 gallon pre boil volume. So thinking it over, was what my friend trying to tell me when he said split it into two additions, he didn't literally mean split it in half, but to do two separate additions of the equal value, since your mash &amp; sparge volumes are almost equal? "
657,Is there any danger in fermenting outside?,"Not having any cooling mechanism for my fermenter(s), this time of year I can get more favorable temperatures outside than inside.    I'm specifically talking about ciders in glass containers, but I'm also curious about hopped beer in glass and plastic containers.  (hops in glass outside is obviously bad due to UV exposure)  Is there any reason I shouldn't ferment outside, or cold crash outside? At what time in the fermentation process do I need to worry about temperature swings? UV exposure for hopped and non-hopped fermentations? "
658,Can I steep grains ahead of time?,"In an effort to spread brew day out across a few weeknights, I was wondering if there is any harm in steeping grains ahead of time?  I don't plan on leaving the ""tea"" for more than a day or two, covered, after the steep and before the boil, but would it make a difference how long it was between steps?  What would the effect be? "
659,a few questions about using carbonation stones,"Just got a carbonation stone because I want to carbonate a keg quickly and have a few questions.   Do you need any special tubing to attach the stone to the gas-in dip tube? The stone I have has a 1/4"" barb, but I wasn't sure if I needed special hoses or gas hoses for this. Also wasn't sure if it would be a good idea to have gas hoses sitting in my beer, i.e. if the plastic/vinyl they're made from is safe for long term contact with beer. I figured I would use plastic clamps here so I don't have to worry about a bad steel clamp rusting or something. Would love to see pictures of this if anyone has any.     Can you leave the stone on there for serving? I was planning to attach it to the empty keg, then siphon the into the keg beer and then seal it up and leave it on there to avoid contamination. I won't need to use it again for a while. Will yeast settling at the bottom of the cold keg clog the stone and/or prevent it from working? I was thinking of sticking the fermentor in the fridge overnight before siphoning to have some the yeast settle before transferring to the keg. Not sure if that's worthwhile though.  "
660,When To Dry Hop?,I'm working with a recipe for a black ale (Cascadian Dark Ale) and it's telling me to dry hop 0.25 oz Warrior hops and 0.5 oz Cascade hops right after transferring to the carboy.  I had read that the best time to dry hop was after some of the fermentation had already taken place.  Is this timing special to the Cascadian dark?  What are the consequences of dry hopping this early in the fermentation?  Should I adjust the recipe?  
661,Is it possible or easy to nitrogenate home brewed beer?,"I love the creamy mouthfeel of UK beers like Guinness, Belhaven, and Boddington Draught in a can. Is it possible as a home brewer to recreate this effect, which I understand is from forced-nitrogenating the beer at the time of canning? Would a bottling spigot rig and a nitrogen gas tank, similar to how forced carbonation can be done for home brewers be possible? Are there any risks/dangers with dealing with compressed nitrogen? "
662,Malt extract fermentability,"Does anyone know of resources that specify the fermentability of malt extracts like muntons and coopers?  Has anyone done a forced fermentation on these extracts who has results they are willing to share?  Also, how do  tools like hopville's beer calculus determine the fermentability of these extracts? "
663,Why is a quiet environment recommended?,"I'm brewing beer from a recipe kit, and the instructions say to put the fermenting bucket into a dark, quiet and warm place.  I do understand dark (because of UV) and warm (optimal temperature for the yeast), but I don't understand quiet?  The Environment is a room with about 8 people in it, talking to each other. So it's a bit louder than an apartment, but it's not overly loud.  Is that a problem? "
664,Troubleshooting a stuck fermentation with Ringwood Ale,"I'm brewing an IPA using Wyeast 1187 (Ringwood Ale) and it seems stuck.  I'm brewing 19L (5G) with an OG of 1.052 and pitched two (smacked) smackpacks of 1187 straight into the primary bucket.  I used a 1/2 tsp of Wyeast nutrient in the boil, too.  Temperature has been pretty even between 19-22C.  I had about 24 hours lag time before any activity, followed by furious fermentation for about 24 hours and then bubbling stopped.  It's now 5 days later and gravity is 1.026.  I'm only expecting 70% or so attenuation from using Ringwood but this seems well under (50%?).  I feel like I've done everything right (sufficient pitch rate, with nutrient, ideal temp) yet have got such a poor attenuation.  What went wrong?  Can I get it started again? "
665,How can this BeerSmith 2 gravity calculation be correct?,"My beersmith brew sheet printout gives me some gravity numbers that I can't make head or tail of:    How can the pre-boil gravity (when I haven't added 57% of the malt yet) be 1,084, while the post-boil gravity is only 1,048? Has it added the top-up water to the bottom calculation, or something?  Update:  I've now brewed this beer. The measured pre-boil gravity was 1.023. I did not remember to measure the post-boil gravity, but after adding 10 l of water and 1,8 l of starter, the measured OG was 1.046 and the batch volume was 22,5 l. "
666,"Deep cleaning equipment after ""brett"" contamination","A Few Contaminated Batches  Although most of my beers have been coming out 'clean', I've had a couple of my beers show up with what I think might be bretanomyaces or some other 'bug'.  The contamination shows-up after they're bottled and have sit at room temperature for a while.  It has that slight ""cherry pie"" flavor that shouldn't be there.  Oxi-Clean and Star-San  My standard cleaning process includes overnight soak of the auto siphon and plastic carboy with Oxi-Clean Free.  I put about 1/2 cup of Oxi-Clean into the carboy with 5 gallons of hot (120F) city tap water and pump it through the auto siphon.  The next day all visible material adhering to the carboy walls is gone. I triple rinse with city tap water.  I then put a few cups of properly mixed Star-San solution into the carboy, pump it through the auto siphon, swirl to hit all interior surfaces, dump the Star-San and store the equipment. Before using the carboy or auto siphon again, I repeat the Star-San step.  I don't think the contamination is from my counterflow chiller, but I'll mention that I store it full of Star-San, then during the boil, I run boiling wort through it without the chilling water turned on.  So it sits at well over 150F for 10 minutes before I start the chilling process.  Salvaging Equipment  Apparently my sanitation practices are not good enough. I presume the problem is in the carboy and racking (I don't ever secondary, just bottle).  So the question is, what should I do to ""bring out the big guns"" from a cleaning perspective.  An easy step 1 is to throw out all my vinyl hoses.  Consider that done!.  But what to do about my auto siphon, which I'd hate to throw out.  And also my plastic carboys.  I don't see any scratching on them, and I've kept from using brushes on them, ever.  Bringing Out the Big Guns for Cleaning/Sanitizing  What more powerful cleaning solutions are available to me?  Bleach? Boiling water? I saw something in another post about quat or something like that?  I have not used PBW, and understand it's different than Oxi-Clean, but is that going to make the difference?  I don't want to get into a religious rant about sanitizers, but is Star-San letting me down? I've never used Iodaphor, and don't know much about it.  Should I use a powerful ""yes-rinse"" sanitizer first, and a no-rinse sanitizer after?  If you have suggestions, please recommend specific concentrations. "
667,Transporting Pressurized CornyKegs,"I wanted to get a batch ready for labor day, so I purchased some kegging equipment and opted to keg this beer.  However, I am driving 5ish hours to a lake, where I plan to keep the keg in a ice bath once I get there.  For the transportation:  1.)  Should I keep the CO2 tank hooked up (particularly if its carbed to my liking prior to departure)?  At what PSI?  I realize I will need it once I get there at low PSI to dispense.    2.)  I have no way to keep it cold during the ride, other than some ice packs  3.)  Is it ok to keep the keg on its side during the ride?  4.)  How long should I let it sit once we arrive? "
668,Brewing 10 litres in a 25 litre fermentation vessel?,"I'm a novice and have just started home brewing from a complete starters kit.  The kit came with 2x25 litre fermentation vessels and a kit that makes 20 litres.  I've been looking at some beer kits which brew 10 litres, and I'm wondering if it's okay to brew them in the 25 litre fermentation vessel - does it make any difference, or should I be using a smaller vessel?  I don't know if lots more air being in the vessel would make the brewing more difficult (eg. would it be harder to control the temperature?)  Any advice is greatly appreciated.  Thanks! "
669,Advice for IPA recipe (with dry mouthfeel),"I have a very simple IPA recipe with a twist which I really liked.  It's a single malt (Pale malt, 7EBC Full-grain),  single hop IPA, but I 'dryhopped' it with tea.   Single temperature mash @ 66C/150F, for 60 minutes OG:1070Gr/l,  Yeast is dry Safale US05. One package (11.5gr) on a 19L batch. don't have my notes here but I think FG was between 1018 or such.  I would like to tweak the recipe in order to achieve a more 'dry' or crisp mouthfeel and flavor (less 'sticky', sugary, syrupy, 'full', malty).   I suspect that would allow the tea flavour to come out and shine a bit more.  What are some approaches to consider?   mash at lower temps (which temps? any specific advice, schedules would be a great help, etc) replace % of the malts with rice? (like kuhnhenn double rice IPA) replace % of the malts with sugar or syrup? use a different yeast with higher attenuation? Which ones?   are some of the approaches I've read about, but I'm unsure.  Any of these a good idea? Are there other ways? "
670,How To Send Beer Cross Country?,I live in California and I have some friends in Illinois who I would like to swap beers with.  What is the best (cheap/safe) way to send a small amount of bottled beer (maybe 1-6 12oz bottles) to someone?  It it even legal to mail beer across state lines? 
671,Making a starter when reusing yeast,"I want to reuse the washed yeast from a previous batch of beer in my next batch. Should I make a starter for it? If so, how much of it? I looked at MrMalty, and it seems to me they tell me not to make a starter for this. So how much yeast starter should I make? Should I just repitch the washed yeast? "
672,Racking a carbonated beer from a keg back to the fermenter,"Long story short, I have a wheat beer that has a weird band-aid phenol that isn't going away.  Rather than dumping, I thought I would try racking to a new fermentor, adding chopped dried apricots, and pitching a bit more yeast.    The only issue is that this beer has already been carbonated with forced CO2.  Is it possible to take a carbonated, flawed beer back to the drawing board?  More simply, if a beer has carbonation, is it possible to conduct a secondary fermentation?    This actually turned out quite well.  Not ideal, but better than dumping it.  Not huge on fruit beer, but great aromatics, very clean and drinkable, wslightly acetic/tart.  Good move to try to save a beer (in lieu of the fruit, sour,age method!) "
673,Options to improve clarity and reduce sediment in a barrel conditioned lager,"My home-brew lager that I start secondary fermentation (in May) still hasn't settled, we have had spells of warm weather, and my beer still isn't clear... it has been further delayed as I had to vent the gas due to high pressure causing  leak, so this had made sediment rise again. It's been 1mnth untouched and still isn't clear enough... is there anything I can do to speed the process ?  I.E. if I moved it outside, would that cause too much movement and rise the sediment, or do you think I would be safe? we have a cool few days coming with cold winds.    "
674,Harvested Yeast - What are these layers and do I have too much?,"I harvested yeast a few weeks back from my hefeweizen (Wyeast 3068) which I had open fermented. To harvest, I scrapped it right off the top, after ~36 hours of fermenting, with a sanitized spoon. I then plopped it in my sanitized mason jar. I am now looking to use this yeast again, and noticed a few things when I pulled the mason jar from the fridge, which leads to my questions.   There appears to be two VERY SLIGHTLY distinct layers of yeast sediment on the bottom of the jar. Is one of these good, and the other bad? To me, this looks like a ton of yeast. Based upon the answer to the previous question...would you pitch all the 'good' yeast in this jar, or try to only pitch a portion of it? And would you make a starter?    "
675,"Wild fermentation with improvised equipment, any advice?","First some background. I am in Indonesia for a bit, separated from my equipment and have had a chance to make the native fermented rice dish tape hitam (basically red rice wine without straining, eaten like a porridge.  Yes, this is beer you can eat with a fork, quite literally!).  Tape Hitam uses a mixture of cultures similar to Sake or Chinese Red Rice Wine.  I have also had Tape Putih, which is fermented cassava root using a similar process.  At least with Tape Hitam, typically the rice is just covered with a banana leaf.  No full seal or airlock is used, though the fermentation is only a few days at (tropical, no-air-conditioning) room temperature.  A few days ago, I had what I thought at the time was intentionally fermented soursop (you may know the fruit as guanabana).  It turned out it was not intentionally fermented, but was tasty anyway and rather intoxicating.  So I figured I would try to reproduce this, possibly using it as a basis for wines made from local fruit, etc.  So my current plan (which sounds really odd to me and my 20 years of brewing experience) is to follow the process that lead to the unintentional fermentation and do as follows:  let 1-2 soursops fully ripen and begin to go past their ideal ripening point, then scoop out the flesh (omitting any rotten spots) and put in an enclosed tupperware dish in the refridgerator for 2 weeks.  I might add some coconut sugar or honey but haven't decided yet.  After 2 weeks I will sample and if it is any good will mix in other fruit as I feel like, and grow the fermented fruit at that point kind of like a sourdough culture, preparing of course for some spoilage at some point.  If I can get an airlock (and maybe even if I can't), I hope to try to use this as a culture for making mead as well, probably in one of the water dispenser bottles.  Has anyone done anything like this?  Any tips or tricks?  Or am I pretty much in uncharted territory here? "
676,Galvanized steel off-flavor?,"I brewed my first beer with maris otter and it came out with an ashtray/cigarette flavor. At first I assumed it had something to do with the maris otter, but later I noticed my mash tun hose clamps where completely discolored. I guess they were galvanized not stainless. Is this the source of the off flavor? Is it safe to drink? "
677,how well to strain wort after boil,"Just wondering how well you folks strain your wort when transferring to primary.    I brewed my first batch last night and, aside from forgetting to take an OG reading, everything went well.  However, I was surprised at the amount of trub in the wort.  As I was poring the wort into the fermenter using a cheap strainer, I couldn't help but wonder if I should be taking more care during this step.  I have a typical wire mesh strainer, like you might find at Target, which catches most of the trub but probably lets plenty through as well, that I used last night.  I've read somewhere (Palmer?) that you can line it with a couple layers of cheesecloth.  I also have a fine mesh strainer (like you might use to strain a consomme or something), but it would probably take upwards of 20-30 minutes to strain 3 gallons of wort through it.  I tend to think that the cheap strainer sans cheesecloth is probably fine, especially since I'll rack to a secondary before bottling anyway.    Any thoughts, or accepted 'best practices' for this step? What ill effects could too much trub have in the fermentor? "
678,How do I stop my damson cordial from starting to ferment?,"Anyone ever made Damson cordial ?   I am very new to making cordials and as I have a high yield of damsons usually, I am just trying to see if cordial is an option rather than just wine and liqueur, but I am not getting it right clearly.   I have so far made two batches, but I am trying to stop it fermenting.   First batch, I just made and bottled into plastic bottles. Bubbles appeared in the bottles pretty much straight away even though I put the bottles in the fridge straight away. it didn't matter if I shook the bottles to try to disperse the bubbles they did not go away. I had to then make sure that I did not leave the lids on tight as the bottles ""fizzed"" when opening them.     The 2nd batch, I decided to pasteurise I followed all instructions correctly. I put this batch in glass bottles but on pouring in the hot cordial, bubbles at the top would not disperse no matter what.  So being concerned that this meant fermenting was happening  I took one bottle and kept it in the fridge, the rest I diluted with water to make just a damson drink and re bottled into plastic bottles, keeping the lids loose.  Again they all have bubbles, so does this mean they are fermenting (thus turning into alcohol)?  For the record, I used up my frozen damsons' from last years yield.   I would appreciate any advice on this.  "
679,Mosaic Hop Issue,"I'm trying to do some hop analysis based on a single hop IPA with some dry hopping on it.  I often drink some industrial beers simply based on Mosaic hop, and I do love it. But when i use it, it keeps me bringing so much passion fruit flavor and aroma, more than usual.  Is there some interaction with my malts chosen? I'm using carared, pilsen and melanoidin. Or it's related to the yeast (US-05)?  "
680,Creating a fruit saison: when to add the fruit and rack to secondary?,"I want to create a fruit saison, I used some interesting hops (centenial and citra) and intend to rack to secondary ontop of the fruit puree (I will also dry hop with citra).  The question I now have is when do I need to rack to secondary? The questions here Fruit Beer: When to rack to secondary?  states 2-3 weeks, but does not really say what I'm looking for to see (e.g. a certain gravity). Saison is notoriously slow for fermentation (wyeast 3427).   So if anyone could give me some indication what to look out for that would be great.   Another thing that I would need help with is: how much fruit (apricots in syrup) do I use? My batch is about 30 liters. "
681,Preboil volume doesn't fit my pot,"I did my last batch of extract lately and aiming to make all grain from now on. Since my biggest stainless cauldron has 12 or 13 liters capacity, I realised that my 5 gallon carboy wasn't fit for my situation, so I bought a 3 gallon on Kijiji. You may already see my problem here ;) The preboil volume must be higher than that. I red somewhere that it would be something like 4 gallons for a 3 gallons batch (Theres a more precise way to evaluate this)  My question is : Is there a ""workaround"" for my situation or I'm just doomed and have to buy a 100-200$ 5 gallons pot? Can I just add water afterward ? I guess not.. Any magical tricks? lol  Thanks   EDIT : This post is also a good ressource for this topic "
682,How to make Hard Soda,"I have been doing research on making a hard soda but I am never able to find anything that is able to completely describe the process, I have a bottle of orange extract that I would like to use.    Are there specific measures of sugar to water I would use and could pure cane sugar be used?  Also how long would something like this ferment and at what temperature? Lastly would Ale yeast be used or a wine/ champagne yeast?  "
683,Helping a first timer!,"I'm hopefully about to make my first batch of sparkling slightly sweet cider. I have read all sorts of advice about reducing/increase tannin, stabilising and other scientific stuff. I want to keep it simple as possible first time.   Have I got a rough grasp of the process and please correct any steps I have wrong? I will be sterilising all equipment and will try to stay as clean as possible. Based on 5 gallon batch   After juicing add 4/5 campden tablets to 27 litre fermentation bucket, leave in warm place for 24hrs? Mix in yeast and add cider nutrient and pectolase? Do I add artificial non fermenting sweetner at this point, if so how much? Along with 3/4lbs sugar? Hope to achieve 6-7% abv. Half fill bubbler air lock with water should I add campden to this solution? Move to storage around 20°C - 25°C for 10 -14 days or bubbles stop. Take hydro reading. Bottle into glass bottles and add one tea spoon sugar and cap off. Leave for  24/48 hours in warm place, before moving to cooler steady place? How long before cider is drinkable, I would rather wait rather than rush it. Anything I should do to give it a rich toffee flavour?    If you think some of the process is not required please say.  Please feel free to point out the obvious I've missed. Is the process the same for filling demijohn's I have siphons and bottlers with sediment traps. Do I leave bubbler in demijohn or replace with rubber bung after fermenting?  All advice greatly appreciated.  Cheers Craig. "
684,What is the ideal temperature during carbonation with priming for an ale?,"During sugar priming, how does the temperature influence?  In my understanding, higher the temperature, faster the carbonation process. But can this somehow produce some off-flavors on the beer?  Too high temperatures can damage the yeasts and prejudice the carbonation?  In other words, what is the ideal temperature for carbonation?  I am brewing an ale. "
685,Is **long** wort aeration a feasible alternative to using pure oxygen?,My idea is that instead of using pure oxygen to reach higher DO levels (fx 12ppm) one could use aeration that will only reach 8ppm. But since the purpose is to give the yeast access to enough oxygen that it will use for reproduction the yeast will consume the oxygen in the wort and if we by aeration keeps the DO level there would be the same amount of oxygen available to the yeast eventually.   Is this an feasible approach? And if so how long should one aerate in order to get the benefits of higher DO levels? 
686,Step by Step homebrewing from extract - need verification and clarification,"I am sorry for the long thread, but I am digging the net for few days now and did not find such a ""tutorial"", so I will built my own and want to share it. I will be happy you comment/correct me, and I have some questions at the end.  So I brew few amber ale from extract kit (very successfully) and want to try something new. I want to brew wheat beer with honey, and wish it will be as clear as possible (I know wheat beer should get the haze, but I am trying something here :)  I am using this recipe with small amount of changes. my steps should be:   Heat 21 Litre (5.5 Gallon) of water to 70 C (155F) Take the flaked wheat and oats, put it in a steeping bag and steep the grains for 30 minutes Take out the bag of grain and wash it with small amount of water at 80C (175F) - few times with ladle - not squeezing the bag. Get to boiling point Add the DME once the water is boiling and mix it. Add hops for 60 mins (the only one in this recipe) In the last 15 mins add the immersion chiller for sanitizing. Add Honey and orange peel Add whirlfloc tab After 15 mins turn the flame out. Start chilling Rehydrate the yeast with 110 ML (4 oz) - 40C (105F) of the wort for 15 minutes. Once the wort is 24C (75F) whirlpool it and start siphoning it to the primary fermentation without trub as you can. Stir the wort to add oxygen Take OG value Add the rehydrated yeasts Close, add the airlock, and put it for few days in 22C (70F) After the bubbles in the airlock are at much lower rate (±5 days), take gravity value once a day. After 2 days with no change transfer it to secondary (slowly, not to oxygen). Take FG value and calculate ABV Give it another ±10 days. Cold crash for 3 days at 2-3C (35-37F) Boil 2 cups of water and add 220g (7.7oz) of corn sugar (calculator). Let it cool to 25C (77F) Add it to the priming bucket, and slowly siphon the beer from the secondary (without trub as possible). Bottle it. Give it another 2 weeks at 22C (70F) Cold it to 3C (37F) 24 hours before drinking. Enjoy   What do you think about the process and steps? My questions for perfectly understand the process are:   Full boil or partial boil? I read a lot of pro and cons, but if I understand correctly, clearer and tastier beer will be a result of full boil wort. Should I use Gelatin after transferring to secondary for clearer beer? or will the affect be very tiny and not worth it? What will happens if I will use Lager dried yeasts instead of Ale, will it be clearer? of course I will use Lager fermentation rules (temperature, diacetyl rest, lagering). in general - can Ale or any other beer can be made with Lager yeasts? Should I use DME or LME? If I am understood correctly, DME will give me lower SRM, right? any other differences? Will late adding the extract (DME or LME) will help the beer to be clearer or lighter in color?   I know it is not common to publish such a huge detailed question, but I wanted to gather it all in one place for the new brewers as well.  Thanks in advance. "
687,Are protein rests worthwhile in BIAB?,I've had problems with low efficiency when I have a large percentage of wheat in my BIAB batches. I am planning a Hefeweizen recipe that will be 60% white wheat malt and I want to get it right this time.    Does anyone have experience with doing a protein rest in BIAB? Does anyone think this might improve my efficiency issue?    My biggest concern is rising up to the full mash temp after the protein rest without over shooting. It's difficult for me to adjust the temp in a 10 gallon batch once the grain is in the kettle.  
688,When should you treat your water for pH for a sour beer?,"According to this question's answer, from Denny Conn,      You don't pretreat the water because it's the mash pH you're concerned with, not the water pH.   And this agrees with this article on the power of pH,      Malted barley contains phosphates, which are acidic buffers. Making a mash of grain mixed with water will cause the phosphate buffers to achieve a natural pH of around 5.6. Therefore, it does not matter what the initial pH of your brewing water is because the interaction between ions in water and buffering components of the malt will always change the water pH.   But in this Gose recipe by Gordon Strong     On brew day, prepare your ingredients; mill the grain, measure your hops, and prepare your water. This recipe uses reverse osmosis (RO) water. Add 1⁄4 tsp. 10% phosphoric acid per 5 gallons (19 L) of brewing water, or until water measures pH 5.5 at room temperature. Add 1 tsp. calcium chloride (CaCl2) to the mash.   According to this fast souring article,      After your saccharification rest is complete, reduce the pH of the wort to 4.5 by addition of food grade lactic or phosphoric acid.   So what I'm gathering from all this is that you treat your mash to be between 5.2 and 5.5 for the purpose of ensuring the mash converts efficiently, and you treat your wort, post mash, to make it more friendly to your lacto inoculation (although, this is not specifically in Gordon's recipe).    Does this sound correct, and if so, is Gordon's recommendation to treat the water incorrect, or does it have to do with the RO water?  For a sour, would you treat the wort pH post mash or post sparge? Or does it matter at that point?   If it matters, I am batch sparging.  "
689,Can you increase the pH for the boil after kettle souring?,"This question's answer led me to [website]Since there's a few methods for making sour beer, I should mention I've been doing what some call a kettle sour (or fast sour) where I do a mash, then a full boil, then sour the beer using l plantarum in a sealed keg purged with CO2, then do another full boil (topping up with water) then ferment as a standard ale, then keg for carbonation.   One of the issues I've had with sour beer is DMS, really with any pilsner as well. (This is why I am now doing a full boil before kettle souring.) It turns out, there are some reasons for it, as according to the article on DMS   For one, I'm boiling at 6500 ft elevation, so my boiling temp is ~199F/93C (instead of 212F/100C)     It has long been reported that the half-life of SMM doubles for every 6°C cooler, meaning that at 95°C the half-life is ~70 minutes   And two, especially important for sour beers     pH plays a role in the reduction of SMM to DMS, with a higher pH reducing the half-life of SMM   Meaning I really need to be boiling for >2 hours to be rid of DMS for an ale! For a sour, the pH may be in the 3.4 range, where SMM half-life is now 142 at 200F/94C.   Empirically, I've been having good success with a 75 minute boil for a standard ale. My ales do not have significant DMS with that boil time.  Does this mean I need a 284 minute (nearly 5 hour) boil for a sour beer at elevation to remove DMS!?!?!? (I am doubling the half-life after adjusting for both temperature (elevation) and acidity (pH).) If I do a full boil before souring, and a full boil after souring, do these add together? Or, not really, since each boil went above 80C, each boil needs to be figured independently?  Lastly, the question this has been leading up to, after the kettle sour portion is finished, can I raise pH to 5.2 using Calcium Carbonate to increase the DMS boil-off without altering the taste? Or will that kill the ""sourness"" by reducing the acidity?  "
690,is my cider infected or is this normal for safaleUS05,"Made a batch of cider with granny smith apples 13%brix. Juiced my self. used half or maybe less of Kmeta than what is suggested on the packet  July 3: saf-ale US05 yeast. Starter was 2L apple juice with 1 packet left to ferment for 24 - 48 hours. took a couple of days to start fermenting. Apple juice was very appley and nice.  July 8: I wanted to try adding  pectic enzyme at the start of fermenting.  July 10: Started tasting and smelling like vomit and it lost the strong apple smells and tastes. Had milky haze that would stick to the side of drinking glass.  22 July: vomit smell/taste was gone and juice sweet but insipid 7%brix  I want to re-use the yeast but am concerned the yeast might be infected with something. Perhaps cider sickness? seems strange to get infected while fermenting though. Is this to be expected from safale US05(first time using it) when used with cider,or could it be the pectic enzyme addition, while fermenting giving off the vomit smell?  edit:  want to use the yeast for beer. "
691,Sparkling Blackberry Wine,"Can I add priming sugar to a finished wine to carbonate it when I bottle it? I plan on fermenting about a month before I bottle it, would the yeast still be alive at that time? "
692,specific gravity in wine making,"I'm trying to make wine out of pomegranate juice, its almost a month that the must is fermenting but when I read the specific gravity with the hydrometer is always around 0.008. If a try to calculate the ABV with an online calculator or with the formulas is always a negative number, am I doing something wrong?? "
693,What's the difference between isinglass and gelatin?,For one I have read that if after the yeast is settled and the yeast is stirred up (for whatever reason) then gelatin will not help dropping the yeast out while isinglass will. Also I've read the complete opposite. Which one is true? Of course as I've read both I'd expect a good source for the claim.  Are there other differences between them? More than ethic/religious aspect of sourcing the collagen (I assume that pig gelatin is not kosher for example). 
694,Does diastatic power reduce with age? Old grain,"Anyone have definitive info if diastatic power is reduced with grain age? If so, any data to estimate current DP?  Brewing with some pretty old 2-row today. It has been stored properly for 1.5 years, temperature never got above 80°F, it never got damp, and the grain still smells and tastes fresh; it has been stored in air tight container.  I'm having beta-amylase conversion issues. Time seems to be letting it work though it, but it's been mashing for 3 hours now and the iodine test is still slightly dark. In the past with this same recipe I've had clear tests in 30 minutes.  24lb 2-row,  2lb flaked maize in the mash,  0.31gal water/grist ratio  Dough in had a rough start, forgot to read grain temp before strike water calc, estimated 80°F but, must have been closer to 70°F. 142 hit, 148 was target. Fired up RIS to bring up, applied some mash run flame while stirring. Brought it up to 148 and held for 1.5h, stepping up to 158 slowly now. To see if alpha-amylase is pooched too.  I guess it's possible some amylase denatured from direct flame, but I can't see it reducing the DP below 30 for this grain bill, I was really stirring well. "
695,stirring or degassing wine,"If I stir my wine after the first racking, won't that stir up all that sediment?  Will that give the wine a bad taste and will it reduce the ABV?  I  don't want to do either one. Obviously this is my first time making wine.  I racked it from the primary to the carboy 4 days ago. "
696,How can I save a wine with SG way too high?,"I am attempting to make a blackberry wine from blackberries picked in my yard.  I followed a recipe found online, adding sugar disolved in water to a bunch of mashed up berries in a mesh bag, etc.  I already added campden tablets, yeast nutrient, pectic enzyme and acid blend according to recipe and then waited 24 hours to pitch red wine yeast.  I got worried because I didn't see fermentation starting, so I took a reading and was surpised by the very high gravity (1.13).  I assume the sugar content is too high for fermatation to happen correctly.  The question is, what do I do now?  I was thinking that perhaps I should split the must into two buckets and add water to each and then re-pitch?  Would that even work?  Will the wine taste really weird because there isn't enough fruit juice in each?  Could I add more fruit and basically start the process over adding adjusted amounts of pectice enzyme / acid blend / yeast nutrient? "
697,Can I add too much opti-red?,I have some extra opti-red from last year that I'd like to use up.  Is there a danger if I add too much of it?  Should I just toss it?  What are the cons of opti-red?  Can it make the wine taste more artificial or flabby?  [website]
698,How is the length of each fermentation determined?,"When crafting an original recipe, how do brewers determine the length of time at each stage of fermentation?  Obviously, several factors weigh in, including the exact composition of the wort, the amount of yeast added, the temperature, etc., but do you use the gravity alone to determine whether it's done?  Furthermore, what are the signs that a beer is done with a secondary fermentation, and that it is ready to be bottled or kegged? "
699,"Help! My homebrew keg froze, I brought it in, and now the beer is all foam.","I had my twin corny-keg setup in the garage in a refrigerator. The fridge kept it about 34 F degrees all summer, and I had the CO2 dialed just right.   Well, it dropped down to about -5 F and my beer froze inside the refrigerator. (Not solid - but it turned ""slushy"")  I brought the keg inside, and it's at about 43 degrees now. When I try to pour a beer all I get is foam.  Is this just because it's too warm now? Or did freezing it affect the beer (and it's CO2 absorption) in a bad way?  Is there a way to fix this, and get my keg flowing again? "
700,Basic equipment needed for all grain brewing,"   Possible Duplicate:   What is the minimum amount of equipment to dabble in All-Grain?       I'm considering working on my first all-grain brew batch. What are the bare essentials of equipment to do all-grain?

701,High-gravity beer stored too cold to carbonate during bottle conditioning. How can I carbonate this beer?,"I made a strong scotch ale.  Bottled it up, 2 weeks later no carbonation.  Is there a way to save this batch? OG 1.095,  Used Safale US-05,  2 weeks in primary,  6 weeks in secondary,  FG 1.030,  I used corn sugar to prime and I was pretty careful to mix it. I stored the bottles at 60 degrees for 2 weeks after I bottled (I know, too cool) I have now moved them to 70 degrees.  If the storage in the warm doesn't produce carbonation, what would you do next? "
702,Krausen During Primary,"I'm wondering what other peoples' experiences are with krausen at the start of fermentation.  I've had some beers that have bubbled along happily without producing huge amounts of foam, and others that seem like they'll neve stop spuming.  This weekend we started a stout and I installed a small plastic airlock.  By 7 AM the next morning there was krausen up through the airlock, down the sides of the carboy, and trickling away in a tiny stream.  I cleaned everything up and switched to a larger diameter hose with its end in a bucket of water so the foam had somewhere to go, but there seems to be substantial quantities of wort being lost by this (I'd estimate 1/3 gallon in this case).  Are there things I can do to control this?  Are there ingredients, or styles of beer, or strains of yeast that tend more towards producing big, frothy krausen?  How are other people dealing with this? "
703,Why does my beer smell like bananas?,"The Imperial Stout I recently bottled, smells a little fruity, and has a strong tart taste up front.  Is this something I should be patient with, as it may go change? And, how'd it happen? "
704,What about corking beer?,"I'd like to start corking some of my more delicate brews. Is there a reason to switch to corking? Certain styles? And, is it difficult/recommended for a small setup? Thanks. "
705,What software do most brewers use?,Just curious what most brewers are using these days as far as software goes.  We are going to have to make a decision in the near future about this.  BeerSmith? ProMash? BeerTools? Any others I haven't heard of? 
706,Too long in Primary Fermentation?,"What's the maximum amount of time for primary fermentation, assuming the beer is going straight to bottles next? Will it over ferment and then fail to carbonate, if left too long in a carboy? "
707,Spigots: What's the consensus,"I like to use an ale pail with a spigot for my secondary. It makes it super easy to test the gravity before actually bottling/kegging/etc.  However, that sort of installation in plastic can open the process up to contamination, more so than other routes. Of course, opening the lid and putting a turkey baster in there isn't so safe either.  What are some solutions for testing gravity in the secondary without opening up the container fully? What are your thoughts on a spigot? "
708,What are your homebrew club dues?,"I moved to a new area without an existing homebrew club.  We've been around for about 18 months now and I'd like to start doing some official stuff.  The Sudzers, my previous club charged $20 a year to be an official member.  I'm not entirely sure what they paid for.  Do you pay club dues?  What do they go to? "
709,How to store beer,"When you buy beer that you plan to keep for a while (a while being more than a month or so), what's the best way to store it?  Specifically, what are the rules for storing it cold or warm, on it's side or upright, and any other considerations? "
710,Why smell before tasting?,"Why does everyone insist on smelling a beer before tasting it?  To me, I don't want any preconceived notions about what it may or may not taste. You ever see a trailer for a movie and you think it's going to be awesome. Then you go see it and realize it's only so-so?  The aroma is a big factor, don't get me wrong, and adds to the total experience of a new beer. But I don't drink beer for the smell. "

714,First Time Homebrewer Setup,"There was a request for difficult questions, but having never brewed, this is all I've got:  Can you describe the most basic setup (preferably one with a reasonably low difficulty and high success rate) for a first time brewer?  Information on where to purchase and likely cost would also be useful.  This is not limited to a specific type of beer, so a variety of answers are welcome.  Stout, ale, pilsner, IPA?  There are beginner's guides all over the internet, sure, but none of them are from This Trusted Resource.  ;) "
715,Using coffee in beer,"Last weekend I brewed a super classic, nothing special stout. I plan to add coffee to it in the secondary, and didn't want any craziness from the stout itself so that I could really play with the coffee flavors.  I think I'm going to rack it into a bunch of growlers / 1 gallon jugs so that I can play with the coffee a bit.  I've heard that you shouldn't actually brew it, as this will add some acids and other super bitter things that you just don't want.  For this batch, I'm going for a super aromatic, super fresh coffee flavoring. But, I'm curious about coffee use in general.  Some questions I have:   What is a ""standard"" amount of coffee to use per gallon? Should the coffee be ground smooth, coarse, or just the beans (unground)? Should it be in a hop bag or just thrown into the mix? Any other thoughts on using coffee?  "
716,Techniques for making Belgian Candy Sugar,"I'd like to know a couple of things:  Did you make dark or light?  What procedure did you use/recommend?  Did you try to make rocks or did you just make sheet candy and break it up?  Did you use cane sugar or beet sugar?  (although there shouldn't be a difference, sucrose is sucrose)  What was your brewing experience with it?  If any of you could answer all or some of these questions I would be grateful. We've made clear sheet sugar and honestly ended up with a much sweeter/hotter beer than we got with candy sugar purchased at our LHBS.  "
717,Using bacon in beer,"I've heard rumor of people figuring out a way to do this without getting all the grease into the beer as well. If you want to add bacon flavoring to a beer, how do you do it? I know you can use some smoked grains and other things like that, but I want the real thing. One method I heard of was baking it rather than frying it.   Has anyone used bacon in a beer? If so, how? Has anyone tried a beer with bacon in it? Does anyone have any ideas on the best way to use bacon in a beer? What styles support bacon?  "
718,Is my yeast dead?,"I'm in the middle of bottling my stout right now. The OG was 1.070, and the gravity almost a month ago (11/24) was 1.024. I added 3/4 cup priming sugar in about 3 cups of water, and bottled about 20 bottles. Then I decided to check the gravity (forgot earlier. oops). And it's 1.022. Is 3/4 priming sugar in 4 gallons of beer enough to change the gravity significantly? Is my yeast dead? Or is something else going on entirely?  I'm using WLP007 (Dry English Ale) "
719,Opinions on the BJCP,Are you a BJCP certified judge?  How does it affect and influence your homebrewing? 
720,Storing bottle conditioned beers and carbonation,"I store all my beer at 55°F(12.7°C). Do I need to worry about the beers that are bottle conditioned not being carbonated, or not being at the proper carbonation level? Should they already be carbonated when I purchase them? The main reason for this question is the issues Lost Abbey and the Bruery were having with carbonation. A friend suggested I let all my Lost Abbey stuff sit around 70°F (21°C) and shake it up a bit every once in a while for a few months. Is this a good suggestion? "
721,Using Plastic Water Jugs as Fermenters,"I asked this on Twitter a while back, but I thought I might get some other thoughts on it. I have one of those 5g Poland Spring water jugs. If I get a bung that fits it, is there any reason I couldn't use it as a fermenter (either primary or secondary?). Some people have said it should be fine, others have said that ""chemicals in the plastic"" will leech into my beer and produce off-flavors. I find this latter argument difficult to accept given that those same chemicals don't leech into the water that the jugs held. Thoughts one way or the other? "
722,Amount of Water to Boil for Wort,"If I'm making a 5 gallon batch of beer, how much water should I use for my wort? Papazian's book says to use 1.5g and add it to 3.5g of room temperature water already in the carboy. I see how this would be helpful because it would help to cool the wort down quicker to pitch, and I wouldn't have to worry necessarily about the glass breaking. I've also seen other resources (including something, I think, through this site) recommending that for a 5g batch you boil all 5g in your wort. What are the pros and cons of the latter method? Thanks in advance "
723,Cold Conditioning in carboy vs keg,"I have a wheat and a golden ale, both in 5 gal carboys, that have been in secondary fermentation for 2 weeks. I was planning on letting them settle for another week and then transferring them to kegs for 2 weeks of cold conditioning before carbonating.   Should I cold condition them in the carboy or would it be better to cold condition in the keg? If I cold condition in the keg will it hurt to also carbonate at the same time or would be better to carbonate after 2 weeks of conditioning?  I have never cold conditioned before am an not sure what to do. I am leaning toward cold conditioning them in the keg so I can bleed out any oxygen with a little Co2. "
724,How much Malto Dextrine or Cara Pils is needed to mimic higher mash temps?,"So from what I've read, a lot of professional brewers mash all their beers at the same temps (usually around 150F), and use ingredients to adjust the ""body"" or ""sweetness"" of the final beers. At their scale, its preferable to keep the mashing process identical for all their batches. I guess they find it easier to fiddle with the grain bill slightly than to adjust mash temps for each recipe.  Anyway, I am considering moving to this approach for my homebrew. My question is this, if I mash all my beers at 150F, how can I mimic mashing at, say, 152F or 154F or 156F with ingredients? Does anyone have any experience in this area? I could just start with adding 8oz of Cara Pils and seeing where that gets me, but I'd rather hear from someone who's done this alteration before, with the intent of figuring out how to translate a lower mash directly into increased CaraPils or Malto Dextrine.  (And on those same lines, having used both CaraPils and Malto Dextrine before, but not in identical beers, can anyone chime in on the differences in the final flavor between the two?)  6/29: Still hoping someone of the same opinion chimes in here. "
725,Beginner Conditioning Question,"Probably a stupid question, but..... After I bottle and cap the beer do I store the beer in the fridge? Dark but No Fridge? I think I have done a decent job so far, and would hate to FUBAR everything up at this point!  If it helps the kit I purchased is for a Weizenbier....and when I said we did pretty good I mean that we only messed up and added both cans of LME to the boil at the same time instead of early in the boil and one during the last 15 mins. The maker of the kit said this it would just make a darker wheat bear but should be fine.  "
726,Using trub directly vs. yeast rinsing.,"Sometimes referred to as ""yeast washing,"" the process of yeast rinsing separates the yeast from the hops and break material in the trub.  Most brewers who reuse yeast &mdash; and store it for long periods &mdash; seem to prefer the rinsing method.  Some brewers simply store the trub in one or several sanitized jars.  After storing this trub in the fridge, they will then either reuse this yeast directly or create a starter with it.  Has anyone tried both methods?  If you reuse the trub directly, how long have you stored this yeast, and have you ever noticed off flavors?  What are the pros and cons of both methods? "
727,Covering your beer during conditioning....??,"My first batch is conditioning at room temp right now. I used brown bottles, but threw in a few greens and two cleat just for experimentation..... I have them in a fairly dark room but also covered them with a blanket to fully cut off all light! Good idea? Bad idea? Wast of time? "
728,What could cause an earthy flavour in beer?,"I've just tried the first bottle from a batch of APA I brewed and it has a very distinct (and unpleasant) earthy / peaty flavour.  Reminiscent of healthy soil.  The beer also finishes with a very sharp acidic bitterness (also unpleasant).  What could have caused this?  Is it a process error somewhere?  Infection / mishandling?  Just a poor recipe?  Is it likely to disappear with age or should I flush the lot?     Fermentables:         3kg Light malt extract (syrup)   0.5kg Dextrose         23L batch, 10L boil      Hops:         50g Willamette @ 30min   50g Amarillo @ 20 min   15g Amarillo @ 10 min         Hops left in the tub during primary (2 weeks) &amp; cold crashed for a week.

729,How to brew strong beers?,"I lived in Belgium for 2 years. Once I was in a beer brewing factory, where they said that brewing good beers is a 6 months process. Is it really true?  So, how to brew strong beers (~9%)? Like for example tripple leffe. "
730,Is a donation jar (for homebrew supplies) legal in the United States?,"If a brewer were to keep a donation jar near his kegs (i.e. tip jar), would this be strictly legal in the United States?  Sales of homebrew are prohibited, and this website states that requiring a cover charge for a party where homebrew was served would also be illegal.  But, since a dontation/tip is not required to drink the beer, would this also be prohibited?  This question is really in two parts:  1) Is it strictly legal to have a tip jar?  2) Practically speaking, does anyone ever actually get in trouble for this?  I understand that laws will vary state-to-state.  I am interested in any specific information you have, regardless of state. "
731,Target boil off percentage?,"I have heard a lot of home brewers talk about the vigorousness of the boil being quite important. Given that describing the vigor in words like ""rolling"" is ambiguous I was wondering if it makes more sense to try to tune the viroscity of the boil by tageting a particular boil off percentage?   For an hour long boil what percentage of the original volume should be lost? "
732,Differences in various Maltster's 2-Row,"How much flavor variation exists for 2-row malted barley from different malsters?  For example, how different is 2-row malt from Rahr, Briess, Canada Malting, Malteurop other than price? "
733,How much does heat affect beer?,What effects could heat have on beer and how long does it take?  Is it ok to ship beer without an icepack during the summer?  Can it survive the heat of a parked car for a few hours?  Someone out there has to have done a side-by-side experiment on this (whether intentional or unintentional). 
734,How do I clean a 5 gallon root beer keg?,"I was given a pair of Virgils kegs with root beer still in them, and I've been wanting to use them for homebrewing.  I was at a brewery tour a little while ago and I was told that it's nearly impossible to get the taste of root beer out of the keg, and that it wouldn't be a good idea to use them for brewing.  Is this the case?  Is there a way to clean all the flavor and junk out from the root beer keg?  The kegs are in very good condition, I just don't want to put my beer inside something that's going to mess with the flavor.  Thanks! "
735,Is it safe to use a chipped aluminum stock pot?,"My 32 qt. aluminum stock pot was just delivered that I was planning to use this weekend. Taking it out of the box and inspecting it, there is a fairly sizable chip on the inside about 3/4 of the way down. The chip is about 1/4 in x 3/8 in. and is chipped deep enough to expose the inner material of the pot. I was planning on using this for my batch sparge water. Do you think it is safe to use? My gut is telling me to send it back, but if I do that I won't be able to brew this weekend. What could be some of the potential negatives from using it as is?

736,Can I keep mead/wine in stainless steel bottles?,"So what do you use for bottling? I'm really starting to look into stainless steel bottles. There are companies that make them (with customized artwork, no less) for conference shwag but you could easily order a small batch and use it for your own goods.  Or can you? My wife seems convinced it won't work. Specifically, her concern is twofold, both related to aging meads/wines in them:   The seal may be unreliable. This would no doubt be an issue if you're trying to squirrel away something for a few years. We're not sure how the metal would react with it, long term. We know breweries/wineries ferment in them and maybe do some short-term aging, but what happens to stainless steel after it's been exposed to an alcoholic drink for a few years?   Anyone know much about the behavior of stainless steel in the brewing world?  Crossposted to the homebrewing community on LJ. "
737,"Ever made a ""hop tea"" to balance an overly malty beer?",I brewed a golden ale that was severely under hopped. I called my LBHS and the told me to make a hop tea to add to the keg:   1 gallon of water 1 tbsp malt extract 2 oz fresh hops boil for 60 minutes add to taste   I have hops on hand but no malt extract. What is the purpose of the malt extract? This beer is really malty as it is. Do you think just boiling hops and water will achieve the same end result? 
738,How many times can yeast be reused?,"A good yeast sample can be retrieved, stored &amp; reused regularly across brews.  Is there a limit to the number of generations a sample can last?  I've heard that after so many generations a strain can mutate into something different, is there a rule of thumb for how many uses this is?  Ignoring mutation, can yeast otherwise last forever if it's properly stored &amp; handled? "
739,"What causes ""rush"" carbonation when adding sugar?","I've just been playing with some treatments for an undercarbonated batch in bottles.  The beer is slightly carbonated, it bubbles up a little when poured, just builds no head &amp; dissipates instantly.  I thought I'd try opening a couple of bottles &amp; adding some carbonation drops, re-seal &amp; see what happens after a week or two.  I put 1 drop each in 2 bottles and 2 drops each in another 2 bottles.  When the sugar was added to the beer, it fizzed up.  The 1-drop bottles bubbled a little but I was able to get the cap on quickly enough, however the 2-drop bottles bubbled quite viciously, much like with the Diet Coke &amp; Mentos trick.  What could possibly have caused this effect?  Obviously it only occurs after conditioning has started, otherwise bottling day would be a huge mess. "
740,Is it possible to bottle condition without sediment?,I've recently been reading the labels a bit more on one of my favourite beers and have discovered that the brewers bottle condition their Pale Ale.  Yet it's sold with no signs of any flocculated yeast in the purchased product.  How is this possible?  Is some sacrifice made to prevent the sediment?  Can I do this at home? 
741,How long will an extract kit stay good?,"Ive been wanting to get into homebrewing so when I saw the Groupon for this kit [website]I put the yeast in the fridge like the box said i should, and the rest I put in the basement where it stays relatively cool  How long will this kit stay good for?  Should I have put the rest of the ingredients in the fridge too? "
742,Is there anything special needed to try brewing a Belgian Ale?,"I am a beginner looking to get started with homebrewing. Belgian Ale is my favorite style, so I was wondering if there are any specific problems with trying to do a Belgian-style Ale as my first attempt?  The answers on the what is the best type of beer to brew for a beginner and brewing ease of beer types questions mostly say to brew what you like, but I was curious if there are any specific tough problems with doing a Belgian-style Ale? "
743,Is the iodine test for starch conversion pointless?,"Looking around the web there seems to be a lot of mention of the use of the iodine (starch)  test at the end of your mash. Is it actually useful (i.e. is it reliable)? There have been times when I have done the test and it has continually returned a residual starch presence in my mash, even after having mashed for 60-90 minutes at the appropriate temperatures/mash thickness etc.  Is there some other test one can do, or do we just mash on ahead regardless? "
744,Undershooting OG in all-grain brewing,"My last few all-grain batches have been under the expected OG at least as far as the recipe is concerned. The beers still taste good and all, but I'd like to get my efficiency up.  For example, my last one I really undershot. The recipe looks like it should have been in the 1.070 range, but I only got 1.050.  I'm doing single infusion &amp; batch sparge for my mash.  I am hitting my mash temperatures pretty well (though I want to continue improving this).  What can I look into to get my efficiency up? Where am I losing sugar? "
745,At what point can a beer be called organic?,"A lot of the homebrew I make is made with organic ingredients - organic grain and hops. However, I have never come across organic yeast (!?) or irish moss. Can I rightly call this beer organic, or does the addition of yeast and irish moss relegate it to ""beer with organic ingredients""? "
746,Bottling Blended Sours,"My understanding is that it is somewhat of an inexact science/art to blend sours and especially to bottle condition them.  For the latter, you would need to have a pretty extensive understanding of not only the specific gravity, but the composition of the residual carbs in the finished/blended beer.  That being the case, we are likely bottling 15 gallons or so of year-old flanders shortly, not including any blended young beer.    Is the simplest way to ensure a consistent carbonation level to pasteurize the beer then add new sacc yeast with priming sugar?  Or would a potassium metabisulfate+potassium carbonate combo work on dropping out all the bugs like it does with yeast in ciders/wine? "
747,First brew... 1.010 gravity in 72 hours?,"I'm in the middle of my first brew and I'm having some issues. Not sure if I have completely ruined this thing or what. Heres the deal...  During the process, everything went pretty much as planned with a few exceptions. For one, the guy at that local store didn't sell me enough DME for the kit I bought (Munton's Nut Brown Ale) so I ended up using half DME and half table sugar. I researched it beforehand it saw table sugar isn't really recommended, but can do in a pinch. Since I already opened the tin with the syrup, I figured this qualified as a pinch.   Second issue... my airlock O-ring wasn't set properly. Yesterday I got concerned at the lack of bubbles in the airlock and I popped the lid and saw the O-ring wasn't set. After setting the o-ring properly and reinserting the airlock, I did indeed see a pretty frequent bubble in the airlock, say every 15 seconds or so.   Now its only day three and no bubbles at all on the airlock again. After waiting a while I decided to do a hydrometer reading. It came out as 1.010. The kit says primary fermentation should take ""4-7 days or until SG is below 1.008."" So... Whats the deal? Did I containment when I popped the lid yesterday to adjust the airlock? I did read one forum that said table sugar often ferments faster, could it just have really gone that quickly? I did not see a lot of foam, but yesterday there was a fairly small foamy head on the brew. I certainly wouldn't say I saw a ""vigorous fermentation"" like I've seen others talk about.   For what its worth, the beer LOOKS fine.   I have no problem letting it sitting for as long as it needs, but if hope is lost I'd rather start over now that I know a little better what I'm doing. I definitely admit I rushed into my first brew due to a hectic schedule with work and family.  "
748,adding hops during second fermentation,"I am just a beginner, only having my first batch currently in primary fermentation. Reading the directions that came with my kit it tells me in one step to do a second fermentation  for 2 to 4 weeks. While the next step is adding hops 1-2 weeks before bottling day. My question is if I ferment for 4 weeks then do I put the hops in during  week 2? Or do I ferment for 4 weeks then do 2 additional weeks adding the hops? Thank you in advance for any advice. "
749,How should I brew with lemongrass?,"I had a taste of Howe Sound Cloudburst Lemongrass White IPA last night, and really enjoyed the lemongrass flavour and aroma. It nicely complemented the citrusy hops.  How can I brew with lemongrass to achieve that same flavour and aroma? How much should I use?   In particular, I'd like to know: how much to use, and how long to boil it. (Or perhaps it should be added without boiling.) "
750,Sanitizing and septic tanks,"The last time I did much home brewing I was on a municipal sewer system. A little bleach or sulphite (spent hops &amp; grain, whatever) down the toilet couldn't affect it. Now that I live in the country, I worry about knocking my septic tank out of commission.  Is there a sanitizer that will do the job without snuffing the bacteria in the tank? Or is that a big worry? "
751,Using my immersion chiller in ice bath instead of wort,"I've been thinking about using my copper immersion chiller a little differently lately...  Instead of placing it in the wort near the end of the boil and circulating cold water through it, I'm thinking to place the chiller in an ice bath and circulate the wort through the chiller, either into my carboy or back into the kettle for recirculation.  I took a quick video of the setup here: [website]I liked the results I got, and it'll allow me to expose less of the surface of the wort to air which I also like, but I haven't seen this approach anywhere before... any thoughts on whether it's a good idea or not or whether it should be any better or worse than the traditional immersion chilling technique? "
752,Pumpkin Ale: what to expect?,"Recently I bought some concentrated wort at a closeout sale. 'Brew House' kits have been fairly popular here in BC and possibly elsewhere, and they can produce a drinkable beer, but it seems they're shutting down the plant. Given the choice of a wheat beer and a 'Pumpkin Ale'—the only two styles they had left—I picked up 4 Pumpkin Ales, each good for 5 gallons, at 1/2 price.  It seems I should have done some homework before rushing off to the store on their last day in business: this pumpkin ale contains actual pumpkin pulp. On the bright side, it doesn't have pumpkin pie spice and seems to have been hopped, but by God it tastes weird!  I've seen comments on other forums emphasizing that this or that pumpkin brew has a pleasant 'mouthfeel'. If it tastes lousy, mouth feel (when did the phrase become one word? just curious) hardly matters.  After 6 weeks or so it's as clear as anyone could wish, but still has this unmistakable pumpkiny flavor. I've had beers transform with ageing, from 'toss it down the sink' to 'glad I didn't', but I really don't know about this one. Does anyone have an opinion, or experience with pumpkin beers? I'm holding on to the neck of the carboy, ready to tip this stuff into the laundry tub... "
753,Which yeast and hops should I use to learn the distinctive taste of various grains?,"(This title is purposely worded after this question.)  I'm about to begin all-grain brewing soon. I'm excited about all of the options, combinations, and ratios of the different grains, but it is very daunting. I have 8 carboys so I might as well use them to learn the distinctive taste of various grains and combinations of grains.  In order for this tasting experiment to be valid, I would need to use the same yeast and hops across every batch. I figure that it would be best to use a shy or weaker yeast and hops, meaning those that would allow the grain to come through more fully, and to use a yeast/hops that interact well with all combinations of grain.  Which yeast and which hops would fit this criteria?  On the other hand, am I missing key pieces of information here? For example, perhaps there does not exist a single combination of yeast/hops that work with all combinations of grain. This could mislead me into thinking that I do not like the taste of a certain grain, when it was really just the yeast or hops that I chose and their interaction with the grains. "
754,Do I need to continuously measure the temperature of my mash tun?,"From what I understand, the all-grain brewer warms up water to a particular temperature (usually 10-15*F over the strike temperature), adds this warm water to the grains in a mash tun, in an attempt to hit a particular temperature (around 145-160*F depending on the grains/style of beer), and then dumps the wort after an hour. I also understand that it is important to keep the temperature of the mash tun consistent at the desired temperature for this entire time; this is why a cooler is recommended for beginners.  However in a few YouTube videos, I've seen the all-grain brewer feed in a temperature probe into the mash tun and leave the cooler lid slightly ajar to allow for this. To an extract brewer like myself, this looks pretty silly, as the temperature would remain more consistent with the lid fully closed.  Is there a risk that (even in a cooler mash tun) the temperature might drop significantly enough to warrant additional hot water, such that measuring the temperature is more important than closing the lid completely? Or is there something else I am not considering?  At the same time I would LOVE to use my RaspberryPi to record this temperature. I'm thinking about drilling a hole for an airlock and feeding a temperature probe into the airlock (as I do with my carboys) to enable me to record the temperature of the mash tun while having an airtight environment. "
755,May be time for new kettle. Advantages of Stainless Steel?,"I've had the same 10G aluminum BK since I started AG brewing, about 4 years and 70 batches.  I recently left my copper IC in it for a few months and think I may have corroded the aluminum, so it may be replacement time.  I am considering stainless steel, but want to know any advantages it brings for just about double the price of aluminum.  I should mention that I brew in a bag in this vessel (my bag was sewn custom for this kettle).  I also have a step-drill (weldless) installed brewmometer and valve installed in the kettle.    -What are the advantages/disadvantages of SS vs. aluminum? -Will I compromise the stainless coating by using a step drill/pilot hole for the valve and thermometer fittings? "
756,Risks for health from non food grade stainless steel false bottom,My set up is for electric BIAB (brew in a bag) so I use a false bottom.  The problem is that I don't know if the stainless steel I use is food grade or not.  Are there any great risks for my health? Should I replace it or not? 
757,What type of Yeast can withstand high gravity beers?,"I would like to make a higher gravity beer, an Amber specifically. With the yeast (Dry Yeast - Safale S-04) I currently use, I get stuck at about 5.8% ABV (SG 1.074, current gravity 1.030). Do I need yeast starter? Do I need to use a different type of yeast? Are some yeasts better in more alcoholic conditions? "
758,Where is the oil produced from dry hopping?,"This might sound like a weird question, but there I go. From what I read and learnt ""dry hopping adds fragile aromatic oils"".  I wanted to know where do these oils settle in the carboy? On top of the beer? On the bottom? They are kind of mixed everywhere?  To me this seems important to know because if they are on the bottom, this means we better dry hop with a clean bottom!  Thanks. "
759,How screwed am I (sanitation)?,"I just started my first cider homebrew, and broke a cardinal rule. I made the mistake of thinking that BSG B-Brite cleanser was also a sanitizer. I made two batches from pasteurized juice without campden tablets in brand new containers (one 6 gal carboy and one 7.5 gal bucket). I thoroughly washed everything in the B-Brite but used no sanitizer.   Should I expect this to be a wasted batch? Is there anything that I can do before fermentation starts that will help reduce the risk of getting a large batch of vinegar like adding campden tablets before fermentation starts? "
760,How to get started with brewing at home,"I'm wondering if someone could give some guidance on how I could go about starting up my own home brew. I have very little experience with brewing (I've only ever drunk beer), and I'd like to know the ins and outs of doing it at home.  So these are basically my main questions:   What guides/tutorials would best suit a complete beginner? How much do I need to invest in equipment in order to make a decent yield (assuming that's a good thing)? Leading on from the last one, would I start off brewing a small amount? How long does it take to brew a 'typical' home-brew style beer? I've heard that it can be quite dangerous - what do I have to watch out for? And of course any other useful advice to set me off would be greatly appreciated!   I'm also interested in any of your own experiences or interesting stories that others might also find useful. "
761,How hard must I tighten the posts on the keg?,"I purchased two used kegs from NB.   I went to Home Depot with one of the kegs and bought the deep sockets to take the posts off. In the store I was unable to pull either the in or out posts out. I called over an employee, who tried and failed as well. He called over another employee, and they retrieved an extension to the socket wrench to give us more leverage. All three of us were simultaneously trying to get the posts off, but it wouldn't give.  After coming home I spent another 15 minutes on the beer/out posts, and it managed to come lose. I have no idea how I did it or how I could replicate it. Too bad however-- I must have picked up the wrong socket for the gas/in poppet, so I'll need to head back to Home Depot and try this again.  The other keg came lose very quickly.   How hard must I tighten the posts on the keg? I don't want to be in a position where three grown men are unable to open a posts.  Can I just barely tighten it, or should I tighten it as hard as I possibly can?  -- Edit - I meant to say ""post"", not ""poppet"".  -- Edit - I repurchased the correct piece to remove the gas/in poppet and was able to open both kegs easily. I'm not sure what I did this time. "
762,Inconsistencies in fermentables' ppg calculation,"I've been searching around the net, asking in forums, even writing to Weyermann, trying to figure out what is the correct formula -- using a malt spec sheet -- to calculate the ppg value that I can use in recipes.  According to this article:  [website].. I should basically account with moisture content (MC%) and extract fine grind value (DBFG%). However, this gives lower ppg values than is widely referenced for given grains. It feels as if all the other sources do not account for MC%..  For example, I have a spec sheet of Weyermann Pale Ale, where:   Moisture content = 4% max Extract dry substance = 79% min   Using formula:  ppg = 0.46214 * DBFG * (1-MC) * 100  .. I calculate:  0.46214 * 77% * (1 - 4.5%) * 100 = 35.049  However, for the reference, there is an add-on feature in BeerSmith that allows to add custom malts and their Weyermann Pale Malt gives ppg as 38.  1) Does anybody know what is the really correct way to calculate the ppg?  2) I've seen all the malt specs give MC% as ""max"" and DBFG% as ""min"", but how can I know what is the range (maybe DBFG is in range of 79%..82%, which would make a big difference)?  Thanks in advance!  JB "
763,High FG / Low Attenuation across 3 different beers,"I have brewed 3 all-grain batches now that have a high final gravity:     Imperial IPA: Target OG - 1.079, Target FG - 1.011, Actual OG - 1.070,   Actual FG - 1.020, Yeast - US-05. Common attenuation range seems to be 73% - 78%. Apparent Attenuation: 70%      American Pale Wheat Ale: Target OG - 1.064, Target FG - 1.018, Actual OG - 1.054,   Actual FG - 1.022, Yeast - White Labs WLP051. Advertised attenuation range: 75% - 80% Apparent Attenuation: 58%      Belgian IPA: Target OG - 1.060, Target FG - 1.014, Actual OG - 1.061,   Actual FG - 1.027, Yeast - White Labs WLP500. Advertised attenuation range: 70% - 75% . Apparent Attenuation: 54%   I brew with Chicago water which has a high ph (around 8), have done 60 minute mashes at about 152 degrees. Originally I was having trouble hitting my OG, but I figured it out and pretty much nailed it on my third brew. But now after fermenting the third beer for 6 weeks, the FG has been stagnant for the latter 2 weeks at 1.027. I just bottled it and am certainly looking forward to trying it, but the FG was way off (13 points, where the first was 9 and the second was only 4). Every time, I aerated my wort and used a yeast starter. Thus I really doubt yeast health is an issue but of course I could be wrong. The Belgian IPA stopped at week 3 at about 1.030, so I added about 6 oz of corn sugar to try and get it going again. The yeast attacked it once I dropped it in, but the FG didn't come down much further. The temperature for each of these was around 65 degrees +- 3. I brought my Belgian IPA into a warmer room so it could stay at a steady 68 after the third week (also when I added more sugar) and it still didn't come down. I have been doing the mash in my 15 gallon brew kettle. I suspect my wort isn't as fermentable as maybe it should be. But I don't know what I'm doing wrong.  My question(s) is this: Before moving forward with another brew, are there any recommendations anybody has to ensure I can get closer to my FG? Would a high ph affect FG in this way? Should I be using a cooler for the mash instead of my stainless kettle? Should I increase the mash time? I have heard the that optimal ph for mash is 5.2 and that the mash process will reach this ph eventually. Should I start the 60 minutes AFTER I reach a ph of 5.2?  EDIT  There was never a problem with attenuation or FG being off. If anything, my FG readings were below the target. I didn't realize there was a wort correction factor when using refractometers for FG readings. "
764,"Aside from CO2 and N2, are any other gases used to ""carbonate"" beer?","Obviously, most beers are carbonated with carbon dioxide, while some stouts/porters are ""carbonated"" with nitrogen.  I was curious if there has been any notable experimentation with other gasses to ""carbonate"" beer. If nitrogen can introduce a ""creamy"" texture to a beer, I would think that other gasses would also be able to introduce their own characteristics on beer. If any of these experiments have done, what characteristics do these other gases impart?  I'm sure cost would be an issue for certain gasses that would prohibit its use in beer, but for purposes of this question, cost is irrelevant.  As an aside, what is the correct term to use, as opposed to ""carbonate"", for a question of this nature? "
765,Possible failed ferment: re-boil or campden + re-pitch?,"On Saturday I brewed my 89th batch, an all-grain Irish Red Ale, SG 1.049.  Pitched Wyeast 1084 from an ""Activator"" smack pack dated May 2012 that I'd struck around eight hours earlier, then aerated the wort using a paddle-mixer drill attachment for two minutes.  None of these are new procedures to me, although I typically smack the pack the night before brewing instead of that morning (or make a starter on a stir-plate).  It's been around 40 hours and there's no sign of fermentation and no drop in gravity.  I will give it another day and a half before I call the fermentation failed and in the meantime will order new yeast from a more reputable source.  I probably won't receive the new yeast until Thursday or Friday, so I'm curious about what the best approach is for potentially sterilizing the wort before re-pitching should it come to that.  I can think of three options:  1) Don't do anything.  Assume the wort is still essentially sterile after one week in the fermenter, pitch the new yeast and aerate again.  2) Pasteurize the wort by bringing it up to around 180 degrees F, chill, pitch, aerate.  3) Add Campden tablets at some appropriate rate, let the wort sit for 24 (?) hours for the sulfites to evaporate, pitch and aerate.  Thoughts? "
766,How do I set up a Sestos D1S temperature controller?,"I am trying to set up an Sestos D1S temperature controller. Initially, just to see if it works at all, I am trying to use it to control the temperature of my kettle. I've wired it all up correctly so that it can switch the kettle on and off, and the temperature probe is in the kettle. The temperature reading on the front is correct, but the device seems to be impossible to set up.  I have tried autotuning, manual tuning, and simple manual mode. None of thes has worked properly. The only thing which does work is On/Off mode, although it seems to only switch off about 2 seconds after the temperature has gone past the set point.    How do I set up the time period? Since the kettle heats up very quickly, the time period should be very short, and preferably the duty cycle kept low. Se I set the Ctl (Control Period) to 1, for 1 second. I assumed that I would see the output switching on and off at 1Hz, but I do not. I also set the oPH to 50, meaning that it should have a maximum 50% duty cycle. However, the output stays on for many seconds.  How do I set the PID valued? According to the manual:  M50 = Integral P = Differential t = Hysteresis Time  Can this really be correct? Where is the Proportional setting?  How do I get it to auto tune? I followed the manual and managed to make it flash 'At', which I think means it's Autotuning. However, the temperature fluctuated wildly, and finally settled, oscillating between 53ºC and 60ºC, even though the set point was 50ºC.    Added: I am using the following settings  dF   0.3    (Hysteresis) Ctrl   3    (PID mode) M50    0    (Integral) P   1000    (Proportional?) t      0    (Derivative?) Ctl    1    (Control Period: 1 second) oP1    0    (Output method: Time Duty) oPL    0    (Output minimum: 0%) oPH   50    (Output minimum: 50%) run    1    (Automatic)     Added:  With Ctl at 3 (3 second period) and the output duty at 50% (display reads A 50) I an see that the output comes on for 35 seconds, then goes off for 35 seconds. This is a period of 70 seconds.  With Ctl at 0 (0.5 second period according to the instuctions) the period is still 70 seconds.   So it looks like the control period is stuck at 70 seconds. Flicking through the settings, none of the numbers are set to 70 (or 35 or 140). So I don't think there's another setting which is controlling the period.    Added:  Ctl  Period 40  = 40s 20  = 20s 10  = 10s  8  =  8s  6  =  8s  4  =  8s  3  =  8s  2  = 70s  1  = 70s  0  = 70s     Added:  I set P=2, I=0, D=0, Max output = 50%, and set the setpoint to 70ºC. I watched the output duty as the temperature rose slowly to 69ºC. At that point, the output duty slowly began to fall, until at 70ºC it was still at 42%. It finally settled at 79.4ºC with an output duty of 4%.  This really sounds like a fault in the control. "
767,Wine max secondary fermentation time,"I started my first batch of wine a year ago, and got up to racking into secondary fermentation, but never bottled it, and then forgot about it. Is it a lost batch? Is it even safe to try? "
768,Are there sulfites in homebrew?,"My friend, who has a severe sulfite allergy, wanted to try some of my beer. I had to refuse  because I wasn't 100% sure that there weren't sulfites in it.   How are sulfites introduced to beer? I was under the impression that they are usually added as a separate preservative compound. What preservatives (that could reasonably be used in homebrewing) might contain sulfites?  Is there any chance that other ingredients used (in a simple all-grain, minimal- or no-flavoring brew) could introduce sulfites into a beer?  Cheers! "
769,How to keep sugar from fermentation and carbonization?,We want to made sweet low ABV cider. How to do that?  I understand that yeasts are dying somewhere between 10 and 15% ABV but we want our cider to be between 2 and 5% ABV. We can interrupt fermentation and bottle it when the desired ABV is achieved but how to convince yeasts to produce just right amount of bubbles and die afterwards? 
770,How to proceed when step-feeding a mead,"I am in the process of planning my next mead batch, and I wondered if it would be a good idea to step-feed this one since I am planning a high ABV (18%). How would I do this best?   My recipe looks like this for now:    3 US gal total target volume 5.3 kg honney (amounts to about 3.7 litres) Kitzinger Portwine yeast (max ABV of 18%) Some yeast nutrients and salts   For now my basic idea is to start with about 7.5 litres of water and 2 kg of honey and a third of the nutrients. When the SG has dropped by about a third (should be around 1.044 SG) I'll add another 2 kg and wait for the SG to drop to 1.044 again, then add the rest and let it ferment out.   Is this the best way to do this, or is there something I missed in my research? "
771,What are the quickest styles from grain to glass,"I know typically, hefeweizens and wits are best drunk while 'young', but what are the styles that are most conducive to a quick turnaround?  I also know alcohol content is a factor.  Have people had success with milds, O bitters, cream ales, and what are the timetables?  The reason I ask is most of my brews (including some of the 'best while young' styles) have seemed to improve with age.   "
772,Recommendations for a beer style w/ Cherry Extract,"This summer I bought some fresh tart cherry extract from the area I grew up in Northern Michigan, and I've been excited to use it in a recipe.  Any recommendations on what style would be good with some subtle cherry notes?  I'm leaning toward something like a Cherry Vanilla Porter.  Would an IPA work, or would the hops and cherry work against each other?  Thanks in advance.  EDIT: I want something quaffable and delicious. What could I use for the grain bill to get somewhere in the amber range, but not go overboard with the nut or chocolate flavors? "
773,Fruit flies in kegerator faucets,"My kegerator is stored in the garage, and lately fruit flies have been flying into the open ends of the faucet to drink the beer (and subsequently die).  Hence, I've been getting a fly with every glass.  While some might appreciate the additional protein, I'd like to get rid of them.  Has anyone else had this problem?  How did you deal with it? "
774,Oxidation during long primary,"So obviously I'm reading all o the advice floating around to skip racking to secondary. And it makes perfect sense.  But if I primary a 5 gal batch in a 6.5 gal bucket, does the headspace/surface area become a concern after fermentation slows? Are you guys that are doing long primary's using buckets or 5 gal carboys with blowoff tubes? Will I be ok leaving a beer in primary ( in a 6.5 gal bucket ) for 2-3 weeks while the yeast finishes cleaning up? My assumption, because I haven't seen this addressed anywhere is that there's nothin to worry about. However it does beg the question then;  why is headspace/ surface area an issue in secondary but not in primary? Hope this question makes sense, I'm typing On my phone while waiting for a haircut:) "
775,How does efficiency change when adding grains that are normally steeped to a mash?,"Imagine this scenario: you have a an extract recipe that contains a pound of steeped caramel malt. According to [website]Now imagine I change the recipe, and use pale malt as a base instead of the extract turning it into an all-grain recipe. I assume at this point I would throw the caramel malt in with the mash, which has an average efficiency of something like 75%. Does that mean I take 75% of the pale malt GU and 30% of the caramel, or 75% of both?  In other words - does the act of mashing rather than steeping a caramel malt cause the efficiency to change, and if so to what degree? I am looking for a way to calculate the estimated original gravity while taking efficiency into account. "
776,How can I tell there is mold in my bottles?,I just got my kit and am about to brew for the first time.   I was warned to not use bottles that have sat out uncleaned because there can be mold in them.    How can I tell if there is mold in my bottles?  Can I safely clean and remove the mold? 
777,"Lowering to Lagering Temp, how will the beer taste different after lagering","First lager (Oktoberfest, Wyeast 2206), just took a sample after 3 weeks in the primary, and it tasted great (my friend said he picked up some candylike sweetness (diacetyl), but it could be because I asked him if it tasted like butterscotch, and it was front of mind, as I didn't detect any)  I'm going to actually take a gravity reading tonight (I was so excited to taste it last night that I forgot to pull enough to measure) and do the forced diacetyl test.    My question is, what is the purpose of lowering the temp to lagering temp SO.  DARNED.  SLOWLY?  I've read that is should be 1 degree per day, which means this won't get to lagering temperature for 22 days, then another 4-5 weeks lagering!    I know patience is key, you can't rush lagers, etc. etc. etc., but if its going to use up my only fermentation fridge for 12 weeks grain to glass, lagers seem pretty impractical.    What would be the harm if I lowered 5 degrees per day until it got to 35 degrees F?  Also, if I do say so, this tastes really really good right now.  Very clean maltiness (Jamil's Oktoberfest/Marz) Maybe this should be a separate question, but what flavor compounds does lagering cause to precipitate?  I feel like I could almost carbonate and drink this right now (don't worry, I won't)  Thanks in advance! "
778,Wyeast Activator Swelling Expiration time,"I intended on brewing tonight so I broke the activator on my Wyeast 1450 last night. Only today did I realize I'm missing a fermenting bucket to actually ferment with (d'oh, big mistake!), so I'll have to wait until tomorrow when the local homebrew shop opens to pick up another.   The Wyeast pack is completely swelled and I'm worried that my yeast will begin to die off before it's even grown. Will it still be good tomorrow? How long between activating the Wyeast pack do I have to use it? "
779,Lead in primary fermentation,"So, my floating thermometer broke while cooling off my wort and I didn't realize it until about an hour after I had pitched the yeast and fermentation had definitely already started.  At first I freaked out and thought I might have leaked mercury into my wort and almost threw out the batch, but then I figured out that the thermometer was lead. Alcohol based thermometers apparently have little lead beads at the bottom so the thermometer will float.   I was wary to go back into the fermenting wort and scoop out the lead pellets during fermentation so I've been letting it ferment for 5 days now. Fermentation has been strong (and it's still going) and there are no signs of any ill-effect yet. If anything fermentation seems a little more vigorous than usual.  That said, I'm not very interested in poisoning myself with lead when I drink this. When I rack this batch to secondary I'll be able to remove the lead pellets, but will that be enough? Is the alcohol enough to kill off any bad bacterias? Any other precautions I should take? "
780,Could non-alkalized cocoa powder cause astringency in a chocolate stout?,"I made a chocolate stout a while back that's kind of astrigent. I'm not sure I would call it sour, but it makes you pucker a bit. It had 8 oz of Trader Joe's Tumaco cocoa powder added in primary, no secondary. I've read that alkalized or Dutch processed cocoa powder reduces the acidity and astrigency, so I think it was the cocoa powder that caused it. The base recipe was the partial mash oatmeal stout from Brewing Classic Styles. No lactose involved because I have lactose intolerant and allergic friends &amp; family.  Has anyone else had a similar experience? Do you think non-alkalized powder could be the culprit? Would that make Dutch processed better for adding to beer? "
781,Fermenter Headspace; Suitable (and cheap!) Containers for Split Batches,"After Denny's article in the spring issue of Zymurgy, I'm anxious to experiment and split batches for experimentation with yeast pitching rates, strains, fermentation temps, and adjuncts.    I had previously done this by doing a high-gravity mash, spitting the wort into two batches, diluting to session levels pre-boil, then changing hop additions.    What are some good containers to use for 1 gallon mini-batches?  I have one one-gallon glass jug (likely from a nasty jug wine or something) that I used to use for starters.  I also have about 3 extra 5-gallon carboys that I picked up when I thought I would do a lot of bulk aging.    Two questions: 1.)  Is extra headspace in a fermenter bad?  I could theoretically just use these 5-gallon carboys if not 2.)  What are some other suitable containers that people have had luck with in finding inexpensively and readily available small fermentation vessels? "
782,How quickly do i need to drink my beer?,"I've somehow managed to brew a bloody lovely bitter (for my first time) in a pressurised keg but now i've started drinking it, is there any kind of best before? Or do I literally need to drink 10 pints a day over the next 4 days? (not such a bad thing I guess) "
783,Bottling/Corking,"Here is the run down: I have a 6 gallon batch of pinot grigio that I have fermenting and a 6 gallon batch of summer saison that is also nearing completion.  I am looking to upgrade my bottling process for beer and I also need to buy a corker for my wine.  Does anyone have any thoughts on what corker/capper to buy? Is going with a dual purpose topper a good idea? Any input would be GREATLY appreciated, much of the amazon toppers don't have many reviews, aside from the handheld cappers "
784,What are the possible consequences of putting dry yeast straight into the wort?,"I always put my dry yeast directly into the wort, even though the packaging says to rehydrate it first.  I've never had (noticed?) any problems with fermentation.  What could this habit cause to go wrong with the yeast, that rehydrating would prevent? "
785,What is the largest percentage of grain bill for steeping?,"I've recently moved from extract-only to extract + steeping grains.  I'm making a recipe now and wondering if there is a max limit for steeping grains as part of the total grain bill?  For a double witbier, right now I have this profile for my total fermentables (steeping = 30%, non-malt sugar = 30%, malt extract = 40%):   2lb CaraPils (20%) 1lb 2Row (10%) 4lb Extra light DME (40%) 1lb Candi Sugar (10%) 2lb Honey (20%) Does anyone have any insight on this?  Is 30% too much to rely on steeping?  "
786,Reusing vs using new yeast,   Possible Duplicate:   How many times can yeast be reused?       I have read in a couple of places that you should only reuse yeast a couple of times - most say up to 5 times because you would get an infection eventually.   I now wonder if there is any indication for when to throw away the old yeast and get a new vial. I am obviously trying not to reuse until I get a batch that I need to throw away...  Would it be possible to detect this kind defect already in the starter maybe? 
787,How much does gravity typically drop after high krausen,"I have two fermenters going with about a cup of slurry of S-04.  Pitched Sunday morning at 61 degrees ambient, they were showing activity within 5 hours, vigorous activity within 12 hours.  Went to harvest yeast yesterday, and the krausen had already dropped!  I increase the chamber temp controller to 64 degrees, and decided to take a hydrometer sample, and it was about 1.029, down from 1.062.    I know airlock activity doesn't necessarily mean fermentation activity, patience is key, etc., however for the benefit of others, is there a rule of thumb for percentage of fermentation that occurs after the krausen has subsided?  Could it be that this just premanturely flocculated on me?  I have heard that S-04 can do this at lower temps.   "
788,Should the starter volume be included in the overall batch size?,"I'm giving my first starter a go: a 2.4L starter for a 21L batch overall.  Since this looks like it will account for over 11% of the total volume, should I recalc for a 23L / 19L batch?  Or should I keep the recipe for a 21L batch but only add total 19L before the starter?  The gravity will likely be quite different.  I haven't measured the starter but assume it'll be around 1.040.  The starter is made from straight LDME &amp; the beer is a Saison, targeting about 1.071 OG.  Are there any other ""tricks"" for using a large starter in a relatively small batch? "
789,How to clean the CO2 line?,"I had a tiny bit of backflow when I put the gasline back on the keg after force carbonation. It just flowed a tiny bit into the connector - nothing got inside the line itself.  I read Backflow into gas line, but it just tells me about the regulator.  What would be the prefered way of cleaning the line? The connector is giving me trouble, since I want to use my Beerline cleaner, but the connector is closed.  Any good Idea on how to clean the connector (Ball-lock)? "
790,High 'finished' gravity,"I pitched about a cup of decanted starter S-04 slurry into a 1.061 OG American IPA 8 days ago at 65 degrees.  The gravity has been stuck at about 1.028 since pitch day + 48 hours, when the krausen dropped see my other question here...  I have heard a few things since then, such as S-04 isn't meant to have a starter (even though I was trying to split one satchet between two 5 gallon batches), according to ""Yeast"" by White/Zainasheff, you can try to pitch champagne yeast to drop it further, and from some, that the beer is just 'done'.    The only other time I bottled a beer with this high of a finishing gravity I got bottle bombs.  I obviously don't want that, and would like to be able to drink this IPA, as other than this bunk yeast, it is a pretty good beer (80% MO, 10% munich, 10% vienna) with some great hop additions.    Also, my hydrometer is about 2-3 points off, but I calibrated for this in my #'s above.    As it happens, I have another s-04 cake available, as this beers twin finished at about 1.017 (similar original gravity)  Questions- -can a beer finish this high and not have enough residual sugar to blow if bottled? -should I pitch champagne yeast, rack to the other yeast cake, bottle as-is, keg (to hopefully avoid bottle bombs...I have a few serving issues doing it this way though), or let it sit another week? "
791,Use of servomyces in a yeast starter,1 servomyces capsule is the correct dose for 5 galons of wort. If I want to add servomyces to my 1.5 litre yeast starter should i break open the capsule and use only part of it? or is it safe to add the whole capsule?   Is there any risk of osmotic pressure on the yeast if using the whole capsule in the starter? Can you suggest a better product or method for adding nutrient to a starter? 
792,Problems with sealing fermentation tank,"I am new to the world of the craft beer, and new to this community too!  I'm developing my first liters of beer, and so far, I have obtained results that have fascinated me! I think i will never gonna buy another beer! At the moment i am using the American Pale ale recipe.  I guess like many of you, these first elaborations are trial and error, and in the second batch (of 40lts) I had a problem: one of the fermentation tanks does not close properly, therefore the airlock doesnt  work very well, say that no air is in excess, but not sealed.   This can spoil the production of this tank? I have to have a different treatment with the beer of this tank? Will the beer be too rusty ?   Thanks in advance for your help! "
793,Do I need to sanitize my cacao nibs?,"I will be adding half a pound of cacao nibs to my stout here in a few days.  Since the beer will be almost fully fermented at that point is it necessary for me to sanitize the nibs before adding them?  If so, can someone please provide me with some advice on how best to do so? "
794,Making a portion of a batch higher ABV,I am brewing my first kit beer. I want to set aside one gallon and make a high ABV batch. I am brewing a honey wheat and adding jalapeño. How would I make the higher ABV and what would the technical name be? Imperial witbier? 
795,Storing and using leftover DME,"I ended up with about a pound of CBW Sparkling Amber DME leftover.  I figured it might be worth keeping around so I put it in a plastic bag and tried to get as much air out as a could.  Since then I've left it in a box in at roughly room temperature (probably a little lower).  I'm considering adding some or all of it to an upcoming batch but hesitated when I saw that the Briess product information sheet mentioned that ""Storing opened bags is not recommended.""  I'm hoping this may not apply to transferring it to a sealable bag since it seems that moisture and oxidation are the biggest factors for DME going bad, but for all I know I've potentially already over-exposed it.  It will have been stored about a month and would contribute about 5-10% of the sugars depending on the amount I use.  Would this re-packaged DME be worth using in a separate batch?  I'm thinking worst case scenario I could save it to use for a starter or something in the future.  Also, if it is not worth using, is there some other way I could have stored it to help it keep or is saving leftover malt basically just a lost cause? "
796,Do water filters decay at a linear rate for the various chemicals it filters?,"I have a reverse osmosis and deionization unit that is able to filter my 450 PPM TDS tap water down to 0 PPM TDS. It has been about three months, and my TDS reader now gives 3 PPM TDS.  Do water filters decay at a linear rate for the various compounds it filters out?  For example, if my TDS reader read 10 PPM, and I was to analyze a sample of water at Ward Labs which told me that my water contained 2 PPM of Sodium, 1PPM of Chlorine, and 7 PPM of CaCO3, could I safely assume that at 100 PPM TDS, my water would contain 20 PPM Na, 10 PPM Cl, and 70 PPM CaCO3? "
797,Brewing in former lotion pot,"Some relatives recently gave me a 6-gallon aluminum pot that they no longer wanted. The pot was used to make homemade lotion. I've been needing a bigger brew pot, but money has been tight. I'm excited to get one for free!  I've washed the pot many time and also boiled water in it with various combinations of cheap dish soap, vinegar, and a pinch of salt. (This was how I was advised to clean it.)  I'm not concerned about metallic tastes in the wort, but I'm unsure what impact the lotion will have on it. Do you guys think this pot will be OK for brewing? Or cooking in general? "
798,Question about the diacetyl rest process,"When producing beers that must have a ""clean"" / ""neutral"" flavor like lagers, usually the fermenting temperature is low to prevent off-flavors to show. But then, is recomended to apply a diacetyl rest in order to reduce the buttery, butterscotch-like flavor to beer that the diacetyl provide. Here's the part I don't understand. You do a lager fermentation at lower temperatures to prevent off-flavors, but to do a diacetyl rest you raise the temperature from  about 50° to 55° F to 65° to 68° F. What's the explanation for that? Isn't raising the temperature causes the yeast to produce undesired flavors to the beer? I don't get it! "
799,Brewing aboard a boat,"Are their any sailors here who also Brew beer and wine? That's not really the question though. My question is, under the conditions of a sea going vessel, is it possible to brew beer and wine and what extra steps need to be taken to make it successful? "
800,Water cooler as wort chiller,"Has anyone tried using a classic water cooler (images provided below) as wort chiller? Besides being extra careful with sanitary issues, what could be other problems faced? Thanks!  [website]"
801,Is delayed yeast activity normal?,"I am working on a small batch, 1 gallon of Pale Ale. It came in a kit and the yeast was not labeled so I am not sure what kind it is. This is only the third batch I have brewed. On my first two batches I saw a lot of activity by the second day and things died down by day seven, I racked to secondary (these were 5 gallon batches) on the 7th or 8th day.   What I am unsure how to handle is, on the 7th day there is more activity than there has been all week. Seems obvious that I should not interrupt the process, but being new I wanted to ask.    Is this normal? Since this is a one gallon batch should I just keep it in primary for 3 weeks and not worry about secondary?   The OG was 1.06 (if that helps)  Thanks. "
802,Chill the wort faster by applying convection (by putting it inside a laundry machine)?,"There are some new gadgets that allow to chill the beer as fast as 2 min. It's not rocket science, just a more efficient way to increase heat transfer by rotating the desired object (link below provides more details). So i was thinking about using this same principle by putting ice inside a laundry machine and then putting the wort inside a closed container. This would chill the wort very fast and there's the bonus of a massive aeration. Have anyone tried something similar? The more experienced brewers could point out some possible flaws in this approach? Thanks!  [website]"
803,First homebrewing equipment question,"I'm looking at a homebrewer's equipment that is getting out of the hobby and I'm getting into the hobby.  I'm wanting to spend my money wisely and while jumping right into all-grain brewing.  Here is a list of the equipment for sale for $300   10 gallon mash tun (spigot and supply hose screen works great. Never had a problem with grain in wort)   5 gallon ball lock (2 years old with dual regulator and picnic tap)  Two PET plastic 6 gallon    fermenters (one plastic carboy and one big mouth bubbler) Two    stoppers   Two airlocks  5# co2 tank about half full  Starsan cleaner    Pbw cleaner  Carboy brush  Siphon tube  Miscellaneous tubing  2 smaller copper immersion chillers with tubing   I'm not wanting the PET fermenters, the Mash tun is a diy project with scratches and discoloration in the inside, the wort chillers are diy projects as well.  What price do used keg systems from individuals normally run? and How good is it to invest in diy and used fermenting equipment?    "
804,Using 5 gallon kegs for 3 gallon batches,What are the pros and cons for using a 5 gallon keg for 3 gallon batches of beer? Am I wasting a lot of Co2? 
805,How to add sweetness to Stout beer?,"One of the most famous stout is Guinness (a dry stout to be more precise). I personally don't like much this dry / 'salty' type of stout. I like the sweeter ones, like you were almost drinking a cup of hot chocolate. So, how to bypass the toasty / dryness that the black malts normally provide? Even further, how to add  sweetness to it? Thanks! "
806,Wine Quality Sensor,"I am an engineer who's built a wine quality detector. My sensor can pick up a wide variety of chemicals at levels as low as parts per million (ppm).   With no background in wine production myself, I have a few questions regarding how winemakers perform quality control at their facilities.   These questions are:    Do commercial winemakers care about uniformity and consistency in their wine?  After grapes are harvested, what methods can winemakers employ to alter the taste of their wine? For example, if a the grapes from a particular harvest is too sweet, is there anything the winemaker can do to change this?  I understand that there are inherent variations associated with harvests from different years (hence the year of the wine actually matters). Do winemakers strive to achieve a certain level of consistency across different years?  Besides ethanol, do winemakers quantify other chemicals present in wine? The list of chemicals that we can detect are:       Sugar: Glucose, Sucrose and Fructose        Acid: Acetic Acid, Citric, Isocitric, Lactic, Tartaric and Malic       Impurities: Volatile Phenols, Geosmin, Haloanisoles, Methoxypyranzines       Others: Catechin, Epicatechin, Gallocatechin gallate, Myricetin, Resveratrol, Quercetin, Syringic acid, Hydroxybenzaldehyde, p-Vanillin   Are there other chemicals that you would like to test? "
807,How coarse should I grind the malt?,I and my soon to be wife have just started brewing on our own and at the moment we are using a local provider for our malt. The malt comes ground in a plastic bag and is relatively fresh but a bit unevenly ground. In the bottom of the bag there is quite a lot of malt that is almost in flour form. I have been unsure whether or not to add this flour to the brew as it tends to go through our filter and some times get stuck in our equipment.   I'm afraid it might burn at the bottom of our cooking pot if we include to much of it but I don't want to lose to much of the sugar. It has not burned yet as I have usually separated it out and put it at the top of the brew after adding water to make sure it does not fall out of the filter. This process is how ever quite tedious and I am considering whether it is necessary or not.  So to the questions! How coarse should the malt bee before malting?   I imagine differently ground malt affect the end taste and the brewing process. What are your experiences in this area?   I want as much info ass possible! Thank you for your answers. 
808,"My first yeast starter with a stir plate, possibly a disaster","This morning I smacked my first smack pack, and about 10 times, each time a little harder because deep depression would set in if the goodies spewed across the room. I finally got it, or so I thought. Fizzing away on the inside, it started to swell a bit about after an hour or so, and then 6 hours later, I sanitized my stuff, dumped it into my flask, all that good stuff... and it's doing its thing on the stir plate. It didn't swell up a lot at all, but also read about many people not bothering to even wait when they're using a stir plate.   So it's a 1L starter, that of which I'm going to chill in the fridge tomorrow, throw out the spent wort, and add some more to step it up.  Here's why I'm worried:  Out of curiosity, I tore open the packet to see the little stubborn pack inside that wouldn't bust very easy, and to my surprise, it's actually a double pack?! One half broke, whereas the other did not! It's a rectangular shaped pack, with two sides, each separate from each other. Is this some type of mixture? Or just double the amount for a higher gravity (which is what I'm trying to make)  So what I'm planning to do, unless someone can instruct me otherwise, is to throw in the contents of the second part of that pack tomorrow, when I step up the starter.   Please advise, and thank you... Loving this. Hope the non-swelling, and extra packet thing isn't going to ruin my starter.  Also, that little packet sat out at room temp all day while waiting for the pack to swell, but I put the little half of pouch that didn't bust in the fridge.  "
809,Temperature probe placement,"I just built a fermentation chamber and bought a brew belt and a cheap thermostat on ebay to try to control the fermentation temperature.   My main concern is, where do I place the probe in order to get a reliable measurement of the wort temperature? I don't trust placing the probe directly into the fermenter, so I thought taping it to one side. Is it fine or there are clever and more reliable solutions?  Thank you for the help. "
810,does adding water to wort to top off for fermentation raise the original gravity?,"My extract/partial grain kit calls for a OG of 1.057 - 1.061. After topping off in the fermentor, my OG was 1.074. Is this close enough? Did the addition of water raise the OG? "
811,What exactly happens during lagering?,"I've just made my first lager, it is currently lagering at 1 C. What is happening to my beer at this temperature? Is the yeast still active? And most importantly: What is happening at this temperature that would not at higher temperatures?  "
812,Under pitched lager?,"I brewed an American lager, Jamil's ""what most folks call beer"" on Saturday 1/9.  My Gravity was on target at 1.046 and I added a smack pack of Wyeast Pilsen Lager.  I added it to 68 degree wort and then placed in fridge to ferment at 50 degrees.  I am seeing very little action from the airlock, not sure how much I should see as this is my first lager.  My volume in fermenter is about 6 gallons.  I will take a gravity reading on 1/13.  If the gravity has not dropped much, would you recommend waiting a week and taking another reading, that would be 10 days into fermentation?  Pitching an additional smack pack now because I did not pitch enough to start?  Thanks for the help. "
813,Is my beer carbonating while in primary fermentation?,"I started my first small batch 1 gal IPA. After I pitched my yeast I had some blow off (as was expected) but it only lasted about a day, then I attached my airlock.  A week into into the brew it was barely bubbling and continued until 2 days before I was going to bottle. Now it is cloudy and bubbling very rapidly but has no foam on top of the surface. Is it possible that I have messed up somewhere along the line and it has started to carbonate?  If it is a temperature problem and it is now just reaching the right temp, how long should I leave it before harm is done? Or is it too late? "
814,Fermentation temperature for an IPA,I haven't found a global agreement on these topics. Let's suppose that the yeast is American (such as Safale US-05). Then:   Which is the ideal (primary) fermentation temperature for an IPA and why? Which is the ideal temperature for an IPA placed in secondary with dry hopping and why?  
815,Kombucha fermentation time(s),"I'm getting all sorts of feedback as for the fermentation times when brewing kombucha from internet blogs, friends brewing at home,...  I believe different fermentation times will give the kombucha different properties. What is your experience with this? How many days for primary fermentation with Scoby? How many days for secondary fermentation without Scoby and with herbs for instance? What is the absolute minimum and the absolute maximum time of fermentation? "
816,Dry hopping in the keg using a dry hopper,I've never dry hopped in a corny keg before.  I purchased a dry hopper with a 300 micron screen. 1.  How do you tie the dry hopper so it floats?  I've heard satin dental floss works well? 2.  After I rack and add the dry hops I'm assuming I pressurize the keg.  How much pressure do I add?   
817,What parts do I need to connect a CO2 bulb to a normal regulator,"I have a portable keg system that a dip tube assembly that has a gas in post, that can take a CO2 feed from a standard regulator.  These units often come with these tiny regulators that accept CO2 bulbs, but they are rubbish at maintaining a useful dispense pressure.  So if I have a normal regulator how would I connect one of those CO2 bulbs to it? Any parts I should get? "
818,Leave out the sugar in a Belgian tripel?,"It seems like the only reason to add plain sugar is to boost ABV without changing flavor. If I want a lighter beer, can I just leave out the sugar? Or will that affect the flavor?  I'm not talking about dark candi syrups or raw sugar like turbinado. I know they contribute unique flavors.  Thanks! "
819,Elderberry wine making: Is wine entering the bubbler airlock usual?,"I'm having my first go at home brewing by making elderberry wine. So far so good.  I've just put the wine in a demijohn for the anaerobic stage of the process. Based on what I read I've filled the demijohn so there is no gap between the liquid and the bung. I'm using a bubbler airlock. the wine has been in there for a few hours and wine has been pushed into the base stem of the bubbler and the water has been pushed into one side of the bubbler even though I initially set it up with both sides half full.   From all the videos I've watched this doesn't seem right. Though I thought I'd ask and see if the best thing to do is just leave the bubbler as it is with the wine in the bottom of the stalk. Or take the bung and bubbler out, sanitize them, drain a tiny bit of wine from the neck to create a small gap between the bung and the liquid and then replace the bubbler. Which is the correct approach?   thanks for reading? "
820,Fermenting sugary tea into an alcoholic beverage?,"I was drinking some caramelized cranberry tea today (that is, cranberry-flavored tea sweetened with caramelized sugar, or maltose, or malt sugar, whatever you wanna call it). It tasted very sweet, and something came to my mind...  ... why not add some yeast to turn it into an alcoholic beverage? Is that even possible? And how would the result taste? Is this a good idea to begin with?  Would the tea - whether it's from authentic stuff, or a cheap teabag - provide a good environment for the yeast to turn the sugar into alcohol?   Just for the record, disregard the first paragraph of my question when answering my question, I just wanted to tell about what was I doing when the idea just flew into my head.  I am not talking about kombucha. I am talking about fermenting sugar-sweetened tea into an alcoholic beverage, if that is even possible, or viable to begin with. "
821,How to test mash for ion concentrations,"I'm wondering if it's possible to test the mash during mash for an all grain batch to determine concentrations of calcium, magnesium, etc. Or if that is better determined by pre-mash calculations.   What do commercial breweries use? Does anyone know of an off the shelf test?   "
822,How to know *when* to rack off gross lees?,"I'm learning there are ""gross"" lees or the first big batch of sediment and then there are ""fine"" lees or the subsequent smaller amounts of sediment.    ""Gross"" lees can contribute to ""gross"" flavors, but ""fine"" lees can contribute to damn ""fine"" ones :).  After I press, how long should I wait for the gross stuff to settle out?  How do I know when to make the cut between what is good and what is bad for this red? "
823,Fruit puree suspended in beer,"I brewed a saison which I racked onto secondary together with apricot puree. One week down the line I did a measurement and noticed the fruit puree is suspended in the beer. I think I'll wait for another week to dry hop and then another one before bottling.   I was just wondering, will the puree settle down? If not what are my options to keep these bits and pieces out of my beer? "
824,Forgot to add sugar,"I am making wine from black homburg grapes and the primary fermentation has completed (10days). I didn't have a hydrometer at the start, but have transferred the juice from the must to 2 1/2 demijohns and noticed there is no more fermentation, so I then found the sg was about 994 and realised I should have added sugar at the start of primary. How can I calculate how much sugar to add at this stage? Should I go back to primary fermentation in an open container with loose cover or keep it in the demijohns?

825,I have Youngs Elderberry kit,"I am on day 3 and instructions state ""top up 4.54 litres tepid water"". Does this mean top up TO 4.54 litres? Should I leave space in the demijohn and how much space? It's still got 7 to 20 days to ferment yet! Terrible instructions as very vague and badly worded.  Thanks   JY Newbie!    I did that and it bubbled up into the airlock! I had to take some liquid out again!  Maybe I've just got a lively must going!  I've topped it up again now and it's still quite lively!  Thanks for the advice! "
826,When exactly is 'first' punchdown?,"I'm reading the opti-red directions and it says to add at ""first punchdown"".  Does that mean right after I add my yeast, 24hours after crushing and sulfating?  Or does that mean 24 hours after adding the yeast?  If I'm cold-soaking, should I add opti-red at the start of that process? "
827,Brew Flooring Systems,I had a few friends use Brewfloors.com flooring systems and they were pretty happy with the results. I'm considering Brewfloors or something else. Do you have other recommendations? If so why?   Thanks guys- Cheers  
828,Continuously punching down the cap?,"I see some references say to punch down the cap twice per day, some three or four, some variable throughout the primary fermentation.  Is there a limit to how often I should punch down?  Something negative that bounds how often to punch?  What if a machine theoretically continuously punched down the cap? "
829,Is this an okay recipe?,"This is my first time brewing my own beer. I plan on making a pale ale using 2x Coopers Light Malt Extract in 5 gallons of water. I've recently bought 100g of each of the following hops (and plan to use only say, 2 of them to learn the proper brewing process and of course, save money):   Magnum (11% AA) Cascade (5.5% AA) Simcoe (13% AA) Chinook (13% AA)   For my first batch, I was thinking @60 - add 50g of Magnum (because it's high in Alpha Acids, so this will make the beer quite bitter) and @12 30g of Cascade (which will add a slight grapefruit-like aroma to the beer).   My questions are:    What do you think about the amount of hops I'm using? I know it comes to personal taste, but I have absolutely no experience - so your own thoughts would be very valuable I haven't bought myself any specialty grains. Do you think this is a problem? At my local homebrewer store, I can buy crystal and weyermann caramel varieties; but I don't know if I should bother if it's not needed for my first brew. Again, your personal thoughts would be very valuable.   Thanks :)  "
830,My pasteurized peach cider smells like wine,"So a while back I bought some pasteurized peach cider from a shop on the side of the road. The ""100% juice with added ingredients"" type of stuff, ya feel me?  I bought an airlock for it because The label says it can ferment and build up pressure so I didn't really want it to explode on my counter and such. Well it's been fermenting for around 3 or 4 months now and I just opened it and the thing smells like wine. I definitely didn't try to put effort into brewing or anything, I was just lazy and never drank it. My question is: is this stuff salvageable? Or should I throw it out before it kills me?   Don't really have any experience with this stuff so any kind of help on what to do with it next would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance! "
831,Will car/motorbike fumes affect beer fermentation?,"I plan on brewing my beer and letting it ferment for 2 or so weeks in my garage. Unfortunately there are a lot of fumes (eg. From the car and motorbike) and I'm worried that the fumes may affect the fermenting beer. Note that there isn't really any ventilation. But I do have a bubbler air-stopper in place.   Does anybody know if this will affect the quality of the beer, or could it be dangerous to ingest? If so, would you happen to know of any portable ventilation system I could buy to prevent this from being a problem?   Any help would be appreciated. Cheers "
832,Splitting my brew day,I am finding it difficult to set aside enough time for a full brew day and have therefore wondered if it is possible for me to split up the process to two separate occasions.  The plan is for the two occasions to be with a week's interval.  My plan is as follows;  Day 1   Heat water 60 min mash Bring wort to boiling (?) Transfer hot wort to carboy   Day 2   Bring wort to boil 60 min boil with hops Cool and ferment   Is it reasonable to do this without getting a contaminated beer? Will I have to bring the wort to boiling during my first day or can I just dunk it into a clean carboy directly? Should I take anything into account in terms of efficiency? 
833,Why is tri-clamp considered sanitary and other connectors not?,I've read that an advantage with tri-clamp connections are sanitary. I get the impression that they say that camlock and QD are not sanitary.  What is it that makes tri-clamp sanitary and camlock isn't? What is the problem with using camlock on? Especially on the cold side? Wouldn't treating it with starsan be enough? 
834,Is it possible to decontaminate wine?,"Is it possible to decontaminate my wine after some (not too clean) objects fell into it?  I was straining my blackberry/elderberry wine through a straining bag. The brew is about a week old at this stage, and I've added only about a third of the required sugar (the rest to be added today after this step).  I had the bag held over the bucket overnight, held to a pair of chairs by some clothes-pegs that I had taken off the clothes line and allowed to drip into the bucket below.  Unfortunately this morning, while I was removing the straining bag, 4 of the pegs popped off the chairs and fell into the bucket!   These pegs were not only not sterilised but a bit old, dusty and the springs on them a bit rusty - they have been outside for a couple of years, spending some time on the ground, etc. Although I then fished them out with a scalded (though that seemed pointless by now!) spatula, it took me about 1-2 minutes to do this and I feel I have ruined the batch.   Is my batch ruined now? Is there anything that can be done to save it? (I don't want to boil it now as I'm afraid it would kill the yeast and boil away the alcohol, not to mention just ruin the taste anyway). Or am I over-reacting and it might be OK? "
835,What does a gravity reading really mean?,"The simple/short version of the question:  What does a hydrometer gravity reading of 1.036 really mean?  Does it mean the density of the liquid is 3.6% greater than that of distilled water (ignoring inaccuracies and errors in measurement)?  The context/long version of the question:  When creating a yeast starter, it is commonly advised to create a light wort in the range of 1.030 to 1.040 gravity by using 100g of dry malt extract (DME) per liter of water in the starter, or a 10-to-1 ratio of water to DME by weight.  According to wikipedia, gravity is ""the ratio of the density of a sample to the density of water"", or equivalently, the ratio of the mass of a given volume of a sample to the mass of an equal volume of pure water.  By my math, 1L of water is ~1000g (with variation depending on temperature), and dissolving 100g of DME into that should result in a gravity of (1000g + 100g)/1000g = 1.100.  This is very, very far off from the 1.030-1.040 range expected by common wisdom.  Thinking this common wisdom was perhaps just a commonly-repeated mistake, I checked the suggestions of 4 online yeast starter calculators, to see how much DME they each suggest should be added to 1 liter of water to achieve 1.036 gravity (apologies for the non-links, apparently I need more reputation to post more than 2):   102.7g according to www.brewersfriend.com/yeast-pitch-rate-and-starter-calculator/ 103g according to www.captainbrew.com/yeast-pitch-rate-and-starter-calculator 98.18g according to www.yeastcalculator.com/yeastcalc.html 98g according to www.brewunited.com/yeast_calculator.php   Aside from rounding differences, there are 2 different values given here, within ~5% of each other, and essentially agreeing with commonly-repeated advice.  In contrast, my straightforward calculation would suggest the value is 36g of DME per liter, barely more than a third of the values from the calculators.  So I checked experimentally (and very roughly) while creating a big starter.  Using a kitchen scale, I took 3.1L of hot tap water (the extra 0.1L is to compensate a bit for boil-off), and added 300g of DME.  I brought it to a rolling boil and held it there for ~5 minutes to sanitize, then used a larger pot to make an ice water bath, and cooled the starter wort to ~68F according to my floating thermometer.  I checked the gravity with my hydrometer, and it read ~1.040.  There's plenty of room for little errors here, but the fact is, I got results pretty much in line with the common advice and the online calculators.  I just don't understand how this can be.  It seems like I should have seen a gravity reading close to 1.100.  But when common wisdom, 4 online calculators using (apparently) at least 2 different equations, and my own experimental results all disagree with my abstract logic, I have to assume my abstract logic is incorrect.  What's wrong with my calculation?  How does adding 100g of DME to 1L of water result in a gravity of ~1.036 instead of ~1.100? "

837,Fermenting in Sealed Keg,"I have heard of people fermenting in corny kegs before. I've also heard of people fermenting under pressure. Finally, I've heard of people fermenting in corny kegs under pressure, using a spunding valve.  What would happen if I just...transferred the beer, oxygenated, and sealed the keg? A corny keg can almost certainly handle the increased pressure. (I carbonate at 30 psi...). Would the pressure be too high? Would the pressure harm the yeast?  I felt almost certain I'd find the answer here already, but I don't see anyone who's already asked it... "
838,Mead: is it time to bottling?,"I have a few questions. I'm making mead for the first time. My mead is now brewing for 2 months (since 11th august), but I'm not sure if it's time to bottle it. That's because it is still sparking. I know that it is the consequence of the brewing, but since the sparkle is not that strong as it was at the beginning, in fact it is very weak.   1- Can I bottle it or I have to wait until the mead is completely still?   2- Also, when I shake it, bubbles of CO2 are still coming up from the airlock. What should I do?    3- And what kind of caps should I use (sugar cap, plastic, metal crown stoppers, ...)?   You can also see from the pic the mead is still turbid, I guess. Thanks for your help!  P.S.: I've used brewer's yeast.! "
839,Advice for a Harry Potter butterbeer,"I'm in the inception phase of a Harry Potter inspired butterbeer recipe. Since it's not well explained in the books, I'm going for a a flavor profile in the range of spiced eggnog and root beer.  I'm looking for a big, creamy head and (if possible) a color like hefeweizen. Spices will be nutmeg, cloves, ginger, cinnamon, and sassafras (also considering vanilla bean?). For malt I'm going for 40L caramel malt for steeping, and 50/50 Maillard Gold and Wheat extracts and some lactose.   Does anyone have have advice on amounts of the spices and lactose to use for a 1 gallon recipe and how to add a butterscotch flavor? I've heard some people talking about butterscotch extract/schnapps. I definitely want that thick head so nothing that will kill it. Finally hops or no? I don't want it to be unbalanced but I feel like hops is the wrong flavor profile. Some other bittering agent instead? "
840,Apparent steriliser residue left on bottles; is this safe?,"A few months ago I bottled using Wilko's Bruclens steriliser: [website]After sterilising I gave the bottles a few rinses with cold water. After bottling I noticed this white film on a number of the bottles: [website]My questions are: 1. Does this mean there is some steriliser left behind in the bottles? 2. What are the consequences if you consume some left-behind steriliser of this type with your beer?  Edit: I can't rule out that the film was caused by an oxi clean product from when I was cleaning the bottles, so it would be nice to know of any risks with that as well.  Thanks! "
841,Starsan in double bubble airlock keeps getting sucked into fermenter - why and how to prevent?,"I did a brew on Saturday and cooled, got in the fermenting bucket and added yeast, added starsan to the chamber in the double bubble airlock and got it under the stairs. Ever since then, the starsan gets sucked into the fermenter, fairly quickly as well (after I replace it). I've heard this is due to temperature change creating a vacuum. I've also heard that that shouldn't happen with this type of airlock. Its not happened before to this extent (i.e. I've never had to replace the starsan).  Any ideas why this is happening? And is there a way I can prevent it? I'm not too concerned right now as the yeast is still working and producing carbon dioxide but when it finishes I still plan to leave it (three weeks in total) so I don't want the possibility of oxygen getting in.

My question is simple: Can I start using Swing-Tops like Grolsch to bottle my beer? I've heard varying reports about skunking my beer with the green glass, or that the seal is imperfect.  Do you think it would be any harder to clean the glass inside these reusable bottles?  I would consider capping my own beer although I'd rather save the expense until I learn a little more about brewing. "

846,Is it HOT enough for ya!,"How do you determine the right temp?  Should everything be brewed @ the same temp or can different temps offer different drinkable results?    My first try at my own recipe was steeped @ 120 degrees for about 15min then brought to a rolling boil for an hour.  I put the hops in at different stages and ended up boiling off about a gallon.  The whole experiment yielded about 4 gal instead of the 5 I was going for. Now my beer tastes ""Worty"" Should I have increased the temp?  Or is it b/c I didn't compensate for the boil off?

848,Wort Chiller Cool Down Times?,What tools or tricks is everyone using to cool their wort down after the boil? How long does it take you to get down below 70 degrees? I am using an older copper wort chiller (hooks up to a garden hose) that a friend of mine made and has worked okay in the past but its getting kind of beat up and losing its nice coil shape so I was thinking of an upgrade. In the Michigan winter I am able to get our wort down below 70 in about 20 minutes and in the summer about 30 minutes. Any advice or tips would be much appreciated.  
849,Smack Pack and Pitching Time,"So I completed my first batch of homebrew this morning, but I forgot one potentially (okay, not potentially, definitely) important aspect of the whole process: the yeast. I didn't forget it, per se, but I forgot that I was supposed to smack the smack pack three hours in advance (per the instructions on the Wyeast Activator package, it says three hours in advance or pitch immediately). Being a beer wunderkind, I split the difference and smacked it 90 minutes before pitch time. It had expanded some before I pitched it, but it wasn't quite full. Should I be concerned? More importantly, if I don't see fermentation activity in the next 24-36 hours, can I just put in more yeast (properly prepared this time)? "
850,First batch tragedies?,"Brewed my very first batch today.  It is a stout and is sitting in my basement as I type.  I would call the day a success--a whole lot more work than I thought.

This is one of those quietly unheard of beer styles.  Anyone? Anyone? Cheers 
854,Whirlpool hop additions,"What is the real difference between a whirlpool hop addition and a flameout hop addition?  The practice of whirlpooling is more of a pro-equipment setup type of technique, but I have seen and heard pro-brewers mentioning both additions in the same breath.  The difference must be within the way they use their equipment.  The main point for confusion to me is that a whirlpool hop addition happens during the whirlpool but before the chill.  Isn't that the same as a flameout addition????  Unless, the whirlpool is happening post chill; then you could see it more as a dryhop (pre-ferment) addition.  But when you think about how the equipment works, a whirlpool tank post chill doesn't seem realistic because post chill you want that wort in the fermentor and with the yeast ASAP.  Anyone have an answer to that conundrum??? "
855,Black Patent and stout,"The debate rages on so I thought I'd ask.  Do you think black patent (black barley) belongs in Stout?  Or is stout better made with just roasted barely and chocolate malts, while BP is best reserved for Porter?  I am of the camp that if it tastes good do what you like. I make a really nice Oatmeal Stout, that uses primarily roasted barley.  But I find that I like just about 2oz of BP in there for and added level of roasted depth. "
856,Dry yeast vs wet yeast,"I've always thought it to be common knowledge that wet yeast is better than dry yeast for home-brewing.  This was confirmed by Sam Calagione at his Authors at Google talk where he suggested that using wet yeast is the single best way for the beginning home-brewer to improve their beer.    Recently a retail home-brew store employee told me that this ""myth"" has been debunked and that dry yeast is better because it doesn't require a starter for high gravity beers.  Is there any truth to this?  Do any serious home-brewers out there prefer dry yeast? "
857,Using champagne yeast,"I would like to make an IPA that is very bubbly and dry like a champagne. I'm assuming to get it really bubbly I would just bottle with champagne yeast, but to achieve the dryness would I also ferment with it?

860,Do pin lock static relief valves need to be replaced after activation?,"If the static relief valve on a pin lock keg has vented pressure (i.e at 130 psi) does the valve cease to work? Does it need to be replaced with a new static relief valve?  Background:  I was watching a video on youtube regarding corny kegs the other day. In the video a statement was made regarding the static relief valves on pin lock corny kegs. Specifically, the statement made was that once a static relief valve has been activated (i.e at 130 psi) it must be replaced. The video did not state what happens if you do not replace it. Perhaps the keg simply does not hold pressure, or worse it no longer automatically vents pressure. Unfortunately I do not remember the link.   Edit: Found the link. [website]"
861,High Gravity/Low Alcohol - How do I get there?,"Everyone seems so interested in getting high alcohol into their beers.  I like to drink and not get wasted, so how about good beer with low alcohol?  Last summer's trip to England was an eye opener.  First night, seven pints. Next morning felt great.  Found out ABV is around 3% to 3.5% in most English pale ales.  But they were creamy, full bodied and very satisfying.  I would like to brew that kind of beer:  Full bodied and low alcohol.  Suggestions? "
862,Can I Bottle Ginger Beer after the bubbles have stopped?,"I'm a ginger beer neophyte, but I love the stuff and can't find it in my area.  I decided to brew and have two, three gallon glass carboys working(?)  In one I used an extract, champagne yeast, sugar and a few bonus ingredients and in the other I made a wort out of ginger root, lemons, limes, gobs of sugar and champagne yeast.  Both sit in my kitchen at about 70* F.  Both started working immediately with the wort batch taking off like a scalded dog.  It bubbled hot and heavy for a solid week then slowed to a stop in just a few hours.  Now it is just sitting there where the extract batch is still bubbling merrily, albeit much more tamely, along.  Is it safe to bottle the non-bubbling batch? and if so, how do I get it to produce fizz in the bottles?  Add more sugar to each? "
863,Yeast overdose?,"So I'm new to the home-brewing scene, and I was a bit too excited to get started with my apple cider. I misread the instructions, and instead of using half a teaspoon for a 2lt bottle of juice.. I used an entire packet :/  Will it taste like satan's piss? Is there any salvation to it? I'm using Lalvin EC-1118 Champagne yeast.  I still have about 1 gallon of juice, and an extra cap/airlock. Should I mix it / dilute it with the rest of the juice.. or just chuck it and make a new round? Or just let it be and it will turn out ok?  Thanks! "
864,Proposed yeast starter,"Within the next few days I'll be 'brewing' 100 litres of ale from slightly concentrated sterile wort. I've used these kits before with decent results, but this time I want to try a liquid yeast instead of the packaged dry (Cooper's) yeast that's included in the box. So I bought a Wyeast 'Direct Pitch' smack pack (British Ale II) that allegedly contains 100 billion cells.  Not enough for this much wort, obviously, so I propose to boil up half a pound of dry malt extract to make a 1/2 gallon starter. When that's rolling nicely I'll use it to pitch this next mega-batch. Good idea? Bad idea? Any reason that wouldn't be satisfactory?  Much of my homebrewing knowledge, if you can call it that, dates back to Neolithic (i.e. pre-Internet) times, so until I can lay my hands on some good recent books on the subject, I thought I'd ask the question here.

865,Bottling from secondary (keg). Wait two weeks and prime or now?,"I'm brewing my 1st kit which my gf got from a local hardware store (ironically there's a home brew store not 5 mins away sigh) but wasn't a cheap one.  [website]Just need a bit of advise as there is a mountain of information out there and it's making my head spin.   WHAT IVE DONE  It's golden ale, 23 liters (5 gallons) came with two large tins with syrupy like mix in.  Iv'e added the yeast and left it at 20 degrees (68f) and it stopped fermenting after only 3 days, which i thought was odd. tested it with hydrometer and got a reading far short of what was required (22ish not close to 10)  the So i added a packet of amylase enzyme to get it going again.  1 week later the fermenting has stopped, tested and carefully transferred to secondary.    After only 24 hrs i pulled some into a glass and it was carbonated with as expected a bitter yeasty taste as it still needs to mature.   WHAT THE QUESTIONS ARE   1) why after such a short time is the beer carbonated with no fermenting when it was flat before transfer to secondary? There are no visual signs of fermenting going on. Might my keg explode? it's good for 15 psi.   2) should i leave it 2 weeks (as suggested by some members and mico brewers) in the keg and then add my 5 ounces of primer and bottle or should i prime and bottle now?  Hope that is clear, thank you.  "

Doing that for this recipe only gives about 3.9 kg for LME (in place of the 2-row).  Reading another post closer to the start of that thread, the creator of the recipe says:     I'm gonna guess you could sub light DME for the pale 2-row and steep   the carapils and Crystal 40. Try running it through Promash and tweak   the DME until you hit 1.074. I'm kind of a noob, so I'd wait for   another opinion.      Another thing, I might need to tweak the hops, so let me get a judges   opinion of it before you make it. I'll post that info soon as I can.      Charlie   Does anybody know if simply throwing the recipe into a calculator (I've been using brewers friend recently) and tweaking the DME until it hits 1.076 is a good idea?

867,Higher alcohol content in a Hard apple cider,I am brewing a hard apple cider and would like to know how can I increase the ABV % in a cider ? or is it the same process in a beer ? 
868,"Missed Expected OG, Sparging Issue?",I brewed my first all grain batch this past weekend and everything went pretty smooth except my OG was 1.050 instead of the 1.056 I was expecting.  Would this be a sparging issue? I had calculated a 75% efficiency. I did fly sparging with a home made sparge arm that worked pretty well. I had to adjust the flow a couple times to maintain a flow that ended in 45 minutes with close to 7 gallons collected for a 5 gallon batch.  I boiled off between 1.25 and 1.5 gallons of wort.  If this isn't a sparge efficiency issue what else could it be? 
869,Immersion/Whirpool chiller design for good trub cone formation,"Considering the best trub cone formation in the wort (settling in the center), what aspects shall we have in mind when designing a serpentine (coil) to chill wort (immersed in it) with whirlpool (re-circulation) like Mr Malty Chiller ?  I think that the solid residues need some space to pass between chiller tubes and space between the bottom of the kettle and the coil to decant in the center.  Is it true ? How many space is needed ? And what about to elevate the coil with 3 rods instead leaving a ring of the own coil tube in the bottom ?   Assuming all samples below with the same tube area, what would be the best design ?  1) Dense with a ring in the bottom     2) Dense with a ring in the bottom but elevated in the middle     3) Sparse with a ring in the bottom     4) Sparse with a ring in the bottom but elevated in the middle    5) Dense elevated by rods    6) Sparse elevated by rods   "
870,Bubbles restart after 1 month?,"i've done 4 batches one month ago, one per day, day after day.  My batches now are of 60L, and I use 2 30L fermenters for each batch. 2 of the 4 batches are the ""same recipe"", so I have 4 fermenters in ""same conditions"".  So, bubbles stopped a long ago, there's no activity on any fermenter, beside 1 of them.   What could be happening to it to restart to bubble? It can be a sign of too much time in primary? Never take so much time in primary, always bottled after 1 or 2 weeks, but reading here make me feel encouraged to spend more time. I live in Brasil, my room temp is sigthly higher than the optimal.  Thanks in advice. "
871,How to adjust my wine?,"I'm looking for some general advice/recommended reading, etc.     I've made a few wine kits and they've all come out OK.  I feel I have the general process down and I'm ready to start with perhaps fresh grape juice.  I've always thought that one advantage I have over commercial wineries is that I can add anything I want to my wine.  If it's not sweet enough, I can add sugar.  Not enough acid, I can add more, etc.  But my problem is, I don't know how to tell from raw juice what might be needed.  I know I can measure the sugar, etc., but since juice tastes so much different, I don't see how to tell what it will be like in six months.   I don't even know if I can recall how a batch of juice tasted six months ago to say, ""yep that needed more oak, or more malic acid.""  How do commercial winemakers do it, other than making dozens of batches?  Or is there no shortcut?  Thanks in advance for your advice. "
872,Buying Yeast Online and Temperature during Transit,"I buy everything from Northern Brewer and it takes UPS 5 days to ship to me (If I'm not home early enough from work on Friday, I have to wait the weekend too).  Next week is going to have three days over 90*F in my town.  NB ships all yeast with an ice pack and state that they guarantee their yeast will arrive fresh.  Even if the yeast gets ""injured"" due to temperatures during shipment, will a yeast starter and proper aeration be all that is necessary to get back to normal? Or, should I wait until next week for them to ship? "
873,Low Pre boil gravity,I have brewed the same recipe 4 times. All 4 brews had 1.028-1.030 pre-boil gravity but today when I finished my mash I had 1.025. Any reasons that happen? And what impact will it have on my beer? 
874,Do I have to bottle/keg an ale?,"I've got an ale (23L) that's been brewing for six days now, my recipe says I should bottle or keg it after eight. I don't have any bottles or a keg, but I do have another bucket (25L, made for brewing in) with a tap. Can I do the secondary fermentation in there and just draw it off with the tap for drinking?  If that's not an option then is it ok to leave it for another couple of days so I can order bottles? What about ghetto ways of bottling (like using plastic water bottles)? "
875,Gluten Free Brewing with Sorghum Extract,"I am working on a Gluten Free clone of Sam Summer for my wife, I took a kit from a home brew store that was close and added some lemon and lime zest, and some grains of paradise.  The kit uses sorghum extract, and this is the first time I have used this in a beer.  I boiled on Saturday April 26th, almost 3 weeks ago, and I am still seeing bubbles in my primary fermenter.  Has anyone brewed with sorghum before?  Is this length of fermentation normal?   "
876,Creating the perfect ginger bug?,"Can anyone suggest the best recipe for making a ginger bug?  I understand that it is just ginger root and unrefined sugar, but is it better to use organic ginger (if so why?), what is the best sugar to use (I understand that some of it comes down to personal taste)? "
877,What effect does conversion have on mash temp,"We're mashing our second batch (after a year of extract) and seems like we cannot keep the mash temp low enough.  We struck at 165F in an attempt to hit 152 for mash (grain was at 65F).  We saw a higher temp at first (~156) so we left the cooler open for a bit until we hit ~150F (lower than we wanted), but after closing the lid, the temp creeped back up to 156 range. so the Q: is, where is the energy coming from?  Is conversion adding that much energy to the mash?  "
878,Citra hops shortage?,"I'm having a devil of a time finding citra hops in quantity. Everywhere I visit seems to carry citra, but none want to sell me more than a couple of ounces and usually at inflated prices. I mean $2.99 an ounce? C'mon!  Does anyone have some information on the degree of shortage we are dealing with here? "
879,Is it better to age a wine in bottles rather than bulk aging?,"My partner and I are brewing a 6-gallon wine batch, and we disagree over when to bottle it. It's been in the carboy for approximately 8 months, and I've read here and on other sites that bulk aging should be kept to a minimum of 1 year. Is this true? Would the result be better to bottle now or in several months? "
880,Difficulty siphoning through counterflow chiller,"Just bought a counterflow chiller... tested it with boiling water and it worked fine. I also siphoned sanitizer through it, no problems there.  However when I tried to siphon the wort, it clogged immediately. Realizing my mistake, I flushed the chiller and then retried, using a grain bag to filter the hops/trub. But it seemed that this still wasn't enough; the siphon simply would not flow.  Can someone advise on what I'm doing wrong? What is the standard practice here?  Some additional info, in case it is useful:     I'm trying to siphon using gravity only My kettle does not have a valve/spigot, I'm just running a silicon line up and over the wall I'm brewing with an extract kit, with hop pellets (to give you an idea of the trub I'm dealing with)  "
881,Cold crashing bottled ale after fermentation,"There are a few topics about this here but nothing that gives info on my particular situation...   I've fermented in primary for 1 1/2 weeks then transferred to secondary. Left the ale in there for another week and have just bottled my ale 2 days ago. The mix was still producing a heavy amount of gas at the time of bottling. The bottles are now in a dark environment at 20 degrees C.   Don't ask why i did it this way. I think i messed up a few things but we'll see on the final result.   When i bottled i added 1/2 teaspoon of priming sugar to each bottle and gently tipped the bottle till the sugar was dissolved. Iv'e got 35 pint bottles in total. They ale porcelain topped glass bottles.   My question is when should i cold crash the cloudy ale? Should i cold crash them in another day or two or can i just leave them bottled and cold crash when i was to drink in 2-6 weeks?   Also the ale was very bitter when i bottled it, could that be a sign of trouble? Or be just because it's still young?  Cheers, Brad  EDIT: I think this is quite good info actually:   Am I required to refrigerate bottles after bottling?  Didn't see it before...  So i should leave the cloudy ale in the bottle for a few weeks then cold crash when i want to drink?  "
882,Thermal expansion of wort,"Does anybody know an algorithm or a calculator to compute thermal expansion of worts?  Most of the time in homebrewing materials, it is said that in volume calculations one should account for 4% expansion of water from 20C to 100C (on standard pressure). More precise expansion can be calculated based on volumetric expansion coefficients.  However, because my volume measurements of wort do not add up (as if some wort is mysteriously vanished), I'm thinking whether the calculation is correct.  Isn't the thermal expansion of sugar solution different than the one for water?  Thanks!  JB "
883,Do I need to completely fill my barrel?,"I am flavoring my first beer in a new, 5 gallon oak barrel. This batch is a full 5 gallon batch, but is it ok to put smaller sizes in it? For example, can I put 2.5 gallons in without any harmful effects? I'm thinking the oak flavors will flavor the beer fairly quickly (i.e., 2 to 5 days), so having more surface exposed to oxygen will not be a huge problem. "
884,Re ferment beer after transferring to keg and force carbonating it,"I brewed a 5 gallon batch of IPA beer, the OG was 1.067 and 2 weeks later it only dropped to 1036. A stuck fermentation I was told after I transferred it from my fast fermenter to two 3 gallon kegs. I forced carbonated both and tried the beer a few days later. Way to sweet for my taste. My question/idea is to use Co2 to prime the fermenter then transfer from the keg to fermenter via Co2,  re pitch champagne yeast and hope to dry it out. Would their be enough oxygen in the beer for the yeast to do it's job? Would adding yeast nutrient to the beer help? Newbie questions I know... Thanks, Mark.  "
885,Suckback and sampling from conical fermenters,"How do people with conical (or other sealed) fermenters avoid sucking liquid from the airlock into the vessel when they take samples or remove trub through the bottom valve?  Do they just remove a plug from the top and let air in to replace the liquid volume that's been lost?  If so, doesn't that cause a contamination/oxidation risk? "
886,Hefeweizen final gravity too high,I started my Hefeweizen with a OG of 1.054 and used Wyeast 3068.  The wort was well aerated but after 3 weeks my gravity is still 1.020 which seems a little high. The gravity reading I took a week ago was also 1.020.  Could this be because liquid yeast has a much lower cell count then dry yeast?  Should I pitch more yeast? 
887,Carboy size 3 or 5 gallon? please,"I've got a 15 litre, 3.9 gallon batch of hard cider (I juiced the apples myself and lost the will to live after 20kg).  Should I get a 3 gallon or 5 gallon carboy?  I read that when moving the cider to a carboy for secondary fermentation I shouldn't leave a pocket of air. Will using a 5 gallon carboy and topping up with a litre of water greatly dilute my cider? Is it best to go for a 3 gallon?   Thanks for you help in advance.  Paul "
888,What is the lab wort pH of Rye Malt,"I am planning a brew where Rye malt is a considerable component of the grist. I am trying to predict my mash pH by taking the weighted lab wort pH contributions of each of my malts, and accounting for residual alkalinity.  I have read that rye malt, like wheat malt has tendency opposite to barley, in that it increases pH. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to find a malt analysis or other reliable information that would give even an estimate of lab wort pH for rye malt. Does anyone happen to know this value (even roughly?) or have a resource that might be useful? The supplier of the rye malt in this case is Canada Malting. "
889,Effect of adding bacteria when racking to secondary,"I recently brewed a Flanders red ale and it is nearing the end of primary fermentation. I'm planning to rack it to a carboy and leave it for up to about a year.  While doing research on the style, I saw various recipes that added everything (yeast and bacteria) to primary and others that used just the yeast for primary and added the bacteria (and Brettanomyces) when racking to secondary. I decided to do the latter for various reasons but I want to clarify that my thinking was on the right track.  My thinking was that if I had added the bacteria to primary, there would have been a lot of additional compounds created as they consumed sugars, competing with the yeast. Many of these may be cleaned up during the long fermentation but I imagine the beer would still end up with some signs of that process, and I'm not sure I wanted that.  By adding it to secondary, I'm assuming that the beer will come out a bit cleaner but still develop a good amount of sourness (probably a little less but hopefully not much less).  Am I on track here? Is there anything I'm missing? Overall, what are key differences I'll see between adding the bacteria in secondary instead of primary? "
890,What happens to remaining sugar when wine is converted to vinegar?,"Say that I have a wine that still contains a substantial amount of sugar. If I start the process of converting the wine to vinegar by exposing it to oxygen, will the sugar continue to be converted to alcohol during this process? Or will the sugar remain even as the wine is converted to vinegar? "
891,Best replacement for WLP545,"Question: what is the best alternative to use instead of White labs yeast WLP545, in order to get the most similar result? Or is there any commercial produced beer using WLP545 that you can grew a culture from?  Background: We have a Belgian style IPA fermentera with WLP545 that we want to bring to a homebrewing competition, we need to brew it in the next couple of weeks but for some reason White Labs have paused their production of WLP545. "
892,Hops substitutions for Amber Ale,"I am looking to brew the Amber Ale listed at homebrewtalk.   The Hops bill is:   1 ounce centennial (to get you to 28-29 IBUs) 60 minutes (I used an ounce of 7.7 and .25 ounce of 8.5% AAUs) 1 ounce Liberty (4.5%) 30 minutes 1 ounce crystal (3.3%) 2 minutes   I don't have any of the above hops, but I do have:   Fuggles Goldings Target Magnum Willamette   I'd rather not buy 3 new packs of hops for this beer, but I could go for one.  Looking at the Hop Substitute Chart, I think I could replace the Liberty and Crystal in the recipe with Hallertau? (I'm looking to brew some german ales next anyways)  From what I've read, the first 60 min addition is for bittering rather than flavouring, so it shouldn't matter too much what I substitute it for, provided it's of a similar bitterness. Is that correct?  Given this, which of the hops I have, and how much, should I substitute?    "
893,Lager Diacetyl Rest and Lagering Without Air Escape,"I've fermented a 5 gallon lager at 45°F(7°C) for 2 weeks. The OG 1.050 and FG 1.012. At this point, I racked to secondary and put back in the airlock &amp; bung. Increasing temperature to 65°F(18°C) for 2 days. I plan to lower gradually in secondary 5°F(2.5°C) per day until reaching 35°F(2°C) or so for lagering several weeks.  1) Will I notice any airlock activity during diacetyl rest? How else to determine diacetyl rest is occurring?  2) Will I remove airlock during lagering and keep airtight with bung so no air escapes? "
894,Did I add too much chalk?,"I'm doing an AG porter recipe. Historically, I have been dissatisfied with my porters - they come out thin, and a bit acidic. Some research suggested that my issue may be mash pH, so I bought so pH strips and some chalk. I measured my mash pH using the strips and it was in the 4.9 range, so I started adding chalk 1 teaspoon at a time. Eventually I got to 5 teaspoons, and the pH strip still registered about 5.0, MAYBE 5.1, but it is hard to tell with the colors. I decided to err on the side of caution and stop adding stuff to my mash.  I eventually had to also add 1.5 gallons of boiling water to hit my mash temp. So, I went from 4.25 gallons of water to 5.75 for a 13.6lb grain bill.  My question is - did I add ridiculously too much chalk? If so, what are the negative side effects of having done so?  For future brew sessions I think I will purchase a digital pH meter, but for this batch in particular I would like to know if I am fubar or not.  update:  According to my town's water report (from 2014....) here's what's in my water:   33 ppm Sodium 0.03 ppm manganese 0.44 ppm chlorine (relavent?) 3.03 ppm chloramines (good thing I filtered my water...no wait, that only helps with chlorine...) 0.11 ppm copper 34 ppm sulfate   I think that should be all the relevant stuff. "
895,Yeast not settling or contamination?,"Having trouble understanding what I'm looking at here (see pic):    [website]Made an Amber ale with LME and used Wyeast 1332 Northwest Ale.  Racked to secondary after 2 weeks to get it off the trub and there was a fair amount of suspended matter that made it over, including a few little clumps.  I figured they'd settle but here it is 2+ weeks in secondary and they're proliferating a bit and still rising/falling and not settling.  No activity in airlock, but they must be eating something. Are these the 1332 yeast or something different?   I'm eager to bottle but not sure if I just need to filter these clumps out or try cold crash first?  Not familiar with this strain and never had clumpy floaters this long into fermentation, so any advice would be very appreciated.  thanks! "
896,Making an Ice Cider,"Last fall I tried to make an Ice Cider. I have bought 3 gallons of pasteurized apple cider in plastic jugs. Original gravity of the cider was 1.050. I assumed, that bringin one gallon of juice to 1.135-1.150 (30-35˚Brix), it would take 3 gallons of unfermented juice (fresh juice is usually 12-14˚Brix).  I froze all jugs in my chest freezer to solid state. Then I started to unfreeze the cider into a pot (turning it up side down). After two hours, I had jug of white colored ice filling it to almost 50% with half gallon in the pot. When I checked the gravity of the iced cider, I was surprised because it was only 1.060.  What was I doing wrong? Is there some sort of secret on how to unfreeze the cider? Was it because the way the cider was pasteurized initially?  Any help is welcome. "
897,Trying to calculate my efficiency correctly,"So I've just completed my fifth BIAB brew, and this time I decided to try and calculate the mash efficiency of my setup since I'm fairly sure it's not as high as it should be. I also think at the moment its the most useful efficiency measure, but I'm not sure!  I tested the wort after the mash and after putting it into the fermenter to get gravity readings.  The readings were 1.020 after the mash (67C), and 1.030 into the fermenter (~25C).  The recipe for this brew is here: [website]To determine the post-mash gravity, I plugged the values into this calculator and got this:    I then plugged the recipe and this gravity reading into this calculator (approximating the recipe as close as possible) to get this result:    34 litres was my strike volume - I'd estimate the volume post mash was probably more like 32 litres, and I think my keggle has about a 3L trub, which when accounted for brings the calculated efficiency down to 67%.  Key questions:   Am I doing this right? Is mash efficiency the usual measure people quote? What can I do if the gravity is too high or too low pre-boil?   Any assistance is greatly appreciated! "
898,Splitting a kit five ways: yeast (or other) advice?,"I'm planning to split a kit five ways to do a test on different water types.  The kit is a two-can 3.6Kg LME kit (St Peter's IPA made by Muntons) that's designed to make about 20 litres of beer.  I figure I'll get five PET one-gallon FVs to brew in, weigh the LME and split into five, add the appropriate water, and split the hop extract five ways (should be doable by eye).  The main question I have is about the yeast.  These Muntons kits come with a 6g yeast sachet, which is pretty small to start with.  Splitting it 5 ways is going to be 1.2g yeast per fermenter, which sounds very small.  Options I can think of:   Just split it and not worry.  Probably rehydrate first (in distilled water) then split the liquid/sludge as well as I can. Use a starter to bump up the volume a bit, then split that. Try to find out from Muntons what kind of yeast they use (it's been labelled ""X HND 6 G YEAST PREMIUM MADE IN EU"" on other kits I've had from them) and getting four new packets and using one in each.  I'm a little worried that inconsistencies between the packets might mess up my test, but perhaps I could rehydrate them all in one batch and then split that five ways?   Do any of those options sound like they're obviously better than the others, or just completely crazy?  Are there other things I should be considering?  (Also, is there anything else about this experiment that strikes anyone as a bad idea?) "
899,Expect the Unexpected: How can I prepare for bottle-bombs?,"Just had my first explosion last night. Very disheartening to discover a 22oz bottle spread all over the basement floor with little tiny shards of glass splattered everywhere. I remember overfilling one of them, so I think that's the culprit and don't expect another from this batch. The milk crate I had them in was covered so the spray pattern was only in one direction, but that was by sheer luck.   Anyway, I'm now on tiptoes around my bottles since they could go off at any moment and make another large mess. I've got the crate wrapped in towels for the remaining week of conditioning, but I'm trying to come up with a way of storing the bottles that are conditioning to make it easy to clean up the mess.... What do you do? Store them all in plastic tubs?  Details about bottling this batch of Irish Red extract kit:       5 gallon batch (I messed up the OG reading, the instructions said it should be ~1.044) bottled after 12 days in the primary gravity had stabilized at 1.015 for several days (the instructions expected FG: 1.010-1.012) added 5oz of dissolved corn sugar (a Brewer's Best priming packet ) to the bottling bucket racked the beer onto the priming sugar (to mix it)  filled the bottles: about half in 12oz bottles, half in 22oz bottles, and one flip top growler   The day it exploded we had a heat wave move in so my basement increased from 64F to 72F and the barometric pressure dropped quite a bit.   I've consumed several of the 12oz bottles and nothing seemed weird about them except they were still green. In fact, they didn't have much head, so I was actually worried about undercarbination.    The Cause:  I took @Jeff's suggestion and opened and recapped every bottle. Turns out that I had three time bombs waiting to go off that foamed all over the place. I had missed those four bottles with the bottle brush and sent them straight to the sanitizer solution, apparently without looking too closely. Those three gushers had nasty crud caked on the bottom, things floating in the beer, and they smelled bad. Based on what I've read, sounds like an infection. The rest looked fine when I held them up to the sun with a thin white film on the bottom. The bottles were from several cases of 22oz bottles I had inherited from a friend that were really cruddy since they'd been sitting with sediment in a garage for several years. I was checking them pretty closely before moving them to the sanitizer to make sure they were clean, but it looks like four of them skipped a step in that process.   Results: My compost pile got three beers and I got a good lesson in the importance of cleaning and sanitizing. And no one was hurt. "
900,Short boil and DMS,"So I just had a small brewing mishap where I added too much hops.  WAY too much.  I somehow mistook my 2oz hop pellet bag for a 1oz bag and added 1.5ounces of chinook instead of .75 .  This brought my first hop addition to over 110 IBU (WHOOPS!).  In my panic, I made the decision to stop the boil early to prevent any further bittering.  Total I boiled for about 35 minutes.  After the fact, I did some research and learned all about DMS and now I'm worried that I have 5 gallons of bitter corn.  The beer is an American IPA, about 1.058.  On a scale of 1 to f*cked, how bad is it?  What else should I have done in this situation? "
901,To keep wine sweet when do I add potassium sorbate?,"I made 4 gallons watermelon wine and I wanted to leave it a little sweet. So, when the brew was at 1.01 gravity I added 2 tsp of potassium sorbate. I stirred it well. Over the next few days there was still a lot of activity at the air lock. I let it go about a week. The temperature was 73f-75f. I checked the gravity again and it was, sadly, down to 0.990. I know I can add sugar to get the sweetness back but my questions is: Should I have added the sorbate earlier? How long does it take to work sorbate? Or is there some other trick to quickly stopping the fermentation?  "
902,Diacetyl Rest for Wyeast 2206 Bavarian Lager,"The Wyeast website seems to strongly suggest a diacetyl as fermentation completes with their Bavarian Lager strain, 2206.  I prefer to chill my wort to below fermentation temps prior to pitching the yeast.  For my current Oktoberfest, I chilled overnight to 50F, then I pitched the yeast and it was fermenting within 12 hours at 52F.  I plan to hold it there for 3 weeks.  Does anyone have experience with WY2206 and doing a cold start to fermentation?  Will diacetyl be produced at detectable levels to warrant a warmer rest?  I think ultimately, I'll be tasting the beer prior to the lagering phase (32F) and make the call that way. But any experienced help would be appreciated to help plan. "
903,What is this white stuff on the surface of my beer?,"I've just gone to rack &amp; bottle a witbier that has been in primary for about 5 weeks and noticed this white gunk floating on top of the beer.  It doesn't look too healthy, what is it?  Is it safe?  I'm hoping it's just some undisolved dry wheat extract or dry krausen.    EDIT: After bottling / kegging the brew tasted &amp; smelt fine - great in fact. "
904,"Summer Shandy, anyone ever made it?",Anyone ever tried to make a beer like Linenkugels Summer Shandy? Its a beer brewed with lemonade... and very tasty on a hot day!! Any suggestions on how it might be made? 
905,Choosing a yeast for ginger beer,"I'm doing some experiments with ginger beer (this is a alcoholic beer, not a soda). I'm use brown sugar as the sugar source for now, but may experiment with other sugars including malt as I go along.  I'm just using a nottingham dry brewers yeast to start, but I'd like to experiment with some different yeasts and see what tastes good. Any ideas of what kind of yeast would be good? I was thinking to try something belgian to get some fruitiness in there? but I'm wondering if anyone out there has some ideas on yeast that might be interesting and why!  I'll report back on how it goes. "
906,How do you malt your own barley?,"My local health food store sells various types of grain, including barley, which are labelled ""unprocessed"".  So my question is - can I malt this barley and use this in my homebrew? How does one malt barley?  Also, the store has rye and wheat. Can I malt these grains?  OK, so has anyone here actually made an all-grain brew with home-malted barley? "
907,Bottling in Jerry Cans,I tend to make more alcoholic ginger beer than i can bottle. Im tempted to buy a few JerryCans and use them instead of bottles. Do you think they would withstand the pressure? Has anyone else had any experience with bottling in plastic? Also tempted to get a few brown bottles but I'm also unsure of their ability to hold the pressure.  [website][website]
908,Can I use fructose as a priming sugar and how much should I use?,"OK, so I was in the health food shop (again) and couldn't find any corn sugar. However, on a whim I bought some fructose. I am thinking of using it for priming the English ale I have pencilled in to start tomorrow.  My questions are: can I use fructose for priming? And, if so, can I treat it as though it were corn sugar in my carbonation calculations (I am looking at about 1.8 volumes carbonation which seems ballpark for this style)? "
909,What are the UK regulations for transporting compressed CO2?,"I'm about to upgrade to cornelius kegs and have located a retailer that will sell the public ""pub gas"" in 6.35Kg cylinders.  What are the UK regulations for transporting this in my car? Do I need to purchase one of the green diamond, compressed gas, warning labels to stick on my car?  These are usually 10cm x 10 cm - is this the minimum permitted size?  I have seen 3 wording varieties of the green diamonds warning labels:   compressed gas non-flammable compressed gas non-flammable non-toxic compressed gas   Are all of these within the regulations?  Finally, being a newcomer to transporting gas, what is the safest way to transport it in a standard saloon type car (e.g. the boot, back seat, upright in the passenger seat, doesn't matter)?  Thanks in advance "
910,What to look for in second-hand kegs?,"In order to save some cash I'm thinking of buying some 2nd hand [19L/5G] kegs.  When visiting a seller, what kind of inspection should I do to ensure that the kegs will last?  Are there any tell-tale signs that will show how far through its life it will be? (is there even a lifespan on a keg?)  Some of them look pretty beat up on the outside but it makes sense that it's the inside that counts.  I'm also wary of buying something that could be mistreated but has a nice lick of paint on the exterior. "
911,What makes an addition good for a basic wheat beer?,"My second batch of beer will be a basic wheat beer and I will rack half with peach puree and half without to see the difference.   I am looking for suggestions of other additives for wheat beer. People use fruit based additives like lemon peel or orange peel, but what about spices like cinnamon?   What qualities make for a good wheat beer additive?  "
912,Will it harm my wine to shake the container?,"This is probably a really dumb question, but is it bad to shake or swirl the container my wine is in to encourage the release of CO2? I accidentally found out that jarring the container results in tons of air bubbles coming out of the airlock. Is this a bad thing to do? Is it a good thing? Will it make fermentation go a little faster? Will it actively harm the process? (I suspect the answer is ""Just leave it alone!"")  "
913,What would happen if I used a yeast meant for white wine to brew red wine or vice versa?,I was buying winemaking yeast and wondered - what exactly would happen if I used the stuff meant for red wines for white or the other way around?   Would it be bad? Would it work at all? Would it just taste suboptimal? Is it that different strains of yeast simply convey flavors that may be more appropriate to one or the other? Adding to my mystification is the fact that some of the packages said they could be used for either white or red wine. 
914,Bubbling suddenly stopped - is this a problem?,"This is my second home brew.  I chose ""Coopers Mexican Cerveza"" with ""Muntons Beer Enhancer"".  It's only day 4 out of 7 weeks but on the second day, the whole bin warmed slightly and there was a lot of bubbling.  The bubbling stopped on day 3 and now there's little action - just a few bubbles in the middle.  It's about 16 degrees centigrade house when the kit said about 17 so this should be ok?  Should I keep the bin shut or can I peak?  I have been peaking every now and again - is this a silly idea?  Thank you :).  "
915,What is a good definition of beer?,"My wife asked me what the definition of beer was, and my best response was my understanding of  Reinheitsgebot definition (which may or may not be correct).  Beer contains:   Malted Barley Hops Water Yeast   This definition however excludes many things that I would also consider beer, for instance, the entire BJCP category 15 - German Wheat and Rye Beer, nor would it include beers with fruit or coffee beers, or winter ales (with coriander etc...)  So what is a good definition of beer? Is there one? "
916,How to troubleshoot flat beer?,"Since I started brewing in January, every single batch (6 so far) has come out flat.  I've had a couple come good after a few months in the back of the garage but for the most part, it's all flat.  At first I was underfilling the bottles quite significantly but I've since begun using a bottling wand &amp; filling to overflow and the results are the same.  I've been giving the partial-wort (I've been doing partial boil extract brews) a good shake &amp; have always poured from a height.  Is that enough aeration?  All brews have been fairly standard alcohol levels (highest at 5.1%) so I don't think it's that.  My glasses do come from the dishwasher but they handle commercial beer fine.  The beer itself just doesn't have a steady flow of bubbles.  I get plenty of sediment sitting on the bottom of the bottles so I think it's conditioned enough (I usually wait 2 weeks minimum before opening).  What approach should I take to trying to find the source of my problem?  Are there a few likely culprits I can try &amp; experiment with small batches?  Are there any tests I can do?  Worst case scenario I'll have to invest in a keg setup (darn). "
917,Making a gose (salt in beer?),"   Possible Duplicate:   Gosebier- a unique style       I recently fell in love with the Gose style of sour wheat beers (similar to a Gueze), thanks to kegs of Bayerische Bahnhof invading my town. Naturally, I immediately wanted to make one!  Gose beers are normally made with coriander and salt. I haven't yet brewed with herbs, and adding salt to the mix is totally crazy in my head.  Any advice on amounts to use for a five-gallon batch? Timing? -- ie. boil, primary, secondary? "
918,Beer with Metabisulphite rinse,"I made my first cider 3 weeks ago and the home brew shop gave me sodium metabisulfite as a sanitizer (1tbsp per liter) and anti-oxidant (1/8tsp per gallon).   Last week, I did my first beer (5.3 quarts / 5 liters small batch all-grain). I also used metabisulfite as a sanitizer and it seems to have worked.   My questions:  1) I have read that metabisulfite is not a strong enough sanitizer for beer, is it true?  2) When I let the sanitizer drip dry on glass, a white salt mark (metabisulfite) remains on the surface. Does that mean that I should rince with boiled water (annoying) or the amount remaining on the glass negligible?  3) Should I continue using metabisulfite, it seems to be good enough for me. "
919,Scaling a recipe for bad efficiency,"A little over a year ago I did my first all-grain.  I adapted it from some recommendations for a good Christmas ale.  I listed the grains below.  It was a huge success except for one problem.  We ran out Christmas morning.  I hit a fairly high gravity, 1.072.  However I had a very low yield.  With successive batches I learned that my problem was in the brew kettle.  I have a very large heel.  I need to boil roughly 7.25 to 7.5 gallons of wort to get 5 gallons.  Roughly a gallon of that is evaporated, the rest is heel.  The brew kettle is on my short list to be replaced. Until then I've been making due with what I have.  from recent batches I know that with 15# of grain and my typical efficiency, I get an OG somewhere in the neighborhood of 1.052 to 1.056 for five gallons.  I'm going to be brewing another batch this weekend and I would really like to hit an OG in the neighborhood of 1.072.     Should I expect this ratio to be a linear scale? How much grain should I add to scale this? Should I add a proportional amount of all the grains or just the base grains?    Recipe:   13#    2-row 1#     white wheat 1#     crystal 40L 0.25#   special roast malt 0.25#   roasted barley   Edit: Based on this recipe that gives me an OG of 1.052 - 1.0156, how should I scale up the recipe to achieve an OG of about 1.072 ? "
920,Co2 bulbs and holders,I'm thinking of buying a CO2 bulb and holder to fit a 25 litre keg. I have the right cap to fit one.   Am I right in thinking the only purpose is to stop air ingress through the tap (that would cause taints) ? Or will it also contribute to carbonation ?   I use honey or  brew sugar for priming in the keg.  Beer is fairly fizzy when it comes out but goes still quite quickly. 
921,Should I keep my batch?,"I tried to create a sour beer from a sour mash from the second runnings of a Double IPA. I kept the mash tun in the garage, but unfortunately it rained and got colder than I thought it would. (I live in Los Angeles, so I wasn't too concerned about the season at the time.) The net morning it smelled horrible -- like butyric acid, so I know it got colder than the recommended temperature. But nonetheless I carried on!  I boiled the concoction for an hour and added some Simcoe and Centennial, and later WLP001. (Unfortunately I had to boil it inside the house because of the rain, and the whole house smelled like vomit for a week.) After fermentation was done, it did not taste very good. It still smelled pretty bad, and had a strong cheese taste. I thought all was lost, but then thought to try and add some brett (WLP650) a week later. That was on 2/24/2017.  I've been tasting it every so often, and I have noticed the smell and cheese taste have dissipated over the months. The main taste is very acidic/vinegary (pH was at 3.84 in August), but it is kind of rough by itself. Plus that faint cheese taste/smell that lingers. I'm thinking I can blend this with some other beer, but am also wondering if it is worth it. I have about 1.75 gallons worth.  If I do blend it, should I do it now or wait a few more months? And what would work best for a blend? Or will this thing taste perfect after sitting for at least a year?  Grain bill for the DIPA:   13.25#   American 2-row 0.3# Crystal 40 0.3# Crystal 60 0.75#    Corn sugar (dextrose)  "
922,"Sanitizing: Does the same standard apply for ""DIY Juice alcohol""","I'm new to the home-brewing process and I am attempting an experiment in which brewing yeast is added directly into juice for a period no longer than a week so that the yeast converts glucose into ethanol.  All of the tutorials I've seen documenting their process on DIY juice home-brew (Linked from Life Hacker) don't seem to mention any sort of sanitation process, yet most of the actual home-brewing guides like the one from the American Homebrewers Association put a lot of emphasis on cleaning and sanitation:     If you have spoken with a homebrewer about getting into the hobby, you've likely heard about the importance of cleaning and sanitizing. For many, sanitizing is the most important aspect of brewing. Unwanted yeast can contaminate beer if it is present in your carboy, on your    thermometer or anywhere in between. Do not underestimate the importance of cleaning and sanitizing.     DIY Juice Alcohol Process  DIY Juice alcohol guides appear to quite consistent with their process:   Obtain pure juice, typically over 20g of sugar per serving Fill a container or carboy with juice (leave room as the fermenting process seems to raise the liquid level) Directly add yeast to solution (it would appear the juice doubles as the ""wort""?) Seal container with balloon or airlock Wait 5-7 days for juice to ferment Optional: Move juice solution to sealed container after 3 days if carbonation is desired     Do I still need to apply the same care of cleaning and sanitizing to this simplified ""brewing"" process or is dish soap and a good rinsing enough to maintain reasonable levels of safety? "
923,Is there any permanent inhibition of maltase production in yeast by glucose,"Is is there any long term or ""memory effect"" on the expression of maltase in yeast that has been grown or mainly grown with glucose? In effect does yeast grown with glucose ""forget"" (or have some form of continuing metabolic impediment) how to metabolise maltose? A somewhat technical question prompted by discussion elsewhere. Catabolic inhibition by glucose is well known and documented. Glucose is preferentially absorbed by yeast and an excess of it will repress the uptake and cleaving of maltose as a result. My understanding is that once the glucose is depleted (or drops below threshold levels) the yeast is once again free to transport maltose through the cell membrane and express maltase to catabolise it. Does anyone one know any different?  "
924,Table sugar + fruitjuice + yeast not fermenting,"After several years of beer brewing, I started experimenting with moonshine. I figured since Im distilling I dont have to deal with all the exacting procedures of beer making and I just needed basic sugar water to ferment and distill. So I did just that. I added 2 packages of white table sugar ([website]Fast forward to the 2nd time I did this, 4 months after the first time. I added the same yeast (which was sitting in an unrefrigerated ziplock bag) to the same wort. Hydrometer said it was supposed to be 15% ABV. This time however, the fermentation is going super slow, and pretty much stopped at 7.5%. The max rate of bubbles in airloc was 1 every 3 seconds - pretty slow even for beer. Thinking the yeast might've went bad, I added another yeast ([website]Whats going on?  Question 1: Can yeast process water + table sugar or does it need additional nutrients (ie like [website]Question 2: What can I add to save the batch?  Thanks, Roman "
925,Increasing mash temp by adding hot water rather than heating the mash?,"Maths was always my worst subject....  I have a fixed lauter-grill/filter at the bottom of my mash tun so i can't stir anything that falls through it = the gas burner gives me a burnt bottom :(   Thoughts about adding hotter water to the mash to raise the temp rather than using the gas, or a combo of both? If you think doable, please help me work out the numbers for say a 500 litre mash :)  Equation something like:  250L @ 57C to mash in (for 10 mins).  Add 100L of hotter water @ X degrees C = 350L @ 66 degrees C (for one hour).  Add 150L of hotter water @ X degrees C = 500L @ 78 degrees C (for 15 mins).  I worry about ever seeing water in a mash go above 78C (sour flavours appear) so am reluctant to add anything even close to boiling water, although added slowly may dilute the heat enough....???  Thoughts appreciated!   Cheers! "
926,Stuck fermentation vs arrested fermentation,"It is my first grape wine home brewing and I have been reading up a lot regarding yeast fermentation. I like my wine bit sweet and I read that either adding alcohol as in port method or adding a preservative once wine gets completely dry then back sweetening are two ways people do it. My doubt is, can adding more sugar get me the same result?   More sugar means more alcohol and yeast cant ferment beyond a limit so thereby having residual sugar sweetens the wine.  However I read about stuck fermentation that happens when sugar content is more so how is it different from arresting fermentation like in port if ultimately I need is an off dry or sweet wine?     "
927,Dady yeast for beer?,"I have made my way into homebrewing with LME, hops, adjuncts and Dady yeast. Dady yeast (Distillers Active Dry Yeast) is a distillers yeast strain which is supposed to produce a lower final gravity than the gravity produced by other yeasts. Dady yeast is supposed to eat malt sugars, otherwise, How could it be used to make whisky?  I am happy so far with the flavor of my beers, however I wonder if I am missing a much more tasty beer by not using ale yeast. I know I could just try making a batch with a different yeast but, do you think my beer could dramatically improve if I use yeasts made for beer brewing? "
928,Cider fermentation and carbonation,"I'm a novice ""homebrewer"" about to attempt my first ever brew. I've been reading about a homebrewing process in which yeast is added directly to a juice for a period of time in order to achieve alcoholic content.  I want my yeast to be able to carbonate my brew, but I also don't want to bottle too soon so that I have a bad sulfurous smell.    My Planned Process  I am aiming to make a carbonated alcoholic cider at least 5% abv (I do not plan on clarifying the brew):   Sanitation: Star San for consistency. Juice: Simply Apple, > 20 g of sugar per serving, minimum preservatives (no sodium benzoate or potassium sorbate), pasteurized (not sure which process, apparently cold (UV) pasteurized is preferred?) Container: 1 Gallon Carboy with airlock Yeast: Lallemand Belle Saison Starter: Introduce yeast into juice in separate bottle, seal, shake, rest for 6 hours or until bubbling. Ferment, then bottle.     Reading about apple cider brews, it came to my attention that they can yield unpleasant armomas, like in this question, where the remedy was to simply wait, unless the brew was ""infected"" (I believe my sanitation process should prevent this). Simple guides on the subject suggest a 3 day wait until bottling if carbonation is desired, while the stackexchange post suggest a 2 week wait to wait for the sulfurous smell to be released.  How long should I wait till bottling my brew so that I can achieve a smell-free carbonated brew? "
929,Can I do anything with cider that self-fermented?,I have no brewing experience but I had a half-gallon of cider in my fridge that started fermenting after we had only drank one glass. It seems the fermentation has slowed now as the bottle is no longer bulging but I don't know where to go from here. Is it safe to drink? Should I boil it just in case? TIA 
930,Why is Sake / Shochu used to make Mirin?,Why is Sake / Shochu used to make Mirin ? Can we add yeast to the Koji-Rice mixture instead ? 
931,Ferment and naturally carbonate in a keg,"want to try to ferment under the pressure for the first time.,just to clear few things, please correct me if I’m about to do something wrong.   Cool down the wort in a kettle. Transfer to the keg. Adjust pressure relief valve,let the pressure build to 15 psi,and keep it at 15 psi till fermentation will complete. Cool down and drink carbonated beer? The questions are,is 10 days of primary fermentation will be enough to carbonate the beer under 15-20 psi? If I ferment under lower psi let’s say 5 can I use priming sugar and bottle it with out creating bottle bombs, cos there will be already CO2 in the beer.   Thank you for your time. "
932,Any reason not to boil for longer?,"I've been looking at ways to improve my brew efficiency, and one method that I've not seen much discussion of is increasing the boil duration.  Usually when I finish lautering, the wort coming out is still at 10 or 20 points, so there's more sugar to be extracted. Why not start the boil with the very first runnings that are collected, and boil a gallon or two off while lautering the rest? This would allow one or two more batches of sparge water to be circulated, to give the same final volume.   The only downside I can see is that this would take a bit longer, are there any reactions that I would need to look out for here? "
933,How does bottling in a half bottle effect taste,"I just finished my first batch, a Brooklyn Brew 1gal kit, and was unable to split the batch evenly over 8 bottles so I ended up with 7.5.  When I went to taste the beers after two weeks in the bottles I received 2 very different flavors between a full bottle and the half bottle.  What is the cause? and how can I prevent this issue in the future?  Additional information:  I was using 22oz Grolsch bottles and was able to put in about 12oz into that bottle.  Since I didn't have a capper I stayed in the same bottle. I did not individually sugar the bottles but placed the maple syrup(in lieu of sugar) directly into my pot.  The flavor was more tart and flat compared to the others. "
934,Benefits of 'resting' home-roasted grains,"In ""Radical Brewing"", Mosher endorses home-roasting grains, but suggests that after roasting, you store the grains for 2 weeks or so to let some of the acrid flavors subside.    Specifically, I roasted/toasted 1lb of flaked oats to make Jamils McQuaker Oatmeal stout.    What compounds are forming that taste acrid?  Can you let them 'rest' for less than two weeks for them to subside?   "
935,Can weighting dry hop bag with metal objects impact the flavor?,"Used socket wrench attachments (like these) to weigh down two dry hop bags.  They are a coated steel material, so I thought they would be easy to sanitize.  Then after I put them in, I found that one bag didn't have enough weight (after 10 minutes of cramming it into the carboy neck).    Could these affect beer flavor? "
936,Stuck Mash -- New LHBS,"I recently found that there was a home brew store much closer to my house than the one that I had been visiting. The new store has a larger selection of grains, yeast, and hops; but I've been having a lot of trouble with slow or stuck mashes since I started going to the new store.  I don't have my own mill, so I rely on the LHBS to mill my grains. I thought that the mill at the new store might be too tight, but they assured me that opening it up any more would cause a lot of the grain to fall through totally un-cracked.  My current setup is a 5 gallon round igloo cooler with a false bottom. I'm generally mashing at 154° F for about an hour. If I fill my mash tun with only water if flows freely.  I've now had two batches that we so stuck that I had to abandon them, even straining through a colander wouldn't work.   What would you recommend I do?  Is there some way I can verify that their mill is set properly? Should I be using a bazooka tube instead of a false bottom? A grain bag? More rice hulls? My own mill?  "
937,Back Sweetening Naturally Carbonated Cider,"I plan to keg my cider at 0.7 baume (approx 12g/l) residual sugar to carbonate my cider to 3 volumes of CO2.  If I add pasteurized apple juice to sweeten my cider after kegging, will this ferment out? Or will the pasteurization of the juice prevent it from being fermented, causing the .7 baume of sugar to be fermented while leaving the sweetness of the added apple juice? "
938,When to add salts to RO brewing water,"   Possible Duplicate:   How can I put minerals back into distilled or reverse osmosis water?       This weekend I'll be brewing a recipe from Mitch Steele's 'IPA' book. The recipe has a very exact water profile, so I decided to use RO water and build the water with salts.  The question is, when do I add these salts? I can add them to the mash water. I can add them to the sparge water. I can add them to the boil kettle. I can add them to all three. What's the best approach? "
939,Batch not carbonated/off flavor a week after bottling,"What does a home brew taste like if it is contaminated? I just bought a home brew kit about a month ago that came with a recipe for an Irish Red Ale. My beer has been bottled now for a week and upon testing one of my brews it didn't taste very good; it left a bad after taste and it is still flat. Has my beer been contaminated? Will it still carbonate? Is there still hope for my beer turning out alright?  I guess I was thinking there would be some sort of positive progress by now. Is the aftertaste or off flavor from contamination or does it just need more to mature? Also, does carbonation need the full two to three weeks before it begins to take effect at all? I'm afraid I may have missed on my very first batch. This wouldn't sit well with me since my dvd made the claim, ""if you can make mac and chesse you can make brew it's that simple"". "
940,Do I need to rack to a new vessel for a secondary (fruit) fermentation,"Planning on adding 5 lbs of frozen, thawed cranberries to a saison.  Can I just dump them (gently) into the primary?  I was planning on some sort of tertiary/bright vessel afterward for clearing it up anyway.  Just figured I would save one 'racking' and have one less chance of oxygenation/contamination.  Maybe this should be a separate question, but in the tertiary/bright vessel, should I add some pectic enzyme with my gelatin?  This is not the blondest of saisons, but will be serving this beer @ my HB guild's xmas party, and clarity always makes for a better drinking experience. "
941,Kill yeast in keg,"I've got a batch of cider that I've kegged. I did so at about 1.011 (OG was 1.052 IIRC). While the yeast activity will decline as the keg chills, I'd like to stop it completely so that I can bottle some of this cider.   I've got some potassium metabisulfite, will this do the job? If so, how much should I use for 4.5 gallons? "
942,A way get scum out when making mead without boiling?,Is there a way to get the scum out of the must when making mead without boiling? I used to vigorously boil the must and it would produce a lot of scum which was easily removed. I've since read that boiling too hot will damage the flavour. I tried making a mead where the must was kept much cooler (about 60 degrees C) and much less scum was produced. There was also an unpleasant off-flavour which I think might have been caused by scum which didn't boil out.  Is there a way to get the scum out of the must that doesn't involve boiling? 
943,Interruption of Lagering,"Does an interruption in lagering, or swing in temperature effect a beer?  My issue is, I only have one fridge available for lagering, which doubles as my fermentation fridge.  Asked differently, if I had a helles in its 2nd week of lagering, and wanted to ferment a belgian pale ale at 67 degrees, could I remove the helles, dial in the temp for the Belgian Pale (at least for a few days), then after the first phase of fermentation is done on the BPA, start lagering the helles again? "
944,Can I use liquid nitrogen to cool my wort?,"Basically what the title says.  I'd like to switch to all grain at some point but the volume of water required to cool a decent sized wort down scares me.  Assuming I have access to liquid nitrogen, how can I use it to cool my wort?  Can I just dump it in?  Can I use standard cooling gear? "
945,Should I be disappointed?,"Just started, so my question is very basic. I got Coopers Lager Kit, did everything by instructions, temperature has been stable at 22-24C but gravity doesn't go down. OG was 1.039, dropped to 1.020 on the 4th day and stays at that level for several days (today is 10th day of fermenting with very little bubbling). Tastes very bitter. What is wrong? Should I just bottle? "
946,Temp swings and forced carbonation,"Like some, my chest freezer is my fermentation chamber, lagering chamber, and in cases where I keg, my serving chamber.  I have a keg of Oktoberfest in it now lagering and carbing up at 12psi and 35 degrees.    My question is, if I want to use the chest for a fermentation and remove the carbed kegs, will I need to dial up the psi on the regulator?  What I would probably do is pull a growler's worth of beer at a time and put it in the fridge for serving the Okfest (and likely an IPA I will be kegging).   My two questions are 1. do I need to dial up the psi when the beer is warmer (~65 degrees) and go by the carbonation chart?  2.)  will this cause any detriment to the beer? "
947,What are the primary causes of Acetaldehyde?,"I'm a bit confused about this.  In my own experience, I'm no longer experiencing acetaldehyde flavours in my beer after improving my aeration methods and at the same time starting to use yeast nutrient.  In his IPA book, Mitch Steele says that the biggest cause by far of acetaldehyde comes from dying yeast cells from which acetaldehyde escapes.  It's also stated that acetaldehyde production increases with yeast cell growth - so aeration will increase acetaldehyde production.  I only use a primary fermentor, and it is always used for two week fermentations.  So, my theory to explain why I'm experiencing less acetaldehyde is that because I aerate better and provide a better environment to the yeast with yeast nutrient, there are fewer yeast cells dying at the end of fermentation.  Does this sound plausible?  Since aeration promotes acetaldehyde production, I think this also means I should be careful when dry-hopping to introduce as little air as possible to the fermentor.  Yes, it will be 'scrubbed' out by the yeast consuming it, but this also means the yeast are producing acetaldehyde.   I wasn't worried about introducing air when dry hopping before - because the common concern is oxidation, but it seems to me we should also be concerned about acetaldehyde when dry hopping.  The questions then are:   Does my explanation of experience less acetaldehyde seem plausible? Should we worry about acetaldehyde production when dry-hopping?  "
948,Storing full kegs at room temperature,"So I have a related question here, but my questions are the following:  I only have one (and only have room for one) dedicated chest freezer/fridge for brewing.  I have one beer (Marzen) kegged and carbed (and in this chest freezer, chilled to 35).  I have another beer (IPA) cold-conditioning in the same chest freezer.  I would like to keg and carb the IPA for a competition that is one week from yesterday.  I would also like to brew a stout this weekend and control ferment temp, but if I carb up the IPA, I may be able to store it at the restaurant where the comp is in their cold storage walk-in.  Questions:  1.)  If I store a keg at room temperature (that was carbed at 35*), pour into a growler and stick it in the fridge for serving, will it be overcarbed (since CO2 is more soluble at lower temps)?  2.)  If I were to let the carbed, chilled marzen warm up when I remove it from the fridge (as I need the fridge to control the ferment of my stout this weekend and into next week), I believe I do need to adjust the pressure to a higher PSI AND LEAVE THE CO2 hooked up, but if my fridge becomes available again and I can keep a keg in there, do I simply bleed the keg and dial the pressure back down?  3.)  Would I be able to keep a keg hooked up, carbed, and warm, and pour into a growler, chill and serve, or would it build up too much pressure while chilling in the growler?  Sorry if these are terribly involved questions, and I know, I probably should just stick to bottling until we move, but I have the kegs and thought I would give them some mileage.    Thanks in advance "
949,"What does it mean when a recipe calls for a boil addition of coffee in pounds, but also mentions brewing the coffee?","Context:  I know that there are a bunch of different, hotly debated opinions on how/when to add coffee to beers. I'm much too new to be a loyalist, but I am confused: I'm brewing a Russian Imperial Stout based on this one, and want to add coffee, as the recipe suggests. The recipe is confusing, however: the coffee addition is listed as 1lb, but in the brewing notes, the author mentions that s/he ""french pressed and allowed to cool to room temp in press"".   Question:  When a recipe calls for an addition of coffee in pounds, during the boil, do I add   That weight of coffee grounds (seems like too much coffee)? That weight of brewed coffee liquid, without grounds? Brewed coffee with the grounds still swimming in it?   This is probably one of those ""people mean different things on different recipes"" situations, but I'm just after a general-case answer.   Cheers! "
950,First Brew Questions: Muntons Gold IPA,"I finally am making use of a kit my friend sent me.  I just brewed Muntons Gold IPA and it's been fermenting about 3 days now.  The bubbling seemed to start within 24 hours or so.  It was frisky at first, now seems to have slowed, but not stopped.    They have an alternate recipe that calls for an additional 1kg of malt for a higher ABV.  The instructions don't say anything about the 7-8 day fermentation taking any longer with an extra kg of malt.  I suppose I'm an eager beaver, but just curious what I should expect on fermentation time?  I also have extra hops I got from the homebrew shop and was instructed to add them after about 3 days.  Is this sound advise?  I love a strong hop flavour and aroma, is it necessary to dry hop in the fermenter and the bottle? "
951,US-05 Fermentation Temps,"On the package of the US-05 it says it's temperature range is 58-75F.  However, all the reading on forums I am finding people tend to the lower end of the spectrum, even calling upper-60's to be too high.    This is my first time brewing and I'm in SE Asia using a DIY cooler.  Room temps here are between 82F and 88F.  I'm able to get the ambient temp in the cooler down to 64-66F and the temp on the fermenter has been a consistent 70F.  Are these temps ok for an IPA? Should I try and get my ambient down closer to 60F?  I do enjoy that 'grapefruit' flavour and best I can tell that happens at the higher-end of the temp scale, but I just want to be sure.  "
952,"What is the ginger bug, actually?","Recipes for spontaneous (wild) ginger ale sometimes refer to the starter as the ""ginger bug"". What is the ginger bug? Is it just an ordinary lactobacillus; is it a type of yeast? Is it something that is all around us, or something that is found specifically on the ginger? What role does the ginger play: is it simply a flavouring agent, does it act as a preservative, or is it something special (for instance, a carrier of important microörganisms that aren't found anywhere else)?  (When I say ""ginger ale"", I mean a fermented soft-drink that uses a small amount of sugar as the fermentable base. I'm not talking about beer that is flavoured with ginger.) "
953,When is fermentation done,"So, I'm totally new to homebrewing. About to start my first brew, and it's a complete kit with instructions.  Supposedly, it can't go wrong. BUT, it says that fermentation is over in 16 days. I assume this is not an exact number, so how can I tell, if it is done fermenting? Can the SG measurements tell me that?  Also, when it is done, will I need to bottle it immediately, or can it wait a day or two? "
954,Fermentation Issues???,"Fermentation Help  I have need some thoughts on what I should do with this batch of beer. I am brewing a clone kit which is called Belgium Wit. The directions were a little off based on the equipment kit I had purchased, so I had to improvise.  To begin, I put the wort into a fermenting bucket ad sprinkled the dry yeast on top. The original thought was that it would be a 2 step fermentation process, as after a week, the plan was to transfer to a plastic carboy for another week, and then bottle.  (2 weeks fermentation total.)  Well, being a real newbie, I didn’t realize the bucket was supposed to have a lid and airlock. (Mine didn’t come with one so I had just covered my bucket with a towel so dust particles wouldn’t get in.)  So after about 14 hours there was a little bubbling that had taken place, but nothing like everyone describes. (Obviously) That’s when I realized I needed  the lid and air lock.  So after consulting with someone at a brewing store, they suggested that I siphon it into the carboy and then use the airlock. I did this and then within an hour or two, I noticed the bubbling and “foam” buildup everyone speaks of.  Here is what I need help with. After about 4 days, the bubbling started to decrease. I would say now, after 5 days, the bubbling has pretty much decreased and there is no foam or bubbles on the top. I decided to taste it, and everything seems fine. It tasted like a good, but flat beer, not sugary, but when I did a reading, this is where I got really confused.  The wort before fermentation was at 1.042.  Now, the reading is 1.076.  I thought it was supposed to be lower?  Like in the 1.012 range?  Before doing the reading, I was inclined to just let it go for the full 2 weeks in same fermenter and then bottle. The reading concerned me though.  Should I add more yeast?  If so, should I first siphon to a new carboy and then add the yeast?  Should I move it to a new carboy, but not add more yeast?  Should I go ahead and bottle? Or should I just leave it alone and continue as originally planned?  Sorry for all the newbie questions, but any help would be much appreciated! "
955,Remedy for a Stuck sparge,"How do you fix a stuck sparge?  Are there any tricks too getting a sparge running again when it slows to a trick or even stops completely?  (This is not intended to be a ""how to prevent"" the stuck sparge answer.) "
956,Ale Fermentation Temp. Too Cold?,"Recently, I've had a streak of hot fermentations. My primary vessel nears 80º, and sometimes more.  With my latest batch, I've moved to a much cooler part of the house. I expect it to consistently stay around 69º. However, out of curiosity, if it were to fluctuate, what would be too low? And if it is too low and fermentation is suspended, does this pose any further issue than a longer fermentation period (after bringing the vessel back to ~70º)? "
957,How much chocolate extract should I use?,"The Young's Double Chocolate Stout clone recipe I'm about to rack to the secondary in two days calls for 0.33 ounces of chocolate extract.  That's less than a tablespoon.  The bottle of chocolate extract I got from the brew supply shop says to use 4-5 ounces per 5 gallons.  That's quite a bit of difference.  My recipe also has 13 oz. of British chocolate malt and 6 ounces of this dark cocoa powder.  That's a lot of chocolate, so I'm pretty sure I don't want the full four ounces of chocolate extract.  However, I'm concerned that 0.33 ounces in the secondary won't have any impact.  Has anyone used this chocolate extract?  Did you feel you used too little or too much? "
958,Propane tank usage in wintertime,"Today is 14°F (-10°C) here in the northern suburbs of MA.  In wintertime it can be tough to brew outside if you are a propane cooker brewer such as myself. When the tank is going full bore it tends to frost up and get really cold as that liquid propane in the tank vaporizes. I don't know if the propane actually freezes, but as it gets colder and colder the flow rate can trickle to a stand still and the boil becomes difficult to maintain.  Anyone else notice that? What do you do to combat it? "
959,CaraBohemian malt,I just got back from a trip to the brew shop to get some stuff.  They had a couple new malts I haven't heard of before.  One was this CaraBohemia malt.  It had an SRM of around 70L and was described as being intensitly caramel in flavor and aroma.  I had that definate crystal malt aroma to it.  I tasted some and it was sort of somewhere bewteen brown malt and crystal 60 in its flavor profile.  Anyone ever used it before? Any other info to be shared about it? I was thinking maybe incorporating it into something like a miabock or O'fest/marzen. 
960,Yeast starter temperatures,What temp guidlines apply to doing a yeast starter?  Should the starter be at the intended fermentation temp? Should it be higher for good growth/activity? Should it be lower to keep it clean flavored?

963,Glass Carboy vs. Better Bottle,"I recently broke my 6.1 gallon glass carboy that I used for primary fermentation.  I need to buy a new one, and I'm considering a ""Better Bottle"" carboy.    Its claims include:  **Unbreakable and tough **Taste and odor-free **Virtually impermeable to oxygen **Clear, colorless, and incredibly light weight ** non-absorbing, non-porous, and non-wetting (hydrophobic), so it does not carry over flavors from one batch of wine or beer to the next. And it is easy to clean and sanitize.  Is there any downside to using a Better Bottle?  Has anyone run into problems with oxygen leakage or bigger temperature fluctuations?  Thanks! "
964,To Squeeze or Not To Squeeze the speciality grain mesh bag?,"I order extracts from NB and most of them come with a disposable mesh bag with specialty grains, the instructions specifying to take the grains out after the temperature reaches 170*F.  After pulling the mesh bag out, I have always squeezed it relentlessly to get every drip out of the mesh bag (often hurting myself from the heat in the process -- but I figured it was worth it).  Just 2 minutes ago, however, I was squeezing the mesh bag as normal when I noticed that the liquid seeping out of the mesh bag was altering the color of the (pre-)wort, and it struck me that this might not be a good idea. Thinking back on it, I've seen this before but it never bothered me.  Primary question: is it ok to squeeze the bag to remove every particle of liquid?  Secondary question: what accounts for the difference in color that I noted while squeezing the bag? "
965,How long do crushed grains last?,"In a relatively short time period I will finally embark on all-grain brewing. I would rather purchase grains online as it is cheaper than the LHBS, but the LHBS won't let me use their crushing equipment unless I bought the grains from them.  I was hoping that there was some hard and fast rules regarding this, like ""after 3 days, crushed grains start to lose potency; after 10 days, throw them out.""  Does this time frame depend on the type of grain, or are they all about the same?  Is there any (relatively) non-anecdotal evidence in this regard? I.e. did anyone ever purchase 10 pounds of one grain, crush 5 pounds, and brewed n many days later? (Double blind taste tests preferred) "
966,How many times can you re-use a hop bag?,Is there a limit on how many times you can re-use a hop bag?  I use the bag to make a hop tea to drop into the fermenter to flavor my beer. I clean the bag by boiling it in water for 5 minutes before each use.  I have used it 5 times so far but the color of the bag is starting to change to a darker color than it was originally so wondering if I should stop using it and use another? 
967,Can I force carbonate a half-full keg of homemade cola?,"I make some small batches of home-made cola, tonic water, and ginger ale - usually making a batch of syrup, then mixing up a corny keg full and force-carbonating it over a few days. Normally I bottle and sell these at a market, so having a keg of each is a good amount.  I've just had someone wanting to place a small order - roughly half a keg's worth of bottles. I'm hoping I can just make up a half-keg, and force carbonate it as normal, but is there anything I should consider before I try?  Some specifics:   Will the extra head space in the keg have any effect? Will I need more or less pressure?  Will it take more time or less?   I have been pressurising a full keg up to 45psi for 72 hours, with some gentle agitation whenever I remember to do it. This yields a nice gentle carbonation that I'm happy with.  The drinks don't stay in the keg any longer than required to carbonate and bottle - 72 hours, tops.  "
968,Accurate Temp with Johnson A419 & Freezer,"I recently purchased a 5 sq ft chest freezer and A419 Johnson temp control for fermenting my beer.  I hooked everything up with a Setpoint temp of 63 degrees and a Differential of 1 degree to test it out.  The freezer kicks on just as the A419 moves to 65 degrees as expected, but doesn't kick off until the freezer cools to around 55 degrees (or sometimes cooler).  The reason appears to be because the A419 thermostat is slow to react to the temp change inside the freezer.  The freezer runs for about 2 minutes before the A419 finally drops to 61 degrees and cuts off.  But after the freezer cuts off the temp reading on the A419 continues to drop as it ""catches up"" to the actual change in temp within the freezer.  Is this normal?  Should I expect a true 10-12 degree differential because of a slow-reacting thermostat or do I have a defaulting A419?   "
969,Carbonation and altitude,"Can altitude have an effect on carbonation?   I was at the in laws last week and discovered all of the homebrews I brought (about 6) were foaming over when opened. However, all those from the same batch at home are fine. I know I stirred in the priming sugar consistently, and even if I didn't, the odds that those 6 alone, randomly selected, got over carbonated. The only difference between here and there is about 1000 feet in altitude (in laws being higher). Could that be the cause of the foam spewers? "
970,Does Protafloc expire?,"I'm using Protafloc Copper Finings for clearing the brew from proteins by adding it to the boil 15 minutes before the end of it. The product's made from red seaweed (Eucheuma Cottonii): [website]According to what it says on the package, best before date of this product expires next month. I've read that a similar product - Irish Moss - almost never expires (Does Irish Moss expire?) How is it with Protafloc - should I worry about that expiry date, for how long would it still do its work? Could I extend the period by keeping it in the fridge or freezer? If it does start to lose its potency, is it OK to just increase the amount or are there some drawbacks? "
971,Determining the amount of herbs to use,"I am planning on brewing a herb beer; Rooibos Honey Ale.  Question one is: How can I estimate (ball park) the amount of herbs to use prior to brewing the beer?  Should I make a tea and then calculate the ratio?  Question two: Rooibos has a distinct aroma and taste, should I do 30 minute and flame-out additions, or just one at flame-out? "
972,"Amount of lactose (or milk?) to make a real 'Cream Ale',","So I'm brewing the recipe below for my wife. (She wanted a ""fruity"" beer."") It was listed on beersmith.com as ""Strawberry Cream Ale"". I asked at the LHBS, and they confirmed what I thought, in that there was no lactose, so this isn't a true 'cream ale'. It's in the mash right now, and I was wondering, is there a way to make this into a true cream ale? How much lactose should be added for a 5 gallon batch?  As an aside, let's assume I can't make it back tot he LHBS to get lactose. Can I just use straight whole milk or heavy cream instead?  8 lbs   Pale Malt (2 Row) US  1 lbs   Caramel/Crystal Malt - 20L  1 lbs   Corn, Flaked (1.3 SRM) 1.0 oz  Cascade [5.5%] - Boil 60 min  1 pkgs  California Ale (White Labs #WLP001) 4.00 lbs    Strawberries (Secondary 7 days)  "
973,Could honey be the reason for a rather bitter beer,"I made a honey ale recently which resulted in a beer with a rather bitter/sour(?) taste instead of the honey finish I was hoping for.  Since I added the honey just before the yeast I was wondering if it could be that all the sugar in the honey actually got processed by the yeast leaving only the other parts in the beer thus resulting in the described flavour or at least for the ""sour"" part. Since I never made this recipe without honey before, I do not know exactly how it tastes without honey.  Could this be the reason? To avoid this, I guess I'd have to add the honey later?  "
974,first stage beer seems slow (stopped?),"My first brew! I forgot to add yeast and put it in a day later. #embarrassing  I took a SG reading after 5 days: 1.018   I took another reading today, 7 days in, and it's only dropped to 1.016.   The packet said 4 to 6 days.  Should I do anything (stir?), or just wait? Is this normal?  Thanks. "
975,1 Litre bottles losing carbonation after opening,"I use 1L bottles with flip tops, the beer carbonates fine but after drinking half of it and putting it away for a few days (1L is too much to drink for me) it loses carbonation completely.

977,Can I damage a grain mill by milling corn or sorghum?,"I recently purchased a Crankandstein 2S grain mill. It is currently being ""assembled"" and I am considering making some silly beers with grains around the house; like corn and sorghum.   Can corn damage a grain mill? The mill looks really strong, but I would rather make sure beforehand.  How can I test if a grain might damage a mill? "
978,Gross layer of foam at the end of fermentation and aging,"I experienced few times a gross layer of foam when fermentation finishes. But the beer was fine, no symptoms of contamination neither off-flavors. I never measure the depth of foam but it can have about 2 to 3 cm (among 1 inch).   What can cause this ?   Is that explanation possible? : One of the explanations I found around the internet is that this foam is composed by dead yeasts, died by ""hydration shock"" when it is directly spread over the wort instead of pure water. This is strange to me, because although I use dry yeast spread directly over wort (at equivalent temperature), I think it would be necessary lots and lots of dead yeasts which isn't all of them within yeast packet. So, they would need to reproduce and dead yeasts don't reproduce, so the explanation about the ""hydration shock"" is very strange, which makes me think that if the foam is composed by dead yeasts the yeasts died after reproduction and not when spread over the wort. "
979,2 yeast starts with one stir plate,"I am planning on brewing 2 beers this weekend. I want to make starters for both of them but I only have 1 stir plate. I do have 2 Erlenmeyer flasks. How would be the best way to go about making both starters?  If I'm brewing on Sunday, should I start the first one on Tuesday? Let it go for 2 days. Then put it in the refrigerator? Then start the second one of Thursday? Let it go for 2 days and then refrigerate it?  Then bring them both out on Sunday and let them sit out for a few hours? "
980,How to increase quantity of Ginger Beer Plant,"I'm looking to increase my quantity of GBP to share with a friend. I've brewed a few batches of ginger beer, but I always end up with the same amount or slightly less GBP than I started with.

Has this wrecked the fermentation progress, and will it still be ok?? "
982,What effects do different types of sugar have on the flavour of ginger beer?,"I've been brewing ginger beer with raw cane sugar and have always found the short window between when the mixture becomes recognizable as ginger beer and when it turns into face-melting acid is quite enjoyable. I was just wondering though, does the type of sugar have an impact on that window? If I switched to a highly processed table sugar, would that result in a more or less acidic brew? I never buy white sugar and don't want to waste a brew, so if anyone knows, please share your experience.  EDIT:  I'm using real ginger beer plant (a symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast) as my fermentation agent "
983,Marijuana Based Beer... say what?,"I have a cousin from a state where recreational use of marijuana is legal. So I've been told that he and his gnarly friends have brewed up some sort of marijuana hybrid beer somehow.  My questions:   Is this possible that beer could be brewed up somehow with weed?

984,How to clean little bottler,"I'm about to buy a secondary fermenter (generic plastic bucket and drill a hole to fit in a plastic bottle filler) for the usual reasons. I'm, however, curious how would I go about and clean the little bottler and tap? Will I have to pop it out every time I use it?  "
985,Bottle Conditioning Lager with Priming Sugar and/or Yeast,"I've completed diacetyl rest and transferred to secondary 5 gallon carboy for lagering (say 3-5 weeks). After a few weeks lagering, I anticipate bottling but am curious how adding the priming sugar is going to result in better carbonation. I realize the priming sugar is to be processed by residual yeast, but after practically a month of lagering at 35 degrees F, I'm wondering if the carbonation is going to occur and how long it will take in the bottle. So here are my questions:  1) Is it a good idea to add priming sugar after lagering completes and while bottling for conditioning?  2) Is it helpful to introduce additional yeast during bottling, or is there going to be enough residual yeast to handle the carbonation?  3) Could the lagering carboy be locked (with a plug to prevent escape) to introduce carbonation during lagering?  4) What's the risk of not introducing any priming sugar during the bottle conditioning? Will this just result in a flat lager? "
986,Worried about oxidation,"I'm brewing my second batch and had a bit of an accident yesterday. I brewed 20l two days ago and when I checked my fermenter (bucket) yesterday it had overflown. I don't know what possessed me to open the lid and clean in, instead of just cleaning the mess and airlock, but I did. The bucket was open for maybe 10-15mins. I did clean and sanitize both lid and airlock, so hopefully there's no contamination, but I am worried about oxidation. Should I be? When and how will I know if it happened? Is there any way to fix it? "
987,Boosting a recipe for longer shelf life,"I made a lot of beers last summer, and I realize that I made more than I could/would drink.  Some (if not most) of my beers don't age well (at basement temperature of 18°C), although they were great after 2 months, I find that after 4 months the flavor is declining fast...  I have one peated smoked porter that I made 6 months ago (all grain) that is still great today, but younger it had probably too much flavor.  This makes me think that I could add more hops, more speciality malts (a little more priming sugar?)  to my recipes in order to drink them after 6 months and they will still be good. Basically, I would boost the flavor taking into account that it will mellow out after 6 months...  Do you think this will work with most recipes?  Any tricks for longer shelf live?(besides putting them in a fridge...) "
988,no fermentation,"I'm attempting my first batch of hard cider. I tried re-hydrating my yeast by mixing them with Go-Ferm and warm water, but the must never started fermenting so I added more dry yeast to the batch. Did I ruin the must? What can I expect to happen and what is the possible causes for it to never having started fermenting? "
989,Malt Beer vs. Light Beer,"I remember when I was younger and ""forties"" (40 oz malt beer) were a big thing to drink when you're cool in the hood chilling.  I've since for a good few years or so have been drinking Bud Light and Platinum since it's been available too. I tried a 40 oz of some (Old E.) Old English and boy that was not good tasting to me any more.  So I guess my question(s):   Why mainly does (malt beer) Old English malt 40 oz taste so differently than (regular light) Bud Light (even BL Platinum)? I may just be looking for the basic differences with light beer vs malt beer as in my examples? It can be a breakdown of alcohol content, to usual brewed ingredients, to anything relevant from all you beer experts in here.      A BIG Wooo Hooo to Beer Drinkin'!!  "
990,Struggling with acetaldehyde,"I recently started brewing and have completed three batches so far (Amber/Pale Ale). However, each batch seems to have that distinct green apple flavor to it. It's gone down a bit with each batch but even as my latest batch conditions I still smell a small amount of it. I've been reading forums and researching possible causes and still can't seem to fix this issue. Here's a summary of the latest batch:  -Grains steeped in 170F and boil done using malt extract.    -Wort aerated with a stirring stick for about five minutes until a thick head of foam appears. OG reading of ~1.050    -Wyeast smack pack is now ready after ~4 hours to get started, pitched in to ~70F wort in a plastic bucket.    -Airlock activity starts ~12 hours later and lasts for ~24 hours before stopping.    -A thick krausen forms and lasts for about a week before settling back down. ~10 days after pitching the FG reads ~1.010. Acetaldehyde smell is present by this point.    -Wort is re-racked to a secondary for conditioning. It's been seven days since re-racking and I'm going to add the dry hops tonight.  What can I do to improve my process? Am I adding enough yeast? Should i use pure O2 for aerating? Would switching to an all-grain brew help? I've been meticulous about sanitizing with StarSan so I don't think sanitization is my issue. Any advice would be welcome, thanks! "
991,How can I minimize methanol/fusel alcohols in wine?,"I just started home brewing, have studied up on the issues associated with methanol/fusel alcohols, and I'm wondering if there are certain practices that can be used to minimize non-ethanol alcohols, or other harmful things in home brews?  I've heard that the first ferment of wine should be anoxic, but then I hear in other places that it needs oxygen, or might produce more fusel alcohols.  What about nutrients? agitating the brew? other factors? "
992,What influences the finishing taste in your beer?,The beers that I tend to really like have that pleasant finishing taste before the after taste.  What influences a beer's finish?    I'd like to take some styles that I like that leave a little bit to desire and give it that last little oomph and complexity.  If this is subjective to the beer style then I'd like to narrow it down to a Witbier.  Some Wit's I've tasted were okay but needed that wheat taste at the finish to really shine.    Am I on the right track in my thinking that it can be pinpointed that you can do x to add flavor to the finish?

My problem is that all the recipes I find are not suitable, because the final product must be always kept in a fridge and always consumed within 6 days, or the alcohol level may grow, as well as the pressure of the bottle, and I'd like to not have bottle bombs in my workplace.  Does anyone know if it is possible to make a almost total alcohol-free fermented ginger beer, which can be safely bottled in glass bottles, and kept room-temperature for a long period of time?  And how do famous ginger beer brands like boundaberg and old jamaica solve those problems? "
997,Make a kit brew better?,"I was given a coopers real ale kit of two cans and have never actually brewwed a full kit before.  I was wondering if and how i might make this turn out a bit better, maybe by adding hops to a partial boil?  Should this still ferment in the primary for 2 weeks, rack to secondary for a week? Any help is appreciated. "
998,Different ways to use mushrooms in brewing,"We were asked to do a mushroom themed brewing demonstration for a local festival/market.  Yes, I said mushroom.   At first I wondered if this really is such a good idea, but because I like crazy brews I figured: why the hell not - try anything once! Then another question arose...how? Things that I can think of:   add mushrooms to the mash (no idea how this would affect the beer, I suspect you would lose a lot of mushroom flavour) add dried mushrooms (maybe shredded) to the wort when it is still hot, just before cooling and pitching the yeast. secondary fermentation (sounds like an infection hazard) including other additives, like nuts or spices that would go well with the flavors.   would these be a good ideas?  What would be good styles to use (I'm thinking stout?)  any other ideas?   I'm interested in fun ways to include mushrooms into the brewing process, that add something to the flavour of the beer.  I'm not interested in 'magic mushrooms' or hallucinogens. "
999,What factors go into calculating perceived sweetness/bitterness?,"Some sites calculate bitterness vs sweetness on a scale of sorts, where one side is ""malty sweet"", and the other side is ""hoppy bitter"" (ex. hopville).  My question is, to do a very basic calculation of this, what factors are involved?  Could you determine this by simply knowing the ABV and IBU of a beer? Or would you need to also know the specific gravity? "
1000,What should I do about this weird bubble in the sediment?,"I brewed a batch of cider mead. Once fermentation was done, I put it in the fridge to let the sediment settle, and to let it clarify. After a few days, these weird bubbles formed in the sediment, along the edges of the fermentation jar:    Also notice that the sediment above is a slightly different shade than below. I have never had this happen before.   My thoughts: The different colours in sediment are the differences between the yeast sediment and the cider sediment (yeah, some got through). I'm guessing that the bubbles are maybe caused by trapped gas, maybe fermentation wasn't as done as I thought (maybe I need a better hydrometer)?  Has anyone ever seen anything like this? Any suggestions as to what I should do? Should I just stir it up, let it sit, and then bottle it? "
1001,corn beer steps and suggestions using a home stove,"I am planning to make corn beer, what are the times you would suggest for mashing? Is there a way to make it on a home stove? Has anyone got experience with that?  UPDATE  A friend already does corn beer. I saw the process and she only used the corn to make the wort. She did not use other enzyme to break the starch. She used 4.409 lbs of corn per 12 Liters of water, afterwards she added a little amount of hop and half oz of yeast, the Temp was 158d^F. She also used 3.52 oz of mash of a special kind of mexican chili "
1002,Tips on Using Easy Clean,"I got a beer kit and it came with Easy Clean from LD Carlson.  At first I was under the impression that I could use it to clean and sanitize.  But now I'm not so sure.  It looks like it was good for both until recently. I think I may be overly-paranoid when it comes to contamination, but want to be certain.  From what I can tell, there doesn't seem to be a clear consensus out there on Easy Clean.  Is it safe to use Easy Clean to sanitize my equipment?  I also end up with a residue after using it, is it ok to rinse tools with tap water before coming in contact with the brew? If Easy Clean isn't good for sanitization, can I use a bleach solution? "
1003,Building Custom Sized Carboys,"I have a chest freezer that I want to use to control fermentation temperature, that I'm hoping to use to with two five gallon beer batches. Unfortunately, the bottom of the freezer has two levels, making it impossible to load two round carboys into the freezer at the same time. There is plenty of space for the beer volume if I can get a carboy of the proper dimensions.  Is is possible to a make a custom carboy shaped to use the space more efficiently? Can plastic sheets of the same type used in carboy buckets be purchased easily? "
1004,Yeast harvesting,"I have just read an article about harvesting yeast ([website]Is it worth doing? would it be better to split the yeast into multiple containers and use one at a time, keeping the others sealed to prevent contamination or should I rather make a bigger starter every time and store some of it again? How often could I repeat the process without loosing effectiveness?    Any ideas of improving this method? "
1005,Primary fermentation is still bubbling after 2 weeks. What are the consequences?,"This is my second batch in a row where I've seen primary go for over two weeks.  From my understanding, primary fermentation for an ale shouldn't take more than a couple of days (4-5 at most I believe).  As of tonight, it is still bubbling maybe once an hour, but it is definitely still fermenting.  When brewed, I used a yeast starter to increase the cell count, letting it set for approximately 20 hours before adding it to the wort.  Without further knowledge, I would guess I should let it complete no matter how long it takes, allow the diacetyl rest to finish, and then rack it, but this is at most, and uneducated guess.  As far as temperatures, it's been inconsistent.  I don't have any method of temperature control past setting the thermostat of my place, and due to having guests over in the fall season who can not understand or appreciate the importance of regulating temperatures when it comes to brewing, I've had the thermostat set anywhere between 68 degrees Fahrenheit to 74.    My question is, what are the consequences for having it ferment this long? I've been told it's going to be dry, but past that, I don't know what I'm in for.  Am I going to get a buttery flavor from the warm fermentation temperatures?  Should I aim for the final gravity and just rack it to secondary?  Should I let it go until days after it stops fermenting? "
1006,Adding coffee without secondary,"There are several questions about adding coffee, but the best results always seem to result from adding the coffee at secondary fermentation. I simply don't have a second vessel so this is not an option. So I'd be adding it at primary, and I've read that this will be subpar because the primary will blow off a lot of the coffee aroma.   One option is to add some cold brewed coffee right about at bottling time. But so far my results with adding flavor extracts at bottling time have been mediocre. The taste is usually front-loaded, and in fact mostly just aroma and doesn't seem present in the beer. My intuition is that infusing specialty ingredients earlier makes for a fuller taste, and that is what I want from this beer. But I don't want to sacrifice aroma, either.  So I have an idea: What if I added some coffee at the start of primary for a fuller flavor, and then added some more at bottling for aroma? I think it might work because people use a similar approach with hops (add some at the beginning of the boil for flavor and some at the end for aroma). Am I completely crazy or could this work? "
1007,Calculating Infusion Temperature After Protein Rest,"I'm using this infusion calculator to determine how much and what the water temperature should be when adding water to my mash tun. A recipe I'm following calls for a protein rest at 122 degrees F for 30 minutes followed by 60 minutes at 155 degrees.  I've entered the first protein rest step using 0.75 qt per pound ratio (I'm aiming for 1.25 per pound in the end). There are 11.5 pounds of grains, so I'm coming up with an infusion temperature of 135 degrees and 8.6 qt of water.  For the second step, I'm assuming we'll lose about two degrees, so my desired mash temperature is 155 degrees, starting temperature is 120 degrees and I have no idea what the infusion water temperature is. Shouldn't the calculator tell me?  What is the calculator asking me? I'm very confused right now! "
1008,Is this fluorescent light harming my beers during bottle conditioning and storage?,"   Possible Duplicate:   How much light is too much light?       I've read most of the posts about skunking and fluorescent lights, and from what I can tell it would take quite a bit of light to skunk my beers in my current setup, but I thought I'd ask and share some pictures anyway. I have my beers in flip cap bottles - a variety of green, blue, amber and clear. They sit in vintage wooden beer crates I found on Craigslist or Ebay. The whole setup is in my utility closet and I'm in and out of the closet 5-6 times a day, and the fluorescent light gets flicked on and off (mostly off, obviously). What does everyone think? I guess the easy answer is to cover the crates, but I don't want to if I don't need to. I've only brewed 4-5 batches, so far some have been fine, others not, but I don't think I was tasting skunk flavors, more like sour flavors which I think was a sanitation issue and/or other newbie mistakes, like brewing a lager in the middle of July, LOL.     "
1009,Will refrigeration help carbonate my beer?,"After two weeks of bottle conditioning at about 55-60°F (13-16°C), my beer is still a bit flat. I put a few in the fridge and after 2 days, they tasted just as flat. At this point, what should I do? Find a warmer location? Just be patient and wait another week? Put 'em in the fridge or leave 'em out? I'm still not clear on what part refrigeration plays in bottle conditioning. "
1010,Screw dimensions for camco/reliance water heater element?,"I'm planning to install a water heater element in my boiling kettle.  I have been looking at the Reliance and Camco elements but since neither is easy to get by in Finland I really need to go for a sure bet. Unfortunately the product descriptions are not detailed enough.  In special, which size of hole would I need to make on my kettle for those?   I have an 44L aluminum kettle 40cm in diameter with walls about 6mm thick (yeah, that tick, they are for making tomato sauce).  Also, any recommendation on the wattage? Is 4500W too much for boiling about 35L of wort?  We are going to get a bigger kettle (85L) some time soon and if the experiment goes well with the 40L kettle we will install a heater on that one also (to boil about 70L I reckon).  Any preferences between the brands above? "
1011,"Foam is gone after fridging, Should not I fridge?","After fermentation, I put priming sugar and put them to bottles and wait for 7-10 days in bottle. I open somt They look OK, good foam and carbonation. No fancy smell or off-taste.   Then I put them in fridge for 1-2-3 days (unopened bottles), no matter what after fridging I lose the foam.  Before putting fridge I have foam, and if i put some sugar just testing, the bottle fills with more foam. But after fridging, if I put sugar nothing changes.  Ale, Lager does not matter, always same thing. Why I get stale beers out of the fridge? The temperature of fridge is 4 Celcius, and has a fluroescent lamp that lights up when the door is open. Should I fridge? If so how long? "
1012,What's the minimum amount of active dry yeast to start a ferment?,"So I've been experimenting with sugar washes and Fleishmann's active dry yeast which comes in little square packages. When you open the package and look in, the yeast is in the form of a powder of nearly spherical nodules. I'm sure since yeast are microscopic, then each of these nodules must contain hundreds of thousands if not millions or billions of the fungal spores. And since I know yeast reproduce exponentially the proof should just need enough of the nodules to ensure there is a low probability that all the yeast in a given nodule is dead or something, and enough time for the exponential function to take the starting population to the desired population. So my theory is that if the yeast double every two hours, and I pitch half a package, then I should see the same activity after 2 h, 15 min as I saw after 15 min of pitching the whole package. Or if I pitch 1/4096'th of the package and come back one day later (because 24 hours is like 12 doubling periods so 2^12=4096) then again assuming the small amount of the dry yeast was alive you'd see the same amount of life right?? The only experiments I've done with this is to put smaller and smaller amounts of the package into the starting 1/4'th of a cup of warm sugar water, and the less you put the less it does, and after a few hours if I didn't put enough then I give up and add the rest of the active dry yeast powder. "
1013,What lab equipment could be used to effectively ensure a quality home brew?,"For example how could you identify toxins in the simplest manner? I've got a few ideas such as microscopes and spectrometers. A microscope could be used to look at the morphological structure of what is growing in the batch, and if it looks like yeast it's more likely to be yeast, but short of sequencing the dna, how can you make sure there isn't some yeast impostor that looks and behaves similar to yeast but is actually producing some toxins? So I thought one could use spectrometers to measure the chemicals in the batch, and on the face of it I am thinking this is simpler than both dna sequencing and microscopic analysis. Even simpler one could measure the gravity of the solution and if you put sugar in and something is eating it up producing characteristic smells and moving the gravity towards that of water, it is more likely to be yeast. But I've read horror stories of people becoming paralyzed and even stopping breathing because botulinum toxin for example can be made along side the ethanol by bacteria who don't mind the yeast. So how do I not kill myself with out spending a fortune on equipment? "
1014,Typical Sur-Lies Aging Mixing Schedule for Red Wine,I want to explore sur-lies aging for a red wine (zinfandel) but am not always able to adhere to a strict schedule.  How tolerant are mixing schedules to time changes?  What kind of schedule is common for red wine?  One per month for 8 months?  Do I risk too much oxygen exposure during each mix?  I'm trying to naturally achieve the effect of an additive. 
1015,What is a hop bill?,There is of course beer recipes but what makes it different from a hop bill? Do you use a hop bill for all types of beers? What do you consider when making one? 
1016,How badly did I oxidize my beer?,"I think I oxidized my whole keg. I was attempting a closed transfer but the beer stopped going into the keg so I decided to change the tube but totally forgot about the air in the tube. So when I started to transfer again, bubbles went through the keg. I bled the keg many times right away but I'm not sure how much it helped.  Did you ever have such an experience?  How did it turn out? "
1017,Oxidation of red wine during racking and bottling,"I am making a red wine from grapes, the way I did it is, I let the grapes in the wine for 15 days before taking them out in order to extract more colour and tannins and then I racked the wine off its lees after 3 days. Although I was aware of the issue of oxidation when wine is exposed to air, at the time of racking I did not pay attention to it well and so my racking had lot of wine splashing in the carboy.Reading about the issue of oxidation online, I am quite worried if my wine would go bad. however I am also confused, I read in the link posted below that oxidation would be helpful in the case of red wines but not white. So could someone please clarify this? Do I need to be very cautious when bottling and storing or is exposure to air a good thing? (In red wines). The link as mentioned: [website]"
1018,Porter high OG with fermentation stopping at 1.030?,"I was doing a porter/stout with extract and also steeped milled smoked malt for a more smokey flavour as part of the process (steeped in warm water around mashing temperature for about 20 minutes before filtering out and adding it to the boil). (OG was 1.120) I fermented with Safale US-05.  Additionally after boil finished I added vietnamese coffee. Also one of my bags of hop pellets broke and some of the pellet residue got into the primary fermenter.   Today I tasted the beer and doesn't taste sweet, however the FG is now at 1.030. Wondering if this is stalled fermentation. Is it possible the beer is finished (based on my calculation the alcohol level should be 11.8% where Safale US-05 has max tolerance of 12%).   Is my beer finished fermenting or not (might be my OG and FG were higher due to the hop pellet residue and coffee?). I plan to leave it to climb from the 24 degrees it was fermenting at to 28 degrees? "
1019,How to get fruit aroma without a lot of the flavor into a beer,I haven’t started doing a lot of brewing just yet but I’ve had some ideas for beers I want to attempt to make. One is a stout with some cherry. I’ve tasted a stout with cherry but I ended up not much liking the overall flavor it brought but i loved the aromas I got from the cherry they added. What would be the best process to get more aroma from a cherry added to a beer without getting a lot of flavor from the cherry?  I imagine it has something to do with when you add the fruit? 
1020,Sediment during carbonation,"After a week of carbonation, I noticed some kind of sediment on top of the bottles:    To me, it looks like pieces of fizz drops I used for priming but they should've dissolved (or not?). Doesn't look like yeast either...  What else it can be and should I worry about it?  Thanks! "
1021,"When using whole hops, do you need a larger amount than you would hop pellets to achieve the same bitterness?","I have read that whole hops impart less bitterness than pellet hops by weight.  I have used pellet hops for all of my brews thus far.  I have a recipe that I am happy with, and I want to switch to using whole hops.  Is there some reliable conversion between appropriate weights for whole hops vs. pellet hops?  Is it perhaps 20% more &mdash; or some other number? "
1022,Performing a hop boil seperate from the wort boil.,"I'm curious to try some single-hop style beers and would like to do several varieties in one brew day. My ideal situation would be to make a five gallon batch of an unhopped pale ale as the base and use that to make five, one gallon batches of different single hop beers. If possible, I'd like to do this without five separate boils.  Would it be possible to boil the hops in separate sauce pans of water and then add this hop water into the primary fermentor for different style? Would this taste the same as if I had boiled the hops in the main wort? I'm not sure if there is an enzyme in the wort that acts on the hops at boiling temperatures that I'll miss in the separate boil.?  Is there a more obvious way of doing this that I'm missing? My thinking is that it would be easier to boil hops in five separate quarts of water on the stove than boiling five one gallon batches of wort. "
1023,Is there an optimal bottle size?,"I am  approaching bottling time for my ""ordinary"" bitter and was wondering, does bottle size (i.e. volume) have any appreciable effect on the final beer?  I have been working hard collecting pint-sized (~500 ml) bottles by drinking craft beer, but I have also seen 1 litre bottles and 330 ml ones that could work. Other than the sediment to beer ratio (which could get annoying for very small bottles) does size matter? "
1024,What exactly is yeast-bite?,"So I cracked open a nearly year-old bottle of oatmeal porter last night and it tasted a bit ""yeasty"". In fact, much more yeasty than I remember from a few months ago. I was fairly careful in my pouring so I don't think I drank much in the way of sediment.  Is this ""yeast-bite"" or something else? What exactly is yeast-bite? "
1025,Fruit beer: should I allow it to ferment out completely?,"I have a wheat beer in secondary that has been on 5 lbs of strawberries for 6 days.  The flavor is phenomenal right now, just perfect.  The strawberries continue to ferment actively, and I want to make sure I don't miss a window where the flavor changes due to allowing the strawberries to ferment out completely.  I know from what I've read that the flavor will fade over a short time, even if the flavor is strong right now. But I don't expect this brew to stick around for long anyways (i.e. less than a month).  I want to capture this overwhelming fresh strawberry flavor while it lasts.  I should mention that the strawberry flavor isn't so much a ""sweet"" flavor, but more of a ""fresh"" flavor as you would get if you stuck your nose into a freshly picked bucket of strawberries and breathed deeply for a few minutes.  I used German ale yeast (Wyeast 1007) and have been fermenting cool for both primary and secondary, at around 58° F, with a 3-day diacetyl rest prior to racking onto the strawberries in secondary.  (OG:  1.066 ; FG prior to racking to secondary:  1.011.)  This yeast does really well at low temperatures, but it did take a few days before the strawberries started to visibly ferment.  At six days the fermentation is pretty vigorous.  Should I keg this now when I think the flavor is at it's peak or should I let the strawberries ferment out completely?  What would be the advantages and/or disadvantages of allowing it to finish fermenting the fruit?  NOTE:  Since I am kegging this rather than bottle conditioning, I don't have to be concerned about fermentation continuing in the bottle and potentially causing bottle bombs.  Any advice people can give me on this would not apply if I were bottle conditioning. "
1026,Is it possible to boil wort too quickly?,I recently picked up this burner and was excited to use it to bring my wort to a boil. I had it cranked up pretty high and it took about 15 minutes to bring 6 gallons of wort to a rolling boil in a stainless steel kettle. Is there an ideal time it should take to bring the wort to a boil? If I boil it too quickly is it possible that I'll burn the wort? Is there a way to tell if I am burning my wort? 
1027,Does flaked rye need conversion?,"I'm looking to make a rye pale ale. Do I need to provide enough base grains to convert the starches in flaked rye or is it capable of self conversion? If it needs conversion, would 6 lbs of 6-row work for 2.5 lbs of rye? "
1028,Steps in Secondary Fermentation,I just picked up my Better Bottle Carboy... and will be racking to it in a few days. I have a few questions to ask since I did not use a secondary during my first few batches: 1) Do I add yeast at this point too?   2) Any considerations when I add a fruit puree?  Thanks in advance for any help you guys/gals can send my way! 
1029,pH Meters and measuring mash pH for the first time,"So I've been doing all grain for quite some time now, but I've always ""winged it"" in regards to my water chemistry. I've been using a mix of Reverse Osmosis and Spring water, which gives good results for pale beers (hefe, lagers, blondes), but my darker beers and IPAs have sometimes come out a little astringent. I suspect my mash pH isn't being controlled properly and so I want to figure out how to monitor and control my mash pH.  So what kinds of tools do you guys use to (a) measure your mash pH, and (b) correct pH when needed?  How reliable are those little pH strips vs a ""real"" pH meter? If I need a real meter, can I get one of the $20-30 ones, or are those a waste? The meters get pretty expensive pretty quick and I have no idea which one I need.  Are pretty much all mashes supposed to be around 5.2 pH? I'd love it if someone could chime in with the appropriate pH range, and what they do to correct their pH if its over or under their target? "
1030,Do I need to sterilize my top-off water?,"I just purchased my first kit and am about to brew it (tonight!).  The instructions provided indicate that after cooling the wort and tranfering it to the sanitized carboy I need to top it off with cold water.  It seems like this is just asking to introduce non-desirable organism to the beer. (or not quite yet, beer).  My questions:  1)  Should I boil the top-off water and cool it, before adding? 2)  If not, why? "
1031,Beer not carbonating,"The IPA I made has been sitting in bottles for 2 weeks around 73-75F and is not carbonating.  One thing I did prior to bottling was I cold crashed the secondary for about 1 day to get some floating dry hop residue to settle.  I wonder if this made too much of the yeast settle out, affecting the carbonation now.  I have some dry yeast on hand.  Is it appropriate to open the bottles add a few grains of dry yeast to them and recap?  Has anyone attempted this, or have any other suggestions?  the flavor and bitterness of this beer is actually very good right now, considering it is flat, it just needs to be carbonated.  It would be a shame to dump this batch. "
1032,Ramping temperatures during fermentation,What is the appropriate way to ramp temper when say brewing a Belgian beer? Would I expect to have off flavors from the higher temps? What's the best range for ramping? Do I actively manage the temp myself or can I hold the temp cool with a fermentation fridge then let it free rise?  When do I start the rise? 
1033,Wyeast Smack Pack did not inflate,"I ordered four extracts from NB and received four Wyeast liquid yeast smack packs. There website specifically recommended against purchasing liquid yeast from them during the summer but I did so anyways.  The yeast/package was shipped on Monday and arrived Friday night, where I immediate smacked two of the packets and put the other two in the fridgerator. The two I smacked that night inflated as normal and I made yeast starters out of them, which I just pitched yesterday.  After pitching yesterday, I took the remaining two smack packs out of the fridge (both are Wyeast 1084 Irish Ale), smacked them, went to a movie and when I came back they were not inflated. I went to bed, and 8 hours later they were still not inflated. I made yeast starters out of them this morning (and verified the inner pouch was punctured), and its been about 8 hours now and there is no activity.  Is it just a coincidence that the two smack packs I used last week right from the UPS package inflated while the two that I had stored in my refrigerator for a week did not?  Main question: Does a smack pack which does not inflate suggest that the yeast died, or rather became unusable? "
1034,Kegging Vs Bottling in regards to Conditioning,"I recently started kegging, roughly 6 batches ago. Initially I would keg two batches and place them in the refridgerator, waiting two weeks for them to carbonate ""naturally"" (as opposed to ""forced"" carbonation) before I began drinking them.  Then the thought occurred to me that when I bottled, I still waited two weeks, but the bottles were at room temperature and not at 40 degrees in my refrigerator, as were my kegs. From what I remembered, beer which you let sit for a while in a bottle gets better as it ages because the yeast is still active and conditioning at room temperature.  For my next two batches that I was to keg, I then decided to leave the kegs and CO2 tank outside of the refrigerator for the two weeks of natural carbonation such that they could condition while at room temperature, instead of in the fridge.  Taking this to its logical conclusion, however, would result in the belief that kegging is inferior to bottling in regards to conditioning. After two weeks, I put the kegs back in the fridge, where the yeast become inactive and thus stop conditioning the beer. With bottling, I leave the bottles on a shelf for however long it takes me to drink all of the bottles. I simply move some bottles into the refrigerator several hours before I drink. And because I typically have 5 batches bottled at any given time, a single batch can last a long time if I rotate between each batch.  Am I correct in thinking that if you keg a batch and store it in the fridge (or store all your bottles from a batch in the fridge) halt conditioning? Am I simply mistaken? Does conditioning, or the process by which aging beer makes it taste better, have nothing to do with yeast -- or does the yeast in a keg at 40*F continue to condition the beer?  "
1035,Wax looking stuff in oak barrel,"I have an old 5L oak barrel that has been used in the past for aging rum. It hasn't been used in a long time so I am I the process of swelling the wood again by adding boiling water but when the barrel overflowed there was a wax like substance coming out.   Does anyone know what this is?   Second question, is boiling water enough to clean the barrel?   I am going to use I for flavoring cider. "
1036,Fat in malted and unmalted barley,"Does malted barley have fat like un-malted barley?  If either have fat, why doesn't this cause problems in the beer?  What happens with this fat during the brew? "
1037,What is the use of aromatic notes of bittering hop single-purpose?,"My knowledge about hops and their contributions to bittering and aroma:  The hops can be grouped by four purposes, being: Bittering, Aroma and Dual, the dual can be divided yet by ""bittering/aroma"" and ""aroma/bittering"" (summarizing the four groups).   Some vendors says that bittering hop (single-purpose) can only contribute to bittering, none or negligible contribution to aroma. In others hands, the aromatic hop, can only contribute to aroma, none or negligible contribution to bittering. But the dual purposes hops can contribute to both, usually more to one than another (bittering or aroma), according to the first and second word, the first word says what the hop can contribute more.  The Question:  If the boiling extracts the bitter from hops, and its flavor and aroma are lost. Why the bittering hops (single purpose) is presented by vendors with their all aromatic notes ? Why or when its aromatic notes are important for the beer ?  ""Bittering hops single-purpose"", can still be used to contribute to the aroma ? Is it meaningful ? "
1038,How to bottle new brew properly,"I'm new to brewing beer, i've made mead and wine in the past with varying success, I understand the bottling procedure with those two products but bottling beer is foreign to me and I just want to make sure I'm not going to completely ruin my first batch.   I started the fermentation process tuesday evening, and I'm planning on bottling sunday, which according to the instructions is the correct length of time for this kit. I started the fermentation at 28 C and I've kept the temperature between 24 and 27.   My question is: When I'm bottling should I rack the beer the same way I rack wine and mead in order to reduce the amount of sediment in the bottles? and is there any way I can prevent almost any sediment from being present in the beer that is cost effective?  Thanks in advance. "
1039,Is brew with burned steeping bag safe to drink?,"My pot burned a tiny portion, about an inch across, of the steeping bag for an all-grain recipe prior to the boil. Is the beer still safe to drink? What off-flavors can that produce? "
1040,Calculating Potential ABV,"I've seen some tables online like the ones at American Homebrewers Association and Brewhaus Canada that list Potential ABV for different values of Original Gravity.  My intuition tells me that these tables are developed using an estimated conversion rate for an average sugar content based on the Original Gravity.  It seems to me that most of these tables do not agree with each other.  How are tables like these developed?  Are they based on observations and experience, or is there a calculation that can be performed to determine Potential ABV using the Original Gravity (and a knowledge of the ingredients used)?  Disclaimer: I'm aware that Potential ABV is a poor estimate of Actual ABV.  I'm mainly interested in the theory behind the concept. "
1041,Mashing bag problem,I tried for the first time using the BIAB method and ran into a big problem with the mashing bag.   I placed all the ingredients (9lbs of different grains) in the mashing bag without thinking of the weight problem/absorption.   I was unable to remove the bag from the pot - it was just too heavy and it had absorbed 3/4 of the wart (5 gallons).  What did I do wrong? Is my mashing bag too fine? Was I suppose to mash small amounts of grain instead of all at the same time? 
1042,Fermentation vessel too small for beer kit,"My problem is that I have a 15L carboy a beer kit (Cooper's Irish Stout) that's supposed to be for 23L.  I vaguely recall reading somewhere that I should leave about 20% headspace (so I'm only brewing 12L). I'll be fermenting with Safale S-04.  Getting a larger fermenter is out of the question right now since I don't have the space (or approval of my better half).  My guess is that I shouldn't attempt to use the entire can and just make it up to 12L. I don't know if I can store the unused extract for a month before brewing it a 2nd batch. So I'm thinking of making up 12L of something that's a little more concentrated than the manufacturer's recommendation.  Has anyone done something like this? How concentrated can I make it and still have it palatable? I usually like big, heavy tasting beers. "
1043,"Clear beer, really required?","I have been brewing for a while,  and have made IMO, very tasty, refreshing IPA's.  However, using only gelatin as a fining agent (don't like possible Irish Moss issues, no access to chilling a batch in the warmer seasons), my beer has a degree of cloudiness.  Friends are somewhat put off by this issue, but generally like the beer.  What would be the result if I could produce a ""clear beer""? Better taste? More stabilization of quality over life of the batch?  Are these elements of cloudiness a detriment to the final quality?  Thanks. Q "
1044,Is my SG too low?,"I have an SG of 1,040, and the target OG is about 1.065.  I was wondering if this is too low?  Should I add more water?  "
1045,Oil before hops,"So I recently got a propane burner to brew outside (it's way too hot to be brewing inside), and I noticed something weird. As the wort came to a boil, it seemed like there was some oil floating on top. Before, on the stove top, I had never seen this. Note, this was before any addition of hops, this was pure grain wort. Any idea what this was?  Perhaps when boiling on the stove top, the boil took so long that these oils were emulsified before the boil (longer at high temps), as opposed to a quicker boil that didn't emulsify the oils before the rolling boil took hold?  Pic to come shortly, apparently the mobile app can't do it. And apparently the website won't let me add a pic, see meta question. Not sure if this link to the pic will work, but I'll try "
1046,Game of Thrones Recipe help,"I have the Unofficial Game of Thrones Cookbook and it has some beer recipes I'm currently trying to follow. However, I'm confused as to wether it has two sets of instructions or all the brews are a mix of grain and extract? The recipes look like this  Malt/Grain/Sugar 6.0 pounds Wheat Malt 4.0 pounds Pilsner Malt  Extract (for 6 pounds of Wheat Malt and 4 pounds of Pilsner Malt) 8.0 pounds Wheat Liquid Malt Extract (LME)   Is that two different options, one for all-grain, one for extract brewing, or is it a mixed recipe? "
1047,"Specialty Grains, To boil or not to boil","I've been doing a lot of reading on brewing in preparation for my second batch. The first mention of using specialty grains that I found suggested boiling them in the brew water for a full hour. I then went out and got a brew book and started reading, When they first mentioned using grains, they said to NEVER boil the grains, just steep them in boiled water for 15 to 30 minutes depending on what kind of beer you're making.  So I'm just wondering, should I boil the grains, or should I steep the grains in hot boiled water?  Also, what is the purpose of doing this, what characteristics do the grains pass on to the beer?  Thanks :) "
1048,How does triticale differ from rye in technique and flavour?,"Radical Brewing says that triticale is a useful alternative to rye.  Apparently it's a rye-wheat hybrid, and is easier to sparge than rye, while still having a good rye flavour.  I'm interested in trying it, but I would like to know:   How close are the flavours?  What are the main differences? Is it technically similar to rye in terms of how it should be brewed?  Is the sparge easier? How easy is it to get hold of malted triticale (I'm in the UK)?  Is this a better bet than flaked, or are they similar in outcome?  "
1049,Selecting yeasts,"As I understand it, the selection of malt (and adjunct), hops and yeast all affect the flavour of a beer in important ways.  However, while you can taste the malt and other grains to get a feel for what flavour they will give to the beer, and you can smell hops to get a feel for flavour and aroma (and use alpha acid level as an indicator for the bittering hops), I can't see a good way to get an intuitive feel for the effect of different yeasts.  If there were only two or three yeasts, this would be fine: I could just try them all on some kind of reference mash.  However, there seem to be hundreds.  So: firstly, other than the obvious (like top fermenting vs bottom fermenting), is there a standard way of categorising yeasts?  I'm mainly interested in ale yeast at the moment, but broadly curious about the whole range of yeasts.  Secondly, is there a good way to get an intuitive feel for which yeast to choose for a particular job?  At the moment I feel as though my technique is ""pick the yeast whose name sounds closest to the beer I'm trying to make"", which is obviously pretty terrible.  Any and all advice gratefully received. "
1050,How do I legally sell my home brew in the UK?,"I want to sell my home brew in the UK.  I just make it at my flat, so I'm guessing I don't need a premises license?  I sell it bottled and closed, so could I get away with simply having an ""off-license""?  Anything else that is required?  Ultimately I want to be 100% legitimate. "
1051,Wet Crushing Grain,"What techniques do you use to condition malt? (AKA wet crush)  Malt Conditioning is adding a small amount of moisture to grain before the crush.  The HomebrewTalk Wiki recommends raising the moisture content by 2%, or 100ml of water per 5kg of grain.  What techniques and equipment do you employ to condition grain before the crush?  The squirt bottle technique sounds a little laborious and error prone. I'd like something more sure.   The February 4, 2010 episode of Basic Brewing Radio is about Malt Conditioning. Gonna go have a listen. "
1052,Fermenter Heating Belt,Is it worth using? I was thinking of getting one to use on my first fermenter for a german weissbier so that the yeast flavour and aroma is more present in the final result. By how many degrees does the belt change the temperature? Are there belts that the temperature can be regulated according to the needs? Do they produce a better result than other forms of heating or do other problems appear? 
1053,Shorter Brew Day,"For all grain brewers, what part of the brew session lends itself best to shortening the total brew session.  Time is tight for me these days and shortening up the brew session a bit will certainly keep my wife and family happy.  A happy family means more brew sessions in the future.  Is a more powerful burner the answer to shortening the ramping time of getting a kettle to boil? Ultra-efficient chilling devices to cut time off the chill? "
1054,Cleaner wort out of the Kettle,"What are the benefits of completely seperating hot debris, hot break and cold break from the wort?    Getting these things out of the wort and putting nothing but clean and clear wort in the fermentor has a rewarding feel to it, but achieving that nirvana can be somewhat challenging depending upon one's equipment (and patience).  Does the resultant beer improve when there is no hop debris? Is the beer clearer after removing break material?  Before someone considers taking this extra step in their process, we should know what improvements should be expected. "
1055,Early vs Late secondary fermentation,"When do you start your secondary fermentation? Some people wait until the bubbles of the wort stop completely, others leave the wort in the fist fermenter for 3-4 days and then move on to secondary fermentation, regardless of what the bubbles do. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each method? "
1056,Chile Pepper Ale,"I've brewed a simple base ale recipe. It's fermenting happily.  I want to add Chile Peppers to the beer to make a spiced ale. I'm not looking for something with a lot of heat, but I do want some flavor in the back of my mouth.  My thought is to buy 5-10 dried peppers, freeze them to break down the cells, then put them in the secondary, sampling it until it tastes right.  I have two questions.  First, has anyone made a beer like this, and can give me an idea of what kind of peppers I could use. I'm planning to use at least Chipotle, to get a slight smoked flavor in addition to the spice. Should I try something else? Have you found good flavor from a different pepper?  Second, how many peppers should I use? I'm currently planning on 5 medium sized peppers, one per gallon, but do you think that will take too long?  "
1057,Corny keg fermentors,"I had been thinking about using a couple corny kegs as fermentors.  Maybe even trimming up some dip tubes to be able to CO2 push finished beer out of the kegs to clean serving kegs. Here are some of the things I am concerned about.   Using the standard gas out port for my airlock set up (tubing and a water jug), may have more restriction than I am used to.  A source of regular clogging perhaps? The corny keg only holds about 5.25 gallons.  This almost ensures the need to blow off every time, and as stated in part 1 cleaning that narrow a diameter tubing would be a pain each time.  The fix would be 4 gallon batchs.  I nice idead for experimenting with recipes, but my mash tun and boil kettle are all somewhat optimized for 10 gallon brew sessions.  Do I really want to ferment in two kegs for each batch? The stainless keg is a superior container for sure.  Light, easy to move, relatively indestructable.  But I'd be competing for keg fermentor space all the time vs. keg serving space.   Fermenting in Corny kegs just doesn't seem to have a enough plus sides.  Am I missing any? "
1058,Are Sparge Arms Necessary,"Do you really need a sprinkler of some sort to sparge? Does it really improve the lautering process? How fancy does a sparge arm need to be, does it really have to rotate or can it just sprinkle all over?  What are the cons of just having a piece of tubing adding sparge water to a 1-2 inch bed of water above the grains? "
1059,Skunking beer process,"How fast does beer skunk, in the bottle or out? I have heard people claim their IPA gets skunky in the glass as they drink it on the sunny patio.  I have also left a sixer of beer on a shelf on my porch in the shade after shopping say, only to come back later to grab it and the shifting sun/shadows is now shining on the beer. How fast does that process take to skunk beer.  What's peoples experience with this? "
1060,Gelatin for clearer beer,Does gelatin work for clarifying beer?  If so:   How much do you use?   When do you add it?   How do you prepare it? (Do you boil it in water? How much water to dissolve the gelatin?)  
1061,Is rye more popular than it's been?,I've noticed the number of rye beers released seems to be picking up over the last year or two.  Why do you think that is?  I was trying to get at whether it had been a cost issue.  Perhaps higher margins have allowed brewers to use rye more than they did?  Or maybe breweries have learned that customers want rye...or they're just all using it now without any definitive reason. Help! 
1062,Steeping grain time,"We are steeping 5# of grain. Is the time the grains should steep based on the weight? We were just going to do 30 mins. Is this the correct amount of time or should it be more or less? This is for an IRS.  Sorry, my original question was so vague. These were specialty grains for an extract brew. "
1063,How can you tell if a propane burner is large enough for boil?,"Any idea on what BTU, PSI, etc. would be acceptable for 5 gallon boils? I've been looking around at turkey fryer's but I don't know if they'll pump out enough heat. Recommendations?  PS: I'm trying to avoid using my glass electric stove. If I do that I'll probably need to do partial boils. "
1064,First brew question,"I've moved the brew into a casket after the initial 4 days after seeing that the overall yeast had nearly stopped working. The cask is pressurized as expected from the CO2 (now @10 days). However I think I let the cask to cool down over a period of 4 days when I went off for a few days, so the FG is only just above the red on my hydrometer. Would putting the cask back into a warmer spot, start fermentation off again, with the residual yeast left in the beer? The reading before fermentation was 1.030 and is now showing 1.010, or just 2 notches above the red band, which If I'm right works out as a .020 difference making the alcohol level at 2.6%.?  If I see little to no change, can I restart the fermentation, or like said in an earlier thread, just sup it as a low alc brew? "
1065,Does lagering reduce yeast so much that bottle carbonation is effected?,"My first lager (a German Pils) turned out quite good! From the keg, it's great, but the half dozen bottles I filled are completely flat!?  I used a little more priming sugar per bottle than my usual amount for ales (which carbonate up well in around 10-14 days at room temp.)   I'm wondering, has the 3 weeks lagering flocculated so much yeast that there is not enough to get the priming sugar going?  And if so, how does one compensate for this? "
1066,What beer would showcase Castle Malting® Château Black Of Black?,"I have 1kg of Château Black Of Black malt. Bought it without really planning, because it's description was appealing. Particularly:     the flavour and aroma typical of the traditional Black malt without intensifying the beer’s colour.   and     amber-coloured beer with a more pronounced roasted character   And that's what I wanted. I wanted red, scratchy, burnt and bitter-hoppy-sweet session beer, and turns out I don't know how to do it. Season ends soon, so I ask you. What style / recipe would give this malt justice and meet my wants?  I was thinking about adding ~10% of it to pale ale malt. Directly to mash, as stepping extracts more colour than taste, and I want taste more. Mangrove Jack's M15 Imperial yeast with attenuation of 70 to 75%, with a bit of light crystal malt should give me some sweetness without caramel taste. But that's about as far as I got. "
1067,How to increase sweetness without adding body?,"Most methods, like increasing mash temperature, adding oat flakes, or using lactose, increase body even more than sweetness. Are there any methods to increase sweetness only, without affecting body?  I want to achieve bittersweet session beer, so cutting on hops is not an option. I would prefer to avoid artificial sweeteners, if possible. What are my options? "
1068,How representative is the taste of cider after primary fermentation?,"I'm brewing a Wilko Pear cider kit. The method was to empty the can of juice into the FV and add 1.5kg of brewing sugar and enough water to bring it up to 23L. I started it off just under 3 weeks ago and it has just finished fermenting (I had some temperature issues that were solved with a brew belt).  My cider has just about finished primary fermentation (I'm waiting to make sure the gravity remains constant). I gave it a taste and I was a little disappointed, as it tasted rather bland (like soda water and pear-drops).  Will the taste improve after secondary fermentation and clearing? If not, is it possible to improve the taste of the batch at this point? "
1069,Brew in a bag partial boil,"I was flipping through BrewDog's recently released catalog of their recipes and there are a couple I'd like to have a go at.  I was originally going to ask how to convert some of the recipes to extract but then did some reading about the brew-in-a-bag method.  So some quick questions with an example in mind:    In this recipe, the grain bill calls for Extra Pale - Maris Otter, Caramalt and Munich.   1) For the BIAB method - Do I simply add all the grain to a bag, insert into my kettle and hold at 65c / 69c for an hour?  2) Is it possible to use less water in the boil rather than the full volume? e.g Have ~17.5L boil and top up with cold water at the end? "
1070,Reactivate Yeast?,"First time home brew.  I followed instructions and pitched yeast into wort (which looked like mud) airated it a bit, placed in my basement with a cover over it.    There was a bit of activity in the first 3 days, a tiny bit of clarity, but it would appear like the yeast has stopped?  No activity or movement in the carboy.  The vapour lock isnt bubbly or anything.  There is an inch of setiment at the bottom of the carboy.  Question is... since it was only active for 3 days, should i do something like pitch more yeast?   Shake it?  Or is it done fermentation?  How do brewers know?   Thanks! "
1071,Help needed with recipe translation,"I'm making the move from brewing all-grain kits to a ""full fledged"" recipe Weizen. However, I'm having trouble with some of the details: namely quantities and sparging.  Some background: I've been doing small batches (4L) with fermentation on a demijohn. Only done 2 weiss so far.  For those 4L, the instructions I had ask for 3L of mash water and 4L for sparging (which I do by slowly pouring the water over the sieved grain).  I've found the following 5 gallon recipe which I was intending to follow and convert.  My conclusions so far were (please correct me if I'm wrong):  Batch size: 4L.  Boil size: 4.9L (amount of wort ready to be boiled).  Ratio from 5 gallon to 4L is 5.683 (22.73L to 4L), which I used for converting grain and hops' quantities:   Wheat malt: 400g Pale malt: 320g Hops: 2.5g + 2.5g   My first question is, how much sparge water should I use?   I believe the method I've used so far is called partial boil since the (kit) recipe says to add remaining water to fermenter to make up for any loss. How easy it'll be to make it a full boil (as most people seem to consider it ""better"").   (source: brewcraftbeer.co.uk)  Finally, are my calculations correct?  I guess the hops quantities will have to be adjusted according to the AAU of the hops I get?  "
1072,Do you need to boil un-hopped extract?,"I'm doing an Epic Pale Ale clone with this partial grain kit. The kit includes two un-hopped liquid malt extract cans. Sterilisation aside, I want some clarification as to whether you should boil un-hopped malt extract.  In Randy Mosher's awesome Radical Brewing book he seems to say you do boil it:     If you're an extract brewer, somebody has done all this work for you, and this is where you take over.       The wort is transferred to a kettle and brought to a boil...   Looking at the Black Rock extract website, their process shows that they already boil when making the extract.   The Beer and Wine Journal says:     Extract brewers should boil the largest volume of wort they can   manage, up to a full-wort boil. The more volume you boil, the less   color pick up you will get. In addition, the corresponding lower   specific gravity will increase your hop utilization.   but then in the very next paragraph:     Brewery grade malt extract has already been boiled. It does not need   to be boiled again.   On here user jsled said (see also brewchez's commnent)     You do need to boil the hops in the presence of wort sugars to isomerize the hop oils to get bitterness.   So there seem to be two questions emerging here.   Do you need to boil un-hopped malt extract? Why? Do you need to boil hops in the wort? Why?   Apart from jsled's comment about isomerization, all the other suggestions about boiling extract seem to be ""boil it in as much water as possible"" to get around the hop utilisation issues and colour pickup issues. If we get better hop utilisation boiling with lower SG, then the lowest of all will be... water. If we just don't boil the extract at all can't we simply avoid these concerns entirely?  For my two-cents, the best home-brew I ever made was a partial grain IPA where I didn't boil the extract and boiled the hop schedule separately in water. Even my sweet-mouthed malt-loving friends thought it was great. I'm sure Randy would approve as long as it tastes good, but I'm interested in understanding the chemistry. "
1073,Co2 shut-off valve,My 5lb co2 tank ran out after 2 uses. The 1/6 keg didn't even get kicked. Do u i need to turn the shut off to off to stop flow of co2 so it doesn't run out? Or do I have a leak? 
1074,Why does my lactobacillus batch smell so bad?,"I'm getting to be a fairly experienced brewer now but this is my first experiment with sours. I read about using lactobacillus from yoghurt so I thought I'd give it a bash.  The process so far... Simple all-grain mash, OG around 1.047. Sparged, raised to 80oC to pasteurise, then chilled to 30oC. Placed in a sanitised demijohn leaving the smallest possible air gap at the top. Just shy of 5 litres in total. Popped a bubble trap on then wrapped it with a heating belt to maintain 35oC. I cannot rule out the presence of oxygen.  I pitched in a 65ml pot of Yakult live yoghurt that apparently contains 6.5 billion lactobacillus casei.   After 12-18 hours there seemed to be gaseous fermentation going on - bubbles rising and a sort of small krausen formed. This puzzled me because I thought casei was homofermentative.  I couldn't resist popping out the bubble trap and having a sniff of the fermentation. Oh dear... I wish I hadn't done that. I was expecting to smell the beginnings of souring... What I actually smelt was an affront to my nostrils... The sort of smell that makes you pull away. Fetid, perhaps slightly fecal, or dead vegetation.  The fermentation appeared to stop after around 30 hours but the smell is still unpleasant. The gravity is still way up near 1.047 so if fermentation as I understand it took place there wasn't much action.  I have risked tasting the product and there is definitely some sourness there, but it's hard to get past the smell.  I'm now in day 3 and the demijohn is just sitting there looking completely inactive... So I sit and wait. It's around pH 3.5.  My plan is to boil the soured wort to drop the break out and kill the lacto, add some late addition hops, and then pitch saccharomyces as normal.  So I guess my questions are...  What is that smell, and is it normal? Will the smell disappear? Will the boil get rid of the smell? If I wasn't going to boil it would be smell disappear? Why did it appear to ferment?  Thanks already for your help! :)  /* EDIT */  I boiled it today, about 3.5 days (80 hours) after first pitch the lactobacillus. There's a strong sourness on the palate but it's not lip-puckering. No bittering hops so it was just a quick 45 minutes boil.  The nasty smell certainly mellowed but didn't disappear completely. It's no longer overpoweringly unpleasant but now just a funky 'note' of the aroma profile.   Steeped 30g First Gold whilst I was chilling it back into a different, sanitised demijohn. Pitched a stack of Nottingham dried for a nice quick fermentation.  /* EDIT */  OK - fermentation over. FG dropped to 1.011 - ABV 4.3%. That hideous smell has mellowed a lot but not completely disappeared. It is still detectable but not unpleasant.  Bottled a week ago but couldn't resist popping a bottle today. Obviously carbonation is poor but it's a lovely refreshing sharpness. On the whole, very pleased. I'll be trying this again. "
1075,Chest freezer not working with Johnson analog control. Did I mess up or is the thing busted?,"Just plugged a brand new chest freezer into a brand new Johnson analog set at 34 degrees (lagering). The chest freezer power lights lit up and I thought everything was fine. Checked the next day and the lights were off. The power lights popped on here and there after unplugging/plugging back in and fiddling with the freezer's control knob. When I plug the freezer directly into the outlet, it works totally fine.   Is my Johnson control busted? Or does the freezer only kick in when the temperature raises above the Johnson's setting of 34?  Seems weird to me. Thoughts? "
1076,What are good cooling times for immersion wort chiller?,"As far as I know, DMS is only created above 60°C, so fast cooling after boil is important. My times for 26 liters boil, with homemade immersion chiller (8mm copper pipe) are:   7 minutes to 55°C (20 liters of cold water used) 20 minutes to 35°C (60 liters of cold water used total)   I can't find any data to compare my results with. Is this good? Bad? What it should be?   "
1077,Do sugar alcohols count against yeast alcohol tolerance?,"I consider using erythritol or other sugar alcohols in my ""girls' brew"". Because girls demanded something really sweet and that's the simplest way to get it.   If I add it to the boil, will it count as alcohol against yeast alcohol tolerance? Would it hurt bottle conditioning if I add it at the same time I add priming sugar? "
1078,What ingredients contribute body to a cider?,"I've been given a container of Suma concentrated apple juice,the concentrate used to make apple juice from concentrate, left over from a camp. I've made cider from it in the past, using just tap water and youngs super wine yeast, and it tasted very empty. What can I add to it to give it plenty of body?? "
1079,Where to buy an immersion heater?,"I'm planning to make a Hot Liquor Tank with a 5 gallons cooler and an immersion heater, but I don't have idea about where and which immersion heater I need. I read a tutorial, and the guy is using a 1500 watt heater, but not more information...  Which is your experience with this HLT? And where I could buy the heater? "
1080,What is the minimum amount of time required for a yeast starter?,"It is generally advised to leave a yeast starter for at least 24 hours to get optimal yeast growth.  If I only have a few hours, is there any point making a starter from my liquid yeast pack?   Is there any harm done by doing a very short starter, or do I just get a lower cell count than a starter left for the optimal duration? "
1081,Most Feasible method to add Grains of Coffee in Porter Style,"I have seen someone added coffee in a stout beer, I want to use it in batch of my beer (18 liters), to do so I have two ideas:   To combine grains of coffee with mash. Make an espresso and add it to the mosh before the hop was added.   Which option is the most feasible to get a better result in a Porter style beer? Also, How many grains of coffee would you recommend? "
1082,Amount of hops necessary,How to know the exact amount of hops needed by most of beer styles?  Is there any table or something that guides the amounts or something? 
1083,How to sparge with a inner mash cylinder?,"I have bought a BeerMaker 30  and now I wonder how to do the sparging so that I get the clearest wort possible.    The issue for me is, that I have a steel cylinder that goes into my electric mash/brew kettle. The bottom of the cylinder i a metal plate with holes in it. I suspect that while I do the mashing, some particles will get through there and end up in the brew kettle.  When I am done with mashing, and start sparging I will have a hard time getting all the particles out, since a Vorlauf would be the whole liquid volume.   I am thinking about getting a mash-bag that I could put on the inside of the steel cylinder (or even on the outside).   Am I thinking too complicated? Is this effort really necessary? How would you use this?  I have not yet used this, but I hope to avoid errors that are unnecessary. "
1084,How long should I condition an IPA?,"I boiled an IPA last weekend, and am getting ready to rack it to a secondary, for dry hopping. I understand the 1-2-3 rule (and follow it regularly, with good results).   Is two weeks sufficient for 1.065 OG IPA? or should I let it go longer? If yes, how long? (I don't want to wait forever! Getting thirsty!) "
1085,Adding sugar to an imperial stout,"I did not fly sparge properly, undershooting the preboil gravity by quite a bit, and ended up using more sparge water to extact sugars. I then reduced away most of the additional water, and ended up with an OG of about '87 (with a somewhat bigger volume). The target was 1.1. I'm thinking about adding sugar, honey or similar to the primary fermentation (going on as we speak) to get it up to or closer to this level.  My question is fairly general: What might I expect from doing this? From what I understand, I'll need to add almost a kilo of, say, honey to achieve this. BeerSmith warns me that this will lover the estimated FG from '18 to '15. Does this seem reasonable? One of my main reasons for considering this is I still used the same amount of hops, and having first worted quite a bit of it I'm a bit concerned about balance (with the greatly increased boil time). Furthermore, I want the brew to be heavy for the winter months.  The relevant recipe is the following but with more hops, Target substituting Admiral, and English Dry Ale substituting Irish Dry Stout: [website]"
1086,Plate Chiller Use,"First of all, I currently use a copper immersion chiller to cool my wort.  It works, but takes at least 30 minutes to get below 100 and then i transfer and put it in my fermentation chamber till i reach pitching temp.  I am hoping to get a March Pump (like this but open to other recomendations [website]"
1087,Pitching yeast the next day?,"If I wake up and decide to brew an impromptu batch, can I begin a starter at the same time and just pitch the next day?   Seems comparable to no-chill brewing as far as contamination concerns, though I would still plan to use my IC and rack to my carboy on brew day.    If I do this, what about aerating the wort?  Do it on brew day, right before pitching yeast, or both?  Anything I'm not thinking of?  Thanks! "
1088,When am I supposed to add my dark grains,"Is the simplest answer:  ""if it has a husk and its dark, add it at sparge""?  I have made 40 or so batches of beer, but not a lot of stouts.  I have heard Jamil and others saying that they mash all grains for the full 60 minutes, but have heard of others adding dark grains at sparge.  Supposedly, doing this imparts a more subtle roastiness without an acrid/burnt/ash taste.  Maybe the sparge add is a better move for Black IPAs, porters, and beers with the guidelines calling for a more subtle roast character?    I have a batch of Canadian breakfast stout conditioning where I added all dark grains at sparge (carafa III, black patent), and it doesn't have much roast in my preliminary samples.  Maybe I need to wait until its carbed and ready for serving until I decide which suits my palette.    BTW, I typically BIAB and do a single batch sparge in a spare ale pail with 168-170 water with a mashout prior.   "
1089,My beer is not carbonating in my Keg,"Since I have read so much about how much easier it is to keg your homebrew rather then bottle it, I decided to go ahead and get myself a kegging system setup.  So, last week, after my beer was done fermenting, I went ahead and racked it into the keg and put it into my fridge over night. I should add that the beer I brewed is a highly carbonated Bavarian Hefeweizen.  I have brewed and bottled this style of beer with success several times before. It is my favorite. Anyway, on Saturday after the beer in the keg cooled down to serving temperature I went ahead and hooked up my CO2 tank to the dip tube and dialed the pressure up to 30 psi and started rocking it back and forth like I was supposed to for about 10-15 min. I then put the keg back in the fridge and left the pressure at 30 psi. for 5 more days. On the fifth day I decided to test my beer since I didn’t wanted to end up and over carbonate it. To my surprise, it was barely carbonated?? Did I do something wrong? I read before, that if you don’t force carbonate and just let the keg sit in the fridge with the CO2 hooked up it takes about 4-5 days for it to carbonate.  Well, I kind of did both, and didn’t get much carbonation from it. I thought, maybe it just takes longer then usual since it is a Hefeweizen.  Has anybody tried to force carbonate a Hefeweizen before?  Like I said, this is my first time kegging. Any help would be appreciated.   "
1090,When is aeration good and/or bad in homebrewing?,"I had thought that the point of using a siphon when moving wort/beer is to prevent agitation and aeration and a ruined beer. So we use the siphon when moving cooled wort to the carboy for fermentation, when moving the fermented beer to the secondary fermenter and then lastly when moving the beer to the bottling bucket. However, I recently talked to another homebrewer who would strive for maximum agitation when pitching their yeast so the yeast is really integrated. That really confused me. So my question is, When is aeration good and when is aeration bad? (I assume this will also answer the question, When is the siphon best used?) "
1091,New to Kegging - Help,"Just moved to a new house and finally have room for a chest freezer so I can switch from bottling to kegging.  I have a johnson digital temp controller to regulate the freezer so I can keep constant temps.  First question is what is the best temp to store kegs at?  Secondly I have a friend that has been brewing for 13years and from what I have read online, his kegging process seems slightly different than everyone else.  Here is what he does: After he has sanitized and transferred the beer into his keg he sets his pressure at 30psi and shakes the keg for at least 5mins until you no longer hear any gas flwoing into the keg. He puts it into his chest freezer and turns off the CO2. Then everyday for about a week he will open up the regulator (I can't remember if its still set to 30psi or if he drops it to around 12psi) at least 3 times a day and lets the gas flow until you hear it stop flowing into the keg.  Then after a week its carbonated and he unhooks the CO2 and never hooks it back up when he wants to dispense beer from his picnic tap.  Now from what I keep reading online a lot of people leave the CO2 hooked up and gas flowing while its in the chest freezer for a few days to carbonate it.  And they also hook the CO2 back up when they want to dispense their beer. But, his way seems to be working for him for years.  Anyone have an opinion on this? "
1092,Replicating the Elvis Juice IPA,I am trying to replicate Brewdog's Elvis Juice Grapefruit infused IPA. From what I understand you need to add peels of grapefruit and orange to it. Are these added during the boil or on secondary?   Can I just use Gin or Vodka to sanitize the peel or would shortly boiling the peels in water (before adding the peels and water to secondary) be better?  
1093,Working with Coopers Australian Pale Ale kit,"One of my friends bought me two cans of Coopers Australian Pale Ale. I haven't used kits before and I am having trouble figuring out what's inside. So far what I can deduce it's a combination of hop extracts and some type of sugar extract?   What I want to know is the exact sugar content and get some opinions on the following:    They use some basic hop extracts, based on some research it's not desirable to boil the content. So what I wanted to do is a 10 minute boil of some nice hops for flavour, letting it coold down a bit before dumping in the contents of the kit (I was thinking a combination of Amarillo and Citra). Would this work? I have no idea what the level of sugar is and how much the OG will be for a single gallon of beer. If anyone has some idea on this then I can also consider buying more fermentables to increase the OG.  Can I trust the yeast packet provided with this kit (it's been in my cupboard for 8 months already). Or should I just get some Safale S05 instead?   "
1094,Is degassing wine really necessary?,"Last year (2016) I made a small batch of wine from my own grapes. I started out mostly ignorant of most things regarding wine making (I had already been homebrewing AG since 2015), and what I read confused me more.  So I had this thing of ""f**k this"", I will start with it and see what I can do. So the only things I bought were a bag of wine yeast and a bottle of pectinase enzyme. All the rest I had from brewing. The only advice I followed was from a blog, where the writer advised to store the wine cool in order to clear it.   Which is what I did, and in March I had a really nice wine, which I then already bottled, being ignorant of the fact most wines are kept over summer. However, tannins had dropped out beautifully, and it was perfect. I also did not add sulphite, being ignorant of the issue. There were only six bottles, and we drank them all.  So, there was indeed one thing, and that was that it was not degassed. However, I get the impression that this issue is really exaggerated on the web. There is no fizz or sparkle, just a light taste of something that you know is carbon dioxide on the palate. And after five minutes after being poured out is has mostly disappeared.  So why do people whisk their wine? Does their wine really contain that much gas (which for me would be the levels of Lambrusco), or is it just because ""reasons""?  Would my wine have been mostly degassed because of the racking before bottling? "
1095,"Why is ginger fed to ginger beer plant regularly, what is a good ratio of ginger to liquid?",I'm brewing ginger beer for the first time using a ginger beer plant with  this recipe.  In this recipe once fermentation begins you feed the plant sugar and ground ginger for 7 days. I understand why the plant is fed sugar but I don't understand why it is important to feed it ginger regularly. Couldn't one just add all the ginger at the end to taste? I'm also not sure what a good ratio of ginger to liquid is. Someone commented that the original recipe is too weak so I'm doubling the amount of ginger so there should be about 150g of ground ginger for 8L of liquid. Would this be too much ginger? 
1096,Adding butterscotch syrup in primary,"After some searching around, I've not been able to find butterscotch extract in any nearby stores. I suppose I could order online, but I've realized that there is quite a bit of butterscotch syrup floating around. If I get one with no fat could this cause any problems? I notice that this stuff tends to have some preservatives in it, but I've heard that that isn't always a problem.  Can I put this stuff in during the boil and expect to have a reasonable beer at the end? I'm aiming to still have a nice foamy head at the end. "
1097,Can you centrifuge beer in your home?,"I have noticed that many microbreweries centrifuge their beer in order to remove yeast and hops. These machines, e.g. from Alfa Laval, GEA and Andritz, are huge and not something you would have in your kitchen.  Industrial machinery are just too big to have at home.  Is there any products for home use? Can you easily make one? "
1098,Making a melomel cyser,"This is my first post here but I've read a few posts for reference on my first few brews. I have now made 5 gallons of cider using 5 different yeasts. Two of them I really liked and plan to experiment a bit more with them next year using honey instead of brown sugar on some batches before primary fermentation.   So my question is, how is making a cyser different from just a regular cider? What steps are involved? What ratio of honey to cider should I use as a baseline? (Like I had read somewhere it's about 3/4 water and 1/4 honey for a mead)  Also, continuing along this line of thought, if I used a cherry blossom honey (just an example), how well does the flavor of the honey come through? I'm thinking of using a Ghost chili infused honey on one gallon, a mango infused on a second gallon, and an Orange blossom honey for a third. "
1099,"Mango Lassi IPA, what do they use to get the lassi flavour?","I recently tried a mango lassi IPA which was really nice, it really captured the flavour of the mango lassi. I was wondering what they may have used to get those flavours? Would it be lactose and mango in secondary? "
1100,Apricot wheat ale extract recipe – advice and opinions,"This is my first recipe design! I've brewed a couple of extract and all-grain batches, with moderate success. This time around I will be trying to clone an apricot wheat ale. The original is a very easy drinking, light ale with prominent apricot flavour. Looking to do an extract brew for a simple pragmatic recipe and efficient brew day. Here is my recipe so far: [website]Planning to brew 5 gallons of beer. I'm aiming to get as close as possible to ABV = 5%, IBU = 15, OG = 1.063, FG = 1.025, and use Williamette and Golding hops, all according to the stats on the original beer. I will add 4 oz of Brewer's Best apricot flavouring as well as my priming sugar to the bottling bucket before I bottle.  Main concern right now is a low OG/FG. The desired 1.063/1.025 seem high for a light wheat ale.  I'm looking to validate my assumptions! I have very little experience  and would appreciate any help if there are some dumb mistakes here.   Not sure how to design the hop and boil schedule.    It looks like Williamette and Golding have somewhat similar attributes, so the order seems arbitrary to me. 30 and 15 min additions bring me close to my target 15 IBU. Is there a good rule or logic to apply here? This is a 30 minute boil purely as a consequence of the 30 minute hop boil time. Should I change the boil time at all?  Does it make sense to use 2 lb of maltodextrin?   I've been seeing that 8 oz is standard, 1 lb can be done, but according to Brewer's Friend, 2 lb would bring my OG and FG exactly where they need to go. It's tempting!  I chose the Safale S-05 to mimic an ""american wheat ale"".    Don't want spicy/clove flavours to dominate the apricot flavouring I will add. I also chose dry Safale to keep it simple. Does it make more sense to use a different yeast with lower attenuation so as not to bring my FG down below 1.025?  For steeping grain, I chose to add Carafoam malts based on a fruit weissbier recipe I saw.    I replaced Carapils with Carafoam as my LHBS doesn't have Carapils at the moment. (It does have Caramel Pils, is that about the same?) Any educated suggestions on potential steeping grains I can use to raise OG and FG or for other benefits?  Planning on a 7-10 day fermentation with no secondary (keeping it simple).  "
1101,Serving through a carbonation stone,"Are there any disadvantages to leaving a diffuser stone (0.5micron) in the keg for serving?  The one I had bought is attached to a replacement SS dip tube and permanently in the keg.    My option would be to transfer to a new keg after carbonation, but... extra cleaning/sani/time/effort and chance of O2/contam.   In other words, if it's not a big factor, and the stone will still bubble gas up to the headspace for serving, I won't bother.  To take that further, after I get my carb to the desired volume using temp chart, wetting psi, atmospheric, and elevation, do I leave gas at that setting or lower it to regular chart pressure to just push out the beer at that CO2 volume? "
1102,"I'm suspecting high Diacetyl in my beer, is it safe to drink?","Today I tasted a new batch that was done priming, the beer has a distinct but mild butter after taste, so I'm suspecting high Diacetyl levels, is it still safe to drink? Or should I throw it all?  "
1103,Beer sat for too long in the carboy,I made a chocolate-cherry brown ale with an extra ounce of hops (in 5 gallon carboy) back at the beginning of October. Would it be safe to bottle and skip secondary fermentation? There's also a thin layer of white stuff on top (mold?). Is it still good to bottle? 
1104,Alternative to making a yeast starter | Red IPA,"I am planning on trying this recipe - [website]  1 Liter starter of either White Labs WLP001 or Wyeast 1056.   After that is says:     You can substitute one 11.5 gram package of Safale US-05 for the   starter of liquid yeast.   My question is, instead of making a yeast starter, can I just buy 2 packets of Safale US-05 ([website]Another options I was considering was using 1 packet of liquid CALIFORNIA ALE YEAST - WLP001 ([website]Would either of these options be a suitable alternative to making the yeast starter?  Thanks. "
1105,Formulating a recipe with birch sap,"Background  Based on my searching here and elsewhere, brewing with birch sap is quite uncommon with brewers (although I did find one brewer that mentioned brewing with maple sap).   So I'd like to get a list of things to think about as I develop a beer recipe based on birch sap.  Brewing with sap is different than using syrup because knowing the flavor of the sap once concentrated is unknown in the case of using sap.  Specific Gravity / Flavor Concentration  From what I have been able to ascertain so far, the sap, right out of the tree is in the 1.004 to 1.007 range.  One approach would be to heat the sap and use it as my mash and sparge water.  In that case, there may be very little birch flavor in the final product.  On the other end of the spectrum would be to gently evaporate1 the sap until the specific gravity gets to a place that would make a beer on it's own, without grain.  That would yield the strongest birch flavor, but might be ""too much"".  Flavors  I have tasted birch sap out of the tree2, and it's almost like pure water, but I don't know how the flavor would change if the sap was concentrated by evaporation.  Based on what that taste would be, then hops could be selected that would mesh appropriately.  Fermentability  If the out-of-the-tree specific gravity is, say, 1.005, is there any way to tell how much of that will be fermentable sugars, and what will be left as residual sweetness?  Or even how much of that gravity is caused by dissolved sugars versus something else (minerals?).  Recipe Guidelines  Are there any rules of thumb for birch sap based beer recipes?  Or rules of thumb from maple sap based beer recipes?  What techniques could be employed to select a reasonable starting point for the brewing of a birch sap beer?    Footnotes:   1. Boiling apparently causes a poor shift in flavor towards ""burnt""    2. I cut a branch off of a river birch tree in my yard last spring and the sap dripped for weeks.  I had to taste it.  "
1106,Safe way to backsweet a braggot with honey?,"Just made an experimental batch of chocolate braggot. About 60% various grain and 40% honey, OG 1.069, Safale S-04 yeast. We like to have some sweetness as well as mid-high carbonation in the final results hence wondering if there's a safe way to backsweet it (preferably with honey, not non-fermentables like lactose) yet keep the fizzy part of it? Controlled pasteurisation perhaps? "
1107,Effectiveness of Neale's Brewing Supplies no rinse sanitizer,"What Ph level does Neale's Brewing Supplies sanitizer remain effective to?  It has a similar ingredient list to starsan, which is listed to be effective so long as the pH of the solution is 3 or lower.  I live in an area of hard water and want to check my sanitization is up to scratch...  Also generally, how effective is this compared to StarSan? StarSan seems to be a lot more popular on the internet, but not sure if this is just because of a skew towards homebrewers in the US. "
1108,Flavor effects of adding yeast energizer or nutrient to beer?,"My understanding is that generally (with the possible exception of starters) yeast nutrient and energizer are not really needed for beer, as the barley provides basically everything required.  However, is there any possible downside to adding them?  Obviously using it when it adds no value is wasteful but is there anything in yeast nutrient or yeast energizer that would adversely affect the beer if too much is present in the final product?  On the other end, the yeast energizer I have lists its ingredients as diammonium phosphate, Springcell, and magnesium sulfate.  Of these, magnesium sulfate sticks out as something that might benefit hoppier beers. I would imagine the amount in the yeast energizer would be relatively small, but maybe they could be high enough to make a noticeable difference?  More generally, are there any possible flavor impacts of yeast nutrient or yeast energizer if added to an otherwise normal batch of beer?  I'm mostly thinking all-malt beer, but if this might be different for wheat beer or similar then I would be interested in that as well. "
1109,How can I store still hard apple in a barrel before drinking?,"I am a beginner homebrewer, so I will explain my situation in more detail to make sure I am making still hard cider correctly. Recently, I started my first batch by adding 1 gallon of pasteurized store-bought apple cider to a carboy along with a packet of Lalvin-E1118 yeast. So far, I’ve put an airlock on it and have left it alone for about 2 weeks. My question is, when exactly do I start secondary fermentation, how do I do so, and is it possible to store the still cider in a wine/whisky barrel with a spigot instead of bottling? I am not ready to start carbonating and bottling the cider until I have found a tasty recipe that I like. Also, I tasted the primary brew and it is very sour. Is there a way to make the cider sweeter? Thanks "

1112,Is this beerstone or something else? White haze in my kettle.,"I recently moved. As part of the move, I changed my brewing process and went back to using my old brew pot (instead of an electric turkey fryer) and started using filtered tap water instead of distilled (the water tastes better here).  After brewing for the first time at the new place, I noticed a layer of white haze at the bottom of the kettle. Is this beer stone (I thought that was always a little brown)? I've never experienced this white haze before--it might have to do with the water change or the fact that I'm using a kettle I haven't touched for years.  If so, has anyone had success getting it off? What do you use? Star San, CLR, Oxiclean, PBW? Thanks!   "
1113,Victory v. Biscuit malt,"Are there flavor differences between these two malts? How can each be described? I have used them both but often in complicated recipes, and never side by side for comparison. How is each produced? "
1114,How can I compare hop flavours quickly?,"I want to try and acquaint myself with different hop flavours and brewing a few batches of beer can be quite time consuming (and wasteful if the results are no good).  How can I quickly (in say, a day) compare the flavours of a range of hops? I'd like to encompass bittering and aroma qualities if possible.  Is a basic hop tea sufficient? If so, what ratio of hops to water should I use? Should I do a few basic boils with extract malts to compare? What works? "
1115,Anyone ever had their secondary fermentation bubble for 3 weeks?,"So first fermentation went smoothly, solid bubbling from the airlock for about 5 days total racked into second fermenter and dry hopped on the seventh day.  First day nothing.  Second day it started right up, third day slowed down but held steady.  So I then traveled out of town for five days thinking it would be nice and perfect to bottle when i got home, that was over two weeks ago.  We didn't leave the A/C on in the house and it got quite warm in out house, the temp. on the outside of the carboy read 78 degrees, and it was bubbling every three seconds.  Its been two weeks since then and has just now only started to bubble once a minute.  So my question is, will my Summer Ale still be drinkable?  Or was that way too much temp. change for my poor neglected beer?  Any advice would be greatly appreciated!   "
1116,Has anyone brewed hop-free beer?,"I just tried a beer called Reverend James and it tasted really weird. Full-bodied and slightly spicy but I could detect absolutely no hop characteristics in it at all.   Now, it could be that my palate isn't very sophisticated (it isn't), but could it have been boiled with no hops at all?  Has anyone brewed without hops (or any other ""flavouring"")? Does just fermented malt produce a drinkable beer? "
1117,Using Irish Moss in Red Ales?,I have heard about using irish moss in ales as a clarifyer... how do you use it? How much? When? And does it affect the taste of a beer? I am planning on using it with an Irish Red Ale Extract kit.... any suggestions you would have would be great. 
1118,Fermentation Activity in the first few days,"I know a variant of this question has been asked a million times, but can someone let me know if this behavior is ""normal"" for a brew?  I'm using Northern Brewer's Caribou Slobber Brown kit.  I brewed on Saturday evening, followed the instructions carefully (the only thing I did 'incorrectly' was add water/wort in the wrong order.  The instructions said to put 2 gal. of cold water in the Carboy first, I put the wort in, then realized my mistake). The wort was cool to the touch by the time I added the yeast.  All day Sunday I had crazy activity in the fermentor: the bubbles were going so fast that it sounded like a boiling pot, and the krausen was thick and active (it rose and sank, and all sorts of stuff).  Monday I went down and it has all but stopped.  I sat and watched for a while and barely saw a bubble (i can't tell if it was my tapping fingers on the clawfoot tub the carboy was in or what).  All that was left of the krausen was the sticky stuff on the sides of the better bottle.  Wondering two things in specific:   Is the beer in trouble for having ""gone"" so fast? Should I try and rinse the krausen particulate back into the wort?   It's been particularly warm the last few days, but it's in a dimly lit, rarely used bathroom in the lowest part of my apartment (we have three half-stories).  Overall it's been a very comfortable temperature in the room. "
1119,"What does ""a thorough diacetyl rest"" mean when talking about ale yeast?","Most of my knowledge of diactyl rests come from Palmer's How to Brew, and it applies entirely to lagers. It mainly means bringing the temperature up slowly and letting the lager sit at a slightly higher temperature for a couple of days so the yeast consume the diacetyl produced in the cold fermentation.  Wyeast recommends a thorough diacetyl rest with their ESB yeast, though, and I wonder what in the heck this means.     A very good cask conditioned ale strain, this extremely flocculant yeast produces distinctly malty beers. Attenuation levels are typically less than most other yeast strains which results in a slightly sweeter finish. Ales produced with this strain tend to be fruity, increasingly so with higher fermentation temperatures of 70-74°F (21-23° C). A thorough diacetyl rest is recommended after fermentation is complete. Bright beers are easily achieved within days without any filtration.   What if I'm fermenting at the top of the range anyway? "
1120,How much ginger should be used at what point of the process?,"What is a reasonable amount of fresh ginger to use to lightly flavor a beer? Does the quantity to use differ based on when it is added in the process (boil vs flame out vs secondary)?   I realize ""lightly"" is a rather subjective term but I'm just trying to say that the ginger flavor should not be the primary taste. "
1121,How do you calculate a beer's nutrition facts?,"How can I figure out a beer's nutrition facts when I've homebrewed?  It's not a sum of the ingredients any more, is it?  --EDIT--  So when I say ""beer's nutrition facts"" I means values like calories, carbs, proteins, vitamins, etc. "
1122,Filtering out the dead yeast cells and other trub during transfer from primary to secondary fermentation,"Typically, when I transfer my wort from the pot to the bucket/carboy for primary fermentation, I like to use a very fine knit mesh reusable grain bag to catch all the hops, and other trub that has collected before I pitch my yeast and set aside for fermentation.  This time around, I have a sour cherry ale, and I ended up leaving the cherries in for the primary fermentation.  I have a ridiculous amount of trub now from all the cherries, and I'm wondering since I now pitched my yeast if it would be a good idea to filter it through the grain bag again?  I fear that by doing so I may trap the yeast in the trub, therefor am a little hesitant to do so before I hear someone speaking from experience saying it's ok to do.  Thoughts? "
1123,How much distillers yeast do I use in a 5 gallon batch of beer?,"The recipe I'm working on calls for the use of distillers yeast half way through my primary fermentation (among other things like plenty of sugar, aeration, etc...).  Problem is, it doesn't really specify how much I should use.  I picked up a 1 lb bag of Crosby &amp; Baker's distillers yeast, and plan to get a starter going with it.  Only problem is, I highly doubt I am supposed to use an entire lbs when adding it in.  To put some perspective on how much sugar is going into it, I'm waiting for the vigorous primary fermentation to calm down, then plan to add sugar daily, in the amount of 1 oz. per day (cane or demerara, alternating), for five days.  After that cools off, I transfer the beer out of the carboy to rid of the dead yeast cells, add the distillers yeast, aerate, then put back into the cleaned out carboy and continue to add 1 oz. of sugar for another five days before I transfer to secondary to let it sit for several weeks.  How much distillers yeast should I add to this batch based off of the size and the amount of sugar?  I probably should have brought up the target 14-16% ABV part.

PROCESS          Fill a grain bag with the crushed cara-munich malt and the crushed special b malt. Tie off the top and place the bag in your brewpot   filled with 5 gallons of cool water. Add the gypsum to the water. Heat   the pot and stir the water and grain bag every 5 minutes.    As the water reaches 170 F (77 C) pull the specialty grain bag using a large stirring spoon. Hold the bag above the brewpot for a   minute, allowing most of the liquid to drain into the pot. Do not   squeeze the grain bag.    As the water begins to boil, remove the pot from the heat. Add the light malt extract. Stir to prevent clumping and scorching on the   bottom of the pot. Return to heat.    Allow the wort to come up to a boil. After preboiling for 5 minutes add the Tomahawk hop pellets and stir. Start timing the 1 hour boil at   the point that you can make this hop addition.    20 minutes before the end of the boil, add the Chinook hop pellets, 1/2 pound of cane sugar, and the irish moss, stir for one minute.   10 minutes before the end of the boil add 1/2 pound of demerara sugar and stir for 1 minute.    At the 60 minute mark of the biol turn off the heat source. Stir the wort clockwise for 2 minutes as you build up a whirlpool effect.   Stop stirring and allow the wort to sit for 10 minutes.    Chill the wort in a cold water bath to a temperature of 70 - 75 F (21 - 24 C)   Transfer the wort into a carboy. Add the yeast nutrient.    Pitch the primary strong ale yeast into the carboy. Top up the wort to the 5 gallon mark with water. Set up the aquarium pump, hose,   and aeration stone, and oxygenate beer for 1 hour.    After the vigorous primary fermentation slows down (around 8 - 10 days) you will hear the airlock bubbling less frequently. Once this   slowdown occurs, alternate between 1 ounce of pure cane sugar and 1   ounce of demerara sugar additions to the carboy every day for 5 days   straight.    A few days after the primary fermentation slows down, transfer your beer into the sterilize bottling bucket while you clean out the   carboy. many yeast cells have grown in this sugar rich environment,   and you want to leave the layer of dead yeast cells that have dropped   to the bottom of the back as you transfer to the bottling bucket.   Add the cascade hop pellets to the empty sterilized carboy. Transfer the beer back into your sterilized carboy and pitch your   secondary super high gravity yeast. A good yeast starter is a good   idea. Set up your aquarium pump/hose/aerating stone unit once again   and aerate the beer for 1 full hour. Again you will be adding 1 ounce   of pure cane sugar followed by 1 ounce of demerara sugar the next day   for 5 straight days. The difference here is that you begin the sugar   additions the day you transfer and aerate the beer for secondary   fermentation. Secondary fermentation should last 1-3 weeks. 2 weeks   after all fermentation activy subsides your beer should be ready to   bottle.    For this high gravity beer, you will be adding additional yeast at bottling to make sure that the beer has fresh yeast for the bottle   conditioning. While transferring the beer to the bottling bucket, use   a cup of the beer to dissolve the champagne yeast. Add the Champagne   yeast mixture to the bottling bucket and stir well. Now add the   priming sugar dissolved in 1 cup of boiling water to the bottling   bucket and stir well before bottling.    In another 3 weeks, your beer should be ready to drink. This is another long keeper and will mature well with age. It will be better   after a year of aging, if you can wait that long>   * 1 ounce pure care sugar (day 15)  * 1 ounce demerara sugar (day   16)  * 1 ounce pure cane sugar (day 17)     "
1124,Should I worry about blow-off?,I brewed a batch of IPA yesterday and when I checked on it today it had started to blow-off.  There is so much pressure in the primary that it has spilled up through the airlock and is constantly whistling.  Should I be concerned about this?  Is there anything I should do to correct it?  The beer is a modified version of this recipe: [website]The modification was to use liquid malt extract instead (10 lbs) and substituted Wyeast 1056 (American Ale) and was made at the recommendation of my local homebrewing store.    
1125,Banana Mead Yeast Suggestions,"I'm planning to brew a banana mead, and would like to start fementation with a Belgian yeast so that it has a good strong banana nose. I will finish with a champagne yeast, so I'm not particularly worried about alcohol tolerance.  Any suggestions? what temp will produce the most banana esthers? "
1126,Pitched unnecessary 2nd round of yeast - what will be the effects?,"First off, a bit of background:  This is my 3rd batch of homebrew so I am new to this. I'm using the following: Morgan's Golden Saaz Pilsner can of goo, Fermentis Saflager s-23 yeast and a brew booster (Dextrose, malt and corn syrup).  After 2 weeks there was still no bubbling in the airlock so I decided that the yeast must have died and I pitched a 2nd round of yeast and while doing so I noticed a thin rim of krausen on the side of the fermenter. 3 days later there is still no bubbling in the airlock.   I finally realized I should check the specific gravity and noticed it had gone from 1035 down to 1010.   My plan is to bottle a 6 pack and rack the rest off then see how the bottled brew turns out before investing the time in bottling the whole lot.  So, my question(s) is this:  What will the 2nd round of yeast do to this batch? Is it salvageable or should I not waste time with bottling? "
1127,Adding gypsum after fermentation,"I have found resources that both advocate and highly advise against this practice.  We recently brewed a IIPA (Bear Flavored's Heady Topper clone) that has 3lbs of hops, plus hop extract in 14 gallons.  We didn't add any gypsum to our 4ppm sulfate water.  I want to make this the best beer possible.  I tried adding untreated gypsum to a prior IIPA (in the glass) and wasn't thrilled with the results.    Questions:  -Why does adding gypsum to the strike water/mash differ from adding it to the glass, or to the beer post fermentation? -Would there be any way to mimic adding it to the mash after fermentation?  Maybe making a heavily gypsum-ized starter beer, fermenting it, and blending? -What about adding gypsum to boiling water, chilling and adding that to the beer?  Does boiling salts change the way they behave on the palette or diffuse into the beer? "
1128,Testing bitterness during boil,"Will be modifying a recipe and while I know the alpha % of the bittering hops and this being the first time I'm altering a recipe I'm wondering during the boiling process have I added enough bittering hops or do I need more.  Can I assume that 30 minutes into a 60 minute boil the wort should be twice as bitter at the end of the boil?  Lets say I haven't added enough bittering hops, what can I do? What if I've added to much?  I""m trying to find out if I can use any guidelines while the boil is going on.  The recipe is the northern brewer dead ringer (all-grain) with cascade hops (10% alpha). "
1129,Should I sanitize my keg posts every time I attach a quick disconnect?,Whenever I need to attach a disconnect to my kegs to take a sample I first spray the disconnect and post down with star san. After I have taken a sample and removed the disconnect I spray the post down one more time.   This is pretty tedious. Is this over kill? Will my beer survive to live another glorious tasty day if I skip this practice?   
1130,Forgot to add whirfloc / irish moss to wort during boil,"Brewing a fat tire clone, forgot to add whirfloc tablet / irish moss... I'm 5 days into primary fermentation.  What would everyone recommend? Add something, skip it, ???  Thanks "
1131,Should dry hopped beer be lightly stirred prior to bottling?,"I'm making an IPA and I'm going to be dry hopping it this weekend in the secondary fermentation phase. I've been thinking about the dry hopping process alot, mainly about the diffusion of the hoppiness throughout the beer during this phase. I plan on putting the pellets in a nylon sachet to keep them contained for easy removal, but by doing this is it possible that the beer immediately surrounding the sachet will be more hopped than the rest of it?  And should I stir it lightly in order to make sure there is more even hopping?  Also, how can I be sure the dry hopping won't contaminate my beer? "
1132,Raspberry Stout Contamination('infection')?,"  I brewed a 5-gallon batch of Frankenberry Chocolate Raspberry Stout July 20 (11 days ago) using a Scottish Ale Wyeast. The yeast was pitched at 78 degrees, everything was sanitary, I immediately placed the airlock on the plastic fermenter where it is now.  EXCEPT my husband didn't seal the lid on the primary, just had it sitting on there, closed, but not sealed. No activity in the airlock, small, white filmy bubbles.  Should I take a gravity reading? It smells very yeasty. I'm hoping it is just suspended yeast?   My last batch of this turned out great, no problem with fermentation.!I'm supposed to add raspberry puree at the 14 day mark. Didn't want the added expense if it's contaminated, though. Here is a picture:  "
1133,Using 5L oak barrel for beer,"I was recently given a 5L oak barrel from Oak Barrels Ltd. and I've never used such a thing before and have some basic questions.  The barrel came with a great little instruction guide which talks about basic barrel prep, sanitation, and storage (among other things). Also on their website they link to this article by Terry Terfinko from 1995 titled, Oak Barrel Experiment, which answers a lot of questions about beer making with barrels. However there are a few pieces of the puzzle missing:   5L (1.3 gal) vs 5 gal: I have 5 gallon batch equipment currently. Should I invest in some stuff like 1 gallon carboys and mini auto-siphons for smaller batches? Should I scale recipes which are for 5 gal down to smaller sizes by just dividing everything by 5?  The instruction guide mentions the idea of ""topping off"" the barrel from time to time. This is because of the Angel's share, that being the beer/wine/whiskey that evaporates during the aging process. So how do I do this with beer? Do I need to keep some extra beer around somewhere (refrigerated?) maybe in growlers or something? This may play into the answer to the first question about batch size. I've been doing extract brewing (with grain bags in there too) so far and don't have all grain equipment, I assume that won't be a problem. I guess the question is, will it (be a problem)? Any suggestions on kind of beer to make? I thought stuff like a Russian imperial stout or Scotch Ale or some other strong ale might be good. But most of those say to age for 6 months minimum and the guide suggests 4-6 weeks aging for the 5L barrel. Maybe just some basic brown ale for the first time, since they're usually pretty cheap and easy to make.   Thanks for taking the time to read this longer post. I'm excited to start trying this thing out but without answers to some of these questions, I'm a bit nervous about messing it up (I know, RDWHAHB). "
1134,Wine fermenting with fruit in it after a month,I have had a gallon of peach wine sitting in peach pulp for a little over a month. It is in a carboy with an airlock seal. Would it be okay to rack it and continue letting it age? Or did the continued presence of the fruit mess it up? 
1135,"Airlock started bubbling after racking into secondary and dryhopping, why?","I racked my IPA into a sanitized carboy onto the hops I'm using for dry hopping, the airlock had been still for about 2 day before the racking. But now its in the secondary the airlock started up again, almost faster than before. What's going on in there? I left it in primary for full week, why would it suddenly start releasing so much CO2 again? "
1136,Saving a yeast starter,I made a beer 2 weeks ago and had 2 liters of yeast starter I made for it. I used about 1.5 liters and saved the rest for later in a sanitized jar in the fridge. Is the starter still fine? Is there anything I need to do before using it again? 
1137,Too little sugar?,"It's my first time making cider and I believe I didn't put enough sugar in it. I put 1 1/2 brown sugar (Even though some fell off to the side cause I didn't dissolve it, like the twit I am). I would say that MAYBE a cup of brown sugar is in there. Regardless, I read that it may just make it drier but I wanted to know if this may effect the fermentation process. Also, I had to open it during the first few hours to drain some out cause it was about to pop the cap open (overfilled it, we're talking 1 gallon of pure apple juice here, plus sugar, plus the foam from the fermentation). I was worried it would cause an explosion, but even though it seems to be in control, I'm worried that I may have damaged the batch.  This is it 4 hours into the process (About an hour after I had to drain it): [website]And this is it 8 hours or so into the process: [website]What do y'all think? Is it off or ok? I'm thinking it may just be some bits from the process as I read but who knows. Also, there's a pile of sugar at the bottom of the jar, should I give the bottle a little shake or will that mess up the process and allow oxygen in?  Cheers, Adrian "
1138,Is a 12quart pot sufficient for a 1/2 5gal boil?,"I am just getting ready to do my first batch. I have all I need except a descent pot. I found a 12quart used stainless pot on Kijiji and was hoping it would be sufficient for half-boils of 5gal batches.  12 Quart is just a little over 3 gals, and I presume a half boil is 2.5gals. If I keep a close eye on the pot to prevent over-boils, would it do?  What are your thoughts? "
1139,Can you load less than 1.3 gallons into the Tap-A-Draft system?,I'm just starting out home brewing and I am planning on sticking with 1 gallon brews for a while. I want to purchase a Tap-a-Draft system but continue with 1 gallon batches for a while. Can you load less than the full volume of a Tap-a-Draft? Would the extra air volume cause any problems? 
1140,DIY BrewBug based offerings?,"BrewBug, is a neat little toy that essentially has a ""floating bob"" that measures the temperature and specific gravity of the wort as it is fermenting, allowing for niceties like changing the temperature based on the specific gravity, and just really nice plots of the temperature and specific gravity.  Has anyone tried to DIY something like this before?  I expect that the beer bug works by using a hollow bob with a temperature probe and measuring it's weight over time (with calibration).  But I'm not sure where to get the ""weight measuring"" device: a linear actuator?  A hook's law spring (changing weight to location) and then something to measure the position? "
1141,Would Yeast survive the temperatures of distillation and properly carbonate?,"Theoretically:  If one were to distill a beer at 172.3-211.9*F with the intention of throwing away the distillate, in order to produce non-(or low-)alcoholic beer, would the remaining beer contain enough viable yeast to carbonate bottles with the addition of priming sugar, or would additional yeast in low quantities be necessary for carbonation?  Secondary question (not necessary for the answer):  Should the yeast be of the same strain as the original yeast, or would a different kind be acceptable due to the fact that the beer has already been brewed and only carbonation is sought? "
1142,Building a kegerator from a wine fridge,"I am thinking of making a kegerator for 3 gallon pin lock corny kegs. Is there any issue with using a wine fridge to do this? I thought the size was right, as it can tuck away on my countertop and it has no freezer or shelves to get in the way. Has anyone done this before or has instructions on how to do this? How big of a fridge do I need for a 3 gallon keg and a 24 oz or 2.5 pound CO2 plus all the other equipment? "
1143,Pediococcus Infection--Will brett get rid of the ropiness?,"I'm pretty sure I have a pediococcus infection on a Kolsch that I brewed recently. Let's just say some stuff came up and my sanitation was not great.  I sampled it after about 6 weeks in primary at 55F, and it was really, really sour. Fortunately, I love sour beer, so it's probably the most delicious homebrew I've ever made--it tastes like lemonade (oops!).  I checked on it again recently after cold crashing and preparing to rack to a keg and it's developed (and probably had before) a thick ropiness below the surface, like a bunch of yeast ghosts are hanging out. Reading around suggests that is pediococcus (hence the sour), and that normally Brett is pitched with Pediococcus to clear up that ropiness. In my case, since I have no idea whether or not there's any Brett in there with the Pedio, should I repitch Brett to help it clear up the Pedio? Should I warm the beer back up? Any advice or links on that?  Thanks. I'll post a picture later if it's helpful.  "
1144,Can gelatin strip away aroma and flavor?,"I have an IPA fermenting that has close to 5oz of hops in it.  I've had success with using gelatin to clear up other beer styles (Cali Common, saison), but I am planning on dry-hopping this with another 3oz of hop cocktail.  As I don't want to waste those hops and/or strip away their lovely aromatics, would I be ill-advised to use gelatin on this batch?  What about cold-crashing for a few days at the end of dry-hopping? "
1145,Layering different varieties of hops at single intervals,"Brewed a IPA yesterday:  75% 2 row  5% crystal 20  5% crystal 40  10% melanoidin  5% table sugar  I was using Jamil's (Vinnie Cilurzo's? Tasty McD's?) IPA as a baseline recipe, which calls for something like the following:  1oz horizon 60 min  1oz centennial 20 min  1oz amarillo 10 min  1oz cascade 5 mi  1oz centennial FO  I had some Caliente's I wanted to use, but instead of using only one varietal at each addition, I blended each addition so it was more like the following:  20 min - .3oz centennial, .3 oz amarillo, .3oz caliente  10 min - .5oz cent, .5oz cascade, .5oz amarillo  etc. etc.   Does anyone know the benefits of this method? I was looking to get a more layered, complex hop profile particularly in the flavoring/aroma. FYI, I bittered with .75 oz magnum @ 60, with a 90 min boil. "
1146,"Looking to make an Ancient Egyptian brew, but what about bittering and flavoring?","I've done some research on wines and beers of Ancient Egypt and I've decided I want to try and brew a beer based on the ingredients that would have been available at the time. I don't want to make a Midas Touch (even though it's delicious) clone or any of that nonsense, but grapes are not out of the question as an addition.   I've found a few things that I was going to run with in my recipe, but I have a question about bittering and flavoring. It would seem that Ancient Egyptians didn't have access to hops, or didn't use them in their fermented beverages, but they did have things like Sage, Coriander, Rosemary and Juniper.  Have any of you used any of these ingredients (Sage, Coriander, Rosemary, Juniper) specifically for bittering and/or flavoring your beer? Do the quantities translate to the same quantity of hops?   If it helps, I'm planning on doing a small batch to start (probably 1 gallon). I'll continue to adjust and make changes with 1 gallon batches and upscale when I get something I like.   I'd be more than happy to share the recipe when I'm done with it. "
1147,Rescuing a weak lager fermentation,"I'm currently fermenting a spiced dark lager with an original gravity of 1.064. I began fermentation 2 weeks ago today with a White Labs 830 yeast that I made a starter with. The yeast was a bit old, so I wanted to make sure the starter was going well before I pitched it into the wort. However, this was my first starter (and lager for that matter), so I may not have produced a large enough yeast batch. Fermentation did start vigorously within about 12 hours after pitching.  A couple of days ago, all signs of fermentation have slowed dramatically. The airlock passes a bubble maybe once every 5 minutes. Taking a specific gravity reading shows a steady level of 1.0333 which gives an attenuation of only about 40-45%. The primary fermentation stage for this recipe called for 4 weeks at 50F, so I'm still 2 weeks before that. At this point I'm thinking I didn't have a large enough yeast starter made.  I've got a packet of Salflager w-34/70 yeast which is similar to WLP830, so I was thinking of racking to the second fermenter and pitching this dry yeast.  What's the right thing to do at this point? Just be patient? "
1148,Will bottling by pouring negatively impact the flavor of my beer?,"This is my second homebrew.  I used a friend's siphoning equipment and bottle filler for my first batch, then got my own.    This second batch is a pumpkin spice porter.  It fermented for a week, and I racked to a carboy second vessel for a week.  When I was ready to bottle, I racked it to a bottling bucket with priming sugar, and then found out that the siphon hose did not fit my bottle filler.    So, I slowly used a sanitized, glass measuring cup, and would slowly put it into the beer in the bottling bucket, lift, and slowly pour beer into each bottle.  I tried to keep down oxygenation.    Has anyone else ever bottled this way?  If I drink soon, and not months from now, will I be ok?  How soon after bottling does oxygenation appear as a flaw in the beer? "
1149,Green wood in beer,"I was wondering if I can make some post-christmas beer out of the christmas tree (Norway Spruce).  So my question is, does wood have to be dried in order to use it for flavoring or can I use green wood?  When should I add the wood in this case?  I was thinking to make a IPA with ""piney"" hops. (probably simcoe) "
1150,Off flavor of kegged Wheat beer,I brewed an AG wheat beer and used WLP351 as the yeast for this. Let it sit in the primary for near two weeks (66°F/19°C) and I did do a secondary on it for about another weak to try and decrease the sulfur smell. The sulfur seemed to have been gone so I kegged and force carbed/cold crashed for a week. Pour a glass and it now has a very overpowering yeasty/sulfur smell at the nose of the beer but finishes great. Any ideas on how to get rid of this? I have been venting off the keg that has not seemed to help at all. Thinking about removing it and let it come up to 70F and letting it sit for a week then try again? Thanks! 
1151,Mead and the balloon,"When my husband gets up in the morning, the balloons are deflated. When I get up 3 hrs later, the balloons are inflated. They stay inflated all day. It has been more than 3 weeks. Is the mead ready to rack? How do we know? "
1152,cider with brett?,"Got a great deal ($! per) on half gallon jugs of Ryan's cider. I bought everything the store had (7 gallons of ""spiced"" cider and 3 gallons of standard cider). I plan on making three batches with this, one 3.5 gallon spiced cider on 100% Brett Bruxellensis (WLP650), 3.5 gallons spiced cider on Lalvin D47 (dry wine yeast), and the last 3 gallons of regular cider on the same D47 yeast.   So here is the questions: -has anyone fermented ""spiced"" cider as opposed to the standard cider before? -Is there any recommendations or experience using brett in a cider, yeast nutrients? Ferm temp? Ferm length? whats to be expected? -Also what about the wine yeast I selected, has anyone used any wine yeast fermenting cider? Ferm suggestions? Ferm temp?  Thanks everybody in advance, I will most likely be going ahead with my fermentations in the morning (12-15-12) but still curios, if not for information, or next time, what everyone thinks or knows? "
1153,Can marmite be made from brew yeast leftovers?,If you don't know what marmite is you can stop reading now.  A friend of a friend reckons you can make marmite from the yeast leftovers of your brew. Does anyone know how to do this? Any one have a recipe? 
1154,Is Oxiclean Free OK to use on a metal brewpot,Is it safe to use Oxiclean Free on a metal brew pot? I know that rinsing thoroughly is required after using Oxiclean Free. Is it safe to let the brew pot sit in an Oxiclean Free solution overnight? 
1155,White mold on my corney kegs?,"I've got a basic beer serving fridge out in the garage, just a few taps on the front and some bottles on the door. I'm developing a problem with what looks kinda like mold, I notice it mostly on the black rubberish top area but some on the stainless as well. It looks like it was peppered with a bunch of little tiny snowballs, white round and spread pretty evenly with some areas more concentrated then others. The mold substance isn't on anything else in the fridge; not on the walls or the bottles or on the door beer/gas lines... I have heard of people developing a mold on the ceiling of their sour cellars and it sounds like a ""good"" thing?  What's going on? What is it? How do I get rid of it?  Fridge temp: mid 30's  It has been going on for about 2-3 months. "
1156,Is there a way to protect beer from freezing in a garage with no electricity,"I would like to run a few brews back-to-back to build up a stock of beer. However, I would not be able to store all of the bottles in my house and would be forced to place them in the garage. My garage does not have any electricity and therefore no heating.   Do I need to protect my beer from freezing if the temperature gets to about -10°C (14°F)? And if so, what is the way to do this? Preferably without going out and buying a paraffin heater. "
1157,Carbonating using table sugar,"I have an IPA that is ready to bottle.  I don't have any carbonation drops, so I'm considering using table sugar.  Apparently 250grams for the 60 bottles of beer in the tub is about right (equivalent to the drops)   How should I add it? Can iI mix it in with some water and open the fermentation tub and pour it in right before i bottle it?  That would save dolloping it in to each bottle.  Is that the way to go?  "
1158,keeping the wort pump primed seems to have a learning curve,"So, I bought myself a pump and a chillizilla-type chiller and a chugger pump for christmas...thanks for the christmas bonus, Boss...also, silicone tubing and stainless fittings and such to make it work.  After I had everything plumbed in the basement to make sure that things were where they needed to be, I could run the pump full bore and get LOTS of water coming thru the outlet tube back into the pot. All was well, I thought.  Yesterday, when I brewed with the new toys for the first time, I had to throttle the flow back to a trickle to keep from losing my prime coming out of the kettle.  After I got done, I cleaned the system and ran PBW thru it again and it was back to running full stream.  So is the problem the sugar water being thicker than water or the heat? Or is there something else I'm missing? "
1159,Cider molding and wont go away but not getting worse?,"I have three ciders going, two ""spiced"" ciders and one regular/standard whatever the straight apple squeezed cider (""Ryan's"" brand if anyone is familiar) is called. This is my first attempt at cider, didn't do much research just got a great deal on cider.  QUESTION:  Is my cider done for? can I rack it off the mold? is it safe to drink? what can I do?  HERE'S THE SIMPLE STORY:  The cider was on sale because it was close to ""sell by"" date but not expired yet, when I opened the half gallon jugs a couple of them had small chunks of mold on them. Because I had high hopes I just picked out the mold and dumped it in assuming the yeast would kick out some alcohol and protect it from any mold.  DETAILS:  Well I would be writing if that were the case, one started molding right away (""spiced"" on Lalvin D47 (Dry wine yeast)) o.g. was 1.052 and currently is 1.002, smells very moldy but looks very clear. when poured into graduated cylinder it appeared to be carbonated I would say around 3 volumes (yes airlock was used). the mold covers about half surface area, and is thin and white (Thicker and white then a Pellicle) The second was a non-""spiced"" on the same yeast, and it only has what I would describe as a pre-mold coagulated chunk 1"" by 3"" (very small in comparison) o.g. was 1.056 now is 1.002. small hint of mold smell but mostly spice cider smell. The third is a ""spiced"" cider on 100% Brett B, this one was the last to mold but has a slightly thicker mold and also blue and white and covers an area about 2"" by 2"". This one also cleared out very well but has zero attenuation, started at 1.052 and is currently the same.  FERMENTATION: (all three fermented in the same conditions and in glass) started fermentation around the low 60's for about two weeks then moved into an area 68-70 deg for the remaining week and a half. "
1160,"House's furnace died while fermenting, what should I do?","I'm doing my first homebrew (using this kit), and started fermentation 6 days ago. I've kept it in my basement, which is usually around 66F. The kit's instructions just tell me to let it ferment in a dark place for 2 weeks.  Yesterday my furnace went out, and the temperature's dropped to about 55F. Is this going to affect the brew? If it drops to the low 50s for the next couple days, will it ruin the batch?  I could move the carboy to a friend's apartment where it's warmer, but will moving it be worse than letting it get cooler? "
1161,First Brew: Yellow Mold - Transfer to Carboy - Slowing of Fermentation,"I brewed a batch of Pale (first solo brew) and after pitching yeast (6 hours), noticed yellow clusters of what I think was mold.  I thought I had an infection, so I siphoned off, and collected supernatant in clean carboy (trying hard not to interrupt the surface where most of the visible yellow clusters were).  Fermentation ramped up and was vigorous all day yesterday (brewed on Sunday) but a day later, today, I noticed visibly that it slowed.  Now, I know fermentation is still going because I see bubbles, but what could be gong on here?  I've seen other beers rage for 2-3 days before slowing like this...  New to brewing so I haven't really seen anything like this.  Good news is that I no longer see any yellow.  Not sure how I contaminated the beer, or if was even me...  Probably was, but that's not really important:  I will try even harder next time to be clean.  What I'm getting at is can mold cause slowing of fermentation and if so, what should I do - wait?  Anything else I should keep in mind?  Will it taste funny when done, etc? "
1162,How to affect the color of head,Is there a particular way to manipulate a grain bill to change the color of the head of a beer?  Ie if you want an off-white head in an RIS as opposed to a brown head? 
1163,What is the recommended procedure for bottling given this setup?,"I'm a beginner. This is my second batch (and the first made from my own recipe idea). The equipment I have is the standard starter kit, made up of two large plastic buckets with spigots near the bottom of each one.  Last batch, I lost a huge amount of beer due to poor siphoning from fermenting bucket to bottling bucket. I wonder if siphoning was necessary at all! Palmer's book says that the spigots are good enough to use instead of siphoning.  How would you recommend transferring the fermented beer into the bottling bucket? If I use the spigot, how can I be sure that it is mounted high enough above the yeast cake, so as not to transfer unwanted yeast by-products into my bottling bucket? "
1164,Using hops after fermentation,"Let's say you have already put your beer into your fermenter and you decide its taste is not hoppy enough. So you start out to add some more hops into it. One way to dry hop, but I will not expand concerning it. The method I would like to discuss is boiling your hops in a small amount of water, waiting for it to reach room temperature and then pour your ""tea"" into your second fermenter before you close it. The question is: how good are the results of this? Do the same boiling rules for hops appear here too (ie, 60 minutes for bitterness, 30 for flavour or 15 for aroma)? "
1165,What would cause yeast to fail to flocculate?,"I am using WLP002 - English Ale Yeast - in my current batch, a Young's double chocolate clone.  According to the manufacturer's product page, this yeast is highly flocculant.  The beer remained in the primary for 15 days.  After this time, the gravity had fallen from an OG of 1.070 to 1.021.  This is a 70% apparent attenuation, which is the top end of the expected range for this yeast.  There was a lot of yeast still floating on top of the beer, but I racked to the secondary anyway.  Here is a picture of the secondary after three days.  That is yeast on top.  Last night, after two weeks in the secondary I used a small spoon to pull a bunch of this out and verified by smell that it is definitely yeast.  I also took another gravity reading and found that it fell from 1.021 to 1.018 in the secondary.  I now have an apparent attenuation of 74.2%, kind of high for this yeast.  Yet, the yeast remains atop the beer.  Why is the yeast not flocculating?  Might it be that the high amuont of lactose (12 oz.) and/or cocoa powder (6 oz.) in the beer is making the beer more dense than the yeast?  I'd like to see this yeast fall to the bottom before I bottle, else it will end up slurrying the beer. "
1166,Using honey in beer,"This thread is not actually one single question, but a number of different ones.   When calculating sugars used in the wort, how much sugar does honey contain? Is it closer to dry malt extracts, raw cane sugar, dextrose? When is it better to use it? Boiling time? Second fermentation? How intense is the flavor it leaves in the beer? What if you use honey with herb aroma? Is there a maximum quantity of honey you should use so that it does not cover the primary flavors of your beer? Do honey sugars create ""sharp notes"" in your beer, and thus ""bad"" alcohol? Is it worth using it prior to bottling for CO2?  "
1167,Dual Faucet Kegerator and kegs,"I am looking for a good dual faucet kegerator for home brewing. I brew in the normal 5.5 gallon batches. I am wanting to move away from bottling and into kegging, and I really want to be able to do two kegs so I can keep a cycle going.  Does anyone have any suggestions on what brand or unit to buy (hopefully somewhere around the [tex]700 range). Do I need to buy one more expensive than that? Is it better to try and find them locally? Are the prices on beverage factory pretty reasonable?  I also wanted to know where to find good deals on 5 gallon kegs that would go in the dual faucet kegerator as well? "
1168,Help With Hops...,"I generally understand the grain side of things, but I can't get my head around hops. Given the variety and choice, how do you go about selecting what hops to use and how much of each hop...? Are there any resources online that delve into how to build the hop profile for a beer...?  cheers,  Bob. "
1169,What about opened LME cans?,"Most LME come in 3 pound cans, which is a quite large quantity if you want to add just a little to your wort, just one pound for example. It's a shame to throw away the rest. If I open a LME can and do not want to use the whole amount of lme, can I save the rest for later, even in a refrigerator? After all, it already contains water so it doesn't have the hydration problems of DME, and, furthermore, whatever the time i decide to use it, I will boil it for sanitation first. What do you think? "
1170,Is it important to weigh down a hop bag for dry-hopping?,"If so, what kind of weight should I use? Should it be enough to sink the bag to the bottom of the carboy? "
1171,"Using Grolsch ""Premium Lager"" bottles for bottling","In my first bottling, I decided I wanted to try using half normal reused glass bottles with new bottle caps and half reused Grolsch beer bottles.  Probably the worst part of the process was having to drink the Grolsch beers. They are horrible and half of them were skunky (could it be because of the green bottle versus brown?), and the other half just weren't good at all. What I noticed was that all of the normal bottles that I cleaned and sanitized tasted fine, but the Grolsch bottles tasted skunky, but only at the top of the bottle. Once I had been drinking a little bit further into the bottle, the skunkiness went away. Before I bottled it, it was hard to make sure the cap was fully sanitized. I closed the bottle with the sanitizer in it, and tipped the sanitized solution toward the cap.  Has anyone else noticed this problem with using Grolsch beer bottles? Are they just not a very good bottle to use? I think after my experience, I would not recommend them. "
1172,Massively Over-Carbonated Beer...What Do I Do?,"Okay, so I made a mental error tonight when I was bottling and put 5 gallons worth of dried malt extract into 2 gallons of wort. I didn't realize the mistake until I had everything bottled. So now what do I do? Do I have to worry about the beers exploding? If not, when I think they're ready to be opened, if I chill them down quite a bit will I be alright opening them?  Such a dumb move. I thought maybe it was just under-attenuated, but then I realized my mistake.  Any help would be greatly appreciated. "
1173,Crushing malt without a mill,What's the best way to crush malt if you don't have a mill at home? How much malt would you venture to crush that way? 
1174,What is attentuation?,What is attentuation? How does it effect beer flavor and quality? How is is calculated and why do I need to know it? 
1175,Continental Pilsner Malt,"What does the term ""continental"" mean when referring to malts? I have seen that term used before, mainly when sourcing pilsner malt. Is it just a different way of saying pilsner malt that has been grown and malted in Europe? Maybe I am way off base.  I can get domestic Pilsner malt, so I assume ""continental"" means not domestic. "
1176,How long does 5lb of C02 last you?,"I can never get a grip on how often I'll need to refill my C02. Sometimes it seems to last forever other times it seems very quick.  In general, if you are just using C02 to pour, how many soda kegs can you get through on the same tank?  How many kegs do you get if you are also force carbonating? "
1177,Using Granular Yeast in a Lager,"Will dry yeast do any good when brewing a lager or is it necessary that you use a liquid one? I am talking about making some kind of starter with the yeast, not just pitching it into the fermenter. How much difference in flavor does it make? Do dry yeasts make a descent lagering? "
1178,moving a better bottle carboy,"So, just out of curiosity... if I wanted / needed to relocate my primary fermentation carboy to another area of the house, what would be the safest way to do this, without risk of infection?   I know that picking the better bottle carboys up can cause the water in the fermentation lock to get sucked into the carboy, so would it make sense to just remove the airlock temporarily, cap the carboy with foil or something, move it, and then replace the fermentation lock? "
1179,Boiling off the methanol for freeze distillation,"I would like to freeze distill some hard cider I've brewed to up the gravity.  However, it is well known that freeze distillation concentrates the methanol present in the booze.  My question is, since methanol is the ""first"" thing that boils off during regular distillation; can I boil my cider for just a very short time to remove the methanol, cool it down, then proceed with freeze distillation?  If so, what would be the best way to go about it without losing all of my ethanol? "
1180,Refermentation with fruits and sugar,"I recently brewed a wheat beer that is now in primary fermentation.  I planned on using yuzu juice after primary to give a special taste.   Also, after some thought I wanted to add a little ABV (from 3.6 to around 4%) to the beer because for now I think it is too light.   My question is :    Do you think I can add some blond DME (around 400g) at the same time as the fruit juice (yuzu) when I transfert my wort to a second carboy? (my wort is 21L) For sure I will have a refermentation, but will there be enough yeast left to conduct it? (my pitch rate for primary was 0.75) Will I have enough yeast after some weeks when priming for bottling?   "
1181,How to check that yeast is still good?,I have an older packet of yeast that has been stored in the refridgerator past the best by date on the package. Is it still okay to use the yeast? Is there a way to test to make sure it's alive still?  
1182,Aging mead in a wood mini barrel,"I just got this cheap wood barrel that was suppose to be for aging whiskey.   I want to age my mead in the wood mini barrel. What is the best practice for doing so considering the mini barrel shown above? I have read that I should fill it, then check on it many times to refill it from some mead getting absorbed by the wood. Is there a high risk of infection?  My mead just for documentation:  "
1183,Adding fruit to beer,I'd like to give orange flavor and smell to my batch. When do you think is the best time to add it? Is it best to add orange while the wort is boiling or add it to primary fermentation? Thank you for your advices. 
1184,Adding priming sugar to lagering secondary,"A few weeks ago, I brewed a Belgian double, its done fermenting and ready for the next step. I've noticed that the beer is still very cloudy so I prefer a cold-crash/lagering period before bottling first.  Now the 'problem': I don't want to transfer the beer twice ( primary -> sec -> bottling ) because of the increased risk of contamination, but also the extra work and time involved. I've cold crashed in the primary before, but once the beer is transferred afterwards, some trub and yeast still comes along and the beer would still be hazy.   So I thought, why not add the priming sugar to the secondary, let it cold crash with the sugar and then bottle?   My theory is that the yeast would not be active at the close to freezing point temperatures. After bottling the beer warms up and the sugars get fermented. I would let the beer already cool down in the primary, so once it is combined with the sugar it is is already cool.   Any thoughts or experience on this method? "
1185,How should I determine a ratio between malts?,"I am new to the home brewing community and have a question regarding some malts I am using on my next batch.  After using a few beer kits from Brewers Best, I am taking a spin at trying to gather my own ingredients to brew.  I have:   1 pound of Briess Pilsen DME 1 pound of Briess Bavarian Wheat DME 1 pound of Briess Carapils crushed malt 1 ounce of German Hallertau hop pellets  Safale US-05 Ale Yeast   Additional items:   Muslin mesh bag  Priming sugar   My concern is how do I ratio my usage of Bavarian Wheat DME and Pilsen DME? Should I even mix those two DME and choose one and mix it with a rice syrup solid instead?  I'm going for a crisp tasting ale with body and not too over powering with the hops. "
1186,Should we stir the brew?,"I m a beginner in wine making, kindly suggest should we stir the brew? If yes, after how many days?  Should I stir or shake the brew every day or after how many days I should open the container and stir? "
1187,Conditioning and storing beer at temperatures around -5°C,"I am bottle-conditioning and storing beer in a storage room with temperatures reaching as low as -5°C (significantly below the freezing temperature of water). There are few sudden changes in temperature, and the beer itself does not seem to freeze inside the bottles. Already-carbonated beer that has been left there as the temperature have fallen tastes fine, but I am curious however as to what impact these kind of temperatures have on the beer - especially since I now want to bottle-condition some freshly brewed beer.    Will the yeast survive below-zero temperatures? What eventual effects might below-zero storage have on the yeast if it recovers? Would there be a difference when it comes to the type of yeast (e.g. top vs bottom fermenters etc.), or is this irrelevant at these temperatures? Will maturation be harmed, and in what way? Will the beer be affected by below-zero storage in other ways?   Looking forward to your comments and answers.  "
1188,Brewing with chili pepper,"I would like to have a hot peppered ale from extract batch. I won't be able to make an all grain, what style do you recommend? How should I add the peppers, in secondary or primary, or into the bottle? "
1189,"Kombucha has dark, green grey dust/moss inside liquid","Some of my kombuchas form a strange, greenish-grey powdery substance inside them. This looks like moss or dust, and appears embedded in the transparent matrices of strands inside the liquid, although many of them sediment to the bottom as well. This substance is exclusively inside the kombucha liquid, given that the rule of thumb is that ""mold grows on top only"", I assume it's not mold. I have also tasted this kombucha before and it tasted ok, I didn't get sick or otherwise impaired.  I tried washing the green strands off the SCOBY (they were hanging from the underside of the baby/daughter). But the next batch still developed the same growth.  Kombucha Kamp has a picture very similar to my issue. They claim it is not mold, but ""tendrils of yeast"".  If this is yeast, how come it's so dark in color? I thought yeast had a yellowish-white color. What are they? Are they dangerous? Are they bad? Can you stop them? Why don't all my kombuchas have it?  I can post a photo if anyone is interested, but it would look practically identical to Kombucha Kamp's photo. "
1190,How much yeast can I reuse from the last fermentation?,I have a yeast on the trub from my 5 gallon batch fermentation. I want to reuse it for my next batches.   Is that ok if I add all of this yeast to my next batch?  Or is there any proportion I should follow? 
1191,How is peanut butter flavor added to beer?,"I've encountered several commercial beers with peanut butter flavor and I'm interested in making something similar but I'm not 100% sure how to go about it.  I've seen reference to peanut butter powder but I'm not sure if this is the recommended way to do it or, even if it is, if there are other methods worth considering.  How to commercial and home brewers generally add peanut butter flavor to beer and what other prominent options exist?  Is there a straightforward way to process peanuts at home to add them to beer? "
1192,"Same wine, different taste","Have you experienced the feeling that you open a bottle of your homemade wine and it seems to be a different wine from other bottles of the same batch? I have noticed the difference from one day to the following, so it is not a matter of aging. I know that wine flavor may depend on the context, for example, what you are eating or what you have eaten, but I have noticed big differences in the wood tannins presence, for example. Any explanation or it´s just me? "
1193,Can I use yeast from a bottle of beer?,"I just made a nice pot full of wort with expensive malt and hops. I pitched the yeast and two days later, no action. I'm pretty sure the yeast is dead, expired, no good. There is no brewing supply near me and the online stores require minimum purchases, minimum S&amp;H and are a week away. Yikes! Can I buy a bottle of beer where the final fermentation was done in the bottle and use the sediment? If so, what's a good brand for that?  "
1194,Use of green tea to flavor beer,"I'm considering using some green tea to flavor my last batch of yuzu-wit beer. I was wondering if anyone ever used tea for this purpose.  My first idea is to put the tea in a hop sac with some weight to make in sink and to put it in secondary fermentation for 2-4 days just before bottling.  How does that sound ?  Also, i'm worried about contamination from the tea, should I freeze the tea ? sink in vodka (wouldnt that make it loose its flavors ?) ? or just pitch it and hope ?  Thanks :) "
1195,How to quantify tannin level in red wine?,I just tasted a wine that has much silkier tannins than I've ever tasted before.  Is there a way to quantify the 'silkiness' of tannins in that wine vs another?  Is it the average length of the tannin molecule? Would I need a gas chromatography mass spectrometer or some kind of fancy piece of equipment?  How can I measure tannins? 
1196,Effect of ambient temperature on mashing pot,"I've been wondering for a while, and not least now that I've found a post here about how to solve my calibration issues on the Sestos S1D PID, whether the ambient temperature surrounding the mashing container will effect the container in such a way that I may need to recalibrate depending on season?  I live in Iceland and I usually brew on my balconies. This means that I'll be brewing in temperatures ranging from -5°C to maybe +15°C. I have a 50 liter steel pot and a 5500 W element. I usually mash with around 35 liters in the pot, excluding grains.  To formulate my question specifically: Would a 20°C difference in ambient temperature significantly alter the mashing temperature or would the PID be able to keep it under control? "
1197,"Would this grain bill make ""true"" Irish Red Ale?","I have a problem. I've read BJCP description of Irish Red Ale, and many recipes and... they don't quite match. Some recipes use crystal malt. Some does not. Most use roasted barley. Some do not. Many use monachium malt. Many do not. And I feel lost.  How about this grain bill?   3kg Pale Ale 1kg monach 2 500g CaraRed 150g roasted barley / black malt   Is this honest to the style? And, if hopped and fermented properly, would it taste like one?  By Brewtarget, it looks like OG, FG, ABV, IBU and color in EBC would be in style, but that's not the most important part. Would it be red? And would it taste properly? "
1198,Steep caramel malt in all grain brew?,"Are there any situations when this would be needed, or make any sense?   Steeping base malts usually makes no sense at all, and changes to taste made by steeping black malt or roasted barley instead of mashing it are obvious. But what about crystal / cara? Always just dump it to my mash tun?  "
1199,No fermentation after 3 weeks,"About 3 weeks ago I brewed my very first beer, a simple lager. I checked on the beer after 1 week of fermentation and now again after a bit over 3 weeks. At both times the density of the beer didn't really change. I think that no fermentation took place but I am not sure how to tell. Here is a photo of the beer [website]I used about 7g of dry Safbrew T-58 yeast for roughly 5l and I still have about 6g left. The temperature of the room is about 15-19 degrees and it's quite dark.  Can I still activate the yeast or should I add some yeast? Is there any way to save the beer? "
1200,Mashing vessel inside oven to avoid heat loss,"I just saw a YouTube video where since guy puts the mashing tun - a pot in this case - in the oven to help with heat loss.  I believe he didn't heat it, but world heating the oven to around mash temperature would help? Is this a common technique for small batch brewing?  "
1201,How to bottle Hard Cider,"I made hard cider this way: [website]except I also added cranberries, a couple tablespoons of sugar, and cinnamon. I was wondering after how long it will be done and if, when, and how I should bottle it. Thanks in advance! "
1202,What are the guidelines to store beer ingredients?,"I am new to the homebrewing world. In this moment I have just brewed using prepared kits (I use Brooklyn Brew Shop kits). However, I am considering trying new recipes and therefore buying the ingredients separately. As many of them come in larger quantities that I need, I was wondering   What are the optimal ways to store them? (for all of them: malt, hops and yeast). For how long will they last?   Or otherwise, do you know any online shop (I live in the UK) that allows me to buy just the amount I need for my batch? "
1203,Yeast and flower for raspberries and rye beer,"I'm thinking about making a rye/raspberries mixed beer in a 3:1 d water (basified with Mg(OH)2 to PH 6.5)/glucose ~0.1% some flower smoke (not sure what flower yet).  What yeast should I use to get a even more powerful nut/flower/fruit taste from this mixture and get a ~7% alcool percentage? Also what flower should I burn?   My idea is to mix ~200g powdered rye in basified water and cook at 80ºC for 1h, (at room temperature) add ~30% raspberries until it forms a homogeneous solution (keeping PH), add the yeast then let the smoke sit above the liquid as soon as the fermentation ends, filter it, add agar-agar and finally filter again. "
1204,Stuck Kvass fermentation?,"So I was making kvass, and have decided to make it a little more alcoholic. I made it using the following recipe:  Slightly burn 3 pieces of toast, add to boiled water, and 1.5 handfulls of raisins.  Wait 8 hours  add active dry yeast, .5 cups regular sugar, .5 cups brown sugar. Mix everything. Put in new bottle and use baloon as airlock. It has been in airlock since yesterday.  I'm kind of surprised that the baloon isn't filled up a little more. Also, how long should I keep it in this stage? How and how long should I bottle it?  "
1205,I'm worried about adding germs to my brew when dry hopping,"I'm looking at these instructions - [website]In section 13, it says something along the lines of ""Add the hops after 10 days ... the hops are added by placing the tea bag into a cup of boiling water...then add the contents of the cup including the tea bags to the fermenter.""  Now my primary fermentation vessel has a handy tap on the side so I never take the lid off to check gravity during my brews. I'll have to break the rules for these instructions which means air and germs will get into the wort. How much of a risk is this? How can I minimise the contamination? Why do we even have air locks if we are in the habit of removing bucket lids during fermentation?  I'm still a bit new to this but this basic question has always vexed me. "
1206,"Why are some of my batches too sweet in the bottle, and can I rescue them?","I've had pretty good success brewing kits generally, but towards the end of last year I went on a mission brewing a few batches in fairly rapid succession.  Unfortunately for me, most of the resultant brews have come out too sweet and slightly flat in the bottle.  They all seemed to ferment out completely (as measured by hydrometer).  This has happened to:   Woodfordes Admiral's Reserve, brewed in October '15, bottled in November Young's American Pale Ale, brewed in Oct '15, bottled in November Brewferm Diablo, brewed in Aug '15, bottled in October Brewferm Triple, brewed in Jun '15, bottled end July   At the same time I've had some brews behave perfectly - St Peters Ruby Red Ale (Dec), Woodfordes Nog (Sep), Brewferm Abdij (May), Better Brew Czech Pilsner (Aug), and another Young's American Pale Ale (June).  I've previously brewed the Admiral's Reserve with no problems too.  I think what might be happening is the newly-filled bottles might be being stored too cold to allow proper bottle conditioning.  Our house is quite cold in the winter months (my wife doesn't put the heating on unless it's about 16 deg C indoors) and most of the failures were in the Oct - Dec bottling timeframe.  I just put the bottles high in the conservatory thinking it would be warm there, but actually it's not really.  I wondered if this might be the case and put the Ruby Red Ale into the cupboard as below a day after I'd bottled it, and it's mostly okay.  I tried to rescue the Admiral's Reserve and the American Pale Ale by bringing them into a warm place for a while (cupboard with fan heater, kept at approx 21 deg C).  However no joy - I wonder if the yeast had given up the ghost by then.  Can I rescue these brews?  Possibly by venting, bringing up to a warm temperature and adding some fresh yeast?  My wife quite likes the sweet Triple so I'm not too worried about that, and probably the Diablo as it's very similar.  Full notes from the failed brews are below (sorry for the long post!):    Woodfordes Admiral's Reserve  10 Oct 15 Brewed as per instructions to 18 litres. Starting gravity 1.052.  On floor of the conservatory with heat belt, temperature over fermentation between 22 and 24.  23 Oct 15 Checked SG - was 1.012.  Still a few bubbles.  27 Oct 15 Checked SG - was still 1.012.  Still the odd bubble as well.  Racked to secondary which also bubbled.  Notes from last time said it was still bubbling slightly after 4 weeks but SG had got down to 1.005!  06 Nov 15 SG now 1.010, so 5.5% abv (5.7% with priming sugar).  Bottled with 75g of sugar into 31 500ml bottles, put at top of conservatory to condition.  21 Nov Bottles pretty cold in conservatory so taken to airing cupboard with fan heater, held at approx 21 degrees.  Young's American Pale Ale  27 Oct 15 Brewed short to 20 litres instead of 23, SG was 1.060ish.  Put vessel on floor of conservatory with heat belt.  09 Nov 15 Vessel still bubbling.  Have twice tapped on the lid to displace water droplets which fall back into the wort and seem to kick things off again.  10 Nov 15 Measured SG at 1.004! That gives a current ABV of 7.4%! Added hops as it has pretty much stopped bubbling.  12 Nov 15 Transferred to secondary.  17 Nov SG probably 1.005 actually.  Is about 7.4% including priming sugar. Batch primed with 90g of the sugar (100g was supplied but I'd brewed short) into 29 500ml bottles and 9 330ml bottles.  21 Nov Bottles pretty cold in conservatory so taken to airing cupboard with fan heater, held at approx 21 degrees.  Brewferm Triple  1 Jun 2015 (or 4 Jun) Two kits brewed full to 18 litres with 1kg of light dry malt extract.  OG not taken.  27 Jun (approx) Tested, still at 1.020.  Gave a good stir.  15 Jul Stuck at 1.020 so added Belgian ale yeast (Mangrove Jacks M27 Belgian Ale Yeast). Airlock activity by the end of the evening.  More airlock activity the next day, looks like it might have restarted.  29 Jul Gravity down to 1.011 - 1.012 so transferred to bottling bucket.  Temperature was 18 degrees.  Was a bit left over on the trub but tried to keep yeast out of the beer.  Beer was a bit cloudy, but not excessive.  Bottled into 30 33cl Duvel-style bottles, 8 33cl Leffe bottles and 7 50cl bottles (one half full).  Primed as per instructions with 7g of sugar per litre, so 100g for 15 litres indicated (all that was remaining after testing and leaving some on the trub).  I wonder if this might be too much sugar?  Brewferm Diablo  06 Aug Two kits brewed full to 18 litres with 1kg of light dry malt extract.  Starting temperature 26 degrees, OG 1.073ish, not easy to tell as head very full even in testing tube.  Airlock bubbling the next morning.  17 Sep (ish) Gravity still at 1.020 so added Mangrove Jacks M27 Belgian Ale yeast.  Noted temperature was down at about 17 or 18 degrees C so put on brewbelt.  Next evening it was bubbling again and up at about 25 degrees, so brewbelt loosened a bit.  02 Oct Transferred to secondary.  Gravity 1.012ish.  07 Oct Primed with 112g demerara sugar into 48 330ml bottles. FG 1.012, so 8% (8.2% with priming sugar).  Up on to conservatory shelf to warm condition, although it's pretty cold inside at the moment. "
1207,What is this husk-like material in allegedly de-husked Carafa 3 Special?,"I'm brewing Black IPA. So I needed less bitter black malt. My choice was Carafa III Special - it is supposed to be de-husked kind. But it looks like this:   Brighter shot, close-up on thing that made me wonder:   What is it? It looks kinda like husk pieces. But there should be no husk pieces in this malt. Does this malt always look like that, and what part of grain actually forms these flakes? Or maybe shopkeeper just made a mistake, as he weights and packs malts on demand. "
1208,What to do with not so de-husked Carafa 3 when brewing black AIPA?,"I bought what was supposed to be Carafa 3 special. But it has a lot of husk. I don't want roasted bitterness and acridicity in this brew. What should I do?  Today is the brew day and I needed to go with what I had. So I steeped 400g (grounded to about 200-300 microns) in cold water all night. Today I used 150 microns filtering bag and discarded solids. Resulting liquid is thick, black, opaque and hardly bitter. I was planning to add it at the end of mash, to convert leftovers, if any, and to filter it with the rest of my wort. But now, when I know there was husk in it, I doubt if it is the best plan. Should I rather pour it into filtering tun? Or add at the end of the boil?  "
1209,What happens if fermentation happens at wrong temperature?,What will happen with my beer if fermentation takes place either at a too hot or too cold temperature? What will be the effects on the flavour? 
1210,Can big late hop addition hurt AIPA?,"I made two mistakes at the beginning of the boil, and I under-bittered my beer by 20 IBU. This is AIPA, so underbittering is serious mistake. Sadly, i only realized that by putting my notes back into Brewtarget at 15 minutes til the end of boil. I recovered using 35g Citra and 35g Mosaic at 10'. 26 liters ≈ 6.8 gallons batch. It got me bitterness I wanted (70 IBU in theory, and wort tastes just right). But my 20' addition was already there. I also still added 30g of Cascade at 0', for aroma. Didn't quite have a time to think it thorough, so, well... And I still plan to dry hop.  Is there something like ""too hoppy"" Black AIPA? And if it is, have I crossed the line already, or can I still hope for it to be ""in style""? "
1211,Hard cider funky taste,"I made hard cider this way: [website]except I also added cranberries, a couple tablespoons of sugar, and cinnamon. And yes, I used Fleischmann's rapid rise yeast. Today, after 2 weeks my airlock balloon deflated and I decided to bottle the hard cider. So, I combined everything that fermented with a little bit of water that I boiled and added a good amount of sugar to (so that the yeast hopefully feeds on it). I tasted it and it was mainly sour and odd tasting. No apple flavor and not sweet either. Is this normal? Why does this not taste that good? Can I fix this? "
1212,Unwanted yeast flavor last 2 brews (using starter),"The last 3 all grain batches I've done have been using US-05 (IPAs) or 04 (porter) with yeast starters, which I'm relatively new to. Not sure what I'm doing wrong but the IPAs taste so similar despite very different malt/hop profiles-there is almost a Belgian, yeast flavor quality to them that overtakes the brightness that should be there in the style of IPAs I'm brewing. Before I started doing starters this characteristic never showed up. My porter (the 3rd brew in the aforementioned since utilizing starters) was spot on what I expected flavor wise, but I'm wondering if the malt bill there is such that it would overtake the yeasty taste no matter what.   I'm not sure what might be wrong in my process, as I try to be very careful with sanitization post boil/pre-ferment. Do I need to let the yeast separate 1/2 hour before pitching and get rid of the ""liquid-y part"" at the top and only pitch the ""cake""? Can anyone help? "
1213,"""FV"" abbreviation in BrewDog recipe","I am attempting to follow a recipe in BrewDog's excellent DIY DOG (see Albino Squid Assassin recipe, page 217)  As hop additions, as the last 2 additions it lists:  * Chinook 100g   FV   Aroma * Citra 75g      FV   Aroma   Throughout the other recipes it tends to list the last set of hops as ""Dry Hop"". (in fact the recipe on the previous page lists hops for both ""Dry Hop"" and ""FV"")  What does FV mean here? Add to the fermentation vessel, while fermentation is still occurring?  "
1214,Dry hopping do's and dont's?,Hi me and my future wife are brewing a bunch of different beers for our wedding. Next up is an IPA so we are curious of how the dry hopping process works. I'm looking for do's and don'ts and also a description of the process from the fermentation until the finished product.  Here are some additional questions.   What types of hop are best for dry hopping?  Can I bottle ferment after dry hopping for carbonation?   Any help is appreciated! 
1215,Can I cook/eat milled barley malt?,"I've got a small bag of whole barley malt. After doing a bit of reading I'm getting conflicting information.  Some say the outer hull in not edible, while others say it is fine and a good source of fiber.  Take this yahoo answer for example, which indicates that unhulled wheat is the same as whole wheat.  I don't think that's true, as I'm under the impression that the outer hull or chaff is not the same thing as the bran (and germ) included in whole wheat.  Is the unhulled barley edible or not?  My intended purpose is simply to mill it and simmer as a breakfast cereal. "
1216,Recover a brew that quit fermenting after I moved to secondary fermenter,"I started my first batch of beer, a ""Nut Brown Ale"", 2 weeks ago. Its initial gravity was 1.040. As per the instructions, I siphoned the beer into the secondary fermenter (a glass carboy) after two days. The airlock had already quit bubbling in the initial fermenter. Its gravity was 1.020 at that point. Today, 10 days after the move to the secondary fermenter, I tested the gravity and it was only at 1.018. The directions on the kit said it should be around 1.008-1.012 after 7 days.   It built and maintained positive pressure on the airlock the entire time since I moved it to 2nd fermenter, but I never actually saw bubbles. My room temperature is around 65F at night to 80F in the days. The beer tastes like ""beer"", but is kind of weak.  What did I do wrong? Should I add more yeast?  Update: I did the swirling method a few days ago. The airlock has started to show activity and a layer of bubbles has formed at the top. "
1217,What are the exact dimensions/specs of the fittings on a standard stainless steel Hansen Coupler?,"I have a standard stainless steel Hansen Coupler for Pin-Lock type Cornelius Kegs.  I'm trying to find the exact specs on both the 1/4 MFL and the inside (female) threads, where it connects to the actual pin lock coupler.  The coupler and the 90 degree elbow unscrew, and the coupler itself has a male threaded end that I've seen various places refer to as 7/8-14 and 5/8 BSP - but it doesn't seem quite that big.  Is that correct, or is it something else?  What exactly is a 1/4 MFL in normal terms?  Is it a 1/4in SAE 45 degree flared connector, or is it a 37 degree AN style connector?  Or something else all together?  the one I have looks like this "
1218,Fly Sparging: Can I start boiling straight away,"I fly sparge directly into my boil kettle and in general I have the heat on while I'm doing this.  When this was on my stove it wasn't powerful enough to get the water boiling before finishing the sparge so it saved me a bit of time.  Now I have an outdoor burner that is very powerful.    I'm wondering is it ok to start it boiling while sparging or should I wait till sparging is done?  Specifically, why should I do one or the other? "
1219,What kind of beer would a Yoda Beer be?,"Say Yoda brews in Dagobah before Luke's arrival. For my next batch I would like to make a ""Yoda Beer"", what kind of beer would Yoda brew? Ale? Lager? which variety? "
1220,Can a contaminted brew be identified by sight?,"I brew ten-gallon batches of beer split into two fermentors.  The last batch that I kegged had one infected fermentor, while one remained uninfected.  One bucket showed a white powdery substance covering the remnants of the krausen, as well as an oily and whitish film on the surface; the other looked normal.  I understand that there are only a few organisms known to grow in beer.  Is there a way to identify which bug has contaminated the brew?    Perhaps the various organisms are different colors?  Perhaps the texture varies? "
1221,How do I decide if the beer is ready? Is my fermentation complete?,This is my first time brewing and I've followed the instructions from a kit. It says to leave the beer in the key for two weeks and its ready when it stops being cloudy. Its now been a little over three weeks and the beer is still cloudy.  What do I do at this point? Can I assume that it's been there long enough and this batch is just going to be a bit cloudy. Or do I leave it longer and wait till it stops being cloudy? 
1222,Priming Sugar Affect on Fermentation,I screwed up took a batch that had only been fermenting for 3 days and started to bottle it before I realized it was the wrong one. [link]  During this screw up I ended up added the priming sugar then putting it back to ferment.   How will this sugar affect the fermentation process and final beer? Should I add more sugar when I go to bottle it?  
1223,Can I do a high temperature starter?,"I know if you are adding the yeast directly to the wort you want to keep the temperature similar to that of your eventual fermentation temp to minimize shock to the yeast. However, I plan to make a starter, flocculate the yeast in the fridge, and then pitch the slurry. This being the case, I'm not worried about shocking the yeast with a temp change. Can I up the temp of my starter given this information to encourage faster yeast growth? Will off flavors get into the beer even if I only pitch the slurry and throw out the beer from the starter? Are there other potential problems, and what would be an ideal temp for the starter? "
1224,Thick/Chunky Pumpkin Ale,"I racked my Pumpkin Ale into a carboy last night and it seemed chunky or thick. Is this a product of using the Pumpkin in the brew? I siphoned as much as I could but I questioned how much of the ""thick stuff"" should go into the secondary. It smelled great and had a great color, so I think it is going to turn out great. But can anyone offer insight on this?  I can post a picture of the carboy if it helps... I really hope this works out in the end.  It is an extract kit from Midwest Brewers Supply. I used canned pumpkin per the recipe with spices that came with it. I added extra pumpkin last 20 of the boil(many people suggested it on their site). I added a bit of pumpkin pie spice. It was in the primary for 13 days at around 70deg. It has a great aroma to it and cool color. Part of the batch has what I would consider normal consistancy of beer, there was just a bit of think stuff on top of the regular sludge on the bottom of the bucket. I cannot acess the recipe online right now (work) but I can do that later if you need me to do so. "
1225,Am I required to refrigerate bottles after bottling?,"My instructions that came with my kit said that I should let the bottles sit for 3 days, then age in the fridge for 10 days. If I don't refrigerate, will I get bottle bombs?  Advice on forums and other places says to leave them in the bottle for two weeks or even upwards of a month, I doubt every brewer has enough fridge space to store 5+ gallons of beer for 1 or 2 months. So, I am inclined to think they won't blow, unless I bottle with too much unfermented sugar in them.   Will leaving them out in room temp, cause them to pop? Are there any other reasons for me to refrigerate my beer, aside from taste? "
1226,Prevent haze on the inside of vinyl tubing when cleaning,"I've been cleaning my carboys with oxy-clean and it works wonders... no need to even brush (which is important if you're using the plastic 'Better Bottles').  So I decided to throw all my vinyl tubes in the warm oxy for a couple of hours. I rinsed the tubes really well by running high-speed hose water through them (shot 30 feet into the yard), but when they dried, they all had a haze on them--even the brand new, never used ones. I doubt it will impart any flavor or hold any bacteria, but I really don't like it. If I put a q-tip in the end and rub the inner wall of the tube, the haze comes right off, but I don't have a way to rub the entire length of the tube.  Has anyone else encountered this?  What did you do? "
1227,Will Adding an Active Mash to a Non-Active Mash Get Enzyme Activity Started Again?,"Background: A friend of mine does ten gallon batches of big beers, so has a lot of grain.  After mashing, his technique is to fly sparge with 170 degree water.  I understand this shuts-down enzymatic conversion.  He'll run out of sparge water, drain maybe 2/3 of the liquid from mash tun, and then lets me do whatever I want with the mash tun in order to make a second-run (partigyle) beer.  What I do during his sparging is to create a separate small mash with two pounds of two row, and get the enzymatic activity going well there.  Then, when the large mash tun becomes available, I adjust the temperature there to normal mashing temperature again (in the 150 F range), then mix in my small mash with the active enzymes (and enough appropriately heated water to mix in and come to rest at normal mashing temperature).  The Question: Will the enzymes in the small mash that are added to the large mash cause enzymatic activity in that grain that, earlier, had been ""too hot""?  I realize that the first large mash did most of the conversion.  This question is about what is left.  Will the enzymes in the small mash have a positive effect on the conversion of grains from the original mash?  Please only answer if you include references; we all likely have our ideas in the range of ""probably should"" or ""probably shouldn't"" get conversion going in the old grain, but I'm looking for something more definitive, a why it will or why it won't work, if at all possible.  Also, not interested in comments or suggested changes about the background...that's just the way it is, and what I have to deal with. "
1228,Negative effects of Wyeast American Ale 1056 turning slightly slushy in fridge,"I received a pack of Wyeast American Ale yesterday and popped it into the back of my fridge only to find this morning that it may have partially turned slushy from the (evidently) colder area in the back of the fridge. It definitely wasn't frozen solid, but I could hear a slushy mixture inside. I immediately pulled it out and moved it to another area that I know won't be as cold. I would estimate the duration of time in the fridge was about 18-20 hours (but that time would include chilling from ambient temperature.  Have I damaged the yeast beyond repair? Is the only way to determine the effect to smack it prior to brewing to see if it swells properly? Any recommendations on a course of action in either case? Should I go ahead and pitch another pack to be sure or is that overkill?  Thanks. "
1229,belgian vs german pilsner malt,"I've been brewing belgian beers with belgian pilsner malt, and german lagers with german pilsner malt without really thinking about it.   But what is it that distinguishes these malts to make them most suitable for their respective styles?  I've tried chewing on a few, but it's hard to draw a comparison, They both taste grainy and sweet. Is there really a difference? "
1230,How can I put minerals back into distilled or reverse osmosis water?,"The tap water where I live is filled with chlorine, flouride, some pretty bad elements such as arsenic, chromium, barium, etc. So I would like to purify my water with either reverse osmosis or distillation. This will remove all contaminates, but also any minerals the water had as well.  I have been told that beer needs minerals, the lady at the brew store wasn't exactly clear as to why or what minerals. Several articles I have read, talk about adding gypsum when brewing or re-adding some tap water.  What minerals do I need in my water? How can I add them? "
1231,"Oatmeal Stout, steeped grains 45 min, extract recipe: Should leave in Prim longer than usual before move to Sec?","Q1: Wondering if since I steeped recipe 4 lbs of various grains to 45 min vs recipe ""recommended"" 20 min...should I or do I leave in primary carboy for 2 to 3 weeks vs recipe ""recommended"" 1 week? or is there a FG I should wait for before racking to sec carboy? (OG 1.065) Q2: Is there a FG I should wait for before bottling?  "
1232,Did I mess up my mead?,I am attempting to make 1.5 liters of mead as a first go.  I was very lazy though and used a whole packet of lalvin 71b-1122 on such a small batch.  1 week has gone by.  The color looks good but everything has settled to the bottom.  Did it just eat everything super fast?  Is it ruined?  Cheers 
1233,How can I test the PPM of different minerals in my Water?,"As a follow up question to this, I'm interesting in testing every batch of tap water for the PPM of various minerals (calcium, magnesium, sodium, chloride, sulfate, etc). Are these test strips available at the LHBS? I saw that Northern Brewer had complete water testing kits available starting at $100, but I would rather not pay that much.  How can I test the PPM of the tap water, myself? "
1234,"First time brewing lager, no fermentation","I set up a new fermentation chamber and was keen to try my hand at a lager. Unfortunately now 5 days on there hasn't been any fermentation so I think I may have shocked the yeast with the cold or just not given it enough of a headstart.  I'm brewing a Pilsner based on the how to brew recipe using White Labs WLP800 Pilsner lager yeast. Fermenting at 50F / 10C. I only left it in the starter for about 3 or 4 hours, and the temperature was probably about 15C but fluctuated a bit.  A couple of questions, what's the best way to proceed? What is the best way to do a lager starter in the first place? "
1235,Salvaging this Sorachi Ace IPA,"A few times I have made an (almost) single-hop IPA with a hop I haven't had before, to get a good idea of what it's like.  Mosaic IPA was wonderful.  Nelson Sauvin IPA was very good.  Now, Sorachi Ace IPA...  The basic idea is (20 liters):  OG of about 1.054 IBUs of about 43 BU:GU of about .8 Bittering hops (Magnum) at :60 The ""single hop"": .5 oz at :20 .5 oz at :10 .5 oz at :05 .5 oz at flame-out 2  oz dry hop &lt;&lt; not added yet   I just racked the Sorachi Ace one, and the ""preview"" taste was a little scary.  I'm not sure I'm going to find this beer very enjoyable.  I am considering sacrificing the ""single hop"" concept and dry-hopping with something else, to get something I'll like better.  I've got some spare Citra and Cascade I could use.  How does that seem?  Or has anyone tried a single-hop Sorachi Ace IPA and found it to be really good, and think I should just carry on with the original plan? "
1236,How to add DME to the wort,"I typically use LME for my wort, with no prblems, but this time I am trying a slightly bigger beer and want to add DME to boost the OG.  The one time I tried adding DME to my wort, I just dumped it into the boil pot 2 minutes before knockoff, and it clumped so badly that I spent 20 minutes (without flame) breaking everything up so it could dissolve. Threw off my timing, but everything was okay in the end.  My question is, should I dissolve it in cooler water (in a separate pot to avoid the sudden clump - seemed to clump in contact with the steam)?  Is there a different/easier way to deal with DME? "
1237,What is the proper way to maintain temperature in a water cooler Mash tun by adding hot water?,"I bought the 10 gallon water cooler from Home Depot. The hole in it is about 3/4"" diamater. After discovering that Home Depot, Lowes, Ace Hardware, and etc. did not sell all the components (hose barbs, coupling, pipe nipple, ball valve) in stainless steel or brass, I went to my LHBS, where they only sold 1"" pieces. Getting frustrated, I widened the hole in the Home Depot water cooler with a titanium drill bit to 1"" diameter and put it together.   The temperature drops significantly over 60 minutes. For example, the test I just concluded with 5 gallons of water resulted in the following (Of course, opening the cooler to measure the temperature will change the outcome by some degree):  Minutes | Temperature (F) | Change   00    |     163         |   0   15    |     158         |  -5   30    |     153         |  -5   45    |     153         |   0   60    |     151         |  -2   Oddly, the temperature dropped 5 degrees in the first 15 minutes, another 5 in the second 15 minutes, didn't drop at all in the third 15 minutes, and dropped two in the final 15 minutes.  Test 2:  Minutes | Temperature (F) | Change   00    |     163         |   0   15    |     160         |  -3   30    |     160         |   0   45    |     160         |   0   60    |     169         |   9   Ok the brand new digital thermometer that I just bought today is obviously incorrect as the temperature spiked upwards 9 degrees. I'll have to repeat with a new thermometer.  There is a slight leak in the water cooler. I'll probably plaster the outside with silicon and test again tomorrow. However, I think I need to plan for a temperature reduction.  I've read that people typically add hot water to the mix if they are having trouble like I am having. How much should I add, at which temperature, and what time increments? Is this something that I'll just have to experiment with?   Should I just chock this up as a loss and buy a different cooler with a 1"" hole? "
1238,How much damage do aphids cause to hops?,"I have been growing hops by luck.  Last year I gave them a 3 pole teepee to climb and they flourished and were beautiful.  This year they were looking gorgeous once again, but days before I was about to pick them they became infested with aphids.  The explosion and destruction has been shocking.  My beautiful green cones are crawling with them and are suddenly turning brown (a separate problem?).  Some cones even have grey-black mold-looking stains I their bottom leaves.  HOWEVER, they still smell great and still have ample golden magic.  Question:  are my hops history or are they still worth picking.  My home brewing neighbor who has been a defender and supporter of my hops now turns up his nose.  How badly will the aphids effect my hops and our beer? "
1239,Hops - Do they stay in the wort for the primary fermentation or not?,"I have two sets of instructions for putting the wort into the primary fermentation bucket.  One says to just dump the entire contents of the wort into the bucket.  The second says to stir like crazy to create a 'hop cone', then syphon the wort, minus the hop cone, into the bucket ...  Oh, what to do???? "
1240,How is ABV calculated if distilled spirits are added to beer?,"How would one calculate the ABV of a beer if distilled spirits were added?  For instance, when making a beer recipe that called for adding bourbon as a flavoring agent.  If you started with, say, 5 US gallons of beer at 5% ABV and you added 1 quart of ""80 proof"" spirits, how would one calculate the resulting ABV? "
1241,"I just had my Big Mouth Bubbler carboy shatter, now I'm terrified","I've been using these big mouth bubbler's as my secondary fermentation now for a few months:    I was originally using them as primary as well, but being one that makes pretty high gravity beers, I was scared of the pressure build up inside even with a blow off tube, and what could potentially happen if the blow off tube got plugged up and too much pressure built up inside.  I am however unsure if having used them as primary before could have potentially weakened the container a from having held a lot of pressure at one point.  Anyway last week I had one filled up with 5 or so gallons and carried it down to my basement as my secondary.  And upon setting it on the ground (concrete ground, probably my first mistake), when it hit the ground the bottom shattered and beer went everywhere.  I've already fixed that mistake by making a padded area to place these on now when bringing them to the basement, but I'm pretty terrified of this ever happening again.  Is it possible using these as a primary weakened it to make this scenario more likely?  Are there other precautions I should be taking to make sure this never happens again?  Is this just a constant risk when using large glass containers?  Any other horror stories I should know about and strive to avoid?  I'm starting to think I shouldn't use glass anymore because I'm terrified this could happen again. "
1242,High Altitude Nitro,I recently relocated to Denver and found some excellent advice in this question but I was wondering since drj mentioned that since carbonation is an issue how that will affect my nitro setup and carbing?  My current process is to carb (using CO2) to about 7-8psi and then switch to beergas(75/25) that I set to 32-33psi. Will this need to be altered?  Thanks in advance for any help!  
1243,Pure Carapils starter wort?,"I was reading White Labs' Homebrew Starter Tips page, and the following got me thinking:     Keeping the Original Gravity low is important because you want to keep the yeast in its growth phase, rather than its fermentation phase.  The fermentation phase will create alcohol which can be toxic to yeast in high concentrations.   If the goal is to provide nutrients and oxygen to the yeast to induce growth while avoiding fermentation, wouldn't a very dextrinous wort be best? Would it make sense to produce the starter wort by steeping Carapils alone? "
1244,'Auto-transfer' to secondary corny keg fermentors?,"I've been reading some topics about corny-keg fermentors and became interested in that. So I was wondering:  If I ferment in a sealed keg with the liquid side plugged into another keg, by its liquid side to, can I expect that the pressure built by the yeast in primary is able to transfer the beer to the secondary one?  If so, how much time that it would takes to happen? Can I expect some attenuation or it will be so fast that primary wouldn't be done yet? If so, how much time/attenuation should I wait with simple air lock in the gas side of the keg and even so be able to do this hypothetical 'auto-transfer' (transfer with the CO2 built by the yeast instead of CO2 tank)?  Considering that is possible, it seems to be a good idea? "
1245,Really strong beer's gravity (1.120) won't drop below 1.042,"I've brewed my second beer, it's starting gravity was 1120. It didn't seem to want to get a gravity below 1050 after 9 days, so i added champagne yeast. Two days later it dropped down to 1042. 4 days later it's still 1042. What's wrong with this if anything? Or does anyone think it will drop more? And do i want it to drop more? "
1246,Speed to collect wort from the mash tun for maximum efficiency,"I want to optimize my efficiency, and I was wondering is the speed at which I collect my wort has an incidence on it.  Right now I would say that I collect 1 liter of wort each 30-45 seconds. I get between 65% and 70% efficiency. I am using a 10 gallons mash tun.   Is that too fast? Will lowering the flow increase my efficiency?  "
1247,Ethanol / Methanol : Prison Hooch,"After speaking with a friend about home brew he told me a story about making prison hooch ( at home for a laugh ), strained through a sock etc. It's hilarious.   However when I talked about my plans to experiment with ingredients in my brews he told me that when he made his hooch he used a test strip or something to check if his beautiful brew in a bin bag had produced ethanol or the rather more deadly METHANOL!  I was mortified at the prospect of poisoning my friends with experimental ingredients.  So I'd like to ask;  Is there a chance I can add ingredients to my brew and inadvertently produce methanol?   Do I need to worry about this?   What would be a bad ingredient that could do this?   Should I use test strips for such bad alcohols? "
1248,Adding sugar to a brown pumpkin ale,"I'm planning on making a pumpkin ale out of a brown ale mini-mash recipe.  I'd also like to get a hint of caramel in there so I was thinking about adding some sort of unrefined sugar.  Does anyone have a recommendation on what type would work best?  I'm leaning towards turbinado but would love suggestions.  Perhaps the biggest question is how much I should use.  I want to be able to taste it, but not dry it out.  How do I figure out the right amount?  Is there anything I should do to adjust the base recipe or just not worry about it? "
1249,Oxyclean safe inside the bottle,"I just bought some oxyclean to remove labels from a lot of bottles. What I do to remove the labels is: put the bottles standing in the bucket, fill each bottle with water, and then fill the bucket with water to just above the neck labels and add the oxyclean. I did this because I'm not sure if I should get the oxyclean inside the actual bottle.  No one mentions that you shouldn't, but I read it is not a food safe product.  Should I not worry about this? If not, I can fit more bottle in the bucket.  And what is the proper way to clean the bottles after the oxyclean soak? I just rinsed the inside and out with fresh water a couple of times. "
1250,Will Jalapeno or Habanero peppers adversely effect yeast,"I have a recipe in front of me for a Saison of the spicy variety.  It calls for the addition of one Jalapeno pepper, seeds included.  First off, I do enjoy a fair amount of spice (far more than anyone I know or eat with regularly would enjoy), and one jalapeno that the recipe calls for seems sort of weak for my tastes, hence the inclusion of habaneros should I decide to get squirrely on my limits as a mortal.  My question is, will the addition of these peppers have adverse reactions on the yeast?  Since yeast is a living organism, and the spicy defenses of these peppers are genetically engineered to fight off threats, will the spice hurt the yeast growth/fermentation? "
1251,Disconnecting a keg,I have a mobile bar business and wanted to add draught beers to our menu.  I am a layman with regards to this but I understand how the basic system works using a CO2 (or 70/30 CO2 &amp; Nitrogen) and a beer cooler.    My question is about how long the opened kegs will last seeing as I will need to disconnect them for travel and store them unrefridgerated.  Will they last until the next event?  Also will the gas be easy to disconnect and use again?  Thanks in advance! 
1252,How can I recover this barleywine batch?,"Can we help our fellow geek solve his homebrew problem?     I'm making a barley wine. My boil gravity should be 1.106.

I mashed 22 pounds (10kg) at 148°F (64.4°C) for 90 minutes, just like the book said. I have collected just about 6 gallons.      Did I sparge too fast? Do I put the wort back into the mash tun and keep it there for X minutes or something? Am I going to have to put LME or DME into the boil?

1254,How much ginger should I add to my mead?,"I'm using this recipe for a start  [website]1 gallon batch    3 1/2 lbs Clover or your choice honey or blend (will finish sweet)  1 Large orange (later cut in eights or smaller rind and all)  1 small handful of raisins (25 if you count but more or less ok)  1 stick of cinnamon  1 whole clove ( or 2 if you like - these are potent critters)  optional (a pinch of nutmeg and allspice )( very small )  1 teaspoon of Fleishmann’s bread yeast ( now don't get holy on me       --- after all this is an ancient mead and that's all we had back then)  Balance water to one gallon    I would like to replace (all or some of) the spices with ginger, but I do not have any idea how much should it be. How can I estimate a sensible amount to use in order to have a pleasant distinctive (but not excessive) flavor? "
1255,How do you strain pellet hops out of wort or beer?,"After boiling pellets how can I deal with them? Is there a simple way to get them out of the wort, or can I leave them during fermentation? In that case will I be sure they will drop on the bottom and not cause problems? "
1256,Quality difference between LME and DME,"Is there any quality difference between the two? Dry malt extract is way more convenient for me, but are there any downsides? Can I use just DME (and no liquid malt extract) with no problems in some recipe? "
1257,What effect does adding flaked corn to a recipe have?,"I've been taught to look down on breweries that use corn in their beer, because it's a cheaper ingredient, and obviously men would never put corn in their beer.  That being said, why would you put flaked corn in your beer?  I've heard generically of adding corn to more closely approximate a commercial clone, but that leaves me questioning, in what way does it change? "
1258,Possible contamination / small areas of bubble clusters on top of brew,"How would you know if your brew is or isn't contaminated? I'm the first timer that dealt with the broken spigot &amp; had to transfer at 6 days. Just hearing about contaminated home brew so many times &amp; the fact that I'm looking at my batch right now &amp; it just looks like dark coffee with no movement ..freaks me out a little. ??? Also, if this brew is ok, can I transfer it back in to a bucket from the Carboy for ease of bottling ?? "
1259,How to bottle mead?,I have some mead fermenting. It is the first time doing it and I have no idea how would it be bottled. I have one sweet and one dry version   Should I use beer bottles that can resist pressure? Is carbonation using sugar needed/recommended/possible?  
1260,"Lots of sanitizer sucked up into my mead, wondering if it's still safe to consume?","My power went out and I guess the house cooled enough during that time to suck about 1/4 gallon of sanitizer from the blowoff into my 1 gallon batch mead. It completely filled the headspace and started to climb up the tubes on my 5 gallon batches of beer.  There seems to be no more yeast activity in the batch, so I'm thinking it must have all died off from the sanitizer. The gravity is still high so I want to ferment this further, but is it pointless to repitch some new yeast?  If I repitch the yeast and it takes off again, will it be safe to drink? Will it even taste good?  The sanitizer is Star San. "
1261,How much water is used for mashing,"How much water for each kg of grains is typically used in mash? (I am referring to mash only, not to sparging). Is that amount the amount of the final wort I will be boiling? "
1262,Electric brewing inside,"It's starting to get cold out there but I still want to brew.  I started looking into electric brew kettles (i am still new and only using extracts kits).  Most of the stuff I read online is about adding a heatstick to your brew kettle.  I no nothing about welding, so that intimidates me.  I found this water bucket heater on Amazon that people in the comments talk about using it to supplement their stove top for boiling wort.  Some comments, however, talk about how its hard to clean properly.  Has anyone here used this? and what are your thoughts?  It's currently 50% off, so its only $40, which seems like a great deal if it was to work.  Other then using this, do you have suggesting for brewing inside? "
1263,What bottled water?,I am going to use bottled water so I do not have to worry about the tap one beeing not too clear (Here I can find some at 0.20-0.30 $ a liter). Since bottled water has information on minerals in the water I want to take advantage of that. Which mineral should be there and which shouldn't be? What about pH or anything else? 
1264,What are the practical differences between leaf hops and hop pellets?,"I'm looking to start purchasing hops in bulk, and there are more options than I thought for getting leaf hops.  I've heard (read in this forum) that leaf hops can be better for dry hopping, and also that they are not as good for dry hopping due to introducing more oxygen and soaking up beer.  Are there any other considerations or factors that are objective?  EDIT: I still very much appreciate the answers given, and any more that may speak to this issue, but This question about utilization addresses one of the most important concerns I had when asking this question. "
1265,What is the purpose of lagering?,"I know all the cliche answers:  ""it rounds the beer out"", ""it cleans it up"", ""it takes away some of the harshness"".    I'm looking for a definitive answer of whats actually happening during extended cold storage.  Is it just clarity?  Are you dropping polyphenols/tannins that affect FLAVOR?  Couldn't this be achieved with some finings and a quick crash?  I've had some pretty darned clear beers that I've turned around in less than 2 weeks, grain to glass with some prepared gelatin, big yeast pitch, and careful manipulation of fermentation temp.    My only lager to date is Jamil's Oktoberfest that I primary'd @ 50* for 3 weeks, cold-pitched with about a gallon starter.  I have to be honest, I am a provisional BJCP judge, taking my tasting exam @ the end of the month, and consider myself to have a pretty good palette.  I couldn't really tell the difference between the sample of beer pulled @ 3 weeks, and the beer after it sat in a fridge for a month.    Listening to Jamil and John Palmer talking about it, it sounds like the purpose is largely to achieve clarity.  I also seem to remember Jamil saying something to the effect of ""if you have a strong, healthy primary fermentation, you don't need to lager as much"".    In many ways, it seems like decoction to me: an antequated process that is not really necessary anymore given upgrades in technology (in the case of decoction: advanced malting techniques; in the case of lagering: yeast selection/genetic modification, fermentation temp control, and refrigeration).    Or alternatively, maybe I just need more experience tasting pre-lagered lagers and brewing lagers! :^D "

1267,Measuring temperatures at two points: weird trend?,"This seems like an ideal place to ask a question that has been keeping me confused for a little while now. But I apologize if I've posted in the wrong area.  My question is that I don't seem to understand the temperature trend that I am seeing from my temperature sensors. I'll start of with my setup: Essentially, I have a metal box with two temperature sensors. 1) Is mounted right at the base of the box [Temp Sensor #1] 2) The second temperature sensor is mounted 2 inches from the top of the box [Temp Sensor #2]. The box is about 6 inches in height.  I've placed a heating pad at the base of the box (Temp Sensor #1 lies right in the center of this pad. A graphic showing my setup:    I've also implemented a simple on/off temperature controller, that senses when the temperature goes above a certain set-point and turns off (hence you see the highs/lows for Temp Sensor #1).     As you can see from the image, the lower sensor (blue) has the peaks/troughs corresponding to when the heater turns on/off. The heater gets triggered every time the sensing temperature goes below the set point. What I don't understand is why the top sensor (red) has a periodically decreasing trend (it doesn't have highs/lows similar to the bottom sensor)? It doesn't seem to be affected by the heater turning on at all? Even though it is merely 4"" away from the heater inside the metal enclosure.   I understand that Sensor#1 is probably changing immediately due to the heater very quickly affecting the metal base temperature via conduction. Whereas the second sensor is probably measuring the air around the metal enclosure at the top, and since air is an insulator, it takes longer to heat up. But there should be at-least some highs and lows I'd imagine. The continuous decreasing trend doesn't make any sense ...  Then, I suspected that perhaps my second temperature sensor was damaged. But that wasn't the case. I've tested both sensors and they work fine. Also here is a graph of the temperature trend, when I place the enclosure (with the sensors) in the freezer with no heater action. Intuitively as you can imagine, there is merely a decreasing trend for both sensors (shown below) due to the effect of the freezer:  Any suggestions please as to why I notice no temperature variation at Sensor #2 location when the heater turns on/off? "
1268,Is Videne effective as a non-rinse santizer?,"In nearly all the online videos from experienced homebrewers, they use Star San as a non-rinse sanitizer. However in the UK it is not widely available (only one site has it online and it is not available in any of my LHBS).  I did a quick search for alternatives and found mention of using Videne (an antiseptic solution used in medical surgeries). Has anybody used this in brewing? and is it as effective as Star San (i.e. effective sanisting, non-rinse, short contact time, no undesirable taste)? "
1269,Formulating a session saison using extract & grains,"I'm looking to put together a session saison &amp; can't find much online to start from.  I've got this so far, but would like some feedback.  Malts   500g Munich I (steeped) 3kg x-light / pilsner extract   Hops   20g Northern Brewer 9.6% (~25IBU) @ 60min 40g Hallertau at flame-out   Yeast   Wyeast 3711 - French Saison (I've already got this so would prefer to keep it in)   Stats   ~25-27 IBU ~1.041-1.043 OG ~1.008 FG, 4.5-4.7% ABV   The beer is for a birthday party, so I'd like to aim for ""wide appeal"", while still keeping it interesting.    I like Dupont's Saison and have read that they use exclusively pilsner malt; is this typical or should I mix it up with some wheat?  In the base malt or steeped?  Are spices (e.g. peppercorns, bitter orange, coriander) typical and would they still fit the ""mass appeal"" goal?  Or is it better to keep the recipe simple when using 3711? "
1270,How long to keep in blowoff tube?,"Today I learned what happens if there's too much yeast and a container too small (I have a 1 gallon batch). So according to instructions I sanitized a hose and connected the hole in the fermentor and put the other end in the sanitized water.  Now, how long should I keep this setup? A couple of hours until there is no more bubbling? Just long enough to stop the heavy bubbling? Or all the way to the end of the fermentation? "
1271,Hydrometer exploded,"I'm really worry, I made a wort some hours ago, and right now I see that my hydrometer is broken in the bottom, the last time I used it was in the hot wort previous to boiling, and it seems like some little green balls are missing.  Until I know, the green balls could be lead or mercury, so if these balls are into my wort this could be really a danger to my health. Should I drop my beer in order to avoid be poisoned by unknown metals?   EDIT I just read that green balls are OK, [website]EDIT2 Picture "
1272,"Recipe says don't add priming sugar, will it lead to flat beer?","I am total novice so please excuse me for possibly stupid question. I bought a ""beer kit"" (malt + hop) that had recipes for 20 and 12 liters. I decided to go for 12 liters, because I don't have a lot of bottles. So it says that I don't need to add priming sugar in case of 12L variant. I am now worried will not beer be flat then? The initial concentration of sugar is higher, but will not it be all processed before bottling? May be it is possible to start bottling before bubbling ends?  Edit: I am really sorry! I didn't read instruction careful enough and misinterpreted table. Here it is:  Priming sugar is marked as Sugar 2 (not Sugar 1 as I thought), so my original question doesn't make any sense anymore. Still thanks to everyone for very useful information. "
1273,How to steep 2-row in a partial grain recipe,"New to brewing, only done a few all-extract batches.  For my next batch I came across an APA recipe that called for a 2:1 ratio of DME to 2-row malt.  What wasn't clear to me was if I should just plan to steep the 2-row along with the other adjunct grains (60L in this case) or if I should plan a more drawn-out 150 degree steep and 170 degree sparge for the 2-row?  I suppose either will work but the more complex process will get a better flavor, but, any hints or suggestions?  Thanks! "
1274,Relation of CO2/alcohol/yeasts in Ginger Beer,"The article making_ginger_beer mentions using bread yeast so you get more carbonation and less alcohol. Isn't carbonation a by-product of the process that makes alcohol? Wouldn't that mean more carbonation means more alcohol? What is the relation between type of yeast, carbonation, and alcohol content? "
1275,How can I ferment in a corny keg under constant pressure?,"I'm thinking about switching from fermenting (primary and secondary) in glass carboys to using Cornelius kegs. Specifically, I'd ferment a 5.5 gallon batch in a 10 gallon keg.   My goal is to ferment under pressure -- around 10 or 15 psi. Why? There's some anecdotal evidence that fermenting under pressure reduces ester production which could help with lager fermentation. But mostly, the pressure would a) let me remove yeast and trub after a few days of fermentation, and b) let me transfer the finished, carbonated beer to a serving keg under pressure  How can I regulate the pressure of fermenting beer in a Cornelius keg?  I can image a setup where the gas in line (with the tube removed, perhaps) is connected to a blow-off tube with an in-line pressure regulator. The regulator would need to be adjustable, so I could dial in different pressures for different beers, and at different stages in the fermentation.  I'm not sure if such an in-line regulator exists. I also expect it would need to be resilient to moisture. Fermenting 5.5 gallons in a 10 gallon vessel, there's not much chance that liquid will end up in the blow-off tube, but I want to be prepared for it if it does happen.  Has anyone ever put together a setup like this? Can anyone foresee technical difficulties I haven't thought of? "
1276,How do I start experimenting?,"Ok, I've become comfortable brewing all grains but I want to start experimenting.  Where do I start?  Should I start experimenting at the primary fermentation stage and brew a bunch of small different batches? Or should is it better to start when transferring to the secondary?  If you'd recommend this approach what do you use for fermenters?  Do they make small 1 gallon fermenters? I'd like to have my experiments beside each other for testing. "
1277,Suggested fermentation temperature for the beer kits,"Suggested fermentation temperature on the beer kit is ambient temperature or its the temperature reading on fermentation bucket? Also i am not able to keep steady ambient temperature as our flat's heating system is not modern it changes during the day, what effects that will have on my beer?  Additional information: Temperature difference between wort and surrounding is generally around 3°C, and ambient temperature of the room also changes around 2°C throughout the day. I made couple of batches in these conditions they turned out ok, but I am wondering how important to control temperature precisely and will it really improve the quality; is it worth to make some investment for this? "
1278,Making a lager from an ale recipe,My question involves fermentation of an ale recipe into a lager. Is it possible to brew an ale recipe and then ferment it with a lager yeast at lagering temperatures? Will the fermented wort have the qualities (taste and color) of a fermented lager? 
1279,120v DC Agitator 240v element,"0 down vote favorite Full disclosure: Not an electrician, mostly clueless.  Setting: Home Brewing Beer  Short: 120v DC variable drive motor running full tilt when 240v AC 5500w element is connected to mash tun.  Long: I have a 50 gallon brew kettle with a 240v 5500w AC heating element. The element has variable power supply. Recently I added a 120v DC variable speed motor to agitate the mash (stirring 50 gallons of mash by hand gets really old). The motor work appropriately when the heating element is not attached to a power supply; I can adjust the speed of the motor.  When the heating element is attached to its power supply, the agitator motor runs at full speed, and cannot be adjusted. I spoke with the manufacturer and they suggested that I have an electrician come out.  My house was built in the 20's and has lots of ""character"". Many of the circuits are not grounded. That being said, I am (fairly) certain the circuit that the agitator is running on is grounded, as well as the heating element.  Thoughts? Places to start trouble-shooting? "
1280,Adding pecan flavor to brown ale,"I have a extract-based brown ale that needs about another 1-2 weeks in primary before I bottle it. I'd like to add some pecan flavor.   Based on other things i've read (including Hazelnut Brown Ale - What extract?), I'm thinking about doing this:   Chop/smash and roast some quantity of pecans (maybe 1lb?) Cover them in vodka to extract the flavor Let that sit for the next 1-2 weeks Add a small amount of the extract when bottling   Does this seem like a reasonable plan? Any thoughts on quantity of pecans and extract? I want to get some of the flavor without overpowering the brown ale (which look like it might hit 1.020 final gravity).  I also see (on the web):   directions for roasting pecans; similar directions a recipe for Pecan Porter that calls for 12-16 oz ground pecans in the mash (too late for doing that, though that suggests a quantity of pecans)  "
1281,How can I prime bottled beer in accordance with the reinheitsgebot?,"I so far brew beer using two different beer brewing kits. One required adding honey, the other sugar, for the bottling.  First of all - isn't this breaking the reinheitsgebot? As a German I feel obliged to it.  Shouldn't the dextrose produced during mashing be sufficient for sweetness?  Then again I read that the sugar added during bottling is supposed to increase carbonation - not sweetness. But how would sufficient carbonation be ensured without adding sugar (sticking to the reinheitsgebot)?  (my question might seem dogmatic but I am more interested in understanding the underlying processes) "
1282,Storing leftover hops using water displacement method,Has anyone tried using water displacement method for sealing leftover hops? I realise you'd normally want to keep hops pretty far away from water. But you also want to keep it far away from O2 as well. Squeezing zip lock bags seems common enough.  I just had a delivery of last years hop harvest and it didn't come in bags that are suitable for resealing.   
1283,Balancing wines pH after fermentation,"Can a wine's pH be adjusted after fermentation?   I brewed a blueberry wine and it came out horrible. The red yeast was dead, so to salvage the must I pitched champagne yeast. That was the first problem.  Secondly, the wine's ph level was too high, resulting in a humiliating weak tasting wine.   If possible, I'd like to increase the acidity of the wine in the hope of making it a little more pleasant to drink... Or should I scrap the entire batch?  "
1284,Add US 05 to my smack pack?,"I have an ale that will have an OG of .073, but only 1 smack pack on hand and brewing in 12 hours. Nervous that the 1 pack may not be enough to support the OG? I always have an extra few dry packs of SafeAle 05 on hand. Wondering if just rehydrating one and pitching in addition to the smack pack is advisable, or just take my chances with the one smack pack? "
1285,Using Extract kit yeast vs some external commercial dry yeast,"Is there any difference in quality, rather than the strain and flavor profile, between the kit yeasts coming with the kit and some external dry yeast?  Beers that i batched using external yeast (US-05, T-58, etc, I have tried quite a few types based on the style I brewed) feels to be coming out much better than the ones I brewed using kit yeast. Assuming the flavor profile of the kit yeast fits the beer style, do you think it really worths investing to the yeast? Or is that just a cognitive bias?   PS: My native language is not English, we call the extract + yeast combo sold commercially for easily making beer ""kit"", I am hoping it is used in English like this as well. "
1286,Starting gravity reading when not all fermentables are dissolved,"Is it possible to get a useful starting gravity reading when not everything is dissolved or suspended, but you know it ultimately will be?  Some context: In my pre-hydrometer days, I made a few cysers / honey ciders that really only amounted to apple juice, honey, and yeast.  I never was able to get the honey to fully dissolve, it just went straight to the bottom and sat there, silently mocking me.  After initially being concerned, I RDWHAHB'd, figuring the yeast would find the honey eventually.  And they did!  A couple weeks later, the honey layer was gone, leaving the beginnings of a delicious beverage behind.    (In hindsight, I wonder if this accidental timed release mechanism meant the yeast weren't as stressed as they could have been, actually improving the final product.  But I digress.)  Back to my question: if I understand the physics of a hydrometer, it measures the buoyancy due to displacement of the water+stuff (dissolved/suspended).  So it seems to me that anything not dissolved or suspended (thus resting on the bottom) will NOT be reflected in the gravity reading, any more than if I were to throw in a handful of marbles.  Am I correct in my thinking here?  === EDIT: anyone who comes this way, the following wasn't quite right, see answers below ===  If so, then it seems like it should be possible to calculate an ""effective"" OG, since I know how much adjunct I'm adding.  If:  starting gravity = (density of wort)/(density of water)                  = ((mass of wort)/volume)/((mass of water)/volume)                  = (mass of wort)/(mass of water)  # since volume is equal                  = (mass of water + mass of stuff)/(mass of water)                  = 1 + (mass of stuff)/(mass of water)   then for the purpose of illustration and intentionally making the math easy, would adding 50g of honey to 1L of 1.050 AJ lead to an ""effective"" OG of 1.100?  (assuming 1L of water = 1000g)   "
1287,Carbonation Time at Different Keg Volumes,"Right now I'm carbonating hard cider in 5 gallon corny kegs at 35psi for about 48 hours.  What I'm wondering is: Will the same pressure/time in larger vessels (say, 1/4 barrel kegs, or 1/2 barrel kegs) produce the same results? Or will the larger vessels require more time?  Other details: No carbonation stone, not shaking the keg, carbonating at ~36°F "

How long is the minimum time I need to leave this before it gets the right flavour profile. Wyeast say up to 18 months, but is there any reliable way anyone knows of has tried to speed this up? Has anyone any experience pitching Roesalare Blend with other yeasts? eg SO4 or US-05? I am thinking of using a cork bung to allow slow oxygen transfer in/out of my stainless FV for the againg? for 50l should a 25mm/1in bung allow suffcent oxygen trasfer? Has anyone tried repitching the Roeslare or similar blend, wyeast website says not to do so, but I hate buying yeast/bacteria when I am growing them in my basement? I am going to age this with oak cubes 25mm/1in on a side, how many should I use?

1289,Cold crashing and risk of oxidation,"I'm brewing a Belgian golden strong ale for the first time. According to the fermentation schedule, it should cold crash and lager at 32°F (0°C) for three weeks. Even though I've cold crashed before, my technique has been to momentarily replace the airlock with sanitized foil. Keeping the airlock while cooling will suck water into the tank. A similar approach is mentioned in Lager Diacetyl Rest and Lagering Without Air Escape.   Is there a better way to do this using a glass carboy? Is there a risk of oxidation since oxygen will enter the tank?  "
1290,How to bottle from nitro as a homebrewer?,"Does anybody know how to bottle from nitro?  I have a nitro beer that I enjoy from my kegerator on a 75:25 N:CO2 gas blend. So far all attempts to bottle this beer on the nitro mix has failed (using Blichmann's Beer Gun). It just pours flat and receives negative feedback.  Left Hand Brewing have figured this out. They're keeping it a secret as far as I can tell but I'm just hoping there's somebody out there who has also figured it out? If so, please share! "
1291,Diluting beer after 11 hours of fermentation. What to expect?,"Ended up with too high gravity wort. Since I was not prepared for this I didn't have enough sterile water to dilute the wort. I ended up pitching the yeast anyway and adding sterile water at 11 hours later. At this point the yeast was fully activated and regular air had probably left the tank. While being cautious about splashing, more oxygen most certainly ended up in the fermenter. In a about 15-20 minutes the airlock started letting air out again.   What should I be on the lookout for now? I assume there is a risk of contamination, oxidation and diacetyl production. Has anyone else a attempted this, and how did it end up?   Normally I would have changed the fermentation schedule and swapped the style, but this was not an option with this one. The combination of IBU and color would have beer through the roof for any sensible style. Additionally there was a limit for how long it can sit and ferment.  EDIT The wort was diluted to the 122,5% of the original volume from OG of 1.100 to 1.082. Using Vermont Ale Yeast that typically attenuates to 1.018 (expecting ABV of 8.39%) "
1292,Difference of water content for difference in taste,"My brother and my father both brewed the same beer at the same time in the same general area.  General area being each at their own home, but separated by about 20 miles and they are in different counties.    They used the same bag of yeast, the same bag of grains and everything, just to try to make it consistent.  The equipment was essentially the same, my brother being newer at homebrewing than my father.  They both used the same recipe for beer.  It was a simple lager, forget the actual recipe name, but nothing dark or complex with tastes.  Both had measured to the same specific gravity and ended at the same within a small margin. When the beer was finished, they had two different tasting beers.  Same general or basic taste, they both tasted like a simple lager, not a light beer, but just simple. The only difference that we could think of was the water source.  Both are from the same river, but the two different counties process the water differently.  Is there a different reason for this taste difference you would think?  Is this that plausible?  How important is water content (sulfites, hard vs soft water, water acidity, water akalinity, etc.)? "
1293,Filtering my batches (no dead fishes),"I have had a couple of cloudy batches recently, both tasted as intended, so no contamination. This has caused me to consider filtration, I have a 100l kit with a pump so could use plate filters or membrane filters etc, as I should have enough power to cope with the pressure drop across the filter.  I have also considered using finings, but do not want to add any isinglass to my beers as I have many vegan and vegetarian friends whom enjoy drinking them.  My questions are these:  1) What filtering options should I consider?  2) What fining options should I use other than isinglass?  3) How do finings and filtering work in conjunction? "
1294,Scaling up from a colony,"I am preparing to start my own small yeast bank and I was wondering what is the optimal method for scaling up to a starter from a single colony.    What step sizes should I use? What strength of wort should I use? How long should it take for each step?   For the sake of an example, what would be the optimal path to get from a single colony on a plate to a starter suitable for pitching into 100l of 1050 wort?  Edit for clarity: By optimal I mean giving me the smallest pitchable starter, for the required number of cells, and having cells at the highest viability and vitality when pitching. "
1295,What is the highest OG which is still fermentable?,"How high can you push OG, taking sugar I know you can easily make a solution up to ~1180 (500g in 1 litre), but how high can a super saturated solution be? And, at what limit does it become un-fermentable, ie the strength of the osmotic pressure would kill the yeast before they got going? "
1296,Can you add beer to a keg and continue to carbonate?,I carbonated my keg with 30 psi over night. When I started to bottle (growlers) I noticed that there wasn't much carbonation.  Can I put the beer back into the keg and continue to carbonate? Will this affect the remaining beer?  I am going to give it a go. Pouring it gently back into the keg and upping the CO2 to 35 psi and check it tomorrow. Any thoughts?

All the normal tips are understood, i.e., 1#/gal, strawberries will likely kickstart fermentation in a secondary, strawberries will bleach out and really look awful at the end of the secondary so do not be afraid, among other tips.  My wife is going to pick local strawberries and freeze them. I expect her cut the caps prior to freezing.  Any thoughts as to washing the strawberries in StarSan prior to freezing to assist in surface cleansing? Or should I consider the ""environment of the beer"" to hostile for real bacterial contamination to take hold and just simply ""rinse them thoroughly in the sink""? "
1298,Secondary fermentation in a plastic bag - is this safe?,"When performing a secondary fermentation, it's recommended to use a glass carboy rather than a plastic bucket, with one of the main reasons being that it reduces head space so that less oxygen is sealed up with the beer. If that's the goal, could you instead line a sanitized bucket with a sanitized food-grade plastic bag, siphon the beer into the bag, then seal the bag so that there isn't any head space at all?  BYO mentions lining a bucket with a plastic bag to help with sanitation, and assuming the bag is BPA-free, food grade, etc - would this be safe or at all effective? "
1299,Transfer from Sanke Keg to Corny keg?,I would like to put craft beers on my tap system at home. Is it possible and safe to depressurize a full sanke keg and pour that beer into a corny keg so I can connect and enjoy at home?  Other suggestions? 
1300,Are starter sizes meant to be actual volumes or container sizes?,"I've seen a lot of references to 1L/1000mL starters being made with anywhere from 2 cups (~473mL) to 650mL of water and half a cup of DME. The 1L size seems to refer to the expected container (a 1L Erlenmeyer flask) rather than the actual volume of liquid.  However, I have also seen references to a ""pint"" starter which I assume means the same mixture, this time referring to the volume of water used.  Is this just an inconsistency in the homebrewing community or do some people make small starters for (literally) pint-sized flasks?  For a modern vial of White Labs yeast or Wyeast activator pack, how large a starter is generally recommended for a wort of moderate gravity (>1.060)? "
1301,Is there a maximum theoretical solubility of brewing sugars in Malt water?,"I normally use 10# pounds of grain in a 7.5 gallon boil, and normally hit between 1.045 and 1.055 OG, after it evaporates down to 6+ gallons, depending on the amount of dark grains used. My stove setup cannot boil much more than 7.5 gallons.  If I were to add, say, 5# of grain but keep my water constant, should I expect a roughly 33% increase in my original gravity? Or, can water only hold so many sugars before it becomes saturated, and the only solution is to increase my boil volume?  If the latter is true, what is the theoretical maximum OG of preboil wort for a given amount of water? "
1302,Dry hopping a lager in secondary,"I've just moved my first lager into a secondary bucket, it had been in primary for about 3 weeks. Currently sitting in the keezer at about 10c.  The recipe I'm following calls for the addition of about 300g of hops for dry hopping. I was just wondering what might the best way of going about this would be.  I know you shouldn't dry hop for too long to you avoid a grassy / plant-y taste. Would this still be the case if I turned the temp down to less than 5c? I don't want to wait longer than I need to but also don't want a crappy beer.  What would be the best balance to strike between duration / temperature to get a decent effect from the dry hopping recommended in the recipe?  Thanks "
1303,Stalled Fermentation to Bottling,"I brewed an amber ale 4 weeks ago and the fermentation has stalled. The OG was 1.060, and a week and a half later the gravity was 1.037. I let it sit another week and a half and the gravity reached 1.034. A week after that the gravity was 1.033. My target FG was 1.016, and it's at room temp (~75°F). I did attempt to rouse the yeast when I measured the gravity of 1.034 by swirling the fermenter, but that seemed to have no affect.   I've seen lots of questions about how to restart a stuck fermentation, but I'm fine with how it tastes and want to bottle it soon. My question is given the extra un-fermented sugar indicated by the high gravity, do I need to adjust the amount of priming sugar to achieve a reasonable carbonation level, and to avoid bottle bombs in the worst case? Or should I avoid glass bottles all together due to risk? "
1304,"What are the ""tails""?","While reading an article on home brewing the article said to keep the tails, what does it mean by tails? What are the tails? "
1305,Not quite at FG with an extract batch after two and a half weeks... Safe to bottle?,"It's a simple US-05 extract batch. OG was 1.063 and I'm currently on 1.016 where projected FG was 1.012. Gravity has been stable for three days. It's also absolutely delicious so I'd gladly bottle it now, I'm just a bit concerned about the possibility of bottle bombs?  Over the past few days I've tried rousing the yeast by swirling a little and upping the temps to like 21c/70f, but it hasn't done anything to the gravity so it seems to have properly stopped...  The only other thing I can think of is the fact that I steeped 0.5kg of Crystal for like 20 minutes at a slightly higher temperature than is usual. It got up to like 90c/194f. Could this have caused production of unfermentable sugars which elevated the final FG? "
1306,Flavoring Kombucha with herbs,"I would like to try flavoring my kombucha. I have heard you can add herbs like mint after fermentation, before botteling.  But then I would have the leafs in by bottles, right? Or do I have to take them out after some time?  What about putting the mint into my fresh tea before fermentation? Doesn't it harm the SCOBY? "
1307,Does Kombucha lose calories while fermenting?,"While brewing Kombucha sugar is transformed to carbon dioxide, alcohol, acid, etc. But what does that mean to the calories? Is there less? How much less?  Here is my setup:   tea: 25 ltr sugar: 1000 grm temperature: 18°C duration: 4 days   Can you tell how much calories I have in my Kombucha?  I hope for an answer like: ""Calories go down by 20% to 30%"". "
1308,"Can diatomaceous earth be used as fining agent, but not filter?","i have beer that won't clear itself. Gelatin and isinglass is not vegan. Activated charcoal can create off-flavors.  Can diatomaceous earth be used? Probably, like activated charcoal, I would need pretty much of it, and stir it well, if gently, for it to absorb haze. In the other hand, it's mostly silica. Flavorless and tasteless. Or am I missing something? "
1309,Keg corrosion potential of lemon juice adjunct,"I have a recipe for a false cider that requires the addition of lemon juice after secondary fermentation prior to bottling/kegging.  I've done this before in the bottle with good success but I'm wondering -- should I be concerned about the corrosion potential of citric acid against the stainless steel of the keg?  I'm expecting to use the juice from about 4-5 lemons.    Basic Understanding  Stainless steel is not immune from corrosion.     Corrosion and stainless steel? It's stainless, so it should be free from the risk of rust, pitting, and wear, right? Wrong. Although the 300-series stainless steels used in brewing equipment are normally highly resistant to corrosion, their resitance can be compromised in several ways. For example, some of the cleaning and sanitization techniques commonly used with glass and plastic are hazardous to stainless steel, and you can wreck your stainless equipment if you use them.   Some metals such as aluminum actually benefit from interaction with citric acid.  Acids are often used to passivate stainless steel in low concentrations.  Passivation is the process by which the clean surface builds up an oxide layer which protects it to corrosion.     Citric acid can be used for cleaning &amp; passivating stainless steels, as an alternative to nitric acid.   The typical acidity range of beer and cider is safe for stainless.     Beer has a pH of about 4 when fresh, but this can drop to 3.5 or below if the beer is exposed to oxygen such that it sours, as is inevitable in a traditional cask after dispense. Fresh ciders may have a pH as low as 3.3 and, when oxidized, even below 3. Stainless steel is generally impervious to these levels of acidity, but the oxide layer with which aluminum alloys protect themselves from corrosion is attacked by any pH less than about 4 or over about 9.   Based on my findings I'm convinced that short-term contact is completely fine if not even beneficial but I'm curious about the effect of long-term contact of high citric acid concentrations against stainless steel. "
1310,How to prime and bottle?,"apologies for the somewhat newbie question (I can't hide it, this is my first batch and I'm hoping to get it right)!  I have started the Bulldog Evil Dog double IPA kit and although I am still some way off bottling, I would like to get all my queries answered before bottling.   My main lack of knowledge is in priming (I hope I'm using this term correctly) the instructions with the brewing kit suggest 1 carbonation drop or 1 teaspoon of sugar per 500 ml of product.   First of all are there any great differences in these two?   Second - if I were to use sugar, is this just your standard off the shelf granulated white sugar?   Third - should this be added in bulk to the entire batch before bottling and mixed thoroughly?  Fourth - if yes to above, should I then bottle straight away or should that be left to prime for a while longer in the fermenter? I believe the kit mentions this at the bottling stage but wanted to get others experiences!  Please note I don't have a secondary fermenter!   Once again apologies for the newbie questions! Just want to stay this right and tasting great.  Thanks in advance! Gary "
1311,How long will a keg keep?,"We're brewing faster than we can drink. Right now I've got 3 kegs on tap, 1 (primed) keg sitting in the garage (very cold), and 9 carboys ready to be kegged. My question is this -- how long will a primed keg last? Could I keg a beer, purge O2, pressurize with CO2, put it in storage and then put it on tap in 3, 6 or 9 months? If so, should I keep the keg cold? Or does that not matter? Any advice would be great. "
1312,Insulating My Mash Tun,"I have a pretty typical converted keg mash tun. Over the course of a sixty minute mash it loses 8-10º F.  My previous mash tun, a converted cooler would only drop a few degrees and I would like to be able to maintain a consistent temperature.  Instead of direct-firing, running the pump, wasting propane, overshooting the temperature and potentially scorching the wort, I want to insulate the tun.  Requirements:   The insulation should be able to take the heat of a burner It should be easy to clean The temperature of my mash should only drop a few degrees in an hour   How can I better maintain my mash temperature?  Pics   "
1313,Dry Hopping and Crash Cooling,"Should I crash my beer first and then dry hop, or should I dry hop for a week and then crash cool?  My thoughts, I should crash cool and then dry hop.    Reasons:    Less likely to loose aromas at cooler temperatures The beer will be ready to carbonate sooner The cold will assit in preventing spoilage   What are your thoughts? "
1314,Harvesting commercial yeast,"Which commercial beers (local and/or national) are bottle conditioned and still have viable yeast?     Also, what do commercial brewers do that renders the yeast unusable (pasteurization, filtering, too old, etc.)?   Related question about yeast culturing: [website]"
1315,What is conversion?,"While answering another question, about mash temperature, the question about conversion and how long it takes came up.  So what is conversion? I think we all know its the process of enzymes converting the starch in the grain into different types of sugars but if most of the conversion takes place in the first 20 minutes, then why do we mash for 60 minutes or longer? "
1316,When should you buy and plant hop rhizomes?,"I want to grow a couple of hop bines this year.  Most of the online brew supply places say they ship in late March / early April.  I have a feeling I'll still have snow on the ground around that time.  Here in Western PA we typically plant our gardens in early May.  Last year it was mid-late may before the last frost hit and I could get my veggies in the ground.  If I order hop rhizomes and they arrive in early April, how should I store them?  Should I get them in the ground as soon as they arrive, like transplanting a dormant shrub?  Or should I store them in paper bags in the basement like tulip bulbs? "
1317,When is it necessary to pitch fresh yeast for bottle conditioning?,I've read that you can leave an ale to secondary for months and enough yeast will remain in suspension that you won't need to pitch additional yeast when bottling.  But are there times when you do need to pitch more yeast before bottling to ensure you get carbonated beer?  For instance...   What if you crash-cool your ale?  Will the yeast fall out of suspension such that there won't be any left to carbonate your brew in the bottle? What if you started with a high gravity beer and the yeast gave all they had?  Will they be too tired to eat the priming sugar? Are there any other factors that would make it a good idea to pitch more yeast before bottling?  
1318,How do you pitch additional yeast for bottling?,"This is a follow on to my other question about when you would need to pitch additional yeast for bottle conditioning.  Assuming you know that you need to pitch more yeast before bottling to ensure your beer gets carbonated, how do you do it?  What strain do you use?  Do you add it to the bottom of the empty bottling bucket before siphoning the beer from the fermenter, or do you add it to the top of beer after you've already siphoned into the bottling bucket?  Do you need to wait for any amount of time after pitching before filling the bottles? "
1319,Substituting brown sugar for corn sugar,"An apfelwein recipe I've made in the past calls for 2 lbs of corn sugar for primary fermentation.  The next go-round when I make a batch, I'm thinking of substituting some brown sugar (not a lot, perhaps 1 part brown sugar, 3 parts corn sugar).  My question: is corn sugar and brown sugar the same, pound-for-pound, as far as using it for primary fermentation?  Or is there a conversion rate I should follow?  "
1320,When should I add a vanilla bean?,"My wife just kicked a bottle of vanilla extract.  She bakes a lot and buys the good stuff that comes with a bean in it.  I think i want to add the bean to my double-chocolate stout that's in the secondary.  Right now I have the carboy in the fridge trying to get the yeast to settle out.  If I throw the bean in now, will it have any impact, or will the low temps make it a waste of a bean?  Should I throw the bean in whole, or should I chop it up, maybe scrape the caviar out and add the skin and caviar separately?  Should I do anything to sanitize the bean before I add it?  Soak it in vodka then add the bean &amp; vodka? "
1321,How do I predict final gravity?,"I've been taking the original gravity and multiplying the apparent attenuation of the yeast.  For instance:  1.040 OG x 75% apparent attenuation = 1.010 expected FG  But I never seem to get there. My fermentations look really healthy. Are my expectations realistic? Is this just hard to get right?  Here's a real world example:  I made a beer using this recipe:     0.5 lb 40L Caramalt 3.3 lbs extra-light LME  1 lb extra-light DME 1 oz Fuggle @ 60 mins 1 oz Fuggle @ 1 min 0.5 Whirlfloc tab @ 10 mins 0.5 tsp Wyeast yeast nutrient @ 10 mins   Yeast: Wyeast 1098 British Ale  OG: 1.038  Very short lag, healthy-looking initial fermentation with a clean white foam cap that fell back into the beer after three days.    This yeast has an apparent attenuation range of 68-72%.  Thus, I would expect an FG of 1.010 to 1.012.  When I put it in bottles last night, it came in at 1.016.  I appear to be doing everything recommended.  For aeration, I'm pouring through a sieve, then sloshing for five minutes.  Maybe that's the missing link? Or are my expectations too high? "
1322,Brewing with a deadline,"Occasionally I need to brew beer for an event, and I procrastinate. One time, I brewed a pretty hefty IPA, and went from boil to bottle (keg, actually) in about 10 days. It was pretty malty, considering I kegged it at 1.032 or so...  What are some tips for rapid brewing? Any specific yeasts, styles, temperatures, and other techniques for pushing a batch out as fast as possible?  I realize that it's not really in our nature to rush, but rather to relax, sit back, and enjoy a homebrew. However, that being said, how do you brew fast? Consider options where money is and is not an issue. "
1323,Brewing with veggies,"This may be more of a wiki than a specific question, but has anyone ever tried brewing with vegetables?  If so, what is your experience?  I'm considering mostly root vegetables. carrots, beets, turnips, parsnips  Specifically, what is the best way to infuse the flavor, aroma and color of the veg? How much sugar can I expect to extract?  Will that sugar be fermentable? "
1324,Electric Kettle with thermostat,"What's your opinion on them? Have you ever used one? I was thinking of buying one (specially designed for brewing, even has a tap on). How is it different from the more traditional methods? Is it worth the cost? "
1325,Stuck or Slow Fermentation,"So I have my first possible stuck fermentation. First, my recipe:   [website]I pitched with two Wyeast packs of London ESB Ale as recommended by the LBS due to starting gravity. When I finished brewing, I realized that a hydrometer I had bought turned out to be a floating thermometer, so I could not take a first reading. I let it go as normal. Activity was normal for the first few days but never got really bubbling. I chalked this up as my first primary in a bucket vs. a carboy.  After 4 days, bubbling activity really slowed down. I considered adding more fermentables, but I had at least 5lbs of liquid malt extract plus my grains. I also find it hard to imagine that with two smack packs, the yeast didn't take off (I also aerated my wort before pitching and let the smack packs inflate for a few hours).   Today is day 8 and I picked up a hydrometer last night and took a reading. It is currently sitting at a gravity reading of 1.015, estimated at 2% ABV. My target is 5.5% ABV. Do I possibly have a stuck fermentation? What should I do, besides wait it out a few more days and take another reading?  EDIT: In my haste, I failed to check the temperature of my sample. My hydrometer is accurate at 60 degrees F. I will take a second sample and repost the new results.  UPDATE: 2nd reading at 60 was very close to the original. Maybe 1.018 for the gravity. I guess I can't figure out my ABV without an original reading but I can take another reading in a few days and see if it's still fermenting? "
1326,Why would a recipe use both Light LME and Light DME?,"I just brewed a clone of Belhaven Scottish Ale using the extract recipe from the book, Clone Brews.  The recipe calls for both light LME and light DME.  Why would it use both?  It does specify brands of each to use.  Might the recipe be taking into account the particular flavor of each extract from the different brands, or is there something more obvious I'm missing? "
1327,Should I & how do I use a mash tun brew kettle with a false bottom?,"I'd like to make the move to all-grain, but it's fairly equipment-intensive. I see combination mash tuns and brew kettles. Are these a solution? Can I use the kettle for mashing, then transfer to another container, clean this one out, and re-use it for a brew kettle? That sort of seems like asking for hot-side aeration and hassle?  If they're not reusable, they just seem like an expensive replacement for a 10 gallon Igloo cooler with false bottom, right? "
1328,Open-Fermented or Native Yeast Beers,"I've always been very careful about control and sanitation with beer.  But with my wine I do some native yeast Pinots, and some friends of mine are into the same with beers-  they like funky, sometimes sour, open-fermented farmhouse ales &amp; Saisons or even some California knock-offs of the same.  Sometimes I think there's something there, other times I think they're nasty.  With wine, you have native yeast that's specific to the vineyard and lives on the skins of the grapes.  It's not all that risky because of the biology-- wine yeast thrives where there's food, and grapes provide it, generally.  But beer made in my garage is a different thing entirely.  I would think there's not much coming in on the grain hulls, and the wort boil kills whatever's there.  So I would think whatever native yeast I get is coming from... well.. my garage.  I'm not too into rat s#!t beer.  So how do you do a farmhouse-style ale at home without inoculating?  And can I just leave the airlock off my carboy and get a half-decent end result? "
1329,Recipe Sharing Sites,"In a few of the meta questions on this site, and in other discussions, the main thing lacking on BrewAdvice.com is the ability to share recipes. While questions about a specific recipe fit very well - such as ""Is this enough malt [recipe]"" - questions like ""Do you like this recipe?"" or ""Anyone have a good recipe for [style]"" do not quite fit this format.  So, my question is two-fold.    What are some sites you like to share / find recipes? What is it that you like about that site? Other feedback, etc.  More generally, what are some things you look for in a recipe site, and more specifically, what are some things you look for in a recipe site that you haven't found yet?    If there is enough lack of features in sites out there today, maybe I'll build a new one. Better mousetrap, if you will.  Thanks! "
1330,Flavor extracts - add to secondary or add during bottling?,"What are the pros and cons of adding flavor extracts (fruit, chocolate, what have you) at bottling time versus adding them to the secondary?  Does it make a difference?  Is there a trade-off between one versus the other? "
1331,Gravity Measurement Tools,"What tools for measuring specific gravity are available to the homebrewer? EG: refractometer, hydrometer.  What scale do they measure? EG: Brix, plato    Since there hasn't been much activity on the question, this is what I'm looking for. Any more comprehensive answers?   Hydrometer measures Specific Gravity Refractometers are usually scaled in % Brix Bottles measure Specific Gravity  "
1332,Immersion chiller or counter-flow chiller?,"Based on your actual experience with each, what are the pros and cons of the two most common types of wort chillers - immersion and counter-flow?  Which do you prefer? "
1333,What is a whirlpool chiller?,What is a Whirlpool Chiller and how does it work?  What are the advantages or disadvantages? 
1334,What is Extract Twang?,"This term pops up from time to time and it often cited as a reason to go to all grain.  But maybe its because I don't really know what it tastes like.  Do you believe in extract twang? How do you get rid of it, aside from all-grain brewing? Can you get rid of it? "
1335,Using Multiple Strains of Yeast in the Same Batch?,"I've been thinking about this recently, so I figured I'd ask it here. Is there any reason you couldn't use two strains of yeast in the same batch of beer? For a particularly high gravity amber ale, for example, is there any reason I couldn't pitch 5g worth of American Ale and American Ale II? I've seen it before where people will split a batch, pitch Brett lambicus into one fermenter and Brett bruxellensis into another fermenter and then later blend both batches into one for secondary, but I haven't seen other instances of this with non-Brett yeast. This is more musing than practical, so I anticipate getting some down votes, but I figured I would put it here anyway. "
1336,Why would OG be significantly higher than predicted?,"I know there are several questions on the forum about OG being lower than predicted.  Please bear with me though.  I'm at a loss.  I just brewed a straightforward extract wheat beer recipe.  The fermentables were:   0.5 lb Crystal 60L, steeped in 0.5 gallons 150F water for 20 minutes, sparged (rinsed) with 0.5 gallons 150F water 5.5 lb Briess light DME 0.5 lb Briess wheat DME   My recipe listed the OG as 1.051-1.053.  Beer Calculus puts it at 1.055.  My OG reading came in at 1.090.  That's really, really high.  What gives.  Here's what I can rule out:   Inaccurate hydrometer.  I tested it in 60F water and it reads 1.000. Added too much DME.  I quadrouple checked.  I used a 5 lb sack of light DME from Austin Homebrew.  I measured another 0.5 lb, and measured out 0.5 lb of wheat DME.  I did not weigh the 5 lb sack to ensure it was 5 lbs.  The label does say 5 lb. Final volume - I used 5.5 gallons of spring water today - 2.5 in the boil, 3 to top off the fermenter.   Possible causes:   Hop debris.  I did not filter the wort when pouring it into the fermenter.  The sample I took for the OG had a lot of pellet hop debris in it.  Could this provide lift to the hydrometer? Poorly mixed wort.  I poured the 2.5 gallons of cooled wort into the fermenter then added 3 gallons of bottled spring water.  Maybe it wasn't thoroughly mixed?   Have you ever seen this issue?  I could understand a few points, but 35 points? "
1337,Fruit for fruit beers,What are the best fruits for brewing fruit beers? Some fruits appear to be classics like cherries raspberries.  Some fruits you rarely hear about like kiwi and papya.  Which fruits have flavor profiles strong enough to add to beers and which don't? 
1338,"Forgot 1 piece to a 3 piece airlock, is this recoverable?","Last weekend I brewed my first batch of beer.  I ordered the kit back in April because there was a Groupon and stuck the yeast in the fridge until I needed it.  Its been a week and I haven't seen any bubbling in the air lock, so I was thinking the yeast didn't make it.  However there is a lot of pressure in the fermenter because when I touch the lid I can feel that there is gas in there, and today I saw that the top was not fully locked in anymore.  So now I think that the air lock is just not working.  I went to YouTube and saw a video for the airlock that I have.  It turns out I didn't put on all of the pieces.  I have a 3 piece airlock ([website]Is this a big problem or by putting the top on now everything will be ok?  I figured the water was there to prevent the wild yeasts and bacteria from getting in there.  Is that a safe assumption?  Is this why I don't see bubbling or is it more likely that the yeast didn't last that long, even though it was in the fridge? "
1339,Controlling exothermic heat from primary fermentation with A/C cooling duct,"In terms of brewing with Ale yeasts, I understand that fermenter temps can increase up to 10 degrees, or more, than the ambient room temperature. As a ""cheap"" method for keeping the temperature of the fermenter as close as possible to the ambient temperature of the room, can I simply set the fermenter on a cooling duct? It would seem logical that the large surface area on the bottom of the fermenter would allow sufficient heat transfer to exchange at least some of the excess heat away from the fermenter.  Has anyone tried this before or can categorically state that this method is useless or shouldn't be attempted due to negative effects? While, perhaps, questionable in it's overall effectiveness, I can't think of anything that could potentially be detrimental to the yeast or fermentables using this method (assuming, of course, that the temperature is still within acceptable range for the yeast). "
1340,When to harvest wild hops?,"Hi there fellow brewmasters! I have recently moved to all-grain brewing after two years of brewing with hopped extracts. The results are pretty good, and the whole process is a lot of fun, but I am trying to find some good variation to the recipes I have tried so far.  While jogging, I have found out that hops are endemic in my area. Obviously, they are totally wild and there's no hope of knowing their exact AA percentage, however I am planning to estimate it through the tea method. I am planning to harvest a good lot of these hops and dry or freeze them, so that if they are good I can grow them or brew some batches before they run out.   Now, the problem is that I don't know the right time for harvesting, thus I am asking for your advice. The hops are now walnut-sized and bright green, but they are not particularly aromatic (I will update a picture this afternoon if I have time to go for a walk). Last year I found a plant with very aromatic hops, so I would wait some more to let them develop.  What do you suggest?  Thank you, Tunnuz "
1341,What does high attentuation actually mean in terms of types of sugar fermented?,"So, when I fermented a cider it ended up very dry. I used champagne yeast and only added pure glucose. I then added lactic sugar since I knew that wasn't fermentable by the yeast I used.  I also have understood (though I might be mistaken) that we can produce a higher final gravity by using malt with more complex sugars. Again, this is common sense.  I am confused however, by measurements of a yeasts ""attentuation"". It seems illogical to me that I would end up with FG 8 if I have a solution of water, nutrients, correct pH and 40 SG of pure glucose and pitch a yeast that has 80% attentuation since glucose is completely fermentable, right?  What I am asking is this: Does attentuation depend as much on the type of sugars as the type of yeast, or maybe actually more on the sugars used? "
1342,Dry hopping a double IPA,"So if I do a secondary fermentation for a double IPA and transfer it to a carboy(better bottle)  should I use a steeping bag?, or is it better to keep it in the primary fermenter and add the dry hops there and not use secondary fermentation? "
1343,Cherry vinegar (was supposed to be mead),"Last week I started a cherry mead and discovered yesterday that it had turned to vinegar (and not even nice-tasting cherry-flavoured vinegar - it smelled and tasted awful, though the colour was great). I'm not sure how this happened, so I'm posting what I did in the hopes that someone can diagnose the problem before I try again.   Boil 4 litres (I make mead in a 5L jar on my kitchen counter - my apartment is not big enough for rows of carboys!) of water for 25 minutes. Reduce heat to below boiling and add 1 kg (about 1L) of honey (plain, Billy Bee honey). Remove scum from surface until no more scum forms. Add 500 ml of washed, diced, pitted black cherries (tied up in a cheesecloth) to the water and honey Add 750 ml of black cherry juice (bought at a nearby health-food store), because I didn't have very many cherries left. Simmer for about 20 minutes. Cool, add to fermentation jar, pitch yeast (Lalvin champagne yeast).   An observation: this batch fermented far faster and far more vigorously and violently than any other batch! Almost all of the sugar was consumed by fermentation within 4 days. In all my other batches, it typically took 8 to 12 days for this much sugar to be consumed.  I have used this variants of this process (minus the fruit), steps 1 - 3 and 7 for almost a dozen batches (all successful so far) over the past two years, so I'm thinking the problem was in the fruit.  This was actually my second fruit mead - the first one was with strawberries, and they were thrown in at the beginning of the process (Step 1, when boiling the water), I thought it would be important to sterilize them. I later read that fruit should not be boiled, or pectin would form and result in a very cloudy mead (and yes, the strawberry mead was tasty but also cloudy), and also possibly affect the flavour.  So I've been wondering about where the failure was:   The cherries - Should they have been boiled, or sterilized in some other way? I have also read recipes that involve putting the cherries in during fermentation but to me that seems to carry an even greater risk of infection from outside sources.   Would I have better luck with frozen cherries (or other fruit), assuming that the frozen fruit is somehow sterilized before it's frozen?  The cherry juice - It was supposed to have been pasteurized, but I admit I opened it a little before I made the mead, just to taste it. Bad luck?? Something else in this process that I missed?   It was also suggested to me by a friend that cinnamon has antibacterial properties so I should put 1 or 2 sticks in when boiling the water (they also said the juice of one lime would work as well, but I'm not sure about that and I worry it would have a strong impact on the flavour). "
1344,Jugs for secondary?,"I happened upon a bunch of 4L glass wine jugs today while dumpster-diving for beer bottles.    The jugs I found have screw-top lids, and I thought they could be useful as secondary fermenters. If I split up my 5 gal of beer into 5 of these jugs, I should be able to let it hang out in there for a few weeks before I bottle. These are clear glass bottles, but they would be stored in a dark crawl space, so I shouldn't have to worry about skunking.  Does this sound like a reasonable plan? Is there some problem I might encounter by having the beer in multiple locations (e.g. oxidation)? Or could there be a problem with the screw-top lid?  "
1345,How much hop bitterness dissipates with time?,"I am planning to age a big Russian Imperial Stout for about a year.   I understand that during this time, the bitterness imparted by the hops will dissipate.  If I want to maintain a balance, I'll need to overshoot my bitterness somewhat.  How much bitterness should I expect to lose in a year? 5%? 25%? half? "
1346,Clarification for a low-flocculating yeast,"I'm brewing a batch using WY2565 Kolsch which mentions that is low-flocculating and that it ""remain in suspension post fermentation. It requires filtration or additional settling time to produce bright beers.""  I was planning to rack to secondary and add finings as mentioned in another post (I did not mention the yeast I was using). In one response, it was brought up that using fresh and healthy yeast mitigates the need for these extra measures.  In my case, I had purchased the yeast just the day prior to brewing, and LHBS had received it that same day. The wort was very well aerated, which I understand should help give me healthy yeast. With that information, is it going to be necessary to take measures to drop the yeast out? If so, how should I deal with it? Some sort of finings such as gelatin? Cold-crash? The Wyeast profile mentions filtration--I'm not too familiar with that process; is that something I should look into? Or is the additional settling time mentioned sufficient? "
1347,Bottle-priming post secondary fining?,"   Possible Duplicate:   Cold Crash and Finings       As mentioned in this question, I'm anticipating some trouble with a low-flocculating yeast, and one of the suggestions was to use gelatin for fining in the secondary.  I am planning to bottle-condition these beers, and my understanding is that while for bottle conditioning one hopes for about 1,000,000 cells per mL, that finings such as gelatin and isinglass have the ability to bring me down to about 10,000 cells per mL.  One additional piece of information is that this is a low-flocculating Kolsch yeast, so I wonder if the effect will be as significant.  Do I need to worry about having an under-carbonated beer if I use gelatin on a low-flocculating yeast? Would I need to compensate with additional priming sugar, or some fresh yeast, or some other measures? "
1348,Berliner Weisse not souring,"About 6 weeks ago, I made a simple Berliner Weisse. When I put it into primary, I pitched both yeast and the lactobacillus. It's been sitting in the primary ever since.  Yesterday, I took a taste sample because I'm wondering when I should bottle it. The sour character was pretty much non-existant.  I realize that sour character can take a while to develop. What I'm wondering is how I should wait for that to develop. Do I leave it in the fermenter for a few more months (will it carbonate at that point?)? If I bottle it now, will that develop in the bottle? If so, will that lead to bottle bombs? "
1349,Carastan substitute?,"I recently brewed a recipe that called for Carastan malt. My LHBS didn't carry it, so I just used 40 L Crystal. In the finished beer, I'm missing the toffee and toastiness found in the original. Does anyone know of a better substitute? If there aren't really any good substitutes, where is a good place that I can find it online? "
1350,How to dry harvested fresh hops?,"This question is a direct consequence of the When to harvest wild hops? one. I have heard about various techniques to do it: sun-drying, warm rooms plus paper bags to capture their humidity, ovens etc. What's your suggestion? If you suggest an oven, can you specify the ideal temperature and drying time?  Update I have built a dehydrator with a very small amount of money. Basically it is composed by four disconnected wooden frames onto which I have nailed a metal mosquito net. It works like a charm! "
1351,Oatmeal stout: Steeping or mash?,"Ladies and Gentlemen of Homebrewing, I was cruising my Google+ account, and I am stalking (I mean following/stalking) Wil Wheaton, and I noticed he is a homebrewer!  Tonight he posted a question.  I directed him here, however I doubt that he would read my post, so perhaps you all could head over to Wil Wheaton's Google+ Profile and help him out.  He asks:     I'm making an oatmeal stout for Jaime Paglia, and I'm trying to figure out the best time to put in the oats. This will be a partial mash, using extract for the base and some steeped specialty grains.      I can't find consensus on the usual forums. Some brewers say to put the oats (about 1 pound for a 5 gallon batch) in with the steeping grains. Others say you have to mash the grains with some 2 row, but don't say how much 2 row you should use, and how to scale back the extract if you go that way. I'm not afraid to do that kind of mashing (yay! experience!), but it's easier to use extract, so that's my preference at this point in my evolution as a brewer.      So I was thinking that I'd use the basic stout recipe I have, and I'd toast a pound of quick oats in the oven first, then steep them with the specialty grains when they were all toasty and golden and good.      I'm very interested to hear opinions on this, and I thank you all in advance for sharing whatever experience you've had.   You may also want to check out some of his other homebrew related posts. "
1352,Possibly infected mead: is it worth keeping?,"I tried making cherry mead again (the first time I tried this it got infected). I tried again yesterday, and it looks like I've got some sort of contamination (""infection"").  This time I thought that everything was OK, at first. The foam that I usually see from yeast fermentation appeared within 30 minutes of pitching the yeast, but when I got home tonight, it was the much more vigorous bubbling that I saw along the surface. Specific gravity went from 1.076 to 1.028 in a little more than 24 hours. The taste is a bit off - not as bad as last time, but not as good as it should be.   Things I did differently from last time:    No fresh cherries, just pasteurized cherry juice. The juice bottle was only opened moments before adding it to the must. Added two cinnamon sticks with the cherry juice (for supposed antibacterial properties) I brought everything up to the boiling point for a few minutes before letting it cool and pitching the yeast. Sealed a plastic bag over the top of the fermentation jar (to keep out fruit flies).   This is the second time it's happened... I'm guessing now that it's either the cherry juice itself (supposed to be pasteurized, but who knows), the equipment (it's all glass and stainless steel, but one food-safe plastic piece - maybe that one needs to go?), something in the air?, ...maybe the yeast is bad?  Anyway, I'm going to throw a few campden tablets in there and then put it in the fridge to chill. Does anything think this can be saved? I know I'd have to re-pasteurize it and add more honey or sugar - or is infected must not even salvageable?    Update:  I saw that it was still slightly bubbling in the fridge this morning. That's after I put in 3 campden tablets (The guy at the wine store said 2 is usually enough for under 5 litres) and left it in the fridge overnight. It's either very hardy yeast or a very hardy infection. I'm not going to give up hope yet, I'll test it again when I get home tonight.    Second Update:  Just tested it again. Specific Gravity is only down to 1.026 so not much fermentation has happened in the last 24 hours, I guess the bubbling this morning (and even this evening) was just gas that was already there being released. The surface is still clear (save for small clusters of bubbles) and the taste is not as bad as yesterday. The smell is like sour cherries though (and I used sweet black cherry juice!).     So guess I most of the panic was due to my inexperience with fruit meads, and not knowing what to expect. I'm guessing the cherry juice was a very good yeast nutrient - I'm used to pitching dry yeast without adding nutrients or energizers, so I guess I was just surprised by the vigorous and intense reaction I got here, as well as the sudden and strange change in taste and smell.    2012-01-13  So I finally had one of these bottles yesterday. It was nice but the cherry flavour was very mild, much more so that I thought it would. Next time, I think I will use at least 50-50 blend of sour cherry and black cherry juices (or all sour cherry), and use much more juice and much less water.  "
1353,Fruit Beer: When to rack to secondary?,"Right now, I'm working on a peach wheat beer. I pitched about 5 days ago now, and the airlock stopped bubbling yesterday. I'm going to do a gravity reading later on today to see if it's finished. My current plan is to rack the beer onto the peaches in secondary, which I've seen recommended in several places. My question is, how long should I wait between primary fermentation finishing and racking onto the fruit? I know right now the yeast should be cleaning up after its self in the primary, and if I wasn't going to be adding more sugar (in the form of fruit) in, I'd definitely leave it alone for a while. But, since its about to go ferment again, should I give it time, or can it do clean up once it's done fermenting the peaches? "
1354,does starsan kill yeast,"Is Starsan effective against yeast?  After resuming homebrewing again after a 2 year break, I started having pellicle appearing on my starters (after fermentation had completed), which has now spread to my plastic fermenting buckets so that the last 3 batches have been contaminated (""infected"") - looking similar to this. The beer tastes fine, maybe slightly sour-sweaty. I plan to clean and sanitize all my equipment that's used post boil. I normally use Starsan to sanitize, but clearly the wild yeast are not affected. The made up starsan reads 2.8-3.0 on the pH meter.  Would iodophor or bleach be a better solution to get rid of this unwanted visitor? "
1355,What are the advantages and disadvantages of transferring to a secondary vs. a long primary?,"The conventional wisdom in homebrewing has been challenged in recent years.  This wisdom held that a beer should be transferred from the primary fermentation vessel to a secondary one after 7-10 days.  In recent years, many homebrewers have advocated for leaving the beer in primary until packaging, rather than racking to a secondary fermenter.    What are the advantages and disadvantages of the two methods? Are there limits to how long a beer should remain in primary, in the long primary scenario? "
1356,How to estimate yeast starter viability when using stir plate?,"I have just started a transition to making yeast starters and also using a homemade stir plate and am curious how to estimate the viability of the yeast when using this method. Normally, there are definite, visible signs when using an airlock, but how does one judge the level of attenuation when the yeast and wort are constantly moving? Is it primarily by color, viscosity, foam or some combination of all of them?  I've prepared a 1000ml 1030-1040 starter with Wyeast 1057 in a room ~ 72F. After 12 hours, I see a 1/4"" foam ring at the top of the wort. Is this what I should be seeing and is there a more systematic way to gauge when it's ready to pitch. I have read a lot of conflicting advice about the length required on the stir plate and would like to be able to understand what guidelines others typically follow.  -bill    "
1357,Dry malting - a crazy idea?,"A lot of talk is about dry-hopping in order to bring out the aroma of hops lost during the boiling process. Could a similar approach be used for malt? That is, could the addition of crushed grains to the primary/secondary change the aroma profile of a beer?  Of course, you would have to find some way of sterilizing the grains first (I don't know, steaming?) but would this work?. Has anyone tried it?  Crazy thought for Sunday. "
1358,Is it normal for one side of a two-piece (s-shaped) airlock to be empty during fermentation?,"I have always used either a blowoff tube or a three-piece airlock (one with the small, floating cap on the exhaust tube) for fermentation. Today's batch is my first using the two-piece (S-shaped) airlock. I filled both chambers to the max line marked on each tube and noticed that, after several hours, the sanitizer from one of the chambers has almost completely transferred to the other side, with only a small amount of sanitizer remaining in the U-bend beneath the two chambers. Is this normal for two-piece airlocks? Should I pull it out and refill again with sanitizer or vodka so both sides are equal in volume?  -bill  "
1359,Evaporation rate,"Right now, when brewing, I have one step that is never the same : the boil. Actually, the boil phase is going alright, my problem is with the evaporation rate of my wort. I have a few questions...   What is the ""standard"" boil rate? Beersmith gives me 12% per hour by default. This is based on a 23 liters batch I think. That would mean an evaporation of 2.73 liters per hour, but normally I lose at least twice that amount. What if I make a 40 liters batch? will evaporation be 12%, or the same liters/hour? (In this case it would mean an evaporation rate of 6.8%) What are the advantages of a higher evaporation rate ? What are the advantages of a lower evaporation rate ? Is my evaporation rate way too high at 6 liters / hour?   And one big question here:   How do you standardize your evaporation rate? I never evaporate the same amount, but I would like that part becoming a constant, not a variable.   I am using a propane outside burner. Should I get something to regularize the psi of the propane?  Thanks! "
1360,Fruit mead - VERY vigorous fermentation,"I have made several batches of meads, using different yeasts, with the same recipe.  I then picked the yeast that made the best mead (IMO) and made some fruit meads.  I followed the same recipe, but added a jar of fresh fruit preserve to each batch (one raspberry, one blackberry).  These are one-gallon batches.  The carboys ended up pretty full, and I couldn't add the whole yeast mixture.  This worried me, as I wasn't sure if I would get enough fermentation.  However, my carboys keep popping the lids on the airlocks, and fermentation has been frighteningly fast.  I have poured out a small amount of each batch to make some more airspace in the bottles, and it just filled up with foam again.  I have fruity foam erupting out through the airlocks, more so in one batch than the other, and I keep removing them to clean and replace.  It's only 3 days into what usually is a 2-week fermentation process, and they have finally slowed down (to a stop, I think, which doesn't seem right), and I'm not sure if something went horribly wrong, or if this is normal for a fruit mead.  And finally, I have mold on the top of the airlock of one of the batches now.  (Horrible green-black stuff) where it is exposed to air.  This doesn't seem to have penetrated the carboy though.  Is this batch savable?  Is this normal for fruity meads?  Have I done something wrong, and if so, can I fix it at this point?  Has fermentation stalled, or actually finished?  And will the speed of that fermentation ruin my mead? "
1361,Can you help me read this complex Yeast recipe? (Sour Beer help),"I'm reading a recipe for a Sanctification clone, which is one of Russian Rivers Blonde Sour Ales. The recipe for the yeast read as such  Brettanomyces bruxellensis culture, Wyeast 3112 or White Labs WLP650 (3 qt./ starter)  Brettanomyces lambicus culture Wyeast 3526 or White Labs WLP653 (1 qt/ starter)  Lactobasillus delbrueckii culture, Wyeast 4335 bacteria (3 oz/ starter)  Then it instructs to ""pitch bottom half"" of yeast starters. Ferment starting at 72 degrees.  Any ideas on what any of this means? If I'm only pitching the bottom half, then how much exactly is ""the bottom half""? "
1362,When should I secondary this beer,"I have an Oktoberfest beer in Primary right now based on a kit from my LHBS.  It's an average ABV ~5.5 and is fermented on California Lager Yeast and I'm controlling fermentation at ~62F.   Will this benefit from secondary and if so, any thoughts on how long?  Lastly, as I still bottle condition, any differences due to lager yeast? "
1363,How long to mature and clear with Top Tap Barrel?,"Once, initial and secondary fermentation are complete, how long should the barrel be left to clear and mature? I understand that with a bottom tap barrel you have to wait for the entire, barrel to clear, but my understanding is that with the top tap barrel you always take from the top layer and so is the time before beginning to consume reduced? "
1364,Maturation temperature (when SG stabilizes),"Some guys recommend to increase the temperature once the fermentation finished, and so, ""start"" the maturation in a higher temperature. Others say the inverse, to reduce the temperature.   I already tried the 2 techniques, but changing only among 2C to 4C degrees (35F to 37F), and I cannot get a noticeable difference between than.  What is the care we need to have with the temperature when the maturation starts (FG stabilizes) ? Keep it, increase it, or reduce it ?  EDIT - Defining ""maturation"":  Maturation, secondary fermentation, conditioning, aging, in English some people use one, others use another. But I'm referring to the phase just after SG doesn't change anymore (about 3-4 days in Ales) and the yeasts start to eat 'undesired compounds', in Portuguese its's called solely ""maturation"". "
1365,Stout has acetaminophen (tylenol) aftertaste,"TL;DR : My beer has an acetaminophen aftertaste, what could this be ?  I brewed an espresso oatmeal Stout 4 months ago. It had a hard time carbonating and has an acrid/bitter (burnt? too much dark malt?) aftertaste. It mellowed a bit with time. To me, this aftertaste now resembles acetaminophen (without the coating, just the white stuff, which is pretty bitter).  Recipe : [website]"
1366,Is brewers' Lactobacillus heterofermentative or homofermentative?,"I have only used 'natural' lactobacillus, that is, inoculated wort with raw grains to achieve a very tart sour. In my last experiment, I soured a mash over a few days and the gravity had dropped from 1.042 to 1.008 without ever having added yeast. I ended up just adding yeast, since I was hoping to retain some of the alcohol content (rather than boiling first to stop the lactic acid production). In the end it was more of a lacto-lemonade, as it had a great sour taste, but little to no alcohol (1.008 -> 1.004, plus whatever was there from the sour). I couldn't think of any other way to ""test"", so I just downed two pints, but to no effect :-) In doing some reading here, I discovered some lactobacillus actually does create alcohol, but I suspect this is not true of the brewers' type, as Wyeast doesn't mention any attenuation. However, White Labs, here and here do mention attenuation, so perhaps the white labs strains are heterofermentative? Or perhaps they are simply referring to the apparent attenuation of the sugars (as the lacto definitely eats through them)? "
1367,Cleaning stainless steel,"I bought an used stainless steel really large pot (>90 liters) that was used for cooking, but had some kind of water stains inside.  On a (stupid) attempt to clean it, I had it sand blasted, which completely removed that nice, reflective surface that the stainless steel have, leaving an opaque darkish gray surface.  Is this fixable somehow, maybe by polishing or chemical treatment? If its not, is it still safe to use it?  Update. This is what it looks like now:   "
1368,Flat beer with table sugar?,"I brewed this Ale Oktoberfest beer and I thought everything went perfectly, but the bottles are flat (have tried 4 of them)  Some details:   2 weeks in the primary 1 week in secondary (5 gal carboy) FG of 1.012 Priming solution: boiled &amp; cooled solution of 5 oz. table sugar, mixed well into bottling bucket.   The bottles have sat for 3 weeks.  They started out at over 70 but lately it has been cooler and they have been around 65 degrees.  I asked my homebrew shop and they said the problem is likely that I used table sugar instead of corn sugar.  They said that disaccharides are harder to break down than straight glucose and maybe the yeast just couldn't do it.  However, looking online it seems lots of people use table sugar.  This is my second batch, for my first batch I also used table sugar and it had perfect carbonation.  Here are all the possible problems that I can imagine:   Too much yeast dropped out after secondary fermentation, so not enough was left in suspension to carbonate? (counterpoint: 3 weeks is not very long, if anything it's on the shorter side) Maybe they indeed had trouble with the disaccharide sugar (or maybe combination of 1 and 2) During my first batch I used vegan sugar from Whole Foods, my second batch I used Domino sugar I pitched the yeast a little warm (80-85 degrees).  But the bottles have mostly been conditioning around 65.  Maybe fermentation encouraged the growth of more yeast that preferred the warmer temp, and they don't like the cooler bottling temp.   Possible solutions:   Bring bottles up to 70 degrees, wait longer Pour everything into bottling bucket, add CBC yeast and 5 oz. corn sugar solution, rebottle.  (Problem with this: if the initial priming sugar was never fermented, would this create bottle bombs once healthy yeast is re-introduced?  Would the priming sugar cause a measurable change in gravity, so that I could measure whether it fermented?)   Any other advice or thoughts?  Update  I have a few more data points:   I tried more bottles: some have a tiny amount of fizz, others practically flat. Immediately after bottling, 4 bottles went down to Virginia.  When they were opened, they were all carbonated, with a head even.   I performed the following experiment:   I opened two 22 oz. bottles and added 1/4 tsp CBC yeast rehydrated in 1 1/2 tsp water To one of these bottles I also added a solution of 3/4 tsp corn sugar    One week later, both were carbonated.  The one with sugar more than the other, and maybe a tad overcarbonated but not by much.  I plan to add the same amount of yeast and 1/2 tsp corn sugar to the remaining bottles.  Thank you everyone for your help and suggestions.  I'm not sure if there is one answer I can accept but I will read through them again and see.  Update #2  Here I was ready to add a yeast / sugar solution to each bottle.  It has now been 7 weeks in the bottle and I last tried one maybe 2 weeks ago and was still pretty much flat.  I opened 7 bottles to re-yeast, all of them were carbonated. SMH. "
1369,How can I filter out excess cream (trub) before bottling?,"I'm making a cream ale and just moved it into a new carboy for secondary fermentation.  While siphoning it over, I noticed that there's a lot of solid creamy substance still in the beer.  Maybe I did something wrong and that's not supposed to happen (not enough water in the original boil?), but what's done is done.  My question is that, if it's still present after my secondary fermentation is complete, how can I make sure to filter out all that nonsense before going to the bottling phase?  It seemed like a kind of buttery substance that clung to the auto-siphon. "
1370,Best position to install a bi-metal thermometer,"Of course I'm asking about the height. How to calculate the best height to install a bi-metal thermometer like this: Dial Thermometer - MoreBeer ?  Usually, we can see it installed in the middle of wort, approximately. But if we mash several volumes, should we calculate the middle of the smallest one ? This wouldn't harm the thermal reading of the largest wort volume ? "
1371,Can I reuse a failed starter?,"The proprietor at my LHBS gave me an unsold Wyeast 1968 smack pack that was well over a year old. I made a starter for it just to see if it was still viable. It was not viable.  Now I need to make a WLP001 starter for a batch I'm brewing this weekend, and I'd like to use this failed starter for that. My understanding is that dead yeast make for good nutrition for active yeast. Would it be a bad idea to add a little water to the failed starter, boil it for 10 minutes, and use it for the WLP001 starter? "
1372,Hop photoisomerization (light effect on transparent bottles),"Very little information can be found around internet about ""photoisomerization"" in beers. This is a chemical reaction on acids of hops if exposed to the light, such as in transparent bottles.  I could find that the visible light of blue frequency only, and the invisible light UV (only), can cause photoisomerization, but it isn't widely known neither are consensus about that.  Someone could confirm that ? Or give more detailed information about the light frequencies that can cause photoisomerization ?  Assuming that just UV + blue light can cause it, I have a lot of questions like:   Why UV and blue light filters aren't used to non-brown bottles keeping the beer protected against the photoisomerization ? Just costs ? What are in brown bottles that can filter UV ? What is their efficiency to filter UV and blue light ?  "
1373,Ale is cloudy and really fizzy,"I tried my very first home brew kit recently. I don't recall the specific brand, but it was a 'Newkie Brown' kit that came in a tin and was like black treacle to start with (e.g. a syrup not a powder or something, not sure what other types are to start with...)  I followed the instructions pretty accurately. I made up 23 litres of the liquid and left it for 6 days in the bucket (as per the instructions). The instructions said it should be kept at between 18 and 20 degrees (centigrade) - the only space I had big enough was the boiler cupboard and the temp unfortunately hovered around 22 degrees. I used brewers sugar in the first stage.  The next stage was to bottle the beer and leave at room temp for 2 weeks. I bottled up 48 bottles and have them in a kitchen cupboard - should be pretty room temp-ish. I used regular granulated sugar in this stage.  As I say, I followed the instructions to what I consider pretty well (other than the temp, which was only a few degrees out), but today, after leaving them for two weeks in the bottle as described, the beer is extremely fizzy, i.e. when I open a bottle a great big jet of it sprays out (like opening Champagne). It's not super fizzy when drinking it, although I can see a small stream of bubbles rising from one spot at the bottom.  Secondly, the beer is not clear and the instructions said it was ready when it was clear. Also, it's not just a bit cloudy, it's entirely opaque.  It tastes OK - no weird twangs or bad aftertaste or anything. All of the equipment - bucket, siphoning kit, bottles, stirrer, etc, were all thoroughly sterilized.  Does it need more time and then it will clear? Did I do something badly wrong and it will never clear? Could the increased first stage temp be the cause? Are the kits a waste of time? "
1374,Pot or cooler based mash tun?,What's the pros and cons about mash in coolers or pots? How to choose? 
1375,Efficiently sterilizing bottles,"I've got 50 bottles to sterilize tonight but unfortunately have an extraordinarily small sink which can only fit 4 bottles at a time.  The sterilizer I have (bruclens cleaner) requires everything to be soaked for 10 minutes so I was wondering...   If I just made the sterilizer came in to contact with all of the bottle could I just leave it for 10 minutes before rinsing?  This is similar to what the instructions say for cleaning the fermentation bucket. Is putting the bottles in the oven as effective as using a sterilizer? I'll be sterilizing my bottling bucket at the same time, can I put a load of bottles in there at the same time?   I'm aware I could use star san or something similar but I won't be able to pick that up in time for bottling up tonight. "
1376,How does the attenuation limit from mash temperature affect yeast attenuation?,"Like, for example, if you select a yeast with an average attenuation of 80%, but you mash at 160, which limits attenuation to 76.8%1, would the limit simply be the lower of the limit or the average attenuation? (76.8) or would you multiply the limits?

1377,I forgot to put water in the airlock! What do I do now?,"I did my first brew (all grain), some things were complicated to achieve and finished at 4 o'clock in the morning because I decided to start at 10 pm (big mistake).   At the end of it all, after I sanitize equipment and put the wort in the fermenter bucket, I sealed and placed the arilock.   Only to realize that I did not put water in the airlock after only seven days of fermentation!   What can I do now? A second fermentation? Set everything out and redo my beer?   The airlock (""S"" type) that I use is this: [website]"
1378,carbonating using a soda stream,"Has anybody tried carbonating a couple of bottles a little early in the priming period - you know, just because guests are coming by and that batch is a little young in the bottle?  I've heard it can be very messy, but if the pressure is released very slowly it can be done. Another question is how does it compare to bottle priming?  Any experience before I paint the walls with beer? "
1379,Does beer make you stupid?,I read somewhere that people who drink beer get more stupid.  Is that true? Does beer kill brain cells or what? 
1380,Tea-like aroma in my beer,"Last week, I decided to make a simple pale ale. I wanted something fairly light, not too bitter, and with a hint of caramel. I had some CTZ and Simcoe hops in the freezer so I wanted to use those in this brew. I am not an expert by any means, but below is what I came up with. Notice that all the hops were added with 20 minutes or less. The aroma addition was at flameout with a 15-minute hop stand before chilling. I intended to use pale malt but at the last moment decided to use pale ale malt instead, which I've never used before.  Fermentables  Name    Type    Amount  Mashed  Late    Yield   Color Weyermann - Pale Ale Malt   Grain   11.000 lb   Yes No  85% 3.4 srm Caramel/Crystal Malt - 40L  Grain   1.000 lb    Yes No  74% 40.0 srm Caramel/Crystal Malt - 80L  Grain   6.000 oz    Yes No  74% 80.0 srm Total grain: 12.375 lb   Hops  Name    Alpha   Amount  Use Time    Form    IBU CTZ     15.5%   1.000 oz    Boil    20.000 min  Pellet  26.8 Simcoe  13.0%   1.000 oz    Boil    10.000 min  Pellet  13.5 Simcoe  13.0%   1.000 oz    Aroma   15.000 min  Pellet  0.0 CTZ     15.5%   1.000 oz    Dry Hop 7.000 day   Pellet  0.0 Simcoe  13.0%   1.000 oz    Dry Hop 7.000 day   Pellet  0.0   After the boil, while racking from the kettle to the fermenter, I noticed an aroma of Southern sweet tea. I had hoped that would go away, but when I took a hydrometer sample last night it was still there in a big way. I also get very little of what one would expect from the Simcoe hops. There is also not enough bitterness, likely owing to the fact that the CTZ I used were only 12.9% AA instead of the 15.5% value Brewtarget uses by default.  So my questions are these:   What could have caused this tea aroma? Is more likely the hops or the pale ale malt? Is this something that is likely to fade over time?   UPDATE  I kegged and served this beer last night, and it turned out pretty good. More caramel flavor than I expected but not over the top. I definitely get an earthy flavor from the late CTZ hops. But the more relevant point is that the tea aroma has gone away.  I brewed a porter this past weekend that had neither Simcoe nor CTZ in it, and I caught a faint whiff of that aroma again as I moved it to the fermenter. It dawned on me then that I started smelling this when I switched from Irish moss to Whirlfloc (5 minutes). Every batch in which I've used Whirlfloc has had that aroma when it went into the fermenter. Thankfully, it does go away after a couple of weeks in the fermenter and does not affect the beer.  So I suspect it's the Whirlfloc. I've read complaints of a ""fishy"" or ""oceany"" smell when people overuse the stuff, but never ""tea"" like I experience. I guess that could come down to my sniffer just being a little different. This will not deter me from using Whirlfloc, though. That stuff is way better than the Irish moss I was using. "
1381,Making Hard Cider in a Dorm,"So I am attempting to make my own hard cider. At my school, there is a farmers market every Thursday and at this market they sell flash pasteurized cider; the process is stopped partway through so it is clean to drink but can still ferment. Anyways I have tried (with success at about a gallon per batch) to create hard cider simply by pouring the cider into bottles, stopping the bottles with cotton balls, and leaving them in a dark corner for 4 days. In that time they fermented (smelled like yeast and alcohol so at least I think they did) so I filtered them, mixed them into a big pot, brought the mixture to 160-180 degrees, and then chilled them.   During the last batch, one bottle had a dry white collection (looked almost like baking soda) resting above the bubbles. I mixed it with the batch anyways; is that safe? Should I toss out the batch? I drank it last night and feel fine, but what do you think it was?  Also the past two batches have tasted great but tend to be very very weak, bringing me to another question: if I add yeast, say champagne yeast, before I let them sit, will this increase my alcohol yield? Also, should I add sugar with the yeast? The concoction is still very sweet with the above mentioned method. "
1382,Apple cider fermentation stuck for 20+ days,"I am on my second year producing apple cider at home, and was successful producing 40 liters of apple cider and perry last year, and are through primary fermenting about 40 liters this season. But my last batch of 20 liters, which I set in a bucket 17th September, is stuck still (>20 days). What can I do now? Best course of action?  additives: Pectolase, nutrition salts, 2 table spoons campden powder all added 2 days earlier  temperature: between 20-25 C across 20 days  Specific gravity: Measured 1.050 at 17th September, 1.045 on 9th October. The liquid is very clear, with just very little foam on top, no bubbles or pressure on the air lock. There is no bad smell, a slight smell of yeast.  UPDATE OCT 16TH: The mystery continues. I followed the advice given here, mail ordered for more Lalvin yeast EC-1118, rehydrated and added to bucket on Oct 13th. Now it is Oct 16th, there is no pressure on the air lock, about 20 C, clear liquid, still SG 1.045. pH was estimated with indicator film to between 4 and 5. The new rehydrated yeast also bubbled, I don't think that's the problem. What is wrong? Could there be something toxic to the yeast in the batch? The only substances that comes to mind are traces of Saniclean (phosphoric acid) and dishwashing liquid, but I don't think so. Alternative hypotheses? Should I give up? "
1383,No pressure in secondary,"I have a problem with an ale kit I've brewed and kegged. I have done primary with a s04 yeast and its been in secondary for about 5 days and I've checked it this morning and its not built up pressure. I have added co2 this morning and its holding pressure.  Is this normal with the yeast, its the first time I have added anything but the stuff you get with the kits.  I didn't know if it's possible the yeast all fell out of suspension in primary so there wasn't enough to pressurise?  Should I put it into another keg with more priming sugar?  I was going to have a little taste tonight to check it's still OK. I'm hoping it is... "
1384,how long can i leave cider in fermentation bucket after it has stopped bubbling?,"We made 50 litres of apple cider last monday night, so about 7 days ago, it has been bubbling away happily and has cleared and scum gathered around edges of bucket, today it seems to have stopped and tastes a little fiery not sweet as juice.  I think it has finished fermenting, but wondering if it is ok to leave in the bucket until this friday?  We are going away tomorrow until friday, but don't want to risk losing the lot! would it be ok? Thanks "
1385,Secondary Temperature,I'm considering racking my brew to a secondary FV once fermentation is complete to allow the yeasts to clean up the beer but I'm not sure if I need to maintain the same heat as I did in the primary?  Some things I've read suggest the temperature should be as low as 10 degrees Celsius but others suggest warmer.  I figured the lower temperature would be ideal for clearing the beer but wouldn't it make the yeast go dormant and prevent them cleaning up the beer?  I'm only considering transferring as I only have the ability to keep one FV at the required temperature and want to get another brew on. :) 
1386,Are different style bottles more appropriate for different style beers?,"While I feel pretty confident that the style of bottle doesn't matter too much with respect to how a given beer is conditioned, I was wondering if there were any good guidelines for choosing different bottle styles with respect to the style of beer going into it?  For example, I'd feel perfectly comfortable putting a strong IPA into a standard 22 oz. capped bottle; but is there something that ""makes more sense"" for a stout? or what style of beer makes sense to put into a 1 liter Grölsch-style flip-top? "
1387,Raisins in Wine?,"Going to make the recipe below today, doubling it. But I was wondering, are the raisins necessary? Doubling the recipe would mean 2 lbs raisins, and that seems excessive.

1390,Fermentation vessels options for 1/2 batch experiments (~2.5 gallons)?,"What are some good options for primary and secondary fermentation vessels for half batch (2.5 gallons) recipes?   At the moment half batches seem to be the best compromise between ease of brewing, expense, splitting LME, and having enough brew to share and sample. Looking around I've found the following options:   3.5 gallon food grade buckets   Pros: cheap Cons: To much head space(?)  3 gallon pet Better Bottles   Pros: correct size size Cons: expensive, non-opaque material  1 Gallon Glass Bottles   Pros: cheap Cons: non-opaque material, need to further split batches, more to clean    Are there any other practical options that I might be missing?  I've looked at some other questions on the site but they don't cover the batch size I'm looking for. "
1391,What size mash tun for a half batch (2-3 gallon) brew?,"I have a 10 gallon mash tun (chest cooler) and I've been brewing with pre-made kits. I want to start making my own recipes but I want to do half-batches (2.5 gallons) until I get the hang of things so I don't waste a bunch of grain and bottling time.  Is my current mash tun too big for the 2.5 gallon batches? Should I just suck it up and do full 5 gallon batches?  Here is my process: I do a single step mash, heating the water on a propane burner and adding it to the cooler then waiting the appropriate amount of time. I then do a two step batch sparge. "
1392,How to calculate the minimum vessel sizes for all grain brewing,"Background:   Brewing in an kitchenette with limited storage space All Grain brewing, extracts are not available around here I'm looking at BIAB also, but want to have the traditional 3 vessels setup Will use 3 regular pots (mash tun, hot liquor, boil kettle), preferably storing then inside each other   I want to get 20l batches (on the primary fermentor) of regular strength beers ( OG &lt; 1060 ).  My average recipe will have those constraints:   5 kg of grain for the mash Water to grain ratio of 4l / kg 90 minute boils Fly sparging or batch sparging   This is where I got so far:  Mash tun   2 liters of deadspace (assuming I make it so) 20l Strike water Grain absorption of 8.3l (1.67l/kg got that number somewhere in the web) With our sparge method we have always a max of 20l of liquid on the pot     --> First issue, how do I estimate the volume taken by the grains?   Edit: Beersmith estimates it to be 0.652 l/kg, so:    Volume of grains = 5 * 0.652 = 3.26 l   Mash tun minimum size: 23.3 l  Boil Kettle   Deadspace 5l (assuming) Post boil volume 25l (20l for fermentor + 5l deadspace) Evaporation = 25l * 9%/h * 1.5h = 3.37l (this should really be from pre-boil volume, but don't know how to get that)  liquid expansion ( 25l + 3.37 ) * 4% = 1.13l  same as above   Boil kettle minimum size: 25l + 3.37l + 1.13l = 29.5l   Plus some slack to prevent boil overs..   How do I calculate pre-boil volume?  How much is the minimum extra space to avoid boilovers?  HTL   No deadspace In the Boil kettle we will have at least 25l + 3.3 = 28.5l of pre-boil volume From the mash we get 18l - 8.3l = 9.7l for first runnings   HLT minimum size: 28.5l - 9.7l = 18.8l  That would give me nicely stackable pots of a very manageable size, where not for the issues above...  BIAB   mash volume = pre-boil + absorption + grain volume = 28.5 + 8.3 + 3.26 = 40 l   Edit: added volume taken by grains  No Sparge   Same as BIAB, I believe   Extract with full boil  (just for completeness)   Same as boil Kettle  "
1393,How to Cold Crash an Imperial Stout?,"During my first all-grain (an Imperial Stout recipe a friend and I invented), I managed to forget adding Irish Moss towards the end of the boil. After 3 weeks in primary, I've verified that fermentation has finished through consecutive days of gravity readings and I'm trying to decide what to do next. OG: 1.080, FG: 1.012, and the recipe I have written down somewhere if it's needed with regards to my questions.  After reading around lots of books, forums, and wikis, it seems no one agrees on cold-crashing, so I'd like to ask some more-specific questions.  I've read that cold-crashing will clear up your beer by causing yeast and other solids to settle to the bottom. Some have argued that this is an unnecessary step for a stout, but I'd like to put in the effort to minimize bottle trub and cloudiness after in-bottle conditioning. So my questions are:   Can I cold-crash with the beer still in the primary fermenter bucket before transfering to secondary? (My thoughts being that I can siphon from the bucket into the secondary carboy without moving it from the fridge and agitating the beer) If so, for how long and at what temperature should I cold-crash this imperial stout ale? The yeast used was Wyeast 1056 (American Ale). My fridge has other food in it, too. I know there will be a suck-in effect created from the pressure differential that arises when cooling a sealed container to match a new environment's temperature, and I realize this could cause the bucket to 'suck in' potential contaminants or flavor-affecting aromas from whatever else is in the fridge. Is this a deal-breaker for cold-crashing? I plan to dry-hop for a week as another experiment right before bottling. Is there a problem with racking to secondary AFTER cold-crashing my primary bucket, raising the temperature back to 68F, then adding my sanitized and weighted hop bag? Will this process have a substantial effect on carbonation? If so, should I pitch more yeast or increase the amount of priming sugar I use before bottling? I do plan on aging this beer for a long time in the bottles, so if cold-crashing will just cause the beer to take longer to carbonate, that is not a problem.  "
1394,Can I bottle when still bubbling a little?,I made a beer from extract (amber dryed malt extract). Recipe says OG is 1.040 FG is 1.010. Used Safebrew S-04 (english ale yeast). The wort has been sitting in primary fermenter for 10 days now. First days I had a lot of bubbles. Now a small bubble every 2-5 minutes or so. This seems to happen more when there are room temperature variations or vibrations. I do not have hidrometer to test FG.  Can I bottle? Generally speaking what airlock activity is acceptable for bottling? 
1395,Kettle lid with hole in it,"I always boil with the lid off my kettles (2 pots).  But I've been thinking lately about the design of commercial kettles.  It seems that to more closely match a commercial boil, I should put about a 3-inch diameter hole in my kettle lids, and boil with the lid on.  There are a couple of things I'd need to watch out for:   Beware of SMM/DMS. Harder to see a boilover coming. Re-formlate recipes for changed gravity   But has anyone tried this and noticed flavor differences?  How would you describe those differences? "
1396,Is whisky distilled from beer?,"Legal issues aside, how is whisky made?  Do you make a beer (presumably without hops), ferment it with regular beer yeast and then distill? "
1397,What are the harms of a boil over?,"Besides forcing me to clean a lot more stuff than I would generally do, will a boil over harm my beer?  I suppose I will loose a lot of the break material and according to brewstrong the break material has proteins vital for head retention, so I would probably have issues with that. Any others? "
1398,Why can't I control my regulator's output pressure?,"I'm completely new to this, so I don't know if I'm doing something dumb or my regulator is broken. Here's what I'm doing:  Here's what I'm doing:   I connected this regulator to a 5 lb. CO2 cylinder.  Closed the blue output valve. Turned the regulator knob all the way down (left, i.e. counter-clockwise, i.e. out, i.e. towards the minus sign). Opened the valve on the CO2 cylinder. As expected, at this point the input (high-pressure) guage quickly goes up to about 600 psi.  NOT expected: the output (low-pressure) guage quickly goes up to 50-60 PSI (the upper limit), and the relief valve starts sputtering and releasing CO2 quickly. Finally, as expected, when I shut off the cylinder, the input pressure slowly drops to zero (and then, if I hold open the relief valve or open the output, so does the output pressure.)   I can't find any configuration of knobs and valves that doesn't result in the output pressure spiking and the relief valve opening. Am I missing something? Is the regulator broken? Something else entirely?  NOTE: If I open the output, and open the regulator a little bit (so it's just releasing CO2 into the room) then the regulator knob does control the flow rate, as expected. Turning the knob to the left reduces the flow to a fairly low rate. If I then block the flow by closing the output valve, the output pressure builds to 60 PSI in about a second and the relief valve opens. "
1399,Bottling a Lager,"I brewed my first lager (a doppelbock) about a month ago and I'm thinking about bottling it in about a week. I followed some advice from my LHBS on the proper schedule for a lager that I now question the validity of (after reading a book on lagering), but below is the odd schedule I followed (all degrees are in fahrenheit).  1 Day - 60 degrees 1 Week - 50 degrees Switch to secondary fermenter 1 Week - 50 degrees 1 Day - 65 degrees for diacetyl rest Dropped temperature about 5 degrees per day until reaching 37 degrees and holding for 3 weeks   The OG was 1.079 and it was down to 1.030 after the first 7 days. Obviously, I'll check the gravity prior to bottling, but assuming it's on target, should I do anything special before bottling? I intend to prime and store the bottles for at least three weeks at about 65 degrees before drinking.  How do I know if the beer still contains enough yeast to carbonate the beer? If I do have to add yeast, how much should I add for my 5 gallon batch? Is there a formula for determining this? Should I use the same strain (WLP838) I used during primary fermentation? Does 5 Oz. of priming sugar sound like the right amount to use for priming? "
1400,when making whiskey (or beer) what is left of the barley?,"[Mod: distilling is normally off-topic here, however, this question could equally be about making beer, since the primary subject is mashing/sparging and spent grain, so I'm keeping this question open so long it doesn't touch on distilling.]  I have been reading about the whiskey making process, but I do not make it.  From what I understand, in very basic terms, a barley soup is made, and the water is drained off.  This water contains enzymes etc from the barley, and this water only content is fermented, and so on in the process.  While Im sure this is hardly accurate it may be a general approximation in layman terms.  If there are fundamental errors of understanding, please correct me.  But Im understanding that the actual barley kernals are separated from the mix before fermentation.  My question revolves around what is left of the barley after it is separated from the mixture.  Are they whole?  Do they melt into the water leaving just waste behind?  Something else?  Does this leftover waste have a term I can look up to find more about?  Update: I am not looking for things to do with this waste. "
1401,Why is the beer head and head retention important?,"Does the head improve something on the beer flavour/aroma?  Back home in Brasil, the folk has it that head is useful to keep the beer cold, but in colder lands (and warmer beers) as they have in Europe that is probably a non-issue.  In fact, some fast drinkers over there would argue for smaller head to get more beer.  Why head and head retention are important? "
1402,Too late to move a brew?,"I brewed an IPA yesterday. All went well and it is bubbling away today. However, my friend's brewing fridge/fermenting chamber just freed up and he suggested putting my brew in there. It would obviously be better to ferment it in the fridge with temp control etc. I'd have to drive it to his house (5 mins away). Is it too late to move it? Will that just oxidise the beer? Or is it early enough that I won't have to worry about that yet?  "
1403,How early can I know if a brew is ruined?,"Today I tried my very first brew using a Coopers DIY kit. I was told the Lager mix that comes with the kit probably won't taste amazing, but it should be hardy and forgiving for beginners that don't have a temperature controlled fridge yet.  The instructions recommend making sure the water temperature is between 21-27 degrees celcius before adding yeast. But it also said to add the yeast ASAP after mixing. So, stupidly, I didn't do a wet run and didn't have any (properly) cold water and as a result my mix was at 36 degrees when I added the yeast! Even now, an hour later I think it's at about 34 degrees.  So, instead of bottling in a few days then waiting a month to find out if it's ruined, I was considering scrapping this batch and trying again (with a wet run first to get the temperature right this time). So my question is: will tasting it in a few days be sufficient to tell if I need to start again? How exactly will I know?  My Original Gravity measured at 38, but I don't know if that's relevant.  Note I've looked at this question which is similar to mine, but a bit of a different issue: I think I ruined my first brew  Thanks in advance for any advice. I'm really looking forward to my first good batch :) Then, once I have a proper fridge I would love to try some more adventurous recipes. "
1404,Boil Time for Partial Mash with a Hopped Extract,"I'm doing a partial mash, but using a pre-hopped-extract.  I'm adding flavour and aroma hop additions in the 15 to 1 minute range, but no bittering hops.  How long does my boil time need to be?  Currently I'm boiling for 30 minutes - could I cut this down to 15 minutes? "
1405,Marking your brew pot?,"I have a new stainless steel brew pot and it doesn't have any quantity markings.  How do you recommend marking each gallon?  I tried to make an indent but it's not very noticeable, any ideas? "
1406,Why is there so much foam when I open the bottle?,"I have a batch of beer, fermented and then bottled. When I open the bottle, there is a lot of foam and it flows out of the bottle for a while.  What could cause this? I assume it's too much CO2 and thus too much priming sugar? (This is a 5 Gallon Batch, mixed with Water/Sugar in a bottling bucket, so no Fizz Drops)  Should I leave the bottles alone for another week or two? Could temperature cause it? (Temperatature varied between 68 and 76 degrees F during the entire process)  Some more information:   I used the White House Honey Ale Kit and brewed on 1/24/2013 Cooled the Wort in a Water Bath. I didn't have a Wort Chiller at the time and it was hard to get the Water cold enough, so that process easily took 45 minutes. Original Gravity was lower than expected (I think 1047 instead of 1062), Final Gravity was 1011. Put it in a 5 Gallon Fermenting Bucket and let it sit there (I don't have a secondary fermentor, although I'm about to order one) Let it sit in my closet, temperatures between low 60's and mid-70's (my AC can only set to either heat or cool, so controlling the temperature is an issue) Bottled on 2/21 with the provided 5oz of priming sugar Opened a bottle on 2/27 => Beer was foamy, a little foam rose and escaped, beer tastes a bit flat   Possible issues I see:   Took too long to chill Only one fermentor Lack of good temperature control Opened too early after bottling   Since I do not exactly know how each of these factors change the taste, I'm not sure what's really causing it. I bought a Wort Chiller and I'm about to buy a secondary fermentor, but I can't do much about the temperature unless someone has an idea. "
1407,Yeast Starter Stopped after ~20 hours,"I am trying to make skeeter pee without the slurry from a previous batch. so I wanted to make a starter to make sure my yeast were happy guys.  I took 3 pints of water to 1 teaspoon of yeast nutrients and about 6 teaspoons sugar. and a packet of ec-1118 yeast. I let that go for about 8-10 hours and it was happily bubbling the airlock. When I started the starter I had also put together the primary. The starter had an SG of about 1.09 and about 22% sugar. not too far off the 1.07 he recommends on the site. So that had been sitting for the same 8-10 hours. Before I went to bed, I degassed the primary for a few seconds, and then I added about a pint of primary to the starter and waited, within an hour it had bubbled up again through the airlock. and the yeast was churning and swimming around and doing its yeasty thing.  Now, this morning I woke up and in my excitement ran to see how my starter was doing. To my dismay, there was no activity in the bottle. Is this a stuck fermentation? I cant imagine the yeast ate all the sugar in there already. Not sure what my next step should be. Add more sugar and yeast energizer? Or wait another little bit? Is there anything I did wrong?  All help is greatly appreciated!  This is the recipe I'm using: [website]He says use the slurry from a previous batch of wine, I dont have this so it was recommended elsewhere to make a solid starter.  The main issue is the acidity can make it hard for the yeast to get going. "
1408,Control Products 9102D Temperature Controller won't go below 50°F(10°C)?,"So I got a dual stage controller ([website]I checked the manual and manufacturers website and don't see any way to change this. I noticed that the ""Heat"" relay can go all the way down to 0°F which seems odd to me.   The manual says that this controller supports a temperature range of -40°F to 300°F so I'm hoping this isn't a bad unit or something.  Like I said, the relays switch on and off just fine, but I can't figure out how to get the cool side temperature to the correct level.  Any help is appreciated. Thanks in advance. "
1409,How to avoid blowoff on a 1 gallon jug?,"I'm experimenting with 1 gallon batches, and every single time I had a blowoff. So for the batch I brewed today I just put a bucket of sanitized water and a blowoff tube to start with since I know that it'll blowoff while I'm at work otherwise.  The recipe kit says to use half a pack of yeast, but even if I go below it I have Kräusen climbing out of the jug.  Is there any harm in this and having a blowoff tube for the first 24-30 hours? Is there any way to avoid blowoff completely without sacrificing the beer? (These 1 gallon batches are mainly for experimentation anyway, but they should still be good, drinkable beer)  I guess I could try to find 2 gallon jugs just so that I have plenty of headroom? "
1410,Hydrometer reading interference,"When brewing an IPA about a week ago, my starting gravity reading came out to be 1.12 - significantly higher than the listed target of 1.07 on the recipe. I had suspicions of error at the time which I believe was confirmed when I took a reading this weekend while transferring to secondary - the beer is now down to about 1.02, which seems like a large drop in just a week.   Here's what I believe happened - I noticed after taking the first sample that it contained some sediment that had failed to settle out. Being relatively new to this, I didn't think much of it at the time but now I imagine this contributed to an artificially high initial reading. Can anyone confirm this?  Also, is there any way to estimate what the starting gravity may have actually been besides relying on what the recipe called for (I doctored the recipe a decent amount so I'm not confident in the printed target)?

1411,When to dry hop for Bulldog Evil Dog?,"I just want some advice on when to dry hop for this. I like my beers to be hoppy as hell!  The stage I'm at;  -the brew has been going for 6 days (hydrometer reading of 1.03 (initial probably 1.065, newbie move, forgot to take it!)) -'rapid' fermentation appears to have ceased (no airlock activity) 2 days ago  First of all, is loss of gravity linear? ie. As I've lost about 60% of all I'll lose does this mean fermentation is 60% done time wise?  How many more days before I dry hop?  Do I throw the hops 'teabags' straight in the FV or shall I soak them first?  Thanks in advance! Gary "
1412,Kegs - Why use a dual regulator instead of a splitter?,"I currently own a dual regulator and use two kegs with it. I want to expand to four kegs can therefore face two options:   Purchase a quad regulator Add a splitter to each of the outputs on the dual regulator   What are all the negatives involved in using a splitter instead of a dual/quad/multi regulator?   For example, when using a splitter, both kegs must have the same level of carbonation.  Would it take longer to carbonate two kegs that are being carbonated via a splitter? "
1413,Does High Sugar Concentration Inhibits Bacterial growth?,"About a month ago, I started making a dairy-free drink with blended fruit (i.e. Strawberries, Raspberries, etc). I'd like to start lacto-fermenting these smoothies but a friend of mine insists that the sugar content is too high and it would be impossible for bacteria to grow in it.  Can bacteria (namely Lactobacillus) grow in high concentrations of sugar? If not, why and would the sugar content of my blended fruit be too high to allow bacteria fermentation? Would it be possible to lacto-ferment things like Orange Juice or Apple Juice? "
1414,How to remove sediment?,"So I did my first ever beer and it was to be a hoppy Saison (3724 combined with Amarillo, Centennial and Cascade). I had tons of stuff going wrong while boiling, even not managing to temperature crash the beer (Ambient temperature here is 30 degrees). So far the taste of it was yummy, bitter, a little fruity and the finish just sucks your tongue dry.  Now after four weeks I got curious to see what it turned out like so far so I took a tasting glass and emptied a bit of beer from the carboy using the spigot on the bottom. There was a fair bit of sediment in the glass (I think most of it is hop pellet remains):   So I was wondering what my options are here. Considering there is a significant amount of sediment, could I get away with transfering it on bottling day to a bottling bucket and let it rest for an hour or two (so all the sediment can settle before trasnfering it into a bottle?).   Are there any other options aside from putting it to secondary? (if you guys think this is too much sediment I guess I don't have any other option)   One thing I already considered was not transferring through the spigot but with a tube and ""pump"" it over to the bottling bucket. "
1415,How do lager kits let you brew at room temperature?,"I am thinking about making some Mexican-style lager using one of the following kits:   Coopers Mexican Cerveza Bulldog Beer Kit - Cortez Gold Mexican Cerveza Better Brew Bandit, Tequila and lime   Now I managed to find the instructions for one of these and it recommends a primary brewing temperature of 20-25 degrees C. This suits me as that is roughly the temperature of my kitchen. These are the questions I have:   If lager brewing requires a temperature of 7 degrees C, why do these kits suggest a brewing temperature of 20-25? Generally speaking its hard to find proper instructions for most lager kits online. If there are no instructions, how do I know what temperature to brew it at (before purchase)? This is a problem for me, as I don't have the facilities to make lager the proper way, so I need to be sure in advance of buying a kit that it is suitable to be brewed at room temperature.  "
1416,Kettle souring with lactobacillus - hot plate?,"Researching a Berliner weisse and have decided that I will be doing a kettle sour.   Lactobacillus likes to be around 45°C from what I have read so far. Currently my thinking is to transfer the kettle onto a hotplate like this, connected to a temperature probe in order to keep a consistent temp.  Would there be any issue with keeping the wort on a direct heat source for a sustained period? Any other issues with this proposal?  "
1417,Pressing own fruits/berries,"I'm planning to make a berry cider this year and considering using fresh berries (raspberry or blackberry).   Does any body knows basic stats on raspberries or blackberries, like how many pounds do you need to produce 1 gallon of juice? What's the approximate starting gravity of freshly pressed berry juice?  I tried to search through google, but no luck. Lots of recipes with sugar additions for making country wine, but now stats on fresh berries.  Thanks a lot. "
1418,How much fermentis/safale US-05 yeast to use?,"I wondered if anyone who has used the above yeast can give me an idea on the quantity required. I am brewing a fairly high SG IPA (somewhere in the region of 1.065-1.080) batch size 15-20L.   Brewers friend recipe calculator suggests 27g of this yeast based on a 10 billion cells/g density. This is rated at > 6 billion cells/g (which, if i'm calculating correctly, based on the lower estimate of 6 billion cells/g, I would actually need 45g, or 4 packets!!).   I have also seen posts which suggest that 1 packet of this yeast would be ample for a batch this size up to an SG of 1.085?  Any advice would be greatly appreciated as I don't want to under of over yeast!  In case this is needed, I am trying a very basic recipe out (I'm still a newbie);  2-2.5 kg pre-hopped light DME 0.5-1.0 kg dextrose Fermentis US-05 yeast ? g 50-75g Cascade (dry hop) 50-75g Southern Star (dry hop)  Thanks in advance!

1419,Pilsner extract kit: why is the original gravity low?,"I've just put the extract version of this in the fermenter: [website]The gravity is 1.037 which seems way low. Dammit I don't want no weak beer! But I don't understand why it is so low. I did a partial boil (13L once the extract was added), chilled, siphoned to the fermenter and then topped up to 23L per the recipe. Wishing now I stopped at 20L and took a reading. Also aerated it by shaking the fermenter so it is definitely not a mixing issue messing with the reading. There is maybe 1cm of fluid/hops gunk left in the kettle. What happened?  One thing that was not great was the stove I was using was underpowered so it was a weak boil.  Malts:   2 x Black Rock Ultra Light Extract 1.7kg Can 250g - Weyermann Carahell Malt (Steep)  "
1420,How long to chill bottles before carbonation is equilibrated?,"When bottle conditioning, it seems (though I haven't done anything scientific enough to know for sure) that I get varying amounts of carbonation depending on how long I refrigerate the beer before drinking.  At first I assume it was just inconsistency with priming but after researching force-carbonation recently I'm beginning to think it may be related to the equilibrium of temperature and carbonation.  I'm thinking that many of the cases where I'm getting less carbonation are within 24 hours or so of refrigerating while those that are refrigerated longer seem to be better carbonated.  Is there possibly something to this?  How long should bottles generally be chilled before serving to ensure that the CO2 in the bottle is in equilibrium? "
1421,Why is my Kombucha getting thicker?,"I am brewing my Kombucha for about four months now, starting a new batch every four to five days.  Since three weeks my Kombucha got a little thick (viscous, syrupy). I did not change my recipe, the SCOBY just got bigger.  Is this normal? Is this caused by the bigger SCOBY? "
1422,Distillation Yield in Litres and ABV,"I am looking to distill 4 liters of 6.5% cider, would i end up with an amount of 90% plus, of what would essentially be flavored ethanol.  Or would i end up with around 2 liters of around 13% apple wine?  What sort of yield would i expect in terms of both liters and ABV? "
1423,Why do we boil sugar before priming,I read that when priming you need to boil sugar in water. I don't see the point since sugar is considered an anti septic.   What is the purpose of boiling?   Would it be because we need desolved sugar and the water might be contaminated?  
1424,Degassing and it's effects on yeast,"I'm wondering if degassing and removing the suspended CO2 (a part of, and a percentage of the wine) changes the totals for ABV% as it applies to yeast tolerance. It seems that by degassing you would inherently increase the existing ABV% because there is less total parts then when you started off before degassing. Even if 1% of the mead/wine is CO2, and it's released through degassing, that would mean the ABV would increase.  On the flip side, by removing one of the two toxins(ethel alcohol &amp; CO2)from the yeast, does this give them more room and less stress to ferment further? Since CO2 is toxic to yeast, does it inhibit the yeast's ability to fully ferment the larger amount of sugars in wine/mead? "
1425,Is there a good alternative for protected Nelson Sauvin Hop?,"I would like to plant Hoop similar to Nelson Sauvin in Switzerland (Europe). This NZ hop appears to be under licence, so there is no chance to buy rhizome or plants.   Reference : [website]Is there a known alternative? Where would it be possible to buy it? "
1426,Can Horizontal Kegging be achieved?,I'm was wondering if a keg could be on a horizontal (or slight angle) position and still provide a constant flux?   I'm just wondering this because I'm looking to buy a horizontal freezer  (which I'm going to tweek the temp control ) and put my kegs and serve draft beer from those.   Anyone tried this and succed / failed ?  Thanks a lot! 
1427,Replace corn adjunct of recipe with...?,"I've got a recipe for a wild strawberry blonde (I recently asked for tips on prepping fresh strawberries). Well, I'm finally going to brew this, but...corn?  The blonde recipe I'm looking at right now has ±1.125# of flaked corn.  Tips and thoughts on a grain substitute? Any general tips or resource links on grain substitution is also welcome.  Disclaimer  I get it, corn is a respectable adjunct. But it's also the characteristic of many lagers and pilsners I dislike the most. And 20+ years of homebrewing (on and off) and appreciating craft beer, corn on the nose and palate really turn me off. "
1428,Fermenting/Conditioning Longer When Kegging,"I'm getting ready to try kegging for the first time and I'm wondering how much conditioning time might be lost in the process (assuming the keg is refrigerated and force-carbonated immediately after filling).  When bottling the beer gets another couple of weeks or more at room temperature to further condition/age. When kegging the lower temperatures will likely be inhibiting this some, if not entirely, which makes me wonder if I should leave it in the fermenter longer than normal.  Assuming I'm at the point where I would normally bottle (say two weeks into primary for a lower gravity ale), would that be too early to keg? Should I leave it longer to account for earlier cooling? "
1429,What woods can be safely used to flavour/age beer?,"There is a history of people using oak barrels to age and mature beer. These days people often use bourbon soaked oak chips to flavour beer in the secondary.  Also, I have seen people asking about using maple, spruce and pine on the site? Regarding, spruce/pine they have been looking for a pine/spruce flavour that you would get from the needles.  What experience have people had using these and are there any woods you should avoid due to health/food safety risks? "
1430,Use expired yeast or wait for new yeast to arrive?,"I just brewed with what I now realise is a rather old Williams Brewing Kolsch kit.  The yeast is Wyeast 2565 Kolsch and the packet has already expanded.  I have no idea when it expanded, so I assume it must be months ago and that the yeast has already died/gone dormant.  The manufacture date is 07 Jul 2014.  I have already ordered a replacement yeast packet which will hopefully arrive towards the beginning the week.  I have chilled my wort and it is now sitting in the fridge, where I can control its temperature.  Right now I have it at normal refrigeration temperature (4°C).  I will raise up the temperature suitable for fermentation before any pitching.  Should I:   Pitch the expired yeast packet now and just let it be? Pitch the expired yeast packet now, then also pitch the new one when it arrives? Or throw away the old one and wait for the new one to arrive (and expand) then pitch that? Something else?  "
1431,What are the effects of adding water after the boil?,"During the boil a lot of water is evaporated off. I have a 30L boiler and generally end up with around 22L in the fermentation vessel. After racking off from the fermentation and leaving the trub behind I can end up with as little as 19L worth of beer.  To increase the amount of beer at the end or to intentionally reduce the ABV I occasionally add water (same sterile water used for mashing) to the fermentation vessel just before pitching the yeast.   What are the effects of adding water at this stage? Pros vs cons.  Follow up question. I intend to upgrade my equipment in the future. I have 30L kegs I use in my kegerator so 30L is the target batch size.  What is the difference between the above method of adding water to get up to 30L vs having a large enough boiler which can boil down to 30L? Is one better than the other, if so, why? "
1432,Do darker ales suffer less with choloramines/chlorophenols?,"I have done many many brews with untreated local tap water, and I have only 3 times had an issue with chlorophenols. I now treat the tap water with 1 campden tablet/100l/20gl. But, revieing my records it looks like it was only pale ales that were affected.  This leads me to question do darker ales in some way buffer the chlorophenols?  Is there something in dark or aromatic malts that reduces chlorophenol generation?  Is it just when it happens they mask the flavour?  Or is this just random chance and it affects all ales the same but I just happen to have been affected on 3 pales? "
1433,First time brewing with Mr. Beer,"First attempt at home brew. Not sure what to look for. My brewing time line so far is:    28 days in fermenter tank.  Bottled at room temp for 36 days.  Put in fridge yesterday, 24 hours refrigerated so far.    Questions:    Bottles have small rafts floating on top, will those settle?  How long should I leave in fridge before trying?   Thx Ken "
1434,How to store spent grain while waiting on your dryers,"We are trying to develop a method to dry spent grains with a small DIY solar dryer.  When we pick up the spent grain it is get too much volume for our dryer and then how to store it.  Our drying process is very small and slow.  We do not have the ability to freeze the spent grain.  We have developed and plan to use a 5-gal bucket system in which the lid pushes all the air out of the bucket.  The lid has an airlock.   We plan to put the spent grain in these 5-gal buckets with water, push the air out, put in the airlock and store them until the dryers are free to process the spent grain.   Our questions are: 1.  Will this work? 2.  Should we mix yeast or sugar into the buckets to keep them from spoiling?   We are not brewers, so this is all new to us. Thanks for any input "
1435,Does cider need yeast nutrient?,"From what I've read, beer wort is relatively rich in nutrients and mead must is nutrient-poor.  Where does cider fit on this spectrum?  I typically do small batches and pitch pretty generously, one dry yeast packet split between two one-gallon batches.  I always use some adjunct sugars, either brown sugar, juice concentrate, or honey.  I'm hoping to get a batch started this weekend - do you think it would benefit from some nutrient?  Would something like Mangrove Jack's M02 that claims to have nutrient in it suffice? "
1436,Can I all grain brew 20 litre lager batch using 12 litre pot and same 4.3 kg grain bill?,"To elaborate, the recipe I have was for 20 litre batch at OG 1046. I used my 12 litre (safely boilable) pot to mash the 4.3 kg grain bill specified for a 20 litre batch. My problem was that I only ended up with 12 litres of wort at 1044 in my FV after liquoring back.  Despite keeping the amount of grain the same I didn’t end up with wort concentrated enough to get near my 20 litres target.  Was it ever possible meet the 20 litre volume with my 12 litre pot?  Otherwise, I can’t work out where I went wrong.  Thanks   UPDATE: As requested, this update gives the recipe used, which is the Munich Helles from James Morton's book, BREW. However in terms of method I didn't follow the books Lager Method in terms of water quantities as I decided to use a 12 litre pot for mash/boil and use the liquor back approach which is discussed in the book albeit in an on/off manner throughout the book. (FYI The book suggests it's possible with a 10 litre pot, but its never discussed wrt to a specific recipe)... (i'd recommend the book though).  TARGET NUMBERS,  OG 1.046-1.048  FINAL GRAVITY 1.011-1.013  ABV: 4.5% - 4.7%   BATCH SIZE  20 Litres  Estimated Efficiency 70%  GRAIN BILL  Pilsner Malt, German 4.3kg (9.5lb)  (I asked for the grain to be crushed, the MaltMiller.co.uk did this for me)  HOPS:  First wort hop: Hallertauer (4% AA) 40g (1.5 oz)  Aroma Steep: Hallertauer (4% AA) 60g (2.125 oz)  YEAST: GERMAN LAGER YEAST: WLP830  1 IRISH MOSS TABLET (I used Protofloc)  The Method   Prepare a starter a week before in 2 phases from 2 pure yeast sachets, based on a yeast calculators estimate of my required cell count.   MASH IN I insulated the 12 litre pot with 4 layers of large bubble wrap and string and lined it with the grain bag. I filled it the with 9 litres at 69.5°C , as 2:1 ratio is quoted as a minimum, and poured in the 4.3kg grain, and pushed the grain down with a plastic paddle so the water covered it. I then stirred a little so that there were no obvious clumps of dry grain. The water temperature dropped to 50°C (ish), although it was impossible to get a confident reading, as it was so thick. I then added just boiled water in 500 ml increments until i was getting my target 65°C and started a 1 hour timer and put the glass lid on. I checked this approximately 15 min intervals and it appeared to approximately hold the temperature for the whole hour (again it was hard to know if the reading was representative of all the pot.) i believe there was about 11 litres of water in the pot, at this point.  MASH OUT I attempted to raise the grain temperature, initially on maximum heat (gas), to 75°C but i had a differential of about 15C between the edge of the pot at (85C) and the centre of the grain at (70°C), I kept trying to stir the grain but to no real avail over 15 mins. I effectively gave up and moved onto the sparge.  SPARGE I pulled out the grain into a massive caterers mixing bowl and poured over 2 litres of water at 75°C, and let it rest for 10 mins. The grain was sat in the water as all the grain and the 2 litres of water fit in the bowl. In hindsight - Perhaps the bowl should have been intentionally small so that water in the grain bag would drip into the bowl rather than soak into the grain more? After the 10 mins was up, i gently squeezed the grain bag and I poured the water from the bowl into the pot with the wort and dumped the grain.  BOIL I should have taken a starting gravity reading here, but i didn't! I did however use my glass thermometer to allow me to calculate the volume of wort as being 5.5 litres.  I added my first wort hops and put maximum heat on and brought the wort to a boil (no lid), I now added 2 more litres of water (i think should have done before it started boiling) i figured it was better to add more water before boil completion as it would definitely be sanitary, perhaps there is a better reason not to do this? I let it boil for 90 mins (no lid). 15 mins before the end of boil I added 1 Protofloc tablet.  STEEP I added about 1 litre of cold sanitary water and got the temperature between 75°C and 79°C, added the aroma hops and let them steep for 30 mins.  LIQUOR BACK I took a gravity reading, and using a online calculator worked out the gravity at 20°C was 1.105 (i think), i was sure how water to add so i just added some and got to just under 12 litres at 20°C and what i settled as being my Original Gravity of 1.044, meaning i diluted it too much without getting near 20 litre batch, hence my reason for this post.  COOL for PITCHING I put the lid on and sealed it with starsan covered clingfilm and placed the pot in the sink in cold water (7°C). This took me hours, as i didn't have ice and only half the pot was in contact with the cold water. [I'm going to make a wort chiller even for this smallish pot or at the very least boil and freeze some water the night before to liquor back with.]  The target was stated as being 8°C, but as the yeast is happy at 8°C to 12°C, i ended up settling for 12°C before i transferred to FV and dumped all the yeast in and gave it a good shake. My FV fridge is set to 8°C and certainly fermentation had started 24 hours later, but it was by no means a vigorous airlock bubbling like you get with an ale at 20°C.  I realized later my yeast amount was for a 20 litre, so i presume i've over pitched, but i understand that's preferable to under pitching, but that has nothing to do with my mash efficiency which is the suspected reason for my poor wort concentration. "
1437,First batch result,"I'm know enjoying my first batch of beer. I think, it will be some kinda use for those who are hesitating to start their brew or still researching. I did quite much research before i did brew.   During brew day I was much afraid of contaminating wort. It happened at some level but finished beer is ok. I will explain how.  First, I malted my own barley and roasted it. It took me quite long time to malt 5 kg of barley at home conditions.  Secondly, I thought that crushing malt with roller pin would gave me the same output as malt mill but I was mistaken. As a result, half of the malt wasn't cracked at all. I found out about it after brew by observing steeped malt. So, my advice here is that you better use grain mill, or blender if you don't have a mill.  Thirdly, It took me about 40-50 minutes to cool down 15Lof hot wort from 100C to 22C in cold bath. As I don't have a wort chiller. My advice: buy or make one for yourself. Unfortunately, I added some 5L more water but it lowered gravity. My advice is not to overadjust gravity of your wort. Do it little by little.  Fourthly, I did sanitation with StarSan while cooling wort down. However, I got infection somehow. The wort didn't ferment much, only 5-7 days then it stopped. But i didn't touch it until 14 days after sealing it. Bottled beer with brown sugar, it worked well.   Fifthly, I had ordered wort racking cane late, therefore I had to pour wort from carboy glass to bottles through cotton and cloth filter but it was inefficient. Some of the yeast got into bottles. Do not repeat my mistake. After 2 weeks I tasted my beer. It was well carbonated, around 1.5% alcohol and some sour taste. I did research about sour taste, it happens bcoz of infection from cold side of storage. Full article here:   [website]In general, i am happy with my first result. I was afraid to ruin everything.  Here is the recipe:  4.5kg caramel malt (malted and roasted myself) 0.5kg dark malt malted and roasted myself) 1 bar of dark chocolate 30gr Sapphire hops at 60 min 30gr Sapphire hops at 30 min 30gr Sapphire hops at 0 min 1 tbsp of baker's yeasts.  20L water during step mashing 5L water after boil  Result: Aroma: Chocolate, nutty, citrus Flavor: Sour, chocolate, Color: reddish-brown   "
1438,Step mash and under modified malts,"I’ve been reading about common mistakes with Belgian beers and it’s been noted that a “real” Belgian beer requires a step mash. The reason given for this is that apparently this is required for good head formation and retention.   The article also mentions that this will only work with under modified malts and not your typical well modified pilsner.   Given that malting effectively does the same job as a protein rest step (gets the enzymes churning away) what is the benefit?  To put this another way, what’s the difference between a well modified malt and single temp vs an under modified malt and step mash? "
1439,Best yeast for bottle conditioning,"I’ve used Safale F-2 and sometimes CBC-1 for bottle conditioning with good results. Doing so, flavour impact has been minimal. It also drops its dead clear once bottle fermentation is mostly done. It also goes beyond 10% ABV so residual sugar is also minimal for high gravity beers. Alcohol doesn’t kill the yeast easily.   Are there any other general purpose yeast strains suitable for bottle conditioning? Is there an easy way to measure F-2? I frequently do batches of 5L, 1.3 US gallon. Packaging says 2-7 g per 100L, which means a minuscule 0.2 g per batch for me. Among my group of brewer friends I’m alone in pitching fresh yeast for bottle conditioning. But it’s recommended when racking on a secondary fermentation vessel, right? Some of my stouts and Belgian ales spend 1-3 months on a secondary (and it sure feels like the yeast isn’t very active any more).   Edit Elaborated the third question about long secondary. "
1440,Ballpark yeast count of starter from harvested commercial yeast,"I've harvested some yeast from a commercial bottle (Maine Beer Company's Mo Pale Ale) and stepped it up to a 1L size. I'll be making a pale ale at ~1.055 OG and everything I read indicates I'll want roughly 180-200 billion cells and that about 1L of starter should get me there. But that's 1L of starter built from standard starting points (like liquid vial) so I don't really know if my 1L starter is remotely in the right ballpark.  Here's what I've done:   Added slurry from one beer to 250ml starter wort (25g DME, 250g water) 2 days: Observed thin layer of bubbles 3 days: Doubled the starter (added another 250ml, total 500ml) 3.5 days: Observed very nice looking krausen 4.5 days (36 hrs since last feeding): Doubled the starter (added 500ml, total 1L)   My plan is 24 hours after the final feeding to refrigerate it for 2-3 days until I brew, decant most of the liquid, and pitch the yeast.  Does this sound like I will reasonably hit my ballpark for cell counts? Should I look for any particular volume of settled-out yeast to validate approximate cell counts?  Update I doubled again to a total of 2L of starter wort. After another day I refrigerated it 2 days before brewing and I poured out most of the liquid. I brewed a pale ale and from what I can tell fermentation was strong. I ended up with 5.9% ABV, 81% attenuation.  "
1441,Malted vs unmalted flaked oats,"What difference to the mash and ultimately the end product will Flaked Oats vs Malted Flaked Oats make?  I have run a recipe Nut Brown Ale using Malted Flaked Oats several times and recently reordered the same materials again. However, I ordered Unmalted Flaked Oats by mistake. With the remains of the malted oats I had left over about 30% of the oats are from the new unmalted oats. Flaked oats are used to impart the smoothness and better mouthfeel so it begs the question as to which is better for that.  Are Malted Flaked Oats better to use than Unmalted Flaked Oats?  Both are sold as being used to improve smoothness and body/texture.  "
1442,How to over carbonate?,Why would I want to over carbonate? Simple I’m trying to debug my under carbonated batches. So far I’ve had 4 batches all primed with coopers carbonation tabs and while they have all had some bubbles it’s not nearly the amount I’m looking for. I’ve deliberately added more than i should to see if I can increase the levels but it seems to top out at say porter level carbonation. Not the 3x CO2 I want in a Belgian.   So I’m looking to try and go too far and create some bottle bombs. At least if I can hit the top end I can work backwards in my system. Can someone give me a surefire way to do this with a 7% Belgian Blonde?  I’m conditioning at between 20-22 degrees C and using both caps and swing lids.  
1443,Carbonation happening too soon?,"I am brewing a batch using the basic Mr. beer brew kit. Carbonation usually takes 10-14 days. However, this time the bottles are hard as a rock within 3 days.  Is this normal? Shall I open the bottles to let the extra carbon dioxide out and wait for entire 2 weeks or is it ok to start freezing the bottles now? "

1446,Gingerbug issues,"I've made a gingerbug  many times in the past and been successful, the longest of which I kept alive for over a year until another project took over.   My issue this time is that after bottling my drinks I find the bottles become as tight as a drum in two days but when it comes to serving the drinks there really isn't much fizz, the bubbles are tiny and by the time I open the bottle for a second time the drink is almost flat.   What am I doing wrong?   I've seen many recipes that recommend burping the bottles for a couple of days but won't that prevent the drink becoming fizzier?   Also I've seen one post that says that the best indicator that it's ready is the presence of bubbles at the top of the bottle, is this true? "
1447,Siphon's tip got into the carboy,"I am on the 10th day of fermentation, and tried to get a sample to measure gravity with siphon. However after a few pushes, it stopped working and I noticed that the tip got into the carboy, which I cannot recover I believe. See the picture below    What should I do now? I cannot wait for another siphon, it is a lame brand, broken on the first attempt. I have a bucket with spigot. I am considering to hold the carboy, and drop the batch inside to the sterilized, sanitized bucket. I have to do the dry hopping today, should I do hopping inside the bucket or inside the carboy?  Any risk here? If it is risky, how can I fix the damn siphon which I will never use again?  The beer tastes fantastic and I dont want to spoil it.  Picture of outer tube:    I have the following black part    But not the otherblack part, I guess which must be check valve. "
1448,Cidery or wine flavor after bottle conditioning ale,"I’ve done a few batches using Safale F2 in combination with dextrose for bottle conditioning. They all came out tasting sour after 2,5 weeks, like I image young sparkling wine would taste. Now it’s do 2-3 weeks additional lagering. Previous attempts with F2 and DME came out like sweet beer. The use of dextrose is new to me.  I also did a tasting after only 1 week of bottle fermentation. I did pick a very faint sour taste back then. But in other respects a very limited flavor impact. Over all it was a good back then, but still lacked some CO2.  At [website]Is it likely that F2 in combination with a monosaccharide will produce flavors like sour and wine-like? Or should I look for other possible causes?  "
1449,Taste Test for Stale Beer,"I am curious to know what stale beer really tastes like.  For me I can read about what certain off flavors are supposed to taste like.  However, taste and flavor can be so subjective its hard to really now until someone says; ""Here, this is really stale.""  So I was wondering if anyone knew the best way to maybe force stale a beer in a closed bottle?  Or how best to doctor a beer to get it to stale after opening? What is stale beer supposed to taste like?  EDIT:  Are there any BJCP instructors on-line here that can speak to how the BJCP trains judges to pick out oxidation? "
1450,How do you avoid disturbing sediment when moving your fermenter to rack or bottle?,"When it's time to rack or bottle, do you have to move your fermenter?  For instance, my fermenters sit in the closet of my office room until it's time to rack or bottle, at which point I move them to the kitchen counter.  This bothers me because I know the shifting process disturbs the trub or sediment, sort of defeating one of the purposes of conditioning.  Do you have a setup where you don't have to move your fermenters before racking or bottling?  If so, describe it.  If not, how long do you let them sit after moving them before siphoning? "
1451,"Does your beer have a ""house"" flavor?","I identify ""house"" flavor as a similar flavor that carries across several different styles of beer from the same brewery.    What parts of the brewing process or ingredients lend to ""house"" flavor the most?  What commercial breweries in your area, or in your experience have a distinct house flavor? "
1452,Which inkjet-printable labels perform well?,"I've never bothered to label my beer before, but I think I want to start.  Have you ever used inkjet-printable labels on your brew before?  How did they perform?  Are there any brands of labels that you could either recommend or advise to avoid? "
1453,Is the price of copper making plate chillers the better choice?,"This copper-in-plastic counter-flow chiller seems to mitigate the effect that the high price of copper has on all-copper counter-flow chillers.  I'm not sure the Chillzilla even has to have an all-copper outer pipe. It seems to have one only because copper is more malleable than other types of pipe and so the Chillzilla can be more easily manufactured and kept small.  Even then, can either of these compete with a plate chiller?  It seems that most of the cost of a plate chiller is in manufacturing, and most of the cost of a copper-based chiller comes from raw materials. For the same price, I can go for a janky-looking, bulky hose-based chiller, or a Shirron plate chiller.  I know there are cleaning concerns with plate chillers, but is that really enough to warrant the price difference, given the difference in performance? "
1454,Kettle volume measurements,Eventually there comes a time where just boiling 6 gallons for 60 minutes and taking it on faith that you have 5 gallons left doesn't cut it anymore.  What tools can I use to measure the volume in the kettle when its boiling? Should I make a correction for the increased volume due to temp? What is the correction? 
1455,What is the difference between Caramel Malts and Crystal Malts?,They are not always one in the same.  I believe the process for making them are slightly different as well.  I just don't know what that difference is.  How do they differ? Where are they made? 
1456,"Would/Could you add boiled, rehydrated extract after wort is cooled & topped off to boost OG?","Imagine this scenario.  Not that I know anybody who's done this.  Let's say it's hypothetical.  You're brewing from extract.  You cool your wort, transfer it to your fermenter, add your top-off water, and take a gravity reading.  You discover that your OG is much lower than you expect.  You shake the fermenter a bunch and take another reading.  Still low.  So you look at the recipe.  You see it called for:   2.75 lb DME 6.6 lb LME   It's then that you realize that you brewed with 2.75 lbs of DME and 2.75 lbs of LME.  You curse yourself for buying ""fresh"" DME that came in a bucket from the shop instead of just buying two 3.3 lb cans.  You want to blame the bucket, but in the end you know you're just dumb.  At this point, with the wort chilled, transfered, and topped off to 5 gallons, but the yeast not yet pitched, would it be OK to bring, say, two quarts of water to a boil, add the other ~4 lbs of LME you forgot, boil it until it's fully dissolved, cool it, then add it to the fermenter?  This seems like it would be a sort of late addition, albeit a really late addition.  Would you do this?  Should I have done this?  I panicked... I mean my hypothetical character panicked and never thought of doing this to correct the OG until just now.  It's too late now, obviously, but if I'd have done this would it have done more harm than good? "
1457,Estimating Alpha Acids of Home Grown Hops,For the homebrewer that grows and harvests his/her own hops; how best can one approximate the alpha acids in the hops they have?  Is it worth it or should brewers stick to using home grown hops for aroma and flavor? 
1458,Hop Gardening Considerations,I have heard that planting hops at home you should plant the rhizome in a mound of sorts.  How large around should the mound be? What type of soil amendments are best? How tall should the trelis be for the first year of growth? 
1459,Thawing Frozen Beer,"I have a couple kegs of beer that froze out in the garage this winter.  What effects should I expect on flavor, head retention and body after thawing? My beer was relatively sediment free, but would you expect accelerated lysis of any yeast in the beer upon freezing? "
1460,Adding Oak Flavor/character to beer,"Short of buying an oak barrel, what forms of oak are available to the homebrewer for getting oak into yuor beer?  Are they available with different levels of toast? Are some forms easier to sanitize that others? Do some take more time or less time to get flavor? "
1461,Can I skip the mash out replacing it by sparging?,I'm a new homebrewer and have a newbie question: can I skip the mash out time just replacing it by sparging since the water temperature is the same? What kind of things can happen doing this?  Thanks! 
1462,How much bourbon is the right amount?,"When adding something like bourbon (or other whiskeys) to the secondary, how much do you add? I realize this will differ based on recipes, tastes, and styles, but what is a good range? How much is so minimal that you won't taste it, and how much is so much that it will overpower the grains and significantly increase the ABV of the final product?  "
1463,Reusing yeast at home,"Reusing yeast at home is something I'm incredibly interested in, but haven't found the time to learn enough about it just yet.  What are the basic steps for harvesting, cultivating, or whatever other term you want to use, in order to reuse yeast from previous batches of homebrew?  What equipment is required?  What equipment is helpful, but not necessary?  What are some of the most important things to watch out for?  What other advice can you give on the topic?  What are some other resources that might help the homebrew yeast cultivator?   EDIT  More questions, from JackSmith:  Do you do anything differently when you know you're going to harvest your yeast?   Do you filter out hop sediment when you usually don't?   Do you only harvest yeast from neutral-flavored light beers?  "
1464,What is a proper blow-off tube setup?,"36 hours ago I brewed a BIG red ale and pitched some kick-ass WLP001. The picture on the left is what I had late last night (24 hr in). Made me a little nervous. And this morning the krausen had nearly reached the stopper. In the pre-work morning rush I rigged up this blow-off tube with a 1/4"" tubing, the universal stopper, my 6 gal brew kettle (the most readily available container), a HUGE binder clip (for weight), 2 qt. of water, and a little sanitizer. With a little coercion, the tube fit tightly into the stopper and CO2 starting bubbling in the kettle.   This got me thinking, what's the best way to do this? What size tubing? The elevation of the container vs. the elevation of the vessel? How much water? Sanitize it all?  ps- don't mind my cluttered closet :]    "
1465,How do new yeast strains happen?,"Rogue and Papazian have their own yeast strains (PacMan and Cry Havoc, respectively). Do you know how they got there?  Lots of trial and error? Pitching multiple strains?  Let's say I pitch a bunch of different strains into a batch and stumble on something awesome.  I'm still bound by not repitching past the 6-8 generation, and the core culture only lasts 2-3 months.  If I discover the next amazing strain through experimentation, what do I do then? "
1466,Do you strain break material from DME boiled for priming?,"When you prime with DME, there is a bit of break material formed when you boil the DME.  How to brew mentions this, but doesn't say what to do about it or if you should care.  Do you strain this material out?  I recently primed with DME for the first time and did get a wee bit of break material, but I'm not sure a seive would have even caught it.  Is cheese cloth the answer?  Or do you just dump it into your bottling bucket? "
1467,Measuring Gravity,"What is the usual procedure for measuring gravity?  Is it typical to just take an original and final gravity measurement or should measurements be taken throughout?  I've heard people talk about taking readings throughout the process to dictate where the beer is at; do they just drop their hydrometer into their carboy and leave it there throughout the brew or do they risk contamination by taking samples out?  Also, do I need to record/account for exact temperature when I take readings? "
1468,Using a keg for secondary fermentation and natural carbonation?,"I would like to transfer a beer that has been fermenting for about 3 weeks directly into a Cornelius keg for secondary fermentation AND carbonation.   I would like to add priming sugar and naturally carbonate in the keg, not force carbonate it. After a few weeks, I would then like to put the keg on pressure and serve   Questions   How much priming sugar would I use for 5 gallons of beer? How should I prep the keg? Other than cleaning it, should it be filled with CO2 prior to racking? Any problems in general with this?  "
1469,Can you mash bananas?,I've been thinking about making a wheat-beer with bananas and a little bit of chocolate malt. My question is can you mash bananas in the mash-tun to convert the sugars/starches and get more banana flavor into the brew?  I got the idea from my wife while I was looking at a dark wheat recipe. She was making chocolate covered frozen bananas for our girls and the wheat recipe had a little chocolate malt in it. I thought 'why not accentuate the banana flavor and aroma in the beer instead of trying to keep it down?'  Does anyone know if it is possible?  Cheers. 
1470,[WIKI] Characteristics of a Good Cellaring Beer,"Every once and a while I come across beers that say they can be kept up to 5 years and become more developed over that time period, while other beers that are of the same style don't indicate this at all.  I know that some styles are defined by how long they can be cellared, but for other styles how do you know?  So my main question is:  What are the main characteristics that differentiate normal cellaring period beers from beers with extended cellaring periods?  Does it have to do with the amount of hops?  The amount of alcohol?  The type of yeast?  EDIT: In retrospect, this looks like it would be a good wiki question since it's more of an information gathering topic than a personal, concise question.   Here is a compiled list of comments made below as well as answers found elsewhere: Please feel free to edit this list (it is a wiki).  These are the characteristics that people have associated with good cellaring beers:   Wild yeast beers High alcohol content Proper storage throughout the lifetime of the beer High SRM/EBC -- Dark Color   Styles of beers that lend themselves to cellaring:   Lambic Barleywine Oud Bruin Belgian Ale Imperial Stout   Characteristics that can develop throughout cellaring:   Floral hop character diminishes Hop bitterness diminishes, but at a much slower rate Flavor complexity is developed Malt character is developed Can develop sherry and port-like characteristics   Keep these characteristics in mind when selecting or designing a beer that you wish to cellar for an extended period of time.  Here's a good resource I found about cellaring. "
1471,Dry hopping without secondary fermentation,"I have so far only done bottom-fermented beers without transferring into a second vessel for secondary fermentation. If I wanted to do some dry hopping with this technique, when is the best time to put the hops? Towards the end of fermentation into the fermenter or into the bottles when it is bottling time? "
1472,What yeasts are good for summer brewing?,"I decided last night that fermentation temperature control was not a priority for me (minimizing brew time and moving to kegs are ahead of it).  I have a basement that stays pretty cool, and four floors of A/C will be seeping down there, so I don't expect it to get too warm.  Some yeasts go as high as 75 for the recommended range, but get estery and nasty at that range.  Are there any yeasts that brew better beer in the mid-70's range? Are there any styles that lend themselves to warmer ambient temperatures?  Edit: I had great results with Wyeast 3711, French Saison.  See comment below. "
1473,stepping up a yeast starter,"I followed the instructions in Palmer's ""How To Brew"" (along with some modifications from a Jamil interview that I heard), for getting a yeast starter going. It is now sitting on my stir-plate, with a nice little krausen stitting on top - going on about 14hrs since pitching right now.   I would like to step up the starter to get a larger volume of yeast, but I'm not entirely clear on the proper process for this. Do I allow the krausen to fall back in, before chilling it and then adding more prepared wort? Or do I just toss it in the fridge at any point, to get the yeast to settle out? "
1474,Why is it bad to pitch too much yeast?,"What are the effects of over-pitching?  Where is the line for, say, a 1.050 beer?  There is also a question for to under-pitching. "
1475,"Does filtering beer strip flavor, aroma and/or color?","In the quest for super clear beer (and increase shelf stability) some brewers like to filter their beer. What impact does it have on flavor, aroma and color? Which aspects of flavor (hops only, malt and hops, only malt flavors)? Can any striping of these things be compensated for in the recipe? "
1476,"Do you filter water, or just use tap water?","Back when I started homebrewing, I used a Pur filter.  I've since moved and my kitchen sink won't accept any sort of filter.  I've brewed a few batches with just Fairfax County, VA tap water, and not noticed any real difference.  I was wondering what the consensus is: Do you use tap water? Filter with a faucet-mounted filter? Filter with a pitcher type filter? Pre-boil water?  Sub-question: Take the water as you get it (whether filtered or tap), or add minerals and whatnot? "
1477,What is cold steeping?,What is cold steeping specialty grains all about? How do I do it?  What does 'cold' really mean?  How long does it take? Advantages and disadvantages? 
1478,Should I ferment a new batch directly on the yeast cake generated by the previous batch?,"I'm going to re-use the yeast cake from a low-gravity batch to ferment a high-gravity batch.     Can I just put the wort directly on it?  Does it then need to be agitated? Is it worth the risk of contamination to take the whole yeast cake out, wash it, strain it, and actually re-pitch it? Is there a term for this complete re-use of a yeast cake?   UPDATE  Pouring down on the yeast cake of the previous batch is something I do regularly and with great effect. I don't remove anything from the carboy and I only step up in gravity. This might be helped by the fact that I only use leaf hops and they do a great job latching onto break material. I also use a boil screen, so there's very little trub anyway.  Yes, you can put the wort directly in. No, it doesn't need to be agitated, but a bit of shaking for aeration doesn't hurt.  I can't speak to risk of contamination with removing and repitching slurry, but I can say that the risk of contamination with pouring down is less.  FURTHER UPDATE  I still do this regularly with good results. I wanted to do some testing on how much ester production is inhibited by this degree of overpitching, so I tried making a light saison, with Wyeast French Saison (3711). (It's amazing yeast, by the way.) It was effectively Northern Brewer's Petite Saison d'Ete recipe, but at a 1.036 gravity. I made that batch, kegged it, then poured down a 1.080 biere de garde onto the cake. Fermentation was vigorous and healthy. The beer is missing nothing in the ester/character department. This beer had as much character and interest as anything I've made, even with being massively overpitched by homebrew standards.   Long story short: you can make very good beer like this, especially big beers. "
1479,Are residual starches bad for the beer?,"I was reading another question here and it appears that the consensus is that the iodine test isn't all that useful if your recipe is good. But, while reading through everything, I had a thought: if you're hitting your OG, is there anything bad that might be caused by starch remaining in the beer (e.g. extra haziness, early spoilage, possible food for infections)? Or will it just settle out/remain harmlessly in solution? "
1480,Increasing Malt Aroma,"How does one get more malt aroma out of a recipe?   If I want more roasty aroma I know I can add more roasted malt.  But eventually, there is appoint where I can't have too much or the recipe itself suffers.  Are there any process steps to be taken that can increase maltiness, toastiness, etc etc? "
1481,Splitting whole hops in half,"When using whole, wet hops (or maybe even dried for that matter), is there any disadvantage to splitting the cones in half?  Is there any data available to support splitting them in the first place, such as a stronger aroma in the finished beer?  I believe that the increased surface area would be preferred when dry hopping, but every picture I see of this has intact hops.  For the purpose of the question, assume that they are split by latex gloved hand or with a sanitized knife and dropped directly into the kettle or fermenter less than a minute later. "
1482,Coriander steep technique,"If I crack or grind coriander for a steep at the end of a boil, will it settle out or should I pour through a strainer when transferring to to primary?  Should I add before or after flameout?   "
1483,Autosiphon not sealing,"While racking beer to kegs today, my autosiphon started leaking air.  Bubbles started at the bottom, and went throughout the tube.  I assume that this is due to a poor seal between the pump portion and the housing portion of the stiff plastic pump.  Has anyone else had this experience?  Is this a common failure mode for autosiphons? "
1484,What's the best technique to add rosemary to a beer?,I'd like to brew a pale ale with rosemary and am looking for the right technique.  I've read various techniques from adding it late in the boil to adding it in the secondary.  What technique have you had the best success with?   How much should I use? Fresh or dried? When should I add it? How long should I leave it in for?  
1485,Modifying flavors during bottling?,"Almost two weeks since brew day, hydrometer with the same reading everyday so I guess Sunday will be the bottling day.  I've tried a bit of the beer after taking out some for measurement purposes.   My first batch is a dry brown ale and I asked for non too american hoppy flavor, I do not like it very much (I'm a spaniard living in SF so IPA aroma is driving me crazy xD)  I've noticed that the beer is very bitter, sourness has almost disappeared.  How the flavors change during aging in the bottle? Is the a way to do this bitterness lighter?  I think I'll be ok with this beer, but maybe my partners are expecting kind a malty, sweet result.    "
1486,Cider apples: what's in the foam on top of my juice?,"When I juice tart apples (cored and peeled, centrifugal planer type juicer), I get cloudy juice and lots of mealy foam on top. The bubbles are tough. They last for days and I can freeze the foam. What's in the foam and what would it bring to the fermentation? Is there more or less sugar in there compared to the juice? "
1487,How to correct Mead with too much citrus?,"I put 5 oranges into my first 5 gallon mead and after 3 weeks it tastes overpoweringly like grapefruit. I don't like grapefruit.   At 10 days, I racked 2 gallons into a carboy with 2 lb of mulberry (no acid in mulberry) and that batch is very much drinkable now. The other 3 gallons was racked to a separate carboy where it now has an inch of sediment, plus powerful grapefruit aroma.   Will the citrusy batch get less acid over time, or can I do something to it? Could I add honey without the yeast eating it all? I'd like it to be sweeter, to mask or neutralize the citrus, but not as fruity as the mulberry.   The yeast was 5 mg Red Star Cote des Blancs and it worked fast (5 days.)  The pH of each batch is now 3.5 or 4, and SG is 1.00. "
1488,Effects of pectin,"I often see recipes (usually for fruit mead or beer) warning against boiling fruit for fear that it will release pectin. I know that this is important for making jam, and bad for home brewing. What I don't quite know is why it's a bad thing. Does pectin have a negative impact on the fermentation process? Is it bad for yeast? Does it negatively affect flavour? Does it affect aging? Why is it so important to avoid pectin? "
1489,Fast versus Slow Fermentation,"So I pitched a cider and the yeast blitzed through the batch in 48 hours (SG=1.050, FG=1.000). I noticed that the temperature went from 72F to over 76F during the fermentation (I really don't have a way to control the temperature of the carboy, the room temperature was 70F). So, my question is, how does the accelerated fermentation effect the taste of a brew? I sampled the final product and it seems to be ok, about what I would expect before bottle conditioning for at least a couple of weeks. Any expression of past experiences from the brewmeisters here would be appreciated.  edit:  A followup question to the two of you (JS and DC). I use premier cuvee or cote des blanc yeast for my ciders. Any suggestions for optimal temperature ranges specifically for ciders? I figured out that I could use a water bath to use the heat capacity to control the temperature better (I have VERY little space to work in) with cold packs tossed in, but wonder how low is too low? "
1490,After how long of a boil will LPT1 and other head retention proteins denature?,"I've read that certain proteins denatured during the wort boil is responsible for causing great, delicious foam.  I don't get me no foam.  I'm also doing partial boils using extract.  So my question is twofold: I could boil 10 liters (out of 25) with the hops for ~60 minutes, and then boil an additional 10 liters of malt/water for a shorter time. How long would that shorter time have to be to denature the protein? 5 minutes? 10? 60?  Also, since I am using extract my wort comes preboiled. Does this mean it doesn't matter if I boil all malt or not? Does it mean that I will have worse head retention no matter what, compared to all-grain? "
1491,How long do I need to maintain my fermentation temperature?,"Do I need to maintain my desired temperature until bottling or take it out of the ""ferm chamber"" after  initial fermentation is done?  What about with long term brews such as sours? "
1492,Can the final gravity be multiplied by the ratio of beer to water?,"If one ends-up with, say, half as much beer as needed to float the hydrometer, is dilution a viable way to get a measurement?    For instance, if one carefully measured the volume of available beer for the sample, mixed that beer with the same volume of water, then floated the hydrometer and took a reading, could that result be multiplied by 2 to get a valid gravity of the undiluted beer? "
1493,What's the maximum mash time?,"In this question, Basic Brewing Radio was quoted as saying longer mashes (up to 90 minutes) were ""better"".  It seems as if there are practical limitations with maintaining temperature, as well as just wanting to limit the amount of time spend on the process.  But setting aside these kinds of things, what would be the longest you would want to mash?  In other words, you have a mash tun that holds temperature perfectly and you have all the time in the world.  What ""bad"" things happen, if any, when you hold your mash at a target temperature for 2 hours, 4 hours, 8 hours? "
1494,"What effect does cooling, then warming have on finished beer?","The common wisdom I have known is that cooling, warming, then cooling beer again would cause it to ""skunk.""  I now know that skunky flavors are typically the result of exposure to light, not temperature cycles.  Are there detrimental effects to cooling, warming, then cooling beer again?  What is the effect of multiple cooling and warming cycles? "
1495,Alternatives to campden tablets,"I'd heard (3rd-hand information, don't know how reliable it is) that aspirin (Bayer's original brand) can be used as a suitable substitute for campden tablets. Does anyone know how well this works? I ask because I need some campden tablets and the brewing supply store near me is closed for renovations, and won't open for a while. Are there other easy-to-get alternatives to campden? "
1496,Day 2 of Primary Fermentation of beer,Is this what my primary fermentation should look like after a day???  It looks like my yeast has been sitting on top of foam..   
1497,storing bottles,"Simple question: How do you store a lot of bottles (empty and full) in a small space?  I get a lot of bottles from friends, often arriving to me in 6-packs, and I have some odds and ends (i.e. 500mL, 1L, etc) that really don't fit anywhere.  I've tried using milk crates, but they don't really work because the grid doesn't really let a bottle sit flat.  Has anybody found a relatively inexpensive solution? "
1498,"When using campden tablets to dechlorinate water, how much sulfite makes it into the final beer?","I have a friend who is allergic to sulfites in wine, so he sticks to drinking beer.  I use campden tablets to dechlorinate my water, at a rate of one tablet per 10 gallons.  How much sulfite makes it into the final beer when treating water this way?  How does it compare to sulfite levels in wine? "
1499,"Keeping my pale ale ""pale""","I brew from extract, boiling on an electric stove (in an apartment).  Every beer I've brewed has been darker than I expected, which isn't an issue most of the time as I generally prefer darker beers... However, I'd like my next attempt at a pale ale to come out pale!    I think this is primarily caused by the way I'm boiling, essentially caramelizing on the bottom of my brew pot.  Is this correct?  Any suggestions on avoiding it, or generally keeping an ale light colored? "
1500,off flavors and sanitizing/scratched plastic,"I've read through the various posts here and the common wisdom is that off flavors are because of poor sanitizing or using scratched plastic carboys/buckets. I'd like to read from some of the ""master brewers"" here and get their take on this commonly held notion.  Here is the basis for my question:   Palmer's reference has very few off flavors that he mentions as a function of cleaning and none from using scratched fermenters. So, if you know that you are using proper sanitizing technique, have you still produced off flavors? If so, were you able to track down the source as something different than Palmer's observations?   Another commonly held notion is that glass is better than plastic because plastic scratches and these become sources of infection and off flavors. Have you ever had this happen with scratched plastic carboys when you knew that you sanitized properly at the beginning?  "
1501,"HopRocket (hopback) questions: ""captive"" wort and effect at beginning vs. end of run","Brewed a double IPA last Sunday and used a HopRocket as a hopback for the first time (standard setup: kettle -> HopRocket -> counterflow chiller -> fermenter using gravity feed.) Overall very pleased with the device. Seemed to add a hop character that was quite different than hops in the kettle or dry hopping. We brew 10G batches and split the output from the kettle into 2 carboys. First half of the ""drain"" goes into one carboy, last into the second.  I'm interested in knowing if anyone has done any testing on the effects of a hopback at the beginning vs. end of the run. Will there be noticeable differences between the carboys? We thought about swapping the output hose more frequently to try and even out any differences, but that seemed like too much work. For those of you that use a hopback and split the output, how do you handle this?  Also the HopRocket ""captured"" about 5 cups of wort. Is there any way other than a pump to get this wort to drain through the chiller? Seemed a shame to waste that so we froze it and may use it for priming. "
1502,Bittering hop contribution to flavor,How much do bittering hops contribute to flavor?  Does a hop addition at the beginning of a 60m boil result in the destruction of most that hop's flavor compounds? 
1503,What are some good homebrewing magazines?,What is a great brewing magazine?     Why do you like it?   What does it do well?   Why is it better than the others?  
1504,Best way to store empty kegs,"After using, then cleaning a keg with PBW, what is the best way to store the cleaned keg?  I may not use the keg for a while, and I would like to avoid mold growing in any residual water (for example).  Should I: sanitize after cleaning? store with the lid off to encourage drying? something else? "
1505,Lots of trub affecting specific gravity readings?,"I'm in the process of making a pretty big pumpkin beer, and just transferred to secondary. There was an incredible amount of trub -- probably 1.5 gallons out of a 5 gallon batch. I guess it was a combination of a lot of malt and a lot of pumpkin. The beer had been in primary for about 10 days and so it was pretty well settled, and I think I got all the usable beer out of it I could.  Aside from being a little sad that my yield is down to 3.5 gallons, I have a couple concerns:   Is the large amount of stuff that settled out going to affect my ABV calculations? I.e., was all that stuff in suspension originally, and artificially inflated my OG reading (1.072)? Should I reduce the amount of priming sugar I would typically, to avoid over-carbonation? Is it common to lose so much volume to trub, and is there anything I should do about it in the future?   EDIT: So there are two answers, one saying that suspended solids do not change specific gravity readings, one saying that they do. There must be a correct answer to this question, right? "
1506,Peanut Butter Chocolate Stout- Cocoa or Nibs?,"I'm looking to piece together a Peanut Butter Chocolate Stout recipe and I torn between using powdered cocoa late in the boil or cocoa nibs in secondary. Any suggestions?   Also, with either suggestion, how much do you suggest using for a moderate amount of chocolate flavor? "
1507,Mash process vs specialty grains,"Everybody can buy a certain number of specilaty grains and combine them, but in a way it seems to me this way I will do something that someone else can do just replicating my grain choice. On the other hand mash process seems to be much more complex and with infinite variation in temperature values, time, with even more variability added by different processes (standard vs decoction for example).  How much mash temperature and process can influence malty/sweet aroma of the final beer compared to specialty grains? (I am talking about light specialy grains, obviously there is a wide range of grains with aromas that can't be compared to those that mash develops). Which one of the two is the most powerful, or they can be equivalent? "
1508,"Boil size, ABU's and adding LME","I see version of this question has been asked, so apologies for the repeat but its never quite answered in the way I need.  I made a batch last night and noticed half way through the process that lowering the boil size had seriously dropped my IBU's (40 vs 8). My pot size limits me to about 5L once the hops are in. Its a simple recipe using LME, DME, dextrose and fresh hops. The recipe didn't address when to add the sugars, only the hops so I had to wing it. I boiled 2/3 hops for 60 mins, added the LME at 40 mins into the boil, hops at 7 mins and the DME after flame out.  After reading around I am still left with a couple of questions:   Can hopes add bittering without sugar? I've made hop tea before using only water. Is my IBU reduced to the same extent if I did not add LME until late in the boil? Is there a formula for figuring this out as I now have no idea what I just made. My only gauge is that the wort had a strong bitter aftertaste.   Thanks for your help.  Jamie "
1509,Is using brass ball valves safe?,"I heard the other day that using brass in your brewery set-up is a bad idea?! Well I have brass ball valves from the hardware store on all my kettles. I know that typical brass has lead in it but is this type of brass the same? Is it dangerous? If so, how? "
1510,Contact time for sanitizing bottles with diversol,"To sanitize bottles with diversol can I simply put the solution in a vinator, pump it into the bottle a couple of times and rinse?   Or does it require to soak in the bottles for 20 minutes? "
1511,What is the quickest way to heat mash / sparge water?,"Using a propane burner, is one of the following methods quicker / more efficient than the other? If so why?  a) Heat 2.82 gallons of water from 70 degrees to boiling and then add 1.12 gallons of 70 degree water to get 4 gallons of 170 degree water.  b) Heat 4 gallons of water from 70 degrees to 170 degrees directly. "
1512,Estimating final alcohol by Original Gravity,Is it possible to estimate final alcohol value from the orginal gravity of the wort? Is apparent attenutaion involved in the estimation?  I guess if I know OG and FG this is the answer. What if FG is not know? 
1513,Kegerator Parts for Ball-lock kegs,"I know the difference between ball-lock and pin-lock kegs. My question arises in the fact my kegerator is set up for a commercial keg and I need to convert it to fit my ball-lock keg.   This is the Kegerator I have  Does anyone know the dimensions of the tubing/barbs/anything else I might need to hook up a standard CO2 tank to the ball-lock keg, then to a single tap draft tower?   *note - I do have the ball-lock connectors (liquid out and CO2 in)for the top of the keg. "
1514,Growing hops from seeds,"Where I live (France) I can't easily find hops rizhomes, but I can find seeds, so my two questions are:   Any shop in France/Europ from which I can buy hops rizhomes? If I grow hops from seeds how do I identify female plants?  "
1515,Considering adding Fresh Ginger to a 'Simply Ginger Beer' kit,"I'm about to start a brew using a 'Simply Ginger Beer' kit. I've heard that it's sweet, and light which is what I want, but it's not very gingery. Would it be ok to add some grated and boiled fresh ginger at the point the batch is first made up? Or would it be better to add it after a week or so?   The next obvious question is: What would be a good starting quantity? I'm not sure if we're talking 50g or 500g!   Other info: I'm fermenting it in a 5 gallon glass carboy.  Will be using 1kg brew enhancer. Will be using the included yeast/sweetener sachet. I plan to bottle it in flip-tops at the end.  I'm new to this, I've only done 4 or 5 kit brews with varying degrees of success.  Thanks!  Ben "
1516,Making a starter without DME?,"Planning to start to use liquid yeasts and will need to do some starters.  It is hard to get hold of DME over here (I can get some hopped LME, though).  I was thinking on doing a starter from grains, do I need to do a full 60 min boil for the starter?  In theory all the sugars the yeast will need are already on the wort when I finish mashing so a short boil (or even pasteurization) just to cripple the competition would be enough? Or do I need to care about DMS, proteins and such for the starter? "
1517,Is this lactobacillus?,"My last batch had a thin whitish 'membrane' on top of it and some white spots, visible on the picture bellow.  I think I saw something similar on a blog a while ago, attributed to a lactobacilus infection.  Taste was not too bad, but the smell was a bit strange, I went ahead and bottled 3 days ago.  What is that? Should I be prepared for bottle bombs?   "
1518,Ensuring an accurate gravity reading,"So I've brewed between 6-10 batches of beer at home using partial boil methods but have never managed to get accurate gravity readings.   The issue I have is that my readings somehow always seem to be way higher than most  gravity-abv charts ive seen allow for, even when i try and account for temperature.  For example, today I brewed something akin to a DIPA which used 9 lbs of liquid malt (6 pilsner, 3 amber) in a 5 gallon batch. After adding a hops, chilling and adding water to get to the desired 5 gallons, I extracted some and got an OG reading of 1.12 which puts me in the running for maybe a 15% abv beer, which seems hard for me to believe.  Is this a reasonable number considering how much malt I used? Something I have noticed is that in my OG readings theres always a very large amount of sediment since I usually extract the liquid soon after everything is in my fermentation chamber. Could this sediment be affecting my readings?  as a small aside, i've been trying to use a wine thief to get readings and it always seems to get clogged due to high amounts of sediment in the fermentor. Is there a way around this aside from getting something akin to a turkey baster?  Thanks for the help! "
1519,Peracetic acid as a sanitizer?,"My friend got Paracetic Acid from his LHM store (they only had that and alcohol 70 there).  Is it a non-rinse sanitizer? How good is it?  Wikipedia says it corrodes metals, so no go for the crown caps?  Does it have any other applications (thinking cleaner).  Anything else he should know? "
1520,Forgot bottle capper - priming interrupted,"I was all ready to bottle up my IPA last night (and yes, since this is StackExchange, I named the brew ""IPAddress""). Everything got sanitized, bottles were de-labeled, the whole nine yards. I boil the priming sugar, pour it in, give it a stir, and it's looking lovely. I grab the first bottle, a cap, and....and where's the capper?  I spent the majority of last night turning my apartment over, looking for the dang thing. No dice - my best guess is I left it behind at my former apartment in a drawer. I re-airlocked the brew, having exhausted my options, and am going to purchase a new capper.  At this point, what are the effects on the finished beer going to be? Introducing more sugar is going to introduce more alcohol, and I have to wait until the yeast has chewed through everything I just introduced to it before attempting to prime it again. Am I freaking out unnecessarily?  Thanks for your help, and happy brewing! "
1521,How long can I leave my Ginger Beer (kit) in the primary?,"Another fact finding question: How long can I - theoretically - leave my Ginger Beer brew in the primary (a 5 gallon glass carboy) before bottling?   The instructions suggest 8 days, hovever it's fermenting slow due to low temps, so I'm expecting at least 2 weeks. But if I wanted to bottle it in say a month, would that be bad? "
1522,Temperature control equipment and Fresh Wort Kits,"My first brewing attempt (from a can) has just finished bottle fermenting and it turned out pretty bad (mostly just tasted very weak). I'm not concerned though, I know what mistakes I made along the way, and I'm already excited about my next batch.  For this next one, I want to ensure I have proper temperature control (one of my main mistakes). So, I've got this fridge spare. From what I understand, I'll need to buy the following items to control it:    FridgeMate Temperature Controller Stainless Steel Probe Jiffy Box   Is this everything I need?  I was thinking, then I would try a Fresh Wort Kit (baby steps!). Is it then simply a matter of:   Pour wort into fermenter Add appropriate yeast Put in fridge, set temperature, wait Bottle after FG is stable in a week or so   Thanks in advance, I really appreciate the assistance :)  EDIT: one final question. With most Fresh Wort Kits - do I need to worry about storage time or temperature? Or is that only once fermentation begins? "
1523,Hydrometer correction equation,Can you identify the constants in your hydrometer correction equation?  I know that 2.6X10-6 is the coefficient of thermal expansion for the hydrometer glass; what are the others (not related to converting F to C)? 
1524,"Are there Cooling ""Spirals"" or similar devices?","Not sure if that's on-topic, but I'm converting an old barrel into a tap system. Essentially a Keezer, except that I don't like something that still looks like an appliance - a barrel is just more authentic.  The problem: How do I cool the kegs inside? Since it's not needed to be permanently one (it's for a weekly or biweekly event), I could just dump in a bunch of ice every time I need to bring out the bar, but I'm lazy and that's boring :)  I know that there are heating spirals, but I wonder if there are cooling spirals or other flexible ways that I just plug into a power outlet and have it cool my two 5-gallon kegs? "
1525,Yeast pitching and wort cooling,"I'm making an American Brown Ale and added liquid yeast to the wort that may have been too hot. The yeast was in the fridge and out to cool for 45 minutes. My guess is:  Wort temp: 26-27C or about 80F  Liquid yeast temp: 8C or about 47F   Does it sound like I killed the yeast?  If so, what kind of dry yeast should I get to add to the beer?  "
1526,Mash-produced unfermentable sugars do add sweetness and aroma?,"I read in some sources that mash conditions can influence the production of dextrins, that are not fermentable, have no taste (is that correct?) and add body to the beer. But somewhere else I read that mash conditions can contribute to sweetness (for example with decoction mash), what kind of compounds are produced during mash that will give some malty flavor or sweetness in finished beer? "
1527,Recovering from low mash efficiency - under-shot pre-boil gravity,"For whatever reason, Beersmith decided to have me lauter my all-grain recipe with an exorbitant amount of water.  I don't have the exact recipe in front of me at the moment (can provide details later if necessary), but from what I recall looking at the brew steps, I was aiming for a 6 gallon batch, and it had me mashing with 4.5 gallons, sparging with ~9.  I knew something was off when I looked at the brew step that said I should end the boil with 7.5 gallons, to achieve a 6 gallon amount for fermentation.   I have no idea how these numbers came about, but I certainly did not sparge with all 9 gallons.  Maybe 7-8, and my pre-boil gravity was well under what Beersmith estimated.  It was a batch sparge, no mash out.  Again, I can't provide specifics at this very moment, but instead of correcting that recipe, I was more curious about what can be done in the event that your pre-boil gravity is lower than expected?  In my case I had between 7 - 8 gallons going into the boil kettle, I just let it boil down for about 1 - 2 hours before I began my hop additions.  In the long run, surprisingly I wound up at about 5.5 - 6 gallons of wort to go into the fermenter when it was all said and done, but what is the normal method for correcting an under-shot pre-boil gravity?  Is sacrificing quantity the only way of correcting this sort of shortcoming? "
1528,Methods for cleaning and drying tubing,"Brewing 5 gallon batches at home.  During the transfer from my primary fermenter to the secondary, and when filling bottles from my bottling bucket I constantly need to use plastic tubing to transfer the beer/wort. After Im done i give these tubes a thorough rinse but often find that there are small specks of yeast/hops that get stuck in the tube that seem impossible to wash out. are there any good methods for cleaning these tubes or am i expected to buy new tubing for each brew?  Ive also found that even if i do manage to clean them well enough that there is no visible residue, drying these tubes is a pain as well. Ive tried hanging them up or using the dishwasher, but either they deform under the heat or there is condensation that forms which is impossible to remove that eventually starts to mold.  Any tips? Thanks! "
1529,About going BIAB,"I'm thinking about making the switch to BIAB, primarily as a result of a growing family and increased time constraints. I have a few questions before I make the jump.   How long is a typical BIAB brew day? What (if any) are the major drawbacks to using this method of brewing?  How large a volume kettle am I look at to brew 5 gallon batches? Any tips or tricks to getting the best efficiency out of your BIAB setup? Are there any changes that need to be made to the recipe in order to make the recipes ""work""?  "
1530,What equipment is needed for a faucet? What's a shank?,"I've bought a kegging system which came with a ""Camping Style"" faucet, essentially just some tubing with a ball lock disconnect on one end and a tiny plastic faucet on the other end.  I'm looking for a more permanent installation (inside a barrel). Naively, I thought I just get a faucet and some tubing, but then I saw beer shanks which seem to sit between the faucet and the tube? (and how thick is the tubing in that case?)  What exactly do I need going from a 5 Gallon Ball-Lock Soda Keg into my glass? "
1531,Using brewing sugar (or equivalent) as the only fermentable?,"What would the result be of a brew done with say, brewing sugar (or equivalent), used as the only fermentable?  Quite an ambiguous question I know - obviously flavour is dependant on many factors, but in general, would there beer any 'weird' flavours that would normally be masked/Non-existant in a standard brew?  What about body? Head retention? How it pours? Etc. Etc.  Any details welcome!   Thanks. "
1532,Turning off co2 tank necessary when regulator psi set to 0?,I am in the habit of turning off my co2 tank even when I have closed the check valve on my regulator and set the psi for the regulator to 0. Is this necessary for safety reasons?   Going even further could I just close the check valve on the regulator and leave the regulator psi at 10 psi (for example)?  The regulator and co2 tank could remain turned off for days if not weeks.  This is the regulator I have  
1533,Is it possible to use manifolds to transfer gas from one keg to another?,I have a standard manifold much like this one   A while back I thought of equalizing the pressure in two of my kegs by opening their check valves on the manifold. To test whether this would work I first opened one check valve 1 which was attached to a keg that was over carbed. I then made sure check valve 2 was not attached to anything and then I opened it up.   No gas came out of 2! Is this normal? Maybe I am wrong and I should attach a low pressure gauge to check valve 2 to actually read the pressure coming out? 
1534,What are the qualities to evaluate when purchasing a Burner for All-Grain brewing?,"I want to purchase a burner for all grain brewing. What are the qualities that I should look into for each product to compare them against each other?  I will be brewing indoors in my apartment if that makes a difference.  For example, I assume the higher the BTUs, the better. The quicker it takes to boil a certain quantity of water, the better.  What should I look for when purchasing a burner? "
1535,Effect of temperatures over beer oxidation,"Does temperature affect the oxidation of a beer ?   Is a beer at a high temperature, let's say 30C (86F), more susceptible to oxidation that one in low temperature near 0C (32F) ? "
1536,What is the best way to stop fermentation?,"I am thinking about brewing ginger beer for a bar I work at. This means it would be in a keg on a tap. I would like to ferment the ginger beer instead of pumping in CO2 but am unsure how to go about it. I've done quite a bit of research but the main question I can't find an answer to is how can I safely store my ginger beer in a keg after fermentation has provided enough carbonation without it continuing to ferment?  Being that we haven't done this yet we are not sure how quickly it will move so I would like to avoid any bursting, leakage, or getting too dry.  Is there a way to completely halt fermentation? Not just pause or slow down but entirely stop? I've also read about fermenting ginger beer using the probiotics already present in ginger but not a lot of info on how it may differ in this regard. May this technique provide better results?  Thanks for the help. All suggestions or information is greatly appreciated. "
1537,Just finished fermenting my first batch beer. Does this look... normal?,"In case it's relevant, here is the recipe:  Just finished my first batch of beer.

1539,What is the largest size batch that can be boiled with an Induction cooktop on a 120v outlet?,"My apartment has 120V outlets and my landlord probably won't install a 240v outlet.  This article on induction heating states that a 120v delivers a maximum of 2000 watts.   Almost all of the induction cooktops on Amazon are 1800 watts.  What is the largest size batch I can boil with a 120v outlet on an induction outlet? I would like to purchase a 15gallon kettle for 10 gallon batches, but this might be a deal breaker.   (edit - I have not all-grain brewed before, but my understanding is that for a 5 gallon batch, 6.5 gallons of wort are required due to evaporation and trub. Therefore, what is the largest amount of wort that can be boiled with an induction cooktop on a 120v outlet?) "
1540,How large of a Kettle to brew 5 gallon and 10 gallon batches? (All Grain),"If I want to brew a 5 gallon batch, how large of a kettle do I need to do so comfortably?  How about 10 gallons? "
1541,Which temperature do I ferment at: the recipe's temp or the yeast's recommended temp?,"So, I'm trying to brew a Mexican lager today. What I've done is taken Palmer's Cold But Not Baroque recipe and tweaked it a bit. However, instead of using Bohemian lager yeast, as the recipe calls for, I'm using WLP940.  Palmer's recipe calls for fermenting at 45°F (and then secondary at 35°F). However, according to White Labs, the optimum fermentation temperature is between 50°F and 55°F.  Should I be following the recipe's temperature or the yeast's optimum temperature? What about secondary fermentation temperature? "
1542,International flight kill my yeast?,"I live in Vietnam and there's a dearth of good beer. So I cobbled together some supplies and tried my first homebrew yesterday. I had the guidance of an expert so I feel it went really well, but my mentor wasn't there for the yeast pitching.  I purchased the Wyeast Direct Pitch Activator a few weeks ago and had a friend bring it here. I'm worried that between the week he hauled it around the US and 16 hour flight from San Francisco to Hong Kong it may have been killed. It can get quite cold in the aircraft luggage hold.  I cracked the smack pack a good 6 hours before pitching. The yeast nutrient did in fact break. It was kept at room temperature after smacking. And I pitched it about 10 hours ago 75 degrees was the wort temperature and 72 for the room. I'm not seeing any signs of fermentation.   My questions are:   How much longer should I wait to see any fermentation? If I don't see any at this point, what should I do?    I have some dry ale yeast I can throw in. "
1543,Confectioners sugar for priming?,I have a batch of wheat beer on the go at the moment and I'm wondering which sugar to use as priming sugar? In my local shop the priming sugar they sell looks just like confectioners/powdered/icing sugar. Is this the same? Is it fine for me to use confectioners sugar or is there a better alternative?  Thanks 
1544,Bottling high gravity FG barley wine,"My situation is similar to, but more extreme than:  Brewed an Oatmeal Stout and the gravity did not drop as much as predicted, should I re-pitch or add yeast nutrients/energizer?  Didn&#39;t reach target FG, pitched more yeast, gravity same after a week. Should I just bottle already?  Is this a bottle bomb waiting to happen?  I am brewing an Old Monster English Barley wine, here is the malt bill:  Batch Size: 11,50 L  Boil Size: 13,16 L Estimated OG: 1,110 SG Estimated FG: 1,025 SG Estimated Alcohol by Vol: 11,13 %   2,00 kg Muntons Extra Light DME [Boil for 10 min] Extract 52,49 %  1,00 kg Muntons Extra Light DME (6,0 EBC) Extract 26,25 %  0,23 kg Crystal Malt - 60L (Thomas Fawcett) (118,2Grain 5,91 %  0,23 kg Crushed caramel (6,0 EBC) Grain 5,91 %  0,06 kg Pale Chocholate (550,0 EBC) Grain 1,44 %  0,06 kg Special B Malt (354,6 EBC) Grain 1,44 %  0,25 kg Dextrose (Briess) (2,0 EBC) Sugar 6,56 %    I used the trub from a previous batch for yeast and the fermentation started fast and was very vigorous (and hot, I measured over 35C when the beer was at high krausen, I think this may have ruined the beer, but when I tasted it it tasted quite fine, but maybe with some weird off flavors I am hoping will disappear with aging). I added more wort in stages to not overwhelm the yeast.  My OG was around 1.112, and after 2 weeks of fermentation it is sitting quite steady at 1.045. This is 0.020 higher than what the recipe describes. I'm using WLP002 English Ale as yeast. My secondary only has room for half of my batch, and I will let that batch sit for some months, but the other half should be taken racked from the primary soon.  As I see it I have a few options:   Bottle now Wait another week Warm it up (it is sitting at 17C now) and stir to rouse the yeast and wait another week Pitch some WLP099 Super high gravity and wait another week   I am quite liking the taste of the sweetness it is at now and do not want any more alcohol in it. How would bottle conditioning work if I bottled at this FG? Would exploding bottles be a problem since the yeast is mostly done? "
1545,Slow Fermentation in cider,"Two weeks ago I started 2 gallons of hard cider from windfalls - washed and bruises cut out.  I pasteurized my own apple juice, kept it below boil.  No preservatives.  Everything was santitized with Starsan.  I used Nottingham yeast (1 gram each bottle)  Bubbles never escaped more than one  every 10 -15 seconds.  The hydrometor tonight reads 1.04. I can't remember what i started with. The room is about 55-60 F.     Tonight I added another 1/5 package yeast (expiry date Jan, 2015- Nottinghams)  and another 1/4 cup sugar.  the taste is sweet but a bit off -  yeasty? vinegary?   There is some scuzzy froth at the top.  I've heard nottingham is slow (and does okay in a cooler room) but I've moved one jar closer to the wood stove to see what happens. Bubbles are now rising in both about 1 every 5-6 seconds.  Cider not clear.    I'm not in a big hurry but I don't want all that juicing for our cider  to turn to vinegar! - Any ideas as to how i should monitor this? Thanks! "

1547,Basic yeast questions,"I've been researching online for months now in preparation for my first brew  but there are still questions to which I can find no answers.    Is yeast either dead or alive, i.e. works 100% or not at all, or can it deteriorate to a point in between? And is there a way to test its effectiveness before pitching? How trustworthy are the unbranded little sachets that come with a single can kit? Would I be better using a brand of recognised quality? Any advantage to 'starting' it with water and sugar before pitching? Is it a good idea to add extra yeast to a kit brew as an insurance, or is too much as bad as not enough? Do I need to add more yeast than comes with the kit if I add extra fermentables above the instructions? (for a higher ABV) Does anyone add yeast nutrient to kit brews?  "
1548,Alternative malt extract for Northwestern Gold LME,I was thinking of making this recipe but my homebrew store doesn't have any Northwestern Gold LME.  Would any old light malt extract be an okay replacement? A full list of (liquid) malt extracts I can buy is here.  Cheers 
1549,Is this pressure release valve missing a pull ring?,"This photo shows the lid off a keg I purchased. I think it's a manual release valve, but all the manual one I've seen online have pull rings. As requested, here is a photo of the back.  Will this work without the ring? Can I add a ring and make my pin lock just a bit easier to use? "
1550,Can I use my CO2 regulator as a inside keg pressure checker?,"If I force carbonate my keg, and after that I close my CO2 cilinder valve and plug my gas line into my gas in quick disconnect. Would this make my CO2 regulator to work as a spunding valve and let me regulate the CO2 pressure inside my keg? This things works in both flow ways?  If not, there is a way to properly measure the psi inside the keg without buying a pressure gauge for that? That's my plan on future, but for now I need to force carbonate (fast way) a keg, but don't want to take much time in trial and error when go dispensing my beer to get a perfect pouring. There is about 6 hours to my event, not enough time to the 'set it and forget' method. My kegs are pin lock, and doesn't have a pressure relief valve, what makes adjusting pressure when serving a little more difficult. "
1551,Cider fermentation stuck/stopped,"I attempted to make apple cider, buying Kirkland apple juice (6 Gallons) and 500g dextrose. All i did was pour in the juice and pitched the yeast (s04) ontop of the juice at about 20deg Celsius, O.G reading of 1056. The fermentation kicked off strong, bubbling and dropping gravity to 1034, here it has stopped on day 4 for the last 4 days. The wort did drop to 17deg celsius but aparrently this is within its temperature range? I have since raised the temp to 20-22 steady, and nothing... Should I pitch another packet of yeast? Is there any saving the cider? "
1552,Is it possible to do pressurized fermentation in a mini keg?,"I have been keen on moving from bottles to use kegs in my amateur home brews. Due to a lack of space and because I just like the size and mobility of the smaller kegs I'd like to try to use multiple mini kegs of about 5L size for a 20L+ brew.  I read about a trick for how to force carbonate the beer in mini kegs using sodastream bottles which seemed to make for a pretty convenient process.  I have also been reading about pressurized fermentation directly in the keg as a way to remove the carbonation step from the process which seems beneficial to me.  Unfortunately I have not been able to find any good sources on if this is feasible or not. I'm assuming that a mini keg can take the pressure, considering it can be force carbonated, although it would probably need a pressure release valve so it can be kept under a certain pressure (2-3 bar?).  I'm thinking it would mean a process similar to this:   Brew wort. Cool wort. Fill mini kegs with wort, aerate and pitch each keg with yeast. Fit kegs with pressure release valves set to a certain bar (and perhaps adjust over time?). Let it ferment and carbonate for 2 weeks. Tap the keg through a filter into glass and cheers!   I think the [website]Would this process be even possible and what pitfalls have I not considered? "
1553,What's the minimum size for a jockey box?,"I'm planning on build one cooler based dispensing system for my kegs. My previous experience was with a box with 2 aluminium coils (~15m long) and 2 faucets. It holds a 20 Kg ice pack. And the beer pour is just fine when the carbonation and settings are OK.  But, I've found that for a period of a party/beer session, that amount of ice is overshoot. If full of ice, the box let you drink cold beer for about 3 days very easy. I don't think that I need so much power to enjoy one or 2 kegs.  I want to repeat the coil size because its easy to buy here and I think its long enough. And my goal is to make the more portable system, so I will shot for just one line/faucet.  So my questions are:   how much small sized it could be to hold the coil and the ice? What's the minimum amount of ice to get the beer cold enough? (the temperature range of my city is within 15-32ºC, 20-25º most days; and I want to have an ice autonomy of at least 5 hours or 2-3 corny-kegs ful dispensing.)   Thanks "
1554,First homebrew batch very sweet,I recently made my first home brew batch using an off the shelf starter kit (English brown ale).  The beer is much sweeter than I was expecting and the alcohol content is ~3-3.5% (should be 4.5%).  Am I right in thinking that this may be because the yeast hasn't worked to its full potential meaning that the sugar may not have been converted to alcohol?  If this is the case could this be because the yeast is old?  Is there any other potential reason why my beer is overly sweet? 
1555,What makes a beer tap/faucet different from the water ones?,"I'm planning on build a cooler-based jockey box to drink my kegged beers. And was thinking what's the different things in a beer tap/faucet? I'm having trouble to find one with reasonable price in my town.  I understand that some faucets have 'cream function', or 'flow control' diferences, material finishes (stainless, chrome plated, brass, plastic..) but the standard/basic type just allow you to on/off your flow of beer. Rigth?  Can I simple choose other kind of tap to put on my draft box? That's just a matter of style or its needed by some reason? "
1556,Sour Mash - Pressurized Keg to hold mash?,"I'm trying my hand at a sour mash, and was thinking about using a keg to hold the warm mash for a few days so I can purge the 02 and very lightly pressure to avoid contamination. I was thinking about placing a space heater in my fermentation chamber that can keep the keg at around 110 degrees for 2-3 days. I plan on mashing the entire grist of a new Wit recipe I created. Has anyone done this before and experienced anything to watch out for? For instance, how hard is it to clear out the intake and output tubes after this? I was planning on a long soak of Idophor after this to sanitize, would I need to take further precautions not to infect future batches? Has anyone found a different approach that would work better? "
1557,My mead tastes sour. Did I make honey wine or is it spoiled?,"My mead tastes sour like dry white wine!  I made a batch of mead this January, just under 10L. It was made from honey that had fermented a bit (I got it cheap), but I boiled it with the water, so that would have been killed.  It was poured on two 5L jugs that were disinfected, and added some herb ""tea"" (also boiled), thyme in one, christmas-themed spices in the other.  I used port-yeast. I have previously made a batch from the same batch of honey that turned out fine, but then I used baking yeast.  Today I tried pouring over the mead from the jugs to bottles as it had cleared beautifully and stopped bubbling. The tops of the jugs has been covered with standard fermenting tubes with water in them.  As I poured, I tasted a bit, and it tastes nothing like mead.It's very sour, like a dry white wine. I don't like dry wine, so I think it tastes awful. But if I actually made honey wine, I don't want to toss it but rather give it away to someone who does like dry wine.  What is more likely? Is it honey wine, honey vinegar or just spoiled? Or did I just make a very dry mead? Is the yeast to blame? "
1558,How was beer brewed in ancient times without thermometers and electricity?,"I have read on Wikipedia that beer is a really ancient beverage brewed many millenia ago. However, thermometer is only several hundred centuries old, and electricity is an even newer invention.  How is it possible to brew beer without thermometers and electric heating elements (or gas stoves)? My opinion is that both are really necessary. Without a thermometer, you cannot know the temperature of mashing. If the temperature is too high, you have too much sugars that are not fermentable, and if the temperature is too low, the beer will become too dry. All of this, of course, assumes that one has approximately the correct temperature for the enzymes that convert starches to sugars. It is very hard for me to understand how one could have the temperature even approximately correct, because the mashing temperatures are so high that feeling the temperature with your fingers is not possible. So, my intuition is that without a thermometer, even converting the starches to sugars should be very hard.  Similarly, if you don't have electric heating elements or gas stoves, it is almost impossible to control the rate of heating. With heating being done by burning wood, the control is very crude and the time constants of control are long. So, even if thermometers had been available in ancient times, controlling the temperature of the mash would be very hard.  The part of boiling, of course, is easy because water in liquid form cannot exist above 100 degrees Celcius. Chilling the wort might be tricky, but there is plenty of evidence that even the ""no chill"" method can work. Fermentation temperature control obviously requires a solution, but fermentation temperature is not as critical as mashing temperature, and fermentation temperature can be approximately measured by feeling the temperature with your fingers.  Has anybody here brewed beer without measuring the mashing temperature and without using a temperature-controlled oven? If so, did it go well? "
1559,Possible to make whiskey from turbo wash?,"If I create a wash (between 20 and 22% using turbo yeast), would it be possible to use that wash to create a (weak) whiskey using oak chips or oak powder?  I would possibly like to do this without a barrel, and would like to do this without distilling. Is 22% strong enough to extract the flavours from toasted oak chips?  Has anybody tried this? How did it go? "
1560,Brewing with rainwater / tank water,"I'm lucky enough to have beautiful New Zealand rainwater to brew with. But, what are the considerations in terms of mineral content? Is rainwater close to distilled water?  Having gone through the same natural purification process of evaporation, is all rainwater more or less chemically the same? The air here (rural Auckland) is very clean so I'm guessing that acidification etc... from atmospheric particulates should be practically zero.  What mineral / chemical additions do people make when brewing with rainwater? "
1561,Off flavours from unsanitized priming sugar,"Quick question for the group: Will unsanitized priming tablets/sugar likely/surely cause off flavours after bottle conditioning - especially, a wet/slightly moldy towel aroma?  I've been experiencing this off aroma/flavour consistently after bottle conditioning - and it's NOT present out of the fermentor (tastes excellent initially). Fairly sure my AG process is decent, sanitary, and it's not a yeast or ferment temp problem.  Newbie question, but I've been using Cooper's dextrose tablets, and/or white sugar added directly to the bottles for priming. For my latest batch I boiled white sugar and primed in a bottling bucket as per traditional method - and I tasted a bottle after a week, and it was amazing - with no off flavours (yet;), and on par with what I would have expected out of the fermentor. I'm hoping this is the answer but wanted to ask for advice.   Does anyone have experience with this? And other than my so far anectodal experience, is it a no brainer that you must sanitize priming sugar - even those priming tablets?  Thanks a million for any and all help. "
1562,"How to choose the correct soda keg ""type"" replacement posts?","New to kegging, got myself a used ball lock Firestone/Pepsi soda keg. But when I've been cleaning and sanitizing the posts when I got it/after use, they seemed SUPER beat up. There is a washer (maybe? some sort of plastic nub) inside that is all cracked up, same with the o-rings, the gas dip tube is plastic and looks pretty beat up. And I haven't even looked at the poppets yet.  I'm considering just buying replacement post assemblies, but I've found three different ""types"":   Type A fits Firestone V, VI, Challenger and Super Challenger kegs Type B fits Cornelius Spartan, Super Champion and 'R' kegs Type C fits John Wood 85 and older Firestone Challenger kegs   Then there is this kit I found that seems to want to sell me the both posts without any concern to type.  The question ends up being, is there functional difference between replacing the post assemblies between types other than profile? Must I choose the right one or will any work?  And if I must choose the correct one, how do I determine my kegs model when it doesn't seem to be labeled where I purchased it. "
1563,Is it possible to know how many volumes of CO2 end up in a keg after force carbonating?,"There are two methods used to carbonate a keg:   Set and forget Force carbonation   In the first method, the keg's PSI is set to a value determined by a kegging chart and is left at that PSI for the duration of the beers life. Some time after 1-2 weeks, the beer is fully carbonated and the exact volumes of CO2 in the beer is known.  In the second method, the keg's PSI is set to around 30 and left there for 24-36 hours, before being brought down back to ""serving pressure"" which is typically the same value as set in the first method. Some people may purge the keg before dropping the PSI, and others may shake the keg.  I have heard that when we force carbonate, it is not possible to know the exact volumes of CO2 in the beer. Is this true? I would think that the beer would eventually equalize out to the PSI at the serving temperature. If this is not true - why isn't it? If I set the PSI to 30 for only 1 hour (instead of 48), does the same apply? How about 1 minute? "
1564,Aluminum mash tun?,"My current brewing set up is as follows: 2 Fermenter's Favorite 10 gallon all grain coolers hot liquor tank and mash tun, 15 gallon Megapot boil kettle, Edelmetal Bru Burner, and a homemade gravity stand. I usually brew 10 gallon batches with 12 to 13 gallons pre boil. My local hardware store has a killer deal on 15,20, and 25 gallon aluminum pots. I was thinking of picking up a couple to replace my coolers and outfit them with ball valves and thermometers etc. The main reason is because I currently can only do single infusion mash recipes. Any luck with aluminum anyone? Or should I stick with my coolers until I save my pennies for all stainless gear? "
1565,Does the amount of Diastatic Power of the grains influence the alcohol content of the beer?,If one grain bill has a combined amount diastatic power equal to 70 degrees Lintner and the other one 90 does this influence the amount of alcohol the end product will have?  I guess the potency of the yeast will also have an effect but I'm wondering if the amount of sugars in the wort will have an effect on the strength of the beer? 
1566,Advice on a recipe,I have the following grains available and was wondering what would be the general idea of doing my own recipe.   0.5kg Amber Malt 0.5kg Maris Otter 0.5kg Halcyon 1kg Pale Malt 1kg Caramel Dark 3kg Red-x 1kg Black Malt 1kg Brewing Sugars (dextrose)   I would like to do some sort of red tinted beer but I fear that I don't have enough of the Red-X grains. My fermenter can handle 20 liters. That is the amount of wort I'm aiming for.  Also is the brewing sugars necessary? What would one kg brewing sugars do to a 20 liter batch of wort? Is the sugars a good idea? 
1567,Using a hop back before bottling?,"I'm wondering about approaches for getting maximum hop aroma, and i got looking at the hop back - in particular the hop rocket or similar.  Having read about dry hopping etc, and the fact that it seems very hard to keep the aroma, how about pumping through the hop rocket, just before bottling?  So the beer would be fully fermented, the only downside I can see is that the beer is cold, so less likely to extract the hop oils, is that right?  In which case - Im sure I read somewhere that some pubs will serve beer through dried hops, for exactly this reason - to restore some of the aroma.  So if that works, then I figured it would also work just before bottling? "
1568,How can I determine why some all-grain wort is cloudy and if I should do anything about it?,"TL;DR How can I tell what this cloudiness in my wort is? will it cause off flavors? if so, how do I get rid of it? and most importantly, if this is a problem, how can I prevent this from happening next time?    Ran my first all-grain mash about a week ago, 5 Gallon Saison. I've heard to look out for cloudy wort and the many reasons it may be cloudy. I'm not too concerned with a cloudy brew as long as it tastes good.  Lautered until the wort was nice and clear, looked almost like a dark bourbon. Then sparged. Collected a little less than 7 gallons. At this point the wort looked as clear I would expect an extract wort to be.  After the boil, cooled and transferred to the primary and you can hardly see through it, it's SO cloudy. Just a solid opaque haze in the primary.  I normally use a whirlfloc tablet, but in the hustle a my first all-grain I  forgot to add it. I wonder if it would have dropped a lot of this out?  I read the cloud could be grain flour, I didn't crush my own, I bought it precrushed, but read that it SHOULD have settled out by the first week? Also wouldn't this cloud be in the wort prior to boiling?  Also read it could be tannins with proteins, a haze that doesn't go away and may cause off flavors.  The only clarifying agent I have is Biofine Clear, I intend to use this 2 days prior to kegging since it drops the yeast out and keeps my kegs and lines a little cleaner. Will this be enough? Will waiting this long cause problems?    EDIT, recipe for reference:  Malt: 10 lbs. Belgian Pale malt 0.75 lbs Briess Caramel 20  Yeast: Wyeast 3724 Belgian Saison Yeast.  Hop Additions: 2.5 oz Hersbrucker @60 min 0.5 oz Hersbrucker @10 min "
1569,How does alcohol affect flavour/aroma when dry hopping?,"As a chemist, I know that extraction (from hops in this case) can be different for water (hop tea), beer (eg. 7% ABV), or pure ethanol. So in theory it should make a big difference if I dry hop with hop tea, simply by adding hops to beer, or by preparing a hop-extract in mixtures with different water/ethanol ratio.  Does anyone here have experience with this? What are the effects on flavour and aroma? "
1570,What is a good time frame for aging cider/apple wine?,"   I am planning on tasting my cider in the fall (6 months from pitching   yeast) and seeing how the flavor is then. How much would the flavors   improve aging for a year? 2 year? 5? 10? At what point would I see   diminishing returns?   Context  My second (ever) batch of cider is currently entering secondary fermentation, and has left me wondering how long I should age my Cider.  The first batch of cider I made was done ""hastily"" and I consumed it within a few weeks of bottle conditioning. The flavor tasted like biting into a green apple and was very dry since I didn't back-sweeten it. Based on the common knowledge available this appears to be characteristic of ""young cider"", whose flavors I would like to try mellowing out by aging.  I found that a period of 3-6 months is the typical recommendation for aging cider. I've also read forums on home-brewing sites that higher ABV ciders benefit more from a longer aging period. The initial hydrometer reading of my cider tells me that I can ferment up to just under 10% ABV if I ferment the cider dry (which my yeast seems to do). This is a bit higher than the typical cider abv.  As a side note about long aging times I'm not really concerned about the cider becoming vinegar (see cider notes*), so I don't think that is a factor for me. Obviously I don't really plan on aging my cider for super long periods of time (longer than 20 years), which I think would be excessive.  Cider notes (FYI):   Small 1 Gallon batch Lallemand Belle Saison yeast Simply apple juice Additive: white refined sugar bringing abv from 6.6% abv -> 10% abv Additive: Pectinase (Pectin Enzyme) for clarifying juice Aiming for bottling at secondary fermentation (based on the currently clarity of the brew (golden-translucent) in primary fermentation, I do not believe I will need tertiary fermentation) Xylitol backsweeting, aiming for 24 grams per 12 fl oz. 1/4 cup Dextrose for back carbonation (4.1 Vol of Co2 according to this calculator @ 70 degrees F)  "
1571,Adding minerals back into reverse osmosis water?,"Everyone knows that reverse osmosis filter strips out the minerals from water, but no one on Google is telling the way to adding them back into the water.  I have been drinking reverse osmosis water from a year and its tds rate is also 25 which is pretty good, but it is not hydrating me and I've seen many research on Google about stripped minerals.  Can anyone tell me:   what should be put in water and how? Is there any mineral based powder or something?   "
1572,Save the (Belgian) wit! I forgot the candi syrup: what should I do now?,"Cleaning up after brewing my first extract-based Belgian wit, with wort already cooled and in the carboy, and yeast pitched ... I discovered to my horror i'd forgotten to add the candi syrup to the boil!  The recipe called for 1 lb golden candi syrup for a 5 gallon batch, added near the end. I've got plenty of airspace in my 6 gallon carboy, and the package is sealed. OG is 1.056 (BrewTarget suggests it should have been up around 1.068).   Can i just pitch the candi syrup in? do i need to boil it with some water to sanitize it first?   EDIT: Thanks all for the suggestions! I wanted to be extra careful, so I:   brought 4 c of water to a boil added 5 oz Pilsen DME (proportional to the original recipe) and boiled for 5 minutes turned off the heat, stirred in the candi syrup, and threw in a couple of Fuggles pellets for good measure put it all in an ice bath to bring the temp down quickly to ~70 degrees poured it into my carboy through my racking tube to avoid splashing, and stirred it up a bit.   It was already perking along well, so I expect there won't be any problems (but i'll report back if anything unusual results).   Results: perked along well for quite a long time. I sampled gravity today (after 3 weeks in primary) at 1.016, which is relatively close to the target FG. Taste seems fine (pre-carbonation). So i'm calling this experiment a success. Time to bottle! "
1573,"Which yeast/bacteria produce no, or little alcohol (like Bionade)?","Producing a variety of different beer styles, we are able make adult friends happy, however children are left out :(  I therefore wanted to ask if somebody knows where to look for yeasts that are not producing alcohol, yet ferment a wort?  On Wikipedia one can read about this commercial product Bionade (wikipedia), which suggest that some person at a brewery (after claimed years of experimenting) was able to cultivate a mico-organism (not really a yeast but a bacteria) that instead of generating alcohol, generates gluconic acid.     He experimented for eight years in a bathroom laboratory, spending   €1.5 million of the brewery owner Peter Kowalsky's money. He isolated   a strain of bacteria capable of converting the sugar that normally   becomes alcohol into nonalcoholic gluconic acid, which he used to   ferment the new drink.[3]   Is there maybe an non-proprietary, open source version of this bacteria? "
1574,Which dry malt extract for which type of beer?,"I want to make a batch of Cincinnati Pale Ale with the recipe describes in the How to brew of John Palmer book. To do it, I need Pale Ale DME. The problem is my homebrew shop only indicates the EBC value of the malt extract and not directly the type of beer.  According to this website, an American Pale Ale have an EBC between 10 and 25. Does it mean I should take a DME with an EBC between those values?  I found, on the website of another shop, a pale ale malt extract with 6°L (14.5 EBC). If my shop doesn't sell 14.5 EBC dry malt extract, should I mix two different DME to get this EBC?  In general, how can we choose the correct DME according to the type of beer we want to make? "
1575,Fermentation still stuck after adding nutrients?,"I'm brewing an imperial wit beer and it seems i have a problem with my wort beeing stuck in fermentation at 1.040.  My wort is wheat extract 3.4kg and 1kg candi sugar, steeped with some oat flakes, mesured OG is 1.074. My yeast is belgian wit II (WLP410). I've made a 1.5L starter, my pitch rate is supposed to be around 0.90, my fermentation temp is 20.5°C  I'm using a Tilt hydrometer to real time check my gravity, i noticed it was stuck after 2 days, (begin of fermentation was very quick and efficient).  I took immediate action by stiring my wort and adding some boiled dead bakers yeast (as nutrient) but today is seems fermentation is not really restarting ? (see graph)  What should be my next action ? Make a new starter of WLP410 and repitch ? wait ?    Thanks :)  Cheers, "
1576,How important is temperature in secondary?,"Say I'll want to brew an imperial stout, let it ferment in primary and then rack it to secondary. How important is the temperature in secondary? I have a temperature controlled fridge to hold the fermentation temperature in primary. I need to make space in the fridge and can't have it there for 3 more months. I have the option to put it into a cooling house (like 5 degrees celsius) or into the quiet warm cellar. Is this an issue?  "
1577,Turbo Yeast for making wheat beer,I am a newbie for homebrew wheat beer making. I used the alcotec turbo yeast 24 express(distiller yeast) for the fermentation. But After 20 hours brew is stopping fermentation. Can I keep it for the two weeks? Is it hygienic for the drink? Do I need more yeast for completing the fermentation? 
1578,Secondary fermentation temperature after priming for lager,I am trying my first batch of lager with Munich malted barley cascade hops. I pitched the lager yeast at a relatively high temp around 25°C. I had oxigenated my wort as it cooled in the boil kettle with pure CO2. I left 40L fermenter in room temp 22°C overnight to let the fermentation start. I had very strong bubbling the next morning. At that point I placed my fermenter in a refrigerator and set temp at 12°C. After a week my bubbling seemed to end in the air lock. I lowered the temp to 5°C and let it rest for another week. My FG was 1.012 and 1.020 after priming.   I bottled and placed in fridge again about 17°C.   My question is: what temp should I keep for getting good CO2 after bottling? Should I have kept it in room temp about 22°C for a day or so before cooling? Beer tasted not too bad but little CO2 before I bottled.  Thanks for all potential answers. 
1579,Correct temperature effect on Specific gravity,"Is there an equation that corrects specific gravity while considering temperature effect in Celsius, which does not presupposes a set hydrometer calibration temperature?  A direct relation, not tables or something static. And if there is one, where would you find it?  A similar question was asked Here, but the answers are all in Fahrenheit or assume a 15 C (59 f) calibration temperature. "
1580,Brewing a 25l batch in a smaller fermenter,Can you brew say 7kg of sugar in say a 10l fermenter as opposed to a more standard 25l fermenter. I mean technically the sugar will still ferment in the smaller vessel or is that not the case will the yeast be overcome by the high sugar to low water ratio?  In other words I have I think a 10l-15l fermenter and want to brew up to 7kg of sugar mash on it. Will all the sugar ferment?  
1581,ABV from one SG?,The most common way to calculate ABV (Alcohol By Volume) is through some correlation between Original Gravity (OG) and Final Gravity(FG).  Is there any way to calculate ABV just from the current specific gravity reading?  Example - a week into fermentation you can read an sg of 1.038. Is it possible to deduce the current ABV from this using just a hydrometer and as much fancy math as you can imagine? 
1582,Sugar in water effect on specific gravity?,"Is there an equation or relation to describe how much sugar is to be added to water to obtain a liquid with a specific gravity?  In This question, for example, it is mentioned that ""1 lb in 1 gallon is 1.046"" - but is there a known scale? Or is extrapolating from this the only way?  Bonus points for metric units, double points for referenced answer! "
1583,Should I boil apples before using them in a mash?,I'm thinking about bacterial/wild yeast contamination etc.... Or will just washing them under the tap be suffice?  Also can I use the cores?  
1584,Adding extra ingredients/flavouring: what stage should I add?,"I am stil fairly new to homebrewing; on my third batch of real ale now, and I wanted to experiment with adding a few extra things to my brew: some elderflowers, and miscellaneous herbs.  My idea was to boil a small handful of these leaves up in a pan, strain it, and pour it in.  However, I would like some opinion on when the best time in the process would be to throw this stuff in? My guess is that I should wait until it hits the pressure barrel, since I don't want to add any extra sugars etc that could upset the fermentation process.  Or should I simply wait until it's ready to pour before adding anything extra, at the very last minute? "
1585,Brewing ale: should fermentation be kicked off at a higher temperature?,"I am still fairly new to homebrewing, and am on my second batch using this kit. The instructions given in the kit I don't think are particularly clear. It states that I should add 3.5 litres of boiling water and top up with cold water (up to 23 litres). It then states that it should be kept between 18 and 20 degrees.  However, what temperature is ""cold water""? I live in Scotland. The first batch I did was in the winter; tap water is so cold it actually hurts your hand. Compare that with a warm region and you could be talking about a difference of 15 or 20 degrees C. Nonetheless, following these intructions I end up with the brew way up at almost 30 deg C.  What I am wondering is whether these kits are supposed to be kicked off at a higher temperature and then left to settle down to the ideal 18-20 zone?  It would far clearer if they replaced their nonsense about ratios of hot vs ""cold"" water, and simply told you what temperature to aim for!  So my question is: is the brew supposed to start at a higher temperaure? (to kick start the yeast..?) and if so, what sort of temperature should I aim for, ideally?  Thanks "
1586,Can saison yeast use lactose?,"As title states, the question is can Saison yeast use lactose?   i.e. is it possible to sweeten a Saison with lactose? Or, sweeten it possibly some other way?   This is about Saison yeasts, dry or liquid.  "
1587,How do old homebrews taste like?,"I often come across guides on detecting off-flavors. But I never seen a guide on how to how to identify flavor caused by poorly aged beer, though I’ve come across plenty of home brews past it’s prime. Is there a general rule on flavors appearing late? Certain off-flavors to be on the lookout for? It’s definately the case that home brews in most cases age worse than pasteurized store-bought beer, in my experience (especially for low gravity beers). "
1588,Is aeration necessary if you overpitch?,"We all know that aeration is necessary for yeast growth.  Does it facilitate more than that?  If you massively overpitch, on a previous yeast-cake for example, do you need the same amount of dissolved O2 as a ""normal"" pitch?  Many pro brewers rack a new batch onto the previous batch's yeast cake. Are they on to something? "
1589,First All Grain Batch / LOW Efficiency,"Yesterday I went down to my homebrew retailer, planning on buying a simple screen/valve assembly for a cooler. No go. He didn't have any of THOSE left, however he did have an assembly to use an 8-gallon pot as a lauter tun. So I stopped by the hardware store, purchased a step drill, modified the pot for a valve, screen filter, and thermometer (also a purchase @ the HB store), but not before I had walked out of the homebrew store with the ingredients for a Belgian Dubbel and an extra fermentor:  1 lb Briess American Dextrin (carapils malt) 7.5 lbs Muntons English Maris Otter Malt 0.1 lbs Weyermann German Dehusked CaraFa II 0.5 lbs Dingemans Belgian Aromatic Malt 1 lb Dingemans Beglian Special B 1 lb candi sugar 1 lb honey (he had this AWESOME stuff called ""Meadowfoam"", which is truly delicious, to the point where I may make some meade from it) 1oz Brewers Gold pellets (60 min) 1/2 oz Hallertau (20 min) 1/4 oz Hallertau (10 min) Wyeast #1214 Belgian Abbey Yeast  I came out with a 1.030 boil gravity. Adjusted for temperature, this was closer to 1.045.  After adding the candi sugar and honey along with all the other elements in the boil, I was down to about 4 gallons due to some trub and some substantial boil-off.  @ the suggestion of my HB retailer's instructions, I added a gallon of water.   My OG was then 1.052.  Was diluting a bad idea?  How can I allow for boil-off?   "
1590,Calculating Mash Water Volume When Brewing with Pumpkin,"Okay, so pumpkins are not in season and I'm substituting winter squash (acorn/butternut) for my pumpkin ale recipe, but the concept remains the same as if it were pumpkin.  I've never brewed with pumpkin (or any other fruits/vegetables for that matter), so I have some questions.  The grain bill is 13.75 lbs.  If I weren't using pumpkin I would use 1.25 quarts of mash water per pound of grain, equaling 4.3 gallons.  My questions is, if I'm adding about 8 pounds of pumpkin, do I need to increase my mash volume to account for that, and if so, by how much?  Since the pumpkin will be saturated with water, I know I don't need to account for absorption in the same way that I do with the grains, but is the water displaced by the pumpkin enough to keep the grains fully submerged?  Do I need more sparge water? "
1591,How do I use this Digital Temperature Controller?,"For my birthday, I asked my sister for a Digital Temperature Controller. Rather than buy the one from Norther Brewer, I found what I thought was a better deal from Pex Supplies. However, it looks like the one I got isn't exactly the same.  What I thought I was getting was the ability to plug a freezer into the controller, and the controller into an outlet. However, the one I got is quite confusing. Maybe it is that, just more work on my end? Is it easy to attach a power cord to this? Electrician noob I am.  Anyway, here are some pictures of the one I got. The description of the one I got can be seen here.      "

If you're boiling 6 gallons on an electric stove or trying to do the same thing on a propane burner, the level of your boil is different. What effects will this have on the final product? "
1594,Basic information on priming,"I'd appreciate a little input on ""Priming"": How do you do it? Which sugars do you use? Do you use it for all your beers and if not for which ones? "
1595,Pro Mash Tun design,"I was wondering if anyone had a link to a graphic of what the typical profesional mash tun is like.  Specifically I was wondering if the majority of professional scaled mash tuns draw from underneath the tun below the false bottom, or do they draw up and out the side, like many (most) homebrew setups?  Also how do pro mash tuns get heated?  Steam jackets for step mashes I assume.  Cheers "
1596,Temperature conditions for saving cropped yeast?,What is an ideal environment for saving yeast I have harvested from my fermentation vessels? The lowest survivable temperature? Highest?  I recently found the top of my fridge to be too cold when I couldn't revive yeast that had probably neared freezing. 
1597,How big do the holes need to be in a Zapap style Mash/Lauter Tun?,"I'm looking to make one of the mash tuns out of a plastic bucket.  I find instructions like ""drill a bazillion holes into the bottom with a small drill bit"".  How small?  Is there a size that's too small and likely to get clogged? "
1598,What gravity is suitable for not using priming sugar?,"Assuming full attenuation, is there a way to figure out what gravity reading would be suitable to not use priming sugar, and just allow the excess sugar to create the carbonation? A sub-question would be how much gravity some the 3/4 cup priming sugar add?  Example  The OG on my blonde was 1.052. I used California Ale Yeast (WLP001), which has an attenuation of 73-80%. Therefore, the potential TG is between 1.014 and 1.010.  If I bottle at, say, 1.016, will that be enough to carbonate the beer without adding sugar? 1.020? "
1599,Brass vs. Stainless Steel for fittings,I see both brass and stainless fittings for sale. Which is appropriate to use when?

1601,What is a grant?,How is it used? What does it do? 
1602,Light control during brewing process,"From what point in the brewing process do you need to be concerned about light skunking the beer? Only after the fermentation has started? Or right from the start?  From doing a bit of research on the net, it seems even a short period of light can cause the beer to skunk, but obviously you need some light for seeing what you are doing during the brewing and bottling process. I try not to do any of this during the day (so I'm only using artificial lights), but the exposure for this short a period even something I should be concerned about?  Also, as I'm brewing this in a garage with windows, I've ended up putting a large wooden barrel over top of my brewing container to block out the light completely during the fermentation process. Is this a reasonable approach? "
1603,[Wiki] Tips for recipe scaling,"What are some best practices for scaling a 5 gallon homebrew batch up to something bigger, be it a 10-15 gallon batch, or a full on multiple barrel commercial batch?  Efficiency goes up on some bigger systems, and not everything scales in a linear 1:1 fashion, such as hops.  What are some things to keep in mind, equations, etc?  This is a community wiki. Anyone can edit the question and all answers, and no one receives reputation. "
1604,Is trapped air in a counterflow chiller really an aeration risk?,"I recently bought a Blichmann Therminator counterflow chiller (I know, extravagant, but it is the awesome).  The instructions say to operate it with the hot wort input facing down, so that gravity causes the wort chamber to fill correctly.  They say that if you get a bubble in the wort, it will oxidize your beer.  Really? One bubble? I don't worry much at all about hot-side aeration when moving hot wort around. Why should I worry about a bubble? "
1605,What's a good first equipment buy after a basic starter kit?,"I bought the First-Time Brewer's Starter Kit from Midwest Supply and enjoyed the process quite a bit. While the kit has the essentials for extract brewing, I know there are lots of things I can get to make the process (and product) better. Since I'm not independently wealthy, though, I need to pick just one or two pieces of equipment now and build up my arsenal slowly. What are some of the best next equipment purchases that will give me the most improvement in my brewing? A few of the items I'm considering are:   Glass carboy for 2-stage fermentation (the kit only came with a plastic fermenter and a bottling bucket) Wort chiller - because I'd hate to lose a batch to infection if I can help it Auto-siphon - just seems like a good idea overall   And a few other cheap miscellaneous things that I'll probably get right away anyway (funnel with strainer, nicer thermometer, nylon boiling bag so I don't have to use that sock thing they send with the kit). Any other suggestions or reasons I should/shouldn't get any of the above items right away?  Thanks! "
1606,Is a late addition of sugar into wine a month after primary ended detrimental?,"I'm currently brewing an apple wine. I started it at 1.080, and when that was finished I added another 1.020. Now it has been sitting on it's yeast cake for about one month, and I'm considering if I should add another addition (to max out the yeast and allow for some sweetening) or not.  Is it detrimental to add more sugar now? As in, will the fermentation be weak and stressed? Should I siphon the wine off the cake and add it without the yeast cake? Should I just not mix it after addition, so as not to bring the trub into suspension? "
1607,Effects on homebrew from Fluoride in tap water,"I live in a city that puts fluoride in the drinking water.  I am in the habit of boiling all water before storing it (and allowing it to cool) for brew day.   Will fluoride effect the brew in any way?  Will boiling the water before using mitigate this effect? If not, is there any known way to mitigate this? "
1608,My mead is too sweet and stopped bubbling. Recommendations?,"I brewed a mead with OG ~1.12 and it stopped bubbling at an FG ~1.05.  It is undrinkably sweet.  I used champagne yeast, and was expecting a much lower FG.  Should I re-inoculate the batch?  Alternatively, what does overly sweet mead mix well with? "
1609,How do you blend your meads/wines?,How does one typically blend their meads &amp; wines?  Do I need to worry about layering because of different S.G. levels or ABV levels? 
1610,What exactly should I measure while brewing?,"I want the answers to be geared towards meads/wines if possible.  There seems to be so many things to measure.  Which are the ones that really matter?  I've started spending a lot of time taking all these measurements.  If all are important, how often do I need to take each one?  Measurements that I see as important   S.G.  - Specific Gravity pH TA - total acid Free s02  "
1611,What are the effects of transferring a mash before lautering?,"In my latest batch I ended up with a stuck mash due to me mis-assembling the false bottom. To solve this, I transferred the mash to a bucket, fixed the false bottom, put the mash back in the MLT and lautered as normal.  Before transferring the mash, the wort was clear. After transferring the mash, the wort was very cloudy.  This cloudiness carried over into the boil and I ended up with the most trub-filled batch I've ever made. Normally I'll get 2-3 quarts of trub in a 6 gallon batch. In this batch I got almost 6 quarts.  Did transferring the wort cause this excessive trub? If so, how? And how could I avoid this problem in the future. (other than always assembling the false bottom correctly, obviously)  Update:   Yes, there really are two problems here: a super-cloudy wort and a trub-filled wort. They might not be related. The grist was 40% American 2-row, which is not an ingredient I normally use. Based on the massive kreusen I'm seeing in the fermenter, I'm guessing that the 2-row contributed a lot of protein to this beer.  So the 2-row probably contributed to the excessive trub in the beer as well. "
1612,Will beer keep in a cask if used gradually?,"I've read that beer should keep in a cask for months, but does that only apply if left full? How long do I have to finish once I start drinking from it? "
1613,What can I do to ensure my high OG wort ferments well?,"An Belgian Tripel recipe has caught my eye, but it looks like an imperial style.  OG is estimated at 1.100+, and final abv is close to 11.5%.  I'm planning on a Wyeast Belgian Ardennes yeast.  My plan is to split the brew-day into at least two days; starting with a lesser volume medium-gravity wort to pitch the yeast into, then adding the sum of the wort and fermentables at high krausen, after the yeast have really taken hold.  Is this approach the best way to ensure healthy fermentation in this high gravity wort?    What alternatives are out there--and their pros/cons?  What other aspects should I be concerned with? "
1614,Is rapid wort chilling always needed?,"There seems to be a fair amount you can get away without doing when using extract in brewing, since the extract has already gone through most of the process before being packaged (e.g. no need to boil off DMS).  Yet in Palmer's book, he still does the rapid wort cooling process in the extract section.  Is it always needed?  Can it be skipped in any circumstances?  If so, what? (e.g. using extract + steeped grains, extract only, pale malts)  In my case, I usually partially boil extract (+ specialty grains) and have had no problems just pouring the boiling wort into my bucket and chilling by topping up with cooler water.  Have I just been lucky or is this OK? "
1615,How precise must the measure of priming sugar be?,"I usually bottle home brew into 750ml bottles, and less commonly into 375ml bottles. I have a two-ended sugar spoon which is for priming these, and it's obvious which spoon head goes with which bottle (full spoon, half spoon).   I have collected a number of 500ml bottles and I wonder if I need to get the in-between proportion right for the priming sugar, or can I just pick one or the other safely? Should I use the half spoon for a 500ml since it's closer to 375ml than 750ml, or the full spoon? Should I get more spoons?  Does it matter?  "
1616,What are the best practices for using a wine degasser to aerate wort for beer?,"I have a wine degasser, which is a bit like an egg-beater for a power drill.  It aerates wort extremely well but I don't have a good rule of thumb for how to tell when enough is enough.  Should I:   Favor a high-rpm, relatively violent ""whipping"" of the air into the wort--or should I less violent vortex at a lower speed? How long should I aerate for? Are there any good/bad signs I should keep an eye out for?  "
1617,How many ounces of beer are in the typical 12oz bottle?,"Assuming that a ""12 oz bottle"" means that the bottle filled to the brim holds 12 ounces then how many ounces do most breweries put in a bottle?  Does the difference between the bottle size and actual amount stay constant, regardless of bottle-size (e.g. assuming a 12 oz bottle has 11 oz of content, would a 22 oz bottle have 21 oz), or is it a ratio?    Or: if a beer bottle holds twelve ounces in a normal fill, then what is the actual capacity of the bottle? "
1618,HERMS or RIMS - How to choose?,"I'm confused. What are the major pros/cons between HERMS and RIMS brewing systems? I've read about both, but can't seem to come to a conclusion on why one would choose one over the other. Is it the amount of fine-grained control the brewer has over the process, simplicity, equipment or quality of the beer? Like most things, I'm guessing that it's a matter of tradeoffs, but as someone who is thinking about going all-grain, I'd like to understand the tradeoffs better before I make a decision to invest in any equipment or implement a new process. "
1619,Rinsing specialty grain bag after steeping,"Is there any reason to rinse the bag of specialty grains after steeping? I did this yesterday on a whim, thinking I would be able to extract as much of the sugars as possible. I used about 1qt. of hot'ish water directly into the brewpot and it seemed to work fine. At this point, I'm questioning my method since the water was not 170 degrees like the rest of the wort in the brewpot, but I guess it's a learning process.  So, should I take the time to rinse the specialty grains in the future? If so, should the water be the same temperature of the wort to be effective? "
1620,"Can a Johnson A419 control both a heater and cooler, or is a single-mode?","I just recieved a Johnson A419 digital temperature controller, but I think I was mistaken in my expectations.  I was under the impression I could plug both a heater and cooler into the controller; however it has just a single plug leading me to assume it can only heat or cool, but not both.  Is this correct?  If so what comparable controllers would support both heating and cooling?  Also, what is the correct term for each type of controller (single/dual-mode?)? "
1621,Should I upgrade my thermometer or just re-calibrate it?,"I'm asking this because I recently made the switch to all grain brewing, and I'd like to make sure I'm as accurate as possible for mash temps.  I have a plain dial thermometer that I used for some extract brews (bought for ~$10 at my LHBS), but I'm not sure that I trust it. When I bought it, I calibrated it to 32F an ice water bath (lots of ice, just enough water to cover). Just for fun, I tried it in boiling water and it said that the water was only at 206 F after being immersed for 30 seconds in the boil (I am &lt;1000 ft above sea level, so it should still be at 212 F), but still says I'm at 32 in an ice water bath.  Should I try to find a nicer thermometer or just re-calibrate the one I have to the boiling water? If I should upgrade, do you have any recommendations?  Edit: I should also add that I don't really have the funds to spend on a Thermapen. "
1622,How can tobacco be used in beer?,"I've had a couple of tasty rauchbiers lately, and got thinking about whether it would be possible to get the aroma of a cigar into a similar beer.  As a user, I don't mind getting nicotine into the brew, but I'm sure my guests would rather not. Much like a rauchbier, I think the magic comes from the aroma.  How can I ""smoke"" my beer? Can I drop raw tobacco leaves into secondary? Throw a can of snus in? Smoke malt over a case of cubans? "
1623,How to add temperature measurement and control to my Brooklyn Brew Shop beer kit?,"My wife got me this beer making kit for my birthday. The first two brews failed horribly due to bad sanitation, but the third one, an American Pale Ale, turned out alright. The only thing I didn't like about it, was that it very heavy, not unlike certain Belgian, quadruple beer.  I'm not too sure what caused it, but my guess is the fact that we've had a few very hot days while it was fermenting. It's either that, I misunderstood this page completely.  Anyway, as you can see, the kit contains a 1 gallon glass fermenter and I would like to find a way to constantly measure the temperature of my wort as it's fermenting.  How would I measure that inside that glass fermenter? What kind of temperature sensor should I use?   In the future, I want to hook up said sensor to a small computer (Raspberry Pi, Arduino, etc.) so I can perform actual temperature control based on the temperature, but I'm having a hard time finding a method that doesn't involve making holes in the fermenter and simply sticking the sensor in through that and just using epoxy to close the hole and making it air tight.  I guess my question is: what's the best method to accurately measure the temperature of the wort inside my 1 gallon glass fermenter? Are there any wireless, waterproof temperature sensors out there that I can simply sanitize and toss in the fermenter or is that too simplistic?  Thanks for your help! "
1624,Can I rack to and clear my wine in a lidded plastic bucket without a stopper?,"I'm making a Chardonnay wine kit for the first time ever, so bear with me here.  The instructions say to rack the wine from the primary fermenter (which they suggested be a food safe HDPE plastic bucket with a loose fitting lid) into clear glass carboys (with stoppers atop them) after 10 days of primary fermentation.  I'm just curious what the need for glass carboys is for the secondary fermentation/clearing of the wine? Does the secondary fermenter need to be absolutely air-tight as they suggest?  Does it have to do with infection of the wine? Is an open fermentation method not suitable once the wine stops producing a lot of CO2 on it's own? Or are the glass carboys recommended for visually determining the clarity of the wine and thus when you want to bottle?  tl;dr My question is basically ""Can I use a lidded plastic bucket for my secondary fermentation/clearing process? Or are glass carboys a necessity for the secondary?"" "
1625,What do I risk for leaving my beer exposed to open air through the airlock hole?,"I brew away from home, and last weekend I has to rush away before I was completely racking from primary to secondary. I can only go back in about 10 days. As a result, my beer is now sitting in a bucket with the lid on but with no airlock (exposed to open air through the airlock's hole). It's a pale blond ale with pitched with S-04 yeast about 3 weeks ago. Besides contamination risk, what do I risk ? Oxidation ? Anything else ? Thanks in advance, Arthur "
1626,High gravity ale stalled fermentation?,"I've got a hefty grain bill of 10kg, half of which is Maris Otter. The rest is rye and a few assorted crystal malts.  After the mash and boil, the OG was above 1.10. I pitched a Wyeast American ale at the start, then pitched Wyeast English ale 24 hours later. The fermenter was bubbling like an crazy for about 5 days, then just went dead. The average temperature is about 22°c, and I have agitated the hell out of it several times since the yeast first seemed suss.  Any ideas? I've given the fermenter another wake up call with no luck. What should I do? "
1627,Not enough wort after boil,"I did a 5 litre brew yesterday, a California Common Beer, I did it as per the recipe, with the steep time and the 60 min boil, and I ended up with 2.5 litres of wort from a starting liquid of 7.37 litres, a 75 min steep and a 10 min sparge with flame on and then a 60 min boil. I topped it up with fresh water to 4 litres, probably a fail....What can I do to avoid this over evaporation in the future??? Marty.. "
1628,Questions on keeping a yeast strain going over and over,"I have a couple of yeast questions that I have not found the answer to yet.   I recently washed my yeast from a batch of beer using something like this. I got 5 jars of yeast out of this, and I assume I can brew 5 batches of beer from these. So what exactly is 4 - 6 generations? Because If I take the yeast from another batch of beer, I can get another 5 jars again. Are all of those considered generation 2? I was looking into yeast culturing from here, Is this what commercial breweries would do? Could I just buy a microscope and learn how to do a yeast viability test on my own? Or do I need a microbiology degree for that? Whats the ideal temperature to keep the yeast? I have them in the refrigerator, but I am not sure if that temperature is correct or not. Will the yeast die if its to cold?  "
1629,"Cider brewing, can I add pectolaze after fermentation started?","I'm making apple cider for the first time. I was careful about sanitizing, pasteurising, and adding campden, and I now have what seems to be nice fermentation in an airlocked demijohn.  I did not have pectolaze initially but now I got some.  Is it safe to add pectolaze at this point, or any time later, to reduce haziness? Would it have any effect on taste? "

1631,Why shouldn't we just use scales?,"New on homebrew.SE, great forum here. Just a quick question - why shouldn't we just use weight scales to determine the OG and FG? My Hydrometer has broken and I can't be stuffed really buying a new one - assuming the accuracy of the scales is very good, why shouldn't I just use that to determine the density (and therefore the SG)? "
1632,Use pop-corn as an adjunct,"I love pop-corn (who doesn't I guess), so I think it might be used in beer during mash.  Has anyone used them? How did it work? How should I do it? Should I expect something interesting from it? "
1633,How foolish is it to try to make up for my tripel's shortish secondary by bottle conditioning it longer?,"I'm attempting to brew a wide variety of beers (both 2.5 &amp; 5 gallon batches depending on style) in a shortish time span in order to serve at a family reunion in the summer, and now it looks like I may have fallen victim to my own poor planning.  In order to keep up the brew schedule I had planned for this spring, I need to either free up my one and only 3G carboy, or convert the recipes that were slated to be 2.5G back to 5 so I can use my larger fermentors.  I'd like to keep the 2.5G batches as they were planned, but I suddenly realized that I need long enough secondary time to clear up the tripel that's in there now, or racking over was a waste of time.  I know I can age in bottles for the purpose of flavor profile, but is there any way to estimate how long is 'just long enough' to make a noticeable difference in clarity?  For the last year or so we've been simply using common sense to check this kind of stuff (not clear yet? sample and move on), but if it's going to impact my brewing schedule, then I need to make alternate plans (probably just buying another 3G carboy).  /ramble "
1634,How long does bottle priming take? (Ginger Beer),I've test bottled one 500ml bottle of Ginger Beer with one Coopers priming drop. How long does priming take? If I opened it in a day would it have some pressure/fizz/gas or does it need a week or so? I want to ascertain if one drop was enough as I don't trust the terrible instructions' rough 'heaped teaspoon' amount; seems far too inexact to me! 
1635,How can I fix low starting gravity?,"I made my third all-grain batch last weekend. I have had issues getting decent efficiency so I added a couple extra pounds of ESB malted barley (11lbs, instead of 9, and about 3lbs of specialty grain).  My mash was 154F (167 strike, 17 quarts), and I let it sit for an hour before draining. I batch sparged with 185F water (was 170F, 18 quarts), and let it sit for 20 minutes before draining into my pot. I use a cooler, and there was very little movement on the temp.  But the wort that came out of the mash tun was about 1.025 on the hydrometer. I got about 7.5 gallons out, and it boiled down to be about 5 gallons, so I am guessing it was about 1.037 post-boil (I didn't take a reading). The recipe called for a 1.053  The airlock started bubbling about 36 hours later, but it slowed down quickly. I am guessing there wasn't enough sugar from my extraction to keep it going.  So.... what are my choices? It's been in the primary for about 5 days now.  I was thinking I could do what I do for a saison, and boil up some amber rock-candy sugar, but how much? I also have some amber DME, but that seems a bit riskier.  Of course, my beer-in-a-bag landed at 1.090, so I must have done something right there.  Suggestions welcome. Let me know if I haven't provided all the needed information.  David. "

1640,"Airlock: vodka, water, or","I've just started making my first brew, and am using vodka in the airlock, but am hoping for some more detailed info about what is best practice, or if there is not really any difference between using water, vodka, or other things I haven't thought or heard of... Also, does the quality of the vodka count? (As in, cheap vodka has a, er, particular taste - if that ends up in the fermenter, how much will it affect the brew taste?) "
1641,Wyeast 2124 Bohemian Lager for Bock - too late for diacetyl rest?,"I really wasn't ready to do a lager, but I wanted to do a Bock, so I requested California Lager yeast.  My supplier failed to make the substitution and sent me home with Wyeast 2124 Bohemian Lager.  I was snowed in and the temperature in my garage would be around 40°-50° for a couple weeks, so I decided to roll with it.  After two weeks of fermentation at 42-48°F, it started getting warmer (~52°F).  After about 2 days at that temp I decided to take a gravity reading, and found that I was sitting at 1.015.  I tasted it and it wasn't too bad, but there was a hint of diacetyl (totally drinkable in my mind).  I gave a sample to my wife and asked her to describe the taste...  Wife: ""Tastes like a hamburger"" Me: ""A hamburger?"" Wife: ""Yeah, like a Sonic hamburger."" Me: ""Like, buttery?"" Wife: ""Yeah, like a buttery hamburger.""  I saw here that it said this yeast benefits ""from diacetyl rest at 58°F (14°C) for 24 hours after fermentation is complete"".  Great, I thought, my fermentation is complete, so I'll bring it up to 58 and let it sit for a day and see if that helps.  It's been about 12 hours, but I'm a little nervous that the warmer temp will make the problem worse, and I've been reading that I should've done a d-rest much sooner.  What should I do in this scenario?  Wait another 12 hours and bottle?  12 hours then lager in the fridge? Bottle then condition in the fridge?  Cool the fermenter back down?  I've also looked at krausening, but that seems like a lot of effort on what may be a tight timeline. Any thoughts on that? "
1642,Convert US to metric gravity points,"How can I convert US gravity points? If, for example, a pound per gallon of sugar gives 46 gravity points (1.046 OG), how can I calcualate the corresponding value when 1kg of sugar is added to 10l of whater? "
1643,How long after bottling will the effects of oxygenation become apparent?,"I think it is well understood in the brewing community that oxygen absorbing caps exist and are readily available.  I don't keep any on-hand since my brews tend to be consumed rather quickly and are rarely in the ABV range best suited for aging.  After what length of time in the bottle do the effects of oxygenation become apparent?  Does this differ based on factors such as IBU, ABV, and storage temperature? "
1644,tap line resistor,"I just got my coffin style keezer all set up. I did the calculations to get a ""balanced"" system at a normal 12 PSI of pressure. This gave me 7 feet of 1/4"" hose.

From what I can tell, there are the following solutions   Run longer line run a ""choker"" line near the shank Find an inline restrictor   I really don't want to run longer lines, one that actually would be expensive since I have 4 taps, and it is already getting a little cluttered with the length of hosing I have  I could do a choker line, I just need to find the right fittings. I would have to ask if I ran a choker line right before it gets to my tailpiece (which is for 1/4"" tubing, but I think with some heat I could make it fit snug) would that cause foaming as it would go from 1/4"" down to 3/16 then back up technically for the tail piece which is 1/4?  Lastly, it would be nice to be able to just add an in-line resistor of some sort. Has anyone had any luck with these? Has anyone found them anywhere?  Thanks for your help! "
1645,Brewing with Tonka Beans,I am planning a recipe with Tonka Beans. At what point should I add them and approx. how many? I know that vanilla is usually added after primary.  Should I do the same with these or can I add them already during the boil? 
1646,should I/how do I account for temperature differences for gravity readings?,"I've taken my OG at the start, and another reading last night. Only last night did I register that my OG seemed slightly low according to what the brew can suggested as typical. My OG was 1.037 (can said 1.046 was likely) Last nights reading was 1.019 (after 6 days)  My OG was taken at roughly 26C, and last night at a frosty 19C (the fermenting has been very steadily at 20C almost the entire time - yesterday a cold front hit my area :( )  So, should I be adjusting these readings somehow because of the temperature? Oh yeah, using a hydrometer... I guess that's important to know? :)  EDIT: I now see there are calculators to do so, and it seems like the difference in gravity is tiny, from a 7degC variance (which is a fairly big temperature difference, so I'm surprised) "
1647,Is bitterness extraction dependent on wort volume?,"Supposing I boil the same amount of hops in the same wort (same SG, for the same time, let's say one hour), separately into two pans:   One with 10L wort, and x grams of hops One with 1L wort and x grams of hops   Should I expect different amount of alpha acids to be extracted?  I know that IBU will be very different for the two, but will the absolute amount of bitterness extracted be the same?  To say it in another way: If I add 9L of wort to 2., how will it compare to bitterness of 1.? "
1648,Is it possible to successfully bottle a beer that's already been primed in a barrel?,I'd like to know what the effect of trying to bottle 35 pints of a light ale that's already been primed in a barel would be? Presumably there is still yeast floating about that would be able to convert a new dose of priming sugar for bottling? Might two lots of priming affect the taste? This is a hypothetical question... for now :) 
1649,Ash/ash tray off flavour,"What does cause ash or ash tray off flavour? I made an all grain porter (using chocolate and carafa type I), there is a slight ash tray off flavour. The falvour was apparent at the beginning (just after bottling). Does it depend on the exessive amount of dark grains? Or maybe it is beacause of oxidation?  Carafa+chocolate percentage was about 10% of grains weight. "
1650,yeast cell count importance,"I have a had a question for quite some time that nobody has been able to answer.  The question is more academic or theoretical than it is practical.  Perhaps the community here is a tad smarter (nerdier?) than other brewing forums.  Everywhere I go, people say that higher yeast cell counts are better.  Got a high gravity wort? Use two yeast packs.  Got a couple days before brew day? Use a yeast starter.  My question is why does this matter.  It seems that, theoretically, if you threw one yeast cell in the wort, it would munch on some sugar, and reproduce.  Then it would repeat this cycle until all the fermentable sugar was gone and there would be many many many yeast cells at that point.  Seemingly, the only difference between this pitching millions of yeast cells is that presumably the single yeast cell situation would take longer to get to the end point.    Obviously, this is somewhat contrived. Perhaps the single cell dies before reproducing?  Ignore issues like that for the point of this question.  Why is it important to have many many many yeast cells? "
1651,I don't have a cellar. How should I store my beer?,"I live in a 2 up 2 down house, with no cellar, quite draughty windows, and electric storage heaters (these turn on at midnight and begin to ""store"" heat which in theory is then released through the following day).  In the middle of the house between the two downstairs rooms is a staircase, which has a larder/cupboard underneath. Temperature in here is probably a fairly stable 18°C in winter / 20°C in summer, probably the most stable temperature, but higher than the alternatives.  I have two timber outbuildings – a shed and a summer house – in which the temperatures can fluctuate throughout the day by 10°C, from e.g. 15°C-25°C in summer and e.g. 5°C-15°C in winter (though there will be periods that exceed these ranges).  I have bottled all my beers so far, with fermentation and carbonation happening in the house, before being moved to the shed.   When it comes to storing beer in bottles, what effects will these temperature fluctuations have on the ageing/conditioning of beer? And is it better to store at a steady but higher temperature, or a lower but fluctuating temperature? "
1652,Determining bottling time to get a lightly sparkling Pet-Nat?,"I am making my first wine ever out of slightly tart hand picked cherries. It is currently undergoing open primary fermentation in a large, covered container. In about a week I should be transferring it to a 20l demijohn with airlock if I was to continue the planned fermentation process.  However, I am considering a Pet-Nat sparkling wine as the end result, and I would like to avoid a couple of problems:   Excess sediment Excessively high bottle pressure, as I am uncertain about the bottle tolerances I can get locally   I was thinking that perhaps I could compromise by aiming for a lightly sparkling wine by allowing the closed fermentation to take place in the glass container for a while and also maybe racking it, to allow some clarification and time for sediments to settle, before transferring the wine to capped sekt bottles.  Does this approach make sense? If so, how should I determine when to transfer into bottles to get a light frizzante at the latest possible time? "
1653,How to fill a Corny with Commercial Beer,"It may seem odd that a Homebrewer wants to do this, but my last batch didn't go to plan and then my wife decided to invite our friends round for a BBQ this coming Saturday. I'd prefer to have something on tap even if it is a commercial lager.  Therefore, my question is what are my method options for filling the corny keg with say 5 to 8 litres of commercial lager. Can I start with a 5L party keg for example?  I have a counter pressure bottle filler I made, which might be able to be used in reverse some how? who knows?   I'm hoping someone here can help.  Thanks Alex  EDIT: I'm really looking for a way to get a small amount of beer into the corny the day before it will all be consumed. So commercial keg is too much and too expensive really, hence this post. "
1654,Is aerobic fermentation in beer brewing a myth?,"The more I read about yeast and fermentation, the more conflicting, confusing (and possibly incorrect) statements I come across.  I have read in several bits of literature that yeast requires oxygen for biosynthesis (i.e. cell growth) and prefers to use it for this purpose, to which end it absorbs oxygen shortly after pitching (i.e. during the lag phase and before fermentation begins). Many sources indicate that almost all the dissolved oxygen is absorbed by the yeast within 30-180 minutes after pitching and is thereby removed from the wort.  Which begs the question if there is such a thing as ""aerobic fermentation"" in brewing. I mean, if the oxygen is being removed from the wort, aerobic fermentation (fermentation in an environment that exposes the yeast to oxygen, which not necessarily means the yeast will use oxygen for fermentation) is impossible without adding more oxygen after the lag phase (which, to the best of my knowledge, is neither recommended nor common practice).  As I understand it, yeast absorbs oxygen and nutrients from the wort during the lag phase and uses it for the synthesis of ATP, sterols and fatty acids which are stored in the cells. Then, following the lag phase, anaerobic fermentation starts, during which stage most cell growth takes place.  My questions:   Does aerobic fermentation has a place in this? If so, when and how, and where does the oxygen come from? Does the yeast use sugar for biosynthesis (i.e. cell formation)? What about anaerobic cell growth? I remember reading somewhere that yeast can multiply anaerobically, but the cells produced differ from those synthesized aerobically.   ""One fool can ask more questions than ten wise men can answer."" "
1655,No Starting Hops - Do I need a 60 min boil?,I'm planning to brew a New England IPA where I only use knocked hops and dry hopping. Is there any point in boiling for an hour? What is the minimum time I should boil for? I'm thinking maybe 15 minutes.  
1656,How do I use Honey Malt?,"I hope this isn't too stupid a question.  (I am a ""noob"")  I wanted to experiment with some additional flavourings in my latest brew, and was pondering using Honey Malt, such as this.  But can someone tell me how I am supposed to use it? I see it listed as a ""flavouring"" on some other sites, yet it is a ""malt""? So at what stage, and how, do I add it? Is it supposed to be thrown in right at the beginning, or is it something I only add in late fermentation?  Thanks "
1657,Saving Kveik the old fashioned way?,I've been reading about Norwegian Farmhouse Ales and I'm quite curious about them. Should I drag a wooden wreath through the dregs of my Norwegian Farmhouse Ale and hang it up to dry and re-use it? Is this really viable?   
1658,Yeast harvesting from bottle and fermenter,"I harvested some custom Saison yeast from a particular brewery I like. I made a starter and have kept in the fridge. As there was only a small amount in the bottle (as expected), the amount of yeast is quite small - maybe 3mm layer on the bottom of an average jar. To increase my yeast sample for a future brew, do I just tip the liquid out, re-make another starter, adding this yeast? Can I do this a few times until I have a good amount?  "
1659,Is top-fermenting yeast more prone to building undesired byproducts during bottle fermentation than bottom-fermenting yeast?,"Recently I finished my 6th batch of beer, the first top-fermenting one (wheat beer). The yeast is from a commercial brewery nearby, so I don't know its exact type. Usually my bottle fermentation takes place at cellar or even room temperatures and I put the bottles in the fridge a couple of days before drinking. For bottom-fermenting yeast this worked nicely so far.  The bottle fermentation and storage of the new batch:  Half of the batch (A): 4 weeks at room temperature  Half of the batch (B): one week at room temperature, 3 weeks in the fridge  Half B tastes really good, Half A shows a distinct sour overtone. Is top-fermenting yeast more prone to building undesired byproducts during bottle fermentation than bottom-fermenting yeast? Or could the summer temperatures be the reason? (Cellar: 10°C in the winter, 15°C in the summer, Room: 18°C in the winter, 23°C in the summer) "
1660,Peach blend wine popping corks and very fizzy,"I made a batch of peach blend vinters best wine base. I intentionally added extra sugar as I always do. The majority of residual sugar was converted to alcohol. I racked several times. I then filtered with my vine brite filter system. I degassed a few times. I back sweetened to taste. Let it rest another week with the airlock in place. I then degassed again and bottled. My new wine rack is in my dining room in direct sunlight.   Could the fluctuation of temperatures be the cause of corks popping?    I currently have it in my garage beverage fridge in boxes.    What is the best solution to my problem?   I currently only have 16 bottles left. We have been trying to drink it faster than the others. I have been making wine for 8 years and this is only the second time I have had this problem.    Would Camden tablets before bottling have possibly prevented this from happening?   I think I may have forgotten to use them in this batch. My notes taken during each batch usually show me where I went wrong. Thanks, I have two other batches going now ready for bottling. Blackberry and Blueberry. "
1661,Xmas Brew Ingredients,"I'm making an Xmas brew. So far so good with the primary fermentation (this is my 4th beer so no worries there). It's an ale brewed with 2.5 lbs of grains and dry malt extract (only 8 AAU hops). I've bought the following ingredients for secondary fermentation:   madigascar bourbon vanilla beans whole nutmeg cinnamon sticks 2oz oak wood chips (which have been soaking in bourbon for a week)   My batch is 5 gallons. What amounts of each of these ingredients should I place in the secondary to ensure that they don't overpower the beer? And how should I prepare each item for secondary? I read something about ""scraping the vanilla beans and cinnamon sticks"" - what does that mean?  Beer stats:   OG 1.054 FG 1.014 IBUs 20-25 SRM ~10  "
1662,Chocolate and Coffee Additions,"I am going to be brewing the Zymurgy KBS clone, but a little nervous with some of the additions listed:   2.5 oz Belg Bittersweet Choc and 1.5 oz unsweetened cocoa nibs @ 15 mins.       ***I read that adding straight chocolate to the boil will kill the head retention due to the oils.  Can I cold crash the primary and skim the oil layer before racking into the second? adding 2 oz of GROUND Sumatran coffee @ Flameout.  Will this be tooooooo bitter?  I will also be adding 2 oz of cold brewed Kona to the secondary.   Here is the recipe for those interested:  [website]"
1663,Fermenter overflow into blowoff tube,"I just started my first batch of homebrew using a kit from Brooklyn Brew Shop, and 15 hours in, I seem to have a problem: The fermentation seems to be very vigorous and I have this foam/gunk/residue that has made its way into my blowoff tube (pictures attached). As of this writing, it looks like some wort has also gotten into my jar of sanitizer as well.   Should I be concerned about this? Is this a contamination risk?  At this point would it be better to clean out the blowoff tube, or would I be better off waiting for the fermentation to subside and to replace the blowoff tube with the airlock a couple of days later as recommended in the instructions?  [website][website]"
1664,Stuck fermentation - how long to leave it for?,"Porter, sitting at a steady 22 degrees, should be 5.2% abv, fermentation stopped at 2.5%  A stir took it to 3.5% over a week.  Added yeast, and nutrient, no sign of further fermentation 2 days on.  Should I leave this, how long for? or can I try something else to coax it up to 5.2% ? Somebody suggested kegging and just leaving it, ideally I'd see this brew through to bottling in next 5 days as wish to free up my brew bucket for the next xmas brews. "
1665,When will fermentation end? ( wine ),"I made 10 litres of red wine ( pasteurized grape juice from the supermarket ), added 2kg sugar, used yeast bought from my local homebrew shop. Fermentation started after a day, and for the first two weeks, i had vigorous activity in the airlock. My problem is, its now been a month, and while the airlock activity has slowed down, it has not stopped.  Doesn't this mean that the yeast is still working, and there is still sugar for it to digest? Should i wait for the airlock activity to stop completely before racking? "
1666,How low should the hole for a spigot on a kettle be drilled?,"I am trying to determine how low I can drill a hole in my kettle for a spigot. I've read as few as 1.5 to as much as 3.0 inches. What's a good point that will clear the kettle trub for most if not all beers, taking into account higher OG beers/hops beers, without clearing it too much?  If it matters, I'll be brewing on an induction cooktop, so I won't have to worry about the heat from a propane flame on the spigot. Does this change the equation?  Edit -- Obviously this would depend on the size of the kettle and the typical size of a batch. I have a 10 gallon kettle and will be brewing 5 gallon batches. "
1667,Improvements for Geordie Winter Warmer,"I've just started a single can Geordie Winter Warmer kit and having read some negative reviews about this kit turning out ""weak"" and ""watery"" and like ""beer flavoured soda water"" I'm naturally having doubts about it.  **  Steps taken so far  **  Can of Geordie Winter Warmer 1kg dextrose (wish I'd used dme) 300g black treacle (I've read this can improve the body of a brew)* 100g honey* 100g muscovado sugar* 1tbsp ground cinnamon 1tsp ground ginger (*=whatever sugary stuff I had left in the cupboard, basically - thought by adding this I could improve the OG which came out at 1038 @ 22litres...final OG was 1042)  Yeast is off to a flying start and has around 3-4cm krausen on top about 7hours after pitching. Temperature is around 23 degrees celsius. In hindsight I would have brewed it much shorter at around 18 litres.  **  Potential improvements?  **  An OG of 1042 is lower than what I would want for a full bodied winter warmer (first try - but having done some reading this does seem low) so I was wondering whether I could add some extra dark DME + yeast starter in stages as the fermentation subsides to try to raise the ABV and hopefully improve the malty body of the beer.  **  My question  **  Are there any suggestions of how else I could improve this potential Grinch of a winter warmer? Ideally I would like an ABV around 5-6% but more importantly a sweeter beer with plenty of malty body. Is it too late to do anything about this now? "
1668,Transfert wort in a cube then chill it,I just started the hobby and only brewed two kits. So far I brewed in a 5L (1.3G) kettle. I did the chilling by using a cold bath in my kitchen sink.   So far so good. I plan to buy a proper brew kettle (30L/8G) but it wont fit in my sink. Therefore I'm looking for a chilling solution. I don't want to invest on any equipment and I can't plug an immersion chiller on my kitchen or bathroom faucet anyway.  I found the no-chill solution which gave me the following idea: why not transfert the wort in 10L (2.5G) cubes that fits in my sink and cold bath them (I plan to brew 20L batches max so 2 cubes). Here is written the following:      Do not be tempted to cool the cube prematurely by putting it into a   swimming pool or other body of water. Rapidly cooled hot packed wort   can give rise to infections as it does not allow for the cube to be   exposed to the hot wort for long enough to ensure that any bacteria in   the cube is killed.   How long should I wait before cold bathing the cube so it's heat sanatized? (I think that's the reason why it should not be iced bath right away?)  EDIT: It seems that my question question has been misunderstood. I don't specifically wants to do the no chill solution. I'm just looking for a way to do cold bath chilling with a kettle bigger than my sink. My other solution would be to find a big stainless buket to use for the cold bath. Or is there any plastic bucket than can handle the heat? (I'm afraid that if the hot kettle touch the bucket it would melt.)  EDIT2: I double check I can't screw an adaptaor on any of my faucets so I can't use an imersion chiller. 
1669,First Batch Bottle Exploded,"I'm in the bottling phase with my first batch of beer.  Came home last night and one of the bottles had exploded.  The beer spent 7 days in the primary fermenter and hit the target gravity per the kit.  Then 2 1/2 weeks in the secondary.  When I transferred to the primary fermenter, I poured the liquid back and forth like the kit suggested and it resulted in a lot of foam so it was hard to tell how much water I needed to top off the batch with. By the end of the process I ended up with only 4 gallons instead of 5.  Reading here I think the issue was too much priming sugar (I used what came with the kit which was meant for 5 gallons) combined with storing them in a place that was a bit too warm.. The door to the room I was storing in got shut and furnace warmed it up more than I thought (72+ degrees).  I moved them to the fridge.  Was that the right thing to do?  If so, how long should I leave them in there before drinking?  They were only in the bottles for 5 days before one burst. "
1670,What are the effects of storing unboiled All-Grain Wort at sub-lager temperatures?,"Obviously it is better to immediately boil the wort when it is freshest, giving any wild yeist or bacteria as little time as possible to grow and contaminate the product.  It is also a well established practice to mash all of a recipe's different grains together simultaneously.  These practices work wonderfully when brewing a single recipe at a time.  I am knocking around the idea of brewing multiple, smaller (2-3 gallon) batches simultaneously to allow more experimentation in my recipes.  Beyond just revising the hopps/add-in timings, I want to play with the grain-bill, changing the quantities of each grain slightly for each batch.  With extracts, that would be easy, but mashing each small batch seperately would be far too time consuming.  So here is what I have in mind...  Mashing each of my malts and adjuncts seperately in 5-10 gallon batches, then after sparging, cold-crash the resulting ""single-malt"" wort in a chest freezer.  By recording the OG and volume of each seperate batch, I should be able to calculate a grain-weight to wort-volume ratio which I can use later, when translating my grain-bills from weight-based to volume-based.  The mashing could all be done ahead of time, over time and in volume, so that on brew-day, I can start with a freezer full of different, nearly frozen, ""single-malt"" worts.  From there, boiling up a bunch of small custom batches should be quick and easy; just mix in the appropriate ratios of each wort, and proceed to the boil.  So my questions ""boil down to""...  Assuming that the freezer keeps the un-sterilized wort free of wild growth, what other negative-effects should I expect from the wort's time in cold-storage?    What time scale is safe for storing un-sterilized wort at cold-crash (but not frozen) levels?  (a day, a few days, a week, or hopefully... weeks)  If any of you have tried something like this before, or if you've come up with another method of efficiently experimenting with small all-grain batches, please share your wisdom! "
1671,"Large bottles didn't carbonate, but little ones did","Does anyone have an idea if larger bottles (half liter) are harder to carbonate than smaller ones (1/3 liter)?  I think the problem is that I had a Belgian ale (6.5%) is a secondary and when bottling, I couldn't get much carbonation. I read somewhere that introducing new yeast is a good idea - especially champagne yeast.  However, with time smaller bottles now have decent carbonation, but larger bottles still taste flat. Any reason? The headspace in the bottles is pretty much identical regardless of volume, since I fill them up to the rim and then remove the bottling wand, leaving the headspace.  Thoughts? Josh "
1672,Water to dilute wort,"If I use 3 gals of tap water for the wort. Can I use 2 gl of tap water to make up the 5 I need for fermenting?  Lancaster home brewing say any good tasting tap water is OK, but does it need to be sterile..like after boiling? I intend to keg my brew. "
1673,Extract Brewing - Cooling down wort by adding cold water?,"I don't have a wort chiller yet. I always cool down my wort with 20 pounds of ice and bucket that I place my kettle into.  Since I am extract brewing and will be adding 2.5 gallons of water anyways, I figured why not cool down that water and add it directly to the wort while its in the ice bath? I just did that and the temperature dropped to below 80 in a matter of minutes.  However I was brewing a double IPA which required flame-out addition of hops, which I performed in my hop bag. So the flameout hops were only in contact with the wort for about 10 minutes total before I moved transferred the wort to my carboy.  Additionally, I've read that extract brewers use much more hops than full grain brewers due to the former using half as much water.  Here are my questions:   Is it bad for an extract brewer to add 2.5-3 gallons of cold water directly to the wort before it cools down? I should start all grain brewing in 2 weeks (hopefully). Is there any consequences to adding cold water if the evaporation rate took my batch below what I was aiming for?  "
1674,Replacing orange peel with orange powder,"I am having a hard time finding bitter orange peel in my region, but I did find bitter orange powder.  Can I achieve the same results with the powder instead of the peel? Should I use the same quantity or increase or decrease?  I will it to brew my first wit. "
1675,Fermentation Done After 2 Days?,"So this is a weird one.  3 weeks ago I made an Xmas beer. I brewed it, pitched the #2 yeast, and put the carboy in my cold dark room (about 70 F) to ferment. The fermentation and krausen began about 18 hours after brewing, and lasted for 6 days or so. I measured the FG and it was spot-on so I continued as planned. All was well.  I really like the recipe so I brewed another batch 2 days ago (on Sunday). I pitched the #2 yeast and again put the same carboy in the same dark room at the same temperature. Again, the fermentation / krausen began about 18 hours after brewing. However, tonight I took a look at the carboy only to find that the krausen has completely sunk to the bottom... 4 days earlier than the identical recipe did the last time.  What happened? It's still fermenting given that I can see the 3-piece airlock bubbling, but what is the deal with the super early krausen drop? I'll give it 7 days, measure the FG, and hope for the best, but can anyone explain the reason that batch 1 went 6 days before the krausen dropped and batch 2 went less than 48 hours?! "
1676,"Specific and generic questions from a first timer - size of fermenter, flavoring, gravity, sanitation","I just brewed my first ever German Weizen (using True Brew kit) on Saturday (today is Monday) and it's sitting in a plastic 6 gallon bucket (but there's only 5 gallons of it). I have some questions which were not addressed in my generic guide which came with my equipment and kits. I realize some of these questions probably belong on a forum of some sort, but I turn to the StackExchange community for help as I trust the people. My questions are such:   My kit specified the gravity pre-yeast should be 1.049-1.051, when I measured it was 1.041, will this result in a weaker beer? My equipment featured a 6 gallon plastic bucket and a 5 gallon glass carboy, should I prefer one over the other? Do I need to transfer to secondary fermenter after bubbles really slow down?      More specifically, the six gallon bucket I have has 5 gallons of liquid in it, which means it has a gallon of empty space, which is air, is this bad for the brew? Should I minimize the oxygen and just use the carboy?  I like my Weizens with a flavor and aroma of orange, kinda like Blue Moon or Shock Top. How does one achieve this? Do I add orange peel during boiling? or can I add it when transferring to secondary fermenter? Do I need to add anything else, like more yeast? I have the feeling that I didn't completely sanitize all my equipment (Maybe I missed a spot while cleaning the bucket? maybe I'm just paranoid?) or that I might have been a little careless handling my equipment, will this ruin my brew?  "
1677,What happens if beer ferments below the optimum temperature?,"I am currently brewing an Irish Red Ale. I went away for a few days, and when I got back I discovered the heater had broken at some unknown time. As a result, the ambient temperature dropped to about 40 degrees. The optimum temperature listed was between 57-70 degrees. How does this affect the brew? Do I just need to leave it fermenting longer, or are there additional steps to be taken? "
1678,Alternative/Non-traditional Brewing Practices,"Brew in a bag. No chill. Olive Oil aeration substitute. Overnight mashing. Batch Sparging.   The list continues. These types of techniques are great and frequent areas of discussion in the home brewing forums and the like.  I also have no doubt that these techniques are making good drinkable beer.  I am sure brewers who use these types of techniques really enjoy their beer. Otherwise, they wouldn't really make it to daylight discussions.  But is anyone REALLY making world class beer?  I mean, has anyone seen or heard of competitions being WON by brewers using these techniques.  Or for that matter, even probrewers going these routes where possible.  For example, in Zymurgy magazine they publish the recipes and results of the National Homebrew Competition each year.  I find it interesting that in the years where they have included ""fermenter type"" in the recipe description, no one ever has ""in plastic bucket"" as a fermenter.  Either winning brewers are afraid to admit they use buckets or everyone making top notch beer really is using glass or stainless.  I'm not trying to take away from these techniques, just trying to make sense of the observation that by competition measures, I don't seem to see non-traditional techniques overtaking the more tradition 'time honored' brewing techniques.  This is a wiki, so what say you???? "
1679,Using commercial (breakfast) cereals in a mash,"This question looks similar to Using flakes in a mash, but is not actually the same. I was thinking, if someone runs out of maize flakes, and definitely wants to use some for his mash, what happens if he uses corn flakes? Anyone can see that they are not just maize flakes, but also contain other nutrients, some of them actually being sugars, but are the flakes themselves fermentable? In the same spirit, around my place they sell some rice crackers that are not actually baked, but are more like rice popcorn pressed into cracker form. What happens if someone uses these? "
1680,What causes a stout's creamy head?,"Stouts, especially beers like Guiness (its cousin Kilkenny as well), have a head that's really creamy. Being a stout lover myself, I always envied this head, but I have no idea how one can achieve it. What is so different about these beers' recipe that produces such an exceptional head? Can we achieve it at home? "
1681,How do I do a partial mash?,"I understand (from experience) how to brew with extract and steeping specialty grains.  I understand (from reading numerous books, blogs, etc.) how to do an all-grain mash.  I see little on how to partial mash.  Do I add the specialty grains to the partial-mash or after?  Do I sparge the partial-mash?  Do I wait the hour that an all-grain mash requires?  Typically my beers take 6(or so) pounds of malt syrup, what percentage of malt should be partial-mashed and how much should I reduce the Malt Extract by to compensate (ie, 1 pound of mash = X pounds less syrup/powder)? "
1682,Choosing a good refrigerator/freezer for kegerator conversion,"Does anyone have experience and recommendations for a good fridge/freezer for conversion into a kegerator?  I'm basically choosing between a full sized fridge, a mini-fridge and a chest freezer.  I'll likely start by using it just as a fridge for kegs and lagering and one day make the kegerator conversion.  My priorities are to be efficient, fit at least 2 5 gallon soda kegs, cost-effective and not completely unsightly.  Here is what I already know....  The full size fridge seems a little big for my needs, I live in an apt and would rather not have an additional full refrigerator/freezer.  I have no yard, garage or basement to stash it.  The advantage is they are abundant and cheap on craigslist (although most are not in great condition).  The mini fridge seems popular and there are some good conversion tutorials online.  Unfortunately when I go looking I rarely see any that would actually work.  Either they are very small or contain bulky freezer boxes or crispers that get in the way.  The chest freezer seem perfect, aside from being a freezer.  The inside is large and open and they are relatively cheap and compact.  I own a temperature controller but have never used it.  Will the constant turning on and off of the freezer damage the compressor?  How often should I expect it to flick on and off, is it annoying?  My fear is I'll go away and come back to find either the compressor died or the controller did and the beer is either warm or frozen solid.  Any and all experience welcome! "

1691,Wyeast 1187 Ringwood Failure,"I'll start by saying that I've never used liquid yeast before, so it could all be my fault... Anyway, I ordered some Wyeast 1187 Ringwood to use for a Dogfish Head 60 Minute IPA clone that I did on Sunday night. I'd stored the yeast in the fridge after unpacking and got it out to warm up while I got all my brew stuff out and organised.  After smacking the packet to activate it, I put it to one side and got on with things. After four hours the packet hadn't swelled. So I knocked up a starter solution and poured the contents of the packet into it and left it over night. I the morning there was no sign of activity, so I ended up making another starter with some S-04.  Is this kind of failure common...? How does everyone else handle their liquid yeast...?  Cheers,  Bob. "
1692,Beer tastes like sanitizer,"I've used a no-rinse iodophor sanitizer both times I've brewed. Both times the beer seems to taste a bit like sanitizer. Is it possible I am using too much sanitizer? The last beer I brewed was an all-grain blonde ale, and I way overshot the OG and ended up with a 8.17 ABV. Could it be the abundance of alcohol that I am tasting instead?  I used a plastic food grade bucket as my secondary this time. Before I put the beer in the secondary, I let sanitizer sit in the bucket for about 2 weeks. The beer tastes a bit like a mixture of the sanitizer and that plastic. Maybe I should switch to two glass carboys for primary and secondary, and use less sanitizer? Is it a bad idea to let the sanitizer sit in the fermenters that long? "
1693,Determining the potential gravity of non-grain additions,"How do you determine the potential gravity of certain ingredients? I'm sure there are charts and the like online, but, let's say you want to use a new fruit in a beer.. What are the steps to determining the potential gravity? "
1694,Moldy taste appearing months after bottling,"I brewed and bottled an English Ale in August, and, after a few weeks in the bottle, promptly drank most of the 5 gallons.  However, I'd heard some advice to leave a few bottles for a few months to see how it evolves over time. Yesterday, I cracked open one of the bottles, and it certainly had evolved, but for the worse.  In fact, this brew had become somewhat cloudy, and had a distinctive taste that I could best describe as dusty and moldy. From what I understand, a moldy malt can yield a moldy brew, but this seems doubtful in my case, since I had plenty of this beer and it was delicious until now.  Was it just an anomaly? Or did something grow over time? Perhaps I capped poorly? Or maybe this bottle just wasn't thoroughly clean? "

1696,Mead made from Agave nectar?,"The health food store near me has a sale on dark Agave nectar such that 1 kg costs less than their average 1 kg of honey (usually it costs slightly more than honey). I noticed on the nutritional info on the label that it's got roughly the same sugar content as honey, so in theory, I could use agave nectar to make mead, using the same proportions!  Before I attempt this though, I was wondering if anyone out there has already done this.  Is it as straightforward as I am thinking (basically, follow any regular mead recipe but substitute honey for agave nectar)?   Or are there any differences: differences in process / cooking / fermentation; differences in spices or seasonings added; any other possible differences I hadn't thought of...  All else being equal, would using agave nectar produce a significantly differently tasting mead than honey?  Can I even call it ""mead"" if it's not technially made of honey - should I call it something else?    Some quick research has shown that there is such a drink, called pulque. However, fermentation seems to be driven by bacteria rather than yeast. Has anyone here done this with yeast (since I imagine the right bacteria is harder to get)? Any tips or suggestions?    After a bit more research, it seems that substituting honey for agave in a mead recipe won't yield traditional pulque. I guess it would be agave wine, if nothing else. So maybe the only thing to do is to try it and see what happens!! Anyone have any tips / suggestions? "
1697,"Didn't reach target FG, pitched more yeast, gravity same after a week. Should I just bottle already?","My batch didn't reach the target FG and I'm trying to decide whether to just bottle or to pitch more yeast (would be 3rd pitch).   I have a very similar situation to the one described here:  Brewed an Oatmeal Stout and the gravity did not drop as much as predicted, should I re-pitch or add yeast nutrients/energizer?  Also made an oatmeal stout, did a partial mash w/about 5.5 lbs of extract and 5 lbs of grains including 1 lb of flaked oats. I used liquid yeast (White Labs English Ale) and made a 1 liter starter.  Target OG was 1.055, mine came in at 1.050. After two weeks it went down to 1.019-1.020 (kind of on the line). Target FG for the recipe is 1.016. It got too cold at one point so I thought it might have stalled.  So I pitched another packet, waited a week and the gravity is as the same place. I didn't make a starter with the dry yeast, because there's a lot of yeast in a dry packet and it seemed like overkill for a 5 gal batch.   I'm guessing that I just have a lot of unfermentables in there which are bumping up the gravity. I added 1/2 lb of cocoa powder and maybe didn't have the best efficiency with my stove top partial mash which included oats.   I tasted it and I don't think it's particularly sweet for a stout - tastes pretty good to me for room temp uncarbonated beer.  So should I just bottle already? "
1698,Any special considerations (besides taste) when brewing with mineral water?,"I understand that a good rule of thumb for brewing water is that if it tastes good it's good to use for brewing.  Most of these nine springs that i've tried are way too mineraly to my taste but ""7 Minute"" and ""Ute Chief"" are really good and I'd like to at least use a bit of one to my brew water to add some depth to the beer.  Aside from taste, will any of these minerals affect the yeast in a bad way?  Or will this be simply an aesthetic change to the taste?  Ethan N.  I guess I should add that I'm looking to brew a Double IPA.  Cheers   "
1699,Yeast Starter with Corn Sugar?,"Anyone try making a yeast starter with Corn Sugar instead of DME?  If so what proportions of corn sugar did you use?  I am planning on brewing a high gravity stout, and don't have any DME for the starter, but do have plenty of corn sugar.  Thanks. "
1700,How long do I need to carbonate a keg?,"I've recently inherited a keg system from a friend moving interstate and have just dropped my first batch into the keg.  I found this chart from a link here that shows CO2 units by pressure &amp; temperature.  Once I've filled the keg, applied pressure as dictated by the desired carbonation level &amp; storage temperature, how long does it need to stay there for before I can pour beer after delicious beer?  Does it change based on temperature (e.g. am I better off with it in the fridge or ambient temp)?  That chart also mentions it is for ""slow force carbing"" - is there a quick force carbing method?  If you need to give an example, I'm after about 3-3.2 CO2 units in a 19L (5gal) batch and the beer is in the fridge (~40F). "
1701,How long should a Belgian Strong Dark Ale be aged?,"How long should a clone of Gulden Draak be aged before comparing it to the real stuff? Our club is trying to get our clone recipe as close as possible, so want to tweak the recipe to get it closer to Gulden Draak if there are significant differences. We want to minimize the chance that the differences are due to our clone being too ""green"" when we make the comparison. Also, should we age it longer in the carboy vs. in the bottles? The current plan is 14 days of primary, 14 days of secondary, then prime, bottle, and condition for 60-90 days. "
1702,Will Dry Hopping Add Bitterness?,"The prevailing wisdom seems to be that dry hopping is for aroma only, and effects on flavor are assumed to be a matter of perception. (i.e. smell affects taste)  However, while attempting to ""fix"" a beer that came out far too sweet, I have been looking into hop extracts, etc.  While researching I came across this message:     From a chemical point of view, dry hopping will extract all of the alpha and beta acids in hops. The humulones, lupulones and other volatile oils are isomerized in the alcohol and water (the alcohol dues most of the extraction). Yes, more aroma and flavor will be extracted, but so will bitterness. We dry hop most of the time to add aroma to the beer, so most of the time we dry hop with low alpha acid ""aroma"" hops. Try dry hopping with Galena, Perle, Simcoe, Challenger, Northern Brewer or other high alpha acid hop. You will get the bitterness!   Is this true?  Will using high-alpha hops for dry hopping contribute bitterness? "
1703,How do I determine the freshness of malt & hops?,"In a lot of recipes I have read, there is an emphasis on the freshness of the malt and hops. If I am buying online or in my homebrew store, how do I determine the freshness of what I am buying?   Are there some maltsters that are better than others?  Or is there a ""born on"" date on the malt? If so, what is a good length of time?  Is it the time from when the grain was harvested? or the time from when it was malted?  So: how can I make sure I am getting the freshest ingredients? "
1704,Low original and final gravity,"My roommate and I brewed our first batch of beer, a Rogue Dead Guy clone (with some substitutions). The brew has finished secondary fermentation and our hydrometer reads 1.007 (temperature-adjusted). With an OG of 1.033 This gives our beer an ABV of around 3.4. While the beer itself tastes great, we were hoping for something a little stronger.  Here's the recipe we ended up using: 1 lb Cara-Munich 1 lb Munich 1/2 lb Crystal 40L Steeped at 155 F for 30 minutes, then 1/2 gallon of water at 170 F was poured over the grain bag into pot. I think this is sparging, but I'm not sure :)  Added 4 lb Alexanders Pale LME, 4 lbs LDME. 1 oz Perle hops at 60 minutes, 1/3 oz Warrior at 30, 1/3 oz Warrior at 5, and 1/4 oz Saaz at 5.  The wort was cooled to 75 F and the yeast was pitched. We transferred to a carboy and filled it up to five-and-some-change gallons.  I have two questions. We realized later that the tap water we filled up with has a pH of 7.8 - is this too alkaline? Finally, is there anything we could do now to get fermentation started again (i.e., yeast energizers, shamanic chants, etc.)? "
1705,Secondary Fermentation - Gravity too high to bottle but it's not going anywhere,"I have an Oatmeal Stout in the secondary fermenter (carboy) and it's been there for about a week. I checked the hydrometer reading this morning and it's at 1.020. The og was about 1.052, and when I moved from the Primary to secondary it was about 1.024. I was aiming for a FG of 1.010. Any ideas? Can I keep in the secondary for another week? Can I gently shake the carboy to awaken the yeast? "
1706,Old homegrown hops,"I have been growing and using my own hops for a couple of years now. after harvesting this year I left them out to dry, they have been drying now for a little to long (about two months) they are all brown and papery. just wondering what the effects of being left out are, oxidization? alpha and beta acid loss? should I just toss them? "
1707,Pausing a ginger beer plant,"I am making ginger beer, the old fashioned way with a plant. The plant is a jamjar which I feed with one teaspoon of sugar and powdered ginger daily.  I'm going on holiday soon, for several weeks. I've been nurturing this plant for a couple of months and it's getting really nice, and I don't want to have to start again from scratch. What can I do to preserve it while I'm away?  I have access to a fridge (about 3ºC) and a freezer (about -10ºC). Given that the plant is a rather complex symbiotic mixture of yeast and bacteria, can I halt both their metabolism simply by putting it in the fridge? Can I freeze it without killing it off completely?  The other thing I'm worried about is that given that the plant lives at room temperature and covered only by a cloth, secondary infections are prevented partly by the sterilising effect of the ginger and ethanol, but mostly by the way that there's a hell of a lot of plant there and it's simply outcompeting any wild yeast or bacteria. If I damage the plant too much it won't be able to do this any more, and I run the risk of poisoning the plant.  Any ideas?  Update: I'm not posting this as an answer become someone else already has that honour, but...  After forgetting about the one in the fridge for too long it went manky and I threw it away. However, I recently brought the one in the freezer out of cryosuspension, fed it up for a week, and bottled.  Turns out that freezing thoroughly kills a ginger beer plant. After a week and a half the bottles are totally failing to pressurise. And now one of the bottles is going mouldy on top (the mould is floating on the surface of the liquid). To me this suggests that the ethanol content isn't high enough to kill off the mould. So I reckon that's a total failure.  I think now I'm going to have to start again from scratch; which is a shame, as I was getting a really good flavour out of it. It may be possible to salvage some of that by recycling the liquid from the culture, but it's probably not worth the risk. "
1708,Aging a beer bottled from the keg,"I have a Russian Imperial Stout that I want to age for a full year.  I currently have it in kegs, uncarbonated.  I like to bottle from kegs that have been force carbonated due to the lack of sediment in the final product.  Can I force-carbonate it now, then bottle, and still expect it to get better with age?  What if I'm force carbonating in the refrigerator? "
1709,Raising OG before pitching yeast,I am using an all-grain recipe for a Belgian ale. My OG came out to 1.052 rather than 1.081-5. What can I do to raise the OG before pitching the yeast? Will a pound or two of malt extract help? 
1710,Yeast for making (non alchoholic) ginger beer,"I'm planning to make some ginger beer. I want it to be non-alcoholic, and I am ordering some wine yeast to ferment it. I have two questions about yeast, though, since I am new to fermenting anything.  1) Do I need to kill the yeast off with anything before it is safe to drink? I've read some online articles that say that ingesting active yeast is dangerous.  2) How much alcohol will develop by the time enough fermentation has occurred to get fizzy?  EDIT I really know next to nothing about alcoholic beverages. I just don't want to get drunk/tipsy on a glass or two of this stuff, and I will (if it turns out good) be serving it to some friends as well. The recipe I'm going to follow is here. "
1711,Cleaning Many PET Bottles,"How do I clean my set (>30) of PET bottles? I'm dealing with dried beer and yeast residue from my previous batch. I doubt I can use hot water, since it would deform the plastic.  Do I need to scrub the inside of every single bottle, or is there an easier/faster way? "
1712,Why does Northern Brewer's Fast Pitch Canned Wort not require any boiling?,"Northern Brewer has a product called Fast Pitch Canned Wort. The instructions say that you can just mix it with water out of the tap and then pitch yeast to make a yeast starter.  Why does this not requiring any boiling? Presumably the canned wort itself is sterile, but what about the water that is added, and what about the outside of the container? In a video, a Northern Brewer employee just opens the can with his grubby hands, adds water and pitches yeast into it.  Why is this not a recipe for a an infected starter? "
1713,Can a homebrew with a FG of less than 1.000 become infected?,"My 100% pilsner mashes that are fermented with Wyeast 3711 French Saison routinely hit a FG of 0.996.  If bacteria contamination was introduced after fermentation was complete, is it possible for the beer to become 'infected' (or otherwise have off flavors)? For example, do I need to sanitize my kegs or bottles in this circumstance? "
1714,Gas in first ferment,"I'm brand new to home brewing and have bought a starter kit and a box of Norfolk Wherry.  We are 1 day into our 6 day first ferment, and this morning my fermenting tub was whistling because there was so much gas built up under the lid.  I have let it out, for fear of the lid shooting off and exploding everywhere.... Am now concerned that I may have ruined the beer?? Any advice would be greatly received "

1716,Carbonating keg without having it hooked up,I have a kegerator made for one keg. However it holds 2 so I like to have one near ready when the primary keg goes empty. My question is. If I transfer my latest beer batch from the secondary to my standby keg and pump it up with CO2 do I have to leave it connected to the co2 line? Will it still carbonate or at least start? 
1717,Lager got warmed when doing secondary fermentation,I'm brewing lager for the first time. Primary fermentation is completed in 2 weeks without anything negative under 8-10 Celcius. But after putting it to the secondary fermenter it seems my fridge has broken when I was away. I think the temp was around-23-25 C after fridge broke down. Perhaps it stayed like this around 2 weeks. Should I pour it to toilet? Or should I bottle it? Thanks for responses. 
1718,For 2L of final cider do I need to put the whole yeast sachet?,"I have only 4kg of apples, which will give me 2L of cider. I'm using an 11g dry yeast sachet. Do I need to pour the whole 11g or just 5g?  If I use it all, will the final taste be influenced by the yeast? "
1719,"Replace current quick disconnect barb with 5/16"" barb","I recently bought a length of hose for connecting my regulator to my quick disconnects. The hose fits snug on the regulator barb but is very loose on the quick disconnect barb.  Here is the hose - 5/16"" / 8mm ID.  And my disconnect.  I wanted to replace the current quick disconnect barb with a larger 5/16"" one but I can't seem to find any Irish / UK / EU suppliers.

Any advice would be appreciated. "
1720,Saving head retention,"I have head retention problems in an extract bock, and I've been working my way through the potential issues. It's in a keezer.   Line is 3/16, length is 8ft Pressure is 14psi (I live at 5,000ft) Pour time is 8-9 seconds Fan circulates air Keezer is 38F Lines are coiled on top of keg, no CO2 breakout in the lines I'm confident in the carbonation levels, it has been slow-carbing for months   Once the beer hits the glass, the CO2 rapidly breaks out, forming glassy bubbles instead of white foam, and it sounds like a soda. A strong head of these glassy bubbles appears, but quickly dissipates leaving the beer completely flat.   I've experimented with chilling the glasses, which helps but does not solve the problem. I've worked on ""beer clean glassware"", scrubbing with a brush &amp; baking soda/salt. They might not be ""beer clean"", but commercial beer has good head &amp; lacing in the same glasses vs my bock.   At this point I'm thinking I must have some detergent traces in the beer- I used to clean my kettle and a few other elements for the boil with soap. I stopped a while ago, but there could still be residue.  Any ideas of other possible causes?  If it is detergent in the beer, is there anything I can do to save it?  P.S. I think I can rule out a CO2 leak in the gas side of the system, because my 5lb CO2 tank has been holding pressure for 3 months, and because the freezer is not full of CO2  Minor update: I got to thinking. I have a one-way check valve on the gas line. I began to wonder if it had a forward pressure (like a diode's forward voltage), i.e. the valve closes when the pressure across the valve is too low, resulting in a lower pressure on the other side of the valve. I swapped to an ordinary quick disconnect with no check valve, and some gas began flowing into the keg! So while the regulator was at 14psi, the keg was at something lower. Likely not much lower, but it was an interesting discovery. Does anyone know if there is a ""standard forward pressure"" for check valves? "
1721,Can I clean and reuse a grain bag?,"Brand. Spanking. New. To brewing. Just bought an Amber Ale extract kit (don't judge!) and equipment set from Brewer's Best. I read the ""Brew Day"" instructions and they included a grain bag that they want me to use for steeping the grain in.  What I'm wondering is: can I clean and reuse this bag, or is it contaminated or otherwise made unusable once I use it the first time? And if it can be cleaned, what's a sanitary/safe way to do so?    Update: after running through wash   "
1722,Is there a temperature my boil should not exceed?,"I'm new to brewing (as in, tomorrow is my first brew day, ever) and I'm using a Brewer's Best Amber Ale extract kit. The directions are very thorough and precise (at least for a newbie's standards) but one thing that has me a little concerned is the boil temperature.  After steeping between 150&deg;F and 165&deg;F, they want me to increase the heat to bring the wort to a nice rolling boil.  I gave this a dry run last night with nothing more than a pot of water (I wanted to test the controls on my stove so I could map stove settings to temperature ranges...yes I'm a nerd). Water boils at 212&deg;F, and I was able to keep the water at a rolling boil for 55 minutes at 215&deg;F. But I then read that if (during the steeping) you let the water/wort get above 170&deg;F, the grain can leach tannins into the wort and ruin the taste.  I'm worried about the same thing happening during the boil. So I ask: is there a temperature that is ""too hot"" to boil at? Is there a preferred range to boil in? Why/why not?!? "
1723,Added my Malt syrup and brought to a boil BEFORE my grain,So I was starting a new batch and completely distracted over bills etc and realized once my malt was boiling that I COMPLETELY forgot to add and steep my grain. I added them for about 10 minutes after even tho it was boiling. Any idea how this will affect the outcome?  Did I just completely mess this up or what? Still pretty new to brewing btw. It was intended to be a Porter but not sure now. 
1724,How to keep extract from caramelizing during the boil?,"I'm brand new to brewing and am trying to make sense of the instructions from my extract kit (Brewer's Best Amber Ale). During the instructions for the boil, they say that it's important to make sure that the LME/DME extract doesn't accumulate and caramelize on the bottom of my brewpot (stainless steel stock pot).  My question is: How do I accomplish this? What tricks/techniques/etc. exist to make sure that the extract doesn't bind up, fall to the bottom of the brewpot, and essentially char/burn itself onto the brewpot?** Is it simply a matter of stirring continuously? If so, how often, etc.? "
1725,"Where does the ABV% ""magic number"" come from?","In my Brewer's Best Amber Ale extract kit, the formula for calculting ABV% is:  (OG - FG) x 131.25   Yet, from this YouTube tutorial, the formula is:  (OG - FG) x 105   I'm wondering what these magic numbers (e.g. ""131.25"", ""105"") are, why they're different in the two formulations, and how to accurately calculate them for different brews in the future. Any ideas? "
1726,"First time Controlled Temp Fermentation, May have put yeast to sleep","Just made a falconer's flight/citra IPA. Well, for the first time, I have a free cooler to do a controlled temp fermentation. I had the cooler set to 50 degrees to help cool the wort before pitching. I pitched, and fell asleep before turning the cooler up to 63 degrees like a moron. I woke up to no action in the air lock and no movement in the beer. I got the temp up slowly (it took all day) and now it's in its controlled environment at 63 degrees. This morning i woke up there were a few tiny yeast rafts on top. My questions are:  1- Does the yeast rafts indicate the yeast waking up? Will fermentation kick off soon or am i out of luck?  2- The wort sat at around 50 degrees for 12 hours and has been slowly warming up for around 30 hours at the desired temp. Should i expect off flavors? Will it be alright since it was sealed and at a low temp? "
1727,Is it ok to tip the brewpot while racking?,"I brewed my very first batch of extract (Brewer's Best Amber Ale) yesterday morning, and I'm still not seeing any bubbling in the airlock. I'm running through a list of things that could I could have done wrong, and one of them might have been from when I racked the wort from the (cooled) brewpot into the plastic ""Ale Pale"" fermenter.  Yes, I confirmed the wort was chilled down to 110&deg;F before I racked. And yes, I racked using a sanitized autosiphon, into a sanitized fermenter. And yes I added several gallons of refrigerated distilled water into the fermenter prior to pitching the yeast, confirming that the wort was 70&deg;F at that time.  But the one thing I might have done very wrong was that I tried to autosiphon every last ounce out of the brewpot, even tipping it nearly on its side to make sure the autosiphon got everything.  Did I introduce ""bad things"" (trub?) into the fermenter by doing this? If so, what are these bad things, why are they bad, and is it OK to just leave the last 1/4"" - 1/2"" of cooled wort in the brewpot next time?!? "
1728,How to troubleshoot for either bad wort or bad yeast?,"Brand new to brewing, 2.5 days ago I brewed my first extract kit (Brewer's Best Amber Ale) and racked it into my fermenter. By tomorrow morning I'll be at the 3 day (72 hours) milestone, which is what I've heard is the end of the ""everything is OK"" range; and still no bubbling activity in the airlock. And I don't expect there to be when I wake up tomorrow...I've checked and rechecked the seal w/ the plastic fermenter, and it appears to be solid.  If I wake up tomorrow and still don't see any bubbling, I would like to open up the lid and take a peek to see what's happening on the inside of the fermenter, but would like to know a few things before I go and expose my wort/beer/whatever-the-heck-it-is-at-this-point to the air:   If the wort is bad, how can I tell? Are there obvious signs of bacterial contamination or wild yeast? If the wort is still good/salvageable, what can I do to kickstart/resurrect it? I'm out of yeast and the yeast I used was from the kit.   Some things to help put this into context:   All equipment was sanitized via Easy Clean Wort was ~70&deg;F when I pitched the yeast I let the yeast sit on the surface, untouched, for ~20 mins to rehydrate them Then I stirred them into the wort vigorously, so as to distribute them and to help aerate the wort (did I kill them?) The fermenter has been sitting in my dark, dry, cool (~65&deg;F) basement ever since I racked this past weekend   Anyways, I'm just wondering what I can look for when I open up the lid, what signs might tip me off to where I went awry, and what I might be able to do so that my first batch of homebrew (ever) isn't a total failure. After spending ~$150 on all the equipment and ingredients, my wife would appreciate that last part :-).    Update: At the 72 hour mark here's what the wort looks like:    Here's the most messed up part: I went to take the SG. I sanitized the hydrometer and gently set it in the top of the wort (I don't currently have a test jar) and... and the darn thing sunk all the way to the bottom!!! Kerplunk! Gone!  What the heck does that mean?!? OG was 1.045 3 days ago...  Also, how do I safely (i.e. sanitarily) get my hydrometer out of the wort? It's completely submerged... "
1729,Can any LME be used for Mr. Beer kits or is it suggested to only use theirs?,"I'm looking for alternative LME providers to use with my 6 gallon Mr. Beer kit. Coopers LME selection is decent, but I was wondering if anyone has used other brands of LME before with Mr. Beer. If so, how did it compare with the Coopers line? Are there any advantages/disadvantages to any brands? "
1730,Does distilled water and/or alcohol cause airlocks not to bubble?,"I fermented my first batch of extract in a plastic 'ale pail' using an airlock with the following mixture in it:   50% tap water; and 50% whiskey   It never bubbled. Not even once. In 3 days. And while I can't prove scientifically that the lid was on tight, it was on as tight was I could make it!  But, when I cracked open the lid and took the SG, it was obvious that fermentation was occurring). I was told by someone recently that airlocks consisting of either distilled water or alcohol usually don't bubble:     ""Usually won't get bubbles if just using distilled water or alcohol, not enough surface tension.""   I'm curious as to what this means (exactly), because to me (an uninitiated rookie), if CO2 is trying to escape, it shouldn't matter whether you're using alcohol, distilled water, tap water or crude oil: gas has to escape!  So what's so special about both distilled water and alcohol that causes it not to bubble when used inside an airlock?!? I guess I'm hung up on the meaning of ""not enough surface tension"". "
1731,Temperature Control Issues,"I'm testing out a brand new 200L system and found a couple of potentially disastrous but potentially easy-to-fix issues:  1) While mashing the temperature indicated on the thermometer which sits near the bottom of the tun was fluctuating wildly between 60 and 70 degrees. It might go from 62 degrees to 70 degrees in a matter of seconds, then a few minutes later fall back down, even without any additional heat from the stove or from hot water additions. Other times when adding heat from the stove the temperature would remain in the low 60s. Obviously this is still in the desirable temperature range for mashing but means it's difficult to control the mash temperature for repeat recipes. There is a sight gauge with an inlet near the bottom and outlet at the top. The tun has no insulation, just a stove for heating/maintaining temperature.  Any ideas what could be going on? Some crazy convection current? At the moment I'm thinking my only option might be to get a jacket to insulate the tun once it's at the desired mash temperature. Anyone have any other suggestions?    2) My boil kettle is the same size, also with a sight gauge and thermometer near the bottom, as well as an in-place immersion cooler fixed inside. I found that after the boil I cooled for an hour and saw the temperature drop to 20 degrees so began filling the fermenters. However by the time I was drawing the last 3rd of the batch the temperature reading was back up to 50 degrees! Sadly, I didn't realise until I'd already aerated the wort in the fermenter :smack:.  My best guess is that the hot wort rose to the top and sank down to the bottom as I was gradually drawing it off. With less wort in contact with the immersion chiller it wasn't cooled properly. Should I carry on chilling for another hour? Or maybe draw the wort off in batches while continuing to chill? Or plump for a plate chiller?  Thanks "
1732,First time brewer needing help,This is my first time homebrewing.  My first batch of witbier Has been in the secondary fermenter for 3weeks  now. How do I know  A) when it's done? B) if it's ok to drink  I see a whitish greenish line around the top layer on the edges. Is that ok?  Thanks in advance. 
1733,Ingredients in Seconday - Prevent Particles In Beer,"OK, so I brewed an xmas beer about a month ago. It turned out awesome. One thing I did was add a bunch of ingredients into the secondary fermentation. The ingredients were vanilla bean, wood oak chips soaked in bourbon, nutmeg, and cinnamon sticks.  The beer turned out great but each bottle has a fair amount of sediment suspended in it from the vanilla bean / cinnamon sticks / nutmeg in it. I know that this is from me dumping my secondary ingredients straight into the fermenter.  How can I avoid the sediment in the future when I do things like dry-hop or add ingredients to secondary? Is there a good nylon bag or something I can use? A filter of some sort? "
1734,Beer stirring spoon,I want to make my own brewing spoon. Can I use myrtlewood for a stirring spoon for beer? Will it change the flavor of the beer? 
1735,"Why would one batch of beer, brewed the same as the second, be more bitter?","In fear of going into too much detail and yet not providing enough information to ascertain possible reasons;  Does anybody have any reasonable hypothesis as why one batch of beer would be more bitter than a second batch when re-produced exactly the same?  Does anyone have any answers as why this may happen?  The best information I can provide are my records.  It stands to reason there will be more questions of me before possible answers can be provided, and I'm happy to provide more information.    reply dated 9/12/14  Firstly thank you to those who responded, I have lunched myself into exploring the information provided to isolate my possible reasons for this batch being higher in bitterness.  I do feel as I have failed to provide the correct information in order to portray my situation. I beg your forgiveness and have provided the TWO offending records.  Thus I will endeavour to provide more information and dismiss possible instances that could be causing the fault.  'To eliminate the variables will assist in finding my mistake'.  NOTE: I have now found out how to use OneNote and this should help to read my records.  Batch #218 was in fact my best beer! - #218 did achieve a second place in the local show, thus my perseverance to reproduce it.  The problem batch is #220!  From my observations there are two note worthy differences between the batches:   The addition of Gelatin to clarify the beer when kegging. Could this be the problem? - NOTE: I hope to disprove this issue once the bottled #220 ( that has no Gelatine ) has had sufficient time to carbonate - will update in the future. Not taking an accurate time in the first batch when the Cacao Nibs where added to the adjunct boil.( #220 notes where taken - 30min before the end of boil ) From memory # 218 had the Cacoa nibs added as late as 10 min before the end of the adjunct boil, but I can not be sure.  Could this be the problem?   The deciding factor to use Fining's in #220 was that #218 was 'cloudy' and did not present well when pouring a beer.  At the risk of lay it all out for everyone to see I have included my tasting notes. Some comments are brutally honest! - Please see the humour in them.  Might I add that procedurally I have developed what I consider a ridged set of procedures when brewing, my reasoning for this is to be able to reproduce a beer, and I have very successfully achieved this many times before.  But alas 'brewing is an art within the science'.  To answer some comments:  HOPS - To my knowledge the hops was of the same batch, only difference was the date utilising the hops from making #218 and #220 - less than a month. ( hops stored in air tight container in fridge)  WATER - All my brewing water is filtered, two stage down to Carbon 0.2 Micron.  I currently do not take PH readings as I have not ventured into Full Mash Brewing, YET!  Yeast - Both S04 Safale of the same vintage ( stored in fridge )  Skimming the krausen - I see the errors of my ways... but in my defence I only conduct this procedure prior to any hops being added.  FG - Well I do not have and answer to why the FG of #218 was so high ""1.019"" - Seeing as it was my first attempt at using the Cacao Nibs with an English Bitter I presumed the FG of 1.019 was due to the extra addition of the Nibs!?!?  The more I review my post I see many avenues that may contribute to my problem, but I hope someone else can see my glaring mistake!     "
1736,Neglected to Cold Crash after fermentation,"The Question Will cold crashing after a beer is bottled (and waited 2 weeks for the carbonation) give you the same clarity as doing it in the fermenter prior to bottling (assuming you pour your beer carefully given the extra sediment that will exist)? Are there different rules to follow if you bottle cold crash vs fermenter cold crash?  The Background: I brewed an Irish Ale. Everything turned out great except I wish I tried cold crashing it prior to bottling. I haven't done it before and I am itching to find out how much impact cold crashing has relative to other practices to combating chill haze  The beer is has good clarity (from what I can tell) at room temp but, of course, produces chill haze when refrigerated. I have done some experiments with almost freezing a bottle (carefully) and then refrigerating it.  Amazingly, within a day, the beer is noticeably clearer.  For the purposes of keeping the question directly on the Cold Crashing technique, I have produced a good rolling boil, used Irish moss, cooled wort down within 15 minutes using a counter flow chiller, primary fermented for 2 weeks, secondary for 3 weeks and no gelatin (since I would need to cold crash for it to work).  The Disclaimer          I have seen this post   but didn't did not quite address the question I have above. It did address the question if bottle crashing can be done but didn't describe the effectiveness and differences relative to doing it in the fermenter.     "
1737,Using a pump for brewing,"I'm getting a Chugger pump for Christmas. I have never used a pump in my brewing and I haven't yet bought the hardware and tubing so I have some questions. I do know that I need a ball valve on the pump outlet to control the flow.  1 - I would like to use hose barbs (without clamps) to quickly change the hoses that are connected to the pump. Will half-inch hose barbs and half-inch silicone tubing create enough of a seal to prevent leaks when the pump is creating pressure or do I need to get quick disconnects?  2 - If I do use quick disconnects, is there a preferred way to arrange the male and female connectors? Male on the pump and female on the hoses or female on the pump and male on the hoses or some other combination? I just wonder if there is any advantage to a particular arrangement.  3 - Since the pump inlet has to be below the liquid and the outlet will also be below the container I'll be pumping into, I assume that when the inflow runs out the hose on the outlet side will be full of liquid that can no longer be pushed along. Is that correct? If so, how do you handle disconnecting the hose without spilling the liquid?  4 - If I want to pump into a container that has a ball valve on it, is there any reason I can't attach the pump outlet hose to that ball valve and open it to pump the liquid in through the ball valve?  5 - Any other tips or recommendations? "
1738,Can I deal with diluted amounts of preservatives and still get good hard cider?,"On a whim I decided to throw some Cider in a bucket, so I went to the store and grabbed some.    I took a chance and bought 2/3 no preservatives and 1/3 preservative (4.5 Gallons total) in order to lower costs. I added about 1/2 lb brown sugar and about 8 oz of honey. Added acid, energizer, and a campden tablet   I am letting it site for 24 hrs, my question is can I do anything about the preservatives? I figured I could just dilute but some sites seem to suggest starting a culture with a small bottle of preservative free cider for a couple days.  Also on the side, is leaving the preserved at room temp OK for a couple days with the Campden without any issues? "
1739,Looking for process improvement suggestions,"I just did my 4th brew, my OG was lower than expected, and I'm looking for help with process improvements. I'm doing an all grain process. I have an 8gal kettle, a 2gal kettle, and a 0.5gal kettle. For the mash tun I have a 10gal home depot converted cooler with ball valve control spigot.   My process is as such:   Day before - fill the kettles with water, let them sit 24 hours with a Campden tablet shared between the pots.  Heat 6.5gal of water in the 8-gal kettle to 160F. Warm the mash tun, check the water is still 160F. Dump the grain into the mash tun,  Tip the 6.5gal of 160F water into the mash tun. Actually this starts out by moving it 1 quart at a time as I'm unable to safely dump the entire 6.5 gal of hot water in one shot anyway, and I heard it was better to add it slowly to the dry grain.  Stir with my giant 24"" spoon to check no air pockets  (just at the start) Then leave for an hour. (temp remains constant for the hour within 150-155F - typically around 152F) Recirculate until the flow of wort is relatively clear Drain until empty back into the 8 gallon kettle - this typically yields about 4.2 gal.  Meanwhile I've heated the 2 gal kettle and 1/2 gal kettle to 170F Dump 2.5gal of 170F water into the mash tun to sparge Stir briefly Wait 15 minutes Recirculate until flow of wort is relatively clear Add this to the kettle until the kettle is back up to the 6.5gal mark Boil for an hour adding hops and Irish moss as prescribed 45 minutes into the boil add the wort chiller to sanitize it (no water flow connected). Transfer to the sink, connect the water flow to the chiller, also add blocks of ice into the sink Stir the wort with the chiller and drop the temperature down to 70-75F Siphon to 6.5 gal better bottle Test OG - this is usually done with the final, rather trubby, bit of the wort.  Pitch yeast Wait until airlock starts to bubble, then chill to prescribed fermentation temp in a temp controlled modified-freezer.     My recipe involved 11 lbs of grain for a pilsner, with an expected OG of 1.049 mine measured 1.044, so a little lower than expected. My previous brew called for an expected OG of 1.062 but my process only yielded 1.051 so lower still.   I'm wondering - are my OG's lower because I'm using a higher volume (6.5gal for the boil) than a typical recipe expects?  Specifically, with a 5gal recipe - what exactly is supposed to be 5gal? The pre boil volume, the post boil including trub volume, the volume initially put into the fermenter without the trub, or the bottled volume? I've been trying to target 5gals into the bottles, my last round yielded 4.66gal. But perhaps this is my misunderstanding and might completely explain my OG delta?  MANY thanks for reading this long one!  Roland. "
1740,Left bottles in car overnight - am I screwed?,"Last night I bottled an extract kit with a friend, divided bottles, drove home, and left them in the car overnight 6pm to 6am. It got down to 5 degrees F, but the beer did not get cold enough to freeze.   So, is there anything I can do? I unpacked them somewhere warm and swirled them around a bit, but I'm guessing that even in a refrigerator that long the yeast would go dormant. I know that it's possible to open it back up and repitch the yeast, and I've heard of people measuring out amounts for each bottle, or dumping it back into the carboy and restarting the beer. It was a fairly big beer (1.070) with US-05.  Which way is the best? Starter needed? Or is it resilient enough to carbonate despite being that cold overnight? "
1741,Fermenter head space and airlock hole,"Hi folks I'm after a bit of advice as its my first time doing home brew    I'm using Wilkos dark velvet stout. As it states on the tin to make 40 pints fill, to 23 litres. Now I have a 23 litre fermenting bucket, which gives me 2.5 feet space for the head. Is this enough space? In the lid I have cut a hole for my airlock, and between the rubber that squeezes in the hole for the airlock to sit in it has a couple of small gaps. Does this matter? Does it need to be airtight, or is it better to have the extra gap?  "
1742,Long cold crash for an ale. Benefit or harm?,I cold crash my ales to reduce sediment and clear the beer. My understanding is that even as little as a day would do that. But my brewing partner and I have often (due to time constraints) kept them at low temps ~1c for long periods e.g. a month.   We usually use us-05 but I suppose the question goes for any standard ale.   Are there any issues with this length of time?  Are there any benefits? 
1743,Off-flavour after carbonation,"I tasted the beer when it came out of the fermenter and it was great. I cooled it to 4 degrees then I racked it into the keg and force carbonated - about 1 minute at 300kPa, a good few minutes of vigorous shaking later it dropped to 140kPa so left it for an hour. I then tapped the keg and it was all foam - very overcarbonated... my regulator is a bit dodgy so will go for less CO2 next time.  The thing is, when I tried the beer after the foam settled the flavour was completely different - very astringent, almost plastic-like, flavour. This is the first time I've use the lines and the CO2 cannister.  What could the off-flavour be caused by? Could it be bad gas? Or bad lines (heat-resistant PVC, only about 30cm long)? Would chlorine in the water be doing something bad with the CO2? Or just the fact that it's over-carbonated so there's excess carbonic acid?  Also, is there any way to resolve the situation? I guess just periodically release the CO2 from the head space to solve the over-carbonation issue, but is that also likely to resolve the flavour issue?  Thanks "
1744,"Does cider in oak barrel need airlock during secondary fermentation, for the gas to escape?","I have 200 litres of cider which was racked yesterday into 2 x 100 litre oak barrels. Before racking, the cider was still fermenting at a rate of about one bubble (through the airlock) per two minutes. This was due to cool weather here since October and the recent addition of a heater to the brewing room about a week ago.  Both barrels have been stoppered with a cork bung with no airlock.  Can anyone tell me if this is safe? Will the CO2 be able to escape through the barrel without an airlock at this rate? Likely to be pretty vigorous at first due to the air mixed in while racking.  Also any thoughts on the taste - will the oak taste be way too strong if I leave it maturing until say, April? "
1745,When to stop the whirlpool pump in an immersion whirlpool chiller?,What is the best temperature to stop the pump in an immersion whirlpool chiller ? And what about the time to wait the trub settling vs wort temperature ?  Consider both Ale and Lager. 
1746,Should the Munich Water Profile be used for Bavarian Hefeweizens?,"I'm having trouble searching for the correct water profile to be used for a Bavarian hefeweizen.  In the book Designing Great Beers by Ray Daniels,      Munich -- or more properly, Bavaria -- ... has the most cohesive history of weisse beer brewing of any area in Germany.   (pg 339)   Oddly, the author doesn't include any water profile in his wheat beer section, even though he does so for the other styles as far as I can tell (I haven't finished it yet).  In his Bock section, he includes the water profile of Munich's water:   Calcium - 75ppm Magnesium - 18 Sodium - 2 Carbonate - 180 Sulfate - 120   Is it appropriate for me to conclude that Munich's/Bavaria's water is that which I should use to make a bavarian hefeweizen?  Incidentally, the author states:     [Shifts] in zymo-demographics in Europe, along with the craft beer revolution in America, have shaped a wheat beer landscape that is quite different in the late twentieth century than it was even ten years earlier. (pg. 343)   I can't find the page right now, but he also states that back in the old days, wheat beers in Germany were made with only 1/3 wheat and 2/3 barely, which is nearly the opposite today.  Would this have any effect on the water profile? "
1747,"Zymurgy, Oenology ... but what about spirits? What's the ""ten penny"" word for still masters?",This is just a question about terminology.  Those who are into brewing and beer making are zymurgists.  Those who are aficionados of wine are oenologists.  But what does one call a expert in distilling spirits ... an whiskey/bourbon/scotch spirits in particular?  Are there different terms for those who are masters at crafting these (stillmasters?) vs. those who have the expertise for judging and describing them?  I'm curious ... but I'd also like to know soon since I'm going to an annual scotch tasting party in my area. 
1748,how long can I stay in an open primary fermentation?,"I would like to go from the primary fermentation to the bottles with an open fermentation.  Can I top off with water to get the full 5 gallons?  Also would you primary an open fermentation for more than a week, and not secondary?  It's a double ipa. "
1749,How does the fermentation schedule look when adding flavor elements?,"Is there a guide for when &amp; how to add specific ingredients to the fermentation process?  For example, if I want honey, lemon, ginger, banana, raspberry, etc. - when's the best time to add that ingredient? "
1750,Would placing the fermenter tank in a tub of water be a good way to handle hot environments?,"Summers where I live typically have 80F nights and it can easily pick up to 95 degrees during the day.  I have a plastic trash can (which I bought for this purpose) that I have filled up with water. Currently, my apartment measures 79F, but measuring the water in the trashcan gives me 70F.   1) Can I just place my fermentation tank in this tub of water to counter the heat? An employee at a local brew shop said no, the temperature of the water will just be room temperature. However, it is currently reading 9F below room temperature...  2)Will this method work during the summer, when I have a 90-95F day?  3) Will bacteria that collects in the bucket of water be a greater threat to my vodka-filled airlock than the bacteria that collects in my closet, where my fermentation tank is currently stored?  Thank you! "
1751,Does kegging require a fridge,I was planning on building myself one of these for the summer: [website]I currently bottle all my beer and don't own any kegging equipment.  Will I be able to do this without buying a second fridge?   In other words can kegged beer be stored in room temperature and then cooled down a night or so before serving? I don't have room in my fridge to keep the kegs there constantly. 
1752,Keg Management Systems,"I'm looking for a way to keep track of the state of my kegs - how many times were they washed with a caustic cleaner since the last acid cleaning, how long ago was it cleaned (and pressurized), what beer is in it (and for how long?), things like that.  Post-its work for a couple of kegs, but I'd like something more robust and slightly more scalable (a dozen kegs, perhaps).  Some of the software solutions I've found by googling look like they could work, but appear to be geared towards professionals and super complicated (and expensive).  Are there any existing, simple (and preferably cheap) solutions? "
1753,How much Potassium (or sodium) metabisulfite to remove chloramine?,"I have a small jar of powdered Potassium Metabisulfite and Campden tablets that are Sodium Metabisulfite. The tablets are 550mg. I have seen on this forum that these chemicals, when added to your brewing water, dechlorinate and remove chloramine. But how much? I have seen that one tablet does 20 gal but I have to imagine that one tablet's mg content can vary. The Potassium is in powder form, how much of that ought to be used? I am an all grain brewer and I brew 5 gal batches starting with about 7-8 gal. My question: If I used the Potassium, how much should I use? If I used the campden tablet (550mg), should I use a whole tablet or half?  I do realize that this has been answered (sorta), but I need more specifics.   Thanks. "
1754,SG and OG quite different to values indicated on can label,"very quick question: making a kit brew (Coopers Real Ale), which says a typical OG is 1.046 and FG is 1.006. Unfortunately, my OG was 1.038, and my current reading (after about 17 days) is 1.013, and holding (for the past 4 days). Been fermenting at a pretty consistent 20C (with one drop to about 17C for a few hours) and once or twice popping to 22C. I was pretty vigorous with how I mixed the wort initially - I shook and shook the fermenter. If anything, I'm worried I overdid it, because there was a lot of foam etc. (Is this normal? Did I mess up?)  Anyway, how concerned should I be by the unexpected gravity readings? With a higher FG like this, should I wait longer, or bottle? (Concerned about it continuing to ferment, and then bottling, causing bottle bombs... am I mistaken?)  EDIT: OG taken at 26C, latest gravity at 19C. (I did adjustments using online calculators, and they don't seem to make much difference...?)  EDIT #2: thanks for all the help everyone! I can only conclude now that a) I've been using the hydrometer correction calculation incorrectly (not knowing what the hydrometer is calibrated to) b) I somehow added more water??? (this one worries me though, because I was very precise according to the markings on the carboy - I'm now wondering whether the carboy, which I got from a local DIY brew shop, was incorrectly marked?) c) I stalled the yeast a little (although again, the temperature drop happened in the middle of the fermentation, and there was definitely further activity and SG drop for a few days afterwards?)  So, I'm going to go ahead and bottle now this morning. Holding thumbs! :) "
1755,My first Porter. Should I add any calcium chloride chalk to my bottled water before mashing?,"Hey brand new here on SE, but have been brewing all grain for about 5 batches now, mostly pale and amber ales. Going to brew my first Porter tonight, following Biermuncher's Black Pearl Porter recipe.   I've always used crystal geyser bottled water, but (considering it's a dark beer) should I add calcium chloride chalk?   If so, how much for 5 gallons and when do I add it?   Where can I find a water report for Crystal Geyser bottled water?  EDIT: Fixed a mis-wording. Added bold text.  "
1756,Storing home brew,I was wondering if I could store my finished home brew in a fermenting bucket that has a spout on the side. Of course not the same one it was fermented in but a clean one. Will it hold its carbonation? Was thinking might be simalor to a 2 l. pop bottle? 
1757,Oh... my back... (how do I brew with less heavy lifting?),"I've always brewed with my brewster girlfriend around to help but even then I still find that I do the majority of the lifting. Moving into this time of year I know she's going to be less available to help, so I need some tips to save my back.  I brew full boils of wort, as much as 7 gallons, outside on a propane burner. My main problem areas are:   Transporting a full pot from my kitchen (mashing) area to the burner outside. Moving from the burner into my cooling bath after the boil.  Dumping the finished and cooled wort into primary through my strainer.    How do you 'lighten the load' on brew days? Any suggestions as to how I might lighten those three tasks? "
1758,How to prevent solventy/overly alcoholic flavors?,"I'm a moderately experienced homebrewer, and recently I've been making a lot of imperial stouts--variations on the same recipe, hoping to dial it in. Decently strong ones: my OG is usually around 1.111, and I finish between 1.030 and 1.037 (I'm aiming for a sweeter stout, so that's fine). I pitch 2 rehydrated packs of Safale S-04 (new) per 5 gallon batch. I primary until it's done fermenting actively, transfer to a keg for secondary, and let it age for 1-2 months before crashing in the cooler.  However, I have a persistent alcoholic/solventy flavor when I first try the beers. This has happened 3 times now. Really hits you in the back of the nose when you sip/inhale over the beer. The rest of the flavors are fine; no weird yeast making nasty tastes.  I know that this is typically a fermentation temperature issue, but the odd thing is that, if anything, most of these beers ferment a little low (I have a poorly heated room for fermentation in the winter, so even with a water bath, the temps tend to stick between 58F and 63F).  What could be causing these alcoholic/solventy flavors? Should I lower the primary temperature still more?  Also, I've been taking the beer out of the water bath when it's done with primary and letting it secondary in the air. This might lead the temperatures to get somewhat higher during the days (though never more to 70F, and typically not for more than an hour or two). Could this be when/where the off flavor develops?  Could this be a symptom of stressed yeast? Should I pitch more/re-pitch during fermentation? Alternatively, is this a typical ""young beer"" problem with strong stouts, and one that will fade with time? "
1759,Expected Hydrometer Reading for White House Honey Ale?,"A bit of background:   This is my second beer batch. My first beer batch turned out well as an Irish Stout, using the Midwest Brewing kit and recipie   I just started a White House Honey Ale I'm currently brewing a White House Honey Ale using this kit. I started this brew a week ago, 4/21, and opened it up for the first time today.  I used dry yeast per the recipe. I have the following observations and questions:   There is no layer of krausen on the top of the fermenter. Is this normal/expected in some cases? Because of this, should I re-pitch yeast into the primary fermentation? My original gravity reading prior to fermentation was 1.020. The recipe sheet mentions  an SG of 1.058-1.060 - so was something wrong to begin with with this batch of beer? The reading on my hydrometer today is 1.010, which is within the range of the  expected final gravity on the recipe sheet.    The big question. Based on this evidence, my first inclination is to say that fermentation did happen, and I should move the beer into a carboy for further fermentation. Is this what you would recommend in this sitauation, or would you suggest a different course of action?  A final note: in both the Irish stout and this batch of beer, I didnt see any bubbling in the airlock. From what I've searched on this website, this may be ""normal"" as some of the 5 gallon food grade containers or seals dont have very good seals, so my first impression is that fermentation probably did happen, I just dont see the fermentation because i'm dealing with leaky equipment.   Any advice is greatly appreciated! "
1760,What is the benefit of long fermentations/leaving beer on yeast for weeks?,"I know the 'general' answers:  ""it allows the yeast to 'clean up' compounds"", ""it allows the beer to 'condition'"", ""it allows the flavors to come together"", none of which I am satisfied with.    My question is: given proper-to-over pitch rates, cold-pitching (to minimize acetaldehyde/diacetyl production and precursors), and careful monitoring of fermentation temperature, is there any practical reason that homebrewers cannot turn beers around quickly, like in a commercial brewery?  Is it diastatic pressure?    For instance, I made a California Common last fall, and was just below a lager pitch rate for a 5G batch.  Pitched at 60*, fermented there for 4 days, fermented 4 more days raising up slowly (2-3*/day) to 70*, cold-crashed for 12 hours, gelatin, racked, quick-carbed and served.  And it was great.    I'm not saying I didn't get lucky on the above-batch, but for any beer below say 6% alcohol, I would love some information on what is happening to the beer after FG is reached.   "
1761,How little light can spoil a beer?,I build a fermentation chamber that has a small computer fan that is equipped with tiny blue led lights. Is it only UV light that can skunk a beer? What would the effect of this frequently run fan light be? 
1762,"Well carbonated, but no head","I've tried looking for duplicates to this question, but can't quite find a single question that covers it, so here goes (pls let me know if I've missed one)  Last night I tasted the first bottle of my first ever homebrew! It was just an extract kit (Coopers Real Ale), and I was quite pleased by it. The only thing that surprised me was the complete lack of head when I poured the beer. The beer was carbonated, at least reasonably I thought, and tasted good (I think), so at the moment all I can think of is that the glass was the problem. (Brand new beer glasses, but washed in the dishwasher.... could the rinse aid be the culprit?) I only bottled a week ago (so 6 days conditioning before I opened), but like I say, the carbonation seemed good to me.   Is there something else that might have caused this?  EDIT: Thanks for the advice so far, going to wait a little longer and see if further conditioning sorts me out... Bottle #2: cleaned a glass by hand, and bottle had an extra 2 days conditioning, and I may have ""cheated"" and poured a little more vigorously :) Muuuuch better head, not much retention, but certainly no worse than the local mass-produced lagers. Holding thumbs for bottle #3... "
1763,How to make more beer than I can boil?,"I will soon need to buy some more equipment, but I want to think it a little bit what I really need to buy and in the meantime I will try some workaround.  I was thinking of brewing mash/extract recipes, so my idea was (for a 1.050OG beer, 10l volume):   Mash at a ""normal"" OG around 1.050s Boil th wort for 45 minutes (5l of wort more or less) Add the malt extract for the last 15 minutes (to achieve almost double gravity, let's say 1.100) Dilute high gravity wort with 5 more liters to get final volume of 10 litres.   Bitterness extraction could be different (but I will assume effect is negligible).  My real question is, will it be a bad idea to mix malt extract toward the end of the boil? Will I get bad flavors from shortly boiled extract?  Any other possible issue, or maybe a better method for that? "
1764,105 Day Fermentation?,"I am half dozen or so batches into my homebrewing ""career"" (Saison du Buff, Jasmine IPA and Midas Touch among my highlights) I found a recipe for a darker saison. I made some modifications (chocolate malt &amp; vanilla bean), but I am confused/nervous about fermentation. Recipe says 105 days in primary, but that seems ABSOLUTELY INSANE to me. I am thinking about going standard 2ish weeks in the bucket then transferring to carboy to ride out the remaining 90ish days. Am I daft for thinking 105 days of primary seems odd? Or should I skip the bucket, go straight into carboy and pitch into it and do the full 105 there? "
1765,Why an Erlenmeyer flask?,"Why is the Erlenmeyer style flask the automatic go to for yeast starters? I know people use other containers besides flasks, and some flasks don't have flat bottoms but is there something special about the shape or angle of the sides? Just thought this was a good question to throw out there and see what comes back! "
1766,Using pine in beer,"I know about spruce, and pine is a really close relative, so it seems legit to me. I was planning to use the brown part in the picture, which has a really nice smell.    I would like some advices:   Can I use it with no health risk? When to put it in boil? I read a recipe suggesting to boil it 60 minutes, what bout boiling it for 15 or 30 minutes?  "
1767,Can you mash for too long?,"I'm looking at brewing an all-grain barley wine in the near future, and I'm aiming for a high ABV (13%-14% ABV).  From what I've heard in discussions elsewhere, by single-infusion mashing at a lower temperature (I'm shooting for 148 for about 90 minutes), I am extracting more fermentable sugars and achieving a dryer taste (both of which I want for this style ale).  What are the less than desirable qualities in a barley wine that I will suffer as a consequence for mashing at the lower end of the scale?  I'm mashing for 90 minutes instead of the typical 60 to try and guarantee I get the pre-boil gravity I'd like, but is 90 minutes excessive?  Is there such a thing as mashing for too long?  What are the consequences of mashing for ""too long"" (however long that may be)? "
1768,How much heat can a demijohn take?,"I'm planning to serve some homemade cider, hot and mulled at a market stall in the coming weeks. I'll be siphoning out of a 23L demijohn (like this: [website]The plan is to heat the cider in a big pot to the right temperature (say, 70C), pour a little into the demi to let it adjust, then fill it up. I might need some sort of heat source to keep it warm, but I won't have power. I'm thinking about a very low gas flame with a lot of diffusion (fine metal screens) underneath the demi. Then again, 20L of hot liquid stays hot a long time, maybe I won't need to worry.  Am I mental? Am I going to explode the demi? We clean them with a hot-water pressure cleaner, and they're fine, but I wonder about having them full of hot liquid. Last thing I need is 23L of scalding cider exploding everywhere on the night. "
1769,What about grain storage?,I recently cleaned up after brewing one day and realized that I threw away a couple of four gallon water jugs. Could these be used for storing grain for long term? Would the air in the container affect my grain over time? If these can be used for storage I can save the money I wanted to spend on feed containers. 
1770,"Dropped the temperature as it was getting out of control, did I shock my yeast?","Making an IPA with an OG of 1.069, we pitched at 70°F with good ol' Safale US-05, just dry out of the packet as I've always done with US-05 with good success (I tend to trust it a little too much perhaps). Should have rehydrated probably, but eh, the yeasties got into the bucket. This is my 6th brew so by no means am I an expert.  Day 1 was fine: no activity until the afternoon (T+18h) when it started bubbling lightly as expected.  Night of Day 1 (T+24h - 36h) my roommate (who I brew with and should know better ;)) turned off the A/C in the apartment, so ambient temps rose to about 76°. I checked the temp and the fermenter reached 81°... yikes (IR thermometer and stuck-to-side-of-fermenter thermometer agreed). Bubbler was still going crazy at about 1/second, so I'm guessing that fermentation just took off overnight.  I didn't want the temps up there, so I made a water bath in a rubbermaid bin, with about 68° water, and stuck the fermenter in (submerged about halfway up the bucket). Temps equalized very slowly over about 6 hours and finally stabilized at 72°, which to me seems perfect for this yeast, still even a little high but (I hope) better than it was.  Day 3 and 4 now bubbling slowed and then stopped completely. I haven't opened the lid to check krausen or take a gravity reading yet.  Questions in convenient numbered form:   Could dropping the temperature from that 80° point down to 72° in about 6 hours have ""shocked"" the yeast in some way? Is this just the US-05 going through all the sugars in one night like the good little workhorse it is? Only a gravity reading will tell... Would it be worth re-pitching in case something bad did happen?   Any insights/advice here would be much appreciated!  Obviously going to place the next batch in a water bath from the get go to try to keep things more stable, especially as the summer approaches. "
1771,Effects of sugar before bottling,"I've just finished my second batch of beer and am about to bottle it. I'm already happy with both ABV and how it tastes. Carbonation's not a big deal to me and it's already a tiny bit fizzy anyway, so my questions are as follows:   Do I really need to add sugar before bottling? Will it be completely flat if I don't? How much will 30g of regular sugar in 18L affect the flavour and ABV?   Cheers. "
1772,Unusual flavourings,"What are some of the weirder (successful) flavourings you have tried in your beers, and at what point would you normally add these extras?  It occurred to me the other day that basil or even rocket (arugula?) might be interesting in small amounts, but I wouldn't know at which stage to throw them in, or even what constitutes a ""small"" amount. "
1773,Fruit Flies in Airlock. How can I Test if Mead is Okay?,"In short After approximately 5.5 month my airlock full of vodka has lost 60% of its volume and now has trapped a couple dozen of fruit flies.  Should I be concerned for my batch of Mead?  What methods can I use to test the mead (taste and smell)? Is this common and preventable?   In depth  Last November 25th I started my first 5-gallon batch of Joes Ancient Orange Mead following the recipe here: [website]I believe everything went well. The airlock was furiously bubbling for a time and continued to bubble for many days after. However, after the initial few days I added more water to the carboy (as described in the directions) and believe I may have damaged the airlock. I cannot say how as the airlock appeared to still work though I did hear a loud pop when I returned it to the bung/stopper.   As directed I did not touch the carboy for months. My aim has been to wait six months (which will be in 14 days) before attempting to bottle (regardless the fruit still has not dropped, but that is another matter). In the last week I noticed a discoloration of the air lock. I have caught some fruit flies!       "
1774,Filtering BIAB wort,"I have recently started BIAB, and my wort is very cloudy after the boil. Much ""cloud material"" ends up in the fermentor, since it takes really long to settle and is easily stirred. It mostly looks like flour, and is present even without hops (I have tested).  Question: Is it OK to filter the wort after chilling, or will I remove some important stuff? (I could also filter just the last part.)  Will Irish Moss or WhirFloc help with this problem? "
1775,Isinglass and temperature,The wine kit that I am making uses isinglass for fining and recommends storing the wine at 70 degrees during the process. In the past I've used gelatin in my beers to clear and I know that it works better when stored cold. Does this hold true for isinglass? Or should I still store the recommended 70 degrees? 
1776,"The ""correct"" step to add cinnamon and vanilla?","I want to experiment a bit by adding spices - I'm thinking cinnamon and vanilla - to my beer, but wonder at which step is considered the best time to add it.  Personal experience is very welcome.  I assume adding it during mashing is out...  I guess the obvious time would be during the boil (in ""tea""-bags?) - but early or late?  Or is it better to do it after the boil - during ""mixing"" - just to let the spices soak?  (I guess it's a bad idea to leave spices in during (1st) fermentation...)  Or is it best to wait until 2nd fermentation, using the step pretty much just to add the spices?  Or should I perhaps make an extract or tea with warm/boiling water, or an infusion in alcohol (vodka)... if so, how - and when should I add this extract?  Will one extract more ""taste"" and the other more aroma (smell)?  Will one be stronger and the other subtler?  Will one be more ""in your face"" and the other more mellowed/aged?  I'm thinking about using cinnamon-bark and vanilla-""sticks"" (dried fruits).  I'll probably add some honey (during the boil(?)) too...  PS:  Should I leave the vanilla-""stick"" whole, or do what one often do in cooking - split it lengthwise and scrape out the seeds inside, before putting it all (seeds and split ""stick"") into what I want to set taste too?  The seeds are tiny black ""dots"" - and it probably won't be that many of them in the whole batch - but still, it's perhaps nothing you want to see in your beer (looks just delicious in hot chocolate though ;-)... "
1777,why do we try to get rid of sediment?,"A brief question, I will add details tomorrow. I am fermenting fruit wines in the pet-Nat style. I find the yeast and yeast activity in wines exciting, full bodied, healthy and invigorating. Drinking a living yeasty young wine full of frizzante and nourishment leaves me wondering if our fine wines aren't  industrial beverages for a modern audience, succumbed to some oversanitised, glassy, idealized version of what wine should be.  My question is simple. Why do we get rid of the yeast and sediment? Why? "
1778,how does light affects yeasts,"according to this research:     Red LED light (630 nm) stimulated cell growth but slightly inhibited   ethanol formation. In contrast, Blue LED light (470 nm) significantly   inhibited cell growth but stimulated ethanol formation.   is it good idea to put our batch under red light exposure for first 3 days and then keep it under blue light for the rest of fermentation?  if that bit of LED light can increase the production of ethanol i guess we can have our batch ready sooner, right?  what if we use red and blue light at the same time? "
1779,Cell growth factors in different types of yeast starter,"Cell growth in a yeast starter is dependent on the volume of starter wort. Palmer states that as a general rule of thumb, a 1 liter starter roughly doubles the cell count while a 3 liter starter about triples it.  Other than the fact that Zainashef cites  slightly different figures, I believe that Palmer's rule is an oversimplification. The Mr. Malty calculator distinguishes between a simple starter, an oxygenated simple starter, an intermittently shaken starter, a continuously aerated starter and a stir plate.  However, the tab that selects these options doesn't seem to do anything (at least not on my 'puter). I'm also not sure how Mr. Malty deals with inoculation rates.  So. Are there comparative growth factor estimates available that compare the above starters? And what about reliable growth-vs-volume graphs?  Any pointers in the right direction would be appreciated! "
1780,"Beer has off flavor, sample taken while bottling tasted good","I brewed an IPA about 3 weeks ago. Everything went fine during fermentation and I've dropped a couple of hop pellets 4 days before bottling into the fermenter as I planned to do.  When bottling everything went fine and I took a sample to measure the FG (with priming sugar, forgot to take it before).  I've put the sample into the fridge (after measuring the FG) and drank it after 3 days, it tasted good! I decided to put a couple of bottles into the fridge, and when taking them out of the closet they were in I saw the following ""dust"" swimming inside the beer (picture at the end of post).  When tasting the beer it lost its juicy taste that the sample had and it looks a bit darker. From my experience I would say it has this ""old"" IPA taste and sugary/caramel smell.  I've put the beer into a closet for 4 5 days once bottled, temperature was maybe a bit high (probably reached 80°F at some point).  My question is: Why did the sample tasted great and the actual beer not as good? Was the room temperature too high? Did I leave too much air in the bottles? Does it have anything to do with this ""dust"" in suspension?  Hope some of you can help me understand what I did wrong. My other all grain beers went fine but I didn't do any dry hop.   "
1781,"""Debugging"" a bitter DDH NEIPA","I brewed a DDH NEIPA recently and it was a great learning experience.  I got the aromatics I was looking for but the flavor was bitter. The batch was bound to be wonky because of size limitations because I could only brew a 3-gallon batch on a stovetop. The final beer was SUPER cloudy and had some sediment in it and when bottling a lot ended up settling out of the beer.  Primary fermentation was at 72°F then down to 68-66°F then sat at 64-62°F during dry hopping. This was all done in a cool midwest basement with low humidity.   Overall the beer wasn't quite a NEIPA, not really juicy and had sediment.  My question is what variables should I tweak to produce a better result, with less bitterness and smoother body, on my second attempt?    Recipe Details:  BREW INFO:  Brew Method: BIAB  Batch Size: 3 gallons (ending kettle volume)  Boil Size: 3 gallons  Boil Gravity: 1.060  Efficiency: 65% (ending kettle)  YEAST:  Wyeast - London Ale III 1318  Starter: No  Form: Liquid  FERMENTABLES:  6 lb - American - Pale Ale  0.6 lb - Flaked Wheat  0.6 lb - Flaked Oats  0.4375 lb - American Carapils  HOPS:  El Dorado [15.7% AA]  Citra [11% AA]  Galaxy [14.25% AA]  BOIL:  Mashed at 149°F for 60 minutes  HOPS SCHEDULE:  FWH 0.15 oz  El Dorado, Citra, Galaxy   40 minutes whirlpool 0.2 oz  El Dorado, Citra, Galaxy   20 minutes whirlpool 0.45 oz  El Dorado, Citra, Galaxy    20 minutes whirlpool is shut off 0.6 oz  El Dorado, Citra, Galaxy    DH for 8 days with 0.65 oz El Dorado, Citra, Galaxy  DH for 4 days with 1 oz El Dorado, Citra, Galaxy    List of Possible Pain Points   Efficiency miscalculated The total amount of hops was too high Dry hopped for too long Too much yeast for the batch size Hops scaled incorrectly (should I have used the total AA% to scale?) Lack of a cold crash Grain bill was miscalculated FWH could have been too low/high Get a finer mesh hop bag (I had the white one from Northern Brewer) Split hops into smaller bags per variety   These are just the issues I've drawn up/done some research on but I'm not too sure what the main culprit could be. "
1782,How to compensate for fermentation heat?,"My current method of fermentation temperature management is submerging my carboy into a large bucket of water. I regulate the temperature of my water with ice packs/frozen water bottles to keep it at the desired temperature. I use a pretty large volume of water so temperature fluctuations are minimal, maybe a degree or two over 24 hours.   My concern is that I am setting the temperature of the water to the desired fermentation temperature but the actual temperature inside the carboy is somewhat higher.   My question(s) are,  First, what is the best way to get an accurate temperature of a fermenting wort? I have read some responses to the question How many degrees will my carboy heat up as a result of fermentation activity? and after further research am uncertain that a stick on thermometer will do the job since it is positioned on the glass and likely to be affected by outside temperatures.   Second, is there a way to calculate the appropriate temperature to set the environment, in my case bucket of water but could also be a fridge, to in order to appropriately compensate for the added heat of fermentation? "
1783,How to predict ABV in cider?,"I am new to cider brewing (my first batch has just started fermenting). As I'm new and just want to trial the process before getting into something more involved, I used store bought juice (no additives etc).  I got myself a hydrometer, and have measured the OG (1.049) and understand that I will need to measure the FG to calculate the final ABV.   My question is this: if I need the FG to calculate the ABV, how does one predict the final outcome? Is the OG any indication of where you'll end up?   I didn't add any sugar to my batch, so worried the ABV might be too low?   Also, when I start my second batch, I'd like to aim for around 10%, so unsure how to work out how much sugar I should add to reach that volume.   Thanks in advance! "
1784,Secondary racking for store bought apple juice,"New to home brewing, and have started out with some cider. I've started out with just store bought apple juice, 4l of which is now fermenting in a demijohn.  Is secondary racking required for this? My understanding is that secondary racking is to remove lees, but as I'm using store bought juice from a carton (no additives), shouldn't I be able to skip secondary racking? Or is there something I'm missing?  Thanks in advance! "
1785,Airlock sucking inward,"I've made three demijohns of elderflower wine, and after fermentation stopped and I racked the wine, then all three demijohns started sucking in the liquid which is in the airlock. We have had some unusually hot weather here in the UK, and I believe the reason for this negative pressure in the demijohn is due to the cooling down at night. Not sure.  The liquid I used in the airlock is last year's bad batch of elderflower wine, all freeze-distilled. It's a rather strong alcoholic thing. You wouldn't want to drink it, but it has worked well as cleaning fluid or insect-repellent airlock juice before.  Recipe said, to leave the wine in the demijohn for eight weeks after racking. After ten days, When I saw the airlock was getting sucked in, I panicked and then bottled the wine! Is my wine likely to be ruined? Is there a way to tell so soon? "
1786,FG not achieved after two weeks.,"I have brewed a stout intended to be around 6%. After two weeks the FG is 1.024 but expected to be closer to 1.010.   I found when I made the yeast starter (Giga Yeast 011) the yeast clumped and dropped out really quickly, it seemed like the same thing happened very quickly in the fermenter.  Could it be that I need to swirl the yeast regularly in the fermenter? Any other considerations? "
1787,Why not to calculate specific gravity through weight?,"I have read that you can calculate specific gravity by dividing the weight of a known volume of liquid in the weight of a known volume of water.  After reading that I thought about filing my fermenter with 20L(5 gallons) of water and putting them on a scale, then putting my next batch on the same scale, that way I could measure SG as much as I wanted without wasting liquid or risk in contaminating my beer.  My next thought was ""if It's that simple, Why doesn't everyone do it?"" Why isn't this a common practice? What's the down side?  "
1788,Length of fermentation for cider,"Newbie homebrewer working with store bought apple juice for my first test batch.  How long should fermentation take?   About 5 days ago I added my yeast to 4 litres of apple juice, and it looks like the fermentation is already coming to a stop. It has slowed to the odd intermittent bubble. Is fermentation already complete? I was expecting fermentation to take two weeks or so, but has this been impacted by the low volume (only 4 litres)? Also, I added in way too much yeast to begin with: might this have shortened the length of fermentation (ie. burned through the sugar too quickly)?   Thanks in advance. "
1789,Starters for 1500 litre brewing with 100 g of Dry Yeast,What is the possible way to brew batch like 1500 liter with 100 g of yeast ? And how many starter steps need to go and how long will it take to get target pitch rate ?  Thanks all !!  P.S I'm new member !! 
1790,What happens to artificial sweeteners in wine?,"It's basic knowledge that alcoholic beverages are made by letting the yeast eat sugar and poop out alcoholic and carbon-dioxide, in a process known as fermentation. And since sugar only means sucrose, glucose, maltose and similar organic chemicals, it is a no-brainer that artificial sweeteners won't work.  This is why I had an idea. Since I'm an amateur who lacks professional brewing equipment, I cannot always be certain that the yeast is really dead after I pasteurize my wines. So adding sugar post-fermentation to the wine isn't very smart, since if I botched the pasteurization and failed to kill the yeast, I may trigger fermentation again. So I thought - why not add artificial sweeteners PRIOR to fermentation (in addition to the normal sugar, off course)? If the artificial sweetener is unfermentable, it'll work, right?  The sweetener I had in mind was Süssina's artificial sweetener, whose chemical composition is:   Maltodextrin Sodium saccharinate Sodium cyclamate Sodium bicarbonate Monosodium citrate   The question is, will adding all this to the wine prior to fermentation prevent/hijack fermentation? After all, all this sodium... But what about adding it post-fermentation? Are these chemicals unfermentable? "
1791,After a week of secondary fermentation of my wine yeast sediment already formed in the carboys. Does it mean I should rack it again soon?,This is my first brew ever so I'm still learning. I've got two gallons of elderflower wine bubbling now in the carboys for about a week (transferred there after a week long primary in a bucket).   I've noticed that the carboys already formed a couple milimeters of that goopy yeast sediment on the bottom. I've heard that it can introduce some funky flavours into my brew. How worried should I be about that? Should I aim to rack it again to rid of that bottom-yeast? 
1792,How to store sugar wort?,Do you guys have best plan to store longer for sugar wort to propagate yeast ? I usually take wort after boiling step during brewing and stored at 5 C inside 20 liter container. Or Boil with DME for starter ? 
1793,Acidic Wort Affect on Immersion Chiller and Flavor,"I am looking into building a copper immersion chiller for use on my next batch of beer. I plan on doing a sour ale. Will the low PH of the wort have any negative affect on the chiller? Will it cause the metal to leech extra particles, possibly causing off flavors?  "
1794,Backsweetening cider and carbonation drops,"I just completed my first batch of hard cider. I was told to backsweeten it, which I did with Erythritol to taste about 3 weeks ago. then to put carbonation drops in each bottle before adding the backsweetened cider. I'm using Grolsch bottles. Was I wrong to both backsweeten and add carbonation drops?? Did I ruin one gallon of cider? "
1795,Total Yeast Cell Count,"I will give two examples of yeast cell count. First one is 0.34 B cells/ml in 6 liters of wort starter with just a few amount of slurry cake. 2nd one is 1.46 B cells/ml in 1 liter of starter including Wort+Slurry.  So when it comes to total number of yeast cell calculation,do i need to multiply yeast count with 6 liters of wort or a thin layer of slurry which is 300 ml ??  So total yeast count is 2040 billion cells in 6 liters or 102 billion cells in 300 ml of yeast slurry ??  Thanks!! "
1796,How to increase thickness in beer?,"I've found myself becoming quite fond of ""thick"" and ""juicy"" IPAs and DIPAs. Beers with a viscosity to them that feels somewhat syrupy and leaving a great mouthfeel when drunk.  I want to brew my own recipes which turn out with this thickness to them. So my question is:   What techniques are there to brewing thick beers?  Does it come down to the malt bill, the ratio of grist to water in the mash, the hops, boil time, adding lactose or some other additive? Do they all affect it? "
1797,Unfermented Wine - What to do?,"I had a real problem with this years Zinfandel.  It got delivered at 29 brix which I think is the source of the problem.  I added 13% water to try to get it down around 25 brix at the 72 hour mark after pitching yeast on day one.  It fermented its way down to 2 brix.  I tried 3-4 different yeast starters (apple juice, highly effective yeasts, space heaters, etc) to get it down to fully dry, but none of it worked.  Now it's 9 months later after fermentation and I have a lot of 2 brix wine.  It is very sweet to the taste.  I don't have access to other dry wine to blend with in this quantity.  So what should I do? Are there any other products I could try to alter this into?  Port? Sherry?  Does anybody have any experience in really under-fermented wine?  I would love to hear what you did and how it turned out.  Thanks!  Further Information The comments below were asking about my yeast selection.  So here's more info.  Initially, I used a blend of BM45 and BDX yeast.  Towards the end of fermentation, when it was really slowing down.  I did my first yeast starter.  I used 60g of Uvaferm 43 and followed this eckraus tutorial.  Basically, I took a small amount of must, added water and sugar, and poured them in the main jugs after 24 hours.    After that didn't work, a couple weeks later, I did another yeast starter.  I pitched another 60g of Uvaferm 43 into 1 gallon of store-bought apple juice and added and additional 30% water.  At the 12 hour mark. I added another 30% of the wine.  Then at the 24 hour mark, I added all that back into the main jugs of wine.  None of that worked.  You can read the whole story on my journal blog here.  It's now 9 months later and I need to bottle soon.  Can I still do a yeast restart?  Any reason to think that doing it again would work on the third try? "
1798,What yeast should I use to make a semi-sweet Ginger Beer with about 5% ABV,"I want to make a semi-sweet (a little less sweet than Crabbies) ginger beer that is about 4.5 to 5.0% alcohol, and my plan was that in the end, I want it to be between 1.020 and 1.025 s.g..  Therefore I would add sugars to the ""wort"" till I have a specific gravity of about 1.055 or 1.060 depending what the limit of alcohol tolerance for the yeast is.  Is there a yeast I could use that stops fermenting by 5.0% so that I don't end up with ""bottle bombs""?  Or is there a better way to accomplish this? "
1799,What is necessary to keep yeast happy and healthy?,"If you take left over yeast from a wash and dump it in new mash, and repeat, eventually the yeast stop reproducing due to extensive budding scars. So after 4-12 batches people buy new yeast... if not right away. But I was just thinking, why is that so different from sour dough? Bakers can keep thier yeast alive indefinitely by feeding them flour when they are hungry. And if you think about it logically yeast have to be able to reproduce indefinitely, otherwise there wouldn't be any yeast. They would have gone extinct in weeks if they could only handle several batches.. I think they only excessively reproduce by budding under the harsh circumstances brewing beer. But I wasn't able to find that specific information online, nor what it is about brewing beer specifically that kills them. I'm wondering if they can mitigate budding damage by reproducing normally. And I wonder if to get more out of a line of yeast one could do some simple tricks like instead of tossing them straight from one mash to the next, put them into dough in between? "
1800,Failed primary fementation - repitch?,"Yeast: Mangrove Jack's M44 - US West Coast  Yesterday I brewed an IPA recipe but had a couple of issues when it came to pitching the yeast.  The first was that I could not get the wort temperature below 23.9ºC (75F).  The second was that I cooled the re-hydrated yeast too far, to 19.1ºC (66F), as I expected to get the wort down to 21ºC-ish (70F). When I could not get the wort temperature any lower, after using the chiller for almost an hour, I decided to warm the yeast up slightly to 21-22ºC (70-72F) so I could pitch at a slightly higher than normal temperature. Mistakenly I warmed the yeast far too quick by placing the re-hydrated container of yeast in a saucepan of water on the hob. In the space of 10-15 seconds it warmed from 19.1ºC (66F) to 22.3ºC (72F).  At pitching the temps were: Wort - 23.7ºC (75F) Yeast - 22.3ºC (72F)  18 hours later the bucket appears to be doing nothing. The airlock is inactive and the lid is not even bulging slightly to indicate a build up of pressure. I have ordered another sachet of M44 yeast which will hopefully arrive tomorrow.  Questions:   Is the higher than optimum pitching temperature likely to delay the start of the primary fermentation?   Will the temperature shock of quickly warming the yeast by 3.2ºC (5F) in 10-15 seconds have likely damaged the yeast?   How long should I wait before determining whether I should pitch the additional yeast?   If I pitch another sachet of yeast will there be any effects on the end flavour?   "
1801,"saffron in home brewing - taste, aroma and colour","I'm planning to add some in my mead because we have the best saffron in our country. anyone ever tried to add saffron in their mead, wine or beer during first or second fermentation? i know it can definitely give your drink a nice orange colour but how does it taste like? how about aroma? "
1802,Sodium Percarbonate safety," Suppose I did not adequately rinse the sodium percarbonate solution from my fermenter/bottles. Could this a) make somebody ill or b) affect the flavour of the beer? When I left sodium percarbonate solution in my demijohn to soak for 20 minutes, a residue was left at the bottom (sodium carbonate?) which did not rinse out with water. In the end I resorted to white vinegar to get rid of it. a) Does his sediment pose any threat to health/flavour and b) how can I avoid this nuisance in future? For bonus points, what if I'd used sodium/potassium metabisulfite?  "
1803,How do I batch sparge?,"Currently I'm an extract plus specialty grain brewer.  I want to be an all-grain brewer.  That said, I'm trying to figure out the whole sparging thing.  I know I need more grain to get the same gravity of I batch sparge, but that I'm not in danger of the tannins that continuous sparging has.  I don't really understand what to do specifically for batch sparging.  I know I dump in water and then vorlauf and drain the water, but do I stir up the grain before vorlauf/lautering?  Do I add more water, stir everything up and then let it sit for a while, like a second mash? "
1804,Time It Takes Brett C to Ferment,"So I have this idea where I want to thread a citra-laden Belgian IPA with a pineapple beer fermented with Brett C and Brett C only. Does anyone have any experience using Brett C and can speak to how long it will take to ferment? I know that Brett L and B (in pure lambics) can take 6-10 months to really develop all of the elements of the traditional Brett flavor profile. Is Brett C on the same timeframe? I figure I will leave the Belgian IPA in the fermenter for about 2 months. I'd like to brew them around the same time, so if I give the Brett C pineapple 2 months, will that be long enough to get some tart and funky flavors out of it?  This hasn't been a particularly well written BrewAdvice question, and for that I apologize in advance. I look forward, as always, to the enlightened responses from this community! "
1805,How much water does a wort chiller use?,"I am thinking on buying an immersion chiller and from other threads I've thought of using the post-chiller hot water for cleanup, and I've also heard of using the water (after it starts to cool down) to water the garden.  How much water does a wort chiller use to cool a 5 gallon batch of beer down to pitch temp?  Does any one kind use significantly more/less than the others?    EDIT  Sorry, I worded the question poorly.  I started this question thinking about immersion chillers only, but as I was typing I wanted to open it up to other chiller types.  Based on the answers by Brewchez and Room3, I'm figuring that an immersion chiller takes somewhere around 50 gallons to bring a batch to pitch temp.  What is the approximate water use of Counterflow, Plate, and Whirlpool chillers? "
1806,What to do with a stuck fermentation after 2 days with my first beer kit?,"I am trying my first beer kit after trying wine once before. I picked up a ""Summit Avenue EPA"" clone of Summit EPA from Midwest Supplies.   On Monday I did the 60 minute boil, cooled everthing to about 75 degrees F and pitched the yeast. Took a hydrometer reading and got an adjusted SG of 1.031 which seemed a bit low. I moved the plastic bucket with the lid on and the fermentation lock on into the basement which is usually around 65 degrees. Tuesday I checked on it and saw the lock bubbling happily with a bubble every 2 to 3 seconds. On Wednesday I checked again and there were no bubbles at all in over a minute. I decided to leave it for an extra day and see if it worked itself out. Wednesday night I checked again and saw no bubbles for the 2nd straight day. I decided to move the bucket upstairs into a closet where the temperature is a bit higher.   This morning there are still no bubbles and I'm starting to get worried - is there anything I should do to kick start the fermentation (make a new starter and pitch new yeast?) or should I just let it go for a few more days and see what happens? Also is it bad to take the lid off and get a new hydrometer reading this early in the fermentation process? "
1807,why do you degas wine but not beer?,"After reading this post, I was wondering why have I heard of people degassing wine, but never beer? Does one also need to degas mead? "
1808,How do I propagate my hops?,"I have a couple plants going, but I am ready to get more of the same varieties going in the future. How do I go about getting more plants from the same plants I already have? Can I take a cutting? Can I just bury a fresh bine out to the side? Do I dig up and chop up the rhizome at the end of the season?    Help me get my hop yard going! "
1809,The move from kit brewing to all grain brewing,"I have brewed a few batches of beer using pre-measured kits.  They have turned out great, and have I have enjoyed them.  However, I would like to make the move towards all grain brewing.  Is this a difficult move to make?  Any good advice? "
1810,How much sugar should be used when priming with Brett?,"I've read that Brett will consume sugars that other yeast strains cannot.  Is this true?  I couldn't really find too much information on it.  If this is the case, should I be worried about over carbonating my beer if I only use Brett for bottling?  Do I need to adjust the amount of priming sugar I use or is the amount of additional fermentable sugar negligible when it comes to CO2 production during bottling? "
1811,Sanitizing Second Hand Equipment (plastic fermenters etc),"Would you ever use second hand brewing equipment?   What's the best way of making sure it's absolutely clean?  Ordinarily, for something like this, I'd just buy new (so you know where it's been), or for things like glass bottles (which are hard to find new) I'd soak them in bleach and then use the oven to sanitize them completely.  However I recently won an auction for a bench-top bottle capper, which came with a whole pile of other stuff  like a heat box, and 3x30 litre plastic fermenters.  I was originally just going to throw them away, but now I'm thinking it might be kind of handy to have a couple of extra barrels around for bulk priming etc.   I'm concerned though with how best to make sure they're safe to use given you can't know the history of second hand gear (and I obviously can't use the oven for plastic =).   Is soaking in a strong bleach solution enough to remove pretty much any thing left on the inside? (chemical residue etc) Is there anything else I should try?   Or would I be best to just turf them and buy another fermenter that's new?  Cheers Dave "
1812,Maturation - what does it mean?,"Homebrew recipes often give information along the lines of ""6-8 weeks maturation"". What exactly does maturation mean here in terms of conditions? Is it the same as a secondary? Can the beer ""mature"" on the yeast? Does it have to be bottled/kegged before maturation starts? Is maturation warm or cold or does that depend on the type of beer (i.e. ale or lager)? "
1813,Hop schedule for Single hop ale brewing,"I am planning on brewing up a handful of quasi-pale ales using only a single hop varietal per batch.  The goal is to get a feel for the bittering, flavor and aroma of some varieties I want to understand better. I was thinking of a schedule like this.  60min-35IBU 20min-15IBU 5min-5IBU Dry Hop- (1oz)    I'll figure the IBUs base upon the Alpha content of each variety I plan to use, which is why I didn't list it in ounces.  Except for the dry hop, which will really contirbute no IBUs and why the 5min is so low in IBUs.  I plan to shoot for a 1.048-1.052 OG beer brewed with 90% 2-row, 5% Crystal 60L, and 5% Victory malt.  Here is the question? Should I drop the 5 minute and just go with more dryhop? And should I change the time on the flavor addition? "
1814,Is normal PVC tubing okay for a racking tube?,"I'm having a few issues finding food-grade plastic tubing to use a racking tube.  Is normal clear PVC tubing that you'd get at a hardware store okay for this? (Once it's been sterilized etc of course)  For sterilizing these, is it okay to boil them in the microwave for a few minutes, or is the plastic too soft? "
1815,What's a good session beer to serve cold?,"I made an ordinary bitter a while back and it really brought to light why it's served at cellar temperature.  At 55F, it was a bit malty, with nice hops.  At 45F, it was like seltzer. Very drinkable, but why bother?  My kegerator sits at about 45, and I'd like to have a low-gravity and a mid-gravity ale on tap.  What's a session beer that I can serve cold? "
1816,What is a session beer?,What is the accepted OG and ABV of a session beer? What other qualities does a session beer possess? 
1817,Best beer styles for warm fermentation environment?,"What beer styles tend to work well with a warm (at least 70°F/21°C, possibly up to 90°F/32°C) fermentation environment? In other words, what styles will be best to mask or work with the off-flavors produced? "
1818,Low Cost Conical Fermenter,"I was looking around for some low-cost alternatives to conical fermenters, and I came across inductor tanks.  Has anyone used or heard of someone using these tanks?  Is there any danger/downside to using them (aside from scratching the inside and risking contamination)?    They're made out of medium-density polyethylene, is this the same material ""Ale Pails"" are made of?  For around [tex]600 NB chargers for a 15 gallon stainless). "
1819,Can extract brewing achieve professional results?,I was recently on vacation and I toured a brewpub in the Chicago area.  I was surprised to find out that they are extract brewers.  Is this common practice for small brewpubs?  Would this place a limit on caliber of beer you could produce? 
1820,"Making my first batch, but don't have bottles",I'm making my first batch of beer to try out brewing. The kit I have produces 20 pints but unfortunately I don't have bottles to put the beer into afterwards.  Is there any other way of storing the beer? I will only be storing it for about a month before consuming it.  Could I store them in Glass Clip Lid Jars?  Thanks! 
1821,Safe/practical to leave brew equipment in no-rinse sanitation tub throughout the whole brew?,"I'm brand new to brewing and am just using extract kits.  I got my haircut recently, and it gave me an idea for brewing (!). The barber keeps his scissors in a little trough full of that blue barbicide. Throughout the day, customer after customer, he never cleans or washes the scissors by scrubbing them manually. He puts the scissors into the barbicide every time he's done using them. And when he needs them again, he pulls them out of the barbicide and uses them immediately on the customer.  So I'm wondering if this translates to keeping brew equipment/utensils santized. My extract brews are taking a few hours from start to finish, and I am constantly setting utensils (mash paddles, measuring cups, whatever) down on a clean surface, but then feel the need to re-sanitize them every time I need them again.  So I'm wondering if I can just make a big tub of sanitized solution (I've been using no-rinse Easy Clean), once, at the beginning of my brew session, and then just use it (like the barbicide) to keep my utensils sanitary? That way I can just use them as-is (since its no-rinse) when I need them, and then throw them back into the vat-o-sanitation when I'm done with them (for the moment).  Thoughts? "
1822,Brett aged beer - bottling?,"I brewed an APA last year, and decided to keep a gallon or so aside and pitch some brett into it. 9 months later, I bottled it with a carbination drop, and a week later (I'm impatient OK?) there's still zero carbination. Is there a chance I might need to add a bit of extra yeast to carbonate, or is it that the brett is a bit slower to work with the carbination drop? Any pointers? "
1823,Mashing&Sparging in a single vessel,"My brewing buddy has made a move toward grain brewing with the purchase of a brewing pot equipped with a thermometer, false bottom, and screen in the false bottom with an attached valve.  We can get to a mash temperature, add grain and hold temp with his burner unit if need be.  Do we then drain the wort into a second vessel, batch sparge in the brew kettle, drain it off too and then clean the kettle out and add the liquid back in to boil?  I'm just looking for the most efficient procedure here.  Recommendations? "
1824,"Fermentation Just finished up, does this look right?","This is probably my 10th batch and I've never had an issue with drinkability or infections, so i just want to make sure this is normal. I assume it's just Co2 bubbles, but i am not 100% sure. What else could it be? The Krausen falling maybe? I'd assume it's just bits of yeast and wort proteins or Co2 bubbles. Can anyone confirm this? Does it look insidious?  "
1825,Large drop in specific gravity over 24 hour period,My cider brew (5 gal) has experienced a large drop in its specific gravity readings over a 24 hour period. Yesterday it was measured at 1.05 with the kit recommending bottling at 1.04 or lower. Today I measured the brew and the specific gravity was measured at 1.008. What happened? Should I bottle at this point?  This is my first brew so any info you can give me would be greatly appreciated. 
1826,Brew in a bag with a 4 gallon kettle,"Went to the brew shop and the owner helped me build a recipe for a brew in a bag. He said to steep the grains in 2.5 gallons, then heat up 4.5 gallons and add it to the 2.5 gallons for the boil.  I only have a 4 gallon kettle. Can I just steep in the 2.5 gallons, then add more tap water to fill it up to 4 gallons, and then heat it up for the boil? Then add more water when in the carboy?  Thanks! "
1827,Do I need to use enzymes in making malt whisky?,I have read that when using malted barley the conversion rate of starch to sugar is inefficient.   Is this correct? Are there any advantages to adding additional enzymes like beano? If so what enzymes are recommended.?  
1828,Why do all-grain when you can do BIAB?,"I'm an extract brewer that is going to try a BIAB 5 gallon batch. Reading about BIAB has me wondering why brewers would still do all-grain? Does sparging make that much of a difference?  Also, why do a partial mash and add extract if you have a kettle large enough to steep all the grains?  Ok, last question. Does mashing in the full volume reduce grain efficiency much?  Thanks! "
1829,"Kegging, does the beer need to be clear?","Going to start kegging after many years of bottling beer.  Watching YouTube, a brewer spoke of letting the beer ""clear"" for a few weeks before serving. I assumed he meant that he was cold crashing it prior to serving, but on his video he said that he fermented in only one bucket and used its bottom drain to fill the keg. Isn't it going to be nasty with hops and yeast?  I clear my beer as part of the my process, so, I don't think I'll run into that issue.  I think I'm missing a step here can anyone help fill in the blanks? "
1830,How long can mead store when not temperature controlled?,"I was given 10 gallons of homebrewed mead in a carboy.   It was made by my brother-in-law and his friend almost 10 years ago.   His friend moved away and he's kept the mead in the carboy, in a box (so it's not really exposed to light) for this entire time in his garage.    1) is it safe to drink? 2) if possible, how do I know? (ie what should I look for)  3) is there anything I should do prior to opening the carboy?  Background:    I have homebrewed once, and although I was successful it was done with someone who was experienced.    I inhereted all his equipment along with the mead and I need to decide what to do with this mead (he said it was ~14%abv before I start to organize and clean everything so I can learn from scratch.    "
1831,Should you put entire grain bill through Protein Rest?,"I'm planning a Wheat IPA with 42% malted wheat in the grain bill. Is it normal to do the protein rest on the entire grain bill even if only some of the grains in the bill (i.e. the wheat) benefit from it? Or is it okay or recommended to just do the protein rest on the grains that need it?  I'm doing BIAB and it would save some time if I did the protein rest of just the wheat grain separately in a smaller pot while I bring the remainder of the water up to strike temp for the main mash.  I'm concerned about doing it on the entire grain bill after reading in Mosher's Mastering Homebrew (p. 123):     ""With modern malt, not only are protein rests usually unnecessary, but they can be harmful to beer, breaking up the mid-length proteins the maltster worked so hard to obtain.""   With malted wheat being the exception since:     ""If its long proteins are not broken up in the mash, they clump together and fall out of the beer rather than staying and providing an attractive haze. So, it is beneficial to use a protein rest in any beer with more than about 15% wheat in the grist.""   Recipe for reference:   "
1832,Put the airlock really high could avoid blowing?,"I was thinking about how to improve my fermentation procedure and reach a consistent yield of a full 5 gal of finished product after fermenting in 5 gal corny kegs. Searching on the net I've found this pic, and think: there is a heigth point to put the airlock that could entirely avoid blowing off? The plan was to fill the keg to the brim, link a long hose to an airlock and hang it high. After fermenting I could manage trub losses and keep a full serving keg. That question makes any sense? The diameter of the hose or the keg fittings could add anything to this? "
1833,Hefeweizen head retention,"I know there are lots of questions on this site regarding head retention, but I feel like none of the answers are helpful.  I recently made a hefeweizen. 50% wheat malt, 50% pilser malt with about 13-14 IBUs. The beer turned out great except that it has zero head retention. I get a thin layer of foam that dissipates in 5-10 seconds. I have had this problem in the past and I've tried all the traditional advice but nothing seems to help.   Still, I must be doing something wrong.  Brewing process:   Single infusion mash at 67 C (~152 F). 90 minute boil with all the hops added after 30 minutes. Cooled quickly with my counterflow chiller, takes about 10 minutes. 30 second burst of pure O2 Pitched a 3 liter starter of WLP380. Wort temp at about 13 C (~55 F). Fermented at 15 C (59 F) for one week, then left it for another three weeks at 20 C (68 F) to finish and get rid of the sulphur smell.  Bottled using 7 grams of table sugar per liter wort. The bottles have been at room temperature for four weeks now. They are well carbonated and taste great.   Cleaning:   My kettle, mash tun and all other equipment is soaked in PBW solution for about an hour after each use, then thoroughly rinsed off using hot tap water and a soft brush. I've made sure there's no PBW residue left. My fermenter is also cleaned using PWB, rinsed with tap water, then sanitized with star-san solution. I leave the fermenter filled with star-san at least 30 minutes before transfering the wort. I clean my bottles using PBW too. I soak them for 10 minutes and clean them with a bottle brush. Then I rinse them with water and sanitize with star-san solution. I leave them to dry on a bottle tree. My beer glasses are cleaned by leaving them in PBW solution over night, then cleaned with a dedicated soft brush, rinsed with hot tap water and left to air dry on a rack.   Things I've tried:   Adding a bit of cara foam malt: No visible effect. Ordered a water quality report: My tap water is clean and very low on minerals. Switching to a different brand for my ingredients: No visible effect.   Has anyone here had similar problems in the past? I feel like I'm out of things to try.  So, to sum every thing up:  I get this:    I want this:    How do I get there? "
1834,How to avoid need for sulfites in home winemaking?,"I'm learning about the basics of red wine making from this guide.  I have campden tablets (potassium metabisulfate), but I'm really hoping to avoid using sulfites at all.  Because I'm doing a very small batch for myself, I can afford to put in a little extra effort.  Will boiling my must right after destemming/crushing in a big pot suffice to sanitize the must in place of using sulfites? "
1835,my beer has stopped fermenting,Doing and Irish stout fermantation has stopped after a day or very much slowed down temp change may have caused this? Would putting a heat blanket on the bottom restart it? 
1836,Yeast recommendations for a Märzen without lagering,"I'm looking at a few Märzen recipes, particularly an Avery Kaiser clone. However, I'm not set up to lager—I'm aware of a number of the work arounds to lagering without a refrigerator, e.g., a fan, a bucket, and a towel meet in the swamp... wha? or let's build a swamp cooler. I'm not building a swamp cooler and running it for a month, much less four.  If I sub'd an Ale yeast, any recommendations to get near the target flavors?   Or is there a malty style in the Germanic tradition that could be as good? "
1837,Converting a burner over to NG,"I'm in the process of converting my house from LP to NG and I'd like to have the plumbers run a drop for inside and outside by garage for my burner. Has anyone converted their LP burners to NG?  What should I be considering when setting this up?  I currently have a KAB6 bayou classic.  I have read the Brulosophy article on how he converted his KAB4 to use NG. [website]However, I think using an actual pressure regulator with a diaphragm and spring mechanism would be a safer investment in case my furnace kicks on.  Right now I am having the city run my NG piping and a plumber is coming out to install the lines inside the house so I don't know my gas pressure at this point. "
1838,Not enough yeast for a 20 Litre batch?,"Gday! :) So i have just purchased the coopers real ale malt concentrate as well as a kilo of light malt. I started with 2 litre's of boiled water in my fermentor (after sanitising it with no rinse sanitiser) and added the coopers extract as well as the malt. gave a good stir. I then added filtered cold water to the 20 litre mark and then added boiled water and cold filtered water until i got to 23 litres and the desired temperature range of 28 degrees Celsius. I then added the brewing yeast at 28 degrees. My first question is. Was this too hot too add the yeast and have i shocked/killed it? secondly it only came with 7 grams of yeast, Is this enough for 23 litres of wort? The yeast seemed to disappear when i added it and a yeast'y smell was present. Another question i have is because the fermentor is in my garage, in a few hours it has dropped temperature slowly to around 24-26. So i now have put it in the kitchen hopefully keeping it at that temp. What temp will the yeast stop working? Also with the fermentor valve. I put just filtered water inside it. It wasn't sure if i used no rinse sanitised water or not. Thanks for the help!!!! :) "
1839,Spirit w/ evaporaed alcohol as a beer flavouring addition,"I thought about adding whisky/bourbon/rum/brandy to one of my future porters or stouts. I was thinking about evaporating the alcohol from it first in order to prevent unnecessary ABV increase via heating the spirit to 80C for approx. 2 hours. I have a few doubts regarding this.  Does it even make sense to do so? Will the spirit's taste and aroma be noticeable?  If so, how much should I add? I was thinking somewhere between 0,25 and 0,5 litre for a 10 litre batch, but that's just a wild guess based on zero information from anyone.  If anyone has tried doing that, I'd be grateful for any insight. "
1840,Yeast Question For Imperial Stout Kit With LME,"I just ordered the How To Disappear Completely Imperial Stout kit from Boomchugalug on Amazon.  I am excited so start this one up.  It takes a long time but the idea of making my own imperial stout is very exciting to me.    This will only be my third brew, my others were much quicker.  I have only done a Double IPA and a Coffee Porter, both were LME kits like this one.  So I have read that many people try not to use the mail order yeast that comes with these kits because it could have gotten damaged waiting on the doorstep or in the truck.  And there was a comment on the yeast being used may not have had the length of life to fully ferment all the sugars in this big burly stout.  My plan is to got from chilled wort right into a glass carboy for the duration of its fermentation.  I just got a blow off tube that I plan to use on this brew just in case.  I am concerned about using Safale-5 yeast (which is what I expect to see when the package arrives).  Should I use a little extra?  Perhaps there is a better product to use?  The first taste is at 12 weeks, so I don't want this to go bad.  I bought an extra carboy just for this one.  It will be a nice winter stash if it goes well.  I will be bottle carbonating these after so I need to be sure there is at least enough active yeast at the end to properly, if not slowly carbonate the result.  Thanks for the help and happy brewing! "
1841,BIAB vs mash tun taste test,"I've been reading brulosophy a lot recently and I'm amazed they've not done a BIAB (brew in a bag) vs mash tun test.  It seems to me there's still a question over whether BIAB can ever fully achieve the wonders of a full mash tun system.  But i've never read anywhere where someone has compared side by side?  Also; Given the grainfather and Braumeister are effectively BIAB, it seems to me any issues are resolved these days.  (I've never heard bad things about those two systems!?) "
1842,Save my Ginger Bug!,"I have started my first ginger bug and so far, not so good.  I followed the recipe from Wellness Mama but I'll explain what I personally did to see if I made a mistake.  I boiled a pot of water and soaked a mason jar in it. I then boiled another pot of water and put that aside to cool.  I bought some fresh organic ginger root and tried using a cheese grater. It got mushy so I sliced up the rest of what I needed. I tried to make it small chunks.  When the water was fairly cool (cozy enough for bacteria) I tossed in the ginger, granulated white sugar, and the water. I assumed boiling would get rid of the chlorine etc.  I mixed with a wooden spoon and re-attached the mason lid with a coffee filter instead of the metal top.  I kept the rest of the ginger (I bought waaaay too much) in the fridge, as I figured the bacteria would likely live.  Daily I took some out, cut it up, added 1 tablespoon of ginger and white granulated sugar.  After a few days I started keeping it behind my PS4 as it is on almost all day, and it puts off a good amount of heat.  It's been a week now and I have this: My Ginger Bug  To be honest my daughter was topping it up daily and insisted it was ""all fizzy"" but when I investigated it myself I found it lackluster. I might have had a thin white bubbly film around the edge... But nothing I would call fizzy.  I'm not sure what ""yeasty"" is supposed to smell like... But it smells fairly sweet, like a lemonade. Today there is actually a mild pungi-ness... If that's good, or even a thing?  What could I have done to get better results? Should I start over, should I keep going?  Thanks so much for the input! "
1843,How to clean bottles used for homebrewing few times?,I've used bottles few times to bottle home beer. Recently I've found that inside them there are small spots that remain there even if I rinse them with water.  Should I worry about them? It's safe to put new beer into such bottles?  If it's not safe what is good option to clean those? 
1844,Should I rinse my grapes before crushing?,"I picked about 20 5 gal buckets of grapes and will see little white spiders, earwigs, dust, crushed dry grape leaves, little stems, etc in with the clusters.  Is it recommended to hose these down gently before putting them through the crusher?  Is it important to let them dry off before putting them through the crusher?  The hose water is potable. "
1845,Bottle Bomb Mayhem,"My fiancee and I have taken the massive undertaking of brewing as much beer for our wedding as we can, and it's been a really fun project- thus far. We've brewed numerous batches successfully, yet our most recent batches have caused us a lot of frustration.  We made some delicious pumpkin ales, and stored them in a rubber container, and after a few weeks they started exploding. We were actually moving from one apartment to another, and I guess the commotion built up some pressure in the bottles. In any case, our bottles that had been quiet for 6 weeks started exploding- 1 by 1- 5 of them over the course of as many hours.   We cleaned off the surviving bottles, refrigerated them until they calmed down, and waited a day or two before attempting to degas them. I assume that with all the sediment that we lost in the secondary (aprx. 1 gallon), the standard 5 ounces of priming sugar from our kit was too much for our reduced volume beer. Anyways, I degassed the bottles, (easing out excess gas, then tightening again), and thought the problem was solved.   I then put the old pumpkin beers in a 3 month old bin of octoberfests that had never had a problem. Another pumpkin beer had exploded, covering my Octoberfests. I stupidly waited 48 hours since I was so exhausted from all the other chores of moving, before cleaning up the mess in the rubber container. After rinsing off the surviving pumpkin ales, and the octoberfests, I realized that the caps (custom made- grog tag.com) were beginning to show a bit of rust. Right after finishing cleaning the old bottles, an Octoberfest exploded into oblivion 6 feet away from me. Fortunately, I was fine.... But now I'm trying to figure out how this pumpkin ale chaos has affected my perfectly fine Octoberfests... I assume that my caps had corroded, and in the 48 hours I left them untouched, an infection ocurred that built up the pressure in the Octoberfests.   It's like a zombie appocolypse- my bad beers are now affecting my good ones!   So two questions:  1.) What are your thoughts on my theory about the original cause of the exploding? Using 5 ounces of sugar on 4 gallons of beer before bottling (again, this is due to the reduced volume from the high sediment). Should I use less sugar for the reduced volume? Should I add water to the beer to bring it up to 5 gallons again? For the record, we used the hydrometer and confirmed fermentation was done before bottling.  2.) Are the octoberfests exploding from the pressure increasing in the storage container as they explode one by one? Or are the octoberfests exploding from infection due to rusted caps?   In any case, I created an account here moments after this debacle occured with the octoberfests, and before finishing this post- another exploded in the container. I think I'm tossing this whole batch, for safety. But I don't want this to happen again. Beware of zombies.   Thanks.  "
1846,Noob question here about 1 gallon to 5 gallon brewing,"So Im looking in to starting some one gallon recipes. 5 gallons is just way too much for me. Is it absolutely necessary to get a 1 gal jug or can I just use my 5 gal? I suspect the fermentation process needs the pressure presented for a similarly sized jug but just wanted to check. Im on a tight budget and I would rather be buying ingredients instead of jugs.  Also, should I look for 1 gallon buckets as well for racking in to my secondary or is it just more common to stay in one jug through the whole process when dealing with 1 gal?  Thanks in advance!  Edit: This is for beer brewing but none the less you answered my questions. "
1847,Aerating no chill corny keg fermentors that don't seal,"I'm very interested in ferment in corny-kegs after reading some questions about that here on this stackexchange. I will try it next batch, but there is a question about aeration/no chilling method:  Normally I aerate my wort by splashing it when transfering from my no chill vessels to my fermentors, so I understand that I am mixing my wort to the air and all the microorganisms around when I'm doing that. Before splash I put my yeast in the bottom of the fermentor and the same movement mix them to wort to.  Now I want to No Chill and ferment in the same kegs. Is it possible? How to properly aerate the wort doing this way? I know that I can simple shake the kegs to aerate them, but these kegs don't seal if they're not pressurized. So it will be a big mess to clean if I need to do that way. And a O2 tank is not a possibility for now.  So I want to know if I can:  1) Fill the kegs and seal them with CO2 to No Chill;  2) Pitch my yeast directly in these cornys after chilled, put some CO2 to seal it, shake it to mix the yeast to the wort;  3) Remove the gas in post to hook a hose as a blowoff tube, plug a bicycle pump in my liquid-out disconnect to aerate the wort.  This protocol seems good? There is a better/safer way to do that? It will be better if I use the same HDPE vessels for no chill and splash it to the cornys? A bike pump is better/worse than a aquarium air pump or should I expect similar results? I've been reading a post about aeration and this answer caught my attention. Could I get some good If I use a kitchen mixer to mix the yeast and aerate the wort?  Thanks a lot again. Sorry if it seems to much questions inside just one. "
1848,Airlock and Stopper Rocket,"Brewed up a batch of wort yesterday and it all went well. Good sanitation, quick cool down, and yeast activated. Set up the carboy in a controlled temp room (74) and fermentation started within 4 hours and really took off. All good. Took the wife out for dinner and a movie - when I got home found the airlock and stopper had shot out of the carboy. Consulted this site and hooked up a blow off tube. Everything is going OK now - still bubbling away like mad. I don't know how long the wort was exposed. There was and continues to be a thick head of Krausen.  Does the exposure mean my wort is ruined? How can I tell?  Any advice will be helpful...thanks...Let me know (I'll be painting the ceiling) "
1849,Does bottling conditioning change the nature of the carbonation?,"There's a common opinion that bottle conditioning yields carbonation that is qualitatively different from what's produced by force carbonation. Typically, it is claimed that bottle conditioning produces finer/smaller bubbles, the head lasts longer, the lacing is more prominent etc.  For instance, consider this, from the Thank Heaven For Beer blog.     The beer carbonated ye old naturale method has a thin layer of yeast   on the bottom.  The head is thicker and more billowy with more peaks   and valleys, and it has longer retention with more lacing.  There are   fewer bubbles sticking to the glass (both dishwasher cleaned) and the   bubbles are tinier.  In the mouth, the beer feels smoother than the   force carbonated beer, and more effervescent; perhaps more champagne   like, though both feel as they have the same level of carbonation.    The beer that was carbonated induces more belching.   I've also heard this claim made about Champagne, which is traditionally bottle conditioned, while lower-priced bottles are force carbonated.  My education in chemistry stopped at grade 11, so I could be getting some things fundamentally wrong, but I don't understand how the process by which the CO2 is produced could affect the quality of the carbonation. As I understand it, CO2 exists in equilibrium with water (or beer), mediated by temperature and pressure. The lower the temperature and the higher the pressure, the more CO2 is dissolved (as carbonic acid) in the liquid. Whether the CO2 is produced by yeast consuming sugars, or supplied by a CO2 tank, I can't image that the chemistry is any different.  In the above passage, all the qualities attributed to natural conditioning could also be the result of slightly higher level of carbonation compared with the force carbonated beer.  Is there any truth to these claims about bottling conditioning vs. force carbonation? Or is this an old wive's tale? "
1850,Flotec Utility Pump for Wort Chilling?,"After doing a bit of Googling for pumps in order to circulate water through a wort chiller (it being below freezing outside in Maine, I'm worried about using our outside hose hookup for water), I saw a few people say that they'd used the Flotec FP0F360AC Utility Pump.   Picked one up at Home Depot today for ~$85 or so, got home and discovered three unfortunate things in the manual. First, it specifically mentions that the output side shouldn't be under water, which is a problem because that was my plan. Second, the output hose is supposed to be 1/2"" - mine is 5/16"". Most problematically, it says that the output side shouldn't have any coils in it: an obvious issue if you're using a coiled metal wort chiller.   Sure enough, I tried it out and even after being lubricated with mineral oil, it pumped literally nothing. The input hose was solidly underwater, everything should have been fine, but no joy.   My questions, then, are these:   Is anyone successfully using this device? I.e. did I get a bad unit or is it because I'm using it against instructions? Assuming no one is and I return it, does anyone have a pump they recommend? I'm looking at this one instead:   [website]Any and all help appreciated. "
1851,Troubleshooting wild pours from kegerator,"I recently bought an Igloo 6 ft^3 kegerator as my first venture into kegging. It worked very well the first day but has been pouring wildly ever since.    The beer line is 4.5 feet of 3/16"" PVC; based on the numbers from Beersmith, this is a good length to get 1 PSI at the tap for a keg pressure of 12 PSI. I left a pint glass of water overnight in the bottom of the kegerator; it measured 32° F this morning. I'm doing another glass on top of the keg tonight but I can't imagine it'll be anywhere near 40° F. I plan to pick up some ½"" copper tubing to insulate the beer line in the tower and install it when the parts for my Sanke to Cornelius kit comes in, but because I'm still getting extremely foamy pours two and three pours from the first, I don't think heat is the major cause of these problems.   This brings me to the regulator, which I think might be faulty. A couple observations and questions:   Is there supposed to be any difference in the reading between the pressure with the shutoff valve turned ""off"" and ""on""? With the valve off, I set the regulator to 14 PSI; after turning the valve on, the pressure drops to 9 PSI and stays there. 18 drops to 10, 20 drops to 14 (and then creeps slightly downward). Is this normal? Is it safe to employ a little Kentucky windage on this system? Is it okay to open the shutoff valve and then fine tune the regulator? What is a ""normal"" magnitude and velocity for needle creep? I'll find that I thought I set the pressure to a stable 12 PSI but when I open the door 15 minutes later it's at 13-14 PSI. When it does this, do I just tweak the regulator and go on about my day? (And how will that affect force carbonating my home-brews?)  "
1852,What is the correct gravity for white wine?,"Bought a Youngs u Brew 7 Day wine kit. Similar to this: [website]The instructions says that I should only bottle when the gravity is between 1.006 and 1.000. However, after the 6 days as stated in the instructions I tested my gravity only to find that its at 1.032. So that is a massive difference. I'm guessing the yeast didn't do it's job.   Temperature was about right the entire time. Had a belt around the demijon at time to ensure it stayed around 22 degrees.   There was excessive foaming at one stage, so I am wondering if that affected the wine in some way?  So is there a correct gravity for wine at this stage? If so, am I completely off? "
1853,Spunding CO2 from 3 keg fermentors,"I'm starting to ferment in kegs, and want to naturally carbonate my beers by using a spunding valve. My batches yield 3 kegs, and I'm already using a 4º keg to aerate them after no chill and after the fermentation is done to transfer the beer to clean kegs.  How to set the pressure on 3 kegs? First I was thinking in just make 3 complete spunding valves. But the parts here for me are a little expensive to do that. So I made a interchangeable system based on quick-disconnects that allow me to control 1 or 3 kegs, based on this project.  But I've read an answer here, from MalFet, that says he use a filter cage as a blowoff trap, and somewhere else in other forums (sorry, I was not able to find it again) a guy saying that he uses another keg as blowoff and attach his valve on this keg to avoid beer get the valve at all.  So my real question is: can I connect 3 kegs (by its gas in posts) to a liquid out post of my 4º keg (with some sanitizer inside) and just a single spunding valve on the gas in side? It should work as a big blowoff vessel and a spunding valve, and I'm planning on set the system since fermentation is begun. Do you think that it will work? Any tought to realize this project another way? Thank you. "
1854,Can you use tincture method to infuse fruit?,Does anyone know anything about Tincture?  I know adding fruit to beer can be unsanitary.  Would it work to Tincture fruit and add to my brew secondary? 
1855,"""Dry hop"" etymology","What exactly the ""dry"" means in the ""dry hop"" expression ?   Does it refers to a dry flavor of hop in beer? Or because the hops were added to beer in a dried form? Could it be called or explained as ""cold hop""? Or what? ...  EDIT: A THEORY/SPECULATION - Considering the hop history in the beer and when it started to be used to ""dry hop"". Could it be preferably used in a dried form to avoid contamination instead of its fresh flowers ? And so... ""adding dried hop"". "
1856,Mash Tun vs Lauter Tun,"I've heard of both for very similar uses. What is the difference between a mash tun and a lauter tun? Or more generally, what is the difference between a mash and a lauter?  I found this wiki article on lautering, which implies after the mash, there is a rinse and sparge of the mash, but wouldn't that be taken care of in the mash tun, with a false bottom and vorlouf, with no need for an extra lautering container? "
1857,Step Infusion question,"In the most recent Zymurgy, there is a recipe that involves step infusion mash. It's not quite explained how to get the wort off the grain.   So I was wondering how a step infusion mash works? I currently brew BIAB, with my own sparge/rinse system, getting about 75-85% efficiency.   This step infusion calls for some water at 140 degrees (30 minutes), then some boiling water (again 30 minutes, mixing with previous water, the boiling temp is mitigated), then ""lauter and sparge"" with 3.5 gallons to get 6 gallons runoff. My question is what is 'lauter and sparge'? Aren't they the same thing? This is related to my question here, but this question is about a specific recipe and method. That question is more general. "
1858,What are the competing formulas for determining target Residual Alkalinity from SRM?,"In John Palmer's spread sheet, he calculates the low target RA as   SRM * 12.2 - 122   He calculates the high target RA as   (SRM-5.2)*12.2.   This BYO article states that   `target SRM = 0.14 * RA[CaCO3] + 5.2`,    or to restate it,  `RA as CaCO3 = (SRM - 5.2) / 0.14`   and taking the reciprocal of the divisor we get   RA as CaC03 = (SRM - 5.2) * 7.14   This is similar to John Palmer's high target of (SRM-5.2)*12.2.  So given a beer with 33 SRM, The BYO produces a target RA of ~200 and Palmer's high target produces a target RA of ~339 (his low target is 280).  How many competing formulas are there?  Which ones are used in the brewing software and how did they get selected over a competing formula? "
1859,"20% sugar, water and yeast brew smells awful quickly, how to fix?","I've got one complete, and one brewing batch of this ""Alcotec Vodka Type Spirit"" ([website]After about 2 weeks of having syphoned off about 2 litres into a plastic bottle it smelt terrible with what I can only describe as a cheesy aroma. The rest of the batch has a bit of a yeasty smell to it (this is long after having used the activated carbon, finings etc. and syphoning off very liberally) and some that I had syphoned into a glass bottle smells somewhat in between. I have another 30 litres of this stuff brewing and I don't know what to do to ensure it doesn't go to waste if it turns out the same. Would it just be the water I used or some yeast still suspended in the brew or something?  I've been looking into Freeze Concentrating and am considering trying it with this, would that help at all? and more generally what can I do in future to ensure my brews don't have such a tiny shelf life. I made a 25 litre batch of wine a few months ago which has been gradually becoming less and less pleasant while still being fairly gassy (I may have exposed it to oxygen after fermenting but I'm really not sure)  Any help on these matters would be greatly appreciated "
1860,How long does wine take to de-gas without much agitation,"I've made a few batches of wine and they seem to turn out alright except for being extremely frothy. I think in the past I've made the mistake of exposing my wine to oxygen when trying to agitate the gas out and I'm wondering if the gas would come out naturally if left alone and if so how long this might take. It seems when I bottle my wine it begins to start tasting off very quickly while the rest left in the fermenter still tastes fine, as if it just has a really short shelf-life. Should I be adding campden tablets? and if so when? I've only ever put my wine into sterile glass bottles but there seems to be a dramatic taste difference overnight. "
1861,Lambic fermentation/aging temperature,"I am anxious to start a batch of lambic, but have some reservations timing wise about the temperature in my basement currently.  My basement goes from around 45 in winter (now) to 60-65 at the end of summer.  If I keep the fermenter at ale temps for the first 10 days or so and then (slowly) lower the temp to ambient, am I going to stall/stunt the wild cultures too much?  Would I be better off waiting until the ambient temp is around 60 to let the cultures have a better start before they start to cool off in the winter?  Thanks, "
1862,Can wine be made in a keg instead of bottles?,"I have made bottles of red wine from grape juice kits before with great results.  However, I am pretty lazy and if it's possible to avoid cleaning/sterilising/filling/corking 30 bottles on brew day then I would love to do so.  I have a couple of top-tap King Kegs I use for real ale brewing, along with a couple of cheap bottom-tap barrels.  Is it possible to make decent red wine in kegs rather than bottles?  I assume bottom-tap would be easier as I don't want to carbonate it.  What should I watch out for when trying this? "

I know that humidity and temperature will play a factor but does anyone have any experience on how long it has lasted for them before drying up? Aside from setting up a blow off tube into a big jug of water does anyone know of any alternatives to a standard 3-piece or s-shaped airlock that would last a longer time?  Sure the blow off set up will work fine but I'm hoping for something a big more ""elegant""   Thanks in advance for any advice you can offer. "
1865,Starter quantity w/ Mr. Malty Calculator,"I have an imperial stout that seems to have slowed fermentation ~ 1.040. I made a 2L starter w/ Super San Diego yeast on stir plate and pitched it at high krausen.. no decanting.  Based on Mr. Malty's Yeast calculator, I needed 2.75L of starter for an OG 1.10. So I took slurry from my cider (Champagne yeast), created two 2L starters and cold crashing now and will decant this time and pitch both. The amount of yeast at bottom of the starters is very small, less than an inch in an Erlenmeyer flask. Then I got to thinking, is Mr. Malty's calculation of 2.75L of starter including all the liquid or strictly yeast slurry that settles at the bottom? Getting 2.75L of settlement sounds absolutely ridiculous but then again pitching a gallon starter for imperial stouts isn't unrealistic.  I'm pitching two 2L simply because I don't know how healthy that champagne yeast is... and I've got two stir plates, so why not?  EDIT: A better way of asking is: does Mr. Malty calculator assume you're cold crashing and decanting?   "
1866,What might kill a ginger bug - fact and fiction?,"I've been attempting to use a ginger bug to make non-alcoholic ginger beer, but I manage to kill the bug each time, either while it is cultivating or after I add it to the ginger syrup.  Overview of my process:   Put cup of distilled water in a jar or glass bowl. Add 2 teaspoons of sugar and two teaspoons of fresh ginger with peel.  Add 2 teaspoons of sugar and 2 teaspoons of ginger at the same time each day, say the evening, and stirring each morning. Stirring may occur Once there is considerable bubbles, make the ginger tea/syrup in a stainless steel pot. Let it cool. I usually use 2 quarts of distilled water, 1 and 1/2 cup of white sugar, and a lot of chopped/grated ginger, like at least ""4 inches"", usually close to double that. Once cooled, filter into a larger stainless steel pot. Add another 2 quarts of distilled water, and then filter the active bug into the same pot. Add strained juice of two lemons. Stir, then immediately bottle the contents. ... No carbonation 2 weeks or even 2 months later.   My question simply is: what can actually kill the ginger bug? Some things I've read/thought about:   Does contact with stainless steel or other metal kill it? Including the strainer, spoons, pots. Does using distilled water instead of filtered water affect it? Does the chlorine from tap water affect the bug? I've seen so many different recommendations for the type of sugar used, from white sugar to unrefined sugar to rapadura, does any of that make a difference? I live in a cold climate this time of year, does that matter? It seems to start OK. Can too much sugar kill it, in the same way that sugar often helps canned preserves avoid botulism? Stirring is meant to agitate a bug while cultivating it, but at some point does it hinder instead of help? Does the amount of water used to start the bug matter?  "
1867,Proper use of campden tablets in a recipe that calls for the staggered addition of a sugar source,"I'm very new to all this, but is my intent to brew an oaked apple maple acerglyn by slightly altering this recipe. My plan is to brew about five gallons--as per the recipe--but utilize an appropriate amount of campden tablets to preemptively sterilize the must 24 hours before pitching the yeast. However, this recipe calls for adding a quarter gallon of maple syrup before and ten days after pitching. What steps can I take to make sure that the second dose of maple syrup is properly sterile?   EDIT: I plan on using EC-1118 yeast and after primary fermentation, the ABV should be hovering somewhere around 17-19%. This is when I intend to add about 750mL of apple cider. Should I use a campden tablet to sterilize the cider (which will likely be unpasteurized) or will the alcohol content prevent any bacteria from spreading? "
1868,Pilsner racking before bottling,I`m brewing a pilsner at slightly higher temperature levels and has been two and a half weeks.   Can I rack and then bottle if my hydrometer reading are stable? Or should I rack and then store in fridge for extended period before bottling?

I have ordered ale yeast online, however I'm afraid it will not arrive until at least tomorrow and I made my wort yesterday. Question:  1. should I wait for the ale yeast (would my wort go off)?  2. should I use the wine yeast?  3. should I use the cider yeast?  Thank you in advance. "

1873,Calculating Efficiency manually using metric system,"Can someone please give me a hand calculating Mash Efficiency manually?  I use mostly Gladfield malt along with some cara 'x's' and BeerSmith 3 but would like to calculate manually so I have a grasp of what's going on.

I am not sure how to convert this to potential points for Kilograms and Litres before working out the overall mash efficiency. I think the first part of the calculation is just to multiply these together, which gives: 203.5 (5.5x37 etc.), 17.5 and 10.5. From here, I'm not sure what conversion Beersmith has used to gain their efficiency estimate. Can anyone assist? Cheers "
1874,Brewing using Lambic yeast: can't reuse the vessel for something else?,One of my friends told me that if you brew a lambic with lambic yeast (e.g. the WLP one) you shouldn't be re-using that carboy for anything else.

1879,Yeast Attenuation,"Does the percentage attenuation of the yeast, directly match the fermentability of the wort, ie, If i am after a one fifth gravity beer, then that has attenuated by 80% .   so is the spirit indication and ash content taken into consideration for the final gravity result? As I see that yeasts can vary widely in there purported attenuation. from low 65% to high 80%. So, how do I match the fermentability of the wort with a particular attentive yeast strain, in order to get a one fifth gravity beer?   Is there a chart for this? And if I were to use malt that had a percentage fermentability of 64%, with a yeast with  a 70% attenuation, would I result in a one fifth gravity beer? "
1880,How to fully carbonate a keg with no beer line at very low serving pressure?,"I use a tap attached directly to my corny keg (similar to this: [website]My carbonation method is to cold crash to 2 degrees, keg and purge oxygen, then hook up CO2 at 200kpa (30psi) for 36-48 hours, then reduce to serving pressure and leave for a week or two.  I get a nice pour with a bit of head, but the mouthfeel just isn't right - not enough bubbles - and it seems to get weaker over time. If the serving pressure is any higher I just get foam.  How can I increase the level of carbonation without increasing serving pressure? Do I just get a long beer line so I can increase the standing pressure on the keg and maintain a higher level of carbonation? Or just leave it for longer at the low serving pressure and temperature?

1881,Gelatine as a beer finings (clarifier)?,I’ve never used a clarifier when I brew. However a friend used one of those Mangrove Jack kit packs for his first time. I noticed it comes with a packet of beer clarifier. On inspection I noted this seems to be no more than gelatine(?). Essentially 5g (18oz) per 23L (6gal). Does that really work? 
1882,Alternative to stir plate for yeast starter (and erlenmeyer flask),"Looking at creating my first yeast starter for a DIPA recipe with on O.G. target of 1.085.  For this O.G. Brewer's Friend is telling me I would need a 3L starter of an O.G. of 1.040 with a stir plate to hit my cell count (assuming yeast is 1 month old) (oh, I'll also be buying 2 packs of yeast).  The yeast starters work far better with a stir plate, however, stir plates cost an absolute fortune and there's no way I can justify spending that kind of money.  What viable alternatives are there to stir plates which will help the starter?  Maybe some sort of underwater fan? Placed in such a position to the side of the vessel it creates the same whirlpool?  Also, erlenmeyer flasks cost an absolute fortune. With additional headroom over 3L the flask would need to be 5L? At that size they are very costly. Altogether with a stir plate that seems to be coming in around the £500 mark. Is there any particular benefit of an erlenmeyer flask? Surely any ol' container will do? I've seen a pretty huge glass vase in the local charity shop for a few quid and I'm hoping to hear that'll do just fine. "
1883,Aggressive dry hopping schedule normal?,"So I'm looking through single hop recipes pretty much anywhere. When I came a across brewdogrecepies.com I was a bit surprised to find their dry hopping is pretty aggressive.  Most of the recipes use 5-10 times amount of dry hop as any other recipe. [website]Is this normal for single hop ales? I only use dry hopping for my single hop ales occasionally, when the hop has promising aroma qualities to it. Is there a point to do it even if it's not typically an aroma hop?  "
1884,Star-San and Aluminum Issues,"Have used Star-San for years in my home brewing, I recently saw some information on the web that it should not be used on aluminum substances, i.e. pots, kegs, etc.  Reviewing the pdf about Star-San I don’t see any mention of avoiding contact with aluminum.  Anything to this information? If so, what if you left some diluted Star-San in a keg for a period of time by accident? "
1885,Integrated thermometer compared to rod thermometer,I am considering to buy a 200 litre pot from stainless steel for brewing. Those with an integrated thermometer are significantly more expensive than those without and I was wondering if the integrated thermometer is worth the money. What is the advantage of an integrated thermometer compared to a conventional rod thermometer? ... well obviously they are integrated and I suppose more convenient but what else? ... are they more accurate or better in any other way? Thanks!   
1886,kegged cider and oxygen,first timer at both cider and kegs.   I have been reading that pumping oxygen (air) into a keg as the beer level goes down in order to maintain carbonation is bad as the oxygen will reignite the yeasts and alter the beer's taste. Is this still true for cider ? Do I really need CO2 tanks for the job ? 
1887,Racked Too Early... Now What?,"Newbie here. First post, only my 2nd batch of home brew and my first partial grain brew. I did a pale ale ""Northern Light"" from BestCase.ca.  So my problem... the instructions had a big bold statement ""DO NOT LEAVE IN PRIMARY FERMENTER FOR MORE THAN 5 DAYS"". So, being paranoid, I racked on the 4th day. The SG went from 1.048 to 1.020. I thought I was good (now I know I should have looked for consistent readings for a few days straight).  No I have a secondary full of very cloudy beer. There's some sediment gathering on the bottom but the SG hasn't changed (still at 1.020). No krausen is re-forming or much of any bubbling is happening.  What now? Should I just leave it and hope it clears up? Should I add in more yeast? Am I at risk of bottle bombs if the SG doesn't change and it stays cloudy (suspended yeast goes active in the bottles?)  (dark spot on top is just a shadow)   "
1888,Not Red but Orange: How to correct the color of an Irish Red after brewing?,"Probably we used not enough of the carared, but what we can do? Is it possible to use a dark fruit extract(sour, not sweet) to correct the color in the end? And what will be the effect on  taste? "
1889,What to brew in the summer?,"What kind of beer can I brew in the summer (30C by day, a few less by night), without special cooling equipment? Anything special (but not too complicated/expensive) I should do? "
1890,What do you get if you distill mead?,"This is just out of curiosity...  I mean if you distill beer, you get whiskey... if you distill wine, you get cognac/brandy... if you distill fermented molasses, you get rum... if you distill fermented agave, you get tequila... if you distill apple-cider, you get calvados (if you happen to live in Calvados, France)... if you distill fermented horse-milk (kumiss), you'll probably regret it...  But what do you get if you distill (honey-) mead?  Does it even have a specific name?  I'm obviously not thinking about distilling and filtering it into oblivion, at which point you'd end-up with (something like) vodka...  I'm thinking about what you would get if you distilled it in a pot-still, wanting the base (here mead) to impart flavor to the finished spirit.  "
1891,My bottles are Conditioning underwater. Why are there bubbles on the caps on day 2 but not day 0 through 1?,"On Sunday (day 0) I bottled beer for the first time (with my first batch). I asked my brother how I could determine whether or not I successfully locked the caps onto the bottles to make them air-tight, and he said that I could stick them underwater and look for bubbles to float out.  I live in California, and recently it has averaged 80*F daily. I have used a swamp cooler for my fermentors, so I decided to do the same thing for my conditioning bottles. I got a tub, placed all the bottles in, and then filled the tank with water, completely submerging the bottles. I carefully watched them during this process and noted that none of the bottles released any bubbles. According to my brother's theory, this means I correctly attached the caps to the bottles and made them air-tight.  On day 0 and day 1, nothing happened. Then, on day 2 (Tuesday), all my bottles had varying amounts of bubbles on the caps, underwater. They are just stuck there, chilling. What is the meaning of this? Some caps are completely filled with bubbles, while others only have 10-25% of their surface covered.  I just took one bottle out of the water and observed that it still has the empty room on top--indicating that it has not filled with water. I also just wiped off the bubbles from half of the bottles and will observe later whether or not bubbles reform on the caps. EDIT: Bubbles never reformed even after 14 days    (P.S., if one of my bottles were to explode underwater, would the water somehow minimize the likelyhood that one bottle would shatter the other bottles, or that glass would fly up out of my tub?) "
1892,"How do I calculate how much sugar to add, for carbonation","I have a brew, that I will need to bottle soon. But, how do I calculate, how much sugar to add, before bottling? I'll be adding table-sugar, but I am very worried about exploding bottles.  Are there some rules for calculating? I assume the type of beer you're making, also plays in. In my case, it's german wheat beer. "
1893,Does skunk off flavour go away?,"Skunky off-flavours are caused by ultraviolet light causing chemical reaction that transforms alpha-acids. Once this flavour is created, does it go away with time, and if so how much time? Or will it stay forever once it is present? "
1894,Keeping beer from entering CO2 line while Carbing Keg?,So I am getting ready to carbonate my first keg! But I am worried about beer entering the CO2 line if I use the 'rock on my lap like a baby' method :)  I am worried because I tried to carbonate a bottle of water to test my setup using one of the carbonating bottle caps. So I held the bottle sideways and gave it a good shake. But I then realized that water went into the CO2 line. Would this happen if I carb my keg while rolling it around on its side??  Thanks for any help!! Rob 
1895,Will a wheat beer taste watery before carbonation?,"I'm not an expert brewer, but I've made 5-6 batches over the past 18 months. Process-wise, I feel like I know what I'm doing, but I am still learning different styles of beer.  For summer, I decided to make a wheat beer. The recipe was:   1700g of LME (Blackrock's Whispering Wheat) 900g DME (came with the kit, not sure exactly of the nature) Fermentis US-05 6g bittering hops 12g aroma hops OG 1.045 FG 1.012 (the recipe suggested 1.044 and 1.011)   .. and the recipe said that the kit made 19L.  I have 2 10L carboys, so I split the wort into 2 ~9.5L chunks.  Today, I bottled the first carboy (I am waiting on a few more bottles to do the second batch).  When I measured FG, I was happy to be matching the recipe almost exactly. However, when I drank the beer, I found it very watery. Another (amateur) homebrewer tasted it and confirmed.  The flavor was as expected for a summery wheat -- but it lacked that... body? ... that I would expect from a wheat.  Is this a SBRHAHB situation?  Will the carbonation and refrigeration bring it into line?  Or am I just going to have a VERY easy to drink watery wheat? "
1896,Can I wash/re-use all that yeast in the blowoff,"Last night, I put my 1.130+ (it wasn't until midnight when I finished that I noticed that it was higher than my hydrometer and refractometer could go) wort in the carboy to ferment.  I wake up this morning, and as to be expected, it's going absolutely nuts, near filling up what was already a half full gallon jug of water + star-san for my blow-off.  It's hard to tell as there's so much blow-off in it that it nearly matches to the color of the carboy itself, but it looks like there's somewhere between a 1/4 - 1/3 gallon of yeast at the bottom of the jug.  I was wondering if it were possible to wash and can off that yeast?  Is it not worth it given what's going to be at the bottom of the carboy in a week after primary has finished?  As stated above, it was about 1/2 - 2/3 full of tap water and star-san before fermentation began. "
1897,Brew from an out of date kit - not fermented,"I kicked off a wildly out of date (2008) brew from a kit a few weeks ago. ( One of those kits with a packet of yeast and 2 large tins of goop.)  The brewing didnt go as well as I've had them go previously, but there was some pressure under the brew bucket lid.  Anyway I checked the hydrometer and it seemed ok.  So I barrelled it with the extra bit of sugar too.  However a week or so later there's no pressure at all in the barrel.  So, I guess should I:  a) Decant back to the bucket and try again with another packet of yeast? b) give up and get a kit that is in date? :) "
1898,How much peated malt to get a hint of smoke?,"I've got some peated malt that a friend gave me, and I've been looking for some way to use it. My current idea is to brew an Irish Red Ale (OG 1.055, FG 1.012, IBU 21, SRM 16) with just enough peated malt to provide barely noticeable smoke taste and aroma.  I originally decided on 1% peated malt (2oz in a 5.5 gallon batch) based on this BYO article.  This forum thread suggests that 2% or 3% is provides light smokiness.   This thread seems to conclude that the proper amount of peated malt is zero.  Does anyone have first-hand experience brewing with peated malt? Should I omit it altogether (and perhaps use Rauch malt instead)? Is 1% a safe amount? "
1899,"sediment in wine bottle, how to serve","I made some wine recently, and I screwed up slightly.  I degassed the wine the day I was going to bottle.  I let it sit a couple hours expecting the sediment to settle after I ""blended"" the wine, significantly disturbing it.  I guess I should have let it sit after that for days, rather than hours.  Anyway, what's done is done, and I have wine that has a lot of sediment in it.  When drinking it, almost the whole bottom half of the bottle is undrinkable! It tastes fine, but the sediment feel is a tad overbearing.  So what do I do?  Should I get a decantur with a sediment filter?  Should I just strain it through cheesecloth or something finer when I serve/pour it?  What's finer than cheesecloth and found easily?  Any thoughts would be appreciated; I'm tired of not enjoying the fruits of my labor. "
1900,Specific gravity is the wrong way,"I am brewing my first lager, a German Oktoberfest kit from Brewer's Best, after 12 batches of ales.  I fermented in the primary for 17 days at 58 degrees and then raised the temperature to 65 degrees for 4 days before racking to secondary.  Everything seemed to be going well as I was decreasing the temperature until I hit around 40 degrees when suddenly instead of blowing out of my airlock it appears to be trying to suck air in.

1901,What's the best/safest way to handle likely bottle bombs?,"I'm using 16oz amber e-z cap bottles (swing tops). I've read that they'll self-vent before exploding, but I've heard other accounts of them actually exploding.  I'm storing them like this and it's been a week since bottling. I've been meaning to vent them a few days ago but forgot and tonight when I went to vent them I barely touched the swing top mechanism and it blew off (very loud, like warm champagne) and started gushing.  I pressed the top back on and took it to the sink and after letting it settle for a few seconds was able to get the cap to stay shut. That one is in the back of the fridge currently. The rest are still in the cooler, and I've placed a few large ice chunks and brought the temperature down to ~50 degrees F so hopefully fermentation will slow down (if it's still going) and/or more CO2 will dissolve into the liquid until I can figure out what to do next.  My concern is exploding bottles... and the pressure is potentially still increasing every second (though unlikely after a week I would assume).  What about venting the bottles? Would the safest way be under water in a bucket to slow down the glass if it does explode? Or should I just not be so worried and move them to the fridge ASAP and just be mindful while opening them later?  How likely are these to just blow up in my hand while moving to the fridge or afterwards while opening? Is it normal for a swing top to just blow off like that at room temperature?  Any tips or advice?  Much thanks in advance... "
1902,Lager yeast fermenting at 25-30C,"The summer is approaching, and I would like to make some experiments using lager yeast, just completely out of its temperature range. I guess that steam bear was made using lager yeast at higher temperature. So I want to try using lager (I previously wrote ale by mistake) yeast at relatively hot temperature. What should I expect? Just a beer that tastes not right or may something interesting come?  EDIT: Sorry for the inconvenience, I meant lager yeast. "
1903,Can a keg explode?,"As I read in some answers to other questions they should not explode, is it true? Why is that? Is it because they have a safety valve or just because they are very strong? "
1904,How do conventional foods effect kombucha brewing?,"I would like to know how/if chemicals such as pesticides commonly found with conventional foods or even those found in tap water; how/if they affect the quality of the kombucha first or second stage brew (continuous brewing)?  Studies have shown kombucha to have detoxifying effects on our internal organs, so at-least our organs are receiving this probiotic aid. Though I wonder does the fermentation process dismantle any chemical properties, or visa versa — can chemicals effect the quality of the fermentation process? "
1905,Can I steep aroma malt,"I have some Brewferm Aroma malt 150 EBC. I think normally I couldn't because it is full of unconverted starch, but I would like to do some extract beer and use a little (5-10%) of it. Will it be bad if I steep it, or could I get good results?  EDIT: this is the link . Both Weyermann and Brewferm are cited. I guess the problem is the malt name is wrong on the online reseller, since the package I really got buying that one is ""Brewferm aroma 150 EBC"", which is described as ""base malt"" here. "
1906,"Kegging vs. Bottling (force-carbonated), what's the difference in taste?","I'm achieving a rather bizarre sense of enlightenment and was hoping someone could explain the impact that force carbonation in a keg vs. force carbonation in a keg with eventually bottling off would have on a beer.  I ask this because I am now on my second beer, this one being an IIPA (Belgian yeast) that I've bottled straight from the keg after it being in the keg for 3-4 weeks, and now that I just cracked one, 2-3 weeks after putting it in the bottles, it tastes profoundly different than when it was in the keg.  I will admit that the hop aroma is dying off (which frankly, given the amount of dry hopping I did, is probably a good thing), the flavor is still mostly there, but it seems a lot more well-rounded and not as disjointed as it did while it was in the keg (bubble gum aroma, not much hop flavor, enamel stripping bitterness, it all seems to be centering on each other into a balanced mix now).  Is this just the effects of aging?  I saw the same thing with a smoked porter using peat malt.  I kegged it at the same time I did this IIPA, and had I not known that I put peated malt in it, I never would have tasted it.  After I bottled it (again, same day as this IIPA, I used 4-5% peated malt), and let it sit until last Thursday, it tasted like someone encapsulated the entire Amazonian rain forest after being burnt to the ground by a bunch of torch wielding 7 foot tall blonde beauties all in one bottle.  I never got that sense of flavor when it was kegged, not even close, and I'm depressed that I drank almost all of it before I could get this flavor out of it.  What gives?  Is it just age?  Does bottling with less head room for the CO2/beer to breathe have some sort of effect on flavor?  Is something else at work? "
1907,Does PH affect hop bitterness?,"I've always disagreed with the idea that dry hopping or late hopping added 0 IBUs to your end product. If I ever brewed a kit or recipe and followed the hop schedule exactly, it would pretty much always end up too bitter. I found out that my local water pH was high (8.0) when running into some astringency issues and wondered if that had anything to do with it. At first I thought it was the high sulfate content in my water so I did the following tests. What I ended up finding is that lower pH (more acidic water) lessened the perceived bitterness in various hop tea tests.   Two-water hop tea test  8 oz local tap water heated to 160F with 1 hop pellet CTZ (in PPM Ca=45,Mg=15,Na=65,SO4=125,Cl=50,HCO3=225)  8 oz distilled water heated to 160F with 1 hop pellet  Stirred and after 15 minutes examined. I noticed that with the tap water the hops didn't precipitate as much and clumped at the top. The local tap water produced a much more back-of-the tongue bitterness. I had two others test in a blind taste test and they all grimaced when they tasted the tap water hop tea. The aroma was similar if not more pronounced with the distilled water.   This led me to my next test, trying a cold hop test to mimic dry hopping.   8oz local tap water (see above) with 5 hop pellets CTZ, crushed and stirred. Sat 40F for 12 hours.  8oz distilled water with 5 hop pellets, crushed and stirred. 40F for 12 hours.  My results were similar to the hot hop tea experiment. The distilled water dry hop tea yielded a much less bitter result while the local tap water dry hop tea was very bitter and harsh.   I thought I had figured it all out, there was some correlation with either high sulfate or HCO3 content but I wanted to see if PH was the determining factor instead of mineral content. I had read that high mineral content accentuated hop bitterness (famously so in Burton water) but in my quest to trying brew a really nice IPA with great aroma and low perceived bitterness.   8oz local tap water (see above) with 5 hop pellets CTZ, crushed and stirred. Sat 40F for 12 hours.  8oz local tap water with 10 drops lemon juice, 5 hop pellets, crushed and stirred. 40F for 12 hours. No PH readings taken (broken pH meter)  To my surprise there was a big difference, it was very obvious that there was less bitterness with the acidic sample. Also on the high pH sample, the hops clumped at the top and left a clearer liquid. I couldn't notice a difference in aroma.   Can someone replicate this? Maybe someone with a good pH meter? "
1908,"How long to dry hop, then when to bottle and taste?","For my second brewing attempt, I'm doing a Pale Ale, with this 20L Fresh Wort Kit and US-05 yeast.  I put it in the fermenter 7 days ago, and it has remained fairly stable at 19° Celsius (66°F).  Today I plan on dry hopping with 30g Galaxy Hops Pellets.  I would just like to confirm all that is remaining to do:   Check the specific gravity each day for the next 2 or 3 days Take the hops out and bottle once it is stable Keep bottles at 19 degrees for minimum 3-4 weeks before tasting   Just want to make sure I'm doing this right!  Thanks in advance for any suggestions "
1909,Is cold CO2 required for proper kegerator?,"I've seen most in-home kegerators have the CO2 tank and regulator inside the fridge. But I remember from my bar-working days that the CO2 tank was outside the fridge. Does this really make a difference? If I had a setup that required the CO2 tank outside the fridge, how much am I losing? "
1910,Brewing with brettanomyces bruxellensis,"I got a good deal with some White Labs yeasts, including one Brettanomyces bruxellensis (WLP650), and I really don't know how to brew with it. Should I use it only for secondary or could I made a fruit lambic with an ale yeast?  EDIT: OK, simple question, do I need an ale yeast to ferment a Lambic with Brett? "
1911,Ginger beer that lasts,"I want to make a batch of alcoholic ginger beer. However, I know from past experience that one problem with ginger beer is that the bulk of the fermentation happens in the bottles, and I can't drink it fast enough: it gradually hardens and gets more and more bitter (and more alcoholic) until the last bottle is nigh-undrinkable.  What's a good way to prevent this from happening?  I gather that when making, um, non-ginger beer (is there a term for this?), fermentation is controlled by using a mixture of sucrose and lactose. Apparently the yeast will feed off the sucrose but not the lactose, so once the yeast has consumed all the sucrose fermentation stops but you still get a sweet flavour from the lactose. OTOH I have also seen ginger beer kits that have artificial sweeteners in them, probably for the same reason. I can't stand the taste of these; does lactose affect flavour? And would this work with ginger beer anyway?  Are there any other techniques I should look at? Obviously because the bottles are pressurised I can't take the lid off to add anything when I want fermentation to stop. Another thing that might work is irradiation, but unfortunately my fission reactor's on the blink. "
1912,Why does my witbier stink?,"I've searched far and wide and can't find a good answer. Seems to be a lot of talk about the sulphur smell I noticed during fermentation, but this is a bit different.   Brewed this masterpiece up and bottled a few weeks ago, my first witbeer but one of a few of Biermuncher recipes I've made. All have been good so far.   So I chilled and cracked one open last night, poured it and almost dropped the glass when it got close to my face.  The smell. It was so rank, like someone farted on it - Seriously.   As any good brewer would, I held my breath and took a gulp. It tasted really really good. Added a slice of orange which covered up the smell a little, enjoyed the rest.   Question is: What's up with the stank odor?    What did I do wrong? "
1913,Oxidization during transfer,"It has become clear that I need to practice my transfer techniques; I just completed a primary-to-secondary transfer which involved what I'm guessing is a fairly significant amount of aeration.  During my transfer (1-gallon basic brown beer, direct from carboy to carboy; no intermediate pot), I used an auto-siphon, and ended up pumping oxygen in.  In addition, there was air in the line even while the beer was flowing (which I had to restart several times).  Ultimately, if a beer gets aerated, is it a solid bet that the beer will be oxidized and pick up that ""musty, cardboard, stale odor and flavor""?  Should I not get my hopes up, or might things still work out?  Update:  Last night, I opened one of the bottles.  Much to my surprise, it was not awful!  The carbonation was a little low, it could have had more flavor, and it was a little stale, but it was not the disaster that I was expecting.  Hooray! "
1914,Flowers of Wine (Problem),"Context:  I am currently working on a batch of jalapeno-cranberry wine.  It's been in primary for five days so far and I am beginning to suspect I have flowers in my wine.  I was not too concerned earlier this week as I thought it was just residual foam from an active fermentation, but the more time goes by, the more I suspect there is a problem.  Problem:  When I view the must, it appears as if there are little flecks / clumps of yeast floating on the surface and around the edges of the straining bag and the bucket.  Question:  How can I tell if I have flowers for sure?  If so, how can I tell between spoiled yeast being the cause or bacteria?  Reference     "
1915,black lager and diacetyl rest,I am doing a black lager and was wanting to do a rest. I read the instructions wrong and placed it in the secondary. Is it too late to do the rest? Is the new added oxygen going to actually make it worse? 
1916,Non-plastic siphon tube,"I know that some people say that PVC is fine for racking tubes, but I have someone who is looking for an alternative--HDPE or PP would be acceptable but not preferred.  Since PVC is the only type of plastic tube our local hardware store sells, are there some DIY alternatives that have worked well for people?  (Caoutchouc?  Sheep's intestine?  What'd we use for this before plastic came along?) "
1917,Why did my airlock overflow?,"   Why did this happen? Is this bad? Aside from wasting beer, it seems to me that this would invite infection? If it means anything, I smelled the airlock and it seemed mostly vinegar, but tasting the airlock (and spitting it out) revealed no vinegar taste, more of a terrible beer taste.   Background: This is my fourth batch of extract brewing. This is the second time I used an aeration stone. I pitched the yeast on Sunday around 4pm. I believe it was fine this morning (Tuesday) at 8am, although I might not have actually looked. At 10am it was overflowing. I followed the kit instructions perfectly and had 5 gallons of wart in the 6 gallon bucket.  I sanitized a new airlock and replaced it. "
1918,Does anybody know about Chemipro Acid?,"I'm living in the Netherlands and it seems that Starsan isn't available here.  I'm wondering if anyone knows if Chemipro Acid is the same thing?  Or just what's in it?  For reference, see here:  [website]and here:  [website]They don't seem to say, so just wondering if anyone can shed any light on the matter.  Thanks a lot,  Chris "
1919,Salvaging flat beer?,I recently brewed a Schneider Aventus clone and the end result was a flat beer. I missed a step in the instructions to add a fresh dose of yeast a few days before bottling so I'm assuming that this is the result of sluggish yeast. I still have a gallon in secondary that I was aging on oak chips so I ordered a more yeast to add to that.   My question is can I pop the caps of the flat beers and add a small amount of yeast to each one and recap them? Is this a viable route to take or are the flat beers destined for the drain?  Edit: If I remember correctly I primed with 1/4 cup DME for a one gallon batch and 3/4 cup DME for a 3 gallon batch. I bottle conditioned/carbonated for a month in my basement which is a steady 68 degrees. 
1920,Can I aerate again before bottling?,"I have a Dunkelweizen from a Northern Brewer all-grain kit that I brewed and pitched 2 weeks ago. I have one problem, I forgot to aerate before I pitched the yeast. I'm concerned that the yeast will not have enough oxygen to carbonate when I bottle it. I have more yeast I can pitch when I prime(Wyeast 3068), but will that be enough? Will aerating it now give it a bad taste? Any advice would be appreciated! "
1921,When should I do a Diacetyl rest (Wyeast 1187)?,"I'm assuming that this should be done before racking when ""primary fermentation"" is complete?  I suppose I have another question then too.  Is there any way to estimate what the FG should be based on initial gravity and style?  Or does it completely depend on hydrometer readings and time?  When I do a diacetyl rest how warm should I go?  Temp range is 64-74F.  I pitched a little high (78F) but got the temp down to about 65F before there was any activity at all.  My initial gravity reading was around 1.07.  The recipe is for a ""Wet Mountain IPA"" clone.  This is my first batch and the advice here has been very valuable, thank you. "
1922,What should I put in my swamp cooler water to retard growth of nasty things?,"For the last 2 batches of beer I've used a swamp cooler to cool off the plastic bucket fermenter. The cooling worked well, but on both batches, there was a bit of mold growing on the outside and/or under the rim of the bucket where the wet towel was. I added some sanitizer to the water in the last batch, but it didn't seem to help. Adding bleach to the water seems like a bad idea. Would there be any chance of bleach or another mold-killer ruining my bucket and/or beer from the outside? Is there something safe I can add to the water to keep the mold and other nasties at bay? "
1923,Is there a simple rule of thumb for OG and fermentation time?,"I just brewed my 5th batch, but for the first time didn't use a kit, but an online recipe. So now, I have no idea of how long to keep it in the fermenter before bottling. From what I understand, a higher OG beer needs more time to age, but how much more? Is there some simple rule of thumb, or formula?   In case it matters, I made a Great Divide Yeti Imperial Stout Clone. I made it with extract, and missed the OG by a lot. The reading was 1.072 instead of the expected 1.090. I made another beer which had the same OG, and did 1 month primary, 2 months secondary and 3 weeks in bottles. That worked quite well, so I am inclined to stick to the same timeline.  "
1924,Bananas in beer?,"My first look into this site and a novice at brewing, at the moment I have only tinkered with replacing honey with sugars with the shop bought beer kits in the can, all the experiments have worked really well so far.  I've been wondering for a while now if I can add mashed bananas in a muslin bag to the fermenter for a 1 week in the fermenter brew? if so do I need to adjust the sugars to suit?  cheers Paul "
1925,How does oat malt work for steeping?,"I'm presently an extract, partial boil brewer.  I was thinking of steeping oat malt (from, for example, Thomas Fawcett).  Will this work?  I'm using a recipe here, which calls for flaked oats.  But oats must be mashed with barley malt to utilise them.  So is steeping oat malt a waste of time? "
1926,Possible Stuck Fermentation,"I'm attempting to brew a high gravity stout, OG 1088. Its been in the primary for two weeks.  I assumed it had completed fermentation since it feremented extremely vigorously, so much so I had to use a blowoff tube (for a bucket fermenter).  Once that calmed down I replaced with  bubbler and it went consistently for over a week.  I checked the gravity today and it is between 1032-1034, which is still rather high.  Visually it appears that fermentation has complete.  I used Wyeast NB NeoBritannia 1945, and think b/c of the high gravity it is just spent. I have another package of this available should I consider adding this fresh yeast to it? What kind of results can I expect if I add another entire smack pack of yeast? "
1927,What is the proper method for blending beers?,"In regards to this question I've been inspired to take my flat beer and blend it with a new beer. My main question is when is the best time to combine the two beers? Should it be done at the start of primary fermentation or much later? Are there any ""gotchas"" or non-obvious things to keep in mind during this process? "
1928,Adding Sugar to Secondary to Create a Layer of CO2?,"This might sound like an oddball question. But does it make sense to add a small amount of sugar to a beer (after fermenting appears to have stopped in the primary fementer), after transferring to a secondary fermenter, to create a layer of CO2 right above the beer to keep oxygen out of it?  I had thought about getting a small tank of CO2, possibly even a paintball canister, to “top off” the jug, but a tiny bit of sugar would seem to be an easier way to achieve the same result (for the price of a small amount of additional sediment at the bottom).  Has anyone done this? Or does anyone have any opinions on this? Thanks. "
1929,After Racking should my beer still produce C02,"I have been aging a winter lager and a Mead for a few weeks.  The mead was always in a glass carboy and I just moved it from one to another. I do not have a water air lock for them so I have a balloon I sanitized and sealed around it with plumbers tape. I have a pin hole in it that allows the co2 to leak out. This keeps the balloon inflated but still allows the CO2 to escape properly. For the mead this has been working fantastic and even after racking it is producing enough c02 to inflate the balloon.   My been on the other hand went from a primary (5 gallon bucket with a water air lock) to the glass carboy with the same balloon method. The balloon is barley inflating even after a few days, with out a pin hole punched in it. I know the main fermentation happens to a beer the few few days, and I left it in the primary for 2 weeks. After racking should it be processing enough to inflate the balloon? Or did I accidentally botch my beer? I only have the mead to compare it too, I have never racked beer before. If it is ruined can I fix it by adding a little yeast slurry? "
1930,When is it okay to bottle?,"I've brewed literally dozens of Beer House brewkits, but I'm waiting on a Winterfest Ale kit that just won't seem to completely stop secondary fermentation...every other time I made these kits, fermenting is absolutely finished after at most 12 days (at 70 degrees), but this kit just keeps on truckin'.  Today is Day 15, and there's still some minimal but steady bubble activity visible in the glass carboy...you can't watch the airlock move, but there is some CO2 still being generated.      I certianly don't want to end up with an exploding batch by bottling too soon (these kits include 190g of dextrose for bottling), but I'm also wondering if everything is actually fine and that this will end up being a more completely fermented batch than I'm used to.  Can I go ahead and bottle now as is?  If so, should I cut back a bit on the bottling sugar?  Or should I keep waiting it out until the bubbling completely stops?   "
1931,Prickly Pear Beer Experiment,I have 1.5lbs of prickly pears and want to make a 2gal all grain batch from them.  My question is how should I add the prickly pears?   Should I smash them and only add the juice?   or maybe  Cut off the skin and add them in secondary? 
1932,Secondary Fermenter Temperature -- Colder?,"My American Pale Ale has been fermenting away nicely for the past few days and I'm certain I'll be racking to secondary within a few days (after SG gets stable).   I'm curious: I've been keeping my primary stable at ~68°F using a 10 gallon utility bucket filled with water and 100-Watt fish tank heater; can I unplug the heater (I'd like to save the power) and just keep the secondary in the water bath? I live in Southern California, so the low will only be in the high 40's at worst, with the water bath probably averaging ~60°F.  I'm also going to be dry hopping 2oz of Cascade hops--will the lower temperature be good/bad for this purpose? "
1933,"Are the terms ""dry"", ""low FG"" and ""drinkable"" synonymous?","Hopefully this doesn't fall under ""opinion"" but I believe this will help alleviate some questions on mashing/fermentation techniques. I guess you could break this question into parts. Also the term ""drinkable"" is assuming the beer is without off-flavors:  Are the terms ""dry"" and ""drinkable"" synonymous? My initial answer would be no, since I've had Imperial Stouts that I'd consider more drinkable (not to be mistaken with sessionable) than a dry-stout, say Guinness. Then I've had stouts with lots of residual sweetness that were good, just more of a sipping beer. Although, a ""bone dry"" beer may not be considered drinkable either. So without answering my own question, I guess it's safe to say drinkable is more related to residual sweetness/alcohol perception?       Are the terms ""dry"" and ""low FG"" synonymous? Again, a dry beer tends to be low FG but not necessarily the other way around? Can you have a dry beer that was mashed at the higher temp range.. if so what type of body would you expect? I'll use Duvel and Jolly Pumpkin as an example. Both produce great beers that favor the dry side, but certainly do not lack in body. I know Duvel finishes low, Jolly Pumpkin it depends on the beer.. but a good amount finish low.   I see these terms being tossed around a lot, it would be good to back them up with some facts. "
1934,"Bad ""Canned Meat"" smell after bottling, and briefly mid-fermentation","I've had an ongoing problem for the last several months that never used to happen:  My brew smells pretty normal during fermentation, except midway through, it changes from the normal US-05 yeast smell to a ""canned meat"" smell, which is reminiscent of barley in soup.  It is only there briefly, and by the time I bottle, it's totally gone.  After bottling, and letting the beer carbonate, when I open a bottle, and then pour into a glass, that same smell is back again, and it won't go away.  The flavor seems decent, but if I belch, I can taste the ""smell"".  On rare occasions, it dissipates totally after 8-10 weeks.  I've never had this problem before, and it even happened with DME.  I mainly brew All Grain.  I'm not so sure it's an infection, since it always gets better, but it doesn't always clear up, completely.  The taste really isn't affected that much, either.  What is going on?  I've scoured the internet, but to no avail.  Palmer's book doesn't give any clues.  I use plastic fermenters, so should I just replace them?  They are in good shape.  The smell just ruins the beer.  I'm about ready to quit brewing!  It seems like I used a glass fermenter once or twice, and still had this problem.  Is it possbile US-05 isn't what it used to be?  As far as I know, I'm practicing good sanitation. "
1935,What's wrong with using finings?,I've heard a lot of folks complaining about the use of finings in beer &amp; one in particular claimed that commercial brewers stopped using finings once they had to start listing ingredients on the label of the product.  Is it just isinglass that puts people off?  Gelatin too?  Why? 
1936,Brewed with honey and the yeast is not working?,I did my first beer using honey last night and the beer is not bubbling this morning as it usually does. Is this normal? Should I re-pitch the yeast or not?  
1937,Commercial brewery house yeast,"I know a lot of breweries have a house yeast that they use, and in some cases it's their only yeast. I've also heard that most will only harvest up to six generations, due to weak flocculation and maybe even attenuation. I'm familiar with top-cropping and how they're harvesting the yeast, but how do they start anew once they've reached that 6 generation?  EDIT: And how would a homebrewer go about mimicking this process? "
1938,Secondary fermentation including carbonation in a Corney keg,"I am making my third batch of cider using juice from a local farm, so far its worked out well other than a persistent haze in one batch. I want to try and simplify / improve by process by removing a racking and priming step if possible. I would like to rack my bucket fermentation early at an SG that will ensure i generate sufficent additional CO2 in keg for the finished product. What calculation should I be using assuming I will run to total dryness? eg. If I rack at 1.020 and after the secondary ferm end at just below 1 what volumes of CO2 will be in the cider assuming I keep the keg sealed or an appropiate top pressure? Could I use this to produce fully sparkling cider for bottling? If any one has any insight, guidance or advise I would be most greatful. Kind Regards Arend "
1939,Which fermentation temperature should I favor?,"I am doing a dual brew this weekend. First up will be my Engine 97 Steam Beer (aka California Common - see recipe here: [website]Second batch will be another Jamil recipe - Chocolate Hazelnut Robust Porter (don't have the recipe handy, sorry). I was thinking of using the same yeast, since I have a bunch of slurry, but trying to ferment it warmer to get some esters (like, 68*F).  I have a chest freezer I can ferment both batches at once in, but I will obviously need to pick one temp or another. So do I go for 68 for the porter, allowing for some esters in my Cal Common? Or go 58, making the Cal Common happy but maybe losing flavor in the porter? Shoot for the middle ground of 63? "
1940,What gap should I set my mill's rollers to?,"I just received a Barley Crusher mill - is the default roller setting sufficient for most grain types, or do I need to worry about adjusting it?  Do you guys change roller spacing based on what grain you mill (i.e. barley vs wheat) or just keep it the same and crush away? "
1941,How do I take hop plants with me when I move?,"So I planted my hops three years ago and they've done well.  I'm planning to move next year (within the same hardiness zone) and I want to take my hops with me.  I'm sure whomever buys my house won't want the hops and I don't want to lose them.  How do I collect the crown to take it with me?  Can I take the whole crown, or do I need to clip rhizomes and start anew next year?  Should I dig them up in the fall after the bines die off, or in the late winter, or some other time?  How do I store them until planting time?  If I can take the whole crown, can I store it or must it be transplanted immediately like transplanting a shrub?  Can you offer any other advice on taking hop plants with me when I move? "
1942,Rauchbier smoke source,"What is the difference between using a nice smoked malt vs. maybe using some liquid smoke for making Rauchbier? Can you detect the difference in complexity?  Is smoked fruit woods (apple, cherry) better than smoke from say hickory or mesquite? "
1943,"Boiling Equipment (Burner, Pot, Wort Chiller)","So I am looking into upgrading the gear I use to do a boil.  Currently I have a 5 gallon stainless steal pot, I use an electric range to heat the water, and my kitchen sink to cool down the wort.  It works, but I have had problems with my wort boiling over lately.  I have tried putting less water in for the boil, then top up in the fermenter later, but this has lead to some scorching.  Not to mention that fact it takes quite a while to get the wort to a boil and even longer to cool it off.  The obvious answer is to upgrade my gear.  I know very little about boiling setups.  It seems propane is a popular choice, but anything that can boil water quickly and keep an even, controllable temperate I will consider.  Also, what should I look for in a brew pot? Are cooling coils for the wort worth it?  Amazon has some good deals, but I wouldn't mind giving a specialty home brew site my business either. I would like to keep it under $150.    Update  Thanks for all of the feedback. Amazon had a great combo deal with a propane burner, 8 gallon stainless pot, and wort chiller for [tex]225. So I went with a 10 gal pot (same brand just bigger and no shipping fee for the same price) and a Bayou burner.  I will get the wort chiller some other time.  I decided it was better to get some good quality gear, rather than go for lesser quality pieces that I know I will replace in short order. "
1944,Shipping beer to fellow brewers,"A few college friends of mine have started brewing beer recently and we were wondering what the best way to ship our beers across the country is?  Our ideas so far are:   Just bottle it, wrap it, and ship it Siphon off of secondary into a few 2 liter coke bottles, ship with the proper amount of bottling sugar in a zip-lock bag, and let them bottle it upon arrival   With the second idea we were thinking that it would be easier/cheaper to ship because the 2 liters are non-breakable.  It would also have the advantage of being under little to no pressure, which would be good if it had to travel by air I suppose.  Are there any drawbacks to this idea, aside from possibly imparting a cola taste from insufficient rinsing?  Are there any other ideas out there for shipping brews to fellow brewers? "
1945,First Time Brewing...am I doing it right?,"So I went to my local brewing store, and got a starter kit. It came with a 7 gallon fermenter, a siphon tube, a floating thermometer, bottle caper, bottle caps, bottle scrubber, and sanitizer.  By the way I have multiple questions. I know most first time brewing experiences are uneasy, but I was hoping someone could make mine slightly easier. I explained to the lady at the brew shop that I wanted to make a blonde ale similar to the one Sierra Nevada makes. She recommended a ""Cooper"" extract for my first time that would provide a similar beer. The directions say to simply boil it with the recommended amount of water and 1kg of corn sugar.  I did that exactly, then added the recommended amount of cool water to my (plastic) fermenter. I added ice cubes to bring it down to 70 degrees F. Once that was done I had read that it was more effective to ""prepare"" your yeast, rather than sprinkling it on in powder form.  By ""preparing"" my yeast, I sanitized a cup, added hot water, let poured the yeast into it, and let it dissolve for 10 minutes. After that I mixed it up, and poured it into the cooled wort.  I closed the lid and added the Air Lock. It has been over 24 hours, and I have not seen any bubbles, although I haven't been checking more than twice a day due to my schedual.  Everything was sanitized might I add. My questions are these. Did I make a mistake somewhere? How important is keeping the fermenting brew between 65 and 75 degrees? and do I need a second fermenter? "
1946,Pairing for Garlic butter shrimp and tortellini,"I was wondering if anyone had some advice on a beer to drink with a super-savory shrimp and tortellini dish?  Dish details: The shrimp are cooked in garlic butter, then the pan juices are rendered with either white wine or some of the boil water.  This is all tossed with the tortellini and parmesan.  The dish is very cheesy, rich, and savory.  I'm not sure what to serve with it, but I was thinking maybe a Belgian Wit?  Any ideas? "
1947,Does aging the beer make a huge difference?,"I made a Blonde Ale about 3 months ago, and it had a really bitter and strange taste to it. It was drinkable and ok, but not great. I thought the problem was that there was sanitizer flavor in my beer. So the next batch (Cherry Stout) I did all glass primary and secondary fermentation to mitigate the sanitizer flavor. The beer had a pretty much identical flavor to the young Blonde Ale, drinkable but not great. I generally followed the 1-2-3 rule (1 week primary, 2 weeks secondary, 3 weeks bottle), but moved out of the primary based on a the desired gravity reading, so the usual fermenting/conditioning time.  After my Blonde Ale had aged for 3 months, I tasted it again and it tasted amazing! I couldn't believe it! It was a night and day difference between the odd flavor it started out with and how it tasted after aging for 3 months. Is this always the case? Right now my Cherry Stout doesn't taste very well, but if I give it 3 months, do you think it will taste significantly better?  Does the same thing apply to kegged beers? Does it normally take a few months to produce quality flavor? "
1948,Are beer kits any good?,"I started my first homebrew a few days ago. I used a John Bull India Pale Ale beer kit made by Young's (West Midlands, UK). The airlock is bubbling away merrily and I've taken the lid off the fermenter and had a sniff - got a huge fizzy hit in the nose (won't get so close next time!) and can detect a general beery smell so hopefully all will be well.  Anyway, I was wondering what sort of result I might expect as a newbie from a beer kit (assuming no silly mistakes)? I'm not expecting to win any awards, but on the other hand, it's going to be a waste of effort if it's undrinkable.  TL;DR - Can a newbie make something drinkable or is it going to take years of experience?  UPDATE: Thanks for answers so far. Sounds like it could be better than I was hoping it might be! I'll come back and update once it's done and let you know how I got on.  Some extra info: The kit cost £10 and included yeast (in a sachet). The instructions were to tip the canned malt-extract into a brewing bin, add 1kg of sugar and add 4 litres of boiling water, so I didn't need much special equipment. Stir and top-up to 23 litres with cold water.  So, ingredients cost £11.  Equipment (so far):   £15 - Brew bin £2  - Bung and airlock £3  - hydrometer £3  - trial jar £3  - Bruclens steriliser (sanitizer)   UPDATE 2: Wow - it came out better than I expected, but pretty much in line with the opinions expressed here - that is, I don't think it was award-winning, but it was certainly very drinkable (all gone now!) I've paid money in pubs for stuff that wasn't as nice. I've got a second kit on the go now - will probably stick to kits initially, but will be back here for advice/info when I want to progress from there. Thanks for the answers and encouragement. "
1949,What is a swamp cooler?,What type of equipment do you need to build one? How do you use it? What are the realistic expectations of using one? 
1950,When to remove trub/yeast cake from a conical fermenter,"So if/when I eventually switch to using a conical fermenter, I assume I wouldn't want to dump the entire  trub/yeast cake at the bottom during fermentation. Do you typically wait until your ""primary fermentation"" period is over in the fermenter, and then dump all of the trub? If not, how much do you leave? How long do you wait before getting rid of some of the trub at the bottom? In most cases, would you completely avoid using a secondary and use the conical fermenter for the entire fermenting process? "
1951,"How do you characterize ""Breakfast Beer""?",What makes a good breakfast beer? Thinking of brewing something for an upcoming eggs and kegs event.  Any clones of Founders Kentucky Breakfast Stout out there? 
1952,Priming and bottling for a first timer,"It's been about ten days since I started fermenting my beer, and it didn't create bubbles in the air lock until day two or three. The air lock is still bubbling, should I begin priming and bottling? Also, my kit only came with a fermenter, not a bucket to prime and bottle with. The fermenter has a spigot at the bottom of it, could I just add the priming solution and then pour out of the spigot to fill my bottles...or will that include too much of the unwanted proteins and such? Please let me know your thoughts, being my first time, it's a little confusing....and at times frusterating. Thanks in advance! "
1953,Fermenator Question(s),"After 20 years of fermenting in glass carboys, I recently dove in and bought a Blichmann Fermenator.  I Scrubbed it according to the docs that came with it, and then gave it my usual BTF soak and air dry before brewing with it.  The first batch had a pretty godawful metallic or.. I don't really know how to classify it... harsh smell after 1 week in primary.  Same recipe I had just brewed successfully a month prior, sans the funky smell.  After a week I dumped trub, dry hopped for 2 weeks of secondary.  The smell remained.  It's not a spoilage smell-- after sharing it with other homebrew geeks we all agree it's not an infection smell.  It's pretty astringent, slightly metallic, maybe somewhat chemical.  Though my mash was only at 150º so I shouldn't have extracted tannins to give astringency.  The beer tastes fine, not great.  Anyway, when I popped the lid after 3 weeks, there was a layer of black scum on the sides of the fermenator just above the krausen ring.  Oily.  Not green or white like most mold.  The beer itself looked like... well... beer.  I ended up dumping the batch and brewing again.  This new batch has remnants of that smell, but not quite as bad.  It was a long road to get here, but here's the question, at long last:    is there something I need to know about fermenting in steel?  Does this funky smell blow off once it gets to glass or gets carbonated?  Or was I blowing it off before by racking/oxygenating and just never got to smell my beer at this stage? "
1954,"Fermenting, carbonating and dispensing using the same (corny) keg?","I Brew In a Bag and do no-chill, space and time are limited.  I just bought some kegging equipment and while looking at the Pico Brew project I noticed that one option in using their equipment is to dispense directly from the keg used from brewing and fermenting (step 6).  I figure I could save a lot of time in my own process by:   Transfering my hot wort directly from the boil kettle to the keg, using the keg itself as my 'no chill' container Fermenting in the keg letting the air come out from one of the valves (I do not need to see bubbles, but I guess I'll need to find a way to depress the ball locks so the air comes out) Force carbonating directly on that keg after fermentation Chilling and dispensing, dumping the first few pints of yeast/slurry. My loss may even diminish!   One single vessel, no transfers, no need to sanitize anything.  The only downside I see is the possibility of having the keg lines clogged with yeast and some extra work cleaning the krausen formed during fermentation after the keg is empty (dried out and likely stuck, a good soak in PBW should take care of it?)  Anyone has any experience on this? Any other downsides I have not identified? "
1955,"Water mineral additions, losses to mash, and evaporation in the kettle. I.e., does water lost to the mash result in a proportionate loss of ions?","Rephrasing my question:  I see three separate ways of calculating the final ppm of various minerals in the end product.  Say I begin with 9 gallons of DH20. After the mash, I lost 1.5 gallons and end up with 7.5 gallons in the boil kettle. After boiling, I lose 1.5 gallons to evaporation and end up with 6 gallons of wort.  Let's pretend I'm aiming for 200ppm of Sulphate. CaSO4 gives 61.5ppm of Ca and 147.4ppm of SO4 for one gram in one water. Therefore, 1.36g/gallon of CaSO4 will result in ~200ppm of SO4 and ~84ppm Ca (200/147.4ppm = ~1.36g CaSO4).  Do I multiply 1.36g by 9 gallons of water - my total starting water? This assumes both that I lost 1.36g*1.5gal to the mash and also 1.36g*1.5gal to evaporation. (Obviously salts don't boil off so this is incorrect)  Do I multiple 1.36g by 7.5 gallons of water - my starting water less that which I lost to the mash? This assumes that by losing 1.5 gallons of water to the mash, I am also losing 1.36g*1.5gal, leaving me with 1.36g*6gal CaSO4/gal.  Do I multiply 1.36g by 6 gallons of water - my starting water less that which I lost to the mash less that which I lost to evaporation? This assumes that the 1.5gal I lost to the mash did not also lose the 1.36g*1.5gal CaSO4, leaving me with 1.36g*6gal CaSO4/gal.  I'm reading Brewing Better Beer and Gordon Strong states ""Homebrewers should be aware that you don't have to put all the salts in the mash, and that not all salts in the mash carry over to the kettle."" He doesn't however make explicit that which I am asking -- namely if I lose X gallons in the mash do I precisely lose the ratio of salt to X gallons as well. "
1956,Rubber bung keeps getting out,"I'm using rubber bungs (with airlock) for my 5l glass carboys, I just got the carboys so it's my first time fermenting in them. I have a problem that rubber bung keep getting out because of the CO2 pressure from the fermentation.   How do I keep the bung inside? Are silicon bungs better for this stuff? "
1957,Adding yeast at the end of a long fermentation,"I just brewed an imperial stout partial mash kit and racked to secondary.  The kit calls for 3 1/2 months in the secondary fermenter.  Will there be enough viable yeast left at the end of secondary for bottle conditioning or will I have to add some fresh yeast?  If I have to add yeast before bottling, any suggestions?  I was thinking of using Danstar cbc-1-cask-and-bottle-conditioned-beer-yeast.  I don't want to over-carbonate. "
1958,websites that describe yeast flavors?,"changing the yeast is the easiest way to experiment with a recipe. I have my first brew about a week away from bottling.  so what's next?  there are a ton of websites out there, and I could use a good short list of websites about yeasts, and the flavors they impart.  I think i want to run the same recipe again but with a different yeast.  what websites are the best to trust ?  or feel free to recommend a yeast yourself ;)  it's a rye pale ale kit recipe with (brewer's best Rye Pale Ale): 3.3 lb Rye LME 3.3 lb Pilsen LME grains (steeped at start of wort) 8 oz. Honey malt 4 oz. Munich 2 oz. Vienna hops 1 oz Columbus 1 oz Citra 2 oz Cascade Yeast  1 Sachet &lt;&lt; i want to try changing this first.  Fermentation takes place @ ~ 75 degree Fahrenheit (high end, I know) and the air is very dry.  so lager yeast is out. "
1959,Looking for a WARM ginger beer,"recent homebrewer and even more recent SE member.  Hoping for a little advice...  I've been searching and searching for a ginger beer with a strong, warm burn.  I had some in Canada and have been unable to find anything close since, so I decided to try and brew my own.  I've seen some recipes that add jalapeno or other peppers, but that seems like cheating!  Is there a better way to increase the ""burn""?  I'm not looking for the quick citrus bite- I want the one that comes up 15s later and grabs you by the throat!  Is there a technique?  Does it come down to finding ""hot"" ginger?  Or is the ""float the peppers"" method the way to go?  FWIW, the recipe I'm about to try uses champange yeast (appeals to me b/c I don't want a sugary sweet GB) and adds a few slices of jalapeno to give it the burn (which, as I said, seems like cheating).  Thanks in advance! "
1960,Sterilising tips?,"More of an open-ended question really, I've been using Vin Classe Sterilising powder and find it hard to tell if my 25 litre fermenters are properly sterile, I've had a few issues with wine going off quickly once bottled but this may be the glass rather than the fermenter at fault?  I've just been using empty wine bottles to store a few bottles at a time and within 24 hours sometimes I've found the wine tastes a little off, would using different bottles/corks help?  Only really done a couple of batches before so it may well be other rookie issues  Any general advice would be greatly appreciated. "
1961,Overcarbed or gusher contamination('infection')?,Is there an easy way to detect whether excessive foaming / gushing is the result of over carbonation or a gusher contamination?    Perhaps a telltale taste or other indicator?  
1962,Airlock not bubbling,"So I made my first ever homebrew ale yesterday, transferred it to my fermentation bin and pitched the yeast.  After 24 hours at the recommended temperature there is a nice thick layer of krausen on top and if I listen carefully I can here very, very quiet bubbling within the container, but the airlock is barely bubbling at all. Tiny bubbles sit in the airlock but don't move.  Do I need to pitch more yeast or is this normal behaviour?   Anymore info required please ask.  On a side note, I have scoured the internet and read two books, but nowhere can I find if I should have removed hops prior to fermentation, so I left them in, is this okay/normal?  Thanks in advance "
1963,Measuring SG on small (3.5l / 1g) batches,"I do small batch brewing (3.5l-4l) and using hydrometer is a big pain for them, as I need to take very big amount of beer out to test it. I've learned to do OG readings with refractometer, but I get very wrong results when I do FG reading (after applying refractometer formula). Refractometer is very well calibrated (checking it before every measurement), but I get results like 3.1% brix, which yields very low FG results, like 1.001. That sounds unfeasible for ""normal"" yeast like US-05.  Am I doing something wrong when doing refractometer measurements? Are there any ""shorter"" hydrometers available, that would require smaller samples? "
1964,Will my airlock problem ruin my wine?,"I'm brewing a Barolo wine which is now stabilizing in a carboy with a bubble airlock fitted, the water from the airlock is being drawn into the carboy. Is this normal ? If not how can I stop this ? Will this ruin my brew ? "
1965,Yeast nutrients,"I've seen several beer, mead, and wine recipes that call for yeast nutrients. I'm even now following a mead recipe that calls for staggered nutrients. But my question is, what exactly are yeast nutrients? What is in these nutrients that isn't in wort/must that the yeast needs or wants? "
1966,How long does a white labs liquid yeast vial last once opened?,I have been using half of a vial of white labs liquid yeast for brewing 1 gallon batches of beer. How long will the second half last once I put it back in the frige? It had been allowed to warm according to their instructions.   Any other recomendations for using liquid yeast as a 1 gallon brewer? 
1967,Should I be worried about my bottles exploding?,"Alright, so this is my first batch where I came up with the recipe instead of using a recipe kit, and something seems to have gone wrong. Here are my brewing notes so you can see exactly what I did:    So, I brought 3 gallons of water up to a boil, then added all 13 pounds of malt extract, which actually almost filled up the 5 gallon kettle. After brewing, I added maybe 1 more gallon of water to the fermenter, then took a gravity reading. (It was a 6 gallon fermenter, but wasn't quite full and had a crap ton of sediment, so I'm guessing I had around 5 gallons) Here is where the first unexpected thing happened - my OG reading was 1.072, which seemed really low, especially since the calculator I used estimated 1.095.   I'm on a time crunch to have this ready for a homebrew beer fest on Feb 25, so I bottled it after 2 weeks in the fermentor. I assumed it would be done fermenting and did not even check to see if the airlock was still bubbling... Which obviously I would go back and change if I could. So we siphon as much beer as we can out of the fermentor, and end up with 3 gallons. Not exactly sure how, but there was so much sediment in the fermentor that it was hard to get clear beer out when we were near the bottom.   This is where I start to worry - we take a gravity reading and it is 1.040. Now I'm a little worried that there are still fermentable sugars in the beer, especially since I didn't check to see if it was still bubblin, and the calculator estimated FG at 1.027.   One more issue - I put in 3/4 cups of priming sugar, which is the amount for 5 gallons, and I only had 3.   So here is my question - should I be worried about my bottles exploding? Also, can you think of any explanations for why my OG was so low? It doesn't make any sense to me. And on the FG... Is there any way that fermentation could be done with it being that high? Thanks for any clarification you can give.  "
1968,How to avoid homebrew-cider to explode out of the bottle when opening?,"I'm in my first year making apple-cider from harvested apples.  The fermentation started 10 days ago. I let it bubble for 7 days and I filled some of clear juice it into a small bottle (using a Lightning type stopper) - just to see.  Yesterday evening I wanted to open the bottle to try. When flipping the stopper, 3/4 of the beverage spurted out. (I expected something like this and was outside). What was left was quite good, but didn't have any bubbles.  What did I do wrong? How to avoid these kind of explosions? How to stock cider into bottles correctly? "
1969,Can I increase the carbonation of already-bottled beer?,"I just made my first ever batch of beer, and it turned out great! The only thing is that my priming sugar calculation was slightly under what it should have been. I added 1/4 cup honey to a (finished volume) 2.5-gallon batch, and I should have been closer to 1/3 or 1/2 cup.  The beer is carbonated, but it could use a little more. Is there any way to increase the carbonation? I.e. by, in a sanitary environment, opening the bottle, adding a bit more priming sugar, and re-capping? Assume that I have enough head space to actually do that (I do, because I was afraid of my bottles exploding so I left a bit more than I needed to).  I'm happy with how the beer turned out regardless, so it's not a big deal. In my next batch I can just increase the amount of priming sugar. But bubbles are nice, so I'm curious: can I increase the carbonation of already-bottled beer? "
1970,Looking for ways to reduce trub,"More specifically: Some time ago I switched from fly sparge to batch sparge. My motivation was that I noticed quite a bit of channeling on deeper grain beds with the fly sparge. Batch is quicker and at least as efficient, but seems to generate a fair bit of trub. I'm guessing this comes from the fact that I have to settle the grain bed multiple times, and run off multiple times.   I vorlauf the friggin' bejesus out of it. I have a March pump and recirc the mash for at least a couple of minutes. Maybe some kind of inline filter would help me but I don't want to deal with the BS of having a stuck sparge because my filter is clogged.  My other thought is opening up the gap (currently 0.035) to something more like 0.050 so less of the malt gets powdered.  Yes? No? Maybe? What else? "
1971,Reducing the taste of yeast,How can I reduce the taste of yeast in my homebrew? Obviously filtering but are there additional options? 
1972,Why did I miss my high target gravity? By quite a lot. Is it just my brewhouse efficiency?,"I cooked up my first Double IPA recipe over the weekend but have seriously missed the mark with the target gravity. So much so it most definitely won't be a Double.  Target O.G. = 1.085 Actual O.G. = 1.050  Malt bill  The malt bill was as follows:    75%    Maris Otter   12.5%  Malted flaked oats   10%    CaraHell   2.5%   CaraPils   A volume of 30L gave me a rough required extract for 1.085 gravity of 6.66kg. After adjusting the weights for their efficiencies/max yield I came out with:                                 Weight      Max Yield    Actual weight Maris Otter           75%      4.995kg     82.5%        6.055kg Malted flaked oats    12.5%    0.833kg     70.0%        1.190kg CaraHell              10%      0.666kg     74.0%        0.900kg CaraPils              2.5%     0.167kg     71.4%        0.234kg   This gave me a total weight of 8.401kg. My mash and sparge volumes were:  Mash = 26L Sparge = 16L  Mash  The mash started off a little too hot and so I ended up doing a 150 minute mash. The readings went as so:    T = 0    temp = 72.7ºC T = 20   temp = 71.6ºC T = 40   temp = 70.1ºC T = 60   temp = 68.0ºC T = 80   temp = 66.5ºC T = 100  temp = 65.8ºC T = 120  temp = 65.4ºC T = 150  temp = 64.9ºC   After transferring the wort to the boiler, where it sat on at a low setting for a couple of minutes while I added the sparge water to the mash tun, I had a wort temperature of 68.4ºC and a gravity reading of 1.034. Adjusted for temperature using brewers friend it came out with a reading of 1.051. I was a bit despondent at seeing this.  My sparge after finishing had a reading of 1.017 and a temperature of 73.1ºC. Brewers friend only goes to 71ºC but it gives a rough gravity of 1.035.  There were 400g of hops in the boil/flame out. After boiling and cooling the wort I topped it up with about 3.5L of the leftover sparge water and a further 2.5L of water to top it up to 30L (I also used some of that sparge water to top up the boil). My end gravity was 1.050.  Brewhouse efficiency Writing this out I realise I did not adjust my recipe for brewhouse efficiency. However, assuming I did nothing wrong, that gives me an appalling efficiency of 58.8%. That is so bad I think there was something more to it. Had the gravity been in the region of 1.064 I could safely write this off as a failure to accommodate for the brewhouse efficiency.  Question So while I aimed for 1.085, after adjusting for a rough brewhouse efficiency of 75% I should have hit 1.064. I actually hit 1.050. - Why was I so far off the mark? - Are there any tips for consistently hitting high target gravities? "
1973,"Messed up West Coast IPA recipe, could dryhopping make it good?","My first batch, I followed a recipe using malt extract to create a West Cost IPA. The wording of the recipe made me invert the Hop additions...  [Edit] Instead of:   2oz of Centinennial at 0mins left in boil 1oz of chinook at 10mins left in boil 1oz of columbus at 60mins left in boil   I did :   2oz of Centinennial at 60mins left in boil 1oz of chinook at 50mins left in boil 1oz of columbus at 0mins left in boil   From my reading I realised it would be a very bitter beer with poor aroma... I estimated the IBUs at 105. Am I wrong? Will dryhopping with Citra can help my beer to taste something better than just bitterness?  The rest of the recipe:   8oz Victory Malt (steeping grain) 9 lbs Gold liquid Malt Extract 1 pkg Safbrew US-05 Dry Ale Yeast   Original Gravity was at 1.050  Thanks! "
1974,Blending different apple varieties for hard cider (uk),"Has anybody experimented with blending different varieties of apple for ""hard cider""?   Locally I have an apple variety called ""Blenheim Orange"" and also an unidentified cider apple. Using just the cider apple produces a very vigorous fermentation even at 20°C but the result is pretty bland. The B.O. apple ferments much slower and unpredictably but produces a more interesting flavour.   I'm trying a blend of the two this year and just wondering what success others may have had in blending eating / cooking apples for cider making?  Thanks. "
1975,How to fix too much water in wine?,"I am making wine per this recipe [website]I quadrupled the quantities to give me 18L.  At the point where I am supposed to add sugar and top up to 18L (after a week of extraction), I made the mistake of topping up first, then realising I hadn't added the sugar! Then by the time the sugar was added there is now about 22L.  So obviously I have too much water in the wine. What do I do here (if anything). Will this be a problem? (Will my wine taste too weak?) And if so What can I do about it? The obvious answer is to get out and pick more berries, squeeze out their juice without any more water and throw it in. But is this a good course of action or will I wind up making it worse?  Edit  The specific gravity is 1.110 after a day of fermenting "
1976,Bottled a Belgian ale not carbonating,"I used white labs abbey ale yeast - fermentation went well and flocculated quite a bit. I then bottled straight from primary. I noticed that not a lot of yeast went into the bottles which hasn't really happened before (usually there's a visible layer or sediment. Also doesn't help that it's quiet dark brown in a brown bottle.   Anyway, the bottles have been sitting for about 10 days now, so I cracked one open to see how carbonation was going and nothing...completely flat. Tried another bottle same thing - bottles are near new and were sanitised so that's not the issue.  If only a small amount of yeast got in the bottles - should they still carbonate ok given more time or am I destined for a flat batch?    Update: It is carbonating, just very slowly. They needed some rotation, a warmer room + time. 4 weeks and beer has low levels of carbonation  Update 2: Most bottles have carbonated at 7-8weeks. I noticed some do not have a fine yeast layer on the bottom so could have somehow not gotten much. Another thought for the overall slow carbonation, is that I didn't mix/turn the bottles an hour+ after bottling when the sugar had dissolved. Other than that, it may be but down to super malty beers? "
1977,Crusher/Destemmer care: Chain maintenance,I want to take care of my crusher/destemmer and am noticing I washed off all the grease from the chain.  What lubricant can I put on that chain before I pack it up for next year?   Bike chain lubricant? Olive oil?   You can sort of get a feel for the size of the chain in this product photo:   
1978,"Time lapse, adding yeast a week late","After getting my grape juice in a bucket, I added the sugar and wild yeast killer. Didn't have the yeast to add before sealing it up. Checked the next day, it has a purple foam that collected on top. It's been a week, I should be getting my yeast in the next day or two.  The bubbler(airlock) on top bubbles at least once a minute.   Should I skim the foam that might still be collected top of juice?   Or stir it in when I add the yeast tomorrow? "
1979,What is causing an off flavor associated with yeast or trub?,"I brewed a New England IPA and kegged it.  The first few pours after moving around the keg come out very cloudy, with a few small leftover hop bits and likely some yeast in suspension.  These pours have a distinctive off flavor that I can best describe as metallic.  It also produces a slight burning sensation in the back of my throat.  However, later pours that come out clear have no sign of this off flavor and are citric, fruity, and delicious.  What is causing this flavor?  Is it in any way dangerous?  EDIT: after further research, I've seen this described as ""yeast bite"", and apparently it's common to NEIPAs.  I'd still like to know what it really is (what chemicals are involved) "
1980,Re-using Caps in new Batches,"I have noticed that after I open many of my beers, my caps still look perfectly intact. I.e not fractures stresses and are relatively clean still.   It seems like such a waist to just chuck it.  Does anyone out there re-use theirs, and or what would be a good reason not to re-use caps?   I know the are cheap. But is that really the only reason to use new ones? "
1981,"Fixing a ""Watery"" beer",I brewed a V2 of this NEIPA I was trying to improve and it's currently sitting in the keg awaiting bottling.  I brewed on new equipment and I had less boil off than expected so I had maybe a .75-1gal more sparge than I needed. I also tried a tablet of Whirlfloc to help with my sediment issues.  All of those things combined gave me a less hazy beer and has me worried about a watered down beer.  It's been carbonating at 30psi (room temp) for a week now and I'm ready to bottle. Should I even bother with trying to fix it?  I've read that adding half a pound of maltodextrin can help bolster the body but I'm not sure when to add it or if it is even the right choice. Do I portion it out per bottle? 
1982,1/4 MFL to 1/4 MFL does not fit 1/4 FFL to barb. Why?,"For my co2 closed transfer setup, I was expecting to be able to screw those 2 items together (male to female): [website][website]But the adapter (1/4 MFL to 1/4 MFL) is too big to fit the 1/4 FFL to barb.  Why? Shouldn't 1/4 MFL fit properly 1/4 FFL? Do I miss something here?  Thanks in advance. "
1983,Camping and Brewing,"So I have a big bumper pull camper that I travel around the country with.  I was thinking about a camping trip with some buddies and was considering the implications of perhaps starting a brew while we were waiting for the pork shoulder to come out of the smoker.    I am curious if anyone ever tried to start a brew while in the woods.  The camper has a full kitchen, to include a propane burner stove and an electric/propane operated fridge.  I would do this somewhere with full hookups to allow for all the waste and washing.  But I usually use water that I purchase in 2.5 gallon containers.  The way I figure, everything should be the same as it is at home except for one big thing.  Lets say I start my brew on a Saturday.  I will only be out there for a couple more days before it is time to pack up and go home.    I will need to transport my fermentor at about day two or three.  Will that be a problem?  I will probably use some sort of cooler strapped into the back seat of my truck to transport the carboy back to the house.  This should help with light and temperature fluctuations.  But it could be a couple hour drive and I am concerned with all the moving around.  The sediment should have time to settle again in my cellar once I get home, but could I oxidize the beer.  Will this be too risky?  Any suggestions are welcome and feel free to shoot down my idea in the first place.  Thanks again. "
1984,"Bottles lost pressure, can I rebottle?","I was being cheap and used empty water bottles to bottle my beer. They worked okay on my 1st batch when I used 1 carbonation drop to prime. That 1st batch didn't have quite the carbonation level I wanted when using just 1 carb drop, so I tried the 2nd batch with 1.5 carb drops.  The 2nd batch had been sitting for 2 weeks and I went in to check them. About half have lost pressure, looks like weak caps. Is it possible to pour this uncarbonated beer into new, legit bottles with more carb drops and save it? Will the addition of oxygen totally skunk the beer? Will the yeast continue to eat sugar and produce CO2? "
1985,Can Elderflower cordial ever become alcoholic?,"My partner made Elderflower cordial with elderflower, sugar, lemon, a very small amount of cider vinegar and water about 3 months back. Last night I drank about 3/4 pint of it instead of booze as I am trying to go dry for September. This morning I feel as though I have a hangover? Can the sugar have turned to alcohol? It was ver sweet. Help? "
1986,Splitting batch for secondary fermentation over Vanilla,"I just got a 5 gallon batch of an LME Imperial Stout Recipe to start its magic.  My plan is to split the batch for secondary fermentation.  I plan to move one gallon into a separate jug to finish off over vanilla beans and champagne yeast.  Any input on how to split the yeast between the two vessels?    I was thinking about pumping it all into the 5 gallon carboy and pitch the yeast then pumping a gallon ut afte the first day, but I really don't know if that will transfer the proper amount of yeast into the vanilla variety.    How can I accomplish this best? "
1987,What went wrong with my root beer?,"I just tried my first batch of root beer. I used a recipe from Wellness Mama. I don't drink but I think it tasted alcoholic and gingery at best. I let the ginger bug ferment for 2 weeks (I waited an extra week looking for bottles), making sure to feed it sugar, ginger and stir daily.  I followed all the steps with all the ingredients. It was carbonated (big pop when opened) but somewhat clear. Like I said it was alcoholic tasting and gingery, fairly sharp. I'm not sure where I went wrong. I plan to make another batch tomorrow if I can isolate the issue. I am hoping since I used more than half my ginger bug and refilled it, the new stuff won't be so potent. Should I add more of a particular ingredient to ensure a root beer flavor? Like should I add more sassafras?  I'd really love to get a good drink out of this, I've invested a bit into it and it would be a shame to quit.  Thanks so much for any input. I can take a picture of the drink if that would help or answer any additional questions.  -Phil "
1988,overcarbed bottles recapped and then recapped again?,"I brewed a high gravity american double (stout), fermentation went well and I gave it enough time to presumably take care of most of the fermentable sugar. Then I added 2 lbs of pureed strawberries and blueberries for every gallon, gave it another week or so and bottled.  When I bottle conditioned, (I believe) the added fruit messed up my carb calculation and the beer was super over-carbonated (side questions: has this ever happened to you? can added fruit do this?)  I waited for about 6 weeks, confirmed that the carb level was unpleasant and then did the recapping trick to lower the carb level.  My question is this - would you ever recap twice? In other words, if I am still unhappy with how carbonated this beer turns out, do you think I could just recap the bottles again? "
1989,"Where to age mead, bottle or secondary fermenter?","What method is best to age honey wine?  There is a similar  question where someone suggests that bulk aging is faster. Has anyone experienced this?  Edit: I found another similar question, one answer indicates that bulk conditioning is more convenient since it offers more control over the bottled product, but does not mention anything about which method offers a faster rate of aging. "
1990,My OG is 1.030 and I'm only at 4 gallons?,I topped off at 4 gallons rather than 5. Am I wrong for thinking this is low despite not adding more water?  I'm now a day after fermentation began. I plan to do a secondary fermentation. How much sugar should I add during the second fermentation for an 5-6% ABV beer? Thanks in advance!! First time homebrewing! 
1991,Fruity saison: to use juice or not to use juice,I'm thinking of brewing a Saison and make it very fruity. I want to have grapefruit like aromas and flavor. I've been reading up and some people suggest using juice others recommend using zest.  I have no experience with juicing or adding zest so I have a few questions:   should I use juice or zest  how much should I use? (fermenter size is 15l)  in either case do I add it to the boil or to primary/secondary how do you sanitize zest/juice?  
1992,Can I add yeast energizer and sugar to my secondary fermentation?,"My OG might be a little lower than expected. I'm not sure if my reading was accurate since I took it a day after fermentation began via the spigot at the bottom of my bucket. Reading was 1.030. In a few days I'm transferring it to a secondary fermenter, where I will be adding more pumpkin. Can I add an energizer? And can I also add brown sugar or something like that to increase my ABV? "
1993,Rye malt and ferulic break,"I am planning to brew sahti, which is supposed to have clove (phenolic) and banana (esters) flavors. They are said to be possible to make with baker's yeast, which I believe is possible for the moment.   My question is whether I should make a ferulic break during mashing to enhance phenols from rye malt (which is about 30% of fermentables) or is this technique only viable with wheat malts? In other words: does rye malt can be source of ferulic acid and if yes, is the ferulic break temperature the same as for wheat? "
1994,Brewing process for sweet apple cider,"I've recently been experimenting with different cider recipes and all of the results have been quite dry with minimal sugars left after primary fermentation. I personally like dry ciders so it's not an issue for me, but I've been asked by family to brew some sweeter cider (closer to Somersby).   I've been trying store-bought cider as well as apples ground and pressed at home. O.G. measurements are sitting around 1.050 for most of the different starting ciders and I've been getting slightly less than 1.000 for my F.G.. From what I can tell, almost, if not all, of the sugars are getting used up in the primary and leaving a very dry cider. I've used champagne yeast and dry ale yeast (Safale S-04) with similar results.  What ingredients/process do I need to use to brew a sweet apple cider?  My initial thoughts were to shop around for a low attenuating yeast or to blend the dry cider with unfermented cider after the primary, but I'm not sure if this is off in left field. Would it be better to try and stop fermentation early? "
1995,I brewed a tart red wine,"I'm relatively new at adjusting pH levels in my brews. As a result, I went the wrong way in my adjustment and produced a very tart red wine. Can I unbottle it and adjust accordingly? And if so, what's your advice on handling that effort? "
1996,Laboratory Scale beer Production for Microbiology and sensory evaluation,What is the easiest and best way  make opaque beer in the lab? The  beer has to be made in such a way that it will be able to be tasted. Besides using hops what other alternatives could I use for me to increase the bitterness in the beer? 
1997,How much DME do you use for a 5 gal. batch?,"I'd also like to add Dark Egyptian Cane Sugar (to a porter), and Honey (to a nut-brown ale). Amounts of these? Add during boil? Goal is 5 - 7% alcohol content.  Thanks! "
1998,"Hop Bags, What are the Advantages?","So I am sort of new at this.  I ordered some hop bags as an add on item but have not yet used them.  In the past I always dropped my hop pellets right into the boiling wort.  But I plan to make a really clean and light colored hoppy ale.  I plan to use Citra in both the boil and dry hopped.  In the past (without using hop bags) I have noticed a substantial ring of hops in my fermentor just above the ready to bottle beer.  I have not had a hard time siphoning the beer out and leaving the hops behind, but this is my first dry hopped beer and I anticipate those may be more detrimental to clarity.  So what are the advantages and disadvantages of using a hop bag?  Does everyone use them?  Will it help my clarity? Will Flavor be affected?  Are they more suited for the boil or dryhopping? "
1999,Old malt extract (liquid) for a yeast starter,"So by old I'm talking maybe ten years! I was cleaning and found quite a bit of LME gifted to me with all my original homebrew equipment. I was mid-swing into the trash can when I wondered if maybe I could use this old stuff for yeast starters? A good boil should clean up any nasties in there right? It's been sealed in a plastic screw-top jar that was taped and some in a can. It sure would be a penny saver if I could use it, what do you think? "
2000,Determining beer quantity when FG and weight are known,"In making the assumption that given the final gravity and physical weight of beer (or any liquid for that matter), that you can find the total quantity, what is the calculation necessary for determining the total quantity of beer in either pounds or kilograms when the gravity of the beer is known within 2 gravity points gravity accuracy (determined by a hydrometer) and one pound weight accuracy (using a digital scale)?  Also, what impact will CO2 from carbonation have on this calculation? "
2001,"I bought a small 1 liter CO2 gas tank for carbonating drinks, where could I start to find a regulator valve for this tank?","I need to modify this tank with a valve/pressure controler so I can use it to carbonate drinks.  Images of the tank included.  I would order online but i have no specification to get data from. What kind of store would sell valves like this? Hardware store, Plumbing store?  The supplier did not have any additional equipment for these tanks. Their main bussiness were large 50l propane tanks with different valves.  Thanks and sorry if my question is out of place here. I use stackoverflow a lot and just wanted to try my luck in some other of their sites (stackexchange guitar site helped me a lot).  In perfect case someone could link some online valve that would fit similar tanks so I have something to reference to.  [website][website][website][website]Thanks! "
2002,How long can milled grain be stored?,"At the rate that I'm going, I'm doing a homebrew roughly every second weekend.  (Fun!)  I will end up with a small stock of hops, and yeast I can keep around in the fridge for a while if I buy a few extra vials, but I'm wondering about milled grains?  I don't have the space or inclination to mill myself.  If I want to pick up 5-10 pounds of base grains and a small stock of specialty grains, and have them milled by my LHBS at time of purchase, how long can I expect them to stay fresh in a bugproof container in a cool, dark, dry corner of a closet?  I found this question about grain storage, but the asker's express intent is to take it to his LHBS and mill on brewday.  Does milled grain have a shorter shelf-life than unmilled? "
2003,bottles not fermented after 3 weeks of conditioning. Good or bad?,"It's been three weeks, and my impatience has had me crack one bottle on days 7, 14, and now 20.  There's no carbonation in these bottles, and it doesn't appear to be getting any better over the weeks.  I pop the top and if I'm not paying attention, I won't hear the escape of CO2/O2 come out, it's that faint.  At this point, should I continue to let them sit in bottles?  After a few more weeks, if they don't carbonate, what are my options?  Is it even worth the effort to go through and figure out how to siphon them out and back in?    To add a bit more context to the situation: After I racked it off primary and into secondary for a month, I had just started to wash yeast, and was curious if I could wash the yeast that came off secondary fermentation and bottling.  So after taking the beer out of secondary and into bottles, I harvested the yeast in the carboy.  Yes, I am no aware that harvesting yeast out of secondary is not nearly as good as harvesting off primary, but at the time I didn't.  Before that realization occurred, I had actually pitched one of the yeasts into a batch of beer after giving it a good shot at success with a starter.  That harvested yeast did not ferment, and I had to pitch other yeast instead.  Not sure how much context that adds as to the health of the yeast in suspension in the bottles, but I figured I'd mention it.  TLDR: The yeast harvested off the beer from secondary fermentation did not ferment another batch of beer made after harvesting, despite using a yeast starter. "
2004,Total Volume of Yeast Starter in Regards to Evaporation from Boiling Wort,"Today I did my first yeast starter. I purchased the 2000mL flask and DME from northernbrewer, and it came with instructions for doing both 1000mL and 2000mL batches. It suggests 1000mL for 5 gallons of wort with OG of up to 1.080.   For 1000mL, it says to put in 650mL of water and 1/2 cup DME.   For 2000mL, it says to put in 1300mL of water and 1 cup of DME.  So I meant to do a 1000mL starter but ended up putting a full cup in, so I added enough water to equate 1300mL.  I did have a boil over (!) which will disrupt this question, but I thought it was relatively small.  My final liquid wort volume was 800-850mL. After pitching in the liquid yeast, the final amount rose to 1000mL.  So my ""2000mL"" starter is now half the volume.  It is impossible that the boil over I had took out one half the volume.   However I did a strong boil which most definitely added to the loss from the evaporation.   1) Does it matter at all if a 2000mL starter ended up as 1000mL of liquid? As long as I have the full cup of DME, the total volume shouldn't matter, right?  2) If not, Is it best to do a very light boil instead of a rigorous boil, so that the final amount of liquid will be closer to the amount you started with? "
2005,Yeast Starter Vortex Size,"I've read online that the size of the vortex in a yeast starter does not matter. Why is this true?   When I was experimenting with water yesterday, I created a monster vortex (very cool) and could see air bubbles screaming all over the water; turning the vortex down into a baby vortex resulted in no air bubbles screaming all over. Some people say that the point of the vortex is just to keep the yeast in suspension which will make contact with the air in the vortex. Others say you need a monster vortex so that the air bubbles can scream through the solvent and aerate the wort. Which is correct?  If you simply stir your 5 gallons of wort, it will not aerate much at all. The reason you splash it is to introduce oxygen bubbles into the wort, which aerates it better. Given that everyone agrees on this, why would a small vortex with no screaming air bubbles be able to aerate the yeast starter?    EDIT: Well I figured if the point of the vortex was to aerate the yeast-starter, why not use my aeration-stone and oxygen tank? So I hung the stone in for 60 seconds which created a lot of foam, but the stir plate got rid of the foam.  It made me think: now that my yeast starter is aerated, why should I care about the size of the vortex (given the assumption that the greater the vortex, the greater the aeration)?  Why care about the vortex at all (given the assumption that vortex size has nothing to do with aeration) ? "
2006,"How big of a Noob am I? Or, What to Do when You spill a stir-bar in your 5-gallon bucket","So 24 hours ago I made my first yeast starter, ever. I built a homemade stir plate.   Today I was feeling like a boss because of this and simply dumped the 2L flask into the 5gallon wort I spent all morning making.   PLOP  OH NO MY STIR BAR IS NOW INSIDE OF MY WORT  I probably should have jumped on stackexchange to see whether or not I could just leave it in there for the primary fermentation, but I jumped in the shower again and scrubbed my right arm with tons of soap with very hot water, jumped out of the shower and plunged my arm into the bucket in search of the stir bar.  I found it, like a boss.  1) So did I just destroy my batch?  2) If I am noob enough to drop the stir bar into the 5-gallon container again, should I just let it sit for a week and recover it after primary fermentation, or should I get it out?  3) How big of a noob am I for a) losing the stir bar in the wort and b) reaching in their with my hand after pitching yeast ? "
2007,How might trub effect taking original gravity?,"For the beer that I brewed this past weekend, I finally remembered to take an Original Gravity reading.  Unlike my previous last three attempts, I actually had a little more than my target 1 gallon, so I poured a little into the hydrometer.  However, the wort was somewhat sediment &amp; trub heavy at that point.  Not to the point that the hydrometer was bottomed out, though.  But a small layer settled down, and there was some floating stuff.  Would this effect the reading?    I found this question and answer about taking a reading, but there didn't seem to be a conclusive answer.  Perhaps, looking back, I should have allowed the floating stuff to settle, or swirled the tube to help it settle.  However, my instinct is to say that unless the hydrometer is sitting on sediment, then the reading will be the same, since the hydrometer works on buoyancy.  (I will float the same amount in ocean water, whether it's at the beach or over the Mariana Trench.)  Is this correct? "
2008,Can forced air be used effectively to cool a second chamber from a keezer?,"Would it be possible and effective, without causing undue stress to the keezer, to temperature control a second insulated chamber? I would like to be able to control fermentation temps and/or run casked ale (during the summer) at around 50°F. The Keezer is set around 1°C and is fairly large (fits 4 kegs, hump space contains bottles &amp; CO2).  I'm mainly concerned with the fact that you're moving air, not heat per se. Is there a better way to do this (without spending a lot of money)? "
2009,Brewing with a concentrated wort,"I'm living in a condo with no outdoors space and a mere 12"" clearing on my stovetop.  One-gallon all-grain batches are easy, but I'm trying to figure out some logistics for going larger... aside from buying a portable induction cooktop for use elsewhere in the kitchen!  I've read a number of recipes that call for ""topping off to X"" in the fermenter (carboy in my case).  What are reasonable limits to making a concentrated wort (say, for a non-imperial, non-hop-bomb beer)?  To what extent can I load up my pot with grain and produce the initial wort, then boil, chill, and add water?  Hopefully this doesn't broaden the question too much, but are there any notable drawbacks to brewing like this?  I found this answer about full wort boils, but the comments refer to extract, whereas I'm thinking about all-grain. "
2010,Wine Brewing on Lees (Sur lie),"I have recently learned about Light Lees Protocol and was wondering if someone would be able to relate some practical anecdotal experience.  Is there a substantial difference in quality if you separate the wine from the lees after a time instead of letting the wine ferment in bottles?  For example, what would happen if I let the must sit on the lees for three or so months?  Second, would the lees' taste continue to mature after being removed, or is the prevalence you experience at tasting during secondary indicative of the final result?  Thanks in advance. "
2011,Flat beer. Not enough priming sugar?,"I'm new to this blog and brewing. Recently i put down my first Coopers Real Ale. All went well, great flavor but flat to very slight carbonation in bottles. 1.5 tsp in 1250ml and .5 tsp in 750ml bottles. Is this too little? I wanted to avoid making bombs. It was in primary for 6 days after it had finished working. Any advice out there? Cheers G "
2012,Going Below Optimum Yeast Temperatures (For Ale in Particular),"So I understand that going above the optimum yeast temperature specified is a bad thing and will cause major off flavors.  But what happens when you go underneath it?  For example, I am currently using a Wyeast 1214 Belgian Abbey from NB which specifies the optimum temperature range as 68-78*F.  My tendency is, around 3pm, when I start to feel warm, to grab 5 frozen water bottles and throw it in my swamp cooler.   I just rigged up a temperature monitoring apparatus this morning and have been measuring the temperature all day. When I started to feel warm, the temperature in the swamp cooler was only 72F, and now after I threw in 5 frozen water bottles, the temperature in the swamp cooler is 60F (now it is actually 59.8F!) (now 57.7F)  What are the consequences of my actions for doing this to an Ale? "
2013,Calculating carbon dioxide production during fermentation,"I know yeast ferments sugars into alcohol at a predictable rate, but is the same is true for carbon dioxide? Since I know the amount of sugars fermented though my gravity readings, shouldn't it be possible to calculate C02 yield? Does anyone know a formula for doing this?   I ask purely out of curiosity.  "
2014,Honey addition to dunkel,I have a dunkel recipe and I wanted to know if I could simply add honey to the wort making process to add flavor and raise the OG. I am not planning to take anything out as substitution. Are there any problems I could face with this? Will the yeast be fine? 
2015,"I have a keg, now what?","A co-worker of mine had a roommate move out and leave his brewing stuff behind, including two 5 gallon kegs (pictured below). Co-worker ended up giving them to me for free.   Obviously you need a CO2 tank, and connectors, but what size CO2 tank and are the 'Ball Lock Connectors' the right one in general/these specific ones? Can I use the same cleaning/rinsing chemicals on these (PBW/StarSan)?  Since I am a complete noob to the world of using my own keg, what else do I need?   "
2016,Oily Beer - Can I get the head back?,"I'm refining a recipe for a chocolate wheat ale. I'm using 2 pounds of chocolate malt, which seems to be exceptionally oily, effectively killing the head. It still has carbonation, just no head.   Any ideas on neutralizing the oils? Or maybe sub the chocolate malt for something similar? "
2017,High OG content for yeast,I had a higher than expected OG in my homebrew. It was estimated to come out to 1.060 but instead ended up at 1.076. The back of the yeast I used said that it is good in a brew of up to 1.060 OG. The yeast seems to still be alive and kicking after 12 hours. Should I still be concerned? Is there anything I should do? 
2018,overheated the mash by a long shot,"I asked before and got some help and have done some reading since. The temp in my mash jumped from 175 to about 195 after I put the lid back on. How much damage did I do? Some things I've read since suggest that it may be okay since the density of the grain(and, in this case, about 8lbs of cooked pumpkin) may have kept the center mass of the mash somewhat insulated. Opinions? There were some spices(cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, cayenne) added so it may mask any tannins. "
2019,What should I expect from re-mashing malt extract?,"I've heard Jamil Z. from the brewing network recommend re-mashing malt extract with a handful of two/six row to improve ferment-ability. Since the extract producer is attempting to please a larger customer base, they choose a middle of the road mash temp and thus a middle of the road ferment-ability. If making a high gravity beer, increasing ferment-ability of the extract could greatly improve the finished product. I want some empirical data on this topic before I attempt.   Questions:   Did this work for you? Did you lose extract in this process? (i.e. did the grain suck up sugar, etc.?) Based on your experience would you recommend the process to others?  "
2020,How to use Tart Cherries,"Lately I've been trying fantastic beers brewed with tart cherries. Where is the best place to source this product? Do I buy as whole fruit, frozen fruit, puree? When and how should I add this product, and what affect will different approaches have on my beer? "
2021,Rager Hop Formula Clarification,"I'm coding up some personal brewing software, and I'm confused by the explanation of the [Rager Formula][1]   [1]: [website]What is meant by the term ""boil gravity"", Is that the gravity when the hop addition is made?

Does anyone have any advice, tips or pitfalls to avoid? "
2024,Confused by malts!,"great site. I am a total newbie at brewing (used a Mr. Beer kit a few times with success), and recently got a 2 tier homebrewing system for Christmas. I got a prepackaged ""American Amber Ale"" kit as well as I didn't want to run straight to my own recipes, I wanted to walk slowly and learn the process.  But I am confused. The kit came with Dry Caramel malts (you have to steep in a bag first), then it came with a liquid malt extract, and a dry malt extract. You have to use all three of these, plus two types of hops to create the wort. My question is, why all three types of malt? Is that for flavor/color/etc? In basic brewing isnt it true that you simply need a grain, hops, and yeast? obviously that would be the simplest of simple.   Sorry if this is too easy of a question, I am just starting out. Thanks! "
2025,When to add DME if you miss your starting OG?,"My family was very nice to me this Christmas and I got a bayou classic burner and an 32qt. pot with 2 ports and a bazooka screen as well as an immersion chiller.  I had built a 10 gallon mash tun over the summer (I was doing partial mashes for the last couple batches) so now I am ready for  all grain full boil 5 gallon batches.  Only thing is I have never done this before (can't wait though) so I don't know the efficiency of the system.  I picked my first recipe, my fiance loves the rogue hazelnut nectar so I am going to attempt to duplicate that as best I can.  My question is this, when do you measure the OG to determine if you have missed your mark?  I purchased my ingredients along with 1 lb. of Light DME.  I only need about 1 cup of that for my starter so I figure if I miss my OG I could use the rest of that to hopefully get to where I need to be.  So, when would I measure the gravity of the wort to determine if I need to add the DME?  Do I check it immediately after the I have sparged (pre-boil) or do I check after the full boil and hop additions?  If the later is the case obviously I would need to boil a small 'wort' for the dme so how would I calculate how much I would need to use?  BTW: here is the recipe I think I am going to be using (any suggestions are also welcome): [website]Totally psyched for all grain brewing (or 95% grain brewing if I need this DME after missing my mark)! "
2026,"What is a ""blonde"" beer, and how do you make it?","I recently bought a 6 pack of Shiner Blonde, and just loved the taste of it. What differentiates a blonde beer from others, other than a lighter color and flavor? Also, how do you make a blonde, and does anyone have any great recipes to experiment with? "
2027,Homebrew sanitisation in a Pinch,"So it's that time of year where none of the local shops are open (at least in my area) and I am itching to put on a new brew but haven't got any sanitiser.  I thought some Napisan (I believe AKA OxiClean - sodium percarbonate for washing clothes) might be useable but my research shows otherwise.  What can I find around the home that I can use to sanitise my gear?  It's mostly plastic so I don't think I can use heat treatment.  I usually use no-rinse but I doubt I'll have that luxury!  If applicable, what steps will I need to take to treat after sanitisation? "
2028,Transporting fermenting beer,"I have 4 beers I need to transport (I'm moving), 3 of which are currently aging.  One of them is currently on tap.  I don't think I'll worry too much about it.  The other three are wild ales, one is kegged, the other two in carboys, each with about 1 year of age.  I'm worried about the effects of splashing, specifically contamination and oxygenation, does anybody have any experience doing this?  I'm also worried that disrupting the pellicule will cause issue.  The 2 beers in carboys are pretty sour, but low alcohol, I'm planning of adding some dark malt extract and repitching some ale yeast to bring up the body and abv, so I'm thinking I can possibly suck up some of the oxygenation with refermenting.  Also I know some bugs actually like oxygen, so maybe they'll help too.  The 1 kegged beer is already carbonated - I've been having a glass every month or so to see how the flavor changes over time, could transport be a non-issue with this? "
2029,Calculating boil volume in partial boil?,"I'm an all-grain brewer but I haven't done an extract batch in years (or an all-grain one in over a year) and want to do an extract IPA this week. Looking at the various software and calculators, they don't seem to account for partial boils, just final batch size. I want to boil at about 50% volume, then top off with cold water. How do people calculate this in advance? I was hoping for something other than the hash-marked measuring stick method.   Are there any calculators or software that account for partial boils and give you total water needs up front? Oh, and god forbid, include temps (flameout wort plus refrigerated distilled water = ?°F). I like my final wort right at 65°F, ready for dumping into the fermenter.  I've always found Beersmith's water calculator to be non-intuitive by the way. "
2030,Airlock re-sanitization after minor blow-off,"I had some minor blow-off enter (and exit) my airlock during the most active part of fermentation. The krausen has since gone down significantly, and there is no worry of the airlock getting clogged.  The vodka, however, has turned a light brown due to the blow-off that entered the airlock.  Should I be worried about this? Should I remove, resanitize, and refill the airlock? Or is the trade-off of introducing oxygen into the carboy while doing this a greater concern? "
2031,Pilsner vs 2 Row,"I've searched around, but I still would like an elaborate review on the difference in taste between these two base malts.  Only interested in North American varieties, also.  I'm not sure what ""grainy"" tasting means, either.  Is that generally looked on as good or bad?  I've read Pilsner is more ""grainy"" tasting, is this true?  Which one is more malty?    Which one is more ""clean"" tasting?  Can I substitute Pilsner for APA, Blonde, and American Wheat beers?  I get away with 20 minute AG boils with 2 Row.  No DMS, full hop utilization (you simply boil hops for 2-3 minutes separately in a pint of water, then dump into wort after hot break).  So, will I not be able to get away with boiling Pilsner for only 20 minutes because of the DMS issues?  Like I said, no DMS with 20 minute 2 Row boils.  Awesome beer, too! "
2032,Adding water before bottling,"Ok. Sorry if this has been asked. I really did try to research it. LOL  I did my first batch of American Amber Ale, and made a few mistakes. I didn't take an initial gravity reading, and I think I kind of ""half assed"" measuring the amount of water to add to bring the brew up to 5 gallons in the primary carboy for fermentation. (I have since measured out 5 gallons on my primary and secondary carboy).   When I racked it to my secondary, the brew is sitting about a little under 4 gallons. Hmmm. Took a reading and it seems to be where the recipe calls for in gravity and alcohol content.   Question... when I go to bottle, should I add extra water to the priming sugar to bring the levels closer to 5 gallons? Not for taste, but to stretch my brew as far as possible? Or should I leave it at 4 gallons and hope for the best?  Live and learn! "

2034,Carbonation gone wrong?,"I was trying my first all grain brew yesterday when I realized that the beer was almost flat, which is weird because they spent about a week inside the bottle. It's a belgian golden ale and I've added about 10ml of a primming solution of 80g of sugar diluted in about 450ml of water (used an online calculator) for 33 cl bottles. What exactly has gone wrong? Was the yeast already dead at bottling or there wasn't enough sugar?  "
2035,What can have caused my mead to have the taste of yeast?,"I brew my first mead one month ago. I've put 1 dose of honey for about 3.5 of water. Ended up with a 2 liters of must in a pet bottle. I've put 10 grams of yeast (the entire sachet). Since i started, one month has passed and apparently there is no more fermentation. So i siphoned it from the pet bottle in two glass bottles. I just took a sip of the mead and i noticed a very distinct taste of yeast. What can have happened? Did i put too much yeast? Or is it normal and the taste of yeast is going to fade after i siphoned it from the main container? "
2036,Did I kill my Ginger Bug?,"I was just wondering if anyone could tell me whether or not I should keep feeding my ginger bug or start over. It was bubbling nicely the first three days, but now it seems to have gone flat. It still has a pleasant smell and doesn't appear to have any mold on it, so I'm kinda tempted to drink it/make a de-carbonated soda, and start over again fresh. Do you think it will recover if I just keep feeding it/burping it? Also, can I just drink it straight or do you think that will make me sick? Anyway, thanks :) "
2037,How long is too long in the secondary?,"How long can I keep a beer in the secondary before it won't be able to be bottle conditioned?   How can I tell if it has been too long and need to pitch fresh yeast to bottle condition?  This question gives a general answer but the answer is a general guideline.  Do I just put it in the bottle and hope?  In theory, there would be some yeast still in suspension for quite a while and I would be able to condition but it would just take longer.  I am looking for a more specific way to make the determination other than waiting and opening flat bottles of beer for a while. "
2038,Brewing beer - Flat unpleasant after taste,I finished brewing my first batch ever and when we tried it today for the first time it had a flat and unpleasant after taste which I can only describe as lack of taste.

2040,I added too much dextrose to my wort,First time brewer here. Me and my girlfriend received a home brew kit for Christmas.  The recipe called for 2 lbs of liquid malt extract and three lbs of dry malt extract. Along with hop pellets and a little irish moss. after putting the wort into the fermentation bucket and a week later I came to realize I mistook the 3 lbs of dry malt for 3 lbs of dextrose (corn sugar).also bubbling has ceased. Any suggestions or ideas on what we should do? are we going to get bottle bombs? Should we ferment longer? Please help!  
2041,How much recycled yeast to use?,"Morning all,  I am just getting into re-using my yeast and have a question.  I wash it as per the YouTube advice that I found (haha) and it seems to store pretty well so far. I have tried it in one batch so far and I put in about half of the yeast I got out of a previous brew, (which was a huge amount more than I put in).  I brew in 50 litre batches, so what would anyone recommend/guess as a good amount of yeast to pitch into this amount of beer?   I normally use 2 x Wyeast smackpacks and my English Pale Ale I am using the recycled yeast in, is generally about 1058.  Should I put in the same amount as with fresh yeast?   Cheers for any thoughts!  "
2042,Can I use Glucose in Place of Brewing Sugar?,"Can I use glucose in place of brewing sugar, at any stage in the brewing process?  (This is my first ever attempt at brewing so I'm a little clueless I'm afraid)  I'm currently making a beer kit and had a 1KG bag of brewers sugar to fill my bucket. That's been bubbling away for a few days now and I've just realised I need more sugar for the keg. I went to a local beer making shop to pick up what I thought would be a standard product for a beer making place to have, however the rather batty lady who served me said in the 45 years she's run the shop she's never once had it in stock as it's not needed and apparently no one has ever asked for it before. Instead she gave me a bag of glucose - it was only a couple quid so I took a punt.  Is she right and that it doesn't matter, or shall I pick up some brewers sugar online? I've read topics about different forms of sugar and I just can't find the answer to this specific question. "
2043,Nibs and vodka question,I'm hoping to get some confirmation on what is probably a stupid question.   I'm getting ready to rack a chocolate coffee milk stout and am going to be using nibs for the first time. I understand soaking them in vodka for ~2 weeks is ideal for a lot of reasons so that is the route I've gone.   My question is- do you add in all of the soaked nibs + vodka? Or do you drain the vodka and only add in the soaked nibs? 
2044,Should yeast be washed or just stored in the beer?,"The answer to this  question suggests yeast shouldn't be washed, is that really the current consensus?   what if I'm brewing a different style? Won't the trub affect taste? Lots of hop residue there. Dry hopped beer? is yeast in this case harvested from Krausen, primary or secondary? I usually only do primary, so lots of residue in the trub.  "
2045,On using a stainless steel tea bag to hold the hops while boiling,"We are going to brew a Maibock next weekend and would like to substitute the whirlpool with a a metallic tea bag that holds the hops (pellets) while boiling.   We tried a smaller metallic tea bag with boiling water and the finest parts of the hops mixed well, while the thickest parts were retained inside the tea bag.  Before the fermentation keg we have another filter in place anyways.    Is this a good/bad bad idea?  Did someone already try this and can share their experience?  "
2046,Bottle conditioning beer without sugar,I'm just about to embark on my first brew with my dad.  He mentioned that he may include half a tea spoon of sugar into each of the bottles to prevent it becoming flat.  What are other suggestions to avoid adding processed sugar to a bottle whilst still maintaining that liveliness?  ------- Edit  I have found this: Do I Always need to add Sugar when bottling?  Sorry for the duplicate post. 
2047,Was my mash pH okay? Should I be adjusting it?,"I am still new to brewing: First attempt with Christmas gifts used a refill kit that turned out to be partial - resulted in stout that tasted fine but is very weak. Second attempt is due to be bottled later this morning. This second attempt is a ""North of England"" brown ale LME / grain kit.  I've been reading quite a bit from John Palmer's ""How to Brew"" which seems to be a pretty complete guide, and I'm reading a lot about water. I've managed to get the local water reports (Irving,TX - water supplied via Dallas). Using the calculators inside the back of the book, I'm coming up with a mash pH of 5.7-5.8. This seemed a good match for a brown ale.  I measured the mash with brewing pH strips (as I'm starting out, I'm wary of investing in too much expensive equipment upfront - I can get a pH meter later if necessary). Okay pH strips aren't the most accurate, but I came up with a result more in the 5 - possibly 5.4 range. This is way off the bottom of the scale in the book!  I guess my question is, is it possible the mash was really that low? Or are the papers really that inaccurate? Of course the mash was a brown colour (as were the indicator colours), and the papers have a 0.4 resolution in the scale indicator. Could mash temperature have influenced the reading?  If it helps, the kit was 50/50 Amber and Dark malts with speciality grains mostly Caramel (3/4th) and lesser (1/8ths) special B and chocolate.  Looking forwards, I plan to brew quite a few English porters (a type of beer I like), but will not start these until Autumn (however much I like a good porter, they're not for a Texas summer!). I'm assuming I should adjust the chemistry for these? Before that, I intend to brew paler beers - I've just ordered an ESB kit, and after that I was thinking of more of a summer pale ale. "
2048,How long can bottles be considered sanitized?,"At the moment I'm sanitizing bottles by submerging them in sanitizing solutions (and letting them fill of course), and then running them through the dishwasher with no detergent/etc. The dishwasher doesn't have a 'sanitize' option so this last stage is probably superfluous...  I probably need to buy a bottle tree to store the bottles. Would it be okay to sanitize the bottles a day beforehand? or should I really keep to doing it a matter of minutes /hour before bottling?  (I'm physically washing the bottles shortly after they are opened and are still wet) "
2049,Water For Robust Porter,"I've been chatting with my local city water tech. Based on what she sent me, the numbers work out as...   pH- 7.5 Ca- 20.1 Mg- 12.6 K- 1 Chloride- 5.4 SO4- 11.5 Hardness (CaCO3)- 103 Alkalinity(CaCO3)- 99.6 Bicarbonate (CaCO3)- 123.3   I guess they can all be rounded to the next higher or lower number... :)  So, my question is.. for brewing a dark beer.. I want to try Jamil's Robust Porter.. and later, an Oatmeal Stout.   With the high(er) Bicarb, do you boil, cool and siphon to reduce the number? Or would you do an acid addition to the total water? Or would you do any dilution and add salts? Or build your water from RO? Or do you do nothing? Given any choice.. what YOU would do.. THEN what would you add as salts for that water for the dark beer?   If you simply built your water from RO, what would you add for 5g of all-grain? Or, if  you simply added ""x"" ml of Phosphoric or Lactic Acid.. what would you then do.  Thanks for any help.  Bill "
2050,Effects of air lock water back-flow,"I have just brewed for the first time. After bottling,I noticed the air lock, which I hadn't removed, was missing its water. I'm assuming the week-old air lock water was sucked back into the brew as I was filling bottles from the bottom. Could this contaminate the brew? Should I throw it all away and start again? "
2051,Water level low on airlock. Is it contaminated?,"About 48 hours into my ferment I noticed a significant amount of liquid (about an inch) is missing from my airlock. Reading up on the subject I've realized that water was probably sucked into my brew due to a temperature change overnight.  I used plain, unsanitized tap water to fill my airlock so I'm worried my batch could become contaminated.  The water level on my airlock (three piece style) has dropped to just below the little holes near the bottom.   Does this mean my airlock is no longer providing a seal?   I'm not sure how long it has been sitting like that so thats another worry for contamination.    Should I refill it with more tap water?  I'm worried that if I do more water could be sucked in, providing more chance for infection.  Sorry for all the questions first batch here. "
2052,Why do people purge kegs before force carbonating?,"What is the point in ""burping"" a keg right before force carbonating it? When the co2 hits the keg during carbonation it is going to provide a protective blanket to any air above it.  I am confused about this practice and I believe it is redundant. I can't offer evidence because I always burp the keg myself. :-)   If you want to serve cask ale at home with a beer engine and not have oxygen spoil your beer there is a device which can be connected to your co2 tank which will shoot a burst of co2 into your keg each time the beer engine is pumped and oxygen is shot into your keg. This co2 will protect your beer from the oxygen and this way you can have cask ale at home without having to finish it all in one go. The fact that this works should be reason enough that burping is unnecessary.   Here are a couple of videos showing this device:  Beer Engine at home - Jump to 4:04  Northern Brewer Cask Ale video - Jump to 5:40  And here is the device on Micro Matic: Cask Breather "
2053,When to add fruits or berries into mead?,"I'm getting a bit confused with adding fruits or berries into mead... Some recipes suggest adding it into the secondary (like purés). On other side there are multiple videos of people fermenting fruits and berries in the primary...  Is there like a general standard or guidance? For example I have fresh apricots, frozen black currant berries and a can of strawberry puré. When I'm making a mead, when do I use those?  Thanks, guys.  "
2054,Effect on a low gravity boil size on IBUs in the final batch,"This question is a follow-up to the original one regarding the effect on boil size on IBUs. (Effect of boil size on IBUs) I understand that the boil gravity tends to lessen the utilisation of hops and the extraction of alpha acids, because the sugars are just taking up the place.  Now, what would be the risk / downside of boiling hops beforehand in (near) water (none or small amount of brewing sugar / malt added), then letting the hopped water cool down and adding malts, or malt extract? In particular, would it not just make a lot more sense, when brewing with an unhopped malt extract, to simply boil hops in a small amount of water with a just little bit of extract added to it?  To illustrate a specific case: I have an unhopped malt extract, hop pellets, and a pot of only 6 litres for boiling them.  Also very importantly, how would one calculate the IBUs when implementing such a procedure? "
2055,Adding boiling wort on previous batches yeast sediments,"I've been using kegs as fermentors and 'no chill' vessels.  With pressurized fermentation I'm getting so much less sediment and krausen, and actually I purge the yeast before and after transfer, so ending with not so much thing inside the kegs.  I've seen people using yeast nutrients or baker's yeast on the boil to help fermentation, so, I was thinking:  if I let my fermentors waiting pressurized and then fill it again with another boiling wort, what I will get?  How yeast trub, break material and krausen things left by a previous batch could act in a new batch?  My surmise is that the boiling wort will help dissolving krausen, kill every yeast cell inside the keg, and this material will easy fall down until the end of fermentation and maybe my fermentation will be more ""healthy"" with all this nutrients. In the bargain, the cleaning of a fermentor could be skiped.  What you guys think?  It's worth the effort on trying this aproach or its just a badtrip inside my head? Thanks! "
2056,Will a stout faucet give me the same effect as a beer engine?,I know that stout faucets were devised as a means for emulating the cask ale experience but how close are they? Can I skip getting a beer engine at home and just get a stout faucet and beer gas?  
2057,Belgium Tripel with Sorachi Ace Hops,"Good evening, home-brewing community!   I'm seeking a quick advise. I'm brewing (or attempting at least) a Belgium Tripel. I'm pretty solved on grains. Still trying to figure out the hops.  So, I plan to put 1oz Perle @60min, 1oz Saaz @30min... and I have 1oz of Sorachi. Would it make my tripel out of style if I use Sorachi like @5 mins? Or even break by 0.5oz to dryhop my tripel with it after 6 days? "
2058,Packaging for competitions,"Quick question regarding packaging for competitions...   Usually samples should be submitted in 12oz bottles with caps... is it the case for Belgium styles? Some beers have to be conditioned in bottles, which may create some potential additional fermentation... Is it allowed to use corks instead of caps?   For example 18C (Belgian Tripel) ""traditionally bottle-conditioned"" according to the 2008 Guidance. Should I use corks with muselets?  Thanks, guys! "
2059,Drying freshly picked hops,"My buddy works at a community garden, and they have a fence full of Cascade ready for the picking. He estimates a few pounds of hops are on the fence.  What has to happen between him picking them off the vine, and me putting them into my boil? How do we get the hops ready for brewing?  I think I'm going to do a Pale Ale with the one hop, a la [website]"
2060,Preparing Yeast,"I've been reading the How To Brew book, and it (amongst other sites) recommends rehydrating yeast before pitching it.  [website]Some sites suggest adding a teaspoon of sugar with the yeast, others just seem to recommend hydrating. All of them seem to suggest that after 30 mins or so, you should see some visible bubbling etc in the yeast.  I've done about 9 extract brews so far, and tried rehydrating the yeast on the last 3 or 4. However, whenever I try this I never get any response from the yeast - it just sits there looking exactly the same as when I first put it in the water. (Have tried with and without adding sugar). Usually after an hour or so, I'll give up and pour it into the beer which so far has worked fine every time anyway.  Is this step worth doing? Should I be seeing more happening in the yeast than I am? Or am I just not being patient enough?  Cheers  Dave  "
2061,Under-carbonated bottled beer,"I just opened up a couple bottles of a brown ale I just brewed, and there is much less carbonation then I had hoped.  The beer was in the primary for a week, secondary for 3 weeks, then primed and bottled for two weeks before tasting.  Is there anything I can do at this point?  In the future, what should I be looking out for to prevent this? "
2062,How important is temperature when adding pectic enzyme?,I added pectic enzyme when the must of my rhubarb wine was too warm after I misread the directions in the book where I found the recipe. I didn't notice until after the next day when I had already pitched the yeast. Will the pectic enzyme still help the wine clear? Should I re add it again at some other point?wine 
2063,Initial fermentation temperature for saisons?,"It's summer, and that means that my basement is too warm for English and American ales, but I did make a really fine French farmhouse ale (saison) at fermentation temperatures of about 75F.  I've heard tell (via Stan Hiernymous) that I can get better results by starting the fermentation off at a lower temperature (60F) and letting the fermenter slowly come up to temperature.  Has anyone done this before?  How long do I need to keep it cool before letting it warm up? Are the results worth it? "
2064,What flavors can I expect with a late/whirlpool addition of Columbus hops?,Columbus is such a high-alpha variety that I find I can only use very little of it for bittering.  I have a pound of these things and I would eventually like to get through them.  Has anyone used Columbus as a flavor or aroma hop?  What can I expect? 
2065,Checking for CO2 leaks,"If you have an at home draft system, how do you check for leaks in the CO2 side of the set up?  How often do you need to check for leaks? "
2066,Cleaning out beer lines,How often do you need to clean out your beer lines when using a home draft system? What type of cleaner do you use?  Can I leave sanitizer in the tubing when a line isn't in use? 
2067,How long do sanitized bottles keep?,If you sanitize a bunch of bottles and store them upside down on a tree or in a box (still upside down); how long can you store them like that before you feel the need to resanitize them?  Is there a better way to store them to keep them sanitary? 
2068,Detecting differences in the type of whiskey used to soak oak,"I'm about to add oak chips to my scotch ale. I was thinking about what sort of scotch to soak the chips in before hand. And then I thought, how much does it really matter?  At what point can one tell the difference between types of whiskey an ounce of oak chips were soaked in, when they've been sitting in 5 gallons for a while? For example, if I use the exact same kind of whiskey, but one is a 12 year and one is an 18, can you tell? How about Jim Beam vs. Jack Daniels? Jim vs. Johnny? What about scotch vs. bourbon?  "
2069,Ported carboy vs. siphoning?,"I'm considering purchasing a couple of these plastic ported carboys. From reading the description, it seems that I'd be able to rack directly into secondary and/or bottles without the need for siphoning.  Does anyone use these and can anyone recommend for/against the use of ported carboys as opposed to siphoning?  Thanks! "
2070,Secondary Fermentation In Bottling Bucket,"I have a Hefeweizen (Wild Flower Wheat pg 135) in the fermenter that is ready to be racked to the secondary.  The recipe calls for 5 days in the secondary, however the only secondary fermenters I have are plastic.  I have read that plastic fermenters are a poor choice for secondaries because they are oxygen permeable. Should I worry about this?  If not, could I simply use my bottling bucket for secondary fermentation, there by saving myself a step before bottling?  I have never used a secondary before, so I would like to try it for the experience.  However, I don't want to skunk my beer either. "
2071,Secondary or Bottles,"I currently have a stout (my 2nd home brew) in a secondary fermentor (glass carboy).  Once it reaches FG, what are the advantages/disadvantages of leaving it in the secondary to condition vs bottling right away (or FG + x days)?  Obviously, the secondary buys me time to empty enough bottles but is there any impact to the beer (assuming it ages the same amount of time prior to consumption)?  If I wait too long will the bottles take too long to condition?  If I bottle too soon do I lose any benefits of the secondary?  Thanks. "
2072,Re-use the mini kegs that are used in 'Krups Beer Tender' for home brewing?,"For me, these 5 liter kegs seem like the perfect device for storage as well as remaining fresh when making beer.    I understand there is a way to remove the top piece of the mini keg with some type of key?  Once removed, what do you clean them with? and then how do you re-pressurize the keg?   "
2073,Infusing a beer with grapefruit,"I was recently at a beer festival and one of the breweries (Fulton) had a delicious pale ale that had been infused with grapefruit. I asked the brewer how they did it and he told me that the night before when they kegged it, they quartered a bunch of grapefruits, scored the peels, and threw them in the a bag in the keg.  I have 10 gallons of pale ale that I need to keg soon, and was thinking about doing this in one of the kegs but I don't want to destroy 5 gallons of perfectly decent beer. This is where I need your help.   Is this safe to do if the whole keg isn't going to be drank the next day? Are there any sanitization precautions I should take before just throwing a bunch of grapefruit into my keg? How many grapefruit do you think would do the trick without being overpowering? Is this just a plain bad idea?  "
2074,cold conditioning saison then bottle conditioning,"I brewed a high gravity (1080) saison and am planning on cold conditioning it in secondary at 32 degrees x 2 weeks, then bottle conditioning it.  I am wonder will the cold conditioning make all my yeast die?  Will I need to add more yeast when I bottle?  If so, how much? "
2075,Best Crown Capper,"Just capped my first batch of beer (Wohoo!).  When I invested in my equipment though, I think I was a bit too frugal with my capping tool - I have a hammer on crown capper. It seems to have done the job (hard to tell at this stage if the seals are good, but they seem OK), but it was pretty hard work capping 64 x 330ml bottles with it...  What recommendations can anyone out there in homebrewland make for a better capper (considering value for money) - 2 handled capper (mid-range cost)? Bench capper (high-end cost)... or should I just persevere with the hammer on capper (cheap-as-chips)?  Any suggestions appreciated...  Cheers, Perk. "
2076,Glucan rest necessary,I am brewing all-grain and have in the past always held a glucan rast when mashing. I am trying to speed up my brewing process and that rest of course slows me down quite a bit because of the heating up afterwards. Has anyone had bad experiences without glucan rests? Do you think a glucan rest is necessary and if so with all malts or just with some (e.g. wheat)? 
2077,Which apples make the best cider?,"So I'm going to start making wine from grapes this year.  To that end, I just picked up a grape crusher and a press.  With those toys, I can also make cider.  There's an orchard near me that grows dozens of varieties of apples.  Which ones make the best cider?  I know, ""best"" is subjective but I'm sure there are some types of apples better than others.  Should I go ""straight varietal"" or should i use a blend of apples? "
2078,Should I use finings when brewing a White/Weiss/Wheat beer?,"My latest brew is a Belgian White beer - a Hoegaarden stile beer.  I don't have the equipment to rack this beer so I intend to bottle it after about 3 weeks in the brew barrel.  This style of beer is usually a little cloudy in the glass, but my dilemma is whether I should be using finings with this brew.  Anyone with experience with this style of beer? Should I use finings or would this ruin it?  Cheers. "
2079,Tips for my first Lager,"I'm planning to make my first batch of lager beer, and I chose the vienna lager style. But I have never made a lager before, so I want some tips! Since I have just two fermenting buckets but only one fits in the refridgerator, I'm planning to make use of just the primary. How much time do you recommend for fermentation (and what temps), and how much time for lagering?  Here is my recipe:   Ingredients: ------------ Amount        Item                                      Type         % or IBU       2,00 kg       Vienna Malt (6,9 EBC)                     Grain        37,74 %        1,25 kg       Pilsner (2 Row) Bel (3,9 EBC)             Grain        23,58 %        1,00 kg       Pale Malt (2 Row) Bel (5,9 EBC)           Grain        18,87 %        0,75 kg       Munich Malt (17,7 EBC)                    Grain        14,15 %        0,30 kg       Caramel/Crystal Malt - 10L (150,0 EBC)    Grain        5,66 %         16,00 gm      Brewer's Gold [8,00 %]  (60 min)          Hops         16,3 IBU       15,00 gm      Fuggles [4,50 %]  (10 min)                Hops         3,1 IBU        15,00 gm      Cascade [5,50 %]  (10 min)                Hops         3,8 IBU        2 Pkgs        Saflager W 34/70 (Fermentis)              Yeast-Lager       What do you think?  Thank you! "
2080,Sarsaparilla beer?,"I was enjoying some craft sodas with some friends wile brewing a saison recently, and the idea of a sarsaparilla beer occurred to me as a not terrible idea. My instinct is to go with a pale ale (or IPA?), but maybe a stout or porter would work well too.  Has this been done before? When should I add the sarsaparilla (boil, post-boil, secondary, etc.), and in what form (extract, dried roots, etc.)? Does it make sense to add the other ingredients typically included in sarsaparilla soda (like sassafras, licorice, and wintergreen)? "
2081,What is on top of my wort? Mold? Lacto?,"I just opened the top of my scotch ale bucket, and it looks like there's mold inside. The recipe is pretty standard, plus some oak chips soaked in whiskey, in a muslin bag. What is this?  Edit:  Some people have suggested it might be lacto/pedio contamination, which wouldn't be terrible. Does it look like that? The second picture is better.  If it is mold, is there any saving it? If it's souring, what's the best way to age it, and for how long?    "
2082,Rotten eggs aroma from fermenting beer,"my Vienna Lager apparently finished fermentation, I took some beer to measure the FG and I perceived a strong rotten eggs aroma coming from beer, I know it's common with some yeasts. The question I have is: is it ok to start cold condition (lagering)? Or I should keep fermenter around 13C for some days to get off the rotten eggs aroma?  Thanks in advance! "
2083,What to expect when making mead?,"I've been brewing ales for almost two years (extract plus specialty grains), and I want to try my hands at making a mead. What should I expect to be different in the brewing process? Will there be a violent initial fermentation? Is it more sensitive to temperature changes? Is the honey more likely to burn to the bottom of my brew pot than malt is? "
2084,Brew day notes template,"   Possible Duplicate:   What is the best brewing log sheet to use?       One of the things I'm guilty of being terrible at is note taking. I know I should keep track of temperatures, times, tastes, and a bunch of other stuff. But I'm bad at it.  What are the most important things to keep track of? Do you have a template? "
2085,Making a Yeast Starter,"It seems that there are varying opinions about the size your starter should be.  What is the basic rule-of-thumb for 5 and 10 gallon batches?   How much water should be used? How much malt/malt extract should be used? How much time should the starter have to develop, and does this vary depending on the method (coke bottle with the occasional shake vs. stir plate)? What characteristics can too much/too little yeast yield? Are these amounts different for dry yeast, smack packs, and vials?  "
2086,Is Mixing Yeast OK?,"Say I wanted to make an ale which has some of the banana characteristics of a Belgian yeast, but also wanted some of the citrusy flavors of an American ale yeast. Could I achieve this by making a starter which is half Belgian yeast and half American yeast (or maybe some other ratio)? What results should I expect from introducing two (or more!) strains of yeast in the same batch? "
2087,How to add spices after the boil,"I'm planning to make a few spiced ales from my batch that's bubbling along right now, and I'm wondering what the benefits and drawbacks are to adding whole spices to the secondary as opposed to making a spice extract with vodka or bourbon?  I'm thinking of things like cinnamon sticks, nutmeg shavings, peppercorns, orange zest, and vanilla bean.  Are certain spices better when added certain ways? "
2088,Is my lager done fermenting? More yeast?,"I put my lager in the primary fermenter roughly 30 days ago.  The original gravity was around 1.060 and 5 days ago when I took a reading it was at about 1.013.  Today it's at 1.012 - so it doesn't seem to be moving much.  I'm not sure if it's supposed to get down farther?  I do not have a good lagering vessel (it is fermenting in plastic), so I was planning on priming and bottling it after primary fermentation and then lagering it in the bottle.  I think it's probably ready to go (tastes great), but I'm worried that one of two things will happen - either it's not done and it will overcarbonate, or enough of the yeast have died that it won't carbonate at all.  Advice? "
2089,Too much Irish moss?,"Following inspiration from this question, I've set myself up with equipment to brew one gallon batches. The idea is to brew small batches to get a solid recipe down, then scale up to a larger batch.  Now, a 5 gallon recipe calls for 1 tsp of Irish moss (according to package directions). If I scale linearly to my one gallon batch, that's 0.20 tsp of Irish moss. I don't think I can be that precise with my measurements. If I err and use too much (0.25 tsp, for example, 25% more than what is called for!) what will be the side effects? Will my beer be ""too mossy""? "
2090,Aging a naturally carbonated ale that was bottled from a keg,"Okay, let's see if I can keep this question brief--I have a lot of followup questions that go with this so it may be difficult.  Background:  Last year I decided to start doing an annual Birthday Brew Day Barleywine, wherein I'll brew a barleywine each year on my birthday and age it for years to come (for as long as I can keep them in stock...we'll see how long it goes).  Last years finished off at 10.1% abv, while this years batch is at 9.7 % or so (currently in the secondary).  Context:  I HATE BOTTLING!!!  No, seriously, I really f$#%ing hate it!!! So, I keg all of my brews, and occasionally fill bottles from the keg using a technique that prevents oxidation and preserves proper carbonation levels.  More Context:  Conventional wisdom says that for a beer to be truly ""cellar-worthy"", it must be unfiltered and bottle-conditioned so that the living yeast can continue to develop flavors in the beer as the years go by.  Questions:    If I keg the beer, and later bottle just under half of the batch off of the keg, will the beer condition and mature in the same way when I cellar it?   I'm assuming that if I force carb that too much yeast will be knocked out of suspension for it to mature in the same way--is this correct?  What's the scientific explanation? I'm thinking that I'll add priming sugar to the keg, seal it up, let it carbonate naturally, and then bottle some time later.  Will this solve the force-carbing problem, assuming there is one?  "
2091,"Yeast or not to yeast, that is the question","So this is the third year I am making home made wine from a combination of red (75%) and white(25%).  In the past the person in which I purchased from had a big industrial blender of sorts and gave me back a product of appox 70%juice, 30% grounded up seeds, skin, etc. Which after mixing for appox 10 days, then separating liquid and making air tight and starting sugar to alcohol process for 90 days or so.  BUT this year he bought a new machine that was more like an industrial press, that gave me appox 95% juice only 5% seeds, skin, etc. Its going to make the separating process much easier for sure but I'm concerned that without the skin in there, maybe I will be losing on some of the yeast..??  I thank you all in advance as I really depend on this, currently living in a country that does not allow alcohol , so I need my homemade:)  "
2092,Belgian Candi Sugar - CONFUSED!,"I've been reading about making some Belgian Candi Sugar for a Piraat (Belgian Tripel) recipe I want to make and finding some inconsistencies about the techniques.  People talk about using citric acid and this is backed up in this Inverted_sugar_syrup article and says cream of tartar is fine as well. I found mention that if you want clear BCS then just drop table sugar in the boil kettle and that heat will do the conversion... BUT the lowest temperature I've seen listed for triggering the conversion is 240°F (115°C) which won't be achievable. Stove top cooked sugar can reach these high temps though.  So I found the-how-to-for-making-belgian-candi-sugar.219960 which leads to a PDF published by Beer Brewing Radio which states using Diammonium Phosphate which when I search online is described as a fertiliser but also is used as a Yeast Nutrient. Reading about it as a fertiliser I can see that there's an increase in pH over time, but how does it compare with the acidic levels of Citric acid or cream of tartar.   Can anyone say definitively which one I should use? I have cream of tartar in the pantry, but I'm not sure how much to use, the Beer Brewing Radio PDF says to use 1/2 tsp of DAP with 1 cup water and 2 lbs sugar, but how much cream of tartar of citric acid does that translate to? Is it worth just buy some Yeast Nutrient and follow this recipe to the letter? "
2093,Staggered sugar source addition: before or after racking?,"I am currently set up to use a modified recipe for a sparkling oaked acerglyn with the following adjustments:   Reddit user Balathustrius's SNA schedule using Fermaid K, Fermaid O, and DAP Additional honey added to the must prior to pitching A bourbon soak to sanitize the oak spiral 1 gallon of apple cider added at some point during primary or secondary Lalvin 71B yeast, which has an ABV tolerance of 14%   Having analyzed the sugar content of the dark robust maple syrup, I found that the must would initially (based on step 2) have a relatively low specific gravity and might turn out somewhat dry. However, the recipe also calls for staggered addition of the maple syrup one week prior to racking. Would this second syrup installment be sufficient to somewhat back-sweeten the mead or would it trigger secondary fermentation and continue to be fermented into alcohol? I'm assuming since the maple syrup wouldn't appreciably change the volume of the must, the must is already approaching peak ABV and wouldn't change much despite the addition of sugar. However, I really, really want this recipe to be at least semi-sweet. Should I add more honey to the must initially or will the collective maple syrup / apple cider additions do the trick?  That said, when it comes to adding the apple cider, should I do this before (i.e., at the same time as the second syrup installment) or after racking? I have heard that in racking and ditching the collection of lee at the base of the carboy, 90-95% of the original yeast population is being removed. I fear that adding apple cider will heavily dilute the alcohol in solution without fermenting much if done so after racking. I don't mind some dilution, but by adding a gallon of apple cider the ABV could dive from 14% to 11.6% which I would ideally like to avoid.  Finally, I would like to retain the sparkling aspect of this recipe. How long should I wait after the addition of the apple cider before pitching the corn sugar and bottling? Trying to avoid any bottle bombs if at all possible.  EDIT: Considering the already diverse flavor profile, I don't want to smother the finer notes with cider. How much cider is too much for a five gallon batch? Could I carbonate it using the cider alone? "
2094,To ferment or not to ferment for no alcohol,"I am making ginger beer. I’m using basically raw ginger and honey and fermenting with bakers yeast. I’m getting somewhere between 2% &amp; 2.3% ABV in testing. I don’t want any alcohol in the ginger beer as I want my kids to drink it. As I see it I have two options:   Pasteurize : After fermentation then pasteurize to remove alcohol. But there will still be alcohol present and it’s not as effective as one thinks I believe, so have no idea how to test for sure.  Don’t Ferment: Make Cordial, Keg and force carbonize.     Question: If I follow option 2 won’t my ginger beer taste different? Doesn’t the fermentation step add the flavor by the yeast producing byproducts?  "
2095,Growing edible brewers yeast?,"I want to grow brewers yeast that I want to as use as supplement, get various nutrients and NAD+. Which brewers yeast strain is easiest and best to to grow for this purpose? What medium and supplements for yeast I may need? "
2096,are partially filled bottles ok?,"I just wanted to ask if someone had similar experience. I brewed a white stout, force carbonated and was ready to bottle it using beer gun, not a fancy one just one from eBay. During the bottling process, the beer was foaming crazy. Yes, I had 3 meters beer line and my keg was ice cold, I sanitize the bottles and cool them down. Anyway, I could bottle the whole keg but most of the bottles were half filled.  The question is if there is any chance to enjoy the beer and will it hold at least little of CO2, lets say for few months. Or is it going to be a waste?  Did anyone had similar experience? What to expect?  Thank you for your time. "
2097,How to sweeten my pasteurised apple juice?,I’ve bottled and pasteurised some apple juice and it’s a bit “tart” this year. What should I use to sweeten it?  Any tips for avoiding this again next year while I’m bottling?  TIA 
2098,Beer yeast for wine making?,"Does anyone know if it works to use beer yeast to make wine.  I've got a batch of chardonnay grape crushed and sitting in my fridge right now, but I bought beer yeast by mistake.   Can I use the beer yeast to make white wine?   Please, could I have an answer today? Those grapes ain't gonna last! "
2099,Taking sample on primary,"I've decided to brew my very first Lager, after some good results on my Ales. I did a proper research on methods to try a refined process, specially when it comes to fermentation schedules and temperatures. I chose a simple Vienna Lager recipe as my first attempt, and it's now finishing the first week on primary (controlled temperature at 12ºC). Since I'm new with this yeasts, I wanted to take a sample to ensure everything it's working fine. It should be, since there's still yeast activity visible on my fermenter. Some egg-like smell was perceptible during the first five days, as it was described on various forums. But I want to make sure I'm not compromising a fermenter for 3 weeks with useless wort.   Is it safe after one week on primary?   Should I sanitize the faucet before taking the sample? "
2100,Could killer yeast affect my sourdough starter?,"I've just pitched K1-V116 into a batch of rosehip wine.  As I finished, thoughts of one kind of yeast led to another and I went to feed my sourdough starter - and stopped.  K1-V1116 is a killer strain which secretes toxic polypeptides able to kill other strains and species.  I have heard that even minute levels of yeast contamination (such as from having previously made a sourdough in the same room - even many months previously) can completely prevent establishing ginger beer plant.  Does anyone have any experience or information on how likely I am to have problems with tiny amounts of leftover K1-V1116 killing my sourdough starter?  There is bound to have been a few thousand cells lofted into the air when I opened the packet.  How paranoid about this do I need to be?!  I make wine and bread in the same kitchen and I like my established sourdough starter! "
2101,Adding a cherry flavour to cider,What is the best way to add cherry flavour to cider batch?   I previously tried adding whole mashed cherries to the carboy at the beginning of primary fermentation.    Would it have been been to first make a simple syrup with the cherries or to simple add cherry juice? 
2102,Airlock won't stay in carboy,"This airlock won't stay in my 5-gal glass carboy.    [website]I've tried drying out the bung hole and also the bung outer edge, but it still slowly rises and pops out.  This is my masking tape hack to hold it down.  Are there better ones?  What is the proper procedure for installing airlocks?   "
2103,Should I let hydrated dry yeast cool before pitching,"The Gospel of John states that dry yeast should be hydrated at a temperature warmer than what you would typically start fermentation. But John also states that yeast should be pitched from cold to warm, i.e. the yeast slurry should be colder than the cooled wort.  An example of ale yeast:   recommended rehydration temperature: 24°C  recommended fermentation temperature: 16-20°C (I want to start at 16°C)   So...    How do I hydrate my yeast at 24°C and then cool it to below 16°C without shocking the yeast?  Is it OK to let it cool down?  Over what time period (It should be pitched about 30min after hydration)?  "
2104,Bringing Cold Crashed Beer to Room Temperature,"So I cold crashed and force carbed a saison recently, but after trying a glass I realized that it might be a little young and too funky. I took the keg out of the fridge and let it warm to room temperature. Will the yeast in the keg still be viable and able to clean up their mess a little? For reference I used White labs WLP590, french saison yeast.  Also is there any issue with warming the beer so quickly? That is, have I done any damage by pulling the keg out of a 34 degree Fahrenheit fridge and allowing it to free rise to room temp?  "
2105,Help identifying (and preventing) an off flavor,"I have had a recurring off-flavor in my ales that I would like help identifying and preventing.   The flavor is a yeasty flavor with some savory components. I have tasted it a few times in commercial beers, but usually it's less pronounced and fairly tolerable. In my homebrews, it can be overwhelming and I've even tossed a few batches because of it. Prior to fermentation (post sparge), the flavor is not there. It only appears after fermentation has started. It always accompanies an overproduction of trub, with more ""floaters"" than normal and more haze than normal. I can usually smell it right away, often times right after fermentation starts. It usually does not subside with bulk aging, but a few times it seems like the brew has become more tolerable after being kegged for a month or two.   It does not really match any of the typical off-flavors, but does almost have a blood-like component and sometimes a sulphur component. However, a metallic flavor ostensibly comes from metal equipment, not the fermentation, and sulfur from lagers...   I have never had this problem with sour beers, ciders or lagers, only ales, and I think always with S05, one packet for a typical SG of 1.050 - 1.060, most often rehydrated, sometimes directly pitched. I thought I had used a different yeast in the last one, but after looking at my notes, it was in fact, S05. I did buy a 6-pack of S05 a while back, so maybe the yeast was bad, but it seems like I have had this problem before I bought that pack, but maybe not as often.   Per jsolarski's comment, I did solicit some taste notes. Unfortunately, all I really got was a quick head turn, clearly noting the off flavor, but not really any good descriptions, except perhaps a bit salty. I don't pick up any salt flavors, but perhaps this comes from the savory notes.   I'll bring a growler to an event tonight with some other homebrewers and see what other tasting notes I can get.   Possibly related, What exactly is yeast-bite?   UPDATE:  I had a few friends try the beer and one home brewer in particular identified it right away as Tetrahydropalmatine (THP), and he described the flavor as mousy or cheerios. I think this sounds plausible since I've described it as savory, and another as salty. According to milk the funk,      ""mousy"", ""urine"" (in high amounts) Cheerios® or Cap'n Crunch® (in low amounts), ""breakfast cereal"", or more generically, ""cracker biscuit"" flavor   Unfortunately, most of the article is with respect to sour beers, and I do not have this problem with sour beers. Also, much of the production is mentioned post-fermentation, but in my case, it is noticeable at the very start of fermentation.  There's a lot of speculation in the article, but not much that matches my experience.   This article mentions     In the presence of oxygen, Brettanomyces will produce both ETHP and ATHP from lysine and glucose or sucrose, though the exact metabolic pathway remains unknown   I'm not using brett, but perhaps S05 can do this as well?  So, given that, how do I go about preventing it? "
2106,Hops Wort Absorption,"According to BYO malt absorbs roughly 1.04L of water per kg malt. Knowing this makes calculating things like mash and sparge water quite a bit easier.  Is there a rough absorption rate for hops?  I've searched round the web but cannot seem to find anything. I guess it may vary according to the hop size and density, but some rough figures will help with calculations like topping up water and rackable post-fermentation volume.  Is there a difference between adding hops in the boil vs dry hop? "
2107,Mulberries in the Mead,"I seek knowledge in regard Mead, this is my first attempt at making some mulberry mead, the recipe I used was: 19 liter Carboy  6kg Honey 1kg Raisins 2teaspoons of Wyeast Nutrient  1 little pack of the yeast 5kg Mulberries, soaked in 10 cups water and 2 cups brown sugar over night, mashed it all up into a goo, strained it with some pantyhose and squeezed all the juice out of it, maybe had umm 6-7 liters of mulberry juice.   So couple things if you could please help me;   when I first strained the mulberries, before I put them in the pantyhose all the little seeds got through, so I ended up with a little blanket of floaty seeds, I thought since I’m adding raisins some little seeds can go into the brew to, have I made an error with adding the seeds? while I’m on the mulberries again with the first strain I didn’t have a sieve so I used, what I think it was a pasta strainer it had holes the width of a pencil, again I thought I’m adding raisins some pulp can go into it also, was this wrong also? now because of the pulp, seeds, raisins I’m looking at the brew and I’ve maybe lost mmm 2-3 liters of liquid for mass volume, So my big question is: can I add more liquid now (Honey) to top-up the carboy. I was told to ferment it for around 2 months then strain it and put it into a fresh Carboy for the remaining time, this was when I thought I could also add the top-up liquid. or don’t top-up just leave it be as is   I made 2 x 19 litres, so I thought mmm that’s maybe 5-6 good mead litres I could have drunk, so do I top-up or not please?   "
2108,Induction hot plates with precise temperature control (maintaintaining mash temperature),"I currently mash on a gas hob, turning the hob off when I reach my strike temperature, then insulating my pot the best I can with towels etc.. This is easy to mess up and sometimes I miss my target or lose far too much heat.  Ideally there would exist a (preferably affordable) device to regulate the temperature of my pot automatically.  Induction hot plates were recommended, and I see that some allow you to set the temperature explicitly. However, most seem to allow you only to set the temperature in 10° or 20° increments.  Does a hot plate exist which will hold a pot at a desired temperature to the nearest degree? Or else, what other appliances would achieve this? "
2109,"Is there a benefit to a full 60 (plus) minute boil, as opposed to shorter boil/more hops?","The idea is pretty simple: bittering due to alpha acid isomerization is a function of boil time and quantity of bittering hops.  Hence, it's quoted that from an alpha acid standpoint, a 15 minute boil with twice the quantity of bittering hops is fairly equivalent to a 60-minute hop addition.  I'm a bit lazy, and I'd rather not steam up the house any more than I need to, so a shorter boil time definitely has an appeal.  Plus, it seems like more of the nice aromatics would be retained, which sounds like a win-win.  Doing a little research, I'm noticing that I see a decent amount of 15-minute American pale ale recipes popping up, almost at the exclusion of other, more malt-forward styles.  That's got me curious:   Is there a benefit to a full-length boil, other than saving a few bucks on hops?  Is there something that happens on the malt side that takes time? "
2110,First Time - Honey Mead questions,"I am making Honey Mead for the first time soon, I will try making 2 1 gallon jugs. I have everything I need (Jugs, siphon, DAP, red star wine yeast, honey, sanitizer, carboy), but I want to make a sweet mead with about 15% ABV when fermentation is done. My yeast will survive up to 18% and I don't want to add chemicals to get them to stop at 13-15%. But I also want the mead to stay sweet afterwards. Should I just add enough honey and DAP for the yeast to survive to 15% ABV and then back-sweeten? If so, when am I suppose to back-sweeten it? Do I sweeten it after I rack it or right before? Also is there  way to make the yeast stop at 15% without chemicals?   EDIT: I also have a hydrometer, I have all the materials and tools required to make the mead, just confused on the procedure. "
2111,Is an ice bath sufficient to quickly cool a small batch of wort?,"I'll be brewing a small (1.5 gal) batch of beer soon, and in my quest for  laziness efficiency, I was thinking of brewing in a smaller pot, rather than in my 7-gallon monstrosity.  However, my immersion chiller doesn't fit inside the small pot.  Would I be able to get sufficient chilling with an ice bath?  I'll be trying a more hop-forward brew, and I'd still like to retain as much aromatics as I can, so I'd like to cool it quickly.  Some napkin math makes it appear that the bottom &amp; sides of the small pot would have roughly 2/3 the surface area of the wort chiller, and would not have nearly the convective effects of flowing water through copper.  But on the flip side, a smaller batch would have much less thermal mass.  Advice? "
2112,Safe rated pressure for a sankey connection,"Does anyone know the rated pressure for a Sankey connector? I see Sankey-fitting kegs are rated 60-120 PSI, so is it safe to assume the connectors themselves are good for at least 60psi? (I'm making sparkling wines so 60PSI is about what I need)  "
2113,How paranoid about cleaning & sanitization?,"I'm a new home brewer.  I only have a few batches under my belt -- one partial extract and two all grain.  Like most, I've read multiple books and watched videos on the brewing process.  Cleaning and Sanitization are talked about in depth.  In fact, it's talked about so much so that it has made me a bit paranoid.  On brew day, for example, I clean my equipment with PBW or Oxyclean, then sanitize.  I'm good with that, as I understand that this is best practices, and it doesn't take too long.  But, after I do that, say with a hydrometer, spoon, pitchers, etc.  Do I have to sanitize again every time I put it down?  I'm attempting to find a balance between doing the right thing for my beer but not obsessing about it where cleaning and sanitizing is something I dread, keeping me from brewing.  I find a lot of video on the right way to clean and sanitize, but none that actually talk about HOW careful you have to be.  After reviewing these boards, even on a single question about cleaning and sanitizing you get three different answers -- Is it okay to clean/sanitize brewing/bottling equipment the day before I plan to use it?.  I'd like to get the opinion on some home brewers that have more experience to see exactly how careful I have to be. "
2114,What happens if you mash only roasted grains?,"You're not supposed to ""mash"" with only roasted grains according to a variety of sources (e.g., this).  What comes out if you do?  Is it only starches, since no enzymes were active? "
2115,Stalled fermentation,"I've started brewing an Oktoberfest. It has been in primary for a little less than a week.  The first 24 hours was good, super active.  After about a day,  it got pretty warm here,  and the thermometer strip on my carboy read 80°.  After that,  my fermentation came to a screeching halt.  I figured the warmer temp might have just sped up the fermentation process,  but when I took a gravity reading,  it said 1.022, my OG was 1.042. So it went down considerably in that time.  I decided to wait a few more days.  Today,  I read it and it's at 1.018. I wanted it down to 1.012 to 1.016ish. And to be honest,  as I sat here writing this out it doesn't seems as bad as I thought it was.    But,  Does this seem normal? Is this a normal rate?  Should I let it sit for a bit longer, or is this about as low as I can expect it to get?   This is only my third batch ever, so I'm still new to this.  And this is my first time taking gravity readings. "
2116,Beer clearing in a fermenter or a keg?,"I am working on clearing my beer, started using Whirlfloc, giving it time, etc in the primary.  I read about some allowing beer to clear in a keg, doesn't the keg get clogged with the settlings? If cleared in a keg, what happens when you carbonate, doesn't it just get mixed up again? "
2117,Dry hopping and massive gas release,"I've been making an American IPA from young's which was sat at 1.010 SG for a couple of days. This is the point at which the instructions suggest I add the hop pellets.  A minute or so after adding the pellets there was a massive release of gas, more than at any point during primary fermentation.  It appears now that there is regular gas being released again, does this mean fermentation has restarted and the hop aromas will be lost? Should I wait for the whole thing to calm down again and add a second batch of hops? "
2118,What makes a beer syrupy in texture?,"I have recently brewed a nice rye ale. It turned out very nicely, however, compared to all the other beers I've brewed, it has a really syrupy texture and thickness to it. It quite dry but it isn't strong, ABV is 5.5%. The main malts were pale, rye and some wheat.  So I was wondering - what are general influences on the thickness of a beer? Is it just the malts (I'd guess the wheat malt is at least somehow responsible for parts of the syrupiness)? "
2119,How to reduce beer loss when dumping yeast using conical fementers?,"What are the key points to consider when using a conical fermenter to drain the yeast and leave only clean beer? My goal is: removing yeast, with (a) few loss of beer, (b) have beer not remain with yeast particles (potentially caused from the turbolences of the yeast removal process itself)?  Background  Just some short time ago I bought a 115 liters conical bottom fermenter in stainless steel. A main intention of this purchase was to reduce both workload and losses of beer when it comes to separate the fermeted beer from the remaining yeast cake, before botteling.  Ideally there is a valve at the very bottom of the cone, which when opening should help to drain the yeast, leaving only beer (at best without causing any sort of ""cloudiness"" or ""haze"" from turbolences). Unfortunately it does never seem to be the moment, that all the yeast was removed. The liquid drained from the bottom valve, after being initially thick, quickly turns liquid, yet is still of a ""dirty with yeast"" color and NOT clear beer.  I guess something I do is not ideal.  Maybe it is crucial (cannot be done elsewise) to have the fermenter being chilled down to a certain temperature? (yet I would think that the yeast should always be at the bottom, from my experiences with other fermenters, even at not extra cold temps.)  Maybe to open the it lower ""yeast drainage valve"" to be opened, it is indispensable, to have the airlock of the fermeter removed, so that no pressure build up or air enters through the lower valve? "
2120,Mead Post-Fermentation and Bottling,I currently have a batch of mead fermenting and I'm a bit confused about the bottling process for a still mead. I would like to know the steps/process for treating the mead before bottling.   Should I add the sodium metabisulfite immediately after fermentation or cold crash first? When should I add the fining gelatin? Should I rack it a number of times before adding the fining? Does the mead have to be degassed before bottling? Would I degas in the carboy? (I have a vacuum pump to do this)  
2121,Bubbling has stopped after 1.5 days. Is my fermentation okay?,"I'm doing my first brew from a kit. I added the yeast to the wort (according to the instructions I have). In the first day or so, nothing happened. In the second and third days, the airlock was bubbling intensively. But after about three days, the bubbling stopped. Does this mean something's wrong with my yeast? or is it okay?  Thanks. "
2122,Adding store-bought juice to beer,"I've been toying with the idea of adding roughly a gallon of white grape juice to a beer (possibly a Belgian Blonde?) but was previously told that the juice will just be completely fermented out by the yeast, leaving me with a lighter bodied beer but with no flavor from the juice.  However, after researching cider more it seems that many people do ferment store-bought juice without issue. I've even found some references to people successfully adding juice to beer. So overall I'm a bit confused at this point.  I'm not necessarily looking for a huge fruity flavor in such a beer but I definitely want it to be noticeable. Have other people had success using store-bought juice in beer (or even cider)? Even if all the sugars get fermented out, wouldn't there still be esters and the like that would contribute flavor? "
2123,Whirlpooling vs. Flameout (Knockout),"I'm new to adding different hop additions after the boil.  I'm not sure of the difference between recipes that cite add hops (whirlpool) and add hops (flameout).  What's the difference?  With flameout it seems I would simply add the hops after the boil, let it sit for 30 min or so, then chill.  Is whirlpool the same, or do you actually add hops and create a whirlpool effect?  And, if so, how do you actually create the whirlpool and for how long?  As an aside, with only 4 brews under my belt (2 all-grain, 2 partial extract), this seems to raise a red flag over the post boiled wort being exposed to the air.  All of the books and articles I've read stress to chill the wort as fast as possible to pitch before any airborne bacteria can get into your wort.  Sometimes it seems different brewing techniques contradict one another. "
2124,Rehydrated US-50 at 40 C,I re-hydrated my US-05 at 40C ( 105F ) going by this video [website]
2125,Can a keg a 1 gallon batch in a 5 gal keg?,"I a small batch of 1-gallon that I'd like to force carbonate rather than prime it in bottles.  Is it ok to force carbonate?  I realize I may be wasting some CO2, but I'm ok with it.  If it is ok, do I need to change the pressure that would carbonate a 5 gallon batch with? "
2126,Is it possible to recover from mashing at an incorrect temperature by stablizing the mash temperature for a longer duration?,"After 30 minutes of mashing, I checked the temperature at it was 142F/61C. I added 3/4 gallon of boiling water and brought the temp up to 155F/68C. It maintained between 152-155 for 60 more minutes.  Mashing at different temperatures causes different enzymes to be more activated than others, and that these enzymes break down the starch differently.   By mashing too low for too long, have I forever altered the composition of the sugar molecules in my mash? Or will stabilizing at the correct mash temperature and holding for 60 minutes result in the same composition as it would have been had I did this originally? "
2127,How important is it to hit a recipe's target OG? What if my OG is too high?,"I just brewed a chai tea brown ale (recipe here) -- which has a target OG of 1.048 -- and ended up with an OG of 1.064. My efficiency for this batch hit 78%, which I presume is higher than the recipe expects (I think most recipes assume 70%).  This means the final ABV will be in the 6-7% range instead of the 4-5% range. I like higher gravity beers, but I wonder if the higher than expected alcohol will put the intended balance of the beer out of whack. In other words, I assume the recipe was formulated such that the final alcohol flavors are milder, allowing, for example, more malt or hop flavors to come through.  To summarize: Will having an alcohol content higher than the recipe calls for unbalance the beer flavors? Should one always strive to hit a recipe's target gravities? "
2128,Clarifying mead made from raw honey?,"I have a mead in secondary right now. It's been there for about three weeks. It spent two weeks in primary. I was given the impression from my source material (The Compleat Meadmaker by Ken Schramm) and limited experience that it would clarify in about a month. It's my first 5 gal batch and I wasn't planning to age it for months on end in the carboy, simply bottle it when it cleared because I want to make a sparkling mead and I'll need active yeast to do that. However, even after three weeks, it's still pretty cloudy with no real discernible amount of change towards clearing at all.  The honey itself is local and was decently filtered and only a little hazy. I've made two previous 1 gal batches with this same honey and simply left it in primary until bottling and they cleared wonderfully after about a month or so. I can still see some tiny bubbles at the surface. Is this evidence that fermentation is still slowly ongoing? I forgot offhand what my finished gravity was supposed to be, but I remember that I thought it was pretty spot on. So I don't know. I'm just wondering, will it ever clear on it's own? What kind of timeline am I looking at? Is this just the result of scale? Or will I have to resort to clarifying agents? Or, because I want sparkling, should I bottle soon to ensure the yeast is still active and it should clarify in the bottle? "
2129,Potential Bitterness of Using 3 Pounds of Dark Grains,"I've been putting together the following oatmeal stout recipe, going for a kind of jam-on-nearly-burnt-toast sort of flavor:   8lb Maris Otter 2lb Flaked Oats 1lb Caramel 120L 1lb Special B 1lb Roasted Barley 1oz East Kent Golding @ 60m WLP002 English Ale   My concern is that since I'm including 3 pounds of fairly heavily kilned malts/barley that I might end up with an distracting level of bitterness.  Most recipes I've seen close-ish to this use lower lovibond caramel malts and/or less roasted barley.  That said, some also use black barley, so I'm kind of at a loss for whether people just love burnt-tasting stouts or if I'm just over-estimating how much ends up in the beer.  Is this recipe liable to end up being overly bitter/burnt-tasting?  If so, what would be the best things to tweak to reduce that? "
2130,Does the amount of air left in the fermenter increases the chance of contamination?,"Usually when the mashing process is over and the liquid is transferred to the fermenter there's a head-space of air. Lately I've made smaller batches of approximately 5 liters (a huge inefficiency, i know) but my bucket has 20 liters of volume. So, does this enormous head-space places a greater chance of contamination? If so, how sensitive is this process (like does the amount of air increases exponentially the chances of contamination)?  Tks! "
2131,Does opening the tap of a fermenter bucket increase the chance of contamination?,Sometimes when I want to take a sample of my beer I open the tap of the fermenter (in my case a plastic bucket) and let drip a little bit of beer (primary fermentation). Does this increase the chances of contamination? Is it safer to open the lid of the bucket and take the sample from above? 
2132,Are hops fermentable by beer yeast?,Are hops fermentable by beer yeast? Do they contribute in any way to the resulting ABV? 
2133,Risks of pitching a high gravity starter?,"I just got a stir plate and was excited to make my first 1L starter with it.  I googled the appropriate DME to water ratio and the first two results I found listed 1L to 1lb DME which seemed high but given the two sources I went with it.  After making the starter and pitching my yeast I started thinking about it more and realized this ratio much be off.  It turned out that the instructions for the first source only called for a cup but listed a pound in the supplies.  The second source was a typo which was corrected further down in the thread.  I decided that increasing the size of the starter was the best solution.  I had a 1 gallon jug on hand and decided that adding another liter of tap water would be a decent compromise between having way too large a starter and having one that was the right gravity.  Ultimately, it seems like I'm dealing with a half-gallon batch of moderate-to-high gravity beer rather than a true starter.  I should end up with way more yeast cells but I'm also going to stress the yeast more than I would have with an appropriate starter gravity.  As such, should I be concerned about pitching this starter?  If it's okay, would it make sense to split it off and keep a pint or so for a future batch or is the larger pitch rate just making up for the stressed yeast? "
2134,Advice needed (Absinth distillation),"I have decided to buy Chemistry Distillation Apparatus as in this image:      Vacuum Distillation Unit  I am using it to make absinth by following old recipes found on net. You need pure ethanol (97%) and soak herbs in it. After few weeks you need to distill it, but I am confused with all the foreshots, heads, hearts and tails. When you use regular wash, I am sure that during fermenting process you get bad stuff and it needs to be thrown. But what in my case when ethanol is pure? Do I still need to throw them away (or mix with another batch for heads tails)?   Also if I want to have 70% alcohol at the end, do I need to add water to still before distillation (ie. half-half so it is 49% abv mixture) so I can collect all alcohol but also some watter to dilute it. Or other approach would be to use pure ethanol with herb mixture as distillation source and when distillation is finished to just add distilled water to distillate. What are your toughts?  Thanks! "
2135,What is the effect of conversion efficiency on your brew?,"I keep hearing about how we should try and keep our conversion efficiency high, but what exactly does it affect? Is a lower conversion efficiency beer bad? "
2136,Johnson A419 BLE/WiFi Modification,"I'm a software engineer who just bought a Johnson A419. I have a Nest thermostat.   Naturally, if I can control and monitor my house temps with my iDevices, why not my fermentation?  I'd like to hack together an Arduino (BLE, Wi-Fi, or otherwise) to allow me to monitor/record my fermentation temps remotely, via some manner of connection to the A419. I think I need more hardware info on the unit than just this PDF to do it, though.  Has anyone attempted this, or a similar modification to another controller? Any more in-depth info on the A419 out there?  Or is there a product that already does this? (short of starting from a Nest and working from there, of course) "
2137,in depth cleaning glass bottles,"I realise there is a tonne of information about cleaning on the net already, but I am just about to bottle my first batch of glass bottles and wanted to put my process out there to make sure I haven't made any mistakes.   Rinse bottles with hot water after drinking and let drain (if possible) Few days before bottling, fill a sink with hot water and 1 cap of unscented Napisan (sodium percarbonate - diluted I believe) Fill each bottle from the sink, give a shake and let sit and soak for a while Any bottles that have noticeable dirt in them, use bottle brush Allow to soak for 15 minutes (other people tend to say overnight but I was impatient and unsure how much difference it makes) Rinse suds from each bottle in a sink of hot water Pour a bit of boiling water into each bottle for final rinse, then leave upside down to drain On brew day, pour a tiny bit of star san no-rinse sanitiser into one bottle with some hot water. Pour from bottle to bottle, topping up with hot tap water as needed until all bottles are soapy. Empty them all, cursory rinse, but leaving some suds Bottle!   Does this sound like overkill? Not enough? Should I soak longer? Are any of my methods inefficient?  Finally, I was thinking of storing the bottles in an esky (cooler) in case there are any explosions I won't come home to find the dog licking up beer and broken glass. Is this more of a risk to the other bottles in the esky? Any precautions I should take when handling the bottles for the first time? I've heard some horror stories about bottle bombs.  Thanks in advance for any advice. This site has saved me from ruining both of my previous brews :) "
2138,"CO2 tank slowly losing gas, not sure where the problem lies","So I have a rather simple keezer setup:    The left keg is currently being force carbonated at 30 PSI.  The top keg is being kept shut off from receiving CO2.  The left keg's CO2 line is using a threaded CO2 keg adapter, I've ensured it is screwed on as tight as possible, maybe even too tight.  No beer is leaking anywhere, no audible gas can be heard escaping either keg... But...  The top keg is being kept cut off for a reason.  Initially, the tank mysteriously drained over the course of a couple of days, and the pressure left the keg entirely.  When I recharged the CO2 tank today and plugged it back in, ensuring the adapter to the keg was on properly, and turned the red lever, it wasn't receiving gas.  It sure sounded like it was, but the dial remained at 0.  As I fiddled with the gray dial that adjust the amount of pressure and the cut-off lever, I eventually got it to up in pressure to about 10 PSI in the keg, but no matter what I set it at, it continued to audibly take in CO2 indefinitely until I flipped the lever to cut off any further CO2 from coming in.  As I turn the dial back down to open it up, even after hours of letting it sit, it seems to still be at the pressure I left it at before (if not 2-5 PSI more?), yet it sounds like it's taking in more CO2.  I assume this is the reason for my question of:  Why is my CO2 tank slowly losing pressure?  I understand that as the tank gets colder, and colder, the pressure gauge indicating how much CO2 is left will drop, but by how much?  Currently, it crossed into the red on the dial (approximately 450 PSI, 50 below the ""re-fill"" line).  I know the pressure of the tank will decrease with temperature, but I currently have my keezer set to 38F (I'm in a hurry before tomorrow for that left keg).  I'm not sure how much I've lost to the top keg, but I left the shop with the tank at 800 PSI, and to have gone down almost by half seems a bit much.  My concern though is that even though I have the top keg cut off, am I still losing pressure elsewhere?  Why is it that this started happening in the last week?  I've ensured all tube cinches are cinched very tightly, all points where a wrench can tighten down parts are tightened very well, and both kegs seem to be holding their pressure, despite the top one audibly telling me otherwise.  Is having the tank at 450, down 350 from today's recharge plus losing a couple of minutes worth to the never-satisfied-top-keg normal?  Why would the top keg seemingly take in an infinite amount of CO2, yet retain whatever pressure I leave it at?  Also, I have not banged around the dual-gauge regulators, so I doubt it is in any way damaged.  I purchased it inside of a month ago, so it is still fairly new.  UPDATE It would appear that the CO2 has settled at the above mentioned PSI since last evening (approximately 10 hours now).  I'm guessing the top keg was the problem, and I lost a bit more gas than I wanted to by toying with it.  It has also held pressure throughout the night (or so the gauge says), and it still sounds like it's pushing pressure in when I open the cut-off.  UPDATE/REVISED QUESTION  So I gave the thing a pretty good StarSan spray-down.  I didn't see anything.  but I did notice that once I flicked the gauge, the pressure went from 15 down to about 3, so the gauge was a lie.  I continued to spray everywhere, and even went as far as to disconnect the gas line from the keg, and sprayed inside that, then put it back on.  After toying with the cut-off lever, and looking around, I started to hear bubbles bursting, ever so slightly.  I looked up, and caught one right before it burst, coming out of the connector on the gas line.  I disconnected it, cut out the o-ring, replaced it with another, even replaced the entire connector and hose (it was the first connector I had from when I first got into kegging a year ago).  Everything is cinched on tight, and still I can see bubbles and hear a slight hiss coming from the connector.  What are my options as far as this?  Do they sell random replacement parts?  Do I even need to replace that ball-lock on the keg?  Why is it that this is happening now?  At this point, I have maybe a gallon left.  I'm going to clean out a growler, save what I can of it, and try to drink the rest today/tomorrow as part of the American festivities.  Would be nice to try and salvage the keg though. "
2139,Chemicals of PBW and StarSan - DIY solutions?,"Ok, i've see so much people here advising the use of PBW - Powdered Brewery Washer. I've seen some videos, and it seems to be a very good thing for cleaning everything in homebrew stuff.  But I live in Brasil, and it can be difficult or expensive to export some of this magic powder. The same situation is there for StarSan sanitizer. Here I use a solution of peracetic acid (peroxyacetic acid), but since i've lost my dealer i'm having troubles to find it in the market.  Can anyone tell me precisely if the chemical compounds are known and how to make a Do It Yourself solution for both products buying the chemicals separately? The Homemade PBW in this recipe is safe? Thanks in advice. "
2140,What is the minimum time required to have drinkable beer?,From reading What is the secondary fermentation debate? and If/When to move to secondary fermentation it appears that beer can be considered ready to consume (assuming force carbonation or a love of flat beer) after 8 days or so.   Is this true? This question What &quot;problems&quot; can I have if I bottle just one week fermented beer? attempts to answer what I am asking but the warning that the beer may be green and could use additional time in the fermenter is not quantified with any recommended time that the beer should be aged.  
2141,Infection (SCOBY/Acetobactor) or possible over-use of a fining agent?,"  Situation    Never mind the two hop bags that didn't sink, those things are more buoyant than what I gave them credit for.  This is the beer in a secondary vessel.  I wanted to get it off the yeast cake so I could wash the yeast (after realizing it was 9% ABV, I didn't bother, a bit much for the yeast, I fear).  It's been in this bucket for one week today.  It doesn't resemble a pellicle that you'd get from bacteria, but I'm getting hints from others that it may in fact be something even less pleasant to see.  Any chance this is some sort of beer-SCOBY in the making?  Maybe a Bacterial Cellulose?  Last night when I tasted it, it didn't taste off.  It smells like beer, and the film broke apart rather easily at this point.  Maybe it's my mind convincing my taste buds and nostrils it's good and I don't have my first infection after years of brewing without a single batch gone bad.  Any insight would be appreciated.  Full disclosure, I believe when I brewed it, I went overboard on the fining agents, adding an adequate amount of irish moss as well as one whirlfloc tablet.  Never tried both at once before, but figured I'd see how much of the protein I could get to settle out. "
2142,How precisely can you read your refractometer,"I do not have a refractometer and am considering buying one. My own concern is how precise you can get the readings. How many brix are you plus or minus when you do a reading? Is it as precise as a hydrometer, or close to? Do you still use a hydrometer for accurate readings before and after fermentation? "
2143,How to calibrate a refractometer,"What's the best method for calibrating a refractometer?  I've been using my cheapo refracto to take pre- and post-boil readings, but I also check with a hydrometer because I don't trust it yet. The two devices generally agree but usually the refracto is a couple of gravity points higher. The hydrometer has been checked as OK with distilled water and temperature adjustment is applied.  I have calibrated the refracto with distilled water as per the included instructions, but I'm wondering if there's more to it than that. Should I concoct a sugar solution of a predictable gravity to check non-zero calibration? "
2144,Fizzy with no head?,"My recent brew (#2) is well carbonated, but has little head to it when poured (and what's there dissipates quickly). Is it over carbonated? Too much priming sugar?  Also, I am used to seeing a strong head on bottled craft brews from the store, so does the amount of head mean anything about the brew itself?  Homebrew #2:   American Wheat 1 Gallon Extract Recipe Kit Conditioned with Fizz Drops for ~ 2 1/2 weeks 1 drop per 12-16 oz bottle, 2 drops per 22 oz / 750mL bottle  "
2145,White Stuff -- is it bad?,"I just brewed a raspberry wheat w/ ~2.5 lbs of frozen (organic) raspberries added to the secondary. I waited about 23 days after adding the berries to bottle, and when I went down to the basement to get ready for bottling day, I found this:    Bright white stuff growing on the tops of a few of the raspberries. I had checked it maybe 24-48 hours prior, and there wasn't any that I noticed.  Sniff test came back fine, so I was just super careful when racking not to disturb any of it (since none of it was in the beer). Taste test from the bottling bucket was also nothing surprising (pretty good, actually), and the SG was 1.011 (including priming sugar, 5.5oz of cane in 2c of water).  So what is this stuff? Should I be worried about my bottles?  Edit: Day eight of bottle-conditioning at ~72˚F, and I just vented + dumped nine bottles that looked roughly like this:    It may be equally difficult to see, but I expect this must be ""pellicle"" forming. Some bottles had white-covered bubbles, and others had some hazy stuff climbing up the neck from the beer line. All were pretty fizz-tastic when I popped the caps (just a little to let the pressure out at first), and one smelled particularly rubbery.  The other ~36 bottles looked good. Notably, I think it was the last few bottles out of the bottling bucket that were the worst; I had one half-bottle (the last few ounces out) that I capped out of curiosity; he fizzed worst than the rest. There were ""floaties"" in a few as well. "
2146,How do I avoid airlock foam overflow? Does it affect the fermentation process?,"During my last small batch brew, American Wheat from Northern Brewer, I came home to find that the foam in the 1 gallon carboy had overflowed the three-piece air lock (which was a mess to clean out). I have read that if it looks like it may bubble over, one can use a hose to create an airlock using a bowl of water. However, it overflowed while I was away, and I did not see it coming. I changed out the airlock for another one that I had, and let it proceed.  1) Is there a way to avoid this? Was there possibly too much wort in the carboy?  2) What are the possible effects on fermentation process, if any? "
2147,How long can a yeast starter stay on a stir plate before pitching?,"Two days ago (on Wednesday night) I made a yeast starter on my stir plate. I purchased a thermometer probe that I intend on modifying a fermentation bucket with, which I thought it would arrive today (Friday) but UPS feels like delivering it on Monday instead. I was going to brew tomorrow on Saturday after about 72 hours on the stir plate.   Can I just let the yeast starter do its thing all the way until Monday afternoon (about 4 1/2 days total), and if not, should I just place it in the refrigerator which apparently lasts a long time? Or would it be better for me to step up on Saturday morning? "
2148,"Murky beer, no bubbles in airlock?","we are fairly new to brewing and are attempting to make a Raspberry Tart Ale (based on a wheat DME). The beer has been in the carboy for 8 days now and is very, very murky and there aren't any bubbles in the airlock. Is this normal? This brew is kit based and the instructions say that we should be thinking about bottling in the next few days, but other brewers I have spoken to said something about secondary fermentation.... help!?! "
2149,"After cleaning a bottle, what's an acceptable amount of leftover StarSan bubbles?","I've been slowly improving my bottling, thank goodness.  I make a pot of warm / hot StarSan, and fill each bottle with the mixture, then after a while, turn each bottle upside down in the StarSan pot.  Then a few minutes later, I drain.  So far, I have ended up with a dense layer of small bubbles, about 1-2"" high, at the bottom of my 750mL bottles.  I know that leaving some StarSan behind is OK, but I wonder if I'm not doing a thorough job of draining?  And if not, how do I get a clean drain without rinsing?  I found this question and answer about bottling, and this answer about foam, but I feel like it doesn't quite answer my question.  Perhaps I'm being paranoid, and should just relax and have a homebrew?  Edit:  I wrote this question immediately after cleaning my bottles today.  Ten minutes later, the foam has settled down to about 1/2""; much less. "
2150,First Time Airlock Won't Start,"EDIT: I see from this post and from elsewhere on the Web that a bubbling airlock is apparently not an indicator for fermentation, as there could be a leaky lid. Regardless, doesn't a non-bubbling airlock indicate that something is wrong, as there could be a leaky lid? I'm under the impression we use an airlock in the first place to keep air out as it would oxidize the alcohol into vinegar.   This was my seventh extract batch. For the last 4 batches I've done a yeast starter and aeration with an aeration stone. This has moved my lag time from 24 hours max to 12-16 hours max. For all my other batches I get a vigorous airlock for 4 days. Normally I pitch the yeast in the middle of the fermentation bucket and do NOT stir the yeast around. I normally order the Wyeast over the internet which takes 5 days to ship to me. I use a swamp cooler. Normally I wait until the airlock starts to bubble before I add frozen water bottles to the swamp cooler.  I bought the Creme Ale from NB which uses Wyeast 1056 (American Ale).  However, this was the first time I didn't order the Wyeast from NB; instead I purchased it from the LHBS because I figured the 5 day shipping from NB was harmful.  I also ordered a Dead Ringer IPA which uses the same yeast.  I made two yeast starters. The one for the Creme Ale had an OG of 1050 and the one for the IPA had an OG of 1040. The IPA definitely was a better yeast starter.  I aerated the creme ale wort (1040 OG) with an areation stone and pitched the entire 1050 yeast starter into it. This time I decided to stir up the yeast in the wort. This time I decided to put 6 frozen water bottles into the swamp cooler immediately instead of waiting until the airlock started bubbling. Using a temperature probe I kept the swamp cooler at 60*F by adding frozen water bottles. The lid was completely sealed.  After 24 hours the airlock was not bubbling, so I purchased another Wyeast 1056 from the LBHS and pitched it without a yeast starter at 48 hours. However when I opened the lid to the bucket I saw the following: (Is this fermentation activity or simply a result of me stirring the wort/yeast from 48 hours before?)   Around 2 hours later (50 total) the air lock started bubbling, so I figured that I was safe and that either the 1050 og of the yeast starter somehow destroyed the yeast (even though I successfully pitched 1060 og yeast starters before) or the Wyeast I bought was bunk. I then added 6 frozen water bottles to the swamp cooler to take it to 60*F.  When I woke up 10 hours later (60 hours total) the airlock stopped bubbling.  I only did three things differently this time:  1) The LBHS sold me bad yeast. 2) The frozen water bottles somehow stopped the fermentation. 3) Stirring the yeast into the wort somehow did something.  Questions:  What is the problem (if it is possible to diagnose over the internet), and what should I do now?  I am in the middle of brewing the IPA with a 1040 og yeast starter so I will report back. This time I will simply pitch the yeast starter and not stir it, and I won't add frozen water bottles until I see the airlock bubbling. "
2151,Why does gravity increase between pre-boil and pitching?,"My handy-dandy ""Beer Craft"" book has a handful of recipes with useful information, including expected targeted pre-boil gravity, original gravity, and final gravity.  Their pale ale recipe, for example, calls out a pre-boil gravity of 1.035, original gravity of 1.055, and final of 1.012.  What I'm wondering is... why does gravity increase from pre-boil to original?    There's two things that happen here; you boil off some liquid, and you add hops.  You already have all your sugars from the malt.  My first thought was that it might be because you're increasing the density of sugars by losing water in the boil, but the ratio of liquid retention changes depending on batch size; I expect to lose about a gallon in an hour, regardless of whether I start with 2 gallons or 6; but the gravities stay the same.  My next thought was that the hops must affect the density, but what we keep from the hops after the boil doesn't go away as the beer ferments... or does it?  What's the science behind this? "
2152,How to Dry Hop when Forgoing Secondary Fermentation?,"I've decided to stop doing secondary-fermentations on the recommendation of users on this stackexchange.   A Dead Ringer IPA from Northern Brewer suggests 1-2 weeks primary, and 2-4 weeks secondary, with the last oz of Centennial being dry hopped in the secondary 1-2 weeks prior to bottling.  I'm worried about 2 things:   1) is a 6 week primary going to be ok -- will the yeast start to die at this point? (I did a yeast starter and areation)  2) Racking to secondary fermentation leaves the krausen behind. Do I simply drop the hop pellets onto the krausen and let them sink through? I don't want a bunch of holes in my krausen because I think I have a leaky lid on my fermentation chamber. Should I just get a filter and pop only one hole in the krausen, pouring the pellets through the filter, in order to minimize harm?  Thank you. "
2153,"Fermentation started, then stopped the next day. Is my yeast dead?","This is my first shot at homebrewing, using Northern Brewer's American Wheat Beer kit which is based on liquid malt extract, Willamette and Cascade hops, and a packet of dry yeast.  I brewed and put the hopped wort into fermentation on Friday.  By Sunday morning (~40 hours later), fermentation seemed to be moving along at a good clip -- I could see bubbles traveling through the airlock about once every 2 seconds.  However, by Monday morning, bubbling had completely stopped.  The weather (and my house) had gotten considerably cooler overnight, so thinking the cold was to blame, I moved the fermenter into the warmest room in the house (which still probably never goes over 70 Fahrenheit).  Still, no bubbling as of Tuesday evening.  I was under the impression that fermentation should be vigorous for at least a few days.  I've been doing some research and realize now that when I was brewing I didn't really understand the importance of aerating the wort.  I shook it around for a minute or so in the fermenter on brewing day, but maybe that wasn't enough?  Also, I didn't realize until brewing day that I should have been keeping the dry yeast packet in the fridge/freezer -- it had been sitting out in my basement (60-75 Fahrenheit) for at least a month.  Oops.  Any thoughts on if I screwed something up or if there's a way to fix it (if it really needs fixed)?  I'd appreciate any help.  Thanks!  Update: At the suggestion of Denny (and some other homebrewers I talked to in person), I decided to just let the fermentation run its course and I'm happy to report that fermentation seems to have worked -- my original gravity was 1.041 (possibly slightly higher as the reading was taken warm) and after two weeks on bottling day I was at 1.016 = 60% attenuation (right?).  Although the Safale US-05 Ale Yeast I used doesn't give attenuation specs, some folks on a forum said they usually get at least 70% from that strain, so it's possible that fermentation might have been a little stunted from the yeast not being refrigerated.  The beer is conditioning in the bottles now, so hopefully it will taste good when I crack one open in a couple weeks.  Thanks everyone for all the input -- if nothing else I've learned the importance of taking good care of the yeast. "
2154,Eisbock chunk thawed,It seemed a waste not to bottle my previously frozen ice chunk left over from an Eisbock recipe. It had all the smell and flavor and was a bit darker. Has anyone ever bottled their ice from icebock? Did it explode? 
2155,Styles other than steam suited for use of Northern Brewer hops,"So I have a one pound bag of northern brewer hops (along with about a half pound left of amarillos).  Any suggestions for a recipe or style?  I'm typically pretty boring, love to brew APA's, IPA's (though I do have a winter warmer going along with a Gose)...also have limited temp control.    Anyone have any luck using Northern Brewers in a spring/summer blonde?  Maybe a porter or an American variation on an ESB?  Never brewed me one of those.   "
2156,Should I boil a hopped malt extract prior to fermentation?,"I am an absolute beginner; I've merely helped my brother brew once.  I purchased a beer brewing kit and want to get started.  John Palmer's bible suggests that I should throw out the directions that come with any beer kit and follow the general guidelines he lays out.  The back of the can (it is ""Black Rock"" from New Zealand, their Nut Brown Ale package) suggests to throw the malt extract with water and suger into the fermenter and have at it (well, not that simple, but there's no wort boil step).  When I made beer previously with my brother, we boiled the wort -- but we were also hopping the beer.  This malt extract is pre-hopped -- so is there a specific need to boil the wort first?  Will this have any impact on the flavor and fermentation of the beer?  Please help!  I was hoping to brew tomorrow! "
2157,Stuck Ferm? Celebration Ale Clone Gravity at 1.021,"Celebration Ale Clone (extract kit) White Labs California Ale Yeast (liquid vial, no starter, I know next time I'll make a starter) Pitched at 68 degrees and good activity 18 hours later, got up to 71 degrees for the first 4 days of fermentation, but from days 5-10 its been around 64 degrees (house got cold and didn't have a temp control system) and the last 2 days have given gravity readings of only 1.021. I aerated by pouring back and forth between the ferm bucket and bottling bucket and shook the bucket up before pitching, which is what I usually do and seems to work well for aeration on my other batches, but I did just order an O2 aeration system for my next batch.  I also did just get a Fermwrap and Johnson Digital Temp Controller to help in temp control during the colder months. My question is would it work to swirl the bucket a bit to resuspend some of the yeast and use the Fermwrap to get the temp back up to 70 degrees to help it get down to a FG closer to the estimated 1.012? I don't want to create any bottle bombs with a 1.021 gravity reading. I contacted the store (Brewer's Apprentice in Freehold, NJ) where I get my kits and they weren't to sure if that would do anything, but shouldn't it help the yeast finish up since I feel like the yeast is probably just dormant from the colder temps? White Labs suggest 68-73 degrees. Or is there anything else I can do to help it out?  (Side Note: Read in another post that scorched wort can create unfermentable sugars resulting in a higher FG, and yes I did slightly scorch my extract cause I left the heat on for a minute when adding it, so this may be the reason) "
2158,Combating Diacetyl,"I've just finished my first brew (brown ale), and the results aren't quite as spectacular as I had hoped. The issue is a prominent, yet not overpowering, sweet almost caramel-like flavor. As best I can tell, the culprit is Diacetyl.  However, being such a novice, I can't be certain that diacetyl is my issue let alone identify its origin. I have a few questions:   Do other contaminates or impurities produce similar flavors? Now that the beer has been bottled, is there anything I can still do to mitigate these flavors? Is this the result of racking too early? If not, what are other possible causes?   For #3, my beer sat in the primary fermenter for about 6 days before being transferred. The fermenter was producing virtually no gases for about 24 hours prior to transferring. I've read enough to now understand I need a hydrometer to judge properly, but is it likely I transferred too early? Is the source of my troubles?  Thanks! "
2159,Irish Moss and Hefeweizen - use or avoid?,"I'm looking to put down a Hefeweizen tonight, and am pondering whether adding Irish Moss to the last 15 mins of the boil would be a good thing, or a bad thing. On the one hand, I would expect the Irish Moss to help clear up some of the unwanted cruft. On the other hand, would the Irish Moss be too effective at cleaning up? Meaning, would the resulting beer be unnaturally clear for the Hefeweizen style?  The recipe: - 60/40 wheat LME - Liberty hops (alpha 3.7%) @60 mins - liquid yeast (WLP300)  My brewing experience: - dabbled some 30 years ago - got back into it a few months back - have only done 2 batches previously, both extracts, the second included specialty grains steeping - never used Irish Moss or any finings before; selected Irish Moss because one of the potential drinkers is vegetarian "
2160,Best beer to brew that will last a long time,I have just started brewing so I apologize for my stupidity.  My nephew was just born today and I want celebrate by brewing a batch and storing it until his 21st birthday.  I think it would be cool to give him a bottle of beer 21 years from now that was brewed the day he was born. So I was curious if there are any particular types of beers that would be best to brew for this particular situation.  Or do all beers keep their great taste for long periods of time.  Also what storage process do you recommend? should I bottle it and keep it cold? is room temperature ok? 
2161,Variable carbonation,"I've just begun sampling my first batch, and I noticed that my carbonation level can vary from bottle to bottle. Most are just about perfect, but a few have certainly been over-carbonated, practically like soda.  What could cause this? I didn't stir in my dissolved priming sugar, but I gave it nearly an hour's rest to fully homogenize before bottling.   Also, should I transfer the remaining bottles to the fridge to cease further carbonation?  "
2162,How to strain wort before primary fermentation,"I recently made a big beer (Dogfish Head 90 minute clone) with an OG around 1.11.  I had never tried to strain wort before moving to a primary fermenter, but thought it would be a good idea since this had so many hops. So, I used the basic muslin bag and bungee cord method of putting the bag over my fermenting bucket and using the bungee cord to secure it. This seemed to work fine until I tried to remove the bag and material. When I released the bungee cord all the contents of the muslin bag fell back into the wort.  I know this result was mainly due to user error (me), but is there a better way to do this? Or, don't strain the wort and let it naturally settle and use a secondary fermenter?  "
2163,Strange aftertaste in mead?,"I've been making mead for a while and there's something I can't quite resolve. Some batches are said to have a strange, solvent-like or ""turpentiney"" after-taste. Most people don't seem to notice it or care and I've only ever noticed anything once or twice (I myself have noticed a slightly odd after-taste a few times but I wouldn't have called it ""turpentiney"", it was very faint), but a couple people seem sensitive to it and notice it more often.   I use different honeys, from pasteurized Billy Bee to unpasteurized wildflower honey I buy at farmer's markets. For yeast, I use champagne yeast. I almost never use the same recipe twice, yet the 2 or 3 people that are particularly sensitive claim that they can detect this taste in almost every batch I make, and that it varies from batch to batch.  Is this common in mead? What might be causing it? Is there something that can be done to mitigate it or prevent it? It's hard for me to know for sure how bad it is since I don't seem very sensitive to it. "
2164,How do you make a sweeter beer?,"Since the yeast will burn sugar away generating alcohol &amp; CO2 for as long as it can (until the % by volume makes the brew toxic, killing the yeast off), just adding more sugar doesn't seem to the answer.  Although this technically results in a sweeter (sugar remaining after yeast is no longer viable) result, carbonation drops won't work to carbonate in bottles.  How do you get a sweeter result?  For example mead or ginger ale are typically quite sweet; how is this achieved?   Is there some kind of sugar which is not compatible with certain yeast strains?   Can't seem to find any information regarding this type of brew. "
2165,Mixing Wheat and IPA for WOW,"So did a tour of Odells with a buddy and his son. During the tour his son asked, ""Do you ever mix all the beers into one?"" The guide said, ""Like a suicide beer? Yes, we've been know to experiment. The best is an IPA and Easy Street Wheat; we call it an Easy Elephant."" At the taphouse he gave us a sample.. and it was incredible! Had a sweet and malty start and a grapefruit-like and crisp finish. Now I'm on a quest to make it myself. I could make two batches and then mix them... OR I could experiment. If you were to try to make an Easy Elephant, what would you include? "
2166,Two part question on my first brew batch,"Thank you all in advance.   Finished my first brew from an extract kit, a Amber Ale. I added vanilla bean in secondary (4 whole beans) but followed the recipe to the tee. Beer finished and carbonated well. Its been in bottle for a little over 2 weeks. I finally refrigerated one last night and tried it.  Results are not promising. What I wanted was a mellow malty red ale, but it is way too bitter for my taste, almost like a weak IPA. The recipe I used called for bittering hops and aroma hops at the end. I am pretty sure next time I will cut the hops in half at minimum.  Also, I was worried the four whole vanilla beans I put in wouldn’t be enough to change the flavor profile, but I was way wrong, its too much vanilla. The flavor is good on impact to the tongue, but the vanilla leaves an odd after taste that I can’t really describe.  Question #1 - What is the best way to kill some of the bitterness and let the caramel malt flavor shine through? Simply half the amount of hops?  Question #2 - Will the bitterness mellow at all if I let it sit in the bottles for a week or two more?  Thanks!  Steve "
2167,DME for priming,"I fully acknowledge that the internet is a place of truly limitless (and often incorrect/misinformed) information, yet here I am asking this question on an internet forum.    I'm planning on bottling a fig gose I made a few weeks back, and recently had a question with a professional brewer/firkin specialist about priming.  He stated that he NEVER uses corn sugar for priming, as it gives beer 'that homebrewed' character.  Has anyone done a side-by-side on fermented beer?  I have several process-oriented problems that can lead to 'that homebrewed beer' character, but I am trying to systematically eliminate them.    Going to try this tonight just for laughs, but does anyone else have an opinion? "
2168,Vegan option for lactose?,"I have been vegan since 2000.  So lactose is out for my brews.  What would be a good substitute?  I have seen people suggest maltodextrin as it is an unfermentable sugar, but it doesn't add any sweetness.  Others have suggested adding an artificial sweetener to add some sweetness.  Which basically means adding two things to get the effect of lactose.  Anyone have any other ideas or experiences? "
2169,Can you add more yeast into a batch of cider if you think you've killed it?,"Ok, so I’m really new to this I started off making cider Since I juiced my own apples, I used the method of pasteurisation that kills off wild yeast by heating the gallon of juice on a stove while adding sugar I allowed the cider to cool, and then added the yeast It’s only been about 16 hours, and tiny bubbles are in the water of the vapour lock, but I’m worried I might not have let the cider cool down enough before the yeast was added, as it only cooled for half an hour Can I add more yeast to the mix if in a few days it isn't showing any signs of fermentation? Or do you thing the batch will be alright, or should I just chuck it? "
2170,Can I compensate for pitching too much yeast?,"I just pitched a whole 35mls vial of White Labs WLP001 California Ale Yeast into a 1 gallon batch of brown ale wort. I only intended to pitch half of the vial, but my brain turned off at exactly the wrong moment and I didn't stop myself.  I understand that pitching too much yeast can affect the flavor. Is there anything I can do to counteract the effect of excess yeast? Would lowering the fermentation temp help? "
2171,Traditional Food Mills as a Grain Mill / Dough to Blow @ W-S,"Anyone have any experience with trying to use a traditional food mill to crush grain?  I'm afraid that I won't be able to get as fine of a crush as I need, plus it might be a pain in the neck to mill 10-15 lbs in such a small, non-motorized mill.    Long and short, my wife and I have some $ to spend @ Williams-Sonoma, and was looking for good things to buy that can assist in the 'brewing' element of our cooking life!  This is the one I was looking at: [website]"
2172,OG higher w/ full vs. partial boil?,"I've done 2 full boils and probably 10 partial boils since I've started homebrewing.  In both full boils, my OG has been significantly higher.   Most recently, by .02 (expected 1.062 measured 1.082).  None of the partial boils were off by this level.    Any thoughts?  Am I extracting more points from the specialty grains with 5g vs. 2g?  Recipe: [website]"
2173,How to salvage bottled beer that failed to carbonate,"I brewed my first batch of kit beer that required a kind of ""secondary fermentation"".  That is after it was done fermenting I transferred it to another carboy and added the bourbon barrel wood chips. After 4 weeks, bottled it with recommended priming sugar.  This is my first failure in brewing beer.       After over 3 weeks it has no/zero fizz.  The beer is ok but without the co2 it is not good.  Any ideas on:   What went wrong? What killed the yeast?   How to salvage it?  Rebottle it?  Buy a keg and co2 system and pour it in?   Thanks for any advise you can provide. Bob "
2174,Hydrometer measures and possible corrections,"In my first batch I was very worried about not being able to end it by not having certaing equipment at the right time. The thing is by following strictly the instructions my hydrometer reading was very close to the one predicted in the recipe. But after that I thought to myself 'why i did buy this.. i wouldn't be able to take any correction measure if it wasn't right' So, if the hydrometer it's far from the ideal density in the mashing process what could be done? And one thing related to that. If the reading shows that density it's very close to water and so you want to increase the levels of sugar in the content by increasing temperature (or cooking time), could you eventualy 'burn' your mash? Or you will only lose water? IMPORTANT: i thing for the sake of not getting to vague in the question is better to focus on the appropriate measures for the mash process, fermenting density and other stages could be done in another topic "
2175,Is there such a thing as hop terroir?,"I was going to try a hop tasting in an attempt to get a handle on the main varieties of hops. I already have some US Fuggles left over from the ESB that is currently fermenting. I note the same supplier also has UK Fuggles. Is this going to be a useful comparison? Ie. is there a real difference for different locations but the same variety?  Or is it all marketing? I.e. I'm going to mainly brew English beers so I should use UK East Kent Goldings, UK Fuggles, etc so that I can boast that it is made from Real English Hops even though it will taste the same? "
2176,Bottling vs Kegging Questions,"One thing that is very confusing to me right now is the difference between bottling and kegging, more specifically the carbonation difference between them. The first doubt of kegging  arises when you would extract the beer inside of it. You could use a party pump or a co2 cylinder system. But if you used a party pump wouldn't the beer be flat? Like you add sugar when priming to generate co2 and etc. I understand that this is emulated by the co2 cylinder when kegging. But if it is already carbonated why would you use co2? Is the beer inside of a keg really 'flat'? I think to better address the question would be important to explain in what stage (primary, secondary fermentation, .. ) the beer in commercial kegs are. Thanks! "
2177,Water filter usage in homebrewing,I'm considering using a water filter just prior to bottling in order to filter very small particles. But would that also filter the yeast and prevent fermentation in the bottle? What micra in what stage is better for filtering? Is using filters good practice at all? 
2178,my temperature is too high what can i do?,i have just added all the ingredients for my first coopers lager beer kit. I am aware that my temperature is too high at 32degreesc and the kit says to be from 21-27. will this ruin it? i heard it was better to get the yeast in right away so i did that very quickly. (it does say on the kit that fermentation will still take place Can i put some ice cubes in to lower the temperature or is it bad to remove the lid? or maybe put it outside for a bit? thanks very much for any advice! 
2179,How to make a tap faucet close automatically?,"I recently built a kegerator out of a vintage freezer. I've added one tap handle to the door with two more coming soon. The freezer has a latching handle and pretty strong closing action, which pops the tap open dumping beer on the floor...  Can I add a spring to the internals of my cheap faucet to make it close automatically? Does anyone know which one is a good size and strength?  An overview of the parts and assembled version of my taps:    This is the fitting, which I imagine is more or less universal to most shanks:    I'm going to hunt for a food safe compression spring that will fit in between the shank and the inside portion of the fitting that attaches to it. Hopefully it will provide enough tension to close the tap cleanly, or at least keep them from pouring out when the door slams.  It seems like most self closing taps listed online have a screw where the little ""button"" is on the front of the tap so possibly the plug(?) could be machined or replaced to allow for an external spring (avoiding the need for food safety). "
2180,Why is my O.G. less then what I calculated?,"I am trying to figure out what I did wrong, when I measured my O.G. it came out to 1.060/1.062, what i calculated is, and what the recipe states it should be in the 1.070 to 1.080 range......  recipe:  Brewers Best: Double IPA - Imperial IPA (14C)  Boil Size: 4.00 gal  Boil Time: 60.000 min  Efficiency: 70%  OG: 1.076  FG: 1.019  ABV: 7.4%  Bitterness: 70.6 IBUs (Tinseth)  Fermentables                  Name    Type   Amount    Briess LME - Golden Light Extract 9.900 lb   Corn Sugar (Dextrose)   Sugar 1.000 lb   Caramel/Crystal Malt - 40L   Grain 8.000 oz   Cara-Pils/Dextrine   Grain 8.000 oz    Total grain: 11.900 lb  My Procedure   Fill Pot with 3.5 Gal water Heat, water and add LME and Corn sugar Steep grains/mash in other pot, with 1 Qt water, 30mins @155F Sparge with 1 Qt water 170F - 180F, add to brew pot Start Boil, and follow brew instructions, boil-->add hops,last 15 add hops, last min, add hops.... cool wort to 68F/70F  put into primary and top up to 5Gals, take S.G.

What caused this loss of .010  to my brew and could I make this up in the secondary, by adding boiled DME/wort to it?  Also Bonus question, what effect will this have on it, since this no longer in the imperial range.....?  right now it seems like its ok, and the wort tasted sweetish and hoppy, but could not compare to my first 2 (dry stout, Irish red ale) "
2181,Security measures when brewing Soda,"I just wanted to experiment homebrewing some Soda for a kick. I found a few pages online that say the process is quite similar to homebrewing Beer, but somewhat easier and faster. As far as I know, I could heat some water, mix yeast with any kind ""juice"", let it rest for a day and get something of a Soda.  My question is, what safety measures should I take into consideration? Should I avoid using some kind of product? Are there any chemicals that could be harmful when combined with yeast? For instance, if I wanted to experiment carbonating a ""Crystal Light"" instead of using real Juice, could that have unforeseen consequences? "
2182,Stupidly added priming sugar in initial fermentation step,"I started my first brew this weekend with a kit,   Stupidly, I misread the instructions and added the bag of priming sugar (which was supposed to be added immediately prior to barrelling) at the start of the fermentation. (I got confused with a brewing sugar step which was including in the instructions but intended for a different recipe - it was a bit unclear!)  After a slow start it's now bubbling away and smells good (2 days later), and my plan is to just wait the given amount of time and then take a gravity reading. Hopefully it'll reach the correct gravity and I just proceed to barrel it as-per the instructions. Maybe I should take one reading and then another the day after to check that it's stable.  Any advice on this, hopefully I won't need to throw away this batch due to this mistake? Also:   what effect (taste, strength, yeast effects) might I expect from adding the sugar at the start of fermentation? I have another bag of priming sugar, I still plan to add it prior to barrelling. This should be okay?   Thanks for any feedback on this! I bit gutting to have messed up the instructions, whoops :D "
2183,5 gallon batch in 16 gallon kettle?,"I just ordered a Bayou brew kettle. I meant to order the 10 gallon, but accidentally ordered the 16 gallon (Only a $15 USD difference).   I only have a couple all-grain/partial mash brew under my belt, so I am sticking to the 5 gallon batches for now. So should I send this one back and get a 10 gal, or would I be fine with the 16?   The false bottom will sit at the 2.5 gallon mark. This might hold my grains above my water level. Maybe I could remove the false bottom, and just use the bazooka filter? Or mash with my entire boil volume, and just recycle my wert?  "
2184,Fix a leak on my weld-less valve,"Just picked up a new kettle. Assembled it and ran a water test on it. It came with some teflon tape, and I put that on. But it has a consistent dripping leak. Should I just load some more teflon tape on it? Or does anyone have some good solutions?  "
2185,Why my mead is sparkling?,"I just tasted my mead after 3 months of brewing and now it tastes ok, but it is sparkling, like champagne. It also tastes a little like it. Actually, i never tasted mead before so i don't know hot it is, i just thought it would be smoother. Why did it happened? Is there something to help it? "
2186,How do I increase the sulphur production in a lager?,"In my past experience, my lagers have no perceptible sulphur. I understand that the ""rotten egg"" sulphur (H2S) is undesirable, but every great lager I have tasted has at least a hint of matchstick sulphur (SO2), sometimes fairly pronounced. I found a lot of articles on how to remove it or mitigate it, but little to nothing on how to produce it.   I have tried different fermentation temperatures (low 40Fs to mid 50Fs), but they all taste the same to me; rather bland and ""un-lager-ish"". I have tried different yeasts (wy2124, wy2007, wlp830, but mostly use w34/70 (which I believe is perhaps the same as wlp 830/wy2124). I have also tried wy2278, but it's been a while. I actually purchased this for my next lager because it specifically mentions sulphur production.   I normally make a starter, using DME and size by the numbers from Mr. Malty (or pitch 2 packs of w34/70). I also usually chill the starter and decant before I pitch it, so I don't get too much DMS from the starter. I've even tried fermenting the starter at lager temps, though it didn't seem to have any perceptible difference.   My ""usual"" technique is the one described in Palmer's introduction to Jamil's ""Brewing Classic Styles"", page 43, where the wort is chilled to 7C before pitching, then raised to 10C over the next 3 days. I certainly don't do everything right every time, but like I said, my lagers just don't have that classic taste I get from nearly every craft lager.   If you have any recommendations or corrections to my technique, it would be greatly appreciated. Lagers are a style I have yet to even pull off, much less master :) "
2187,Bernzomatic oxygen bottles to oxygenate beer,"I bought a cylinder of Bernzomatic Oxygen on the advice of my local homebrew store. They sold me an adapter kit (w/ air stone) and I got the cylinder from Lowes (tool section).  Picture of adapter  Firstly I tried attaching the adapter directly to the cylinder which caused massive leakage through the threads. Applying teflon tape (lots) helped but it was still leaking a bit. Exhausted the entire bottle for less than 5 minutes.  If anyone is using O2, how is it done? "
2188,Any way to Flavour a Cider crafted with Baking yeast?,"I'm very new to brewing, and I'm making a couple test batches of cider as we speak. However my accessibility to things like wine or champagne yeast, so i'm stuck with baking yeast.   My question is when i'm done if i'm not happy with the taste is it possible for me to freeze my cider and add sweetener? Would sugar work or would I have to use a honey or other substitute? "
2189,Cider went too dry and too flat,"I've been making a cider (for the first time)... it's been in primary for a week, and went to secondary for another three weeks. I used crisp apple cider from Trader Joe's as the base. OG was about 1.056 and it fermented to 1.001.   So, now I have two issues... it has a funky bittery, acetone-ish taste with funky smell (not like when your beer goes really bad and starts tasting like baby diapers). I had the same when I was making mead, and the cure was time (in 6 month it totally cleared out).   Second, it has a flat taste. I do not taste anything else. It is not sour at all, and seems like everything fermented out.   So, can I add apple concentrate to make more applish or maybe a little bit of lemon acid to make it little bit sour?   I heard also, that making a second batch with upper FG and blending it would also work...  What would be your suggestion?  "
2190,Need help diagnosing efficiency on a wheat beer,"Yesterday I did my 12th brew. My third in my current equipment setup. All-Grain BIAB where my efficiency has been consistently over %70. My previous brew, an IPA I hit all my numbers. I changed no variables for this beer except of course the recipe. I striked at 158F, mashed for 90 minutes at 153F (stirred many times). My one gallon recipe:   1.5lb White Wheat Malt 0.5lb Pilsen  60 min boil on .2oz Tettnang.   Post mash, I lost .125 gallons of water as expected (left with 2 gallons in pot). Hit a pre-boil gravity of 1.022. Was expecting 1.027. I guess that doesn't seem huge, but come end of boil I had .1 gallons of trub and 1 gallon of wort, which measured in at 1.035. Any ideas as to what would have led to numbers like this? And what steps should I take in the future to ensure better numbers? I ask about the white wheat in particular because it is the only ingredient I have not used in a mash before (link to malt) "
2191,Mash-out and batch sparging,"Brewing all grain, my mash tun can't hold my full sparge volume. So I step it, a few gallons at a time. I've read that the sparge water should be 170 F to stop the enzyme reaction. But when stepping my sparge, do the later steps need to be 170, or just the first step to stop the enzymes? Can the enzymes restart between steps?  Per the comments, by step batch sparge I mean a batch sparge of 5 or 6 gallons, in steps of 2 or 3 gallons, repeated to get to the boil volume.  "
2192,Securing a threaded thermowell into a bucket lid,"I perhaps may have made an oops and I bought this thermowell, thinking it would be easier to secure it to the lid than the regular straight walled one that everyone puts in a dual stopper. I thought to myself, ""how does that thing stay in the hole, wouldn't the pressure work it outwards?"" (a bit more of research here would have done me wonders..) Also I have one of the famed ds18b20 sensors, I got this one with a bit extra diameter to accommodate the probe. At least that's working for me...  Anyway. I have my purchase and I am attempting to affix it to the bucket lid but it's turning out to be harder than I thought.  The latest thought is a PVC bushing and a Nut (Whatever size I can make match) I was also looking for a gasket but I feel like I'm veering of into over engineering territory. I was hoping for some sort of threaded flange to begin with, hopes and dreams dashed in the Lowe's plumbing aisle. This would probably be over if I had a 3d printer, but maybe I think so because I want one, but I digress.  Anyone out there have any ideas? Gasket or no gasket? I just want to be able to take it completely apart for cleaning and sanitizing reasons.  I've read a few discussions about thermowell vs tape to bucket. I'm in the thermowell camp.  Edit:  "
2193,How can I get more consistent carbonation in bottles?,"Some of my bottles usually turn out over carbonated, and some turn out under carbonated. Is there a good technique to get consistent carbonation? I imagine it is a function of both evenly distributed priming sugar and also the yeast. The latter might be more difficult to achieve since it settles a bit during bottling? "
2194,High FG in primary fermentation,"I am doing a Diabolo beer from this kit  First, my OG was 1.070 (vs 1.075 recommended).  Now, after 9 days (they recommend 10 days in primary fermentation), the FG is 1.018. The recommend value is 1.010. I will not do the secondary fermentation, and currently I don't see any activity in airlock. After the read of the FG I decide to wait some more days to bottle. However, the temperature in the start of fermentation is 25ºC and now only 16ºC (A sudden drop in temperature in my area). I don't have any way to control the temperature.   The only idea I had was to roll a blanket to the fermenter to raise a little the temperature. This makes any sense?  My question is, if the FG remains around 1.018 can I bottle anyway? Or can be dangerous when priming (explode bottle)? What should I do to low the FG? "
2195,"My fermentation top popped, is it still salvageable?","I started a Belgium style ale, about 1.064 og.  After 2 days I go check on it in the fermentation fridge and see that the lid of the bucket has blown open, blown the fridge door open, and krausen was everywhere. I don't know how long it was like this. I obviously closed it up again and closed the fridge. Is the beer still fine to bottle? How do I prevent this in the future?   [website]"
2196,"How do you make a tasty, yet healthy, root beer?","I am looking to make a root beer which is both healthy and (to some degree) tasty.  I have tried twice to make root beer using this recipe:  [website]The first time was barely drink-able, I had let the ginger bug ferment too long I believe. (I don't drink, but I felt it was fairly alcoholic for a root beer).  The second time was OK, perhaps further iterations will improve but I did everything right as far as I could tell. I think it may be the recipe rather than the method.  Does anyone have a recipe that would make a good substitute? Or perhaps feel that this is a good recipe but that maybe I made some errors? That would be appreciated.  Ideally I would like to make a Doctor Pepper type recipe, but I am starting with root beer and working my way there.  Any input would be appreciated. Thanks! "
2197,Safe to return sampled wort to the primary after sampling?,"I made my second batch of beer (ever) last Friday night, and in a few days' time I'd like to sample a bit of it so that I can check its gravity.  Provided that I sanitize all of my equipment (siphon, test beaker, hydrometer, etc.), is it safe to return the sampled wort back into my primary fermenter so that it can continue fermentation? Or is it not even worth the risk of infecting/contaminating the remaining 4.95 gallons thats already in there? "
2198,Moving bottles with sediment,"I have some 'sugar carbonated' cider with sediment in the bottom of each bottle. I would like to transport the cider via car to another location (for a party).  Is it likely that moving the cider will disturb the sediment?  If the sediment is disturbed, how long will I need to leave it at the new location before the sediment will re-settle? (Hours / Days / Weeks)  What do other cider makers do if they decide to transport home brew cider for consumption? "
2199,How necessary are specialty malts in an extract brew?,"I'm planning on doing some SMaSH beers; mainly so that I can get more used to the characteristics of the various hop varieties; and also maybe keep the cost down a bit while I'm experimenting. Up to this point I've used specialty malts in my (two) extract brews. Obviously the bonefide SMaSH beer recipes don't include speciality malts; but I know I could always do a single hop beer and just use some specialty grains if I wanted to — though I do like the idea of using the SMaSH concept to identify the flavours of the malt extracts too, but I don't want to make a lame beer at the same time. You hear people all the time saying how terrific this and that SMaSH beer taste, but if that's the case why do we use specialty malts at all? I know a lot of it is for colour but is that it? ... or is the flavour imparted by the specialty malts in a typical extract brew not enough to really worry about leaving out, or are we depending more on the flavour hop addition to make up for that?  How necessary are specialty malts in an extract brew? "
2200,Home made Cider Over Carbonated what should i do with the other Bottles?,I have been brewing some home made cider and decided last weekend to crack it open! (has been in bottles for about 6 months) when a friend opened the bottle it basically exploded and send the swing top flying covering the ceiling in cider and leaving about 100 ml of the 750 ml bottle remaining!  My question: is there anything i can do with the remaining bottles to stop them from doing the same thing? or am i doomed to opening them outside and having little cider left?  Thanks 
2201,What stainless steel inox 304 vs inox 316 is acceptable for brewing equipment?,"I am setting together fittings and ball valves for my homebrewing equipment and corrosion protection and food safety of material is a key decision point.  Yet there is a noticable price difference between the inox 304 (cheaper) and inox 316 (more expensive) stainless steel. I seek in this question the information where the difference between the two is, in particular with wort.  The key points are:   will 304 suffer (i.e. corrode) from wort (assuming there is sort of salts chloride existing in the wort) ? will the 304 type of stainless steel (in case of corrosion) release any toxic materials into the wort ? can the price difference (i.e. that 304 is 1/2 as expensive as 316) be confirmed?   I have read this:     304 stainless steel has a high resistance to rust. It withstands   corrosion from most oxidizing acids and is often used for kitchen and   food applications. However, it is susceptible to corrosion from   chloride solutions (notably saline environments with high amounts of   sodium chloride). Chloride ions can create localized areas of   corrosion, called ""pitting,"" which can spread beneath protective   chromium barriers to compromise internal structures. Solutions with as   little as 25 ppm of sodium chloride can begin to have a corrosive   effect.   (source [website]which tells that 304 is fine for non-chloride setups. In beer-brewing terms would that mean that I am fine with 304 if I brew (chloride-reduced, i.e. not a Gose). ?  "
2202,To Keg or not to Keg,"I've got a very lovely and quite potent American IPA that I've brewed several times now, from experience I know it'll get down to 1.006 in about 2 weeks if the temp is ideal.  The brew has been in for 2 weeks but as the ambient temperature has dropped so much it's only at 1.010 so not yet complete.  now my question! I either keg today or leave it for 2 weeks while I'm away, will it be ok on the yeast for another 2 weeks or should I just keg knowing that it's not yet complete? (my pressure keg should keep it at 15 psi)  Further question, if I do keg should I add the priming sugar or trust that the pressure that's inevitably going to be there from continued fermentation will be enough to carbonate?  I'm such a noob at this stuff. "
2203,Adding water and sugar to secondary fermentation,My first fermentation bucket's volume is 19 litre and my bottling bucket's is 23 litre. Can I add 3-4 litre of sugar and water to it for secondary fermentation? Will it affect the taste in a bad way? It is wheat beer by the way. 
2204,How is fermentation affected by a long boil?,"When making our seasonal beer we ended up getting a pre-boil gravity sample that was way higher than expected, so we added water to dilute the mash. A new sample was taken and the first one must have been polluted because now we ended up with a to low gravity.   This lead us to a three hour boil to get the sought after OG. What can we expect from the fermentation? Is there any risk that the sugars we got are un-fermentable?  "
2205,"Does homebrewed beer have a ""Golden Age""?","In August I brewed my very first batch ever, an Amber Ale from Brewer's Best (kit). Six weeks later, I opened up the first bottle and was astonished - it tasted pretty darned good!  Over the course of September and October I drank almost all the bottles, and had about 6 left coming into November.  This past weekend, I hadn't drank one in about 2 or 3 weeks, and so I cracked one open. I poured it into a glass, and it looked totally normal. Good head on it, no visible particles/""floaters"", etc. But when I went to taste it, it was super strong (alcohol), and after a few sips I tossed it.  I opened a second one - same thing. A third one, same thing.  My theory is that the yeast have been fermenting inside my bottles this entire time, and that the brew's ""sweet spot"" (that is, where taste and alcohol content were perfectly balanced) or Golden Age was back in September and October. And that now we've past that Golden Age and there is simply too much alcohol in the bottles now to be enjoyable.  So I ask: Is my theory correct? If not, what the heck is going on? And if so, is there anything a homebrewer can do to correct it or prolong a bottled beer's ""Golden Age""? "
2206,Is 1mm thick enough for a Stainless Steel kettle?,I've been looking to upgrade from my 15L Aluminium Pot I use on the stove to a Stainless Steel kettle I can do full boils in (for 20-25 Litre batches).  I'm trying to be reasonably thrifty with this and have found some 38L Stainless Steel stock pots on eBay going for a good price. However I noticed these are only 1mm thick. Will that be thick enough?  I am planning to install an element into the kettle itself (with weldless fittings) rather than heat it directly on the stovetop (I'm currently in an apartment with no outdoor space for a gas burner). I'll also most likely fit a ball-valve. Will the thickness matter when drilling holes and adding weldless fittings? 
2207,Big beer extract impact?,"My system can comfortably mash up to 10kg of malt. But it can easily fly sparge only 5kg. 8kg is doable, but stretching it. In my recipe I have:   5kg Pale Ale  1kg Munich I 1kg Munich II 1kg Melanoiden  2kg DME  candi sugar, caramel etc added later Belgian yeast    Previous incarnation of this ale was using no DME and 8kg Pale Ale (rest unchanged) and it was delicious. I decided to substitute 3kg of malt with 2kg of DME to only sparge once.   Problem is, it turns out that I only have 3.5kg of Pale Ale. I'm 1.5kg short. Possible solutions:   Buy more. More authentic taste, but sparge will be long.  Buy DME or LME. Easy sparge, bad for pocket. Taste impact?  Use more Munich I and II. Cheapest, I already have it. But would alter the flavor. On the other hand, it's supposed to be malty.    How bad would be using extract or Munich? I'd prefer it to be either cheap or easy.  "
2208,Why nitrogen is produced during mash-in?,"I naively thought that mash-in was only producting sugars via the alpha and beta amylase, but it seems (from Briggs) that total nitrogen (TN; protein), soluble nitrogen (orprotein) and free amino nitrogen (FAN) are also produced.  Why are they important in beer? Is it correlated to the amount of fermentable sugar or is it something completely different? "
2209,Why some brewers mash-in for two hours?,"Some brewers mash-in for two hours, whereas it seems that most of the sugar is extracted during the first 30mn.  While the difference between 30 and 60mn mash duration have been explored, I still don't understand what mashing for two hours would be useful for.  It seems from  that the difference between 60 and 120mn of brewing is of 2% of non-fermentable extract and 0.8% of fermentable extract, at 65°C, which seems very low.  So, if this was in order to extract more fermentable sugars, why not continuing the mash-in for an extra hour ? Is there something else hapenning when you mash-in for two hours? "
2210,"First brew - OK to substitute malt/hops, and how much water should I be boiling?","I've been reading John Palmer's How to Brew and I'm getting ready for my first brew day in a few days. I'm aiming to follow the basic 'Cincinnati Pale Ale' recipe that he provides but I'm going to have to substitute some ingredients and I'm just wondering if it will be OK to do this.   His recipe:  OG = 1.045, 30 IBUs   1.5kg pale malt extract syrup, unhopped 1.1kg amber dry malt extract 6 AAUs bittering hops 5 AAUs finishing hops packet dry yeast   My proposed changes:   Malt: 1.8kg amber liquid + 1kg pale dry Hops: Just one variety of the local 'Cascade'-style hop.   Questions   Will I have to compensate in any way for the malt changes? I understand people target different OGs/IBUs for the style they want, but will this be OK to produce a first brew? Regarding hops, mine are 7.3% AA so I'm thinking I'll use 6AAUs of them for bittering and probably none for finishing in order to keep it simple. Does that sound like a reasonable plan, or should I use some for finishing in order to get more AAUs?  In terms of boiling the wort, I have a 50L aluminium pot - should I boil the whole amount of water (~20L) with the malt and hops in it, or should I do what Palmer does in his recipe and only boil part of the final volume, adding the rest into the fermenter? I'm a bit confused about why he wouldn't boil all the water and ingredients together as I thought that produced a better wort, but I've also read that some people only boil small amounts of water and then add it to the rest in the fermenter...   I know this is probably a bit weird but I'm not experienced enough to know what will just 'work'. I'm not that worried about what will be 'best' - just trying to get a first brew out that tastes like a decent beer and doesn't fail. Thanks in advance for reading and responding. "
2211,Is it safe to allow strawberries to ferment for 60 days,"I've added frozen strawberries to the primary fermenter for a Cider I'm making. I plan to ferment 30 days in primary, then transfer to a secondary for another 30 days.  Question 1: Is 30 days to long for strawberries to be left in the fermenter? I don't want them to go bad.  Question 2: Will the strawberries help continue to flavor the cider if I move the strawberries to the secondary fermenter? Will the strawberries last another 30 days in the secondary?  Thanks in Advance, Cheers! "
2212,"""Makeyourowndrinks"" Cider smells like sulfur and turned a brownish colour, is this normal?","Let's start by saying that I've done a bit of research about this already, so please understand that I am struggling to find a specific answer to my question.   I'm using a Mixed Berry Cider kit from ""Makeyourowndrinks"", details can be found at makeyourowndrinks.co.uk and this is the first kit I've attempted so I'm learning a lot.   I sterilized as instructed and measured as instructed and have attempted to keep the batch around 20c (fluctuates between 18c-22c at most).   Around the 4th day, I started to notice a strong rotten eggy smell (As I beleive to be sulfur) and the colour faded from dark purple to a dark browny/orange. The batch is still bubbling away nicely so I'm curious as to if I need to intervene here?  A lot of people online mention the sulfer smell is normal in Cider making and will slowly fade although some also say it's something to be worried about?  Please provide me with a bit of advice about the correct colours and smells for these types of kit and put my mind at ease? Thanks.  "
2213,When to add sugar to big belgian ale?,"I'm brewing a cross between Belgian Dark Strong and Barleywine. Currently it is it's third day. Starting gravity was ~26 Brix (~1.11 Specific Gravity). I want to push it up with candi sugar, muscovado, dry demerara sugar and caramel. I'll need almost 2kg of these for the effect I want (30 Brix).  Now, I want my yeast to ferment most malt sugars before I'll add simpler ones. There are sources suggesting that yeast may lose ability to ferment maltose if there is too much simple sugars available. But I don't want to wait for yeast to go dormant either - I'm pushing it 2 percent points above yeast strain alcohol tolerance, so I need them to be active and plentiful.  So, when should I start adding sugar? What should I look for? "
2214,Used Wrong Yeast.... Final Gravity Too High,"I am considering two techniques for lowering my specific gravity but am unsure if my methods will work. I am currently fermenting a bock style. It's not a true bock because I don't have the ability to lager, so I used an ale yeast, specifically, Safbrew T-58, per a friend's recommendation.   My original gravity was 1.071. After taking 5 measurements over the course of a week, the gravity has stopped at 1.025. I was hoping for it to be a little lower, but I became concerned when I read this yeast may not be ideal for high alcohol brews. Temperature has been ideal according to package. I can't do much about room temperature anyway because my brewery is a spare bedroom in my house. My conclusion is that fermentation is not prematurely stuck, it's just the yeasties are are maxed out and done all they can do.  I bought some nutrients and a pack of Safale K-97 dry ale yeast which said ""high attenuation"" on the package. I don't want to make a whole starter and repitch because I'm worried that will void out my previous SG readings.  So here is my question. Can I just agitate the wort a bit and repitch the new yeast with the nutrients (without making a starter)? Do I need both or can I just add one of them? Should I be satisfied with this? I feel that the beer is too sweet right now. Primary fermentation finished almost three weeks ago. "
2215,Are Iodine tests reliable?,"I would be interested to know if iodine tests are a reliable way to know that all the starch has been converted to sugar.  For instance, is it a good way to know if after 30mn of mash-in all the sugars have been converted? Is there a risk of false negatives? false positives?  Please note that this question is different from this one because I'm not asking if iodine tests are useful in practice (I do not use it for now and never felt that I had to) but I would rather like to know if they work effectively. "
2216,How Much (and How Fast) of a Drop in Temperature can (Ale) Yeast Tolerate? (And Preliminary Results from My Experiment),"I have rigged up a Raspberry Pi with some DS18B20 temperature probes that measure both the water in the swamp cooler and the beer directly and store the results in a MySQL database.   I brewed a new batch on 7/18, and fermentation began on 7/19, from which I have put varying amounts of frozen water bottles into the swamp cooler on 8 occasions.  Here is the pattern I have currently noticed for adding frozen water bottles during primary fermentation (the patters may well change after the primary fermentation due to the lack of exothermic reaction present):  1) The water in the swamp cooler reaches its minimum temperature in about one hour. 2) The fermenting wort reaches its minimum temperature in about two hours. 3) The wort maintains its minimum temp + 1°F over the next two hours, very slowly working     its way back up over the course of 5 hours after reaching its minimum 4) Both swamp and wort temperatures tend to equalize in three hours. 5) The temperature drop in the wort is roughly 40-60% of the temperature drop in the swamp   Now my main question is how much of a drop of temperature, in how fast of a time period, can yeast tolerate without dropping out? (Ale in particular, but Lager too if you know the answer). Would starting temperature also factor in--i.e., if starting temp was 75 and minimum temp was 70, would that be different than starting 70 minimum 65?  For example, on my first attempt the wort's temperature was 70.250°F. By placing three frozen water bottles in the swamp cooler, the wort's temperature dropped to 65.861°F in two hours.  On another attempt, the wort was initially 69.350°F, and three frozen water bottles dropped it to 65.412°F in two hours.  On another attempt, the wort was initially 69.125°F, and four frozen water bottles dropped it to 64.850°F in two hours.  On another attempt, the wort was initially 67.212*F, and four frozen water bottles dropped it to 63.162*F in two hours.  On another attempt, the wort was initially 68.100*F, and five frozen water bottles dropped it to 65.600*F in two hours (Interesting, smaller drop this time)  On another attempt, the wort was initially 67.230°F, and five frozen water bottles dropped it to 61.800°F in two hours.  Two hours ago the wort was 67.200°F, and five frozen water bottles have dropped it to 62.967°F.  In the future I will be posting graphs comparing the wort to the swamp with the number of frozen water bottles if anyone else is as interested in this as I am. "
2217,Is my copper wort chiller still good?,"I haven't had the chance to brew in about two years and I've been storing my copper wort chiller in a storage locker for most of that time. Upon moving and retrieving it yesterday, it's got some really interesting coloration on it. The bronzed color is worn off in little splotches and circles here and there. I'm not sure what caused it (be it storage with too much access to the air or improper cleaning the only time I used it).  I have a couple of questions:   Is it still good? If it is, do I just want to clean it as outlined here or will I need to do something special because of that? cleaning copper Will these spots, where it almost looks oxidized or as though paint has chipped off, cause any potential problems with brewing or flavor?   Thanks a bunch! "
2218,Small bottles for sampling,When I am bottling my beers I tend to do so into 22oz bottles and usually have enough remainder to make one 12oz. I was wondering if it would be safe to bottle the remainder into 8oz or smaller bottles to open one at a time up to taste how the beer has aged/bottled? Could this potentially be a bottle bomb? Where can I get small bottles that I can cap and what is the smallest I can find? 
2219,Lagering an Ale,"I was wondering what would happen if I brewed an ale, let it sit through its normal time period at traditional ale temperature (let's say, one month), and then lagered it at 40˚F for 1-4 weeks?  I would imagine if one were to go this route, he or she would remove the fermentor from cooling for a few days so the yeast would re-activate, before adding priming sugar and bottling? "
2220,Refrigerated bottles when they were not finished bottle conditioning,"I had three more days of bottle-conditioning to go on one batch of beer, yet I accidentally put them all in the refrigerator instead of a different batch that was finished.  Can I just pull them out of the refrigerator? Will they continue to bottle condition and carbonate even though I have already cold crashed them? "
2221,Why is it necessary to approximate starting and finishing gravity?,"In the book ""Home Beermaking"", by William Moore, it talks about calculating starting and finishing gravity in chapter 6. I believe that he's talking about when I get good enough at homebrewing to make my own recipes, as the current recipes I'm using all have an approximate starting and finishing gravity already listed.  My question is: ""why is this important?"" Is the only purpose of calculating starting and finishing gravity to relate how much alcohol content the beer has to another individual looking to make beer from your recipe? If so, why can't one simply measure the starting and finishing gravity when first making the recipe (since undoubtedly the only way to determine if a recipe is good is to make it at least once), and then relate this to others?  Is there something about the approximate starting and finishing gravity that will tell a brewer whether or not the beer will balance before making it? "
2222,Does Thomas Hardy use a separate bottling yeast strain?,"Combing through the miriad different ideas about brewing a Thomas Hardy clone, I've become confused about what the consesus is about how ""the real thing"" is brewed.  WLP099 is associated with ""Thomas Hardy"" on Mr Malty, and has a high alcohol tolerance.  But my question is, do they just use that at bottling time to carbonate?  If so, then what's the first yeast strain that gives the flavor profile?  It looks like there are some people saying it's Wyeast 1084 (Irish Ale) or Wyeast 2206 (Bavarian Lager). "
2223,Use of lactic acid,"I've been reading through Beer Craft by William Bostwick and Jessi Rymill, and there's a lot of really interesting variations for basic recipes.  I'm aiming to try their Saison recipe, and it says that for a ""Sour Saison"", you can add 14g of lactic acid when bottling (for a 1G batch).  My LBHS sells lactic acid in an 88% solution.  So if I need 14g, that's about 0.5oz, but divide by 0.88 to account for concentration; 0.56oz.  Is that right?  So, I could just follow the recipe, and I'm sure that it will turn out correctly.  How intense of a sour effect can I anticipate, and is there much room for adjustment? "
2224,Bad (dead) yeast? What now?,"Brewed an ESB yesterday, pitching Wyeast 1028 @ 70 degrees F.  Stirred and shook carboy for oxygen, then airlocked and moved moved to the basement.  This morning, carboy is @ 71 degrees F with NO activity in the carboy or airlock.  OG yesterday was 1.060 and it's the same this morning.  I was slightly concerned about the yeast before I pitched it.  I had popped the activator and left the pouch at room temperature for 5 hours, but the pouch had not expanded much at all.  Though I'm a newbie, right now I'm thinking there was a problem with my yeast.  If so, what next?  Can I just pitch new yeast?    UPDATE:  Racked to secondary on 8/1, gravity at 1.013.  Bottled on 8/6 with gravity at 1.012, which is a little lower than expected (1.014 was my calculated target.)  I'll update again in a couple of weeks after start sampling it.  UPDATE#2:  This is good stuff.  I'm quite happy with it. "
2225,Vacuum sealing hops,Is it a good idea to vacuum seal hops for storage using the method described in this video?  I Often buy multiple varieties and have partially used packages laying around in my fridge until the next time I'm brewing a style they fit (both pellets and dried whole). 
2226,Could I have accidentally made 19% cider by adding too much sugar?,"First time I've brewed anything and I thought i'd start as simple as possible, so I just got some granulated sugar and apple juice from concentrate. 2L of apple juice, Champagne yeast, and 2 cups of sugar (I couldn't find any recipes anywhere). I measured my starting density to be 1.21 (water being 1.00), and after 2 weeks fermenting at about 22C in a PET demijohn I have a density of 1.06.  I calculate this to give me an ABV of 19% roughly.   This seems to be too high to be accurate, so I wonder if anyone has any suggestions above and beyond just 'your hydrometer isn't working' as to what's happened? Does this sort of measurement sometimes indicate the cider is unsafe to drink or anything like that?  EDIT: All measurements were done at room temperature of 20-25C "
2227,Would adding a small dash of whisky when bottling kill secondary fermentation?,"I assume that secondary fermentation's upper limit is set by some balance between sugars remaining and alcohol content, is that fair to say?  Would giving just a dash of flavour potentially wreck the secondary fermentation process? I am planning on bottling and throwing in a sucrose pellet. "
2228,dry hopping with pellet hops,"I am working from an ESB recipe that says to put 1 oz of whole leaf tettnanger hops in to dry hop during the secondary fermentation. I accidentally got pellet hops instead.   Can I get away with dry hopping with the pellet hops? And if so, should I scale back how much of it I use?  "
2229,When should I add orange peels to my homebrew?,"I've been planning to experiment with orange peels for a while now, but I don't know when to add them, when should I throw them in?  Last 15 minutes with the aroma hops? At flame-out? After primary? I have no idea really.  I read somewhere that citric acid and other compounds in oranges can be harmful for the yeast or inhibit their activity. Should I use fresh peels or dried ones, what are the chemical nuances to orange use in homebrew?  Thanks in advance for any advice or pointer, links and articles are very welcome! "
2230,Is a yeast-starter without temperature control worse than no yeast-starter at all?,"EDIT: Crap, it appears I mislead myself. Northern Brewer includes a temperature range of the particular Wyeast you are using, and I assumed this temperature range factored out off-flavors. I read on this stackexchange that it is a good idea to let the temperatures rise after the initial 3-5 days of fermentation. I assumed this meant to the top of the temperature range specified by NB/Wyeast. My Belgian Ale I allowed to go roughly 78*F during the day times. My Cream Ale I allowed to go specifically 71-72*F nearly round the clock. Regardless, I enjoyed this discussion and learned something about yeast starters and temperature!  I have used a yeast starter for my last 3 batches. Two of these batches are bottle conditioning for carbonation, but I took two of them out to test a few days ago.  They were so full of esters that my neighbor referred to the first one as ""Bananna Beer"", and the second one as ""Strawberry Beer"".  ...  One of the batches that I am annoyed about in particular was a Belgian Trippel that took about 6 weeks (+2 weeks bottle conditioning) and required a secondary, and was the most expensive extract I've bought so far. The other batch was a creme ale that took 2 weeks (+ 2 weeks bottle conditioning).  I've never had the fruity-beer problem because I've done a fantastic job at controlling temperature with a swamp cooler.  However, I can't use a mini-swamp cooler with my yeast-starters, as my home-made stir-plate can't hang.  Questions:  1) Is fruity flavoring always and everwhere a side effect of high-temperature and ester production, or may sanitation problems also generate fruity flavoring?  2) If fruity flavoring is always and everwhere formed by high-temperatures, is it better to forgo a yeast starter if it is not possible to control the temperature of the yeast starter? I also figured that maybe a 12 hour yeast starter at night time would be better than 72 hours in higher heat.  Thank you. "
2231,Makeshift carboy,"Can I use a large jug, such as a Carlo Rosse bottle, with an added airlock as a carboy for fermentation? Are there any issues with this or things I should make sure to do? "
2232,How often should a keg be disassembled and cleaned?,"Right now I give my corny kegs and beer lines a hot rinse, PBW soak, rinse and Starsan in-between batches. I inspect for gunk but don't fully disassemble (posts, etc.) unless there's something obviously wrong. I usually re-lube the lid O-ring to ensure a good fit, but nothing else.  Is there a rule of thumb for how often to completely disassemble and re-lube a keg? Does the lubricant degrade? Are there places I can't see where gunk builds up that I should check more frequently?  (This is curiosity only. I'm not currently having any problems.) "
2233,Cold water extraction of hop flavors from fresh hops?,Am hoping to get some fresh hops this year and was thinking about the best way to put them into my wort. Was trying to come up with a way to add them to secondary for dry hopping without causing a potential infection. What I came up with was to drop them in boiling water for 5 minutes to sterilize their outsides and then quickly cool down that water. Then let them steep in RT water for a while (a day or so). Then add this sterilized tea and hops to the secondary fermenter.  Has anyone ever tried this? Or is there a more obvious method I am missing?  
2234,How can I save my beer after long delay before bottling?,"I have a home ale brew in a tub from a kit, and I added 20 teaspoons of sugar to the beer as instructed (the equivalent of 1 half teaspoon per bottle) but this was about 10 days ago. I haven't bottled it yet and I'm not likely to be able to for another 5 days.  I was aware that the addition of the sugar was what caused the gases to accumulate. So after so long, have I ruined the brew? Is there some way to save it? "
2235,Not getting enough juice from my apples,"I've just made a batch of cider from 16kg (35 lbs) of apples. Based on various sources (example), I expected to extract about 8L (1.75 gal) of juice - however, I only managed to get about 4.5L (1 gal), which I feel is too little trade off for the cost of the apples, nevermind the time and effort.  My method: I first chopped the apples into quarters using a kitchen knife, then ran them through a fruit mill to create a pulp. The pulp was then pressed using a press (both the mill and press are similar to the ones depicted here - apologies for the link to a commercial site but I don't have pictures readily at hand).  One thing to note: I thought the flesh of the apples seemed a little drier than some juicy eating apples I've had before. I'm wondering how much a role the type of apple play in the conversion ratio. The apples I got were a mix of ""seconds"" from a local orchard, mostly eating apples that were discarded due to cosmetic issues.  What can I do to get more juice out of the apples? I'm open to all suggestions but have a preference for non-electric means. I'm aiming to get closer to the 2/1 (kg/l) ratio that seems to be achievable using standard methods. "
2236,What exactly is krausen (and why does this batch not have much)?,"...and as a followup, how much should I care?  I've always used krausen presence as a rough indicator of fermentation vigor in primary.  But my current batch hardly has any, with a few days at never more than a half inch.  It's definitely going, with a bubble every few seconds from the airlock.  However, it was a slow start (almost 24 hrs before activity) and it's never felt like it was going too strong.   But it got me thinking: what exactly is krausen, and how reliable an indicator is it of fermentation health?      As a matter of interest, this is what I did:   1.5 gallons (ferm vessel is a 3-gal carboy) 2 lbs light DME 1 oz Cascade - 30 min @ 160F 2/3 oz Cascade - 15 min @ 160F US-05 (a full packet) current temp is about 65F   Some possibilities I can think of for why krausen is less on this batch:   No boil = proteins coagulated differently than I'm used to I poured the wort through a strainer instead of siphoning Light &amp; simple wort = less proteins than I'm used to? Slow start = bad yeast? ...though some people say US-05 can work slowly in general Yeast is a living thing, thus every batch behaves differently, RDWHAHB.  "
2237,Storing the kegs outside during the winter,"Many of us don't have refrigerators for these 50 liter kegs and the CO2 tank. With due care not to expose the CO2 tank in direct sunlight, to what temperatures will these pressurized kegs be fine with 4% alcohol cider inside them ? How about 7% ? "
2238,removing sugar / dead yeasts / residues from keg,"Due to some CO2 cylinder carbonation problems I have resorted to the desperate method of pouring sugar into the keg. Which is probably bad, as I have found out here all I needed was lower temperatures and appropriate tubing.   Fortunately, my sugarized keg did not start fermenting due to the lowish temperatures in the room it is deposited in. I should mention that there was some carbonation in the keg when I have poured the sugar (I got a geyser out of it at pouring time). What should I best do now  ?  a) rack it and re-attempt the pressure-carbonation at lower temps ?  b) move the keg to higher temp, let it ferment the sugar and then     b1) move it to lower temps and leave it like that       b2) rack it off the dead yeasts then move it to lower temps, and lose lots of acid in the process   Or else ? "
2239,Do I have to bottle my wine immediately after stopping the fermentation?,"I have a gallon of very sweet kiwi wine. I've racked it twice already but after couple months in at it's current stage it still hasn't cleared. I want to let it sit in the carboy until it does clear but at the same time I don't want it to continue getting stronger (the wine is very sweet so there is plenty of sugar still to be eaten and for some reason the yeast seems to be pushing well beyond its nominal tolerance of 14% ABV).  Is it ok for me to stop the fermentation now (with campden tablets and Potassium Sorbate) but leave the wine in carboy for a few more months until it clears? Or will it spoil? If that's OK, should I sterilise with Campden tablets once more before bottling to prevent spoilage? "
2240,Mold on Cider is it unsafe after boil,Mold on Cider is it unsafe?  It tasted good strained the mold (blueish) and boiled the cider for 20 min.  I plan to put the yeast and fruit in tommorrow.  Will the boil and yeast take out the mold bacteria? 
2241,Priming solution or add sugar to individual bottles?,"From what I've read, it seems that the old technique of adding a given amount of sugar to each bottle for priming isn't recommended anymore.  Instead, just about every source recommends boiling priming sugars in water and adding the cooled solution to the wort before bottling.  Why is this?  It seems to me that by adding sugar to individual bottles, I don't have to worry about uneven carb levels from a non-uniform mixture of my priming solution.  Reasons I've thought of:   Convenience: not having to measure out the sugar for 50 bottles Convenience: not having to worry about bottles with different volumes Sanitation: the sugar gets pasteurized (is this really a concern?)   Are there other compelling reasons I haven't thought of, or does it just come down to convenience?    EDIT: This motivation for this question was bottling small batches, in which priming just a few bottles is an equivalent amount of work to batch priming. "
2242,Low FG due to cacao nibs?,"I recently brewed an oatmeal cream stout from the Mashmaker book (recipe here [website]Main difference initially is that I added some cacao nibs to the mash.  I hit the OG, however the FG has come out at 1.032, rather than the expected ~1.015...  I had read the yeast I was using is highly flocculant, so I pitched some more after 2 weeks, to no avail. Fermentation schedule looked like -    Day 0 - 18C, pitched 1 smackpack 1318 London 3 yeast Day 6 - 21C, roused yeast, gravity 1.032 Day 13 - 21C, still 1.032, added 1 pack dry Garvin/Nottingham yeast Day 17 - still 1.032   For completeness, I scaled this down to an 11L brew:   Maris otter   2240g Flaked Oats   263g Roasted malt (blackprinz) 230g Pale Chocolate    209g Crystal 120 (Dark Crystal)    164g Lactose   263g Nugget @ 60min    16g Cacao nibs (mash) 49g Cacao nibs (secondary)    98g   Any thoughts on what might have gone wrong here - could the cacao nibs have somehow impacted the amount of fermentable sugers in the mash? (or are my sums just off..?) "
2243,Ginger Beer ABV from Bakers Yeast,"I’ve made ginger beer a few times. I usually make it with just fresh ginger and raw honey. Usually the I get well less than 2% ABV.  This last week though I used a different honey, sourced from a farm, it was really raw and had a distinctly wild honey smell.  After making the cordial and allowing to cool I mixed with water in my brewing vesseI and used 12g ~ 0.42 oz of bakers yeast, I made roughly 6GAL / 20L worth.  IG = 1.046 and after 4 days, SG was 1.014 !! That’s 4,2% ABV, after 4 days controlled at 21C / 70F.    Could Honey as the sugar base really be that effective to convert to alcohol that quickly?  Can bakers yeast create that much alcohol?    Is this right, what is wronge where?  "
2244,How much power do I need on gas stove to boil 30 liters of wort under 30 minutes?,"I'm aware of this answer to How to brew all-grain indoors. It says      It gives a good rolling boil and doesn't go all floppy when it's hot. It has a 2kW element holds 29 litres   That's nice, about the volume I need, but it looks insulated. We'll be buying new gas stove to our apartment, preferably one with 5 burners. Sadly, most of them only have 3.8 kW on central burner. Of course, on a gas stove I can't use any insulation around my pot, it would be a fire hazard. 5kW stoves are max I could find, but are either expensive or aesthetically lacking.  Given that issues - is 3.8 kW enough? Is there a general way to calculate required power for given volume? Or pre-calculated tables for home brewers?  "
2245,Affordable cooling solutions,"I have been advised that controlling fermentation temperature is the first thing I should do to try and improve the quality of my beer.  I gather I can get a temperature controller (such as the one from Inkbird) and plug this into a cooling device - but what would this device be?  I've seen the following suggestions so far:   Put the fermenter in a water bath, possibly with a t shirt wrapped around it to act as a ""wick"" (I've seen this called swamp cooling). This may achieve lowering the temperature below ambient (although I don't know enough thermodynamics to understand why) but still offers no fine control - seems like all it achieves is an unknown decrease in mean temperature and maybe a little less fluctuation. Buy a fridge. I've not been able to find a mini fridge which would fit more than a single demijohn in it. A full sized fridge is impractical and expensive. Invest >£1000 in a sophisticated glycol cooling system from somewhere like Ss Brewtech.   Does there exist a cooling solution which costs under £100 and is compact enough for use in shared accommodation? "
2246,My mead wont stay carbonated!,"I have a strawberry mead that I am attempting to make sparkling. I added sugar drops to each bottle (Im bottling in 12 oz bottles) and after about a week it seems very carbonated but when I pop the cap off I have to do it slowly. I open it a bit, the mead bubbles up like a shaken up soda pop, and then I have to close the lid and let the bubbles subside before openning some more and starting the process over.  Can anyone tell me how to keep it from bubbling up when I open it?? "
2247,Yeast pitching temp/ ferment temp,"I have read here and there that it is ok to pitch your yeast at a high temperature, say 83°F?    Seeing as it will take a considerably long time for the temperature to drop to an ambient 68°F then what about the esters or off flavours which may occur during the cooling down time ? Will there be any if using Safale 04? "
2248,Kegging and dispensing over distance/elevation using keg pressure or something else,"A few years ago I set off to turn my kitchen dry bar into a wet bar by routing beer from my kegerator to the taps 10 or so feet above.  I was advised against it by some employees at my local home brew store who said that I'll just end up with a lot of foamy warm beer.  As a result I built a bar on casters over a kegerator, which was admittedly pretty awesome, but still less integrated than I'd like and really bulky.  I just moved and I'd really like to build that actual bar I had been planning years ago.  Based on a 10 foot rise, and assuming that rise is 100% exposed I estimate a 4.3 psi pressure drop assuming there is no transfer pump being used.  Also, it appears about 1.8 ounces of beer would be exposed to warmer climates outside the kegerator.  possibly more due to horizontal runs but it will also be run in interstitial space where there is no heat.    Here are my questions:  How do real bars do it?  Do they actually use refrigerated lines and transfer pumps?  What if the runs are small? (assuming the runs are &lt; 20')  Does anyone see this being a problem if I use insulated beer line and just keep my serving PSI at ~15-16?  I generally serve in the low 40's (good beer doesn't need to be 32 degrees), so I need 15-16 psi to keep ~2.5 volumes over time anyway. "
2249,Can yeast survive being almost frozen?,After forgetting to place the yeast starter in the fridge overnight I placed it in the freezer this morning for a short while to do a quick cool crash. I misjudged the time and the water above the yeast cake has begun turning into a frozen slurry - though it is not completely frozen. I had a 1.1L starter in the freezer at -17ºC for roughly 1 and 3/4 hours.  I've read on other questions that if frozen it will rupture cell walls and viability will have been seriously affected. Given that this did not completely freeze over am I OK to brew? At what point during freezing is yeast ruined? 
2250,Neutralizing yeast prior to backsweetening,"It’s coming up on the third week of secondary for my first mead batch and my intention was to sterilize the yeast culture with campden tablets and potassium sorbate. I added the correct dose of each for a 5.5 gallon batch after the SG reached 1.002. I assumed this would be dry enough that it would halt further fermentation, but 48 hours later the airlock is still bubbling at a period of about 18.3 seconds. Shining a light through the must shows fine bubbles rising to the top. I’m going to take another SG reading soon to see if there’s been any further changes, but do you think this would be safe to backsweeten without serious complications? The ABV is approximately 13.66% and the yeast I’m using (Lalvin 71-B) has an alcohol tolerance of 14%. Are there any further precautions I can take such that I don’t just send this thing into tertiary fermentation after racking? "
2251,How to fill a corny with shop bought mini-keg beer?,"I have not had time to get brew ready for Christmas, so I’m looking to at least fill my Corny kegs with some shop bought beer I.e. 5 litre keg or a box of cider, just so people have the novelty of serving it from the tap when they come over.  What should the procedure be? What are the risks? Will the beer just taste stale after a few days? Etc? "
2252,Brewferm Abdijbier + buckwheat honey = a bit of a bitter flavour - Help please,"I have made one Brewferm beer before (the Grand Cru which turned out very well) and in an attempt to run before I could walk, when I came to make the other one I had (the Abdijbier) I thought it would be nice to replicate a buckwheat honey beer I had in Poland, so decided to exchange some of the sugar added at the fermentation stage for buckwheat honey.  I replaced about 1/3 - 1/4 of the sugar with honey and checked to make sure I had the correct OG as indicated on the instruction sheet.  The brew has been in a bucket with lid and airlock for a couple of weeks and I've just transferred it to a second bucket for clarification.  The SG is around 1.016 and there hasn't been much sign of bubbles over the last few days, so I'm not sure if it has reached a point where it is stuck and won't get to the recommended optimal bottling density of 1.010.  However, my main concern is that on tasting it, it is a bit bitter. Is it best just to leave it for a bit and see if it mellows, or could I add a bit more sugar at this stage to sweeten it up a bit? Any thoughts? Is it too early to panic, or the right time to act? "
2253,Where should I take the temperature readings while mashing?,"This is probably a newbie minor detail but this matter is bothering me!  When the wort is boiling, due to natural convection, the tun should have a pretty homogeneous temperature. No problem here! But while Mashing, where should I take my readings?  Should it be near the bottom of the tun, so I have the maximum temperature and don't over cook my wort? Should it be on the top? Middle? "
2254,Comparing Espresso Stout to a Coffee Stout,I'm curious to hear everyone's take on the differences that they perceive in an espresso stout vs a coffee stout. Is this something that you would classify as a widely different beer or very similar? If you find them to be vastly different how would you go about adding your coffee to the beer? 
2255,fermenting temp,"I have read that the temp during fermentation can be as much as 8 deg F hotter than the ambient room temp. this I did not believe although I know that some brewers brew with their FV placed in a bath of colder H2O, However I decided to check this out,my results were that the temp of the ferment was 4 degrees F LOWER than the room ambient !!  ?? I am using SafAle T58, this is day 5, brew was 1043 at start.Can anyone shed any light on this please? "
2256,How much special yeast do I need?,I have seen this particular beverage and I want to brew this at home. How much fluid yeast do I need to collect to make 1 gallon of this particular high end brew? How do test for yeast content?   [website]
2257,What kinds of beers are there that don't use hops?,"I'm thinking about the next brew, and want to kick it up a notch.  I have heard of beers that don't use hops.  I don't know where to start in my research, so I apologize for the broad question, but what kind of beers are there that don't use hops?  If you have brewed any of these styles, do you recommend me to try them (or recommend I NOT try them)?  Thanks. "
2258,Growlers v 12oz Bottles,"As an about to brew newbie who foundly remembers his grandfathers home brew bubbling away back in th e late 50's &amp; 60's when iy was actually (still) illegal) in 20g ceramic crock (w/nothing but cheese cloth over the top) i've got a couple of (nery) newbie Q's:  1) what was wrong with that initial fermentation process he used in an uncovered ceramic crock  2) when it comes to bottling now, v 12oz bottles and caps why not just use 64oz growlers @ about 1/2-1/3 the cost?  you're gonna drink it anyway, maybe a couple of points a night, w/o 'sharing' it so a growler will be empty in 2 dyas or... 2hours so... why NOT just skip the whole expense/hassle of 12 oz bottling in favor of a 'greener', cheaper alternative in 64oz growlers?  seems like ez 'math' to me > thanks > Ken "
2259,Should I stir this (possibly stuck) batch or not?,"First time brewing, made a lot of mistakes and now I'm concerned that my fermentation is stuck.  Am I just being paranoid or impatient?  Six days ago brewed this stout recipe:   6.6 lbs Briess ""traditional dark"" LME   0.25 lbs roast barley   1 oz cascade hops   0.5 oz willamette hops     WYeast labs 1084 irish ale yeast  Make a few mistakes:  - Got impatient and pitched yeast around 78/79°F, wort had stratified temp wise, top was much cooler than bottom (where I was reading), since I had used a concentrated boil. - Didn't aerate as much as I could have before pitching.  Thought this might be okay, since I used tap water in the carboy, sparged the wort into it, then topped it off, but in retrospect, maybe not. -Stupidly, did not take a hydrometer reading before pitching yeast.    Anyway, for the past three days gravity has been stuck at 1.021, when the recipe says to expect to get to around 1.010 - 1.014.  I can live with the difference in ABV, but I don't want to bottle with unfermented material in there and make grenades.  So my question is:  should I stir this batch and possibly raise the temp (currently 68°F) to get the yeast going or am I just being paranoid, the batch is done, I should bottle and condition it now?  Am I over-thinking this?  At any rate, I learned a lot of lessons about paying attention to temperature, taking readings, etc, so I don't think it's a loss either way.  If I SHOULD stir the batch, how do I keep aeration to a minimum?   Thanks! "
2260,A new beer with a hint of soy,"I want to brew a beer, with an approx. alcohol content of 5% that incorporate's a hint of a soy flavor to it. Considering that what process would I need to use. Pilsner? Or another type? "
2261,On scaling a recipe's gravity...,"If I have a recipe for a beer that I'd like to simply make bigger, what should be taken into account when scaling the recipe?  Imagine I have an amber ale recipe that I like.  It comes in with an OG of 1.050 and an FG of 1.015, which is about 4.5% abv.  Now imagine I want to boost this recipe to get it to about 8% abv.  Should I just up the total amount of all grains (or extract) used, keeping the percentages the same?  Would doing so affect the color?  What about hops?  Should I shoot for the same number of IBUs, or should I up the IBUs to account for it being a lot maltier?  I know I can play around with recipe software to figure out how much of each ingredient to use to hit the same color &amp; bitterness, but that won't tell me if the recipe would ""work.""  Have you scaled recipes in this way before?  How did it work out? "
2262,Using Burnt Caramel / Brewer's Caramel in Recipes,"Has anyone worked with using either burnt caramel or brewer's caramel in their recipes?  I have read a few places that Fuller's is known to use this to increase the SRM of some of their product line, specifically London Pride.  What I am wondering is:   How much is generally used to increase the SRM?  I am assuming that this will mostly end up being a trial and error sort of experiment over a few batches with no ""hard and fast"" rule. How will this affect the OG of the recipe?  Even though it is basically just caramelized sugar, I am assuming that it will not have the same properties of sugar because of the carbon reactions that have taken place.  (And specifically, I would like to be able to figure out the value to add as an item in BeerSmith.)   Thanks, in advance. "
2263,Adding chili peppers to beer - when?,"I'm making a chili beer tonight. Is there any sort of extraction that needs to happen, or is just adding the chili (I'm gonna puree it) enough?   I'm thinking of adding a habanero (or a half of one) during the boil, and then something else in secondary. Is there any difference about when you add it? "
2264,Can Star San kill yeast in the secondary carboy?,"I've had a little trouble with carbonation after bottle conditioning lately.  A few consecutive batches actually.  I have started replacing items such as my bottling bucket, hoses and the like.  I'm down to my glass carboys as a suspect.  I sanitize them with Star San and let them dry, I don't rinse them as per the intsructions.  A rep with 5 Star came to one of our homebrew club meetings and explained that letting the Star San dry will form an active anti-bacterial barrier that will for a while provide protection against contamination while the carboy is empty.  I seal the carboy with a cap for the week that it is not in use, however, I have not been rinsing it before transferring my delicious beer into it.  I'm wondering if the ""still active"" Star San is hindering my yeast and that is why my beer is not fully carbonating.  Any thoughts?  Any experience?  Should I look at something else as the culprit?  I have since started rinsing out my carboys so I will know pretty soon if this fixes my problem but I'm just curious if any of you have any thoughts. "
2265,odd film on my cider,"I went to rack my cider into a secondary, pulled off the lid of my primary and saw this whitish film. I racked it and the film  stuck to the sides of the primary as the cider level dropped off.  cider film [website]Anyone know what that is? The cider didn't smell or taste off, I'm assuming that this was caused by yeast somehow? perhaps a wild yeast that didn't get killed off by my campden addition prior to pitching?  SG was 1.060 gravity when I racked was 1.000 so it's pretty much if not completely done fermenting.  The bulbous spots are air bubbles stuck under the film. The dark spots are allspice (or other mulling spices) floating at the surface just under the film. "
2266,Sloe wine: going very slowly,"Since I had enough sloes left over after doing this year's sloe gin, I have a demijohn of sloes fermenting - the first home brewing I've tried. About 2kg of sloes, boiled down with 2kg of sugar, and some wine yeast provided my more experienced brewers.  It's clearly fermenting, but is going very slowly - only one 'glub' through the air lock ever thirty seconds or more. I tried adding even more sugar, and it didn't help.  There's a lot of non-sugar material in there, so is this sloth to be expected? Does it indicate that the yeast is processing the more complex fruit sugars instead of the simple sugar? Is it just going to produce the right result very slowly, or will it fail? Is there anything I can do to find out what's going on in there? "
2267,"Old Brown ""sour belgian""","I have an Belgian sour that has been in it's secondary for 18 months. With a terminal gravity of 1010 for over the last year, what is the best way to bottle condition this beer? New yeast? Blend? "
2268,Kegging at basement temperature,I am a novice at kegging. I don't have room for a kegerator or chest freezer so I simply keg at basement temperature. My basement is currently 69 F and I've had 5 gallons of tripel on pressure for 3 weeks now at 25 psi. The beer is still very lightly carbonated. Is this normal?  I was figuring it would take 10 days at 25 psi and 69 degrees F to properly carbonate. Could there be a problem with my keg?  It seems to hold pressure just fine... 
2269,I want to brew this American IPA kit with some ginger -- terrible idea or give it a go?,"Love the taste of ginger, came across Papazian's Dark Gingered Ale recipe and wanted to try it out but I've already got ten gallons of dark beer in the house and I just bought this American IPA kit... would it be a terrible idea to add 1 or 2 oz of grated ginger for fifteen minutes during the boil?  My inclination is to just experiment, but I'm relatively new to homebrew and don't want to do this if it's just guaranteed to taste awful.  Also, I notice a lot of recipes that use ginger also use honey.  Any advice on incorporating honey into this recipe?  Any other spices I should throw in?  The American IPA kit:  Grains for steeping: 1.5 lbs American 2 row, 8 oz CaraHell, 8 oz CaraVienne  6.6 lbs Extra Light Malt Extract  1 oz Columbus pellets, 1 oz Columbus pellets (30 minutes), 1 oz Cascade pellets (1 min)  Wyeast 1056 American Ale yeast   OG: 1.062  Thanks in advance ya'll! "
2270,Kegging home brew,"I have a Cornelius system and I'm wanting to keg my home brew.   I'm curious if you need to prime the beer to help with carbonation or if you just add wort to keg and carbonate from co2?   If you do it this way, does anyone have any recommendations for how much pressure &amp; for how long?   I did keg a five gal. keg last year and it got some carbonation but it didn't last very long. I had the beer for about 2 months and at the end it kept some carbonation sometimes but not for the whole time I was drinking it. "
2271,How do you convert between SRM and Lovibond?,"For instance, if a grain is specified at 300 SRM, what is the equation to convert that to Lovibond? What is the equation to convert it back? "
2272,Add finings to beer to be bottled?,"I've got a chocolate stout fermenting at the moment, and I'd like to add finings to this once fermentation is complete.  I haven't done this before, so wondering what the best method is?  I'll be bottling this beer, I assume I need to add the same amount of brewers sugar to each bottle like I normally would? "
2273,What would make a good mulled ale?,"I just came back from a festival that was serving mulled cider and mulled wine.  I've heard of a few mulled beers, such as buttered beer, so I know people must make them.  Has anyone out there tried making one or tasted someone else's?  What type of beer would be good for mulling?  What characteristics would shine through or stand out at high temperatures?  Also, is it even worth carbonating in the bottle if you're planning to mull it? "
2274,What does gypsum do?,"I'm brewing from an Austin Homebrew extract kit, and it came with some gypsum.  I thought gypsum was only for modifying water chemistry, but there seems to be some other schools of thought around.  So:   What does it affect? When/how should it be added? How much should be added?  "
2275,Hop utilization,"I've been thinking, especially after brewing my last IPA, about getting the most out of my hops.  The higher the SG of your wort, the less you get from your hops, so the more you have to put in.  I've been thinking about boiling a seperate gallon of water while my beer is cooking and throwing half of my hops or more into the seperate one gallon of plain water with a specific gravity of 1.000.  This will allow me to get the most out of my hops, then after 55 minutes or so, I'll poor this into my boiling wort.  Will this work?  Does boiling the hops seperate from the wort have a drawback that I'm not aware of?  I'm sure that there is some interaction between the wort and the hops during the boil that I'm missing.  I'm curious though. "
2276,Baking yeast for brewing?,Has anyone ever used the ubiquitous Flesichmann's baking yeast for brewing? Is there a fermented beverage style for which it works particularly well?  
2277,Is it okay to store a batch of mixed star-san?,"I use a spray bottle with star san, so I don't use a lot of it each time I brew.  Is it okay to store the rest in a bucket and then refill my spray bottle when I need some?  I've read that it should be okay if the pH remains below 3.0. If it goes above 3.0, should I make a new batch of star-san or just add a little concentrate to the mix to bring it back in line?  What if the bucket starts getting mildewy? Should I throw out the batch and make a new one? "
2278,How to Properly Oxygenate Wort,"How much oxygen do I need to put into my wort?  I've heard that homebrewers need to aerate with an oxygen stone and either aquarium pumps or oxygen.  Is this true, or is shaking my carboy enough to get proper oxygenation?   How much oxygen is needed?  Does it vary based on the wort? How effective are the various methods?  "
2279,Why measure gravities?,"I've brewed a good dozen batches of beer from kits, extract, extract+grain, and now all-grain, and I've never measured gravities. Why measure gravity, besides to know what you're getting? Is there any advantage to putting the beer in the secondary as soon as the measured gravity has finalized, instead of just guessing observing that the fermentation is done? Any other reasons? "
2280,Wrong yeast....cloudy beer?,I was planning to make an IPA and was planning to use wyeast #1056 but i think that I mixed up my yeast with another guy at the store cus after I pitched i noticed that the yeast I had added was actually Wyeast #1275 Thames Valley Ale.  My beer is really cloudy still after a week in primary and another week on secondary.  Does anyone know if this will ever clear or maybe it is just what that yeast produces? 
2281,Is it necessary to aerate wort when pitching onto an existing yeast cake?,"To my knowledge, aeration provides oxygen so that the yeast can reproduce before fermentation. If you're pitching onto an existing yeast cake, there should theoretically be enough yeast already to begin fermentation without needing to reproduce.  Should the wort be aerated anyway (or should it not be)? Does the particular beer make a difference (i.e. pitching the same recipe as before vs. pitching a different recipe)? "
2282,Cold Break with a False Bottom,"Historically, I've cooled my wort with a immersion chiller and siphoned it off to the carboy once it gets down to a reasonable temperature.  I recently installed a false bottom and ball valve.  This works well and the elbow attached to the ball valve avoids most of the hop material (whole leaf), but I am seeing a good bit of cold break going into the carboy, which i could avoid with the siphon.  Am I missing something here?  Would whirl pooling work (i'd think not, since the material would just collect in the center of the false bottom and go through the screen)?  I don't have a huge problem with the cold break, but my main purpose of installing the false bottom was to limit the trub from transferring.  Edit: here is a shot of the latest batch after draining through the false bottom: [website]"
2283,can I fix an oversparged brew?,"I've been a batch sparger for many years, but after moving from propane to electric, the new rig can also fly sparge, so I've been trying that.   The first two beers came out with a permanent haze, despite using isinglass finings and cold conditioning, and there is a noticeable astringency - it tastes a bit like iced tea. I'm guessing I have oversparged - final runnings were 1.004 and the sparge liquor was 82C, which I now know to be way too high.  Is there anything I can do to improve the flavor or remove the tannins? The beer is a Bass ale clone, and London Pride clone.   Edit: as brewchez suggests, I'll be fixing my process - I've calibrated the RTDs so sparge temp should now be correct, and I've got a refractometer and pH meter to monitor the sparge. But is there anything I can do to improve these 20 gallons of beer? How about gelatin, will that strip out some tannins? "
2284,How long can homebrew stay in the primary fermenter?,I just put down my first brew and should have bottled it last week but had something come up.  How long will it be good for?  If I bottle it this weekend will it still be good or is there something I need to do? 
2285,How should I design my new home brewing space?,"I am moving into a new house, and the garage in the back garden is just screaming out to be converted into a home brewery.   I realise planning a brewing space depends on a lot of specifics (space available, equipment used etc) so rather than focus on my own specific requirements, I was hoping that the group could share any plans or ideas on how best to layout a brewing space in general.  Are there any practical do’s and don’ts, have you done anything to your brewing area that has made life easier, do you have any advice on storing equipment and ingredients etc.? Assuming you have lights, electricity and a water supply, where should you go from there? "
2286,Can I dry my own yeast to make it relatively shelf stable? How?,"Obviously, it can be done, as dry yeast works for fermenting beer.  I go sometimes a month or two between batches, and carrying over one yeast culture across beers seems a bit of a pain.  How is dried yeast made/ packaged?  Is it something a homebrewer can reasonably do? "
2287,Cold and Hot Break,"OK I have been brewing for over 2 years, and have cranked out around 40 batches.  Trying to really hone in my process and improve the quality of what I make.  I am literally reading (and re-reading) every book I can get my hands on (Mosher, Papazian, Palmer, White, most of the jedi masters)...When I first read ""How to Brew"", I recalled Palmer stating that everything from the brew kettle can go into the fermenter.    Now I'm reading Radical Brewing, and Mosher suggests creating a whirlpool so the break collects in the middle, then siphoning into the fermenter.  Was planning on trying this, but had some issues with my siphon, so I ended up just dumping the whole brew kettle into the fermenter (as I have done many times before).    I have heard that the trub has some good yeast-building stuff in it (which will be helpful as this is a 1.088 OG Roller, hit with a quart WL Saison II starter).    I seem to remember reading something on here that a lager was split into two batches, one with trub, one without, and the trubbed brew actually clarified better and allowed the yeast to work more cleanly.    Any definitive data out there??!! "
2288,If some of the yeast doesn't get into the fermenter does it matter?,"I just made my first home brew. I have learned many lessons including that if I move the fermenter to its resting place after I add the yeast some of the yeast gets stuck to the glass, and I can't work out a way to move it. I have no way of knowing whether it is 5% or 30%.  How big an effect will this have? Will it make the fermentation take longer? "
2289,May be too much carbonation on the way,"Bottled up a fig-gose a week ago, and figured I would try one last night just for kicks.  Big hiss and and about a 1 inch head.  Plenty of carbonation now, but it is still 'young' carbonation (big, rough bubbles, etc).  A little worried about bottle bombs or gushers.  Can/should anything be done?  Move them to a cooler part of the house?  The priming calcuator I used has an input for ambient temp, which I put in at 65 degrees (though my house has been closer to 68).  I don't have a chamber for specific temp control (next on the list!)  Here are some stats: -used corn sugar  -4.75 gallons  -used a berliner weisse as the style into the calculator, which I believe carbs to 3.45 volumes CO2 (since there is not one for gose, but the style should be on the effervescent side)  -OG of 1.060, FG of 1.015  6.8oz corn sugar  I guess in short, if it is carbed to my liking, should i try to crash it down as best as possible to halt the yeast?

2290,Do I truly need a wort chiller?,"I am on the fence with this one. Is there any reasons other than ""Shorter brew day"" or ""contamination worries"" for using a wort chiller?  I brew 2.5 gallon batches of wort in my pot, and either 1. cover it with the sanitized lid and immerse it in an ice bath in the sink, or set it outside in the winter.  The lid will protect it from contaminations and the bath/outside reduce it to 70 degrees in about 30 min. So I am saving maybe 10 minutes with a wort chiller? And I have something extra to clean up and sanitize later.   Am I missing some great need for a wort chiller that i am not seeing? "
2291,Fruit Beer Question (use of fig and style recommendation),"I am trying to brew a beer for my brother's 50th birthday in late April (who had a large part in getting me into homebrewing, though he has since hung it up).  He is a huge fan of figs, so I thought I would try to incorporate them into a brew.  Typically, he's into the hoppy end of balanced beers (not particularly into complex malt-profiled beers, porters/bitters, etc.), and can get into some mega-hopped beers.    I brewed a fig-gose by adding 12oz of pureed fresh figs to the boil @ 5min, along with the coriander and salt.  It was somewhat of an experiment, since I felt like I had some time to mess around before I needed to deliver the batch.  The finished product is good, drinkable, but a bit cidery, i'm guessing because the majority of the fig sugars fermented out.  A couple of questions/requests for advice:  1.)  Should I stick to a simpler style such as a Gold/Blonde/Cream Ale since my bro isn't really into lambics/wits, etc. that might be more receptive to a fig?  Maybe I could brew another gose and add figs to a secondary, as I thought the style would work well (below-threshold saltiness with a fig essence to balance -- my understanding is traditionally this style can be served with fruit syrups)  2.)  Should I addand simply add the figs/fig puree to the secondary to get more of the fig essence?  I was somewhat worried about sanitization which is why I added them pre-fermentation.  Any ideas on how to sanitize the figs?  Boil a puree then cool?  3.)  Any suggestions on a more suitable style?  Thanks! "
2292,Mash tun shape - does it matter?,"Or mash tun aspect ratio, if you like.  Tall and skinny, or short and wide?  I know a deeper grain bed (tall and skinny) will be better for lautering purposes, but will a flatter grain bed (short and wide) be better in any way?  I've read mixed reviews online, but thought I'd solicit some opinions here.  I'm batch sparging now, but will likely move to fly sparging in the future. "
2293,Temperature Swings While Bottle Conditioning/Carbonating,"I brewed a GLBC Christmas Ale Clone in November, trying (futilely) to have it ready for Xmas Eve.  Had it in bottles two weeks before, but to no avail. As this beer finished up around 9.3%abv, the yeast in the bottles had a lot more work to do given the boozy conditions inside the bottles.    After 5 weeks in the bottles (ambient temp in my house is around 65 degrees), and virtually NO carbonation (despite my priming sugar calculation on Tastybrew.com), I found a spot that generally stays 70 degrees or warmer:  a shelf above my dryer in the laundry closet.  Shook the cases really well, stored them up there, and was able to be patient enough to forget about them for exactly one week.  After one week up there, I noticed significantly more carbonation.  A much more pronounced 'hiss' when opened the bottles, plus about a half inch, quickly-dissapating head.  Also, there was good carbonation in the first few sips, giving way to a flatter beer by the end of my bottle sample.    A few questions:  1.)  When the dryer is running, it can get up to 75-78 degrees in that spot.  When it isn't, it is usually around 70.  Are these swings harmful to the beer?  2.)  Since there was no carbonation for so long, does this simply 'reset the clock' for carbonation?  In other words, the louder hiss tells me there is a lot of CO2 in the headspace, but will this dissolve into the beer?  Not to be a maniac, but I am looking to get the nice, soft carb bubbles that you get from a well-conditioned beer (they help make the alcohol heat more palatable!)  3.)  At a certain point, will I see any benefit from cellaring the beer at 60-65 degrees?  Given the ABV of this one, I am hopeful that it will age well.  When would you all start the cellaring process?  I'm thinking to leave them up there for two more weeks, then stick them in a cool corner of the cellar to age, let the flavors meld, and the alcohol mellow out.    Thanks in advance.  This is my first really big beer (1.093 OG), and I realize that these are not for the impatient.  I'm just curious as to how best to get this beer into its prime.   "
2294,Bottling high Alcohol beer,"I have been researching this on some blogs and have seen info on this topic but not an answer to this question. I have brewed a 10.6% Belgian tripel with an FG of 1.02 about 6 weeks ago (secondaryed at 2 weeks). The yeast I used is Wyeast Belgian Abby which is good to about 12%. I have read that due to the higher ABV I should think about repitching yeast a day or two ahead of time. I have seen a lot of suggestions to use champange yeast due to its alcohol tolerance. My question is this: If I use a different yeast shouldn't I be worried that the new yeast may consume the residual sugar as well as the bottling sugar, thus not only changing my flavor profile but making bombs as well?  My plan is to siphon off about a cup of the beer into a beer bottle and add some sugar and cover it with a balloon to see if the yeast is still in suspension. Once I bottle it for good I plan on letting it sit for a good 2 mo in the bottle, so even if it is really slow to carbonate I would think I should be good. Any thoughts on this couse of action, while I'm at it? Thanks.   "
2295,Yeast Starter Stopper & Sanitization,"I'm going to be making my first yeast starter, for a higher gravity beer.  While reading starter guides, and watching videos, I've noticed that there are several different techniques and opinions for the flask stopper. It seems that the common approach is to use a piece of sanitized aluminum foil, loosely wrapped around the top. I've seen others use airlocks, but have seen just as much on the side, recommending that they be avoided.  I bought a starter kit which included a semi-dense foam stopper (from NB). It appears that it will allow permeation of oxygen, which I understand to be important for the starter. I will soak it in sanitizer before I cap the flask.  Will this be an effective stopper? Should I skip this and go with the common aluminum foil approach?  I'm also worried about sanitization. How does the starter stay safe from infection if it's not airtight? I know it will only be exposed for a day or so, but I'm still curious about possible infection. "
2296,Substituting American Two-Row for British Pale Ale Malt,"I would like to brew Jamil's Dry Stout from Brewing Classic Styles, which calls for ""British pale ale malt,"" but I happen to have about 75 lbs of 2-row malt already, and I would like to use it.  Can I add some percentage of specialty malt (Munich, perhaps?) that would give my 2-row substitution a more English character? "
2297,Why is my starting gravity low?,"In the fall of 2011 I made the leap from extract/partial kits to all-grain kits. I'm enjoying AG, but my SG is continuously below the expected. I have brewed 5 AG kits and 4 have had a low SG.   My assumption is my sugar extraction during mashing (or sparging) isn't optimal. I heat my mash water to 165 and mash the grains for 60 minutes. Mashing levels out at 152. For Lautering I heat the water to 175-180. After I drain the initial mash I add the lautering water and let that soak for 10 minutes. the temperature levels out around 170-172. Then I drain into the kettle and being the boil.  I aim for a gentle boil just enough to break the surface tension. I boil for 60 minutes, chill, rack, take a reading and pitch yeast.  Here are some of the numbers  type            expected     actual  kit st paul porter  1.052        1.039   [website]belgium strong  1.067        1.055   [website]troegs hop back 1.063        1.049   [website]The fuorth was the Phat Tyre kit from Northern Brewer. Can't remember the SG though. It was low. They taste great, but the numbers weren't ""right"". What can I adjust so the numbers are more inline with the recipe?   Update Thank you for all the feedback. There are a number of factors for me to review and adjust. Given my current setup I will follow @mdma advice and recirculate the wort once and extend lautering to 30 minutes.  It will be a week or two before I can attempt this, so it will be awhile before I report back again.  Update #2 I now have some awesome local contacts who are helping me out with technique and trouble shooting. Another (major) issue I could be experiencing is draining the wort way too fast. According to my friend. The drain should be low and slow after cycling a gallon or 2 of wort. sparging should take ~2 hours. for each gallon drained plato/brix should drop 3 points and go no lower than 3-5 points at the end.  the second recommendation is to heat up 3-5 gallons of water to 180 and poor it in prior to/while sparging.  my first attempt using this technique proved successful with the gravity being a lot closer to the anticipated OG. I had some temp issues with the batch, but I was so focused on sparging that I ignored the temp. My guess is I would have been right on if my temp didn't fall so low.  Update #3 I had the chance to brew with my mentor this weekend and he pointed out 2 glaring problems with my mashing technique.   Starting mash temp is too low. I was heating my water to 10-12 degrees above target temp. He recommends 17 degrees. between grain absorption &amp; the tun itself most of the heat dissipates within the first few minutes. This does go against what I originally said. That I was hitting my temp marks. Looking back I was hasty with my readings. I should not dump my sparge water (or lauter?) into the tun while draining the wort. The idea is to compact the liquid into the bottom of the tun thus compacting the sugars. I am stirring up the mash when I dump all sparge water in. We kept our sparge water 1-2 inches above the grain bed and our final results we excellent.   A 3rd recommendation he made was to lower the pH of the water. tap water is ~7 and the ideal mash pH is 5.2. He added a solvent, which I cannot remember the name of, which did this for us. I'll be picking up some of that this weekend.  Thanks to all who helped me out with this problem. "
2298,"How to sanitize a 10"" cylindrical beer filter?","Do you soak it in sanitizer?  Boil it?  Do nothing?  I saw one on Amazon last week for like $30 and I figured what the heck, pick it up and I'll try it out, but now I'm not sure how I'd go about doing that. "
2299,Irish Moss - powder form?,"I have a Oatmeal Stout recipe that calls for 4 tsp/ 1 gram of Irish moss powder. The LHBS had Irish moss, but I wouldn't call it a powder. They're small flat pieces maybe the size of half a grain of rice. Should I pulverize it in a morter and pestle? I would assume this would make it more efficient. Or just measure out a 1 gram and not worry.  If I use my (near impossible to sterilize) morter and pestle, is there any concern that the irish moss would not be sterile? Its going in the last 10 minutes of the boil.  Thanks! "
2300,"Quick fermentaion, what should i do?","I made a batch of cider 6 days ago, and it started fermenting nicely, however now the bubbles in the air lock have slowed to nearly 1/min (according to my recipe means it's fermented) However this is really quick! it's pretty hot here (we've had a few 35 degree C days) Will it be alright? should i rack it? also, should i go about a secondard fermentaion? cheers "
2301,"Extract brew, sanitizing hop strainer and tap? First brew day!","Last night I made my first ever extract brew.  The brew day went pretty well. As I have a 32 litre brupak boiler with a hop strainer and tap I cooled the wort with cold bottled water straight in the boiler and ran it out through the tap when cool. This was really easy and hopefully served to aerate the wort. It took quite a while to boil 6 litres of water on the stove though which doesn't fill me with confidence at the prospect of a full-volume boil!  No fermentation action yet but I'll try to be patient, it's only 10 hours later!  I have a few questions that came up - any help would be greatly appreciated.   I have an airlock on the FV, which goes through a rubber grommet in the lid. Should I have put vaseline on that for a better seal? The seal seems pretty good but I'm sure I've read something about vaseline. What do people do about cleaning and sanitising the hop strainer and tap/ball valve on the boiler? Is it sufficient to run a load of hot water and detergent through it, relying on the fact that it gets hot to sterilise it next brew? Or do I have to take it apart? I pitched the yeast (Safale 05) at 24 degrees but I wonder now whether I should have waited (it was bedtime!). If I've ruined the yeast is there anything I can do about that? Chuck more in? When it comes to bottling, how can I start the syphon between primary FV and bottling bucket without putting my mouth on it?   Cheers! "

2303,Fermentation hasn't started?,"Made a kit on Saturday, 1/2 lb. Caramel 80 specialty grain, 9.15 lbs rye extract. Kit came with the Wyeast American Ale smack pack. When I got the yeast pack out of the fridge, the pack was already smacked, so to speak. The inner sugar pod had already been breached at some indeterminate time, and so the yeast had eaten and gassed, etc. Since I had no idea when this had happened, I figured I was better off using some of the dry yeast I had on hand. So, I pitched 1 packet of Safale-05 Saturday around 5PM.   Sunday went by, blowoff tube was quiet, and I started thinking one packet wasn't going to be able to deal with 1.075 SG. Sunday night I went to my fridge full of jars, pulled out the jar of S-05 culture, made 2 pints of starter with a half cup of dextrose and poured that in Monday morning. Before opening the bucket lid to add the starter Monday morning, the blowoff tube was burping a little bit, so I figured the extra yeast would make sure everything got going great. Since then, silence. No activity as far as I can tell. It's pretty cool where the bucket is, air temp around 64, and the bucket was sitting on the tile/concrete floor. So I put it in a tub this morning and filled it up with 65 degree water. Did I pitch 32 oz. of infection/disaster into a fermentation that was doing ok? Or is the cool temp keeping things from getting going? "
2304,WLP 566 Saison Long Fermentation,"I brewed up a saison/BGSA 13 days ago, OG of 1.088.   Don't have the grain bill/fermentables handy, but there was a good bit of sugar/highly fermentable adjuncts.  Pitched a 32oz starter with this yeast almost two weeks ago @ 68 degrees.  I realize that this is a little low for a saison, but I am looking for low-to-moderate esters, plus I don't have means to increase this up to the 80s.  Short lag time and heavy airlock activity after 12 hours, continuing for a few days.    The crazy thing is, there is still visible airlock activity now, two weeks after pitching (temp has remained constant per the therm strip @ 68 degrees, ambient temp of same).    will get a gravity measurement, but has anyone had this long of a growth phase with this yeast?    My first and only other time working with a saison yeast (WLP 565/Dupont) was a bit of a disaster, probably due to underpitching (one vial only), stressing the yeast, and going a bit overboard with high fermentation temps (got it into the high 80's)...I eventually had to rack it onto a hefe cake to finish after it stalled at .040.    Am I just gunshy after my last experience?  I have no problem leaving this in the primary for 4 weeks or more, to clean up diacetyl and get this beer dried out.   "
2305,"How do I translate my water supply's ""Total Hardness"" to Mg and Ca or ""Effective Hardness""?","My water supply comes through San Diego's Miramar treatment plant, and here's the data sheet. Here's the relevant part:                      Units   Avg     Range Total Hardness      ppm     214     142 - 243 Total Hardness      gr/Gal  12.2    8.3 - 14.2   And an excerpt from the footnotes:     Hardness is the sum of polyvalent cations present in the water, which is essentially the sum of magnesium and calcium. These cations are usually naturally occurring.   Okay, now, I'm trying to use this scale under ""Determining the Beer Styles That Best Suit Your Water"" in Ch. 15.3 of John Palmer's How to Brew:    What is my Effective Hardness? Is it the same as Total Hardness? (In which case, 214ppm seems very high on this scale—Is it possible my water is that hard?) Or, since the footnotes say Total Hardness is a sum, is my best bet to split 214ppm by some rough, sane-looking proportions like 75ppm Mg and 150ppm Ca, thus crossing over on the scale at about 145ppm Effective Hardness?  By the way, my CaCO3 level is 98.2ppm. Not sure this is relevant to hardness though—I imagine it's the non-alkaline Calcium that hardness is measuring.  I do know a store near me where I can get reverse osmosis water for 35 cents a gallon which is basically nothing. I'm more just curious about tap water chemistry, especially for amateur brewing.  Thanks! "
2306,When brewing from extract recipes should one assume dry or liquid extract if unspecified?,When brewing from extract recipes (e.g. Day After 1040A Wheat) should one assume dry malt extract (DME) or liquid malt extract (LME) if unspecified? 
2307,Does it make sense to steep wheat in cold water as it is heating up?,"I'm actually not talking about cold steeping. The recipe I'm using says     Put 2.5 gallons of cold, filtered water into pot. Added malted wheat (in muslin bag) to pot and brought the water to 180 degrees. Steeped the wheat for 30 minutes. Removed bag of wheat and brought the water to boil.   It sounds like it's saying the wheat should be added to the pot while the water's still cold, but that doesn't make sense to me. It must mean to bring the water to 180 degrees first, then steep for 30 minutes, right? "
2308,Foul tasting ale,I recently took up home brewing as a hobby and brewed my first (small) batch of ale. It was a simple recipe-   boil a litre of water with a LOT of sugar and some lemon juice let it cool pitch in the yeast wait for a couple weeks bottle and wait a couple of days.   The resulting brew was strong- it literally knocked me out but boy was it foul tasting. I've read about a 'cardboard like taste' being imparted in ales due to oxygenation. Could that be the reason behind the terrible taste of my ale? I'm pretty sure the brew got oxygenated while bottling.  Could someone please tell me how I could improve the taste of subsequent batches?  P.S.: I'm an amateur so I don't have a brewing kit or even a hydrometer for that matter. And I live in India so my ale was 'hopless' (we don't have hops here) 
2309,Cooler mash tun: prevent leaks from faucet,"I've add some mishaps with my standard Coleman-based mash tun, and I'm now left with a hole where the faucet was (some wort went inside the insulation, but I'd like to believe it won't impact temperature conservation).  I'm using a braid as filter.  I'm not a very bright handyman, hence:  Question: How can I put a faucet back in such a way that there is no chance wort can leak into the insulation?  How can I ensure that even when the braid is moved a bit when stirring the mash, no space will be created allowing wort to leak? I don't have the original plastic piece that fitted the hole.  My previous solution included some O-rings that got smashed by being on parts that were screwed too tight. "
2310,Priming sugar in kegs,Do you need to add priming sugar when moving beer to a keg?  Will the CO2 from the system be enough to carbonate it? 
2311,Is there a way to estimate the actual temperature where the yeast ferments without having a sensor inside the carboy?,"I was reading an article on fermentation temperature control where it says,     However, since yeast growth and fermentations are exothermic and therefore generate heat, figure that the temperature within the fermenter can be as much as 8 °F (4 ºC) higher than outside of the fermenter during the early days of fermentation. So beers that are fermenting in refrigerators set at 65 °F (18 ºC) are most likely fermenting at about 72 °F (22 ºC).   4 ºC is a huge difference!  Right now I have a carboy in a fridge that's temperature controlled to 19 ºC (on the lower side of the optimal range for WLP351). The sensor strip is taped to the glass of the carboy, and consistently reading 19.2 ºC.  I'm wondering if next time I should set the temperature control lower in the first 12 hours, but I realize I have no idea how that translates to change in different sections within the carboy—near the glass, the bottom, the top (where ale yeasts float, correct?), and so on. For example even if it's 19.2 ºC on the outside of the glass, the liquid touching the inside of the glass is probably much warmer due to convection.  Is there a gradient diagram or some rough formula that would help me determine the effective fermentation temperature (where the yeast actually is) from the outside glass temperature? Or, do I have to find a way to stick a (sanitized) sensor strip into the carboy. "

Instead of throwing them all into the fridge, I just leave them on the shelves and move them individually into the fridge the morning before I intend on drinking them after work.  Is there an optimal amount of time that a carbonated bottle of home brew should be in the refrigerator before it is opened?

2316,Is the air glug in a conical not causing oxidation?,"This is likely a silly question to a lot of you but I'm trying to weigh the pros and cons, no matter how minor, of a conical before I make the jump. I'm maybe too paranoid about oxidation, but one of the main selling points of conical manufacturers is less oxidation. I could actually argue the opposite: With the design of most conicals you're going to introduce oxygen, from the bottom, after you attach a second bulb and open the valve back up. RIGHT? What's everyone's thoughts on how much oxidation that can cause? Is there processes/valve designs that avoid this?  Currently I ferment in carboys and pressurize them to push back out the racking tube...mostly so that I can leave them in the bottom of my freezer w/o disturbing the trub. But also, depending on beer style and how long I'm going to age, I pre-prime the lines and keg and can probably guarantee very little contact with air...ever.  Now, I'm also leaving it in one vessel for primary, secondary, and sometimes even up to a week of lagering. So, the optimization I see by moving to conical is just getting it off that trub sooner w/o rerack. I hate reracking.  So what do you guys think? What's more important: avoiding that little bit of oxygen, or getting it off the trub ASAP? Can I get both?  FYI, conical(s) I'm looking at is the FastFerment. With a pretty tall collar, I'm thinking I can mount these inside a temp controlled freezer, and follow my same process, but get rid of yeast &amp; trub sooner &amp; more effectively.  "
2317,How much Gelatin in grams to add post-fermentation?,"I see recommendations to add anywhere from ""1/2 teaspoon"" to ""1 table spoon"" worth of gelatin as a fining agent. I'm surprised to see this, given that brewers on the internet tend to demand that hops, salts, and etc. be weighed on a gram scale.  So, how much gelatin in grams is required to clarify a beer? Does it depend on whether or not the beer is to be bottled instead of kegged? "
2318,What makes a beer malty and sweet?,"I've read multiple times now that ""malty"", as a taste, does not mean ""sweet""; it is therefor possible to have a dry, malty brew, or a sweet, non malty brew. Is ""malty"" the same as ""body"", or is ""body"" one component of ""sweet""?  What is it that makes a homebrew ""sweet""? Is it simply a high final gravity? A high final gravity relative to original gravity? A low BU to OG (or FG) ratio? What about a high mash temperature that results in unfermentable sugars -- does this lend only to an increase in body, or also an increase in sweetness?  What is it that makes a homebrew ""malty""? Is it simply the choice of malts? If so, which malts contribute a ""malty"" flavor, and which contribute a ""non-malty"" flavor? (Incidentally, what is the word for non-malty?) Is it possible to have a low body but malty brew? "
2319,How low an original gravity is too low?,"I just brewed this extract IPA.  I had 4.6 gal in the fermentor when I measured original gravity at 1.053 (@80 degrees), on the low end of the target range for 5 gallons (target 1.059, or 1.053-1.062).  Is this a reasonable deviation from the recipe, considering it would be even lower if I topped it off?  It sounds like most low gravity readings are due to the top-off water not being mixed.  I did not add any top off water, but I also did not mix the wort after pouring it in.  I poured the ~2.5 gal. of wort through a strainer/funnel over the 2 gal. of water already in the fermentor.   Is it still possible the heavy wort, despite being poured over the water, sunk to the bottom and thus gave me a low reading on the top?  So now I'm not sure if my beer is too strong or too weak.  Is there a way to tell whether I should add the remaining water during bottling?  For example, if my OG is low and my FG is high, maybe it would indicate my OG reading was wrong?  But if my FG is also low, maybe I shouldn't add water. "
2320,Keeping the keg lines and fittings clean,"I recently purchased a keg, and I've got a couple questions about keeping the lines clean. Specifically when the keg isn't finished, as the lines are simple enough to clean along with the keg when it's empty.  Right now I do not have a kegerator, and am using a simple picnic tap. I've been very busy and unable to drink my beer on a regular basis, so my keg gets tapped, we pour a few pints then everything gets packed up for another week or so. My question is about cleaning the beverage line and fitting. How often should I be cleaning it? Are there any tips for cleaning the fitting?  The one way valve on the fitting makes it difficult to clean, so I end up taking the line apart and washing the pieces separately. This is problematic because the fitting is sharply barbed and often requires me to cut away the tubing to take it apart. Is there anything I can do to make this easier? "
2321,green sludge floating,[website]I am brewing a double IPA. The beer is in the secondary and has been there for  10 days. I recorded 7.8% alc when I transferred it.

Thanks.   The picture I'm including in the link makes it look brown but it looks more green in person.  
2322,Stalled Fermentation? Or too much body from high temp mash?,"So I brewed a straight forward English style IPA with the following:  O.G. 1.060 F.G. 1.015 (estimated from Beersmith) Current F.G. 1.020  10g Gypsum 11 lbs Maris Otter 1.5 lbs Crystal 30 1 oz Columbus @ 60 min 1 oz East Kent Golding @ 30 min 1 oz Fuggles @ 10 min 2 oz Crystal Dryhop (I haven't added this yet)  1 Package of Burton Ale Yeast (The kind in the vial) 60 min Mash @ 153-154 (Beersmith Recommended 152) Batch Sparge 60 min Boil 5.5 Gal into primary  I didn't use a starter, I just pitched the yeast straight out of the vial. The fermentation didn't start for about 48 hours. Then I found the plug and blowoff tube had completely blown off and there was a large amount of beer sludge caked all over the fermenter and puddled all over the floor. I cleaned up and replaced the blowoff with an airlock. Once it stopped bubbling I measured the gravity over the course of the next few days and it settled on 1.020, a full 5 points high.   My Mash temperature started a touch high at around 155-156, then i threw in some cool water to drop it to 153. Did I just mash it too high and create a heavy body? Should I be concerned with a stalled fermentation? Or should I just go ahead and transfer to secondary for some dry hopping. Thanks! "
2323,Boil options with a small pot,"I'm about to make my first brew (from an extract kit), it's a 25litre batch (6.5us gal). Following John Palmer's advice I will be doing a partial boil. But the biggest pot I have available is 6litres (8qt). Can I do the boil in this pot, and top-up or should I forget the boil and just follow the kit instructions (add ingredients to 25l of hot water).  What are my options?  Edit: (after reading this question) if using pre-hopped extract, do I need to boil at all? "
2324,Aging beer/cider/mead in beer bottles for competition,"So, I'm in a process of planning for the next year competitions. In fact, I'm little bit behind since I'm planning to do big brews (few meads and beers).   I already had a similar thread about packaging entries using different types of corks, even though I've got my answer I've got more questions.  So, most of the competitions require 12oz bottles with crown cap. There are few exceptions, like Mazer Cup (mead competition). For them you should enter the product in appropriate package (like sparkling mead or 2-3 year old mead should be packaged in appropriate to style bottles).  So, my question is... How should I prevent my homebrew (beer/mead/cider) from oxidation over time in regular 12oz bottles with crown cork if waxing is not authorized? Is there some sort of shrink-sleeve that I could get specifically for beer bottles (and remove it before sending to competitions)?  Thanks guys! "
2325,Are Wine Bottle Bombs Possible?,"tl;dr - Can wine bottles explode?  I've read that when making wine, if fermentation isn't finished, it moght result in a sparkling wine. In the worst case, the cork might get pushed out, due to extra carbonation.   I bottled a mead back in January, and opening it now, it's carbonated. I did not expect that. Past meads didn't do this. This one was aged in a carboy for 5 months, fermented in primary for 1.5 months. Yet it's still fermenting, thus carbonating. Should I be worried about wine-bottle-bombs? Or should I just watch the corks, to see if they are pushing out?  Bottles are being stored on their side, so the corks are kept wet.  If any more info is needed for an answer, let know. "
2326,Is there any reason to re-rack and wait another week after dry hopping before bottling?,"Is there any reason to re-rack and wait another week after dry hopping before bottling? The only reason I can think of is for settling of residual dry hopped particulates. But if you don't syphon those out, is there any reason to wait? "
2327,What is the best way to measure temperature in a swamp cooler?,I am thinking about setting up a bucket-o-water/t-shirt swamp cooler for my primary fermenter. The ambient temperature is about 82degF and I would like to ferment an American Ale around 74degF. I have two questions:  1) Would cold water suffice or would I need to add ice packs?  2) What is the best way of measuring temperature of the wort?  Thank you for sharing your knowledge! 
2328,Mashing raw spelt/dinkel,I just got a hold of some organic raw spelt that I would like to use in a wit instead of flaked wheat.    Do I need to gelatinize the spelt? How do I do that? Should the grain be milled at some point? How much of the grain bill can be unmalted wheat?  
2329,Purposely underpitching,"So I am planning a roggenbier, partially because I want to try one, but largely to grow up a cake to make 15 gallons of weizenbock.    Hefe's are ok in my mind, but my palette basically just wants more malt character.  Voila rye instead of wheat, voila roggenbier.    I am going to keep the roggenbier on the low end of the style guidelines, probably around 1.050.  Mr. M. Malty indicates that one vial into 5 gallons is underpitching by about half (need either 2 vials or 1L starter).    I have heard that the hefe yeasts from any lab are the masochists of the beer world.  Pitch warm: no problem.  Underpitch: no problem either.  I actually do want a good bit of banana and a little less clove to come through in this beer to balance the earth/grit of the rye, however I was planning on fermenting relatively low, around 62-63*.    aaaaand now my question:  do I need to do a simple starter or would I be better off getting some good phenolics by stressing this yeast a little (a lot?)?  The last thing I want in this beer is fusels, but some good esters and weizen phenols would be great...oh and one final requirement: I'm trying to grow enough yeast for the weizenbock, MM says about a liter of slurry with 80% viability.   "
2330,Question about hop schedule and BIAB,"I've done three brews so far, one with a partial mash, one with only extract and one BIAB. I'm restricted to working with a 10L kettle (a little more than 2.5 gallons). For obvious reasons, this yields quite small batches. I've been reading quite a bit different BIAB techniques and have a question about something similar. More specifically, I'm curious about the difference between two ways of brewing.  In the first scenario, let's say we have 12.5L of wort to boil for an hour. The boil-off is 2.5L so that at the end of the boil we're left with 10L.  In the other scenario, we start with 10L of wort in our main kettle. But this was obtained using BIAB, and we re-use the bag in a second (smaller) kettle. So when the boil starts we are boiling 10L in one kettle and around 4-5L in a second kettle. As wort boils off in the main kettle, we add wort from the second kettle. Let's say we do this every 15 minutes.   The two scenarios obviously differ, but at the end of the boil they should have the same amount of wort left: 10L. A simple figure may illustrate this.   My questions are:    Is the second technique bad? Would the hop amounts be different in the two techniques (provided nothing is added to the second kettle)?  "
2331,Create your own Mr Beer cider refill?,"Ok, so I bought a Mr. Beer beginner cider kit, at the time, I thought it would be an easy way to get into the hobby of homebrewing.   However, the homebrew store that I got the Mr. Beer kit from doesn't sell the refills, and I thought, why use concentrate when I have a juicer anyways.  I presume that I should use 8.5 liters of apple juice? (the concentrate + water adds up to 8.5 liters) Is there any particular type of yeast that you would recommend for a plastic fermenter?  Any other suggestions for using a Mr. Beer set?  Thanks! "
2332,Threaded portion of corny keg - removable?,I am trying to change over 3 pin-lock kegs to ball type. I got the posts and they include the threaded portion that normally protrudes from the top of the keg. Everything went fine for 5 out of 6 posts but the threads on the keg for the last post must be worn or a slightly different thread size because the new post won't tighten properly. The guy who sold me the kegs said to just hammer out the threaded part out of the keg body and install one of the new threaded parts. Sorry this is clumsy - I don't know the right term for the threaded male portion of the keg. Anyway I'm a bit dubious about taking a hammer to the keg - it's not clear that this part is ever intended to come out - perhaps welded in place? There is rubber right up to the edge so hard to see how it is mated to the keg body. So... hammer or not? 
2333,Are there any effects of boiling copper immersion chiller with wort?,"I’m contemplating the use of a copper immersion chiller.  Currently, doing partial batches, I’m able to cool my wort fairly quickly in an ice bath, then adding cooled water in the carboy.  I’d like to go to full boils, thus researching the use of a wort chiller.  I’ve seen some people add the IC to the wort boil, to sanitize it.  Are there any affects to the wort by doing this (eg – metallic taste)?? "
2334,Xylitol with beer?,"I'm interested in brewing what I've heard is called a ""raddler"". It's pretty much a lemonade beer I am aware of some technical issues with this  style  such as lemonade is sweet and yeast eats sugar but let's say all goes well and the yeast eats the sugar leaving me with a tart lemon flavor beer.   I was wondering if anyone tried adding xylitol to the beer before bottling or kegging(in my case). Does the xylitol affect the yeast in any way? Will the lemon juice's high acidity affect the xylitol?  Thanks so much.  Kobi "
2335,Do I need to make a yeast starter,"I have made around 5 homebrews and have heard of yeast starters but have never used one. I have always used smack packs or dry yeast and just pitched that directly into the fermentation. They have all turned out fine, so now I am curious why I would use a yeast starter? Does it make for a better or faster brew? Do I only need it in certain situations? What other advantages could I be missing to using a yeast starter instead of not. "
2336,Looking to get a new grain mill and want some advice,"Long story long, I live next to a ""brew on premise"" and have always used their mill (barley crusher) to mill my grains. But now I am moving and time to grow up and get my own, does anyone have advice for which mill to buy?  The ""barley crusher"" seems to be a good homebrew mill (the B.O.P. just purchased a second after 1,500 batches) but it really seems to be a piece of shit, The B.O.P. has been running the grains through the mill twice for a year now. I want value, a ""barley crusher"" is [tex]150, but the ""monster Mill MM2"" is $150. The mill is the only thing that concerns me, I can make a platform &amp; hopper no problem.  I have read plenty of reviews but I want to hear from you guys who have mills and like them or don't, I know it's a long stupid question but give me some feedback... Please!  Also what is the difference between a two and three roller mill? What is the difference in mill material and knurling?  "
2337,Steeping Maris Otter Pale Malt,"I'm looking to do my first extract brew after doing a couple of kits and have found what claims to be an extract recipe, which uses Maris Otter Pale Malt grain.  Is this a speciality grain I can use for steeping with an extract brew? Also, is there anything I can look for in the future that signifies that a grain is suited to steeping in an extract brew rather than requiring mashing? It doesn't appear to be something that is advertised with different grains and appears to be assumed knowledge. "
2338,Why are Swings in Temperature Bad?,"I started brewing back in may, at the beginning of a Californian summer. I quickly learned that the swamp cooler was necessary to prevent unwanted ester formation due to a too-high of temperature for a given yeast. The swamp cooler isn't good enough, however, and requires substituting frozen water bottles 3x per day. This is absolutely excellent for keeping a ceiling on the wort temperature. However, the temperature swings beneath the ceiling can be pretty severe. For my current 4 batches going, I have put the ceiling at 66, but temperatures vary widely from 57-66, 24 hours per day.  I hear from this forum and others that temperature swings are also bad (that it will stress the yeast).  What is the reasoning behind this? I.e., too high of a temperature causes ester formation. Ester = off flavor.   Do the temperature swings, even with a ceiling on temperature, cause off flavors? Why. If they don't cause off flavors, why are they bad (other than swings that would cause a decrease in attenuation for going too low)? The swings are no doubt superior to ester production from too-high of a temperature, correct?  I would imagine that with a ceiling, a swing of 20*F would be bad as it would cause a lower attenuation. So for the second part of my question, lets add a theoretical floor to whatever temperature gives the maximum effective attenuation for a given strain. In this circumstance, with a ceiling (to prevent esters) and a floor (to retain attenuation), why would swings be bad? "
2339,Should I dump a batch with rubber smell?,"I have in bottles a batch smelling like chemicals or rubber. I'm thinking keep it a while, and check if the smell fade out. Is this possible? Or I'm just wasting my time with this batch?   As side note, this batch is, from a parti-gyle, a second run. The first run, a porter, is OK.  "
2340,How long does harvested yeast keep,"Just like the title says: how long does harvested yeast keep? I am assuming to keep the yeast you have to store it in the refrigerator, right? "
2341,Used large bottle caps now have uncarbonated beer,"Just noticed that i used the large bottle caps on my coffee stout and of course all the beer is not carbonated (tastes fine just not carbonated).  I wanted to make the move to kegging after i went all grain but i rather not loose this batch so i thought i buy a keg and force carbonate this batch. Can this be done even though i added priming sugar? Some of the beers were very lightly carbonated. The beer has been in bottles for about 3 weeks.  I was just going to pour each bottle into the keg, maybe thru a filter? Will i have any issues going this route? Anything else i can do to carbonate the beer? "
2342,Sugar source and alcohol content in Ginger Beer,"Made my second batch of ginger beer the other day, and not sure if different sugars perhaps produced a little more alcohol..  For my first batch, I used 2 cups of pure cane sugar and 1 packet of dry champagne yeast from red star to yield ~1 gallon. I let the bottles sit at room temperature for a little more than a day, then I dropped them in the fridge.  For my second, I doubled the batch, but instead of 4 cups of sugar , I used 3 cups, and ~13 oz. pineapple juice (Reed's uses pineapple juice, so thought I'd give it a try). I also added the cane sugar by making a simple syrup this time to make sure it all dissolves, as well as added some lime--neither of which should have an effect on fermentation(?). I pitched the same red star yeast after letting my pot sit in the fridge for a few hours to cool.  --Edit: I used 1# of ginger/gallon yield and 1 lemon for both. Those didn't change between batches.  I bottled it all yesterday and ran out of bottles (beer's taking them all up!) so I poured the left overs into a Nalgene bottle which I took to work today to see if it's carbonated. To my surprise/satisfaction, when I opened the bottle it announced with a nice 'tssh!' that it was nice and fizzy. However, after drinking a pint's worth, I'm pretty sure this batch is...different.   As a beer-brewing, red-blooded, beard-adorned American, I can tell when I've had alcohol, and I'm 95% sure this ginger beer is a little more 'special' than my first batch. Given I just ate lunch prior to drinking it, it must have at least 2% alcohol to make me even notice anything, or even think about it. My beer brewing experience says this doesn't make much sense, but then I remembered the key difference between this batch and the prior, and one thing I learned from nutritional science in college: fructose is the simplest of sugars, and pineapple juice packs a lot of fructose. The champagne yeast is probably having a party with the stuff--and I'm actually enjoying my Monday at work.  Does that at least pass the smell test? Could champagne yeast have turned that much sugar into a noticeable alcohol content in less than 24 hours? Is there that big of a difference between cane sugar, and fructose? Or was there potentially some weird fungus growing on the ginger root that I used, explaining my general euphoria at work today? "
2343,First time without a kit,"Ok, so I'm a relatively new brewer.  I've done probably 10 brews, however I've always done it out of a kit and have kegged it afterwards.  Brewing from a kit is super easy, it's basically boil it, bucket it, put it in a keg.  I have a few questions though, since I'm trying to brew without a kit this time.  I went to the homebrew store, told them what I wanted to make, and they gave me the ingredients, but I don't have instructions. First off, here's what I have:  1 lb Plain Extra Dark DME, A bag of grains, 5 oz lactose, Oats, 1 oz Czech Saaz hop pellets, Irish moss   I'm looking to brew a 1 gallon vanilla coffee oatmeal milk stout.  Can anyone help me out with what times and temperatures would be a good estimate to accomplish this?  What I'm thinking based on how I remember brewing from kits, I should boil the grain bag for about 20 minutes, reduce to about 165 degrees and add the hop pellets, 1 oz of lactose, and the DME for about 45 minutes.  The Irish moss I add 1/4 tsp in the last 15 minutes.  Does all this sound right?  If not, which step should I change?  Also, when would I add the oats?  Would that go in with my grains, then removed after the 20 minutes, or should I add that later and siphon out? "
2344,What is the intended IBU of Caribou Slobber?,"What is the intent of the Northern Brewer Caribou Slobber recipe as far as IBU is concerned?  1.) I have asked at the store and the answer I got was 34. 2.) I have searched the Internet and answers range from 26 - 40+.   With an OG of 1.052 - at 26 IBU the BU:GU is about .5; at 34 IBU it's .65;  Their recipe sheet does not adequately communicate this information.  Suppose an OG of 1.052, would it be too malty at 26 IBU and too bitter at 34 IBU?    For an American Brown both are within style range.  What has been your experience with various IBU levels and this recipe? "
2345,What is the right amount of priming sugar for a bottle with expandable head space?,"When bottling in plastic (PET) bottles, it is possible to eliminate oxygen from the bottle by squeezing the bottle.  Below is a 3 liter bottle with only one liter of beer in it:   I have done this before, but the ratio of beer was always above 8 parts beer to 1 part headspace, so it was not worth trying to figure out the precise formula to get carbonation perfect.  But since in this case it's 1 part beer to 2 parts headspace, I wonder what would be the correct amount of priming sugar.  If I desire 2.5 volumes of CO2 in the beer, the beer is at 72 degrees F, the 1 liter of beer is in a 3 liter bottle with all the headspace squeezed out, how much corn sugar should be added in this example?  What would be the formula to calculate priming sugar, given a defined expandable (to a point) headspace? "
2346,Pomegranate wine colour?,"The pictures of pomegranate wine I have seen on the internet seem like very dark red wine. The one I made however looked like a milkish pink. What can account for the difference? How can I control the colour, get rid of the milky look and darken the wine?  update Below is a pic of before and after fermentation. I think I can manage removing the milky aspect of the wine by using pectin enzyme. Running tests now. However there’s still a significant loss of color. I’d like a nice ruby red and not a twilight pink.   "
2347,What are the downsides of using bentonite for producing beer?,"Some brewers use Bentonite clay as a way to clarify their product, after the fermentation is done. It seems that proteins do not pass through, making for a cleaner beverage.  I wonder if this also has other effects on the final product, and if it does affect it, how: nose? aspect? foam? head retention? does it change anything with the use of hops during dry hoping?  Also, given the fact that proteins do not pass, what's the effect on yeast? Do they pass, what happens for refermentation? Do we need to force-carbonate once filtered or do yeast pass trough and adding sugar will work? "
2348,Post-fermentation Belgian Pale Ale,"I'm brewing a Belgian Pale Ale on Monday (12). It's my first time and using BeerSmith has been of great help. These last few days have filled me with a whole lot of doubts though. After fermantation is done (2-3 days with the same FG value) I'm gonna drop temperature down to 10 °C for maturation. On Beersmith it says under Carbonation and Storage tab that keg/bottling temperature is 21,1 °C, carbonation used is about 175 g DME, aging time is 30 days and storage temperature is 18,3 °C. Is 30 days the time I should leave the beer in the fermentation bucket maturing at 10 °C or the time i should leave the bottled beer resting? If the latter, how long should I leave beer for during maturation? "
2349,White sediment inside my airlock,"I tried to find something about this topic; no luck. So here's my question.   Beside the fact that my beer went crasy and took control of my airlock liquid ahah, could you tell me what is that white sediment on the bottom? Is it yeast or sugar, or something else? Is it normal? I'm not actually worried about the beer itself, but I just want to know.    Thank you  JF "
2350,Can I fix a higher than anticipated OG after primary?,"I just brewed a witbier that was way below the estimated preboil gravity of 1.49. I only got 1.34 in case you're wondering.  I've never had that bad of an efficiency before.  The grains came prepackaged and my guess it that either the total weight of the grain was light and/or some of it wasn't crushed properly.  Or, for whatever reason my brewhouse or my brain decided to take a break that day.  RHAHB.  To get it back up to the expected preboil gravity I added DME to get it to 1.49, or so says my hydrometer after my temp adjustment.  I must have done something wrong in my calcs, because my OG ended being 1.66 instead of 1.56.  That, combined with my yeast starter is going to prove a very boozy witbier.  More than I want, actually.  I've already pitched and want to see through the fermentation process without topping off, partly because I want to see if I can notice the difference (isn't that what homebrewing is all about?) and partly because I don't want to mess with the primary since my blowoff tube looks like I've just brewed a DIPA.  If I find it too boozy am I able to top-off after the primary?  I can always add water in the secondary or the keg before I force carbonate.  Physically adding water to reduce the PPG in not an issue, but I'm not sure if there are any ramifications to the beer itself. "
2351,How does tannin level and acidity affect cider taste/style?,"As per the title really... if you had tannin level on one axis of a graph and pH on another, how would the cider vary across this 'spectrum'? More acidic I can imagine will taste... more acidic ;) But I'm wondering how a low/none amount of tannin would taste, or a very non-acidic must. Would you get something sweet, or just bland and insipid? "
2352,Increase gravity in secondary,I added a pot of coffee to my secondary without thinking much about the water content. Now the SG is lower than I want (weak body). Could I put it back into the kettle and boil the excess water off without destroying it?  Any other options? 
2353,Idea for cooling fermentation with copper pipe,"I had an idea for cycling chilled water through something like a small copper wort chiller during fermentation to keep the temperature down. I have no problem setting up the peltier, pump, and thermostat - but I'm uncertain if it's ok to leave the copper in the fermenter with the beer the whole fermentation, or what tubing to use. Thinking about using some soft copper tubing like this: refrigerator copper tubing off ebay  Would using copper tubing like this in the fermentation be likely to affect the beer? Here is a rough sketch of what I'm thinking of trying:    "
2354,Why do I need a temperature controller if I have a freezer/refrigerator?,"I have a chest freezer with a thermostat dial on the outside of the unit, so why do I need another temperature controller? What's wrong with taping and insulating a wired digital thermometer to the carboy and adjusting the temperature with the freezer thermostat based on the digital thermometer? I can't find any posts that address this. All I keep reading is that you need an external controller "
2355,Milkiness after adding clearing agent (finnings),"I have added the clearing agent to my brew...on the 22nd of December. But, just pulled a sample to check numbers before bottling...and its still a little milky.    Is this normal?   Will it clear up the longer it stands?   Does it become clearer  after bottling and carbonation?   Is this a problem?   The numbers on the hydrometer haven't dropped to 1000 as per the instructions.  But, I was told by a homebrew shop owner that it doesn't matter as long as you get 3 readings the same?   It is a Brigalow homebrew kit. I don't know what the finnings are called, they just what came with the kit.  "
2356,Fermenting temperature in Queensland Australia,Being my very first brew...and from a kit. I worked on just room temperature.....Im in Queensland Australia. So between 24 and 28 degrees Celsius. Which I found out is too high? Kit never stated anything about specific temp. Probably shouldve done some research! How would this affect my beer? Should I then let my beer mature in the bottles at the same temperature range or in the fridge? 
2357,Closed System vs. Siphon,"In my short career in the home brew world I've always transferred the beer from the primary to bottle without a siphon (directly from the spigot). I've started to see that this made my beer darker and with unwanted components(oxidation). So I'm deciding now between an auto siphon or a CO2 cylinder and etc for a closed system. In that sense how the two compare to each other in terms of oxidation prevention? If possible a comparison in terms of percentage would be great, like a closed system offers 0% and an autosiphon 30% prevention (something like this). Does the expenditure on the cylinder and the needed gadgets really worth the investment? Tks! "
2358,Best time to transport wort in a car,"I'm planning on brewing my first batch of beer soon, but I will have to do the cooking part at my parents house, which is an hour drive away, and then ferment the beer at my apartment. At what stage in the process should I transport the wort? Before or after pitching yeast? And how long after I cool down the wort can I still pitch the yeast? I've read that the wort should be aerated before pitching yeast anyways, which is going to happen in some effect from splashing when transporting. That's why I feel that it would be best to transport it before adding yeast, any thoughts?  I'm quite flexible about the brewing and transporting times, eg. I can brew it and then transport it right after, but would prefer to brew in the morning and transport in the evening. "
2359,Fermentation krausen,Five days in and no krausen!! The airlock is bubbling like crazy but no krausen has formed after five days. For the first two days there was a thick foamy raft floating over my noob concoction but on the third day it subsided and now only smatterings of what I assume to be yeasty debris of some sort remains. Is this normal? Am I making the classic rookie mistake of worrying unnecessarily? Should I pitch more yeast? I did brew from an extract kit and read in a couple places that sometimes the yeast in kits is old. Any guidance is welcome.  
2360,Adding yeast for bottle carbonation,"I have made 3 batches of cider (two 3-gallon and one 5-gallon) this year and now it is clear and ready. It was racked twice, so now it has no sediment (and possibly no yeast). I was at first planning to force carbonate it in a keg, but honestly, I prefer bottle carbonated ciders.  I am planning to use either DV-10 or EC-1118 (both are champagne yeasts and both good for cider). I am planning to add yeast to a bucket, transfer cider to that bucket, slowly stirring. I also plan to use 1/2 lbs of corn sugar as a primer for 1 batch, and carbonation drops for the second batch. I'll be using champagne and Belgian bottles with corks and cages.  What would be the best way to prepare yeast?  Should I make a starter with a juice or should I hydrate the yeast with GoFerm?  How much should I use, like 5 grams for 3 gallons, 8 grams for 5 gallons?  "
2361,How much wort should be left in the brew pot?,"I just did a 3 Gallon boil with about 100g of hops.  It felt like I left a lot of wort in the brew pot when transferring to the fermenter. It was a struggle to keep the flow in the siphon due to all of the hops at the bottom of the pot.  The gravity reading was a lot below target in the fermenter.  How much of the wort should I be aiming to leave in the brew pot?  What are the best strategies for getting the most wort through the siphon?  EDIT: this was a partial mash brew (2kg malt, 500g oatmeal), with 2kg of LME added for the start of the boil. It was my first partial mash brew, so I need to figure out getting the right gravity from that, but I could see I was leaving a lot of good wort behind in the brew pot and that didn't feel right. I will transfer all the wort to the fermenter next time, and see how the gravity compares to the target. Thanks for all of the advice. "
2362,Making Mulberry Cider,Has a mulberry cider been made? I have a mulberry tree that has so much fruit every year and was wondering how I would go about trying that? I've only just bottled my very first batch of beer....so very new to this! 
2363,Does bottle refermentation help have a better beer conservation?,Can additional sugar help yeast consume the Oxygen present in the bottle?  What about isobar systems with counter-pressure?  What happens to the oxygen in the bottles? Does it have an impact on beer conservation (stability)? 
2364,Reduce acidity of hard cider,"I've brewed some cider from cooking apple juice. The apples were unusually sweet for cookers so there was enough sugar and I added teabags to add tannin. This gave me cider at ~6.3% which tastes OK except it is very tart, like someone poured lemon juice into it.  I gather this may reduce slightly as the cider matures but I doubt it will enough.  What is commonly added to this type of drink to make it less acidic? Wine-makers tend to deal with acidity so are there tricks I can borrow from those guys? Maybe there are typical household ingredients even? "
2365,Drops vs. sugar,"I used carbonation drops in the bottles on my first batch and worked well. On the next batch, I measured dry sugar into each bottle. Lot of foaming. I haven't tasted it yet. What can I expect? Also, how do I mix sugar into the whole batch without stirring up the sediment on the bottom? "
2366,Will a wooden barrel with alcohol survive in soil for quarter century?,"I'm planning to revive in my family one of regional traditions of Poland. It goes like this:   Serve wine from a wooden (usually oaken) barrel during baptism party of your child. After the party, fill it with vodka and bury it in soil. Dig it out when the child is getting married and serve vodka from it during the wedding party.   I didn't find any tips in the web and I've never talked to somebody that has tried this. I have some concerns regarding survival of the barrel for probably more than 20 years. Is it safe to assume that the barrel won't be damaged during such time by bacteria, worms, humidity or other factors? If not, how can I minimize the risk? Would it help to use stronger alcohol, specific wood, impregnation or other means to preserve the valuable fluid from being wasted? "
2367,Does bottle priming temp matter after 4 days?,"It is my understanding that during priming the yeast creates the necessary C02 for carbonation in the first 3 to 4 days and the C02 is then absorbed into the beer over the next 10 to 15 days.  If this is true, then does bottle temp matter that much after day 4?  I currently ferment/prime in my living room, and then move my beer into the basement.  Do you foresee any issues if I move the beer after half a week?  Basement temp ranges from 50-75 degrees this time of year. "
2368,Wooden barrel treatment,"A friend gave me a 20l (5 gal) wooden barrel.  It had bourbon before, and was emptied two or three days ago.  My friend said the barrel needs to be prevented from drying so that the wood doesn't contract and the barrel becomes leaky.   I don't have anything to put in the barrel, and I cannot brew till in 2 weeks.  My friend recommended putting it in shrink wrap, but that'd look ugly. (The barrel looks nice as is and I'd like to keep it in the living area.)  Guess I shouldn't fill it with water cause if I let water sit in the barrel it will soak out the flavors, which I'd dump with the water.  Can I just let it dry out and rehydrate before use? If yes, how long before use should I put water in? 24h? 48h? "
2369,Salt additions to the glass,"So here's my predicament: I've realized that my city water has low Chloride levels compared to the sulfates (i.e. the sulfate/chloride ratio is higher than ideal). Reading that this might be the case, I measured out the approx. amount of CaCl2 to be added to one of my already bottled beers. I poured the beer into a glass and added the salt. Waited for the salt to dissolve, and tasted the beer. This resulted in a much smoother, fuller body beer with less bitter-dry assertiveness in the finish. (beer types: Hefeweizen and Weizenbock)  I have several batches of beer that are already bottled that could use some CaCl2. The CaCl2 from my local homebrew store appears to be anhydrous, so I can't simply measure out the appropriate amount of salt per bottle and add this as needed to each glass because the salt starts pulling water from the air and making a mess of things.  This brings me to my question: Can I simply measure out the several separate amounts of the required CaCl2 additions per bottle and mix these with very small amounts of filtered water and store these in some small vials? This would allow me to some homebrew to some friends with a small vial of liquid salt addition to be added to the glass.  Would this work, or am I changing the CaCl2 by adding water? (I'm no chemist) Thanks in advance. "
2370,Did my mead stall? What can I do?,"Edits are in bold italics  This is my first mead and I know I've made more than a few mistakes up to this point in the process, but I'm hoping for a Mead Doctor to roll in and tell me what I can do from here. I brewed a 5gal batch that seemed to be going well and had lots of bubbling in the blow off bucket for 2-4 days at the beginning, but I'm currently into day 32 of primary fermentation and instead of hitting around 1.000-1.010 I seem to have stalled out much higher at 1.063.   Here's the pertinent info:    Brew:   Nov. 11, 2018 Batch size: 5 gal 15lbs local raw honey Lalvin D47: Two dry packs (10g) OG 1.100; Taken with floating hydrometer Storage temp range due to home HVAC: 62-70F; 07:00-23:00 @70F, 23:00-07:00 @62F Aerated prior to pitch with pure 02 and oxygen wand w/ 0.2 micron stone Fermenter: 5gal glass carboy w/ blow-off hose into bucket o' sanitizer     Nutrient additions:   Each mixed with ~40ml distilled water to facilitate pouring. Day 2: 1/2 tsp(~2g) Fermaid K; Oxygenate with pure O2 &amp; stone Day 3: 1/4 tsp(~1g) Fermaid K; Oxygenate with pure O2 &amp; stone Day 4: 1/4 tsp(~1g) Fermaid K; no stirring or O2 Day 5: 1/4 tsp(~1g) Fermaid K; no stirring or O2 Day 31: 1/4 tsp(~1g) Fermaid K; stirred to degas, no O2     SG readings:   OG 1.100; Taken with floating hydrometer, temp not recorded :( (likely 69F) All other readings taken with calibrated refractometer, temp @69F. Day 29 SG: 1.063 - refractometer Day 31 SG: 1.062 - refractometer Day 33 SG: 1.059 - refractometer and 1.030 - hydrometer Day 38 SG: 1.057 - refractometer and 1.024 - hydrometer     Quick note about storage temp: I know 70F is at the top end of D47. It's winter here in the South, so it's getting cold(er). We keep the house at 70F most of the day, except at night where we let the temp drop to 62F before the heat kicks back on. My storage is in the center of the house, so it is always within one degree F of what the thermostat says; I check it often with a temp gun. Exceptions being if we have a hot day; thermostat is on HEAT right now so temps above the setting are ignored. I don't remember any exceptionally warm days in the last month, but maybe one or two. Based on my research I don't think the problem is temp; it's the South so a cold snap is unlikely and supposedly the worst that could happen with temp being too high is getting extra fusels from the yeast.  What you have above are basically my notes, so there's little bits of info about how it was measured or whatever just in case it proves important. In case you were wondering, no I didn't add Go-Ferm and I was an idiot and didn't bother to re-hydrate my D47 before pitching it either; I just opened two dry packs and chucked them in. I know...shame upon me, my cow, my family.  I'm sure you've noticed that I've only added Fermaid-K up to this point; it's all I have. You may also be wondering about the amount of Fermaid-K I've added up to this point; I AM TOO. I've looked and looked and I keep finding conflicting info on how much to add, and it's not like within a 25% difference. Some say to add what I have added, and some say to add double or triple that amount. I've also seen others say that if you add too much you may get an odd flavor(it's the Fermaid) or you may end up feeding competing organisms and make life hell for you and your yeast.  So on Dec 17, I took a reading and got 1.063. This is when I became concerned something may be wrong. I started reading up, trying to find out if I've stalled or what. I've seen the other posts on here, one of which was really close to mine, but didn't get a clear answer on what my additions should have been nor on what they should be NOW to try and restart it.  I took a reading last night(Day 31) and got what I think was 1.062. You all know it can be difficult to read those tiny refractometer lines sometimes, so it could have also been willful delusion and it's just sitting at 1.063. After reading more online, I decided to try one of the suggestions and do another Fermaid-K addition to kick things off again. I added 1/4tsp(~1g) of Fermaid-K with ~30ml distilled water and gave it a good stir to degas, mix in the addition and get the yeast floating around again. No O2 was (intentionally) added.  Update 12/21:  Thanks to chthon, I took a new sample of the mead today and found that my refractometer was much more pessimistic than my hydrometer. Refractometer reading shows us at 1.059, which is good that's it's still dropping, but completely off-base because the hydrometer is showing us at 1.030. This is MUCH better than we thought, but still far above my target of 1.000-1.010 for this mead, and let me tell you, it is SWEET. I'm in cheap sugar wine territory at this point. So my questions below still stand. Also, the mead is still bubbling through the blow-off tube, though maybe once every 1.5-2.0 seconds.  Update 12/26:  Merry Christmas! SG seems to still be dropping, hooray! So either I panicked a little early, or the nutrient add on the Day 31 helped out. Either way, things are still rolling so I'll check it again next week to see if we get closer to our target. And lastly, can someone answer my questions around nutrient additions? Thanks again!  ===========  Mead Doctors: mistakes were made and I want to learn from those, but what do I do about this right now? How do I kick this off again so I can hit my target of 1.000-1.010? Should I add more nutrients? Is she dead?  Second question: what is the correct addition of Fermaid-K to a basic mead like this? I've gone with ~1g/1gal, but I've seen as high as 4g/1gal mentioned on this site. Maybe I've misunderstood total additions vs amount per add with four scheduled adds? I don't know. Help?  Last request: lay it on me. Let your wisdom flow forth and sear the shame of incomplete steps and shortcuts into my memory forever so that I may never fall prey to the temptation of laziness, nor the unfounded confidence of ignorance ever again.  You guys are great, thanks for any input you can provide. "
2371,"Is a Homebrew cider with a ""Frito"" aftertaste safe to drink?","Is it safe to drink a hard cider with a corn chip type aftertaste, my buddy made it and gave me some. When you take a sip it tastes great but then you taste a weird ""Frito"" taste like a corn chip. It's not unbearable but is it safe? He also dissolved cinnamon hearts into it which he says backsweetened it. Could hfcs in the cinnamon hearts have something to do with the taste?  I just want to know if I will get sick "
2372,Help me debug my Christmas Ale band-aid flavor,"Recently I brewed two batches of a copycat Christmas Ale. You can ignore the recipe's water adjustments, since I didn't do them.  Before fermenting, the wort smelled and tasted perfect - just the right amount of sugar and spice. I figured that it would turn out fantastic (both batches).  The first batch sat in the bottle for 2 weeks, and when I tasted I was quite disappointed. It had essentially no spice characteristic in smell or taste, and it had a slight band-aid smell, but much more noticeable in the taste. Still drinkable, but not as pleasant as one would hope. The second batch just finished primary fermentation and has a similar taste, but much less of the smell. Slightly band-aid-y flavor in the aftertaste.  Here are my ideas for what went wrong:  Batch 1:   completely forgot to sanitize the carboy (even though I did sanitize everything else) - I was drinking, and cooking for 8 people while I was making this beer. Not my best idea, so I'm guessing bacterial infection pitched too much yeast; used about 5.5g for a 4L batch; the recommendation for Safale S-04 is 11.5g for 20-30L (so I may have overpitched by about 2-3x fermented at too high of a temperature (my apartment was roughly 22C/72F, but with the fermentation heat it probably was right at the 25C/77F yeast threshold) chlorine in the water did not have time to dissipate (I did not adjust water chemistry, and did not leave the water overnight to let the chlorine evaporate)   Overall, batch 1 was a complete disaster on all fronts, so I'm not surprised it turned out the way it did. However, I tried to improve things for batch 2.  Batch 2:   fermented for about 12 hours at 22C/72F before I read up on too high of temperature potentially producing phenol alcohol; I immediately chilled my apartment down to a safer 18C/65F, right in the middle of the yeast's temperature range factoring in heat from fermentation pitched approximately 5.5g for an 8L batch (so a little closer to the guideline of 11.5g per 20L-30L), but still may have overpitched   I sanitized everything properly in batch 2, so I don't think it was bacterial infection.    For both batches, it could have been chlorine in the water, the fermentation temperature being too high (in batch 2 for 12 hours), that I overpitched the yeast, or that maybe even the spices didn't ferment well or that they were boiled at inappropriate times. I  just can't be sure. Last summer I made a beer with cinnamon and ginger with no issues, but I've added clove and nutmeg to this one - so maybe it could be that they give off some nasty compounds when boiled or fermented? Maybe it's just Safale S-04 that gives off this medicinal characteristic (as is desirable in some English ales, apparently), and over-pitching led to it being much more noticeable.  Do you guys have any ideas as to what went wrong? I am tempted to rule out bacteria simply because I made sure to properly sanitize everything in batch 2.  "
2373,Pressurized Ferment Yeast Harvest -- what are these layers?,"I'm poured the keg remnants from a pressurized ferment into a beaker to let it settle out but I'm puzzled by the layers I'm seeing.  From a typical non-pressure ferment, you see (from the bottom up), trub/hops, yeast and then beer/amber liquid--like you see here:       But here's what I'm seeing:    I assume the foam was the result of releasing the last bit of pressure that had built up (probably a few psi) which foamed up the contents.  The foam looks pretty yeasty but the yeast is usually not on top.  It's not quite visible in the picture but it does look like there is a shallow layer settling out/building up at the base of the bottom layer.  Should I assume the bottom layer will ultimately end up as a layer of trub/hops, and the yeast, and ignore that yeasty looking top layer?    Is what I'm seeing typical for a pressurized ferment?   Thanks!  p.s. Video clip of the bioactivty: Yeast Harvest Bioactivity "
2374,Ginger bug causing a gelatinous soda,"I have been making ginger soda. But after fermenting, the soda was very viscous and slimy in some of the batches. It usually turns out fine but this happened multiple times inconsistently with different starts. Does anybody know what may be causing this?  Recipe used: Ginger Bug (ginger, sugar, and water) Strong ginger tea dilute with water and add sugar to 6-7 brix sweetness  i usually ferment until ~5 brix before putting in the fridge.  so really the only things in this are ginger, sugar and water, plus whatever bugs might be on the ginger skin.  the first time i thought it might be a contamination so i made a new ginger bug start. i've also moved since then with another new start. but unless i'm contaminating it in the same way every time in different environments, i don't know how i'm getting the same gelatinous consistency, so i think it might be specific to the bug?  i do make sourdough as well, but not usually at the same time, and i don't have any other ferments in the house. "
2375,Will reused yeast change beer taste?,"I noticed that some breweries and home brewers reuse yeast for next batch.  But from what I read about yeast mutation and generations that every new cell generation is bit different and can affect beer taste, so how home brewers and breweries reuse yeast and get consistent result?  Also how about yeast starters? as whenever you grow cell count you producing new cells so new cells must be altered as they mutated? "
2376,Best Carbonation amount of sugar,"I am korean homebrewer. I brewed Citra Pale Ale, but I am not quite satisfied. After fermentation, I added 3g or 6g of priming sugar in 500ml bottles. The 3g of sugar bottles had good flavor but less carbonation. The 6g of sugar bottles had less flavor and were a little bit sweet, and they had more carbonation than the 3g but it is still not enough.   How do you carbonate(How long)? How much do you priming the sugar? Is it better use refined Dextrose?  "
2377,Life expectancy of swing-top bottles,"I started brewing less than a year ago. In that time I've acquired about 60 swing top bottles, and filled about 200, I estimate I've filled each bottle less than 5 times. The last batches I made were a biere de Garde, an ESB and a Xmas ale. Unfortunately the carbonation of the biere de Garde was totally lacking, essentially on a par with the bitter, which I put down to some kind of mistake (not enough sugar, not enough time at room temp) until I started cracking open the crown cap bottles. One of them was a gusher and the others had big foamy euro style heads. I now believe the swing tops are to blame and were not holding pressure.   My question therefore is:  How long should swing tops be viable for?  And also: Is there anything I can do to improve their performance short of replacing all the seals? Is there anything I've done that could be to blame for them having deteriorated? I usually just rinse bottles immediately after use then fill with milton/VWP for 15 mins and rinse immediately before filling, and leave the tops in a bowl of the same. "
2378,How to calculate ABV when adding fermentable sugar or fruit to secondary fermentation?,"Fermentable Sugar, e.g. Maple Syrup I brewed a Maple Stout before Christmas in which I racked the beer to a secondary fermentation vessel where I added 550g of Maple Syrup. I let it sit at 12ºC for 4 days before racking to keg. The schedule was as so:  Day 0,  O.G. = 1.067 Day 10, S.G. = 1.015, transfer to secondary, S.G. = ? Day 14, F.G. = 1.017, transfer to keg   I didn't think to take a gravity reading after mixing the beer with the Maple Stout (doh), but even if I did, is that how the ABV would be calculated? Adding the 6.83% of 1.067-1.015 and X% of 1.0xx-1.017. E.g. 1.020-1.017 is 0.39% so 6.83% + 0.39% = 7.22%?  As Christmas was around the corner I just labelled it up as 7.2% and let it be, but for future brews I want to be able to know the exact ABV.  Fruit Any sort of sugar or syrup would be the same as whatever method is described for above, but fruit I imagine would be more difficult.  How would one make the calculations if adding fruit? For example, using the same gravity readings above for Day 0 and Day 10 of 1.067 to 1.015, how would you work out the ABV if adding 500g of Mango and 500g Apricot into the secondary fermentation? Or any other fruit for that matter. How do the breweries do it? "
2379,Why do my spice flavors disappear when my beer is chilled?,"I recently brewed a second batch of Christmas ale, which was spiced with cinnamon, ginger, clove and nutmeg. I put a bottle in the fridge last night and tried it, but only a small amount of spice came through in smell/taste. Then I decided to open a bottle that hadn't been chilled, and the spice character was much more present, especially the cinnamon and clove.  Why does chilling reduce the perceptibility of the spice? It is something chemically related to the beer, or just natural human perception? In any case, it was still enjoyable at room temperature. "
2380,How long can I let an IPA fermented while dry hopping?,The hydrometer reading is 1.014 from 1.058.  I just dry hopped.  How long should I let it ferment?  Can I let alone for one more week without messing it up? 
2381,How long should I wait for priming solution to mix when added to a keg?,"Background  After my beer reached FG I transferred it into a corny keg, cold crashed in my keezer at 42°F, and fined with gelatin.  48 hours after adding the gelatin I pulled about a pint of sludge until the beer was looking clear.  I'd like to add priming solution to the beer and bottle straight from my corny keg in a few days.  Questions   If I pour my priming solution into the top of the keg, will it mix effectively so that I'm not left with varying amounts of carbonation in each bottle (or perhaps even bottle bombs)? How long should I allow the keg to sit to ensure the priming solution has mixed completely? I'll be keeping the keg at 42°F prior to bottling, which I assume means the yeast (Wyeast Irish Ale - 1084) will be dormant and won't start working on the priming sugar until I've bottled the beer and warmed it up.  Is that a safe assumption?   Notes   Each time the keg has been opened it has been sealed and purged with 15PSI and then taken off gas.  I assume this has added a negligible amount of CO2 that can be ignored for priming calculations.   UPDATE (3 weeks later)  Carbonation levels appear to be consistent on bottles filled at both the beginning and end of the keg.  Only 1 of ~10 random bottles sampled seemed different (slightly over-carbed).  I did exactly as @jsolarski recommended and gently poured the priming solution into the keg, sealed and purged, gave it a gentle shake/roll, and bottled after a few minutes.  In the future I will do multiple gentle rolls and wait at least 15 minutes to ensure thorough mixing. "

2383,Homemade condensing pipe for kettle,"For various reasons (climate being one) I'm trying to bring my brewing indoors and I cannot simply vent the steam out. A condensing pipe could allow me to remove the vast amount of steam and thus close the garage door. I am also looking to upgrade to a bigger kit so understanding how these work will help me pick the best equipment for my needs.  The following link explains a little bit but it doesn't detail the explanation: [website]What is the principle behind a condensing pipe?  Must a certain temperature and flow rate of water be achieved in order to successfully condense the steam?  I have seen some breweries with a condensing pipe not from the highest point above the kettle, but almost from the side. Is there a reason for this?   This link shows a slightly different application with the water fired from above the steam rather than trying to create negative pressure to suck the steam through: [website]"
2384,Estimating residual sugars in a beer recipe,"I'm finally taking a stab at formulating my own beer recipe.  What I'd like to achieve is something dark and chewy, but not overly sweet.  I've been playing around with the recipe tools on brewersfriend, estimating OG / FG / ABV / IBU / SRM from a recipe.  Are there similar tools for estimating perceived post-fermentation sweetness from a recipe?  For that matter, does a ""sweetness"" measurement scale exist?  Or am I overthinking this - and what I'm after is just FG?  Thanks for any pointers (and recipe formulation strategies are most welcome!) "

2387,After I eat some foods beer tastes weird?,"I'm an obsessive home brewer.  So I'm always trying to critically evaluate the flavour of beers I make with a view to constantly improving their quality. In particular I am searching for off-flavours, like by-products of fermentation, or is some-ingredient too prominent in the flavour profile.  However I find that if I eat certain foods (like flavoured chips/crisps), before drinking beer, some parts of the malt taste profile (or the yeast?) flavours go weird, the sweetness becoming kind of saccharine (maybe).   Some foods do not prompt this at all, e.g.: unflavoured corn chips/crisps, salted peanuts.  Is this a know phenomenon?  Is there a way to ""reset"" one's palette?  But this is really a question about food &amp; flavours.  I'd like to prepare meals (and snacks) that don't make beer taste weird.  (Note: cross-posted to ""Seasoned Advice"") "

2390,Staggered 2 primary fermentations. Then fermentation started in the Demi again. Is the wine ok?,"So i decided to try grape wine last year since my friend had a backyard full of grapes that were going to go to waste. My process ended up a little complicated and now I wonder if it’s still ok.  I harvested as many grapes as I could around the end of September. I took as many as I thought I’d need to fill a 25L Demi, crushed and started fermenting a must and froze the rest of the grapes. I didn’t add any sugar, and also managed to completely forget to take a hydrometer reading.   The must started up within a day and was pushing the skins to the top for about 4-5 days (stirring the skins back in 2-3 times a day) then over the next 2-3 days it slowed and seemed more of less done so I filtered it into a Demi. It ended up to be only about 20 L so I knew I had to get it topped up. Likely with what I had frozen.  Before I got to making another small must I had to move. And whether it was the time it took to get settled in my new home or procrastination the 20L of wine sat in the Demi for about 2 months... By the time I got around to dealing with it I found it had a little patches of a white layer on top. I read it was typical with the space I had left, but it was salvageable. So I racked it to another Demi from the middle, below the top white layer and dosed it with campdon.   At the same time I had started a must with the grapes I had frozen. That fermented just as the last for about a week. Again I forget to measure hah. I pressed it and added it to the batch I recently racked. From racking I had lost a few L so I ended up still short..about 1.5L to be nice and full... I was out of grapes, a so I ended up adding some fresh, additive free grape juice, sealed it and moved on.  I put it in my cold cellar and within maybe 3 days or so it was bubbling fairly significantly. It’s been about 2 weeks now and it’s still got a slow but steady bubbles rising. Could it still be fermenting off the grape juice sugar I added? Or maybe it was stuck, or has some bacteria taken over or what..? Is it ruined? Or can I just dose it with campdon? I sort of didn’t want to   Any insight would be appreciated. Thanks 🙏  "
2391,Do I have to use Campden tablets every time I expose my wine to external factors?,"So, I'm pretty concerned about infections, seeing as my very first try ended in sauerkraut-smelling disappointment. I've got a gallon of quite sweet kiwi wine at about 16.5% ABV. The fermentation is now stopped by cold crashing followed by dose of Campden and potassium sorbate. However, the wine refuses to clear, so I was hoping to help it with some fining agents.  Normally I assumed that I should add Campden tablets anytime I open the carboy to prevent infections. However, that means I've added quite a lot already (I think 3-4 tablets for this one gallon over its lifetime) so would like to avoid adding more. Is it ok if I introduce the fining agents without a prophylactic Campden tablet? What about when bottling? Do I have to Campden my wine again to avoid accidental infection? "
2392,DIY 110 volt eBIAB sytem possible?,"I've been doing some research into pre-built electric all-in-one brewing systems (Robobrew, Grainfather, etc) vs DIY electric systems. The prevailing sentiment is that a DIY 110v 1500 watt system is not enough to achieve a full rolling boil, however the descriptions for the Robobrew and Grainfather systems are claiming that a full rolling boil can be achieved with this wattage. I've seen many reviews backing this up as well.  What are the fundamental differences between a pre-built system and what DIYers are doing?

2393,Measuring alcohol when using ginger bug,"I have recently started to get my feet wet by making some ginger beers using a ginger bug to start the fermentation.  I would like to know the alcohol content of my final product, but as the ginger bug has both bacteria and yeast eating the sugars I can not figure out how I would measure the final alcohol content!  3 questions:   Is there a way to figure out how much sugar has been consumed by either the yeast or bacteria, so I can then just use a hydrometer as suggested most places I search? Can I measure the alcohol content by some other indicator besides sugar content? What other tools might be used besides a refractometer or a hydrometer?  "
2394,Is it necessary to pasteurize frozen juice concentrate used for brewing?,"For my ciders, I've always either pasteurized the juice when I've started with fruit, or else used pasteurized bottled juice.  It seems to me that frozen concentrate should be a quick &amp; dirty (well, hopefully not too dirty) method for incorporating different fruit juices without the hassle and expense of juicing fresh fruit.  Fresh fruit can be expensive around here!  So in regards to sanitation:   Is it safe to use frozen (no-preservatives-added) juice concentrate for the primary, without pasteurizing it? Should I worry about boiling or pre-boiling the water used to reconstitute the concentrate? How about commercially available frozen fruit?  I've heard of brewers racking beer or cider onto frozen fruit in secondary with good results, and others who were concerned about sanitation.   Thanks for any expertise or experience! "
2395,How to clean yeast,"I like reusing yeast to save money, and I like having my own ""house"" yeast.  However sooner or later my yeast eventually dies and becomes unusable.  I have a feeling that each time I repitch, I'm getting more an more crap and less and less yeast.  I once read something that either White Labs or Wyeast put out on how to properly clean yeast for reuse, but the page has since been down.  Does anybody have a good method of cleaning the yeast they plan on reusing?  Also, what temp do you normally store yeast waiting to be reused?  Currently I just pour most of the beer off the slurry then mix it all up and toss it into some bigger bottles.  When it comes time to pitch I dump off the old beer and dump in the old yeast. "
2396,"What class of beer is Newcastle, and what do I need to brew my own?","I like Newcastle, and now I would like to brew some.  What class / style of beer is Newcastle?  Where does it get its brown color?  Are there any kits out there that would give pretty close results? "
2397,What is cold crashing?,What is cold crashing? When is it done? How long does it take? Best temperature to make it happen? 
2398,Critical Steps to follow for any homebrew beer recipe or process,"I've got my second batch of homebrew fermenting, and in just two batches I've learned a lot the hard way (messed up batch priming, possibly under-aerated the wort, etc)  What steps are critical to any batch of homebrew regardless of recipe, equipment, or approach (extract, all-grain, etc)?    I found a good partial answer in another question: Shaking vs not shaking     EDIT: As far as a best practice, I would SAPS it :D (FYI, I made that acronym up...)      Starter - Create a starter to get the   cell count high enough -   [website]     Aerate - Before pitching, use one of   the many available methods to aerate   the wort -   [website]     Pitch - When the starter is ready and   the wort is aerated, put the yeast   into the wort in the primary vessel -   [website]     Suffocate - Do anything possible not   to introduce oxygen after this point -   [website]     It is not recommended to perturb the   beer between when fermentation starts   and kegging/bottling because you run a   strong risk of coming into too much   contact with oxygen. Carefully racking   to secondary with minimal oxygen   exposure will leave you with plenty of   yeast for carbonation.      Please see Why do you aerate wort at   first and try to keep oxygen out   later? for why oxygen is not good for   wort/beer once fermentation has begun.  "
2399,Refractometer - what exactly can it measure?,"I am using a refractometer to determine gravities. I am aware of course that values measured need to be corrected depending on OG of the fermenting batch. What I don't know is, what kind of sugars am I measuring. Am I only measuring fermentable sugars or also non-fermentables, i.e. should the measured final gravity of a malty beer be higher than the one of a really dry beer? Or is the measured final gravity only dependent on the yeast/attenuation? "
2400,Nitrogen Widgets in canned beer,"How do those N2 widgets work in cans of beers like guineas, tetleys and Old Speckled Hen? Is the N2 in the widget and released when the can opens, or is the N2 in the beer and the widget helps mix and froth the whole thing? "
2401,Dry Irish Stout Tastes very much like grain,"I brewed my first Irish Stout on Oct 22. I used the Nitro-Powered Stout recipe that Brian Smith has on his BeerSmith website. The only changes I made to the recipe is I replaced the Ultra hops with Saaz as my LHBS didn't have any Ultra, and I opted not to include the Gypsum since I don't know the composition of my tap water. The recipe calls for 6 lb of Dark DME and 1 lb of roasted barley.  I steeped the barley for 30 minutes at 156 degrees F, then added the dME and boiled for 45 minutes. Everything went fine, the wort seemed like it would give me a fantastic Stout. Once through the primary for 7 days, secondary for another 7, then bottled for several weeks, it has this very strong taste of what has to be the roasted barley. I feel like if I strained it through a tea towel, there would be a film of barley there. The only thing I did different with steeping the grains than I've done before was to use cheesecloth tied up instead of an official grain sock or nylon bag. There was no leakage and it stayed tied the whole time. Any ideas on what could cause this, or is this normal for a homebrew dry stout? (I may have answered my own question once I remembered I used cheesecloth as a grainbag, is it possible it's not as fine of a mesh and there actually is a haze of barley floating in this brew?) Thanks for your answers. "
2402,When to add fresh ginger?,"I am considering brewing an Amber ale with a bit of ginger in it, but I don't know whether I should treat it more like a spice and steep/boil it, or more like fruit, and rack onto the ginger for a week or two of secondary fermentation.    Should I use a combination of the two?   What has worked for you? "
2403,"Is 55% ABV ""beer"" actually beer?","BrewDog claims to have made a 55% ABV ""beer"" which they call The End of History. They have other high ABV ""beers:"" Tactical Nuclear Penguin is 32% ABV and Sink the Bismark! is 41% ABV.  From what I understand, each of these beers starts with a normal recipe for a high ABV (imperial) beer, but this can only get you so far. The high ABV is obtained by freezing the beer, scraping off the ice, and repeating. The result is a high alcohol content liquid.  Usually, I would call beer that has been processed in this way ""ice beer,"" but I'm not sure the label applies at this extreme.  My question: Is The End of History beer?  (Note: This should be considered separately from the question ""Is beer the end of history?"") "
2404,Ginger Beer recipe,"Reeds Ginger Beer is one of my favorite non-alcoholic fizzy-drinks... just curious if anyone has a recipe for brewing something similar.  Also, what's the brewing process like?  Similar to beer, or drastically different?  Would a regular homebrew kit (carboy, bottling setup, etc) suffice? "

2406,"What is fusel alcohol, and does it cause hangovers?","I'd recently heard of fusel alcohol in a reference that it causes headaches/hangovers.  First what is fusel alcohol, and what creates it (can I avoid it)?  Secondly, is fusel alcohol really the main culprit behind hangovers? I know I stopped making/drinking mead as it was a guaranteed hangover for me the next day. "
2407,Estimating the ABV in finshed product,"Is this a viable method?: In theory you can calculate an estimated ABV by using the formula 17*X%*YL. This means that 17 gr sugar produces 1% alc. in 1 liter mash. So if you know at what alc.% your yeast gives in and how many liters mash you make you can derive how much sugar you should add to reach there.  To know for sure when all sugar is consumed by the yeast, using a hydrometer and the formula that 2,7 gram sugar is 1° Oechsle in 1 liter mash, you would be able to know when all sugar is gone.   If you keep track of consumed sugar on the hydrometer scale, and when it finishes bubbling as predicted - would you be able to verify the ABV with a refractomer measuring plain % alcohol?? "
2408,Overflowing yeast starter,"I made a yeast starter last night with 1500 ml of water, 150 g DME and a Wyeast 1056 smack pack. After boiling, total volume was just under 1500 ml. I put it in a 2 liter erlenmeyer flask on a stir plate and covered the top with foil. By morning it went Mt. Vesuvius and had bubbled out the top all over my stir plate. I've definitely lost some yeast.  I've made several of these before and never had this happen. Is this unusual? What is a reasonable volume starter for a 2 liter flask? Should I chill, decant, and do another starter to make up for the lost yeast or just pitch it and see what happens? It's for an IPA with an OG of 1065, so I don't want to underpitch. "
2409,what have i made and is it safe to drink?,"I made a DIY CO2 system for my fish tank. I use fermentation for the CO2. 2 and a half weeks ago I filled a 2ltr soda bottle with water, 2 cups of demerara sugar and a tsp of bakers yeast. This wasnt intended for drinking (no sanitisation first etc) just for producing co2 as cheaply as possible.  I came to change my mixture today and rather than just throw away whatever it is i'd fermented I thought i'd try syphoning the mix into another 2ltr bottle (this is called racking, right?). Then, unable to resist, i poured a little into a glass and tasted expecting vinegar. Although its quite sharp to taste, its not vinegar by any means! it is still very fizzy and has a lasting sharp taste that tbh is not unpleasant. I could mix this with juice and drink it quite happily..  so as the subject says, WHAT have I made and if I choose to drink it all am I going to make myself sick? Now I have this mixture syphoned off into a bottle is there anything else I should do to improve it? "
2410,Cold crash with airlock or not,"While cold crashing is it right to use a lid with an airlock?Do we risk to get oxygen in the fermentor fron the airlock(and as a result to oxidize our beer) while co2 leaves free space as it ""goes"" in our beer and leaves free space? "
2411,No Activity or Krausen,"Something that has never happened to me.  Brewed early Sunday and hit 80+% efficiency.  I used Wyeast London Ale that was fully bloated when pitched.  Over 36 hours later zero activity.  No krausen, No air lock movement...nada.    It is a heavier beer (1.080) and I did not have time for a starter so it is possible that the yeast is working but not enough to show anything visable.  I am going to check the gravity when I get home, but in case nothing changed what is the best course of action?  Should I buy another Wyeast pack?  Dry yeast?  etc? "
2412,Optimum Fermentation Temperature,"I am planning on brewing a wheat beer with Danstar Munich Wheat Beer Dry Yeast. I didn't realize until I had already made the purchase that the optimum temperature for fermentation was 55-65. I don't currently have the equipment to maintain that temperature and was hoping to keep it around 70-73.   What ill effects, if any, will this have on the beer?  Should I just bite the bullet and buy a different yeast strain? "
2413,Creating a tincture extract question,"Good afternoon, guys.  I never done tincturing before, and actually just saw a recipe for Capsicumel (jalapeno mead or methodology). The recipe states adding 2 peppers into the primary when the ABV reaches 10%, and at the same time put 3 peppers in 175ml (6oz) of vodka... After 3-4 weeks use the created peppered vodka to adjust the taste of the mead to desired one. So, since I'm new to this method, my questions are:   After soaking peppers in vodka for 4-6 weeks, do I just add to the batch (obviously oz by oz) straight?  Can it be done with other ingredients like oak chips, spice (cinnamon, etc), berries (juniper, etc), herbs (wormwood, heather, etc), hops etc.  What can I use besides vodka? I'm thinking about bourbon or brandy for creating oak tincture...  Is there anything I should try to watch out?   Thank you very much in advance. "
2414,Fermentation issue - Airlock overflow,"I'm brewing my first batch ever, we did our best but something is going on in the fermentation and I'm not sure what it is.  Here is a 30 sec video of the issue: [website]Basically there is a lot of foam and the airlock is overflowed by it. Data: - The initial density of this batch was 1050, even though we tried to make it less, our initial malt/water ratio during the maceration phase was a bit off so the density was huge. - The yeast we used was a 11gr Golden Ale (0.3 oz) - The amount of wort is around 20lts (5.2 gallons)  We were worried a bit about the high density and the yeast being very little, but a brewer friend of mine told me it would just delay the fermentation because the yeast will have to multiply more before it starts fermenting. And it did, fermentation took close to 48hs to start.  Thanks for any input you might give :) hopefully we will save the batch. "
2415,Using caster sugar as a barrel primer. Bad idea?,"My first best of home brew fermented for 6 days, then transferred to barrel for the net 3 weeks - i used woodforde's real ale mix.  BUT at the last seconds i forgot primer so i improvised wit 80g of caster sugar for 23 litres of beer.  Does anyone have experience of using caster sugar as a primer in a barrel? And more importantly - have i just borked my first barrel?! "
2416,What are all the factors that contribute to short fermentation time?,"I've got an event coming up and I've got one beer that I'm going to bring, but I'm thinking about brewing another. If I do that, I need to turn it around in about two weeks. Which is probably too short, even with force carbonating. But it got me thinking about what goes into a short fermentation time, and I don't know much about how the different components contribute to time.  I think I would want to have a fairly low OG, like around 1.04. Probably a pilsner, but maybe a low alcohol wheat would be good. Do different types of grains have different effects beyond just the sugar they contribute? Do I want to avoid specialty grains? Does extract, partial, or all grain make a difference?  Then hops, maybe a session IPA is the way to go. I've heard that the reason you dry hop after the primary fermentation is done is because the hops can interfere with fermentation. If that's true, do I want to keep the hops low overall? Are hops equal in this respect, or is it specifically related to something that varies with the variety?  For the yeast I think I would want to have something that is heat tolerant and low esters, so I can raise the temperature a bit and encourage growth. Is there such a thing as too much of a starter? "
2417,All my beers taste heavy bodied,"Although it's few years I'm into homebrewing I made only few batches, about 6-7, trying different styles, like pale ales, sweet stouts and weiss. As now I always used extracts plus speciality grains and I've never done mashing.  I'm quite happy with the result but all the batches are quite heavy bodied. It's difficult for me to explain exactly what is it, but for sure I never made a refreshing, light bodied pale ale. Of course for some styles it's what I want, but not for others.  My question is, what I can to to improve this and be able to have a light bodied beer? It seems the the different OG of the different styles I tried don't give me the expected results. Is this a problem with the extract? Should I move to partial or all grain? "
2418,Why is IBU/GU a good measure?,"Since the FG is what measures the residual sugar in the final beer, why do we use OG, instead of FG, to calculate the ratio of the bitterness over the sweetness in final beer? How precisely is the quantity IBU/GU? "
2419,Leaf Hops to Pellet Hops,"I've seen conversions of like.. add 10% when going from pellet hope to leaf hops.  My question is probably numb nuts.. i.e., I see recipes that have leaf hops in them and I want to use pellet hops...   So, if the recipe calls for:  0.3 oz Liberty whole hops w/ 4.5% a.a. how much would I use if using pellets? Same with German Halertauer hold hops asking for 1 oz of 4.3% a.a.  My assumption ;-) ... if going in the opposite direction.. pellet to whole you would add 10%.. then going from leaf to pellet you would use 10% less ?????  Thanks for the help. "
2420,Have I ruined my brew before I even begin?,I've a question. Have I ruined my brew? I sterilised everything as normal. Got my 2 litres of boiling water and added the contents of my coopers Australian pale ale to it mixed it up with the spoon. Filled the fermentation bucket up to the 22.5L level. Seen it was at 25°c and pitched the yeast. Then had a sudden realisation what I'd missed. Forgot to add the brewing sugar. So I quickly opened my coopers beer enhancer 2 and added it on top of the yeast. Gave it a stir to break the sugar up. And sealed it up. What I'm wondering is because I pitched the yeast before adding the brewing sugar will it affect it in anyway? Because I added the sugar after I'd filled the bucket the total volume went up to 23.5L too. Also because I did it in a stupid order I had to take my o.g reading with the yeast pitched so will this effect anything? Please help I made a right mess of this one. Thanks James. 
2421,Other fruit cider BJCP question,"Good afternoon, guy!  I've been planning to make a specialty cider and have been looking into ""28B. Fruit Cider"" of 2008 guide or ""40B. Cider with Other Fruit"" of 2014 version.  One thing I don't really get is what is it... Does it mean that I have to use apple juice as primary source of sugar and other fruits (like apricot) for the taste, or can I just use apricot juice and still call it an other fruit cider?  If I have to use apple juice, what proportion is appropriate, like 51%/49%? I'm asking it from BJCP point of view. If I eventually make something worth drinking, and enter it into one of the competition, I don't want to be disqualified. :)  Sorry if it is a dumb question. "
2422,Fermentis S04 vs.US05,I am trying dried yeast for the first time. I did up 100 litres of English IPA yesterday and I pitched 2xS04 into 50 litres and 2xUSO5 into 50 litres.  Anybody want to hazard a guess at the fermentation times? I am fermenting at about 18 degress C.   Is 04 faster than 05?   Are both faster than liquid Wyeast?  Thanks! 
2423,I don't know what I've got or if it's drinkable?,for several months now I have been squeezing my ripened citrus and storing it in an air tight bottle in the fridge.  I drink or add it to something from time to time and continually add juice to it. On Saturday I went to drink some and it had a Kombucha like fizz when I tasted it. What is this and is it drinkable?  Have I created something good or is it filled with bad bacteria?  Help before I throw it out please. 
2424,Vorlauf Fermentables?,"Recently looking at the AHA Big Brew Day Recipes, I was looking at the Old School Barleywine (pdf). I get the hops schedule, but the fermentables has me confused. In the instructions, it says mash at 152 F for 90 minutes, I get that. Then mash out at 168 F for 15 minutes. I'm not sure I get that. Perhaps I don't understand really what a 'mash out' is. (That is a subject for another question.) My question here (and perhaps it relates to the mash out) is that it lists grains for both the mash and the vorlauf. I'm wondering how these two are related, specifically, how are grains used in/added to the mash while starting the vorlauf? Are they added while vorlaufing (is that a word?)? I can't ever guarantee how long a vorlauf might take, so is this related to the 15 minute mash out? Relevant recipies and instrutions below...  Fermentables Mash 12 lbs (5.4 kg) 2-row malt 6 lbs (1.4 kg) Maris otter malt  Vorlauf 8 oz (227 g) Caravienne® malt 8 oz (227 g) Crystal 40 malt 4 oz (113 g) Crystal 65 malt 2 oz (57 g) Crystal 120 malt 2 oz (57 g) Special B malt  Mash grains at 152° F (67° C) for 90 minutes Mash out at 168° F (76° C) for 15 minutes, with pre-boil wort volume of 6.5 g (25 L)  "
2425,What would happen if you took raw grape juice and covered but did not refrigerate?,"I'm curious about something that maybe someone can answer from personal experience.  If I took red or concord grapes, crushed them, filtered the juice, covered it and stored it at an average temperature (say 75°F or so), what would happen to the juice? I am saying that there were no additives put in the final juice (e.g. sugar, yeast, etc.). Would the juice turn to vinegar? Wine? Spoiled juice? If wine, what would be the alcoholic content and would there be a point at which fermentation would end?  Again, just curious. "
2426,Where does the grape flavor/aroma come from in dark beers?,"I did two different dark beers, a rauchbier and a imperial stout, and noticed a grape aroma and flavor in them. The fermentables that there're in common are: pilsen, flaked oats, caramalt and black malt. My intuition says the black malt is the source of grape's flavor, but I'm not sure. While in the rauchbier (fermented at 18C, 5% of black malt) this flavor was too unpleasant, in the imperial stout (fermented at 16C, 1% black malt) it was smoother and didn't dominate. Apart from the difference in the temperature (higher producing more esters, i.e., fruity flavors), where are this grape flavor coming from? Is it coming from the black malt indeed? "
2427,How to Calculate Priming Sugar while Bottling Lagers?,"Primary Fermentation: 50*F/10*C       2 weeks Diacetyl Rest:        65*F/18.3*C     2 weeks Lager:                31*F/-0.5*C     4 weeks   I am reading contradictory information regarding the amount of priming sugar to add for carbonation to a lager.  Some sources suggest using the highest temperature (in my case, 65*F/18.3*C) while other sources suggest using the lowest temperature (31*F/-0.5*C) assuming it was held ""for a while"", and other sources suggest using the current temperature as the input to calculating the total priming sugar.  For example, using the calculators from Brewer's Friend and Northern Brewer, for 2.2 volumes of CO2 for 5 gallons of beer:  Brewer's Friend  33*F  1.5oz  of corn sugar Brewer's Friend  65*F  3.8oz  of corn sugar Northern Brewer  33*F  1.57oz of corn sugar Northern Brewer  65*F  3.5oz  of corn sugar   What about the fact that when I take my carboy out of the freezer into room temperature, it takes me no less than 5 minutes to siphon it into a bottling bucket, and no less than 30 minutes to bottle 5 gallons (operating at my peak efficiency)?  Additionally, I fill 12 bottles at a time before capping them all. Not only is the bottling bucket warming at one rate, but each of the bottles are warming up at different rates based on the time they have been out.  What is relevant here? Is it ""the temperature of the bottle at the moment it was sealed with a cap""?  Am I over thinking this or are these relevant issues? Should I just wait for the beer to warm up to the stable room temperature, calculate the priming sugar based on room temperature and go from there? Or, does carbon dioxide escape the solution based on a function of time and temperature, not just temperature, which would require me to leave the carboy at room temperature for some time before adding the priming sugar? "
2428,"Pressure inside mash tun, lid popping up","I have just finished building my mash tun using an insulated plastic barrel. Everything works great but when I pour hot water into the barrel and put a lid on, pressure builds up inside and eventually ""blows up"" the lid. My question how do you deal with this? Do you let the steam slip away (make a small hole or something like that) or do you just fix the lid so it won't budge? "
2429,Is autolysis a problem when reusing yeast?,"I've seen around here and in other sources that for homebrewers a secondary fermentation (concerning autolysis) isn't necessary, unless you're going to dry hoppy or something like that. My question is about autolysis when reusing yeast. When one storage an used yeast for several months, or over several batches, is it needed to be careful with autolysis?  Generally people says that a starter would be enough to get the right amount of live cells and therefore autolysis isn't a problem. But dead cells will survive through starters, why this is not a problem?  For how much time and how much batches is it safe to maintain the yeast cake? "
2430,Mead Stuck Fermentation,"So, I made a 5 gallon batch of mead on 10Apr2015. I used 17 lbs of pasteurized clover honey and 4 gallon of spring water (no-boil method). OG = 1.130. I used D47 Lalvin yeast (3 packs) with 1/4 tsps  of Ferm K and 1/2 tsp of DAP 4 times in the first 3 days. Temperature is pretty stable at 68-70F.  I as planning to add some strawberries at G=1.050 (ABV~10%) to make it a melomel, but...   After 7 days of strong fermentation it stuck around 1.090. It took 3 weeks to move it from 1.090 to 1.060. After that I racked the mead into a clean new bucket and re-pitched another packet of D47... No changes. The gravity is dropping by 0.002 per day at best... Right now it is on 1.050 and I am planning to add some frozen strawberries (5-7 lbs)...   Is it normal? Would adding berries boost the fermentation? I want to drop it at least to 1.025. Should I increase the temperature to speed up the process? I'm afraid that it will stop at 1.035-40 or something. Could it be because of the honey? I haven't had any issues with my other meads. Usually I have to manually stop the fermentation at 1.010-15 before it dries out.  Any suggestions?  UPDATE (8 May 2015):  It's been 3 days since added 1tbs of yeast energizer (mix) yeasts, 1tsp of potassium carbonate and 7 lbs of frozen Wild Blueberries (that's how much space I had left in my carboy). For the last 2 days it's been fermenting like crazy. Previously I had bubbles going through airlock one per minute. Now I actually had to get a blow-off tube, because it is bubbling every 2 seconds. Maybe there is hope after all :)   You know what... since I restarted this mead on the Star Wars Day (May the 4th),  I'll call it ""the New Hope"". :) "
2431,No Bubbles and No Foam after 3 Days,"First time brewer here.  I'm concerned my batch is not progressing as it should.  Here's a quick run down of what I've done...  I put my batch (which had a SG of 1.044) in the primary fermenter on Saturday and stored it in a dark room at about 68 degrees.  On Sunday the ailock was producing consistent, rapid bubbles.  On Monday the bubbles stopped.  On Tuesday there was still no activity so I popped the lid to take another gravity reading.  There was no foam on top and it looked like there was a ring of trub on the sides of the bucket, just above the liquid.  (I'm assuming it got there from foaming at some point right?) I took the gravity reading and it came out 1.006.  Based on my directions the ABV% should be 4.98.  I have two primary concerns: 1.  Why did the bubbling stop so soon? 2.  Why wasn't there any foam?  Its now Wednesday (end of day 4 in fermentation), and I plan on doing a secondary fermentation.  Should I get the batch in the secondary now?  Any solutions or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!    Cheers! "
2432,US-05 Fermentation Temperatures / Top Cropping,"Brewed a 1.060 OG IPA last night (extract), pitched a packet of US-05 reconstituted with 5 ounces of water.  Pitched at 68 degrees, but I wanted a clean fermentation with minimal esters, so I have the fermenter at an ambient temp of 63 degrees.  Less than 12 hours of a lag, and I'm seeing some airlock activity, thermstrip on the fermenter reads 63 degrees.  A couple of questions:  1.)  I know this is the low, low end of US-05's preferred fermentation temperatures, but unfortunately, I do not have temp control at the moment, so its either 63 degrees (basement) or 68/70 degrees (main floor of house).  Do I have yeast strain issues at 63 with US-05?  I would warm it up to 68/70 after a week or so for a diacetyl rest (may not be necessary).  The other problem is there might be some minimal draft/temp fluctuation in the basement this time of year.     2.)  I have never top-cropped before, but want to use this yeast for a cream ale I'm doing next week.  The common knowledge is that US-05 rarely needs a starter, but since I am propogating from a working batch, I thought it might be a good idea.  The alternative is just cropping, funnel into a vial, and pitch into the cream ale (OG will likely be low .060's).  Small starter with the stir plate or no? "
2433,What to look for in a temperature controller,"I've decided to begin assembling the components for temperature control, as I am walking around telling new homebrewers that its the best thing one can do to improve quality, yet I myself don't have it.  I am going to buy a temp controller and a freezer (but will need to make space, as I live in a small rowhouse), but was wondering which controllers are best for homebrewing.  There seems to be quite a bit of price difference out there.  At the high end, I was looking at this one by Ranco:  [website]Also by Ranco, but a third the price: [website]I've also heard of some people having good experiences with Johnson, such as this one: [website]I would prefer to have to do minimal wiring/splicing, etc. myself, as my wife is already patient enough with my obsession and don't want to add and electrical fire and burned-alive dog to the mix to test it further.    Maybe this should be a community wiki?  Thanks in advance! "
2434,Can a water heater element be installed in a conduit punched hole?,"I'm thinking I want to build myself a kettle with a heater, a valve and a cooling coil. So four holes. probably, two different sizes  Perusing the electricbrewery.com site, they stress the need to use a chassis/radio punch, but they're expensive. For the same price, I could get one of the sets sold on ebay or harborfreight.  Reading around other sites, I read the elements typically are 1"" National Pipe Straight Thread. This measures 1.3"" which is the size the conduit punches produces.  Given the standard conduit hole sizes, some washers and a high temp o-ring, can I get a good install using this combination?  Is there more than one size heater element (the mounting portion)? Different threading? something else I'm missing? "
2435,How much hops to use when reducing a batch size?,"I want to brew a 2.5 gallon batch of beer based on a West Coast IPA recipe for a standard 5 gallon batch.  Is there a calculation for scaling back the amount of hops used for bittering, aroma and dry-hopping?  I assume one doesn't add the same amount of hops as in a 5 gallon batch, right?! "
2436,Honey/Ginger Brew With Champagne Yeast,"I got it in my head last weekend that I needed to homebrew again (it's been more than 10 years!), and so I boiled 4lbs of honey, 2lbs of ginger, 1lb of dark brown sugar and 1.5lbs of raisins (since none of that other stuff has much in the way of yeast nutrients beyond sugars) with some cinnamon and other spices and put it in my 6-gallon beer carboy with 1pckg of Red Star champagne yeast.  By the next morning, I had one bubble in the airlock every 4 seconds.  Less than a week later, I'm down to 1 bubble every 5 seconds.  So I'm using champagne yeast for primary fermentation.  I have no idea how this is going to turn out, how long it's going to take to finish primary fermentation or whether I just wasted $30 worth of ingredients.    Is 1 bubble every 5 seconds too slow?  I've got it in a dark closet in my laundry room.  We're having a warm winter here in North Carolina, but there's no heat register in the room and it stays at around 66-67F all the time.    I guess it is what it is at this point--maybe I should have asked questions first and shot later--but I was curous.  Any thoughts? "
2437,How to chill wort,"I have made a few batches of beer from those home brew kits sold at Brew n Grow.  When I cook the beer, I only am boiling 2.5 gallons instead of the whole 5, per instructions, and then I add the other 2.5 gallons from my tap water.  My question is, is they recommend a wort chiller.  When I add the 2.5 gallons to get my total of 5 gallons, it naturally cools down the beer because the tap water is cold.  What advantages does the wort chiller have?  I suppose the tap water doesn't get it all the way cool, but does a great portion of the cooling, because basically it is direct cooling as opposed to heat transfer cooling through a copper tube.  Does adding the 2.5 gallons of cold tap water introduce potential bacteria into my wort??    Any answers would be greatly appreciated!  Thanks! "
2438,How to compensate for wort internal temperature when using a temp controller?,"What's the best method to use a temperature controller during fermentation? If you're using a freezer (or warming apparatus) connected to the controller, how do you compensate for the fact that the wort's interior temperature can be several degrees higher than the air temperature around the fermentor?  In answering a recent question about temperature control inside a freezer, mdma stated:     Finally, if you want to be really sure what your fermentation   temperature is, it's best to add a thermowell and a separate   thermometer. Don't be tempted to use the controller thermometer to   both measure and control the wort temperature - the wort changes   temperature very slowly, and the controller will overshoot massively,   causing everything else in the freezer to be frozen.   This was enlightening to me. I just bought a temp controller and until reading this post I had been planning to put the controller probe into the thermowell. If I understand what mdma is saying, because the relatively dense mass of the wort will not change temperature as quickly as the surrounding air, by the time the probe in the thermowell has reached the target temperature, the air surrounding the fermentor will have dropped considerably farther. Then the ambient temp will continue to chill the wort itself, resulting in a lower-than-expected wort temp and wider swings in temp as the controller cycles cooling on and off, thus defeating the goal of maintaining a consistent temperature.  (Side note: I suspect that when fermenting ales at room temperatures, the rest of the freezer is unlikely to get all the way down to freezing temperatures, but it would still be a significant variance.)  So how do you balance between air temp and wort temp? Do you just keep an eye on it and adjust the controller if the difference is significant? How much do you compensate between air temp and wort temp? "
2439,Liquid Malt Extract Variation,"While picking up supplies for my 2nd brew yesterday, I noticed that I'm using the same LME for this brew (pale ale) as I did for my last (brown ale). In fact, I only saw the one barrel, so I think this could be the only LME my shop carries.  To me this seems odd. The only differences in ingredients for these 2 brews are the 2ish pounds of grains, and the hops. It seems like 6lbs of extract is by far the major component of each, and I would think it provides the majority of the character. Am I limiting my beer's flavor by using this 'one-size fits all' extract?    follow up:  I have read about all-grain brews, and I would think that mashing a specific combination of malted grains would provide a much more variable flavor than using a standard extract. Is this why all-grain seems to be the preferred method?   Thanks! "
2440,Batch carbonate then bottle,My problem stems from the fact that I do not have a place to store a keg to carbonate at serving temperature. I would like to either condition in the bottle or force carbonate and then bottle (then chill as needed).   What are my options? I have read other questions here about chilled beer being flat after being force carbonated at room temperature; is that the same with naturally carbonated? Do I need to suck it up and buy another fridge? 
2441,Is it ever unsafe to drink an aged beer?,"I am new to brewing, my first batch is in secondary now. This is more of a curiosity question.  Is there a point when an aged beer becomes a health risk? If so what are the signs of spoilage? "
2442,"Once a beer is carbonated in the bottle, are there any benefits to aging it?","First time brewer.  I have my beer in the bottle (for about 8 days now).  Things are good -- yeast is precipitating out.  The instructions that came with the kit suggested to put 1 bottle's worth of beer in a PET plastic bottle instead of glass -- and when the PET bottle is firm to the touch (i.e. you can't really squeeze it anymore), the beer is carbonated.  The plastic bottle has gotten to this point, but the kit said between ""2 weeks to 1 month, maybe even as long as 2 months"" of bottle conditioning time, depending on the ambient temperature and the mood of the yeast.  I've kept the box with the bottles consistently between 18~23C (64~73F).  I am really anxious to pop open one of the bottles (after refrigerating it of course!) and have a taste -- is there any reason why I shouldn't?  I understand that beer ""mellows"" a bit in the bottle even after carbonation is done -- is that correct?  Is the taste going to change significantly after the carbonation has finished? "
2443,What happens when you push a yeast near its alcohol tolerance?,"I'm brewing with Wyeast's West Yorkshire Ale yeast, which has a documented alcohol tolerance of 9%.   I'd like to push that boundary by brewing an 8.5% ale and wonder what to expect. Common sense says that this constitutes stressing the yeast, so one would expect the normal things that go along with that, like under-attenuation, stuck fermentations, increased esters.  For the sake of argument, let's just assume that the beer will be well-pitched and well-aerated, to give the brave boys the best chance.  Does anyone have personal experience with pushing yeast to their limit?  UPDATE  The beer I ended up making was not near the alcohol tolerance, nor could it have been, but I still ended up learning something.  The beer (1.064) fermented out to 1.020 with West Yorkshire yeast (6% ABV) and 1.013 with Nottingham Dry yeast (7% ABV). The Nottingham is much better-tasting and clearer to boot. I still love the Timothy Taylor yeast for its flavors, but it would seem that sticking to lower gravity beers is best with this yeast. "
2444,Why re-pitch light to dark?,"It is often said that, when re-pitching yeast, you should generally go from low- to high-gravity, and dark to light beers.  When I repitch, I use trub directly.  I understand why using a yeast from a high-gravity fermentation is ill-advised, since the yeast has been stressed, but why go light to dark?  Is this just a matter of color?  If so, how much darkening would you expect to get when brewing, say, an APA after a stout? "
2445,Formula for make up water / gravity change,"If I were to put 3.5 gallons of 1.060 wort into a carboy, and use 0.5 gallons of water to top off to 4 gallons: - What could I project that gravity would be? - Anyone have a good formula, even if just a rough calc?  Basically I'm stuck using my 20 qt pot, and I think the most liquid i could fit without boilover would be 4-4.25 gallons.  I typially have around a .75 gallon/hour boil off...so ending around 3.5.  Thanks! "
2446,The cheapest way to start brewing,"I want to start brewing, but I also like to keep my spending in check. Are there any methods or ways to craft a quality brew while not breaking the bank?  Are some hops cheaper than others? Cheaper beer styles? I would like to start in the price range of $100-200 dollars, but have no idea as to what the most efficient way of spending this is when it comes to brewing. "
2447,Suggestions for inline heating unit housing for wort circulator?,"I built an inline heating element assembly using some 1"" copper pipe, a 1"" threaded female fitting and some 1/2"" fittings.  The idea is, wort comes in from the bottom 1/2"" fitting, flows over the element, and exits the top fitting.  In theory, this should work swimmingly.  It's about 16"" long, however, and it will be hot.  I'd like to fabricate some sort of housing for it and the panel-mount thermostat controller, something that can handle the heat with no issue, and provide a solid base for this thing to be set upright next to my mash tun.  Has anyone else built something like this?  What did you use?  How well does it work? "
2448,Appropriate aging technique for high OG beers,I've seen a lot of talk about aging with several different options and techniques.  I am a bit confused about what the correct method is.  I am about to make a Russian Imperial Stout and I know it needs to be aged for several months before it's ready to drink.     What is an appropriate amount of time to leave in the primary/secondary fermenter before bottling?      Does aging start in the secondary fermenter?      Does aging only happen in the bottle after carbonation?   The reason for these questions is that making an RIS is expensive both cost (compared to lower OG beers) and time in aging.  I want to make sure I am giving the beer the best opportunity to become a delicious RIS. 
2449,How do you make your own recipe?,"I guess most people brew from kits, or from the many available recipes on the net. But for those few recipe formulators, how do you go about building a recipe?   And, given the inexactness of brewing, what do you do when the end result isn't quite what you in mind? "
2450,Bottling Bucket - really necessary?,"Pretty new to the home brew scene and about to have my first attempt at extract brewing next week.  I have spend a lot of time reading up, but openly admit I may have glossed over some aspects. Nonetheless, I feel I have a good grasp to have my first go and hey, a lot of this is about trial and error isn't it.  Apologies if this question is answered elsewhere, too - I did have a look around before posting but could not find an answer.  In terms of bottling day, I understand the process of racking to a bottling bucket with priming sugar etc.  My question is, is the bottling bucket absolutely essential?  What potential pitfalls would I face if I were to either:   prime the beer by adding the priming sugar to the fermenter and gently stirring in before bottling; or using carbonating tabs in the bottles and bottling straight from the fermenter?   I have read up on priming sugar vs carbonating tabs, and I know the pros and cons to each, I just wondered what risk (if any) there is in going straight to bottle from the fermenter assuming either way the beer is properly primed?  Thanks in advance for any thoughts/tips on this. "
2451,How can I contain unexpected bottle bombs,"It's best to follow proper procedure to avoid bottle bombs, but sometimes the unexpected occurs. Is there a good way to store bottles that would contain an unexpected bomb? I'd like to avoid the potential hazard of flying glass and the cleanup involved with soaking surrounding items in beer.  Is there a particular type of plastic bin that would contain a potential blowout? Are cardboard cases enough?  I've read this but all of the answers seemed to be diagnosing that person's particular root cause. "
2452,RO Water Sanity Check,"I recently started using RO water produced from this thing:    Countertop Portable Universal 5-stage Reverse Osmosis RO Purification Water System with DI Deionizing Mixed Bed 0PPM postfilter  The TDS meter (cheap amazon thing) reads 0 ppm. I used Bru'n Water to create a water profile for a Kolsch 15 lb pils, 8oz flaked wheat, 3 oz Acid Malt. Added 2.5 grams Calcium Chloride to mash water of 5.7 gallons. Bru'n water had my PH target at 5.41, but actual PH was closer to 5.1, and I had to tweak the mash with some pickling lime to reach 5.3. Ph meter is a milwaukee ph 53 and I calibrated to 4.01 solution, also chilled mash sample to room temperature.   Is this low PH common using RO water? I know there are lot's of variables here (malt, strength of acid malt etc...) but am I missing something big or is this sort of thing common?  Am I just going to have to keep good notes and work it out? Any pointers or a sanity check of yea..well that's what you have to do would be helpful.  "
2453,"AG brewing newbie, can only hit 50% efficiency, what's going wrong?","I've done 2 one-gallon AG brews now, and both have hit approx. 50% efficiency. I thought I'd fixed what was obviously wrong between the two, but the second one still looks like it's going to come out at about 2% ABV... I wondered if anyone could tell me what I am likely to be doing wrong?  Details:  I'm aware this is a rather 'rustic' setup! If it's simply a case of needing better equipment then good to know:   Heated 1 1/2 quarts of water per lb of grain to 160F in a stock pot Added grain and stirred, temp got down to approx. 150F Put stock pot in a pre-heated (and turned off) oven, and left for 60 mins, checking temp every 15 mins, I was pretty confident I stayed between 148-160 (it got a bit hot at first but I stirred until cooler) Poured mash into large fine mesh colander over bucket Then slowly poured 170f water heated in separate pans over the top, trying to cover as much of the grain as possible This took about 15 mins before hitting 1 1/2 gallons pre-boil volume Cleaned out stock-pot, added colander on top and recirculated wort through grains Then brought to a rolling boil and followed hop schedule Then cooled in 20 mins to 75F in an ice bath Poured through fine mesh strainer into fermenter Was slightly below 1 gallon (probably due to large stock pot, big surface area) so topped up with water, but not much Pitched yeast etc   Was aiming for OG of 1.050 (it's an APA), and I've hit 1.035... which is obviously not great. Where is the most likely misstep? I'm thinking sparging, as the water got through so quickly...  Any tips much appreciated! "
2454,Adding Sugar before primary fermentation and a few associate Gravity Questions,"I mentioned in a previous question that I am about to have a go at my first home brew.  This was prompted when the brother-in-law's girlfriend gave me a beer kit for Christmas (Tom Caxton Real Ale).  I had thought about having a go at this a few times over the years so this was just the gentle push I needed. I am also aware that it is just as easy nowadays to create a homebrew without the need for a kit, but there's no harm in starting out with one either.  I have done a lot of reading around the science behind home brewing and I fully on board with the theory of ""never follow the kits instructions"" (which would ultimately have me add my LME kit to 1 gallon of warm water and then top up with 4 gallons of cold water and leave it).    So I am going to follow one of the methods I have read - the boil, hot break, bittering hops etc. etc.  My question (and I do spot the irony/hypocrisy in this) relates to the beer kit says to add 1kg of brewing sugar to the mix prior to primary fermentation, but one of the in depth brewing guides I read (John Palmer's 'How to Brew') says never to follow that step as, in times gone by malt extract producers have tended to adulterate their products with sugar already.  However, in the same breath, he says the homebrewing has come a long way recently and producers are starting to take more pride in their work.    So:   do I or don't I add brewing sugar prior to primary fermentation?   My understanding is that LME typically yields 34 to 38 points at OG, so for a 5 gallon batch, I would likely need 5 lbs of LME to achieve 1.034 to 1.038 OG.  But my kit purports to make 5 gallons/40 pints yet it only has 4 lbs of LME.  This would mean a likely lower OG yield would it not? If my assumption at 2. is correct, would the additional brewing sugar help to increase the OG? And would the additional sugar be fermentable or would it just remain suspended in the final beer?   While the ABV of my resulting brew is a secondary concern, I also don't want a brew that is safe to drive with (FYI - I absolutely do not condone drink driving).  I know that a lot of the fermentation process will also depend on the quality of the yeast, which is why I will invest in a named brand rather than use the pack provided with my kit.  Also interested to hear thoughts on whether using the brewing sugar for primary fermentation would affect the taste or body of the final brew.  Thanks in advance all. "
2455,How long should Ice wine be aged?,How long should Ice wine be aged in either bulk aging (leaving it in the carboy) or in bottle aging?  Or does the aging process only depend on the type of grape being used? 
2456,Doubling batch size by diluting wort in fermenter?,"I would like to double the size of my batches from 5 gallons to 10 gallons without changing equipment.  For example, let's say I have a 5 gallon recipe for an IPA.  I know my mash cooler is big enough to mash at least double the grain bill for my 5 gallon recipe (I have brewed 5 gallon batches of strong ales which easily have more than twice the grain of my 5 gallon IPA recipe).  If I mash twice the grain for my 5 gallon IPA recipe, then just boil the ~6 gallons of wort (and double the hop additions), can I then split the higher OG 5 gallons of wort into two fermenters (2.5 gallons in each) and top off each fermenter with another 2.5 gallons of distilled water each?  I know mash and boil times will be extended due to the higher grain/OG, but is there anything inherently problematic with ""watering"" down a higher concentration wort to double the batch size?  Thanks. "
2457,Does fermentation rate depend on fermentability?,"How does the fermentability of wort affect the speed of fermentation, if at all?   If I have two batches of wort mashed at different temperatures (say 148 °F and 156 °F - 64/69°C) and I pitch the same amount of the same yeast into both, what will happen in the first few days?   Will the gravity of the more fermentable wort drop faster, or will it go at the same speed as the other and just continue longer?  What I am really trying to get at is whether the drop in gravity during the first 24-48 hours of fermentation can be used to estimate the final gravity. My experience says no, but I haven't done enough brews in nearly identical conditions to be sure. "
2458,Controlling fermentation temperatures,"I'm conscious this is the third question I've asked before I even get started on my first brew, but hey-ho; better to learn from the experience of others and get as close to ""right"" first time.  I am about to start an ale brew and understand the ideal temperature for fermentation to be effective is in the range of 18 degrees centigrade (c. 64F) to 22 degrees centigrade (c. 72F) - maybe even 20-22C.  My problem is that where I live currently (north west England) the outside air temperature is a crisp 4-8C during the day dropping to freezing at night.  The impact of this is that even with regular central heating, the best indoor range of air temperature I can get is between 15C (lowest) and 18.5C (highest) - having taken regular test readings at intermittent intervals throughout a few days - and I am not sure how these factors would impact on the temperature of my brew and fermentation.  I don't have a home thermostat in order to keep a constant, so the indoor temperature fluctuates with the timed on/off intervals of my central heating (presently 1.5 hours at 6am, 1 hour at midday and 2 hours from 5-7pm).  I had considered a number of options to maintain a decent temperature including heat mats and brew belts and I am comfortable with the pros and cons of each and their potential effects on the brew.  I have ruled out more expensive thermostatic options as too expensive to blow on my first brew.  Does anyone have any thoughts on how they would maintain a suitable temp during fermentation with these conditions? Has or does anyone currently brew ales in these conditions with positive results?   Interestingly, I have read that active fermentation can warm a brew by 5-8C, so assuming I get the fermentation going in the correct range, is it possible that the heat given off during fermentation could actually keep my brew in the correct range anyway? "
2459,Connecting the wort chiller to a sink on a lower level,"I'm considering brewing indoors this weekend, instead of my usual outdoor process in warmer times of the year.  Since the last time I brewed indoors, I've replaced my kitchen sink's faucet with one to which I'm reluctant to try to attach the wort chiller (immersion - copper coil).  A pond pump for recirculating water through the chiller is in my future plans, but that's not going to happen before this upcoming brew day.  I have a utility sink in the basement, and the hose reel is down there for winter storage anyway.  Could I hook up the hose in the basement and then run it up one level of stairs to my kitchen for the wort chiller?  There's no backflow preventer on the utility sink, could that cause problems? "
2460,specific gravity too high to bottle?,"I recently brewed the Brewer's Best Milk Stout, which uses LME plus lactose and maltodextrin. The original gravity was 1.060, which is within the specs for offered in the instructions. Now after about 1 month in secondary, the beer is is holding steady at 1.030, which is apparently too high (specs indicate 1.020 - 1.024). I'm nervous to bottle in case they will explode.  I tried adding some dry ale yeast (Safale US-05) to try and kick the fermentation on, and even added a little heat with a brief water bath, but after one week there is no change. Furthermore, the room im fermenting in ranges from about 65-70 degrees, so it seems unlikely to have become stuck from low temperature. Also, the beer tastes fine right now, but I don't have the experience to tell whether it's ""too sweet"".  Two potential issues come to mind. First, I spaced out and failed to add the lactose and maltodextrin to the boil -- they were added just before racking into the primary. Perhaps these non-fermentables didn't see as much conversion to fermentables as they might have? Second, I may not have used a temperature conversion for the original gravity, so perhaps the OG was actually higher than 1.060, and the 1.030 really is indicating a greater amount of non-fermentable sugar than I am expecting?  What should I do? I'm tempted to just bottle it, since my hunch is that the high FG indicates a lot of non-fermentables, but perhaps I should try adding some more yeast of some kind? What kind? "
2461,recipe confusing -- boil only some of the wort?,"I have a recipe for a 1-gallon, all-grain rye ale that calls to:  1. Mash in with 1 gallon of water (1.3qts/lb) 2. Rest 152F for 60 minutes 3. Sparge with 1.5 gal water at 167F 4. Collect 2 gal wort and bring to boil 5. ... and so on ...   Why does it say to collect only 2 gallons of the wort? Why would I dispose of some wort? Also, 1 gallon seems to much, given that I have 2.8 lbs of grain ... "
2462,How long should I give pectic enzyme to takle hazy finished fruit wine?,"I've got a gallon of really sweet, 16.5% kiwi wine. The fermentation has not been completely stopped but haze didn't settle with time or after I used fining agent. A quick test with methylated spirit confirmed I am dealing with pectin haze.  I'm planning to throw in a pectolase solution to my wine to break down pectin. I'm not sure how long I should let it sit before the enzyme has done it's job. Is it more like hours, days or weeks? Is if going to be obvious that the process has finished (i.e. will the broken down pectin then precipitate and settle down as sediment) or will I have to eyeball it and hit it with more fining agents later?

2464,Amount of oak chips,"I'm brewing an imperial stout. It will have 10-12% ABV in the end (hopefully). I never used wood chips before, but want to add it to this beer. I read through guides but I read everything from just 24 hours to 2 months.   I have about 12 liters of the stout and want to add the chips next week after primary fermentation is done. How much do I add and how long?  I would prefer to do it for 2 weeks as I'm on vacation that time. My plan would be to fill a 100-150ml glas with the chips, soak them in whisky, drain, add to a bag and add the to the fermenter. Is this reasonable? It would be better to be on the safe side and to don't have an overwhelming wood character.  If it matters, the beer will be bottled after the secondary and I want to wait until winter to drink it. "
2465,Can blood glucose devices measure anything in beers?,"Those blood glucose devices used to control diabetes disease, can them measure anything in beers?   Could them display different values of different beers? How do they work compared to hydrometers?  And how about using them to measure sugars in worts? "
2466,Pitching kombucha starter instead of yeast,"My friend recently gave me the idea of making a kombucha-inoculated beer. Having never done it before, the principle seems fairly straightforward to me (this is my own guesswork):   Ferment kombucha as normal (done!) Prepare base beer recipe/wort, let it cool Pitch enough kombucha starter to inoculate wort (for my 8L batch, about 1L of starter according to normal kombucha ratios) Let it ferment normally as with any other yeast pitch   It seems that this would inoculate the wort with the bacteria and yeast I want (Lactobacillus and Brettanomyces). It, in theory, should slightly sour and acidify the wort, and of course ferment it. Let's assume I have an OG of about 1.060 using primarily 2-row malt, nothing too high.  There are a few things I'm not sure about:   Is approximately 1/8 wort volume enough kombucha starter to get fermentation going (1L for 8L of wort)? Can the kombucha SCOBY actually ferment down the beer appropriately (e.g. below 1.020) - or do I need to pitch additional yeast? Will hop additions during the boil later kill the bacteria in the SCOBY when I pitch? Am I doing this all wrong and there's a better way?   I think that the end product should be a fermented, slightly sour and acidic wort with more or less the same qualities as kombucha in terms of flavor, but with a slight malt backbone.  PS - I could use some other Lactobacillus-laden product to sour the wort, but I thought that since I have mature kombucha sitting on my counter I may as well use it! "
2467,Stuck Mead Fermentation?,"Obligatory: This is my first batch of Mead and I'm still learning the ropes. If I've made any critical mistakes, please point them out but do know: odds are, I had no idea of that particular issue.  I'm brewing a batch of traditional mead, following every step and ingredient used by these guys City Steading on Youtube: [website]My issue:  I'm almost two weeks in, and my hydrometer reading has almost not changed whatsoever. For the one gallon batch, my OG is 1.109 and current is 1.105. The carboy almost always has bubbles in the carboy, the airlock is bubbling about once every 10 seconds as of yesterday morning, and I've been shaking it to aerate for the past week. The room it's in is generally kept at 65F, deviating slightly above during the day and below during the night by about 2 degrees.  Should I repitch my yeast? Or am I making any stupid mistakes? "
2468,"First Brew got a high OG and planning to put apricots in the fermenter, will the yeast be able to get the sugar before the alcohol kills it off?","I went all grain BIAB straight off, recipe was kind of my own:  10l batch   1kg marris otter malt barley 1Kg wheat 100g oats 40g hallertauer hops in total  400g enhancer packet of witbier yeast (mangrove jacks) 8% alc tolerance   got a OG of 1.062 which I thought was high for this kind of beer and I was planning to add apricot puree from cans in a few days but starting to think this is a bad idea and is going to make the beer even sweeter. if people think this is not the case how long shall I wait before putting them in?  I also didn't do a starter for my yeast and I boiled away too much wort so I just boiled a standard electric kettle and topped it up at the end of the boil (don't know if this is a problem). thanks  Im also thinking about bottles exploding if there's too much sugar left? What kind of final gravity will be okay for bottling? "
2469,Oversparging grainfather,"Most of my beers where I live now have been astringent (5 or so). Some more some less. I found one of the culprits after lots of research: I have incredibly high alkalinity (400ppm CaCO3). So I have decided to mix my own water with destilled water and the usual salts. Now I am worried about oversparging. Presuming I construct ideal water and calculate my mash and sparge water using the usual method, do I still need to worry about oversparging? If so how do I go about avoiding this on the grainfather? I've never read a detailed technique anyway. Keep sampling the sparge runoff every 5 mins and test the pH using a meter? "
2470,Solid sugar to primary,"Next weekend I’m planning to brew a tripel and the recipe includes some table sugar. I usually add the sugar a few days in, after high krausen to reduce the stress on the yeast (= no starter required) in the form of a boiled-cooled sugar solution. But this brew is going to take place at my parents and myself won’t be around during the week(s) after to make the solution. I don’t want to bother the old folks with the amount of work and responsibility to make the solution, so I was wondering, why not add the sugar to the beer in its solid, powder form? It is much less work to dump it straight in.  There are a few drawbacks I could think of. One is the sugar not dissolving. When it is dumped in, it will probably make a pile at the bottom of the fermenter. I think it eventually will all dissolve and due to the activity of the yeast there is a ‘flow’ in the liquid. The other one is sanitation.  What are your thoughts? Go or no-go? "
2471,Carbonation dissipates very quickly after opening bottled beer,"I finished a German Wheat beer that I kettle soured and then I made a franken-beer shandy with a couple of gallons of the leftover wort. Neither of these beers seems to have kept their carbonation.  The first beer was force carbed. When filling I did not bleed my keg, I just lowered the pressure and then bottled with 2-3 psi from the keg using a Last Straw bottle filler. Since my filler is a Last Straw, it can purge O2 and then fill easily. It fills by pressing the nozzle to the bottom of the bottle to let the beer flow and fill.  More often than not it foams like crazy so I fill a bottle as best as I can and then move on to maybe 1-2 more than go back and top off the first bottle and cap it.  I don't think that amount of time could affect my carbonation that much could it? I'm not getting any off-flavors from oxidation or anything in my beers.  Note: When force carbing the keg was rolled on its side like usual until the regulator was silent.  The shandy was low and slow and was keg carbonated and is carbonated when served from the keg.  Now opening the bottles at a homebrewer meeting there is initial carbonation but then it dissipates rapidly and then there is barely some residual carbonation in the beer and no head at all (previously had a nice creamy one) or much discernable carb. I also filled a vacuum-sealed growler with my shandy beer and it also had no carb when it was opened.  What gives?  NOTE: There was no contamination or off flavors in my original beer or my franken-shandy.    Recipe Details  OG - 1.030  FG - 1.007  Added 2 oz of fresh lime zest to the last 10 mins of my boil.    Pitched two packets of Safale US-05. Ferment at 65°F (18°C) for 10 days and packaged as described above. 2.6 oz of fresh lime zest was added to the fermenter 8 days into fermentation.  "
2472,Cider Issues - identical batches acting differently,"Here's a strange one. I pressed a large load of apples a week ago, getting just over 26 litres. I let it sit for a day in a single Fermenting bin with a dose of Camden to clear up wild yeast and a scoop of yeast nutrients.  I then transferred half the juice to a second bin, chose not to add sugar as the sp was coming in at a healthy 1.090, added my yeast equally, sealed up with identical air locks and left in a spare room. Within 24 hours, one bin was bubbling away quite happily, developing a good frothy top. The other, nothing. Slowly, over the next few days, it started to fizz but no froth and no sign of any bubbling.   After 6 days I cracked it open and it smelt pretty pungent which gave me confidence. I added some more nutrients and yeast and it fizzed away happily for a few hours, though still no bubbling through the air-lock.   Really don't understand how one bin can be doing all the right things whilst the other not so. Should I just leave it for another week and then transfer to Demijohn? Mix the two back together and then into Demijohns? Put in yet more Yeast? Is seems like its Fermenting but why no air lock action?   Any thoughts?   Cheers  "
2473,First time brewing Ginger Beer. Is it dead?,"I am attempting to brew homemade ginger beer using this recipe  However, this is my second attempt at a plant/bug and it doesn't seem to be going well. Like the first time, the sediment in the plant just seems to settle in the bottom and I never really see the bubbles. It then starts to have little mould parties on the surface (little white fuzzy spots that develop black in the middle)  It doesn't smell bad but I can't imagine the mould is good. Is there something I'm doing wrong? Should I be feeding the plant from day two and not wait to see those bubbles?  Any help would be greatly appreciated. "
2474,Cooling wort in ice bath and transferred wort temp,I've been using an ice bath to cool my wort that's boiled in a big pot. After 30 mins the wort temp in the bath is usually 20 degrees Celsius. After I transfer it to the fermenter though it's reading 30. I'm not quite sure what I can do now to cool it back to at least 23 so I can pitch the yeast.   Any ideas? And why is the temp so different after transferring? I took readings from all over the pot to ensure it was cool enough.   Thanks  
2475,primed beer left uncapped,"I brewed a trippel, added priming sugar, and bottled it, but my bottle capper broke after only a few bottles. I placed caps atop the remaining bottles but won’t be able to seal them until I can replace the capper.  These bottles will have set like this for four days. What can I do to make sure this batch carbonates? If I add a bit more primer, how much is enough? Thanks for any help! "
2476,Currently looking at spaces for a number of home brew kits. Looking for guidance in any way,"I am currently trying to organize a space for a collective of 10 brewers to store their 2-5 gallon kits. I'm currently looking into studios, as the area that I am in does not have many options for garages or storage container workshops.   We are only beginning and therefore what are the most basic essentials to get us going?  And how should we best organize a small space for small scale home brewing? "
2477,Brewing in an oversized kit - any risks?,"I'm looking at buying a larger brew kit to go alongside the current 27L setup I currently have.  I've been toying with the idea of upgrading to 200L and simply not brewing to capacity, maybe brew around 120L at a time or 80L at a time, or even as low as 50L at a time.  The question is, are there any risks with boiling in an oversized kit? Will there be a risk of the evaporating DMS condensing on the walls and dripping back in or will that be such a minute amount as to be unimportant? Or perhaps something else I haven't thought of? "
2478,Brewing with Pico C results in way too much yeast flavor,"When I brew according to the instructions by the picobrew in my pico C the resulting beer has way too much yeast flavor. I already had 3 batches and all of them have this problem.  Edit: After getting more details I noticed their manual changed.  Here is old version of the manual (the one I actually followed for my brews): [website]Here is new one: [website]Fermentation step actually now is different. (page 60 step 2)  I guess I should try with new instructions and see if it's any better (they do say to pitch only half of packet now, instead of full. Also they no longer recommend to aerate the wort).   My original question was: How to minimize the yeast flavor?  I tried tasting beer 1 month after bottling, 2 months, 3 months. It's always way too much yeast flavor. "
2479,Old ginger bug not bubbling anymore - could it still be alive in spite of no bubbles,"I have an old ginger bug (my first) that I have had going for a few months and used a couple of times to make ginger beer with great results.  Last couple of months, though, I haven't been able to take proper care of it. It was in the refrigerator for a month without feeding. When I took it out a while back, it was flat with all the ginger settled at the bottom, but with a healthy accumulation of white stuff (yeast &amp; bacteria) at the bottom of the jar.  I wanted to get the bubbling activity going again so I fed it a few times with no success. After that, it's been in and out of the refrigerator a few times, with some more attempts at reviving it (sometimes I have forgotten feeding it for a week while it's sitting on a shelf in the pantry), but nothing has happened.  It looks alright (there's no mold), it smells alcoholic and gingery, it has a hazy orange-brown colour and a white ring of microbes at the bottom. I'm not sure if the yeast and bacteria are still alive and capable of fermenting a new batch of ginger beer.  So my questions are:   Is the bug safe? (Considering it was outside the refrigerator without feeding for over a week.) Should I just throw it out and start afresh? What happens if I leave an old/mature ginger bug outside the refrigerator without feeding for a few days?   If it's safe:   Is the bug alive? Apart from the bubbling, is there any other way of knowing that it's alive? Is there something I can do to revive it, or is it incapable of reviving? If the bug is not bubbling, could it still be alive and capable of fermenting a new batch of ginger beer (considering the alcoholic smell and the presence of the white ring at the bottom)? Could I just take a chance and see if it works (provided it's safe)?   Thanks,  Aditya "
2480,Impact of reboiling wort,"Long story short, somehow after a chilling my beer after the boil, I've ended up with additional water in the wort (must have a leak in the chiller!).   Took me a while to notice, couldn't understand why my OG was 20points off!   As a result I need to boil the wort for another hour to get down to my intended volume.  What effect will this have on the beer? I guess I'll lose all of those hop aromas from late additions in the first boil?   For reference it's an APA with hop additions at 60, 15 &amp; 0min.  I intend to do another hop stand to make up for this, but fully expecting the 2nd boil to have a detrimental effect on the beer...  "
2481,Do I require insulation on my primary FV?,"Been reading around for some answers with no luck. I am in the UK and maintaining heat is an issue, all articles I read are y'all Americans trying to keep liquid cool.   So I have a flat arround 17/18 celsius on average, I believe this is fluctuation from 16-20 in reality with heating and overnight temperature drops.   Should i insulate my primary FV? I am worried temperatures will be too high when heat is generate by yeast.   I was thinking of using Aluminium insulation foam used to reflect heat from radiators?    Would anyone be able to clear up if this is necesarry and if there are more suitable solutions?   Cheers,  L.  "
2482,"Is there a limit to yeast ""cake"" fermentation?","When using a yeast cake from another brew, is it possible to use too much?  If so, what is the limit for a 5 gallon keg? "
2483,Is dry hopping a carbonated beer effective?,"Would it be effective to dry hop a beer that has been kegged and carbonated? More specifically, can I open the keg and drop in some dry hops for a week even after I have carbonated the beer?  If it's feasible, what temperature should I dry hop at?  I brewed and kegged a blonde ale which I was hoping would have a noticeable hop aroma. The results are only so-so. It could be that Calypso hops don't stand out as noticeably when used for aroma, or that the honey malt aroma is overpowering the hops. Or both.  The primary concern I see is that carbonation in the beer would just drive off any dry hop aroma I add to the keg, leaving it at best in the head space. I could try to de-gas the beer (I'll have to open the keg anyway) first, but I was hoping to serve this beer at an event in one week.  I've also considered a Randall, but I don't have any experience there and am concerned it would give more hop character than I'm aiming for. "
2484,What is the intended IBU of Wry Smile IPA?,"Various recipes have different IBU's, OG and FG.  The Northern Brewer recipe has .25lb more pale malt and .25lb less rye and crystal malt than the HomeBrewers Association recipe.  What is the intended IBU, OG and FG of this recipe?  Why is the Northern Brewer recipe different than the one listed on the Homebrewers Association website? "
2485,Glass Carboy with bottom spigot - Can/should it be done?,"My friends and I are just getting into homebrewing, and we've been throwing around some ideas to try to simplify things. One of those ideas is to use glass carboys with a bottom spigot in order to eliminate siphoning. We would either do this by getting custom carboys made by a glassmaker (we're thinking of something with a bottom that mirrors the top) or by modifying an existing carboy using glass-cutting tools.  I'm wondering if someone with more experience could chime in and lay out some of the pros and cons of this idea. We're looking for both logistical and monetary comments regarding this. Do you think it will be cost-prohibitive? Do you think we'll run into any issues we have not foreseen? "
2486,"If I live in a country where alcohol is prohibited, how to I deal with these obstacles?","I will have access to wheat and barley, only fresh, nothing malted. I have been reading online a little on malting. So this step doesn't seem to be an issue.  My real issue is yeast. Assuming that all I have is baking yeast, would that be sufficient?   Now, if I wanted to make your basic lager, do I need any other ingredients? Is there a certain mixture of barley and wheat I should make?   Thank you.  EDIT: This is my first question here. I don't know how the process is supposed to work exactly, but it seems that my post is still on hold. Would a mod kindly open it again. Thank you. "
2487,What does the brew master mean by chilling around 30° F (-1°C)?,"I'm going to make Frambozen / Raspberry Brown Ale    I was reading these instructions from the New Belgium Brewing brew master.   He wrote     Ferment down to 1.014 FG, holding temperatures barely above 68° F. Use a neutral ale yeast (like Wyeast 1056) or a Belgian ale yeast, or even both. After fermentation rack your beer off the yeast and chill it around 30° F if possible.      After 2 weeks of aging, rack your beer (being careful not to transfer any sediment) onto raspberry pulp. This pulp should equal 20%....   What I don't get is about chilling the beer to 30° F.  For how long ?  just for a short period or for full 2 weeks until racking onto the pulp ?  I'm assuming the yeast will go dormant and I'm sure some of the water would freeze.  I don't know what the idea is behind this ?  What if I don't have storage that goes that low, how much of a difference does it make for the finished product ? "
2488,Adding cherries to an imperial stout,"I'm looking at this imperial stout recipe, and planning on adding cherries (perhaps bourbon-soaked) to the secondary. I'm pretty new to extract brewing, and have only done one batch previously (only ever done kits customised with extra hops and speciality grains before). I've therefore got a few questions:   How much in the way of cherries will I have to use? (this will probably dictate as to whether or not I soak them in bourbon first!) Do I need to pitch extra yeast to the secondary? If I bottle after the secondary, will the stout carb up? And how much glucose (or whatever) do I need to add?  "
2489,What is the correct way to sanatise plastic pet bottles?,"I just bought a couple of boxes of plastic bottles for my first home brew. I assume that they are clean being new, but I need to sanatise them.  I have a no rinse sanatise solution, should I use that?  But do you rinse it after to remove any potential taste?  Also I do not have a bottle tree so what happens if there is water in the bottles, or should I wait until 100% dry?  Chris "
2490,Will yeast clean up diacetyl generated in a sour mash?,"I have a sour mash that is going on 48 hours, and I'm hoping to press it closer to 72 as I like my sours bitter enough to strip the enamel off my teeth.  Problem is by 24 hours (last night), I went to go check on the temperature, and it was very clear that heterofermentative lacto had settled in.  The moment the lid came off, I had a walloping butter smell that required every window be opened to air it out. It was the most intense smell of diacetyl I think I'll ever encounter.  I heated the mash up to 140-150, ensuring that I kill off any bad (and good for that matter) bacteria, pitched dregs from a few sours (was too late to go pick up a vial at the homebrew store, had to swing by the liquor store instead).  I let the mash cool down to 120, pitched in the dregs, and maintained temp again.  The smell is still present, although not nearly as intense, and it certainly isn't getting any worse since killing it off.  My question is, once I go to ferment this wort, I'll pitch a dry English Ale yeast (WLP007).  Will this (or any) yeast clean up whatever diacetyl remains in the mash as well as the diacetyl generated by the yeast during fermentation?  I assume boiling won't kill off the flavor?  Update:  It has been nearly two weeks and I am still getting very obvious buttery diacetyl characters in both the the aroma and the flavor.  At this point it is difficult to tell whether the diacetyl has decreased during aging, but if I had to guess, I would suspect that it hasn't by any noticeable degree.  It is a very low gravity beer, sitting at 3% ABV, so these sorts of off flavors really stand out. I was given the the suggestion elsewhere to get a yeast starter going and to pitch it at high krausen.  While I dont see the harm in trying (other than wasting time and effort) is it worth the attempt when the diacetyl is still so prevalent?  Am I too impatient at two weeks despite the low gravity? "
2491,Off flavor/odor from cold break,"On page 63 of Brewing Better Beer, Gordon Strong says,     Some of the cold break material can actually help the yeast, but too much can contribute off-flavors.   I can attest to both of these. A couple of times I have,   pitched let the trub settle for a couple of hours racked the really clear wort to a fermenter   Since I was left with a bit of trub that had a bit of nice wort in it, I fermented a bit of it in PET bottle. The fermentation took off extremely fast. But the resulting ""beer"" had a pretty nasty smell.  My question: Can anyone tell me what the off smell/taste from excess cold break is? Is it one of the common ones, like diacetyl, acetaldehde, etc.? I couldn't identify it, but it was pretty distinct. I often detect this same aroma at bottling time, but it always goes away soon after bottling. "
2492,Adding flavour to standard kit,"Looking for some advice, I have been home brewing from kits for a couple of years and really enjoy the hobby. I have experimented with various sugar's to alter the taste and would now like to move on.  I wish to use Bavarian Smoked -rauchmalz malt(crushed). What I need to know is the best way to add the smokey flavour to a lager kit. After reading various articles I seem to be more confused with the options?   steep in 2nd priming for 5 to 10 days mix can of wort with 3 litres of water and boil with malt for 20mins before adding to cold water to make 25 litres  Mix the kit as per instructions and add malt into the primary fermentation in a muslin bag.   If I am totally of key please say, I would appreciate any advice. If I am using malt do I still need to use the same amount of sugar? Use a basic lager kit as non variant, can of wort, 1kg sugar and yeast. Cheers scott "
2493,Heating pad for fermentation,Is there any concern with warming up a fermentation by placing the bucket/carboy on an electric heating pad? Will it kill the yeast that settles on the bottom? 
2494,Filters wort when using a counterflow,I'm building a counterflow chiller. But then I got to thinking how to filter the hops out of my wort. The last thing I want to do is clog the chiller with hops. I know I could use a hop bag. But does that work for 0 minute additions? Do I just switch to dry hopping? For what it's worth I use pellet hops.  Thanks! 
2495,How to tell if a cider is finished without hydrometer,"EDITED  I have a cider that I have made following the steps on CraigTube for his Hard Apple Cider. The only difference is that I have used Champagne yeast and the batch is 22L. I know you are all going to say to check my hydrometer reading but unfortunately I smashed the hydrometer before I could take the initial reading. The airlock still has activity and is still bubbling after 18 days. It is bubbling strongly every 13 seconds. How will I know when it is done. Should I wait until the airlock has no activity at all?  Recipe here:  21L Juice (7bottles)  Yeast Nutrient (Boil up raisins (that don’t have sulphite on them) and small amount of water, mash up the raisins and simmer)  10- 14Cup’s corn sugar or dextrose (the more sugar the more kick it will have)  1 Lalvin EC1118 Yeast  Steps   Boil up yeast nutrient and mash up raisins Take out a little juice from the bottle and add sugar. Shake out the sugar(even do this for the fermenter batch as it saves time and stiring) Put in the yeast nutrient(make sure that it isn’t still too hot) and shake the bottle Add the yeast and shake the bottle a.  If you are making a fermenter size batch then pour it all in the fermenter Leave that until the fermenter has stopped bubbling and leave for a few days.   Ok I have done a small scale test. I have had 1.5L of juice and 1cup sugar(200grams) The reading was 1.092. This test does not include the boiled up rasins.  Ok so another reading has been taken. This is 1.000 "
2496,What is the most popular method of brewing beer?,"I am a beginner and as a beginner almost everything tells you to use malt extracts to brew your beer.  So after a few batches I think I am ready to move up but I am wondering if it's worth the extra work.  Is the beer really better?  Does it require a lot more work?  One big question I have is do most people progress onto all grain brews or do they stay with the extract brews for simplicity?    I ask because I am starting a service that will deliver a new recipe's ingredients to your door every month.  I can't decide if the recipes should be for all grain or extract brews, so I am really trying to get a consensus. I may just let everyone pick which one they want if it is a mixed opinion. "
2497,Primary Fermentation Plastic Bucket Lid,"I just started homebrewing and a couple of friends told me my airlock on my plastic bucket primary should be bubbling.  After 3 days of primary fementing with dry yeast, I've seen nothing, but, you can see through the bucket that there is two inches of foam on top of the wort.  In addition, when you push on the lid, the odor of the wort is strong.  So, I'm thinking that there isn't a good seal on the bucket.  I have two questions.  Is this a problem?  How do I fix it? "
2498,What is a hard apple cider expiration date,"The recipe uses store bought apple juice with no added preservatives or additives.   The store bought juice has an expiration date of April 2014.   Will the cider expire on this date also, or has the process of turning it into alcohol changed the expiration date?  Another thing is if the juice was passed its expiration date before making the cider will that be an issue? The juice tasted fine and I have had a sample of the cider and it tastes really good.  Here is the steps to make it.  Recipe here:  21L Juice (7bottles)  Yeast Nutrient (Boil up raisins (that don’t have sulphite on them) and small amount of water, mash up the raisins and simmer)  10- 14Cup’s corn sugar or dextrose (the more sugar the more kick it will have)  1 Lalvin EC1118 Yeast  Steps 1.Boil up yeast nutrient and mash up raisins  2.Take out a little juice from the bottle and add sugar.  3.Shake out the sugar(even do this for the fermenter batch as it saves time and stirring)  4.Put in the yeast nutrient(make sure that it isn’t still too hot) and shake the bottle  5.Add the yeast and shake the bottle a. If you are making a fermenter size batch then  pour it all in the fermenter  6.Leave that until the fermenter has stopped bubbling and leave for a few days. "
2499,How to know how much starter to make from harvested yeast?,"There are plenty of calculators that tell you how much starter to make for a specific amount of starting yeast and for a specific gravity of the wort. On packages/vials of yeast it tells you the estimate of how many yeast cells there are in there, however when you harvest your own yeast how are you to know how many yeast cells you have? How do you know how much starter to make if you don't know how many yeast cells you are starting with? "
2500,Adding hopped tea at the start of fermentation,"I have a Muntons Premium Larger Kit and have purchased some hops to add some aroma.   The hops I am using are called Wakatu (Hallertau Aroma) pellets.  The instructions I have from the home brew store is to steep 15-30 grams of hop pellets in boiled water then add the water(hop tea) and the hop bag to the fermenter. From what I understand this is done at the start of the brewing process when you are mixing the sugar, water, and Muntons Kit before the yeast goes in. The hop bag then stays in for the duration of the fermenting through till the bottling stage. No secondary is being done.  Will this give a sufficient hoppy flavor to the beer? I want to keep things simple as this is the first time I am dealing with hops but at the same time I still want to get a nice flavor out of them. Am I correct in adding the hops at the start of the fermentation process or should I add them once fermentation is over?  Has anyone tried this method and how did it turn out? Are there any other methods that are straight forward yet give a nice flavor? "
2501,Priming Sugar Amounts,I've always primed my beer at the same rate (5g corn sugar/L) but a recent spate of gushers has made me think that perhaps this is too much - is 4g/L more sensible? or even 3g?

2504,What factors can lead to a higher attenuation?,"I recently brewed a Malt Extract beer with WLP060. The ""Attenuation"" range on the White Labs site says it should be in the range of 72-80%.  I had an OG of 1.0575, and an FG of 1.0096. By my calculations the attenuation was 83% (((1.0575-1.0096)/.0575) x 100 = 83.3).  1) What could have contributed to the higher attenuation %? 2) Is the range listed on the White Labs site more of a range to try to stay within, or, is it a stating what the yeast is typically capable of? "
2505,Can I naturally carbonate a sweet hard lemonade?,"I'm thinking of brewing some hard lemonade, and from what I've read, I'll need to neutralize the yeast with sulfites if I want to prevent it from getting too dry.

2507,Bottled Beer is Cloudy,"I'm brewing my first batch of brew and I bottled almost two weeks ago. I've been super anal about keeping everything sterilized, clean, and at the correct temperature during fermentation and bottling. I've ""swirled"" each beer bottle as recommended by the kit I have and I checked it last night and the beer is still cloudy with small amount of ""stuff"" (Im' assuming sediment/yeast/etc).   I'm getting ready to finally try it out this weekend for the first real taste test, but I have a few questions:    Why is the beer cloudy?   What did I do wrong?  What is the ""stufff"" at the bottom of the beer? Yeast? Sediment/etc?   Is it still OK to drink with it in there?   Should I let it sit for a couple more weeks?    Thanks! "
2508,Triple Fermented?? But Why?,"Some beers claim to be triple fermented, meaning that after primary fermentation, more fermentables are added at the start of secondary, and then the brew is bottle-conditioned, resulting in three separate additions of sugars.  I've read somewhere that yeast is added for secondary.   How much is added during secondary?  Is it a major fermentable addition, or just one or two gravity points' worth, like what is added for bottle conditioning? Is yeast repitched as well? If the second addition is significant, what are its effects?   "
2509,Final Gravity on the Refractormeter vs. the Hydrometer,"I've been brewing the same recipe now for several batches.  It's my house beer.  A Kolsch-style beer.  While I have followed the same recipe for each attempt, I'm sure there has been some variances in how it is brewed.  Specifically, I know that the mash temperature has been a little different each time.  One of the pieces of information that I have been keeping at each attempt is the gravity readings on brew day, when I rack primary to secondary, and when I keg the beer.  At each point, I've been reading gravity with both my hydrometer and my refractometer.  Of course, at the beginning of fermentation, the reading are the same.  At secondary and kegging, they are different.  While the FG reading on the hydrometer has always ended up at 1.010, what I've noticed is that on some batches, the FG reading on the refractometer has ranged from about 1.026 to 1.023.  My question is this:  Is there any way to correlate the mash temperature to the variances in the refractometer reading?  Does this have anything to do with simple sugar to dextrin ratios?  What does this all mean? "
2510,What options exist for temperature control for electric HLT,"Are there any low cost (less than $150) solutions to add temperature control to an electric HLT?  My setup is a keg with a 5500W water heater element.  I love how quickly it brings 15 gallons to boiling (less than 1hr), but it's a bit of a hassle to get the temperature I want.  I know I probably need to be re-circulating to make the temperature consistent, which I can do, but I'm curious if there are some options.  I've looked over the instructions at www.theelectricbrewery.com, which is amazing and wonderful, but the cost for the PID, SSR, heat sink, and temperature probe comes out to about $120 before shipping or tax, and without accounting for misc connector and cable costs, let alone any box to contain it all.  Also, running my boil kettle (exact same setup) at 100% is my only option right now, which requires me to have my large fan running over it to keep from boiling over, and I'm not sure if that'll work once summer rolls around.  Will one temperature control setup work for both?  Is anyone else working creatively in this realm? "

2512,I need some clarification on the use of Lactose,"I am going to try to brew a Russian Imperial Stout with the intent to have something more along the lines of a High Gravity/Desserty type beer similar to Bells Batch 9000.  I am using a kit recipe and modifying it with a little less hops, adding cocoa and vanilla bean with bourbon and american oak with lactose for body/sweetness. I am very familiar with alcoholic fermentation because I make wine for a living.  I will be kegging this beer and the bourbon will be added post fermentation so no need to warn me on the cautionary ABV. I am trying to sort through all the information in my literature and through the grapevine (literally) what I hear about brewing and I am finding what I would consider mixed information on the use of lactose in beer. I understand lactose's use but I see people adding it to the wort instead of the finished beer.  I would think that having a non-fermentable sugar would stress the yeast and risk an incomplete or stinky fermentation.  Is lactose normally added before or after fermentation and why? Also, any good videos on all-grain brewing? "
2513,Hop extracts...,Do you use them? How do you use them? How can I get some? 
2514,Beer not carbonating,"I'm having issues with my Belgian Tripel not carbonating.  There is a small amount of sediment in the bottles, and I get a hiss when they're opened, but that's about it.  It's gotten cold in Virginia since I bottled, but I've tried to keep the temp at least at 66 (which is tough to do in a basement) and they've been bottled for 4 weeks now.  How long should I expect carbonation to take, given the cold conditions and the high gravity of the beer? For the first few days after bottling the temps were well south of 66, I'm guessing between 55 and 60, should I worry about this at all (the yeast used was WLP530 Abbey Ale Yeast)? "
2515,Temperature swing of 10+ degrees during fermentation,"I'm fermenting a porter, and pitched the yeast at about 75°F (24°C) on Sunday night (4 days ago).  Lively fermentation started the next day, and though the wort had cooled to about 68°F (20°C) the first night, the fermentation brought it up to 72-74°F (22-23°C).  There was 2 solid days of really active fermentation at this temperature.  However, there's been a couple really cold nights, and now the CO2 bubbling out has slowed dramatically.  The temperature got down to 65 yesterday, so I put a space heater near it, and it's now up to 76°F (24.5°C) - but the fermentation still seems really slow.  I'm wondering how the swing in temperature is going to affect it - any thoughts?  Also, I'm going to be adding coffee and vanilla into secondary fermentation (in about another 4-5 days), how important is the controlling the temperature while in secondary?  Thanks for the help! "
2516,List of current mini fridge makes/models that will fit 5-gallon kegs?,"Any fellow homebrewers out there have a suggestion on a current make/model minifridge (not full-sized fridge or chest freezer) that will fit 5-gallon corny kegs?  I've seen many suggestions of Frigidaire FRC445GB and Sanyo 4912M models but, like many others referenced online, they seem to be no longer manufactured.     I'm looking for something simply to fit 2 corny kegs and a 5 lb CO2 tank.

Any idea as to what would cause this result? "
2522,Cork in red wine starting to push itself out. Is it still safe to drink?,"A friend gave us a bottle of homemade red wine a year ago. (They're Italian and they make wine every year).  It's been sitting in our dining room, stored on its side.  We started to notice that the cork was starting to push itself out.  We uncorked it, poured a few glasses and tasted it. It still tastes fine, but the wine has a little fizz to it. I drank a small glass 30 minutes ago and I still seem fine.  :)  Why is there some fizz to it? Is it still safe to drink?

2525,When should you measure and adjust mash pH?,"I am getting ready for my first all-grain batch.  I got a copy of my township's water report and sat down to use it in conjunction with the graphs in How to Brew to determine what colors of beer I can make without pH adjustments and if I want to make other beers, what adjustments I need to make.  The problem is the water report doesn't list the Magnesium content.  This data is crucial to using the charts.  I've emailed my township to try to get the info, but I'm not sure I'll hear back.  Assuming I don't know the Mg content of my water and thus can't predict my mash pH, can I just measure the pH of the mash using a pH meter and adjust accordingly?  Is taking a measurement actually better than estimating based on the water report?  When should I take the measurement - after doughing in?  After X minutes?  According to How to Brew, brewing water is adjusted with salts before you begin mashing.  If I can't predict my mash pH and instead have to measure it after starting the mash, how should I add the adjusting salts?  Should I mix them into a pint or so of water then stir them into the mash as well as I can?  If so, should I consider the start of the mash timer to be when I've adjusted the pH?2.  "

2527,Fruit Beer—Hard Time Finding the Correct Fruit,"I'm trying my hand at making an apricot wheat beer (my first fruit beer). The recipe I'm using instructs me to add apricot puree after the wort has fermented for approximately 3 days and recommended that I use the Oregon brand of apricot puree. I've seen cans of Oregon fruit in stores all over my town so I didn't think it'd be a problem.  Now that I'm nearing the time to add the apricot I am realizing that it seems as if no stores stock the Oregon brand of apricot puree. About the only thing I can find is Del Monte apricot halves in heavy syrup. I'm a bit wary of trying to find fresh apricots too.  I understand that the Oregon brand is recommended because it's aseptic and makes worries about contamination far less. However, since I can't find this can I safely use something like the Del Monte brand? If I do use it I'm assuming I should drain off as much of the heavy syrup as possible to avoid adding a bunch of corn syrup to my beer. Are there any other options or concerns I should be aware of? Thank you! "
2528,No psi shortly after kegging,"I kegged my APA tonight and all seemed fine.  I set the psi to 15, burped the keg a few times and put the keg in my fridge.  An hour later I checked on it and the psi was at 0, the co2 tank was covered in frost, there is seemingly no pressure coming from the co2 tank and no excess air in the keg (when I burp it nothing happens).  The temperature in my fridge is 33 f, a little on the cold side I know but it shouldn't matter right?  I had my tank filled up a couple of weeks ago and haven't touched it since.    Did the temperature in my fridge do something (make me lose all my co2 or break some of my equipment)? Should I Assume that my tank didn't have as much co2 as I thought it had? It's 20oz so I would have thought it would be enough for a few keggings assuming it was full.  Any suggestions as to what is going on?  Thanks. "
2529,Is oxidation of yeast starters a concern?,"We all know oxidation is bad, and cooling hot wort is particularly susceptible to this off-flavor-producing problem. the question is; does oxidation matter for starters?  I use a stirplate to aerate the starter during fermentation - pretty common really. This last batch I put the starter on the stirplate while cooling, which decreased the cooling time, but certainly oxidized the starter wort. I pour off most of the starter beer, leaving just enough to swirl and break up the yeast for pitching. Will off flavors be likely to make it to my main batch, or should I have washed the yeast? "
2530,"Repitching yeast on back to back brews, which one first?",I'm brewing two beers back to back so I can reuse some White Labs California Ale (WLP001). One is a basic APA 1.058 OG and the Other is a Scottish Export/80 1.051 OG.  Is there any reason I should brew one before the other as far as the yeast health goes? Will the color of the scottish ale yeast cake affect the pale ale? Should I wash the yeast or just repitch onto the previous batch's yeast cake? 
2531,How quickly do I let the fermentation temperature rise if it starts off too low?,"I brewed something like a Black IPA today (hoppy and dark).  I ferment in carboys in a chest freezer with an external temperature control.  It is frigid today, and the garage where the chest freezer is around 40 degrees F.  My wort seemed to end up at about 64 degrees.  I was planning on fermenting at 68 degrees using WLP001.  I made a large starter, which is at high krausen.  If I picth at 64 degrees, I know that fermentation will make the temperature rise, and its not supposed to be as cold in the next few days.  So I should have no problem getting up to 68 degrees (which is the lower end of the recommendation for this yeast).  My question is that I'm not sure how quickly I should let the temperature rise.  I know that yeast can emit temperature shock proteins if they have too big of a daily temperature swing.  So I'm thinking of letting it get to 66 the first day, then 68 the second day.  Should I instead just let it get up to 68 quicker?  should I ramp it up slower? "
2532,"Secondary Fermentation, Yeast still active?","A little background on the brew: For my latest batch, I followed this recipe from hopville. I made a few alterations: I used a different strain of wyeast (London Ale III), I also used oak chips instead of an oak spiral. The brew store was out of the yeast the recipe called for, and I didn't want to bother ordering an oak spiral as they're sort of expensive.  I transferred from primary to secondary two weeks ago. I added the oak chips, bourbon and cacao nibs to the carboy and siphoned the beer from my primary into the carboy. I was pretty careful and got little of the yeast cake at the bottom of the primary bucket. When I made the transfer from primary to secondary there was very little yeast floating on top.   Two weeks later there is a healthy looking yeast cake at the bottom of the carboy, but it looks like there is still active fermentation. There is a yeast cake floating at the top of the beer. Thus far all fermentation has been done at a cellar temp of about 62 degrees.  On to the question: Is it safe to bottle yet? Or would the yeast be too active and I'd risk exploding bottles? "
2533,Heating Methods,"Just yesterday, I bought a chest freezer and digital Johnson temp controller, and am EXTREMELY psyched.  I think I'm going to make a pre-prohibition pilsner/classic american pilsner as my first lager.  However, as psyched as I am to expand the breadth of my brewing domain, I am realizing that what I love more than anything are ales!    The ambient temp in my basement is around 60 degrees.  I have a cream ale going right now (not in the chest freezer), but in reading ""Brewing Classic Styles"" I am realizing that I will need the freezer to hold a temp ABOVE the ambient temp in the basement to make some of these.    I know there is a separate wiki on temp control, but I wanted to know if anyone had any opinions on the best way to incorporate a heating element without risking barbequeing my dog while he's helpless in his crate due to an electrical fire.  Things like the Brewbelt and the heating pads for inside a freezer make me nervous about fire risk and warping this $100 second-hand freezer I had to muscle down my vertical stairs.    Does anyone have any experience with the best methods/products?  Edit:  I have looked at Brew Belts, Fermwrap, space heaters, and I believe there is a pad heater designed specifically to be put inside chest freezers for homebrewers (?).  Space is a concern, as I had to lobby strongly just to have the chest freezer, otherwise I would be all over the aquarium heater.   "
2534,What will happen to this un-sanitized batch of Wheat beer?,"So my brother-in-law (great guy, btw) sent me a brew kit, ingredients, and instructions. Except the instructions never went over the whole ""sanitation thing""... So, uh oh... I didn't sanitize the fermenting bucket (eek) and then my daughter even came in and threw a dish rag in the waiting 2.5 gallons of water we put the cooled Wort into (Pretty sure it was a clean rag...my wife was folding towel laundry... and the Water didnt look dirty afterwards.. had I known sanitation was such a big deal I would have begun with a fresh and sanitized bucket of water...) Are we screwed? Any predictions? Suggestions? Should I start over?? (Would be a waste wouldn't it?) Oh, and are there any ""watchouts"" to look for after fermentation is over? Smells? Also, is there any dangers of continuing to bottling/drink? Thanks- "
2535,What is a stir plate?,What is the function of a stir plate when making a yeast starter?  Does it drastically improve the starter process? 
2536,Is clarifying while fermenting a problem?,"The all-grain saga continues. I boosted the SG to 1.070 from the OG of 1.030 with cane sugar. 10 days later, the fermentation seems to have stopped and the gravity is 1.040. As mentioned before, the collected wort was very cloudy and I wonder if the specific gravity of the original wort was effected by the suspended solids so that my actual sugar extraction during the mashing process was not as great as indicated by the hydrometer. So, I am considering clarifying the mix and starting over with the fermentation. Will probably have to adjust the pH to get back to a yeast friendly wort.  Will clarifying at this point remove fermentable sugars? My understanding is that clarifying removes suspended solids and not dissolved sugars. Is this true? Will this give me a more accurate gravity measurement/max abv calculation? Should I just clarify and bottle this as a sweet light beer at this point (abv estimated @ 4%) instead of going for the higher abv desired at the start of this batch? "
2537,Premature fermentation of wine must. What to do?,"I recently took delivery of a five gallon pail of white wine juice. Supposedly, the juice had been refrigerated on its trip from California and stored in a cool warehouse here in my home town. However, when it was delivered it was actively fermenting. I don't know what the original gravity was, but the current gravity is around 1.045.   What should I do at this point? I have a packet of Lalvin K1V1116 that I was planning on rehydrating and pitching. Should I pitch this yeast, or is it now too late for to have much effect?  Should I add sulphite to try to knock down the wild yeasts? Or will this just interfere with the yeast I'm pitching?  Should I oxygenate or will that just oxidise the must?  Can this wine be saved, or am I out of luck? "
2538,Very long primary in plastic,"I've just started homebrewing. The guy at the local homebrew store swears that I don't need any secondary fermentors, that I should just leave my brews in the primary to age and then bottle condition them. I have a plastic bucket fermentor and two 5 gallon PET bottles.  I plan to brew some high gravity beers (RIS and an English Barleywine) as well as a dry mead. Since I'm going to be aging a bunch of batches simultaneously I'd rather not spend ~$40/each on glass carboys.  I want to leave them in the primary for 4-6 months, then bottle condition them after that. Is this a bad idea? What's the worst that could happen? "
2539,At what stage of the fermentation process is temperature control most important?,"I've been using a fridge w/thermostat to control fermentation temperature for ~6 months now &amp; have recently started dual-purposing the fridge for a keg as well.  Since serving &amp; fermentation temperatures don't match I can't run them both in the same fridge simultaneously.  In order to maximise beer drinking time, I'd like to aim to regulate fermentation temperatures for the shortest time possible.  At what part of the fermentation process (or any other process really) is temperature control most valuable?  The first hours while yeast gains a foothold?  Conditioning?  The whole lot?  How much ambient temperature fluctuation do I really need to care about? "

It mixed right in perfectly. After flameout French Pressed Sumatra coffee added when wort got down to 190degrees.  My OG was 1.063 at 65degrees and after 11 days its down to 1.017 at 67degrees. The coffee taste is nice, smooth and fresh. Not bitter at all, the french press is definitely the way to go. The chocolate flavor is nice and subtle, but I feel like the original Founder's version has a more upfront chocolate flavor. I'm already loving the taste of this beer, but I feel like when I add the Kona coffee to the secondary in a few days that it may completely mask the chocolate flavor. So I was thinking of adding some more chocolate in the secondary.   I have organic roasted cocoa nibs that I could add about 2oz to the secondary, but what is the best method of sanitizing them? Should I soak them in vodka overnight?  Also has anyone every used cold pressed coffee in their secondary? I figure if I sanitize the french press and use poland spring water, along with the alcohol content of the beer that I shouldn't worry about an infection, but that is still in the back of my mind.  "
2541,Grinding malted rye and rye flakes for all-grain,Do you need to grind flaked rye and malted rye before mashing? Didn't on my first all-grain and I'm not terribly pleased with the lack of extraction. Used the appropriate rests and extra amylase. Ran across a post that Denny did on another site that mentioned grinding malted rye. Is this always necessary? 
2542,Lager krausen won't fall,"I'm brewing my first true lager with White Labs WLP800 and the krausen won't fall. I'm being somewhat impatient because it's taking up primary space right now. I pitched at 44°f and let it rise to 50°f over the first two days and have kept it there since. It has now been 14 days and the krausen is still about an inch thick and the bubbling has slowed to once every 30 seconds. Also I pitched a decanted 4 liter 2 vial starter and oxygenated the wort really well.  I hate taking gravity readings until I'm ready to move to secondary, but is this pace normal for a lager? If so, can I speed it up by bringing up the temperature by 10° or so like a rest, or would it be unnecessary since I have kept it low the whole time? "
2543,Why an all grain stops at 1.030 when there are an abundance of champagne yeast,"I did an all-grain rye for a mash and pitched with Premier Cuvee yeast (tolerant to 18% abv), 5 grams to 4 gal wort. Repitched it again and the forced fermentation test indicates that the mash is done at 1.030. Any ideas/suggestions? Should I check and adjust the pH if it is below 4? "
2544,Weighing Liquid Malt Extract,"In Brewing Classic Styles by Jamil Zainasheff, many of the recipes call for LME.  Often, the amount is 0.5 lbs or similar, particularly of things like Munich extract.  I typically brew all-grain, but my mash tun is currently out-of-commission, so I am doing some extract brews.  Is it really possible to use quantities of LME that are less than a full container?  My brew shop only carres 3.3 lb and 33 lb containers.  My (limited) experience with LME suggests that attempting to separate and weigh it would be an exercise in frustration, since LME is hardly liquid, instead resembling a dense gelatin.    Are these simply not practical recipes for the extract brewer? "
2545,Whirfloc shelf life and use,Making a batch and for the first time the recipe calls for a whirfloc tablet. From what I understand the tablet assists with settling the haze produced by proteins.

2546,What cleaners can I use for Kegs?,"I'm new to kegging, but I was made aware that I shouldn't use sodium metabisulfite when cleaning a keg.  So what cleaners can I use? More specifically, can I use OxyClean or Diversol? "
2547,Safe but effective cleaning solvent for copper,"I'm looking for a better solution for cleaning. Some of my equipment is home from copper which limits agents I can use.  Currently my strategy is using barkeepers friend on all external surfaces such as my sparge arm and mash tun internals, and of course the inside of the kettles.  Once everything is visibly clean I make a 5 gallon mixture of starsan, and circulate it through all my equipment. For the most part this works on everything except my chiller.  I can't really clean the internals of my sparge arm and mash tun filter system but I don't have too much trouble with these and don't worry too much since its before the boil.  I use home made reverse flow tube in tube chiller. Scrubbing surfaces is not an option.  Neither is not using it, because it works really well.  The problem is that cleaning is difficult.  Right now, all I do is a hot star san flush.  Can someone recommend a good aqueous cleaning solution that is cheap and copper safe?  I found some solutions here cleaning copper but I don't think they will work in this situation.  Has anyone used NaOH in very small tinctures?  Instinct says this is a very bad idea, but I happen to have a lot of pure NaOH (long story) and I don't do much with it these days. "
2548,PET Bottle shelf life,"I have my first brew now in the primary and fermenting away for approaching 48 hours now.  I plan to leave it there for 3 weeks rather than risk amateur mistakes for the small benefits secondary offers (if any).  But I'm starting to second guess bottling methods that I will use.  The brewing kit I bought (the bucket etc. not ingredients) came with 40 PET bottles and lids.  I've been reading that while perfectly suitable, they do not lend themselves to long shelf lives - some people seem to be saying 2 months at room temp at best before a noticeable oxidation takes place or max 6 months in the fridge.  Is this right? Not sure I'm going to get through 5 gallons that quick so if this is true, I may think about investing in glass and crown caps before bottling day.  Also, I don't have a fridge big enough to stand 40 bottles upright.  I'm assuming that laid flat is fine (after allowing conditioning at room temp for a while) provided the beer gets a good bit of time upright to settle before opening and pouring to leave any small amounts of sediment in the bottle? "
2549,Why every brew has a bitter malty aftertaste?,"Every of 5 previous brews (lager, pilsner, pale ale, IPA) have had a somewhat bitter and malty aftertaste to them. It's not too off-putting (except the lager) but is clearly there, yet not present on your tongue until swallowed (mostly aftertaste). What would cause a beer to have this quality?  5G brews. All liquid malt extracts. Different hop variations. VERY clean during brewing. Water is grocery store spring+distilled. Sugar/powdered(?) for carbonation before bottling. Dark bottles in closet 70-78d. Most have been nicely carbonated, slightly under ABV. Most the time a US-05 yeast is used. The temperature of fermentation have been slightly higher in the 70-78d range. Have done both 1 and 2nd fermentation rounds. Most fermentation times are 2-4 weeks plus 10-14 days in bottles. Nothing out of the ordinary for small-time brewers. "
2550,How do I limit the amount of sediment in bottles?,"I recently made my second batch of beer.  It's a pumpkin ale.  I am finding that the bottles contain a large amount of sediment, almost like slush at the bottom the bottle.  The beer is delicious, but I'm wondering how I can prevent this in the future.  My first batch of beer was the White House Honey Ale and those were pretty much sediment free.  What influences the amount of sediment?  Should I be ""filtering"" at some point in the process? "
2551,Can I add hops and sugar to fermenting beer?,just would like to know if its possible to brew a beer over multiple weeks.I was thinking of brewing my next beer by adding a different hop every week for 3-4 weeks.And at each time adding more sugar and thus adding some more yeast to eat the new sugar added to produce a lil more alcohol each time.Is this  possible?? 
2552,Culturing Yeast and Bacteria from Pulque,"I'm interested in making pulque, and was wondering how to go about culturing the yeast and bacteria necessary for making it from an existing batch.

What are best practices for reducing the chance of infection and ensuring a good batch?  Thanks!! "
2553,Rhubarb wine colour lost after additives introduced,"I'm making an Rhubarb wine. It's been 'dry sugared' for 3 days and the extracted syrup had a nice pink hue from the pink Rhubarb stems.  Yesterday evening I made the volume up to 5 litres and the pink hue remained. I mixed up 1tsp Pectic Enzyme, 1tsp Yeast Nutrient, and one crushed Campden tablet and stirred this in with a little water. As soon as I added these chemicals, the pink hue started to disappear, and within another 30 seconds of stirring, the diluted juice was just an off-white colour.  Any ideas what killed the colour? I'll be pitching the yeast this evening after a good aeration.  Update 11th May: Last night I pitched the yeast. This morning it's fermenting well and a pinkish-orange hue has returned. This makes me wonder if the colour-loss was due to the Yeast Nutrient and now that's being consumed, the effects are negated? Complete speculation! "
2554,Bourbon soaked wood chips in secondary,"Making a wee heavy and adding medium toasted oak chips that have been soaked in bourbon.  The chips are tied up in a cheese cloth bag. My question is, should I let the chips dry thoroughly before dropping into the carboy? Or should I add them when they're still moist with bourbon?   Thanks in advance...cheers! "
2555,DIY Fermentation Chamber. Dual Zone Question,"I am building a fermentation chamber and I was wondering if there is a way to have two zones but only use one cooler?  My thinking is have two of everything except the cooler. So there would be controller 1 heat 1 and a relay, then controller 2 heat 2 and the same relay. The relay would be plugged into the cooler. If either chamber was to hot the cooler would come on for both if that brought the other chamber down to cold then the heater would come on for just that chamber. Would this work or am I thinking it? "
2556,Poor hop aroma for late addition hops,"My boil kettle is about 56x85cm, so relatively tall and narrow. I get a good rolling boil but no matter how much hops I throw in in the last 5 minutes I can never seem to get any aroma whatsoever. I'm using a very large fine-meshed filter bag to through the hops into. Could the poor hop utilisation be due to the kettle shape and size, or more likely the hop back (bittering is fine)? Or otherwise, any other ideas? Thanks. "
2557,How long to wait to bottle after adding sulfites?,"When adding sulfites to a wine, mead, or cider prior to bottling for oxidation prevention, how long should you wait after adding the sulfites before transferring to bottles? Is there a set amount of time, or are you pretty much good to go immediately?  Note, this is not a question about stabilizing. "
2558,Beer gets mixed up when siphoning into container just before bottling,"When preparing to bottle a cerveza style beer (from a kit), I moved my beer into the primary fermenter so that I could mix in some sugary water before bottling to make my beer bubbly. The beer had been especially cloudy since it was in the primary fermenter but had cleared significantly. As I siphoned my beer I noticed clumps rising to the surface, falling down, and disintegrating into the beer. Overall the beer is getting super cloudy again. I did mange to eliminate some sediment at the bottom but I feel that it is not up to my regular standards. Should I go ahead and bottle or let it settle once again before bottling?  Also I wonder what could cause this. I believe I had left the beer in the secondary fermenter for a full 3 weeks, often I procrastinate/ am too busy to go ahead and i leave it longer but I understand 3 weeks in the secondary should be sufficient. Am I right on that? Is this something to do with Cervezas?  "
2559,My ingredient quantities seem a bit off,"Planning a new extract brew. I'm normally one to wing the quantities a bit but as I'm attempting a higher-than-average ABV this time round I've put together a recipe using the Brewers' Friend recipe calculator. I know it's not 100% accurate but in terms of making sure I have enough fermentables and bittering hops it's certainly better than me.  Recipe is as follows:-  23L batch. 10L boil.  5kg light liquid malt extract  Bittering:  100g Apollo hops - 60min boil - 19% AA  Flavouring  75g Dr Rudi hops - 30min boil - 11.7% AA  25g El Dorado hops - 30min boil - 14.1% AA  Aroma  25g Dr Rudi hops - 15min boil - 11.7% AA  75g El Dorado hops - 15min boil - 14.1% AA  Will be fermenting with Safbrew S-33 yeast (for high(er) ABV beers)  Predicted properties  Original Gravity: 1.063. Final Gravity: 1.012. ABV: 6.75%. IBU: 150.84.  In my limited brewing experience, 300g of hops seems a lot. How trustworthy is this recipe builder?  Another side question - would using bottle mineral water have a noticeable impact on the flavour of the final product? "
2560,How will this beer turn out?,"I brewed my first all grain beer on Sunday; everything went well barring one leaky tap and a slight blockage on the tap in my kettle due to a poor hop filter. It is supposed be an IPA style beer using all Maris otte pale malt with Columbus, citra and pioneer hops. The yeast I used was danstar nottingham. OG was 1055  I live in an apartment in the UK and struggle to drop the temp below 24 celcius (75F). Because I know the optimum temp for nottingham is below 21C (70F) I added a wet T-shirt over the beer to keep it cool. When I did my first gravity check after the first day (fermentation looked very vigorous) I found that the temp was still up at 24C and the gravity has already dropped to 1019! Since then I have dropped it into a nice bath with the wet shirt wicking up the water but I'm worried that I'll get a huge number of bad flavours and 'hotness' from all of the fusel alcohols etc associated with hot fermentation.   Is there any way to counteract this? I understand that time fixes these problems but I was hoping to have a good idea of how this recipe works so I can refine it in my next brew, if I can't taste it properly I might have to wing the next brew.  I am planning to dry hop and wondered if this would remove any of the nastiness?  Because the beer I am brewing is so floraly and citrusy a lot of the mango etc off flavours mith actually be useful, it's mainly the hotness I want to remove.  And in terms of moving forward, I am going to struggle to maintain the temperature with any brew that I do due to lack of space for a chest freezer. Because of this I will probably try to move on to darker beers in the future. Can you guys recomend any Yeats strains that work nicely at higher temperatures that would work for a red ale?  Thanks,  Jacob. "
2561,What are the simple things i should be careful about (like bleach) for my first time brewing?,I'm planning to make my first batch within the next couple of days and was checking what all thing i should not OVERDO (like bleach sanitation).  Should i be careful before i cap my bottle (i don't want it to explode) ?? i was guessing most of you ll have something from experience which i'll mostly not give much attention . Thanks in advance   
2562,What's wrong with my gravity?,"I recently brewed an Imperial Red. It clocked in at around 1.072 on original gravity reading.  My malt bill looked something like this: 12 lbs 5.0 oz   Pale Malt (2 Row) US (2.0 SRM) 11 lbs Marris Otter (2.0 SRM) 2 lbs 9.6 oz    Caraamber (30.0 SRM) 1 lbs 15.1 oz   Cara-Pils/Dextrine (2.0 SRM) 1 lbs 15.1 oz   Munich Malt (9.0 SRM) 1 lbs 15.1 oz   Wheat, Flaked (1.6 SRM) 1 lbs 11.8 oz   Caramel/Crystal Malt - 60L (60.0 SRM) 11.2 oz Special B Malt (180.0 SRM)    Yeastex and Whirfloc at the recommended dosages for good measure.  I performed a 65 minute single mash. I mashed in at around 165 F and the mash rest occurred at around 155 F. I was able to extract nearly 5 gallons of wort. I batch sparged at 178 F, and the batch rest occurred for about 15 minutes.  The boil was 60 minutes with a very healthy hop schedule.  I copper coil chilled to about 78 F before pitching two vials of White Labs California Ale yeast. No starter. The first phase of fermentation occurred the way it usually does. There was a nice bubble in the airlock, with a solid couple inches of trub. 17 days have passed. I checked the gravity for the first time and the hydrometer measured 1.040.   This has me a bit concerned. I am still fairly novice to the all-grain game. I know but am not certain that big Crystal malts carry a lot of complex sugars that take the yeast extended periods of time to act on (Disachharides?). Did I mash too hot? Did I use too much Crystal? Why are the yeast responding so poorly to what would otherwise be considered a healthy brew? I am worried that the FG won't sink below 1.030 (this happened a month ago with a slightly different recipe). Would it be heinous to boil up some belgian candy and introduce it to the fermenting device to get the gravity low enough to bottle?  Thank you for all your advice. "
2563,Fermentation Temperature,"I have a quick question. I've been looking for an answer, but didn't find a clear answer.  So, I'm making an IPA. Right now the air temperature in my closet where I keep the carboy is 67-68F. This is what I should have according to the yeast profile. However, the fermometer (tape on the carboy) reads at 72F. That is understandable, because yeast are doing their work like crazy, which increases the temperature of the wort...   Should I be worried? Should I move my carboy to a keezer (with temp control) and force the temperature of the wort to get down to 67-68F by lowering the environment temperature to 60-62F?  Thanks.  "
2564,"Blending beer DURING fermentation, in the hopes to get beer back in balance with hops","I brewed an IPA intended to blow my hop socks off and missed my target OG by 20 points.  DETAILS: Built this recipe in BeerSmith with an intended OG of 1.070 and IBU projected at 156. I pitched a 1000 ml starter of 001 right at the peak of action and my 4+ gallons are fermenting to the point my fermentation chamber cant stop it from climbing above 71, I like to ferment my IPA at 64 and havent had a problem keeping it close to that in the past.   QUESTION: It's been 3 days and the temp looks like it has peaked, if I brew a one gallon batch and top it off at this point will the yeast still be able to clean up the warm fermentation flavors? Is there something else I should be concerned about when trying this? has anyone had experience with this "
2565,Is it safe to drill into the side of a fridge?,"I want to transform a compressor wine fridge into a kegerator. I wanted to know where it would be safe to drill holes, either in the side or the top? There is no freezer section, and the back of the fridge is a snake of coils. Does this tell me anything? "
2566,How do I remove the medicinal taste of vanilla extract in my beer?,"I bought a natural vanilla extract (vanilla beans, alcohol, and water) to add to my beer at bottling time.  I mixed it along with my carbing sugar and bottled.  When I tried the beer for the first time, there was a heavy ""medicinal"" taste to it.  (It didn't come from the base beer because I bottled some without the vanilla and it tastes fine).  Is there a way to remove the alcohol from an extract prior adding to beer?  Would it have been better to add the extract to the boil? (I was hoping to get some vanilla aroma by adding it at bottling)  Does anyone have any experience with this? "
2567,IBU calculation for blended worts / braggott,"community!   I recently found that my calculations of IBUs are not always accurate... Especially when I was making a Braggot. Maybe someone can help me out with the formula or something?   I made a 5 gallon batch of IPA braggot.   I boiled 2.5 gallons of extract with a extract method (3lbs of extract, 12oz stepping grains, Hops at 60, 30, 15 and 1 mins).   At the end I blended it with a 2.5 gallons of mead must making total 5 gallons with OG=1.072. Not bad for an IPA. However, I'm not sure if it will be bitter enough...  So, here's a two batches:  1.   V = 2.5g,  OG = 1.048,  IBU = 158. 2.   V = 2.5g,  OG = 1.101,  IBU = 0. ------------------------------------------- 1+2. V = 5g,    OG = 1.072,  IBU = ?    What would the IBU be?  PS. Fermentation was complete yesterday at 1.014. I will dry-hop it with 3 oz of something citrusy and floral.  Thanks. "

2569,Heating after fermentation?,What's the general consensus on leaving a heat source turned on after fermentation has complete?  I'm doing an Imperial IPA which should finish fermenting in 4-5 days going by previous experience with the yeast. I'm then going to leave it in the primary for 10-14 days for conditioning and possible dry hopping towards the end.  Is it best to leave my brewing mat turned on for the entire period or to turn it off once fermentation has completed?  I'm inclined to say yes... consistent temperature is always a good thing when dealing with yeast. Am I correct?  Thanks!  
2570,Sweetening a tart fruit beer?,"So I'm doing a first attempt at a Blackberry Wheat beer, per a request from a co-worker. All seems to be fine and good, however before I went to bottle I tasted it and, not unexpectedly, it is a little tart. I've noticed this before when I've done Hard Ciders or other fruit beers with strong tastes like Raspberries.  I was thinking of racking to another bucket with some Splenda to try and sweeten it up (Splenda is mostly maltodextrine, to my knowledge, so it's not ferment-able), but does anyone have suggestions on how to go about do this? I'd rather not make the mistake of making it 'too' sweet. I was going to try 10 packets for 5 gallons and then rerack again as necessary. Does this sound out of line? "
2571,Does yeast type affect wine taste..?,"I'm new in wine making and I tried to make it with fresh yeast, not dried. I think I'm using a lot of it to help fermentation end faster. Will this affect the taste of wine? Will dries yeast achieve a better taste or not ? Also I want to know if anyone has tried wild yeast fermentation before....wild yeast is present naturally on the grape skin so you don't have to use yeast at all, but it believe it takes a long time to ferment "
2572,Carbonation process - Using the carboy,"I've been homebrewing for a few months now (it's now my 15th liter!) and i was thinking about making my beer clearer/better.  The best thing i could come up with, in my homebrew gear, was trying to carbonate inside the carboy?  Currently, my process is : first fermentation in the carboy, carbonation in bottle.  I wondered if i could close the carboy with a plug, and simply bottle it when carbonation is done; but i've read that the carboy could explode (!!!).  So; is it a good or bad idea? Otherwise i thought of carbonating in the carboy, but with a plug that would pop if the the pressure was was too much, and just bottle them when it does.  Any advices ? thanks! "
2573,Ginger bug does not produce enough carbonation,"I am using the following recipe to grow an active ginger bug:  2 cups bottled water 2 tbsp grated organic ginger 2 tbs refined sugar  Each day I add 2 tbsp ginger and 2 tbsp sugar to the mix. I wash all my utensils with bottled water before using. I use a plastic spoon for stirring. Temperature ranges between 22 C and 28 C.  After 24h the bug is showing signs of fizziness, but only small bubbles. This doesn’t change significantly after 48h. After 72h it goes flat and if I keep feeding it will eventually develop a slight film of mold on top.   If, however I start brewing the ale after 48h have passed (for syrup I use 2L water, 54g ginger, 273g sugar, 3 lemons, brought to room temp and mixed with 100g ginger bug liquid) it will not develop enough carbonation after 3rd day of bottling. It does have some fizziness but it’s not near to making a “pop” sound when the bottle is opened or have proper carbonation when poured in a glass. The liquid also seems sweet enough, so I would say it is probably not a case of all of it being eaten away by the bug in the ale.  I have tried numerous times and the outcome is the same: either flat bug by day 3 OR not enough carbonation if I use the bug on day 2 for making ale.  What am I doing wrong? Can anyone please help? I have read all sorts of advice and tried to mitigate sources of error having to do with ingredients, so I can’t tell what it is that I’m doing wrong, especially because everyone says this is the easiest recipe to get right :) "
2574,Kegging time for beer under pressure or not?,"I want to keg my latest stout.  If I plan to have it in the keg  for a few weeks before a party,  do I need to put pressure on it  or not?

I just am not sure about storing it under pressure or not.  Also  this beer will be in a garage at temps around 60 F   until I cool it down in my fridge. I'm kinda new at kegging..

2577,STC 1000 safety,"sorry if this is a question that’s been answered already. I’ve just completed a brew for a Belgian saison using wyeast 3724 and I’ve suffered the all to common stall that this yeast so often experiences. As the ambient temp in my home is circa 19c, I decided to try and kickstart the yeast back into action by raising the temp (this yeast is happier in the late 20s and up to 32 according to wyeast site).   So I invested in a mangrove jacks heat pad as well as their dual temp controller (which is simply and branded stc 1000).   My question is twofold (I’m not an electrician and don’t profess to know anything about how it works):  1 - as I’m looking to get the temp initially to about 25 or 26c and hold it there, I won’t need a cooling aspect (i.e. fridge) as the room will slowly bring the temp down and the hysteresis setting will see to it that it doesn’t drop far. But is it okay / safe to just leave the cooling socket empty? I.e. the controller won’t burn itself out trying to drive something that’s not there? (I accept this might be a really stupid question)  2 - with the ambient room temp at 19 and a target of 25 or 26c, the heat pad is probably going to be put through its paces and spend quite a decent amount of time switched on and heating (it’s currently been on for 6 hours straight which is what it’s taken to heat my brew from 21 to 24c). It’s a 25w pad. Anyone know if these are robust enough to just hook up to the stc 1000 and leave them to do their thing like that? "
2578,"What caused my wort to be this cloudy, and how can I get it to clear?","I recently did two experimental all-grain gluten-free batches, and got some strange results; so much sediment that it looks like milk! Initially, looked about the same, and I thought about running through a filter, but decided to see if it would settle at all. After 5 days, this was the result. These do not have yeast in them, as I decided that I might filter and re-boil.  To the left is Batch 2, the shorter mash with the longer cereal cooking step which looks like rice-milk with only an inch or so clear at the top, to the right is Batch 1, which was the over-night mash. It looks almost normal now, but the trub layer is thicker than what I am used to seeing come straight out of a kettle... (Albeit this is only my third all-grain brew...)   My questing is what could have caused these (especially batch 2) to be so ridiculously cloudy?  I am guessing this might simply be small flour particles, but then why would batch 1 be clear of them? Is it possible the higher temp of cooking in Batch 2 extracted more protien? Is that related to the high gravity reading?  Perhaps my temperature control temperature on batch 2 was lacking, or the enzymes are not as potent as stated and failed to achieve complete conversion of starch? Could this result in cloudy wort? Why would the gravity reading be the same then?  A second question would be how on earth can I filter this? A coffee filter would surely just clog right up, and this stuff is so small it can go right through a fine mesh bag like it's nothing. Is there any practical way to filter these?  Is it possible that after fermenting, the whole thing would settle out somehow? Maybe it just needs more time? Like months?  -Details- For any possible relevant details I can think of... Here's the whole process. (These are 1 gallon batches.) 10 oz white rice 13 oz millet  Grains were not malted.  Ground in a bur grinder set to it's most course setting, which resulting in a mix of particle sizes from what looks about corn-meal size down to very fine flour.  2L of 'strike' water was used. (About 1.5 qt / lbs) In both cases, the mash became thick and hard to stir before enzyme was added, and thinned very quickly afterward.  The enzymes are SEBAMYL BAL and SEBAMYL L. According to the seller, they are best used together in a ""Reverse Step Mash"", adding BAL first at 165, then adding L later at 145.  The mash is where the two experiments diverge.  Batch 1: Kettle on stove, keeping burner on very low to maintain temp. Raise temp to 185 F, stir and cook for 20 minutes. Wait for temp to lower temp to 165F, then add first enzyme. After 60 minutes, lower temp to 145 F and add second enzyme. I started doing did iodine tests after an hour, and after 2 hours still had indications of starch. I decided to let it go overnight, using an oven to hold it near 145. Iodine test still turned purple. Wort looked thin and tasted sweet though, so I decided to continue anyway.  Batch 2 was done in an InstantPot pressure cooker, generally leaving heat off and relying on it's insulation to keep temp. Same grain &amp; water etc. Cook at 212 for 30 minutes, stirring constantly.  Cool to 155, then slowly raise to 165. (To help ensure temp reading is correct.) Added first enzyme and leave for an hour. Cool to 145, add second enzyme, and hold for 2 hours.  This also failed the iodine test, turning dark purple immediately. I figured the iodine test might be picking up flour particles, so I decided to ignore it and call the mash done.  The 'sparge' step was the same for each. It was just me pouring a measured amount of warm water over the grains as they sat in a nylon mesh bag over a pot. This was done to help recover some of the sugars that would otherwise be lost between the grains.  After this, I took gravity readings of each using a hydrometer. Samples were taken from each kettle and cooled to 68F (the hydro's calibrated temp.) Both read 1.045, which is really weird to me, because I was expecting 23 oz of grain to yeild at most 1.025, of sugars...  Added hops (pellet, but kept in muslin cloth bag), boiled both for 60 minutes, added about 1/4 tablet of whirlfloc in the last 10 minutes, chilled with immersion chiller, then racked. I did not add yeast, because I immediately noticed that they were both way too cloudy. "
2579,Why do very dark roasted malts have such a high steeping yield?,"According to Palmer's popular list of typical mashing and steeping yields, pale crystal malt (25-40L) has a typical steeping yield of 22 PPG. Slightly darker crystal malt (medium, 60-75L) weighs in at 18 PPG when steeped, and dark crystal (120L) at 16 PPG. Fine, that makes sense: darker crystal malts have lower steeping yields, consistent with how they behave when mashed.  But then we get to roasted barley and black patent malt, which both have a much lower yield when mashed, but are both listed as having typical steeping yields of 21 PPG.  What causes this apparent anomaly? I.e. why do these very dark malts have a lower mash yield but a higher steeping yield than crystal malts? "
2580,Question about Ginger Bug,"I'm very new to brewing and also fermentation and I'm really confused when I start fermenting my ginger bug. I don't know when to screw my bottle tight and when to put a cheese cloth on top of the bottle and when to use airlock during the brewing process.   I guess..  To put cheese cloth during first fermentation so I can capture more wild yeast into the bottle? But then if it start bubbling, the bubble will go away. Also it is suggested I shake the bottle every day, do I put the lid on, shake it and switch it back to cheese cloth?  To screw the bottle tight in 2nd fermentation is to keep the Co2 in the bottle to make the drink fizzy.  To use airlock is when you try to brew alcohol beverage and you will feed more sugar to the yeast and it will be a longer fermentation, using airlock will let Co2 escape the bottle safely.  So am I right?   But I see people using airlock during first fermentation and some people make fruit yeast water in a tightly screwed jar, so I got confused. I hope someone can help me to understand. Thank you very much. "
2581,Bread Kvass Safety Concerns,"My first brewing experience is gonna be bread Kwass (following this recipe). Now, I browsed a bit to get some info, and I only managed to get terrified. There are three concerns that I would like you to help me with, if possible.   What do I have to do in order to avoid a dangerous amount of methanol in the end-product. About botulism: How do I avoid clostridium botulinum to germinate during the fermentation process (and kill everyone)? If the bread was not super fresh (a few days old, but no fungus on it), does it increase its chances of appearing? I am planning to use a Fido bottle for the fermentation process. How often shall I ""burp"" it in order for it to not explode?   Thank you very much for your help. "
2582,Finicky Wyeast 3724 Stall,"Looking for some useful suggestions. I’m a veritable noob when it comes to brewing. I’m on my second brew and already trying to experiment with my own recipe albeit sticking to extract / specialty grains.   Trying to do a saison style beer and landed on Wyeast 3724 for my chosen yeast. Brew went relatively straightforward and hit my target OG on the nose @ 1.062.   Into 5gal glass carboy for primary, pitched yeast and fitted blow off tube. A day in and super glad I used a blowoff as kreusen to the brim and into the tube.   6 days into fermentation and activity completely ceased. Took a sample and OG only dropped 20 points to 1.042.   Now I’ve since read about problems that come with this yeast and that it is know to start vigorously and stall out around this point sometimes for weeks and weeks.   I also didn’t know about the high temps need for the yeast so the first week was done at 18c. At day 8 or 9 I ramped temps to 27c and held it there since. Now 16 days in and things are moving painfully slow. I’m in no rush but keep second guessing it and thinking I should dump and start again, perhaps with 3711 instead.   I don’t want to pitch another yeast (but would use US05 if I did). So aside from the temp increase I’m thinking I could rouse the yeast some way.   That’s where my question comes in - any suggestions about how to rouse it? I can’t give the FV much movement as the kreusen really caked onto the glass and I don’t want any of that to mix back into the wort.  Is there anything else I could try?  If it helps, recipe was:  8lbs extra light DME 1.25lbs Crystal 20L 1lb clear Belgian Candi sugar  Steeped crystal for 30 mins @ 160f  60 min boil of 3gal topped off with water to make 5gal total in FV.

2583,Microbial interactions: biotransformations and food/drink science,"I am looking for a good, in-depth source on biotransformations (think food science). For example, fermenting black tea and sugar with wild yeast and bacteria (kombucha):   Wild yeast ferment sucrose into ethanol Bacteria (in the presence of oxygen) convert that ethanol to acetic acid (sours the solution and lowers pH)   This is a transformation of sucrose into acetic acid through the use of yeast and bacteria (but which ones?). Or:   Malting grain causes production of enzymes that later break down starch into sugar Mashing crushed grain allows starch extraction and conversion (by these enzymes) to (fermentable) sugars such as maltrose, dextrose, sucrose, etc.   I'm interested in what enzymes are produced by which grains, and how they convert starches and in what temperature ranges.  I want to study these types of biotransformations, including how varieties of yeast and bacteria make these transformations (i.e. bacteria converting ethanol to acetic acid only when oxygen is present). This means details on yeast, bacteria, and how they interact with one another in transformations of molecules (thus aromatic/flavor compounds, production of alcohol and acids, etc.).  Is there an authoritative (or close to it) source on the micro-level biotransformations that occur during fermentation? I only know what I know from reading online about brewing kombucha and beer; sources seem to just say ""this happens when this"", but without explanations as to what is doing what, which is what I want to know more about!  Super bonus points if there's a sort of almanac of common brewing ingredients. For example, breakdown of various malts and their enzyme content, adjuncts such as herbs/spices and their chemical makeup (e.g. linalool, citronellol, etc.), the like. I find the micro-level of fermentation fascinating, and I'd like to finally learn how to balance the bitterness of my hibiscus saison by taking advantage of microbes or a change in the preparation of ingredients/fermentation.  I just found an amazing example of the genre of information I'm looking for on Chemistry.SE. It talks about the use of lemon juice in cooking with fish, and the reason why so many recipes use lemon juice. There is a chemical reason for adding lemon juice, and it's fascinating to see those molecules interact to change a dish. I'd love to have this kind of information, but for beer. "

In this community wiki, we learn that by putting foil over the top of bottles and baking them for 60 minutes at 340, we will sterilize bottles. Another mention credits Palmer.  So, given sufficiently baked bottles with aluminum foil tops, the consensus is that the bottles may be stored indefinitely without the need to immerse in a sanitizing solution before filling.    This question is about how long to trust an alternate technique: whole box baking.  Beer cases are prepared with a clean paper towel on the bottom of the case (so any debris in the bottom of the case doesn't come into contact with the bottle).  Cleaned and rinsed bottles are placed into the case upside down (inverted).  The entire box is placed into a 170 degree oven until the glass gets to at least 170 degrees for one hour [[website]Now the entire box is removed from the oven and stored in a climate controlled environment (my closet), and left undisturbed.  How long will the bottles remain clean enough to fill without immersing in sanitizing solution?  Is this technique as effective as the aluminum foil technique, so allowing the bottles to be filled without further sanitizing no matter how much time passes? "
2585,Combining Autumn Ale and Apfelwein,"I’d like to brew a spiced Autumn Ale, but somehow also combine it with Apfelwein. Can this be done? Sort of, a bastardized version of Graf (Graaf / Graff) Recipe I have calls for adding “pure apple flavor” during priming, and I thought, hey, WTF, maybe use a Apfelwein, instead? Any other way come to anyone’s mind? Could this be done during fermentation? Could you add something already fermented with a considerable ABV to an ale still in fermentation?  "
2586,Can a Ginger Bug fermentation turn into Vinegar,"I have fermented Ginger bug for 15days, feed it daily with additional Ginger and sugar, then stopped feeding  further and kept it as it is for 5 days. Now I have refrigerated it.  I must say that whenever I make a lemon drink from this bug, I do feel  intoxicated 😳  I want to know if this Ginger bug can turn into Vinegar if fermented for a long period, and keeping it unrefrigerated (in air tight jar). does that happen with Ginger bugs??? Thanks "
2587,How to recover from failed carbonation?,"Beer (extract-based English bitter) has been in bottles for 3 weeks at cellar temperature (~60-70 F) with very little carbonation occurring.   I can think of a few things I might have screwed up to get here:   Under-primed. I used the low end of the recommended amount of corn sugar because I do want this to be only lightly carbonated. Old caps. Some of the caps I used were a few years old. Possibly they couldn't hold the pressure (but the plastic liners didn't seem any stiffer than the ones on some new caps I have). Didn't allow my bottles to dry sufficiently after sanitizing in bleach solution and killed the yeast.   I'm thinking I'll have to pour all this beer out back into my fermentation bucket and let it sit for 24 hours to de-chlorinate. Then re-prime and re-bottle with new caps.   Is there any easier way to recover from this problem? Is there any other possible cause of the problem I didn't think of?  Update two weeks later:    It seems that some bottles have better carbonation than others. I guess this points to I might not have mixed the priming sugar syrup into the wort well enough before bottling. There is enough carbonation in most bottles to cause some dramatic foaming if you drop in a carbonation drop. After adding carbonation drops to a couple of bottles and waiting another week, there is still not much carbonation there (but maybe this is due to increased headspace in the bottles after adding the carbonation drops).  "
2588,How long does clarification take given a refrigerator temperature level cold crash?,"In this question defining cold crashing, there is some discussion of ramping the temperature down slowly over a long time, but then says quicker cold crashing is possible if the beer has already completed fermentation.  In this question, I'd like to explore an appropriate, quick, and effective cold crash technique on an ale that's had plenty of time to ferment and ""clean-up"".  And for this example, the purpose of cold crashing is primarily for settling.  Given the carboy is in a refrigerator which is turned on normally (no external temperature control), it will take some time for the heat to be removed from the volume of beer.  If the beer started at, say, 68F, with the refrigerator ""on"", there would be a ramp down, and within 6 hours, the beer would be at, say, 40F.  Then you'd wait Y hours as settling continued.  What range of Y would you expect 50% of the eventual settling to be done?  What range of Z would you expect 90% of the settling to be done?  Note that in this diagram, I have assumed that settling happens faster earlier, and slower later.  This may or may not be your experience (could be linear).  The blue line is the temperature of the beer.  The black line is the amount of settling over time, starting at no cold crash settling and ending when 90% of the eventual possible settling is done.   "
2589,"There is a white film on the top of my bottled beer, what is it?","We brewed beer (Double IPA) for the first time, and we bottled the beer 1 week ago.  Now when I look at all my bottles, they all have that white film on the top and I was wondering what it could be?  Is it something temporary, or an ingfection? Here's a photo, hard to take a good photo, I hope you'll see what I mean.  Thanks!  EDIT: As asked by Scott, here's a quick run down of sanitation on bottling day:   We first washed the bottles with that pink powder soap, then rinsed We sanitised all the equipment with ""Aseptox"", as well as the table on which stuff was on We boiled water with the dextrose in it, then let it cool down before adding it to the beer the caps were in a sanitized solution Bottles were sanitised before filling them    "
2590,"Poor efficiency during first all grain brew, need an fail safe for next brew","For my first all grain brew I bought an octoberfest all grain kit from morebeer. Before brewing with it, however, I decided to try a very cheap smash recipe. I ended up with a very low efficiency (about 65 percent), and threw in some DME I had on hand to try and raise my gravity by a few points.  I'd like to brew again in the coming weekend, and while I've made notes on how I can increase my efficiency, I'd like to have a backup plan to turn it into a partial mash if need be.  When correcting for a poor mash, how do you decide what grade of DME to get? I'm assuming its based of SRM, so an SRM of 10 would probably mean an amber DME. Im also assuming I should introduce it right after I've collected and measure my wort? "
2591,Trying a gluten free kit; must I buy new equipment to be safe?,"I just ordered a gluten free kit to brew for a friend of mine who has celiac disease. I have a glass carboy, but another home brewer recommended I start with completely new equipment. Is that necessary? I don't mind getting hoses and things like that, but should I buy a new carboy and new bottles as well? "
2592,Why am I getting foam in my keg line when dispensing?,"I have a two-tap kegerator which I use to dispense commercial 5-gallon kegs.  My lines are about 3 feet long1 and I keep my pressure at 10psi and my temperature relatively cold.  Whenever I draw from the tap, I get beer immediately.  It looks like a great pour.  But always, about half a second after opening the valve, the beer coming out turns foamy for about a second and then returns to normal.  This produces enough head that my glass always ends up being half foam.  If I have a pitcher that I'm filling, or if I have two glasses and I can run the pour from one to the other, the rest of the pour will be excellent with no foam.  Why does this happen?  I have always had this problem with my setup.  I used to keep my pressure at 15psi and dropped it to 10psi (and I like it - I think I'll end up on 11-12psi).  But that hasn't helped this problem at all.  I also tried lowering the temperature on the kegerator.  This also hasn't helped.  These are things that I feel are just general tips to try to reduce foam.  But I feel like there's something specifically wrong with my setup where air is getting in the line somehow.  This problem happens on both taps.  This problem happens no matter what keg I hook up.  I have used Kegcraft kegs from Half Acre Chicago, as well as commercial kegs from various craft brewers available in Chicago.  They all have the problem.  This problem has persisted across CO2 tanks as well.  I'm using Perlick 525SS tap handles.  Am I missing an O-ring somewhere?  How can I test this?  I'm sick of having this problem!  1Edit:  I estimated three feet when I wrote the question.  The line is perhaps actually four, maybe four and a half feet.  They came as part of a kit, and I did not cut them.  I don't know exactly how long they are, but they are sufficient length to change kegs, clean, and otherwise maintain the set. "
2593,Lost my grommet in the fermenter - what to do?,"Brewed a nice RyePA last weekend and I just opened the fermentation chamber to find the airlock not bubbling. A quick peek at the wort confirmed a nice krausen in place. I pulled the airlock and noticed the grommet wasn't seated completely and in my effort to fix it, it fell in the beer. So what to do now?  It feels as though I should leave the grommet and take my chances given it was sanitized a few days ago. Second question - I don't have another grommet on hand so at the moment the airlock is seated tight against the lid. Thoughts on how to handle that? "
2594,"First time making cider, will it work well","I decided to try experiment after reading a little about making cider. I used a 1/2 gallon of cider, made sure there were no preservatives. Warmed it in a pot with about a cup of brown sugar and a full pack of yeast (just cheap stuff I had left from Baking). Put it in a gallon jug and made an airlock with rubber tubing and a plastic cup of water. Everything is air tight and it has been bubbling for 3 days. I know it has a few weeks left. My question is  1. Will it be drinkable? 2. would this be considered Wine? 3. any red flags I should watch for? "
2595,What vessels to use to carbonate hard cider?,"I'm currently fermening my first batch of apple wine, with the plan to make sparkling cider. My idea is to make sure that the first fermentation has stopped, rack the cider, put it into bottles and add a small amount of sugar to creat the CO2.  Now, my question is: What bottles can I use? How can I close them (so they withstand the pressure)? What's the pressure I can allow? I think I can calculate the amount of sugar from headspace and cider volume, when I know the correct partial pressure of CO2.  I have beer and wine bottles available, and could maybe score champagne bottles. I don't have tools to put stoppers on them and would appreciate hints on how to do it without buying much equipment. "
2596,Using juice as bottling sugar,"So, I have brewed a big batch of kombucha. Normally, the original gravity is 1.020.  But this time, I created a 1.016 batch.  After nine days, the gravity went to 1.014 and the pH to 3.4.  The kombucha organisms which produce acetic acid, the collagen? scoby, and carbonation leave a lot of residual sugar.  So, as an experiment, I am adding brett to eat that sugar.  I moved it into secondary fermentation and added Brett Trois.  When that is done, I will then bottle it.  I used a bottling calculator as follows:     Amount Being Packaged:  3 g / 11.3562 l      Volumes of CO2:         3.0      Temperature of Beer:    75F / 23.8889C      CO2 in Beer:            0.78 volumes      Priming Table Sugar:    3.6 oz / 100.9 g   Instead of using sucrose for the bottling sugar, I want to add 32 ounces of Just Tart Cherry juice.  With a total of four servings which lists 24 grams of sugars per serving.  That should total 96 grams.  Will the cherry juice successfully bottle condition this batch? "
2597,"What is Responsible for the Dissipation of Krausen, and may a Batch be Bottled if its Krausen has Not been Dissipated?","This picture contains two extract batches made on two successive days approximately two weeks ago.     One is a Honey Weizen (OG=1.048; Wyeast 1010 American Wheat Yeast), and the other is a Phat Tyre (OG=1.052; Wyeast 1762 Belgian Abbey I), both from Northern Brewer.   The instructions for both of these say to do 1-2 weeks in primary and 2-4 weeks in secondary. What I have usually done when I see this instruction is to leave it in primary for 4 weeks and then bottle.  I was hoping to get away with doing two week primaries before bottling.  The Honey Weizen still has a krausen. The Phat Tyre's krausen has dissipated. (To be honest it could possibly be the other way around, I forgot to put a post-it on each container ... I will know with certainty which batch is which when I disconnect the temperature probes (those black cords you see in the picture) from my Raspberry Pi, as per my temperature monitoring, and I'll edit this if I was wrong)  A) What is the reason for dissipation or non-dissipation of krausen? I'm assuming it has to do with the yeast.  B) Does it matter if I bottle when the krausen has not dissipated?  "
2598,Why Does a Heater in a Swamp Cooler Require a Pump to Distribute the Heated Liquid?,"I am facing my first winter of brewing with a swamp cooler. I need to acquire a few aquarium heaters (incidentally, please let me know if you know a good brand) and drop them in my swamp cooler to maintain temperature.  Now almost everything I read online states that I also need to acquire a water pump to place underneath the water heater in order to ""distribute the hot water into the colder parts of the water"" ...  Why am I to believe that this is necessary? What force of nature could possibly prevent warm water from being evenly and automatically distributed over 5-7 gallons of water in a swamp cooler?  The general internet consensus is that only a few inches of water around the water heater will remain warm, that the warmth somehow stays in the same spot, that it doesn't distribute itself as physics as I understand it would require it.  Why is the pump required -- what is the scientific explanation for how it is possible that warmth wouldn't flow from a hotter area to a colder area without the assistance from a pump, contrary to my understanding? "
2599,"My ""Cider"" has the consistency of puree - what to do?","3 weeks ago, I set up a batch of apple to make hard cider. I chopped the apples in a kitchen machine and added yeast. The yeast I put into a smaller batch of the mashed apples before, after ading some sugar there was vissible fermentation (bubbles). For most of the three weeks, I guess the fermentation went ok - there were always visible bubbles in the water lock. For a few days to one week, there's hardly any bubbles forming, so I figured the fermentation is done.   When I tried racking the cider today, it was too thick and I could only get a small amount through the racking tube. It is more liquid when I set it up, but still very thick.    The little bit I got through the tube, I filtered with a tea filter. The liquid is turbid, tastes slightly yeasty, sour and is definitly alcoholic.  Maybe an overreaction, but to kickstart the fermentation again I added a bit of sugar (maybe 2 tablespoons to 5kg apples) and shook the vessel to mix the stuff.  My father uses the same apples, he usually gets a clear liquid over a sediment of apples and yeast. He uses high performance yeast and adds lots of sugar to make booze.  The vessel ist standing in my kitchen with some temperature swings between day and night. The yeast I'm using is adopted to lower temperatures.  Now, what has happended and what can I do? I'm thinking of filtrating the cider through a cloth, would this be a way to go? What experiences have others made when femrenting from a puree?  Edit to add: My father, from whom I got the idea brew from puree, uses to add enzmes (Pektinase). Aparantly that's the trick. "
2600,Bitter tasting cider with Safale- 05,"I have a bitter tasting cider (think German beer) on my hands right now, and I really don't like the bitterness.   I started with an OG of 1.060, and my yeast was Safale 05.  Would aging help with getting rid of the bitter taste? how can I avoid this in the future? "
2601,Racked too soon. How do I fix?,"I'm brewing a Kolsh ale, and, I made the mistake of following the recipe that the brew shop provided. It said that I should rack the beer to a secondary fermenter after a week. When I opened the primary fermenter, it should have been clear that the primary fermentation wasn't done: the krausen was still foamy and hadn't settled into the beer, but I racked it anyway. I read later that I shouldn't have done that. The damage has been done.  My first question is: what negative effects I should expect from this in terms of taste, clarity, etc.? Secondly, is there anything I can do at this point to mitigate those effects? "
2602,How to calculate alcohol without OG reading?,"I tested 'brewing' a cider for the first time a few weeks ago. Since this process was so extremely different from what I am used to with brewing beers I completely forgot to take an OG reading. To be honest the amount of alcohol in the brew usually doesn't matter but since the first question from people always is ""How strong is it!?"" I thought it might be nice to know.  This is a pear cider where the pears are 'centrifuged', liquid is then heated, cooled and then topped off with english cider yeast.  My first thought was to make a new smaller batch and test this, but don't have any more of the same types of pears (from own tree).  Is there any way to calculate the ABV without having taken the OG reading? "
2603,What happens when mash temperature is too low?,"So yesterday we brew our second beer. As expected, some errors occured during the process, which is alright, we're learning! :)  So the main problem is that we were only able to keep the mash temperature at 60-62°C (140-143.5F). It lasted 60 minutes.  When taking OG, we were around 1.052 instead of around 1.062.  I wanted to know if:  1- Is it what affected OG? (I guess yes!)  2- What are the other effects that might happen?  Thanks! "
2604,ReaLemon's preservatives,"I'm trying a simple recipe for ginger beer (Method 1 here). Would using ReaLemon be ok instead of an actual lemon? I understand that preservatives in an apple juice can harm the yeast when making cider, but will this small amount (2-3 tablespoons) of lemon juice make a difference? "
2605,Why does my beer taste a little like wine?,"I'm a beginner homebrewer. I've brewed 3 beers, one from a Muntons and two from Brewferm brewkits. They were quite good, me and my friends liked them, but each one's taste reminded me a little bit of the taste of wine.  Why is that? Am I doing something wrong during brewing?  Update:  I used 2 Brewferm Gold and one Muntons Premium Bitter brewkits. I used the yeast which came with them. I added as much sugar as their manual said. The fermenter was a Brewferm plastic bucket put in a fridge with which temperature was controlled by a thermostat between 19 and 23°C. I fermented them for about 2 weeks, and they got the wine-like taste immediately before bottling them. The wine-like character is a bit sour, not strong. Definitely not sharp or vinegary. It tastes fine, like beer, but with a little wine-like character which doesn't fade much after 4 weeks in bottles at room temp. "
2606,Yeast/Green Apple Taste,"I have homebrewed with family many times and never had problems, nor did I with my first batch on my own.  The last couple, however, have had a yeasty/cidery/apple odor.  Very strong.  I doubt it is contamination; I am very careful about that.  I must have introduced some systematic error in my brewing.  The beers:   Strong Ale something like an Arrogant Bastard.  I can post a link to the recipe on brewersfriend.com  if needed.  It hit the FG exactly, but smelled extremely strong.  4 weeks in primary, well temp controlled.  68 for first two weeks, 70 for second two, and due to a loss of power (apartment flooded) high 70's for the last two weeks.  I decided to bottle the stuff and age it anyway.  In hindsight I probably should have left it on the yeast?  After aging 3 weeks, the smell is not as strong and the taste is correct. Hazelnut Brown ale.  68 for first week, 70 for a few days, 72 for a few days.  All activity in blow-off stopped after 11 days, at 14 opened to see if ready for bottling, but it has a fair amount of yeast/apple/cider smell.  I threw the lid back on and have it aging in the mid 70's.  The FG is still a little high, but only be a few thousandths.  I assume this one is just not done?   Other notes, I used starters for both and made sure to pitch a lot of yeast.  Wyeast 1056 for the first, and a mixture of White Labs English and European Ale yeast (WLP002 and WLP011 I think) for the latter.  The fermentation was extremely vigorous on the second day of each, to the point where I have to use a quick disconnect tube fitting to keep the blow-off tube on.  Blew tons of krausen and beer out the top.  Should I continue to age the two?  And what do you think is causing this so that I can avoid it?  Thanks!  Sorry for the wall-o-text.  Edit:  The smell has a slight cider smell to it, but it smells mostly like a fresh vial of liquid yeast.  But very, very strong in the AB clone.  Maybe a bit of apple.  My best idea is that I stressed the yeast and it did not finish the conversion of the acetylaldehyde into ethanol.  As far as sanitation, I have a second primary bucket, which I fill with water and iodine solution.  Usually I put in a bit more than is needed.  All utensils stay in that unless in use.  I apply the solution to the primary and the pot I use (I have to do extract for the next couple months until I move into a house).  I usually leave a bit on there.  I also have a squirt bottle I fill with the stuff to make sure things are sanitized.  Some items which are hard to get water into such as a bottling spicket, I will soak, then pout throught he dishwasher's sanitize cycle, then soak again.  I am  thinking from now on to use StarSan and sanitize all surfaces in my kitchen as well, including outside of all vessels.  I am brewing today and that is my plan so far.  "
2607,Inward pressure when fermenting cider,"I am making a cider using 1.5L apple juice, 1 cup sugar and Saflager s-23 Dry larger yeast.   I was using a balloon with a pin hole as the ""air lock"" on this as all my air locks were being used.   It had pressure for two weeks then seemed to die down a bit. When it died down I had a taste and it was slightly sour and yeasty so I put a new balloon on it and left it. I did not put a pin hole on this one and the balloon is now being sucked into the carboy.  What has cause this inward pressure and what does it mean for my cider?   I am going to move it to a bottle now and cap it and let it sit for a month or so. Is it worth doing this or is it buggered? "
2608,Scaling recipe ingredients to smaller batches? How do AAUs scale?,"I plan on brewing 1 gallon batches. The problem is that most recipes are for 5 gallon batches.   The scaling seems obvious: divide the amount of each ingredient by 5.   With this in mind, a few questions:   What about hops measured in AAUs (seen below)? Do these still get scaled down, even though they are a relative measure of acidity? How does yeast scale? I can't imagine dividing a small pack of yeast by 5 and having my beer ferment appropriately... Are there any other ""gotchas"" that I should consider when scaling back ingredients?    Example recipe from howtobrew.com:  Cincinnati Pale Ale Ingredients for a 5 gallon batch 3-4 lb. Pale malt extract syrup, unhopped 2 lb. Amber dry malt extract 12 AAU of bittering hops (any variety) For example, 1 oz. of 12% AA Nugget, or 1.5 oz. of 8% AA Perle 5 AAU of finishing hops (Cascade or other) For example, 1 oz. of 5% Cascade or 1.25 oz. of 4% Liberty 2 packets of dried ale yeast   After my proposed scaling:  Cincinnati Pale Ale Ingredients for a 1 gallon batch 0.6-0.8 lb. Pale malt extract syrup, unhopped 0.4 lb. Amber dry malt extract ?? AAU of bittering hops (any variety)  ?? AAU of finishing hops (Cascade or other)  ?? packets of dried ale yeast  "
2609,Yeast Starter OG - Factoring in the WYeast Liquid,"Is there any estimate to the ""OG of the WYeast Liquid""?  When I make a yeast starter with an OG of 1.040, dumping in the WYeast liquid will bring it down, assuming that the liquid has an OG of less than 1.040, and I assume it would have an OG of 1.000.  Does anyone attempt to factor that in while making yeast starters with WYeast? How is it done? "
2610,What are the characteristics of baker's yeast?,"I am looking to brew some ginger beer and other simple stuff.  I wonder what are the characteristics of baker's yeast? Will they do for a ginger beer? What are the disadvantages?  In Europe we have (""Fala"" brand) baker yeast packed in cubes and dry baker yeast (""Dr. Oetker"" brand). This stuff is cheap and I can get them in any grocery store. I don't expect wonders but a Champagne/other yeast is so hard to get. "
2611,Beeswax for bottle waxing,Has anyone tried making their own bottling wax using part beeswax? What percentage of beeswax did you use and how well did it work (coming on and coming off)? 
2612,Lagering (Secondary to Bottling to Lagering),"So I recently bottled a pilsner recipe after a drop from 1.061 to 1.011 specific gravity (over 6% ABV potential), and my recipe instructions called for 7-10 days at room temperature (since they've been bottled with a shot of priming sugar). Is this to induce carbonation or conditioning?  Room temperature is about 68 F where the bottles are now kept and its been 3 days in this state.  Then, the instructions call for moving the bottles back into cooler temperatures for lagering for an additional 2 weeks.  As a footnote, I tasted a sample at bottling time and it seems like it has a long way to go (in terms of taste, conditioning, alcohol content) and of course the instructions call for another 2-3 weeks.  Since it's my first lagering experience I'd like to make sure it turns out alright after lagering in the fridge for an additional 2 weeks at about 38 F.  Does the process I've described sound reasonable with a likelihood of suceeding? "
2613,Yeast starter with YM-Medium under aerob conditions?,"As far as I know the most common yeast starters are malt extracts which are sealed with an airlock. But the few times I worked with yeasts in the lab we used YM-Medium (Yeast extract-Malt extract)  to cultivate different yeasts, including S. cerevisiae. Anybody knows if it would be desireable to do the same if brewing? Or would it leed to an unpleasent taste?  Typical YM-Medium:   Yeast Extract.................................3.0 g/L Malt Extract...................................3.0g/L Peptone........................................5.0g/L Dextrose........................................10g/L   I assume it would have the best outcome regarding the devision rate.  Additionally many people seem to put an airlock on the flask prohibiting O2 of diffusing into the flask. Wouldn't it be better to put a cotton gauze plug on the flask so it is proplerly aerated (with a stirrer) while being protected from infections? Or is it somehow desirable to have the yeast fermenting instead of its areobic phase?   Thanks a lot in advance! "
2614,How to store fermenter after use,"I have two plastic fermenters and am wondering the best way to store them when I am not using them? Sometimes I don't get the opportunity to use them for a few months (longest was up to 1 year) so what is the best way to look after them while not in use?  After each use I will rinse with hot water and then screw the taps on, then use cling film/plastic wrap on the top then add the lid. "
2615,lots of moisture on the lid of the fermenter,I have had a lot of condensation or moisture on the lid of the fermenter when I open it during/at the end of primary fermentation. Is this normal?  I am very thorough with my cleaning and sterilizing and always have an appropriate airlock in place but am wondering if there is any way that this will affect my brew?  During the day at the moment the house is around 18-22 degrees C. I am not sure what the temperatures are inside the house during the night. 
2616,"Generic, fool-proof extract brewing method","Ingredients have arrived - I'm ready to go ahead with my latest brew. All those which I have done thus far haven't been perfect for a variety of reasons (admittedly probably my own fault as I've tried different methods/techniques as I've been learning).   So I'm trying to establish a reliable extract brewing method, from boil-to-bottle, encompassing everything which I have done so far and what I've been advised/read on here and other sites.  This particular brew for which I will use this method is as follows:-  23L batch. 10L boil. Safale US-05 11.5g  Fermentables:-  5kg light liquid malt extract (0.25kg of which is late addition @ 15mins.)  100g Dextrose  Bittering:-  75g Apollo hops - 60min boil - 19% AA  Flavouring:-  25g Apollo hops - 30min boil - 19% AA  25g El Dorado hops - 30min boil - 14.1% AA  Aroma:-  75g El Dorado hops - 15min boil - 14.1% AA  Predicted Properties:-  Original Gravity: 1.063 Final Gravity: 1.012 ABV: 6.75% IBU: 103.99  Method  N.B. I'm omitting 'obvious' things like sterilisation here:-  1) Bring water to a rolling boil, remove from the heat and add required amount (add all if doing no late additions) of fermentables and stir until full dissolved. Ensure that none is stuck to the bottom of the pan.  2) Return to a rolling boil and add the amount of hops as and when desired.  3) Flameout. Remove from heat and cool as fast as possible to near pitching temperature ASAP as to avoid bacterial growth etc.  4) Add additional water content to reach the desired fermentation volume. (As an addition/replacement for step 3, this water can be cooled as much as possible to aid in reducing the temperature of the wort.  5) Pitch yeast evenly when the wort is at a temperature slightly lower than ideal fermentation temperature. When fermentation commences, the yeasts' exothermic reactions will raise the temperature further until optimal temp. is reached.  6) Seal the FV and monitor fermentation. When complete, turn off heat source.  7) (A subjective step) Leave in primary for xx days (I usually go for 2-3 weeks in the primary, including the fermentation period.)  8) Once conditioned, cold crash the FV in a bath or suitable container for approx. 48 hours prior to bottling to aid in yeast drop out.  9) Prime bottles, add beer, cap, store in warm place for minimum 2 weeks to condition and carbonate.  10) Drink.

2617,Bitter hay finishing taste with very slight burnt rubberyness,"Me and my dad have made a beer about 3 months ago. The beer was made with:   oats pale malt flaked barley tap water (United Kingdom - South West - Guildford ) cascade hops 1/2 goldings hops 1/2   and we followed an export recipe roughly.  The outcome at this current time is a wonderful beery aroma with a slight citrus to it. The initial taste is good too, it has a good bitterness and a citrus note just trying its hardest to come through but it never quite gets there... all is quite pleasant until the finishing taste, it's its downfall...  When running it over the tongue its extremely bitter, very hay like and very very slight rubbery taste. There is also a very subtle starch haze.    From your experience, what might be introducing this unpleasant after taste? Is it just a matter of giving it some more time? "
2618,A question on the Brewers' Friend Calculator,"Does anyone know, for when using the calculator, for extract brewing, at what time the calculator assumes you add the malt (liquid malt extract in my case)? I.e. does it assume late addition or full 60 min. boil? I am asking because I want to get to as close to the predicted IBU level of my beer as possible for my boil size. As I understand, AA extraction can be affected (reduced?) by the sugars in the wort.  Thanks. "
2619,Going from Mead to Beer,"I have a little bit of experience in making mead, I have a batch to be bottled in a few days. Now, I wanted to try to make beer next, where should I start?  What are the major differences between making mead and beer? I don't even boil my water, I do have a secondary fermentation and I siphon to leave the dead yeast (no filtering).   Bonus: Is there any type of beer that is harder to fail / more likely to be good at the first try? "
2620,Beer color - Calculating MCU,"I have two questions regarding calculating the MCU for a beer receipt.  MCU = (weight of grain i lbs) * (color in degrees lovibond) / (volume in gallons)    For my grains, I have the color listed in SRM, and not Lovibond. Do I have to first convert the color to Lovibond, and then put it into the formula, or is there a variation of this formula that I can use with SRM as well? Which volume do I use here? Do I use the volume at the point in the process where I want to calculate the color? Then I guess post-boil volume would be the best volume to use, or are you supposed to just use the batch size?  "
2621,Beer turning cloudy when poured into a glass,"So i opened up a bottle of home brew that had been lagering for a few months. When i opened it and pour it into a glass is was perfectly clear with nice carbonation. Then within 5-10 minutes it was cloudy, and the sort of cloudy you get at the end of a barrel, any ideas why?? "
2622,Should I back-sweetening a very dry mead?,"So, I made a batch (4.5 gallons) of show mead using 10lbs of locust honey. Starting gravity was 1.091  I used dry white wine yeast and fermentation went relevantly quick (with some help of potassium carbonate, DAP and Ferment-K), dropping from 1.090 to 1.003 in just 5 days and stopping. I just injected a last portion of the nutrients a night before and next day it was all done.  So, right now it is 1.003 with 11.5% of alcohol. For obvious reason I cannot taste anything yet in my mead, and probably won't be able for at least another 4-5 month (that's where the taste would start evening out.  So, since I've never made a standard dry show mead (by definition of BJCP Guide OG=1.080-1.120, ABV=7.5-14.0%, FG=0.990-1.010), I'm not sure what to expect. I was hoping to finish at 1.010, but overshoot a little bit. Thus I have few questions:   How does a dry mead turns out usually? Like a white wine, Chardonnay, I assume? Will it preserve the aroma of locust honey even with 1.003 gravity? Should I back-sweeten it with 8-12oz of locust honey trying to bring the gravity to 1.008-1.010 or would it be fine like that?  Would 2-3 years of aging help it? I'm pretty new into mead-making (a year), and never aged my mead longer then that. What is the best time for the back-sweetening? After mead just cleared out, 9-12 month out when it is servable or right away after fermentation is over and I stabilized with camden tables? I was thinking about splitting a batch into 3 and 1 gallons for aging, so I could play around with 1 gallon without fear of loosing the whole batch. If I use few french oak cubes with 1 gallon (1/4 of an oz or so), how much character would it bring to dry mead?   Sorry, if that was too long, and really appreciate your help. "
2623,Handling dried yeast,I'm brewing a coopers ginger beer kit but over the past week the yeast didn't seem to activate particularly well. There has been no krausen and over the past couple  of days there have been a few bubbles on top but that's it. I have done a couple of coopers kits but ordered these from a different supplier. I decided to give Amazon a try as it was cheaper but I think that the yeast might have been mistreated. Is it possible to abuse dried yeast? I just sprinkled my dried yeast over the top when the mixture was around 21 degrees.   The kit has an expiry date of the February 2016.   Is there anything that can be done to save the batch? Such as just leave it to ferment for longer as there is less yeast?  
2624,First time brewer. I'm afraid I've ruined my beer,"This is my first time breing beer, and I was doing so while distracted with kids, and unfortunately I missed the dry malt extract packet that was in my IPA kit.  There were 2 cans of a liquid malt extract, and when the directions said to add the malt extract I thought that was all there was, and while I was cleaning up this evening I found the packet of dry extract.  Do y'all think the beer will be ruined? Should I just toss it out and chalk it up as a learning experience?  Or just roll with it and hopefully it turns out ok? "
2625,Is it Better to leave beer in secondary longer or bottle?,"first question asked in homebrew.stackexchange.  I've got a pumpkin ale that I've just moved from primary to secondary (after 7 weeks). The original plan was to have it 7/7/7 (7 weeks in primary, 7 weeks in secondary and then 7 weeks in bottle) before opening.   Why? because I liked the sound of it  However, there's a local home-brewer's competition that I'd like to enter, and the submissions close in 4 weeks time. So the question is:   Do I leave it in secondary for another week and then bottle for 3? Do I leave it in secondary for another 2 and bottle for 2? Do I leave it for another 3 weeks and then bottle for only 1?   I know that there are different types of fermentation stages and it has to go through each of those stages after I add my bottling sugars, but to be honest, I don't QUITE comprehend those stages (yet).  I was just wondering which of the 3 above options would probably be the best.  Thanks in advance!  As an added bonus, would I need to pitch more yeast?  Extra info: I've got about 45 litres of the stuff, so I'll be drawing about 5 for the competition and leaving the rest for the 7/7/7 plan "
2626,How would I handle a boil-over and loss of hops?,"I recently was brewing a 1 gallon kit from Northern Brewer (The White House Honey Ale kit) and instantly after adding the first packet of hops, the entire kettle boiled over. Absolutely instantly, there's nothing I could do to stop it.   I estimate I lost about 1/2 to 1 cup of water and up to 1/4th of my first hops packet (there were no issues when I added the second one later in the brew.) I asked the Northern brewer chatline for help and was only told ""Don't try to add more liquid or your beer will be too watery.""  Is the loss of the hops going to be an issue in the final flavor? Any recommendations on preventing a future boil-over?   Addtl: I used a 2 gallon kettle as the directions recommend. It's a 1 gallon kit and I used the instructed 5 quarts (1.25 gal) of water. "
2627,How to fix yeast smell in young wine from kit,"I started my first attempt at fermenting this wine kit in mid-April.  I followed the initial directions pretty meticulously which included stirring in the fermentation bucket daily (due to kit including dried grape skins).  My hydrometer was reading a bit higher than reality, so the racking at ~1.020 might've been a bit behind. Almost for sure the racking at 0.998 was a late. At that point I stabilized according to instructions, racked it back into a 6 gallon carboy, and topped it up.  The problem is when testing for clarity (which now seems fine) it has a very strong yeast smell, and somewhat strong yeast flavor.  I know a young wine shouldn't taste ""ready"" yet, and I'd be happy to bottle and age if that's normal, but from most things I've read so far this isn't quite normal. (I'm not going for the ""on lees"" flavor since this is a Cabernet Sauvignon.)  How yeasty should a wine be before bottling?  Can anything be done to salvage this batch? What should be done to avoid this in the future? "
2628,Clarity for the sake of impatience,"I've been in the winemaking industry for over a decade, but this is only my second homebrew, and only the first that I have fermented at home. You would think I'd be more patient working with a product that takes two years for completion, but alas...here we are.  Primary fermentation was slooow. I split the batch with a friend and he was done in a week. Mine was a touch colder and ran closer to two. After the gravity stopped moving, I shoved the carboy into a fridge in an attempt to cold crash. The only change was I removed the airlock and sealed the typical orange cap. After about nine days, and no crystal clear clarity, I talked to a buddy who used to do this semi-pro and he recommended moving to a secondary and putting the airlock back on. So I did that, and in the process of racking I noticed the the residual carbon dioxide was fairly present. Winemaker me thinks that is the main culprit in keeping small amounts of lees in suspension.  So now it's been three to four days later, and I'm seeing no appreciable gains. Is it just a waiting game? If I keg it, will it eventually settle despite the increase in C02? Should I clarify if it's that important to me?  If it will eventually clear in keg, that would be doable as I get to ""check on its progress"" when needed.  I like the idea of clarifying, but not if it strips the beer. I'm leaning toward Polyclar or maybe gelatin.  Yeast was WLP051 California V, listed as Medium to High floc. "
2629,on not priming ale,"After reading Graham Wheeler's Brew your own British ale, in which he says:"" a well brewed beer, kept its proper time, should not need priming or fining. A good yeast will clear down unaided, and residual dextrins in the beer will  slowly ferment and produce perfect condition......"" I have tried this on a a couple of bottles of dry Irish stout which did come into condition after 10 weeks at lowish temps (5-14 degrees centigrade), though the carbonation/head was pretty weak compared with the (normally) primed others. I have tried the same with my ESB which has been bottled now for 8 weeks at the balmy English summer temps of 12-16 degrees centigrade. Bottles have started to condition now but head still weak..... Taste brilliant. (but more so than the bottles that were primed normally? I can't compare them cos I quaffed the whole primed lot and thus have nothing to compare the un-primed bottles with). Just wondered if anybody else had experience of not priming? "
2630,Is it bad to let air into my primary fermenter?,"My beer has been in the primary for about 5 days now. I can only assume fermentation has stopped as its reached peak krauzen and the froth seems to be subsiding.  I attempted to seal up my primary as best as possible after I added a new bung through which to feed a wire for my thermostat but there was inevitably going to be gaps as I didn't have the proper tools - as a result gas has not been exiting through the bubble air lock but I don't see this as a problem in itself.  I would like to take a sample for FG testing but this will draw air in through the hole(s) - is this okay? Can I assume that very little, if any, CO2 will escape meaning that there will still be a CO2 layer on top of the beer to stop it oxygenating?  "
2631,Can I decrease Original Gravity of the beer during fermentation process?,I am trying to brew 5 gal of Dunkelweizen. I used instructions from:  Dunkelweizen  I measured the OG of 1080 after cool down the wort. It should be 1050-1053.  What should I do in order to decrease the OG? What will happen if I don't do something? 
2632,Is oxygenating after brew day okay?,"If you don't oxygenate on brew day, is it too late or can you oxygenate late? If so, are there limits? "
2633,Bottle conditioning / carbonation temperature,"Yesterday i bottled my first brew. I put the bottles in a box in my room. There is a thermometer inside the box, it reads 25°C. I've read before that the it should be in 18°C - 24°C range.   Will 25°C affect taste and/or flavor? Although i believe i gave enough room for CO2, i don't want to have bottle bombs.  What can i do to lower the temperature? I thought about putting the bottles in a bucket and filling the bucket with cold tap water. Will this work? Do you have any other ideas?  I brewed a Mr. Beer Aztec Mexican Cerveza. The fermentation temperature was around 23°C. "
2634,What is the approximate batch size/OG limit for US-05 11g packet? Have I used enough?,"I've started a brew with an OG of 1.065 in a 23L batch. I pitched a rehydrated 11g pack of US-05 and after 5 days I took a FG reading when I observed no bubbles after some time; it came out at 1.028 - quite a bit higher than expected (target FG is 1.012).  So, I upped the temperature of my fermenter having realised I only set it at 17degC (oops, I meant to do 19degC but I'm hoping it won't be too much of a problem - it's a versatile yeast I hear!) as well as doing a pretty vigorous swirl of the fermenter to kick up some of the yeast cake. Came back a few hours later, hoorah, bubbles! I'm aware that bubble rate is a terrible way of judging fermentation stage (atmospheric temperature and pressure being factors but both have been consistent over the past week) but going from no bubbles to bubbles after doing this can only be a good thing!  I was/am a bit worried that I didn't pitch enough yeast for this OG since the Brewers' Friend yeast pitch calculator said I was short by about half the cells required - maybe I'm just being paranoid?!  Question(s) - Will I be okay in getting nearer to my FG? In general, from experience or otherwise, what are the upper limits on OG and batch size for an 11g packet of US-05 before I need to think about adding a 2nd packet?  Thanks! "
2635,Steam sanitation of a stainless steel fermenter and bottles,"Premise  As a chemical engineering student, I tried my best to avoid any chemical at all (When they say trust me, you should never do so).    As such, I resorted to steam to sanitize my fermenter and bottles. However, the steam comes out of the household appliance with a plastic scent to it.    I know, by fact, that this indicates a presence of plastic degradation molecules: however, I still tried sanitizing a part of the bottles this way as the fermenter, which I had first tested the appliance on, produced a healthy (I hope...) wort.    Question  How safe would that beer be? Also, can anybody provide me with real-world data on the sanitation-water temperature-soaking time for hot tap water? (That is, soaking in 25°C water of course will never work, regardless of time, but I believe 60°C would work over 30 minutes, and 45°C should work over 1 hour)  Also, how high are the odds of wort infection for 1 minutes of 45°C hot water soaking?    Brew Data  Malt extract &amp; Yeast: Cooper Lager kit OG: .034 FG: .010 Fermentation vessel material: stainless steel Bottle material: glass Cap material: Half the bottles have ceramic caps, half have tin and plastic ones Fermentation average temperature: 26°C Signs of wort infection: none "
2636,Modifying root beer recipe to alcoholic variant?,"I recently obtained a bottle caper, some sassafrass bark chips, and some root beer extract flavoring from a coupling moving out. It also contained a recipe for rootbeer(non-alcoholic), listed below:  Beginners Quick Bottling Recipe: Uses 2 used 2-L plastic soda bottles   1/8 teaspoon dry yeast, in a 6oz cup of warm water 2 &amp; 1/4 cups sugar, 1 tablespoon extract Mix in 1 gallon container Pour 1/2 mixture in each soda bottle Top off each bottle with plain water to within 1 &amp; 1/2 inches of top use resealable cap and shake store at room temp in the 70's for 4-6 days   How would I modify this recipe to allow for the soda to be alcoholic AND also be stored in smaller used beer glass bottles?  Doing some of my own research, and only having made ""hooch"" before I assume that I could simply add more yeast and sugar to allow for more alcohol, but then regardless how would I deal with a loss of carbonation when decanting my product from the 2 L bottles to the smaller glass bottles, or the possible risk of still active yeast? I do not have access to alot of fancy equipment like kegs or carbonators, not even a siphon. "
2637,My elderflower syrup has (unexpectedly) started fermenting. How should I handle this to obtain something drinkable?,"About 10 days ago I made some elderflower syrup. I used:   350g of elderflower 6 liters of water 8kg of sugar 160g of citric acid 12 lemons cut in pieces   I left everything macerate for 2 days and then filtered it. I didn't boil the syrup, I simply put it into bottles (I followed the recipe given me from a friend who said boiling wasn't required in the end). I've noticed that in the last few days the remaining bottles (about 5 liters) have started fermenting and I can smell some alcohol from them.  Now I wonder, is it possible to obtain some alcoholic beverage from such bottles of syrup? Which steps should I take to avoid throwing the syrup in the trash? (Note: I have zero experience in brewing) "
2638,Filtering air intake during cold crash,"I'm thinking of cold crashing my current brew, but I am not comfortable with the idea of allowing sanitizer to be sucked in, and I'm not happy with foil  I have heard that maybe there are micro foam bungs or some sort of filter, but struggling to find such a thing on the googles.   Does anyone use these things? Know what they are called so I can find them? "
2639,"My airlock keeps becoming empty on one side, is that normal?","This is my first time brewing and I only started yesterday, so I'm still very much a novice.   I have a bubbler airlock on my 33 litre fermenting bucket, like the one in this image:   I filled it up to about 50% at each side and left the bucket overnight, when I checked it around 7 hours later, it had become empty on one side (right side if that matters). I filled it back up to 50% each side and went off to work, when I checked it just now (10 hours later), it's the same as it was this morning, 50% full on the left side and empty on the right side. I'm currently brewing 20 litres (40 pints) of cider and the temperate in the cupboard is around 18c - 20c, fairly consistently.  Is this how the airlock should function? Am I suppose to leave one side empty and have the other half full? Or do I need to keep topping it up with water every 6-8 hours or so?  Thanks for any help you can provide.  Carl. "
2640,Adding Vanilla Extract?,"I have a black stout fermenting right now.  I added about 8oz of cacao powder in the boil and I'd like to add some vanilla extract, to taste.  Can this be done before bottling? Should this have been added in the boil (for future reference)? "
2641,Is there a good way to estimate/calculate volume lost in fermentation(s)?,"Last night I bottled a batch and realized that I lost a significant volume from the boil size. In the primary, I filled my 6 gallon carboy, and after the trub lost in primary and secondary, I bottled just under 5 gallons of beer. Which means, I lost an average of 0.5 gallons per fermentation stage.   Is anyway to estimate the volume lost other than by empirical methods? Does the OG, FG, or type of yeast play a predictable role in this? Would I have lost the same volume had I not transferred to secondary?  I realize this is a normal loss, this is purely a question of curiosity.  some numbers, if they help:   Vol in primary: 6gal Vol in secondary: ? Vol bottled: 4.83gal OG/FG: 1.054/1.012 yeast: US-05  "
2642,Can ale yeast be used weeks after it's opened (Safale S-04)?,"Second-time brewer (to be).  When I did my first kit brew, I didn't want to mess anything up, and the instructions I was following told me to avoid the yeast sachet taped to the top of the LME can and get a reasonable, brand-name yeast that you can be confident is going to work well (it did); I got an 11g sachet of Safale S-04.  However, I only have a 11L carboy, so I only needed about half the sachet for my first brew.  Next, I'm going to do a 9L brew, so I only need about the same amount of yeast again.  So, the question is -- does it make a difference at all if the yeast packet is opened?  After I opened it, I folded it over and it's been sitting on my (cool) kitchen counter for the past 6 weeks (doh, I should have put it in the fridge, yes, I know).  Should I just pitch it in the trash, or pitch it in the beer? "
2643,adding 1 g to 5 g recipe - keep OG the same,"So i've got a 5 gallon partial mash kit(OG 1.065), and I am looking to add around a gallon to increase my yield for the session.  What formula could I use to know how much extra dme to use to keep gravity constant while adding a gallon?  I already have a formula to find the end gravity when just increasing volume (BG*BV=EG*EV), but how do I factor in a volume increase that will have a gravity higher than water??? "
2644,Fermentation Process,"Good Evening Folks,  Well...my first batch seemed to go pretty well.  Within 24 hours it was bubbling pretty good.  Now 72 hours later, the bubbling has become very slow  I'm talking one bubble every 15 seconds or so..  I'm a little concerned that it should still be bubbling more.  I want to rack it into a carboy this weekend (I brewed Monday night).  I was at 1.040 so is it ok to let it sit 3 more days and test it Sunday?  If the specific gravity isn't where it should be should I add more yeast and leave it in the bucket?  Thanks!  Mike "
2645,"Day Three, still no apparent fermentation","During my most recent brew session I may have been a little too relaxed, and had a few too many homebrews during the process.    I feel like I did everything right and kept everything sanitary, but was too drunk by the end of the boil to move my beer to a warm place.  So, it sat in my cold (mid-low 50s) basement overnight and through the morning.  I moved it to a warmer (high 60s/low 70s) environment the next day but that was two days ago and there's still no sign of fermentation.  No krausen, no bubbles, nothing.  Can I make a new yeast starter and pitch, or should I wait a little longer to see if they little guys wake up?  Assuming I can salvage the batch, what effects will this have on my beer? "
2646,Can a Beer Ferment Too Quickly?,My beer seems to be fermenting more quickly than predicted by the kit.  The last beer I made was ready (with the correct final gravity) in just under a week rather than the 2 weeks predicted by the kit.  The beer I have fermenting right now seems like it will be finished fermenting in the next few days (the bubbles are coming very slowly) and it's only been in the carboy for about 5 days.  The kit predicted 2-3 weeks.  The last beer was an amber ale and this one is a chocolate stout.  The carboy is being kept in a closet at about 68 degrees.  If I reach my final gravity does it matter how quickly the beer ferments?  Should I be worried about this? 
2647,Do I need a yeast starter for a 1.040 gravity wort?,"I'm brewing on Sunday (today is Friday), and I neglected to get my yeast (WY1056) until just this afternoon. I could make a starter, but I don't know if it would reach ""high krausen"" in time for pitching Sunday night. And I certainly wouldn't be able to cold crash it, as I normally do.   Or, I could just pitch the smack pack, which has a manufacture date of 13-Feb-2012. Beer Smith tells me that the yeast is 84% viable, yielding 84 billion cells. It also says that for a beer of 1.040 gravity, I need 160 billion cells. In contrast, the smack pack's instructions state that for beers up to 1.060 I don't need to do a starter.  So, who's right? Beer smith or WYEast? "
2648,Can wine age too long?,"So I started a batch of wine at the end of the summer, and I happen to have a bad habit of not following through on projects. Basically, I fermented it, moved it to the 2ndary after about a week, then reracked about a month afterwards. Since then, it's been sitting in my basement (cool and dark) aging in the carboys. This has probably been there 5 months (wow).  I guess at this point my question is: Do you think there's anything wrong with bottling it at this point? Is it most likely bad or do you think it's perfectly fine to let it sit that long?  I may open one up to smell/taste it. Hope it will be ok so it wasn't a waste of time/energy. Thanks in advance for the advice. "
2649,Is my gummy wild yeast unusual?,"As an experiment, I brewed a gallon-sized batch last weekend using some wild yeast I had captured. Fermentation looks to have proceeded pretty normally, except that the yeast has a somewhat strange appearance. In particular, it seems to be very gummy. Big chunks of it keep traveling in both directions -- from the sediment at the bottom to the kräusen at the top, and vice versa -- and it's starting to stick to pretty much every part of the glass fermenter.  Is this unusual? Is it a sign of lactobacillus or some other non-yeast activity?  EDIT  The history behind the yeast: last summer, I used unwashed organic grapes with white flour and water to create a bread starter. I've been keeping the starter alive since then; at first, by feeding it every day, three times a day. More recently, it spends six days out of seven in the refrigerator and gets three feedings on its day out. The starter has a rather floral bouquet and does not taste very sour at all.  I took about two tablespoons of this starter and put it into a DME soup. As I was able to observe the expected yeast activity, I concluded that my ""bread yeast"" was capable of doing duty as ""brewers yeast"". When I pitched, I avoided including the original blobs of dough -- though of course, some flour is likely to have dissolved into the larger quantity of liquid. "
2650,"Should dry hopping be done in secondary, when to transfer, and for how long?","After surveying questions related to dry hopping and secondary here on the Exchange, I don't yet have solid answers to the following questions.   Should beer be transferred to secondary for the purpose of dry hopping? If so, why? How long after primary should the beer be transferred to secondary? Regardless of secondary, how long should the beer be on the hops before bottling/kegging?   The context is that I have an IPA that I plan to dry hop, which is a technique I've never done before. The beer is a Stone IPA clone based on this recipe, and it is now at the 1 week mark of fermentation. It's a 5gal batch (closer to 4.5) and I have about 2.25 ounces of whole-leaf hops (Centennial, Amarillo and Cascade) that I plan to use. The secondary vessel would be a 5gal glass carboy.  I've read related posts about whether or not to secondary, and I agree that secondary is generally unnecessary. However, my source recipe implies secondary, and that matches my general understanding: get the beer off the trub before dry hopping. But I haven't yet got a clear answer about it. I am listening to the Brew Strong episode about dry hopping right now but I may not have the patience for a 90+ minute podcast to get my answer; besides, text is much easier as a reference. "
2651,Importance of Mash and Sparge Water Volumes using Batch Sparge,"I'm new to all grain brewing and one of the things I haven't been able to find much information on is the importance of water volumes for the mash and sparge steps.    There are a lot of calculators out there, and I'm trying to find out if water volumes play a key role in the extraction of sugars from the grain.  It makes sense that too little water in a mash wouldn't allow for the extraction of sugars because not all of the grain would be soaking in the mash water.  But, can the mash efficiency be lessened when mashing with too much water?  And, once mashing is complete, does it really matter how much sparge water is used, so long as you reach your target pre-boil volume? "
2652,Double decoction mash profile for full bodied beer,"I'm planning to brew a Single Malt and Single Hop (SMaSH) beer using Canada Malting's Superior Pilsner and Czech saaz hops. I'd like the resulting beer to be full bodied, like Pilsner Urquell, but I'm concerned that an intensive decoction mash will produce a very fermentable wort.   I've been reading Braukaiser's page on decoction mashing, though he doesn't go into much detail on mashing for body. Here's what I've come up with as a first approximation.  Would this mash schedule produce a full-bodied beer?  Mash in 146 for 35 minutes Decoct to 160 for 40 minutes Decoct to 170 for 10 minutes  "
2653,Backflow into gas line,"I just started kegging.  I have a beer in a 5 gal ball lock keg.  I connected the regulator, set pressure to 15 psi and connected the gas line to the keg.    When I connected the liquid line (standard picnic attachment: [website]I also noticed that some beer flowed into the gas line.  How did this happen?  Did I overfill the keg?  Will this damage the regulator? "
2654,do I need a thermowell with stainless temperature sensor?,"I'm planning a fermentation monitor based on an arduino board. The temperature sensors comprise a 1/4"" OD stainless tube 8"" long, which will be used with buckets and carboys.   There are stainless thermowells for housing temperature sensors. These are 3/8"" OD, 16"" long. Do I need a thermowell in this case for measuring wort temperature, or can I put the temperature sensor directly into the wort without the thermowell? Here's why I'm unsure:   the thermowell page talks about protecting the temperature sensor, yet the stainless tube on the temperature sensor is made using the same process as the thermowell, so it's ok to immerse the stainless part of the sensor directly in the wort? most grommets for airlocks are 3/8"" size, making the thermowell a perfect fit. Are there 1/4"" grommets that would fit the temperature probe? A quick search didn't find anything.   Just some background info - I will also be measuring ambient temperatures as well as wort temperature, and understand the issues involved with temperature control based on the wort temperature due to the large thermal mass. I'm curious to see in practice how much fermentation temperatures rise above ambient over the entire fermentation period. "
2655,"New brewer, question about state of beer prior to bottling","Tomorrow is the Big Bottling Day. I snuck a peek about a week ago and took a hydro reading, and all is well I believe. I took another peek today (14 days in) just to make sure I'm not about to bottle a mess, and I just wanted some confirmation that what I'm seeing is ok (and not symptoms of mold or contamination), considering the difference between last pic and this pic.   Here's ~7 days into it: [website]Here's today: [website]There was some temperature fluctation, but I've tried to keep it no higher than 72. In the past couple of days I got it down towards 69...maybe it's some renewed fermentation?  When I pull the lid on the pail, I definitely get the ""whoosh""/hiss sound of CO2 coming out.   Thanks for your advice!!  Update: Bottling is done!   Pictures at: [website]FG is right at 1.011, with the acceptable range being 1.010-1.012.   When I opened the primary this time, there was no ""whoosh"" or feel of air escaping. Also it seems all the big bubbles were gone and down into a ton of tiny bubbles. They dissipated quickly while racking to the bottling bucket. That makes me pretty hopeful it's not a solid (like a mold or yeasts still stuck together etc.).  Samples smell like a perfect ale. Taste tested by 3 people, all found it tasty, if not particularly ""complex"". I know the carbonation/conditioning process can change the flavor characteristics...  Got 21 22oz bottles full, and about 5 normal size to be ""flavor/carb check"" victims. About 1/2 gallon left in the bottling bucket when we stopped; it just had too many solids and I didn't have a proper screen or way to filter them. It's definitely starting to become clear the advantage of a secondary to help refine/filter, or at least trying to filter while going to bottling bucket.   Whatcha think guys? "
2656,Keg/CO2 question as I think about moving to kegging,"This is probably a foolish one, but...  So you can force carbonate with a keg (or sugar carbonate, but of course why would you), and then serve from the keg with the CO2 to help dispense.   But, if one wanted to get a couple of kegs but only a single CO2 tank, is that a normal manageable setup?   I would conjecture that the procedure is: ferment (in primary), carbonate in keg (either priming or force), dispense (for keg 1). Then is it acceptable practice to repeat into keg 2 (3, et al) by removing the tank from keg 1 and using it on 2, and 3, and then simply moving the tank back to whichever one you want to dispense from when you are ready?   I.e. does there need to be a constant tank hookup (I would think no, the keg itself is air and pressure tight?), or can you make the most of your investment by cycling through a tank or two to pull off beer from multiple kegs as desired?   Edit: Clarified that I meant ferment in the primary, NOT in the keg! "
2657,Will using a 2-liter soda bottle as a growler affect flavor?,"Just read an article about a NYC beer hall filling 2-liter plastic soda bottles instead of glass growlers. I wouldn't expect this to make a significant difference over 24 hrs, but is there any chance this might affect the flavor?   Aside from the risk of skunking by light through the clear container, what about other flavors? While many of us use plastic BetterBottles, they claim to use a special plastic with ""No tastes or odors"" and ""no carry over flavors"". What of these problems would a 2-liter suffer? "
2658,Corny Real Ale?,"I am interested in learning some of the intricacies associated with 'real ale'. I realize that out in industry, this is done in large stainless steel (or aluminum?) barrels with special corks etc etc in order to achieve the desired level of carbonation and aging. My question is, has it been attempted to replicate this keg conditioning using a corny keg, aside from simply adding priming sugar and letting it carb? Would a first attempt at this be as simple as hooking up a pressure relief of some sort to the CO2-in port, and letting it sit at 58F (ish) for awhile, or is the cask conditioning process much more involved than this?  "

2660,Can I use a dishwasher that has rinse agent to sanitize my bottles?,"My dishwasher has a built in rinse agent dispenser that it claims must be filled for every use, besides I have no clue how to empty it once it is filled. Can I still run my bottles in the dishwasher without detergent? Also why can't you use the dishwashing detergent for a dishwasher? My dishwasher also has a sanitize cycle that automatically occurs would that be good enough for bottles?  Thanks, Bruce "
2661,Does mash thickness make a difference in any calculations?,"I am looking to do my first partial mash and I have been seeing instructions for using a mash thickness anywhere from 1 to 1.5 quarts of water per pound (per 450g).  What does the thickness of a mash change?  Are there any calcuations that need to be adjusted based on this thickness?  Also, does changing the ratio of the sparge water to pounds of grain change anything?  I typically do a 5 gallon (19 litre)  batch and a 3 gallon (11 litre) boil (do not have the equipment for a full boil yet).  What is a typical ratio.  I have read that a thicker mash will provide a fuller body and sweeter taste.  However the tradeoff I've seen is that the sugars may not ferment fully, is that accurate?  What is recommended for a beginner partial masher?  Thanks, ~ Tom "
2662,What is the average gravity difference between a Forced Fermentation and normal fermentation,"I just started doing forced fermentation (FF) tests with each batch I make. I know that the final gravity of the FF beer will be lower than the final gravity of the beer fermented normally in the carboy -- but how much lower? Is there a normal range, or is it going to vary wildly?  For example, I just finished a batch of ESB. The FF beer has an FG of 1.013 and the beer in the carboy stopped at 1.016 - 1.017. Is that a normal range, or is that an indication that the beer in the carboy didn't ferment fully?  "
2663,Munich LME recipe conversion?,"I would like to make the Maibock recipe from Brewing Classic Styles.  It calls for Munich LME.    1) Does anybody know where I can get my hands on some 100% Munich LME?  2) If I can't get 100% Munich, Jamil Zainasheff says ([website]"
2664,How to brew less than 5 gallons at a time?,"I recently moved into a smaller apartment and no longer have the space for my 6.5 and 5 gallon carboys.  Do people sell smaller carboys than this?  I know Mr. Beer would be small enough, but I'd rather have something a bit bigger.  Also, most extract kits come in 5 gallon recipes.  I imagine I can half everything and brew 2.5 gallons at a time.  Is there any downsides to this, or anything special I should look out for? "
2665,Boiling bottle caps,"I've always soaked my bottle caps in sanitizer before using, but a friend of mine suggested boiling (throw in the same pot with priming sugar) instead because the cooties can theoretically hide from the sanitizer solution but not from the heat. This makes intuitive sense, although one could debate whether the extra effectiveness has any practical measure.  My question is what the downsides are (if any) of boiling the caps. Could a slight metallic taste be imparted? Weaker seal? Something else? "
2666,Carbonation Drops vs. Sugar?,"I'm brewing my very first batch with an actual kit (I've used Mr. Beer before with decent results and wanted to do it right).   I bought a recipe kit from Northern Brewer and I opted for the Cooper's Carbonation drops. But I see no one mention them here - or pretty much anywhere else.   The beer (the XPA recipe) is on week 2 of fermentation and seems to be progressing nicely - the fermentation seems to have mostly stopped after being very robust.  I've ordered another kit from Northern Brewer with the regular priming sugar. It'll be here before bottling. Should I use the priming sugar or the carbonation drops? In a related question, I'll be bottling in different sized bottles (12, 16 and 22 oz.) The instructions call for 1 drop per 375 ml and 2 for 750 - what would I use for the 16 oz?? "
2667,No bubbles in the airlock - should I still bottle the brew?,"I'm attempting my first brew using a kit with all the provided ingredients (it's a lager).  My brew is still in the big tub and has been there for about 2 weeks now.  Initial SG was 1.040 and it's now 1.010.  The problem is that the airlock has never bubbled so I'm not sure if I should proceed to bottling yet or not.  I've kept the brew at about 26°C during the day, down to about 22 at night so I think the temperature is OK.  Should I proceed to bottling the brew anyway?  Should I add more yeast?  Or should I throw it all away and start again?  Is there anything else I can test?  [EDIT: updated the initial SG from 1.004 to 1.040, typo sorry!] "
2668,What is the purpose in adding unmalted wheat to a beer?,"In looking for a new wheat beer recipe, I came upon the following:  Improvisational Wheat  It mentions using 3 pounds of unmalted wheat, crushing separately, and boiling for 30 minutes.  What is the specific reason for using unmalted wheat, and what is the 30 minutes of boiling for? "
2669,Is homebrewing beer legal in Ontario Canada?,"Is homebrewing beer legal in Ontario Canada?  I have tried googling and cannot find the answer.

2670,should i keep my carboy at current fermentation temp after moving from 75F+ to 68F?,"I brewed an amber ale kit on Sunday (my second time brewing at all). Using white labs wlp008. I left the carboy upstairs and the fermentation was very rapid and extremely active for two days reaching temps of 75F+.   I moved the carboy to my basement thinking that this was to hot and now am at 68F. My question is   A) should I have moved it at all? looking at this previous question ""Temperature swing of 10+ degrees during fermentation"" makes my wonder if those high fermentation temps going to affect diacetyl levels (referring to Brandons answer) or if the cooling drop moving it to the basement is going to produce acetaldehyde's (referring to Bakas answer) I know that was about a porter but maybe it still applies. And B) should I leave it at the current 68F or move it back up to the higher temp?   Also what kind of off flavors might I expect to see due to these temps (I am still trying to figure out exactly what these ""off flavors"" taste like). "
2671,How long do I have to finish a keg once it's been tapped?,"I have a kegerator setup with CO2 and a tap.  Once a keg has been put into the kegerator, how long will it stay good?  What can I do to ensure that I get the longest life possible out of a keg once it's been tapped?  Is there some way (aside from the flavor changing) to know that it's gone bad?  Is the answer to this question different for homebrew kegs than for commercial kegs? "
2672,Yeast Starter Steps,"I want to make a yeast starter for a lager.  I even went out and got a 3000 ml Erlenmyer Flask.  According to mrmalty.com's calculator I need 506 Billion cells.  With the two vials of White Labs yeast it says I need 3.34 Liters of wort. 1)I've searched but can't seem to find clear instructions on stepping up a starter. I understand the procedure, but what wort volumes would I need to have for a two step starter? OR 2) should I just do this starter in a growler and leave my new erlenmyer flask sitting in the box until next time? "
2673,Do you use a default/standard base malt? What are the advantages?,"Does anyone use a standard base malt to build your recipes from? What are the advantages?  A couple of obvious advantages would be having the ability to buy large bags of the base malt (and ensuring that it's still fresh when you use it) and having a consistent base to build from.  I've always built my recipes using different base malts for flavor. For example, if I want a malty British style beer, I tend to use Maris Otter as my base. If I brew a Belgian beer, I use a Belgian pale or pils as the base. Etc.  I've been thinking about trying to convert all of my recipes to use a readily-available pale malt (e.g. Briess), but trying to match the flavor profiles provided by the other base malts has prevented me from doing so thus far.  The thing that has stopped me is that I have dozens of recipes I've brewed multiple times and adjusted for taste and a good 5 or so that I'm already extremely satisfied with (I'd say that I've ""perfected"" them but that's not possible when you like experimenting as much as I do). "
2674,Should steeping grains be crushed differently than mashing grains?,Looking at the process for steeping grains I see that it omits a vorlauf.  Would crushing steeping grains in the same way as mashing grains produce too much fine particulate?  Should wort from steeping grains be filtered in a process like vorlauf (either in purpose or practice)? 
2675,What are the pros and cons of adding specialty grains to the mash?,"When all-grain brewing, you typically add all your grains to the mash, right?  Is there ever a time when you leave some of the specialty grains out and steep them instead?  What are the pros and cons of mashing everything versus leaving some grains out of the mash and steeping them? "
2676,What is the danger zone for overcarbonating and making bottle bombs?,"Just curious how many volumes of CO2 most average beer bottles can hold.  Is there a rough number where alarms should start going off?    Update -- I'm seeing in different carbonation calculators that some styles suggest being carbonated to close to 5.0 volumes.  If that is the upward limit, should most bottles be able to handle that? "
2677,Tasting my uncarbonated beer: Bitter.,"OK, so I'm now bottling my first batch. I opened the primary fermenter (did not use a secondary) and I've racked the beer to the bottling container. It smells hoppy and delicious. I'm pleased.  I taste just a bit before I begin to bottle... and it tastes... bitter. Sort of burned maybe.   I know (now) I didn't do a good enough job pouring the wort off the trub - I definitely left too much trub in the fermenter. Is that the reason? Will it mellow as it bottle conditions? Should I trash the whole batch?  I'm bummed and looking for some direction - I appreciate any thoughts. "

2681,Barrel fermenting (white) wine. Questions and assumptions,"I am wondering if it is possible to barrel ferment white grapes/wine. I can only find information on the web about red wines.   In regards to this process I have some questions and assumptions; I hope someone here can help me with this.  Am I correct to assume that barrel fermenting also adds color to the end product? Do people here know of commercial wines that do this?  And if it is possible, what are the steps to go from primary fermentation to malolactic fermentation when barrel fermenting a white wine? Do I need to rack it? Can I just take out the skins and leave the rest in the barrel?  Thanks in advance,   Sidney de Koning "
2682,Pink (or salmon) colored colonies on foam in starter flask,"I noticed several small pink colonies  on the foam of a second stage starter that I made from recovered yeast (originally Gigayeast: GY 054) that was mixed with 25% glycerin and frozen. They were not fuzzy as might be expected for a mold or mycelial species. I've done some research on the Web and PubMed in particular and have found two genera of wild yeast that might be responsible:  Rhodotorula and Sporobolomyces. I didn't find any representations that these were feared contaminants in beer and decided to pitch the starter but also decided to attempt making a second batch with similar ingredients using fresh GY 054 to make another 1L starter. I'll keg them both in a few weeks and report back, but in the meantime I'm wondering if anyone else has experienced the same issue?  "
2683,Brewing with bread yeast,"recently bought northern brewer irish ale and yeast was misplaced. can I use bakers yeast? Also, how long will wort last before adding yeast? "
2684,Can I use oxygen tablets or liquid oxygen to oxygenate my water for yeast fermentation in mead?,"I see 'bait buddies' and 'liquid oxygen' supplements. Can I use these to oxygenate the water to give the yeast nutrients when starting mead fermentation? None of them  really say the actual ingredients. Do they leave behind additives? Are they food safe for humans? I imagine the 'liquid oxygen' supplement is, but that product description uses words in an entirely different way from their normal meanings. Liquid oxygen is freezing cold. If it means oxygenated water, how does it not degas during shipping? How many drops would I need for 5 gallon fermentation?  [website]What about magnesium oxide? I know magnesium is safe to drink. Does the oxygen dissolve in the water? "
2685,Why is oxygen bad for mead?,"I see comments on YouTube about how oxygen is bad for mead. However, according to Wikipedia, oxygen is good for yeast to develop resistance to alcohol.   [website]  Yeasts are facultative anaerobes meaning that they can exist in both the presence and absence of oxygen. While fermentation is traditionally thought of as an anaerobic process done in the absence of oxygen, early exposure of the yeast to oxygen can be a vital component in the successful completion of that fermentation. This is because oxygen is important in the synthesis of cell ""survival factors"".   What is wrong with aerating a fermenter or introducing oxygen during racking? Won't that strengthen the yeast for secondary fermentation? "
2686,Brewing ginger beer and over carbonation,"I've been trying to make ginger beer and the first attempt bombed, for some reason. I'm not clear if it's because of residual bleach, or tap water at the wrong point, or what. I was about to give up and toss the ginger bug out when I saw it was relentlessly fizzing so I gave it another shot.  I bottled the 4L of mixture (with 200ml of Ginger Bug) into flip-top bottles. Twenty four hours later I wanted to check the carbonation, so I opened the first bottle. It blew the cap right off and dumped about half the bottle's contents on the floor. The other three bottles were pretty much the same, although I managed to open them more carefully.  My question is - what can I do to avoid this in the future? This is the first thing I've ""brewed"" - is there some equipment specifically to address this problem? Some jug with a pressure valve?   Does releasing the built up pressure in a bottle harm the carbonation of the beer? I know opening a bottle of coke will make it go flat, eventually. How is it different for ginger beer? "
2687,"Beer Bottle vs. Can Head Space, Carbonation, and Conditioning","I have brewed at least a couple hundred 5-gallon batches of ale over the last 20+ years. For the vast majority of these batches, I have kegged in corny kegs and force carbonated using 30 PSI and shaking for a few minutes, or more often in the last 10 years, by setting the regulator at ~12 PSI for a week.  For the last 3-4 years, I have been bottling more batches for a few reasons:   It is easier to send home with friends. I can have more variety (not restricted to the two kegs that fit in the beer fridge). I served 7 different styles in bottles at last year's New Years Day open house. I can vary the carbonation of each batch more easily (to match properly match the style). This is an issue when I serve from kegs because I have one regulator and therefore one pressure setting for my two kegs. I don't have to run down to the basement (where the beer fridge lives) every time I want another beer; instead, I can have a few bottles in the kitchen fridge.   When bottling, I use 22-ounce bomber bottles. I prime a 5 gallon batch with, usually, 3.0-3.5 ounces (depending on style) of dextrose (boiled in a small volume of water, well-mixed with the beer in the bottling bucket). I fill the bottles with a half-inch diameter, spring-tipped bottling wand, such as this one. I fill the bottle until it is completely full or overflows just a little. When the filler is withdrawn, it leaves the perfect amount of head space in the bottle. In other words, the volume of the bottling wand up to the height of the bottle is a good match for the desired head space. I let the bottles carbonate for at least 7-10 days at room temperature.  I recently acquired a can seamer and 16-ounce cans (type 211 with 202 lids).  My questions:   Should I adjust the amount of priming sugar for 16-ounce cans vs. what works for me with 22-ounce bottles in order to achieve the same level of carbonation in the glass? Should I adjust how I decide that the package is full when filling a can? In other words, does the cross-section of the filling wand times the height of a 16-ounce can create the right head space volume in the can?  "
2688,Does cold crashing have a negative impact?,"According to ""How to Brew"" by John Palmer (4th ed.), cold conditioning (a.k.a. lagering) is the act of cooling beer after fermentation has completed (including maturation) in order to clarify the beer. So far so good.  The book also suggests to slowly decrease the temperature (down to 1 °C/day!) to avoid thermal shock on the yeast:     The point of slow cooling is to prevent thermal shock of the yeast and subsequent excretion of fatty acids and other lipids. These lipids can interfere with head retention and will readily oxidize, creating stale flavors. Thermal shock at any time can cause the yeast cells to release protein signals that cause other yeast cells to shut down to protect against the cold, potentially leading to premature flocculation and underattenuation.   However, everyone seems to cold crash, and I did not find other sources supporting this claim. Is there any evidence? Am I missing something?  I am also not sure whether this would also be relevant for pitching temperature since, for instance, the rehydration temperature for dry yeast is usually higher than fermentation temperature.  ... last but not least, such method definitely makes the overall process 1-2 weeks longer, which is pretty annoying.

2691,Final gravity too high,"I have an IPA that I've brewed in five gallon batches before. OG at 1.065 and FG at 1.010. Those were hydrometer readings.  I scaled it down for a one gallon batch, and pitched half a packet of yeast (Safale US-05) instead of a full packet. My OG was 1.060 using a refractometer, but my FG is reading 1.041 after 2.5 weeks of fermentation.  Is something throwing the refractometer off? I haven't had this issue before.  Maybe I under-pitched? But half a packet of yeast for a one gallon should be plenty, right?  Thanks. "
2692,How is alcohol-free beer manufactured? Can one make it at home?,"I have recently found that some alcohol free beers such as German hefeweissbiers like Weihenstephaner Hefeweisbier Alkoholfrei, and BrewDog Nanny State taste pretty ok, actually. I have also found that some other alcohol free beers are heavily unbalanced and are practically undrinkable.  About the only drawback of these alcohol-free beers is that they cost quite a lot; the cost with taxes is the same as the cost of beer with 5% ABV, and the taxes where I live are high for alcoholic drinks!  How are the good tasting alcohol free beers manufactured? Is the alcohol in the beer somehow removed in an industrial process, or do they just use less malt so that the alcohol concentration remains below 0.5%?  Can one reasonably make alcohol-free beer that tastes good at home? Where I live, distilling high-alcohol-content drinks is illegal, and if the process to make an alcohol-free beer is to just distill the alcohol away, it might be pretty risky to own the equipment for that... (Well, ok, if the purpose is to just get rid of the alcohol, you don't need all of the distilling equipment, simply boiling it at a controlled temperature would work.) "
2693,Wine blending from different years,"As a home winemaker, I try to focus on one varietal per year.  This allows me to do the harvest, crush, press and all associated cleaning only ONCE per year in the fall.  But it does limit my blending abilities only getting one varietal.  I currently have ~50gal of 2018 Merlot, and am considering either (a) bottling it as is soon or (b) getting ~50gal of Cab this fall and blending it all 50/50 next summer ... 🤔  I found this article by Ed Kraus:     Blend wines that are from the same year. Blending wines from different years, in general, does not work as well. Wines blended from different years seem to have more instances of precipitation. These types of blends also seem to pull the older vintage back to a youthful harshness even though it might have been almost at its ultimate age for consumption.   Is it bad to do blending of wine in two consecutive years like this? Is one year ok?  Anybody with experience with this? How did the wine turn out?  Thanks! "

2696,Pasteurizing Apple Juice for Cider,"I'm an experienced Beer home brewer, but I've never done a Cider and would like to try. I've bought natural pressed apple juice from a farm near me, it's free of preservatives, and thus is chilled to be drunk soon. It's reasonably sweet (not tart) and may already have sugar added for sweetness. It's very clear clean apple juice and awesome to drink.  I've bought CBC-1 Yeast and some Nutrivin Yeast nutrient for the fermentation. I'm most worried about contaminants in the apple juice, i.e. will probably contain many natural yeasts as well that will also attempt to ferment it.  Will I spoil the apple juice by pasteurizing it before cooling and pitching yeast (i.e. first heating to 75'C - 167'F)?  Should I even try pasteurizing it? "
2697,Can methanol be formed when brewing a rice wine?,"Most people consider home wine brewing safe, regarding the methanol dose that is being produced.  Wikipedia mentions 2012 methanol poisoning incident in Cambodia, caused by drinking home-made rice wine contaminated by methanol.  How did it happen? Does the rice contain pectins (like in grapes or berries) which are responsible for methanol formation? Or the incident was rather caused by the addition of extra (unprofessionally distilled) alcohol contaminated by methanol? "

I went out of town for the weekend and noticed my carboy stopper and airlock about three feet away on the floor. Beer looks like it may be contaminated... thoughts on what to do?   Could I add some campden drops or reboil? Or is it ruined? 
2699,Is phenol production temperature related or not?,"It is well known that ester formation in beer is mainly a factor of temperature. Higher fermentation temperatures produce more esters. (Other factors play a role as well, such as the yeast's genetic proclivity to ester formation, pitching rates and dissolved oxygen (DO) levels, but if these are considered equal, temperature is the primary controlling factor.)  Lately I have been brewing some Belgian ales with POF+ Belgian yeasts, which causes me to wonder: is the formation of spicy phenols also temperature-related?  (Once again other factors in POF formation play a role here, the most well-known one being the presence of ferulic acid in Weizen worts, which is decarboxylated into  4-Vinyl guaiacol during fermentation. However, this phenol is only a minor one among the desirable volatile spicy phenols typically produced by Belgian yeasts.)  I understand that phenols are produced early in the fermentation cycle, whereas esters are produced later from fatty acids and higher alcohols. However, Belgian fermentations typically start cool in order to keep the higher alcohols in check and prevent a ""hot"" or harsh alcohol character, and are then ramped up. Pitching warm and starting the fermentation warm can create an excess of sharp and ""hot"" fusels but I haven't noticed an increase in spicy phenols in these cases. Which suggests that the formation of these spicy notes in POV+ yeasts is not significantly temperature related.  Is this correct?  If so, what factors govern the amount of volatile spicy phenols in Belgian ales and how might they be manipulated to vary the amounts of volatile spicy phenols produced? "
2700,Why does stirring the wort lead to swirls and bubbling?,"I'm a beginner brewer, but I've noticed that on every batch I've done so far, when the wort is boiling, and I stir the wort, it ends up behaving this way. Can anyone explain why this happens? "
2701,"Clean kegged, put back together wrong","I recently brewed my second batch of 2x 5 gallon beers. The first time, kegs were recently reconditioned and so I did a quick clean and filled them up. This time, being some time later, I went ahead and took both ball lock reconditioned corny kegs apart and put them back together.  First batch went smoothly, and is all gassed up and tasting delicious. The second batch is now an issue.  I kegged it about 2+ weeks ago, and connected the gas line around 13-14 psi. I went in this weekend to taste test, and make sure all was well. It wasn't.   The problem seems to be, from lack of knowledge, that I flipped the posts when putting it all back together. I wasn't able to get the picnic black beer quick connect to go onto the post. I tussled and thought, then noticed that the out post looked taller than the in post.   Acting smart I unscrewed the faucet adapter from the quick connect, and swapped it with the gas in quick connect (after taking them apart and assuming the are nearly identical.  That seems to all fit better, although the colors are 'backwards'.  However, now the beer seems carbonated, but is coming out at a rate not befitting of beer, something more like a pint in minute.   My wedding is this weekend, I was hoping to serve both beers at the reception.   To summarize the questions/problems: Are the posts different only in height? Are the quick connects different only in that same manner? Should that have worked? What's causing the slow dispense?  How boned am I?  Many many thanks in advance. "
2702,Questions about adding vanilla,I'm on my third brew.  Midwest brewing irish red in bottles Midwest brewing brown nut ale in secondary   Just bought Brewers Best milk stout.  I pretty much wanted to be a little creative without going overboard and do an all grain recipe.  So I am looking for a little help. I want this to be a vanilla stout so I guess in this case it will be a vanilla milk stout.  Should I use vanilla beans or vanilla extract? How much? Should I use in the boil or in the secondary? Has anyone used vanilla paste instead of vanilla beans or vanilla extract?  If you could walk me through this a little bit again only my 3rd brew! I don't even know if my other ones turned out haha. I have tasted them along the way and they taste fine but I won't be satisfied until I drink a fully carbed beer and get a buzz!  Thanks in advance! 
2703,Using two kit cans should I use both yeast packets and how much sugar,I have seen some people online using two kits to make one 23L batch of beer with more flavor than a single kit.  If you use one kit to make 23L you add the yeast supplied with it and 1kg of dextrose sugar.   Would you add both packets of yeast for adding two kits to make 23L? Also how much sugar would you add?  The kits I am talking about are coopers kits. 
2704,"What does a good crush look like, and does it matter if grains are overcrushed if batch sparging?","I am looking for some advice on what a good crush looks like, and whether it matters on my system. The opinions and pics online are all over the place on this.  Background: I am buying small-batch all-grain kits at my LHBS, and the grains come pre-crushed. I am pretty new to all-grain. I batch sparge in a two-gallon cooler, using a paint strainer bag instead of a false bottom or bazooka screen. The crushed grains have mostly whole husks separated from the kernel, what seems like a lot of flour, and about an 80-20 mix of broken kernels to whole kernels.  Does the crush, especially having a high flour ratio) make a difference if I am batch sparging?  I don't have to worry about stuck sparges, but my wort is very cloudy.  My finished beer is hazy.  I am getting absorbtion of around 0.25 gal./lb., which is around double the 0.13 gal./lb. rate I saw on this forum. (I calculate absorbtion as: [water into mash tun] - [volume of two runnings into boil kettle].  My mash tun has negligible dead space, and I run everything out on the second runnings.) Could the crush explain my higher-than-predicted absorbtion rate?  If it matters in answering my question, my efficiency into the fermenter is around 62-63% on my system using this crushed grain, I don't test pH or my water, I use bottled water, my strike water to grain ratio is 1.5 qts/lb., and I then add my sparge water based on how much more wort I need by measuring first runnings.  Edit: Correction, I misread my notes on what I am collecting.  My absorbtion loss is a hair over one quart per two lbs. of grain, so that is squarely in the .125 gal./lb. that the experts tell us to expect. "
2705,Converting hose size from CO2 tank,"So I am almost done fermenting my first batch of home brew and am about to start kegging it.  The only problem is the current hose coming from the regulator is a good bit wider than the nozzle I have on my homebrew keg.  Is this something that can be fixed somehow, or should I look to replace one of the nozzels?  Does the hose width matter much for delivering the pressure to the keg?  EDIT: connector looks like this:    EDIT: looking back on this question, I notice this picture shows a barb that could be screwed off, mine at the time was not like that, had a particular barb all connected as one piece.

2706,Freezing apples to extract juice,"I have read that, to extract juice from an apple, in place of a juicer you can freeze whole apples, mash them and allow the pectic enzymes to ""do it's work""  Can any offer advice on this method? Is is a good one? Are pectic enzymes okay to use in cider?  "
2707,"What does ""steeping hops"" mean?","In an IPA recipe I came across, a final small addition of hops is supposed to be ""steeped"". What does this mean? Is it just a different way of saying ""add at knockout""?  The recipe is here (""The Immortal""):  [website]"
2708,Why is it common practice to rack off primary for secondary re-fermentation?,"Why is it recommended to perform a secondary fermentation (an actual ""sugars were added to cause a second fermentation"" secondary fermentation) in a secondary vessel, as opposed to fermenting the beer a second time in the primary fermentation vessel?  Is there an advantage to doing something like adding fruit or sugar to the wort when it's not on the primary fermentation's yeast cake?    Everyone says you should, but never explain why.  This answer comes close, but I'm looking for something a bit more verifiable than ""I think"". "
2709,Knocking out the barrier between fridge and freezer?,"I have a fridge freezer combo that I am going to convert to a serving fridge. I have done this with an old fridge before but decided to upgrade when I moved because it was really old and crapping out.  Question: What will happen if I cut out the majority of the barrier between the fridge and freezer? I'm concerned about everything freezing, or over/under using the refrigeration unit.  Why: 2 reasons, first I really want my taps at a reasonable height, second, I really think the extra height would reduce the clutter of beer and gas lines and make everything easier to manage.  Notes: I really don't want to use a secondary temp controller, will the fridge's temp controller work ok?  The Fridge I Have: [website]"
2710,Are exposed threads in a boil kettle a problem?,"I'm currently putting together a new boil kettle, and am planning to use 1/2"" NPT threaded fittings attached to a welded coupler. I've seen a lot of designs which have exposed threads and teflon tape inside the kettle, which sounds unsanitary to me.  Are exposed threads an issue? And if so, what can be done about them? Soldering? Or, is it possible to get parts that will make a seal with a coupler without exposing threads? "
2711,How do you brew high alcohol beers at home?,"I've heard that brewing anything over around 14% ABV is pretty much impossible…and that achieving anything over 11% in a homebrew environment is not very realistic.  Is this true?  If so, how do they make beers like the Samuel Adams Utopias? "
2712,Do hops reduce the carbonation in beer,"Does dry hopping reduce the amount of carbonation that a beer has compared to the same beer that isn't dry hopped?   I have a larger that I have made before that seems to have less carbonation that it normally has and the only difference I have is the addition of Wakatau hops.  Should I increase the priming sugar when bottling?  EDITED  Brewing details:-   20/10/2013 Muntons Premium Larger 23L, Added extra cup of sugar at fermenting stage to have a higher OG reading.

2714,"Noob here... My second brew - am I brewing an ale or a lager, and did I stuff it up?","So I went to my local homebrew store to purchase a an ""Aussie honey lager"" extract kit but they were out of stock. The friendly man behind the counter helped me to re-create this kit by checking their files for what came in this kit. This is what I got:   ""Beermakers"" lager extract kit 1.7kg tin ""Beer kit converter"" pack for making lagers, consisting of a 1kg bag of powder (a mix of maltose, dextrose, maltodextrin, malted barley) and a 10g packet of Golden Cluster hop pellets SAFLAGER S-23 yeast 11.5g packet, refrigerated 25g packet of Citra hop pellets for dry-hopping 500g of pure honey (of which I only used 250g)   The problem is, because I didn't buy the kit as a whole, I didn't get the specific instructions for this recipe kit. Instead I had multiple sets of instructions (the ""beer kit converter"" pack came with some instructions, the tin of extract had instructions on it, and the yeast also had some guidelines as to temperatures etc, and lastly I had a look at some extract kit recipes online that use honey to figure out at what point to add the honey). This is what I ended up doing:  Heated 3L of water in 7L pot on gas stove. Dissolved 1 kg ""Beer kit converter"" powder, followed by 250ml honey and 2 tsp cinnamon powder for a hint of spice. Brought to boiling point as per instructions that came with ""beer kit converter"", added 10g Golden Cluster hop pellets and boiled for 2-3 minutes. Left pot for 15 minutes in kitchen sink in cold water to bring temperature down a bit.  Heated up can of Beermakers lager extract, emptied into fermenter. Rinsed can with boiled water. Added wort from pot to fermenter, stirred vigorously. Added can of hot water with remaining extract and stirred vigorously. Topped up with room temperature water to 21L mark, and stirred thoroughly. Pitched 11.5g of Saflager S-23 yeast at 24-26 degrees C. The OG reading was 1046.   Here's my problem: I've struggled to keep the temperature consistently low (the yeast pack recommended 12-15 degreees C but I've had it fluctuating between 18 and 22 degrees C). The packet did specify that you can pitch and ferment at room temperature when using a single packet, or at the cooler temperature when using two packets. It started bubbling away nicely fairly soon, but within 24 hours it started to emit a ""rotten eggs"" smell which I believe is sulphur hydroxide or something. It wasn't very bad at first, and I read on reddit homebrewing that this is often a normal by-product of fermentation, but it's been more than 72 hours since I pitched the yeast and it is still producing a LOT of stinky gas. So much so that I've moved it to my garage as it was getting pretty bad! This is also not good for keeping temperature consistent (early summer in Melbourne, Australia - not too hot yet but will get hot soon). I've also noticed that there's a very small layer of foam/krausen on top, no more than 1-1.5cm. My previous extract brew produced a few inches of froth/krausen.   So, is the rotten eggs smell something to worry about? And can someone tell me, am I brewing a lager (hence should I properly lager this brew at low temperatures for a long time) or am I brewing a lager-style ale which can ferment and condition at more mild temperatures (18 - 22 degrees C)?  Please help - really want to know how to make the most of this brew! Thanks! "
2715,"As a benchmark, how much grain (and water) would be used to make one litre (or 100L) of wort?","Obviously the style of beer, type of grain (barley, wheat, etc) and depth of roast would make a difference.  But in general what would be the typical ranges be?  So for example:   For a Dark Stout: A kg of grain plus X litres of water gives one litre of wort For a Pale Ale:   B kg of grain plus Y litres of water gives one litre of wort   If you give imperial measurements (lbs Gal) I can covert them no problem.  (Bonus points: And when and why would you deviate from that?) "
2716,Foam Overflow - Residue on Carboy walls,"I recently brewed up a Caribou Slobber from Northern Brewing. I had a foam over, I sanitized a new stopper, air lock and resealed the carboy. Now I have no bubbles in my airlock, and all of the sediment is on the walls of the carboy and not on top of the wort (so it is not touching the wort and therefore will not fall to the bottom). Is my brew okay? Its been over a week of this, should I transfer to secondary carboy for secondary fermentation?  thanks,  Dan "
2717,Lack of head/foam/carbonation in my beer,"I've been brewing wine for a few years now but only just recently turned to beer. I've just finished (as in ""consumed"") my first brew and have now got my second one on the go.  Both of my brews are extract/hops type brew. I've done a lot of reading around the subject and dipped into various forums and I think I pretty much understand the whole hopping process and such... however there are a few things I can't find clear answers for... hence my appearance here.  My first brew, a dark ale, tasted really good but didn't have much of a head. I'll explain how I brewed it - perhaps someone can explain if I did anything wrong?   Boiled up the extract (2 standard tins) with about 80g of hops in as much water as I could get on my stove top. Put the extract in my 5 gallon primary fermenter (not a pressure barrel) and topped up to 5 gallons with boiled water. Added a 20g hop bag into the primary fermenter Added yeast when the brew was about room temperature about 36 hours later primary fermentation started... bubbling away nicely after 48 hours. I'm in the UK so I needed to wrap the barrel in blankets - I kept the temperature at around 20oC fairly well. When fermentation had pretty much finished I siphoned off into a sterilised 5 gallon pressure barrel (no CO2 cannister. Made sure it was quite splashy when I did it. I primed it with about a cupful of sugar and lidded up the barrel. After another couple of days I was tapping off nice pints of dark ale under reasonable pressure (at least I thought it was reasonable pressure - it might not have been) but with no head. I'd only tap a max of 4 pints a day for my wife and me... perhaps 6 tops. After another 2 or 3 days I was beginning to get at least a thin layer of small bubbles sitting on top of the pint but nothing approaching a head, as such.   So, with my second brew (a light malt/wheat hoppy brew) on the go in my primary 5 gallon bucket (with air trap - not pressurised) I want to try and get a better head. I got the brew going yesterday and by this morning it was bubbling vigorously. I've added extra sugar so it's going to be about a 6.5% brew and I want to put it in my pressure barrel. How and when would I be best to do this, and is there anything else I can do to improve the head?  Thanks for reading and even more thanks for helping! :) "
2718,How to know if a bucket is good for fermentation,"I bought a bucket on craigslist that was for fermentation. When I got it, it looks like a mess and has no labels on it.

2719,Why doesn't FG reach 1.000?,"My second beer brew has pretty much finished its primary fermentation. It started at 1.044 and is currently at 1.014... I don't expect it will go much further.  Having brewed numerous wines I understand that yeasts are capable of getting as high as 15% alcohol by volume before starting to be killed by the very alcohol they are making.  By my reckoning this beer brew is currently sitting at approximately 4% but clearly there is quite a bit of sugar left in the brew for the FG to be over 1.014.  Reading around, it appears that this is perfectly normal - pretty much all beers finish well above 1.000.  So... Why does fermentation stop before all the sugar is used up?  Additionally, how do you determine a 'target' FG? Is this something I can do? At the moment I'm still doing extract brews but would like to move on to grains before too long. "
2720,How do I use freeze distillation to turn cider into applejack?,"In my country obtaining a bottle of applejack is about impossible, while cider slowly gains some foothold. I have managed to obtain a few liters of apple cider for reasonable price and happen to have a decent quality freezer. I'd like to use freeze-concentration to produce some applejack from it, to have a glass of the legendary drink.   I know the ground theory of how that process is supposed to work, but I don't know any details. What is the right temperature? What kind of container should I use? Should it be covered/airtight to prevent alcohol evaporation? How much ice should I allow to form before removing it? Any special techniques of removing the ice? Also, I heard some account that you keep the ice and discard the liquid - is there any truth to that? "
2721,properly carbonating my Irish stout,"I have just kegged my stout. The fridge currently isn't on, should be powered tomorrow. I've put the co2 up to 25psi to start.

2722,Mr Beer Fermentor Leaking,"Found an old Mr Beer kit that had never been used. The malt and yeast that came with the kit had expired, so I bought replacements. I followed the directions in the booklet, and put the fermenter in a cabinet.   When I checked a few hours later, a small amount of liquid, maybe half an ounce, was coating the bottom of my cabinet. I put the fermenter on a rimmed cookie sheet, and it is still leaking very slowly, less than an ounce a day.   Should I just toss it? Wait until bottling and see if it's bad? Should I try to fix it somehow? The leak is very slow, so it's hard to tell where it's coming from, and I don't want to mess with it too much.  "

2724,Formulating a recipe,"Can anyone guess at how to build a clone recipe? Its for Duclaws Sweet Baby Jesus, a friend requested a clone. Their website only says it's a Black beer, a Chocolate Peanut Butter Porter. Their website only lists the types of grains and hops, but not the amounts. I'm guessing there would be various adjuncts, probably both in the boil and ""dry hopping"" with the coffee (I've done dry coffee grounds before). I'm not sure where the peanut butter flavor would come from though. I can probably guess at the hops, but the grains is where I'd need help, and the peanut butter, that is a mystery to me.  From the website     ...jet black in color with a tan, rocky head, full body and creamy,   luxurious mouthfeel. Its lightly sweet, malty flavor is accented by   rich flavors of chocolate, coffee and peanut butter, and balanced by a   subtle hop character and moderate 6.5% abv.

2725,First time steeping!,"I was advised by my LHBS that if I steep 500g of Carapils in 2L of water (for a 23-25L batch) at around 68°C, then use this as part of my boil, then I will have more body and head retention in my beer.  Is this method correct?  Do I use this 2L of water as part of the 11L to be boiled or do I add it to 9L of boiled water to reach the 11L boil size and then proceed as normal?  I use recipe builders as much as possible - do I need to worry about steeping efficiency when I am not trying to create fermentables? "

2727,Is there a way to tell if fruit flies have laid eggs?,"I am going cross-eyed trying to tell if there are fruit fly larvae on the walls of my continuous brew kombucha. I have seen fruit flies on the outside, but I don't think they can get in through the two towels and rubber band sealing the top.   I assumed that the specks I saw on the walls were just bits of tea and bubbles, but after doing some research I got a little paranoid. I set a trap to deter fruit flies so I'm not worried about more (if any) infiltration, but how can I know if there are fruit flies inside? Would I just have to wait for them to mature and see if I have fruit flies buzzing around inside after some amount of time?    The scoby is seen at the bottom of the picture. There is a distinct line of bubbles. That isn't what I'm worried about; that's normal. What I am concerned with is the specks stuck to the wall that aren't touching the scoby.  "
2728,Dry Hopping Question,"I am super new to brewing but extremely ambitious. I just have a dry hop question so I hope you see this. So I'm currently fermenting a double IPA with Columbus for bittering and Cascade for aroma. Well i'm a huge fan of citrus in my IPAs and I want to dry hop with 2 oz Citra and 2 oz Cascade to bring up my hop aroma. The question is, I am waiting until i rack to secondary, but I want to just drop the pellets into the carboy without a bag since its a narrow neck glass 5 gal. When would you recommend throwing the hops in since i wont be able to extract them. I am going to filter on my racking cane when i siphon into bottling bucket. Can I just toss them in, and rack on top of them from the primary? Should I wait until the last week in the secondary? Should I rack into secondary, pitch the hops in and seal it up for the entire 14 days? Hope someone can help! "
2729,"Must won't ferment, too sour?","I prepared a must for a mead last weekend (recipe below) and after a whole week there has been no fermentation activity. I took a pH reading and it came in at 4.4 - is it likely that the must is simply too acidic for the yeast? I added a teaspoon of CaCO3 and stirred it in - got a small fizz - so will wait and see if that works. Should I re-pitch more yeast?  16L mineral water 4kg cherry blossom honey 4kg peeled, stoned, and pasteurised lychees 11g US-05  I pitched the yeast at 20 degrees, after aerating the cooled must. There's 20L of must in 2x10L fermentors. I added 1tsp of yeast nutrient in each fermentor, along with 1tsp of pectic enzyme and 1tsp of tartaric acid. When fermentation hadn't started after 2 days I prepared a yeast starter with another 11g of US-05 and the starter was fine, so I know the yeast was healthy when I pitched.  Any suggestions gratefully received. "
2730,Brewing a 1860-1890 IPA,"My wonderful wife bought me a book on the history of IPAs for Christmas, which I have read a couple of times. This book has some extracts from old brew logs regarding the proportions of malts and quantities of Hops to use. Equally for primary fermentation I intend to use a London Ale Yeast.  But, this is where I have been debating what to do. It mentions that these IPAs were matured in large oak vats, and we all know were transported over seas. They that these vats were likely to have Brett and other wild yeasts.   Any better ideas how I should go about replicating this secondary fermentation? I was thinking to chuck into the secondary Brett + 1'' oak cubes.  Also, how concerned should I be about infecting my basement with Brett or similar wild bugs?  And, anything any of you wish you had been told before you did your first Brett/Wild/Lambic brew? "

2737,Heat spreaders on electric elements,"I use electric kettle and hlt, the issue I keep having is that the brews keep coming out darker than I want. This went unnoticed when brewing stouts and bitters, but I have tried a couple of very pale summer ales and a light pilsner, all of which came out a touch too dark.  I have been scratching my head and I was wondering if it is the concentrated heat of the elements caramlising the sugars?  Then if a heat spreader on the element would help, and if it would how would I go about making one?   Any hints?  "
2738,American Stout addition Suggestions,"Brewed a really nice American Stout last night. notes of chocolately roasted coffee all throughout. the predicted abv was 6% according to kit which i followed to a T, but as i was taking my OG i dropped the hydrometer and it broke. My question is, similar to dry hopping (im not going to dry hop) what are some post fermentation additions some people do. And, since they most likely are not antimicrobial, how can I sanitize them before adding to my carboy? Was considering cocoa and/or whole coffee bean. It's a 5 gallon batch and I don't want to over do it on any flavors, so quantity recommendations are welcome too.  Secondary question: is there a way to find my abv now that I missed the OG?  thanks, you guys are helping me tremendously.  "
2739,i want a keg cooler that is cheaper than kegerator,"Looking into buying a 5 gal ball lock keg, i have the Co2 tanks, a tap, and gauges/hoses. I want to save by just purchasing something to keep it all cool. Strapped on cash at the moment but want to keg. Dont have the $450 at my disposal right now. Any alternatives? literally have everything but the keg and a something to keep it consistently cold. ideas? experiences? or just save my money. "
2740,Help! Started my lager at 16degs C for 3 days (instead of 14C) - ESTERS!,"Good day!  Brewing a Czech pilsner OG 1.046 (brought it down from 1.056) Yeast: Wyeast 2278 (1 litre starter) - 10-14 degs range 22L batch  My temperature control on my fridge said 14degs but a belated check confirmed 16degs, which would explain the very vigorous fermentation throwing off a lot of sulphur.   I've corrected it down to 14 degs after 3 days.  What is the recommendation to try and counter balance the ester formation:   Should I go lower to 10-12C stepwise? Should I bring fwd / delay my D-rest? Keep to normal practise and lager longer? Just chill out and accept it's a fruity lager that will be perfectly ok to drink just not win any prizes....   thanks! Aran "
2741,Minimal neccesary time in primary/seconday for a barleywine-braggot,"I am still rather beginner (so far a couple of batches), but for the last batch I have taken a brave (irresponsible) step and went for a barley wine-braggot beer. For batch of 22 l In have used +- 6 kg of pale extract, 1 kg of specialty grains (crystal + a bit of chocolate malt) and after 3 days added 2 kg of pasteurized honey into the primary. Fermented with Magrove's Jack Newcastle yeast, keeping it at 19-20 degrees. rack it into secondary for another month and then bottle - but it was based partly on reading, partly on guess. As I am reading into it, I am staring to hesitate. The thing is, I have only a plastic secondary (a large thin-walled plastic bottle you can buy water in for a water cooler) and I am not sure, is it better to rack into thin plastic secondary, or go for bottle conditioning?  Also, how long is usually necessary in secondary? I know the longer the better, but when can I more or less expect for the edges to smooth a bit?  Thx for your experience...  Cheers "
2742,Home made copper chiller oxidation,"I am in the process of building a fermentation temperature controller (in the same spirit as the grainfather glycol chiller), the process is mostly done and I am testing the system with water.  The heat exchange is made through a hand-bent copper tubing plunged in the fermentation vessel; the problem is, after a day or two, the water inside the vessel takes a light yellow tint and there is a rust spot at the bottom of the vessel (the chiller touches it).  So my questions are, will this affect the beer? Is there a way to prevent it? I am thinking the yeast will eat the oxygen, preventing oxidation but will it be enough? worst case scenario I'll buy an inox chiller but its a bit against the DIY spirit :)  Thank you for your time! "
2743,Fermentation time for APA with 1.080 OG,"I brewed my first batch (APA) and while boiling I lost way too much water which resulted in higher OG. Expected was 1.050 but I got 1.080. I added Safale US-05 (1 pack) and left it to ferment at 20°C (68°F) for 17 days.  Being impatient, after 17 days of fermentation, I started cold crashing my beer without measuring my FG.  It's now on 3°C (37°F) for 36 hours (it took me 12h to bring it down from 20°C to 3°C) and I plan to leave it like that for another 48h.  After that, I'll go and (try) to bottle it.  My question is, what can I expect? Do you think yeast managed to do it's job in those 17 days? What should I do if my FG is high? Recipe says it should be 1.010 but what would happen if it's a bit higher?  Sorry if there's too much questions. "
2744,Droping beer with Brett in Carboy,"I brewed a Belle-Saison and it's been in a carboy for 1 month now. Someone with a lot of experience told me he once bought a beer with Brett (Beer was ""Orval"") and droped the last 100ml into his fermenter and waited about 40days.  I never brewed a sour and I am more of a scientific approach normaly, but I am curious about this one.  What do you think? Will I get the result I am hoping for? "
2745,Dry Hopping Cider,"I’ve taken to making Cider and quite enjoy it. I now finalize my fermentation (temp controlled) at 1.015Gs before bottling or kegging. In the case of bottling I still prime with sugar and then test after two weeks - once I’m back at 1.015Gs I pasteurize the sealed bottles to halt fermentation. I am interested in hopping my cider now but I’m unsure of the process to follow.  I imagine it’s all dry hopping, but what hops, for how long and at what stage?  Additionally will the final pasteurizing process change the flavor because of the hopping?     What do you do?  "
2746,Graham cracker beer or wine,"How does one go about making a beer or wine with a graham cracker taste?  I was thinking cracked wheat berries and sweetened with honey, but I also heard hefty Amounts of wheat germ and wheat bran are good starts.  Anyone with some experience getting that particular flavor without resorting to extracts? "
2747,Is it wise to dissolve priming sugar or gelatin in water the day before adding it to the beer?,"One of the biggest time consumers I have on bottling day is cooling down the sugar to room temperature. So I have been thinking about sanitizing a small container the day before bottling, dissolve the sugar there, and seal the container. The solution should cool overnight and be ready to add to the bottling bucket the next day.  Is this wise?  And on that note, I was thinking about doing the same for the gelatin I use to clear my beer, so once again, is this wise? "
2748,How do you feel about Swing Top wine bottles?,"The question says it all. I am sure they are great for wines that will be consumed young, but what about for wines you are going to store for longer periods of time? Months, years? "
2749,Ale Popped the Bung,"This is my first brew, so I kinda look at it as a rite of passage, but I had 5 gallons of brown ale fermenting in a 6.5g carboy. The airlock was super active for the first 16-18 hours. Soon after that I came into the closet I was fermenting in to an explosion. Needless to say the carpets ruined in there with a gallon or so of wort and hops spread on my carpet, clothes, and walls.  I moved the ale to another cool location and used a sanitized blow off setup (like I should've from the start if I wasn't such a noob) and it was still active, bubbles every couple of seconds for the rest of that day.  That was 3 days ago and it seems it has quieted down substantially. Yesterday I observed 2 or 3 bubbles. Wasn't watching it closely but just poking my head into the room. Haven't had much time to watch today.  My questions are:   Is this guy ruined? If it is still okay do I really need to wait the 2 weeks for when the kit said it would be ready or should I read the lack of activity as my sign it is done doing what it will do? Is there anything I could do in the current state to make things better for this batch?   I think regardless of what happens I'm going to try this again, if nothing else to prove I can do it.  Thanks for the help, in advanced! "
2750,Why has the Specific Gravity to Potential Alcohol conversions changed?,"Ok, so I have implied but not said outright that I have been making wine for almost 30 years, but what I have also implied but not outright said is that there has been a break in that amateur winemaking career due to a divorce and moving across the country. You might notice some of my questions here, or posts elsewhere on the web were quite prolific, then I disappeared for a few years and I am back again.  Ok so this explains why I am asking this question. Below I am detailing my question.  Previously, I was sweetening my musts to target 1.100 in SG or a little more in order to get a decent ABV at 14-15%. However, for the last few weeks I have been using my hydrometer and noticing that 1.100 now corresponds to closer to 12.5% ABV. I have checked my old books and yes conversion tables ARE what I thought they were, but looking at conversion tables on the internet today show that 1.100 is between 12.3 and 12.7% ABV. What used to be universal appear to not be accurate and what is generally considered universal today doesn't match the past.  What gives? Are hydrometers and conversion tables entering in a calculated error to account for other solids in solution or what? "
2751,How can I make maple bacon mead?,"I never made a beverage with meat in it so I'm a little scared. I think I can bake the bacon to make it crispy, then crumble it into the mead. Will it be safe to sit for a month of fermenting? Is that the best way to make a bacon flavor mead? (I will also put a quart of maple syrup in it.) "
2752,Adding Additional Pumpkin To My Porter,"I'm brewing a extract Pumpkin Porter kit and just transferred from primary to secondary. I tasted it and I could taste the spices but was wondering if it was too late to pumpkin it up a little. Could i add something now, If so what exactly would I add, Caned pumpkin? Or is it already too late?  "
2753,differences acid blend formulation,E.C. Kraus AC190 acid blend for wine making uses the following formulation:   50% Citric acid  25% Malic acid 25% Tartaric acid   LD Carlson acid blend is composed of the following:   40% Citric Acid 50% Malic Acid 10% Tartaric Acid   Is one better than the other? For which type of wine is each blend most suited? And why? 
2754,"Pressure Fermenting an IPA, how long and at what pressure?",I'm using a FermZilla Fermenter I plan on using a pressure fermentation method. This will be the first time doing this I would to get some advice from those who have done this.  length of time under pressure? Temperature while under pressure? 
2755,Balloon-airlock filling up fast,So I’m making some very simple mead (it’s my first time) and I use a balloon on top of my “container” to make sure it doesn’t blow up. But the balloon has already been blown up quite significantly in only about five hours. Is this normal? It seem a bit much?  Too much yeast?  Sorry for not knowing much about this.  Update: Thanks A lot for the help :-) 
2756,Fast secondary fermentation (wine),I put my wine in secondary at 1.025 and in 1 day it was down the 1.002. Why so fast? Did I do something wrong? Do I just let fermentation play out or do I stop it? 
2757,Is it possible to cork screw-top wine bottles?,Do normal corks and normal corkers work with them? Is there a greater risk of breaking the neck of the bottle during corking? 
2758,How does lemon juice ferment into hard lemonade?,"I'm interested in making a hard lemonade after my cider is done, but I'm having a tough time figuring out how the recipes I've found actually work, and what's the best way to ferment lemon juice.  What I'm looking at doing is grabbing some good organic lemon juice from Whole Paycheck, adding some kind of sugar (agave nectar, cane sugar, whatever...), then throwing on yeast and walking away.  From what I've read, yeast like an acidic environment (pH 4.5-5.5), but not as acidic as lemon juice or lemonade (ph 2-3), so I'm confused on how to build my mash if I need to compensate for that.   Is the pH something I really need to worry about when making a hard lemonade? If I add water to bring my pH up, it seems like it will take a ton of water since that's also slightly acidic. Do I need to add something like baking soda to bring my pH up, and to what level? Even if it does ferment without adding anything, will the environment cause unwanted flavors or other effects?   Thanks, Mark "
2759,Corn Sugar Off Flavors,"I know there is a substantial amount of debate regarding whether to use DME or corn sugar or table sugar to bottle prime, but I wanted to ask the question if priming with simple glucose, can perceivable off-flavors be introduced?  I tasted a bit of an IPA I made prior to priming, and i was a clean, neutral, hop-forward with some malt flavor.  Then I bottle-primed and noticed something very similar to other beers I have made.  Its almost a cidery/green apple flavor that other people can't necessarily notice but is unmistakeable to me, and was NOT present prior to me bottling.    The only other possibility is, I will often (and did in this case), add my dissolved sugar syrup to the bottlin bucket AFTER I rack the entire batch to my bottling bucket.  I pour the sugar solution VERY slowly down the side of the bottling bucket to minimize oxidation (but maybe still get some?).  I do this because all of my fermenters/secondaries aren't marked for volume, and I want to be precise in calculating the weight of the priming sugar.  I know that oxidation typically tastes like cardboard though, and not acetaldehyde.    The firkin specialist at a local brewery told me to NEVER prime with corn sugar, and always prime with DME.  He says the former ""just gives it that homebrew flavor"".  However, I've heard that DME can be incredibly imprecise when used for priming.   "
2760,Bottle carbonation - too much priming sugar?,"I posted a question here before about what I decided was an 'extract twang' flavor. I tried a bottle from batch #2 yesterday, and I noticed the same thing. Here's where it gets interesting.  My brew has only been in the bottle about at week so far, and the situation was the same last time I noticed this, so I'm beginning to think that the flavor is potentially from unconsumed priming sugar. Could that be? Also, I found the carbonation level to be just fine, and I'm worried about over-carbonation if there is still priming sugar left.   I had the same fear for my last batch and decided to refrigerate it in order to stop the yeast from carbonating further. This ended up causing around a third of the bottles to be under-carbonated.  So if this is priming sugar related, would I be better off stopping the carbonation now, risking slightly sweet/flat beer, or should I continue letting it rest, and risk bottle bombs? "
2761,When should I hydrate my dry yeast?,"I'm brewing beer tonight (in roughly three hours) and I've decided to try rehydrating my dry yeast instead of throwing it directly into the cooled wort. If I boil a couple cups of water, how long does it usually take to get down to 90 degrees so I can pitch the yeast into it? How long can I keep the yeast in the water? How/when do you guys rehydrate your dry yeast? "
2762,What's causing the recent spike in the price of used Corny kegs?,"Used corny kegs came from the soda industry, but stocks seem to be drying up pretty quickly. Prices have gone up from [tex]50 today (some are asking that just for used kegs.) Outlets that I've previously used don't have any kegs, altough I've managed to find one reseller offering a resonable price. What happens when the supply dries up completely? What's the future in kegging with cornies?  EDIT: I'm looking for tangible, factual answers rather than opinions - alternative systems, estimates of how many used kegs are still to be released and other facts to support investing in a keg system now. "
2763,"Sanitizer sucked back into beer, dangerous?",So I just fermented a 80 Shilling and thought I would try cold crashing for the first time. I dropped it from mid 60's to 38 or so in a 24 hour period and it sucked about 4 cups of sanitizer up the blow off tube and into my 5 gallon batch. The sanitizer was the usual dilution to half ounce per 5 gallons.  couple questions:   Is the beer safe to drink? Can I re-pitch the yeast into another batch or is it damaged? How do you prevent suckback when cold crashing???   Edit: The sanitizer is StarSan. 
2764,"5 gallon recipe calls for 3 gallon wort, rest added. Can I use all 5 to make wort?",Relatively new brewer here. I have a recipe that says to boil three gallons of the water in a five gallon pot (to create the wort). And then later to add in the remaining water. I bought an eight gallon pot. Can I just boil all five gallons of water to create the wort? Or is that bad?  
2765,How fast should I run water through my wort chiller?,"My father-in-law got me a wort chiller for my birthday, one of those copper coil immersion jobs and I'm now putting it to the test.  This is only my second batch of beer, so I'm pretty new at this.  How fast should I be putting water through the chiller?  I've seen elsewhere that folks note that they're done chilling the wort when the water coming out the hose is cool, but mine was never hot.  Should I run the water quickly to put as much through as possible, or slow it down so the water actually has a chance to get hot before coming out the other end?  I'd sorta like to err on the side of using less water since I don't have a good way to capture it and reuse it at the moment, but that's not a huge concern. "
2766,Chilling wort before pitching yeast,"I know it is important to chill wort to &lt;80 before pitching yeast, and that quality of final beer is affected by the speed with which the wort was chilled to this point, and there are various methods of doing this, wort chillers, ice baths etc. The instructions on the extract kit (NB) say when it is cooled, transfer to a container containing 2 gallons of cold water.  My question is, why not keep 2 gallons of water chilled in the fridge, and add this directly to the wort immediately after the boil?  this will cool the wort to pitching temperature immediately, which will surely reduce the risk of issues!?  I use gallon jugs of spring water so there should not be any contaminants in the water.  is there a good reason why i should NOT do this?  i used this method for my last batch and do not detect any issues, but as its so easy i am surprized i have not come across this as a recomended technique (and negate the need for buying a chiller). "
2767,How much effect does light have on fermenting beer?,"If I keep my fermenting beer in my living room, should I cover it with blankets or otherwise keep it out of the light?  I've seen topics on brewing referencing this, but most just settle for ""why take the chance?""  I'm hoping for a little more clarity on the matter. "
2768,Dealing with hot and cold breaks,"I'm curious to hear how folks remove the hot and cold breaks in their brewing process? With the hot break, I try to spoon out as much as I can, but this often feels like fighting the wind.  When it comes to the cold break, I have a tough time determining where the wort ends and the cold break begins. I try to leave as much of the hop sludge left in the bottom of my boil kettle as I can. Is this considered the cold break? "
2769,Any difference in the metal used for a wort chiller?,"I am planning to buy a wort chiller. I have used a friend's, which was copper. Now, online, I see some that are stainless steel.  Is there any real difference between a copper and a stainless steel wort chiller? Reviews online make it seem that homebrewers prefer copper claiming that it is able to cool the wort faster. But there are also conflicting reviews saying the difference is marginal or nil.  Besides the cooling, is there any other consiquence / benefit from either? "
2770,Apricot ale alternative?,"I have the following recipe in my primary fermenter and had planned on making an apricot ale. I have since realized that apricots are far out of season and my two apricot alternatives are A) make a puree out of dried apricots B) use a pre-made wine/beer apricot puree. I really would like to make this homemade and would like to avoid using dried fruits.   My question is: What fruits/additions (preferably in-season/imported and easily found) would go well with the ingredients already fermenting? As an alternative to an apricot ale. I am thinking blueberries or blackberries? I dont want this beer to be overly sweet however.  Any suggestions?  RECIPE 0.25 lbs Midwest Wheat Malt info  1.5 lbs American Caramel 10°L info  4 lbs Liquid Wheat Extract info  3 lbs Liquid Light Extract info  0.5 oz Nugget (Pellets, 13.00 %AA) boiled 60 min. info  0.25 oz Nugget (Pellets, 13.00 %AA) boiled 30 min. info  0.25 oz Nugget (Pellets, 13.00 %AA) boiled 15 min. info  1 tsp.

2771,Priming calculation after cold crashing for a week,"So beer temperature affects residual co2 in beer for priming, the lower the temp the more residual. I've got a Ryepa that I plan on carbing to 2.4 vols of CO2. Its been in a 55 degree closet for 4-5 days, should I use temperature compensation for that current temp of 55 or the 63 degrees it was at before crashing?  For a 5 gallon batch the higher temp actually only adds around .3 ounces of cane sugar....guessing that won't make much of a difference.  I guess a side note, which calculator do you guys find to be more accurate....HBD or NB's calc? Usually there's not much more than a fraction of an ounce difference with HDB being higher. "
2772,Is iodophor ideal for rinse-less sanitization before bottling?,"I was talking to a friend today and complainIng about the clean/bleach/sanitize/rinse process I undergo when bottling. He dug a bottle of iodophor out of a back shelf and asked me to try it out. He said it was sitting there for years and has never used it. This I assumed would be better than rinsing as a final step to avoid re-contaminating my equipment. Not to mention making my cleaning process faster.  The directions say to let drip-dry. So my question is this: For the time it takes for this cold-water iodophor solution to dry is there greater risk of contamination versus rinsing and racking? Also, is there a lifespan to iodophore? I know it breaks down quickly when in solution and exposed to air and there is no exp date on the bottle.  "
2773,Sanitization practices when dry hopping in a muslin bag,"I've had good results, have always done it the same way in recent years, but always question myself when I dry hop.   Weigh-out my pellet hops Scrub my hands with soap an water Drop a weight, a muslin bag and a length of dental floss into my pitcher of StarSan Put my hands into the pitcher for a minute, then pick up the bag Squeeze (hard) on the muslin bag to rid it of most of the StarSan Open the damp bag, drop in the weight and hops Tie the top of the bag closed with the dental floss Pull the plug out of the carboy, drop the bag in (leaving the tail of the dental floss out, so I can retrieve the bag later) Put the plug back in the carboy   Of course I do this when most of the sugars are gone already, the alchol level is up, and there's a lot of dissoved CO2.  And I don't want to get into bag vs no bag discussion, but otherwise, from a sanitization perspective, are there other, possibly better, techniques?  Do some folks not even soak the bag in sanitizer and get away with it? "
2774,Is my koji ready?,"I have been incubating a culture of koji onto steamed rice for about three days.  It has been in a cooler with jars of hot water, keeping the temperature in a range of 80 F to 95 F.  There is a lot of white hairs growing on the koji, as well as some tan/green discoloration.  According to this guide, the green is from koji-kin spores, which are created when the koji is dehydrated (I did not have any humidity source in my cooler).  Most guides describe koji as having a ""cheese like"" smell, this more resembles dirty socks.  Here's what the koji looks like:    Will the spores have any adverse effect on the sake? "
2775,Bottle conditioned brew has condensation,"Is condensation okay in a finished bottle conditioned homebrew? It has been two weeks and I just tested one, it tasted fine but I am curious if that is ok. Also, some of the bottles have some white stuff floating on the top... are those okay to drink? "
2776,Apple juice for hard cider (UK),"I need a recommendation about an apple juice that I can buy in order to make hard cider. I have read that it requires an apple juice without preservatives, but is there anything else I need to look out for?   I live in the UK so If anyone can suggest a suitable apple juice that I can use to make hard cider that is purchasable in the UK? "
2777,Honey Post-Fermentation,"Mosher has a recipe for a honey ginger IPA in Radical Brewing, where you add 2 lbs of honey and candied ginger to a secondary.  Wouldn't this cause bottle bombs or be cloyingly sweet?    I have an awesome honey called Meadowfoam (which literally tastes like vanilla-and-carmel-dipped roasted marshmallows) that I'm itching to use, and I'm not a mead fan (yet).  I used this in a dubbel before (pre-fermentation), and while it mainly fermented out, but gave the beer a FANTASTIC nose (probably linked up well with the dark malts).    I guess my other question is what would be a good style to make with this honey.  Honey Saison?  Summer Honey Blonde?  Pre or post-fermentation?  Again, the aromatics from this stuff are amazing, but the taste is simply out of this world, so I'd like to get some of that in a beer without making (another) 9-10% abv beer that is sessionable for summertime. "
2778,2 Temperature Control Questions - difference in ambient temp; moisture control in chest freezer,"I use a chest freezer with a Brewpad heating element stuck to the inside wall (for warmer fermentations/bottle conditioning), and a single-stage Johnson controller.  Since getting this, I haven't used the freezer's compressor to cool the chamber, only the heating element, as ambient temps in my basement have been in the low 60's, and I haven't done any lagers or overly cold fermentations (yet).  I have my temp controller probe taped to the outside of an Ale Pail/carboy, insulated by scrap styrofoam.  However, since we had a non-winter in Maryland and it is getting warmer, my basement is now right around 70 degrees.    I switched the jumpers on my controller to a 'cooling' setup (""cut-out at setpoint"").  Just last night, I made an extract stout that I want to ferment at 67 degrees.  After getting the temperature inside the chest to around 67, I taped the probe onto the fermenter and went to bed.  checked this morning and both the ambient temp of the freezer and the fermenter read 67 degrees.  However, I went home for lunch, and the ambient temp was down to 58 degrees (!), with the fermenter temp holding at 68.  My question is, with huge swings like this, won't the ambient temp ultimately bring down the fermenter temp even if the controller is 'not trying to', when the walls of the freezer are cold from the compressor, and the chest is sealed shut and providing insulation?  I understand that fermentation (active signs this morning and this afternoon) can create some decent heat from the anaerobic reactions, but is there a way to control this to a greater extent, or does it matter?  My other question is how/if anyone manages moisture inside a chest freezer fermentation chamber set up.  Even with minimal compressor activity, it has kicked up quite a bit of humidity inside.  Thanks! "
2779,How well does liquid yeast travel?,"I have often heard people talking about the viability of pitchable liquid yeast either in a vial or smack pack dropping over time. This effect is greatly accelerated with increased temperature, so storing the yeast cold without freezing will slow down the drop in viability.  Does the effect of dropping viability mean that if the liquid yeast has to travel a long distance to reach me it would be better using a dried yeast? How is the liquid yeast generally transported overseas? Is it refridgerated?  To make the example a bit more specific White labs produces yeast in California and I buy it online from a homebrew shop in the UK. Would dried yeast perhaps be a better option? "
2780,Cure for Oxygenation?,"I was siphoning beer to a secondary fermentation vessel so that I could reuse the ""primary"" bucket. A steady stream of bubbles inside the cane part of the autosiphon should have set off alarm bells inside my head, but I was a bit distracted. When I finally paid closer attention to it, I realized that there was a new crack in the plastic which wasn't sufficient to prevent the siphon from working but acted was a perfect mechanism for introducing air into the liquid. By that time, the destination carboy was full.  Is there anything I can do to save this beer? I don't have a keg or any means of force-carbonating it. Conversely, if I bottle and drink it sufficiently quickly, will the extra oxygenation have only a minimal impact? "
2781,Mash Efficiency and Quality of Wort,"I recently achieved a 94% mash efficiency on a batch of Saison and was pretty stoked thinking, wow, 94% is much better than the the 72% I did last time.  I must be getting better at this...  But then I read on several brew forums that a higher mash efficiency will negatively affect the quality of the wort.  Is this true, and if so, how?  How is the wort affected and why does it happen?  Lastly, if this is the case, how does a brewer determine appropriate balance of efficiency and wort quality.  Thanks! "
2782,Mash Efficiency vs Brewhouse Efficiency,"I'm trying to understand the difference between Mash Efficiency and Brewhouse Efficiency.  Is Brewhouse Efficiency essentially the efficiency of Mashing AND Lautering, whereas Mash efficiency would be the efficiency of just the MASH itself and NOT the Lauter?  I see in John Palmers book, that Mash Efficiency is calculated the same way that a BeerSmith blog post tells me to calculate Brewhouse Efficiency.  Are these terms synonymous among home brewers due to the volume of the brew kettle? "

I'm an extract brewer, and many of the recipes I've tried call for steeping some crystal malt, but I'm not always able to find the °L called for.  Usually I can get something close, but I'm curious what the effects would be of larger changes on the recipe.  i.e. if I replace 25° crystal with 85° crystal (or vice versa), what will change in the final beer? "
2787,What kind of wine should I use to top off my wine during clarification?,"After secondary fermentation, when I rack, add the stabilizers, and degas, I've been told it's best to top-off with additional wine (commercial or left-over from an old batch) to minimize the surface area exposed to air (basically topping up to the neck of the carboy). What considerations do I need to keep in mind? Will any commercial white/red work for a batch of white/red? For a concrete example, I'm doing a Sauvignon Blanc right now, and don't have any left-over white. Should I just go buy the cheapest Sauvignon Blanc I can find to top-off with? "
2788,Are there any problems associated with ordering ingredients online (internationally)?,"I live in Australia &amp; (as a new brewer) read a lot of recipes online, many of which reference products I can't buy or haven't yet found locally.  I'd like to start ordering ingredients from various online, international sources.  Does anyone here order ingredients internationally / online? Have you ever had any troubles?  e.g. customs seizing plant products or the freshness of ingredients after a week of travel. "
2789,Can fruit be left in secondary too long?,"I just put 5 pounds of blackberries in secondary fermenter with 5 of the 10 gallons of a Belgian wit.  I was going to bottle it all one week from now, assuming fermentation has died down.    Are there any drawbacks to leaving the fruit in for a week?  What about 2 weeks?  I brewed again this weekend and might just wait and bottle it all together. Should I rack the beer off e blackberries at some point in the meantime?  Result:    This doesn't show the color as well as I'd like.  While you're pouring it, it's almost pink-ish, which is when it looks its most unnatural.  In the glass it looks closer to a very reddish brown. "
2790,Should I move primary to lower temp?,"I'm brewing a dubbel and pitched a 1000ml yeast starter of Wyeast 1214 at 68F.  It's fermenting in a room now with an ambient temp of 72F.  Over the course of 30 hrs, temp has increased to 78-79F according to a stick-on therm.  Should I move to the basement with an ambient between 65-68? How about inside of Rubbermaid container with icewater? Or do I just leave it for now and see how it is in the morning (12 hrs for now)?   Not sure if it changes anything, but the OG was 1051 instead of an expected 1065.  My guess is that I over compensated for evaporation.  I'll be sure to mark 5g on this new 6g carboy. "
2791,What type of water is best to use for different situations,"Do you use different types of water for different types of beer? I know the type of water can change your flavors slightly.    Will I get wildly different outcomes if I use say, distilled water over tap or regular filtered water?   If I use one type of water in the wort then a different type after will that mess things up terribly?   I found this question but I have a slightly different question. "
2792,"Brewed an Oatmeal Stout and the gravity did not drop as much as predicted, should I re-pitch or add yeast nutrients/energizer?","I just brewed an oatmeal stout see recipe details here and I have a question about missing Orignal and/or Final gravities.  The OG was supposed to be 1.061 and the FG 1.016.  I brewed and got an OG or 1.063 and I racked to my carboy last night and the specific gravity was 1.022.  I'm concerned that the gravity wont drop any more while in the carboy, will it?  Is there anything I can do to get it to further come down to the expected range (1.016 -1.018 - corrected for my overage on the OG)?  Should I be adding a yeast nutrient or energizer to the carboy in hopes of getting the yeast going again?  If so what do you recommend?    Or should I consider re-pitching with more yeast, my fear here is that I only want it to drop a tiny bit as I'm not too far off.  Or should I just leave it alone and let it be for 2-3 weeks in the carboy and not overthink it?  Here are some notes about the brewing and transfer of the batch on my notebook.  Thanks, ~ Tom "
2793,Racking question,"This might seem like a really dumb question but what exactly is meant by the term ""racking"" and how did it come about?  When someone says, ""I just racked my beer"", what does that mean? Can it have different meanings? I've heard it used (maybe incorrectly) to when you start the fermentation process and when you start the bottling process. "
2794,Original Gravity: Calculate or measure,I've been told that for extract brewing it's best to simply calculate the original gravity instead of measuring it.  Is this correct?  What are the pros/cons either way?  What about with extract+grains or partial mashes? 
2795,"Home brew, acetylaldehydes and hangovers","Both me and my gf noticed that my home brews (even just 1 or 2 a night) cause a fairly noticeable headache in the morning compared to commercial brews.  God forbid you get drunk on it, the next morning is hell.  I did some research here and there are claims that acetylaldehydes is the cause of it.  From what I've read a very violent boil (without lid) and secondary fermentation should remove a lot of it.  I don't typically second ferment and have troubles getting a good boil without lid on.  Do I need to put more yeast and/or sugar in for the secondary fermentation?  Or just transfer it?  I plan on upgrading my stove to get a better boil.  Any other things I can do to minimize acetylaldehydes?  [website]"
2796,Cold Crash and Finings,"This year my goal is to improve the clarity of my bottle conditioned beer.  I intend to do this by:   At the end of the fermentation, adding finings (Isinglass) to the brew barrel, followed by;  Putting my brew barrel in the fridge for 2 days.   Should I be concerned that this will be too effective and remove all the yeast from the beer, thereby resulting in under carbonated or even flat beer? Or will I just need to leave the bottled beer a little longer at room temperature to carbonate?  Does anyone have any experience with this approach? What other options would you suggest?  Cheers, Perk. "
2797,Effects of Grain Freshness on Brew House Efficiency,"Background:  My co-brewer (ScottyG) and I recently brewed our first all-grain in a converted Coleman cooler.  We have over sixty batches of extract under our belts and have even made a few hard ciders and a batch of mead.  I freely admit, we are a bit late in getting around to going all-grain, but we’ve learned a LOT in our 60+ batches of extract+steeping grains.  We didn’t have high expectations for the first batch.  We did some experiments to approximate temperature drops in the cooler (surprisingly little) and made sure we were using proper procedure.  (following via ScottyG) *We used 10# of grain (9# Marris Otter, 1# Simpson's Dark Crystal) and 1.5 qt/lb for both mashing and sparging. Doughed in at 153, added 1 pint of boiling water. We let it rest for 60 min and the final temp was 149 F. Sparge water was 168 F, and we let it soak for 20 minutes before draining.  We did not: 1) Test pH 2) Test with iodine  First runnings were 2.4 gal @ 1.054, second runnings were 4.6 gal @ 1.012. Final was 7.1 gal @ 1.026 for an efficiency of 50%.*   Much lower than we had expected, much lower than our software or hand calculations projected.  The first running was about the SG we expected from the second.  We used some pre-crushed grain that was about a year old. (crushed at Northern Brewer about a year ago). It was from a kit a friend bought for us to make and had mistakenly got all-grain.  We are reasonably certain that our troubles come from old grain, crushed a year ago.  (BTW, we augmented with some extract to bring the resulting beer up to an acceptable SG. (Yay, it’s gonna be a beer!)  Now after all that setup, here’s the question:    What effect does the age of the grain have on the amount of fermentables you can mash out of it?  Does the crush decrease the “freshness window?”     TL;DR What effect does old grain have, especially if it was crushed in the past. "
2798,Not using bittering hops,"Has anyone brewed without using any bittering hops?  Are there any consequences to doing this?  Edit:  I ask because I want to brew a style that's not normally very bitter (weizen), but give it a small citrusy kick, without adding to the bitterness.  My thought was that I could just forgo the bittering hops, and throw in some Citra or Amarillo towards the end.  The calculations say it will hit the desired IBU's, just wanted to know if there was anything else to be aware of. "
2799,Wyeast 3944 Slow to Work,"I wanted to see if anyone else had this experience - I'm on my second batch of a Wit bier with this yeast and have noticed that in both scenarios - after two weeks the Krausen has not fallen. The first batch I transferred to the secondary while the krausen was still present (which I will not be doing with the second batch). The FG checked out on target with the initial batch.   I'm running up on week two for the second batch and fermentation is still moving. The fermentation of the first batch was @65 degrees and the second batch is at the lower end of 60 degrees.  Has anyone else experienced ""slow"" fermentation using a witbier yeast such as Wyeast 3944? What has you experience been? I've googled a bit and noticed mixed results about this. "
2800,Increasing IBUs post fermentation,I have recently brewed at APA and the IBUs have come out a little on the low side. I would like to increase the IBUS slightly. I was thinking of making a hop tea and adding it straight to the keg. Has anyone tried this? What are the things i need to consider? 
2801,Propane v. Natural Gas,"I just moved to a home where there is natural gas being piped into the garage for a garage heater.  I was thinking of re-tooling my burners with jet/orifices that can handle the lower pressure of the natural gas v. the propane tank hook ups I use now.  Does natural gas have more or less BTUs than the propane? Would you expect a longer or shorter ""time to boil"" if I switch over? "
2802,Stuck fermentation,"My beer is stuck at 1.052 and it started at 1.092. The type of yeast is wyeast #3522, so I expect it to get quite a bit lower. It's been 3 weeks since we brewed it and it's now rather clear. I suspect that my apartment got too cold. Can anyone help me revive my yeast?  Recipe   8lbs pilsner LME 2lbs light DME 1lb Carapils 2lbs candi sugar 1oz Northern Brewer 1oz Saaz  "
2803,Adding extra malt,"I'm about to make 5 gallons of a rather light lager.  The recipe calls for 6.5 lbs DME (munton's extra light), but I could only order two 3 lb bags and a 1 lb bag.  Would it be a disaster to toss that extra half pound of DME in the boil, or would it probably work out alright?  What would the main effects be - darker, higher OG, sweeter? "
2804,Should I brew in too-warm climate or substitute the yeast?,I'm about to brew an Amber Ale (from an LHBS kit) that comes with a US-05 Safale yeast.  The forecasted temperature for the next couple of weeks is likely to remain at min 20C (68F) overnight &amp; max of 36/37C (~100F).  What will the effects be of brewing an Ale in too-hot temperature versus substituting the yeast for a Saison yeast (Wyeast 3724)?  Should I favour one over the other or are both bad ideas? 
2805,Where can I get printed crown caps?,I'm investigating buying crown caps in bulk and having a logo and/or my name professionally printed on them.  Does anyone know if this is possible on a small-ish scale and is it within the budget of a home-brewer?  Who does this kind of printing? Does anyone have a website or contact? 
2806,What do you do with the vodka from your ferm locks?,"I would've thought the answer was obvious, seeing as how it's alcohol.  But I took a whiff, and it smells like fermentation.  Now I like fermentation, it means beer is on its way.  I don't like fermentation flavored vodka.  First, is there some reason why drinking this would actually be bad?  Can't imagine alcohol being bad for you, just curious.  Second, any ideas on what to mix it with?  I know I can experiment, but if it doesn't work, I'll be committing alcohol abuse, and that's going to ruin my brew day.  I know this might sound on the edge of homebrew question, talking about vodka, but I believe this is a semi-common byproduct of the brewing process. "
2807,What do I need to refurbish a corny keg?,What do I need to prepare a used corny keg (picked up at a flea market say) for brewing?   Should I replace the seals?  Do I need a special tool to remove the posts?  What products and techniques should I use to clean and sanitize the keg? What else do I need to think about?  
2808,Yeast attenuation and fermentable sugars,"I'm a little confused about this and can't find an answer that satisfies my curiosity... I've found a helpful thread (What does high attentuation actually mean in terms of types of sugar fermented?) but it doesn't really sort me out. Perhaps someone can help break it down for a noob... :)  I understand that your wort will contain a certain amount of fermentable sugars, and some unfermentable. I believe this to be around 60%-70% (depending on your grain choice, mash temperature, etc.).  Then we have yeast attenuation rates, which appear to be anything around 60%-85% depending on the strain, but this appears to be a mechanism for comparing different yeast types in a 100% fermentable sugar solution.  Does this mean that any particular yeast can only ferment, say, 75% of the fermentable sugars? So somewhere around 50% of the actual sugars in the wort will be converted to alcohol?  I'm sure this can't be the case and I must be missing something important here... what is the importance of understanding yeast attenuation?  I intend to buy BeerSmith at some point but I'm just at the beginning of the road at the moment so I'd like to get my head around the entire process as much as I can.  Thanks! "
2809,carboy exploded while cleaning,"I just tried to clean out a 6.5 gallon carboy that I had used for primary fermentation. First, I hit it with hot water and dumped it out. Then, I put about a half-gallon of hot water with some dish soap. No more than five seconds after I began scrubbing the carboy with an angled brush, there was a loud explosion, and the carboy broke into four pieces in the sink. The temperature of the beer was around 60°F, and the temperature of the water was about 125°F. What, if anything, did I do wrong? Was it just a bad carboy or did I commit a fundamental mistake? What is the proper way to clean a glass carboy? "
2810,My cider tastes like red wine!,"Soooo... I'm totally a newbie here and this is my first batch of cider.  I have a fermentation bucket with an airlock.  I used Lalvin dried wine yeast.  I made my cider about a month ago using apples.  Simmered them on the stove (after juicing them) and then put it all together.  I also added sugar to the mix per one recipe to raise the alcohol content.  I did NOT get a hydrometer until week 2 so I had no base measurement there.  At week 2 it was ... ummm... 1.031.  Week 3 was 1.01.  Week 4 (this past weekend) it was a little less than that.  At week 3 it tasted like decent tasting red wine - slightly sweet.  Week 4 it tastes like plain red wine - sharp in my taste but I don't really like wine.  So - am I screwed?  Or, can I just let it continue to sit and will it eventually start tasting like cider? "
2811,what to use to top off blueberry wine?,What should I use to top off my carboy of blueberry wine?  I don't want to add water if I can help it.  Adding more juice will just start fermenting again.  Any suggestions on an acceptable wine to add? 
2812,My Regulator will not fit my CO2 tank,"I live in South Korea and had to buy a 20lbs CO2 becuase they would not service my american 5lbs tank. Unfortunately, my current CO2 regulator will not fit on the korean tank. I assume it is becuase of a metric-standard conversion issue.   The regulator I own is the following: [website]Do I need to just bite the bullet and buy a korean (metric) regulator or is there an adapter that I could buy? Also, does anybody know where I could purchase either of these items? Thanks.   -Spasm "
2813,How much of given boil volume should be used for mash and sparge?,"I'm just about to try my first all grain brew this weekend... Slightly nervous :)  I'm going to make the Black Sheep Ale recipe available from the hop and grain database... Being in Yorkshire it seems appropriate and I think it should suit my water.  The brew details are these:  Batch Size: 21.00 L  Boil Size: 29.68 L Estimated OG: 1.046 SG Estimated Color: 28.2 EBC Estimated IBU: 35.9 IBU Brewhouse Efficiency: 70.00 % Boil Time: 90 Minutes  Other than an ingredients list this is the only information provided by the recipe... so...  My main question at this point is, out of the 29.68 litre boil size, how much do I mash with? And how much do I sparge with? Do I just work it out if a 1.5qt to 1lb ratio (or similar)?  Also... I'm going for a 66C single temperature mash... Is that appropriate?  I assume, also, that if I boil 29.68 litres for 90 minutes I will arrive at a final volume of 21 litres? "
2814,Kegged Beer Not Staying Carbonated,"This summer I kegged a pale ale for the first time. For about the first week or so the carbonation level on the beer was great but then the beer started to get flat (still tasted good, just no bubbles). I carbonated with priming sugar.  Once the beer started getting I did the ""soap test"", putting soapy water at all the connection points on the C02 canister, keg, and lines. There were no bubbles so I don't think I have a leak, this conclusion is (I think) backed up by the fact that the C02 canister is holding at a steady level.  I don't have a kegerator so the keg was kept in my garage at a temp between 65-75F. I'm using a corny keg with ball locks. Prior to kegging I replaced all the o rings on the keg.  I really enjoyed the ease of kegging and would like to continue doing it but I'd like to figure out what I did to cause my beer to go flat so I don't do it again.  What's causing my beer to go flat? A leak (how should I test for it)? Is the relatively high storage temperature to blame? I'm really at a loss and would love some insight.  EDIT   Sounds like my problem is incorrect pressure for my storage temp. I'm planning to get a kegerator early next year to put this to the test. "
2815,Is my fermentation on the right track?,"I upgraded my equipment and estimated my new efficiency a bit too low, so the imperial IPA that I brewed on 11/30 ended up having an O.G. of 1.10 (supposed to be 1.09). I made a two step starter with White Labs California Ale (WLP001). The first step was 2L, and the second was a bit smaller at 1.2L since the first step went overboard a bit out of the erlenmeyer flask. I oxygenated with pure O2 for a minute and a few seconds before pitching. There was a little bit of bubbling the first 18 hours, but not much action until after 24 hours. It was really active for a week, and is now slowing down. There's still a 3/4"" krausen, and I took a reading of 1.033 today (12/12). I'm looking to get to at least 1.02 (hopefully). The original recipe was supposed to finish around 1.01. I also should mention that I've been rousing the carboy occasionally. Not that it matters, but here's a bubble every 10 - 15 seconds in the air lock, 6.5 gallon carboy.  Should I pitch more yeast, or wait it out? I don't like leaving it on the trub for more than 3 weeks, but I don't want to rack to secondary until it's close to what I want. I was thinking to make a new starter and rack to secondary with the new starter. Any thoughts? I have never brewed a batch higher than 1.08, so this is new for me. "
2816,Use aquarium hydrometer for brewing,I am currently looking for a better way to monitor brewing progress than to have to pop out my syphon every few days and syphon it out for a hydrometer reading.   Now I am currently looking at using a hydrometer for salt water fish tanks to use inside a transparent fermentation vessel.  Has anyone tried this? Any recommendations? 
2817,First Home Brew - Double IPA - Boil Question,"I am in the middle of my brew for my first home brew, a Double IPA from Brewer's Best.  I added the first package of Columbus hops at the start of the boil as instructed, and its as if they haven't fully dissolved.  There is a layer of ""film"" on the top that is clearly the remains of the hops.  Is this normal?  It also instructs me to add more Columbus hops with 15 minutes left, about to do that, and then it says to boil the final 15 minutes and then add Cascade hops at the end of the boil.  Are these cascade hops going to make their way into the primary fermenter??  Thanks, Chris "
2818,How to store leftover fermenting wine for reuse later?,I've got a decent amount of leftover wine (ginger) after racking from my primary to a couple of demijohns. I want to use this for the topping up when I eventually rerack in a few months' time but I'm not sure how to store it. It's currently in a normal wine bottle (using about 650 of its 750ml) but I don't have an air lock that fits it though I've heard you can get away with just putting some muslin wrap over the opening.  My question ultimately is can I leave this leftover in the bottle with some muslin wrapped over it and then use it top up my demijohns when I'm reracking? Or should I just drink it right now as it tastes delicious (probably due to the unfermented sugar that remains... SG of 1046) and top up as normal with water/syrup when necessary? 
2819,identifying sediment layers in yeast washing,"I'm washing the yeast from a brew I've just bottled and it's not settling quite how I am expecting with my limited (once before) experience.  This fermentation was with a fresh packet of dried Danstar Windsor yeast, so this is a first generation population and I was very careful with my sanitation.  I rinsed the fermenter trub with cool boiled water and poured it into a sanitised jar.  An hour later the obvious gunge had settled out so poured the milky yeast fluid off into another sanitised jar, discarding the last inch with the trub.  This morning I have a jar containing four distinct layers. From top to bottom...   liquid (well, obviously :) very thin pale layer very thick darker patchy layer thin pale layer   The third, patchy looking layer is by far the most voluminous and, although it is yeasty in colour, it seems to be made more from two yeast tones, light and dark.  Instinct tells me (which could easily be incorrect!) that the lighter layers are good and the darker layer contains stuff I don't want.  If I include this layer in my yeast harvest I'll end up with a healthy harvest (about 400ml), however if I manage to separate it out I'll be left with very little.  Any advice?  Edit... managed to upload a picture now!  Edit... a few hours have passed and it looks like the top light layer is settling through the darker layer and, perhaps, the light component is settling out of the darker band. Perhaps in a few more hours I'll be left with a very thick deposit of a dark substance on top of a thin light layer. Which is the good stuff? All of it?  Photo taken in the morning:  "
2820,"Effect of Long, High, Decling-Temperature Mash on Wort","Due to time constraints, I need to do a two- to 2-1/2 hour unattended mash, and then return to lauter, etc.  I plan to do a single batch sparge.  I am looking for a slightly-less fermentable wort for more body, so I theorize that my ideal mash profile is a single-temperature rest at around 156-158°F (69-70°C). However, my non-heated mash tun is going to lose around 15°F (8.3°C) over 2-2.5 hrs., I estimate**.  So I need to mash in higher. I don't have the ability to add more strike water mid-mash because I am maxed out on MLT space, and will not be around to do it.  Q1: What sort of wort profile can I expect if I mash-in at 162°F (72°C) , and end up at 147°F (64°C) over 2-2.5 hrs.?  John Palmer says in How to Brew that beta-amylase is denatured at 154-162°F (68-72°C), but I have seen other writers say that overnight mashes lead to very fermentable worts and dry beers.  Q2: Does the mash-in temp determine the fermentability of the wort, or is it based on the whole mash?  Q3: Besides buying a new cooler, do you have any advice in terms of tips, techniques, or mashing temps?  In case it matters, this is a partial-mash recipe; 2.5 gallon (9.5 L) batch (fermenter volume).  My malt bill is 4.2 lbs. (1.9 kg) of grain (71% Golden Promise, and 23% Belgian Caramunich, 8% 160°L crystal), mashed at 1-1/3 qts./lb (0.57 L/kg), plus 0.75 lbs. (0.34 kg) of DME.  Yeast: Danstar Nottingham.   ** My two-gallon (7.6 L) beverage cooler mash tun loses 10°F (5.6°C) in one hour without a blanket, but I have added insulation to the lid and plan to wrap in a blanket, so I expect a maximum 15°F (8.3°C) loss over 2-2.5 hrs. I do preheat the cooler with 185°F (85°C) water. The lack of thermal mass, and inefficiency of cold beverage coolers to keep contents hot, are drawbacks of small batch brewing. This is the first time I am trying for a less-fermentable wort.  "
2821,Late Mash Additions for Color,"I was looking for color in a recipe without any of the roastiness from dark crystal malt I would get from using it as steeped specialty grains. When I asked the manager at the LHBS about cold steeping, he instead recommended ""late mashing"". He told me to use a slightly darker crystal malt, and add it as a late mash addition in the last 10-15 minutes of the mash. Apparently, several breweries in my area have been doing this, per that guy.  I can't find much information on techniques, except this blog post, and these forum posts: link 1; link 2.  Is there an accepted technique for adding dark malts late in the mash for color? If not, any advice?  FYI, I don't have a grain mill, so I am limited to the LHBS's mill, which is locked at a 0.040"" gap, if that is relevant. "
2822,Any drawbacks in forgoing a secondary?,"I have a India Pale Ale which is just finishing fermentation in a sealed bucket under airlock, I want to skip the secondary. How long should I wait before carefully racking and bottling?  Will the beer be clear at that point or should I extend that time? "
2823,Consistently high final gravity,"I started brewing about a year ago, currently on my sixth batch, all using extract and some additional grains. My problem is that my beers consistently finish with a higher than expected final gravity. For the life of me, I can't figure out what I'm doing wrong.  My latest batch is the biggest failure yet. I don't think I can bottle it like it is. I modified the all-grain recipe linked below to use extract for the base malt. I did a ""mini-mash"" with the other grains (crystal, chocolate, smoked, black patent). The temperature at the end of the mash was 150F. I substituted 6 lbs. pale LME and 10 oz. pale DME for the base malt. I upped the second hop addition to a full 1 oz.  [website]I plugged this recipe into Brew Target. It said my OG should be ~1.046 and my FG should be ~1.013. My OG was right on target when I pitched the yeast. I pitched one packet of hydrated Nottingham yeast at 74F. The airlock started bubbling within a few hours, went strong for about a day, and then just stopped. After 10 days, the gravity was 1.022. The taste is rather bland, not particularly sweet or bitter or ... anything else, really.  I used tap water from the filtered dispenser on my refrigerator. I aerated by shaking vigorously in the fermenter for a few minutes before pitching the yeast. Fermentation temperature is a consistent 68F.  I asked the proprietor at my LHBS for help. He gave me some yeast energizer and high attenuating ale yeast to try to get it going again. I gently stirred in the energizer and sprinkled the yeast on top. That was about 18 hours ago, and it shows zero activity right now.  Other examples:     Imperial IPA, OG 1.094, expected FG 1.023, actual FG 1.028     Pale Ale, OG 1.052, expected FG 1.013, actual FG 1.018    These things start out with the right OG, but they just stop fermenting and refuse to go any further.  Does anyone have any idea what might be wrong? What I might be doing to encounter this repeatedly? What I can do to salvage my latest batch? "
2824,Analytics for Beer,"So, I am very new to home brewing, my first batch has been fermenting for about a week.  I have been a beer enthusiast for years, so I am really enthusiastic about this new hobby of mine.  By trade, I am a computer scientist and I specialize in data analytics.  I use a tool called QlikView, to build analytical applications, and it is really powerful in spotting relationships between data.  So, I have an idea to build up a database (really, just a series of Excel Spreadsheets) and then load them into a QlikView application to allow us home brewers to do some analysis on the composition of existing beers, to allow us to ""tinker"" with a recipe based on ingredients that are shared in beers we like.  An example I can think of... say I have three favorite IPAs, if I saw that they all share a common hop then I would view this as a hop I must really like in a beers.  The idea would be to try to build up new recipes based on common components across potentially different clusters of beers someone may like.  This could extend beyond just the ingredients, also into the brewing process and additions, etc.  So, my question is, has anyone tried something like this?  (obviously, not necessarily in the tool I am suggesting).  Also, is there a good repository of beer recipes out there I could use to seed this database?  Also, would anyone be interested in joining in such a project?  No financial angle here, I am wanting to build something useful that would be openly shared.  Thoughts?  Chris "
2825,Measure remaining sugar in kombucha brew w/ hydrometer?,"I'm brewing kombucha and would like to figure out when the best time to bottle it to build up some carbonation.  I'm also interested in figuring out how much sugar is remaining so I can calculate the amount of calories in my kombucha.  Can I measure how much sugar is remaining in my kombucha brew using a hydrometer?  If so, wouldn't that be a good way to know when to bottle it?  Thanks. "
2826,Kegging - Is it necessary to filter yeast?,"I'm planning to buy kegging equipment and keg my next batch of beer, and I ran into some yeast filters for sale that remove yeast specifically for kegging. Is this a necessary step? I know that when I usually bottle without adding fresh yeast for bottle conditioning, I have a noticeable layer of yeast at the bottom of every bottle.   What happens otherwise if the yeast is transferred into the kegs from the secondary fermentation: will the beer come out cloudy, or will the yeast stay at the bottom of the keg? If I do add filtration, how much will it change taste/color of the beer?  If it helps, I'm planning to build a keezer so the beer will be stored/served cold.   Thanks! "
2827,Should My Boil Volume Include The Volume of Dry Malt Extract?,"I was just experimenting with the 'Brew It!' tool on Brewers' Friend and the instructions say that for a 12 litre boil, I should add 8.8 litres to the kettle along with 5kg of dry malt extract which equates to a further 3.2 litres totaling 12L - my target volume.  I'm going to reasonably assume that Brewers' Friend knows it's stuff but I have always taken the boil volume to be the water only!  Have I been doing it wrong?  For the purposes of future brewing and consistency should I just adjust my recipe so the pre boil water volume reads 12L? "
2828,kegging and carbonation,"I am kegging my first batch ever in the next two weeks. It's a double IPA. My questions are:   What pressure is ideal for serving. do i need to turn off my tank every night? Will leaving it on cause constant carbonation, or will the beer eventually stop carbonating? I am concerned that leaving it at desired serving pressure will mean the carbonation will continue to increase as long as the tank is on.   "
2829,plastic storage for bottles,"I just found out that roaches harbor in cardboard boxes. Not to mention that cardboard breaks down easily when filled with damp, freshly sanitized bottles. Does anyone have suggestions for plastic versions that I can store finished bottles of beer in? This question was posted some time ago but the answer that was chosen leads to a website that no longer exists! What are the current solutions? I'd also like to not have to build my own crate. "
2830,What is the best type of ale/lager that you can add fruit to?,"I am planning to make a fruit batch for my wife and I have read on when to add the fruit and how, but is there a recipe that you should stay away from?  This my be subjective to a point, but I don't think a Bock would be a good starting point.  What wort would be recommended? "
2831,Can I assume that an unopened glass jug containing the juice I want to ferment is sanitary?,"I am making cider for the first time. I purchased a gallon of organic apple juice with no other ingredients besides the apples. I sort of saw it as a two-for-one, I got the apple juice I needed as well as the vessel I needed.   I sanitized all my equipment, but just left the juice in the carboy (besides the cup or so that I took out to heat up and add yeast to). Should I have poured the juice into another (sanitized) vessel, sanitized the carboy, and then poured it back in the carboy? Or was what I did fine? "
2832,Anderson Valley Bourbon Barrel Stout Recipe,"I'm newer to home brewing (about 8 batches extract, 1 partial mash) and looking to tackle this. It was absolutely amazing.  Could somebody help me out with the recipe? Is this the right place to ask?  Notes: The stout was very well balanced, with a strong and delayed (about 1 second) aftertaste of vanilla. I have never brewed with vanilla or oats, so please be specific about how to handle that. I'm ok with neglecting the 'Bourbon Barrel' conditioning.  Thanks!

2833,Is my hard cider ready for bottling?,"My cider has been going for a month and I am not sure whether to move them to bottles yet or not.  I was advised that slower fermentation leads to better cider, to I have had them in the garage for the last week and a half. Since moving to the colder environment,  the gravity has moved from 1034 - 1022 on one demijohn, and 1020 to 1015 on another. Neither has completely dropped out.  It seems to me that I want a slightly lower gravity before bottle to avoid exploding, but I'm very new to this and may be totally wrong.  Is there a cast iron rule I can follow? How can I tell when should I bottle? "
2834,Beer aroma during fermentation,"I am in the middle of fermentation on my first batch of homebrew, it's a Double IPA from Brewer's best.  During my boil, I added Columbus hops at the start and after 45 minutes, in addition to some cascade hops at the conclusion of my boil.  My boil was 12/14, and I noticed bubbling about 24 hours later as expected.  I was also able to previously smell the aroma of the hops during the fermentation.  It smelled very similar to how the pellet hops smelled in the package.  Two questions; is it normal to smell the hop aroma during fermentation, and then if so, is it normal for the aroma to disappear?  Also, again, if this is all normal, does the disappearance of the aroma tell me anything about how the fermentation is progressing?  Thanks, Chris "
2835,Yeast too stressed for bottling?,"I brewed a pumpkin ale and added extra fermentables.  After primary and secondary was done, I went to bottle.  While bottling I tried some and noticed the alcohol level was quite high.  After two weeks in the bottles, I drank one and it was flat, I tried another and it was flat too.  Is it possible that I stressed the yeast to the point that it wouldnt consume the priming sugar for carbonating?  If so, how do I fix it? "
2836,How is the Heineken Draughtkeg made?,"I am sorry for the noob question, I'm not a beer professional, but just curious about some things :)  So I've seen this thing: [website]and it looks like barrel with a CO2 tube inside. But how does this work? Is the gas from the tube mixed with the liquid when you pour from it? "
2837,Why does my beer have carbonation but no foam head?,"I recently made a Belgium Ale, which was slow to start fermenting, but once it got going it finished fine.  It cleared in a secondary and was bottled using 5oz of corn sugar for the 5 gallon batch.  It's in the cellar which runs from to low to higher 60's depending on the time of day (a previous batch carbonated just fine in those conditions).  After one week I open a test bottle, it has a little gas pop, tasted ok, but was flat.  Another week and the bottle popped well, was poured into a glass and got a head consistent to soda, which dissipated rapidly, leaving the beer tasting ok, but pretty flat.  It seems that CO2 is being made in the bottle, does it just take longer to go into solution? Does it just need more time to create a head?  Thanks for any insight. "
2838,Is this a sign of improper carbonation or improper bottling?,"This is a story of two very different pours from the same batch.  TL;DR: the first bottle was foamy and very carbonated, the second was normal, but the first bottle went flat and was cloudy, while the second bottle was within normal range for head, carbonation, and clarity.  The Story: I poured a bottle for a friend into a hand-rinsed, standard pint glass, pouring the first half down the side and the second half down the middle, being careful not to disturb or pour the lees. When I opened it, I noticed some bubbling in the neck, but no gusher. The beer was fairly foamy, very bubbly, with a head that dissipated very quickly.  I immediately opened a second bottle for myself, noticed the same bubbling, but got sidetracked and did not pour for about 10 minutes. Same type of glass and pouring technique. However, my beer had a nice head, that lasted a little while, and carbonation was normal.  When were about halfway through both beers at the same time, and noticed that my friend's beer had gone sort of flat with no lacing and was a little cloudy, while mine was still carbonated, and was pretty clear (you could see through it when held up to light). (By the way, the beer was somewhat green, and hopefully will benefit from more time in the bottle.)  My Question: Is this a sign of improper carbonation, or could it be due to inadequate mixing in the fermenter before I bottled?  I.e., maybe I racked too much beer into bottles and should have left more in the fermenter. Or maybe something different? I have never had bottles that varied from bottle to bottle before.  Recipe ingredients and process:   Belgian pale ale - all-grain: 95% Belgian pale malt, and 5% Belgian biscuit;  Safbrew T-58 yeast, properly rehydrated, with est. cell counts per Mr Malty's calculator. OG: 1.050 --> FG: 1.010; fermented in primary 15 days at 67°F; no secondary; I did not cold crash or use any finings, but I gingerly moved the fermenter to the counter where I was bottling about two hours before bottling; bottled straight from fermenter, and primed with exactly one Cooper's carbonation drop per bottle; I did not feel like I was greedy about bottling too much beer, and I recall leaving quite a bit in the fermenter to avoid sediment, even pouring out the last bottle instead of capping; bottle conditioned for 14 days at 70-72°F and another six days at 67°F, both in the same sealed case box.  "
2839,Stirring Spoon Hop Stained,"So... I will just start with sharing that ""Hop Stained"" has a nice ring to it for an IPA name, but I digress to my question.  During my first batch, I am becoming paranoid I did not pay enough attention to cleaning throughout my boil.  I kept a bucket with sanitizer and kept all instruments in there when I wasn't using them, except my stirring spoon.  This was because I was stirring my wort nearly constantly, and after the boil and even after I cleaned the soon, there is still a green tint to it from the hops I imagine.  Is this normal?  Does this mean I didn't clean well enough?  Thanks, Chris "
2840,filling the airlock,"I'm brewing my first batch ever, and got a little worried that it wasn't bubbling after 24 hours as the instructions said it should. I've read a lot on here that says not to worry about a bubbling airlock, but I do have a question.  It does seem to be fermenting, it's been 2 days. I can see a krausen through the plastic. And today I noticed the airlock is indeed pressurized. The instructions called to fill the airlock about halfway. I missed the mark and filled it about three quarters.  Now here's the thing. I can clearly see there is pressure in the bucket. I can press on the lid, and see the airlock bubble. When I stop pressing on the lid, the airlock equalizes, then shortly shows pressure in the fermenter again. Yet I see no bubbling. Could this be due to the fact the airlock is filled too much? Has anyone else seen this kind of behaviour?  Lastly, thanks to all of the people on here, it's relieved many worries, with the simple DWHAHB.   EDIT It's a 5 gallon batch in a 6 gallon white plastic bucket. I put a flashlight on the lid, turned off the lights, and could distinctly see different light levels, dark at the 5 gallon mark, kinda chunky brown about an inch and a half above that, and empty above that. Three piece airlock.  EDIT2 Checked the gravity tonight, and found 1.007. So I think it's done. Perhaps I had a leak on the lid, perhaps I just didn't notice it fermented in the day I was at work. In either case, I've put it in the secondary fermenter (yes, I know it's not necessary, but I want to clear it up a bit). I smelled it, and it smells almost like Sierra Nevada Torpedo, tasted it, and I can clearly taste the hops flavor and bitterness. It seems it turned out okay. I'll check the gravity again on Sunday, and if unchanged, bottle it. FWIW original gravity was 1.058, but that could be off, it was hard to measure around the froth after transferring to the primary fermenter. Either way, I'm within 0.005 of the kits specs, so I think I'm good.  DOOD! I made Beer! Sorry, this is fun "
2841,Newbie brewer: beer sample tastes strange,"my first batch was a little tricky, lots of mistakes made. Ive got some questions.  Its a Pale Ale (US-05) (6.5 pounds of Pilsen malt - 1.5 pound of Carared - 1 pound of Oat Malt - 0.8 pounds of Crystal 50 malt - 0.4 pounds of Flaked oats), OG 1052 and FG 1017, did a hop stand with around 4oz. Beer sample tasted strange, not even close to a medium bodied beer, not sweet despite the FG.   Its quite bitter and with lots of hop flavor, which would be pleasant, but its not. It was a 5gal batch but I ended up with only 3.9gal in primary fermentor. Beersmith said IBU would be 40, but since I got less beer, it will be more bitter, correct?  It fermented for 10 days in 68ºF. Secondary temperature is 42ºF. Is that right? How long should I leave it there to build body and malt flavor? Since it is already pretty hopped, with strange hop characteristics (well, I used 8 types of hops... dumb thing), should I dry hop?  It has been at 42F for 4 days now... Can I raise it to 65ºF without any bad consequences?  Thanks a lot for the attention, fellow homebrewers! "
2842,How to raise pH (or lower acidity) of mead,"I have a mead that I think has too high of an acid level.  I am looking for ways to raise the pH or lower the acidity1.  Roughly 7 months ago, I made a 5 gal batch of mead.  The original fermentation got stuck, so I added some FermaidK based upon the local brew shop's recommendation.  Initial OG was 1.116, and I added FermaidK at 1.088 and again at 1.042.  I can't find the measurement prior to racking, but I think it was around 1.002.  So after sitting for about 6 months in the carboy, the clarity is pretty decent but the mead has a pretty boozy aroma to it.  I haven't had many meads, so I don't know how to describe the flavor.  It was tasty enough, but perhaps seems really bright.  Drinkable but not quite amazing...  I used an acid titration kit to measure the acid level.  With 15 cc of my mead and 3 drops of phenolphthalein, it took 7.5 cc of .2N sodium hydroxide to trigger the color change.  According to the instructions I have, that's a .75% tartaric acid level but the recommended range for mead is .30 - .50%.   Do I need to do anything to lower the acid level / raise the pH of my mead? If so, what should I use given that I'm essentially ready to bottle excepting this possible acid level issue.     Relevant questions I found on Homebrewing:   How can I raise my mash pH with something other than chalk or baking soda?   Was probably the most relevant, but I have no idea what will happen to the flavor profile if I add calcium hydroxide (pickling lime) to my mead.  The OP on this question was adding at the beginning of the brew process, whereas I'm at the end of it.   How do I un-stuck a mead&#39;s fermentation?   Was also relevant and suggested using calcium carbonate, but again the OP was at an earlier stage in the brewing process.   How to correct Mead with too much citrus?   Was somewhat relevant, but I didn't add any citrus to my mead for flavoring.  1 Yes, I'm a bit of a noob in this matter, my apologies for using the terms a little too interchangeably.  Thank you to Tobias Patton for helping clarify the difference "
2843,Yeast cake and Septic tank,"I just transferred my brew to the secondary fermenter (yes, it's not necessary, but I want to help clarify the brew). Where we live, we have a septic tank sewer. I was just wondering if there could be any ill effects of rinsing the yeast cake from the primary down the drain into the septic?  Perhaps it would turn the septic into beer? Perhaps it would overflow up into the pipes in the house? Perhaps it could help the spetic in breaking down its (excuse the pun) crap?  Anyone done this, and noticed any ill effects?  FWIW, I've already rinsed it down the drain, so if no answers come up, I'll update with anything that happens here. "
2844,Bottling Rhythm and efficiency,"I've read the answers on how to sanitize bottles while bottling [here] but my question is this...   Should you cap a bottle right after filling it, or can you fill say 6 bottles, cap them, then put them in a six-pack holder and put away, and continue? I guess my real question is what is the best rhythm when having to bottle about 50 from a 5 gallon batch?  Not that 50ish bottles will get tiresome, I'm just wondering what systems others have discovered in their time. "
2845,Using Sugar substitutes (artificial sweeteners) instead of sugar,"I am new to home-brewing. I want to brew some liqueurs but since I am a diabetic, I can not use normal sugar in brewing.   My option is using sugar substitutes (like artificial sweeteners) like Splenda (I use Splenda since it is a well-known brand). Some of those sweeteners are fructose, that means they are produced using fruits or have some fruit or some other (strange) artificial taste. Also some brands have Sucralose and can be boiled up to a limited degree etc.  My question is, is anybody tried to use these instead of normal sugar. Is there anything that I must be careful while preparing liqueur  with sugar substitutes? My concern is about using them in liqueurs, not their pitfalls (like maximum boiling temp). Using a fructose (fruit) based sweetener effects the brewing process and ruined the brewing?  "
2846,Mash rests and water to grist ratio,"I am planning brewing a recipe I found of a porter that I am really excited about. The original recipe says that you should do a rest at temperature below final mash temperature for a bit. After some research I found that with today's highly modified malts, these more complex mash schedules are not necessary. So my first question is, is this true? Can I just forego the rest temperature and go for the final mash temp?  Second, if the overall opinion is that this rest is necessary, It makes me curious about water to grist ratio. Are you supposed to dough in at a lower ratio so that when you step up your temperature with some hot water to hit your mash temp that you end up with the desired ratio? Or do you do you dough in at the lower temp with the correct ratio, then when you bump up the temp, let the ratio slide so you have a higher water to grist ratio?  Thank you for all your help! "
2847,Increased Magnum hops in a Fat Tire Clone,"So I brewed the book ""Beer Captured""'s Fat Tire Clone the other day. I made a few slight variations. One being I used Wyeast 1056 instead of a Belgian Yeast because I figured since it's not a Belgian Ale why use a Belgian yeast (I also contacted New Belgium Brewery and the confirmed my theory and said I was on the right track)  My other change though was that it calls for .33oz of Magnum Hops (14%AA) The Magnum hops I had were only 12.5%AA, so I was going to bump it up to .66oz and the IBUs would come out at 26.4. (The book said IBU of 21). I had 1oz of Magnum, and I'm kind of a hophead, so I ended up bumping it up to .75oz which put the IBUs around 30.  My other hop additions are a .5oz Hallertauer (4.3%AA) at 15mins and .25oz Willamette (4%AA) at flameout.  Now I haven't really experimented too much with changing recipes. I mostly stick to the book. But, now I'm thinking should I have bumped up the other hops as well? With the higher amount of Alpha Acids from the Magnums, will the bitterness overpower any hop aroma from the late additions since they weren't increased at all? I know I'll just have to wait and see, but my question is if I increase the bittering hops in a recipe, should you also increase your flavor/aroma hops as well to help balance it out? "
2848,BIAB efficiency,"I have been doing some batch sparging with the Denny Conn method, and it works great! I also wanted to try, in the days that I want a slightly shorter brew day or a smaller experimental recipe, a BIAB. I have listened to a bunch of podcasts about BIAB and really it sounds like a nice alternative for quicker brew sessions. I was wondering if anyone out there has tried medium to bigger beers and where they start to see efficiency issues. Really I am curious about all these points:   Does your efficiency suffer at all? Is there a limit of what you can do for styles of beers?  How big can you go? I know you have to have a pretty big pot as the grain goes up, but does your efficiency suffer greatly just because it is BIAB?   Thanks again for all of your help and input!  "
2849,Old DME and Yeast Starters,"I just made a yeast starter for my upcoming brew and I realize the bag I was using for DME was pushing a year old and hasn't been through prime storing conditions. It got mixed in with my other stuff somehow and I realize I used it. The DME seems fine, no visible problems or anything. It also smelled fine when boiling the starter.  I was wondering if there is any concern with using this yeast starter I just made? I know DME doesn't stay fresh for eternity or anything, but I am also only using this as a starter, not a base malt for an extract brew. What are your thoughts, should I scratch the starter or should I go ahead? Thanks! "
2850,Is there a technique which prevents the deposit of sediment at the bottom of bottles?,"Every beer I've brewed and have seen done by others has had a sediment form at the bottom of the bottles.  Is there some common mistake that I and others are making which is causing this to happen?  Does the sediment become solid at the bottom after some months, as to not be disturbed by pouring the entire contents when drinking? "
2851,Chilling wort using ice packs,"I now have an immersion wort chiller, it does a pretty decent job chilling boiling wort to around 85-90F very fast, about 5 minutes, but from there to 65-70 it takes a lot, maybe 15 minutes more and I waste a lot of water. I friend suggested that i put sanitized ice packs directly into the wort once it reached the 90F mark to speed things up. Just to be clear im not saying throwing the ice packs into boiling wort, I mean put them in after the wort has cooled enough not to melt the plastic on the ice packs.  What do you think, would this work? do I risk infection?  "
2852,What should I do with this 1-lb brick of maple sugar?,"Last year I was in Quebec with family and I picked up a 500-gram (1-lb) brick of maple sugar from the marketplace. This stuff is so hard that the locals use a cheese grater on it. It was cheap too. The only trouble it caused me was going through airport security out of Boston - it looks like what I imagine a brick of solid explosive might look like.  I'd like to make a beer with it that will let maple flavor stand out, and I'd like to have it done in time for a big party we are having in August. Once upon a time I made a maple mead that was crisp and dry with plenty of maple flavor. This is my point of reference for maple brew, so I do not want something dark like a porter. I want something crisp and summery.  How much of this thing should I use in a 5-gallon batch of home brew? I know the answer will be recipe dependent, but is it crazy to use the whole thing? Should some of it be used in a primary and some in a secondary? "
2853,How to best grind grain at home?,"I buy most of my grain un-ground in bulk, because I don’t have a car my local HBS is way across town.   Before brewing, I’ve been grinding grain using a food processor (with blades) until each kernel is, on average, in three or four pieces. This probably isn’t optimal, though, and I have some general questions about how to do it better.  How should I be grinding my grain?   Is there an affordable way to grind it “the right way” at home (that doesn’t involve spending hours with a rolling pin)?   Is there a particular grit I should be shooting for if I use the food processor?   How do other people who don’t buy pre-ground manage the grinding?  Cheers! "
2854,Converting Hops in All-Grain to Extract Recipe,"I have this All-Grain recipe that I'm converting to Extract.  Do you basically just increase the hops until the IBUs match the original measurement? I've gotten the OG fairly close and the SRM is a little darker, which I'm expecting from extract.

2855,Salty Starter. From Gypsum?,"I'm using gypsum for the first time in an IPA I will be brewing in a few days. Today I was making the starter and thought:     Since it's a hopped starter, why not add a pinch of gypsum?   In the end I used PDME and yeast nutrient along with 2g Columbus hops and a tiny pinch of gypsum.  As I usually do with anything I brew, I drew a very small sample to smell and taste it. When I tried I was blown away by the salty taste. Does this come from the yeast nutrient? Or from the gypsum?  I've done some calculations for the total ppm of Calcium and sulfate that I am after, but if only a pinch of gypsum already made my 2L starter that salty, maybe I need to re-think.  Should gypsum additions be calculated using final water volumes (batch size) or total water volumes? I was going to use 33g of gypsum to obtain 191 mg/L Calcium and 460 mg/L sulfate in 43.4L (total brewing volume). Those figures include additions from the city water supply.  "
2856,Attribute taste variation to volume of bottle?,"This is not exactly a home brew question but this site seems to be the best fit in the stack exchange network for it. You can home brew the beer in question with a kit produced by the brewery though it obviously isn't exactly the same. If there's an answer to be had I am sure someone here has it.  Cooper's Sparkling Ale is the beer I buy most often. While I like Grolsch swingtops better (and my Dad loves that he can use the bottles for his brew) it's much more expensive and harder to find. Coopers is a family-owned brewery in South Australia, it's one of the few independent breweries left whose products can be found nationally.  Two questions about this bottle-conditioned ale:  I prefer the 750ml size to the 375ml size. I always feel the beer from the large bottle has a much fuller taste and more intense bitterness to it. I've tried chilling both equally and pouring into the same sized glass. There could be variation due to batch but then some of the time I would expect to prefer the small bottle. Can this be explained by the larger volume of the bottle particularly as this is bottle-conditioned ale?   As much as I like this stuff it can sometimes give me the shade of a hangover from just one bottle. It's a heavy-ish beer at 5.8% ABV but an equivalent alcohol volume consumed as some other drink doesn't do it. I'm not talking about the home brew version here so it isn't my fault. Can I attribute this to the yeast in the bottle or to something else? "
2857,Liquid yeast in wine making,"I've been making beer at home for quite some time now and can definitely see the difference between dry and liquid yeast (especially in some beer styles like hefeweizen). In my area there is a long tradition of making wine at home (almost everyone has their own small vineyard). Everyone is using dry yeast. So, is there a significant difference between dry and liquid in wine making? Is the difference going to be significant only in some sorts like muscat or sauvignon? I think I'll definitely try it next season, just wandering what to expect. "
2858,Rinsing frozen red currants,"I picked some garden grown red currants a good while ago and threw them straight in the freezer without washing them. I'm planning on making wine with them soon. Most recipes I've read recommend rinsing them before crushing, but how should I go about doing this?   Should I let the berries thaw first or just rinse them while frozen? Is rinsing even necessary if I'm scalding them with hot water? "
2859,What is the purpose of the ginger bug?,"Ive been reading numerous recipes in preparation for my first brew, and im confused between two types of recipes:   The first generally involves boiling ginger, adding sugar, champagne yeast, fermenting, backsweetening with nonfermentable sugars, priming, and bottling.  The second involves growing wild yeasts and bacteria in a semiopen container, and adding nonsanitised ingredients daily. This confuses me, as it seems like a great way to catch an infection and spoil the beer.   Is there anything I am missing? Is there a noticeable difference in taste? Is there any other benefit to the second approach?  "
2860,Can I distill contaminated wine?,"15 days ago I started a batch of wine from a Wine Kit. I went to measure the SG to begin the next step when I found the wine had a film layer at the top. Anyway I phoned the place that sold it to me and am getting a new wine kit tomorrow.  Before I pour this contaminated wine down the toilet, I am wondering if I could finish the process and distill it? Can I do anything to salvage this ~21L of bad juice?  Here's a picture of the contamination, it looked more like a white film before I poked it with a thermometer then it cracked:  "
2861,Question about Citra hops,"I've brewed my first Citrus-flavored beer last week, using American Citra hops and I'm curious - what gives the hops a Citrus flavor? Is it natural? Or rather inserted artificially when the hops is processed?  Thanks in advance,  Idan "
2862,How to transport liquid yeast?,The home brew shop I go to is about a 45 min drive from my house.   Do I need a cool box or ice pack to get liquid yeast back home and in my fridge?  The guy at the store said that's what I'll need to do but I've read online about people shipping it over multiple days to hot climates and it's been fine.  Thoughts? 
2863,Mold or fermentation not touching the edge of the carboy,"I pressed 35L of apples and the juice was pourred into a clean carboy with a muslin cloth on top, aiming to make wild cider.  After 4 days of no action, this is the carboy at 16h in day 4:   And 4 hours later, by 20h in day 4:    Is my juice infected and if so, can I still save it? Why are the white particles only localized in the middle and not going towards the edges?  Is it possible that the wild-yeast content is not high enough, and that I should get a commercial yeast? Please, any suggestions are welcome!  A closer look:  "
2864,"Fermentation started right after air-locking, but stopped after a few hours","I have 30L of pressed apples. After getting the wild yeast started in one week, I put an air-lock on. This is how my carboy looked right after that operation:    I used organic raw apple cider vinegar as a sanitizing solution in the air-lock. Hope that was a good idea. Anyways, air-lock bubbled for an hour or so right after being set, but after one hour, air-lock activity has stopped. Still, there's a healthy couple fingers of foam on top of the brew, just like in the original picture.  Should I espect air-lock activity to come back within the next few hours/days? Is it normal to get good air-lock activity right after air-locking the carboy and then having it stopped for a while?  I'm a beginner so hope this question is still interesting! Any advice is welcome. "
2865,Can I add some water before I bottle?,"I'm in the final stages of my very first beer, which is a Belgian wit. Everything has gone great so far, and I will be bottling in just a few days. I have a pretty high alcohol content (around 8.2%, which I would like to bring down), and I think my volume is the reason;  I only have maybe 4 gallons of beer.   When bottling day comes, I will be boiling some sugar and adding that to my beer before I bottle. My question is, can I boil the sugar in say a gallon of water, and add that? I want to bring my alcohol content down a bit, and hopefully lighten the color of the beer.   It would make sense to me that I could do this, since what I have right now is essentially a ""slightly dehydrated"" beer. If I can do this, then at what point do I take my ""final"" hydrometer reading?  So the questions again, in quick and to the point form: 1. Can I add a gallon of water to my beer before bottling? 2. If I do this, when do I take a ""final"" hydrometer reading? "
2866,Fermentation locations,"Where is the ideal place to ferment my beer?  Possible locations for me are:   Extra room inside Garage Back porch   Of those three places, which would be the best overall place?  "
2867,Why should I start lagering?,"I'm contemplating my next brew equipment purchase, and it's likely to be a chest freezer, either for lagering or for converting into a kegerator.    I know some of the things I've heard, but what are the compelling characteristics that only lagering can produce?  I've heard it described as a clean, crisp character.  Is there either a more technical, or different way of describing this effect, and is it the sole purpose? "
2868,What are some ways to make low-carb beer?,"I and a few friends have dabbled with the various ""low carb"" diets.  But I've found that after a while, you don't want to break the diet, but just want a beer.  What are some ways to make a beer recipe lower carb?  Bonus question: Is there a way to calculate how many carbs/sugars are in the beer?  I think the fermentation process would mean that sugars that were in the beer are no longer (hence the falling gravity), but what does a FG of (say 1.010) mean in terms of how many grams of carbs/sugars in a beer? "
2869,What happens if a beer gets oxidized?,Everywhere I read it is very cautious about oxidizing your beer.  What is the worst case if your beer gets oxidized?  It tastes funny? 
2870,Adding potassium metabisulphite (i.e. sulfites) to prevent oxidation?,"Winemakers often add potassium metabisulphite to the finished product for two purposes: To prevent further yeast growth (so that they do not eat the remaining sugars) and as a preservative, to prevent oxidation.  Since oxidation is a big concern for brewers, do any homebrewers out there add sulfites to your beers, in order to prevent oxidation and staling?  If so, what are the relevant concerns, and has the result been good? "
2871,What is torrified wheat?,What is torrified wheat and in what styles is it used?    Are there any restriction or special procedures you need to follow to when using torrified wheat?    Can you substitute torrified wheat with malted wheat? 
2872,help: Beer smells bad,"This is my 4th batch (I'm new), but first Belgian ale.  Kit from here: [website]I also did another batch at the same time (different kit) and it seems fine and all my batches up to this point have been ok.  It's been 7 days and I transfered it to a secondary fermenter (cause it says it has heavy sediment and trying to clear some of that out).  Anyways it smells like someone took a crap in a dirty gym sock and dropped that into my beer :(  That indicates it has spoiled right?  Is there any way I can recover this or do I just throw the entire thing out?  Seems such a waste to dump the entire thing out. "
2873,Adding cherry extract at bottling time?,"I have made Cherry ale around Christmas for several years.  This year I forgot to add the cherry extract at the 2nd fermentation, so I added it when I added the sugar prior to bottling.  Will this affect the taste?  could it have effect on carbonation?  My beer this year is flat and has an aftertaste that I don't like.  "
