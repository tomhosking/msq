0,What series is this depiction of Araragi Karen referring to?,"In episode 8 of Nisemonogatari, we briefly see Araragi Karen drawn like this:    This looked a lot like some anime (or possibly a character from an anime or manga) I'd seen within the last ten years or so while in Asia, so I have the feeling this drawing style was supposed to allude to something. (Possibly Dr. Slump? I'm not sure since I don't think I ever saw the anime, and I could easily have mixed it up with something else.)  That said, this also looks ""generic"" enough that's possible that this is only a shift in drawing style. But then right before this image, there's a drawing of Karen that looked  like (to me anyway: I have a feeling I'm wrong about this) an imitation of the titular character of Chibi Maruko-chan, so I'm not sure:    Moreover, I remember seeing something that looked very much like a parody of Peko-chan in an earlier episode, though unfortunately I don't remember which one it was:    Is this (the first image, I mean) supposed to be an allusion to some other anime series, and if so, what is it referring to? "
1,Have characters' voice actors in Fate/ always been the same?,"I've been wondering, between Fate/Zero, Fate/Stay Night Realta Nua, Fate/Stay Night (anime), Unlimited Blade Works (movie), Fate/Extra, Fate/Extra CCC and Fate/kaleid liner PRISMA☆ILLYA (and to an extent Carnival Phantasm), have the same Japanese voice actors been employed for returning characters (e.g. Saber-Arturia, Gilgamesh, Rin, Ilya, EMIYA)?  Also, if they have remained the same, is there any confirmation that Fate/Hollow Ataraxia on the PS Vita will follow the same trend? "
2,What exactly are the rollbacks in Higurashi?,"We know that the ""mini-arcs"" in Higurashi (When They Cry) all start with a sudden rollback. After some terrible events, the town looks normal again.   Closer to the end of the anime we are being shown that       It's Hanyū who is responsible for the rollbacks, and she helps Rika keep her memories of what happened before the ""rollback""   Now my question is about what those ""rollbacks"" really are. The wiki article, for example, says that they are       time travels, and what Hanyū does is reverses time to let Rika relive those days again.   However, when I was watching the anime itself, I clearly remember Rika saying that      what they did was traveling between ""worlds"", trying to find a ""world"" where everything was right (i.e. no murders).    Basically, if the first version is right, then       all the murders didn't actually happen, because the time was reversed each time. In the second case (changing ""worlds""), however, all those murders would be for real in each particular world.   Was that possibly just a bad/false translation of the subtitles I was using? And which version is right, after all? "
3,What does the fist bump mean in Naruto?,"At first I thought Killer Bee only used it as a rap gesture.  Later on it was shown as a way to compare and equalize forces between two people. Even later, Naruto was shown doing it with Kurama, to fuse their chakra together.   Does the fist bump have any special meaning? I doubt it originated in Japanese culture or mythology, so where did it come from?  "
4,"Mecha anime where boy pilots small, somewhat feminine robot that can teleport to him","I found one post on this site that might be about the same anime that I'm looking for. It's not answered and already closed.  From that question, [website]  It was about a boy who gets involved in some kind of (military? government?) mech program. There are already some other people there piloting mecha. The boy forms some kind of connection with a mecha that is smaller than the rest, and also somewhat feminine-looking. At least, it seemed to have high heels on its feet.     Not sure but I think I watched it the late 1990s.  Now, what I remember is that, that boy also gets another, big yellow robot. Once, when his fraction is under attack and he gets cornered in a corridor, he steps back and surprisingly appears in that yellow robot, it turns on and he starts fighting.  The small robot isn't usual. It's not just standing there and waiting for that boy to drive it. Boy and small robot, they have some kind of spiritual connection. Boy can call him and the robot somehow teleports to him. He also can combine that small and big yellow robot.  And I also remember that scene when that boy is stack in a big spaceship, which is about to explode and he calls that small robot but it's not teleporting.  I think these shows are the same; does anybody know it? "
5,"In Naruto Gaiden: The Seventh Hokage, who is this blue-haired guy sitting next to Boruto?","In Naruto Gaiden: The Seventh Hokage manga, page 3    Who is the guy with blue hair sitting next to Boruto?  Is it a new character or did I miss something from Naruto? "
6,Are anime and manga subsidized or actively used by Japanese government to promote Japanese culture/relations internationally?,"Around 2003-2005, Japan External Trade Organization (JETRO) produces some documents highlighting the importance of manga and anime to promote Japan culture and international/business relations overseas.  The now unavailable online issue of Jetro Business Topics, ""Japan's Soft Power Moves into the Limelight"" (2 Sept 2004) by Tsutomu Sugiura, Marubeni Research Institute director at time, stated:     If, for instance, children overseas learn to love anime, they may continue to feel a fondness for things Japanese as they grow older. And it is possible that such friendly feelings will translate into business deals involving Japan after they become adults.   directly citing the Soft Power concept by Joseph Nye. Similar concepts are expressed here by the same Tsutomu Sugiura, identifying the phenomena as ""third wave of Japonism"", where animation and videogames are:     capturing the essence of Japanese character and lifestyle disseminates Japanese culture and Japanese soul to young people the world over   A document produced by JETRO Economic Research Department on March 2005 titled ""Cool Japan's Economy Warms Up"" associate it with the ""Gross National Cool"" cultural index theorized by Douglas McGray, and soft power concept is cited again.  After 7 years, are these concept actually implemented by the Japanese administration? Are there documents related to direct intervention by the Japanese government to spread or boost the anime and manga industry overseas aiming to these goals in international relations? "
7,Ghost in the Shell: Who's Marcelo?,"Exactly who was Marcelo? In Ghost in the Shell SAC episode 7, we see that the major and co were chasing after him to know exactly what business he had entering Japan, but they never explain what happens, more specifically why did Sec9 allow him to just roam freely. Isn't he a notorious drug lord? "
8,"What language is the song ""Fallen Heroes"" in Akame ga Kill?","So just as the title says, what is the language of the song ""Fallen Heroes"", also known as ""Le chant de Roma""? (YouTube link)  I have done a bit of personal research before posting over here and what I came up with is that it is not any of the following languages: Italian, Greek, Spanish, Lithuanian, Roumanian, English, German, Portuguese, Hindi. I don't feel like it should be Japanese nor Chinese, and if it is Latin, then it's sung pretty badly...  I could not find any lyrics, so if someone knows where to find them it would be helpful. Otherwise, I have posted a link for the song in case any native speakers of languages that I have not mentioned above could check whether it is their own language.   My best hypothesis is that it's Roma, although I do not know the language. "
9,Why Eren can't fully transform?,"In season 3 episode 1 they show Eren can't transform properly, having shorter legs, less ""meat"" and not reaching 10 meters with his titan. Why is this so? Why can't Eren fully transform? AFAIR he never transformed half way before "
10,"Why didn't Chibi-usa initially recognize Sailors Mercury, Mars, Jupiter, & Venus as her friends?","In the R season of the classic anime of Sailor Moon, Chibi-usa had a flashback memory of her surprise birthday party in the 30th century Crystal Tokyo, in which Sailor Mercury, Sailor Mars, Sailor Jupiter, and Sailor Venus were present (Wiseman made use of the piece of memory of the span of time during which the secret about the surprise was being kept from her in order to turn Chibi-usa into Black Lady). Chibi-usa also had a faint memory of the same four sailor soldiers fleeing with her while Crystal Tokyo was being attacked, but in this memory, the four people are darkened silhouettes. I can understand that, due to the trauma of the attack and worry about her mom, Chibi-usa might not remember clearly who helped her escape. After these events, she time-traveled to the 20th century where she met Sailors Moon, Mercury, Mars, Jupiter, and Venus in their solider forms (as well as met them in their civilian forms).  If Chibi-usa had the clear memory of the birthday party, why didn't she immediately recognize those same four sailor soldiers when she ""re-met"" them in the 20th century? Didn't the party scene indicate that they were her friends and she knew their names?  Is this a plot hole?  (The manga does not feature the birthday party memory, so I am looking for answers regarding an in-universe explanation for the classic anime canon.) "
11,Does D always get the special power of the dragon they vanquish?,"In the series, it is shown Yuu learns how to use antigravity, and Mitsuki can make antimatter.  Since the anime ends just after they defeat Basilisk, did any of them learned to use catastrophe?  Does it happen to the other dragons they kill in the Light Novel? "
12,Why does Bermuda always address characters as -kun?,"In the manga of Katekyo Hitman Reborn! (also commonly just ""Reborn!"" for obvious reasons) after the future and Shimon Arc ends, the Arcabaleno Arc begins and reveals that:      Bermuda, the arcobaleno of the eighth element of night, bargains with Reborn in Chapter 384-ish to take his life for future generations and use his life to kill Checker Face.    While reading it, I noticed Bermuda calls all characters ""-kun""! Since it's obviously a term more for guys, and yet it was used on Chrome and weaker players like Lal Mirch etc., I thought it was a little strange. I don't think it's a translation error either - since 「―くん」is pretty obviously ""-kun"".  Is there any explanation for this? Is it something to do with his personality?  "
13,Why do the Sannoh players all have buzz cut hair?,"Sannoh, the defending national champions, are a team of buzz cut hair. Here are their starters:    Even their substitute (Mikio) has the same haircut:    This gives the team a very distinctive appearance and no doubt makes them look intimidating.   Was it ever explained in the manga (or other media) why they all have this haircut? Were they based on some real-life team or players that had this haircut?  "
14,Do the regions in Soul Eater match perfectly to the real world?,"The Death Sycthes' manage real world regions as like a replacement to Death's Eight Guardians, they are.    Spirit Albarn - North America  Marie Mjolnir - Oceania  Azusa Yumi - Eastern Asia  Justin Law - Western Europe  Tezca Tlipoca - South America  Tsar Pushka - Eastern Europe  Deng Dinga and Djinn Galland - Africa and Western Asia (How Wikipedia list them, not sure which is which)   I am wondering if these region are the same as the regions in our world? if so would that make Death City be located in North America? "
15,What are the highlights in eyes called?,"In anime, character eyes usually have highlights that are usually white. They seem like a light reflection or something.     Do the highlights have a name? What are they supposed to be? "
16,What anime is this video featuring girls wearing Nazi armband from? (NSFW),"My friend sends me this video of an anime featuring what seems to be Nazi (?)  [website]Neither of us knows what anime it was from. Does anyone know?  Below is a SFW screenshot, as requested:   "
17,How did the society where the story of Shin Sekai Yori takes place come to be?,"How did the society where the story of Shin Sekai Yori takes place come to be? i.e. How did Saki's Society came to existence from the societies of the Dark age?  I am curious about how Saki's society came to be because, in her society, there is knowledge about science (implied from their knowledge about genes). However, part of it is also mixed with aspects of less modern societies, which makes me want to know how these different aspects came about, from previous societies during the Dark age.  Furthermore, there are these ""creatures"" called false Minoshiro which seem to be some kind of very advanced bio-technology, which suggest very advanced technology (but their society doesn't really live that way). With these different aspects of ancient Japanese societies and much newer societies, how did Saki's society came to existence? Why does it have this mix of modern technology and more ancient aspects? What happened to the previous Dynasties during the dark age? Did they combine/converge to form the modern society which Saki lives at? From which dynasty from the Dark age did they come from and what do we know that explains their present society?  As a refresher, here are some of the dynasties from the dark age:   1st, Slave Dynasties, Where PK users controlled those without PK capabilities. 2nd, non-PK users who escaped the Dynasties and lived as hunter-gatherers. 3rd, Bandits who used PK to attack other settlements.  4th, a group of those who managed to preserve some remnants of the technological age.  "
18,What is the connection between the Cowboy Bebop anime and the movie?,"According to Wikipedia, the movie is a midquel that takes place between episodes 22 and 23 of the anime.  Having seen both the movie and the anime, I don't recall any connection that made it essential for it to be viewed in this order. I don't recall anything that had happened in the anime to be vital for the movie, and I don't remember anything that happened in the movie to be vital for episodes 23 onwards.  Am I missing something? Or does it fit between episodes 22 and 23 simply because the authors thought about it like that (maybe the authors thought about the timeline like that, although it may be irrelevant?)? "
19,How does an official anthology for a manga series get created?,"So, doujinshi are rather common in Japan. However, it seems that doujinshi, especially ones that are derivative works of an existing series, usually only appear in limited non-commercial circulation, such as at doujinshi conventions, in doujin shops, or on art sites like Pixiv.  But sometimes, there are official doujinshi anthologies that seem to be officially endorsed by the publisher, and are published commercially alongside the source material?  These anthology volumes are typically collections of non-canon oneshots from various third-party manga artists. These stories are basically the same kind of stories that you'd find at a doujinshi convention; the only difference is, these stories are being officially published, so I guess they're not technically doujinshi, although they do feel very similar in spirit...  Some examples that I know of:   Lucky Star: Comic à la Carte Haruhi Comic Anthology K-On! Anthology Comic Puella Magi Madoka Magica: Anthology Comic Kagerou Daze Official Anthology Comic (including Upper, Downer, Summer, Winter, Spring, Bitter, Sweet, Spicy, Fantasy, etc.) Pop Team Epic Hoshiiro Girldrop Comic Anthology Slow Start Anthology Comic Citrus Comic Anthology It looks like Bloom Into You is getting an anthology too...   So my question is, what is exactly the process for the creation of an official comic anthology?  For example, how does the publisher decide whether to create one or not? Why do some series have official anthologies while others don't? Is the original creator involved?  How do they decide who will be included in the anthology and who won't? Do they just call up various manga artists directly, asking if they want to contribute a chapter to the anthology, or do they put up a notice somewhere?  Just something that I've been wondering about. "
20,What is Hidan's Source of Power?,"  Hidan is probably the most misunderstood character in Naruto. He has the ability to survive pretty much anything (including decapitation), and is able to remote-injure opponents whose blood he tasted, and while he's inside his cursed circle.  Where did this power come from? What kind of technique is that? Every single technique used in Naruto so far has been explained to some degree, besides this one.  Do anyone has some information to shed light on the technique? From the Data Book perhaps? "
21,Why didn't Naruto's Rasengan beat Sasuke's Chidori?,"According to Kakashi, there are 5 fundamental chakra natures: fire, wind, lightning, earth, and water. Each nature is superior than another, and inferior to a different one.    Focusing on wind and lightning chakras, Naruto's only nature chakra is wind, so the Rasengan must be a wind-type jutsu. Chidori, of course, is lighting. Kakashi said to Naruto that, using wind chakra, he cannot defeat Sasuke's fire abilities, but against lightning, wind can easily beat his lightning jutsus.   This leads me to my question...    In the Naruto series, there are many occurrences where Naruto clashes with Sasuke. Their battles always end with a Rasengan against Chidori blast.  Since Rasengan is generally wind-type and Chidori is lightning, shouldn't Rasengan easily beat Chidori? I can't imagine how a lighting style jutsu can match, even beat a wind-style jutsus. Maybe Kishimoto accidentally forgot about wind's superiority over lightning, but I just want to ask: can someone explain? "
22,What exactly is a false minoshiro in Shinsekai Yori?,"I was quite curious to know what exactly a false minoshiro is.  For me, they seem to be some kind of bio-technology ""machine"" or cyborg or something of that sort, that has the capability of storing a lot of information. The reason I think they are not ""naturally"" occurring is because of the way they talk, which seems to be similar to machine speech. However, they also seem to be similar to living beings, because the false minoshiro was able to surpass the program denying access to its data in order to be spared by Saki and her friend. Basically, what exactly are they, and where did they come from? Is that ever explained in the anime or the novel? "
23,What are the instances where a Weekly Shounen Jump serialized manga would not be released in a given week?,"What are the instances that there is no manga (like Naruto, Bleach and One Peace) release? Are there certain events that prevent them from releasing? Then what are these events (aside from taking a break)? Is there some sort of calendar of events for this?. "
24,What does Viktor yell in Yuri On Ice?,"Is he yelling ""kusnav"" or like ""kusnov""?  What does it even mean ... couldn't find anything on the webs - am I heavily mistyping it? "
25,Which episodes of the Naruto anime are core plot and which are filler?,"For both the original Naruto series and Shippuuden, which episodes should I watch if I want to avoid the filler? I'm only interested in core plot and character developments.  To make this question a bit more concrete: Which episodes are directly based off the manga, and which were produced with unique content for only the anime? At what points did the anime ""catch up"" to the manga and require non-manga-related content to continue airing episodes while the manga produced new content? "
26,Has there been a study or documentary on the influence of Ani-song themes on Japan's music scene?,"As noted on How are the themes and songs picked for a particular series?, some anime openings are created for their show; thus, the song and anime theme usually coincide and work together.  Since these songs are widely promoted in Japanese society (and consumed largely by young ones that regard them highly as they grow), I guess these themes heavily influence Japan's music scene too.   At least the influence of early video game music is easy to note. The wide spread of anisons has to have had an influence in musicians.  Sure, the trace of influence might start with the society itself as in Society/Home → Author Experience → Piece of Work → Anime+Anison, and then feeds back to Society.  The background of the question  I think that there's a lot more of songs that talk about peers understanding (in love, hurting, etc) in Japan than in Western music. The motivation for this question is to prove or disprove, since I'm making the assumption that these anisons lyrics/themes have influenced current Japanese song writers.  I do believe that Japanese writers express the need of Japan's society to communicate their problems to others and to understand other people struggles.   But there has been any study or documentary talking about this?  Even a formal investigation about this theme bias I see in the lyrics of Japan's music bands works. And sure, this might be just my imagination, is really uncommon that theme on western songs?    An example of these kind of differences between japanese music and western music is noted by Marty Friedman (former Megadeath guitarist). But what he talks about is the music composition, not the topics on jpop/jrock lyrics.  "
27,What's so important about hibernating?,"Why do they need to hibernate? Chisaki is on the surface and didn't fall asleep, and I don't see her become sick and all, which means that it's fine if they don't hibernate.  Also, Hikari, Manaka, and Kaname didn't age after hibernation. Why is that? Is it that everyone who hibernates doesn't get older? And why are they naked? None of other Shioshishio villagers lose their clothes when they hibernate.  This is picture of Manaka hibernating; she didn't age or wear any clothes.   "
28,What is the meaning of Arakawa Under the Bridge's opening theme song?,"I'm kinda wondering what the opening theme song of Arakawa Under the Bridge, Venus and Jesus lyrics mean.  On the third stanza,     A neighbor of Venus   Why? During that interval that we don't know   Jesus lives across the hall   I'm hearing something bad      It mentions the name, Jesus. What does that stanza imply? Does it have something to do with the Christian religion?      A neighbor of Venus   Maybe, Earth?      Why? During that interval that we don't know   Interval we don't know? Maybe, before the concept of time existed?   There are also other lines that I don't quite understand.   Lyrics taken from Lyrics Translate. "
29,Why isn't Tobi blind yet?,"There is a Naruto character named Tobi who maintains his eyesight though his special ability should have caused a great amount of macular degeneration. The following includes extensive spoilers.      By my math, Tobi possesses his Mangekyo for quite some years. It is his Mangekyo, he stated it himself. So in that case, how come he hadn't gone blind yet? Itachi went almost completely blind in under 10 years. Sasuke got half blind in less than 1 year (because he abused it freely).   So how come Tobi hasn't gone blind? As far as I can figure:      He obviously replaced his other eye, but it was kept behind his one-eyed mask for a long period of time, he didn't use it for vision.  "
30,Why are there so many references in Durarara?,"I have currently watched nine episodes of Durarara!! and I am surprised about how many references there are. Some are quite obvious (they even talk about Accel World or Spice and Wolf sometimes):    Some others not so obvious:    (It's the Baccano-screen.)  I can understand these, as all three are published by Dengeki Bunko, but why are there so many? Also, I don't understand why they included Yozakura Quartet, since it's a manga and no Light Novel?   "
31,Did Kakashi's sharingan evolve because Obito was watching?,"Both Kakashi and Obito awaken their Mangekyou at the same time as told in this question When did Kakashi and Obito awaken their Mangekyou Sharingan?  The sharingan Kakashi owns originally came from Obito, so is it due to Obito also being there at the moment Rin died that Kakashi's Mangekyou also awakend? Or asked in a different way. Would Kakashi have been able to awaken the Mangekyou without Obito being there? "
32,Can the reanimation jutsu bring back a person at any age?,"In Naruto Shippuuden, does the Summoning: Reanimation Jutsu bring a dead person to the real world at any wanted age? (Young/Adult/Old) Or does it bring the person back at the age they died?  Because we have seen that Reanimation Jutsu brought back the Third Hokage as on old geezer. Which was the same as when he was at deathbed. But Madara Uchiha was revived as a younger version of himself, instead of his old age. "
33,Is there such a thing as an 'Indie'/Alternative anime scene?,"Having followed anime for some time, one thing I have noticed, at least from my perspective, is that there is no equivalent of the Indie/Alternative scene when it comes to anime.  What I mean by this is that the vast majority of anime seems to be produced and distributed by some corporate production studio(s). While my knowledge of anime production is quite limited, this would seem to hold for most anime.  What reasons are there for this trend or am I wrong in assuming the lack of an alternative scene?  If I am wrong, then what can be considered as Indie anime?   Notes: In response to Euphorics's comment, 'Anime' in this context refers to any and all forms of Japanese animated media. The form of distribution, length and animation style are the kind of details I'm looking for in the answers.  Additionally, I am aware of the existence of Doujinshi as a form of independently made Manga, although I wasn't aware of the fact that it included music as well (Thank you Rapitor for that) but I am mainly interested in the animated medium in the context of this question. "
34,Can Dragonslayers eat their own magic?,"Early in the anime, Lucy asked Natsu if he could eat his own fire.  Natsu explained that it would be like Lucy eating one of her Celestial Spirits. While this tells us that Natsu won't do it, it leaves the possibility open.  Given how Angel treated her spirits, I could imagine a more evil wizard being willing to eat their spirit if desperate enough.  So, could a more evil dragon slayer eat their own magic?  Would it make them more powerful or just back to the state they were in prior to casting the spell? "
35,What's the difference between the Full Moon wo Sagashite manga and anime?,"I read a lot of the Full Moon wo Sagashite manga a few years ago and recently started watching the anime. It's been so long since I read the manga that I can't tell how much is different, but I remember my friend telling me a few years ago that they are very different.  Is there a lot of filler in the anime? Is the plot/story significantly different?  Please mark any spoilers as corresponding to either the manga or anime so those who have only seen one or the other don't get spoiled if they don't want to.  (If my friend was blatantly wrong and they are pretty darn close, I apologize and don't mind having the question closed.) "
36,Are gym masters easy to beat?,"Gym masters are dedicated to train their Pokemon and and are very familiar with their environment. They should have a vast advantage over trainers, especially younger ones.  If that is the case, why don't they defeat more trainers? Shouldnt only trainers with comparable experience defeat them? Ash can defeat much older masters who have been training for decades. Is it just to advance the story or is there a rational explanation? "
37,"Is ""The ravages of time"" a romantic manga?",Is the manga romantic? Does it even have a female character? 
38,How did Nagato gain his Rinnegan?,"How was it exactly that Nagato came upon his Rinnegan?  Madara states that it was his, and that he gave it to him: how did he do that? Did he transplant it into Nagato, or did he transfer it otherwise?  Note: I do not recall whether this was explained in the manga or not. "
39,Dragon Ball Super release date,"I'm sure you've heard the news about the new Dragon Ball series Dragon Ball Super, made by Akira Toriyama.  I've read about it and the release date is in June or July (can't remember). We're talking about manga, right or brand new episodes?  If it's just the manga, is it already known when we can expect brand new Dragon Ball episodes? "
40,What does the symbol on Edward's coat mean?,"In FMA, the back of Edward's coat shows this symbol:    I can't figure out what it would be a reference to in-universe, because the symbology seems Judeo-Christian (a cross and what looks like it could be a serpent), and the show doesn't really have any Christian symbology in it. Is this some symbol in real life? What is it supposed to mean? "
41,How did Naruto elude the Ninja chasing him at the start of Episode 1?,"Everyone who has watched Naruto knows that Naruto isn't good at clone jutsu. However, there's a part which confuses me: how did he elude those 2 guys chasing him after he steals that forbidden scroll in the first episode?   In the anime, from 1:40 to 1:50, it showed the same wall where Naruto passed by and followed by 2 guys. Then, 1-2 secs later Naruto was revealed hiding behind the wallpaper. How did he do that? He couldn't have used a transformation jutsu; if he did he could just stay in the transform jutsu. He shouldn't be faster than Chuunin or Jounin, but from 1:41-1:45 it showed them chasing him at the same speed (Although, if they have higher speed than Naruto, they would have caught him). "
42,What do Seiyuu do after they are no longer at the peak of their fame?,"Before they are famous, many seiyuu would work part-time whether it be at fast food restaurants or even physical works. For example the seiyuu Uchida Aya:     During the early stages of her career she supported herself with part-time jobs such as being sales staff at departmental stores, production line quality inspector at factories, and sometimes even menial labor carrying cardboard boxes. The key criteria she had in choosing her jobs were that they had to be shift-based and versatile such that she could report to her entertainment office any time she needed to.2   Others also have career as eroge seiyuu (Nitta Emi, voiced a character in an eroge, Da Capo III), before they went famous and might continue even after they are famous, such as Itou Shizuka and Asakawa Yuu.  Like all entertainment job, a seiyuu job has its peak, and after that peak is over, the number of job offers one receive would reduce. I'm curious as to what does a seiyuu that is no longer at their peak of fame do for a living when they no longer have many anime to voice? Do they work on eroge? Or just normal games? Or they turn into salary-man/woman (office workers)? Please give some examples with your answer.  Edit 1:  If they retire at age of 40 or so (which is already stretching it as most female seiyuu would see the peak of their fame at their 25s, while the male ones would still be able to retain their fame longer), then they still have around 30 to 50 years of life ahead as a retired seiyuu. Certainly they would still need some jobs that earn them money to support their living, which is what this question is about. This is especially true since seiyuu don't get royalties from having their voice recorded, unlike singers. Mangaka gets their royalties from every copy of goods that is produced from the series they make.  krazer suggested that they are like athletes and other celebrities, they retire. Many athletes continue working after they retire from their professional career. Some famous footballer becomes a coach, for example, Zinedine Zidane, Antonio Conte, Diego Simeone, Pep Guardiola, and many more. But as for seiyuu, I never heard of a seiyuu that turned into a voice-acting coach.  senshin suggested that they do Hollywood dubs, while Aki Tanaka suggested that they do freelance voice-acting and voicing for mobile games. Problem with this is that as Aki has mentioned, it is not regular, while their living bills (accommodation, food, etc) still needs to be paid regularly. And with the seiyuu being no longer at the peak of his/her fame, freelancing might not be enough to earn them the money they need. Also I don't think the number of such job available is not much. I mean how many hollywood movies are being dubbed into Japanese anyway? I bet not much. Only the famous ones would see itself being shown in Japan. As I noticed from games such as Chain Chronicles, Kancolle and Panzer Waltz, one seiyuu voice several characters in such games.  Thus, I think the number of jobs available from dubbing Hollywood movies and mobile games won't be that much, and they still have to compete with seiyuu that is still at the peak of their fame, plus the rookie seiyuu as they are often also chosen to mitigate the production cost.

45,How can I see if legal anime subs are available in a certain language for streaming?,"I'd like to watch anime (legally) with French subtitles (while not in a French-speaking region), since I'm trying to improve my French. How can I easily see anime that has French subtitles available legally? Some sites (namely Crunchyroll) have non-English subtitles, but it's impossible to see whether or not a specific series has those non-English subtitles available until I get to the episode page (or possibly a page for the series - I'm not completely sure).  I would like to be able to have sort of list to see whether or not I can watch anime X in language Y (or possibly at least have some way to know this without looking at specific entries for each series). How can this be done? With some languages such as English or Chinese it's generally pretty simple, but with others it doesn't seem as clear. "
46,Where is this girl in a maid uniform holding a cat from?,"I ran into this picture while on the internet. This was referred to as a fictional character, and judging from the art style it's probably from an anime or manga.    Where is this character from? I tried running a Google Image Search but for some reason nothing useful came up for me. Or is this just some fan-made original character? "
47,How did Netero manage to levitate during his fight with Meruem?,"I recently rewatched the epic battle between Netero and Meruem in the 2011 anime. I noticed that most of the time, Netero ""floated"" in front of his summoned Kannon. (I am lazy now to include snapshots, but believe me, he was not just ""jumping"").  IIRC, in the final battle in The Last Mission movie, Netero stood in front of his Kannon by standing on one of Kannon's palms, which was a very clever and reasonable way to keep a high position.  This leads me to question: How did Netero manage to levitate during his fight with Meruem?  So far (both in the manga and the anime), no Nen user was shown levitating, just flying at best (and using wings in those cases). Of course, the answer to my question can be ""By using Nen"", but frankly, it would be a very inefficient way to use it (c'mon, just reserve one of Kannon's palms to lift you, and leave the other 99 for ""ant swatting"").  ADDENDUM: The scene that made me think about all this is in episode 126 at 6:17 "
48,Why did Aleister create the Science Side?,"Why did Aleister create the Science Side? Do we actually know?  From TVTropes:      Reality Warper: He is capable of omnipresence and other tricks. Confirmed when it is revealed at the end of New Testament volume 11 that he possesses something called the Archetype Controller, which can basically create or destroy Jungian archetypes, which would be like the equivalent of controlling tropes, in a way. It is revealed that, using this power, he literally created the entire concept of a ""Science side"", and made Academy City and its espers part of the archetype of ""mankind’s worship of science"".  "
49,Is it possible for a Byakugan user to awaken the Rinnegan?,"Well... the title says it!  I ask this because, supposedly, Hyuuga and Uchiha are descendants of the Rikudou's eldest son (at least I am under that impression). In that way, does the Byakugan have any other special techniques that can be awakened (such as Tsukuyomi, Susano'o and Amaterasu in the Sharingan), and can it (ultimately) awaken the Rinnegan?  So far we have not seen techniques that derive from the Byakugan itself, but rather techniques that are possible because of it: the whole Hyuuga fighting style comes from the use of Byakugan, but it is not related to it in the same way that every Mangekyou technique is related to the Sharingan. They were only able to develop/and use it properly due to them having the Byakugan, but (again) it does not relate to it in the same way the Mangekyou relates to the Sharingan.  To sum up: Is it possible for a Byakugan user to awaken a Rinnegan? "
50,"What did Ikta mean when he said ""...Right now, you’re really red...""?","Towards the end of episode 4 of the anime, Ikta says      “Yo, Yatori, there’s something important I need to tell you. You might   already know it, though… Right now, you’re really red, you know?”   Which makes sense in context for Yatorie: red hair, red blood, adrenaline, etc.  What doesn't make sense is when he said it to the princess a few minutes later:     “And by the way, I won’t mention it anywhere else, but I’ll tell you privately in secret…. Princess, right now, you’re really red.”    What does it mean when Ikta said that to the princess?  Was he trying to flirt?  Was he trying to look cool?  Quotes came from here, which seems to be a slightly different story than the anime. "
51,Is there a meaning/message behind Akira?,Is there some hidden meaning/message in Akira?

53,"What is the meaning and significance of the word ""Sunagimo Umataro"" (砂肝うま太郎) in Yuyushiki?","In Episode 2 of the anime Yuyushiki, Nonohara Yuzuko drew something in response to Hinata Yukari's drawing of a strange penguin-like creature, and wrote down ""Sunagimo Umataro"" (砂肝うま太郎) on the same page. After some search on the Internet, I now know that ""Sunagimo"" means ""gizzard"", which is a digestive organ in chickens and ducks that may be made into food, and ""uma"" is just a way of saying ""delicious"". It seems to me that ""Sunagimo Umataro"" is a name that Yuzuko came up for the creature in the drawing, but I am still not smart enough to connect all the dots and make a meaning out of this. Specifically, I am having trouble figuring out   What exactly are those items that appear in Yuzuko's drawing? How is the drawing supposed to be connected to the name ""Sunagimo Umataro""?   I apologize if this is question has an obvious answer. (Maybe Yuyushiki is just too difficult for me!)   "
54,What was Akamatsu Ken's role in creating Negima!? Neo?,"Mahou Sensei Negima! is a manga by Akamatsu Ken which has had an anime and live action adaptation of the same name.  There is also another manga called Negima!? Neo by Fujima Takuya which was made into an anime titled Negima!?. Wikipedia says that Fujima is the author and Akamatsu merely provided guidance. MAL, however, credits Akamatsu as a story author (along with Fujima).  Is there any official statement on Akamatsu's role in Negima!? Neo?  I mostly want to know if he played a major role in its creation or just basically made sure Fujima didn't completely ruin his series and/or its' reputation. "

Are these all flowers that really exist? If so, what are their names and their significance? And if not, what are they supposed to imply about each character? What is the significance of each different kind of flower for each of the girls? "
56,Is No Face from Spirited Away based on any traditional Japanese legends?,"Spirited Away borrows a lot of its side characters from various Japanese legends, although many are also original. One of the most mysterious such characters is No Face, who is perhaps slightly antagonistic, and comes off as a spirit of greed or something to that effect. The concept for No Face is very unique with a collection of strange powers that I don't know of in any other mythological spirit, suggesting to me that he might be a unique creation of Miyazaki.  Are there any comments by Miyazaki on the origin of No Face? Barring that, is there a clear origin in some Japanese mythology, or is he an original creation? "

58,How did Araragi become tolerant to the sun?,"In the beginning of Kizumonogatari Tekketsu-hen,      Araragi is burnt because he is exposed to the sun.   I thought he would become sun tolerant after he is 'cured' of being a vampire since he can walk in the sun without problems in the other seasons.  However, there is a scene in Nekketsu-hen where      he is having a chitchat with Hanekawa out in the open.   Is this some kind of inconsistency? Or did something happen in between? "
59,Where does the big weapon battle trope in chuunibyou come from?,"When Rika and the others released their chuunibyou power, they have a huge weapon and use it like it was nothing.

65,How is it that non reliable mangakas get work again and again?,"I've seen it time and again that a mangaka just stops what he/she is doing as he / she looses interest and starts the next project instead.  A very big example includes here ""Candidate for Goddess"". The Mangaka who created it was and is known for doing that time and again.   What really surprises me is that they just get work again and again despite their tendencies (and they even being KNOWN for that). In other branches (programmers as example) you are a goner from the market when you start doing that.   So my question here is is there any infos available on WHY Mangakas who are known for not finishing their work and instead starting something anew get work again and again seemingly very easily? (is it something cultural I'm overlooking here, or is it something else at work here?) "

67,Why is Maria Watches Over Us season 3 referred to as an OVA season?,"Season 1, 2 and 4 of Maria Watches Over Us are just normal seasons, but season 3 is described as an OVA season.  Like Maria Watches Over Us season 3, Full Metal Panic and Baka and Test both had a season set in between 2 seasons, which was an OVA series (Full Metal Panic had Full Metal Panic? Fumoffu, Baka and Test had Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu: Matsuri). However, in cases of Full Metal Panic and Baka and Test, neither OVA series was counted as a season.  I am wondering: Why was the OVA season of Maria Watches Over Us named the third season instead of making the 4th season the 3rd season, like the case with Baka and Test and Full Metal Panic? "
68,What was the deal with Haruhi's Endless Eight?,"In Haruhi second season, there was 8 episodes that have been the same. The series of ""Endless Eight"" episodes are literally doing the same things over and over again. But it's not really the same thing, they re-animating and re-dubbing whole episode, they didn't being lazy and use the same source.  Here's the same sequence of different episodes when Haruhi called Kyon to ask him to swim with others at the pool:    As you can see they give different tones, angles, outfits, etc. That's too much effort for same situation all over the episode for eight episodes straight. So why did they doing it? Did they also did it in light novel? What is the point of ""Endless Eight""? "
69,"Why do anime series change titles so often (nearly for every ""season"")?","I've always wondered this, but why do anime series titles change so often whenever it gets a new ""season""?  I mean, I understand that the title stays the same for long running series, like Bleach or One Piece, but why do new ""seasons"" for one or two cour anime have slightly different names? For example...   To Aru Kagaku no Railgun, To Aru Kagaku no Railgun S Zero no Tsukaima, Zero no Tsukaima: Futatsuki no Kishi, Zero no Tsukaima: Princesses no Rondo, Zero no Tsukaima F Medaka Box, Medaka Box Abnormal Sword Art Online, Sword Art Online II Ore no Imouto ga Konna ni Kawaii Wake ga Nai, Ore no Imouto ga Konna ni Kawaii Wake ga Nai.  K-On!, K-On!!   I'm particularly interested in the last two, where the only noticeable difference in the title is a punctuation mark. They're all direct sequels, so why not just give it the same name as the first season, like in American television? The source material keeps its name throughout its entire life (e.g. there was never a Naruto: Shippuuden manga or a Shakugan no Shana III light novel), so why do their anime adaptations get different titles?  Is there a legal thing in Japan which disallows a production for one ""season"" to have the same name as another, for clarification purposes? Or do the producers/whoever chooses the names just want to attract more fans by making a distinction between different ""seasons""?   Some insight into how the airing of anime works would be much appreciated. "
70,Mirai Nikki ending?,"Can anyone explain how is it that      Yuno not only crossed universes, but shattered the wall of space time? It seemed like there would not be another death-game in the 3rd universe since the contestants all lost their will for fighting due to causality breaking down. How is she there? And why is Deus just sitting back letting them universe hop?   I looked into the manga's last chapter sense the anime kind of left it up to imagination in the final scenes but I'm still confused. Below is how the manga describes it:         "
71,Is it possible to combine all five chakra elements?,"The title says it all... but I'll elaborate:   Initially we see techniques derived from a single chakra element (Katon, Doton, Suiton, Fuuton and Raiton). These are the most common, since usually a ninja can master only one chakra nature (since normally ninjas tend to have an affiliation with only one chakra nature)   Later we discover these can be combined in a number of ways, creating new elements (Mokuton=Doton+Suiton, Ranton=Raiton+Suiton, Youton=Katon+Doton, among several others). From what I understand, these are usually transmitted as a Kekkei Genkai. But I believe they can also be created by the combinations of the elements, by ninja who didn't inherit it from other generations (correct me if I'm wrong). These are not uncommon, but less frequent than the ones above (there are ninja who can master and possess affiliation to more than one chakra nature: Sasuke comes to mind, since he can master both Katon and Raiton. Katon is his clan's natural affiliation, and he mastered Raiton too. However, I don't remember if he has ever combined the both of them)   Even later, we find about combinations of even more elements by ninja who can master several elements, such as Muu (Nidaime Tsuchikage) and Oonoki (Sandaime Tsuchikage), who can combine Katon, Doton and Fuuton, to create Jinton. These are called Kekkei Touta. I don't know if they can also be transmitted through Kekkei Genkai, or if they can only be taught. They are even rarer than the ones above, since ninja can rarely master or be naturally affiliated to more than two chakra natures (Terumii Mei the Godaime Mizukage, can also master Doton, Katon and Suiton, but I don't think she ever combines more than two at each time).    My questions are:   Are combinations of chakra natures taught or only transmitted by Kekkei Genkai (or both)?   Are combinations of more than three chakra natures possible?   And the above question created a new one for me: Can a ninja master more than three chakra natures? (I think Kakashi does, but I am not quite sure about this)  "
72,Are all the Taoists survivors?,"Before the events of Black Cat, Chronos apparently wiped out all the Taoists. When Shiki turns up he claims that he is a Taoist and that not even Chronos could wipe out an entire tribe.  After Creed defected his Apostles of the Stars are comprised of Taoists however Charden Flamberg and Kyoko Kirisaki had been traveling around giving away a potion which grants Tao Power to those who drink it.  I am wondering, are all the Taoists in the Apostles of the Stars are survivors from the war against Chronos or did some of them drink the potion? if so which ones? "
73,Where do Kekkei Genkai abilities (genetic abilities) originate from?,"In Naruto there is a group of abilities called Kekkei Genkai (血継限界). They are told to be ""genetic"" abilities which are (usually) passed down genetically within specific clans.   Notably, the eye techniques (Dōjutsu, 瞳術), such as sharingan, are also a subset of those.  How did those abilities first appear? Did they appear naturally, or were they made on purpose as a result of experiments?  "
74,How strong is Mezo Shoji?,"According to the official character book, Shoji has a power of ""5/5"". I don't know what exactly the power means for all character? But for a character who doesn't have any emitter ability, I guess it has to be related to strength, yet Shoji as far as I remember is never shown to be as strong as many other characters. Other character like Rikido Sato, who can increase his strength to five times and can destroy walls with it, it's rated  ""4/5"". My question is, does Shoji have some level of superhuman strength or what power he has that justify his ""5/5"" rating of power in the official character book? "
75,Why did two hours pass before Kirika was asked to put away the pocketwatch?,"In episode 1 of Noir, Kirika and Mireille speak at Kirika's home after surviving the attack at the construction site. After some initial discussion of Kirika's circumstances, Mireille prompts her to take out her pocket watch. Kirika complies and opens the face of the watch. This appears to start the melody that troubles Mireille, and the face of the watch reads 19h.1    After a shot of Mireille's troubled face, we see that the watch face has shifted to 21h05.    There is then a short flashback involving Mireille as a child, after which Mireille tells Kirika to put away the pocket watch.  Why did so much time pass before the pocket watch was removed, if Mireille has such a knee-jerk reaction to it? Is there anything that happens before the removal of the watch that the viewers are not being shown?     I considered the possibility that I had confused the minute and hour hands on the watch. However, that does not work with the layout of the clock face: if it were 00h35 and not 19h, the hour hand should be closer to the first tick on the pocket watch.  "
76,Which was the wall Titan Eren sealed with a rock?,"I'm watching the second season of Attack on Titan. I've watched the first season but it was a while ago.

77,Are all apparitions on Monogatari based on actual stories?,"In the Monogatari Series, there are a lot apparitions. The ones that can easily recognized as corresponding to actual stories in real life are the phoenix (Araragi Tsuhiki) and vampire (Araragi Koyomi, Oshino Shinobu). What about the others? Here's a list of apparition that appear so far in anime   Crab God (Senjougahara Hitagi) Lost Cow/Snail (Hachikuji Mayoi) Monkey Paw/Rainy Devil (Kanbaru Suruga) Snake God (Sengoku Nadeko) Flame-Wreath Bee (Araragi Karen) Black-Hanekawa (Hanekawa Tsubasa)   In the case of Hanekawa, they said that it's a new kind of apparition. Are all of them based on apparitions in ""real-life"" stories? "
78,What number comes after the Godaime Hokage?,"I'll make a spoiler block of it all, since this can be a spoiler to anyone who hasn't seen/read the Pain and the Five Kage Summit arcs.      After Pain's attack on Konoha, Tsunade exhausted her power and Danzo was nominated as Rokudaime Hokage. This lasted for a very short period (Danzo died fighting Sasuke) and Tsunade soon recovered and was, once again, appointed as the Hokage. So next will/should come the Rokudaime again and Danzo should be ignored, or should we move on to the Shichidaime/Nanadaime (not sure about this) Hokage?  I ask this because some people and sites consider Danzo only a temporary Hokage (in this logic we're still missing the 6th, so the next should be it). However, something similar has happened with the succession from 3rd (Hiruzen) to 4th (Minato) and back to 3rd (and later came Tsunade, the 5th). From this point of view, the next to succeed should be the seventh.     Does anyone have any thoughts on this? "
79,How did Hiei recognize his sister?,"In Yu Yu Hakusho (Ghost Fighter), Hiei knew who his sister was immediately without having any second thought. Though he had the Jagan eye, he couldn't see through the barrier that was placed around the place she was confined in the human world. Probably sibling instinct?  When he was still a newborn, he could already understand the people around him but it was never shown in the series that he also saw Yukina as a baby. When he had the Jagan eye, he found the place but not Yukina or Hina. Rui told him few about them but never her appearance specifically. When he opened his hand to get a single drop of snow it showed him memories that Yukina had. What if when he came to his birthplace he touched them and it showed memories of her too.  How did Hiei recognize his sister? "

82,What is a contract?,"In Witch Craft Works I have heard the term ""contract"" thrown around quite a bit. A contract seems to be able to be made with a town or even with a person. So what exactly is it?  Are there any benefits to a contract? Is there a limit to how many contracts you make? Can a contract be made with anything else besides a town or a person?  The term contract seems to be something that can protect non-magical people or grant invisibility to someone as long as they are near. I am not sure on this in Witch Craft Works. So what is a contract? I am not sure if this even is correct since the wikia is still under construction and doesn't give any information. "
83,How was wall Rose breached in season 2 of Attack of Titan,"In Season one of Attack of Titan, everytime titans were about to breach a wall, if I understand correctly, they breached a city located in the edge of the wall first, and through that city, they breached the wall. In episode one of the second season of Attack on Titan, it is said wall Rose was breached but I couldnt hear anything about how they entered. is it known? Did they attack a borderline city first? "

85,"In in-universe time, how long did the ""first"" part of the movie last?","Vague title, I realize, but I don't want to spoil any passersby. Here's my question, spoilered to keep people browsing /questions from seeing it:      How long was it from the first time that Taki and Mitsuha swapped until the last time (the day before the comet struck)? Relatedly, how long was it from when they realized they were swapping until the last time they swapped?   The sense I got is that it had to be a fairly long time (some number of months, perhaps), based on details like how they had pinned down that the swaps occur 2-3 times a week, and how each of them had gotten quite good at fitting into the other's life.   However, during the first scene that is set in Mitsuha's present with her in her own body, the TV news indicates that the comet is due to approach perigee within a month, and at this point, they hadn't yet figured out that they were swapping, which suggests to me that at best they could've had a few weeks where they were aware of the swapping phenomenon. (Granted, the swapping could've been going on for considerably longer with both of them still believing the swaps to just be vivid dreams.)  So the timelines seem a bit wonky to me. Can we pin down the duration of the ""first"" part of the movie more accurately?  I suspect that we should be able to get relatively tight bounds at least on how long they were aware of the swapping by examining the details of the diary entries Mitsuha was keeping on Taki's phone. (Or maybe this info could be found in the novelization?) "
86,Why isn't Digimon consistent with its rule mechanics per story/season title?,"After reading this review about Digimon:     While the general basis of relationships between the show's kids and their digital companions remained constant over the course of the series, almost everything else went through many makeovers.      Some seasons feature seven human visitors to DigiWorld; others,   as few as three. In early episodes, the kids can't get back home; later stories show a new cast of youngsters effortlessly   journeying between the two worlds. And while in most stories each   kid has his own specialized Digimon sidekick, a full season of   episodes featured humans who could transform into the digital   beings rather than just summon them for battles.      Youngsters will certainly find this lack of continuity confusing, and   parents may be wary of introducing their kids to yet another marketing   conglomerate looking to rival Pokemon. (Digimon boasts a similar   assortment of tie-in video games, trading cards, virtual pets, and   other toys.) And it's worth noting that although the show's violence   is mostly of the flashy, fantasy variety and battles are reserved for   the digital beings, those who are seriously injured dissolve into   pieces that are said to regroup and reincarnate at a later date.   Anime titles that has certain rules like Pokemon's battling system, Bakugan, B-daman and Yu-Gi-Oh's Trading card Game. With every season or Arc those anime change the concept and lot but not the ""in-universe rules"". See Zoids for example,  we see different Zoid Titles but still stays consistent with the rule that there's an MC that has a Zoid as the Mech Pilot fighting other zoid pilots. Yugioh battle with cards. and Pokemon with its concept of Gotta catch them all, battle with other trainers and wild pokemon and compete in a league.  However in Digimon, as a season / title ends, they make these Make Overs in the story's scenarios and mechanics of the rules of battle.   for example, in the first season of Digimon (Digimon Adventure 00) We see 7 Chosen Ones who where transported to the Digital World. In there they meet their seven companion Digimons (one partner for each).   The Second season, continues the first with the 2 veterans and 3 new Digi-destined. Nothings wrong there then they throw in Frontier in which the Humans transform in Digimons (as armor) and they were the ones fighting instead of digimons (Power Rangers style).  Also in Digimon adventure and Digimon Xros Wars the ""Chosen Ones"" were having difficulties returning to the Real World, but the other titles can cross easily between worlds right?  Is this because they were being called Pokemon's ""Rip-off"" ? or is it marketing strategy because like pokemon they also sell merchandise and Trading Cards. Are there any detailed explanation for this? "
87,How are backgrounds animated?,I'm curious about how they are animated:   Flower petals in the air Water effects (e.g the intro of The Garden of Words)   Water droplets in pond (00:17 and 1:35) Reflection of a person walking (01:54) Sun reflecting off water  Time-lapse (e.g Your Name)   Are backgrounds done frame by frame? Or do they use something like AE? 
88,What was Incursio's trump card ability?,"According to the definition of a trump card, it is the ultimate Teigu's ability, one that often comes with a risk to the user's life.  It is true for several Teigu, like Murasame (infecting oneself with the fatal poison and the regret of everyone slain by it), Susano-o (giving up one's life force to the Teigu, said to be usable only three times before certain death).  Wikia has on the Trump Card:     Several Teigu were shown to have a hidden ability (奥の手, oku no te, lit. secret move), often referred to as ""Trump Card"" or ""Ace in the Hole"". (...) Usually, such moves are the most powerful, last resort ones. (emphasis mine).   Wikia lists the invisibility power as Incursio trump card. It goes against the very definition, since it has no risk (exaustive, yes, but not life-threatening) and is used in almost the time.  So I have to disagree with that definition. I think that Incursio Trump card is the evolutionary power. It is shown in the Manga that Tatsumi is being consumed by Incursio due to the repeated evolutions:     However because Tatsumi forced Incursio to evolve rapidly to increase his strength, Incursio started to manifest in one of Tatsumi's eyes. After being examined by a doctor, he reveals that the armor has started to bond with him. He also states that after a few years Tatsumi could use it without overdoing it like Bulat. Now at the risk of being devoured by Incursio (...) (emphasis mine).   So, what is the trump card of Incursio? Is there any official or canon material on the issue? "
89,How do hand-seals work when performed with another participant?,"This is related to: What is the difference when a jutsu is performed by weaving only some of it's seals and when performed by weaving all of them?  According to the answer, head-weaving is a technique used to manipulate chakra to perform the Jutsu. Some users require more hand seals to perform the Jutsu whereas other do not require as many due to their chakra control.   In Naruto Shippuden, Episode 374      We see Kakashi and Obito having their battle in the realm where their Mangekyou Sharingan takes them. At roughly 8:30, Kakashi and Obito are in close quarters and Obito takes Kakashi's hand to perform the hand-seals for FireBall Justu.   How does the charka manipulation through hand-seals work when performing them with another participant? "
90,Is Kakashi in love with Kahyo from Kakashi Hiden?,"Kakashi Hiden falls under the category of c-canon because while it was written by a different writer, Kishimoto supervised and approved of the novel. Kakashi Hiden occurred before Kakashi took office as the sixth Hokage. Kahyo is supposed to be executed but Kakashi reduced her punishment to life-imprisonment and made her the new warden of the Blood Prison.   Ib the epilogue of the novel Kakashi received a letter from Kahyo and Naruto is spreading rumors about Kakashi and Kahyo's relationship, which Kakashi denies. The last statement of the novel says, ""Springtime is around the corner"", which is, in Japan, a metaphor usually used to refer to a blossoming romance, but others interpret the last statement as a reference to ""change"" or think it refers to the actual spring season.   In chapter 700 of the manga after Kakashi has stepped down and Naruto has become the seventh Hokage, everybody is shown alongside their partners (except for Rock Lee who is shown training with a kid, and Ten Ten who is at a shop). But Guy and Kakashi are not shown with their ""partners"". It isn't even clear if they do have partners. Kakashi also says that he is going on a tour or something.  So is Kakashi in love with Kahyo from Kakashi Hiden? Did he end up with her and settle down with her? If he did, how does it work when Kahyo is serving her life-imprisonment as a warden at the Blood Prison? and why aren't they shown together like the other couples in Chapter 700? "

92,Does there exist official material on the story of Laputa before its fall?,"Is there material (films, written stories, manga, etc) on the story of Laputa from Hayao Miyazaki's Castle in the Sky before its fall, that is endorsed by Miyazaki himself or by Studio Ghibli?  Or is the content about Laputa in Castle in the Sky all the content about Laputa that is ever going to be released? "
93,What's going on at the beginning of the story?,"I didn't quite get from the first episode what happened to Ohana's family and why her parents had to ""run away"" somewhere, sending Ohana to live in her grandmother's hotel. Why did this happen? Where are her parents now? "
94,"What meaning does the phrase ""Zawsze in Love"" have?","I've watched 16 episodes and the phrase ""Zawsze in Love"" (first said by Kirisaki) appears to be memorable both for her and Ichijou. But what does it mean? Is it a reference to something? Or is it another thing from their childhood? "
95,Is Silvana's comment about the moon in her exchange with Mireille a real life quote?,"In episode 9 of Noir, Silvana meets Mireille and has a conversation with her, which the Funimation subtitles give as:     S: I thought you would come here. Daughter of Corsica, Mireille. Mireille Bouquet &hellip;      M: So you did see me.      S: ""The light of the moon is merciless, and exposes those who would hide.""      M: But how could you have remembered me? Once &hellip; Yes, we only met once before.      S: You were trembling then too. And now, you are before me as a blade known by the name of Noir.   Silvana then gives Mireille ""the kiss of death"" and tells her where to find her the next day.  The line about ""the light of the moon"" sounds like a quotation that Silvana pulled out of somewhere, since the Funimation subtitles put quotation marks around it and since it has a ""theatrical"" quality to it. With this in mind, is Silvana quoting something that exists in real life? I tried searching for ""the light of the moon is merciless"" and only got results for Noir, but it's possible that I might have missed something. "
96,Can I use a UK Crunchyroll account on a US PS4 and viceversa?,"I am planing to start an account on Crunchyroll, but I have some questions and was hoping if someone could help regarding US and UK accounts.  Does it matter if should use an US account or an UK account? Is there any difference between them, in terms of availability and selection?  If I start a US account, would I still be able to use outside US (i.e. overseas)? I live in Europe, but currently I use an US PSN account on my PS4. "
97,Why was the masked man the same height as Minato?,"Tobi/Madara aka the masked man was revealed to be       Obito Uchiha.   This was revealed in the Fourth Great Ninja War but I cannot how the masked man could control the nine tails? At that time, Kakashi, Guy and his other peers were 15 years old more or less, he should also be around that age. Why do we see that the masked man is around Minato's height? Note: Minato was at this time a full grown adult in his 20s.  Even for a very skilled shinobi, I believe it's impossible to learn so much in just 2 years. Obito was about 13 and a mediocre ninja when he was presumed dead in Konoha and encountered Madara. Now, I know many of you might say that he was taught by Madara but at that time Madara was himself and his 80s, very weak, and his life was attached to the Gedo statue. Now in the battle between the masked man and Minato we clearly see that when Minato hits the rasengan to the masked man a whitish DNA sort of thing drips from his arm. That could have been Obito's senju DNA as his original right body was crushed but now I couldn't agree to this because of the first paragraph. Perhaps I am missing something else. "
98,Who exactly is running the One Piece government?,I'm a bit confused here - who is running the world government? Only those five un-named people who only get screen time when a catastrophe happens? Do we know their names or backgrounds?   
99,Akagami no Shirayukihime letters or font?,"What type of letters or font is used in Clarines? I've been searching for it and I can't seem to find an answer.   Here is a screenshot of Shirayuki's Clarines Castle ""pass tag/ID"" from episode 6. I can somewhat read the ""Clarines K • D Wistal Court"" part.     And can you please link where can I download it?  Sorry for my bad English. It's not my first language. Thank you. "
100,Was running into people with toast in your mouth already a cliche by Evangelion's time (1995-96)?,"As everyone who's seen Evangelion knows, the alternate-reality segment in the last episode (of the 1995 TV series) prominently features a scene where Rei, mouth entoasted, runs into Shinji on her way to school.   To those of us living in the year 2016, this is an obvious cliche; countless many anime have portrayed the same thing in the two decades since (episode 1 of Nichibros has my favorite rendition). But would viewers in 1995 have seen this as a cliche?   It seems plausible that Evangelion could have been using the toast-collision trope as a touchstone to really drive home the prototypical-slice-of-life nature of the alternate reality. But then again, it also seems plausible that the toast-collision was only an incidental feature of the segment, and that the trope's present-day status as a cliche is a consequence of other shows imitating Evangelion. I don't really have enough of a pre-Evangelion knowledge base to discern which is true. "
101,Naruto shippuden episodes,Are there any dubbed episodes of Naruto Shippuden after episode 388? And if so are they continuing dubbing episodes?  I have looked everywhere and couldn't find anything. 
102,"What does the ""Dark age"" mean in Shin Sekai Yori?","I was wondering, in the anime on the 4th episode ""Bloody History"", they refer to some period of time called the ""Dark Age"". I was wondering (maybe the people that can read the original Japanese Novel can respond this better) what exactly was meant by the ""Dark Age""?   I tried to figure what the Dark age was and while searching for that answer, I approximately transcribed (from the subbed english version) when the False Minoshiro talks about that. In that scene he approximately says:     The turning point for Japan was when ""Boy A"" committed a series of crimes.   He realized he could use his PK powers and open the most difficult of   locks.  “A” broke into the bedrooms of 19 sleeping women, assaulted   them and eventually killed them. At this point Saki and her friends   couldn’t comprehend how a human was capable of killing other humans.   Even after his arrest people continued to use PK to commit crimes. It   became a weapon for terrorists. It split society into a complex mix of   opposing political, humanitarian, and ideological factions… ...and the   world entered an era of war, unlike any known before. Ironically, the   constant threat to the lives of PK users led to a dramatic evolution   of their abilities. Meanwhile, the human population plummeted   worldwide, until it was less than 2% of what it it’d been at its   height. These events serve as an overview of the Dark Ages that lasted   five centuries.   From that, I concluded that around 2011 A.D. society was something very similar to what we have now (with cars, iPhones, airplanes and normal technology). Then people with PK caused a war and for that reason, human population suffered a terrible decrease to 2%. Then this era lead to a war and then to an era where northeastern Asia divided itself into four distinct and irreconcilable units:   1st, Slave Dynasties, Where PK users controlled those without PK capabilities. 2nd, non-PK users who escaped the Dynasties and lived as hunter-gatherers. 3rd, Bandits who used PK to attack other settlements.  4th, a group of those who managed to preserve some remnants of the technological age.   Then we have the present time where Saki and the others live.  My question is, which time period does the ""Dark Age"" correspond to?  Is the following time scale correct?    Or is the Dark age before the dynasties/division of asia age? Also, what is known about the dark age? "
103,Does Mizuho reveal his crossdressing after he graduates?,"It's been a long time since I watched Otoboku, but I've always wondered if the visual novel explained what happens to Mizuho after he graduates and puts aside his fa&ccedil;ade.   Mizuho is a guy disguised as a girl, attending an all-girls school. He doesn't exactly keep a low profile, either; if he'd done that, he could have just made his girl form disappear after graduation and went back to being a man. Instead, he runs for Elder and becomes a celebrity who is looked up to by the younger girls. When he graduates, he can't just throw off his wig and dress, go ""Phew, what a relief"", and be a man again, because tons of his former classmates recognize him. He would have to either tell them all ""Yeah, I was cross-dressing all those years and hanging out in the dressing room and bathrooms with you"" and get arrested for a pervert, or else pretend to be his own brother (or something) and get out the disguise again whenever his old school friends come around.    Yes, seriously, that's a guy.  If I remember correctly, Mariya, Takako, and Shion all know by the end of the anime series that Mizuho is a guy. Yukari and Kana never find out. So at some point, he's going to have to break it to Yukari and Kana, even if he decides to never see anyone else from the school again. (According to the Wikipedia article, though, he, Shion, and Takako often visit their old school after graduation.)   The Wikipedia article says the VN does show what Mizuho does after he graduates. Does it address this? Does he maintain his female disguise or eventually break it to everyone that he was a guy the whole time? "
104,Can a transmutation circle be reused?,"Could the Transmutation Circle in Xerxes be reused even if it wasn't partially destroyed? I understand that Transmutation Arrays, the circle on Mustang's gloves, etc. are capable of being reused. But does the same physics stand for a large scale transmutation circle used for sinister acts? And also, what about the Nationwide Transmutation Circle in Amestris? "
105,Does Broly have 2 transformations?,"Without counting Broly's supressed transformation (because it's an artificial transformation due to its necklace) does Broly have 2 transformations? I know this question is tricky because it could have different answers according to which version of Broly you are talking about (in Dragon Ball Heroes and other promotional animes there is a Broly SSJ3, Broly god, Broly SSJ4, etc), but how it is considering Broly from the movies in general. In the old non canon movies we've seen a greenish transformation in the first movie, and in the second movie we've seen a yellow transformation. Now for the new movie we've seen a greenish transformation and a yellow transformation from a promotional art. Does Broly have 2 transformations, a base form, a regular super saiyan transformation  (yellow) and a greenish legendary super saiyan transformation?  Old movie 1    Old movie 2    New movie     "
106,"How strong did Neia Baraja become, and what caused it?","So in Volume 13 of the light novel in Overlord, (spoilers)      it's clear that Neia gets stronger, however I'm not sure just how strong she becomes. For example, during the archery training, she manages to get perfect shots but indicates that she was not able to do so previously. Moreover, the first time she used the Heavy Recover spell, she was able to only use it once before running out of mana, but later she displays the ability to use it multiple times. If one were to compare her to the ranking system used by adventurers (copper, iron, bronze, etc., adamantite), where would she rank?   Also      I'm a bit confused on how the leveling system works in the New World. Ainz mentions that he is unable to increase his levels and XP by killing off over 100,000 soldiers in the battle with the Re-Estize Kingdom, so how can Neia get stronger?  "
107,Why didn't Goku think of using Instant Transmission to get out of Hell before trying what Android 17 did?,"Android 17 got out by opening the gap between Hell and earth. But instead of doing the same, Goku could have used Instant Transmission to get out. Why didn't he do so? Is it because of the fact that he was turned into a child and he could use Instant Transmission only as a Super Saiyan 4 (taking into consideration that Goku could only be a Super Saiyan 4 for a certain amount of time)? "
108,"What novel does Teshigawara allude to in chapter 2.2 of ""Earthbound""?","In the spin-off novel Kimi no Na wa. Another Side:Earthbound, chapter 2 takes a look at the events of Kimi no Na wa. from Teshigawara's perspective. The second section of that chapter has him thinking about how he's so fed up with the corruption in Itomori that he just wants to blow the whole place up. Then, this thought occurs to him (on p. 88):     そういえば、大好きすぎて辛いから、もういっそなくなってしまえ、と思いつめて、どこかの寺に火をつける小説があったはずだ。      Come to think of it, wasn't there a novel where someone is so deeply in love that it hurts, and gets it in his/her head that he/she should just make it all go away, so he/she sets fire to some temple? [translation mine]   What novel is he referring to here? The description makes it sound like some classic of Japanese literature, which is a thing I don't know much about.  (It is presumably a novel that actually exists, given that all the other allusions so far (Michael Jackson, ""Muu"" magazine, a few others) have all been to real-world things that exist.) "
109,How is that mechanical soldiers and cursed children can be held by a couple of regular humans?,Mechanical soldiers and cursed children are shown to have superhuman strenght. A cursed children of one kick can blow a Gastrea and a mechanical soldier (Rentaro) of one kick can destroy several floors. How is that we see then a homeless cursed children being trapped by 2 or 3 police officers or Rentaro being held by a couple of humans? Can their strenght can be deactivated somehow or something? 
110,The Extent of Senzu Bean Healing,"They're supposedly some form of magical super food, right? Not like some all-cure medicine, as they can't cure ailments nor healed over wounds. It's like they super charge the body's natural healing or something. But, given that they also state to be able to sustain someone for a weak, if we assume the magic isn't just to sustain a body, but to magically produce all the needed nutrients for it to sustain itself for so long somehow, then could a Senzu Bean cure malnutrition and restore the body to what it would be like normally? "
111,What software is used for making anime?,"Is there any particular software or software family specifically designed for making anime?  Are they drawing all the frames of motion scenes, or does a software automatically generate them? For example, consider a soccer player kicking a football. Let the duration of the scene be 0.5 seconds, and let the frame rate of the video be 24 fps; that makes 12 frames in that scene. Do they patiently draw all those 12 frames manually for that scene which takes only half a second? "
112,Does Nosferatu Zodd help Gatsu in the manga?,"I've just watched the Berserk 1997 series and now I'm watching the 3 part (movie?) from 2012. In the 1997 anime series,      When Gatsu sword is broken fighting with Boscogne, Nosferatu Zodd gives Gatsu a weapon to continue fighting.   In the 2012 anime,      Nosferatu Zodd doesnt appear and Gatsu wins the fight on its own   I was wondering how it is the story regarding this in the manga? It's like in the 1997 anime or it's like in the 2012? "
113,Fate/Zero and Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works - prequel vs sequel vs something else?,"This may not be the appropriate place to ask this, but since you guys are the most intimately familiar with the anime, I thought I'd ask here.  I'm designing an anime database for a personal project (not unlike MAL or AniDB), but unlike those two, I have a much stricter definition of the two terms. I define them as:   sequel: a work produced after the original story and continues or expands upon the original story. prequel: a work produced after the original story and is set chronologically before the original story.   This means that all prequels are implicitly sequels, which is what a prequel means.  Now, the situation with F/Z and F/SN:UBW is tricky. Everyone and their mother tends to see F/Z as a prequel to UBW, because the F/Z visual novel actually is a prequel to the F/SN VN.  However, when it comes to the anime, F/Z was produced first, and then UBW after. In this case, would the UBW anime be considered a sequel to the F/Z anime? Some have argued that UBW was not intended to be a sequel to F/Z at all, but then what would their relationship be? Spin-off?  "
114,Why MAL (MyAnimeList) is putting light novel and comic together?,"I live in Hong Kong, and at least from my observation, light novels and comics are quite different things in Asia. However it seems that on sites like MAL, which is not of the Asian origin, they categorize light novels and comics as one.  Are light novel and comic seen as similar things in English speaking area? Or is there any special reason for services such as MAL to decide light novel and comic should fall under the same type?  I also noticed that this site is named ""Anime &amp; Manga"", but also contains a light-novel-production tag. Hence the same categorization seems to happen here as well. "
115,Are manga artists underpaid?,"I saw a post of this Japanese schoolteacher who had drawn a scene from Kimi no Na wa on the blackboard. It was pretty awesome. He had some other mind blowing drawings too. But in the comments one person had written: "" Why does this guy not write/illustrate a manga?"" To this someone had replied saying that: ""Manga artists are underpaid in Japan and do not prefer to write mangas as a primary source of income.""   Is it true that manga artists are not paid big sums of money in Japan? I thought they get lots of money from the magazines their manga is published in. And also from various other sources such as when we buy merchandise related to that manga or the anime version... "
116,How can Madara still stick around even after the Edo Tensei had been ended?,"Edo Tensei is a technique to revive the dead, and bind their souls into living bodies. However, after releasing the technique, all of the dead should get back into being dead.  How can Madara still stick around even after the Edo Tensei had been ended? I am not sure if it was something that we needed to think about and figure out by ourselves or is it yet to be revealed? "
117,Kekkei Tota Bloodline limit passing,"My question is, if kekkei tota is a bloodline limit, then how did the 2nd tsuchikage (Mu) teach it to Ohnoki the 3rd tsuchikage (who are not from the same bloodline)? Or does kekkei tota work differently than kekkei genkai? "
118,Todo and Solomon motives in Witch Hunter Robin,"I just completed the show, and I loved it. There are only two questions in my head. And I think there are no definitive answers to them, they can be mere speculation, but still I would like to read those. I searched a lot but couldn't find answer anywhere so I came here.  First, why was Todo so hell bound interested in creating a witch that can restore witches race? He was human and as much as it is shown, he wasn't madly in love with Maria (she was just a test subject for him, said by Father Juliano).   Second, why was Solomon so afraid of witches? Because witches were more powerful? Fine but if they despised witches so much, then why were they having conflicts with Zaizen? Zaizen wanted to eradicate witches completely, and so did Solomon. Just their means were different. And even the means could be justified because they hated witches, so creating Orbo was legal from their point of view. "
119,"In Master Keaton, is TV news being used as secret code based on real world practice?","  Vol.8 of Master Keaton starts with the TV broadcasting a news segment about 'a Lion was accidentally trapped inside the cage of leopards in some zoo near River Seine.' This was later explained that it symbolizes a royal family member being in danger overseas, and is used by the British government to secretly notify the related parties (agents?)  Was this based on some real world practice? "
120,What happens when a Marine or Pirate goes after a bounty,"In One Piece notorious pirates have a bounty on their heads with Luffy getting his after defeating Arlong.  It seems obvious to me that the Marines would be the ones who do the payouts since they are the one who produce the wanted posters, but what happens when a Marine like Smoker goes after a pirate? Do they get the bounty or some other reward?  And what about other pirates such with the case when Buggy and Alvida were about to kill Luffy in Roguetown, would the Marines pay out the bounty to them if they came to claim it (considering that by killing or bringing in another pirate is doing the Marine's job for them) "
121,How Sarada was able to awaken Sharingan?,"According to definition of Sharingan:     When an Uchiha experiences a powerful emotional condition with regards   to a person precious to them, their brain releases a special form of   chakra that affects the optic nerves, transforming the eyes into   Sharingan   So my question is that how Sarada Uchiha was able to awaken Sharingan? I mean is there any event occured to Sarada due which she was able to awaken Sharingan. Is it mentioned anywhere in anime or manga which tells how Sarada got his Sharingan or about any emotional event she faced? "
122,Anime deviation from manga,"I had watched Tokyo Ghoul and Tokyo Ghoul Root A a few months ago. Now I just finished reading the Tokyo Ghoul manga and noticed that there are various places where the manga was different from the anime and many things were left out in the anime.  I haven't really read many manga but from what I have heard, it's the same case in many manga to anime productions.  My question is, who decides what goes into the anime and what stays out of it, and what changes will be made, with respect to the manga? Is it the studio producing the anime, the author of the manga, or is a mutual agreement between the two made? "
123,Where did the elder sister/s little brother love affair started,"Edit:  I found this to be called: Not blood Related according to an article in TVTropes.  here are some examples:     In the anime Happy Lesson, Chitose's sisters aren't really related to   him and are clearly invoking a Big Sister Instinct and Cool Big Sis.      KissXsis runs on this trope. Keita's twin step-sisters compete with   each other for his affections, much to his dismay. His parents not   only are aware of this, but actively encourage him to go for one of   the girls, constantly reminding him that 'it's not by blood, so it's   OK!'   In KissxSis, Ako and Riko literally loves their little brother Keita (related by marriage of their mother and keita's father)  and they keep competing for his Love on almost every episode.  Freezing also has this, a 2nd year Pandora has to choose a 1st year limiter.. eventhough the limiter calls his pandora a sister (but not blood related) they perform an initiation ""baptism"" or also know as ""first room visit""    Other examples: kanokon  Who started this? and what is its inspiration?

125,"What do people mean when they say ""Notice me, senpai""?","I'm new to anime and my friends really like it. They really like to say to me ""notice me, senpai!"" and I don't get the reference. I could be walking to class and one of my friends would say ""Can you go to the canteen?"" and I would say no I can't and then, they will say ""NOTICE ME, SENPAI!"" Can anyone shed some light on the ""notice me, senpai"" reference, please? "
126,Why is Momoshiki Ōtsutsuki's Rinnegan of a different color?,"In episodes 63-65 of the Boruto anime, Momoshiki Ōtsutsuki's Rinnegan has changed its color, compared with the color of the usual Rinnegans or from the movie Boruto: Naruto Next Generations? Could this mean Rinnegan also has variations? "
127,Why is there no nudity in Darling in the Franxx?,"Darling in the Franxx has a lot of sexual undertones in it and it's not exactly subtle about it. Why doesn't it have any nudity then? I'm not talking about full blown hentai, I'm talking about some bare breasts here and there. It's not exactly for small children anyway, so... what gives? Even Ranma 1/2, if I remember correctly, had bare breasts in its original airing. I know it was a very different time, but still...  Judging from the manga, the creators don't have any qualms about showing female nipples, so why did they hold back on the anime? ... Did they just reserve it for the manga as an additional selling point or what? I heard the manga is successful, but I doubt it's just because of that, but I could be wrong... "
128,Do anime usually lose money?,"It seems as though a lot of anime go through a production cycle where they put out a series that seems fairly popular, but ends long before the manga's storyline does.  Obviously, a big reason for making anime is to get people to buy the original manga, but if the anime series itself were turning a profit it's tough to imagine (from my American viewpoint, anyway) that the producers would abandon it, when it could easily continue (given its proven popularity, voice actors lined up, storyline set, etc.)  Is there an overarching reason?  Do many anime not turn a profit? "
129,"Who is the physically strongest villain, All for One or Muscular?","In the battle with Izuku, Muscular was able to ""cause destruction on a similar scale to Izuku's 100% Detroit Smash. He was also able to directly overpower Izuku, who was using One For All 100% at the time, in a physical clash.""  In the other hand, in the last battle of All for One with All Might, All For One says he is now confident of trading punches with All Might with his new strenght augmentation quirks, and he does indeed.   Who is supposed to be the physically strongest villain, All for One or Muscular? Does the manga give more info about their strenghts? "
130,Why are Asura and Indra of Hindu mythology represented opposite in Naruto?,"In Hindu mythology, Asura are the bad beings. Asuras always try to steal the place of Devas because they didn't get it. Indra is a king of Devas/Suras.  So in short Indra (Deva) is depicted as good being in Hindu mythology and Asura as bad beings and Naruto is inspired from Hinduism/Buddhism, so why is the adaptation of Indra and Asura made opposite to their real self? Have the makers explained it ever? "
131,Are All Might and Midoriya equally strong when they use One for All 100%?,"Even though Midoriya can't use One for All without breaking his body, if both Midoriya and All Might use One for All 100% in their primes, are they supposed to be equally strong? Does their particular body influence how much strong each one are or by having One for All they are about the same? Does the manga give some light about this? "
132,What are the other Animal Guides?,"When Aang was in the Spirit World during the Winter Solstice he refereed to Roku's Dragon as Roku's Animal Guide like how Appa is to him.  I am wondering what are the Animal Guides for the other Avatars? do each Elemental Tribe have a single animal (ie. Air Avatars have Sky Bisons, Fire Avatars have Dragons) do does each Avatar have their own one regardless of elemental origin? "
133,Can Ghouls drink water?,"I just started watching the series and I'm about 4episodes in.   In episode 2 the shopkeeper old guy says:       Since ancient times, coffee is the one thing that ghouls and humans can enjoy.    but in episode 4 when Touka got a piece of meat from a friend, she was in the bathroom drinking water and fighting to keep it in her body.   She didn't instantly vomit from the water but in episode 1 when the protagonist drank milk he did.   So based off of these observations, can ghouls actually drink water &amp; coffee? And if so are there other dietary things that float along this median line of edibility among both races? "
134,"Why is dubbed anime commercially considered a ""premium""?","You can easily, and legally, stream anime for free from services like Crunchyroll, Hulu, directly from the licensing companies (such as from Funimation), and whatnot.  But the catch to that free access to the content is that it is subbed, not dubbed; you have to pay an actual fee if you want to watch the anime dubbed.  Why is dubbed anime considered a ""premium"" that you have to pay for?  I ask this because a fairly substantial amount of the anime fan population actually prefer to watch subbed anime anyways, even to the point of inciting some ridiculous subbed vs dubbed arguments in Youtube comments sections and other internet forums...  Why charge for just dubbed anime when you can also charge for subbed as well? What makes dubbed so special that you have to pay for it, but not for subbed? "
135,How is Jaeger still alive at the end of Valkyria Chronicles?,"In episode 25 of Valkyria Chronicles, Maximilian shoots (and it is strongly implied that he kills) Jaeger:    Yet during the credits of the final episode (26), Jaeger is clearly seen walking in the background at the train station:    What's the deal here? Did Jaeger not get shot? Or did he get shot but survived? And if so, how in the world did he escape from the rest of the crumbling fortress? "
136,How does Vanishing Rasengan work?,"Vanishing Rasengan is a miniature Rasengan which was originally developed by Boruto as seen in Boruto: Naruto the Movie. In that movie, when Boruto was trying to learn Rasengan in front of Sasuke, it was observed that his Rasengan usually vanishes into the air but the effect of Rasengan is still there.  How was Boruto able to make the Rasengan vanish? How does Vanishing Rasengan work? "
137,Couldn't the Chimera Ant King be trapped in Knov's Nen dimension?,"I enjoyed the anime a lot. Most of the time, no main character made bad decisions in fights or at progressing. However, in the Chimera Ants arc, wouldn't it be easier to trap the Chimera Ant King in one of the special rooms in Knov's Nen dimension? Are the rooms to weak to keep him in there?  They could just let him starve there. I know Knov was scared of the Chimera Ant's Nen, but he created those rooms before the battle, so one of the others could move the King there. "
138,MM!'s Age Rating?,"I have a few friends who are pretty curious about this show, as it's one of my favorites. However, my friends might not be able to handle some explicit stuff, and I haven't seen it in a while. Anything that you know of that would bypass the US pg-13 standard? I am aware of the cursing, but any sexual content that I may have missed? "
139,Why do Japanese live-action adaptations appear to have extremely similar artistic direction to their manga/anime source material?,"It is possible that my premise is extremely flawed, but I have noticed in recent times that there are quite a few live-action adaptations of Japanese anime or manga that look very similar in visual style to their source material. For example, I recently saw a trailer for the Japanese film Parasyte, which is based on a manga. Many of the scenes from the trailer look identical to parts of the manga, and the appearance of the parasites is identical to the original artwork. I also saw the movie trailer for Attack on Titan and the titans in the film look identical to those in the manga and anime. There are quite a few other examples that I've encountered that I cannot list right now.   In Hollywood, even when animated material is adapted to live-action, usually the artistic direction is quite distinct between the two. Some of Marvel's latest superhero movies borrow a lot from their comic book material, but even then their visual style is quite distinct from the ""comic book"" look. The film adaptation of Watchmen was extremely similar in both plot and artistic direction to the graphic novel and it was critically panned for this, which leads me to believe that it is somehow deemed unacceptable to do this for Western graphic novels.  Is there a reason why the live-action adaptations of manga are so close in appearance/artistic direction? Or is it just my limited experience? "
140,Does 17 has ki?,"In Dragon Ball Z it is mentioned that Androids dont have ki. If I recall correctly, when 17 is fighting Piccolo one of the Z fighters says Piccolo must be figthing an Android because he can't sense his ki. But later it's been said that 17 and 18 are modified humans, now we know that 17 can raise his power level by doing some kind of exercises, and we see he has an aura when fighting with Goku. Does it mean he has ki? What about also when he gave his energy in Dragon Ball Z for Goku to make a Genki Dama against Buu? "
141,Are there any anime/manga that have caused outrage to the point of them being banned in any culture?,"I want to know if there is any city/country or culture that has banned any manga/anime because it opposes their beliefs? I have read articles that say Pokemon  is against Christianity; however, are there any more? "
142,Who is the person in the Akatsuki cloak in Chapter 702?,"My theory is that the hooded man might be someone new who was also working behind the scenes, but didn't make himself known as Obito and Madara had done or could be someone already introduced as a part of the Uchiha, it could be Madara, or Danzo. So, perhaps even the masked guy isn't Uchiha.  So who do you think it could be?        "
143,What was the meaning behind Tetsuro's pendant?,"In Galaxy Express 999 (the movie) was the purpose of Tetsuro's pendant ever explained? We see at the end that Maetel was holding one that embodied her dad's soul and it is what she uses to destroy planet Maetel, but Teturo's is never really explained. Or did I miss something? "
144,What time travel category applies on Steins;Gate?,"I'm kind of a fan of time travel stories, so I got a little disappointed with Steins;Gate.  According to Wikipedia,     Time travel themes in science fiction and the media can generally be grouped into three categories: immutable timeline; mutable timeline; and alternate histories, as in the interacting-many-worlds interpretation.   When they explained timelines in the show, I got the idea of the timelines being alternate, but then we got all of this ""Alpha/Beta timeline"", and that goes more with the immutable timelines, with some alternate-difficult-to-reach timelines.  And at the end, Okabe couldn't change the beta timeline, except if he cheated himself (which would make the timeline mutable)...  So, did the scriptwriters just cherry-picked things as they felt it could add more drama? (For example, I was telling myself all the time: if Kurisu dies in timeline beta, and Mayuri dies in timeline alpha... wouldn't the solution be going to timeline Gamma?!)   Am I missing something? "
145,Why do some mangaka like Ishida Sui have a mysterious air?,"I had googled Ishida Sui after reading Tokyo Ghoul, but I was surprised to find minimal information about him. I couldn't even a find a single photo of him, not even on his Wikipedia page.  Why is it that Ishida Sui is being so elusive? When I searched for other authors of manga like Reki Kawahara of SAO I found him immediately (along with his picture). Are other authors also elusive like Ishida? But why do they do so? "
146,How was Light able to maintain his academic performance?,"After Light got the Death Note, he started writing criminals' names and killing them. Even after L made his first appearance and said that he would find Kira, then Light was thrilled up and accepted that as a challenge.   As we all know Light was the 1st performer in his academics from the start. But when he got the Death Note, then he was certainly spending a lot of time on planning how to kill, and also observing how the Death Note works. But even after all this pressure of killing and L coming to find him, he maintained his academic performance.  So does that mean Light was so talented that even without studying he was able to come first in his academics, or was he spending enough time in academics as well? Is there anything specified in the anime or manga about how he was managing his time between his studies and by writing names in the Death Note so that he would not get caught? "
147,Why are only some of the references censored in Lucky Star,"As anyone who has seen Lucky Star will remember, most of the references to other anime and manga are censored. The most obvious examples of this are references to Gundam or Sgt. Frog (both of which are notably Sunrise shows). Presumably this is done to avoid KyoAni getting sued. This also explains why references to Haruhi and Full Metal Panic weren't censored (as far as I remember). Interestingly these instances of censorship probably could have been removed in the English release since it was licensed by Bandai, but I don't know if they actually were, so this question might only apply to the Japanese version.  However, there are still a few cases of references which weren't censored despite no obvious connection between the Lucky Star team and the source. The one that immediately comes to mind is To Heart, which is referenced several times. To Heart is associated with VN studio Leaf as well as animation studios Oriental Light and Magic and AIC, neither of which have anything to do with Lucky Star (KyoAni and Kadokawa). I can't find any connections between them, but of course that could be oversight on my part, and I didn't check all of the individual staff members.  Is there some connection that I missed? Barring that, what sort of policy would a studio typically use for references like this? Would they try to obtain permission for all of the references, or just bleep the ones that seem risky to them? "
148,Why do digimon names end in 'mon'?,"As above, is there a special reason why digimon names end in mon?  This thread says its for marketing but the guy also has the theory of:     Digimon are digital lifeforms, and are made up of computer data, right? As we know, every kind of data file has an extension, or file format, for example a Microsoft Word document has &quot;.doc&quot; as its extension, a web page has &quot;.html&quot; and an image has &quot;.jpeg&quot;, &quot;.png&quot;, &quot;.gif&quot; etc, so perhaps the same thing applies for Digimon.      by wildwing64   "
149,Does Rolo's Geass have no Limits?,Rolo has been using his Geass since he was very young and using it beyond limits; for various missions and assasinations again and again. But he never lost control over the Geass like Lelouch and Mao. Also if he had lost control before dying then what would be his situation if he had used it infinitely? Would he stop the time around him forever? 
150,"What does Kikuhiko mean by saying ""what I did to your daughter"" to Sukeroku?","I noticed that at the end of Season 1, Kikuhiko is at the grave of Sukeroku and he says something on the lines of ""are you mad because of what I did to your daughter?""    What does he mean? What did he do to say that?       Did he impregnate Sukeroku's daughter and is he making reference to that?  "
151,"What does ""LRIG"" mean?","We know that Tama is Ruko's ""LRIG"" card, but is it ever explained what an LRIG actually stands for or what it means?    I was looking at some translated card game rules also, and they never referred to these cards as anything other than LRIGs. Have I missed something early on, or have they neglected to explain the term? "
152,"Does the ""bloody nose"" trope necessarily imply a sexual situation?","If you've seen much anime, you're familiar with the male character getting a bloody nose when he gets sexually excited. For example:     Master Roshi (Dragon Ball) and Umino Iruka (Naruto)  However, when I mentioned this to a Japanese person (someone who was not a big anime viewer), she was confused, and adamant that a bloody nose would normally just mean that the person was excited in general, and it would not necessarily have anything to do with sexual excitement.  This could (and seems likely to be) true for Japanese day to day real life, but very different in anime, where the connection to libido seems very clear.    Is there someone that can explain this difference? Is the ""bloody nose"" in anime just used to signify excitement, and it just happens to often (always) be sexual excitement because of the plot? Or is it supposed to be just understood how a bloody nose is interpreted in anime is different from normal life? "
153,Anime where character's hand transforms?,"I discovered this animated image: [website]What anime is this from?  In an attempt to avoid including animated images, here is a still-shot from it.    In the animation, the character runs from 2 guys, but gets cornered.  At this time, the hand appears to act on it's own, transforming into tools to subdue the pursuers.  I've tried Google's search by image tool, but no help.  I'm also not sure what ""Soft Deserted Ayeaye"" would mean, but searching it brings up some creepy animal pictures. "
154,What is the relation between Ergo Proxy and Vincent Law?,"I understand that one of them is actually the other. At first we are led to believe that Vincent is Ergo. But toward the end of the series, we discover something but I am not sure what it means: Ergo created Vincent to run away from himself. Also, in the beginning, when Vincent turns into Ergo, he loses control and doesn't remember any of it. Later on he starts to control Ergo, but at the same time he can talk with him.  So, basically, I don't understand which 'came first': Is Vincent Law Ergo Proxy? Or is it the other way around? Or are they actually two different 'selves' that 'reside in the same body'? "
155,How Itachi was able to use Shadow clone?,"In Episode 452 of Naruto Shippuden,  Itachi used his shadow clone which was in Academy and he was himself training in forest. Since he is already very young then how come he was able to use Shadow clone. According to the teacher of Academy he was so talented that they graduated him but still how we was able to use it.  According to Fugaku Uchiha (His father), he has never used Shadow clone and also as per wiki Jutsu section its only states that he used only Fire release Jutsu.   Since his Father was the only one who teach him various Jutsu then how he learned Shadow Clone? Is it his Father who teach him or Itachi alone was able to learn by himself?  "
156,Why do people in Shin Sekai Yori die if they kill other humans?,"Why do people in Shin Sekai Yori die if they kill other humans?  I remember that during the anime they go through some ritual, but why does that ritual work? What is that ritual exactly? Is it something religious or is it just portrayed religiously but has scientific reasons it works? Do they psychologically affect the subconscious of humans? Is it a religious ""magic"" that does the trick? What gets triggered in the human brain after when people try to kill other humans? By what mechanism do they die? Why is the ritual needed?  Also, what was the name of this thing? Was it death of shame? Why is that the name?  NOTE: I have watched (not recently) the whole show, so no risk of spoilers. Sorry the story is not very fresh on my mind. "
157,Do ghouls also live outside Japan?,"In the universe of Tokyo Ghoul:   Do ghouls exist only in Japan, or do they thrive in large numbers throughout the world?

158,Why do they censor vomiting in anime?,"In vomiting scenes, the liquid is censored by rainbow, mosaics or bright light. Why do they censor puke? Blood shedding, killing, fighting, taking alcohol, bad language, nudity (without showing genitals), vandalism, etc are almost never censored. Why is vomiting treated like this?  Examples  Mosaic censor in Gintama.   Rainbow censor from Nichijou.   White light censor from another show.   Old shows (the ones aired before 2010) usually don't censor vomiting. Golden Boy (1995-1996)  "
159,What is Mii Fujibakama saying?,"I would like to know what Mii Fujibakama is saying in romaji in the anime is ""Date to a Live"". At minute 15:15 of episode 1 of season 2 she says something like "" Majikku "" but it isn't that!! I been searching everywhere on Google for hours how to type/write that in romaji? I know the meaning in English which means gross or disgusting, but I couldn't find how to write it in romaji.  It's the girl wearing glasses that has purple hair. How do you write what she says? "
160,Were the Heroic Spirits that powerful in their lives?,"Were the Heroic Spirits that powerful in their lives? Consider:  Some heroes had ""reasonable"" powers:   Fate Zero's Caster has a spellbook that granted him massive amounts of mana. Fate Zero's Lancer had two magical lances. Stay Night's Caster has a contract-breaking dagger. Fate Zero's Assassin could split into several shadows (I think it's reasonable, as if it was just some sort of complicated spell).   But other heroes had ridiculous powers:   King Arthur's holy sword could shoot an epic anti-fortress beam. UBW's Lancer's Gae Bolg did an anti-army explosion. Gilgamesh's Ea was an anti-world weapon (whatever that means, but it destroyed Rider's reality marble). Heracles could regenerate from death several times.   Was King Arthur's Excalibur really capable of such beam? Was Lancer's Gae Bolg really that destructive? Or were such attributes given when they were summoned by the Grail, based on their legends?  And also, there is the physical strength factor. Most heroes make holes in the walls and ground while fighting, and can jump great heights (in UBW, episode 1, I remember Saber jumped to the roof of Shirou's house, looking for nearby enemies). "
161,What is the name of this song from Sekaiichi Hatsukoi?,"I recently was looking at the Sekaiichi Hatsukoi OST and I came across this one I really liked. Video is here from YouTube.  Just for reference it plays during Season 1, Episode 12 of Sekaiichi Hatsukoi and I was able to find the scene here.  Does anyone know the name of the song playing? "
162,Will Boruto be able to awaken Byakugan?,"As Himawari was able to awaken Byakugan, is it possible that Boruto will also be able to use it?   I am in doubt because, if we take the Uchiha family as an example, then every member of their family has the ability to use Sharingan. I would guess this also applies to the Byakugan users.  Sasuke's child Sarada also awakened her Sharingan even though Sakura was not a Sharingan user.  So in that case, is it possible that Boruto will be able to use the Byakugan in the future? If not, then does it have something to do with genes? "
163,Does Beatrice know about Return By Death?,"During episode 7, Beatrice was contracted to protect Subaru. When she is with him on the cliff she suggests he ""die where she can't see him"" so she won't ""have bad dreams,"" about it. Maybe she was being sarcastic, referring to the fact that he should die, suggesting Rem's death was his fault? I'm not sure if it was sarcastic, but it seemed to me like she was suggesting he kill himself to Return By Death? It sounded like she was conveying that he wasted his chance to explain himself to Ram, this time, but could kill himself and try again? Ah, I don't know... She says ""I'll help you escape this domain""... What was she foreshadowing here? Does she know? "
164,What happens when a seiyuu cannot continue working on a production?,"Voice acting is one of the many things that can make an anime movie, OVA or TV series successful or not, and some seiyuu gain their own followings or are treated like idols.  What happens if, say, a major character's seiyuu has an accident, dies or quits before the production is finished?  Has this ever happened, and if so, what were the consequences, measures taken, and reaction from fans to those measures? "

166,Where can I find the manga for Guilty Crown?,"I watched Guilty Crown over 3 months ago and I still can't get over it, so I decided to read the manga.  Unfortunately, I couldn't find it online. Even when I did, there were only like 1 or 2 chapters.  Is there even a complete manga for Guilty Crown? If there is, where I can find it? I don't mind if it's in Japanese. "
167,What is the laws of cause and effect in Mirai Nikki?,"I was reading over Deus on the Mirai Nikki wiki. I was reading the following sentence here but I do not understand what it is meant by ""cause and effect"". Heres an extract of that sentence:     Deus Ex Machina is the God of Time and Space and a major character of Future Diary manga and anime...... Able to manipulate time, space, and the laws of cause and effect, Deus is the most powerful character in the series and acts as the judge of the survival game.   However I do not understand what the laws of cause and effect are? What does this mean? Does it mean that he can influence others destinys or lives? Change the outcome?  What are the laws of cause and effect? I cannot remember them being mentioned before. So to summarise I am asking....   What is the laws of cause and effect. E.g. they are.... What are they. E.g. One cannot do this.... you can do that....   Does anyone know? "
168,What is this symbol used in Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress?,"While watching Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress, I saw this symbol during the opening song:    But what exactly does this symbol stand for? Is it ever mentioned what this stands for? Have I missed something? I also think I saw it once in the first episode, painted on the train, so I'm guessing it is the symbol for the train itself, but I'm not sure... I just want to know for what is this symbol used.  "
169,What is Abe's first name?,"When they first introduced her, they called her Yukiko Abe, but then the next few chapters that I read were translated by a different translator, and they translated her name to ""Yukiyo Abe"". However, Wikia says that the kanji for her name is 由紀子, which would be read as ""Yukiko"".  So which is it? Yukiyo or Yukiko? "
170,Who is the main character of Fairy Tail?,"Who is the main character of Fairy Tail? Would it be Natsu or Lucy? Natsu is like the hero of the whole anime, but I think the main story revolves around Lucy, how she met Natsu and how she joined Fairy Tail etc. I read the description of Fairy Tail and it says:     Lucy is a 16-year-old girl, who wants to be a full-fledged mage. One day when visiting Harujion Town, she meets Natsu, a young man who gets sick easily by any type of transportation. But Natsu isn't just any ordinary kid, he's a member of one of the world's most infamous mage guilds: Fairy Tail.    Preferably if we could draw an in a canon answer (e.g. interviews with the authors etc.), who would be the main character of Fairy Tail? Natsu or Lucy? "
171,Where does the idea of a Hadouken and Kamehameha come from?,"Having read a few manga/watched some anime, I have seen that many characters can use attacks where they gather their ""ki"" or, according to wikipedia, ""Life force"", and release it in a fireball like manner. The most widely known examples of these are the ""Hadouken"", and the ""Kamehameha"". Where does the idea for this kind of attack come from? Did one person think of it and everyone copy them, or is there like a old teaching or story about this?  Thanks in advance :) "
172,How closely does Princess Tutu follow Swan Lake and The Nutcracker?,"I know that the Princess Tutu anime uses a lot of music and performances from the ballets Swan Lake and The Nutcracker. However, does the anime's main plotline -- of a princess who helps return the prince's heart to him, only to die upon confessing her love -- closely follow either story? If so, what are the major deviations? "
173,How closely does the Saiunkoku Monogatari anime series follow the light novels?,I know that Saiunkoku Monogatari is based on a series of light novels. How closely does the anime (both seasons) follow the original series? What are its main points of deviation? 
174,Why do some fans believe Lelouch vi Britannia had the code when the show staff themselves have always stated otherwise? (Code Geass R2 spoilers),"Some people believe that Lelouch had the code at the end of R2 and was immortal, but the show creators have always officially stated that Lelouch was truly dead. (I will make a summary of some of the official statements below)      Sometimes people try to invoke ""Death of the Author"" but even that doesn't work. ""Death of the Author"" still requires that the interpretation matches with what the work itself presents, that there is an internal consistency, and this is not true for code theory. We see that Lelouch uses his geass long after his final confrontation with Charles, this is not possible if he had had the code because the anime made it very clear that you lose your geass when you get the code. ALL 4 examples of people with the code have had this happen, they all lost the geass, no exceptions. Furthermore Charles establishes that rule explicitly by saying ""I've gained a new power in place of geass.    The idea that the code needs to be activated first is debunked by the anime itself, as it shows us that Charles was immune to geass. There were no red rings around his eyes, and there was no nerves realigning scene. This means Charles was immune to geass, which means his code was already ""active"", which means there is no such thing as an inactive code and thus codes do not need to be activated. It was later explicitly confirmed in a live commentary that Charles was indeed already immune and just toying with his son (see below).   The idea that Lelouch was a special case which allowed him to keep his geass, and thus was an exception to the normal rule is also not supported by the anime. At no point does the anime even suggest that it could be possible for someone under certain circumstances to have both a geass and a code. Nobody talks about it, thinks about it, wonders about it, etc. And there are zero precedents, all the precedents the anime shows us deny the possibility. Without a basis in the anime, this idea is pure fanfic and entirely detached from canon lore.     Since the anime itself debunks the ideas of code theory, it is not possible to invoke ""Death of the Author"" as the fan interpretation doesn't fit in the anime's lore at all.      As for official statements, the provided evidence for Lelouch being truly dead is massively overwhelming. There is a compilation database on reddit which has gathered those official statements. I will highlight a couple of them. For a full overview I urge people to follow the above link.          The interviews from Animage 10 (October, Okouchi) and 11 (November, Fukuyama) from 2008.   In these interviews they explain that the death of Lelouch was a matter of principle for them (their aesthetics, their psychology, etc.), it was a matter of redemption and salvation in the eyes of Lelouch and Lelouch found peace dying for the gentler world his sister wanted.        Okouchi: ""(...) That end is to Lelouch and to Suzaku both the punishment and the salvation at the same time. It's also connected to the words Lelouch said at the beginning: ""Utte ii no wa utareru kakugo no aru yatsu dake da."" The person who gave the punishment was punished themselves and if you want to get the salvation, give the salvation first. Of course it's also the same with Lelouch's decision to accepts the geass (wish), because he geassed many people, as he himself has said in the show. [He refers to the last episode when Lelouch says what the people of the world wish for]""      Animage: ""So this was the end, but was Lelouch happy?""   Okouchi: ""I think that the show had a happy ending, not a bad ending. Lelouch and C.C. talks about it in season 1 episode 7 - just living a life is meaningless. Lelouch saved his beloved sister and managed to create a kind world in his own way. His life wasn't meaningless. That's why in the end he is smiling.""      Animage: ""So you accept the end of the show?""   Fukuyama: ""I think that before he reached that final scene, Lelouch had many possibilities to choose from. But he understood very well what he had done and had to pay the price for that. Suzaku choose to live as Zero and was awarded the opportunity to pay for his sins by this choice. And Lelouch got his salvation by choosing not the happiness of living on but to sacrifice his own life to create the situation for the world to move forward. If you think about his character, I don't think he would still be himself, if he chose other end.""         (Additional pictures of these interviews can be found here and in the compilation post of all official statements)   The interviews from Continue (Vol.42).   In this interview they confirm that the decision to kill Lelouch was a unanimous one, the entire show staff agreed:        Continue: Was there a dispute among the staff members regarding the ending?   Okouchi: No. It was decided fairly naturally. During the ""Code Geass"" script meetings, there are many cases in which there were a number of disputes, but there were barely any when it came to the scripts for (the previous series's) episode 25 and the final episode. I think everyone felt the same when it came to the end of the character that is Lelouch.   They confirm that Lelouch's death was one of the first things they decided for the show and that his death was a matter of principle to them (""their sense of aesthetics""). This statement was confirmed yet again 10 years later in the tweets (see below).        Continue: Why were you so bold as to choose this ending when the viewers might see it as a Bad End?   Okouchi: Bold... yes, we were so bold as to chose this ending. Perhaps the show that is ""Code Geass"" ending up this way was decided the moment Director Taniguchi and I teamed up. I suppose you can call it our sense of aesthetics, or perhaps a part of our psychological makeup.       The following statements explain how they foreshadowed Lelouch's death from the very first episode with his famous line ""The only ones allowed to kill are those who are willing to be killed"" (exact phrazing will depend on the subs you used, of course):        Continue: Still, isn't it possible that defeating the wise ruler Schneizel, the person who was supposed to have brought order to the world, might lead to some [viewers] interpreting it as a Bad End?   Okouchi: That's true. There are probably a lot of people who think of it as a Bad End, a tragedy, considering the protagonist's, Lelouch's end as well. However, Lelouch says in the first episode: ""Only those prepared to be shot are allowed to pull the trigger themselves."" If you were to think of that as his pride, then I think his getting shot (killed) in the end was a logical end. Of course, I understand that not all of the viewers will accept this ending. There were people who wanted a happier ending, after all.       It is important to note that part of this last statement was often misinterpreted by code theorists as him saying that people could see it as open ended. It is clear from his words that this is NOT what he is saying. He said that he understands that some people will see Lelouch's death as a bad ending and that some people wanted a happy ending. Basically, what he is saying is that people are free to interpret Lelouch's death as happy or sad, but Lelouch's death itself was never open for interpretation, it was set in stone as the rest of the article clearly demonstrates. The ending was never meant to be ambiguous. It is also important to note the Lelouch's death can only be interpreted as a true, final death and not something temporary until the code revives him, especially the foreshadowing of his death doesn't make sense if we see it as temporary death or faked death, but the later tweets will make this even clearer, so I will go in further depth there. (see tweets below)      The tweets   As part of the 10 year Code Geass anniversary, the creators of the show started a series of tweets titled ""Geass Memories"" in which they reminiscence about the days when they made the show, shedding light on the production process, the way certain decisions were made, etc. Of particular relevance here are the Geass Memories 77-83:        ""Before I started writing the story of a person called Lelouch, I confirmed with Taniguchi-director something. That thing was that the end of Lelouch will be death.""   ""At least he is aware of his sins and pays for them with his death.""   ""This man called Lelouch will pay for his sins by his death. The story follows him till he finally make this decision.""   ""Probably this Lelouch we see in the first episode of the series wouldn't choose death. He would try something to avoid it. He couldn't die, for Nunnally as well. But we see him changed in the last episode.""       Link to the tweets on his twitter account.        It is important to note that ""death"" here can only be interpreted as a ""true, final death"" and not some temporary death until the code revives him, just as was the case earlier with the explained foreshadowing. This is easily made obvious by replacing the word ""death"" by ""death for 2 minutes"" or ""faked death"". ""Lelouch pays for his sins by being dead for 2 minutes"". ""Only those who are willing to fake their deaths are allowed to kill"". ""Lelouch being dead for 2 minutes was part of our aesthetics"". It is immediately obvious that their words simply make no sense if we assume Lelouch had the code and was immortal. The old argument ""they said he's dead but not that he stayed dead"" with which code theorists try to dismiss the Word of God simply does not hold water at all. (Also, who ever says something as unnatural as ""he died and after that he stayed dead""?)         The Official Guide Book   The official guide book explicitly states several times that Lelouch is dead. To avoid too much repetition I will only copy the explanation of the Zero Requiem:         ""For those two who bear the heavy sin known as killing their fathers, they share the belief that they can forgive each other by imposing the greatest punishments on themselves. Death for Lelouch who wishes for a tomorrow with his sister, life for Suzaku who wishes to atone for his sins through death.""       This explains that Zero Requiem was not only about creating a better world, but also simultaneously redemption for both Lelouch and Suzaku for their sins (as explained above in the tweets). Lelouch eternally boinking C.C. is NOT redemption, as much as some fans might want that. It is undeniably clear here that Lelouch is truly dead.         The New Epilogue (2009)   Unlike the fake fan made epilogue which is going around on the internet (and which I will not give more attention by linking it!) where there's a fan edit which zooms in on the face of the driver and reveals it to be Lelouch, there is actually a real, new epilogue which can be found on the official release of the Zero Requiem blu-ray. While the fake ending was nowhere to be found except on shady youtube channels from people who were pushing their code theory narrative (If it were real how did THEY get it? And why ONLY they?), the real new epilogue can be found all over the web where you watch anime (look for Zero Requiem movie). Unlike the fake one where the image quality massively dropped during the edited zoom, the tv logo suddenly disappears, and there is no music during the edit, the real new epilogue has brand new, high quality art, music and narration by C.C.'s voice actress. In this new epilogue, the often misunderstood hay cart scene is dropped and replaced by a new scene where C.C. talks to the audience and explicitly explains that Lelouch is dead, that she mourns his death, but that she finds comfort in the thought that he died achieving his goals.         ""A young man dies. He had the power to change the world, to create a new order. The world feared him, hated him. But, I know he died with a smile on his face. Only those who have realised their dream will truly understand that feeling of utter contentment. So, this is not a tragedy. And whenever I feel sad or cry at night, I sing a song. A song of man's making. Zero Requiem!""       You can watch the new epilogue here.    Nunnally Did NOT See Memories   As if all the official statements about his death aren't enough, the creators even explictly denied some of the core points of code theory, such as Nunnally seeing memories/code visions.     In Mook Animedia (28 January 2009, p.89-90) there was an interview (see 2 pictures below) which explicitly denied that Nunnally was seeing visions or that those images had anything to do with codes or geasses.     Q: ""How did Nunnally managed to realize Lelouch true intention, when she touched his hand at the end?""      Staff member K: ""The way Nunnally can tell that someone is lying, just like she was able to tell that Lohmeyer was lying to her, is that she can feel the hand of the person she is talking to is sweating or lightly trembling. It's nothing like Geass or some special ability like that.""      Staff member Y: ""Yes. So, she simply came to conclusion [Lelouch was lying] by herself, because of this ability.""      Staff member K: ""She is Marianne's daughter and Lelouch's little sister. Two months have passed since that defeat of Schneizel and for this two months she's been wondering constantly about what had happened, like ""why it happened?"" and so on. So when she touched Lelouch's hand at the end she felt that he is calm, she put the two and two together and realized the truth. Of course, we know that in anime, it's hard to explain things like that, but yeah, please accept it like this kind of romantic idea we had.""       Codes Do NOT Need To Be Activated   The release of the Code Geass movies was accompanied by various Code Geass related events, some of these were, obviously, live interviews and live commentary. The following are excerpts from commentaries given by Okouchi, Taniguchi-producer and two other producers when they talked about the scene where Lelouch attempted to geass his father. This was documented by people who were present at these events. To protect the privacy of these people, I have removed all information which would allow them to be identified.  This tweet reads パパんにギアス掛けるシーンも、「これギアス掛かってないのに死んだふりするんだよ」「息子を驚かせようと」「ルルーシュくんかわいそう」「これ一番ショックなタイミング計ってるよね」「絶対笑いこらえてるよ」って色々言われてて笑った。     Translation: About that scene Lelouch geass his dad I laughed because they said like ""He isn't geassed, just pretends he dies!"" "" He tries to surprise his son!"" ""Poor Lelouch"" ""He tries to choose the most shocking timing, doesn't he"" ""I'm sure he tries hard not to laugh""       This blog post talks about various Code Geass things, the relevant part is highlighted in red and reads コウジロウさん「この人、ギアスかかってない じゃないですか。よく我慢してますよね。こことか 絶対笑い堪えてますよ」     Translation: ""He isn't under an influence form Geass, is he? He's good with pretending, sure. I'm sure he tries his hardest not to laugh right now.""  The creators are saying Charles is immune to geass already, that means Charles already had an ""active"" code, which means that codes are never not active and thus don't need activating.      Conclusion  There's is a mountain of official statements which all repeat the same thing Lelouch is truly dead. When you put all these things next to each other, you see this conclusion is inescapable, consistent and waterproof.      Some people will argue that the fact that a sequel is coming with Lelouch as the officially confirmed protagonist is proof that he's alive/immortal, but it is, in fact, the exact opposite. The official name of this sequel is ""Lelouch of the Resurrection"". when you combine all the official statement about him being truly dead, him returning for the sequel and the sequel's name, it is obvious that Lelouch will start as dead in the sequel and will somehow be resurrected, he'll return from the grave somehow.      Some people will argue that the sequel is an AU (alternate universe) which somehow must mean Lelouch is immortal. It is indeed true that the sequel will follow the movies and not the original series, and these movies have 1 BIG difference with the original series which makes it an AU. However, this change does not directly involve Lelouch, Zero Requiem still happens, Lelouch still dies, so as far as the movies show, all of the statements about R2 also apply to the sequel.  This summary of official statements was based on a compilation post from reddit. The compilation post consists of 2 parts, part 1 gathers all the official statements, part 2 shows how the anime itself contradicts code theory because code theory violates the rules established by the anime's canon. That post is very long (even linger than this answer), but it is thorough and complete, and an absolute MUST READ for all Code Geass fans.  When faced with such a massive amount of official statements which all repeat that Lelouch is truly dead, combined with the fact that the anime itself contradicts core points of code theory, why do so many people still cling to the debunked theory? Wouldn't it be more respectful to Lelouch, to the anime and to the creators to accept the work that was made the way it was made? Especially because the creators made a point of it that Lelouch's death was a matter of principle for them.  "
175,How does Giriko's 'Time Tells No Lies' Fullbring work?,"I have read the wiki on his power but it still does not make sense to me. I would argue that the way Giriko's Fullbring works is very inconsistent, but am hoping for a decent explanation. The first time we see his power, he attaches a timer to a box while training Ichigo. The next time we see it, he shoots projectiles at Ginjo. The third time, he uses a dial on his shoulder to get massive (big and green like hulk it seemed to reference).   Question: How does his power actually work? Is there some link to each of this uses that I missed? Can you give me an answer that is not full of loopholes? "
176,What do smaller eyes persons in anime mean?,"As we know, japaneses have smaller eyes than western people, as the result of an evolutive adaptation against snow blindessness apparently. But in anime, japaneses draw japaneses with big eyes. If an american cartoon would draw a character with smaller eyes, it probably would mean he's japanese, korean, chinese, etc. Though sometimes, japanese draw anime characters with smaller eyes. What does it mean for them?  Does it mean the character is from some area, is old, or what?   "
177,Attack on titan chapter 79: possible flaw?,"In Shingeki No Kyojin's latest chapter (chapter 79), beast titan throws a stone like he is playing baseball. But the story takes place in a time when baseball wasn't even known. These are the pictures:     Is this a flaw or a problem in the Japanese to English conversion? (Maybe the author did not intend baseball).  Or could it mean that Reiner, Bertolt, Annie and the beast titan are from a different time-line? (I don't think it's possible. If that's the case, they could have just used nuclear bombs instead of titans). "
178,Boruto's Right Eye,"So, I have watched the first 3 episodes of Boruto already, and they seem interesting so far. But being a person who watched the Boruto movie first, I have a lot of questions in my mind. One of them is about Boruto's right eye. Whenever he unintentionally activated his right eye, he is able to see chakra, just like the Byakugan, except it can't see complex chakra flows.    So, it looks very much like the Byakugan, except the eye turns black, and there is no veins or whatever at the side of his face.   So is this really the Byakugan, if it is, what type of Byakugan is this? Is it because of Boruto's mother? In general, what kind of Kekkei Genkai is Boruto's right eye? "
179,What are Madara Uchiha's weaknesses?,"At his current state, how could Madara possibly be defeated?  Any physical attack/Taijutsu would be easily deflected by either:     The Susano'o   The Gunbai (war fan, which proved to easily negate a Bijuudama)   Shinra Tensei (which wasn't seen yet, but we have to assume he's capable of it).       And I'm not even starting to talk about the Rikudo mode.   Any non-physical attack would be easily absorbed by the Preta Rinnegan path. There aren't many ultra-powerful genjutsu ninja who can hope to trap him in a genjutsu for more than 2 seconds. And in the offshoot that something does hurt him, he'd just regenerate. He's a zombie.    What weakness does Madara have that could be exploited to harm him? They'd have to damage him badly to hope for a seal. "
180,Is there a reference to Zenki in Japanese mythology? Or did Shaman King intentionally reference Zenki (anime/manga)?,"In the Shaman King series, Hao (and later Anna) used to take control of two beasts named Zenki and Goki (or Kouki), which look like this:    This immediately reminded me of Zenki and Goki from ""Zenki"":    So: Is there a relation between both series? (perhaps authors were friends...) Or is Zenki a japanese mythology character? Or... what's the reason behind the reference? "
181,How is it that a Sharingan can work when it's been transplanted?,"If the various ""superpower"" ninja traits are considered ""blood traits,"" how is it someone like Kakashi, who is in no way related to the Uchiha clan, can use the Sharingan Eye technique?   More fully: would transplanting work on any bloodline trait power? If someone had a bloodline trait that worked on arms, could they just transplant their arm onto another person and then there would be two people with that technique? "
182,Why is Kong using a Japanese surname?,"In the epilogue to Ping Pong, we see this newspaper headline.       Five years after naturalization, finally a ticket to the Olympics for Tsujido Wenge   Now, I don't know Japanese, but I can kind of read this at the very beginning of the Japanese text:     辻堂文革（中国名 孔文革）   This translates to     Tsujido Wenge (Chinese name Kong Wenge)   This suggests that Kong Wenge is known as ""Tsujido Wenge"" in Japan. This is because it doesn't make sense for 中国名 to simply be referring to the Chinese characters (the kanji) for his actual name to me, given the ""中国"" (i.e. ""China"" or ""Chinese"" in the sense of nationality), but again, I don't know Japanese.  Is there any in-universe reason for this discrepancy? Perhaps since he wants to play for Japan, he's better off with a Japanese surname? I think the school Kong played for was Tsujido, and this also seems relevant. "
183,What does Shu's void tell us about his personality?,"In Guilty Crown, Shu finally uses his own void in the end (last episode, if not mistaken). A void is basically a physical manifestation of a person's heart. So what does Shu's void (I'm not mentioning what his void is, for the fear of spoiling it for someone), really tell us about his character and personality ? Also Inori's void being the huge 'Singer's Sword', would reflect  a bold and aggressive personality, whereas she is the exact opposite of that. So how exactly do the voids reflect the person's character and nature(if they do, at all..) ?  Sorry about multiple questions, but I feel they are too closely interrelated to be asked separately. "
184,Is Shanks Haki different from other users?,"What is Shanks' power? If ""Haoshoku Haki"" then is it different from other users?   This question came to my mind after rewatching all episodes of One Piece.   Shank's Haki seemed to be different from that of others. When Shanks was going to meet White Beard before the Ace's death, he cracked the wood even though he wasn't using Haki.   Like Luffy, he too needs to use his Haki to effect someone but Shanks didn't use it and  yet everybody on board the ship was affected. "
185,Can I play a PAL copy of Code geass on my US player?,"So, here just a couple of weeks ago, I placed an order for Code Geass season 1 and season 2 from Madman Entertainment.  This is my first time buying anime. I was told that Madman is a great site to buy anime from because there are a lot of pirated copies floating around on other sites and I wanted to make sure to get an official copy.  My concern is that I just noticed that they are region 2 and 4 (PAL), and I live in the US (Region 1).  This all being said, will my computer and PS4 not be able to play them? If not, is there anywhere else to legally obtain these full seasons in my region? "
186,What is going on with the transformations?? SSGSS is not stronger then SS1?,"What is the significance of a SS.god.SS when brolly as a ss.berserk can make goku and vegeta struggle to keep up?  After all the idea behind the transformations is more power and strength per each new transformation. As I continue to watch the show, I see during the initial transformation they are ""stronger and more powerful"" but then later once the character returns back into the transformation, all that has changed was the hair colour, I am now starting to think that a super sayian 1 is just as strong as a SSGodSS,  and goku only uses SSGSS because he likes his hair to look blue,   To prove my point Ill refer to a couple fights that leave me speechless  1. Goku as a SS3 when up against Berus - Goku could even hit Berus infact a flick on the forehead knocked goku out. - that shows the Power Level difference right there!!    Goku as a SS God (red hair) could not even fight Berus on earth because the shock of energy would destroy earth   this shows how much stronger a SSgod is compared to a regular sayain right?? Like a whole nother level!!!   Goku as a SSGodSS (blue hair) actually scared Berus as goku was able to match Berus""s level   GODLY!!!    With that being said, goku should have no problem as a super sayian blue fighting with brolly, who is one step past SS1 and under a SS2 level, - to me I cannot make sense of this??? Unless dB super is trying to say, brolly is stronger then Berus, ssgss goku and vegeta, and if that is the case, then what's the point of having a SS2, SS3, SSGod, SSGSS, or now Ultra Instinct which I know is not a real SS transformation?   I honestly expect as a SSGSS goku should struggle against real strong enemies, but up against a Lower class sayian transformation goku should be wiping the floor with them.   I like brolly and always have, but there is just no way, he should be able to even see gokus movements when is blue, along with Berus. So I feel like the God transformation is being so undercut it's not funny and is actually making me a bit upset with the series,  To add insult to injury, they gave brolly 3 movies, in which it didn't take the strength of a SSGodSS to defeat him! 3 normal ss took him on, plus some help with the Z fighters team to be live punching bags.   I'm confident that a SSblueSS Kamehameha point blank range at brollys face should leave brolly headless  "
187,Who the hell is Truth?,"In Full Metal Alchemist, who is the character (or the concept really) of Truth? What does he symbolize? What is his purpose?  From what I guess, he's some sort of your inner God, because he seems to know you better than you do yourself. He knows the best way to punish you, the way that would hurt you the most. He must be tied with alchemy and alchemical knowledge, but what is he? "
188,Where was Nunnally between the end of the Black Rebellion and her appointment as Viceroy of Area 11?,"During the Black Rebellion we see V.V enter Ashford Academy to see Nunnally. shortly after, while Lelouch is interrogating Cornelia with his Geass C.C becomes aware of this and warns Lelouch. the 2 then leave Tokyo for Kaminejima Island. During this time we see a shot of V.V and Nunnally at the Sword of Akasha with V.V looking board.  2 Years Later when Lelouch had regained his memories Nunnally appears again, appointed as Viceroy of Area 11.  Where was Nunnally that entire time? was she confined by the Geass Order (as V.V was it's director)? was Nunnally aware or made aware of what happened to her? "
189,What happened to the English dub of Ashita no Joe?,"I was wondering why there's an Ashita no Joe English dubbed commercial but no dubbed anime since there was a commercial saying it was coming to English dubbed. I'd think there was one, but there isn't.  Why is it still not available? Or if there is one, where can I find it? "
190,Dungeon Defense's Korean web novel ending?,"Like in title what happened at the end of the story?  I heard that it's different from the light novel, where in the web novel everyone have died, is it true?  (I can't read Korean) "
191,How was The Dwarf in the Flask created?,"In the Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood, it was revealed that       The Dwarf in the Flask was an experiment of the King of Xerxes and that it has Van Hohenheim's blood.    But it wasn't explained what method was used to create him. So, how was The Dwarf in the Flask created? Was it ever explained in the manga?  "
192,What is the time dilation ratio that Noriko and Kazumi experience?,"At the end of the anime Aim for the Top! Gunbuster, Takaya Noriko and Amano Kazumi must travel at sub-FTL speeds (that is, at speeds slower than faster-than-light) to reach from the epicenter of battle to Earth.   What is the ratio of their time dilation? That is, how long has it been for Noriko and Kazumi versus how long has it been on Earth? "
193,What is the relationship between the Gunbuster and Diebuster series?,"Gunbuster is one of my favorite series, and I remember learning of a sequel series called Diebuster, or Gunbuster 2.   What is the relationship between the two shows? Does Diebuster's story relate to Gunbuster's in some way? Do any characters cross over both shows? Does Diebuster refer to the events of Gunbuster in any way? "
194,"Why was ""Vanilla Ice"" localized as ""Cool Ice""?","In the Stardust Crusaders series, the antagonist Vanilla Ice is localized into English as ""Cool Ice"". There's also the renaming of Steely Dan to ""Dan of Steel"". Is it due to possible copyright/trademark infringements? Or is there another reason, artistic license? "
195,What are these kind of beam weapons used by Ghoul Investigators?,"What are these kind of beam weapons used by Ghoul Investigators like Kishou Arima, or Mougan Tanakamaru? Are they based on Ghouls like Quinques or are they something completely different?     "
196,Non-independent stores in the UK that sell manga,Which stores is the easiest place to purchase manga from?  Are there any supermarkets or main stores that sell them or can they only be bought from independent stores? 
197,What happens to Sai?,"In Hikaru no Go, the main character (Hikaru) has a ghostly companion who tutors and trains him in the game of Go, a sort of Othello/chess hybrid game. However, about halfway through the series....      Sai ends up disappearing and, from then on, Hikaru must train and succeed on his own.   What happens to Sai? Why is he no longer present for the rest of the series? "
198,What happened with Iwao Kuroiwa and Yukinori Shinohara after the battle against Yoshimura?,"After the battle with Yoshimura at the end of the 2nd season of the anime, Iwao Kuroiwa and Yukinori Shinohara were baddly injured. One of the characters said one of the two was in a critical state. What happened with them? Is it mentioned in the manga or something if they survived? "
199,Does Naruto still have Six Paths Sage Mode?,"Yeah, I know there are lots of questions about this topic but not quite enough. Can anyone tell me What happened to Naruto's Six Paths Sage Mode? Does he still have Six Paths Sage Mode? Somewhere, I don't remember where, I read that they sealed it. Is that true? "
200,Why did the Mushishi anime air in a different order compared to the manga?,"According to Wikipedia, the order of the anime does not follow the same chronology as the manga. However, with the series being episodic (and relatively self contained), and each episode barely any passing reference to one another. Why did the production change up the order in the anime? Was there ever an officially stated reason? "
201,Why isn't the Beast Titan at the start of season 3?,"Season 2 ended showing the characters, some titans and then on top of a far away wall the Beast Titan with the titan shifter outside him looking out, but now on season 3 there was only a brief mention of him.  Is the story continuing right after the previous episode or is there any time gap between them?  Will it go back to him any time soon in the next episodes? "
202,What happened to the Itachi Uchiha movie?,"As far as I know, a movie based on Itachi Uchiha was about to come in March. Can anyone please tell whether it's coming this year or is it delayed?  Here is a Reddit thread of the poster, and here is a YouTube video of the trailer:  [website]"
203,Does the author or publisher decide a character design?,"If it comes to light novels there are always some pictures that show a new character or scene. But when it comes to a character, who decides the design? For example, if I were an author and my work gets a publisher, then they would hire an illustrator. So when it comes to the design of a character (let's take character as a simple example) will the publisher decide that her hair is short and red or will the author decide that she has long, black hair? Also feel free to tell me some other example like maybe the illustrator can choose the design. :) "
204,Will Recca become the 9th flame dragon?,"Resshin, the 8th flame dragon was revealed as Recca's &amp; Kurei's father, Oka. Does that mean that all flame masters will eventually become a flame dragon after they die? Or does this only apply when a flame master died with regret like stated here?     When Oka died with regret in his heart, he became the eighth dragon,   and took the name of Resshin. Because his flame had an inner shape, he   was able to retain his natural power and did not become a useless   dragon.   Was there any official explanation about this? I haven't read the manga so I don't know if the answer was explained there. "
205,How accurately did Aoi Bungaku follow the original novels?,"For those who don't know, Aoi Bungaku is an adaptation of 6 classic Japanese novels, namely No Longer Human; Sakura no Mori no Mankai no Shita; Kokoro; Run, Melos!; The Spider's Thread, and Hell Screen.  Of these, I've watched all of them, but I've only read No Longer Human. I'm interested in reading the original novels, but only if there are significant differences in terms of plot. Are there any major omissions or changes in the anime that would merit reading the novels?  The ending of No Longer Human has at least one such difference:      In the ending of the anime Yozo commits suicide. In the end of the book he gets sent to an asylum and then released to an isolated place.   Do the other works have similar differences (preferably with as few spoilers as possible, though some spoilers are inevitable)? "
206,how much gravity were Trunks and Vegeta training when they trained together before the martial arts tournament?,"When Trunks was training with Vegeta before the martial arts tournament where he fought against Goten, how much gravity were they training under? In the spanish dub it says 150,000 times gravity. In the english dub it says 150 times gravity. I have no idea if the spanish dub was a mistake, or the english dub was a mistake. What does the original japanese dialogue says, if it says something at all? "
207,Is doujinshi always sexual?,"Sorry if this has an obvious answer, I'm pretty new to the anime community.   I've seen covers of doujinshi for certain pairings/fandoms I like, but from what I've seen of the contents, most of them get pretty steamy. I really like the concept of fan-published works and seeing certain characters interact, but I don't feel comfortable reading something so...explicit? Are there doujinshi that are based around platonic/fluffy romance interactions, or is this typically the standard for doujinshi? (And is there a way I can tell a platonic doujinshi from others?) "
208,Does a Ghoul need to cannibalize to reach SSS level?,"Apparently all the Ghouls which are classified as SSS have a kakuja obtained by cannibalization. Does a ghoul need to cannibalize to reach SSS level? is this mentioned in the manga, some OVA or something? "
209,How does Renji become stronger than Rukia?,"I only have the anime to go on so maybe there's an explanation in the manga. It seems clear that Ichigo is stronger than Rukia was in episode 1 at the point of his first battle with Renji. In fact it seems like Ichigo may have been stronger as soon as he became a soul reaper, but based on Rukia's reaction to the stronger enemies up to that point (Menos Grande, and Grand Fisher) it seems she believes that a single shinigami could hope to win in cases where Ichigo does. This seems to imply that Ichigo is stronger than Rukia ever was at that point. Then Ichigo fights Renji and is at least closely matched. It's difficult to say that at the point where Ichigo gains the upper hand whether he is stronger or weaker than when he was fighting stronger enemies in the past but it does seem like Ichigo and Renji, at their first meeting, are at roughly the same strength which is greater than Rukia's at the beginning of the series.  But in episode 32 where Renji has his flashback to his time in the Rukon district and training to be a shinigami it seems clear that Rukia was always stronger than he was. So then how do we explain this discrepancy? Did Renji get significantly stronger in the few months Rukia was in the world of the living? Is there any particular reason for that? Or am I underestimating how strong Rukia was at the start? "
210,Are the Elric brothers half-homunculus?,"If Hohenheim is a homunculus (I know that he still has a humanoid body, because otherwise he wouldn't even have had children) and he has a family with Trisha, who is human, does this mean that the Elric brothers are half-human and half-homunculus?  Also, just to make sure, the Elric brothers are half-Amestrian and half-Xerxian (i.e. with a background from Xerxes), right? They don't explain that in either series. "
211,How did Seido Takizawa become a Ghoul?,"At the end of the second season of the anime, Seido Takizawa was almost killed. And in the begining of the third season, he appears as a powerful half Ghoul. What happened to him? How did Seido Takizawa become a Ghoul? "
212,"Who has the most powerful enlarger quirk, Yui Kodai or Mount Lady?","According to the My Hero Academia Wikia Mount Lady can enlarge to 20,62 metres. In the other hand, it's shown in the anime Yui Kodai can also enlarge herself. Is it known how much can she enlarge? Who has the most powerful enlarger quirk, Yui Kodai or Mount Lady? "
213,How does the equivalent exchange of alchemy work?,"Alchemy, in Full Metal Alchemist, is based on the concept of 'one needs to provide materials of equal value compared to the thing one want to create' (equivalent exchange).  But, how does it exactly work. Can this amount of required materials be calculated by the alchemist? If so, how? Are there some sort of lookup-tables?  Or does one need to guess and provides something of more value to be on the safe side? If so, can one become a more skilled alchemist by experience of successful guesses?  Also, different alchemists might have different specialized skills. How does that work? For the guessing part, I can imagine that one have a preference for certain kinds of alchemy and thus gain experience with a specialized skill.  Edit: Madara Uchiha's answer suggests that there are always materials required. I was also wondering about the situation where this is not the case and the alchemist was successful none the less.  For example:      In the end Edward trades his alchemy skill in exchange for returning Alphonse's body to him.  "

215,Why weren't Kingdom Heart volumes released regularly?,"Why did Kingdom Hearts manga series release new volumes so far apart from each other?  The game has been out for a long time, so the plot is pretty much predictable.  Plus, why have they stopped KH2 in the middle, and begin with KH358/2? "
216,"Near the end of the Steins;Gate opening theme, why are only Okabe, Suzuha, and Luka looking to the right?","When I watched Steins;Gate for the first time, this part of the opening drew my attention:    The placement and the facing directions of the characters here seemed too deliberate to be arbitrary, so I felt like there was some sort of symbolism that I was missing. Do Okabe, Suzuha, and Luka have something in common that could explain why they're the only ones facing to the right?  Or am I overthinking this and the directions are just random? "
217,What are the differences between a half Ghoul and a Ghoul other than having one human eye and a Ghoul eye?,"What are the differences between a half Ghoul and a Ghoul other than having one human eye and a Ghoul eye? It would seem half Ghouls have all the habilities of regular Ghouls, super strenght, regeneration, kagune, need for eating humans, etc. Are there other differences? "
218,How does Don Flamingo's fruit production work?,"I'm new here and I'm wondering what kind of Devil fruits Don Flamingo produced.   Are this Fruits as Strong as normal fruits? If maybe the fire fruit already exists, can they produce the same fruit another time, so there would be 2 fire fruits? Can they manipulate which fruits they produce? or is this a random process?  "
219,Why does an alchemist need a transmutation circle?,"As a follow up, but another subject, of my question about equivalent exchange part of the alchemy laws.  Why do (most) alchemists require a transmutation circle? Does any circle suffice or does an alchemist require a specific type for each (type of) job? At least the size seems to matter... "
220,Did something change for the final episode of Hana Yori Dango?,"When watching the Hana Yori Dango (Boys Over Flowers) anime it seemed like there was a distinctly different art style for the final episode (#51).  Not remarkably different, but noticeable enough that it made me wonder if something had changed for the last episode...different direction, artists, etc.  Has anyone noticed this?  Was anything ever said about the production of the series that indicated that something happened near the end that could have caused some kind of shake up? "
221,Where is this picture from? How do I use Reverse Image Search to find the source of an anime/manga image?,"So I see an image that I believe is from either an anime or a manga.

225,What are the PVP rules in the Sword Art Online MMORPGs?,"The show, Sword Art Online has 2 Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games in it, Sword Art Online (SAO) and Alfheim Online (AFO). What are the player-vs-player rules in these 2 games? Sometimes the rules seem to either make no sense (being able to attack someone in a home town but not be attacked back) or seem contradictory (requiring a mutual duel sometimes and sometimes not).   Also, I realize the rules from the 2 in-anime games are probably different. Where SAO seems to have free PvP in non-safezones, AFO requires duels (but only sometimes?).  Do the light novels go into any details about this? "
226,What was the first anime aired in HD?,"I saw this post about What was the first anime to come out on Bluray/HDDVD on this site, and I wonder what was the first anime that aired in HD?  I first thought of it is aired in around 2008. For example:      Bleach started to air in HD in season 9 (episode 168). According to Wikipedia, the original airdate of episode 168 is 2008.   But after hours of researching, I found something about One Piece.      One Piece started airing in HD in episode 207. And again, according to Wikipedia, the original airdate is way back in October 31, 2004.   The recent answer shows these 2 anime (Ghost in the Shell: SAC and Samurai 7) were the possible first anime to air in widescreen.  Fun fact: Samurai 7 is aired just 4 months earlier than One Piece. Does this makes One Piece the 2nd runner-up? LOL. "
227,Why does Naruto have a catch phrase?,"In both the anime and manga Naruto often ends his sentences with either ""dattebayo"" or ""believe it"" in the English translations.   Why is this a thing?  Is it meant to further his character or provide a bit of remembrance of his character to the reader or viewer, or even other characters of the series? "
228,What's this old school anime with a badass green-haired Sephiroth lookalike?,"So I remember this scene from an anime for many years now but I can't find it no matter what I searched for.  Here's what I remember:   Green (maybe blue? not sure) long-haired badass guy, with dark clothing. He really resembles Sephiroth from Final Fantasy. The setup is in a futuristic city/world, the city I remember resembles the city from Akira: flying cars, full of roads, light etc. It must be an old anime, late 80s or early 90s.    The scene I remember clearly is this guy walking an empty road on that city, but the screen is full with roads on all heights, buildings etc. I think this guy is accompanied by someone else on that scene but I'm not sure.  I tried to find it many times for 5 years or so, but I cant remember anything else at all.  What is this anime? "
229,What was the Night Class living on (and for how long) before creating the blood tablets?,"What exactly was the Night Class living on (and for how long) before creating the blood tablets? They obviously lived on campus while working on the tablets, and the Night Class has been at the academy for at least 4 years when the anime started.   So, wouldn't it be kind of dangerous to have them living that close to the humans with NOTHING to help them with their hunger for blood?  "

232,Tamaki's reasoning for making Haruhi a host?,"In the anime series 'Ouran High School Host Club' what's Tamaki's reasoning behind making Haruhi a host?  If she had continued on as an errand boy, the debt would have been paid off eventually... even if it took years.   The hosts don't charge any of their customers, and even if they did... Tamaki tells Haruhi she only needs to get 100 customers for her debt to be erased, and unless they were charging a fortune 100 customers wouldn't even come close to paying off her debt.   So, what's in this deal for Tamaki? At the time of the 100 customer arrangement he's not attracted to her, he still thinks she's a boy. So it can't be that he just wants to keep her around.   Is it a personal challenge for Tamaki to see if he can train the ""commoner"" well enough to get 100 customers?   What's his reasoning? "
233,"Is the Dragon Ball Super manga ""more faithful"" to Akira Toriyama ideas than the anime?","After hearing some dragon ball youtubers I remember one of them told that Akira Toriyama gives a bullet list of ideas he wants the anime and the manga artist Toyotaro to follow and then they have some freedom to develop the story, this is why we see differences in techniques, events, the order the characters are eliminated in the tournament of power, and by whom etc. But then, another youtuber, a spanish speaking one with 1,3 million followers said that aside of giving the primary ideas of the story, Akira gives some sort of supervision in the manga. Is this so? Is the Dragon Ball Super manga ""more faithful"" to Akira Toriyama ideas than the anime? "
234,How far can you manipulate someone with a Death Note?,"We know that if you kill a person via a disease, the Death Note isn't limited to the 23 day rule. Now those who have watched death note know, you can manipulate a person to an extent. So my question is, could I write something like this?     John Doe, Diabetes. Obeys every command from the person he knows as J, till he dies.    Could this work? "
235,What happened between the first 2 episodes of Attack on Titan season 1? How much time passed?,"We are given a flashback/dream sequence at the beginning of episode 2 of Attack on Titan, and there are a few references to the fact that time has passed, but it doesn't look like much time has passed.  What happened between the 1st and 2nd episode? How much time passed? "
236,What happened at the end of the movie?,"I haven't seen the original series of Captain Harlock, however I recently watched the movie during our most recent Weekend Anime Extra.  I feel like I followed along with the plot pretty well, and understood where the story was the whole time... That is until we got to the last few minutes and everything I knew just went out the window. So, it seems everyone just came back to life and the legend of Captain Harlock is going to continue, but why?   Basically, I'm looking for an explanation of what happened at the end. Why did everyone come back to life?  "
237,How do psychoframes work?,"Exactly what are psychoframes? And what advantages does it give the pilot? We see that units that have a built in psychoframe can drastically increase a pilot's abilities, but exactly what does it do? Amplify your Newtype abilities? Mental connection to the control interface to reduce input lag? I feel that this in particular has been left out quite a bit in terms of the development of the series.  "
238,Is there a way to kill Brook?,"Is there any possibility of Brook dying?    I mean, you can't really kill him, because his soul always comes back. Do you have to destroy his bones? But if I remember right, the Samurai on Thriller Bark broke a part of his skull. But now it healed, so is there no way that Brook can die? "
239,Why is the boot camp for the Survey Corps 3 years long? Because Japanese High School?,"At the ends of s01e02, the recruits are given a speech when joining the Survey Corps by Keith Shadis, and he says that they will be training for 3 years before they are expected to fight any Titans.  Why does it take 3 years to train a Survey Corp member?  That seems like a good deal for all the refugees and should have caused their ranks to swell, especially with the now overflowing motivation of urgency.  Three years of food and housing is nothing to sneeze at in those conditions.  For reference, most modern militaries have boot camps at most a few months long.   US military boot camps range from 6 - 13 weeks depending on the branch of the service. Advanced non-infantry job training may take longer.  Modern special forces may go through a number of schools after basic training, but still less than 3 years worth.  Historically, boot camps were much shorter and less organized.  Three years seems like an especially long time for a para/military boot camp, though it does correspond to the length of time in attendance at a Japanese high school, which is also a common setting for anime.  Is this more than a coincidence? "
240,"Why does Yoruichi say, ""No one there could have survived a fight against Byakuya,"" in Bleach chapter 120?","In chapter 116 of the Bleach manga, Ichigo finally meets Rukia in her tower (well, in fact, on the bridge) right after Byakuya has easily defeated Ganjyu, and Ukitake stopped him from finishing Ganjyu off.   However, when Ichigo tries to fight Byakuya, Yoruichi hits him in the stomach, and runs away carrying Ichigo. A little later, in chapter 120, when Ichigo complains about it, she says that he ""had no chance of surviving that fight"", and that ""no one could have survived a fight against Byakuya"".   While I have no doubt that Ichigo in his condition was no match for Byakuya, that phrase still confuses me. I can understand why Yoruichi thinks she would not be able to do it, since she has been in cat form for a long time, and mentions that she had ""gone a lot weaker"". However, Ukitake was on the bridge as well, and since we know he's a kind man, it is safe to assume that he would try to stop Byakuya from killing people (as he did for Ganjyu).   So did Yoruichi imply that Ukitake is also weaker than Byakuya, and had no chance of surviving a fight with him either? Wouldn't that be really debatable? "
241,What is the reference to Kiba's speech and Issei's flashback in episode 2 of High School DxD Hero?,"I've just started watching the 4th season of High School DxD (Hero). I know it's been a while since I've last seen the previous episodes. However, in episode 2, this line in Kiba's speech made me wonder if I had missed any episodes/OVA.           Kiba: I heard you had to deal with the four Great Devils?   A few seconds after, Issei had a flashback and then I was sure, I missed some episodes.           Unknown character: Right now, you are finally in front of many doors with a key in hand.   Is Issei's flashback from any OVA/movie/episode? Which one? "

243,Does anime really account for 60% of the world’s animation-based entertainment?,"I see some variation of this self-proclaimed unattributed fact on the web:      Anime accounts for 60% of the world's animation-based entertainment. So successful is animation in Japan, that there are almost 130 voice-acting schools in the country.   How true is this fact? What was the original source? What about the other 40%? "
244,Why are the translations of 邪王真眼 (jaou shingan) so divergent?,"In Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai, Rikka refers to herself as 邪王真眼 (Jaou Shingan). Wikipedia says this translates literally to ""True Eye of the Evil King"".     A while back, I watched a fansub which translated it as 'Tyrant's Eye'. I'm now watching the official Sentai Filmworks translation, which I've so far been pretty underwhelmed by. The official translation uses 'Wicked Lord Shingan', as if jaou is a title and shingan is a name.  Why are these three translations so different? 'Tyrant's Eye' is easy enough to see; the meaning is close to the literal translation, and it sounds better in English. But why is the official translation so far off?  Is there some ambiguity in the original Japanese that makes this hard to translate? Or did the official translators drop the ball? "
245,Which side is Yamato on?,"In Naruto Chapter 677, Yamato reappears again after posing as fighting against the Great Shinobi Alliance and the Kages.  Which side is he on now currently? If he is on Madara's side, why? Was he brainwashed? "
246,What happened to people who committed crimes (such as killing) in SAO?,"There are many people in SAO who committed crimes (such as doing PK), yet managed to survive until the end of the game. What happened to them after that? Did they go to trial and get sentenced to prison?  If that's the case, what about people (like Kirito) who killed others involuntarily in self-defense? Were they exempted from trial? "
247,Which Full Metal Panic novels correlate to which Manga/Anime Series?,"The original format for Full Metal Panic is novels. But which novels have been translated to manga form, and what chapters/series does each manga correspond to? And of those, which do the Anime series map to? Or is there much correlation at all? "
248,What happened between Kirito and Asuna in those 2 years?,"According to the 2nd episode, Kirito and Asuna met in the first month of SAO. Yet 2 years later, they meet again and it seems they are like complete strangers.  What happened to them in those 2 years? Do the light novels explain this? "
249,"In Madoka Magica, are the girls' powers related to their wishes?","Some of the Puella Magi seem to have magical powers related to the wishes that they made. Sayaka has regeneration abilities, and she wished to heal someone. Homura has time manipulation abilities, and she wished to go back in time.  But other magical girls, like Mami and Kyouko, don't appear to have powers related to their respective wishes.  So, is there a connection, or is it only a coincidence for Sayaka and Homura? If it's the former, how do Mami and Kouko's wishes relate to their powers? "
250,Is it common for Japanese otaku fans to create AMVs?,"AMV is the term for Anime Music Videos, MEP is the term for Multi-Editor Project, and MMV is the term for Manga Music Video. Some notable favorites of mine that I watch mostly come from the YouTube channel [[MDS]] or Mad Desire Studios. I have noticed that a lot of AMVs are usually made by western otaku fans of anime - so generally from people from countries like America etc.  Do Japanese otaku usually create AMVs, MEPs, or MMVs, or is this just common for otaku who come from America?  Note: If you want to see what an AMV typically looks like, then this (Youtube link) will be good to watch and is one of my favourite AMVs. "
251,Will a person die when their name is written in the situation of death?,"The answer by Imprfectluck at this question made me wonder what would happen to people whose name was written down in the details of another persons death. For example: John Doe dies after his date with Jane Doe. The foremost basic rule of the Death Note states that The human whose name is written in this note shall die. So will Jane Doe die?  We additionally have rule LIV that states that if you write the cause and details of death on a different page, you need to be thinking of the original victim and would not be able to think both of John and Jane at the same time. This would indicate that you have to choose what will happen. Either you think of John and the details happen, either you think of Jane and she dies. Does a similar rule exist when writing on the same page? Or is writing someone's name in the details of another's death just an exception to that first rule?     In order to make the Death Note take effect, the victim's name must be written on the same page, but the cause of death and situation around the death can be described in other pages of Death Note. This will work as long as the person that writes in the Death Note keeps the specific victims name in mind when writing the cause and situation of death.   "
252,Is Blackbeard afraid of Luffy?,"Why does Blackbeard send Burgess to assassinate Luffy? Is he afraid of him? I mean with his 2 Devil Fruit powers, he is overpowered. Even just with his Yami Yami no Mi, he won quite easily against Ace, and now he also has the Gura Gura no Mi and a strong crew.  So is there a special reason for him to kill Luffy? And why not do it himself? Does he fear the D in Luffy's name?  "
253,"Why did Umi only raise five flags ""H-O-K-U-T"" leaving out the O at the end?","About 35 minutes into the animated film, Umi raised these five flags:    Shun, who was invited to Miki Hokuto's farewell party, understood the meaning of the signal flags: ""H-O-K-U-T... Hokuto"". What I don't understand is why didn't Umi raise the sixth O flag to complete the word? Is there a rule or taboo saying the sixth O flag can not be raised? "
254,Why do the Horsemen attack people?,"So, in Owari no Seraph, we have these weird monsters called ""Horsemen of the Apocalypse"" or ""Horsemen of John"", right?   Why do they attack people? What is their motive? Do they, for example, eat people for nutrition? Are they under the control of the vampires? "
255,What is the origin of this alternate ending to Captain Tsubasa?,"A while back, I stumbled upon this video which shows an ending to the Captain Tsubasa series. However, I quickly found out that it is not the real ending.    In this video (which is in Spanish, I could not find the same video in English), we see a young Tsubasa playing with a football, which eventually ends up on the road, leading to Tsubasa being run over by a truck. It then jumps to a scene where Japan is playing Brazil in what seems to be a final. Finally, it jumps to a scene where we see an older Tsubasa lying in an hospital bed.  At the beginning of the video, a subtitle goes by saying something similar to:     This is the closest to another ending in which Oliver (Tsubasa) has no legs in the hospital.     I ended up finding another video (also in Spanish) that elaborates on the story.  It explains that on the first chapter of the original manga, Tsubasa is hit by that same truck from the other video, but since he has a football, the impact is absorbed by it. He then starts to think of the football as his friend, and so the story we know unravels.  The video then states that in the final against Brazil, after Tsubasa scores a goal, the scene jumps to him waking up in the hospital and hugging his mother, telling him that they had won. The video states that if we look close enough, we will notice Tsubasa has no legs, because he really lost them in that accident, and is just waking up from a coma, having imagined all of the storyline. The video even states that there is a theory that this might have been part of the original plan by the author, since the word 'dream' is present in many of the titles, basically claiming that this is the original ending to the series.    All the information regarding this alternate video seems to be in Spanish, and I have not found much relevant info in English. The few English sources I found state this is fan-made. I tend to lean toward that possibility, as the one proposed by that last video seem pretty farfetched.    Whichever may be the case: What is the exact origin of this alternate ending? Was it really supposed to be the original ending? Or if it is fan-made, where did it originate? When was it first seen?    I have not seen much of the series. The little I have seen was when I was a kid, and from a Portuguese dubbed version. So I know basically nothing about the storyline of the series. "
256,What exactly is the Code Geass?,"I have watched the series once and I believe there are quite a few things left unexplained. The powers for instance can be transferred to others by only the people who have the ""Code"" like C.C. or V.V.   So what exactly is this code? And was Charles after immortality when he tried to acquire C.C.'s code? He even acquired V.V's code didn't he? So he was immortal. Why was he after C.C.?  "

258,The forms of a demon weapon- what is off limits?,"In Soul Eater and Soul Eat Not!, we see a variety of different weapon types- swords, guns, scythes, etc. Based on this post, we can assume the origin of demon weapons to be from experiments. So if they are not born, but made, this means that Death and other creators originally decided what type of weapon they needed, and created accordingly. Assumedly, they could they have done this with any item, not just a weapon- thus, is there something canon that says they have to be weapons?    (Surely there were other items that could have been of use instead of pure offense. Shields, armor- with the exception of Tsubaki's and Black Star's Shield Star. This brings into question what is needed for a good team balance in a fight, which is out of scope of this question.) "
259,Is Junko Enoshima a masochist?,"Is she a masochist? Her mental behaviour indicates that she is a masochist by obsessing with despair.      She killed her sister, lover and classmate.

Afterwards Anpanman loses a lot of strength, but later regains it by having Jam Ojisan bake him a new head. It made me wonder, what would happen if Anpanman lost his entire head? Would he die? Is it even possible? If yes, how?    I promise I won't tell Baikinman.  "
262,What's the difference between streaming anime via Steam and Crunchyroll?,"On the Steam anime sale a little while back, I noticed that Steam has added support for steaming anime. One example is Gintama. When this sale was on, there was a large banner saying these streams have something to do with Crunchyroll, whilst not as apparent anymore, you can still see this connection in Steam by visiting the 'Visit the website' button in the store. Which for Gintama, takes us to this Crunchyroll page.  For the complete list of these you can visit the Anime Streaming Videos Steam Store page. Where the Crunchyroll streams, for me, start at Gintama and ends at Izetta: The Last Witch.  Are these streamed via Crunchyroll? If so, what advantages and disadvantages do I have for paying and streaming them through Steam, rather than Crunchyroll? "
263,How does Hollow exorcism work?,"In Bleach, season 1 episode 3 (around 19:00) Orihime's brother, who is a Hollow, stabs himself with Ichigo's Zanpakuto.  Soul Reapers are supposed to have the power to exorcise the Hollows to send their souls to the Soul Society; however, it is implied here that it isn't necessarily the Soul Reaper who exercises the soul, but rather the Zanpakuto itself.  Is there a clear definition on how this whole process is supposed to work? Or can Hollows just commit suicide with a Zanpakuto and have their soul cleansed as if the Soul Reaper had done it? "

In chapter 45, Killua and Zushi's names are also in the Latin alphabet.    Most of the writing uses the Hunter x Hunter alphabet, so why are these names written in the Latin alphabet? Is it just another language that is used in Hunter x Hunter world? If so, is there an anything that indicates where the Latin alphabet comes from in the world of Hunter x Hunter?  "
267,Difference between original broadcast and Special Edition (OVA),"There seems to be a difference in narrator for different versions of Code Geass' ending.

268,Are the Japanese names of the characters from Ente Isla references to something?,"I feel like there is some kind of joke with the characters' fake names that I am missing.

269,Does Haki also eliminate Devil Fruit users' weakness against water?,"If Luffy covers his arm with Haki and puts it in the water, will he lose his power or does the Haki cancel the effect of the water?  I thought about it because of this image.    When Luffy used his ""Red Hawk"" against Hody, the water had no effect on his power. Is this because of the Haki he used for Red Hawk (which was not well drawn in the anime) or is there another reason? "

Why can Ymir read it, but Reiner could not?  "

273,Is Genos really a cyborg?,"So Genos has been a ""cyborg"" since he got that surgery. But is he really a cyborg?  To me, a cyborg is a human with robot parts attached to their body, but I have seen no human part in him. His face doesn't count since it has mechanical parts. So is he a cyborg or not?  Does he just say he's a cyborg because he used to be a human? Or he does have little human parts in him, but we can't see them? "
274,Why do anime production studios keep the rights to anime which they don't plan on continuing?,"There are a lot of anime that have a first season, but no second season, even though there is enough material to produce another season. There are also a few anime which are dubbed, but only up to a certain point in the series.  So, why do anime companies keep the rights to these anime, instead of passing them on to another company?  For example, here are a few anime which didn't get more seasons:   Mayo Chiki (1 season) - Big cliffhanger Rosario Vampire (2 seasons) - Another cliffhanger High School of the Dead (1 season) The World God Only Knows (3 seasons) - Missed out a lot of content   And some which are dubbed only to a certain point in the series:   Detective Conan (130 episodes) - Stopped due to low ratings The Familiar of Zero (1 season) - Dubbed no further due to low ratings   There are many more examples. Why are the studios behind these series and dubs reluctant to release the rights to others to continue the series? "
275,Why did Tyuule feel sad?,"In the final episode Tyuule said to herself that she did what she did to get revenge for her fallen country. But what was that made her sad? The actions that she took, or that she fell in love with the prince Zolzal? "
276,Why didn't Ross' broken bracelet cause suspicion?,"Rewatching episode 17 of Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, we are shown several times Maria Ross' prison ""bracelet"" on her ""corpse"". The bracelet is shown to be broken even after Edward appears on the scene and confronts Mustang. (We are shown later that Havoc removes it after Ross escapes into some building.)    Given that this is the case, shouldn't there be a suspicion that this isn't Ross (by the relevant authorities)? Or is this simply glossed over (particularly since Ross' dental records were removed earlier, since the coroner doing the autopsy was effectively ""collaborating"" with Mustang, and since Mustang presumably has reason to have Ross killed?)? "
277,Which was the name of this Rurouni Kenshin song?,I remember the song in the begining of this video was from Rurouni Kenshin. But I can't remember its name. Which is the name of that song?  [website]
278,What happened to Charioces XIV through XVI?,"The king during the events of Rage of Bahamut: Genesis was Charioce XIII (he's introduced as such when Favaro and friends are brought before him in episode 6). The destruction wrought by Bahamut in episode 12 ends up killing him.  The king at the start of Rage of Bahamut: Virgin Soul, just ten years later, is Charioce XVII (introduced as such when he returns to the capital in episode 1).   That leaves a gap of three Charioces unaccounted for. What happened to Charioces XIV through XVI? Did Anati really have four different kings in the mere ten years following Charioce XIII's death? "
279,Is Haki visible to other characters?,"We know of the several forms of Haki, the Kenbunshoku Haki, Busoshoku Haki and the Haoshoku Haki. I've been wondering, are those Haki visible to other characters in the One Piece universe, or only visible for the reader?  And I am mainly interested in the Busoshoku Haki, as this seems to harden the body and makes the skin look metal like. Can people in the One Piece universe also see this metal like change? Or is this just for the viewer to differentiate between normal fighting and Haki fighting? "
280,What is the Evangelion reference Araragi was talking about?,"At the beginning of Nisemonogatari before the opening, we see Araragi chained and handcuffed in the cram school with Senjōgahara being the perpetrator. At one point, Araragi said that he would be enjoying the moment more if it wasn't for the Evangelion reference.  What is the reference he was talking about? I didn't see anything which hinted at an Evangelion reference. "
281,What do we know about Yuri Katsuki's college education?,"At some point in the period covered in the first episode, between the Grand Prix Final and Yuri's return to Hasetsu, Yuri must have graduated from university.   At the Grand Prix Final, which is in December, Morooka speaks to Yuri and notes that he has not yet graduated. Afterwards, when Yuri returns home in March of the next year, his mother apologises for not attending his graduation ceremony.1 Mari also notes that Yuri has a college degree, even if it took him an extra year.   Yuri also points out that he has not been back to Hasetsu in five years, and that he spent a period in Detroit:     I'm one of the dime-a-dozen top figure skaters certified by the JSF. I'm 23. My name makes me sound strong, but I finished last at my first Grand Prix Final. I still can't accept what happened! I even moved to a training facility in Detroit and worked hard to make the final.   Can we infer from this anything about where Yuri went to college? Perhaps he went to college in Detroit and graduated from a university there?     Crunchyroll subtitles write the date as ""March, One Year Later."" However, based on what Yuri said about crashing through the rest of his skating season, it must only be a couple months after the GPF, rather than more than a year. The original text &mdash; 翌年3月 &mdash; appears to corroborate this.  "
282,Did Gohan ask Piccolo to do fusion?,"In Dragon Ball Super episode 88, around 20:15 mark, Gohan said something to Piccolo about the idea to become more powerful.  In one subtitle, I've read Gohan asked Piccolo to do some attack or technique together. But in other translation, Gohan asked Piccolo to do a combined technique or a fusion together.  It's also raising speculation among fans too (YouTube video about Gohan's fusion with Piccolo)  Which one is true? "
283,Do the class cards physically exist in the main Fate universe?,"In the Prisma Illya universe, the class cards (cf. below) are physically real magical items. But what about in the ""main"" Fate universe, where Fate/stay night is set? Do the class cards physically exist there (even perhaps in some non-magical capacity)?     We do see a fair bit of them in the VN, but never ""in-universe"", per se, at least as far as I remember - we mostly see them as illustrations to accompany explanations given to Shirou, without any actual indication that they are physically present.   I would have thought that the class cards don't physically exist there, but I just had a look at the first OP for DEEN/stay night, and there's a shot there of Kirei holding the cards (cf. video). Not that DEEN/stay night should necessarily be taken at face value, but it does make me wonder.   "
284,Is there a different relation between Kaede and Sia?,"In the last episode of Shuffle, while the end theme song was rolling with credits, there was a scene where Kaede and Sia were together and then they crashed into something falling over each other and accidentally ""kissed"". Their expression was toooo ""different"" so? Do they have or grew a romantic relation?  "
285,Can 2 different species do a dance fusion and work?,"In episode 88th of Dragon Ball Super, in one subtitled version       Gohan asks Piccoro why dont they try a technique of fusion together. Note: this could be a bad translation because in another subtitled version he doesnt say exactly the same    So my question is , can 2 different species in Dragon Ball do a fusion dance and work? We know a fusion between 2 different people can work with the Potara earrings (for example a supreme kai and a witch) but what about fusion with the fusion dance? will something like that work? "
286,Do shadow clones copy user's injury?,"There are several instances where injured Naruto used shadow clones:   While fighting with Kabuto, Kabuto severed the muscle and tendon of Naruto. Later, when Naruto used a shadow clone to make Rasengan, did the shadow clone have the same injury as Naruto? After the final fight with Sasuke (i.e. after defeating Kaguya), were the shadow clones of Naruto missing their right arms [before being treated by First Hokage, Hashirama's cells]?   Apart from these two, even thoroughly exhausted Kakashi used shadow clones after defeating Zabuza. Were these shadow clones injured? "
287,How 'wild Digimon' in the Digital World fuse or DNA digivolve?,"Digimon with human partner can easily fuse/DNA digivolve using digivice, like Omegamon in Digimon Adventure Movie.    My question is how 'wild Digimon' fuse/DNA Digivolve? Let's use Royal Knight's Omegamon as an example. How did he came to be? "
288,Is Honey Senpai a Shota?,"If so, then what would be the opposite of Honey Senpai's character? Like between the ages of 40 years an up?  I read it one time when I was looking at Japanese Shoujo Manga, but I do remember encountering it on the site Manga Here. "
289,Why does Arashigaoka Academy share a name with Wuthering Heights?,"I am currently reading Aoi Hana, in which students at a girls' school put up a production of Wuthering Heights. Out of curiosity, I went to Google to determine whether the Takarazuka Revue ever produced an adaptation of the same. There apparently was; I noticed on a Wiki page that the Japanese title of the production (and thus, the novel) was Arashi ga Oka (嵐が丘).  This brought me to my question: Kureha attends Arashigaoka Academy (嵐が丘学園) in Yuri Kuma Arashi, so the name of her school must then be a reference to Wuthering Heights. Is there any particular reason why this literary reference fits?   Are there any specific parallels with YKA (whether the manga, the anime, or the light novels) that would make this reference appropriate? Alternatively, is there something about the tone of Wuthering Heights that fits one part or another of the YKA franchise?  "
290,How did the sweatdrop originate?,"I can kind of handwave or fanwank the origin of things like the exasperated faceplant or the vein popping out when a character is comedic-angry, and even the trope of Japanese flag fans coming out when people want to cheer on their comrades, but how did the sweatdrop come to characterize the feeling of sort of embarrassed contrition?     I can't come up with anything logical just based on speculation. Is this an outgrowth of the manzai tradition, with the tsukkomi and boke characters? "
291,Why isn't Holy Scripture Triten inside Caubac Alcatraz Labyrinth?,"Reading on the TYPE-MOON Wiki it says that Hibiki Hibino     ...is the Holy Scripture Triten (聖典トライテン, ?) of Caubac Alcatraz   on Caubac Alcatraz's page it says in the second paragraph in his Abilities     He created a labyrinth inside a treasure chest that cannot be opened to protect his ideal terminal, the Holy Scripture Triten, but the reason he hasn't appeared for a century is because he accidentally became trapped inside.   Now obviously Arcueid can get to him as she states that it's ""too troublesome to get to him while he is in his own world"" probably referring to how the chest cannot be opened and probably the chest being near indestructible otherwise it's easy picking for the Church, but she seems to imply she can get inside anyway as she threatens to kill him in his own world when he enrages her by telling her that he was talking about her having found love like that of a human.  But the point of the labyrinth is to protect Holy Scripture Triten and it was Hibiki Hibino who handed the phone to Arcueid. So why isn't Holy Scripture Triten inside Caubac's Labyrinth? is Caubac even aware that she isn't in the Labyrinth?  I use tsukihime because of Arcueid and that Caubac Alcatraz is one of The Twenty-seven Dead Apostle Ancestors and these are more references in Tsukihime than Fate "
292,Does super saiyan god Vegeta exist in the anime series continuity?,"As we know super saiyan god Vegeta appeared in the manga but not in the anime series. This could mean super saiyan god Vegeta doesn't exist in the anime, since there are concepts and elements from the anime which indeed don't exist in the manga, for example, Trunks super saiyan rage transformation or Vegeta super saiyan blue evolution transformation were created for the anime only, and elements from the manga which don't exist in the anime, for example, the mastered super saiyan blue transformation. But now we know super saiyan god Vegeta is going to appear in the Broly movie, and it isn't just concept art, there is already a screen-capture from upcoming the movie    What does this mean? Does it mean the movie is following the manga continuity (since SSG Vegeta only appeared in the manga continuity) and that we could see a mastered super saiyan blue Vegeta for example, but not a super saiyan blue evolution Vegeta, or since this is also animated media does this mean super saiyan god Vegeta also exists in the anime series (in spite of we never saw it) and that the movie either will follow the anime series continuity or a mix of the anime and manga continuities? "
293,Where does the golden great ape transformation fit in the saiyan transformations scale?,"Are the multipliers from the super saiyan transformation (x50) and Oozaru transformation (x10) supposed to add up in the golden great ape transformation?  Or does it have just a different multiplier? With x10 (Oozaru) *x50 (SSJ) it would be x500 which is little over SSJ3 (x400) , but if I recall correctly Baby golden great ape transformation was a tough fight for SSJ4 Goku .   Where does the golden great ape transformation fit in the saiyan transformations scale? Is it over SSJ3? Is it equal to SSJ4? Is it over SSJ4? "
294,Why do people tend to think anime is weird porno?,"Why do people not directly exposed to anime tend to think of it as weird porn?  It would not be the first time I tell somebody who is not really into anime that I watch it and get questioned as to why I watch animated pornography. Until the point I confront them with the fact that Dragon Ball and Pokémon are also animes.   It also does not seem to be a Western culture thing, as several people I know in India, America, Russia also tend to respond in the same way.   Is there a specific reason as to why this stereotyping came to be? "
295,Do the eyes retain the host's powers or the donor's Ocular abilities after it's transplanted to obtain Eternal Mangekyou Sharingan?,"When a Mangekyou Sharingan is replaced with someone else's eyes in an attempt to obtain Eternal Mangekyou Sharingan, do the eyes retain the host's powers or the donor's Ocular powers? Also, why can a ""sealed Sharingan"" merge to form an Eternal Mangekyou? "
296,"When an Uchiha member is going to get married with another Uchiha member, are they marrying their cousin?","Like my question is asking, are they marrying their own cousin? I'm wondering this because I remember Obito telling Naruto that Sasuke was his relative in volume 71 chapter 683: I Dreamt the Same Dream. I also remember Madara saying the same thing to Sasuke and Obito, which got my attention.  So according to what I've read in the manga they are saying their blood is all connected which, therefore, makes them all relative? So if they are relatives that make them cousins or something like that? If they do end up being cousins, are they marrying their own cousin? Isn't that kind of disturbing to them or am I wrong and in the Uchiha there are still different family members but have the same last name, which makes them all ""relatives""? "
297,What does the ending of Death Note (manga) mean?,"The last few pages of the end of the final book in the Death Note series shows a huge amount of people in hoods walking in a line across the mountains and one offering a candle to Kira their ""saviour"".  At first when I saw this I was quite confused about who these people were, I thought that perhaps they were the land of the dead and that these were all the people he saved? Then someone pointed out to me that the moon and the stars were probably there for a reason and wouldn't be in the land of the dead, which supposedly didn't even exist anyway given the conversation Ryuk had with Light just before he died.  So is this then meant to be some sort of a religion which has formed which holds Kira as their saviour? "
298,Did Trisha Elric know about Hohenheim's condition?,"So I've watched FMA: Brotherhood (in quite a rush), and I can't seem to find an answer to whether Trisha Elric knew about Hohenheim's immortality and his past. Had he revealed it to her? Or was she aware of it somehow? "
299,"What is the meaning of ""Argonaut""?",In episode 9 of Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon? (DanMachi) Bell learns how to use an Argonaut skill which Hestia refers to as a skill for a hero.  What is the literal meaning of Argonaut when used in this context? 
300,"What happened in the final episode of the Evangelion TV series, titled ""Take care of yourself""?","What actually happened in the last episode of the Neon Genesis Evangelion TV series? It is episode 26, entitled ""Take care of yourself""?  I have read different wikis about the plot of the episode, but I still don't understand it. "
301,How did Nue Survive?,"During the beginning arc of Boruto, Sumire tries to carry on the will of her father by trying to destroy Konoha with Nue, She used the ""cute scary"" beast to feed on people's chakra and negative emotions, but was later on discovered by Boruto and his friends. After Boruto defeated Nue and escaped from ""Nue's dimension"", we see the summoning mark vanish, and I initially thought Nue died but apparently he didn't.    My questions are as follows: how was nue able to survive?   how does the mark reappear on Sumire's hand if Nue technically died? Also, Does Nue have size limitation due to the decrease in the summoning mark? "
302,What's the job or purpose of the family of The BaskerVilles in Pandora Hearts?,"I have read the manga and I know that the Baskervilles are the supporters of Glen Baskerville,  but what is their real job? Is it to protect the abyss or to make the abyss come to the earth and destroy it so they can find the core of the abyss? "
303,Are anime that air before a manga adaptation considered filler anime?,"In the question Has an anime ever come out before the manga was published? it became quite obvious that there are indeed several animes that air before their manga has been made.  But this also made me wonder about the following: Does this imply that all anime that air before a manga of it exist should be considered fillers?  Fillers are non-canonical material, which usually implies it did not happen in the manga. Or as Urban Dictionary stated it     filler      A segment of anime, whether it be an entire episode or part of one, which does not appear in the manga of the title. Fillers, as the name implies, ""fills"" an episode with non-canonical material which has been written usually by the same company which animates it.   "
304,Why did Aizen kidnap Orihime in Bleach?,I remember that Aizen kidnapped Orihime but I don't remember if it was explained well why this happened. I have several hypothesis but not sure if they are true:   Was it that the Hogyoku didn't work until Orihime cured it some how? Was there such a scene in Bleach that gives evidence to this? Why wouldn't the Hohyoku work? Wasn't Aizen already giving more power to his hollows even before Orihime?  Is that why Aizen needed her or was it something else? To Maybe torture her to distract the Shinigami and Ichigo? But it seems that at this point he didn't really thought Ichigo mattered so it doesn't seem convincing.  Or did he use her to heal his Espadas?  Or did he do that to lure the Shinigami and trap them to Hueco Mundo?   Is there maybe another reason? Or are there multiple reasons combined? Aizen was smart so I am sure he had a reason to kidnap Orihime. 
305,What does Headphone Actor represent or mean?,"On the 6th episode of Mekakucity Actors, there was a scene where Takane was directed by, presumably, her own voice to escape the city, which was falling apart. Now, there was a similar scenario in the song the episode was based on with the same title in the Kagerou Project, which was what the entire anime is based on.   I'm not sure I understand what the purpose of this is. Because it doesn't seem like it's real. The city she lives in is not literally falling apart, I don't think. Otherwise everyone else would have died. So it must be symbolic for something. Am I missing anything here? What is the purpose of the song and the scene in that particular episode? "
306,How closely does the Initial D anime follow the manga?,"I have been watching the Initial D anime, but still haven't read the manga. How far does the anime cover, in respect to the manga? Are there any manga or anime exclusive content? "
307,Why did the Greater Grail fulfill Shirou's wish while the other Servants were still alive?,"When Shirou enters the Greater Grail, it accepts his wish and starts executing it. However, at that time there were still Servants of both factions alive and fighting. Why did the Grail comply if the war had not ended yet?  My only guess is that this grail is from the previous, Third war. And since Shirou is pretty much the only survivor, he deserves his wish granted. But in that case, why would the Grail start a new war summoning new Servants? "
308,Can Blackbeard consume more than one Devil Fruit?,"  Can Blackbeard consume more than just one Devil Fruit? If yes, then what is the upper limit?  When he reaches the maximum number of Devil Fruits, can he change them, i.e. can he lose one of the Devil Fruits to consume a new one? "
309,"What are the squinting faces (>_<, >o<, >△<, etc.) called?","The squinting face that anime characters make can express a range of expressions. Here are two examples:   From this alone we might be inclined to call it the ""cute crying face."" However, consider the next picture:    The character (Rokka from Shoujou Yokai) still uses the same face, but does not display sadness. For context, the character was being used as a weapon to punch a villain in the manga and was happy to be able to defeat the villain.  From sadness to happiness to frustration, it cannot be pinpointed to one particular emotion. They do have cuteness in common, although it's not always used to emphasize cuteness.  What is this face called exactly? Does it even have a name? "
310,"What do ""sama"" and ""kun"" mean? Are they related to the shinobi rank?","In Naruto, Yamato called Kakashi as Kakashi-sama, whereas Naruto as Naruto-kun.  Previously, I thought that sama was for equal or higher rank shinobis while kun was for junior rank shinobis. But I noticed that I might be wrong as Hinata too called Naruto as Naruto-kun.  I found some general answers on Yahoo! Answers, but is there a specific reason why they did that in Naruto? What's the actual meaning of sama and kun? "
311,How fast is the 3D Maneuver Gear (3DMG)?,"Approximately how fast can people move around with the 3D Maneuver Gear (3DMG) in Attack on Titan? What is the maximum speed attainable? If people can move faster when the hook is reeled in, then I want that answer, if they can move faster in the air by swinging then I want that answer. But I don't want the speed of the hooks. "
312,"Piccolo-Gohan fusion, can it be allowed in the Universal Tournament?","In Dragon Ball Super episode 88th, according to some subtitles in a popular anime webpage, confirmed by Anime SE member Aki Tanaka who speaks japanese, Gohan literally says to Piccolo ""If so, should we create a fusion technique, or combination (attack)?"" .   what does the original japanese audio says in episode 88th when Gohan is talking to Piccolo and asks him to do something in the battle together?  According to what's been said up to today about the Universal Tournament rules, could this be allowed?  "
313,"Kekkai Sensen ep9, meaning of ""playing it backwards in double-time/fast-forward""?","5:54 Zapp said ""What's he doin', playing it backwards in fast-forward?""

314,Was it ever stated canonically that Itachi was already dying when he fought Sasuke?,Has it ever been confirmed in any official source whether Itachi was dying from some sort of terminal illness when he decided to fight his brother?  I seem to remember White Zetsu commenting during the fight that Itachi was unable to dodge certain attacks which he should have been able to dodge.  Has there been a confirmation of this? 
315,Why are bears in yaoi animes?,In Yaoi I have fairly noticed a highly recurring thing which is Bears. In particular I am aiming this at Yaoi's such as Sekai Ichi Hatsukoi and Junjou Romantica.  Examples:      So my question is what is the relationship between the re-occurring bears seen in Yaoi's such as Sekai Ichi Hatsukoi and Junjou Romantica and are bears related to homosexuals in yaoi? and where did the idea of bears come from? Why bears? 
316,"Why do people call the Bijuu ""tailed beasts"" if not all of them have tails?","So a couple of days ago I was, as usual, on random websites and, for some reason, ended up in the Naruto Wikia on the Bijuu page. I scanned through the page, not really reading anything on there, as I scrolled down. I ended up at the trivia part of the page, which made me start reading. One particular part got my attention, which said:     While most of the tailed beasts have conventional tails, Chōmei and Gyūki differ; Chōmei has one regular tail and six wings that make up its seven tails, while Gyūki has eight cephalopod limbs that serve as tails.   So we know that Chōmei has one tail and six wings and Gyūki has eight cephalopod limbs that, I guess, count as tails, for some reason. So if Chōmei and Gyūki don't really have all 7 or 8 conventional tails (as in not all are actually tails) why do they call them ""Tailed Beasts""? Or do people just confuse the wings and cephalopod limbs for tails? Or are people just, normally, counting the others, which have all tails, and then mistake the wings and cephalopod limbs for tails? "
317,When will season 3 of Heaven's Lost Property come out?,"I've been wondering if season 3 for heaven's lost property would come out or if it was already out. Could direct me to the place where I could find it? If it isn't out yet, would you happen to know if it will come out and when exactly might it come out? I am a U.S. Citizen but I am currently not in the mainland. I'm at Hawaii and hopefully me telling you that might help... "

319,"What or who is ""Minami"" in ""Search for Minami""?","In chapter 63 of Kare Kano, Arima appears on a television show called Search for Minami after he is recognised for his academic and athletic prowess. The beginning of the show is depicted in the manga, and it begins with:     Hello! And welcome to the popular ""Search for Minami!"" Today, we're visiting Hokuei High school &hellip; Hokuei High School is Kanagawa prefecture's top school. Today's ""Minami"" is going to be out of this world &hellip; Well, then, let's bring our guest, Soichiro Arima-kun!   (I removed short exclamations that did not appear to originate from the key show host in this section, such as ""I'm excited myself!"") What exactly does ""Minami"" mean in this context? That it is left untranslated suggests that it is supposed to be an important name, but I have trouble finding anything that would fit the context. Is there some sort of cultural knowledge that I am missing here? "
320,What is this paper fan used by some student council president/senior member called?,"In many anime, a student council president or senior member uses essentially a paper 'fan' to discipline others.

323,Manga Spoilers: Why didn't this character transform when injured?,"In episode 29 (episode 4 in season 2) of Attack on Titan, why didn't      Reiner transform into his titan mode when he is injured from the bite of the small titan in that castle?   As I understand, titan shifters are able to transform by injuring themselves or by others. Can someone explain or did I miss some details? "
324,Was the titan in the last episode of AOT S1 inside of the wall or on the other side? Also about walls origin,"First, is the titan really inside of the wall like being trapped in it or just doing his/its job (lol)? I thought it was on the other side ever since because I have seen many comments/texts using the word ""inside"" which is very confusing.  Also it was said so far in the anime (currently S2 E6), that walls are (possibly?) made of titans' ""crystals"" making it pretty much indestructible, so doesn't that mean that titans aren't neccessarily inside of the walls since it would make the plot point a very funny one.  I am also confused as to how the walls are said to be ""indestructible"" like titans' crystals except certain parts like ""entrances/exits"", but some titans are seen to be able to pretty much destroy wall parts that are said to be indestructible like how (the collosal titan destroyed some parts of it) not sure if it really did though?   P.S. It's okay to spoil about the origin of the walls in your answers. "
325,Why wasn't the Susanoo used?,"During their fight with Kaguya, Obito, or even Sasuke didn't use their Susanoo which could have protected them from Kaguyas ""Bone Ash"" jutsu.  Same is the case when Sasuke fought Madara (Tobirama was lying on the ground paralysed and Sasuke jumped from above to attack Madara). Sasuke could have used his Susanoo, but he didn't.  Was this just a loophole on the writer's part? Or is there a reason behind it? "

328,"Why is ""Sousei no Onmyouji"" translated to ""Twin Star Exorcists""?","How exactly does Sousei no Onmyouji translate to Twin Star Exorcists?  I tried Google Translate, but that didn't give me any satisfactory results. So what do Sousei and Onmyouji literally mean? "
329,"What is Toji's ""accent""?","I was reading a scanlation of the Evangelion manga and noticed that Toji consistently uses a lot of ""informal""-sounding speech. I chalked this up to poor translation quality &mdash; I tend to find this sort of thing distracting &mdash; but when I read a licensed translation to English, I saw similar language. For example, from ch. 20: ""Ikari! Yer not allowed ta look!""  Later, Asuka accidentally provokes someone at the arcade. Someone, possibly Suzuhara, tells Toji to talk to the angered man because both have the same ""accent"". Thus, it seems unlikely that Toji's language is similar to, for example, Shinji's, when he asks Toji ""Whadda mean?"" after being asked about his exchange with Rei in the same chapter. In other words, it does not sound like Toji's habits fall within the ""normal"" bounds of variation in how people are supposed to talk.  What is this ""accent""? What is Toji's language supposed to correspond to in the Japanese original? "
330,Who is Gakuhō Asano wife? What is their story?,"The anime features him only having a son but how did that come to happen? Him being a superhuman and all, he probably wouldn't settle down for a normal girl, or would he? What is the story there? Did he ever get married? "
331,Why wasn't Kaori Miyazono famous?,"From the show's earlier episodes, it's easily evident that Kaori was a great violinist. Even one of the judges was shocked and wondered like ""where had she been all this time and why isn't she famous?""   Why wasn't Kaori famous or known as a notable violinist? Even a popular violinist like Toshiya Miike knew about Kaori, as it's shown in the anime that he dislikes Kaori's playing style and disrespects her in front on Arima. "
332,Which Bach piece is Saki Yoshizawa using for her ringtone?,"During the first part of episode 9 of Boogiepop Phantom, we meet Saki Yoshizawa, a high school student who plays piano. When her cell phone rings while they are on their way to a piano lesson, Saki's kouhai points out that Saki is using ""Bach's étude"" as her ringtone, and Saki, who is a second year student, replies that it is her ""test piece"" for ""next year.""  This appears to also be the piece that plays in the background during the students' piano lesson. (The music starts playing while Saki's kouhai is having her lesson, but given that it is Saki who has to prepare the piece, it is uncertain whether this is what the kouhai is actually playing; the kouhai's responses in the conversation about the ringtone also do not strike me to be those that someone playing the same piece would have.)  I do not remember J.S. Bach to be a composer who wrote ""études"" for keyboard: Bach did write pedagogical material, but I cannot recall a single piece of his that is labelled as an étude. I also tried searching for bach ""étude"" site:imslp.org to see if the IMSLP archive had something relevant, but nothing came up.  With this in mind, what is the actual title of the Bach piece that Saki is learning and using for her ringtone? If the piece is part of a multi-movement work, I would also like to know the specific movement that is quoted in Boogiepop Phantom, "
333,Are there really differences between the story lines of the Rahxephon movie and series?,"My all time favorite anime is without doubt Rahxephon. I've watched both the series and the movie. As I recall correctly the movie can be considered a summary of the series except for the end. I had a lot of trouble understanding the end of the original series, but on the other hand the movie's ending seemed to be 'dumbed' down.  Is this an incorrect impression of me, due to the summarizing? Or are there indeed differences between both story lines?  "
334,Is it common for light novels to have animated commercials?,"Being a fan of 掟上今日子の備忘録 (Okitegami Kyouko no Bibouroku, or ""The Memorandum of Okitegami Kyouko""), I found the following promotional videos online:   Okitegami Kyouko x Monogatari series, collab CM Okitegami Kyouko x Monogatari series, second collab CM   The part I found intriguing with both of these CMs was that Kyouko is animated at the end of these commericals, even though (as of writing) there is no plan for an animated version of the series. The animation is credited to Shaft, which is unsurprising since Shaft is responsible for animating the Monogatari series by the same author. However, the CM stands out in comparison to others like this other Kyouko one or this Date A Live one (from before Date A Live was adapted into an anime), which feature mostly static images and effects rather than animated characters.  So my question is this: is it common for light novels to have an animated commercial (especially with original animation created just for the commercial) despite not having plans to adapt the novel into an anime in the near future? Or, at the very least, have there been other instances of this in the past? "
335,Toothbrush joke?,"In episode 6 of Busou Shoujo Machiavellism at about 17:15, there is a scene where Nomura sneaks into a girl's room and finds a toothbrush.   He gets excited and starts brushing his teeth with it. The side character hits him and says ""Is now the time for this?""  Is this a common joke or prank as an anime trope? Or was there a more significant plot point that I am missing?  Attached below is a screen shot of the scene for easier reference:   "
336,Why is Danbo so popular?,"Originally, Danbo was a cardboard box robot from the manga Yotsuba&amp;!.    But most people recognize Danbo from a photo-shot (that's how I knew of Danbo before I finally read the manga) and if you try to google image search it, the result will be something like this, not the Yotsuba&amp;! manga.    So how could Danbo become so popular? Is there someone who used it for advertising or something? "
337,What defines the art-style of Japanese manga?,"Even though manga has lots of different art styles we still have an idea that certain styles are ""manga style"" and other ones aren't. What is it about an art style that lets us know it's manga style? What elements reappear across many manga? What distinguishes our idea of manga style from our idea of Western comics style?    "
338,Who owns the Dragon Ball trademark and can officially decide what's canon or not?,"I was trying to understand who can decide in Dragon Ball what's canon or not. You might think it's Akira Toriyama, but as long as the trademark doesnt belong to him, it isnt so. I know it wasnt so with other creators of other animes. Looking in internet, I've found this [website]"
339,Does the manga continue the story from the anime?,"I just finished watching Full Moon wo Sagashite. I wished it got 2nd season, but that's not going to happen. So, I decided to read the manga.  However, does the manga continue the story from the anime's ending? If yes, from which chapter? "
340,How can CP9 members and Sanji run in the air?,"How can CP9 members and Sanji(post-timeskip) run and stand in the air? Do they use something like Haki? If not, what kind of techniques do they use? If it is Haki, can Luffy and Zoro run and stand like they do? "
341,Was mother Caramel eaten by Big Mom? And does eating Devil Fruit Users transfer the powers?,"My question is divided into 3 subsets that have been bothering me for some time now. But they are all related to a theoretical way of gaining devil fruit abilities.   In the flashbacks of Big Mom's past, Mother Caramel and all of Linlin's (Big Moms) friends ""disappear"" after her food rampage. In the background we see Streusen, and he is obviously terrified by what happened. In the anime, it was stated that Mother Caramel disappeared. Big Mom herself has no memories about the event.   Is it a coincidence that Big Mom has the exact same devil fruit ability as Mother Caramel? Or could it be the case that Mother Carmel was eaten by Big Mom?   If we assume (1) to be true, can we also assume that eating Devil Fruit Users will give a person the ability of the fruit?   If so, is it required to eat the entire devil fruit user, or would the person need ""only a bite"", like how only a bite is enough to attain the abilities from the fruits?   If (1) &amp; (2) are true, can this help in answering how Blackbeard stole Whitebeards ""Earth quake"" devil fruit abilities?   I know the last question is only a speculation, because we don't know why Blackbeard can have two powers, and there are some theories out there why he is able to. But could this explain how Blackbeard gained Whitebeards abilities? "
342,How exactly were Madara and Obito able to control Kurama?,"Madara and Obito could control Kurama with their Sharingans. My question is how exactly did they do it? What is required to control this beast? Is the Sharingan enough to do that? Can they control any other beast with the same technique?  I remember Kurama once said Madara's chakra could summon it, but how was Obito able to summon and control it on his very first attempt? There's no way he could've practiced it because it was sealed inside Jinchuriki since Madara's defeat against Hashirama.  So how exactly were Madara and Obito able to control Kurama? "
343,Who is Ninja Ninja?,"On Afro Samurai, who is Ninja Ninja?  People in the series sometimes refer to him as ""Afro's imaginary friend"", however, I remember times where people other than Afro could see him! (Via a scoped rifle, or binoculars).  Also, there are times where he can interact with physical objects in the real world.  So who is he? Is he really imaginary? What is the explanation for his seemingly ""real"" behavior? "
344,Does the anti-Titan artillery exists in the anime?,"Reading conversations about Attack on Titan I've heard about the anti-Titan artillery, which supposedly is a very powerful weapon against Titan more than the regular cannons. I dont remember seeing it in season 1 and season 2. Have they appeared in the anime? If so, which episode? or this only exist in the manga? "
345,Who is the woman who talks to young Tooru Amuro/Rei Furuya?,"Tooru Amuro or Rey Furuya is the Black Organization member nicknamed Bourbon. He actually something like secret police agent (I can't remember the organization's name) who is working undercover in BO. He as Tooru Amuro works at Poirot Cafe, and become Kogoro's apprentice.  I remember a case when Amuro, Conan, Ran and Kogoro are at the hospital and there's a case where a posion is used in a tea.  After Amuro and Conan realise who the suspect of the cases is, there's a kid with her mother counting the lift that coming from the upper floors. When the kid counts to zero (they are on the ground floor), Amuro hears that and he seems surprised about it. He also has a flashback to when he was a kid and was called ""zero"" by a woman.  So, who is she? Who's the woman who speaks to with young Amuro? What is their relation? And also why he called ""zero"" by this woman? "
346,Why did the Elric brothers burn down their house?,Why did the Elric brothers set their house on fire? I mean they could have preserved their house for future use but they didn't. So why did they do this? Is there any main reason behind this which is mentioned in the FMA anime/manga?  
347,Hindi Poster Underneath a Bench in Anohana,"I'm re-watching Ano Hana. On the first episode (22:44.438) I noticed a poster underneath a bench.  I recognized it was written in Hindi although I can't read Hindi. So, was wondering what's written there and what could be it's purpose (the visual detail).  Questions:   What was the Hindi text and what it means? I hope someone can share some thoughts about why this much details was added into a scene. What could be the creator's intention?   Update  The poster can be overlooked because it's underneath. So I've added another picture with more exposure    [ "
348,How does a Philosopher's Stone work?,"The Philosopher's Stone is said to be an alchemical amplifier, allowing an alchemist to perform perfect transmutations, bypassing the laws of equivalent exchange.  How does that work? Isn't the point of alchemy that you can only get as much as you give? "
349,"Why does Uosuke say ""Tai"" at the end of every sentence?","In Fairy Tail 2014, Uosuke is a member of the Garou Knights, the most powerful executioners of Fiore (per the Fairy Tail Wikia). Apart from the fact that he loves fish or has a strange obsession with fish, is there any other particular reason why he says ""Tai"" at the end of every sentence.  I have a feeling that tai could be inferring/referring to fish tails (per his obssession/love for fish). Are there any other reasons as to why he adds ""Tai"" at the end of every sentence? If not, is it just for entertainment purposes? E.g. to be funny? "
350,Did Kurama become a whole after the last war?,"Did Kurama get his half from Minato and become a whole after the war? Thus, in Boruto, is Kurama composed of yin and yang already? "
351,Can mystic Gohan hold his own against Goku Super Saiyan Blue?,"In the week prior to episode 90th, where Gohan was going to have a training fight against Goku in Super Saiyan Blue, a japanese magazine gave an advancement saying this was going to happen and that mystic Gohan was going to be able to hold his own against Super Saiyan Blue Goku. But in episode 90th what we've seen..      it's Gohan having an even match with Goku in base form. Later Gohan having an even match against Goku in SSJ2. Later a very brief fight between mystic Gohan vs Goku Super Saiyan Blue and finally Goku defeating Gohan using Super Saiyan Blue Kaioken.    Therefore, can it be said mystic Gohan can hold his own against Goku Super Saiyan Blue ? is he even or is he weaker? "
352,Why is Naruto hated in the beginning?,Why is Naruto hated so much when the village had so many Jinchurikis in the past? Didn't they know the risks of having a tailed beast so close by? 
353,Why does Hanekawa know about Black Hanekawa?,"In the end of Nekomonogatari (Kuro), Araragi states that Hanekawa doesn't remember any of the events of Golden Week. (This is also shown in the corresponding recap episode in Monogatari Series Second Season.) However, in the Monogatari Series Second Season, during the Tsubasa Tiger arc, Hanekawa seems to know of the existence of Black Hanekawa:   In the voice-over in the first episode, she makes some allusions to having been a cat. (I don't remember what exactly she said, but I can dig that up later if I have time. In episode 4 she comes to the conclusion that she must have been possessed by Black Hanekawa after noticing dirt in her nails (and moreover comments that this time, there were no warning headaches).   When does Hanekawa realise that she had been possessed by Black Hanekawa? Does this have anything to do with the episode prior to the school festival (not in the sense that this was actually an episode of the anime, but in that this was an instance of her being possessed) that was alluded to once or twice? "
354,Is The Analysis of Happiness in Episode 22 of NHK ni Youkoso Related to Real Study?,"In Ep 22, an analysis is mentioned by Nakahara, saying that we have 10% happy moments in our life, and other 90% is in misery. Is this related to a real psychological study? If so, how can I find the related work, any reference?  The scene at 18:20 in Ep22   "
355,Why not re-indoctrinate the entire Squad 13?,"After Squad 13's failed attempt at a wedding, only the bride and groom are sent for re-indoctrination wiping out the relevant memories. But why stop there? Why didn't APE wipe the memory of every single member?   Everyone supported the wedding, and it probably served as a precedent to more relationships. Obviously this makes the squad doubt Papa's benevolence, which compromises APE's plans. Naturally everyone will try to restore the lost memories, which more or less works as they easily convince them that their relationship was real.   My only guess is that if they wipe everyone's memories they end up with a team full of strangers who won't perform as well as before, although that doesn't seem to be explicitly mentioned. "
356,Why did they break their cups after a toast?,"In episode 17 when they're about to welcome Satsuki's mother, they're having a toast and slam their cups to the ground. Why did they do it? Does this have anything to do with Japanese culture?   "
357,What are the major differences between the anime/manga and the live action version of Perfect Girl Evolution?,"I really loved the live-action version of Yamato Nadeshiko Shichi na Henge! (or, Perfect Girl Evolution! / The Wallflower) and I'm considering picking up the manga or anime because of how much I liked it. However, I'm curious: what are the major changes that the live-action made?  I know one of these changes is aging up the characters; the cast is about college-aged in the live-action, but they're in high school (they attend a gakuen) in the manga. I also know that the landlady's son is a live-action only character. Are there other big differences between the two? "
358,What is C's World?,"So throughout my viewing of Code Geass (both seasons) I was under the impression that the people shown here were an alien or ancient civilization that lived on Jupiter and were the source of the Geass powers that had been passed down to certain people on Earth.  Now I went to the wiki and started to read all these things about C's World and collective unconsciousness and the crazy plan by Charles and Marianne, which I previously assumed was just a plan to make everyone obey and have no free will.  What is the collective unconsciousness (I read Jung and it doesn't seem to relate)? I'm really interested in what that all means and what does this have to do with people's souls and the Code Geass universe's take on life after death and the like.  I don't really understand any of this, somehow I slept through it all.  Also, what was the guarantee that it would succeed? Is the World of C a product of an ancient civilization or is it a mechanism of the Code Geass universe?  So can anyone fill me in?  Any official writings about this or explanations? "
359,Who is this green guy?,While watching episode 114 (Erza vs Azuma) I noticed a little green (pig samurai?) guy in the background.  Any idea who or what this is?  (click for full size)  
360,What is the ID or account card in Quan Zhi Gao Shou?,"In almost every episode of Quan Zhi Gao Shou, you see the players inserting what looks like an ID card into a card reader of some kind. However, it appears it's more of an account card than an ID card. As far as I can tell, it's a Smart Card of some kind. I'm guessing it's a physical token used for account security. I know this anime is based on a game, is it related to how the game is actually played?   What is this card? Is it used for person/player identification, or just account authentication? Are card readers like this commonplace in Asia and/or China? Does this card control the account, or do you also have to use the account password? Are these account cards easily accessible, for example at the Asia-equivalent of Walmart?  In episode 2 or 3, we see the store owner's friend specially request her to provide an account, possibly indicating that they are hard to come by.  "
361,What measures does the police take to control villains with all sorts of quirks?,"After All For One pretty much blew up an entire district in his battle against All Might, one may question the police's ability to imprison him (who seems to be alive and led to some sort of iron maiden). On that note, there are probably other notoriously powerful villains with quirks that would make it easy for them to escape from prison.  What measures does the police take to control villains with all sorts of quirks? Perhaps the iron maidens are capable of disabling them?  Another example is when they find Nomu. They just put some handcuffs on him. Hell, the only reason Nomu didn't escape is because it was in a docile state. "
362,"Is Eren's Titan in ""rage/flame"" mode stronger?","In episode 25, when Eren is fighting Annie, he is seen in what is called ""rage/flame"" mode (this name is given by fans I believe, though not sure).    Is he supposed to be stronger when he's like that? "
363,How many continuities are there in Dragon Ball?,"The new movie is going to retcon the old Broly movies. This made me think how many continuities do we have in Dragon Ball.   The old anime series and/or manga were one (or two?) The old movies Dragon Ball GT Dragon Ball Heroes. How many continuities do we have in this set? There are 2 mangas written by different persons and one anime. is it 1,2 or 3? Battle of Gods and Resurrection of F. They are different than the anime and manga versions. Dragon Ball Super anime is different than the Dragon Ball Super manga. Super Saiyan Blue Kaioken, Super Saiyan Rage, Ultra Instinct Omen and Super Saiyan Blue Evolution exists in the anime but not in the manga.  And what about the new movie? Does it fit with the anime continuity, with the manga continuity or it's a new continuity? What about the spinoffs? (Jaco, Yamcha manga, etc.) What about the Tv specials?    To know which stories are independent of the others is important to understand any Dragon Ball story.  Therefore my question is, How many continuities are there in Dragon Ball? "
364,What is the release pace for English dub of Black Clover?,"I've looked up on the internet for an air date of the dubbed version for episode 45-48 of Black Clover, but didn't see any.  When will they come, or are there no more coming out in the dub? Or, is there a known release pace for the English dub? "
365,How can Aoshi Shinimori walk/run/fight when he got shot in both legs?,"In the fight with Kanryu Takeda, Aoshi Shinimori gets shot in both legs, in what appears to be above the kneecaps. Yet come a few months later, he is able to fight perfectly fine in the Kyoto arc, despite these injuries. Does Nobuhiro Watsuki ever explain this at all? Or is it different in the manga in some way, where he doesn't get as grevious of injuries? I'm looking for either an official explanation by the author or by the source.  TLDR: How can Aoshi Shinimori walk/fight with gunshot wound injuries? "
366,Do all of Grisaia's Mihama girls suffer from PTSD?,"The cast of heroines of the Grisaia no Kajitsu visual novel / anime series are some of the most deranged of the last decade.  Do all of them suffer from some sort of PTSD?  They surely have reasons to:  Amane:      Surviving the bus crash, starvation, the death of classmates, the cannibal circle and the guilty for her best friend's sacrifice. Not to mention crawling for weeks eating bugs and leeches before reaching civilization.   Makina:      Tied up in front of her dead father's decomposing body for days.    Michiru:      Best friend committed suicide in front of her.   Sachi:      Getting her parents killed by a runaway truck because she was a bad girl.   Yumiko:      Rejected by family. Watching her mother mentally decay in front of her. Being treated as less than a person by her father.   Bonus: Chizuru:      The kidnapping?   "
367,Where do the scenes in the Dragonball Z English OP come from?,In the English Opening of Dragonball Z (Rock the Dragon) i recall reading that this scene of Krillin running came from either The Tree of Might or The World's Strongest movies when at first i thought that all the scenes were either original scenes or clips from episodes  So i am wondering what Scenes in the Rock the Dragon Opening are from what movies/episodes and what were originally made and were never seen in a movie or episode 
368,Has the anime for To Love-Ru caught up with the manga?,"I see there are 7 anime series including OVAs and I was wondering if the anime and manga are aligned perfectly.  What I mean is, did the anime end before the manga and do I have to continue with the manga after the series? If I have to continue, which chapter do I start at? And has the manga finished? "
369,What are the differences between the manga and the anime adaptation of Erased and where does the anime diverge?,"As stated in the title, I want to know what the major differences between the manga and the anime adaptation are. From what I've read online, the anime adaptation diverged from the manga. So where does this diversion occur? Does it start from a particular chapter of the manga or has it been taking its own course gradually from the very beginning?  "
370,Who do Kiba and Tenten marry?,Who does Kiba marry?    Who does Tenten marry?  I've searched so many times and I'm still confused about this. 
371,Will there be a season 4 of High School DxD anime?,Will there be a season 4 of anime? Will it come out in 2017?  I am a big fan of the anime. I want to know how it ends. Did he become the Harem King? Should I just read the novels? 
372,Why do characters repeatedly say other characters names?,"I'm watching Blood C, and I'm reminded that in anime, dialog can often consist of characters just saying other character's names.  In this example, most of Tadayoshi Kisaragi's lines towards Saya are just her name.  If I recall, there was a similar situation in Blood+.  This is also epitomized by Mocha and Tskune in this scene.  Is this an anime thing, a Japanese thing, or a more common trope of some kind?  Western live action media doesn't contain this phenomeon, so I think it's an anime or a Japanese thing.  I'd hazard a guess that this is the voice acting equivalent to non-sakuga animation (sakuga explained by Gigguk) mean to fill dialog cheaply. "
373,What are the stats in DanMachi?,"The following is a screenshot of Ais Wallenstein's stats taken from DanMachi Gaiden Sword Oratoria Ep. 2.  From top to bottom we get  Ais Wallenstein  Lv 5  Str 549 -> 555  Vit 540 -> 547  Dex 823 -> 825  Agi 821 -> 822  But what is the last stat (the one with the value of 899)? What stat is that?  While at it, what does flipped V and that rotated Omega sign means? Considering that the same symbol is used in her name, the flipped V must be A, which I believe is her stat's rank. But what about the other one? "
374,What was wrong with Presea Testarossa?,"During the original series of Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha, on occasion when Presea Testarossa was alone she would cough up blood with more being coughed up as time went on apparently getting weaker as well. She also commented that she was running out of time to collect the Jewel Seeds to reach Al-Hazard leading her having to push forward with her plans before getting all the Jewel Seeds.  In the movies it's revealed that Alicia died from a prototype energy generator meltdown that Presea was developing so at first i thought that she was suffering from injuries from the accident she survived however the accident was in in 0039 and the Jewel Seed Incident was in 0065 so Presea had been alive for 26 years so she would have recovered by then.  So i am wondering, what was wrong with Presea? also when she said she was running out of time, was she referring to her own life running out or Alicia's preserved state? "
375,"What does this symbol that looks like a stylized ""P"" mean in each of Hajime no Ippo's matches?","What does the symbol resembling a stylized ""P"" in each of Hajime no Ippo's matches mean? Is it a Japanese symbol for cheering maybe?   "
376,How can Madara summon Kurama?,"According to the wiki trivia:     ""Among the tailed beasts, only Kurama has been shown to be subject to the Summoning Technique.""   But how can this possible? Controlling a tailed beast doesn't mean that it can be subject to Summoning Technique. Did Madara sign a contract (form of a scroll) with Kurama? "
377,Ryuuzetsu's Kekkei Genkai,"In the 5th Naruto Shippuden Movie ""Blood Prison"", the character Ryuuzetsu is introduced. The strange thing I noticed were that her eyes had the same appearance as those of the Rinnegan:    Is this the Rinnegan? If so, how did she acquire it and why can't she use any Rinnegan related techniques? If it isn't is it related to her clan Kekkei Genkai (or does she have 2 Kekkei Genkai's):   "
378,Is Akamaru a pet or a comrade?,"My question is if Akamaru is a pet or a comrade to Kiba. I'm wondering this because he fights alongside Kiba and Kiba treats him like he was another human being (most of the time), but at the same time he also treats him like a pet.  Examples and or clues that he's a pet:   Teaches him tricks Takes baths with him (not a lot of people do but a lot of little kids do) Calls him ""boy"" (Like, ""Here boy!"") He was given to Kiba at a very young age by Kiba's mother (something that happens a lot in real life) They lived together for (you could say) their whole life so they're like family (something that also happens in real life) They play together (something you will do with a friend or pet) Kiba cares a lot about Akamaru that he will do anything to protect him (something that a lot of people do for their pets)   The list goes on and on. I've been looking up stuff, but haven't found anything that says he's his pet. It only says he's his partner, comrade, friend, etc.  When I look up, ""Kiba and his pet"", then go to images, it shows (at least the first couple of pictures) Kiba and Akamaru.  So is Akamaru Kiba's pet or comrade? To better put it, is Akamaru a pet or a comrade to Kiba? "
379,Aren't Harutora and Natsume related?,"So in the end, Natsume and Harutora kissed. Isn't that weird? They are supposed to be cousins, right? Or was Natsume adopted? Which wouldn't explain her natural talent. "
380,What happens in the end of The Disappearance of Suzumiya Haruhi?,"I was watching The Disappearance of Suzumiya Haruhi, and the scene when Asakura attack Kyon is rather confusing. So this is what happens:     After Kyon has a mental struggle with himself, when he was about to shoot normal-Nagato with the device that android-Nagato gave to him, he suddenly got attacked by Asakura. She stabbed him twice, and when Asakura was about to kill him, suddenly Nagato (perhaps the android one?) saved him. And when he was about to lose consciousness, young and old Asahina come. And then someone (perhaps future Kyon?) comes. After that he loses consciousness.      Later, he woke up at the hospital with Koizumi. And when Kyon asked what happen, he said he fell down the stairs at school. But Kyon seems to know what really happened before.   If I have to guess, this is what I think happened:     After Kyon recovers from his injury, he, Asahina, and android-Nagato travel back to the past, and save the past Kyon after he got stabbed, and Nagato alters some memories about the incident so Koizumi didn't know anything about it, and they travel back to the current time.   If that's what happened, why he didn't save himself back then before he got stabbed? What's the point of giving an antidote for Nagato to Kyon? And why did Nagato give false memories about the incident to Koizumi? What exactly happened here? "
381,What is the meaning of Eternal Feather's braid writing Jesús Navas?,"In episode 08 of Soul Eater! Not:      Eternal Feather is hospitalized and Stein createds a clone of her to mess with the girls. Her braid comes to life...   and leaves a message on the bedsheets:    Jesús Navas seems to be a soccer player for Manchester City. I don't follow football myself, but he doesn't seem to be particularly of note or any influence on Japanese pop culture.   Is this the person Soul Eater! Not is referring to? Why is it relevant? "
382,Do we know Kyon's real name?,I was just re-watching the anime and it seems like Kyon is only a nickname. Are we ever told what his real name is? Maybe from the light novel? And how come Kyon has such a nickname? Does it have any meaning? 
383,Why does Shinnosuke ask people if they like peppers?,"I sometimes watch this anime called Crayon Shin-chan in Portuguese (in which it is simply called Shin-chan). Flirty as he is, Shinnosuke (its main character) is often inconveniently messing around with women. Sometimes he walks up to them and, as if to break the ice, asks them ""Do you like peppers?"". After this either the women get very embarrassed or his mother knocks him in the head (or both). Also, in one opening theme he sings that ""pepper tastes so bad"".  Is this something specific to the Portuguese version of the anime? Is its only significance related to his childishness (him being a five-year-old child)? Or is it supposed to mean anything other than that (and makes more sense in Japanese)? "
384,How many titan shifters can harden their skin?,"I've just watched the anime series and in it, we've just seen the female titan and the armored titan being able to harden their skin. But reading in the internet I've found that      In the manga Eren can harden his skin and so does the Beast Titan   is there any other titan shifters who can harden their skin? How many titan shifters can harden their skin? "
385,How do LN publishers assign the illustrator for a light novel?,"It all begins when my friend asked me, ""Would Saekano be as popular if the illustrator weren't Misaki Kurehito?""  As we may have known, a light novel's illustrations are the main 'bait' to catch the attention of new buyers, but I still haven't figured out how those LN publishers usually assign the illustrator to work on a light novel.  Thus my question:  How do LN publishers assign the illustrator for a light novel? "
386,Has Boruto the anime caught up with the manga?,"Did the Boruto anime catch up with the manga? If it did, can you tell me from which episode should I start watching Boruto? "
387,Shisui's Mangekyo Sharingan Recharge Period,"According to Narutopedia for Shisui's MS ability Kotoamatsukami...     Itachi noted that the dōjutsu required at least a decade before it could be used again.   Does this limitation apply to Shisui, or does it just apply to those that took his eyes (Danzo and Itachi)? Because if this applied to him, then he's not as OP as everyone thinks he is. Plus how would he know it has a recharge period of 10 years? "
388,What's the name of the first ending and second opening song of Hu Yao Xiao Hong Niang (Fox Spirit Matchmaker)?,"Unfortunately, this ""anime"" is from China and there're no subtitles for the information shown during the openings and endings. I've already searched a lot on google to find any traces, but I didn't succeed.  Does anybody know the name of the first ending and second opening song?   Here's the link (it redirects you to a YouTube video) for the ending song starting at 13:01 and second opening song starting at 1:56.  Edit: the video on YouTube seems to have been removed. "
389,"What is the origin of the trope where a person says ""I can't eat anymore"" 「もう食べられないよ…」 in their sleep?","When we have scene showing a person (or many people) sleeping soundly, it's quite common to have one of them saying ""I can't eat anymore"" 「もう食べられないよ…」 in their sleep.  According to this forum thread on ANN, this trope has been observed in:   Cowboy Bebop (by Edward) Air in Summer (by Kanna) Inu-Yasha (by Shippo) Super Milk Chan (by Milk-Chan) CardCaptor Sakura (by Kero, also inverts the joke in one instance) Sailor Moon (by Usagi) Full Metal Panic? Fumoffu (by Tessa) Gokujou Seitokai (by Randou Rino, in episode 24)   Since the forum thread above is from 2006, the examples are quite old. Below are some recent examples:   Brynhildr in the Darkness (by Kotori)   Thanks to Pawl Rowe for providing the example above  (Feel free to edit in more examples and images showing this trope, preferably from recent series).  What is the origin of this trope? "
390,Is that jutsu really the Edo Tensei?,"I know the title probably needs to be changed, but I wasn't sure how to put it spoiler-free. The question follows as a block, for its 'spoilery' nature for anyone who hasn't seen Naruto Shippuden up to episode 290.      In this episode Kabuto summons several shinobi using Edo Tensei. For this jutsu we know that a living body to act as receptacle and a piece of DNA from the one being revived are needed. The summoner will then use a tag to control the summoned soul's personality.  Kabuto explains to Naruto and Sakura that the water in the ""Hole"" is so rich that he was able to create life with those weird snakes embedded with Orochimaru's chakra. I assume this means that the body that comes out of the water is the living body that serves as sacrifice. I assume this because Hidan's eyes look like those of the ones summoned by Edo Tensei. And afterwards Kabuto inserts a tag in this Hidan, to control his personality.  Considering that Hidan was really summoned by Edo Tensei, however, there is the fact that his body does not look 'complete'. But then again, I don't think we've ever seen a naked Edo Tensei summoned body, so we cannot be sure if this is normal or not.   So basically:  Is this some weird jutsu that really looks like Edo Tensei?  Or should we assume that Hidan as died and this was really Edo Tensei? (It is possible that Hidan is dead, if you take into consideration what is explained in this answer)  "
391,Is the ending of the anime and manga the same (ERASED),"I was wondering, is the anime ending and the manga ending the same for Boku dake ga Inai Machi? Or is there going to be a sequel for the anime version? "

And the only way is to transplant a set of new eyes from a close Uchiha into them and gains Eternal Mangekyo.   *So, I'm wondering if the new set of eyes isn't from Uchiha bloodline. I mean , a normal person without kekkei genkai? What would happen then? * "
394,Where can I find the transcripts of anime episodes online?,"I am looking around the internet for the transcripts for anime series and their episodes but cannot find one in particular for Attack on Titans.  I was searching around the internet for a while and couldn't find some sites. Does anyone know a website that does/contains the transcripts for anime series and their episodes? If not, I would like specifically a site for Attack on Titans episodes.  This would be useful I think for example you are answering a question and would like to add a certain spoken scene from an anime episode, and instead of watching the entire episode or skipping to that scene and playing and pausing the scene over and over again just to type out what they are saying, you can simply just have a look at the transcript and copy and paste it.  I know I might be lazy, but I think it would be extremely helpful. Anyone know any sites? "
395,How did Satoru obtain the Revival ability?,"Satoru Fujinuma has the ""Revival"" ability, which allows him to go back in time before a life-threatening incident happens. We do know that he is not able to control this power (even if he can somehow help to summon it sometimes), but do we learn at any point how he obtained it ? Or did the author mention anything about this ? "
396,What is the complete story of King Artoria in Fate?,"The story of King Artoria differs from the real world story of King Arthur, although even the latter have a lot of variations. In the Fate series, there are bits and pieces of Artoria's life being revealed in each iteration of the game. But is there a complete story of the King Arthur story in Fate from beginning to end? Is her story even interconnected in each of the Fate works? "
397,Is there any way to kill Alucard?,"I'm pretty sure that people have tried every way possible to try it, but still he remained alive and kicking.    In Hellsing Ultimate: Episode 2, when Luke Valentine says he will prove that Alucard's immortality is a myth, Alucard replies that there is no such thing as immortality.  I did not really understand whether there are any limits to his so-called immortality, or maybe nobody knew whether there were any? Is there a way to permanently 'kill' Alucard? "
398,Are there races other than human?,"In Boku no Hero Academia, there are many people who have a special appearance, different from a human appearance, like Tokoyami for example.   Is this something normal in the world of My Hero Academia where someone can have a different appearance caused by their quirks? Or is it more like in Dragon Ball where there are many races that if someone isn't human, other people see it as okay? "
399,What happens if one dies in Soul Society?,"In Bleach, Soul Society represents this sort of Heaven where souls are sent by Shinigamis (mostly from Earth?). However, once in Soul Society, is a soul immortal? Can they die? And if so, what happens? Is one sent to... Hueco Mundo? "

401,How can I get The Irregular at Magic High School's English-translated novel?,"I have just finished the anime version of The Irregular at Magic High School and I would really like to read the light novel. I've been trying to find a legal way to do that but to no avail.   I've tried to search for the books in Amazon but typing ""Irregular at Magic High School"" into the search box didn't really give much (it only shows Volume 1 and Volume 2 of the light novel series but I think it has until Volume 17 now). A simple Google search only resulted in (I assume) unofficial (or illegal) translation of the original Japanese light novel series e.g. its Wikia page.  I am also having a hard time finding updates of translated materials for the light novel i.e. as in which volumes have been translated and which have not. MAL is the only source that I found useful for anime-related stuff, but it doesn't have much info on light novels.  To all masters of anime out there, is there an official site that allows newcomer like me to check about the official English translation updates of Japanese light novel series (especially the novel in this question)? Or is there a website out there that can direct me to the correct place to purchase the book? Thanks! "

404,Boss Battles in Sword Art Online,Why were many stages and levels skipped in Sword Art Online.  You see that they start at level one in the first episode but then later they skip to higher levels.    Why did the makers skip levels?  Was it because it would take too long?

406,What does the water in the hallway represent in the Erased opening?,"Most of the shots in Erased its opening are references to events events or cryptic imagery like when Satoru's refers to himself as Grim Reaper that tries to put things back the way they were, but the more he acts the more other people involved suffer (see the last bit in episode 6).    However at around 37 seconds into the opening this shot of a large amount of water in the school shows up. I don't remember this happening in the anime.    What is the meaning of this shot? Does it bear a cryptic message to something in the show? "
407,Why didn't Asuna die in real life when she died in the game?,"Asuna died near the end of Sword Art Online. However, judging by the rules, why didn't she die in real life? Did Kayaba Akihiko lie about dying in the game? "
408,What are Holo's roots in Japanese tradition?,"The rich background of Holo: being a minor deity of harvest, her forms, shapeshifting, powers and limitations, likes and dislikes, traits character etc - how is it grounded in Japanese beliefs, myths, traditions, and legends?  Is her lore entirely made-up for the needs of the show; did the authors take strong artistic license on some more or less common legends; or is she shaped closely after a character well known in Japanese culture?  If it's one of the latter, could you give some sources or summaries of the original upon which she is based? "
409,How much of the Citrus manga got adapted in the anime?,"The Citrus anime came out at the start of 2018. However, the manga finished in August 2018.  Since the anime would have been in production for a while, we can't just assume that whatever chapter was released in December 2017 is what got into the anime.  So how much of the manga got adapted in the anime? "
410,What is the symbol on Gaara's gourd?,"Gaara has a symbol that reads ""WMW"" on his Sand gourd. What does this symbol mean? Is it kanji or just some random symbol?   "
411,"Is the Manias version of ""Sanki Tousen"" available as a single?","Question  Has the Manias version of ""Sanki Tousen"" been made available for sale, or, alternatively, is there an announcement that it will not be made available for sale? It is, notably, not part of ""Akiba's Collection"", unlike all the other EDs.  Background context  So, in Akiba's Trip: The Animation, there are these three characters, Mayonaka Matome, Denkigai Niwaka, and Arisa Ahokainen. Within the show, they form an idol unit called ""Manias"".   These three characters are voiced, respectively, by TAKAHASHI Rie, KOUNO Marika, and NAGAKU Yuki. In real life, they constitute an idol unit called ""Earphones"".   The ""trademark"" song of the Manias, so to speak, is a song titled ""Sanki Tousen"" (サンキトウセン). They perform this song as an insert in episode 3 and again in episode 11. ""Sanki Tousen"" performed by Manias is the ED for episode 4.  Separately, Earphones (the real-life idol unit) performs this same song as the ED for episode 3. The Earphones version of ""Sanki Tousen"" is track #3 on the album ""Akiba's Collection"".  You might be sitting there wondering why I'm asking this question, given that I've just pointed out that Manias and Earphones consist of exactly the same people. What difference could there possibly be between the two versions of the song?   Well, it turns out that the Manias version is discernibly sung in-character, while the Earphones version isn't. This is easiest to detect with Nagaku Yuki, whose character voice (Arisa) differs most significantly from her regular singing voice. A careful comparison of the two versions of the Arisa solo verse that begins ""seseragi"" will make it clear that the two versions are subtly different. "
412,Does Hiei transform into his Jaganshi form more than once in the anime?,"In the anime, before The Beasts of Maze Castle arc, when Hiei and Yusuke fight for the first time, he had a transformation called the Jaganshi form which increased his speed and power.   The only other time we see this form is in the movie Poltergeist Report.   In all the other fights (excluding The Beasts of Maze Castle, because he wasn't even breaking a sweat there): The Dark Tournament, The Chapter Black, The Demon World Tournament, he never used it again.  Is there a canonical reason for this? Or was it just forgotten about? "
413,Who stole my candy?,"This question may not have a current answer but I want to be sure that I am not missing critical detail.   In chapter 129 of Kuroshitsuji on page 13 there is an eerie message etched into a wall that reads,     Who stole the candy from my tummy?   It is attached below with appropriate spoiler tags for anyone who hasn't read it yet.   Further in the chapter it is foreshadowed that Ciel has had some interaction with the persons who attacked the manor. However I do not recall who this is referencing or what arc.  Does anyone know? Or should I just wait for the future chapters?         "

415,Who cursed the Devil Fruits?,"One Piece is near in reaching 1000 episodes, but never in a single episode where the origin of the so called Devil Fruits is elaborated. Is there any creator of the Devil Fruits or their existence are merely phenomenal?  I remember one episode when Blackbeard killed one of his comrades just to gain the Dark-Dark fruit, he was sure that based on its appearance, it was definitely the Yami Yami no Mi because he read it in the book about the cursed fruits.  How was the book written, does it imply that the author of the book is also the one who cursed the Devil Fruits?  "
416,Can you explain the ending to Ousama Game?,"I have a few questions about the ending of Ousama Game:      Doesn't Chiemi have a twin sister?  How does her existence play into the ending of this manga?    If his wish is to have Chiemi back, then won't the twin sisters existence come into play?  What about Chiemi's Father? He was the sole survivor of the 1st Ousama Game too!  "
417,What constitutes as an Yin/Yang/Yinyang element technique?,"As we know, the Naruto ""Table of the elements"" consists of more than just the basic 5.  In addition to all of the combination elements, (Wood, Ice, etc), we also have the three rather bizarre Yin, Yang, and YinYang elements.  What are they? What can they do? Tobi explained that mastery over these elements allows one to basically become God, completely erasing the boundary between dream and reality. However, is that all there is to it?  The Second Mizukage states that genjutsu is basically Yin element, what does that make the Yang element?  Also, what is the YinYang element? Is ""God"" the only jutsu there?  What about elementless jutsus like Shadow Clone, do they constitute as either of the three? "
418,"Does the AUG | Akihabara Accept come from an anime? If so, which one?","  In Counter-Strike: Global Offensive a new skin was released called the Akihabara Accept. The description of the skin is:      Powerful and accurate, the AUG scoped assault rifle compensates for   its long reload times with low spread and a high rate of fire. It has   been decorated with a heat transfer vinyl of an anime magazine cover.   So I'm curious, does this actually come from a real anime magazine cover? Or is this just some custom in-house work by Valve?  On the girl on the butt end of the gun the words ""Fazik"" are labelled on her uniform; perhaps it's part of the artist or something?    Here's an imgur album with closeups of the skin in question. "

420,What would happen to a Menos or an Arrancar killed with a Zanpakuto?,"It was said that a Hollow killed with a Zanpakuto is cleansed of all of his post-mortem sins, and is sent to soul society (unless he had committed sins in his lifetime, then he goes to Hell).  What would then when a Menos, which easily contains hundreds if not thousands of souls, is killed with a Zanpakuto?  Would all of the souls be released? Or perhaps the souls fused into one? If so, does that mean that Ulqiorra is somewhere in Soul Society right now?  Is such a thing explained anywhere?  "
421,Who did the Spinning Wheel song in the English dub of the Garo Season 1 OVA?,"There's ""Spinning Wheel"" (YouTube link) song sung near the end of the Garo Season 1 OVA. Who sung it?  My guess is Saxton/Rial, but I can't find any answer. "
422,What is the origin of the bubble during sleep trope?,"A common trope across various anime and manga is the snot bubble trope.

Does anybody know where it was first used, or where the inspiration came from? "
423,Why did Near start to suspect the presence of a second Death Note?,At what point and why did Near start to suspect the presence of a second Death Note? How and why did he consider that Mikami used a faked one? 
424,Why is King Arthur female? Why is Iskander tall?,"I've watched both the Fate/Zero and Fate/Stay Night anime (including the Unlimited Blade Works movie), but none of the visual novels, so no spoilers from that unless they are light spoilers. One thing that bothered me was that despite the fact that heroic spirits are defined by the public opinion/view of them, some heroes had qualities that were in direct opposition of what the public thought.  We know that heroic spirits, being sealed on their Throne of Heroes, are meant to be completely unchanged. This is the entire point of the Throne of Heroes. But this seems to be in opposition of the previous fact that heroic spirits are defined by what others think they are. Then there are Counter Guardians who are completely different, I believe, in that they are not sealed on their Throne of Heroes.  One particularly important Counter Guardian of the series is Arturia, or Saber. Arturia is female, despite the fact that she was treated by even her contemporaries as male, and has gone done in history as male. In fact, there isn't even any small hint as to Arturia's gender being anything other than male in our history, or the history of the Nasuverse (I believe). This being true, shouldn't Arturia be male?  This not being the case shouldn't Arturia be erased, or else create instability in the World? Same with Iskander. In history he is known for being pretty short, even for a Macedonian. That he is very tall means there is an incongruity with human knowledge and true fact.  Furthermore, in the Unlimited Blade Works movie Archer is revealed to be Heroic Spirit Emiya. If Heroic Spirit Emiya is summoned before he is even a hero, or acquired his gift from the World, etc., then how is it that Heroic Spirit Emiya is even strong at all? The power of a Servant being based on their popularity at the time of their summoning, Emiya should be weaker than pretty much every other Servant, and then some.  Maybe I'm just over-analyzing things, or I have some misconception. In any case, answers are appreciated. "
425,What are the Four Noble Families of Soul Society?,"What are the names of the main Four Families that live in Soul Society?  Is there any information on how they came to be? Or how they became such? And do each of these clans commonly exceeds at a particular area (like the Shihōin clan were usually the heads of the Correction Corps, and experts at Kidō and Shunpo)?  "
426,Why is the series named this way?,I've been watching the anime since yesterday and couldn't help but wonder why it was called Gokukoku no Brynhildr or Brynhildr in the Darkness. So far I have yet to see any mention of Brynhildr; is this some person later on in the story? Or another name for the protagonist? 
427,How could Aang stay alive for 100 years?,"Is there any clear description as to how Aang survived for 100 years inside of the iceberg?  Can Avatars do that? If they can, then why didn't the other Avatars stay alive for long time periods? And whatever was the case, how did Aapa stay alive too? "
428,Which novels does The Sky Crawlers movie adapt?,"According to the Wikipedia, The Sky Crawlers series consists of 6 books, and one of them is titled The Sky Crawlers itself:        The Sky Crawlers (スカイ·クロラ)   None But Air (ナ·バ·テア)   Down to Heaven (ダウン·ツ·ヘヴン)   Flutter into Life (フラッタ·リンツ·ライフ)   Cradle the Sky (クレィドゥ·ザ·スカイ)   Sky Eclipse (スカイ·イクリプス)      There's also an animated movie with the same name, which is said to adapt the novel, but which novel?

Or somebody else did it? Have they performed the dance in the live show at a concert too?  "
430,Has the new Gundam series copied Aldnoah Zero?,"A lot of people (including me) have noted a lot of similarities between Aldnoah.Zero (AZ) and Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans (Gundam).    Mars vs Earth conflict (albeit different sides &mdash; AZ is Earth trying to be liberated from Mars while Gundam is Mars seeking liberation from Earth). The mechs from Mars, while using older technology, are more advanced than the Earth mechs The main characters both end up losing their sight in one eye in the respective 1st season finales (Inaho gets his eye shot out, Mikazuki loses his sight and use of the right arm due to overusing the Gundam Barbatos (and can only regain function while connected to the Gundam). Both have blonde haired political princesses as potential love interests in Season 1 (Elysium in AZ, Kudelia in Gundam).   Is this more than coincidence? Do we know if Gundam took these elements from Aldnoah.Zero? "
431,Is Fullmetal Alchemist based on Nazi Germany?,"It may be because I'm Jewish (yes, Madara is Jewish), but I couldn't help but noticing the similarities between Fullmetal Alchemist to the German Nazi regime.   German names (Edward, Alphonse, Olivier, Bradley) A Fuhrer ""Dogs of the Army"" Very militarized The blond hair, blue eyes meme Extermination (Ishvals) War on multiple fronts Human experimentation An obsession with the occult among high ranking officials   Is it just me?

432,Are there any differences between the movie adaptation and the novel of The Sky Crawlers?,"Wikipedia mentions that the The Sky Crawlers movie is an adaptation of the novel. While the article tells the story in detail (if not overly detail for Wikipedia), the article on the novel doesn't have any summary for each novel.  Does the movie faithfully adapt the novel? Are there any differences between the movie adaptation and the novel? "
433,Appearance of Ruby's Mother,"I just finished the latest volume of RWBY. I didn't get a clue about Ruby's Mom, but I'm still curious though.  Yang succeeds in finding her mother which is Raven Branwen and I'm already satisfied with the answer because Yang got her picture. But I'm dissatisfied with Ruby's mother which is in the white robe.    What about her weapon? Her semblance? Her appearance? Can we determine who Ruby's mother is from these?  "
434,Why does Kirei want Rin's heart?,"In episode 20 of UBW (or episode 8, UBW 2nd season), Kirei announced that he would take Rin's heart. I suppose that he wanted to use it as some sort of vessel for the grail.  But what about Illya's heart that Gilgamesh had taken earlier? Why did he take Rin's if he already had Illya's, which I guess is better?  Perhaps he was not allied with Gilgamesh anymore? Or perhaps, he just wanted to kill Rin for the laughs and giggles? "
435,Is Haku a man or a woman?,"In Naruto, Haku is a rogue Ninja that fights along Zabuza. He has a sad history of death and mistreatment that I won't treat here.  In any case, the Haku's peculiarity is that although he looks/behaves/dresses like a woman, he is a man. But not all sources agree with this, so... Is Haku a man or a woman?   Is there a reason for the first part in my spoiler? Or is it just a plot device?  If your answer contains something that appears or is explained after the Bridge battle with Team 7 (as far as Haku is concerned), please use a spoiler.  "
436,Did Fairy Tail go on hiatus again after episode 277 (or episode 102 after the 2014 restart)?,"After episode 277 (counting from the 2014 restart, around episode 102), there are no listed episodes in list of Fairy Tail episodes on Wikipedia. It's due to have some new OVA as well, but the anime did not give a clear indication like the last time that it is going to hiatus.  My questions are:   Is it on hiatus right after episode 277 (counting from 2014, episode 102)? Did Hiro Mashima gave some indication (like last time) that it will be back and when it will be back?  "
437,Did Goku use kaioken in chapter #39 of the manga?,"So I'm reading a translated version of the manga and it has this dialogue from the characters   Beerus : Look! Goku's power just shot up.

Krilin: The kaioken? Now, after all this time? will it even work?   What does this dialogue mean? Did Goku use Kaioken or something similar? Does the drawed aura say something about if it's kaioken or not? was it like the aura of kaioken in the original Dragon Ball Z? "
438,"Which Melty Blood games are relevant, plotwise?","Shingetsutan Tsukihime is a pretty expansive work - a main visual novel, the Kagetsu Tohya supplement, and the Melty Blood games. The last bit, Melty Blood, is especially jarring to a Type-Moon fan who is late to the party - there are many versions, and the format itself is very different from what is normal for Nasu works: a fighting game.  What are the different versions, and how do they differ? What should be played and what skipped, and in what order, if one is playing for the story aspect? "
439,Manga Spoilers: Control over Rod Reiss,"I'm not sure in which chapter this took place exactly but       this is after Rod Reiss transformed into a titan. Eren has the ability control titans, then why wasn't Eren able to control him with his titan power? He had Historia by his side who possesses royal blood. That doesn't make sense...   Why couldn't Rod Reiss be controlled? "
440,What did Makie talk about with the worker in harbor?,I have a question about scene from 5th Episode of Aoki Hagane no Arpeggio Ars Nova anime TV series. (at about 1:20)  It was depicted that Osakabe Makie was talking with a harbor employee with an assistance of military soldier.  Chihaya Gunzou said to Iona when noticied her on monitor:     That girl... Do you remember her?   My question is: What was she doing there? and What was she talking about?  I assume that    All works on Vibration Warhead were done and they did not need any advises from her. She didn't yet realize that her guests were of Fog.  
441,Is there any relation between the two Mahou Tsukai ni Taisetsu na Koto series?,"In 2003, there was an anime called Mahou Tsukai ni Taisetsu na Koto. In 2008, there another anime called Mahou Tsukai ni Taisetsu na Koto: Natsu no Sora.  I only saw the 2008 one, so I don't really know much about the 2003 one. They both seem to be about young girls who are learning magic, but is there any actual relation between the two series? For example, are there any subtle hints indicating that the 2008 series takes place X years after the original series? Or are there any characters that appear in both series? Or is the only relation that they have similar stories?  (I had to use the English title for the tags since the Japanese title is too long...) "
442,What about Araragi's weight?,"At the end of Bakemonogatari episode 2, Araragi claimed his normal weight is supposed to be 55kgs, but on the weighing scale, it showed 100kgs. He then said something about the crab and the episode ended. There was no sign as to what happened to the weight difference in the entire series.  I've only watched Bakemonogatari, so is there an explanation or something in the later series? Or the anime has mistaken it or ignored the fact of Araragi overweight? "
443,How many times was the moon destroyed?,"In the original Dragon Ball series, Master Roshi (Kame-sennin) realizes that Goku turned into a rampaging ape due to the effects of the full moon, and comes up with a characteristically Dragon Ball solution&mdash;just blow the stupid thing up! After all, who needs it?  After this, the moon is restored by the Dragon Balls, if I recall correctly. Later, Piccolo blows it up again to stop Gohan's rampage during their training.    It's become sort of a stereotype of Dragon Ball that people are constantly blowing up the moon, and that sometimes when they do it, the moon has already been blown up and yet mysteriously reappears just to be blown up again. My question is, just how many times was the moon blown up? And how many of those instances were plot holes, if any?  This forum thread makes some unsourced claims about the answer to this question. I wasn't exactly filled with confidence in its accuracy, though.  Answers covering any of the available material (the manga, the Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z anime, the movies, and the Dragon Ball GT anime) are appreciated.  "
444,Is it possible to duplicate eyes?,"This question contains spoilers for anime viewers and early manga viewers.      When Nagato was revived with Edo Tensei, he had Madara's eyes. When Madara was revived, he had his original eyes too (Rinnegan, much like Nagato).   Is this exploitable? Can I repeat this cycle of transplant and revive to duplicate strong eyes? How does that work really? "
445,Why in World Trigger do the characters have times when their faces get blank during dialog?,  Why is it that the characters' faces do this at various points in the dialog and what is it meant to convey? I wonder if perhaps this is a Japanese culture or anime culture expression that I have not seen before? 
446,Why don't people utilize the Rinnegan to its fullest?,"This question contains spoilers for anime viewers and early manga readers.  We've seen Nagato use his Rinnegan to the fullest, using the Rikudo technique (to control 6 bodies)      As well as by fighting alone, as a reincarnated zombie.   He utilized all 6 paths of the Rinnegan.        So why don't Obito and Madara? Madara only used the Preta Path, to absorb incoming ninjutsu. Obito only tried to use the Human Path, to try and kill Naruto.   Why don't they use any other realms? Their Rinnegan is supposedly perfect. I can't imagine they're holding back on purpose, the Rinnegan has some pretty scary abilities. "
447,Oblivious life-threateningly terrible cooks?,"There are quite a few anime, manga, and JRPGs that have a character who, at one point, offers to (or in some cases has to) cook for the other characters and is often convinced they are at least decent. They end up poisoning the others by mistake. It's often played for laughs that this person is shockingly bad, but (often) completely unaware. Usually, this person is a woman or girl. It's mildly amusing,(citation needed) but it happens in so many stories, it seems any show going long enough needs to have this joke in it.  TV Tropes page with examples here.  What is it about this joke that it is so often repeated in manga and anime (and games, I guess)? Is there some cultural thing I'm missing making it funnier? (As a sub-question, why is it nearly always women?) "
448,How different are the manga and movie versions of Akira?,"After seeing the Akira movie (directed by Otomo Katsuhiro) I later found out about the existence of the manga series on which it had been based.    Is the movie adaptation faithful to the manga, with only minor variations? Or will I get a lot more detail from the story by reading the manga (and if so, just how much more)?    Basically, how different are the manga and movie versions of Akira? "
449,who are Stripism a parody of?,"One of the most popular anime shows in Akiba's Trip: Undead &amp; Undressed is Stripism. Here's a screenshot of them in-game (in their own game).    Knowing Akiba's Trip and its countless references, I can't think that this isn't a reference to some magical girl series. Unfortunately, I don't know enough magical girl series - and there isn't much info about the girls on the internet.  I'm somewhat inclined to think they're a parody of Pretty Cure because of their vibrant colour scheme, but it's got a load of different series so I'm not sure if they are or not.  At one stage the Akiba's Trip girls cosplay as the characters, so possibly some of that bare skin is fan service on AT's part:    Are the Stripism girls a parody of Pretty Cure? Or any other anime series? "
450,Are people aware of who Naruto's parents are?,"Every villager in Konoha is aware that Naruto has the Kyuubi sealed inside of him.    Is anyone in the village or elsewhere (other than Kakashi and Jiraiya, that I remember knew) aware that he is the son of Minato and Kushina? My main doubt being: do they know that he is the son of the Fourth Hokage? "
451,Is the last scene in The Last: Naruto the Movie the end of Naruto?,"At the end of The Last: Naruto the Movie, after Naruto and Hinata got married and Hinata gave birth to two kids, is that the end of Naruto? Will they create a sequel to the story? "
452,Why did Kurama choose to remain Human?,"Caution, contains spoilers.      In episode 108 when Kurama fought Shigure, he decided to remain human even though his powers are far more limited. He said he does not want his friends and mother to treat him differently. But when Yomi asked him at the end of the fight if he decided to abandon the form of Yoko for eternity, he said he never abandons anything.    Does this mean that he decided to never to transform into Yoko?  And if so, why does he have conflicting identities in the first place? Yoko is Kurama's original form.   Does he deny his past?  I know this is a bit of a complex question, but if possible, I want clarifications on everything I asked. "
453,Could you avoid to die due to the death note if you have no heart in your body?,"Death note states that if there's no other way a person would die due to a heart attack, but what if when you should die via the death note you have no heart? And no, that's not a silly question, there's a machine used for heart tranplant surgery called extracorporeal circulation system that acts as a sort of heart for the person in which the surgery is being performed on while it's done. So, technically speaking if your name where to be written you could not die due to a heart attack, unless that by heart we would also consider that machine, although this is a bit far fetched. Then if you get another heart or put yours back you have avoided the death note effect, and at this point it has failed to its own rules. From this point I'm not sure what would happen.  I don't think something like that was covered either in the anime or the manga, although I think it would have been an interesting concept to explore, as they could have experimented with that if they wished, but maybe the author explained how things would be like in a case like this one in an interview.  Is there any official explanation or any thing I missed that would give an answer to my question?  Thanks.  "
454,What references to psychology exist in Evangelion?,"I've noticed from time to time, references to psychology and psychoanalysis, for example the ironic Hedgehog's Dilemma, as well as the Human Instrumentality Project, which seems just a solution to a fundamental psychological human flaw. Even the last two episodes are a complete psychological de-construction of the main characters.  What another references, maybe even implied ones, exist in the Series? Why the focus, especially on psychoanalysis? "
455,Thematic or mood effects of shadow placement on a character's face?,"Not sure if this is on topic here as it's not a question about a specific manga... or even specifically about manga, but about comic books in general.  The use of shadow is important for conveying lots of different things... mood of a person, setting or simply for dramatic effect. I am wondering specifically, in a close up shot of a face in the classic 3/4 position, what is the difference if the face is in shadow in the foreground versus on the background side?  For this assume the only difference in the drawing is the placement of shadow, the position expression and amount or surface covered in shadow are the same. The only difference is shadow on the side facing the viewer versus the side away from the viewer.  Here is my poorly drawn example of what I am thinking in my head:    I tried to draw a neutral expression but they both kinda look upset... so try not to base the answer on the facial expression, just shadow placement.  What are the thematic/mood/emotional response differences to the audience when using those lighting patterns? "
456,What do we know about Ichigo's father?,"In the anime, Ichigo's father, Isshin, is shown to have captain level powers, but I think that it was never mentioned that he was a substitute shinigami. So where does he get his powers?  Also, why did he hide his powers (or why couldn't he use his powers) for 20 years?  And why did he hide the fact that he was a shinigami from his son? "
457,Did this really happen in Kuroko no Basket?,"I found this GIF on the internet, and I was kinda shocked. Does anyone know if this was really said in the anime? And if possible if you could tell me the season and episode? "
458,What is the difference between Tachikoma and Fuchikoma?,"What is the difference between Tachikoma and Fuchikoma? The Tachikoma's design was inspired by the Fuchikoma (stated here), but what are the differences between them? How is a Tachikoma different from a Fuchikoma? "
459,What happens to Ichika after the fated summer ends?,"In the final episode,      Ichika is shown at the end of the finished movie wearing the clothes Nanami brought from Bolivia, so it is inferred that she somehow returned to Earth after being abducted by the unmanned probes from the Federation search party.   So my question is not about this particular part of the ending.  Is there any official material (manga, OVA, ONA, etc.) that tells how it came to that ending?      How did she return to Earth?  "
460,What is the mon in Jin's kimono?,"In the anime Samurai Champloo, there is a character called Jin who is defined in the Samurai Champloo Wiki as:       (..) a spectacled man with messy black hair tied in a loose ponytail with two strands that frame his face. His attire consists of a simple blue kimono adorned with multiple symbols that are four squares in a diamond formation on the right pec, sleeves, and back of his kimono. Also wears a brown beaded bracelet on his right wrist.     These symbols are called mon, and his looks like this      Wikipedia's page on the character says that this mon resembles that of the Takeda clan, and provides a link to the story of Takeda Shingen, as well as a broken link.    Is this really the Takeda mon? (has the author every stated this, or is there any official reference) Or is it all just speculation and the pointing out of similarities? (which may just have been inspirations) Or could it be some other less-known clan's mon? "
461,"What does Tobi mean by ""There lies truth in a single consciousness that has abandoned all individuality""?","In Chapter 594, Tobi says, ""There lies truth in a single consciousness that has abandoned all individuality.""  What is the context of this statement? Is there something specific he is referring to? "
462,What happened to Fairy Tail Monthly?,"Since July 17th 2014, Fairy Tail Monthly has been released. Every month at the 17th it is supposed to come out with the aim to:        Entertain     Inform users of important series information, rumors, funfacts, trivia, etc.     Inform users of ongoing important votes, discussions, and articles needing improvement     Provide users with a quick summary of happenings in the past month, e.g. user rights changes, major community decisions, discussion results     Keep users updated with the latest contests, community activities, etc.       It should also contain a chapter of Fairy Tail Zero, written by Hiro Mashima. Since the chapter is due 11 days now, it made me wonder whether something has happened to the magazine. Was it not yet released in Japan due to Golden Week? Or did the magazine just not contain a chapter this month? Is there anyone that might know more about the magazine and the chapter? "
463,How did Issei steal Vali's power?,I don't remember hearing that the Red Dragon could steal others' power and even use it. How did Issei steal Vali's power? Can the White Dragon steal others' power too? 
464,At which age are ninjas revived with Edo-Tensei?,"The question is easy: At which age are people, when they are revived using Edo-Tensei? Are they exactly of that age they died? Or can the user of Edo-Tensei decide, how old the ninjas are? "
465,Why did humans worship Ilias?,"In Chapter 1 of Monmusu Quest, it is shown that a large number of humans worshiped Ilias. Yet, not all human communities consider her as a goddess. The worship of Ilias also seems to be the root of the conflict between most humans and monster girls considering how much Alice detested Luka's worship of her. The conflict wasn't always the case either, it seems to have arisen after humans started worship Ilias.   Why did humans started worshiping Ilias? How did it get started? "
466,Did Yagami Light take a risk while handing over the Death Note to Rem?,I didn't understand the scenario where Yagami Light relinquishes ownership of his Death Note for the first time.   He trusted Rem to give it to such a person who would have traits like that of Kyosuke Higuchi.  What if that plan had not worked? Didn't the entire plan hinge on Rem's choice of the person? 
467,Why are anime music videos admitted in anime conventions?,"Anime music videos have public screenings in several conventions, especially in the USA. How do they solve the problem of copyright?   Some contests forbid the use of dubbed (localized) anime in competitions because of copyright issues. Are there different rules for content in Japanese (usually ripped from airing)? Is there an explicit or implicit agreement between organizers and copyright holders of Japanese works, or it is permitted by the copyright laws? "
468,Are the visualizations in the anime from the Light Novels?,"During Karen Bee in Nisemonogatari I've noticed some weird scenery, one is after Kanbaru and Araragi clean up Kanbaru's room we see there are books stacked outside in small structures.   Another is when Araragi is talking to Senjougahara about Kaiki, Senjougahara seems to be building with the sharpened pencils, at one point when the table is slammed a group of them fly up into the air and land next to Araragi forming a different structure.  And another one is when Karen confronts Kaiki and the walls seems to act as TV screens. at one point when Kaiki is talking about money, on the wall we see coins fall into place forming notes with what looks to be Araragi's face on them.  Now there is a lot  of other strange scenery like this but i am wondering, are these actually described in the Light Novels or are these artistic choices chosen by SHAFT when making the anime? if so is there a statement as to why they made these choices? "
469,What is Archer's background in Unlimited Blade Works?,"I've only seen Ufotable's adaptation of UBW (and the movie too but that was long ago).  It's still not very clear to me what's up with Archer:   He's Shirou from the future. Does he not remember the events of this war? He would also know that Shirou is going to beat him. How did Shirou die? There is a scene in which a giant glowing ball absorbs Shirou (like some sort of pact), so I assume that's when he became a Heroic Spirit too. Did he die at that point? (so he killed himself) So Archer wants to kill Shirou because he regrets his decision of becoming a Heroic Spirit? Why does he regret it? Because Kiritsugu was right? (that you have to kill people to save others). Why does Archer have Rho Aias from the Trojan War?   And finally,   Is this Archer the same Archer from Fate Stay/Night? In other words, is the Archer from the original series also Shirou from the future?  "
470,What qualifies one as a Dai-Yokai?,"In Inuyasha, there seems to be a higher class of Yokai, where Inuyasha's father belonged, called ""Dai-Yokai"" (or ""Great Yokai"").  What qualifies you (the average Yokai) to be a Dai-Yokai? Are you born like it? Do you earn the status somehow? "
471,"What is the language of the lyrics in ""Replica"" from Ghost in the Shell?",[website]I couldn't find an answer on google or wikipedia. Copy pasting the lyrics into google translate didn't detect the language either. 
472,What's written in Ayatsuji Tsukasa's notebook?,"I'm talking about the notebook seen in the episode 21 of Amagami SS. She said it contained something that could make her leave the school (maybe being expelled?).   If it's that serious, could it be a crime? Did I miss an important plot detail that explains it? Do the contents even get explained in another adaptation of Amagami like the manga or the VN, or are they completely unknown? "
473,What is the full lyrics of the song Si deus me relinquit?,During the 1:42 of the song there is some choir (priests?) singing in the background. But I couldn't find out what they actually singing about. Where can I found the lyrics of this song with the choir part included? 
474,Are Breakers the only ones able to draw on the Lost Precious' powers?,Breakers can draw on Lost Precious' powers and use them. Are they the only ones able to do so?  Are LP only antiques for the other people? 
475,How is Clow Reed and Fei Wong Reed related in Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicle?,"Considering that Clow Reed and Fei Wong Reed have the same surnames and that they both have magical powers, how are they related? It was not clearly stated on the anime series and the manga on how they are related (Or I just overlooked it?). Are they brothers or relatives? Or they just coincidentally have the same surnames? (Though, Yuko said that there is no such things as coincidence, there is only inevitability.)   I'll appreciate any details. Thanks a lot.  "
476,Indra's Mangekyo Sharingan,"In the manga, Indra is shown with his Mangekyo Sharingan:    But in the anime, his eyes are like:    Which one is his actual Mangekyo Sharingan? If it is the one in the anime, then he has the same Mangekyo Sharingan as Sasuke. Then is it true that all Uchihas have unique Mangekyo Sharingans? "
477,Did Kaori know that Arima loved her?,"Did Kaori know that Arima loved her? From the letter she gave to Arima, she confessed everything and even gave that photograph, but at the same time, she told him to throw it away if he wanted to. This according to me suggests that she didn't know if Arima loved her. If she knew about Arima's feelings, she wouldn't have said it to him. Is there any strong evidence whether Kaori knew about Arima's feelings in the Manga/Anime? "
478,What happens when Naruto is talking to the Kyuubi?,When Naruto is talking to the Kyuubi is his mind or his spirit inside the Kyuubi?  What happens while he is running? Does he have something like an autopilot? 
479,How different are the anime and manga versions of Death Note?,"Although this question was closed, it was actually through it that I came to realize that the anime and manga versions of Death Note are different, having only seen the anime version.    Just how different are the two versions? Does the anime simply omit some details, shortening the story? Or do they take completely different directions at some point? (much like the FMA manga and its first anime series) If this is the case, at which point do they part? "
480,Why is Yoruichi able to transform?,Why/how is Yoruichi Shihōin able to transform into a cat? Was she always able to or did she learn it somehow? Does she have some object that allows here to?  As far as I can remember she seems the only one to be able to transform (into an animal). 
481,Why can't Alphonse trade his alchemy for Edward's alchemy?,"At the end of the FMA: Brotherhood (Fullmetal Alchemist) series, Edward tried to use alchemy and failed because he wanted his brother back and the law of equivalent exchange clearly states that     Humankind cannot gain anything without first giving something in return. To obtain, something of equal value must be lost.   Therefore Alphonse's alchemy would be an equal value to Edward's alchemy. so my question is if Edward Elric traded his brother's (Alphonse Elric) body and soul with his alchemy, why can't Alphonse trade his alchemy for Edward's alchemy?  Previously, it was asked Why can&#39;t Edward get back his power to do alchemy? That question was (in my perspective) saying Ed should use a philosopher's stone to do alchemy, because a philosopher's stone ignores the law of equivalent exchange. My question focuses on the observation that a transmutation by Al to give up his alchemy for Ed's should be a good example of following the law of equivalent exchange. "
482,How does someone obtain spiritual powers?,"Ichigo (obviously) has them, like his father. But it does not seem something that someone just inherits from their parent(s)? One of Ichigos his sisters has little and the other none.  Does one need to (accidentally) come into contact in order to obtain spiritual powers? Although Ichigo always seem to have had them.  Or is it just (dumb) 'luck' and one has them or not? "
483,Who writes the Dragon Ball Heroes manga?,So now aside the Dragon Ball Super manga aparently there is also a Dragon Ball Heroes manga. Who writes the Dragon Ball Heroes manga? Does Akira Toriyama has any involvement in it?    
484,Can you kill people using photos?,"Not trying to kill L or any other potential enemy of Light using pictures using Misa's eye is a plothole?  I kind of forgotten if the anime or in the manga (I haven't read the manga), has a scene where they wrote someone's name in the Death Note by means of pictures or photos. And if they did, how could Light never thought about using this tactic? "
485,Can a ghoul's skin be pierced by earthly weapons?,"In Tokyo Ghoul, Jason claimed, while torturing Kaneki, that a ghoul's skin can not be pierced by any ordinary metal. If so, then:   How could Rei wound Kurona and Nashiro by knives? Why don't the Doves use ordinary rifles and swords instead of Kagune to attack ghouls?   These instances are contradictory and paradoxical. Please give an explanation which makes all these instances reasonable. "
486,How could Rudy be a sorcerer before he was an adventurer?,Heavy spoilers if you haven't gotten past the Return of the Goblin King arc.      Rudy was not an adventurer until after Shiroe successfully raised him using new world-level magic.  How was he able to gain levels beforehand?  Can People of The Land have classes and gain XP even if they are not adventurers?  It seems to me that you have to be an adventurer before you can gain levels and things.  
487,Is it confirmed Fu having saiyan cells?,"So several dragon ball youtubers are talking about Fu having saiyan cells (and other kind of cells kinda like Cell) and that being the reason he can have a saiyan-like transformation, but is this confirmed? Is there any official source (perhaps the Dragon Ball Heroes videogame or the manga) where they state Fu have saiyan cells? "
488,Who is the 9th Titan shifter?,"SPOILERS   Read only if you are caught up to date with the latest manga chapter (93 in this case).  Before chapter 93 we knew      that the 9 titan shifters are :  1) Progenitor Titan aka Founding Titan -> Currently Eren Jaeger  2) Attack Titan aka Assault Titan -> Currently Eren Jaeger  3) Colossal Titan -> Currently Armin Arlert   4) Female Titan -> Currently Annie Leonheart  5) Armored Titan -> Currently Reiner Braun  6) Beast Titan -> Currently Zeke Jaeger  7) Cart Titan aka Mule Titan aka Quadrupedal Titan -> Peak  8) Dancing Titan -> Ymir  9) Jaw Titan -> Galliard   After reading chapter 93, interestingly we have:       that the 9 titan shifters are :  1) Progenitor Titan aka Founding Titan -> Currently Eren Jaeger  2) Attack Titan aka Assault Titan -> Currently Eren Jaeger  3) Colossal Titan -> Currently Armin Arlert   4) Female Titan -> Currently Annie Leonheart  5) Armored Titan -> Currently Reiner Braun  6) Beast Titan -> Currently Zeke Jaeger  7) Cart Titan aka Mule Titan aka Quadrupedal Titan -> Peak  8) Dancing Titan aka Jaw Titan (are the same!!) -> Currently Galliard  9) ?????????   Are there any hints so far? "
489,Are Vegito super saiyan blue kaioken and Canba base form even?,"Why Canba transformed in chapter 3 of Dragon Ball Heroes into Golden Oozaru? Was he supposed to be weaker than Vegito super saiyan blue kaioken or was he supposed to be weaker? Some fans claims he was weaker, that wasnt what I got from the battle but perhaps it's portrayed differently in the manga.  Are Vegito super saiyan blue kaioken and Canba base form even? "
490,Who are these soldiers from Rider's Ionioi Hetairoi?,"In Fate/Zero, there are some soldiers from Rider's Ionioi Hetairoi that look somewhat important. All of them are heroes so they probably a named hero as well. Who are they? Do they have any name?   "
491,Is Cheese-kun real?,"In Code Geass, particularly in the original Japanese version, we can see there was something like a product placement exchanged (as shown in this answer) between the series and Pizza Hut.      Later in the series, C.C. starts having stickers and a giant plush of what appears to be Pizza Hut's mascot, named Cheese-kun.     Now, back when Code Geass first appeared in the west, I did not notice Pizza Hut having anything like Cheese-kun in Australia, but then again it appears there was an attempt to remove Pizza Hut references from the series when it was localized in the west.  So I am wondering, does Cheese-kun exist in Japan? If so, did it exist before or after Code Geass? Who created it, the author of Code Geass or Pizza Hut? And does it still represent Pizza Hut now? "
492,Why didn't Rod Reiss just eat Eren? Why did he need Historia?,"Why didn't Rod Reiss just eat Eren? Why did he need Historia? If Reiss just ate Eren, he would be the king, and do whatever he wanted (except that the King's will may overrule some his own free-will).  In the Anime, he even says that ""I must not become a titan myself"". src: Attack on Titan Season 3 Episode 44 – ""Wish"" @ 13:46 "
493,How many of the members of the 104th corps are titan shifters?,"So far       Eren, Annie, and Ymir    have been shown to be titan shifters. From an Attack on Titan wikia I know also      Reiner and Bertolt are also titan shifters   How many more are known to be titan shifters from the manga? Are there more titan shifters than humans in that division? "
494,What do the names represent in Koe no Katachi soundtrack?,"In Disc 1 of Koe no Katachi OST (link to online shop which includes the tracklist), the name of every soundtrack is a 3-letter ""word"" (except 38. Invention No. 1 C dur), such as ""tre"", ""rev"", ""lit"", etc..   The names seem random to me. What do the names actually represent? The composer won't just put random letters as the names, right? "
495,Did Ranma lose his (her?) virginity in the Ranma 1/2 anime series?,"Remembering old anime series we happened to talk about Ranma 1/2 and the amount of sexual jokes it had. I then remembered that the show was emitted in Spain with a lot of controversy, and then I came across an article from the 90s, published in a major newspaper, that charged against the show and the channel emitting it.   In the article (in Spanish) you can read the following (my translation):     In the episode in which Ranma loses his virginity in the showers (the kid comes out tripping over, in shock), [...].   I sincerely cannot remember such moment. I am almost sure that the person who wrote the article just saw something that nobody else saw. I know that some years later, when Karekano was emitted in Japan, there was a lot of controversy and debate about the scene where it is poetically suggested that the two main characters lose their virginities with each other, I supposed because that was the first time that such thing was depicted in an anime series with teenagers as main characters. So I doubt that a similar scene really happened in Ranma 1/2.  But as I haven't watched the complete anime series, I ask: did Ranma Saotome lose his (or her) virginity in any episode of the series or any of the movies? Or at least is there any scene that can be misinterpreted as stated by the article? "
496,What's up with Mioko's speech pattern?,"Mioko (voiced by Kana Hanazawa) uses some kind of unusual speech pattern which the subtitles translate into vaguely US Southern dialectal English:     Specifically, I can hear her using ora to refer to herself and ending her sentences with de gasu instead of desu. Wikipedia says ora is an informal pronoun with rural connotations, and this Google Books result says de gasu is a contraction of de gozarimasu, a very polite form of de aru.  You can hear it for yourself in Episode 7 starting around 24 seconds in.  Is Mioko's accent a specific regional accent, or is it just one of those made up bizarre speech patterns that anime specializes in? "
497,What actually are Dragon Slayers?,"I just started watching Fairy Tail and I got to know about the dragon slayers Natsu and Gajeel.  However, what actually are dragon slayers? If they did kill a dragon, why does Natsu seem to be so attached to Igneel? "
498,What happened to the Senkai Gates during Inoue's kidnapping?,"In the Hueco Mundo arc, Episode 139, 19th minute, the passage between gates should be closing from behind but the narrowing of the passage wasn't approaching and though Inoue stayed there for a lot of time and chatted with Ulquiorra while he cuts down Inoue's escorts and she waits and heals them. Such a long time taken and no threat of narrowing of gates till then? What happened suddenly? Why? "
499,"How does All for One's ""stealing quirk"" work?","How does All for One's ""stealing quirk"" work? Does he have to touch the victim, or can he do it from distance? Is this ever explained in the manga, official book, movie or something? "
500,Why can Enel be hit without Haki?,"In the Skypia Arc Enel is directly hit, although he has a Logia type Devil Fruit. Why can Enel be hit without using Haki? I know Haki was introduced a long time after the Skypia Arc. But other Logia users, like Smoker, could not get hit from Ruffy at that time.  What makes Enel different from other Logia users? "
501,Why does Akane support Sybil?,"I had a few questions in mind. Akane is someone who strongly believes in justice and she doesn't cross the line even she could. She knows Sybil is not the perfect system and lots of people do suffer from injustice because of it. So why support it then even when she has had the chances to destroy it?  I mean how bad can it get without Sybil. It might be difficult for the society without Sybil but if the rest of the world can live without it, then why not the Japanese? "
502,When did Kuradeel join Laughing Coffin?,In Episode 10 - Crimson Killing Intent it is revealed that Kuradeel is a member of Laughing Coffin.  In Episode 8 - The Sword Dance of Black and White during Kuradeel's and Kirito's Duel there was a member of Laughing Coffin in the crowd watching the the fight.  I am wondering if Kuradeel joined Laughing Coffin before or after this Duel. if it was after was there any other reason for him to join aside from him wanting to get back at Kirito?  If it was before what purpose was there to have a member of Laughing Coffin inside the Knights of the Blood Oath? 
503,Is My Hero Academia: Illegals canon?,Recently I found about  My Hero Academia: Illegals. Is this manga supposed to be canon? Do events from it count for the main My Hero Academia storyline or something from it already appeared in the anime? 
504,Is Bishamon a god of war or a god of fortune?,"In Noragami, somethings are still not clear to me. Bishamon was first introduced as a god of war. In fact, Yato said that she was the mightiest god of war. But in the second season, she is said to be one of the seven gods of fortune.  The question is what exactly is Bishamon a god of. Is it common for gods to be for two entirely different things?  Same goes for Yato. He was said to be a god of war and also a god of calamity. And why is there a need of two gods of war if Yato is a god of war? "
505,Does Mirio Togata have superhuman speed?,"Supposedly, Mirio Togata was able to defeat half of the Class 1A students in less than 6 seconds. How is this possible? His quirk is supposed to be permeation, does he for some reason also have superhuman speed as part of his superhero habilities? "
506,Why Kidd/Hawkins/Apoo alliance are planning to take down Shanks?,"Just in latest episode of One piece (Episode 736). There was one scene which shows that Kidd/Hawkins/Apoo alliance are planning to take down Shanks.  So my question is, Why Shanks? I mean there has to be some sort of reason behind this. Why didn't they choose someone else. What's the main reason behind this?  Note: I follow Anime rather than Manga "
507,Is Gogeta super saiyan blue confirmed in the new Dragon Ball Super movie?,"There are many people talking about not only that they think Gogeta will appear in the new movie, but they are refering to a supposed tweet where a japanese animator said he's going to do Gogeta in the new movie. Does anyone know if this official? Supposedly the official release of this info was done in japanese. Any translation? "
508,Why didn't the Survey Corps just use the top of the Walls as a way to get to Shiganshina?,"The Survey Corps went through the titan territory to get to Shiganshina, not without dead bodies. On the other hand, there's enough space for horses to walk on at the top of the Walls, and the dead body count would reduce.  Why didn't they just use the top of Wall Maria and ride along it to get to Shiganshina? Why did they take the hard way instead of the easy and safe way? "
509,Naruto Shippuden episodes after The final battle,"After watching the final battle between Naruto and Sasuke and the Naruto Uzumaki episode, I stopped watching the series because I thought it was over. Now i see there are about ~15 more episodes.   Are the episodes after the 479 - Naruto Uzumaki (480-500) canon? Or are these episodes some fillers after the actual plot? "
510,Was Natsu trying to imitate someone?,"Fairy Tail and Yankee-kun to Megane-chan have a cross over titled Fairy Megane, and there's one scene when Natsu wore a glasses from Adachi.    Was he trying to imitate someone? If he did, who was that? "
511,Why did Obito spare Kakashi?,"During his time of Obito being with Madara, the White Zetsus told him that Rin and ""Stupid Kakashi"" were in trouble. Obito hurried as fast as he could to get to where Kakashi and Rin where. Once he got there, he saw that Rin was already dead and that Kakashi was the one who killed her. At the same time, Kakashi and Obito awakened the Mangekyou Sharingan which made Kakashi faint and Obito just sad/mad. Obito got so mad he went on a rampage. He killed all the other people that were around Kakashi and Rin. Once he finished, he went to Rin and hugged her. After that, he looked back to see Kakashi who was on the floor.  At that time, Obito had a huge chance of killing Kakashi, but for some reason, he did not want to kill the person who took the love of his life away from him.  Why did Obito spare Kakashi? Why didn't he kill him instead? Did he just feel bad for killing someone who was defenseless, or because he was going to feel bad for killing his old friend? Is there another reason for this, or is there just none?  "
512,How much of the manga does One Week Friends cover?,I was wondering how much of the manga does the anime version of one week friends cover? I'm also wondering if the ending of the anime diverged from the manga? 
513,Who is Don Freecs?,Is he an ancestor of Ging and Gon? What is probably his story aside from being the author of the Book which talked about the Dark Continent? 
514,Do artificial devil fruits also prevent the user from swimming?,"If someone eats a devil fruit, they can get some power depending on the fruit that they eat. The side effect for eating this fruit is that the user cannot swim.  How about the artificial devil fruits that are made by Dr. Vegapunk? Is it the case that people that eat artificial devil fruits also can't swim and are weakened by the sea? "
515,Are there side effects in using Iron Blood Transformation?,"In the series we see Toru activate his power every once in a while. And also disabling it every once in a while. The fact he disables it makes me wonder, do his powers have any side effects ? What exactly are his powers anyway?  "
516,Who is the boy at the end of Feng Shen Ji Season 3?,"Some people say he is Shen Yen, but how? They don't look alike at all, and Shen Yen should have been dead by then. So, who is this boy?   "
517,Does Konan have a theme song?,Pretty much every character in Naruto seems to have his/her own theme song. But I can't seem to find a theme song for Konan. Does she just not have one? or is it just hard to find/ not released yet ?  
518,How do the visions happen when Itami hits his head on EP.1?,"In episode 1(5:15) Itami hits his head and while on the floor he sees the 3 girls he is going to hang out with in the future. But how does he see that?  Is it something the Rory did, or Lelei or Tuka? Or is it something else?  [website]"
519,How does the barrier taunt work?,"In chapter 709 of One Piece, Bartolomeo has been seen blocking Elizabello II's king punch with his barrier, while shouting ""Barrier"". In the translator's comment it stated that this is a common taunt in Japanese school yards. Now how does this taunt work? How would I use it if I were in a Japanese school yard?   "
520,"Why do the names of the Sankakusu sites match the surnames of Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto?","In ep. 2 of season 3 of Sailor Moon Crystal, Mamoru says that the amusement park Chibi-Usa is going to is in Sankakusu, which is on reclaimed land. Later, Artemis tells Luna that there are three reclaimed sites that comprise Sankakusu: Tenohzu, Kaiohzu, and Meiohzu.  It struck me that the romanised forms of these three sites can be produced by appending ""-zu"" to each of the surnames of the Outer Senshi (excluding Saturn). (The civilian names of the Guardians concerned are Haruka Tenoh, Michiru Kaioh, and Setsuna Meioh.) After some experimenting with romanization schemes (tenohzu, which is the official romanisation, does not produce useful search results, but tenouzu produced a lead) and running some searches, I found someone who claims that these three sites have the kanji 天王洲, 海王洲, and 冥王洲 respectively. In each case, the first two characters correspond to the surnames of the Senshi that I named earlier.  Is there any in-universe reason for this correspondence between the names of the sites and these Senshi's surnames? (I might shrug away ""Kaiohzu Park"", which appears in ep. 7 of Sailor Moon S as a one-off coincidence, but it would be unlikely if all three names matched up by chance.)   It makes sense that Haruka and Michiru have helicopters that are named Tenohmaru and Kaiohmaru, since they own these helicopters, but it seems doubtful that they would have plots of land named after them. Perhaps their identities are completely made-up, and the surnames came after the sites were named? (Perhaps they chose their new identities based on the names of the sites?) However, at least in Sailor Moon S, the identity ""Haruka Tenoh"" seems to have existed even before Haruka became Sailor Uranus (per the characterisation in the flashback of ep. 17 of Sailor Moon S), even if it makes sense that Sailor Pluto would need a new identity (not being from the present).   As an aside, with slight spoilers for Sailor Moon S:      It makes sense that Saturn is excluded. Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto consistently work together in Sailor Moon S, whereas Saturn only appears towards the end of that season. I imagine that this might also be the case in the manga and SMC. Moreover, it's clear that at least Saturn has a  real-life identity that has not been falsified.  "
521,How do Logia powers work?,"PS: Warning, not sure whether parts should be considered spoiler.  It is said that Logia typed Devil Fruit Users cannot be hit without Haki. Yet while re-watching the Alabasta Arc, Ace was touched twice by Luffy. The first time when he flew inside the restaurant, Luffy hit Smoker and threw him up against Ace, both making a huge hole in the next couple of buildings. The second time was when Luffy was arm wrestling Ace, although this scene might not be canon though. So my question is, how was Luffy able to push back both Smoker and Ace when flying inside the restaurant, since he shouldn't be able to. Does this mean Logia users can ""solidify"" themselves or maybe only parts of themselves, kind of like coating with Haki? Also what would be the default form for a Logia user? "
522,"Is there a Japanese opening/intro for ""Golden Boy"" (「ゴールデンボーイ」)?","""Golden Boy"" (「ゴールデンボーイ」) op seems odd to me:   There are shots of the main character with no credits on picture. The credits are white on a black background inter-titles inserted among the shots. The music is ""unusual"" and with no lyrics.   I must say that I watched it from a Spanish DVD edition (it included Spanish dub and subtitles).  The ending of the videos I watched are strange as well: just a classic white on black scroll with a Japanese song as sound.  Did ""Golden Boy"" aired in Japan with this kind of credits too? If so, is there a reason for it? "
523,Which one is Funami Yui's apartment room?,"In Yuru Yuri San Hai! episode 6, there was power outage. Later, the building where Yui lives was shown.    Which makes me think that (based on the center of the picture), Yui's room is the one on top right corner with the lights on. However, later on it was shown like this.    Which one is Yui's room? "
524,Which episode is this scene when Lan Wangji smiles at Wei Wuxian on the roof?,I was watching this MV of Mo Dao Zu Shi and the part on 5:08-5:19 when Lan Wangji smiles at Wei Wuxian on the roof is what I haven't seen in the Anime/Donghua.  Where is this clip from? 
525,How did Welfin know about Komugi?,"In episode 134, when Meruem ask about Pouf's secret to Welfin, Welfin thinks so hard, harder than his brain is capable of. And the result is that he says ""Komugi"" .   I am curious, why did Welfin know about Komugi? Did he meet her before?   "
526,Can anyone be a wizard?,"In Fairy Tail, the anime, do you have to be born a wizard in order to learn to summon and wield magic? Or is summoning and wielding magic energy something anyone has the potential to do if they choose to learn how?  It states that people use it for everyday life. "
527,Why isn't Lust covering up her tattoo?,"In one of the early chapters of Fullmetal Alchemist (chapter 8 I believe), when Edward and Alphonse go with Armstrong back to Resembool for repairs, we see Lust on the same train.    Here, her tattoo isn't covered up, unlike later in chapter 34 when she meets with Havoc on a date.    The second image is from the end of chapter 34. This is after Hawkeye runs into Barry the Chopper, and after Mustang has started his investigation into the higher ups (which is shown in the same chapter). Envy is also shown tracking down Mustang's activities in that chapter, but this is before Edward tells Breda about what he knows from Laboratory 5.  This seems to imply that she covers up her tattoo to look more ""normal"" in public, but if that's the case, why wouldn't she be covering up the tattoo earlier? Or is the assumption that she covers up in public not correct? (Thinking back on it, it alos might be relevant that the tattoo isn't that large - which isn't a detail I currently remember - and therefore suspicious-looking to someone who doesn't know).  EDIT: I don't think Mustang's team knows about the homunculi specifically at this point in this. Although they have detained Barry the Chopper and so know something is up with the philosopher's stones, I remember Alphonse mentioning the homunculi's existence right before the section where Lust is killed, and Mustang being shocked by the revelation (at least in Brotherhood, where he proceeded to lose control of his driving). "
528,Who does the Fishman Island territory belong to?,"To whom does the Fishman Island territory belong to? First it was sure Whitebeard's territory. But what happened after he died? I thought Blackbeard took them all, because he knew them really well.  Or did Big Mama take this island?  Is Fishman Island is now Luffy's territory? "
529,What's the connection between Zangetsu and White Ichigo?,"This contains spoilers up to chapter 112 (not much of a spoiler, but still).      White Ichigo (a.k.a. Hollow Ichigo) appeared in the Hollowfication process, when Urahara had cruelly thrown Ichigo into a pit, and he is the Hollow part of Ichigo's soul (and power).    Now, take a look at this (this is from chapter 112, right after      White Ichigo first appears and gets beaten by Ichigo):   It shows not only that Zangetsu is acquainted with White Ichigo, but also is in apparently well relations with him (""sorry to have bothered you""), and is also apparently able to summon and unsummon him (""send me back already"").   How and why is Zangetsu (a Zanpakutō!) able to summon the Hollow inside of Ichigo? Shouldn't a Zanpakutō spirit and a Hollow Spirit be natural enemies? "
530,What's the origin of spiral glasses as a Japanese stereotype?,"I've noticed - and indubitably, others have, too, as noted on this TV Tropes page - that often, whenever a ""nerdy"" character wears glasses in anime, they have a spiral shape on them. Examples are easy to find, with popular examples including Saori from Oreimo:    In particular, I became curious upon noticing them in Berserk, on Puck's ""business"" glasses:    I was just wondering, since this trope seems so ubiquitous in Japanese cultures and rare in others - what is the origin of this design? What about the spiral shape is intended to elicit an aura of ""geekiness"", and what major origins or influences led to its widespread use today? "
531,Where do Saga's pants come from?,"In episode 71, Saga wears his Gemini Golden Cloth when he was fully naked. But in episode 73, when his cloth shatters, we see that he is wearing a pair of pants. When did he put on those pants? Where did they come from? Were they hidden inside the Golden Cloth?   Just before he wears his cloth. (Episode 71)    When his cloth shatters. (Episode 73) "
532,"Does Light Novel-based, slice of life anime in general have a clearly defined setting?","Something I noticed while watching a lot of popular anime based on Light Novels that focuses on slice of life for the most (Oregairu, Haruhi Suzumiya, Oreimo, etc.) is that they never stated where in Japan is the story actually taking place. In a lot of cases I noted that these settings tend to be a non-decrepit small to medium sized town with a school, and yet at other times, despite this ambiguity, the characters visit an identifiable real life locale, such as Oreimo with the Akihabara district, which seems to imply that the series happen around Tokyo. I can understand if the anime adaptation would not bother mentioning the setting, but is this ever touched upon in the original Light Novel source or has it always been sort of a case of the ""Springfield"" trope in play? Is it possible that there is some kind of general assumption by the Japanese populace that all series happen in Tokyo or something? "
533,Can a person killed by Death Soul Reaper be brought back to life through Reanimation?,"While fighting Orochimaru, Sandaime Hokage Hiruzen stated that a person killed by Death Soul Reaper Jutsu will have his soul imprisoned in the Soul Reaper's body for eternity and will be restless there. How can they be reanimated then? And in the event that they are reanimated, what will happen when they are released from reanimation? Will they go back to the Soul Reaper or will they rest in peace? "
534,Why does Fujin choose to talk the way she does?,"In Final Fantasy VIII, Fujin talks using one-word sentences throughout most of the game.    However, close to the end of the game, she uses much longer sentences when she is pleading with Seifer to stop what he is doing.    Now it's obvious that it's a decision on her part to talk like in the first screenshot, and while I can assume she only makes ""small talk"", is it explained why she uses one word most of the time which can be read as yelling (all caps)? Is it like this in the Japanese version? "
535,"What are Byakuya's Gokei, Senkei and Shuukei?","In addition to his bankai, Byakuya is observed using three techniques:   Gokei      I think it was in battle with Hitsugaya's Reigai, though I'm not sure  Senkei      while fighting Ichigo at Rukia's execution  Shūkei      in the same fight as above    Not only is this the largest number of Zanpakutō abilities that we have seen in one sword (I think), but each one of them seems more powerful than the last (and more powerful than his bankai!).  So what exactly are those three techniques? Why is Byakuya the only one in Bleach to have so many different techniques contained in his Zanpakutō? "
536,How do inanimate objects eat devil fruit?,"Devil fruit users gained their powers by eating the devil fruit. But how did these inanimate objects gain their power?   This is Luffy, eating a devil fruit before he became a rubber man.    And this is Lassoo, one of Mr.4's guns that became a dog. How did a gun ate it?   "
537,Did Squad 13 contain a pioneer among the Parasites?,"The events of episode 17 eventually lead to the revelation that      Kokoro is pregnant with Mitsuru's child   In episode 22 New Nana states that this diagnosis was obtained primarily from old-world information regarding hormone levels. New Nana then goes on to state that pregnancy inhibits a Pistil's ability to pilot a Franxx, with the two courses of actions being:   Stay out of the action until the child is born, or Abort the foetus   Which begs the question, was this the first recorded instance of a Pistil becoming pregnant? From Original Nana's flashback in episode 18 we know that      Neither Kokoro and Mitsuru, nor Hiro and Zero Two are the first Parasite pairing to fall in love   But how is it known that pregnancy interferes with the ability to pilot a Franxx if she is the first of her kind to be affected? "
538,Why are Haki attacks not effective on Marine admirals?,"Why are Haki attacks not effective on Marine admirals?  In the Marineford war, we see countless instances where Haki-imbued attacks don't affect Marine admirals. When Marco and Vista attack Sakazuki, he even acknowledges that they are Haki-imbued, but nothing apparently happens:    Another case is when Whitebeard attacks Aokiji:     What's with the admirals? Their Logia powers don't seem to be easily affected by Haki attacks. I mean we have many instances where Haki has touched their body, but still there are many instances where attacks on their body don't result in damage. What's the deal with Marine admirals?  "
539,Why did Togusa's family computer buy Cerano Genomics stock by itself?,"In the episode 14 the Section 9 discovered a program that kept making money for the man who died four months ago. In the end of the episode Togusa is seen with his wife talking about how she gained 100k yen from buying Meditech stock a while back. Then she turns off the computer and together they leave the room. After that, their computer turns back on, buys 80k of Cerano Genomics stock and turns off.    Was it the dead man's program that did this? Is this how it made money? Or was it something else? "
540,Is manga censorship in Western countries always done with author consent?,"Censorship is usually seen as an act against the author's will. Talking with an editor in my country (Italy) working for a publishing house in the erotic manga market, he tells me that censorship for erotic manga is done in two verses: removing censor bars and obfuscation necessary in Japan (decensorship) and removing elements not suited to Western audience or in a gray legal area, e.g. child nudity. Both of those censorship and decensorship are done with the author consent, becoming a self-censorship and generating a new derivative work featuring important changes.  Shortly: is censorship of manga always done with author consent both in erotic and mainstream publications during localization? Is there a common practice around the world on this topic about manga localization? Are there any cases of censorship of manga publications done without author consent in Western countries? "
541,Why are Son Gohan and Son Goten so strong?,"Why is Son Gohan always so strong?  I mean Son Goku trains all day long, but Gohan studies all day long. So how did he manage to be so strong when Cell or Buu arrived? I mean, both started training when they were kids?   Is it same with Son Goten? I mean Fusion SS3 at this young age, this is quite strong. "
542,Why was the bridge already down when the second train arrived?,"In the first episode of the new anime ""Koutetsujou-no-Kabaneri"", the first train had to stop before they let it enter the station. (which can be seen in the following picture)    Why was the bridge already down before the second train even arrived? This made it easy for the Kabane to invade the station. (here you can see that the bridge was already down before the train even arrived)    Was this an error? Or is it a part of the plot, to let the Kabane enter the station? "
543,Reanimation of Yondaime during Chunin exams,"I read everywhere that Orochimaru tried to reanimate the 4th Hokage during the Chunin exams, but he was unable to reanimate him because he was sealed inside Soul Reaper's belly. But if he can't reanimate him, what was the point of the coffin? To perform reanimation, he needs a host first. He must have reanimated him earlier on a host if it was possible. So what was the point of summoning that coffin?  According to the Naruto wikia's page on Summoning: Impure World Reincarnation (specific revision),     To perform this technique, the user must first acquire some of the DNA of the person they intend to reincarnate. Kabuto remarks that this basically amounts to grave-robbing, although blood stains or organs salvaged after the target's death also work. The soul of the intended reincarnated must also reside in the pure world (浄土, jōdo); for example, those whose souls have been consumed by the Death God cannot be reincarnated. However, if it is a case where the souls are freed from inside the Shinigami, then a user of this technique is free to reincarnate them once again.      Next, a living sacrifice is required for the soul of the reincarnated to use as a vessel.  "
544,Why do light novels and manga have long titles?,"So, I came across these comments in an r/manga post:     KibaTeo: Even a short series became an isekai      MonochromeGuy: That statement itself just sounds like a LN title.      in0ri: Gotta triple the length of the title, bro      Irru: Even Though This Was Supposed To Be A Generic Romantic Comedy, I Somehow Got Transported To A Different World!      KibaTeo: . . . is that an actual series tho? cause it sounds way too plausible      CelioHogane: He just tripled the lenght as it was asked.     I was wondering... why is this a thing, though? It seems that lots of series these days (especially light novels) are given very long and descriptive titles. Some classic examples include:   Oreimo   short for: Ore no Imouto ga Konnani Kawaii Wake ga Nai translation: My Little Sister Can't Be This Cute  Watamote   short for: Watashi ga Motenai no wa Dou Kangaetemo Omaera ga Warui! translation: No Matter How I Look at It, It's You Guys' Fault I'm Not Popular!    And here's a more recent series (that doesn't seem to have a shortened nickname yet):   Imamade Ichido mo Onnaatsukai sareta Koto ga Nai Onna Kishi wo Onnaatsukai suru Manga   translation: A Story About Treating a Female Knight, Who Has Never Been Treated as a Woman, as a Woman    One would think that having super long titles would be a disadvantage because they'd be difficult to remember :P So, my question is, why is this style of title so common? Is this a recent thing? How did this trend of super long titles come about? "
545,Why was there a kid running with a Uchiha crest on his jacket iafter the Uchiha ending?,Why was there a kid running with a Uchiha crest on his jacket in Naruto Shippuden after the uchiha ending?  Did another Uchiha survive that no know one knows about? Or did he find the missing jacket and is wearing it? Or did he survive then later dies? 
546,Why does Tobi put up a goofball facade initially?,"This question contains spoilers  Tobi introduced himself as Madara to Nagato and Konan. Zetsu knows his real identity. He showed his real face to Kisame. Itachi at least knows that Tobi is not a goofball (if not his real identity). Why did he have to put up a goofball facade for Sasori, Deidara, Kakuzu and Hidan? There were reasons to keep his real identity hidden, but why did he not introduce himself as Madara to the whole group?  "
547,Can the scenario for someone's death be written so that there is a possibility of other people dying?,"So you can't use the Death Note to kill someone else. If you write something like:      ""John Zerto burns himself to death after he killed his boss""   John would simply die of a heart attack so he couldn't kill his boss. But if you would write:      ""John Zerto dies after a heart attack after he tried to shoot his boss""   That could work. After 6 minutes and 40 seconds, John would take out his gun and try to shoot his boss. And because there's a chance his boss could survive, it could possibly work. So what do you think? Could this work? "
548,Why do the summoned Servants all belong to different classes?,"In the Fate universe, is there a reason why the Servants summoned in each Holy Grail War belong to different classes?   Using relics and additional incantations during the summoning ritual, Masters have some degree of control over the Class (e.g. Matou Kariya's additional incantations to choose the Berserker Class) and exact identity of the Servant.   What would happen if two Masters both tried the same Class using an incantation (e.g., Berserker), or even used (part of) the same relic to summon the same Servant? For example:      What would happen if Waver Velvet had only stolen part of Rider's (Iskandar) cloak, unbeknownst to Kayneth Archibald, and both Masters tried to summon Rider?  "
549,Why does censorship level differ between manga and anime?,"I have noticed that anime adapted from a manga heavily tone down the level of violence and ""fanservice"" (sometimes skipping them entirely). Why is the censorship level different between manga and anime? I assume they are bound by the same censorship laws, or is this not true?  "
550,"Is ""Read or Die"" based on manga?",Both are based off mangas right? Do I have to read the mangas for either series or can I just watch the OVA and animes and not have to read the mangas? 
551,How did Alphonse recover his pre-gate memories?,"In FMA: Brotherhood, Alphonse recover the memories he lost after going through the Gate, by having Martel's blood spattered over his own blood seal (the one that binds his soul to his armor), and is, henceworth, able to use the knowledge inherent to it, such as using alchemy without transmutation circles.  Is there a reason for which blood should have been splattered over his seal for him to recover his memories?  Or was it only coincidence/traumatic? "
552,"Arata Naru Sekai OVA, premise and explanation of the ending?","Madhouse's recent OVA, ""Arata Naru Sekai"" is a one-shot 30 minute OVA without much background. I can gather that:   time-travel is prevalent in this world the 4 girls seemed to have traveled far into the future there was perhaps some kind of imminent disaster in the past the disaster perhaps happened very soon after their jump into the future the past that they lived in was already starting to fall apart   So what happened after the cell phone was destroyed? Was it all a dream? Or did it transport them back to the past or some alternate reality?  EDIT: I found the synopsis at MAL which sort of confirms some of the premise (though I don't really see any evidence for some of the claims in the MAL synopsis), but it doesn't shed any light on the ending. "
553,Could I kill myself with a Death Note?,"  On the bottom left paragraph, it reads:     You will not die if you write your own name in here, but it's not recommended.   This page is taken from the pilot chapter of Death Note. Would the manga pilot be considered canon? And thus, would I be able to kill myself with the Death Note or not? "
554,Does the prime minister die at the end?,The Code Breaker anime has an open ended finish (so I'm thinking a sequel?!) but it's not clear to me if the prime minister dies at the end or not. Hitomi used his abilities on him and at the end the prime minister spits blood but it's not clear if he also dies.  Does the manga mention this? 
555,Did Rogue and Gajeel ever meet before the Tournament?,"In chapter 318, Gajeel mentions Rogue's real name, R(e)yos.      So what's the deal between them? I thought Rogue only adored/feared Gajeel from the shadows (pun not intended). So how did he know his real name? "

557,Where is this statue on horseback from?,"In ep. 1 of Joker Game, we see this shot of a statue (that resembles a person on horseback) before a large Western-style building. Does this correspond to a real-life location?    The first episode seems to take place in Tokyo, so I tried searching for statues on horseback in Tokyo. The main result I got was for a statue of Kusunoki Masashige in the Imperial Gardens, which looks similar in stance, but the photographs that I have seen (such as this one) do not seem to have such a building in the background.  I also tried searching for the Imperial Palace to try to see if any buildings match up with this one, however, and I discovered that most of the Palace was destroyed in firebombings in the Second World War. It seems plausible then that this indeed is a statue of Kusunoki Masashige, and that the area around the statue has simply changed from when the anime is set (1937).  Is this actually the Kusunoki Masashige statue, or is this some other location in the Tokyo area? "
558,How was it possible to summon Sasori with Edo Tensei?,"As we know, Sasori has       turned his body into a puppet, with a small ""core of living flesh"" being the only living part of it:    This question also states that when summoned by Edo Tensei,      the reincarnated seem to retain any permanent body damage and physical   limitations they received during their lifetime.   Obviously, Sasori would fall under someone who had suffered some physical...limitations. We know that       after being brought back by Edo Tensei, Sasori eventually was released, and vanished like any other summoned shinobi (of flesh and bones), so it clearly wasn't another puppet:    So how was Kabuto able to summon Sasori? If the reincarnation retains body damage, wouldn't he only be able to reincarnate Sasori's ""Living Core""? I doubt that the process of ""enchanting"", which Kabuto can perform, involves re-making the whole body. "

561,What does the 'D' stand for in all the names?,"There are a lot of characters with the middle initial ""D"".  Is this an indication of something, or do they really all just have middle initials of the letter D?  If they are initials, do we know what they stand for?  Examples of names:     Monkey D. Luffy   Monkey D. Dragon   Portgas D. Ace   Monkey D. Garp   Gol D. Roger  "
562,How do the Homunculi differ between the FMA manga and anime?,"I know that the actual characters who are the homunculi differ between the FMA manga and original anime. For instance, Sloth is a different person between the manga and the anime. However, do they differ in how they are created? If so, how do they differ? "
563,About Kizaru's attack on the Supernovas,"When Kizaru attacked Supernovas at Sabaody Archipelago, he beat some of them badly like X Drake, Basil Hawkins, Urouge and Scratchmen Appo. My question is: how did they manage to escape from Kizaru? In episodes, the scene ends with the (temporary) annihilation of the Straw Hats. But how did they manage to escape? Is it because of the Navy's carelessness? "
564,Is the Hyuuga main family's juinjutsu a Swastika?,"In Naruto, the Hyūga clan is divided into two houses: the main house and the branch house. The main house members brand the branch house members with a Juinjutsu (Cursed mark), which has the objective of sealing away the Byakugan upon the death of the one branded. It also has the function of controlling the branch house members through the destruction of the wearer's brain cells, which can be activated by a hand seal only known by the main house members.    The seal looks like this:      Although the Hyūga Main Family's Juinjutsu was altered in the anime for its resemblance with a swastika (and the connotation with the Nazi regime), the manga version maintains its original design.    Quoting directly from Wikipedia:       The word ""swastika"" comes from the Sanskrit swastika - ""su"" meaning ""good,"" ""asti"" meaning ""to be,"" and ""ka"" as a suffix. The swastika literally means ""to be good"". Or another translation can be made: ""swa"" is ""higher self"", ""asti"" meaning ""being"", and ""ka"" as a suffix, so the translation can be interpreted as ""being with higher self"".     Both these translations would fit (at least according to my interpretation) the secondary purpose of the Juinjutsu: - To be good: the secondary function of the Juinjutsu is to control the branch house members, which is to 'make them good' (at least to make them submit themselves to the main house members' will). - Being with higher self: the Juinjutsu links the branch house members ('lower self') with the main house members ('higher self').  Are there any canon sources that state: If this resemblance is purely coincidental? Or if the seal is really a swastika? "

566,How much is One Piece's currency worth?,"There are many transliterations of the currency: Berry, Beli, Berri.  Which one is the official one?

567,"What is the recommended order for watching ""Barakamon"" and ""Handa-kun""?","Barakamon was a highly rated Slice of Life Comedic show from Summer 2014 (Which I never got around to picking up). Handa-Kun aired much more recently (Summer 2016), but is described as a prequel to the original.  Is it required that I watch Barakamon before watching Handa-Kun? Are there any references in Handa-Kun that may spoil Barakamon?  "
568,"Why is Luffy's scar shaped ""X""?","I know that Luffy got his scar on his chest from Akainu from How did Luffy get the scar on his chest?. As mentioned on the linked question, Luffy got his scar because his chest got burnt by Akainu's magma fist.    In the end, his wound was like a burnt wound, that means his skin was scorched.    When his burnt wound healed, why is his scar shaped like ""X"" like it was a wound of getting sliced by a sword? I thought the skin that was burnt will leave a scar like a ""burnt wound's scar"", not a ""cut off"" scar like that. "
569,"How different are the manga, anime and movie versions of Ajin?","Ajin is originally a manga, that has subsequently had a few adaptations into anime. In November 2015, it seems to have been adapted into a movie: Ajin Part 1: Shoudou (Ajin: Demi-Human - Compel). MAL's blurb for the movie reads:     For high schooler Kei—and for at least forty-six others—immortality comes as the nastiest surprise ever.      Sadly for Kei, such a feat doesn't make him a superhero. In the eyes of both the general public and governments, he's a rare specimen who needs to be hunted down and handed over to scientists to be experimented on for life—a demi-human who must die a thousand deaths for the benefit of humanity.   The movie lists two yet unreleased sequels: Ajin Part 2: Shoutotsu, set to be released in May 2016; and Ajin Part 3: Shougeki, set to be released in Seprember 2016. The blurb for these two is the same as the one for the first movie.  The manga was also adapted into an anime series, Ajin, released between January and April 2016 (the Winter 2016 season). This one lists the three movies as ""Alternative versions"", and its blurb reads:     Where there is life, there is death... or is there? What would you do if you could never die? The possibilities are endless.      Seventeen years ago, the existence of a special species called Ajin was discovered in Africa. They are said to be immortal beings, with several supernatural abilities, that look just like any other human being. Are these Ajin just random phenomena of nature or were they purposely sent to Earth to destroy it?      Since their first discovery, several other Ajin appearances have been reported worldwide. For the majority of citizens though, these creatures are less reality and more of something you see every once in a while in a textbook or on the news. This is how it was for the young protagonist of the series, Kei. That was until a sudden turn of events changed his life forever...      Ajin is a supernatural anime full of complex ideas about life and death, as well as the dark side of human nature. What does it mean to truly be human?   It's not entirely clear to me whether the first movie covers the anime series and the other two are new content, or whether the three movies are supposed to be recaps of the whole series (maybe there are supposed to be three anime seasons of Ajin, and each of the movies recaps one of them?).  What's the relation between the manga, the anime series, and the movies (given that two of the three movies haven't been released yet, that part may be harder to answer)? Are the adaptations faithful to the manga? "
570,"Who is Ichigo's Father, Isshin?","Though he is initially shown as a normal human, it is later revealed that he once had Shinigami powers, and later he is the only one      Who knows about Ichigo's true powers, and who tells Ichigo how to train for the last battle against Aizen.    But the The Lost Substitute Shinigami arc where       Ichigo fights Ginjo, it's revealed that Ginjo was the first Substitute Shinigami.   So what is Ichigo's father and why does he know what he knows? Also, why he doesn't seem to have any Shinigami powers, while he knows so much about them? "
571,How are manhwa and manhua received in Japan?,How popular are Korean manhwa and Chinese manhua in Japan?   Is there a market for them as localized manga? 
572,Who are the two ladies in Major Kusanagi's apartment?,"In episode 5 when Major Kusanagi is reviewing the original Laughing Man incident footage in her own apartment, two girls can be seen with her. One bringing over a cocktail and then both unknown girls sleeping near Matoko on the bed.  One appears to be dressed a a maid, and for giving Major her drink I assume she's her personal maid bot.     The other girl's outfit I can't identify. She has dark hair. The maid has brighter colored hair.    Once again in episode 20 we see the bright-haired girl talking to Major while she's preparing to switch bodies. Apparently the body switching procedure requires for a witness. We also know that cloned people cannot inherit real estate. I'm not sure if these factors are connected, but something tells me a bot wouldn't be a legible witness for body switching. Possibly the girls are people, not androids.    Who are these two girls? Are they people or are they androids? What are their names? What are their responsibilities? "
573,Why there was only one episode of Black Clover?,"I have been following the manga of Black Clover and so far after few months, I came to know that there is an anime adaptation going on for this series.  When the first episode came, I was too excited that it started in anime but after 1 episode it's saying that the status is completed.   So why there was only 1 episode released for Black Clover? Is it true that status is completed? Also, are we expecting any more episodes in future? "
574,"Has the ""It's over 9000!"" meme spread back to Japan?","Has the ""It's over 9000!"" meme from DBZ spread back into Japan? Is it referenced in other manga or anime? If it is, do they use 9000 (which is, depending on who you ask, a translation error or an intentional mistranslation) or 8000? "
575,Why is Ichigo always in Shikai mode?,"Other shinigami are always in normal mode, and then when needed, transform into Shikai or Bankai modes. But as soon as Ichigo leaned Bankai mode he never went back to normal mode. Or maybe he is always in normal mode and he always skips Shikai and goes straight into Bankai mode? Why is he different? "
576,Who are the people that know how to use Kaio-Ken?,"Are Kakaroto (Goku) and Kaiō-sama (King Kai) the only people that know how to use the Kaio-Ken?   Did Kaiō-sama teach his technique for others beside Goku? For example, while training Krillin and the others. "
577,"Where did the nickname ""Poppo"" comes from?","We know that all of them have a nickname, but I don't understand Poppo's nickname.   Yadomi Jinta = Jintan Honma Meiko = Menma Anjou Naruko = Anaru Matsuyuki Atsumu = Yukiatsu Tsurumi Chiriko = Tsuruko Hisakawa Tetsudou = Poppo??   Does it have something to do with his name in Japanese characters? "
578,What kind of luck are Hanako and Botan getting in the opening?,"In the opening sequence of Anne-Happy, Hanako and Botan are both shown holding omikuji, those little papers that Japanese people draw at shinto shrines that forecast their luck.     I know that omikuji have different types and levels of luck, and given that the theme of the series is unlucky moe girls, I assume Hanako and Botan are both getting bad luck. But just how bad is it? Which exact classes of omikuji did they draw? "
579,How to summon a different animal using Kuchiyose?,"As we know, every ninja needs to sign a contract to summon an animal. However, Sasuke suddenly summoned a hawk, after summoning snakes all the time.  How can someone change the animal he summons?       I know that with Keiyaku Fūin, the contract can be broken, but I guess that works a little bit different, not?  "
580,What is Takumi's position in the Walker Family?,"After some time, it is discovered that Takumi Usui is member of the Walker Family. The family connection, however, is unclear.  What's the Takumi's position in the Walker Family? How can he become the Walker Family heir? "
581,Why do light novels tend not to be animated directly?,"Based on the answer to this question, it seems that light novels that are turned into anime are generally made into manga first (eg Haruhi Suzumiya). There are some exceptions, such as Love, Chunibyo &amp; Other Delusions where an ONA was released of it before a full anime and Toaru Hikūshi e no Koiuta where the manga began a month after the anime. A lot of other LNs are never turned into anime at all, including ones that exist in otherwise existing anime canons (eg the light novels set in the Naruto canon).   Are the ones that are made into a manga first done so to determine if they'll be financially successful in visual form, and that's why they're not made directly into anime? Why then would ones that are part of popular series (Naruto, Death Note, etc.) not be made into anime? Is there a reason why we so rarely if ever see light novels turned directly into anime? "
582,"Origin of the phrase ""Hyuga are Konoha's strongest""",I have seen it being used in the episodes where Konoha was invaded by Orochimaru when Hinata's father engages the enemy stating that. Now I see that being used in the current ninja war when Neji remarks to Naruto about that?   Is there any basis for the origin of this phrase in the manga or anime anywhere regarding the strength of Hyuga clan? 
583,"Why does Suzuha disappear when travelling back to the ""present""?","In the episode before the last one, why does Suzuha disappear when travelling back to the ""present""?  From what I've read, going back in a time machine always changes the world line, and in the world line where Okabe saves Kris the time machine no longer exists therefore time travelling Suzuha doesn't exist.  However I don't see this explanation working without her disappearing as soon as they appear back in the past. It is not their returning to the future that changes the outcome (and subsequently the timeline), it's their actions in the past.  How can this be explained with consistency with the rest of the rules of time travel we've encountered in this show? If any assumption I've made is incorrect I'd love to hear it. "
584,What is the name of the heroine in Amnesia?,"Okay, So I haven't played the latest otome game of Amnesia yet because it hasn't come out which is Amnesia- World yet and I am not sure whether I will be able to get a PC version of it and the anime stopped with the heroine actually returning back to her own world, so it didn't quite cover as much as it did in the game.  There is however one element throughout the anime and the games so far that remained the same, her name.  So what is her name? Is she known as anything else other than ""heroine""? "
585,What happened to Ichigo in Urahara's training area after meeting Byakuya (for the first time)?,"I understand that during his initial training with Urahara something occurred that gave him (or awoke in him)       hollow powers,   but hardly anything is said on the matter. And how come nothing like this never happened before, to the point of Urahara trying to make it possible. For Ichigo just happened?  And how does this play into      Aizen's initial plan. Did he influence this event too?  "
586,Why do all Dragon Slayers have Exceeds?,"As we see in the series, all Dragon Slayers (not God Slayers) who are trained by Dragons have Exceeds as partners.   Specifically there are 5 of them: Natsu, Gajeel, Wendy, Sting and Rogue. Now, Laxus is also a Dragon Slayer, but he was not trained by a Dragon and became a Dragon Slayer by Lacrima. Is this a coincidence? Or is there a reason behind it? "
587,What is the significance of Asuna's heterochromia?,"In Negima! Magister Negi Magi, we note that Asuna has heterochromia, with one green and one blue eye.  Here's a shot taken from official artwork.    However, in Negima!?, we note that she doesn't have it at all.  Here's a shot taken from the third (I think) episode.    What is the significance, if there is any, of Asuna's heterochromia?  Why wasn't it present in the second season? "
588,Why didn't Utena get involved in the council's duels sooner?,"In the first episode of Revolutionary Girl Utena, a teacher says ""You won't make a fool of me again this semester"", which indicates that Utena is not new to the school.  I'm rewatching the show, and my memories of the show assumed she was a transfer student. This made me wonder why she didn't get involved in the mechanizations of the student council sooner. She received the signet ring when she was young, and had been going to that school already.  Was there something special about that semester that triggered Utena's interest in the Rose Bride and the duels?  Is there any information on what happened with regards to the council prior to the start of the show?  Was this the first time Saionji won the duel, and the other council members aren't so abusive towards the Rose Bride, so they didn't attract Utena's attention? "
589,Would Historia Reiss become as big as Rod Reiss if she had turned into a titan?,"   The humans become Titans through the use of an injected medicine, and the Titan form they take is due to the type of medicine injected. Therefore, it can be deduced Bertolt Hoover got an injection that gave him the gigantic form.      Case evidence is Rod Reiss, who became a Titan that is even bigger than Bertolt after he licked the spilled injection that he was trying to give to Historia.   Source  If so, does that mean Historia Reiss would have become a titan of the same size (or maybe even bigger since she would have been injected with the whole serum unlike Rod Reiss that only licked a bit) as her father?  That would kill Eren and Rod seeing as everyone died when Ross transformed except the ones protected by the hardening ability and Kenny who managed to get out but died short after from injuries as seen in the recent episode.  She wouldn't even be able to eat Eren that way and take his titan shifting power and the coordinate since he would be vaporized by all the heat and burried under the wreckage. So she would stay as a mindless titan.  I don't think Rod would want to die by it too so either he didn't knew it would be that big since the other times the ceremony happened the titan was smaller, or she simply wouldn't become that big (for some unexplainable reason or something that I'm not aware of).  In the same topic, from the manga spoilers that I have seen:      If the mindless titans are in fact Marleyans traitors injected with the titan serum, shouldn't there exist some (during all these years) that would also become extremely bigger than the usual ones and become a threat to the walls?   My best guess is that this was missed out by the story writters, or that it would be explained in the future, or because the plot demanded it, or rule of cool. But I could be wrong.  This source, this one and this Reddit page might be important to the question. "
590,How popular is One Piece in Japan?,"It is a given that One Piece is immensely popular in Japan, but is there any statistical data indicating the scale of its popular it is (historically, with respect to other popular series) in Japan?

591,What makes Seras Victoria special?,"I've only watched Hellsing Ultimate. The Major recognizes Seras as a real threat when he warns Zorin before attacking Hellsing's manor. He calls her a miracle of sorts.  Sure enough, she's clearly stronger than most other vampires. But why? Was it simply the fact that Alucard himself transformed her? What made her special if she didn't even consume Alucard's blood? Why does the Major think so highly of her? "
592,What does 'moe' mean?,"I've now watched quite a few anime and I'm still at a loss as to what the term moe represents. Is there an agreed upon definition for it? If a character is moe, what does that mean? "
593,Why can't Earthland magicians use magic in Edolas without the X-balls?,"When Natsu, Wendy, Happy and Carla went to Edolas they couldn't use magic at first. Later Natsu and Wendy were given the X-balls to regain their magic usage. Yet even without the X-balls, Exceeds could use their magic. This is according to the wiki because they have their Magic located inside of their bodies just like the Mages of Earth Land.      Presumably, this is due to the fact that they are the only beings in Edolas whose Magic is located inside of their bodies, just like the Mages of Earth Land.   If both have their magic located within their bodies, then why are only the Exceeds able to use their magic, but Mages need those X-Balls?  Also related to this question, I was wondering why the Exceeds even lost their magic usage to begin with. It was said that they need to have the right mind-set to be able to use their magic, but when they entered Edolas for the first time, they didn't know magic was limited, so they were supposed to have the ""right mind-set"" at that time right? So why did they lose their magic usage when they arrived? "
594,Who are these people in the Kuzu no Honkai drama CDs?,"The first track on the first drama CD for Kuzu no Honkai is titled ""Nyan Nyan Prelude"". It features characters named ""Checo""(?) and ""Shuu"", the former of whom might or might not literally be a cat.   To summarize: the track begins with them doing lewd things (as is Kuzu no Honkai's wont). Checo says she'll get a job, but Shuu says she can't, because she's a cat. Shuu forgets her birthday, and they get into a fight. They reminisce about the days when their relationship was all sunshine and roses. At the end of the track, they reconcile.  I don't know who these characters are. Nothing in this track (nor the next one, ""Nyan Nyan Serenade"") has anything to do with any of the characters or events featured in the anime, even though the narrative ""feels"" like that of Kuzu no Honkai. I'm thoroughly confused. Who are these people, and what does any of this have to do with Kuzu no Honkai? "
595,How does Natalia get from the baggage compartment to the cockpit?,"In Episode 19 of Fate Zero, Natalia is in the baggage compartment when the ghoul (bees) take over the cabin.  How does she manage to safely get into the cockpit?    AFAIK, there is no way to get directly into the cockpit without going through the cabin. Thus it would be next to impossible for her to get into the cockpit without being overwhelmed by the bees.    Does the Manga shed any light on this? "

599,Is Misa Amane's early death a plothole in Death Note?,"According to the wiki, when a Shinigami dies, their remaining lifespan is given to the human they saved.     Shinigami who die are reduced to dust, and their remaining lifespan is given to the human they saved.   Since Rem killed L and Watari, she gained their remaining lifespans. Additionally she probably still had some lifespan left. On top of that Misa was already given a lot of lifespan from Gelus (from which she lost 75% again). So does this mean all of this lifespan is transferred to Misa Amane?!  Yet according to her wiki page, she dies in 2011 at the age of 26, only seven years after Rem died.  Does this mean that humans are also capable of reducing their own lifespans? Or would the author have made a mistake by letting Misa die as early as she has? I know she lost 75% of her remaining lifespan through the two eye deals, but you'd think that the cumulation of L, Watari and Rem's remaining lifespans would be greater than just one year, wouldn't you?

603,How much is the casting time of Super Tier Magic and why Ainz used a cash item to speed up Iä Shub-Niggurath spell?,"I'm not sure where I have heard that is about a minute of casting time but I'm looking for some evidence to prove that statement.  Where it was said the casting time of super tier magic and how much it is?  Also, in the case isn't much (like a minute). Spoiler alert Anime 3rd season cap 12:      Why does Ainz Ooal Gown used a cash item to instantly speed up the casting time of the Iä Shub-Niggurath super tier magic if no one would attack him?  No one on the new world knows what is super tier magic, nor they have the necessary strength to stop him. So why he sacrificed a cash item that he would never recover just to cast it faster? If he had fear that the enemy could attack him, he could use his army to buy some (a lot) of time.

If Gemini can make duplicate keys, could Lucy hypothetically summon the Spirit King with all of her keys and then just use the Gemini copies afterwards? "
605,Did Jiraiya meet Naruto by chance?,"According to the Naruto Wiki page on Jiraiya, he      ""left Konoha so he could follow Orochimaru's movements, as well as those of ""Akatsuki"", an organization which Orochimaru had eventually joined.""     Orochimaru was at Konoha during the Chuunin Exam Arc, making his first appearance (as far as I remember) during the second phase (in the Forest of Death). Jiraiya made his first appearance between the preliminaries and the finals (in chapter 90). There is a fairly short period of time between these two appearances.    We quickly see that Jiraiya knows who Naruto is, as he is trying to control his chakra to walk on water (in chapter 91). He first notices something when he sees Naruto trying to walk on water:  We then have a full confirmation that he knows who he is:  In this chapter he also notices that there is some weird overlaying of seals, which he deduces was Orochimaru's work.    Now, my question is: Did Naruto and Jiraiya meet by chance, as Jiraiya was tracking down Orochimaru's movements? (in which case Jiraiya only knew who Naruto was after seeing the seal in his stomach) Or did he know who Naruto was before having seen him trying to walk on water, and tracked him down? (possibly to protect him from Orochimaru, and in which case he would've been watching over Naruto since his parents died)   "
606,What's the correct pronunciation for Luffy or Rufi?,"What's the correct pronunciation of his name? Luffy or Rufi?  At the One Piece wikia, it says ""Monkey D. Luffy (モンキー･D･ルフィ Monkī D. Rufi)"". "
607,Why is there consistent seasonal variability in the quality of anime?,"Recall that the anime industry produces TV anime according to a 4-season schedule: winter (Jan-Mar), spring (Apr-Jun), summer (Jul-Sep), and fall (Oct-Dec).   Since at least 2010 (and perhaps even before than that), there have been consistent differences in the average quality1 of anime released in each season.2 The details are open to argument, but most commentators will agree that spring is consistently the best season of anime in any given year, while winter is the worst.3 My personal impression is that on average, spring > fall > summer > winter.   It is not surprising that seasonal trends would exist - in Hollywood, for example, all the big ""blockbusters"" come out in the summer, and it seems that January and February are off-months for the industry (or so this article claims).   The real question, though, is why? What is it about winter that makes it the dumping ground for lousy anime? What is it about spring that gets the anime industry to put out good content?     1 When I talk about ""quality"" here, I'm basically talking about Rotten Tomatoes ratings - an aggregate of opinions from critical reviewers and ordinary consumers. Quality may not be objectively measurable, but quality-as-perceived-by-the-consumer certainly is. Technical merits of the production (e.g. sakuga, sound direction, etc.) are important in this context only insofar as they factor into the ""Rotten Tomatoes ratings"" here.  2 For ease, let's restrict ourselves to thinking about anime that run for one year or less (so no Naruto, Bleach, Yugimanz, etc.), and treat anime as belonging exclusively to the season in which they began airing (so e.g. all of Shingeki no Kyojin counts as a spring anime).   3 I can substantiate this claim if need be, both by reference to user ratings on sites like MAL and by reference to more subjective impressions by commentators who know a thing or two about anime. That said, I'm sure those of you who have a finger on the pulse of the anime-osphere probably have more or less the same impression.  "
608,How can Angels Spirits disobey her?,"In Lucy's fight with Angel the Gemini transform into Lucy and it makes her spirits do whatever she says, but when Angels spirits learn about Lucy's love for spirits they start disobeying Angel how does that work? Shouldn't they be under the same I can't disobey my master rule? "
609,Luffy as a water balloon,"We discussed a lot about drowning devil fruit users in a bath - see this question: Can a Devil Fruit user drown in a bathtub?.   So now I remembered the fight between Luffy and Crocodile. To have a chance, Luffy drank a lot of water and was like a water ballon. But why didn't this affect his strength?  Does he have to be surrounded by water?   "
610,Inconsistent D-mail Dates in Steins;Gate Season 1 and Steins;Gate 0,"In episode 23 of the original series, Okabe receives a D-mail from 2025 which triggers him try again to save Kurisu and enter Steins Gate.    In episode of 23 of Steins;Gate 0 we see the same scene:    There's a clear discrepancy here. The year in the date.  The text ""受信日時"" translates to ""Reception date and time"".  Questions:   When receiving D-mails, which date is supposed to be used? The sending world line's date? Or the receiving world line's date? Normally, this doesn't matter since the send and receive dates will be almost the same for electronic communication. Is this discrepancy intentional? Or is it a goof? If it is intentional, is there yet another world line change hidden underneath that we don't know yet? (The ending of Steins;Gate 0 left plenty of room for a 3rd season.)  "
611,Can I increase my lifespan by killing myself using the Death Note?,"Suppose I wrote that I will be killed by a UFO falling from space in the year 2315 while I am lifting.  Will the Note increase my lifespan? In other words, will I still be alive by then?  "
612,Clarification on clan formation?,"On what basis were the clans formed in naruto?  The blood siblings Indra and Ashura are from different clans (Uchiha &amp; Senju respectively)., whereas other siblings, e.g. Itachi and Sasuke are from the same clan (Uchiha).   The first shinobi who got chakra was Kaguya. So, technically whoever posesses chakra should've inherited it from her. In that case, all should be from the same clan.  Now, here's my long time doubt. How is it decided that Naruto is from the Uzumaki clan when his father is from the Namikaze family and has no clan?   Is a person's clan decided based on the abilities of the person? If yes, how is their ability evaluated right after they are born? "
613,Is it explained anything about what turned the cellphone-microphone into a time machine? (not how it is operated),"So they created a time machine with a microwave and a cellphone. As far as I've seen in the anime series, something it is explained about how to operate it, but do the characters ever explain something about what makes it work? Do they give any Physics related explanation about what made the microwave and cellphone capable of sending things into the past? "
614,Is the Legendary Super Saiyan (green) transformation limitless in power?,"So now that both Broly, and Kale, who has a transformation which looks exactly like Broly's, have been quoting saying both the same ""My Ki is building... Overflowing..."" and that Kyabe tells Kale ""stop gathering ki!"", this topic comes to talk again. Is Broly and now Kale legendary super saiyan transformation limitless in power? This has been talked before with Broly's movies, but the last episode of Dragon Ball Super brings new information to the topic. What about the other canon sources like the Daizenshuu, does it say something about it? "
615,Who else was in on Lelouch's Zero Requiem plan?,"I was reviewing Code Geass and a subject came to my mind, that I explain below.      In the ending is stated that Lelouch caused the world to hate him on purpose, so it would not engage wars anymore, however, few people knowed this directly (Suzaku, Jeremiah and CC), and is stated that some people discovered Lelouch true intentions by his death.   On my first view of the anime, I thought that Nunnally and Kallen discovered the real intentions behind Lelouch's plan, but now, seems to me that Tohdoh, Cornelia, Milly and Kaguya as well found the true ambition of Lelouch.   So, was anyone else in on it? Am I correct in speculations?      Who really discovered why Lelouch had to die?  "
616,Is there any precedent for the child of two chakra types?,"We've established that chakra element is hereditary (I.e. Sasuke got fire from his parents, etc.). Is there any precedent for what happens when parents with different elements have a kid? Does one element ""win"" and become the one that the child has, or does the child get both? "
617,Is the Makkachin tissue box based on Yuzuru Hanyu's tissue box?,"In Yuri!!! on ICE, Viktor has a tissue box in the shape of his dog Makkachin, which he uses when coaching Yuuri. Is there any indication whether this is based on Yuzuru Hanyu's Pooh Bear tissue box? Have any statements been made by the creators about that?  "
618,Why did Akagi leave the opportunity to have a better hand in his first game?,"I have watched just the anime, and even if he didn't know about specific hands, he leaves the chance to gather the bonus tiles and improve his hand, as Nangou remarked.  Am I missing something here? Being the genius that he is, should he not have played better? "

Please, can you give me any example and why? many thanks. (: "
621,Why couldn't Celty find what she was looking for?,"In the anime,      What kept Celty from getting her head back?    Out of everything in this particular anime, this is the only thing I still don't grasp.  Can anyone shed some light on this for me? "
622,What was Izumi doing in the Central City railway station?,"While watching ep. 9 of Brotherhood, I noticed that when Winry came to Central City railway station and started looking for someone, Izumi and her husband were walking behind her:  Picture from FMA brotherhood.    After that I tried for this scene in the 2003 series, and in ep. 23 I have found this scene where they were reading something at the Central railway station:  Picture from Anime FMA 2003    So my question is: what might Izumi and her husband be doing there? Do they usually travel like this, or might there be any sort of work they had to do there? Is it also possible that it is an error (like they didn't want to put those characters there)? "
623,What happened to the barrier at the end of Digimon Tamers?,"Warning! This question contains spoilers; most are tagged, but the question's very substance is itself a spoiler.  In one of the final scenes of Digimon Tamers, the entire cast is seen together:     The kids are standing around the portal between the Real World and Digital World, and their Digimon--as well as Calumon and Impmon--are sucked into the portal to return to the Digital World.   Following this, after some time had passed, Takato returned to Guilmon's hole under the ""house"" in the park, where he found a portal to the Digital World, which we are to assume works just fine.   (A more expansive explanation can be found in the last two paragraphs of this synopsis.)  Firstly, how can the Real-Digital barrier—which Henry's dad says has ""stabilized""—regress the Digimon? A barrier, by definition, should act as a split between the worlds, rather than a ""vacuum"". And second, if the barrier is so stable, why is Takato able to see it open again? "
624,What are the answers to the riddles?,"In Akuma No Riddle, each episode contains one riddle - Usually In the episode title or texted to Azuma.

626,Who is this goggles-wearing character from the second My Hero Academia S3 intro?,"The second opening of My Hero Academia S3 features three rapid-fire shots of a red-haired character wearing goggles and a very smug grin (YouTube reference):    These shots are placed right after the title card, implying he's going to be a significant character in the Provisional License Exam arc, but I don't recall him actually appearing at any point. I waited until the final episode came out to ask this, just in case he showed up towards the end of the season, but as far as I can tell, he still hasn't.  I check through the lists of MHA characters on both MyAnimeList and TV Tropes, and couldn't find him on either of them.  Who is this guy? And if he didn't appear, or appeared so briefly that I forgot about him, what's the significance of his appearance in the intro? "
627,How does GunBuster become Dix-Neuf?,"At the risk of going into anime physics, how does GunBuster become Dix-Neuf?  My understanding of the series is that GunBuster, the first Buster Machine ever created, was used in the final battle of GunBuster to drop off its Degeneracy Generator. It then limped back to Earth and appeared 15,000 years later  Then in DieBuster timeline you eventually figure out that Dix-Neuf, a Buster Machine with a number in the teens, has been slowly upgraded and rebuilt over a long period of time and is missing its own Degeneracy Generator. Because of that I assumed that Dix-Neuf and GunBuster are the same.  However, how did GunBuster become Dix-Neuf if GunBuster is still floating in space? What's the connection between the two machines? "
628,How many attacks can the Eight Trigram justu go up to?,"The Eight Trigram justu is a taijustu that uses the Gentle Fist style, which is passed down in main branch of the Hyūga clan. In both the original and Shippuden, Neji uses this ability multiple times through the series.  So far, we have seen 16 Palms, 32 Palms, 64 Palms, and 128 Palm (which is only seen during Neji's fight with Kidomaru.)  In that pattern, the amount of attacks are doubled for each variation. Is Eight Trigram justu limited to 128 attacks? If not, what is the highest number attacks it can go? "
629,Where does God Eater (Anime) fall in the God Eater videogame (Burst) timeline?,"According to God Eater's Entry in Wikipedia:     God Eater (Anime) is an anime adaptation of the God Eater video game series.    and in GodEater's Entry in myanimelist.net     Set in a post-apocalyptic Japan in the year 2071. The world has been mostly destroyed by mysterious monsters known as the Aragami. An organization known as Fenrir was made to exterminate Aragami using 'God Arcs', weapons made from Aragami cells. Those who specialize in exterminating Aragami are known as God Eaters. Their God Arcs originally could only keep a single form, however a new type has been discovered that can switch between gun and blade form. Since then, they have been classified new-types and the previous as old-types.   I have already Played the GE Burst in the PSP up until the last chapter which is 10. I've already watched the God Eater Prologue and I plan to watch God Eater Anime.  The anime is said to be based off the video Games.  so does it follow the story of one of the videogames? (i.e. GE Burst)  The Cast consist of the same characters in the videogame except the New-type guy. however, this rather is similar in GEB which you will play as one of the new-types in the game. Is God Eater a remake of the videoGame or does it tackle the same story in the videogame.  Would it be a waste to watch the anime if I have already finished the game? Could you give me at least a short insight to what I can hope to watch in this anime without giving spoilers.  Thanks for your time :) "

We see he transform in Oozaru, an orange Oozaru many including myself have assumed to be the golden oozaru (saiyan + oozaru transformation) but he never transforms first into a super saiyan for later turning into an oozaru, and whe he turns back to human form after Fu made the artificial moon disappear, he doesnt retain his supposed super saiyan transformation. Could it be that his oozaru form is not the golden oozaru form but the regular oozaru form and that he can't transform into a supersaiyan?  "

Remember the scene, Jiraiya pushed Naruto off the cliff! or Naruto in tailed beast form when got stuck in Pain's Chibaku-tensai. They seem to have long time conversation among themselves isn't it?  How much time does it take to fall from a cliff to hit the ground… But Naruto and jinchuriki take their own time to come to an understanding. Same thing goes while Naruto has conversation with Kyubi, Kushina and Minato for long time! it takes several minutes but in reality it wouldn't be more than few seconds.  How is the time managed? "

635,Is Trunks stuck at SSJ form?,"In DBZ, Future Trunks was a Super Saiyan. In DBS, we see his evolution going up to SSJGSSJ. When he is prepared to go back in time to save the world from Frieza, is he still SSJ? He didn't seem to train enough to attain a new form.

Then a day passes and he transfers his  memories back again. Another day passes and he transfers his memories again. And so on. Many days have passed but he returns to a body which recently slept (one day ago probably) but his mind havent slept for many days. Is it supposed he's a day tired or dozens of days tired?

Is it more a 'title' or 'status' for these villages? "
639,Would Naruto awaken the Rinnegan if he takes the Sharingan from Sasuke?,"The reason I ask this is because I think the only important things to awaken Rinnegan is to have Indra and Ashura's chakra. Someone will say that the requirement is Uchiha and Senju's chakra. However, Obito had both of them, but he didn't awaken the Rinnegan.  Why didn't Obito awaken Rinnegan? Would Naruto awaken the Rinnegan if he takes the Sharingan from Sasuke? "
640,What happened to Nausicaa at the end of the movie?,"In the final act of Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind,       the titular character gets trampled by the Ohmu stampede and lies motionless. The Ohmu then stop their attack, pick her body up, and do something which wakes her up again.    I seem to remember Miyazaki stating that he disliked that people found Messianic overtones in the movie.      Did Nausicaa die, and get resurrected by the Ohmu? Or was she simply badly hurt and the Ohum healed her?  "
641,What is this old Anime set in prehistoric times?,"I watched it as a kid in the early 90's but the style was a bit older. It was on VHS.  The title was something like: Ray/Rei the hero? of the jungle? but it was a dubbed version so I'm not sure. The protagonist is Ray? a young man. He has black hair and wears yellow furs. I don't remember the plot but he travels with his friends in a prehistoric world.  I remember two scenes:  Somewhere in the middle of the movie - they are on a raft on a lake and under them is a ginormous dinosaur. I guess it emerges from the water causing them to ride the wave and scream.  Towards the very end - there is a village where a volcano is about to erupt so they want to sacrifice a girl to it: that would be the friend of the protagonist and the granddaughter of the old woman who wants to sacrifice her.   Beware Spoilers!      Volcano erupts, girl gets killed somehow I think in a fight, someone lays the girl down on the ground with the volcano with flowing lava in the background, old woman is praying to the volcano. And my friend's mom turned off the TV saying ""you shouldn't watch films like this"" (well, too late) and I never knew the end.

643,"By number of series, how much of the animation industry is made up by anime?","Today a friend of mine proclaimed that around 70% of the world's cartoon animation entertainment consists of anime. So according to his statement, for every 3 non anime animation series, at least 7 anime series should exist.  After looking through his proclaimed source wikipedia I could only find out that about 70% of DVD sales are made by anime, which sounds reasonable, but does not back up his 3 to 7 cartoon to anime series ratio at all.  Now I know that anime is well-known, even around the world. But claiming that around 2/3 of all cartoon animation series is anime sounds a bit of an overkill to me.   This however made me wonder, what is the ratio of non anime cartoon series to cartoon series, or how much do anime series (roughly) make up of animation entertainment series overall?  Although the first few animes were already observed as far back as 1907, anime really launched around 1960 after/during Astro Boy, and as new series are made just about everyday for both anime and non-anime alike, I would propose a time limit of 1960 till 2015.  TL;DR What is the ratio of anime series versus non anime series? "
644,How do you spell Marry Kozakura's name in English?,"I've been using ""Marry"" up until now, but it just occurred to me that I don't know for sure if that's the best choice.  As I understand it, the spelling of her name varies a lot across translations. I've seen ""Marry"", ""Mary"", and ""Marie"" being used. Also, in Japanese, her given name is 茉莉, which I've seen get read as both まり and マリー.  So, is there a particular spelling that is more commonly used or more official than the others? Or are they about the same? How do the translators' choices for her name compare between the songs, the manga, the light novel, the anime, and other supplementary material? "
645,Why are characters named Momonga named after flying squirrels?,"In both One Piece and in Overlord, there is a character named Momonga (in Overlord, Momonga was his earlier name, but he goes by Ainz Ooal Gown during the series).     「モモンガ」 (momonga) is the Japanese word for ""flying squirrel"" and is used for the type native to Japan, as well as for the northern flying squirrel and southern flying squirrel of North America, and for the Siberian dwarf flying squirrel (in contrast, the word 「ムササビ」 [musasabi] is used to refer to giant flying squirrels native to and outside of Japan), and the marsupial sugar glider is called 「フクロモモンガ」 (fukuro momonga).  These characters both are not particularly cute, are large in size, have small eye sockets, and do not feature a patagium (a.k.a. gliding membrane-like flap of skin or fabric stretched from their wrists to their ankles). In other words, they do not feature the best-known features of flying squirrels. Why were they named Momonga?  Is there anything about them that was intentionally derived from real-life flying squirrels?   "

647,What exactly is Sugimoto's relationship to Kawasaki?,"In chapters 18-19 of Aoi Hana, it is revealed that the third-year Yasuko Sugimoto is moving to England with Ayako Kawasaki, her co-star in Fujigaya's production of Wuthering Heights. The discussion surrounding this revelation gives a romantic undertone to this relationship &mdash; a newspaper headline is shown with ""Catherine Heathcliff Honeymoon in England."" It is unclear whether this should be taken any more seriously than straight teenage girls who proclaim to be ""married to"" or ""engaged to"" or ""dating"" their close female friends. (I personally assumed that there was potential for a relationship, but that it probably would not develop in that direction.)  Later, during Akira and Fumi's second year, Sugimoto visits Japan and has a conversation with Kyouko Ikumi in ch. 32, in which Kawasaki is mentioned:     Ikumi: &hellip; And do you have any plans with Kawasaki-sempai?      Sugimoto: Huh? I see her all the time over there. I'm not going to go out of my way to see her here.      Ikumi: So that's how things are between you? How nice. I like that sort of relationship.      Sugimoto: Well, we're taking it slow over there &hellip; Letting our love blossom.   Sugimoto's final comment suggested to me that there is indeed something between her and Kawasaki. However, in ch. 52, which depicts the events around Ikumi's wedding, we are told that Kawasaki is in the hospital with appendicitis. We also learn from Ryouko Ueda that:     Right now, her boyfriend and her roommate are looking after her [Kawasaki].   The panel also shows a character who clearly is not Sugimoto and who is probably male.  With this in mind, was Sugimoto ever romantically involved with Kawasaki, and if so, do we know anything about what happened to their relationship or why Kawasaki now has a boyfriend? Alternatively, am I misinterpreting something in the exchange with Ikumi? "
648,Aptitude for Busoshoku?,My question is about busoshoku haki or coat of arms as people like to call it. Until the last episode I thought haki was something that required intensive training to master. But in the last episode   For those who haven't watched spoilers:     Sabo was shown wielding busoshoku against a small army at 17.    Now I only started reading the manga in the zou arc so I'm not sure if this is filler or cannon but is it safe to assume then that some people just have an aptitude for mastering buso quickly? I mean only a small percentage of people are capable of using haoshoku so it seems like it makes sense.   But it took Luffy two years to perfect it and I'm not even sure if Ace ever learned it. Does anyone have any feedback on this?

Furthermore in episode 8,      She gets a body.     Questions are:   Is Kazuki's body in episode 8 her original body at the time of her ""death"" preserved through the years? Or was it newly grown in a laboratory? Is there any hard evidence suggesting either?   Kazuki's body doesn't seem to have aged though it may be difficult to tell. Either way, that doesn't give any new information.   A cryopreserved body would retain the original age. Likewise a body in a vegetative state would continue to age at the normal rate. A newly grown body can be given an arbitrary look and age.  "
651,Why Sanji is missing so much in the manga?,An announcement came at the annual One Piece Super Stage Event last December that promised to change all that. The staff and Sir Eiichiro Oda assured fans that Sanji will return in 2016 with an origin story. Sanji's voice actor Hiroaki Hirata will also return. But still nothing for Sanji he is still missing.  Why this will be? Is it possible that he is a weak one amoung straw hats?

654,What monster is inside Sasuke?,"Can explain to me the fight between Sasuke and Naruto? Naruto had the nine-tails inside him and showed vigorous power, but how did Sasuke end up being so strong? How did he turn into a bird-like thingy?   My overall question is: What monster is inside Sasuke that makes him this powerful? That isn't a tailed beast ... I guess? "
655,"Why all the ""Re"" in titles?","There have been quite a number of series whose English titles use peculiar forms of Re. I don't mean normal usages like Rebirth or Requiem. Here's some I chose from an alphabetical listing at MAL:   Re Boot Re-Kan Re: Cutie Honey Re:_Hamatora Re:Creators RE:Map Re:Zero (and several spin-off series) ReLIFE Rewrite (although normal, seems to conceptually fit here) Re:Monster Tokyo Ghoul:re   It is likely that some of these are just using the prefix ""re"" as often done in English, to mean either ""again"" or ""concerning"". What makes these seem odd to me is the variety of ways they use off-kilter orthography. Is it done as a marketing ploy to attract attention?  Or is there some underlying Japanese concept that maps particularly well to English ""Re""?  A Japanese student grows up learning three alphabets (two Japanese and the Latin one) plus Kanji. I wonder sometimes if this variety can lead them to think flexibly in how they choose to build titles in English. "
656,Which Black Jack anime most closely follows the manga?,"I love the manga, Black Jack, by Osamu Tezuka; it is truly a masterpiece.   Well, I want to watch the anime, so I looked it up on Wikipedia. Unfortunately, there are multiple animes, apparently. There is a   1993 OVA series, containing 10 episodes; 2001 ONA series, containing 12 episodes; 2004 TV series, containing 61 (or is it 62?) episodes.   Frankly, I'm stumped. I just want to watch the anime adaptation of the manga, and I'm unsure which one is most true to the manga, and I don't feel like watching all 3 of these.  So, which one is most an anime adaptation of the manga? "
657,Why does Ed and Al's mom cost so much to transmute?,"I get it's all equivalent exchange ,but logic dictates that to bring a soul you must lose a soul (Al's) and to make the materials into a body you would need to destroy a body (Al's again) but why was Ed's leg taken?  I mean if it was about the size of the person they should both be disintergrated and there mom alive. But it seems arguably more than enough to bring her back. And I get that the point of human transmutation is that it is impossible to bring someone back from the dead, but shouldn't Ed be unscathed? "

Does this transformation already have an official name? (from japanese magazines, previews, etc.?)   "
660,What is Tsumugi's gender?,"What is Tsumugi's gender? I know that she is created from Hoshijiro's placenta and shares the same seiyuu, but does that also means that they are of the same gender? Was there any evidence that shows that Tsumugi is a female?  I know that Nagate is in love with Tsumugi as Tsumugi was born from placenta Hoshijiro, but since IRL same gender relationship do exist, I don't think this can be used to prove that Tsumugi is a female. "
661,Why do anime mothers often get the short end of the stick?,"In a significant amount of anime, the protagonist (and possibly others) experience one of the following parental situations:   Both parents are dead and are inconsequential to the story. Both parents are dead, but one was more consequential to the story than the other. Based on my experience, it's usually the father. Both parents are alive and are relatively normal. Both parents are alive, but one is more consequential to the story than the other.  One parent is absent from the story, or dead. The other is still alive, and is usually more consequential to the story.   I'm going to name some examples, and assign them a letter according the scenarios I described above.   One Piece - 5. Luffy, Usopp, Shirahoshi, and Rebecca's mothers are all either dead, or absent from the story. Their fathers are all alive and very relevant. Ace's situation would fall under 2. His mother was largely normal, while his father is the pirate king and the catalyst for the whole story. Fullmetal Alchemist - 5. Mother is dead, while father remains a somewhat prominent figure in the story. Attack on Titan - 2. Both parents are dead, but the father had a much larger impact on the story. Bleach - 5. Mother is dead, while father remains relevant to the story. Berserk - 5. Mother is dead. His adoptive father is short-lived, but he still had an impact on Guts' life. Cardcaptor Sakura - 5. Mother is dead, while father is alive and kinda relevant to the plot. Fairy Tail - 5. Lucy's mother is dead, but her dad is alive for a good chunk of the story. Medaka Box - 5. Father is alive and influential. Shokugeki no Soma - 5. Mother is absent, but his dad is far more influential to the story thus far. Ouran High School Host Club - 5. Mother is dead. Sweetness and Lightning - 5. Mother is dead, dad is one of the MC's. Garo: Divine Flame - 5. Mother is dead, father is quite relevant to the plot. Katekyo Hitman Reborn! - 4. His mom is pretty normal, while his dad has actual ties to the mafia world, which is relevant to the plot. The Prince of Tennis - 4. Ryoma's dad is a former pro, while his mom is an attorney. Being an attorney is still pretty badass, but his dad is far more consequential in the story, since it is about tennis after all. Boruto: Naruto Next Generations - 4. Boruto's dad is a powerful ninja and the Hokage, while his mom is just a housewife. Naruto - 2. While both parents were strong while alive, his dad, Minato, was the stronger, and had a larger impact on the story, being the Hokage and all. Beelzebub - 3. His parents are background characters, usually for comic relief. My Hero Academia - 5. For the most part, Deku's parents are support characters. However, his mother gives him parental support, while his father is working away from home. The Disastrous Life of Saiki K. - 3. His parents are background characters, usually for comic relief. Avatar: The Last Airbender - 5. I know it's not a Japanese anime, but I'm going to include it. Katara and Sokka's mother is dead, but their father is alive and well, and a prominent figure in the Water Tribes.   Kill la Kill is an interesting example. It doesn't fall under any of the scenarios I listed, since the mother is alive, more powerful than the father, and is super relevant to the plot. However, she's the final villain. I guess it'd be nice to have a character like her who isn't a villain, is what I'm saying.  That's definitely not all the examples, but it's just a few. Whenever an anime character has a missing/dead parent, chances are very high that it's the mother. If both parents are alive, it's usually the father who is more relevant to the story. If it's a shounen/seinen series, the father is usually stronger and/or more relevant than the mother.  My question: Why do anime mothers get the short end of the stick? In many stories, the mother is dead (Bleach). If they're not dead, then they're largely irrelevant (Katekyo Hitman Reborn). If it's a shounen series, they're often weaker than the father (Naruto and Boruto). If not, then they're the villain (Kill la Kill).  How come there's not as many series where the mother is the living parent, is relevant to the plot, is not a villain, and is the stronger parent in the case of shounen/seinen? The father tends to get all the spotlight. Personally, I would love to see more badass mothers in anime.    Disclaimer: These are all generalizations. I know that not every anime is like this, but I've observed it in enough series that I thought it was worth asking a question about. I also realize that my observations are biased mostly in shounen anime. I tried throwing in a couple of shoujo, but this largely remains a shounen trope. "
662,How did the World Government know about the clash between Revolutionary Army and Blackbeard Pirates?,"As the recent manga release of One Piece, we all know that Jesus Burgess infiltrated the Revolutionary Army HQ (Baltigo) and reported it to his Captain BB.   My question is how did the World Government know that the Blackbeard Pirates were planning on attacking the Revolutionary Army HQ. we could take note that the one who attack in Baltigo are Cipher Pol, not the Marines.   As I remember, Cipher Pol is directly serving World Government (Nobles). Even if that Information came from marines first. How did they know? Is Aokiji a spy? "
663,Have the Ghost In The Shell animated movies made any profit?," Ghost in the Shell (1995): budget around [tex]2 million (Wikipedia, IMDb) Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence (2004): budget around [tex]10 million (Wikipedia, IMDb)   How can a series so good and influential flop financially? Even Rotten Tomatoes gave the original one 95%, and it only gathered 2 million while movies like The Fifth Element at the same time raked in hundreds of millions.   On its weekend, the 2004 one earned less than half a million dollars in the US. The new movie which is not great got 20 million in its first week.   Am I missing something? Something doesn't add up. Do the box office figures include income from Japan? Or DVD sales? Or something else? Surely they wouldn't keep financing something unprofitable. "
664,Do Seiyuu use stage-names for their anime works?,"What I mean by this is not the alias they use when they do H-Games. What I mean is whether they use a stage-name when doing anime works.  It all started from a little question I had in mind, ""Is Hanazawa Kana really Hanazawa Kana?"" Usually people in the entertainment industry use a stage-name to avoid mixing up their personal life and their public life. An example for this is the actor Hiro Mizushima, who is not really Hiro Mizushima by birth. His birth name is Saito Tomohiro. Does the same hold true with the seiyuu profession?  I also noted that Mizuki Nana's birth name is Kondo Nana. But is she just a rare case or are most seiyuu like that (that is, using a stage name)? "

666,Why is it that Volunteer Army Necklace consists of two tags?,"In Hai to Gensou no Grimgar the volunteer army necklace has two tags. During the fight between Mary's former party and Death Spot, and later during the fight between Death Spot and Haruhiko, all of them pulled one of the tags off from the necklace and let it fall to the dungeon's floor. Why is that? What's the point in leaving the tag there? Does the light novel, the anime is based on, explains why they do such thing? Considering that the tags doesn't come cheaply. "
667,Is Dal Dal cat ears is just hair accessory?,"Is there a reason that no one notice Dal Dal cat ears? I'm not very familiar with the Korean traditions, but I don't think it's just a hair accessory because sometimes when she get excited she reveal a cat tail. And I also remember there were some guy who cheer for Moon-Young who has a bear ears, so she couldn't be the only one (isn't?).   "

669,Have there been any anime that have been subjected to exclusive distribution rights?,"I see that this season, Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress is being streamed by Amazon, which holds exclusive distribution rights to the series and will also hold exclusive distribution rights to other series on the same network as Kabaneri in the future.  Even though I know that Amazon had acquired exclusive distribution rights to other non-anime series like Under the Dome, I was a bit surprised to see an anime title be subjected to exclusive distribution.  That led me to wonder: have there been any other anime that have been subjected to exclusive distribution rights in the past? In particular, by a party not dedicated to anime distribution like Amazon? "
670,Why was the old man sent to the void?,"In Death Billiards, the old man is sent to the void and the younger one is sent to be reincarnated. But why? What was the basis for this decision? It even contradicts other decisions in Death Parade. For example, the one shown darkness was the young man. "
671,Who decides the usage of furigana in a manga?,"Recently I started to seriously read digital manga in Japanese by utilizing their free-reading (立ち読み: read while standing) feature for some first chapters. Then I realized that some serieses use furigana on all kanji, and the rest only on some difficult/rare kanji.  Furigana on all kanji   Air Gear   Attack on Titan     Furigana on some kanji   Kaiji (furigana on itazura)   Mushishi (furigana on igyou and mushi)     So, who decides the usage of furigana in a manga? Is it the author's preference, or is it decided by the publisher?  Note: in this case, it's about furigana used for standard reading, not on its artistic usage/alternative reading/pun. "
672,Why did Walter want to kill Alucard in Hellsing Ultimate?,I was watching the Hellsing Ultimate and I feel like a lot of backstory on characters is sort of left out. I don't quite get the reason for Walter's treason and why does he want to kill Alucard so bad?  And how did Walter go to his younger form in the last fight? 
673,Who is Jeff-Kun? Is there any canonical references about him besides what is shown in the Anime?,"Jeff-kun is both the stuffed bear charm and the mysterious magician / pen-pal / mentor of Sae (supposedly the stuffed bear was given to Sae by him).  EDIT: I misplaced Jeff with Miki-senpai.  He is shown as a silhouette in the end of S2, but still remains shrouded in mystery.  The other kids don't even register Jeff-kun as a distinct entity. They just assume Sae is taking to the toy.  Is the information above correct? Is there any other source as to who Jeff-kun really is? "
674,What's the proper reading order for the Tokimeki Tonight manga?,"What's the proper reading order for the Tokimeki Tonight shoujo manga series about a half-vampire, half-werewolf girl written by Ikeno Koi? When should 「ときめきミッドナイト」(Tokimeki Midnight), 「星のゆくえ」(Hoshi no Yukue),  「真壁俊の事情」(Makabe Shun no Jijou), and「江藤望里の駆け落ち」(Etou Moori no Kakeochi) be read in comparison with the main series?  Are there any other prequels, sequels, side stories, or spin-offs that   were published in the tankoubon of another series by the same mangaka (i.e. tacked on as a one-shot at the back of the book)? ran in Ribon, Cookie, or such sister manga magazines but have not yet been published in tankoubon book form? were published outside of the Ribon Mascot Comics (RMC) line?

675,"Are Vegeta and Goku of the same age, or do they have several years of difference?","The second trailer of the movie Dragon Ball Super: Broly seems to show Goku and Vegeta were born at the same time.

676,Can I watch Naruto Shippuden movies anytime?,"I barely started watching anime, and Naruto was the first anime I watched. I'm currently in the middle of Naruto Shippuden (episode 71).  Before I go on, do I have to watch any of the movies, or can I watch them anytime? If it's necessary, what's the order to watch the movies? "
677,How many weeks are there in a One Piece year?,"During the time-skip Luffy was sent to Rusukaina to train with Rayleigh. When they arrive Rayleigh introduces the island as follows.     Rusukaina is home to the ""48 seasons"", a brutal island where the climate changes once a week.   This quote makes me wonder about the number of weeks in a year in One Piece. One would expect there to be 52 weeks as there are in our human world. So what about in the One Piece world? Are there 48 weeks in a year, 52 weeks in a year, or maybe a different number?   "
678,How is Lola (a general zombie) able to do what she wants?,"During Thriller Bark Arc, it was shown that all general zombies are under the command of Absalom and all zombies must follow the orders of their commander.  Then how is Lola able to chase after Absalom even though he keeps telling her that he will not marry her? Also, Lola comes and saves Nami from Absalom even though they are enemies and Lola was given order to fight Straw Hat crew? "
679,Why did Ika Musume lose her squid powers?,"At the end of season one's last episode in Shinryaku! Ika Musume, Ika Musume loses her squid powers, like glowing, tentacle usage, and regeneration, among others. In fact, it seems that the only power she kept was breathing underwater. Why? The anime gave no reason for her powers to go away, nor any reason for them to come back. The trigger was, ""someone is in danger"", but Takeru threw an inflatable orca at her to no avail, and Sanae managed to glomp Ika without being hurt. Given Ika's notorious selfishness, the best motivator should have been her being in danger, rather than someone else.  Was it ever explained or implied in the manga? Was this anime-only filler? What's the deal with that? "
680,What happened to the tomoe in Sasuke's Rinnegan?,"Sasuke's Rinnegan (pre-chapter 700) had six tomoe.    In Naruto Gaiden: The Seventh Hokage chapter 6, when Sasuke's Rinnegan is shown, it doesn't have the tomoe:      What happened to the tomoe in his Rinnegan? Is this an error or is there something else to it? "
681,"Why does Final Fantasy contain ""Final"" in the title?","Why does the Final Fantasy franchise of RPGs, anime, manga, etc. contain ""Final"" in the title?   Is it that the original concept of the first game was intended to portray the ending of a story? Was it derived from in-universe content? Or is it because the creators did not plan to produce more games, and did not expect that any sequels would be desired? Or was the inclusion of the word ""final"" chosen for a completely reason?  "
682,Can Amaterasu's speed increase?,"In the battle against Raikage, Sasuke cast Amaterasu and Raikage avoided it pretty easily because he's fast. In the battle against Kaguya, Sasuke cast Amaterasu and it hit her.    Question Was it because: - Sasuke Amaterasu speed had increased as he grew stronger so Kaguya couldn't dodge? - Kaguya could dodge it but she simply took it because she knew it was a chakra that she could absorb?    Are there any information about this?  Note: Kaguya is faster than Raikage, right? "
683,Did Sakura lose her virginity to Kakashi?,"I read from here that for an A-class ranked mission, Sakura teams up with Kakashi, her sensei, and according to the requirement of the mission, she loses her virginity to Kakashi.  Is this story true? Had it actually happened in the manga?  "
684,Is there any significance to Risei's line?,"In episode 16 of Fate/Zero, we see Kayneth go to the church in a wheelchair to plead for a command seal. Risei Kotomine relents, and when transferring one of the command seals onto Kayneth's hand, we see this line:     Take this cup and drink from it. This is my blood, given to you, for the salvation of all. The blood of a contract!   (Translation from Crunchyroll subtitles.) Barring the bit about the contract, this is suspiciously -- to me anyway -- reminescent of the Christian tradition of the Eucharist. However, unlike the real world ritual, there is no actual cup here: Risei says this line while his hand is on Kayneth's.  Is there any in-series meaning or significance to this? (Is it part of the ritual of transferring ""blank"" command seals unconnected to a specific servant? Notice that when Sola-Ui forcibly takes Kayneth's command marks, nothing similar seems to appear.) Or is this merely symbolism or a reference thrown in for the sake of atmosphere? (Here, perhaps to give a sense of mysticism and foreboding to the Grail, given that blood, on its own, could have negative connotations? Or perhaps simply some sort of ""Easter egg""?)  The latter explanation seems more likely to me, given what I've heard about a lack of knowledge of Christianity in Japan, but it could be that I'm missing knowledge about the workings about the Fate series universe.  I have not seen Fate/Zero beyond this. I do have some vague idea of how the Grail works from skimming over various Wiki articles or posts on this site, and from what has so far been covered in the current UBW adaptation. "
685,Why is All Blue not part of the 8 Seas?,"While exploring this site, I came across this particular question: What are the 9 mountains and 8 seas?   In the answers however, I did not see anyone mention All Blue. So my question is why is All Blue not a part of the 8 Seas that Zoro mentions? "
686,What is the usage of the stones monsters drop?,"According to the wiki page, adventurers can exchange the gems they collect in the dungeon for money.      Magic stones are crystal-like stones that are dropped by monsters. The   stones can be exchanged at the Guild for valis (Orario currency).      The bigger the stone, the more valis it is worth.   I was wondering, why does the Guild want these crystals? Do they have a use?   "
687,Is Junketsu conscious?,"Why is Senketsu the only Kamui that can talk? is a related, but slightly different question.  Senketsu is the only uniform that can talk, and apparently he can only talk to Ryuuko because their brains are connected at some level by Life Fibers. He also seems to be the only uniform that can move and think on its own.  However, late in the series, when Ragyo forces Ryuuko to put on Junketsu, it seems like Junketsu might have a consciousness&mdash;it might be able to think, even if it can't speak or move. It seems to have a will; it resists being removed by Ryuuko, and after she tears it off, Satsuki is only able to wear it because it was infused with some of Ryuuko's blood and Senketsu's Life Fibers, which changed its ""personality"" in some way. It also seemed like Junketsu might be creating some of the visions in Ryuuko's mind while she wore it, like when she saw herself at a wedding. But the scene was ambiguous; it could have also been Ragyo and Nui creating these visions and making Junketsu bind itself to Ryuuko.  We never see Junketsu talk or move, and it seems safe to assume it can't. But does Junketsu actually have a consciousness, or was it just made to behave this way by Ragyo and Nui? "
688,What is the song that plays when the results of the failed transmutation are dug up?,Does anyone know what's the name of the song that plays in FMA Brotherhood when Ed and Pinako dig up the corpse of the failed transmutation during rain?

689,"Why does Yubaba offer a job to Chihiro, rather than just turning her into piglet?","From the beginning of the film, it looks that Yubaba is searching for Chihiro with the clear intention to turn her into animal.   What reasons prevent Yubaba to do so when Chihiro suddenly comes to her office? While being rude, Yubaba still talks to Chihiro and at the end offers to sign the job contract. Looks like Yubaba is restricted by some rules she must follow. Why, and what are these rules?  "
690,"What purpose does the train, pictured in the Spirited Away movie, actually serve in the ghost world?","What purpose does the train, pictured in the movie, actually serve in the ghost world?   The train does not seem to provide service to and from Yubaba's house. The train's purpose appears to be to transport some dark shadows one way only. Who are they, and where are they going? Strangely, humans used it in the past (Chihiro and her parents use the remnants of the abandoned station to enter the ghost world). It is probably not a joke to use this train, as just doing so proves the true love and earns Chihiro respect from Rin (""I take my words back"").   The train is clearly the strong symbol of something. What does it represent? "
691,"Anime involving a love story and two samurai/assassin villages, previously on unfriendly terms, that were made to fight each other again","Please help me find the name of this anime I've watched online maybe 3 years ago. This is how I remember it:  There were two villages with previously unfriendly assassins or samurais (possibly with supernatural powers) that made some sort of pact because a woman from one village and a man from the other were in love. They were always meeting somewhere in the middle of the path between the villages. It was almost sunrise and each wanted to stay together a little bit longer.  In the meantime, some weird bad person decided the villages had to have a tournament of some sort, and scrolls were given to the heads of the families. They had a fight, maybe both died? And a crow or some bird took one of the scrolls. The Romeo/Juliet (not their real names) parted ways. Maybe some spiderwebs now and maybe the scrolls were 10 for each of the strongest warriors.  And there was fighting. In the last episode, the only ones left were the Romeo/Juliet combo. I think the Juliet was seriously injured and one of them was blind. Furthermore, one of them took some kind of poison. They probably both died at the end, but I think the weird bad person died, too, maybe in a carriage carried by people, not horses.  I'm not sure about most of the stuff, except for the title of my request. :? If anyone can help me, I'll be happy to watch this anime again. Thank you. "
692,The reason of Bartholomeo Kuma's devil fruit named as Nikyu-Nikyu no Mi?,"Nikyu-Nikyu no Mi is devil fruit that eaten by Bartholomeo Kuma, this fruit can be translated as Paw-Paw Fruit.  The power of this fruit are it can repelling any attack, or pain from our body as we can see in Thriller Bark arc when Kuma repelling the pain from Luffy. This fruit also can make other peoples flying for few days to somewhere place in the world.  What I'm ask here is what the reason behind a paw that can ""repel""? Is there any myth or something that make this fruit named as Nikyu-Nikyu no Mi/Paw-Paw Fruit? "
693,Where is All Blue located?,"After reading this question, I looked through some One Piece world maps as you can see below and they made me wonder. Where would All Blue even be at? All Blue is supposedly the place where the four seas meet.     The All Blue is a mystical sea of legend, rumoured to be the only place in the world where the North, South, East, and West seas meet.   Since the four seas are separated from each other by the Grand and Red line, how and where would they be able to meet? Where would All Blue be at?       There is even this interactive world map if you would be interested. "
694,Is it possible to bring back Nagato (Pain) using Edo-Tensei?,"During Nagato's last fight with Itachi, Bee, and Naruto, Itachi pierced him with his Totsuka sword.   As per the Naruto wikia page on Totsuka,     It is an ethereal weapon with an enchanted blade capable of sealing anything it pierces.Those who are stabbed by the sword are drawn into the jar and trapped in a genjutsu-like ""world of drunken dreams"" for all eternity.    My question is, can those who were sealed by the Totsuka sword be brought back by Edo-Tensei?  Does it seal the soul permanantly like Shinigami?  The same question goes for Benihisago as well. "
695,How much of the manga plot does the anime of Aku no Hana cover?,"I just started watching The Flowers of Evil, and I just noticed that the anime was produced before the end of the manga. If that's the case, it seems reasonable to conclude that some manga plot points might have been omitted from the anime.  Given this, how much of the manga plot is covered in the anime? (Approximately which portions of the manga have been covered there, and does the plot diverge anywhere?) "
696,What happens in the final battle of Underworld between the Human Army and the Dark Territory Army?,"I was unfortunately unable to be a part of the group that got to read the web novels before they were taken down, but it's killing me ever since I finished LN 15.  There are so many unresolved questions that I have and I can't seem to even find a release date for the Japanese version of Volume 16, let alone the English version, so if you read the web novel, can you enlighten me on a few points that are driving me crazy?   At the end of LN 14 when the power surge hits Kirito's FL, it seems to rip a hole in his consciousness and even the crying out of Asuna only seems to bring nostalgia, but he can't seem to place why he knows that voice?  Is that what happened? Alice seems to be following a similar train of thought to Kirito from the original SAO arc, that if the **** hit the fan, she's going to run with Kirito for the World End Altar?  What would happen if she and Kirito do make it there?  Kirito could log out, but she can't? Not that I want to seem like a shipper, but the relationships in this storyline are frustrating because I can't decide who to root for.  It's almost like Reki is opening the chance for Kirito to stay with Alice instead of returning to the real world? How does Kirito get his consciousness back? Given the side stories that have been released, it seems that the battle comes to a close with a truce?  Is that true for the main storyline? Does anyone have any info on release dates?  "
697,"Is it shown in the Manga the moment when Watari becomes aware of ""the lie""?","Watari is a big part of the romantic rectangle in the story, but he is also pivotal to ""the lie"".  In the anime it is only hinted that he is aware of the lie, for example      when he in a light, teasing tone asks Kousei if he is going to steal ""his"" Kaori (while climbing the stairs of the hospital, during a visit - one of the last 4 episodes of S-2, i think).   Is this internal conflict of Watari explored in more depth in the manga? Is it shown that he is aware of the lie? "
698,Ragyo Kiryuin's scars in Kill la Kill,"Ragyo Kiryuin in Kill la Kill anime has a number of scars along her back, that are shown in such a way it would make me think they are important.    By the end of the anime, the scars are not shown to be important to the story. Does the anime miss something the manga has in regards to those scars? Is there something I missed? "
699,What happened to Shishui Uchiha?,"In Naruto anime, though at first Itachi was accused for murdering his best friend, Shishui Uchiha. But later, it was revealed that Shishui gave one of his eyes to Itachi. But the next day, he was found dead. But what happened to Shishui? Did Danzo kill him?  But he already snatched his other eye before Shishui met Itachi. I did not understand if it was shown in the anime. "
700,Is Academy City really an educational city? What is its purpose?,"Academy City seems like a really weird city to me. At first I thought it was some super advanced city that was created with the sole purpose of filling it out with educational institutions for science and research, but a lot of things don't seem to make sense.  I watched the first season and it seemed really weird that the government was supporting the experiments for a level 6 esper. Something like that sounds like something the military would want. Why in Academy City?  Another thing that seems kind of weird is the Enforcement body ""Judgment"". Why is there such an enforcing body with such high level espers? Doesn't that imply that such weird and dangerous things are normal in Academy City? "
701,Is Goku the First Super Saiyan?,"As stated in the question, is Goku the first Super Saiyan?  If not, who was the first Super Saiyan? Was it:   Goku   Broly   Bardock (according to the Episode of Bardock) Someone else  "
702,"What is ""the calm""?","In Nagi no Asukara, what is exactly ""the calm""?  The fisherman at the final episode rejoices because       ""the calm"" has ended.   What is ""the calm"" referring to? "
703,How was the Gedo Mazo summoned?,"This question contains spoiler.      As we know, Rikudo Sennin sealed the Jubi inside him and before he died, he banned its body with Chibaku Tensei and created the moon. We also know, that when the body was freed by Madara, it served him as Gedo Mazo. But how did Madara free the Gedo Mazo? Is there any reference in the manga/anime?  "
704,Do dolls in Rozen Maiden live like a human?,"A question about how the Rozen Maiden dolls themselves function.  You often see them eat and drink as well as breathe.  Are these functions required for them to continue to exist?   If not, all of those flower burgers and tea was a real waste.  If so or not, what happens to all the waste from the consumed food and liquids?     Simply stating magic is like a cop out, and not thinking about this would seem to be lazy writing. Shinku did not know what a restroom was and at times, there were 7 beings (5 dolls and 2 humans) in that house and never mention them waiting to use the restrooms for a doll's sake.    Of course, this opens up the question about sweating and required bathing and such if they do.  They act like little humans, but they are shown to be porcelain dolls with strings holding them together.  Just doesn't add up. Thoughts?  "
705,Why are dominators activated for drones and robots?,"Aren't dominators enabled after a cymatic scan, which judges the living person's personality based on its brainwaves?  If so, why do the dominators get enabled in ""lethal elimination"" for drones in several episodes?  EDIT:  As people pointed out, for drones dominators often get enabled in ""destroy decomposer"" mode. "
706,"Is ""Anime Studio"" animation software used professionally in making anime?","Is Anime Studio used by any popular Anime studios for actual, commercial Anime production?  I know it's fairly common with amateurs and quite a few Western Animation professionals, but has it ever been used to produce a full season of an anime series that was aired in Japanese TV, or some Anime of comparable scale? Or is just a marketing twist, and only ever Western animation of professional quality has been made in it? "
707,How can saiyans have Freezer army-like armor when they first met Freezer?,"In the last trailer from the movie Dragon Ball Super Broly, saiyans have Freezer army-like armors when they supposedly meet Freezer for the first time. How is this possible? Did saiyans and Freezer army got their armors from other race or is this a continuity mistake? "
708,"Is there any more of ""Bagi, the Monster of Mighty Nature""?","Does the franchise of ""Bagi, the Monster of Mighty Nature"" consist only of this one movie or is there anything more to it? Any sequels, series, mangas, visual novels, ""spiritual sequels"" (entirely different movie but taking strong inspiration in it) or any other paraphernalia related to Bagi? "
709,Fitting rules of Death Note,There are at least 130 rules of use of the Death Note. Do they all fit on the one last page of the notebook (how?) or do they come from some other source? Was it ever addressed in the manga or the anime? 
710,Is there a mind link between the Gedo Mazo and its summoner,"   After Obito Summoned the Gedo Mazo (The Juubi's husk) in the 4th Great ninja war, he tried to retrieve the gold and silver brothers but was stopped by Darui and shikamaru. (Shippuden 276). In order to get the brothers, Obito controlled the Gedo Mazo to step on shikamaru.   How was this possible? it seemed more like he neither needed to say anything nor give it orders to control it, like it reacted to his thoughts, and it got me wondering if the Gedo Mazo is the only exception to summoning rule where the user can directly control his summon? If that weren't the case then what actually went down.  Could this be related to the power of the Rinnengan? "
711,Who was piloting the White Knight Infinite Stratos?,"As the question states, is it ever revealed who the pilot was? Since Byakushiki contains Core number 001 which is the same one that powered the white knight, can we assume that the pilot was Shinonono Tabane? "
712,Why did Imaizumi have a 1:50 start delay on day 2 of the Interhigh?,"In episode 31 of Yowamushi Pedal, we get to see a screen that gives the finish times of the top five finishers on day 1 of the Interhigh:    The fifth line on that display gives Imaizumi's time as ""+1.55"". This means ""1.55 seconds after first place"", right? It wouldn't make sense if it were ""1 minute and 55 seconds after first place"", given how close behind the first-placers he and Arakita were riding.  So in episode 32, while they're waiting at the start line to begin day 2 of the Interhigh (around 17:10 in the episode), Tadokoro tells Onoda that Imaizumi will start 1 minute and 50 seconds after the day 1 first place finishers. (This isn't a subtitling error; Tadokoro says １分５０秒後 = ""1 minute and 50 seconds later"".)  Based on Tadokoro's explanation of how the Interhigh works, I would've expected Imaizumi's start to be just 1.55 seconds delayed. Why was the time delay actually 1 minute and 50 seconds instead? (Even if I misinterpreted the reading on the screen, it should still be 1:55, not 1:50.) "
713,Has Midoriya's father ever appeared in the anime or in the series?,"As far as I remember, Midoriya's father never appeared in the anime. What happened to him? Did he appear in the manga? "
714,Is it known if One for All can't be passed through genes to children?,"It was stated in the series that the user of One for All has to wish to pass One for All to another person for it to pass, and the receiver has to eat something from him/her to receive his/her DNA. However, I dont remember anything being said in the anime about if children could receive One for All or not. Is it known if One for All can't be passed through genes to children? Or could in the future there be more One for All users and not only one? "
715,Why is there a time limit on Tobi's dematerialization technique?,"This question contains spoilers for early manga readers and anime viewers  Konan mentions during her fight with Tobi that Tobi's dematerialization technique can last for only 5 minutes. This can be confirmed as true since Tobi resorts to Izanagi to escape her ultimate technique, Kami no Shisha no Jutsu. It is later revealed that Tobi's dematerialization technique is actually just teleporting himself into his alternate dimension with Kamui.  However, earlier during the Five Kage meeting arc, he had teleported Sasuke and Karin and kept them in the alternate dimension for quite a long time. He also kept Fu and Torune in the alternate dimension for several days. This shows that he does not face any significant side-effects, like draining chakra, by keeping people in the other dimension. Also, staying in the alternate dimension did not seem to have any adverse effect, on at least Sasuke and Karin.  Why can Tobi not keep himself in the alternate dimension for more than 5 minutes? In particular, why could he not just escape Konan's ultimate technique by staying in his alternate dimension for 10 minutes, rather than use Izanagi? "
716,What happened to the Titans after the Survey Corps left the walls?,"What happened to all the Titans roaming outside the walls when the Survey Corps left the wall and arrived at the ocean? I mean, surely they couldn't not have disappeared into thin air now (Like the Colossal Titan), right? Surely the Survey Corps would have encountered vast amounts of Titans as always when venturing outside the walls.  I know for a fact that the Survey Corps did not install Titan guillotines all over Wall Maria, like it was used in Trost District.  I distinctly remember in one of the chapters, it mentioned that the Survey Corps went along beaten Titan trails outside of the walls, and encountering little to no Titan Resistance. How is this possible? Am I missing something from the Manga/Anime? "
717,Can Kai Chisaki fuse with anyone?,"IIRC Kai Chisaki was just introduced in the last episode of the anime. I havent read the manga, but in one My Hero Academia wikia they state Kai Chisaki fused with another villain. How does this work? Can he fuse only with people who wants to fuse or could he fuse with anyone, for example, Midoriya and obtaining One for All by exerting his powers? "
718,How can one achieve incredible chakra such as that of the Third Raikage or Kisame?,"Kisame was known as tailed beast without tails. This is because he had an incredible amount of chakra, so much that Samehada had an affection toward him.  A's father, the Third Raikage, could even combat the Hachibi all alone! What is the source of such an amount of chakra? Is it hereditary? Or won by practice? Or just by birth?  Might Guy, the Green Beast of Konoha, opened the 8 Gates to surpass Kisame, but doing this takes a risk on his life. So it is certainly not the manipulation of chakra points, since neither the Third Raikage nor Kisame seem to be risking their lives to get such an amount of chakra. "
719,How did Moegi acquire the Wood release,"  Wood release is the kekkai genkai of the Senju clan (originally the God trees sacred ability and also the Otsutsuki clans Kekkai Genkai), however, Moegi is able to do it by combining Water and earth style. Does this mean being able to combine 2 elements can allow anyone to use an advanced element?  We know Orochimaru used to perform experiments on merging Hashirama's cells with small children but Sarutobi Hiruzren (the Third Hokage) put an end to it.  Moegi did not have the wood style ability while she was younger plus the experiments that Orochimaru did with Hashirama's DNA were destroyed earlier in the series. So how did Moegi suddenly become able to use it at adulthood? "
720,How did Chi end up in the trash?,"In Chobits, the protagonist finds Chi discarded with trash behind some house.       One would think a product of a secret project like that, containing some extremely important secrets, would be at the very last disposed of in a responsible manner, and not just thrown out.    Maybe I wasn't an attentive watcher but I never spotted any backstory as to how she ended up there. Does the show explain it? If not, are there any viable theories? "
721,Is there another wall encompassing the entire of Paradis for Marley to use?,"So, another question about Attack on Titan.  So in the Manga, and by extension, the Anime, it is revealed that certain people, Eldian IIRC, are transformed into Titans by injecting them with Titan Spinal Fluid. These people are then thrown off a large object, and transform into Pure Titans a short while later.   Now I got to thinking, Is this large object yet another wall placed on the Island of Paradis? Like the three walls protecting Humanity on the Island itself? Or is this just a staging area for the transformation of people in Pure Titans? "
722,Is Dabi Endeavor's son?,There always has been a lot of speculation about Dabi being Endeavor's son. But yesterday I saw a My hero academia Youtuber who said in the last manga (#202) was strongly hinted so. What happened in the last manga? Is Dabi Endeavor's son? 
723,Why is the music of Studio Ghibli movies so similar?,The Studio Ghibli movies music seems to have various spinoffs of the same music across the movies.  Why was that music chosen? Is there any importance relevance or meaning into it? What is the name of the music? The music I am talking about can be heard in all movies. For instance in the first seconds of Majo no Takkyuubin 
724,Do people in the anime or manga actually eat Pokemon?,"In the anime, certain species of Pokemon are mentioned or depicted to be edible (by people or other Pokemon), like Magikarp and Farfetch'd.    Do people actually eat Pokemon? If so, what other species have been mentioned or depicted as edible, in either the anime or the manga? "
725,Why is Kimihiro Watanuki plagued by youkai and ayakashi?,"From the start of the series, Watanuki is tormented by them. Is there a reason why they ""like"" him so much?    It's his smell? Some related parent (blood relationship)? Unlucky?   What is the reason? "
726,How did they start sending messages to other's phone?,"When the anime starts and until episode 8, they attached a cell-phone to the phone-microwave and sent a message to that specific phone to trigger sending D-Mails. But in episode 8       Ruka sent a D-Mail to her mother pager   and then in episode 9      Faris sent a D-Mail to (probably) herself   So I'm wondering if there is a plot whole somewhere in the story, or did they figure out a way to send D-Mails from any phone to any phone?   As a side question previously it was mentioned that how they can set D-Mail's time of Arrival:      each second on Phone-Microwave meant an hour going back, so I'm wondering how did they manage to set microwave time to 87600 (10 years)?  "
727,"In Naruto, what makes a person a genius?","In our world, a ""genius"" is someone who is extremely smart, analytic or a fast learner.  Although there are similarities between our and the Naruto universe definition of ""Genius"", I still feel that it's not the same.  What is considered a ""Genius"" in the Naruto world? Is Naruto a genius? Is Sasuke a genius? Itachi? Nagato? I don't see it as strictly being smart. "
728,How strong is Gintoki?,"In episode 21 of the 2006 series, when Gintoki tries to buy a fan , apparently he gets involved in a fight where he breaks a car in 2 with a kick, and later he throws an object larger than him, presumably very heavy.     But since he was telling these events to Kagura, and Kagura said he made up this story of how he got the fan, we dont know if this really happened or not, despise the fan is signed by a girl which was involved in the events he told, asserting the story seems to be at least partially true.   My question is how strong is Gintoki? Does he has superhuman-level strenght? or is he just a skilled samurai with regular human strenght? "
729,Why do some Sharingan eyes have unique Mangekyou abilities?,"Itachi, Sasuke, Madara's Sharingan and Danzo's ""Sharingan"" eyes have the ""standard"" Mangekyou abilities of Amaterasu, Tsukuyomi, Susanoo, Izanagi and Izanami. (Granted not all of them have used all the abilities.)    However, Shisui and Obito's sharingan have unique Mangekyou abilities (Komoamatsukami and Kamui respectively). Why do some Sharingan eyes come with unique abilities? Do they get these abilities in lieu of the standard abilities or in addition to them?    Obito has always used Kamui and never been shown using the standard abilities, with his Sharingan (he once used Izanagi with a transplanted Sharingan), which makes me wonder if the special abilities are in lieu of the standard ones.  "
730,Did Naruto stack Sage Mode with Sage of Six Path Mode?,"Naruto received Sage of Six Path Mode from Hagaromo. At this moment, what was Naruto ""final form""?     KCM + Sage Mode(Toad) + Sage of Six Path Mode?   KCM + Sage of Six Path Mode?     If it's the latter, did his Sage Mode(Toad) transformed into Sage of Six Path Mode? Is there any other explanation? "
731,Things that aren't explained in the anime,"I've watched the anime of Brynhildr in the Darkness, however the story in the manga continues from what I've heard. It seems that some questions at the end are answered in the manga which I haven't read:   Why are the girls alive again in the end, except one of them? Were they succesfull with creating their own pills? Is it really impossible for Kuroha Neko to regain her memories?  "
732,Why was EVA Unit 01 Crucified?,"One part, for me anyway, that stuck out was the crucifixion by the Mass-Production EVA Units of EVA Unit 01 in The End of Evangelion. I just can't see the reason why EVA Unit 01 was crucified when Third Impact occurred. What was hoped to be gained by crucifying a mech of all things?  What was the reason for EVA Unit 01's crucifixion? Was it to start Third Impact?  I have not read the manga behind Evangelion, so I know I am missing something.  "
733,"Is ""La Tabki Ya Saghiri"" an original Digimon Arabic song?",There's a Digimon song in Arabic called لا تبكي يا صغيري (La Tabki Ya Saghiri). I'm not sure if it's a Digimon Arabic original song or if it exists in Japanese.  Is this an original song or a dubbed of an existing Digimon song? 
734,Couldnt Overhaul be used in the same way of Eri's rewind quirk?,"According to one My Hero Academia wikia       he is also capable of using it to ""revive"" people, as he has done to Rappa multiple times   and        Sir Nighteye assumes that Chisaki's Quirk is responsible for the healing of the Team Reservoir Dogs   Also      Overhaul's characters in his name are composed of ""治"" (chi, lit.   ""govern, regulate, administer""), ""崎"" (saki, lit. ""promontory, cape,   spit"") and ""廻"" (kai, lit. ""revolve, return, curving""   If he can revive and may be heal people, isnt reving the most difficult/extreme ""rewind"" of a person's state? Couldnt Overhaul be used in the same way of Eri's rewind quirk? "
735,Which was the first anime to receive a English dub?,"With this question and this question both receiving some attention recently, it made me think - which anime was the first to receive a dub?  Some of the first anime available in western countries such as Astro Boy had dubs produced in the 1960's as stated in the linked wikipedia article, but which show was the original one to have an officially produced English dub? "
736,If one could easily use Mangekyou Sharingan even without being an Uchiha why only Kakashi use it?,"Many people know about power of the Sharingan. Danzo for one had many eyes (11?) but he didn't have the real power of the Uchiha like Susanoo.  Orochimaru, the best scientist in the Ninja world has done a lot of crazy stuff and he was really interested in Uchiha's body so he wanted to take Sasuke as his next host body, but then why didn't he just take the eyes? "
737,"What is Japanese version of the pun word, ""slife""? ... and term for adult friend?","At time code 21:40 of Episode 1 of That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime, the protagonist Satoru refers to his new life as a slime as a ""slife"" (sub).  I'm guessing there was similar word play in Japanese.  Could someone explain what it was?   Also, just prior to that he had made friends with a dragon, but as a 37-year-old (former) human, seemed embarrassed to use the term ""friends"".  Does Japanese tend to use a different term than ""friend"" for adults?  I get the impression Satoru thinks the term would normally be used by kids and teenagers. "
738,Why didn't Eren's eyes change colour when he inherited the Founding Titan?,"So, after watching the Anime, I noticed that all the people, who inherited the power of the Founding Titan, eye's change from their original colour to a brilliant purple colour, whether they be royal blood or not, as evidence of Grisha Jaeger. It should noted that the holder's eyes change colour almost immediately after consuming the previous holder, as evidence by Grisha again and Frieda Reiss. Based on what is seen and known thus far, it would make sense that the purple eyes of the holder would signify that they are in control of the Founding Titan, when compared to other Titan Shifters, like Annie and Reiner.  Evidence A -- here -- Look under the Titan Tab in the character details box.  This raises yet another question, why didn't Eren's eyes change colour after he ate Grisha in the Woods? Is he not affected by the power of the Founding Titan? Or does the power need to be ""activated"", like the Ackerman clan, in order to use it at it's full potential?  I don't recall seeing anything about this in either the Anime or the Manga, but I could be wrong and maybe missed something yet again. "
739,Why is there so much reluctant sex in hentai?,"Multiple authors on the net have pointed out that a lot of the sex in hentai is, or appears to be, non-consensual.  From here: [website]  I watched 20 hentai over the course of June/July, and looking back over them all, I’m left with one frustratingly unanswered question:      [WHY IS THERE SO MUCH RAPE IN HENTAI?!?]      Why is rape so ubiquitous in hentai, why is it so inescapable, and why do so many of [these hentai that I've watched] focus exclusively on rape, with maybe one token consensual scene or sometimes none at all? It’d be like if 90% of the porn made in Belgium featured a buttplug scene — it’s weirdly specific and implies there’s some kind of cultural thing going on that I don’t yet understand.   Also, note this: [website]A commenter on the first article claims these 'rapes' are not as non-consensual as they seem:     ninfadelagua said: The average porn scene does seem rapey, even if it isn’t extreme (no hitting/scratching/biting) there seems to be a trend of women acting like they are resisting a lot and the men in the porno keep going and prey on them sexually (for hetero porn).   This implies that the 'victim' enjoys the rough sex and is 'resisting' as part of the 'game', sort of like how tsundere pretend to hate the person they actually love.  Which leads to Not If They Enjoyed It Rationalization: which says:     Turns up often in Hentai, Boys Love Genre and Fanfiction. A lot.    In other words, the claim is that this, in some sense, doesn't count as rape because the purported victim enjoyed the experience.    Is this actually what's going on? What is about Japanese culture that makes reluctant sex, which looks non-consensual to Western eyes, so common in hentai? "
740,Where do the Angels get their names from?,"The names of the Angels are something to behold, truly. In some cases, the names for these Angels are an understatement for the power that these beasts carry with them to the battlefield. But another thing doesn't make sense to me, where do the names for the Angels come from? (Like Ramiel and Zeruel)  Does it work similarly to Pacific Rim, in the way that Tendo Choi names the Kaiju coming out of the breach? (i.e. ""First Seen, First Named""?), or is it more of a religious prophecy tied to the Angel's order of appearance? "
741,Can Mirio solidify his body beyond human level hardness?,"So there is no explanation for Mirio's strenght making him able to knock hard rock characters like Kirishima. One wikia states he has enhanced strenght. Since he is able to de-solidify his body, and later solidify it to at least human level solid, can it be that he can solidify beyond human level and that makes him able to become harder and stronger to the point of knocking heroes with superhuman resistance? Similar to what another hero from another universe like Vision from Marvel who is also able to desolidify and solidify does?  Is there any hint/statement in the manga or any guidebook about how much he can solidify his body after de-solidifying? "
742,Is there an 'angel dance' outside of the Shirobako anime?,"In Shirobako episode 16, Ema is caught doing a little dance exercise on the roof.  [website]CrunchyRoll's subtitles call this the 'Angel Dance' exercise. There's no results for that in english, but I was thinking maybe it's an exercise only really known about in Japan. For the most part, Shirobako has solid references to existing things.  Is this dance a real exercise or was it just created for the show? "
743,Why couldn't Natsu tell the difference between Gemini and Gray?,In episode 58 Natsu encounters Gemini posing as Gray. Wouldn't her smell be different? Or does Gemini have the ability to mimic that too? 
744,What happened to the Steins;Gate 0 anime?,I was waiting for another episode since the Okabe in Steins;Gate 0 wasn't shown to reunite with Kurisu.  Did Steins;Gate 0 really end? Are there any OVAs of this? 
745,"What is Caramelldansen, and where does it originate from?","I've been seeing this thing called Caramelldansen show in in .gifs by 2 characters from all different series. pairs such as Ed and Al from Fullmetal Alchemist, Arcuied and Ciel from Tsukihime, Rin and Saber from Fate/Stay Night and these crappy quality ones on youtube of L and Light and Mello and Near from Death Note   But what is Caramelldansen and where does it originate from? "
746,Why did Kaneki's hair turn back to its original colour?,"At the end of season 2, Kaneki's hair turns back to its original colour.  I know his hair turned to white because of the Marie Antoinette (MA) syndrome, but in all the research I've done, I've found nothing regarding a cure for the MA syndrome.  So, why did his hair change back? Can the MA syndrome be cured? And why did Kaneki get cured out of the blue for no reason at all?  "
747,Why are Yubaba's spirit employees froglike?,"The spirits that work for Yubaba in the bath house seem to be to varying  degrees, froglike.  Some seem to be fully frogish, like Aogaeru.    While others are mostly human like Lin, and still others seem to be mixes of human and frog.  When Lin is told that she and Sen will be working on the big tub, Lin replies ""that's Frog work"".    Is there any reason given in Spirited Away or Japanese mythology that explains the frog-like spirits? "
748,"How long did Killi's journey through ""The City"" took?",From the first chapter until       Killi restores the network interface gene   how long did it take? Years? Decades? Millenia? 
749,Why are the numbers of Logia and Zoan Devil Fruit users lower when compared to Paramecia users?,"From the wikia:                      Canon   Non-Canon   SBS Paramecia -          49*       15        2 Zoan -               17         3        0 Logia -              11         3        0 Unspecified -         0         1        1 Total Devil Fruits - 77*       22        3   It is clear that Paramecia users outnumber both Zoan and Logia users. Is there any specific reason for that?  I think that more Zoan users mean more animals, so it will have less creativity (for attacks) compared to other Devil Fruits. So that may be a reason for less Zoan users till now.  But what about Logia? Most Logia users are big-shots. "
750,Why does Wei WuXian look like Mo XuanYu?,What was the purpose of their bodies looking almost identical to each other? Was it just the animator's decision or was it in the novel?    The top image is Wei Wuxian and the bottom one is him in Mo Xuanyu's body. 
751,What is C.C.'s status after the Zero Requiem?,"If Lelouch is still alive after the Zero Requiem (which he probably is because of the appearance of the third season), he probably goes into hiding.   Do people know that C.C. was an accomplice of Lelouch, or is she treated like Lloyd (basically acquired after Lelouch's regime)? I might've missed something in the anime, but basically, would C.C. need to go into hiding with Lelouch, or can she live as she used to without being sought out?  "
752,Victims and Sea stone,"I cannot remember any event where a victim of a fruit user or an object affected by a fruit user came in contact with the sea stone, is there any record until now in one piece?  Question -  if a human turned toy by the hobi-hobi no mi or a homie created by the soru-soru no mi came in contact with the sea stone, would the effect revert? Or does the stone affect the user but not the power?  Exceptions I can think of - Kuzan's ice does not melt or change back to water on the surface of the sea. "
753,"What is the ""Twin Ciel"" theory?","Given the highly positive response to my last question: Who stole my candy?, there seems to be a lot of speculation around this ""Twin Ciel"" theory or the idea of there being 2 Ciels.   So with that in mind, I am posting a follow-up question to that to ask for the full explanation of the theory and what this means for the series.   Can anyone shed some light, links, etc? "
754,Why do mecha anime tend to be original works?,"So this may seem like a weird question, but bear with me.  Loads and loads of anime are based on manga, and it's a fact that has become well-known in the anime community. However, the mecha genre seems to be a tad different.  I've seen a decent amount of mecha anime in the past. However, one trend that sticks out to me is that a lot of mecha anime are original works, and not based on manga, or light novels.  Here are some examples that I was able to gather by going through the mecha genres on MyAnimeList:   Gundam franchise- is technically a multimedia franchise, but started as a TV anime Code Geass - another huge mecha franchise Macross franchise - huge and old mecha franchise Neon Genesis Evangelion  Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann  Darling in the FranXX Eureka Seven Aldnoah.Zero Suisei no Gargantia Kakumeiki Valvrave Cross Ange Hoshi no Koe Isekai no Seikishi Monogatari Tenkuu no Escaflowne Star Driver Kuromukuro Aquarion series Heroic Age - this one's kinda iffy since the giant beings they transform into are organic (kinda like Attack on Titan), but MAL categorizes it as mecha   All of these are original anime, or started as original anime. However, when you look through other genres on MAL, there aren't a lot other genres with this many original works.  So why do mecha anime tend to be original works, more so than other genres? Why aren't there as many mecha manga or light novels? "
755,Could one make a Devil Fruit eat another one?,"We saw deers, guns and swords that have Devil Fruit powers. Would it be possible (with Vegapunks help) for a DF to eat a DF?  Would it explode like if someone ate two DFs? If not, one could try to eat that DF to get both powers (And should explode).  If it is possible, it is worth thinking about whether or not the resulting DF has it's own powers too. E.g. take a fox Zoan, feat it to the fire fruit (no offence to neither Ace nor Sabo here) and create a ""Firefox"". "
756,"What is the ""Recovery"" of Moriko Morioka after the series end?","The only ""recovery"" thing I see is that both (not just Moriko Morioka, but also Yuuta Sakurai) main characters have overcome their social difficulty.    I just watch eps 11. However I haven't see the mention on whether Moriko Morioka get a job or not. I wonder how she is making a living somehow. Because she stay home for too long (all the series), I think she might somehow run out of fund soon.   Did I miss something? About Morioka getting a job? "
757,Can defeated Servants be summoned again?,Let's say Bob for some reason takes part in the 6th holy grail war. He then posseses the weird snake relic from Gilgamesh and attempts to summon him? Does this work? Or does it fail because Gilgamesh was defeated in the last war? 
758,Who is the person with purple hairs at the end of Kai season of Higurashi?,"At the very end of Kai season of Higurashi no Naku Koro Ni, there's a woman telling child Takano not to leave home. She has the same voice as Furude Rika. Is she Furude Rika?    If she is, is she a time traveller of some sort? "
759,Did Danzo use Shisui's eye?,"I've see this fight quite a few times but I never understood if Danzo used Shisui's eye?  When Sasuke pierces Karin &amp; Danzo with his extended Chidori, did Danzo use his last Sharingan (Shisui's eye) or he didn't get a chance to use as Sasuke's attack was unexpected/surprised? "
760,Is there a succinct list anywhere of all the general genres of anime?,"If not can we make one here? It'd help a lot of people who ask ""What anime should I watch if I like this?""  "
761,How did EVA Unit 01 interfere with SEELE's plan?,"In the Anime, after Evangelion Unit 01 eats Zuruel's S2 Engine in it's beserk mode, Gendo is seen in a meeting with the member of SEELE or whoever the pseudo-illuminati style organization is running NERV from the shadows. One of the directors of the organization states Evangelion Unit 01 has become self aware, almost becoming god-like, and that they have no use for a god in their master plan.  Now I fail to see how a sentient EVA Unit can prove to be such a hindering factor in SEELE's ultimate plan. How could one EVA Unit pose such a threat to the plan that the Unit had to be grounded until further notice? and what type of hindrance were the SEELE directors talking about? "
762,Which reasons does Endeavor have to think having a freezing/fire quirk would make you stronger than having a fire only quirk?,"Endeavor is convinced that having a freezing/fire quirk would make you stronger than having a fire only, to the point he had several children to get one who displays such quirk. But at first impression it doesnt seem to be obvious than having both options would make you stronger than having only one. Does he ever mentioned any reasons to think so? Which reasons does Endeavor have to think having a freezing/fire quirk would make you stronger than having a fire only quirk? "
763,Philosophical meaning on how Ed beat/defeats Truth?,"I've been reading around everywhere on this topic and haven't really come to a proper understanding. From what I've read, Ed beats truth by sacrificing his gate and from this he gets to take Al back home.  Now this doesn't make sense. Does this mean that he essentially sacrificed everything, his ability to do alchemy, and in return he gets to ""take anything you want"" which is what Truth says back to him in the Japanese dub?  What's the deeper philosophical meaning to this? Why would you give up/sacrifice/destroy truth? Isn't it important to know the truth?  Does sacrificing truth destroy it, i.e. the truth is you can't do this, so I sacrifice truth, and truth doesn't exist except what I think it is? So I become truth and essentially I can do anything because I am truth?  Any explanations? "
764,Does Rei's favourite drink exist in real life?,"In Digimon Universe: Appli Monsters, Gatchmon in the fourth episode, falls in love with (and totally an intentional product placement) what's dubbed as ""Gatchi Sweets"" or ""GatchiMonaka"", which is wafer biscuit with bean fillings.        Frequently across episodes, we also see Rei, one of the protagonist characters frequently drinking small packets of a ""Choo Choo Energy"" drink of some sort.    What exact is that, and does it have a real-world equivalent; physical thing?  ... or is that drink totally and utterly fictional? "
765,"Is there a reason for the ""Hair of Death"" hair style?","  I've seen this joke float around various social media sites lately. Is there a particular reason for why characters with this hairstyle - particularly mother figures - seem to die so consistently?  For instance, is it an allusion or symbol that I don't understand?  Alternatively, are there any strong counter examples? "
766,What is the name of the tune that Black always whistles?,"When watching episode 10.5 of Kekkai Sensen, I found that Black, when possessed by King of Despair, was whistling some tune. I'm sure that Black whistles that tune more than once.  I remember hearing it:   Before Leo meets Black in a train, and When Black is waiting for White to wake up to ask for taking Leo's eye.   Is it from another song? Or is it an original tune? "
767,"The science behind Squall's Gunblade, if there is any?","So, Revolver, Squall's gunblade, is a pure melee weapon, and not actually a gun. Apparently, squeezing the trigger just before the blade hits the target mid-swing amplifies the damage dealt by this weapon.  Here's what I know, and please correct me if I am wrong:   It uses cartridges (most likely, without the bullet/projectile part) to do its damage-amplification thing.       And here are my issues:   Since making the cartridges explode is the key to the damage-amplification mechanism, does the explosion send vibrations to the blade, like star wars' vibro blades?   Or does it use the raw explosion, like, making mini shockwaves to deal more damage?   Either way, do you think there is a barrel (with only one hole, since the tip of the Revolver has no hole, like for bullets) inside for this vibration/shockwave to travel to the blade?   Asuming that there exist a material elastic and strong enough to do this mechanism, do you think it would make sense scientifically?   Do you have some more ideas to share?    "
768,Why did the Magic Council make so many Faces?,"If Face can eradicate all magic on Fiore, why did the council make so many of them?  Magic is their first line of defence, after all, they are the Magic Council. But even if something did come up where they needed to eradicate magic, why would they make so many Faces, especially if they were trying to keep them a big secret?   I could understand if there are 2 or 3, but why hundreds?  If they had multiple, it would make more sense to spread them out, but why would they keep them all in the same place?  "
769,Can an Ackerman become a Titan Shifter?,"After reading the Manga until the current issue, it kind of feels like to me that it's building to Mikasa is going to become the Female Titan, or that Mikasa is going to inherit the Attack Titan from Eren due to the curse of Ymir.  This raised yet another question about the AoT series, can an Ackerman become a Titan shifter, seeing that this clan is one of the ""special clans"" that cannot be affected by Titan powers in any way, form or shape?  I would think that they can, given that the Ackerman clan was a ""result of Titan Science"" before or after the walls were built, explaining their enhanced abilities and skills, but still leaves the burning question, can an Ackerman become a Titan should it be inherited from elsewhere?  UPDATE  As of Chapter 112. It is revealed by Eren that the Ackerman Clan can control Titan abilties when in close proximity with a Titan Shifter, or if that Ackerman member has a relatively close bond to said Titan Shifter (e.g. Mikasa and Eren). I feel that this information is relevant to this question, and thus has been added. "
770,Why do so many character names start with あ,"I'm on Episode 5, but so far with the exception of one character, all the other named characters start with あ, like Aika, Akari, Alice, Ai, Allan.  This seems to be done on purpose because the Undine who's training Aika in Himeya is named Akira when it could have been easier to give her a different name so as to not confuse her with Akari who Alicia trains.  It also seems to not be limited to Undine or their customers because Akatsuki is a Salamander.  So is it on purpose that all the characters are named starting with あ? If so, why? And why is the Sylph from Episode 4, Woody, the exception? "
771,Kakashi's Mangekyou Sharingan,"Obito starts using his Mangekyou as soon as he unlocks it,unlike Kakashi.  Did Kakashi not know he had the Mangekyou?Or did he keep it hidden? "
772,What is the origin relatioinship between the Cursed Blood Clan and the Kyoukai no Kanata?,"Watching the movie, it seems like there is some relationship between the Cursed Blood Clan (CBC) (Kuriyama's) and the Kyoukai no Kanana (KnK) Youmu's origin.  And I am not talking about the romantic relationsip between Mirai and Akihito. About the origins of them both.  It is shown that      Akihito and Mirai's mothers were close enough that Kuriyama could ask to be reforged into a ring upon her death.   So, what is the rellationship?      Was the CBC involved in creating KnK?  "
773,Where did Princess Kaguya come from?,"In the English release of Princess Kaguya, it's translated that she originally came from the moon. And it seems that way, as she looks up at the sky above a lot when the moon is out.  My question is though, is she actually from the moon - or is it something lost in translation, because during the ending scene:      The buddha and other celestial beings come down to retrieve her.       I thought he was not from nor went to the moon, but an exceptional human being. This has me thinking that there is something out of place here.  Is 'moon' the correct translation? Is my understanding of the film off? "
774,Why is adult anime so much less likely than US adult animation to be comedic?,"This video explains why US adult animation is almost always comedic. US animation studios transferred their efforts to television in the years following Hollywood's anti-trust case (which meant future shorts were less likely to be assured of theatrical releases), but this was only cost-effective if the animation style was simplified and the content made child-friendly enough for extensive ad-heavy re-runs. With the exception of a 1972 series, adult TV animation waited until The Simpsons. Although this series was a risky investment, lessons learned from its rapid success allowed a transition from expecting adult animation to be unviable to expecting it to be viable as long as it was comedic, preferably in a sitcom format.  Clearly, adult anime is in a very different situation and has been for decades. (One need only look at the lists here.) The reason, in short, is that the historical factors mentioned above are unique details of US history. A similar overview of the history of Japanese animation, both cinematic and televisual, would sound completely different and make sense of the diverse range of adult anime that resulted, including in the present day.  So my question is: what are the key details of that history? (If it's an inappropriate question here, I might move it to History.SE instead.)  Edit for requested clarity: I'm referring to work with an adult target audience, without specific implications of sexual or violent content (though these could well apply in some cases). "
775,How does Water style function in naruto?,So i get that with fire and lightning style you generally create a flame or electric current by turning the chakra into energy and with wind style you breathe in air but how does chakra create earth and water for those styles? we see that some use water that they drink much like gamatatsu and other jutsu depend on water near you but what about the shinobi who just spit out massive amounts of water without having any around or without being able to store it inside of them by drinking? is it like summoning from somewhere else or is it more along the lines of creating actual mass out of nothing?  
776,Light's Search History Death Note,"Why didn't L ever look at Light Yagami's Search history? Or why didn't the show ever address the fact that Light was looking up these criminals minutes before they died? That would trigger at least some sort of data traffic algorithm either set up by L or the Japanese government. So it seems to me that if any of these characters are as intelligent as the show makes them out to be they would've thought to look at his search history.   Don't tell me he probable cleared it or used an incognito tab because    Even if he cleared it his IP is registered on all of the Wikipedia and news sites for the criminals he researched and  They didn't state he used an incognito tab in the show so you can't assume that is the case.  ALSO Incognito doesn't even stop you from being tracked completely.    I swear this entire show is resolved by looking at his computers footprint. Also Given L literally lives on a laptop in the beginning of his character development, you'd think he'd know enough about computers and web traffic to realize how easy it would be to find ""Kira"". "
777,Why does everyone in My Hero Academia care about how Midoriya Izuku got his Quirk?,"They wanted to know because everyone knows that Midoriya was Quirkless, and so does All Might.  But why do they care about Midoriya's Quirk so much? Is it because All Might was Quirkless too when he was Midoriya's age? "
778,Who were the ten staff members behind Kemono Friends?,"One claim commonly made about Kemono Friends is that it was created by ""a staff of 10 over 500 days."" (This seems to source ultimately to this tweet.) Some people mention further that five of the ten were animators, but I don't have a source for that part.   Who were these ten staff members who created Kemono Friends?   The Anime News Network encyclopedia entry for the show offers six names. That's a start. If ""five animators"" is correct, presumably the missing four all shared that title, working under Animation Director Yoshihisa Isa. "
779,Is the Senran Kagura Anime/OVA related to the games plot wise?,So looking in my emails i noticed that there was a Senran Kagura Anime and a search on AniDB.net shows there is also an OVA.   I have Senran Kagura Shinovi Versus Let's Get Physical on the Vita and plan to get Senran Kagura Burst on the 3DS so i am wondering if the Anime and OVA of Senran Kagura are related to games plot wise? 
780,Reincarnated as a Slime -- Are the alphabets in the end credits real?,"The end credits for the anime series That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime have a unique trait which I am trying to understand.  Here is a capture from the end credits of episode 2:    (The end credits of episode 1 are actually the opening credits which had not been played up until the end. The opening credits are entirely in Japanese except with an overlay of the series' English title.)  The image captures a transition between the first alphabet shown and the second.  Each of the first two alphabets lasts for less than a second, when finally Japanese shows up for a few seconds.  Originally I thought the first language was Thai or Georgian or some similar-appearing language.  Now that I have done the screen capture, I'm pretty sure that neither of the first two are real writing systems.  Are they?  If not, is there some in game reason to show the credits in three alphabets? I get that theirs is a multicultural world, but so is ours, and we typically stick to one language in credits.  (I guess I should qualify that.  A number of different anime series will show multiple languages during the credits, but not transition between them.  If a Korean staff is being credited, that portion will be in Korean, If Filipino staff then that portion will be in English or Spanish, etc.) "
781,"Why Connie, Historia and the others have been kept separated from the others at the beginning of season 2?","In the beginning of season 2, all of these guys have been kept somewhere with a sense that they are dangerous. Why is that? How did they know that they might be dangerous?  Did I forget anything from season 1 or it is something that we have to wait and see maybe in season 3? "
782,Tokyo Ghoul re: Season 2 - What did Orca notice about Arima in his fight with him?,In the latest Tokyo Ghoul re: Season 2 episode 13. There is a fight scene between ccg investigators and Orca. In that scene what was Orca talking about Kishou Arima's eyes? He said that there is something strange about Arima and then he noticed something about his eyes. What was it that he noticed?  
783,What race are Emperor Pilaf and Garlic Jr.?,"In Dragon Ball, Piccolo and Kami are written as if they are demons from Earth, but in Dragon Ball Z, it is revealed that they are actually aliens from the planet Namek.    Another prominent character who looks like a demon, Emperor Pilaf, is never stated to be a Namekian, but he shares the odd skin tone and pointed ears of one.     Similarly, Garlic Jr. is Namekian-looking, minus the antenna, and seems to have some connection with Kami that is never fully explained.  He also doesn't seem to grow taller at all (Neither does Emperor Pilaf) and has the same approximate skin tone as Pilaf.    They're almost Namekian, but not quite, and don't seem to follow the same character design as other Namekians, and they seem to be permanently short, so I hesitate to call either of them Namekians.   I don't know if they're the same species, but they're very similar.    What exactly are these two characters?  An offshoot of Namekians?  Actual demons?  Or something else entirely?     "
784,Is this a Shonen Jump anime?,"So I've had this image for a while (just been trying to find it to use in the question).    I know that all four characters are from Shonen Jump and looks (to me) like a screenshot of an actual anime, but when I try to use Google reverse image search I either get other image hosting sites tagging all the characters uploaded by various users or a YouTube AMV. (I am assuming as it is an AMV I don't have sound but the description links to a song called ""Hear Me Now"". Also I don't see the image in question in the video so I think it's used as a thumbnail).   So I am wondering is there a Shonen Jump anime which stars Luffy, Naruto, Ichigo and Goku? "
785,Loss of shinobi abilities after overusage of Mangekyou Sharingan,"When a shinobi overuses the mangekyou sharingan, other than the vision (blindness), does he lose any other abilities as well? If so, what are they? "

787,How is the moon still Intact,"The sage of six paths sealed the remaining part of the Juubi and formed the moon. I'm guessing he did it in a planetary Devastation kinda way. If that were the case then the Gedo Statue should have been the Core of the moon.   When Madara Stole the Gedo Statue, Shouldn't that have upset the equilibrium at the Core? (Considering just how large the gedo Statue is). I'm trying to understand this cause assuming the Juubi was sealed into forming the moon then wouldn't releasing the Juubi also mean undoing the seal, thereby causing the the moon to like, fall or something? "
788,How many devil fruits we know about have been discovered?,I was wondering how many devil fruits have we seen in the manga since the beginning ?  Has someone ever counted how many of them exist ? 
789,Is MyAnimeList still good ranking site for anime?,"I am the type person who see anime based on ranked in MyAnimeList but now i am getting confused.  Example :  Darling in the FranXX The anime aired in Jan 13, 2018 to Jul 7, 2018 and the anime really got hyped especially with this character. First episode aired I watched it until ep 5, when I dropped it. The story, the development character and I question, why this anime so cliche but get high ranking in that time?   And before that Darling in the FranXX aired this anime show Imouto sae Ireba Ii. Aired in Oct 8, 2017 to Dec 24, 2017. Even this anime had the title meaning A Sister's All You Need but it doesn't really do with Siscon at all. Story about writer and their life and they have this special character too and guess what? This anime got really low ranked at the time.  My question is, does MyAnimeList really do a good job? Or should you just watch what you like? "
790,Why is Boruto's Dojutsu different?,"Usually most Dojutsu Kekkkai Genkai come in pairs. What I mean by this is, the Sharingan, Rinnengan, Byakugan and even Tensengan usually always come in pairs (for both eyes) but then Boruto only awakened his Jogan in just one eye.   Is there a solid explanation for this? or is it synonymous to how Sasuke only awakened his Rinnegan in only one eye? "
791,Can 18 absorb energy?,"In Dragon Ball Z, androids 19 and 20 can absorb energy. In the other hand, 17 and 18 had an infinite supply of energy. But according to ScrewAttack which uses to make very detailed analysis of superheroes from cartoons, animes, sci-fis, comics and videogames (they made a Goku vs Superman video with almost 40 million views) , 18 can absorb energy [website]"
792,Fastest-updating magazine,"Popular manga magazines like Weekly Shōnen Sunday and Weekly Shōnen Magazine update manga weekly. Others like Monthly Shōnen Sunday and Monthly Shōnen Magazine update monthly.  Are there manga magazines or standalone manga that update faster than weekly? If there are, which is the fastest-updating one? "
793,What does it take to kill a Ghoul?,"In Tokyo Ghoul, fodder ghouls were getting killed by stabs to the chest and stomach, but then there are people like Nishiki getting impaled repeatedly and destroyed by Shuu, but he still lives. Plus, there's Kaneki getting those... injuries at the end of part 1, but he also still lives.  Is Ishida just being inconsistent, or is there a reason for this? What does it take to kill a Ghoul? "
794,Are anime characters drawn seperately?,"Are anime characters drawn separately or together?  For example, Boy A is near but Boy B is far, and both are dancing. Is Boy B only drawn for his movements same as Boy A, and with the use of a software, they will overlap a character depending who is near or far. More like a cel animation but with layers using a software.  And does this apply to every anime series and anime character movements like when Boy A and Boy B are fighting and both have interaction with their sword, are they drawn separately or together?  More like this, are both drawn together or separately but with the use of a software, the girl's hand overlap the boy's body  I am talking about hand-drawn animes in papers, not hand-drawn animes with a drawing tablet.  (I have posted the same topic but I didn't know where it went, I don't know if it was posted or not, sorry if I have made 2 same topics) "
795,How do the various Yurikuma Arashi adaptations relate to each other?,"Since I liked Revolutionary Girl Utena and Mawaru Penguindrum, I'd like to watch the Yuri Kuma Arashi anime, particularly since it's spawned some interesting questions on this site.  Now, Wikipedia tells me that there is a manga, an anime series, and a light novel, which MyAnimeList give nearly identical summaries for (1, 2, 3). The Wikipedia description suggests that the announcement was first for an anime series, but the manga is ongoing and started first, whereas the anime is already done with. Moreover, the Wikipedia character lists suggests that the manga occasionally differs from anime characterization.  How do the various adaptations of Yurikuma Arashi relate?   Can I just assume that the ""original"" medium was the anime? Is the manga simply an adaptation, or is it the ""original"" work? The light novel and manga are listed as ""alternative versions"" on MAL. Are there any major content differences? (Is there anything comparable the differences between the two Fullmetal Alchemist continuities, or maybe even just the differences I've heard of between the various adaptations of the basic content of Revolutionary Girl Utena?)  "
796,Why don't more video games get full anime adaptations?,"In this definition of ""video game"", I am purposely excluding visual novels. By ""video game"", I generally mean anything you can play on a console (e.g. Chrono Trigger, Final Fantasy, Kingdom Hearts, Fire Emblem, etc...).  So most anime that airs each season is adapted from some form of source material, like a manga, a light novel, or a visual novel. Why aren't video games adapted as often? Sure, there are a few out there (Valkyria Chronicles, MapleStory, Devil May Cry, and of course Pokemon, to name a few), but overall, anime adapted from games tend to be much less frequent than those adapted from LNs or VNs.   Why is this? Why don't bigger title games (like the aforementioned Chrono Trigger or one of the many Final Fantasy games) get full-length anime adaptations? (I'm also not counting those small OVAs or side story series that have nothing to do with the actual in-game story either).  "
797,How was Obito able to use Kamui immediately after awakening his MS?,"In Episode 435 of Naruto Shippuden, Obito awakens his Mangekyo Sharingan and attacks the hidden mist ninja using the MS ability. However, he had no prior knowledge about the MS as Madara never explained it to him at this point.  So, how did Obito know about the Kamui Dimension after he suddenly awakened his MS? Madara never said that it can be a MS ability, nor Zetsu told him anything. Also, Kakashi figured about the Kamui much later. How did Obito figure out how to use the ability without training? "
798,"Did the ""Shuumatsu Nani Shitemasu ka?"" anime cut content from the novels?","As not so long ago the anime adaptation of the Shuumatsu Nani Shitemasu ka? Isogashii desu ka? Sukutte Moratte Ii desu ka? novel ended we were left with quite an open ending   My questions are the following: did the anime left some important content out (its normal to skip some as it can't be all adapted) and if so, how much? Furthermore, if I plan to read the novels, should I start from the beginning (if the anime skipped some parts) or start where the anime ended (if you could provide that information too I'd be very grateful)? "
799,Do Lag Seeing and Gauche Suede have eyebrows?,"I noticed something very perplexing while watching the Tegami Bachi anime: Gauche Suede and Lag Seeing don't appear to have eyebrows. This is a perplexing situation because they both have long hair that could be hiding their eyebrows. To make matters worse, the tops of their eyelids are both prominently drawn, so it's possible that I'm mistaking some of the lines for their eyebrows for their eyelids.  There doesn't seem to be a relationship between this shared feature and that both characters are Albisian, since Sylvette and Doctor Thunderland Jr. both have eyebrows (although notably, according to the wiki, it isn't confirmed that Doctor Thunderland is an Albisian).  This issue is so distracting that I find myself searching for their eyebrows whenever either one of them appears. Do Lag and Gauche have eyebrows? Is there any point in the anime or manga that clearly shows their eyebrows (or lack of eyebrows) or does a character ever acknowledge they don't have eyebrows? "
800,Why did FMA 2003 Wrath (King Bradley) keep his skull?,"In FMA 2003, homunculi are paralysed if they come into close proximity of a part of their original bodies. Wrath (Fuhrer King Bradley in 2003) was defeated by Mustang after his son brought him his skull, which he usually kept locked in a safe.  Why did he keep his skull? Why did he not simply destroy it or dispose of it in a place that he could not be traced to? "
801,Did we ever find out what happened with Nagi between Volumes 36 and 38?,"Spoilers, obviously, since this concerns the end of the Negima manga.  There were many confusing aspects of the ending of the Negima manga. Many, many confusing aspects. For a series that started out as Harry Potter crossed with Love Hina, it's amazing how many were the confusing aspects of the ending.  Nagi's appearances towards the end were possibly the most confusing. In 334th Period at the end of Volume 36, the group defeats the Averrunci, only to find that their leader, in the black robe, is apparently Nagi. He tells Negi: ""Kill me. Then it will all be over&hellip;I'll be waiting"" (KC USA translation), then disappears.  In Volumes 37 and 38, we go through the wrap-up to miscellaneous other plots, and it seems that no one says anything at all about Nagi, as the focus is mostly on Asuna. Then, in Volume 38, 355th Period, the story skips ahead seven years to the day of the Ala Alba reunion. And there's Nagi, sitting right there drinking tea with Albireo, Rakan, Eishun, and Evangeline. Nodoka, Yue, Makie, and Ku Fei are surprised to see him, but Konoka and Setsuna are just surprised to see him up and about, and make some remarks about his health.   What happened? Is there any supplemental material that explains how we went from the events of 334th Period to what we see in 355th Period? I read a blog saying there was some kind of legal issue going on at the time Akamatsu finished Negima, which may have led him to finish it early. Did that have anything to do with this? The entire story began with Negi wanting to find his father, so it seems pretty odd to go through 37 volumes of material, set up the story where'd he'd finally accomplish this goal, and then totally skip it. "
802,Why did Yukine stop stinging Yato?,"Some people are unable to control their natural urges, so if Yukine was thinking that way and stung Yato, why is it after the whole issue he stopped stinging? And if he continues to feel that way, what then will happen to Yato?  How did the stinging just stop? "

804,Why did Rei abandon Gendo for Shinji?,"When Gendo tries to merge Adam's Embryo with Rei to start his version of Third Impact, Rei rejects Gendo stating that Shinji needs her from inside EVA Unit 01, and that she is not a puppet of Gendo's any longer. What happened after that is cryptic to me, I'm still trying to piece it together.  Now, Rei knew the reason for her creation, what she was supposed to bring about when all of the Angels were finally defeated, but she outright rejected Gendo, and instead tried to aid Shinji during Third Impact, ultimately denying and overruling her purpose in the grand scheme of things.  What was Rei's reason for abandoning Gendo and aiding Shinji, other than deciding not be a puppet any more? Did Rei abandon Gendo for Shinji, because of Yui's maternal instincts kicking in when Shinji called out for her, seeing that she is a clone of Yui? "
805,Why doesn't Sasuke use Shadow clones?,"In one episode, when young Naruto and Sasuke were to fight each other in a duel guided by Iruka Sensei, Sasuke was able to create his shadow clone easily. Also, according to How Itachi was able to use Shadow clone?, Shadow clone Jutsu is not imposed by any bloodline limits.   So why does Sasuke did not use this useful technique in any of his fights? And why neither of Naruto's friends from Team 11 seems to interest in learning this jutsu?  Naruto has showcased in his most fights that Shadow clone jutsu can be very useful. Sure many Ninja must have felt intrigued to learn it? "
806,Where does the manga for Beyblade original series end in comparision to the anime?,"I found on the web that there are some differences in the storyline of the manga and the anime (English) of Beyblade (original series). In my quest to know the differences I tried to find the manga online (legal), but I've yet to know for certain how many volumes/chapters (of the manga) are available for the original Beyblade series. Wikipedia shows that there are 14 issues available. But the description about Vol. 14 here is the source of confusion for me. It says:     It's down to the final battle in the G.B.C.--the ultimate test to see which team will earn the title of Beyblade world champions! Tyson's grandfather and friends start celebrating victory before the final battle even takes place--but will the BBA Revolution actually win?         I just completed the series and the aforesaid description fits into Episode 30 of the Season 3 G-Revolution where BBA team stands victorious in final round of Beyblade World Championship. Also, Season 3 ran for 52 episodes and the episodes after Episode 30 dealt with a challenge named BEGA.    This is exactly my confusion. If I consider the description then it means almost 40 p.c. of anime aren't present in the last issue, Vol. 14 of manga series, and this seems to be a major difference.  Now, it all comes down to the following points:   Am I missing something about manga of the said series? Could it be that the said description is incomplete or wrong? Where does the final issue of manga end? Would manga be enough to reflect the complete storyline of anime? Meaning, does there exist mini-series too? Optional: where can I buy/get the complete manga for the said series?  "
807,Do Claymore manga and anime have different endings?,"I am reading the Claymore manga. There are around 5 chapters left before I finish it. In chapter 150 of the manga, I see that Teresa is alive, but I am pretty sure that in the anime, she was killed by Priscilla, and Priscilla was defeated by Clare at the end of the anime.  The difference in the endings of the storylines of the manga and the anime has confused me. Can you tell me what's going on here? Or does this simply mean that the anime's storyline is different from that of the manga? "
808,Who did Amasawa-san go see in the hospital?,"As we find out at the end of the series…      Amasawa Yuuko's brother actually died in an accident some years ago and was not in a coma like she thought.   So who did she go visit in the hospital then? Was it a very complicated hologram and she's never taken her glasses off the entire time (hard to believe, but not impossible)? Or was it another person in disguise hired by the Megamass? "
809,Sengoku as General Inspector?,"After the War, many things changed with the Marine.  There are new unknown Admirals, but does anybody know what Sengoku's new position is?  (After timeskip, he doesn't seem very serious any more)    I found this in the Wiki:     Sengoku the Buddha was the fleet admiral of the Marines during the   first half of the series. He was the successor of Kong and the   predecessor of Sakazuki. He was also one of the major figures along   with Whitebeard, Shiki, and Monkey D. Garp during the times when Gol   D. Roger was still alive, and still continues to be in the present,   even after his resignation from the Marines. Sometime during the   timeskip, he became a General Inspector.   Does anybody know what ""General Inspector"" is? "
810,"Chaos;Head, Steins;Gate, Robotics;Notes: where is all the extra information?","To make it short: I watched all three anime adaptations, but after browsing the questions here for 5 minutes I feel like I don't know anything about them...  Where is all this extra information hidden?   (More specific question:) I am searching for information about 2 things.   ""Hidden"" information which is only for one story. ""Hidden"" information which is cross-story (at least two stories ""combined"")   Now I'll specify what I mean with that.   (This example is not related to the stories in the title.) For example, something like the real name of L (from Death Note). Something like ""What is DaSH?""   I do NOT want you to list all the secrets and easter-eggs! I only want to know where, and (maybe) how to find them. If there are manga with extra information, please give me the title. Or if there are articles on the internet about it, please give me a link.  (I know that there are visual novels for all the stories listed in the title. I'm going to watch/read/play them soon.) "
811,Saiyan Power Levels?,"I was wondering how was Gohan so much stronger as a normal Saiyan than Goku was as SS3 when he fought Buu. Is there not like a power level to reach the next SSJ form?    Power level example:   10,000 to reach SS1  100,000 to reach SS2 etc.   Why couldn't Gohan reach SS3 already? Or he could fight as SS2 at least?  Maybe I have to rewrite my question again:  If you read the list below,    SS1 is always at about 25,000,000 SS2 is always at about 49,000,000   If Gohan with the Mystic Sword is as strong as Goku was as SS3, there wouldn't be any difference in their strength when he would transform into SS3? "
812,Why are Sharingan users less susceptible to genjutsu?,"I can't remember where I saw this, but sometime today, I saw something like: ""The Sharingan helps the Uchiha counter genjutsu"" and i've been thinking about it for a while now. Can anyone explain how the Sharingan helps the Uchiha counter genjutsu?  I understand that users of the Sharingan can easily use genjutsu on others, but how does the Sharingan help them counter the effects of genjutsu? "
813,Can Gohan transform to Super Saiyan in Mystic form?,"In DBZ, we see that the Elder Kai fully awakens the dormant power of Gohan. In this state Gohan can match Buu in his unfused form. But after Buu absorbs Piccolo and Gotenks, why doesn't Gohan go Super?  Is there any reason that Gohan couldn't transform to Super Saiyan form after the awakening?   Edit 1: Removed the transformation in GT from consideration because DBZ and GT are seperate canons.  Edit 2: Dragon Ball Super has canon continuity to DBZ and I've heard talks of Ultimate Gohan in it. Has more information been provided on Gohan's transformation in DBS? Please Note: Yet to see DBS beyond the intial movies. "
814,Is Hyouge Mono historically accurate?,"The anime and manga, Hyouge Mono, is set in the Sengoku era and follows tea related items. I can see that in general the events of the era seem to be more or less accurate, and all the wacky outfits probably aren't accurate (or are they?), but I'm wondering about the tea related aspect of the series.   Did the warlords of the time (especially Oda Nobunaga) have tea masters and treasure master crafted tea-ware in any way like they're portrayed in Hyouge Mono? Are any of the crafted items, at least the ones with proper names, real items from the period? "
815,"Is Ashura the actual creator of the ""Rasengan""?","So as you can see in the fillers, that when Ashura is helping out the other villagers, he is using a jutsu just like the Rasengan.    Is this the Rasengan we know and love, or is this a different jutsu for say a wind release? If it is indeed the Rasengan, then does this mean that Ashura is the original creator, and not Minato Namikaze? If the second one is true, this could mean that Minato has some relations with the Ōtsutsuki?  "
816,Is Prelude to Paradise the same song as one of Hunter x Hunter (2011)'s soundtrack?,"I recently listened to the song Prelude to Paradise by Immediate Music and I'm pretty sure that the beginning (until at least 00:45) is nearly exactly the same track as one of HxH's songs (OST 1 or 2). It's probably one of the Zoldyck Family's themes.  Am I wrong? If not, what song is it?  Finally, if I'm right, is there any link between those two? I'm pretty sure they are extremely similar (well, at least the beginning), but Prelude to Paradise came out more than 4 years ago.... "
817,"Which is the series ""Lost Sheep"" of which plush doll Subaru Konoe is fan of?","While searching for the answer of my question What do the sheep dolls represent in Mayo Chiki? I found out that the plush doll is from the the popular series ""Lost Sheep"" as stated in Wikipedia.     she enjoys instant noodles and is also a fan of the popular ""Lost Sheep"" series of plush dolls.   When I searched for the series ""Lost Sheep"" I found about the Parable of the Lost Sheep. I tried to search using different Keyword but the result is same. It leads to the Parable of the Lost Sheep but in different site and presented in different manner.  Is this the series that is stated in Wikipedia Or there is another series? "
818,How does the Elementary School Principal get away with so much?,"In Gakuen Alice, the Elementary School Principal is involved with a lot of things that seem to be illegal, including     the death of Mikan's father.   Is it ever said in the manga how he can get away with that? Why doesn't anyone (including the government) stop him or at least try to prosecute him? "
819,Why was Akira naked in the first episode of Eden of the East?,"Why was Akira naked in the beginning of Eden of the East?  Supposedly it was revealed later on in the series. However, I wasn't able to pick it up despite having watched it through in depth.  Could someone provide a summary? "
820,What are the limitations of the Flying Thunder God technique (Flying Raijin Jutsu)?,"More specifically, how many objects can a user mark simultaneously?   If it's an infinite number, then why don't they mark all the objects around them?  Also, besides the number count issue, what other limitations are there? "
821,How does Orochimaru exist in all of his curse marks,"Orochimaru gave quite a lot of people curse marks and i'm not sure if this is mentioned in the series but it seems like most of all those curse marks had Orochimaru living in them.  What i mean by this is: Orochimaru was able to come out of Sasuke's curse mark (during Sasuke's battle with Itachi). And also, Sasuke used Anko's curse mark to perform a reverse curse sealing Jutsu to revive Orochimaru.  Does that mean orochimaru kinda did the same thing that Voldermoth did in Harry potter? (Like seal bits of himself into all his curse seals?) but then wouldn't that mean that since he sealed pieces of himself into lots of other people then he should have lost some powers or stuff? However, Orochimaru seemed to be getting weak because his vessels couldnn't contain him. *Was an explanation on how his curse seals work ever given? *  I'm finding it difficult in grasping exactly how the Cursed seals that Orochimaru used work. Especially how he could be revived using any of the cursed seals. Can anyone clarify? "
822,Is it logical that Enel's power is ineffective against Luffy?,"According to the One Piece wikia's Enel page, Enel's power won't work against Luffy because he is a rubber-man. But at some point, I'm confused from this fact since lighting that strikes at 1 Million Volts would burn anything, even rubber. Also, he melted gold and placed on Luffy's hand.  So my question is, is there any logical reason why is it that Luffy doesn't feel any hurt when Enel strikes him?? I will not include what episodes this happen. "
823,"What does it mean to have ""powerful"" chakra?","Tobi once stated that he (referring to Madara) was born with an especially strong chakra.  That is the only time we ever hear about the ""power"" of chakra! We know that one can have a lot of chakra, and we know he can learn to utilize his chakra efficiently. But what does ""strong"" chakra mean?  Does it make his techniques more powerful than other, less power chakra users? Does it mean that his YinYang balance is naturally stronger? Does it make him live longer? "
824,Why was the American flag censored in Excel Saga?,"I have searched all over for an answer to this and there doesn't seem to be a satisfactory answer to me. One theory says that it's a light offensive joke aimed at Americans, a subtle way of calling us dicks because of how it's usually only offensive material that are censored on TV. Another theory says that it's actually to not offend Americans, since they couldn't render all the stars or that it might not be displayed appropriately. I'm not so sure I'm convinced with that since Excel Saga's main audience is not American, at least, I don't think it is.  Why was the American flag censored in episode 17 of Excel Saga? Have there been other instances where national flags are censored or is there some sort of regulation to censor flags that they must follow?    Relevant clip: [website]At around 0:39 "

828,What did Enel do after being defeated?,"As shown in the Manga and the Anime, Enel survived along with the Ark.  He then Embarks to Fairy Verth      The Moon.   In the Manga it shows his adventures on the Moon.  But what happened?  I didn't understand the situation that happened.  What exactly happened on the Moon? "

831,Is it possible to transfer Shinigami powers accidentally?,"In Bleach, Rukia transfers her Shinigami powers to Ichigo by having him stab himself in the chest with her zanpakuto.   If a person is stabbed in the chest by a zanpakuto, can they absorb half of the Shinigami's powers, or does it have to be intentional? If it does have to be intention, is there any reason given for that? "
832,"How is Phantom a ""top sniper"" when they seem to spend little time actually acting as snipers?","On several occasions, Phantom's role in Inferno is described by Scythe Master. For example, in the beginning of ep. 11:     Phantom&hellip; the strongest assassin in Inferno&hellip; the title given to the top sniper in the organization&hellip;   I can see how Ein and Zwei are the strongest assassins in Inferno, but I'm confused by the designation of ""top sniper."" To me, ""top sniper"" suggests that the person specializes and is especially proficient in, well, sniping. But Ein and Zwei spend a lot of time in the series (at least up to ep. 10) in close quarters combat or situations that lead to close quarters combat. It was probably intended that they fight in such situations, given that they follow certain instructions when carrying out orders. They also seem to have been specially trained for such situations, based on what I remember from ep. 2 and 3. The only instance that I recall where Phantom serves as a sniper outright is in ep. 7, where Ein is ordered to shoot people who are overseeing a narcotics shipment.  In contrast, other fictional snipers that I can recall, such as Riza Hawkeye from Fullmetal Alchemist and Sinon from Sword Art Online, clearly have a background in sniping, even if they end up in close quarters combat on numerous occasions.  How is then Phantom a ""top sniper""? Or is there something I'm misunderstanding, either about the nature of Phantom's work, or about what snipers typically do? "
833,Who are the characters on the girls' planes in Shirobako?,"In the intro to Shirobako, the girls are shown flying in fighter jets. Each of them has a design under the cockpit - presumably related to the characters.  I can't figure them all out though.    This is the easiest one, the two toys are delusions of Aoi's that she interacts with often during the show.    Shizuka's plane has the  pig with a plum-shaped nose. This was the character that she got to play in costume during one of the episodes.    Misa's plane has a depiction of a penguin - from the show that inspired her to join the company she was making tires for.  However, I don't know what the final two are referring to.     Did I miss something obvious? Any ideas how these pictures / characters are related to the cast? "
834,What is this 'Japanese Secret Police' Furuya Rei is in? Are they a real police division?,"Conan mentioned that he probably worked for the Japanese Secret Police, but who are they exactly? Under what jurisdiction of Japanese law enforcement are they under? Are they like MI5 or something? "
835,What are the numbers in the background in Sae's room?,"In the 4th season of Hidamari Sketch, Honeycomb, there's scenes where there's a bunch of numbers (and an HK with a ""honeycomb"" symbol) in the background. Do these numbers have any significance? Are they related to production cuts (sometimes shown in ""flash card"" style during Bakemonogatari, another Studio Shaft production)?  Examples:  Episode 1:  Bottom right corner: HK 01105  Episode 5:  Bottom right corner: HK 05274  Episode 6:  Bottom right corner: HK 06333  Episode 10:  Bottom right corner: HK 10133  Episode 12:  Bottom right corner: HK 12074  Not sure if I missed any, but it looks like a 2 digit episode number and 3 digits of something else. Also, not sure if previous seasons of Hidamari Sketch has these, been a while since I've seen them. What do the other strings of numbers, that don't seem to change, mean? "
836,There's any clue on why Battle Programmer Shirase ended so abruptly?,"There's any clue on why Battle Programmer Shirase ended so abruptly? I couldn't find any interview or related material about it, even in Japanese. It's sad that is, 14 years already? Without end or an explanation. "
837,Does the mark on Kimimaro's forehead have any significance?,"Kimimaro Kaguya has two dots on his forehead. In South Asia, it is called a bindi. Is it an identification mark, or does it have any significance like a curse mark? Is there any canon reason given for it?  I came across a source which said that it represents his clan, but the Kaguya clan doesn't have significant history in Naruto/Shippuden anime or manga. Is there any source for this claim?   "
838,How did Madara pull the Meteor stunt,"During the 4th great Ninja war, Madara caused a supersized meteor to fall on the entire battlefield.   How was this possible? the Wiki states that he summoned a meteorite but that can't be true, he never weaved any signs for summoning. (or at least the Susanoos hand seal does not resemble the ones for summoning.    Can anyone clarify how this happened? Is this a Susanoo only Jutsu? or is it more like Madara's sharingans ocular power? "
839,Why is there a Hindi poster in Boku no Hero Academia?,"I was curious as to why would the animators use a language other than Japanese and English given the fact that no one in Japan understands Hindi?

840,For how long have humans and vampires coexisted?,"The timeline in Owari no Seraph is a little bit confusing to me.   When did vampires first come into contact with humans? I was initially under the impression that this happened when the ""disease"" struck some 5-10 years before the ""present"" of the show (i.e. ""during episode 1"") - but if that's the case, where did the vampires come from at that point in time? Given that they have robust, structured, hierarchical societies, it can't be that they just appeared out of nowhere then, could it?   And if the vampires have been around longer than that, where were they, and how is it that a modern human society didn't run into them sooner?  "
841,How does the hole in a Hollow's chest work?,"In Bleach, Hollows (and Espadas) have holes in their chest. However, the holes do not bleed and seem to have no harmful effects on the body. For human-shaped Hollows and Espada, do the organs rearrange themselves around the holes or just cease to exist where the holes are? Also, how do the holes not bleed? Does skin grow around inside the holes or are the cauterized?  "
842,How did Rimuru get the human form?,"I have not read the manga or light novel of That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime and I am wondering, how did Rimuru Tempest get his/her human form?  Could it be that he killed and ate the girl who imprisoned Veldora? Because I see that his/her appearance is so similar to her...   "
843,Are anime still submitted to broadcasters in tape form?,"In Shirobako, the studio has to deliver the tapes to broadcasters physically. I'm not surprised that this is a process, but I am surprised that there's nothing more modern in place.   Early on, we learn that Musani Animation has an FTP server to store their files - So why don't they just send the file over the internet?    I've heard some arguments that physical deliver is still faster, but I'm not sure I buy that - Japan's internet speeds are quite good and the file sizes shouldn't be overly huge as it should be the compiled product rather than files with image layers, audio tracks, cg models, etc all seperate.  Are anime really still submitted by tape? If so - why? "
844,How is Kyousuke able to teleport Andy?,"In the anime Zettai Karen Children: The Unlimited - Hyoubu Kyousuke, Andy Hinomiya is an esper who negates the power of all other espers. Yuugiri cannot read his mind, Kyousuke can't hypnotize him, telekinetic attacks are ineffectual against him. So how is it possible for Kyousuke to teleport him in episode 3? They're walking away and he snaps his fingers and the entire group teleports away. Is it that Andy really isn't completely immune to ESP? Or is the teleportation a side-effect of an ESP power so it isn't negated?  To clarify the side-effect thing, You Fujiura's ESP can effect sound waves, though the ESP itself can be negated by Andy, the actual sound that the ESP creates (or deadens) can be heard by Andy (episode 2). "
845,Why not export to America?,"I've come across many forums and fan-sites of various anime. It seems that of the 300 million people in America, there's a huge market for anime, specifically in the gaming and streaming industries (as evidenced by the JRPGs and Hulu/Netflix having specific anime sections).   Why aren't more anime that aren't renewed for second seasons in Japan sent over to America for investment and continuation?  Note: I understand when an anime is cut off because the Manga is not being written. At the same time, could the IP of an author not be bought and turned into an American anime? "
846,"Why do Spirited Away, Ponyo, and Arrietty have so much in common?","I saw that Spirited Away, Ponyo and Arrietty, all written by Hayao Miyazaki, seem to have some common traits:   The hero is a girl. Moreover, she is a girl who is special in some way. She develops a friendship with a boy that is an ""insider"" and they help each other. She seems to take a spiritual maturity journey while also building that friendship.   Is there some mystical connection to these themes or it is a mere coincidence? Can someone shed some light on this matter? "
847,Which song is this from Prince of Tennis?,I have a burning question that I haven't been able to get an answer to in a long time.

Any help'd be much appreciated! ^_^ 
848,Was Mitsuki decieved into being friends with Boruto?,"Mitsuki has subtly hinted various times in the anime, that he is unsure of if his will is actually his own.       During the Mitsuki disappearnace Arc, Mitsuki  attempts to go to Iwagakure and even goes as far as to attack boruto with lighning, in order to verify if his feelings were created (by his father, Orochimaru), Boruto Episode 79. And it does make sense, considering how much of a calculating genius his father is.   To clarify this, is Mitsuki's doubts about his will signs of emotional issues? or did Orochimaru plan for mitsuki to become friends with boruto (and in a way, impose his will on mitsuki while making mitsuki think it was his own?  "
849,What's the difference between Kage Bunshin no Jutsu and Tajuu Kage Bunshin no Jutsu?,"While the Kage Bunshin no Jutsu seems to be taught, the Tajuu Kage Bunshin no Jutsu is sealed, so nobody can learn the jutsu. Does that mean that there's a difference between these jutsus, aside from the number of Kage Bunshin created?   Or, why was the Tajuu Kage Bunshin no Jutsu sealed away? If there's no other difference, everybody could use this without reading the sealed scroll. "
850,How do characters in Naruto train to use elemental jutsus besides the wind nature?,"We already know how Naruto trained to use his element.

852,"Watching order for ""Toaru Majutsu no Index"" and related anime","I am slowly coming to the end of watching ""Toaru Majutsu no Index"" anime. There are a few anime series related to that world:   Toaru Majutsu no Index Toaru Majutsu no Index II Toaru Kagaku no Railgun Toaru Kagaku no Railgun S   and some movies. But I am not sure in what order I should watch them. Someone told me that ""Railgun"" came after ""Majutsu no Index"" - should I watch ""Railgun"" first then, or the second season of ""Index""? Are there some things that I can miss if I watch them in the wrong order, like not knowing characters that were already introduced?   And if it is Railgun I should watch second, should I watch ""Toaru Majutsu no Index II"" afterwards, or ""Toaru Kagaku no Railgun S""? Or is it that it really doesn't matter and I can watch both of the ""Toaru Majutsu no Index"" series before the two ""Toaru Kagaku no Railgun"" series? "
853,Does the technique Kyoka Suigetsu make Rikuo intangible or just create illusions of him?,"In the anime Nurarihyon no Mago, when Rikuo uses Kyoka Suigetsu, enemy attacks appear to pass through him as if he were an intangible ghost. Is the technique creating illusions or actually making him ""untouchable""? It is stated that he can ""distort opponent's perceptions"" with the technique, but it is also said that he can ""distort his presence, even when he is still there"". So: are enemy attacks passing through illusions, passing through him, or a combination of both these things? "
854,Are anime OP/ED theme songs original?,"Are anime OP/ED theme songs original? Is it like after creating an anime, the producer hires a singer to sing a song for the OP/ED theme for that anime, or do they just use songs that the singer already sang for his album or something like that? "
855,What happens to a Titan Shifter if they die without being eaten?,"The question is very vague, so let me clear up some of the confusion and haze.  In the entirety of AoT, it is known that, to inherit the powers of a Titan Shifter, the chosen one must eat the current holder, absorbing their spinal fluid as they do so, as is the curse of Ymir. But what happens to the Titan abilities should the current Titan Shifter be killed in different circumstances, besides being eaten by the Inheritor of said power?  What if the Titan Shifter is killed in combat by being blindsided on the battlefield, for instance? Or dies under mysterious circumstances? Is the power still retained by the holder's corpse, or does the power ""drain"" away when they die?  "
856,Can a Devil Fruit user pass on powers to their children?,"If a Devil Fruit user has a child with a person or another Devil Fruit user, would said child have a similar power, the same power, or no power and just be a regular child? Because from what I've seen in a lot of superhero movies, when they have kids, their kids might have the same or similar power. Would Devil Fruit powers be any different from that? "
857,Is there a trope for exotic-sounding names?,"I'm talking about names that transliterate poorly to the Japanese tongue such as Light-Raito, L-Eru, Lelouch-Ruruush, Bleach-Bureechu (yes they all have an l, especially our one-lettered detective). Do manga authors place a premium on unpronounceable names because they sound the most foreign?  Apparently people eyes is a symbol of exotic. [website]"
858,Does (Taju) Kage Bushin no Justu return the user his Chakra after he undoes this jutsu?,"We have always seen Naruto using this technique - Taju Kage Bushin no Jutsu. I agree that Naruto's stamina is 5/5, but.. he uses the technique for an unbelievable number of times.  For example, let's say he has a chakra level of 100%, and he creates 3 clones, which means each clone will have 25% chakra of the original.    If 3 clones get destroyed by an opponent, or Naruto undoes the jutsu    In both cases, Naruto learns the information the clones have gathered. Do they also return their chakra back to Naruto?  Ideally, they should return in case 2! However, I am not sure about case 1.  If they don't, then Naruto's chakra level should go down exponentially, as long as he creates new clones.   Now since Naruto has mastered Senjutsu (which of course has a time limit), he can create 2 clones in the battlefield itself with the help of natural energy. Also with Nine Tails chakra, he can create unlimited number of clones, because Tailed Beasts possess unlimited (compared to human limits) amount of chakra. But how about his battles prior to his Senjutsu or Nine-Tails form? "
859,There's a manga I like and I want it published in the West. What can I do about it?,"It's not just one single manga, there are quite a few that I like and that are not published in the West. Some of them are moderately popular in Japan, but most are obscure. The vast majority are seinen and their serialization has finished.  How do I get these comics published in the West and is it something I can do on my own?  The only ideas I've come up with are with regards to contacting Western and/or Japanese publishers. The former would be just a request of sorts, whereas the latter would involve asking to purchase license, but that pretty much becomes a business on its own and I am not sure if that's what I want. Any other ideas? I am willing to part with a decent amount of resources for every manga, so I am open to any suggestions. The publication medium doesn't matter, both physical and digital are acceptable, though I find the latter a bit more appropriate nowadays.    EDIT: To make it more clear, I am looking for a way to bring some of my favourite manga to the Western audience, not how to purchase manga copies. To illustrate this with an example from the literary world: Suppose I wanted to translate a book from a foreign language to English. It would be perfectly acceptable to approach the author, and/or their publisher, with a sample translation and then potentially negotiate a deal. Or it's not uncommon to directly speak with a publisher who's willing to publish the book and then they do the rest of the negotiation (and legal affairs) on your behalf. "
860,CC's loss of memory,I'm confused about the whole scene as to how and why CC lost her memory.    Why did she lose her memory? It is because she was not letting herself out of CC's world/ the collective consciousness? How exactly did she (and Lelouche) destroy the first temple of Akasha?  
861,"How does ""at all"" mean ""no hair""?","In Aoishiro, on the 2nd day during Lunch, Momoko is complaining about the lack of animal protein in the meals Yasumi has prepared, who has been trying to keep to vegetarian Buddhist Meals.  Momoko asks Suzuki Yuukai, the monk of the temple, if he would run her out of the temple if she ate meat, he says:     I don't condemn eating meat at all.   (Literally, ""at all"" = ""no hair"")   This is what Yuukai looks like    After reading the liner notes of Maria Watches Over Us, I know that some humor in Japanese language comes from puns on how words look very similar but have vastly different meanings only because of one character of the placing of a space.  I know Yuukai is bald, however, I don't get how not condemning eating meat at all = him having no hair, as at dinner on the second day, he points out that he does eat meat (asking Shouko if his ""Iron Body"" could come from a vegetarian diet). I played the English fan translated version.  So I am wondering, is this actually some sort of pun only understandable if you know Japanese (i.e. read the original Japanese text)? What exactly does he mean? "
862,Which Kennedy oration is Onsa adapting in episode 1?,"In episode 1 of Bakuon!!, around 20 minutes in, Onsa indicates that she is going to borrow from John F. Kennedy, and says what Crunchyroll translates as the following:      In exporting motorcycles throughout the world, our nation of Japan has brought liberty and justice to all. And yet, could you say to your heart, ""Freedom, except for Suzuki riders,"" that we are all equal before the Lord except for Suzuki?   Which Kennedy oration is she taking that from? Also, here is a picture of anime JFK.   "
863,What clan is Kawaki from?,"     The Boruto manga has shown Kawaki to posses some form of sage transformation ability, very similar to that of Juugo's and this leads me to wonder if Kawaki might be a relative to Juugo or maybe from a clan that is closely related to Juugo's? or like the relationship between the Uzumaki and Senju clan and something along those lines?   This leads me to ask; is it known what clan Kawaki is from, and has the manga left any other subtle hints which could help in figuring out his roots? "
864,How is a technique categorized as a Kekkei Genkai?,"During the Land of Waves arc, Kekkei Genkai is defined as techniques which are unique to a clan and passed down through the bloodline. After timeskip, it is touched upon again, and is now defined as a technique which combines two elements. Looking back at the Land of Waves arc, Haku's Ice Release satisfies this definition as well.   However, Sharingan and Byakugan are also called Kekkei Genkai, although they do not combine any elements. Later, Terumi Mei is showed to use Lava release and Boil release, and they are both considered Kekkei genkai, although it appears that this is something unique she achieved, not passed down through bloodline.  Thus, the term kekkei genkai seems to be used in various contexts to mean either:   Bloodline techniques passed down through generations, but not involving combining basic elements (Sharingan, Byakugan users)   Techniques combining basic elements, but not passed down through bloodline. (Terumi Mei, and a few others)   Combining basic elements and passed down through bloodline (Haku)   What exactly does it mean?  Edit It looks like people have not understood the question. Let me try again.  Does kekkei genkai mean: A. techniques passed down through blood. B. techniques which combine basic elements. C. Both A and B.  The answers as well the commenter below seem to have assumed ""A"". To make it even easier, here's a related follow-up question: ""If Naruto learns Lightning Release, and then combines with his Wind Release, would that be kekkei genkai or not?"" "
865,Can Poké Balls technically catch humans?,"In the Pokémon franchise (I'll accept answers from any canon source, whether the anime, manga, games or anything else I can't think of), Poké Balls are used to catch Pokémon. Could you, in theory, use them to catch a human being? Is there any canon example of someone attempting it (I suppose it has probably occurred at some point in the anime for example)? Is there any canonical factor that makes it technically impossible (such as ""Humans and Pokémon are fundamentally different"", but I think I remember that this isn't true) or is it possible in theory but simply not done in practice?  EDIT : My question is different from the general ""How does a Poké Ball work"" question because I'm specifically asking whether / why it can not catch humans. The answer to the other question does address this, but in passing, and it does not provide any sources, and links to a page that may have been a good source in the past, but is now devoid of any relevant content (or canon quotes) so it doesn't really answer my question. "
866,"Who exactly are featured on the walls of Maria, Rose & Sina?","I'm not sure whether this question will make sense or not but what is the symbolism or meaning behind the logos or symbols that are associated with the walls of Maria, Rose &amp; Sina?      Are they suppose to represent the current King or are they some sort of recognizement of some past Kings and Queens in AOT in the last 100 years? What are the logos suppose to mean? Who is in them? If its not a person, is it suppose to represent or show how humans have managed to survive from titans in 100 years?  I haven't watched the anime in a while so whether it was revealed or not (I am not sure) however I am pretty sure they didn't address it. Does anyone know? "
867,How was Robin able to stand despite being cuffed with Seastone?,"In chapter 398 we can see how Robin has enough energy to stand straight, walk around, tell a long story and shout across the ravine, despite being handcuffed with Seastone handcuffs.    While in chapter 730 we can see how Luffy becomes completely immobilized after touching the bars of the Colosseum.    Where does Robin get all this energy from? How come her energy isn't completely drained as it was with Luffy's? "
868,Is the person who appeared at the very end of Fate/Stay Night UBW (desert scene) Archer or Shirou?,"Right after Archer ended his monologue, he fades away. Then we see Shirou (or Archer) walking in a desert.  I wouldn't have any doubts concerning this scene whether it's Shirou or Archer (it would've been Archer who's taking part in a new mission) if he hadn't had orange hairs which don't fit Archer. So if it's not him, then it has to be Shirou in the future. If that's true, then why is he travelling alone and not with Rin?  According to a review and two similar questions on Reddit, there might also be a third possibility which Kinoko Nasu (author of Fate/Stay Night) explained (though, it seems it was only a suggestion or request to ufotable which hadn't been accepted by this studio):  “Desert scene- After the end credits. A desert scene, same as the opening. Shirou walks alone. His strength falters and he stops walking. Shirou looks down to shield his eyes from the sandstorm and sees traces of someone else having been there (the place where Archer stopped). Shirou breathes out and looks up. There’s fake endurance in his expression, but it’s full of hope. Shirou walks away with a steady gait. The camera lingers on the traces of Archer’s presence, and watches Shirou leave as the shot ends.”  According to this explanation (if ufotable did accept Kinoko's suggestion, but only changed it a bit), this scene might be just some sort of a metaphor which hints that Shirou will be able to make a step forward and therefore doesn't have to suffer like Archer. Or is this supposed to be a time leap and not a metaphor?  What's the right conclusion? "
869,Who is first lieutenant Schrödinger?,"I still can't seem to grasp his abilities and character.   Do we have more information regarding Schrödinger? He's everywhere and nowhere, but how does that work in case his head is blown off?   Could anyone try and shed some light?  "

871,Is there a difference in terms of story etc when watching a dubbed anime over a subbed?,"I was wondering if you actually miss out on anything from watching the dubbed version of a series (E.g. Magi- Labyrinth of Magic over watching the subbed version of it)?  Everytime I watched dubbed animes, my friend in particular use to moan about a lot of things such as the voices sound horrible and you miss out on more of the storyline through improvisation and other stuff such as cuts on certain lines and sayings. Ever I was oblivious or just plain blind but I actually never noticed this before (besides the voices of course) and since I have never actually watched the same of an anime series in both dubbed and then re-watched it in subbed to compare it, do you actually miss out on anything important or paramount?  Is there any difference in terms of the story, how the characters are developed or how the storyline runs when you watch a dubbed anime over the subbed version of it which is in Japanese? Do you miss out on anything or is this just my friend trying to persuade me to only watch it in subbed which I highly suspect. "
872,What is this anime about people who can transform themselves into giant robots with the help of a device/talisman?,"I only saw the last part of this Anime. A few minutes. So, I cannot give many details. I think it was a movie and I think it was around the 2nd half of the 1990s. Because it was on a weekend program where they showed Anime movies and once ""X (1999)"" was one of them.   What I remember from that short scene:   The Anime is about people, who can transform themselves into giant robots with the help of a device/talisman (?). However, the transformation rips their clothes apart and when hey change back, they are totally naked. The protagonist is a girl. She has straight, shoulder-lenght, brown(ish) hair and she wears it in pigtails maybe. Anyway, her hair is tied up somehow. Either she cannot transform till the end of the movie or she has problems with fighting... but in the end she transforms and fights well. There is and older guy (not old!), who may be her ""teacher"", who teaches her how to transform(?) He has brown hair and glasses I guess. In that end scene he came to help the girl out but she did well on her own, so he just watches and changes back. Being experienced, he brought spare clothes with him, but there is a giant dog (I think it is his) that takes them. So the guy ends up chasing the dog naked. They were under a bridge that time. The art was great and detailed.   This is ALL I remember. "
873,What was the source of magic used in Grand Magic Games in Fairy Tail?,"In the grand magic games arc we saw several team events that use a lot of magic events. Which are ""Hidden"", ""Chariot"", ""Pandemonium"", ""Naval Battle"" and ""Battle Royale"" etc.   In the world of magic, we see magic circles being used to create these events. For Example, creating the water sphere in Naval Battle or Peripheral Chariots. These may be comparatively easy, however it would require lots of magic power to create thousands of exact clones (Hidden) or 100 monsters of Pandemonium.  So who/which guild/how was used to create these events since they would require an absurd amount of power.  Considering, How powerful would the user be if he can create a monster which can fight on level footing as an S-Class mage? Thousands of clone which may have same power as that of user(?) "
874,Did griffin know about the beleith's activation?,I just binge watched all 25 episodes of the berserk anime and I am curious to if Griffith knew that the Beleith was activating when the eclipse started? When they were in the river he thought to himself      Stay away from me... If you so much as touch my shoulder we can never go back.    Did that have any significance?   I haven't read the manga and from what I've researched there is no second season to it.  
875,Why weren't Gigai used for Spearhead?,"When Rukia was explaining how Mod Souls were created for Project Spearhead, she said the project was scrapped because forcing corpses to fight was immoral.  But why weren't Gigai considered? Unlike corpses, Gigai are created so they are more readily available and a Mod Soul would inhabit a corpse in the same way as a Soul Reaper inhabits a Gigai with the exception that a Gigai was never alive to begin with.  So why wasn't it considered to use Gigai instead rather than scrap Spearhead altogether? "
876,What's the name of this vehicle in Code Geass?,"  I tried the wiki, but couldn't find any information on this cool-looking walking (hydron?) canon. What is the name of this and what does it do? "
877,How does the One piece Bounty system work?,"Right from the beginning of One piece, we see luffy and his crew keep getting a bounty increase everytime something big happens and this leaves a lot of room for pondering; especially on how these bounties are thought up and agreed on.    I understand that Pirates who are deemed to be dangerous by the Marines are awarded bounties but my question is how the bounty system actually works in relation to the media. Do the Marines kinda depend on information from newspaper media outlets to increase or award a bounty? (or is the other way round; that they only use newspaper and the media for getting the bounties out). Is the Bounty based more on popularity within the media?   Also, what warrants a decrease/withdrawal in Bounty? I know it has never technically happened but is it ideally possble?  My last question is how a pirate with a bounty can actually turn in another pirate for their bounty, are there any set restrictions on awarding Bounties? "
878,What Happens to a Sub Soul when a Soul Reaper reclaims their Gigai?,"When we see Rukia use Soul Candy to leave her Gigai, the Sub Soul, Chappy, appears to have a very distinct personality.  So when a Soul Reaper leaves their Gigai leaving it to the Sub Soul, what happens to the Sub Soul when they take it back over? do they get ejected like a Mod Soul or are they simply destroyed? "
879,What is the idea for exchanging Alice stones for engagement based on?,"In Gakuen Alice, if two people exchange Alice stones that they created, it can act as the equivalent of an engagement or promise. Is this based on any specific Japanese tradition? If not, what is it based off of? "
880,What's up with the Black Butler intermissions?,"Today I decided to carry on watching Black Butler since I had only watched the first episode a couple months ago and then stopped watching. (so fairly new to the series) but I noticed that every time there was an intermission or brief break in between the episode, it always seem to feature either Ceil or Sebastian next to what I think is a tarot card?     I don't mind spoilers just so you know and maybe I am a bit slow, but is there a relationship or connection between the cards and how they always pop up in intermission to the storyline etc?  Edit: I just realised that I had been watching Black Butler II and not Black Butler I which would probably be why I was confused. "
881,How old is Alucard?,"We know that Dracula was defeated in the past (some 100 years before the series begun). That's when his name was changed to Alucard.   However, it's obvious that he lived before that. How long did he live? Do we have an estimated timeline of events?  "
882,How did no one notice that Rukia's special order was defective?,"In Episode 6, when Rukia went to replenish her supplies from Kisuke, she asked about her special order in which Kisuke sent Ururu to look for it. After looking at it, Kisuke said that the one Rukia got was the only one he could get as it was hard to get. Later, he finds that the box was marked as defective.  What I don't get is how no one knew it was defective. If Kisuke's supplier marked it as such, firstly wouldn't they have had it destroyed because of Soul Society's orders to destroy Mod Souls? If they ignored the order, then Kisuke should have known because he would have seen the box and opened it, checking what it was because he knew it wasn't Chappy which is what Rukia said she wanted when Ichigo was complaining about it being a duck. If the box wasn't marked as defective before it arrived, then Kisuke must have done it and was fully aware it was defective in the first place.  How did no one notice that Rukia's special order was defective before she came to pick it up? "
883,How does the state know when people transmute something into gold?,"In FMA, transmuting gold is against the law. However, I don't get this - How does the state know when people transmute something (e.g. bread into gold)?.   There's nothing to stop someone from transmuting bread into a gold coin, walking into a store and then going on their merry way out as if nothing happened, because there's absolutely no way to know that it was bread to start off with. (Please correct me if I'm wrong. I haven't been watching the anime in a while and have only started re-watching again).  So, how will/how does the state know when someone has transmuted something into gold? How do they deal with this? e.g. imprisonment, fines etc. "
884,Dating simulator anime?,Can someone help me identify the name of this anime with a dating simulator involved?  The plot goes like this: A kid in highschool is into dating simulators on his PSP.

Does anyone know the name of this anime? 
885,"Why did Sakurako call Akari a ""betrayer""?","In the final chapter of Volume 9 of the Yuru Yuri manga, Sakurako was feeling sleepy in the student council room.  At that time Himawari stepped in,  apologizing for being late. But Sakurako, who was in dreaming mind, saw Himawari's face as Akari's and shouted out 「あかりちゃんの裏切り者！！」.  As I understand it, she is either calling Akari a betrayer, or saying ""Akari's betrayer"", but neither of these interpretations makes any sense to me. What is the real meaning of these words? Why did Sakurako say that? I know this manga is not meant to be difficult to understand  but I just cannot get my head around it. So please explain that to me if you know the answer.  I would really appreciate your help!!  p.s. This is the only one place in this chapter where Akari is  mentioned. So I guess the answer may lie in previous chapters? But I do not have access to all volumes from 1 up until 9. "
886,Is this TK's real name?,"   TK is a character in the well-known anime Angel Beats!   Note:     In the anime, TK's real name is never revealed.   In he opening to the show, all of the characters are shown with their Japanese names in a speech bubble, and the English translation in the background.   TK's Japanese name is simply ""TK"", but in the background of the speech bubble, there is something written in English. (See the picture below)    (TK is on the far left.)  It looks to me that those letters say something like, ""TH[???]""  Does anybody know what these letters are? And, do these letters signify TK's real name? "

889,How is the title of Yonko earned?,"The Emperors of the sea Aka ""Yonkos"" are the 4 great pirates who are renowned and feared by both the masses and the world government. Rumors depict them to be so powerful and important that a loss/death of any, could have a ripple effect strong enough to destroy the authoritative order of some regions. Sadly enough, the Bounties of these Yonko are also unknown.   What I'm trying to understand is how a pirate actually attains such a level; is it in any way related to the actual bounty of that individual or their second in command?  we all know that Kaido and big mom had subbordinates who attained bounties roughly around 1 billion; is that the prerequisite for becoming a Yonko? But then if that were the case, it doesn't explain how Marshal D teech was able to slyly slip into the ranks of Yonko.  Or is it more about who is closest to becoming the pirate King? Or more like whoever can defeat a Yonko automatically snatches the title?  I ask this mainly because of a lot of theories floating around about luffy becoming the 5th Yonko;      After luffy crashes Big Moms wedding and made it out alive, ""Big news Morgan""   announces him as the 5th Emperor of the sea and that really confuses me; Is all it takes to become an Emperor an announcement from a media outlet?   To sum it up, My question is on how a pirate becomes known as a Yonko, is there a deeper meaning to the title itself?      Extra Question lol: what did Blackbeard do differently from Trafalga law to become a Yonko?, after all they were both warlords for a short while.  "
890,"Why does Sakura's inner voice say ""cha"" at the end of her sentences?","So this answer explains why Naruto say ""dattebayo"" or ""believe it"" in the English translations, being that he inherited it from his mother.  In earlier episodes of Naruto when Sakura goes to think of what she really wants to say, this occurs in the form of white drawing lines of Sakura with writing on her forehead with black background. See the image below:    In the English dub, the second Sakura often ends her sentences by saying ""cha"".  What is the reason for this? Is this something she picked up from her parents like how Naruto inherited his mother's habit, or is there some other explanation for this? "
891,What's the proper reading order for the manga in the Steins;Gate series?,"I ended up reading Steins;Gate, but after I had finished it, I wasn't sure which one I should read next. When searching for Steins;Gate cartoons, I found all these different parts and I started reading Bokan no Rellion and it looks like it's the same story, but from a different character's perspective. So what about the other parts? Are they the same story too or are they sequels and is there a specific order I should use to get the most out of the story?   Steins;Gate Steins;Gate: Bōkan no Rebellion Steins;Gate: Onshu no Braunian Motion Steins;Gate: Shijō Saikyō no Slight Fever Steins;Gate: Hiyoku Renri no Sweets Honey Steins;Gate: Aishin Meizu no Babel Steins;Gate!

892,"Who were the previous ""Emperors of the Sea""","Just like the way there have been multiple Kage's over the centuries (in the Naruto-verse), have there also been yonko's for previous generations? What i'm trying to grasp is if the Yonko title started with the ""Big 4"" (Whitebeard, Kaido, Big Mom, shanks). If that were the case then Shanks would have been the youngest,and most likely the newest addition at that time.  Or Did Shanks replace a previous Yonko just like how      Blackbeard replaced Whitebeard?  "

The music plays during the conversation between Tyson and Kenny after a friendly battle between Tyson and Max.

894,Do people notice Kaneki's hair changing?,"Kaneki's hair turns white      after being tortured by Jason.   In the manga, it is a little bit better explained, but the point is: in chapter 62 of the manga, Jason just walks into the room with his hair white, and Jason doesn't even notice it?

896,Why do the Homunculi look the way they do?,"What is the reason for which the (Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood's) homunculi look the way they do? I know they mean to represent the sins from which they were created, but is there a common image in Japanese folklore for them?  Lust is represented as a beautiful, desirable (take Havoc's opionions on this) woman. (And that's the only directly-represented sin I can find amongst the homunculi.)  Gluttony is represented as a fat, all-eating beast. (?)  Greed... ? I mean, the first Greed was an apparently normal human with abilities to cover his skin with diamond-hard layers. (Apart from the ""diamond"", I can't see how he is ""greedy"" at all. Not as his appearance, at least.)  Sloth is       a giant, enormously huge and fast(??) creature.   Wrath is justifiable enough.      He had a normal human body taken for experiments and had a philosopher's stone inserted. All the souls within him then fought for control, leaving only the one who actually controlled him.   Pride       is a child????   Envy      is a huge monster who has the ability to freely change his form around.   Is there a pattern I'm losing here?  "
897,Where is Tobi's teleportation space location?,"While battling with Tobi, I have seen ninjas getting teleported to a place, which is kind of a dark room, having floor made up of blocks.  Is it a real place like a cave somewhere far? Or is it Tobi's subconscious mind?  Justification is required when considering a fighting scene between Tobi and Kakashi-Naruto.  When Kakashi is teleported into that place, Kakashi counter attacks with Kamui making Tobi bleed (cough blood). And Kakashi manages to return back to battle field. "
898,What was inside Yuuko's wallet?,Mio was carrying Yuuko's wallet in her bag for some reason (why?). Then the moment comes and Mio realizes that the wallet is not there. They go to the lost and found department. They found the wallet and we see inside of it as in the screen shot below. Yuuko's day is ruined after see that paper and the green thing inside.  What was that paper and the green substance that put Yuuko in such a bad mood?    Inside the wallet:    Yuuko's mood for the entire day after this event:    (Location: Episode 12; at the beginning of the second half.) 
899,Do we see Mikiya Kokutou after the time leap at the end of Kara no Kyoukai: Mirai Fukuin?,"During the scene in which Mitsuru was going to be hired by the gang of Mikiya and Shiki, we see a man with black glasses sitting in front of Mitsuru (see picture below). Is it Mikiya or just a member of the gang?  I mean, on the one hand, when Mitsuru was referring to Mikiya (the current gang leader), we were able to see this man. Hence we could conclude that it's Mikiya. But on the other hand, it wouldn't be surprising if the producers simply showed a gang member who's in charge of recruiting.  I'm still a bit doubtful that this man might be Mikiya since his personality seems a bit contradictory to his younger self. Though, it also needs to be considered that there was a time leap of over 10 years.  So, is this man Mikiya or just a gang member?   "
900,What happens when two selectors have the same deck colour?,"When Selectors battle, there is a large wheel or clock that decides which Selector goes first.   The Selectors are represented by their deck colour (eg. Yuzuki - Red Deck, Ruko - White Deck) The image below is from when Ruko battled Yuzuki, And it's clear that Ruko gets to go first.  But how could we tell who goes first if both Yuzuki and Ruko had the same coloured deck? Would the wheel be entirely one colour?  As of season 1 of the anime there have been no same-deck battles but maybe there is some external source of information about this?   "
901,Can the Tailed Beasts' relative power levels be compared?,A Tailed Beast's power seems to be greater the more tails it has. For example:   Power of 3-Tailed Beast = Power of 2-Tails + 1-Tails. Power of 9-Tailed Beast = Power of 8-Tails + 7-Tails + ... + 1-Tails.   This is clear. But is it possible to compare the power level of the 1-Tails and 2-Tails with this equation? Does the power of the 2-Tailed Beast = the power of the 1-Tailed one? Or is it greater?  Reference links:   Most of them have shared the same idea in this link. Badranious's answer in this thread.  
902,Why is 1:144 scale used for plastic models?,Why a modeler originally choose 1:144 scale to create a plastic model such as GunPla? Why not choose 1:100 or some other number that can easily determine the size of the model from the original size?

In the Chapter 752, Doflamingo appears as a ""Fake"" Doflamingo            Would Doflamingo lose his power? Would the fake Doflamingo lose his power or is he immune against water?  "
905,"How much are ""cens"" worth?","How much are ""cens"" in FMA worth? Is there some sort of canon answer to this, or can something at least be inferred from the manga / either anime series? "
906,What next For the db episodes?,"As we r seeing dragonball super on air .Though its being viewed now , it seems gt series was the end to whole dragonball saga; is it true? .I gained this conclusion by watching the super saiyan 4 and also the leaving of goku in final episode of gt .Please can someone clarify if there is any other part after gt? (In continued format for gt story) "
907,What happened in the battle between Shanks and The King of Beasts,"   I dont know the exact timeline but a while before the Marinefold incident and the execution of Ace, it was stated that Shanks went ahead to battle Kaido ""THE KING OF BEASTS""     Was the battle an ""all-out war"" between Kaido and shanks fleet? Or more of a 1v1 between the 2 Emperors.  Also, since Shanks made it to Marinefold immediately after battling the King of Beasts, does that imply that Kido lost the fight? I'm really intrigued because the fact that Shanks showed up while Kaido didn't means that Shanks was able to prevent Kaido from running amok in Marinefold. Could this testament prove that Shanks is way stronger than Kaido? "
908,What is the primary principle of controlling Jinchuuriki?,"What is the primary principle of controlling Jinchuuriki? I can think of two possibilities:   Control on hatred/negative thoughts; Will and wish of tailed beast.   Killer Bee could easily get in a good relationship with Hachibi. We can recall the Falls of Truth incident of Bee, where he could easily pass it in a second, because he didn't have any hatred about anyone around him in his heart. So is it because he had suppressed negative thoughts, hence he got his tailed beast under control? Or is it because Hachibi himself is a really good guy, who is broadminded enough to lend his chakra to Bee? "
909,How could Beyond Birthday read lifespans?,"Some of you may know Beyond Birthday. He was born with Shinigami eyes so he didn't need to make the Shinigami eye deal. So, Beyond Birthday's victims were supposed to die soon, because their lifespans were over. But how the hell could he read the lifespans of humans? I always thought only Shinigami could understand the meanings of the lifespan numbers. Can somebody explain this to me? "
910,Why does Gaara still have dark circles around his eyes?,"It is stated that Gaara has his dark circles around his eyes because Shukaku won't let him sleep because Gaara will lose control if he does.   After the extraction of Shukaku, Gaara still has these circles around his eyes. Why? Is it only style or does he still suffer from insomnia? "
911,Kakuzu's way of getting all the five chakra elements,"So I went back and started reading, or just looking at, really old questions about Naruto, including Shippuden. I read this question, but this answer got my attention. After looking at the answer, I started to wonder how exactly Kakuzu's methods of getting the chakra natures work.  We know that he gets all the chakra natures by stealing people's hearts throughout the years but once the hearts he has on are damaged or just get too old he has to get new ones. But how does that work? I always thought the nature of the chakra was in the body not exactly the heart. Or do both, body and heart, have the chakra nature, so when Kakuzu gets the hearts he gets part of the chakra nature?  Also, since we also know that Kakuzu has been living for a while, until Kakashi killed him, exactly how old is he? I know he has been living since the First Hokage was alive, which I guess was about 100 years ago, so I think he was at least a little more than 100 years old. "
912,Where was Fate staying during the first season?,"The DVDs I own of Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha seemed to use very bad fan subs as when Alph first appeared, Arisa kept referring to her as a 'he' (despite clearly seeing her boobs), then Fate was named Feid, and Alph was Elofy.  In episode 7, Is This a Third Magician? (titled in the subs as The Third Magical Girl), there is a subtitle indicating where Fate was living. However, I don't trust it as shortly after when Nanoha gets off the bus to walk home and meets Yuuno with the repaired Raising Heart, there is a subtitle of where she is and not only is it totally different to what was shown with Fate's location, but it doesn't even says Uminari City which is where the the Takamachi's, Bannings' and Tsukimura's live and where Midori-ya and Seishou Elementary School located (as such it's very unlikely Nanoha was dropped off in another city after school to go home or to visit Arisa or Suzuka).  So I am wondering where was that apartment tower Fate was living in? "
913,What is the name of the OST playing at 18:40 in Shingeki no Kyojin Episode 1?,"In the original anime Shingeki no Kyojin (Attack on Titan), there was an OST playing at 18 minutes and 40 seconds into the first episode.  This OST happenned when Eren Jaeger saw the Collosol Titan for the first time before the latter smashed a hole into the outer wall.  What was the name of that OST/song in the background?  (If the song name is a part of a bigger OST name (aka Difficult OST from One Piece being made of two parts, Shichibukai and Mr. Prince), could you name only the specific half of the OST?  Thanks. "
914,When does the Cowboy Bebop Manga take place within the Anime?,"I know that the Cowboy Bebop manga was written and produced by someone other than Shinichiro Watanabe (although the English credits say: Cooperation: Shinichiro Watanabe / Sunrise); the manga Cowboy Bebop, shortly after the TV series ended, and that for all intents and purposes, they are the same canon as the TV series and movie; and the manga Cowboy Bebop: Shooting Star, which was written alongside the original TV series airing. The chapters themselves are pretty similar to an episode of the TV series, so are there specific time frames, or episodes that these chapters are reported to take place? Or is it ambiguous and can safely sit somewhere in the middle of the series (after all the cast have been introduced and are together, before the cast start separating)? Is ""Shooting Star"" on a completely different timeline? "
915,"Is ""Payday"" Money, real money?","In the Pokémon games, when Payday is used, you can gain a small amount of money. The amount is however pitiful, so it's never used as an infinite money trick or effective money grinding strategy.  In the anime however, during the Johto League Arc, in one episode Jessie, James, and Meowth are copycatting a famous burglar who had a Meowth as a partner. In his escapes the burglar's Meowth used Payday like a smoke screen. When Jessie and James copycat, they do the same thing, however because Meowth can't use Payday, Meowth throws bottle caps belonging to James' collection. (When Ash, Brock, and Misty examine the ""coins"" they comment they are just bottle caps, after which you hear James in the background saying they aren't ""just bottle caps"".)  I am wondering however, is the money that's thrown out when Payday is used the same kind of money used in society in Pokemon? If so, then how is it people don't abuse the move to get rich? (For example, Team Rocket stealing Pokémon with Payday and using them to fund their criminal operations.) "
916,Is Ash's explanation for the origins of his name correct?,"In vol. 11, Eiji asks Ash about his real name while they are on the Staten Island ferry. Ash claims that his first name, Aslan, is a Hebrew word referring to daybreak.     Eiji: Remember what you told me once? That your mother gave you your name &mdash; your real name, ""Aslan"". It's not a common name &hellip; What does it mean?      Ash: It's an ancient Hebrew word that was used in prayer. It means ""daybreak,"" cuz I was born at dawn.   But as far as I can tell, the Hebrew word for dawn is שחר (shachar). I tried guessing various Hebrew spellings that could be read as Aslan and looking those up on the internet, but I haven't yet found anything convincing. Aslan also happens to be a variant of a real Turkic name that means ""lion,"" so Ash's etymology could also be the result of author error. I am not proficient in Hebrew or Aramaic, however, so I'm not sure if I'm missing something.  Is there any truth to Ash's claim at all? "
917,What is the unit of power level in the Dragon Ball series and how is it measured?,"Throughout almost the entire series, all characters in the Dragon Ball series keep on talking about sensing each other's powers from great distances and all. They even compare each other's power levels just by observing each other.  So my questions are:   What is the unit of power level? For example, weight is measured in the unit kilogram. How is each unit of such a power measured? Since the story revolves around Earthlings, is it possible (in the wildest of dreams) for humans to devise a way to measure power levels?  "
918,"In session 23 at 14:45, is Ein hacking or is Ed?","In session 23 at 14:45, is Ein hacking or is Ed?   Ein has the head band interface on that Jet was using to interface with the cult's net presence and Ed doesn't have her hands on the computer. It looks like Ein is hacking the cult's access point; is this the case? "
919,Why was Rukia's head covered when she was escorted to/from the Repentance Cell?,When Rukia was transported to the Repentance Cell after the use of the Sokyoku for her execution was authorized her head was covered with a white cloth. and i recall alter on when she is escoted to the execution ground her head is covered aswell  What i don't get is why? I get the feeling it may be something to do with a Japanese Tradition because when Ichigo's team got back and Orihime was telling Tatsuki about what she did during the break i seem to recall Tatsuki assuming that Orihime just went to a town that was themed like feudal japan.  Also it's not like Rukia wouldn't know the location of the cell since how many tall white towers are there in the Seireitei which overlook Sokyoku hill.  so why was Rukia's head covered when she was escorted to/from the Repentance Cell? 
920,Are other pirates than the strawhats able to find raftel?,"For now we know you need the four road porneglpyh to get the location of raftel.   Big Mom has one of them. Another one is held by Kaido. The third one is on the moving island Zou. The location of the last is unknown.   So we could say Big Mom and Kaido have 1/4 information about the location of raftel. And we assume the don't share this information among each other. So they are pretty far from finding this island.  Ruffys crew is the only known to know 2 road porneglpyh (made a copy of Big Mom's and the one on Zou), so he has 2/4 of the information.  So Ruffys crew is at moment in the best position to find raftel. But: even if an other crew had all the road porneglpyh, they can't read them. How are they supposed to get the information that is written on these stones? Is Nico Robin the only way to get the location of raftel? "
921,How does a shadow clone identify itself as shadow clone?,"All shadow clones have the same memories as the original (from birth until the Jutsu cast time). Which means all the shadow clones also should think of themselves as the original.   If an action needs to be done by only the original, all the shadow clones also would try to do the same. Because they all think that they are the original.  Is it valid? Do shadow clones know that they are just clones? "
922,What makes the mannequins different from the results of the sacrifices' human transmutation attempts?,"In the manga / Brotherhood, we learn that the reason human transmutation is forbidden is because it would otherwise allow people to create their own private armies (at least according to the man who talks to General Armstrong after she's transferred to Central). Right after that, we're shown the mannequin ""soldiers"", implying that they're the results of some form of human transmutation.  But it's pretty obvious that the mannequins are different from the products produced by Ed, Al, Izumi Curtis, and Roy when they attempt (or are forced to attempt) human transmutation - in the case of the mannequins, the transmutation has actually produced what the alchemist probably wanted and is ""successful"".  Given this, what's the difference between the human transmutation referred to in the context of the mannequins and human transmutation as attempted by the sacrifices? Is the difference in result simply an issue of having a different intended result and/or maybe philosopher's stones, or is there potentially a different explanation for this? "
923,What is the proper order for watching the El Hazard series?,"The El Hazard series, written by Ryoe Tsukimura and directed by Hiroki Hayashi, consists of two OVA series and two TV anime:  OVA   El Hazard: The Magnificent World El Hazard 2: The Magnificent World   TV Series   El Hazard: The Wanderers El-Hazard: The Alternative World   How are these different productions related? What is the best order for someone to enjoy them? "
924,What is the difference between Negima!? and Negima!,"So I have 2 Negima DVD Collections, one is spelled as Negima! and the other is Negima!? with the latter also having a second DVD called Negima!? Spring and Summer Specials  Both have relatively the same plot summary on the back of the covers, both have the same number of episodes and Anime News Network just says that Negima!? is an alternate retelling. But what exactly is the difference between Negima! and Negima!?  "
925,Who is the true leader of the One Shadow Nine Fists?,"All this time, I thought the manga was leading on that Saiga Furinji was the leader, but then  around chapter 570, it turns out some guy named Senzui was disguised as Saiga Furinji. Furthermore, it seems that they both shared the same disciple Satomi.  Was Senzui the One Shadow this entire time? How can they both even train Satomi if Senzui is always disguised and so is Saiga? What on earth is going on?  Lastly, who actually controls (or controlled) the One Shadow Nine Fists ? "
926,Is there an explanation behind the hidden blue Exceed/cat?,"In Fairy Tail Episode 144 (Despair Unleashed), approximately 7 minutes and 42 seconds into it, a blue Exceed/cat can be seen hidden between the rocks in the background.  In the image I took below you can see between Happy and Panther Lily the blue Exceed/cat.    This is not addressed this during the episode and the characters in the scene do not mention anything about it.   Is there ever an actual explanation behind this? Or is it some type of Easter egg? "
927,what is this green thing?,"Maybe it's my fault for not watching from the first season, but I'm wondering, what exactly is this? it already appear in the very first episode in Hidamari Sketch × ☆☆☆ (Hidamari Sketch x Hoshi Mittsu), was he ever introduced in the anime?   "
928,How did Natsu manage to kill Silver Fullbuster (Gray Fullbuster's Father)?,"In Tartoros Arc of Fairy Tail, Gray was given Ice Devil Slayer magic. His father then said, ""Do you know why I learned ice devil slayer magic? It's because END is a fire demon."" Gray said ""I swear one day I will kill END"". Why and how did Natsu kill Gray's father when he was still living? "
929,What exactly is Mami's power?,"Mami was always fighting with both gun and ribbon. In the Rebellion movie, when Homura was fighting Mami, she can't break Mami's ribbon, but in the end, she was able to do that. How can this happen? And if Mami's ribbon already attached in Homura's feet (just like picture on the left), why didn't Mami just pulled her ribbon so Homura won't move?     "
930,Why do some summons have forehead protector while most of others don't?,"These are all summons with forehead protector that I can find, it's quite rare among the summons. For example, Sannin's summons, Inuzuka Clan's Ninkens and the Ninnekos don't have forehead protectors.  Are the headbands are overall just for decoration purpose for the summons?   Weren't forehead protectors are worn by most Shinobi since the summons are technically mini ninjas?  Kakashi's and Guy's summons:   Konohamaru's summons:   Hiruzen's (Third hokage) summons:  "
931,Do all the children in Wammy's House receive codenames?,"Everyone who watched Death Note knows that L was raised in a orphanage called Wammy's House. So, L's Name was L Lawliet. Near's is Nate River, and Mello's was Mihael Keehl.  Does every child of Wammy's House have a codename? If every child has a codename, is the first letter from the codename the first from the real name?  "
932,Why is there no official character song for Homura and Mami?,"Madoka has a character song titled ""See You Tomorrow"" (またあした, Mata Ashita) while Sayaka and Kyoko have a duet song titled ""And I'm Home"".  I just found out that Homura and Mami don't have a character song (from this Puella Magi wiki page) like Madoka, Sayaka, and Kyoko do. Are there any character songs for Homura and Mami? If there aren't, why didn't they make one for them?  Added to clarify, by character song I mean     A song whose vocals are credited to the character or characters singing the song.    as per this question What is a “character song”? "
933,Pure Blood devil and their Chess pieces,"After war, the number of pure blood devil number decreased and almost went extinct except for 3 clan who did survive. So they are taking humans to increase their numbers in the form of chess pieces. I have only watched the anime and information about Raiser Phoenix's chess pieces was very little. However, it was mentioned that his own sister Ravel Phoenix was a bishop who was revived as demon. What does it mean - isn't she a demon already?  Does that mean Rias Gremory is also servant of higher rank devil, or every pure blood devil are king and they choose their chess pieces/servant except Ravel Phoenix's case where she died and revived as demon as other piece of chess?  And to be chosen as a chess piece, must the person die or not, since the word revived is used. What are the conditions for someone to be chosen the servant? Can it be anyone? "
934,What was the event that resulted in 2 episodes of Fumoffu being changed?,"In the English dubbed Madman DVD release of Full Metal Panic? Fumoffu!, as part of of the extra segment The Mysteries of Fumoffu on the first disk (episodes 1-3), it notes there is something different about the first and second episodes compared to when they aired.  The notes say A Hostage With No Compromises was not aired because of a certain event and so A Fruitless Lunchtime was aired with The Man From the South as the first episode instead. What was this event, and how does it relate to A Hostage With No Compromises? "
935,How is Solomon's Wisdom acquired?,"In Magi, Aladdin is the only one who seems to be able to use 'Solomon's Wisdom', a power he obtained from Ugo in a dream.  My question is, how is Solomon's Wisdom acquired? Does it have anything to do with Ugo and why can't other Magi's such as Scheherazade tap into this power?  It only makes sense that they should be able to use it since they are Magi's and are favoured by the Rukh. I am sure it was not addressed in the anime since I only follow the anime (not the manga) but if it was revealed in the mangas then that is perfectly fine too. "
936,Use of nosebleeds to denote arousal?,"In several episodes of Assassination Classroom (animated version), characters develop spontaneous nosebleeds seemingly in response to becoming sexually aroused.  This occurs with a number of male characters, though I can recall at least one instance where it happens to a female character as well.    Here's an example on Youtube:  [website]Is this a common trope in anime, or something that's unique to Assassination Classroom?  And in either case, is there any rational explanation behind using this seemingly bizarre method of depicting arousal? "
937,Why the Survey Corps doesn't find a human body inside each titan?,"In Attack on Titan (anime), up till now we are given information that the ""dumb"" titans that wonder outside the walls are probably humans. Given that both ""smart"" (Eren/Annie/Yumir/etc) and ""dumb"" titans share the same weakness this has always been a possibility.  However, its not clear why the Survey Corps never finds the bodies of the humans inside the ""dumb"" titans? They should at least find the bones of the human. Is this a logical flaw of the series?  BTW: please, no spoilers from the manga, only info available in the anime up to season 2 episode 12. "
938,Why did Goku recruit Frieza but not gotenks,Goku didn't recruit goten and trunks because they charge at their enemies like an idiot. But isn't Frieza like that as well? Why did Goku recruit Master Roshi who can't even beat Raditz? He can't even scratch the fighters from other universes. Roshi &amp; Tien can be removed and leave space for Gotenks.  
939,Why is Ed able to exchange his knowledge?,"In FMA 2009/Manga, Edward is able to exchange his Gate of Truth for Alphonse's body.  However, I find this pretty dumb. The Gate symbolizes the knowledge of alchemy.  Father's Gate is small and has no ornaments like Ed's which indicates that Father doesn't know anything as stated in the series. But alchemy is a science in this universe. They learn it from reading books. Why is Edward unable to use alchemy but able to read it? I can imagine that Ed is not able to use alchemy by clapping his hands anymore but by drawing circles and alchemy formulas.  Another question: Edward's toll (his leg) to see Truth is less than Alphonse's (who lost his whole body) and it is also stated that Al probably saw more of Truth than Edward.  So Alphonse's Gate is worth more than Edward's Gate. Couldn't Alphonse easily exchange his own Gate?  He probably would still use alchemy since his knowledge is worth more than Edward's.  Edit: Just thinking about it, you don't have to sacrifice anything at all when using human transmutation. All you need to do is sacrifice your Gate and you won't lose that much of your body. "
940,Girl who wants to be the king's cook?,"I am looking for an anime that I had watched fairly around a week ago on a school computer. Here's the details I remember.  It started off with an opening song. There was a little girl who had wanted to be a cook for the king. Her mother used to always love it when people enjoyed her food. Sadly, she passed away and the girl was left alone, I believe. She had this very fat relative or cousin too. He was very enthusiastic and looked after her? (Not really sure). I only got to watch two episodes of this series and I don't think it was the average 20-23 minutes but perhaps maybe 15?  The first episode I remember is that this girl who wants to become the king's cook accidentally let a puppy loose into the palace, which wrecked the noodles for the royal dinner. There was this other girl, who sounded spoilt rotten and was very unpleasant. I believe at some point she tried to get this girl into trouble. The next thing I remember is that the little girl said she could provide some noodles for wrecking the noodles in the first place since she grew some type of noodles. It could have been tadpole noodles? (I'm not quite sure on this either).  In the second episode there was the king. He was riding on horseback with a whole lot of troops and looked like he was dressed in traditional looking armour like a samurai. I believe they were looking to hunt down a giant boar. Next thing I remember is that there are these people dressed like ninjas who try to kill the king. Suddenly there is this big fight in a forest on horseback and some other elements such as the king chasing after the assassins after they fail killing him.  The final detail I remember is that girl that wants to be the king's cook and who ruined the noodles finds one soldier on the ground with her fat cousin and dog. Suddenly three assassins walk up to her and tell her to move out of the way. They were intent on killing the soldier. She refused and one of the assassins who was a girl was told by one of the assassin leaders to ""take care of her"". She closes her eyes as she is grabbed but then her cousin says something like ""leave her alone"" and throws a barrel of wine? which the boar that the king was hunting/looking for in the forest smells and quickly charges to where the smell was coming from and I think the girl, cousin, and puppy run away with the soldier.  There was also some sort of cooking competition on where you cook something really nice so you can become the king's cook. She ended up cooking rice since that was the only ingredient left when she finally came. She was late because she had to save that soldier so her cousin went and told her to get in the back of this pulley and pulled her all the way to the palace, and she almost got refused entry for being late.  I also remember a scene where that spoilt girl steals some other girl's frog/pet and pretends that the girl stole her ingredient for frog soup to try and eliminate her from being the thief.  Just on a side note: I think the girl who wants to be the king's cook is Ming or Mei? The graphics and art style weren't too dodgy but it did look a little old, although I wouldn't know the exact year it was released.  Update: The girl is not tsundere. It is more like an historic anime and there is nothing magical or otherworldly in it. It has a kind of ninja theme to it. The people in the anime do not typically look like the usual anime characters with unusual height or eyes or crazy styled hair and look pretty normal or well anime normal anyways. It looks like it was set in a Japanese (possibly ancient) setting similar to the medieval era. There was a castle but it didn't have a moat. The girl has black hair and everyone wears pretty Japanese looking clothing such as possibly in that of the feudal time period. Woman in the palace wore what looked like gowns and had their hairs in a bun.  While I am it, I just remembered that the female assassin/ninja had some type of symbol on her arm. I think her sleeves got ripped by the boar? and then she quickly covers it up. Also the girl who wants to be the kings cook and saves that soldier had two rings that she got from her mother. One was green and the other was some colour I forgot (maybe red). I have no idea but she ends up dropping it.  Does anyone know what anime this is? "
941,What's the difference between Persona4 and Persona4 the Golden?,"Is Persona4 the Golden ANIMATION simply a remake of Persona4 the ANIMATION? Or are the stories actually different?  It looks like the Golden is an improved remake of the Persona4 game for the Playstation Vita, but after seeing the first episode of the Golden ANIMATION, it doesn't seem to be much different at all from the original anime. "
942,How strong is Freezer now?,"Just watched Dragon Ball Super episode 95th (best episode ever some people says, last episode made record in ratings surpassing One piece ). In it, (spoilers)   EDIT: If someone can, please edit the spoilers area which isnt working     ! Freezer was able to handle with little damage a hakai energy ball mean to wipe out anyone not only from life but from existence and to control it.       ! Later he threw it to Goku who wasnt able to control it and who got damage from it.      ! Sidra says that if Freezer betrays him, he would take care of him, but a kaioshin commented it wouldnt be so easy for him to do it.      ! Goku and Freezer sparring knocked themselves simultaneously , Goku was using super saiyan blue though he wasnt using super saiyan blue kaioken.      ! Beerus comments Freezer is even with Goku   How strong is Freezer now? Is he stronger , equal or weaker than Goku? Is he in the level of Sidra?       (since he was able to control Sidra's hakai energy?) . Beerus was able to remove Hakai's energy from Goku easier, so I take Beerus is still stronger than Freezer  "
943,"What does the phrase ""Rokkon Shojo"" mean?","In one of the most popular anime of this season, Koutetsujou no Kabaneri,  before, in the middle or after a battle, the human combatants yell ""Rokkon Shojo"" or  the Princess says it after a battle. I researched a bit and apparently it means “purification of the six roots of perception” (which is quite ambiguous) .  My questions are:    It has any other meaning other than the one stated above?  What is its purpose and why is it used in a  situation which involves fighting?  "
944,Why did Aizen want to defeat the Soul King?,"We know Aizen is trying to make keys and combining Hogyoku, assembling Hollow armies, etc. The question is why? What's the motive behind it? Is it cliche like ""GREEED FOR POWAAA!!"" or are there other plans of what he is about to do as a Soul King? Perhaps rule change? What is he really fighting for? "
945,What does it mean by 大地を見る in Kotomi's essay?,"At the start of Seitokai Yakuindomo OVA episode 19, there is this scene where it shows Kotomi's essay:    In text:     「家族」…。その中でも兄妹とは…禁断の一線を超えさせない理性の言葉。私の家は両親は仕事の事情などで留守に成りがちでよく兄とは二人きりになる。特に休日や平日の夜。まるでどこかのパソコンゲームのようだ。しかも未成年が遊んではいけないような。未成年の男女が二人きり、夜中で未成年が遊んでいけない状況にある。そこで食い止める劣情の防波堤が家族であり、そして兄妹と言うキーワードだと思う。しかしこのキーワード、危険が伴う。肉欲に任せて落ちれば燃え尽きてしまう近親相姦。我も危険なら彼も危険。共に大地を見ることができるのか？   I was able to understand almost everything with jisho.org, except the bold bit. That whole sentences, as far as I know, means something like ""Can we see the earth together?"" Why ""see the earth"" all of a sudden? It was talking about the fact that if we don't control our lust, it will become incest, so why ""see the earth""?  I tried googling ""大地を見る"" but nothing related seems to come up. Is there something I don't get?  EDIT: Translation     ""Family""... ""Brothers and sisters"", is a rational word that will not cross the forbidden line. Because of my parents' jobs, my brother and I, just the two of us, always stay at home, especially in holidays and weekdays. It's like in an adult game. Two minors, in the middle of the night, doing adult things. Situations like this often appear. In such situations, the breakwater that holds back the lust is ""family"" and also the keyword ""brothers and sisters"". However, this keyword goes hand in hand with danger. If we don't control our lust it can become incest. If I am in danger, he is too. Will we be able to see the earth together?  "
946,"For how long has Lelouch been the Emperor of Britannia before and after ""turning evil""?","Lelouch, once Charles had been defeated, use his Geass to take the Britannian crown and throne from others contenders. Then, he reforms their ""constitution"" and changes a lot of things in the empire. Then, after his coup d'état, he starts to conquers the world and finally reaches his goal at the beginning of the last episode. Now comes my two-in-one question :  For how much time did he ruled peacefully Britannia and for how much time did he kept the power after his victory over the world ? I'm asking for approximations (year?months?weeks?) more than actual time span.   "
947,"What sections of the final chapter are real, and the ones that are flashbacks/dream sequences?","The final chapter of Girl May Kill is very confusing.  There is a lot of dream sequences / flashbacks mingled with the real story, and I am having a hard time separating them.  The pages with a black background are not real. But what happened?      Did she really kill Gohongi? If she killed him, what did it accomplish?   And later on      If Gohongi is dead, is she only dreaming of how it would go if he was alive (when she is grown up and says ""I am glad you waited for me to grow up"") when she eventually grow up?

952,Gintama Sex-Change Seiyuu Change,"Why is it that during the Dekoboko Arc (Anime episode 275-277) the seiyuu for Sakata Gintoki, Kagura, Okita Sougo, Kondo Isao, Sarutobi Ayame, and Tsukuyo changed?  Sakata Gintoki : Sugita Tomokazu -> Tomatsu Haruka  Kagura : Kugimiya Rie -> Ishii Kouji  Kondo Isao : Susumu Chiba -> Takahashi Chiaki  Okita Sougo : Kenichi Suzumura -> Itou Shizuka  Sarutobi Ayame : Kobayashi Yuu -> Okitsu Kazuyuki  Tsukuyo : Kaida Yuuko -> Hoshino Takanori  Yet, the seiyuu for Hijikata Toshirou was not changed. Why is that? If it was to keep cost low, then why not have everyone voiced by the usual seiyuu?  I'm not aware whether such sex change has happened before in other anime. If yes, then please state what anime and what kind of approach they were using and the reason for such approach for comparison. "
953,"If the Beast titan has similar powers to the founding titan, why do they need it so desperately?","Reiner and Bertolt are desperate to capture ""the coordinate"", the founding titan. But according to [website]  ""is one of the strongest of all Titans, possessing the ability to   guide and direct mindless Titans and creating new Titans from common   Eldians. These abilities are said to be nearly akin to those of the   Founding Titan""   Then why do people from Marley need so desperately the founding titan? If it's for its abilities to command other Titans, couldnt they use the Beast titan instead for that purpose? "
954,"Was ""defenestrated"" simply a literal translation, or part of a bigger concept or joke?","WorldEnd: What Are You Doing at the End of the World? Will You Save Us? (aka Shūmatsu Nani Shitemasu ka? Isogashii Desu ka? Sukutte Moratte Ii Desu ka? (終末なにしてますか? 忙しいですか? 救ってもらっていいですか?), commonly called SukaSuka) is a currently airing anime of Spring 2017. It should be obvious from the title that the author is very particular and non-traditional with their word usage. As strange as it sounds, the title of the series fits excellently. The English sub translation has flowed very well.  However something in episode 8 struck me as odd at time mark 14:00 (if watch, start 30 seconds earlier for context).  Willem, the main character is speaking with Chtholly, who is in love with him. He is defending himself from light jealousy. When she counters an argument of his with an alternative case, he says with wit and resignation:     Defenestrated in two seconds flat.   I did not know what ""defenstrated"" meant (basically, in this context, he acknowledges she has completely dismissed his argument and admits defeat.) It is not often I need to look up a word while watching anime, and on top of that figure out how that word fits the situation.  What I wonder now is if the translator used ""defenestrated"" as simply a literal translation of a Japanese word, without any real thought.  My suspicion is the opposite, that this is a contextual translation which would probably seem just as odd (and as oddly appropriate) in Japanese as it does in English. What kind of translation was it, and does it carry the Japanese intent well?  Update  HotelCalifornia (HC) further researched this question, and it turns out my original interpretation of ""Defenestrated in two seconds flat."" was incorrect. I had assumed the meaning to be [My argument was dismissed in two seconds flat.] As HC learned in the Japanese SE, a much better meaning uses a different subject and adds an object (both absent in the literal Japanese as well). So a translation that better fits conversation flow is:     I would have thrown Nygglatho out the window in two seconds.   (Nygglatho is the attractive female adult leader of the ""warehouse"", and Chtholly had just asked what Willem would have done if she had crept onto the couch where he was sleeping, instead of the teenage female who had actually done so.) So the primary meaning for defenestrated was the proper one, not the figurative meaning of dismiss. "
955,Does Midorima's shooting ability have a name?," Akashi → Emperor Eye Kise → Perfect Copy Aomine → Formless Shot (among others) Murasakibara → Thor's Hammer Midorima → ???   Does Midorima's ability to shoot 3-pointers from anywhere on the court have a super-cool name like the special techniques of the rest of the Generation of Miracles?   There's a few frames in the last OP of season 3 that say ""Sky Direct 3P Shoot"" in green text, which I suppose sounds kind of like a description of Midorima's technique, but I don't recall having heard that in the anime. (It's also the only move name in that OP I can't match up to a player, for what it's worth.) "

I am aware that there is also an anime adaptation of the manga, which I assume does not cover the entirety of the manga. (The anime ran in 2006, and the manga last published in 2009.)  I've been recommended the anime before (albeit by a friend who had somewhat different taste in this sort of thing), so on the off-chance I end up wanting to watch the anime or read the manga after seeing the film: how much of the manga do the live-action films cover? Are there any major changes to plot or characters that I should be aware of? "

970,How did Mari manage to pilot EVA Unit 02?,"I distinctly remember, in the Anime anyway, a scene where Eva Unit 02 sorties to fight an Angel without Central Dogma's authorization (If I find the scene online, I will link it here), seen when EVA Unit 01 descends back into Central Dogma for reasons I can't remember (damage, maybe?).  Seeing that EVA Unit 02 has the soul, at least the maternal part of Asuka's mother, imbued into the EVA itself, piloting the mech would be impossible for everyone except Asuka, going on the basis of EVA Unit 01's connection with Shinji.   My question is this, if EVA Unit 02 has a soul that is only known to work with Asuka, how did Mari manage to pilot EVA Unit 02 without any known difficulties? "

974,Aizen vs Everyone,"During the battle: Aizen vs. The Gotei 13 &amp; The Visored (Episode 292, 293 and 294), Aizen was stabbed by Shinji, Suì-Fēng,  Shunsui and Hitsugaya. However, it turned out that Hinamori was stabbed due to Aizen's ability.  To my understanding, Aizen's ability could affect any of the Shinigami in Soul Society because they all had seen his power before. But Ichigo had not seen it and that was why he was considered to be such an asset. Aizen implied that he had been using his ability since he arrived. I would have thought Ichigo would have seen through the ability from the start.  If Aizen had activated his ability before he arrived, Ichigo should have seen through it. If he activated after Ichigo arrived, how did Gotei 13 not see though it earlier?  My questions: when did Aizen activate his ability and switch with Hinamori and how come it affected Ichigo? "
975,"If some of the higher-ups know about Oscar's gender, why is she still permitted to be in the Royal Guard?","In the first episode of Rose of Versailles, we see the patriach of the Jarjayes family designate his newborn daughter as his son and name her Oscar, because he is in desperate need of an heir to his office and his offspring only consist of daughters. Thus, it looks like a woman would not be normally regarded as an appropriate candidate for military duties. This makes sense combined with the gender roles alluded to in the first two episodes:   Girodelle initially refuses to duel Oscar on account of gender Later he makes mention of ""womanly whims"" when she disappears in the second episode The Jarjayes housekeeper laments that Oscar isn't treated like a daughter and hopes when she refuses to become an officer that she is doing so because she wants to be a woman.   However, both in this episode and the one that follows, it is shown that Oscar's gender is more or less an open secret: at least three people outside of the Jarjayes household know of it.   Girodelle (see above) The woman who tells Marie Antoinette about Oscar while she is going to Versailles The man whom Jarjayes talks to who proposes the duel between Girodelle and Oscar, although he tells Jarjayes that it's fine that Oscar is a woman   Given that a number of outsiders are aware of Oscar's gender, is there any in-universe reason why Oscar is still permitted to take on masculine roles, if being female was supposed to be an impediment in the first place? Or is everything fine and dandy provided that Oscar does not appear overtly feminine and so long as the average person isn't aware of it? After all, Marie Antoinette, Fersen, and Rosalie are unaware of Oscar's gender until they are told of it. "
976,"In Attack on Titan, why does Zeke tell Eren that someday he will save him?","Please note, there are massive spoilers within this question so I've hidden them. If you haven't read at least Chapter 83, and later in this question 94, this question will spoil the events that occur in 83-94.   In Volume 21, Chapter 83, Pages 14-19 of the Attack on Titan manga     Zeke meets Eren for the first time, their conversation is cut short but as he turns to leave, he addresses Eren and says the following:    I have been trying to understand what Zeke means by this statement. So far, what I've gathered is that     Zeke and Eren share the same biological father but Zeke refers to their father as strictly Eren's father. Zeke believes that ""Eren's father"" brainwashed the two of them and Zeke made it clear that he understood what Eren was currently going through.    However, given that     anyone fighting in the Eldia vs Marley conflict seems to have a very biased view of historical events,   I can't tell the extent of the truth in Zeke's statements. Later in Chapter 94, Zeke makes some statements about     the value of titans when human technology was about to, or already is, surpassing them. And he expressed his concern for the survival of Eldians should they no longer be useful to the world.    So, how is it that Zeke thinks he is going to someday save Eren if     Zeke is working for the one nation that seems most interested in getting rid of the titans should they prove to have little or no military value?   Is the statement Zeke makes to Eren in Chapter 83, page 19 referring to something less obvious than what is mentioned on pages 14-18?   "
977,How to tell apart Japanese and non-Japanese characters in-universe and out-of-universe?,"Anime characters are almost always drawn with... ""anime"" facial features. Eyes are big and round, every color is allowed for eyes and hair (not to mention hairstyle), etc.  Since there are anime series starring both Japanese and non-Japanese characters, how can one distinguish them? I'm asking both in-universe and out-of-universe.  Comments and answers to this question claim that Western characters tend to be drawn with big noses, square jaws, blond hair, wide mouth, etc. But to me it seems not always the case! For example, in Yu-Gi-Oh, Bandit Keith has some of these features, but Pegasus Crawford has not, and they are both supposed to be American. Naruto, Jonouchi etc are blond and Japanese. Most characters in Escaflowne have a long nose regardless of their origin.  For even more blatant examples, let's compare Lelouch Lamperouge and Suzaku Kururugi from Code Geass:    or Teletha ""Tessa"" Testarossa and Kaname Chidori from Full Metal Panic:    Same big round eyes. Same pointy chin. Very similar noses. And, for the two girls, crazy hair color. (Similar comparsions can be done for Light Yagami an L from Death Note, and for many others).  I'd say that, at least out-of-universe, the viewer is expected to tell them apart only from their names (or, in case of biracial characters, from the double surname, e.g. Asuka Langley-Sohryu, Kallen Stadtfeld-Kozuki) and from dialogue (e.g. a character declare his/her origin). But I wonder: am I missing something? Are there subtle physical traits that the viewer is supposed to use to get their origin before they declare it?  Theoretically, there shouln't be the need to tell them apart: a character (like a real person) is defined by his/her actions, not from his/her ethnicity. But in-universe, characters seem to always recognize at a glance if another character is Japanese or not. For example, in an episode of Full Metal Panic, Sosuke asks to free first the Japanese girl (Kaname), then the Western one (Tessa), as it is obvious to everyone who is who. In Code Geass, the distinction beween Britannians and Japanese is an important plot point, and people doesn't seem to need to know the name of a character to tell if he/she is Britannian or Japanese.  So is there some kind of artistic convention? A physical equivalent to a translation convention? E.g. when we audience know that Suzaku is Japanese and Lelouch isn't, should we assume that in-universe they HAVE different facial traits? (or, in the case of Kallen: after she says that she is half-Britannian half-Japanese, are we supposed to imagine her with some ""mix"" of features so that other characters can identify her as both Britannian and Japanese?) "
978,Has Sakura expressed signs of love towards Naruto?,"Throughout Naruto and a lot of Naruto Shippuden you can clearly see that Naruto has a lot of affection towards Sakura. Various times he tries to ask her out and the like but it never goes very well for him. We do eventually learn later in ""Naruto:the Last"" that Naruto's feelings for Sakura were another way for him to compete with Sasuke, but his feelings cannot be simply denied.    My question is: has Sakura ever shown signs of love, not friendship, towards Naruto throughout the series? When? "
979,"Who or what is ""El Ragna""?","The song that both Sala and Ange mysteriously know is called ""Towagatari"", which means something like ""Eternal Story"". The version that Ange sings is subtitled ""Hikari no Uta"" = ""Song of Light""; the version that Sala sings is subtitled ""Kaze no Uta"" = ""Song of Wind"".  The duet version that they sing in the final episode is 1.) glorious; and 2.) subtitled ""El Ragna"".   Who or what is ""El Ragna""? The Cross Ange wikia claims that it means ""The Goddess"", but I'm not sure on what basis they make that claim (""El Ragna"" doesn't mean anything in Japanese, at least). I don't recall the show telling us what ""El Ragna"" means; is there perhaps some side material that does tell us what's up? "

981,The Unknown clan,"One of the most interesting clans in my opinion is Juugos clan, the clan with the ability to enter sage mode but with a downside of uncontrolled ""Beserk sessions"". Lord Orochimaru experimented on Juugo and later on, found that the source of Juugo's clans power was from the Ryuuchi cave;   Does this mean Juugo's clan originated at the Ryuuchi cave?  Also, is Juugo the last surviving member of his clan?   "
982,Does taijutsu drain chakra?,"When the user uses taijutsu like Eight Trigrams Sixty-Four Palms for example, I understand that it uses chakra. However, what if the user is just running/punching/kicking/etc? This still counts as taijutsu, right? Does this use the user's chakra?   Punching and kicking will probably exhaust the user eventually, so is this proof that it uses chakra? In other words, when a user uses up his/her chakra, they feel exhausted. Does the reverse hold true(exhaustion means lack of chakra left)? "
983,Were the other trainers from Pallet town ever revealed?,"We know four trainers started in Pallet town. Three with one of the three original starters and Ash with his Pikachu.

Is It possible to kill a person even if you don't have a Death Note?  Or am I just confused with the words? "
986,Can a jinchuuriki control how many tails their version 2 mode has?,"When a jinchuuriki goes into version 2 mode, the number of tails that they have can be different from the number of tails their tailed beast has. For example, Naruto, the 9-tail jinchurriki, only had 6 tails in his fight against Pain. My question is does the user have to start at 1 tail and move his/her way up? Can they have more tails than their tailed beast has(6-tail jinchurriki getting 9 tails in version 2 mode)? Also, can the user control how many tails they have or are they not in control anymore in version 2? I ask this because Naruto seems out of control in this mode(hitting teammates like Sakura that one time). "
987,What is this OST for Episode 4 of Rurouni Kenshin / Samurai X?,"The OST starts playing on Episode 4 as Sanosuke (Zanza) catches the waitress from her fall and starts trash-talking the drunk democrats.  I haven't been able to find it in the OSTs myself. It seems Sano has other OSTs considered as his 'theme', so it has been difficult to track down.

Are there any other characters who exist in both the worlds? Or is there any other character shown in Pirates of Caribbean which is similar to the one shown in One Piece? "
990,How did maids get popular in anime?,"Nowadays, maids are basically a moe stereotype. Otaku characters like Sakurasou no Petto na Kanojou's Ryuunosuke Akasaka, Lucky Star's Konata Izumi, and the Genshiken gang all love maids. Even K-On's Sawako Yamanaka, who isn't an otaku, puts the Light Music Club girls in maid outfits.    For a while, every single show that came out had a maid character, and several shows focused wholly or in part on maids, who may or may not also be androids (e.g. Hanaukyou Maid Tai, Hand Maid May, He is My Master, Koharu Biyori, Mahoromatic).       It was shockingly difficult to find a SFW picture from Koharu Biyori.  Even shows that didn't have maids were affected: Digi Carat's Dejiko wore a costume which looked rather like a maid outfit, even though she was not a maid, but rather a clerk in an anime store (and actually an alien princess).    My perception was that this all started sometime around 2001, but I never saw how; it just seemed like one day I was surrounded by maids. (Not that it bothered me to be surrounded by maids.) How did this get started? Was there a single show or a few shows that started the maid craze? Or was it always there, and I just never noticed? "
991,Does the size of a person matter when Devil Fruit powers are involved?,"As seen in the anime, Lily Enstomach grew herself into the size of a giant inside Luffy thus giving Luffy immense power.  He was strong with a weakness of becoming slower.  However, when he went into 2nd gear, the sheer power of turning into 2nd gear caused everything around him to be thrown back.  So does the size determine the amount of initial power the person has?  -The reason why I said initial was because power really matters on the training rather than the power of the devil fruit  Example:  Luffy, when he got bigger, the effect of 2nd Gear was stronger. Let's say that Buggy's devil fruit (section-section) gives Buggy the ability to split and fly a range 25 meters around his feet.  If Buggy was the size of a giant or the size of Whitebeard, would the range increase?  This is not about how much the devil fruit is eaten. "
992,Episode 309: Who saved Usopp on the bridge at Enies Lobby?,"Does somebody know what happened on the bridge at Enies Lobby after Usopps speech to Luffy (This isn't hell!), when the three Marines attacked him and he didn't manage to hit them?  Suddenly he got rescued, but who did that? I guess it was Dragon but is there any proof? "
993,Why didn't Minato make himself also the Yin-Kurama jinchuuriki?,"Since Minato used the Eight Trigrams Seal and the Four Elements Seal to seal Yang Kurama into Naruto, why didn't he use the same set of seals on himself to seal the Yin half? Why Reaper Death Seal? Or into Kushina? Seems like a pointless sacrifice. And waste of Yin Kurama's potential. "
994,Why is Garp only a Vice Admiral?,"It is clear that he is very powerful due to his fights with Gol. D Roger. He is also very experienced in fighting and has the confidence to defeat Admiral Akainu (magma).  So why hasn't he been promoted to Admiral? Did he deny the promotion when the option was given to him? Or was it because he lacked a Devil Fruit?  Note:  All of the Admirals has a Devil Fruit. Golden Buddha, Magma, Ice, Light. "
995,Could Sasuke use the six paths of Pain?,"I got into a hot conversation with a friend concerning how the Rinnengan works and I'd like to the clarify the requirements for using the 6 paths of pain;       Just like how Nagato and Obito Uchiha could divide the six paths power accross a bunch of dead bodies, could Sasuke also use that technique in the same fashion, if the need arises?   Also, has it ever been mentioned if its possible to use the six paths technique on living people? (like divide the six paths across different individuals who are already alive?) "
996,Could the Cowboy Bebop movie be set a few years after the series?,"THE DESCRIPTION HAS MANY BIG SPOILERS. You have been warned.  I have read many posts and reviews where it said that the creators of Cowboy Bebop intended the movie to be between sessions 22 and 23. There are a few questions on this site which ask specifically where the movie is placed chronologically with the series and people have placed emphasis on the fact that chronological order is not very important to most of the series…      …and that the main reason the movie is said to be before 23 is because Ed and Ein are still with the Bebop in the movie, whereas in the series they leave soon after 23.         Now it is a popular interpretation of the ending that Spike died and I don't want to start that debate (yet), but assuming he lives (and is just sleeping at the end like Watanabe semi-jokingly says in an interview only last year), I believe that the movie could be set after the events of the series, perhaps soon after or a few years, Ed and Ein are back, and Ed seems to return to places a few years after she leaves (as the matron at the orphanage on earth says).   Is there any evidence to back up this view?      Also I request that anyone answering remember that my crucial assumption here is that Spike lives, so please try not to start that debate as I'm very aware many people believe he does not and often vehemently defend their view. Think of this as a hypothetical ""if he lives, could the movie be set a while after the end of the series?""  "
997,"When do ""immortal"" Devil Fruits respawn?","There is a question regarding the respawn time of regular Devil Fruits (DF), but I am interested in the possibility of creating an immortal army using the same one-time DF, namely the Ope Ope no Mi and the Yomi Yomi no Mi.  The Ope Ope no Mi can perform the ""Perennial Youth Operation"" which kills the DF user and gives eternal youth (and so potentially eternal life) to the subject. The Yomi Yomi no Mi enables the soul of the user to return to his body after his death.  Does the Ope Ope no Mi respawn after the Perennial Youth Operation (the user's death) or after the death of the operated person? Does the Yomi Yomi no Mi respawn after the ""First"" death or after the soul leaves this world forever?  At least for the Ope Ope no Mi there is no body left to contain the fruit's powers and after Doflamingo wanted to become immortal by Rosinante eating the fruit and performing the operation, the powers can not be stored in the operated person's body.  Could one create an army of immortals using one of this DFs? "
998,How can a player in ALO make an original Sword Skill?,"I know the fact that Kirito's Dual Wield in SAO was an award or was awarded by the system for being the top player with the fastest reaction time. see here  And that Yuuki can pass down her insane sword combo - 11 hit (Mother's Rosario) to other players like Asuna. (Because kirito is having a hard time reproducing Starburst Stream in ALO which is 16 hit combo, as stated here)  But how did Konno Yuuki create this skill? Or is it just a skill which came from her converted account because she was in some other VRMMO?  Is there a chapter in the light novel / manga where this is discussed? "
999,Why are all the agency cyborgs female?,"I just watched both seasons of the Gunslinger Girl anime adaptation. I'm not sure if this is addressed in the show or the manga, but why are all the cyborgs female? I take it that they are kids because it's easier to condition them - are there any male cyborgs in the manga? "
1000,Can a user be hurt by his own chakra?,"In the Naruto world, is it possible to get hurt directly by your own chakra? For example, Naruto's rasengan is a manifestation of his chakra, so is Sasuke's chidori and Itachi's fire style jutsus. If Naruto were to accidentally hit himself with his own rasengan, would it affect him the same way it would if he used it on someone else? Because it's his own chakra, would his body just absorb it? Same goes for Sasuke's lightning blade and first style jutsus. If Itachi blew a fireball into the wind and it came back and hit him, would he be hurt by it? "
1001,Is Yamsk 11 based on a real life location?,"The Full Metal Panic series is known to reference various real life location.  For an example the fictional Jindai (陣代) High School is based on the real life Jindai (神代) High School in Choufu, Tokyo.  The closest station to the real life Jindai High School is the Senkawa station, changed from 仙川 to 泉川 (Izumikawa).  Is Yamsk 11 based on a real life location? If so where is the real like location of Yamsk 11, the secret city where the Omni-Sphere known as TAROS resides? "
1002,Is this purported video showing the ending real or fake?,I am confused. Could someone please take a look at this video purportedly showing the English and Japanese versions of the Code Geass Ending and tell if it is real or fake? 
1003,Is Klein gay? Is he gay for Kirito?,"At the end of episode 1, Klein tells Kirito that he looked cute, and was totally his type (script):       You were actually pretty cute.      That's my type.   Does this mean something different in Japanese?  Was something lost in translation?  Or is Klein gay for Kirito?  Or is Klein gay in general?  I can't recall another anime that I've watched that had similar dialogue, but I don't watch anime where dudes are explicitly hot for each other either.  I'm re-watching SAO and I never noticed this the first two times through. "
1004,What is the significance of the name Bleach?,"The name ""Bleach"" seems to be having no relevance to the plot unlike most other series. Was it just chosen at Kubo-sensei's whim or does it have some significance? Maybe some cultural significance associated with shinigami, etc. that I am now aware of? "

1006,Is code in episode 1 of New Game 2 actually an infinite loop?,"In episode 1 of New Game 2, around 9:40, there is a shot of the code that Nene has written:    Here is it in text form with the comments translated:    // the calculation of damage when attacked void DestructibleActor::ReceiveDamage(float sourceDamage)  {     // apply debuffs     auto resolvedDamage = sourceDamage;     for (const auto&amp; debuf:m_debufs)     {         resolvedDamage = debuf.ApplyToDamage(resolvedDamage);         m_currentHealth -= resolvedDamage         if (m_currentHealth &lt;= 0.f)         {             m_currentHealth = 0.f;             DestroyMe();         }     } }   After the shot, Umiko, pointing at the for loop, said that the reason why the code crashed is that there is an infinite loop.  I don't really know C++ so I'm not sure whether what she is saying is true.  From what I can see, the for loop is just iterating through the debufs that the Actor currently has. Unless the Actor has an infinite amount of debufs, I don't think it can possibly become an infinite loop.  But I'm not sure because the only reason that there is a shot of the code is that they wanted to put an easter egg here, right? We would have just gotten a shot of the back of the laptop and heard Umiko saying ""Oh you've got an infinite loop there"". The fact that they actually showed some code makes me think that somehow the code is an easter egg of some sort.  Will the code actually create an infinite loop? "
1007,Did Caulifla learn super saiyan and super saiyan 2 in the same day?,"Note: we're already in episode 98 of Dragon Ball Super, yet, if it's considered this topic has to be hidden with the spoilers invisible tag, edit the parts you consider relevant.  Details from episode 92 and 93 behind:  In episode 92 of Dragon Ball Super Cabba teachs Caulifla how to turn into Super Saiyan. And in episode 93, Caulifla, to save Cabba from Kale's attack turns into Super Saiyan 2. Is this supposed to happen all in the same day? Did Caulifla actually learn super saiyan 2 by her own and in the same day she learnt super saiyan?    "
1008,What is Shikizaki Kiki's final completed Deviant Sword?,"In the series, it was mentioned that Shikizaki Kiki created the 12 Deviant Swords with the purpose of perfecting one final sword.  What is this final sword? How was it completed?  "
1009,What were Alluka's first three wishes from Killua (after reunion)?,"It is stated that Alluka made 3 wishes, but I counted 4 of them. Which of the ones I counted is discarded? What are the 3 wishes exactly?  1) ""Die.""    2) ""Wake up.""    3) ""Play Shiritori with me.""    4) ""Pat my head.""    But they count the wishes as 3 only.   "
1010,Why does Naruto's clothes not burn after wearing the Kyuubi cloak?,"I was watching Naruto Shippuden, episodes 35 to 45, and it is said many times that Naruto's skin burns when under Kyuubi's chakra effects. In those episodes, we see Naruto's skin is ripped off by Kyuubi's cloak when transforming into fourth tails.   Why does Naruto still have clothes after Yamato reverts the 4 tailed state? If Kyuubi's chakra destroys what is under the cloak, shouldn't Naruto be naked after Yamato's jutsu? "
1011,What settings/characters/events portrayed in Samurai Champloo are based in real events?,"Samurai Champloo is supposed to take place at a fictional version of Japan in the Edo period. However, some settings/characters/events seem to be based in real events (the case of the Shimabara Rebellion is one of them).    What are the settings/characters/events portrayed in Samurai Champloo that are based in real-world events? And how historically accurate are they?   "
1012,Why did Saki's cantus arrive late?,"It's been long since I watched this, but as far as I can remember, Saki's cantus ""arrived late"". I think it was in the scene where her bedroom's things begun flying around violently while she slept.  When she arrives at the academy, she says something along the lines of     Well, it's not so weird for somebody to get their cantus late, right?   But they tell her that nobody else got their cantus late. She was the only one.  Is it ever explained, perhaps in the novel, why did her cantus arrive late? "
1013,Why does Zankyou no Terror's OP end with a disclaimer?,"At the end of Zankyou no Terror's OP, a disclaimer is displayed. It reads:       This show is a work of fiction. Any resemblance to real people or groups is coincidental.""       The disclaimer is there because the series depicts terrorist acts and whatnot, but:  Is this disclaimer something the team decided to put in order to safeguard themselves? Or are there specific regulations that make them put it there, given the nature of the show?  Also, I'd never seen this type of disclaimer in an anime series before. Are there any other series that also have them? "
1014,The Super Saiyan Legend,"In the original series the Super Saiyan is presented as a myth: according to Vegeta when talking of the legend, he states that the last Super Saiyan existed 1000 years ago. The mythical quality of the Super Saiyan persists during the Frieza saga, and is taken as the reason Frieza decided to kill all Saiyans.  Now in the 2011 OVA, Episode of Bardock, we learn that Bardock could turn into Super Saiyan, and did so in the battle with Chilled.  Can this incongruence be solved? How can the Super Saiyan be a myth/legend if at least one, Bardock, existed barely before the beginning of the original Dragon Ball series? "
1015,Why does Sachi come to Kirito's bed? Does this imply more than what we see?,"Midway through episode 3, Sachi comes to Kirito's room at night holding her pillow.  Given that we just saw Kirito comforting Sachi under the bridge, it's natural to assume that she is there for platonic comfort.  However, it's also natural to assume that she's there for non-platonic comfort.  Can we assume any more than what we see happens?  As is later revealed in the anime, adult themes and capabilities are present within the game, so the players can get it on if they want to.  The focus of this episode definitely seems to be on Sachi, and we can presume that later events have a significant impact on Kirito.  SAO Abridged continually refers to the events in this episode throughout the rest of it's first season.  In both SAO and SAO Abridged, the center of this is Sachi, not the entire Black Cats guild.  Given these details, can we assume that Kirito and Sachi got it on that night? "
1016,Why did Mitsuha's face go red when Taki told her that he drank her kuchikamizake?,"Why did Mitsuha's face go red when Taki told her that he drank her kuchikamizake in Kimi No Na Wa?  This question has been nagging at me all night. So, can anyone explain what ""kuchikamizake"" is and why it pertains to this particular scene? "
1017,Why did Macao ask Fairy Tail not to touch Twilight Ogre when they came to take the money?,"In episode 123 of Fairy Tail, the Twilight Ogre guild came to take their money from Fairy Tail. After one of their guys sent Macao flying, he asked Fairy Tail not to touch them.  I found that pretty ridiculous. I mean, for what reason would they prevent them from fighting.  Why did he prevent it? Doesn't this make their guild look even more pathetic? "
1018,Massacre skills of Hameln,How many massacre skills Hameln have? I found out that everyone have 7 massacre skills expect Cinderella who has 6 but at the end game i found Hameln have only 2 skills. Does she only have 2 massacre skills or Did I missed something? 
1019,How is Misaka's railgun so destructive?,"In episode 1 of Railgun, Misaka's railgun up-ends a good chunk of what appears to be an olympic-sized swimming pool. Later in the same episode, it is revealed that her railgun travels at a velocity of 1030 m/s.    However, the numbers don't add up.  Suppose Misaka uses 10 gram coins. At 1030 m/s, that coin has this much energy:  Energy = 1/2 m v^2        = 1/2 (0.01 kg) (1030 m/s)^2 = 5304.5 kg (m/s)^2        = 5304.5 Joules   An olympic-sized swimming pool has 2,500,000 kg of water. Based on the image above, that cone probably travels a good 100 meters into the air.  So let's say for benefit of the doubt, that only 10% of the water is lifted 100 meters into the air.  Energy = m g h        = (0.01 * 2500000 kg) (9.8 m/s^2) (100 m) = 2.45 * 10^8 kg (m/s)^2        = 2.45 * 10^8 Joules   The coin needs 2.45 * 10^8 Joules of energy to uplift the swimming pool as shown above. But her coin can only provide 5304.5 Joules. There is a difference of about 4 orders of magnitude.    Okay... Before anyone dismisses this as just another case of Anime physics, let's look at what else could produce so much energy:   The spin of the coin is not captured in the net velocity of 1030 m/s. But given the moment of inertia of a little coin, it would need a tremendous (relativistic?) amount of spin to carry 10^8 Joules. The charge of the coin is unspecified in the Anime. Perhaps Misaka somehow polarizes the charge in the coin and somehow makes it release upon contact with the target. The mass-energy (E = mc^2) of the coin is 9 * 10^14 Joules. Is this what she did?   So the question is: Is there any official explanation for where the coin gets so much energy? Or are we left to dismiss this as another case of Anime physics? "
1020,Does the Parappa the Rapper anime actually have any rapping?,"I watched the Parappa the Rapper anime several years ago, given that it was one of my favorite video games. However, I quickly discovered a fatal flaw: there was no actual rapping!! The producers instead decided to make it a children's show. How do you make an anime about a rapping dog with no actual rapping?!  I only watched a few episodes before I dropped it. But if there actually is some rapping somewhere in the show, it would at least be worth my time to watch that. Does Parappa (or anyone else) rap at any point in the series? "
1021,Why does Shiroe bought all the land in Yamato and sold it to the server?,"In Log Horizon S2E12,       Shiroe asked one of the Kunies to lend him money so that he can buy all the land of Yamato, and then though a contract, reassign it to the Server permanently. He explained that this is so that other players can't buy the land and misuse it. e.g. trapping people out of the bank etc.   I understand that. This means that in terms of land ownership, it will become something similar to when Elder Tale was still a game.  However, doesn't this cause another problem?      The whole reason why Shiroe bought the zone of the guild house in season 1 was to maintain peace in Akihabara wasn't it? Other members of the Round Table said that there is no way to maintain law and order, and Shiroe revealed that he now owns the bank, which means he can just restrict the access to the bank, of whoever breaks the ""law"" (""kicking them out"" of Akiba). And thus peace is maintained.   So what if someone starts to exploit new players again, like some guild once did to Minori and Touya?  This doesn't seem like something Shiroe would do...  Note that I haven't watched past episode 12 yet. "
1022,Is it known if Ergo Proxy is really set in our world?,"In Wikipedia's page on Ergo Proxy, it is stated that:       The story begins in a futuristic domed city called Romdeau, built to protect its citizens after a global ecological disaster thousands of years prior.   And the ""thousands of years"" part leads to a page on the 23rd century. However, I don't remember any specific year ever having been stated in the anime. I actually don't think it was ever explicitly said whether it takes place in our world or not.  Was it ever stated (in-universe or by the authors) if it takes place in our world? If so, is a specific time-slot/date ever given? Or is the Wikipedia's link to the 23rd century page complete humbug? "
1023,Contradictory cards?,"In Greed Island, one card, Sage's Aquamarine, gives the user friends for life. Another card, Lonely Sapphire, gives the user immense wealth but all of his/her friends will forsake him/her and he'll/she'll be lonely. Are these cards contradictory? If so, what would happen if you used both cards? "
1024,Why won't Harime Nui's left eye heal?,"Fact 1: Any wound on a Life Fiber-infused human will automatically regenerate even if it is opened by a single blade of the Sword Scissors.  Example: Harime Nui's torso is pierced by the blade of the Sword Scissors that is owned by Ryuuko. The wound healed off as soon as the blade is pulled out. There are many scenes like that throughout the series.     (Episode 21, 21:41)  Fact 2: A wound on a Life Fiber-infused human will be prevented from regenerating only if it is cut by the two blades of the Sword Scissors, Bakuzan or an equivalent weapon at the same time.  Proof: The dialog at the beginning of episode 23.     Inumuta Houka: I figured out why Harime Nui's arms couldn't regenerate.   The Sword Scissors and Bakuzan are able to cut Life Fibers.   But for the case of strong Life Fibers, it immediately starts to regenerate from the point where it is cut off.   However, if it is cut from the both sides at the same time, it is possible to once again cut off the Life Fibers which started to regenerate.   This is the true power of the Sword Scissors that is made by Professor Matoi.   Matoi Ryuuko: Wait! Then those two Bakuzan pieces...   Inumuta Houka: ... will have the same effect.    (Episode 23, Just after the opening)  Contradiction: When Harime Nui invades Matoi Isshin's laboratory, he cuts Nui's left eye with only one blade of the Sword Scissors, but that eye of Nui never heals up. He couldn't have used both the blades, because the other blade of the scissors pair wasn't pulled out of his body until Ryuuko arrived.   (Episode 12, 07:29)  Question: Why doesn't Nui's left eye heal? It is not cut with the two blades together at the same time from both sides. It is cut with only one blade. Thus, it must be able to regenerate. But, it doesn't. Why? "
1025,Why doesn't Chen Guo find out who Ye Xiu is?,"Why doesn't Chen Guo, the net cafe owner, find out that Ye Xiu is the Battle God of Glory? Doesn't his friend Tan Rou who is playing with him also know it? "
1026,What happened to Lala in To LOVE-Ru Darkness?,"I'm embarrassed to admit to watching this show. But this question has been bothering me for some time.  Lala is pretty much the main character in the series. She is the typical ""primary"" female in this genre of harem Anime.  Lala was the main character for the first two seasons: ""To LOVE-Ru"" and ""Motto To LOVE-Ru"".  However, in season 3 (To LOVE-Ru Darkness) Lala suddenly disappears from the stage and is no longer the main character. Instead Momo (Lala's sister) becomes the primary female character.  Why is this? What influenced the author to pull Lala from center stage and replace her with Momo? "
1027,What is the significance of the symbol in Tanaka's eyes?,"At the end of the Thanatos Report OVA (set after the events of the .hack//Sekai no Mukou ni movie) after Tanaka picks up a certain chip, a symbol appears in his eyes.   What is the significance of this symbol? What does it mean for Tanaka?   "
1028,Where was Hamura when Madara decided to steal the Ten-Tails' Gedo Body?,"The main reason Hamura and his family went to the moon was to watch over the Ten-Tails' outer body. So, how was Madara able to steal the Ten-Tails' outer body so easily? It seems like a plot crack because the Otsutsuki would have been protecting it, right? "
1029,Are the events in Ishbal based on or inspired by the Holocaust?,"I've noticed that a lot of Western fans seem to associate the genocide / war in Ishval with the Holocaust (or alternatively, the Middle East). However, from somewhat secondary sources, I've heard that Arakawa was inspired by the plight of the Burakumin or Ainu. (The first I don't remember the reference for; the second appears on this page for Scar and on this reported interview, although there's no statement of where this is from.)  Given that FMA is a Japanese manga and that the direct linkage of Amestris to Germany seems tenuous, I am more inclined to assume that there isn't an exact real world parallel to Ishbal. (After all, the exact details of what happened in FMA don't entirely match up to what I know about the Holocaust. In combination with the statements by Arakawa and the fact that Amestris isn't really reducible to being a ""fantasy version of German"", I would assume that the events are largely fantasy, even if some portions might be inspired by various real-life events.)   Moreover, I would see it as best to assume that the events in Ishval were inspired (at least partly) by issues such as Japanese colonialism (per statements about interviewing war veterans1), even if some aspects might be European. My cynical self suggests that Western fans are also more likely to say Ishvalan War of Extermination == Holocaust because they simply are more likely to have more experience with it (or with the Middle East being an issue) than with tensions in East Asia, and not because this was necessarily explicitly stated somewhere.  What exactly is the arc involving Ishbal supposed to be based on, if anything? Is the oft-cited factoid that it is based on the Holocaust true, or is it more reasonable to associate it with issues linked to Japan or to see it as a largely fantastic element with occasional grounding in things that have happened in real life?     (Update) I now realise that the most obvious purpose of such interviews would be to get some grounding for the experiences of military characters such as Mustang or Hawkeye. However, I'm trying to preserve the question as close to its original form as possible (and there, I had mentioned East Asia) in this clean-up.  "
1030,What was the point of the game in Future Diary?,"In Future Diary, the justification for the game was that Deus was dying and looking for a successor.  That's an easy enough premise to understand.  But then it turns out that this is not the first time that this has happened.  Yuno had previously won the game and used her powers to enter the reality that we observe so that she can be with Yuki.  That is a little complicated but still relatively easy to follow.  Then when Yuki wins he ends up in his own reality, and we see that Deus is alive and well and it is around here that I begin to lose the plot.  What is the point of the game?  It shows absolutely no evidence of achieving it's stated goal, and by all appearances the stated justification for the game itself is false.  I realize that this question may seem confusing, but that is only because the subject matter is immensely confusing.  So, in short, what was the point of the game? "
1031,What is the cover of Reset! Chapter 2 a reference to?,"I've read three chapters of the manga Reset!, which takes place in the same world as Yuru Yuri. Each chapter's cover seems to be a reference to some other work. For example, here's the Chapter 3 cover:    Which is a reference to this famous Kanon image:    Here's the cover of Chapter 1:    Which I believe is a reference to this Little Busters image:    Here's the cover of Chapter 2:    I cannot figure out what this image is referring to. Since the other two were works by Key, I checked into Clannad, Air, and Rewrite, but none of them seem to match that logo. Does anyone recognize this image? "
1032,Continuity between Pretty Cure series,"It's ""common knowledge"" that each Pretty Cure series takes place in its own continuity.  From my limited experience with the franchise I've already seen two contradictions with that idea.   Kenta Hoshino, a supporting character in Splash Star, made an appearance in the previous series, Max Heart.  He was even slightly younger in it. In both Splash Star and Heartcatch, Cures have been shown to be a long-standing order of warriors.   What's the official stance on continuity?  Is this ""common knowledge"" based on official statements? "
1033,Does Shikamaru have a summoning animal?,"What is the summoning of Shikamaru?   And also, can I get some explanation of his chakra nature? I don't get it, as Kakashi skips it during Naruto's training for rasen-shuriken. "
1034,How could Ichigo purify souls with Zangetsu?,"In the anime and presumably the manga, we see at least one instance of Ichigo using Zangetsu to purify a soul.  But how is this possible?  Zangetsu is the manifestation of Ichigo's Quincy power, which is known to destroy souls rather than purify them.  How does this work?  "
1035,How does Nagato create and use so many Rinnegan eyes?,"The corpses that Nagato uses for the Six Paths technique also possess Rinnegan eyes! How did he get so many Rinnegan eyes?  Is it that the corpse used for one of the six paths has a Rinnegan activated by default? Or is it a convention that Kishi has maintained just to picturize and show us the connectivity?  Of course, they aren't true eyes.       Even when Tobi possessed Rinnegan, his puppets (corpse he used) had both sharingan and Rinnegan! Now, from where did he bring 6 Sharingan eyes and 6 Rinnegans? Definitely they aren't real ones, What kind of Jutsu is that, that makes corpse possess eye technique?  "
1036,Which universe is Future Trunks from?,"Universe 6 and universe 7 are twin universes   If Earth didn't have life in Universe 6(Champa's universe). From where does Trunks come from? He couldn't have come from other Universe because they aren't twin universe.  If Trunks has come from alternate timeline of Universe 7, how did  an evil Goku come? He should have died of that heart virus?  Edit: Trunks has come from an alternate timeline of Universe 7.  And if Evil Goku is from Universe 6, how does TRUNKS know about him? "
1037,What are the differences between the original and the light novels' story of The World God Only Knows?,"In The World God Only Knows, the manga and anime follow pretty much the same story, but I've read that the light novel, written by Mamizu Arisawa is a completely original story.  What are the major differences between the two story lines? Are there different characters? "
1038,Does Orochimaru need a host?,"After the Hokage the third took his arms, Orochimaru needed a new body for himself. Later, shortly before Sasuke killed him, this body was rejecting him, so he wanted to take Sasukes body as his new host. In his fight against Sasuke, he abandons his body and appears as a huge snake. And here's the question: Does Orochimaru need a host at all, and why? Or can he stay as a snake for longer time? "
1039,Why English title of Still world is Beautiful?,"The English title within the for Soredemo Sekai wa Utsukushii anime is Still world is Beautiful:   Crunchyroll calls it ""The World is Still Beautiful"".  Finally, it's English Wikipedia article says the literal English translation is ""Even So, The World is Beautiful"". (Although the article title itself uses Crunchyroll's name.) Is this a particularly hard phrase to translate? Both Crunchyroll's and Wikipedia's titles sound fine in English.  Did the animation studio know Still world is Beautiful would sound and look wrong to English speakers? I can imagine it being just a poor translation, but it seems more likely someone at the studio thought it would fit the series better. If so, why? "
1040,If a white person/American was to make anime is it still anime?,"So let’s say an American decided to go to Japan and produce their own anime, would it still be considered an anime even if the person is not Japanese but creating it in Japan?Im not really looking for the difference between anime and cartoons, but more of what things have to be done to consider it an anime or what has to be done so that it’s not considered an anime. For example: Where it’s produced, who is producing it? etc.   Hopefully that makes sense..  "
1041,"Did Mirai Kuriyama really rebuild her body, or what really happened to it?","Mirai's body vanished/consumed/disintegrated during the battle vs Kyoukai no Kanata, then there is this version of her in Akihito's ""dream world"" that dissolves on-screen, then months(?) later she is alive in flesh and blood (pun intended).  So, what happened?  Was her blood control so high that she willed herself back into a physical body, or is it some Applied Phlebotinum fiat? "
1042,How does Starlight Breaker work?,"Most of Nanoha's attacks consist of emitting some beam or ball of energy through her body or Raising Heart and firing it at the enemy. For instance, here's Divine Buster:    Presumably she just uses her own magical energy for this. But Starlight Breaker is an exception to that. The energy seems to gather up and fire at the energy from thin air. Different versions depict it differently, but it always seems like the energy isn't coming from Nanoha directly (except the little bit that she uses to initiate the attack). Here's the movie version, it's especially apparent in the upper left corner:    Is this just a visual quirk of the attack, or does it actually work differently from her other ones? And if so, where is all that energy coming from? "
1043,What would be considered canon in the Pokemon franchise?,"Usually we would treat the manga as canon for most works, but as most people usually only have watched the animation or played the video games, would in this case the manga still be considered canon over the anime? Or would it be the videogame and manga based on it? "
1044,How did Dio Brando survive the ship sinking?,"In JoJo's Bizarre Adventure Part I Phantom Blood, in the climax ending, Jonathan sacrifices his life to defeat Dio and save Erina, his unborn child Jorge and baby Lisa Lisa.  Erina manages to save herself and Lisa Lisa by hiding in Dio's coffin, but then in Stardust Crusaders, another coffin with ""DIO"" engraved on it is rescued from the bottom of the ocean where Dio had been sleeping for the past century, having survived by stealing Jonathan's body.  Where did that second coffin come from? I've came back to this to try and make sense of it but I don't know if it's a plot hole or not.  I enjoy JoJo's Bizarre Adventure so much, and there are instances where it really stretches it too far.  Like some bizarre happenings have some kind of explanation in it (see King Crimson) but this one is the one that still evades me.  Is there an explanation for this?  "
1045,What is Shanks relationship with the Gorosei,"   In One piece, Chapter 907, the Gorosei(Five Elder allows Shanks to enter into Mary Geoise and even go as far as to have a meeting with him and that seems like some serious double standard, considering the fact that the Five Elders do not like pirates, and use the Marines and Warlords to capture them.     Why would the Gorosei allow a Yonko (Who is one of their biggest enemies) to come into their Holy land? I know that warlords are an exception to this rule since they do the bidding of the Marines in exchange for Amnesty. However, Shanks is an Emperor and considering his influence, capturing him would logically be the best option but instead they'd have a meeting with him.  Could this imply that Shanks is secretly in league with the world Government? Or does he have some form of leverage over them? Its not adding up because in the last war (Battle of Marinefold),  Aces execution was used to draw Whitebeard out (Yonko at that time).  And it was Shanks who ended the war. Then after that, they have a meeting. Is there an alliance or something were missing? "
1046,What was the apocalypse that preceeded Sora no Woto?,"The series Sora no Woto was based in a post-apocalyptic world that significantly reduced the technological capability of mankind. (Takemikazuchi spider tanks -> mundane tanks)  Then entire show focuses on events after the apocalypse, with only a glimpse of flash-backs to earlier events during the apocalypse. But for the most part, the apocalypse itself is largely shrouded.    Are there any details about:   What the apocalypse was? How did it happen? What did the pre-apocalyptic world look like?  "
1047,"In Neon Genesis Evangelion, why are Angels attacking?","Why are Angels attacking the earth? What's with ""Adam"" in the basement? And why are the three computers named after the Three Wise Men?  I love the story for the characters and the mecha-battles, but all the symbolism goes over my head. What's it all about? "
1048,Why can't Alphonse repair Edward's automail using alchemy?,"Edward's automail breaks many times during animation, but every time even if Alphonse didn't take any damage they go after Winrey to fix Edward's automail. Now I'm wondering if Alphonse can easily repair a radio or any other mechanical device, why can't he fix Edward's automail? Also, why does neither Edward nor Alphonse try enhancing automail using alchemy? "
1049,What is the conflict between Sea and Devil Fruit?,We all know that Devil Fruit users weakness is the sea. But I wonder what is the conflict between sea and devil fruit? Why is the sea became the devil fruit's weakness? 
1050,Can people log into SAO after the initial trapping?,"Obviously in SAO anyone who was in the game on the first day was trapped inside. My question is, could someone on the outside a day (or whenever) later join in?  I would imagine it would be tempting for someone who had a significant other, child, someone, in the game or maybe they were depressed and thought SAO would lead to a better life.   I'm sure they would then become trapped themselves but is there anything stopping that initial jump after Akihiko Kayaba already trapped everyone? "
1051,"Was there any difference between ""Star Blazers"" and ""Space Battleship Yamato""?","Were there any differences between the original Space Battleship Yamato and the U.S. Syndicated Star Blazers other than the westernized names of the characters? Specifically, were there plot elements that were altered, or re-arranged? Were there any scenes that were removed?  I know that Syndicated had modified some of their other properties (like Gatchaman) but I can't remember if this was the case with Star Blazers. "
1052,Translation of alphabet used in Konosuba,"Is there a complete translation of the ""letters"" used in the world of Konosuba? I'm talking like the ones seen on their adventurer cards. I'm positive each symbol corresponds to a letter of the English alphabet, but I want the complete list of them if possible?  Here's Megumin's card:   "
1053,Can a Nen user still use their abilities after Kuroro Lucifer steals it?,"When Kuroro Lucifer steals the ability of another nen user, does it mean that the original user wont be able to use it anymore? Or is it like a copy-paste, like Ging copy-pasting the punching abilities? Because in the last arc, he was using Shalnark's ability 'Black voice'.   Does it mean the original user can't use it anymore? Can Chrollo give back the nen abilities that he stole?  "
1054,Does Near want to use the death note for himself?,"Tsugumi Ohba, writer of Death Note, said that Near ""becomes less likeable"" as the story advances, citing Near's plan to take the notebook at a later point in the story. Ohba said that a negative reaction originated from ""the difference in their attitudes"" and that people may have viewed Near as ""a cheat."" Ohba added that Near's ""cheeky behavior,"" intended to ""reinforce his childishness,"" had been construed as ""annoying.""   I don't know what this quote from Ohba means. Does this mean Near wants to use the Death Note for himself? Can someone please explain this to me? "
1055,how did Asuna move?,"I know that Kirito didn't die at the end if episode 14 because of his will to fight overthrowing the system. But during the fight with Heathcliff, episode 14, when all players were paralyzed, how did asuna manage to move in front of the sword? Was it the same concept above, or was it because of somthing else? "
1056,Why aren't mages trusted to remove their own limiters?,"In Nanoha StrikerS (season 3), several of the high-end mages had limiters imposed on them to limit their power output thereby reducing their mage rank levels:   Nanoha Takamachi - S+ reduced to AA. Fate Testarossa - S+ reduced to AA. Hayate Yagami - SS reduced to A. Lutecia Alphine - S reduced to D?   The purpose of the limiters was to limit the damage that could be caused to a small area and possibly to protect the mages themselves from overexerting.  Furthermore, limiters can only be removed by a high-ranked official.  With the exception of Lutecia (who was a captured antagonist), why were the mages not trusted to remove their own limiters if their purpose was to prevent accidental collateral damage? "
1057,Are any JoJo's anime related?,"I started with the latest one the one, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Golden Wind and came to know that the anime is even older. Found many series dating back to 2012. So, as I started watching the 2012 series, I saw that it is a vampire genre. Vampire -> Stand. I don't see any connection.   I saw a YouTube video of the strongest immortal characters and there's a listing of a character from these anime. So, I don't want to miss any connection if there is one, as I am planning to skip the 2012 series because of its genre (vampire).  Are any JoJo's anime related? "
1058,What happened to Kintoki Sakata?,"In the beginning of the 3rd season of Gintama,      Gintoki was suspiciously missing and was replaced by a blonde haired version of himself named Kintoki.    Later in the series it was explained why Kintoki was created and what had transpired after that which arrived to the point of the beginning of the 3rd season, but what happened to Kintoki after that? Does he just disappear or is there more information in the Gintama manga? "
1059,Was the ending of Mawaru Penguindrum completely incoherent?,"The ending of Mawaru Penguindrum had a lot of ambiguous symbolism.  My first impression was that the writer had no idea how to resolve the fundamental questions of the plot, and thus had to throw out completely unresolvable symbolism in order to fake an ending. A few of my driving questions throughout the series were as follows:   A recurring motif of the show is that the main character would get possessed by a penguin hat, and pull one or two characters into a kind of alternate reality where they were handcuffed.  To what degree was this a hallucination?  Likewise, Penguins 1, 2, and 3, plus the additional penguin, were important characters who were not visible to most people in the show.  To what degree were they hallucinations, and to what degree were they paranormal?   Were there any forces in the story that were godlike, in that they were both powerful and capable of passing judgement on mortals?  In particular, at the end of the show, it seems that two boys sacrificed their mortal lives for the sake of two girls.  Was this a sacrifice made to a god or other cosmic power?  "
1060,"What are the ""recitals"" in Monster?","In Naoki Urasawa's Monster, there were ""recitals"" held with children at the Red Rose Mansion. Did they ever explain what these ""recitals"" really were? Were the children reenacting the events of some of the picture books? I have watched the whole series and I never quite understood what a ""recital"" actually was. "
1061,Is Rascal correctly wearing a real type of backpack?,"In the first set of opening credits for Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai we see a short scene of Rascal wearing an unusual type of backpack in a way I have never seen before.   I have only watched the first three episodes, and I don't believe there has been context for this picture presented. I've never seen such a narrow backpack before, but I'll assume they exist.  Several characteristics strike me as odd:   By as low as it sits, it is as much as a ""butt pack"" as a backpack, at least as Rascal is wearing it. The upper straps are shown restricting his arms. Is he unnecessarily binding his arms, or is that the proper way to wear it? If the backpack were raised high enough for the upper straps to fit over his shoulders (common for most backpacks I believe), then the lower strap would seem to fit around his upper chest, which also seems unusual.   Is this a real world item being worn the way it is supposed to be? "
1062,Why are a lot of characters in anime and manga named after their mothers and not their fathers?,"I've noticed this a lot in many manga I've read. The character (usually the protagonist) is named after their mother's family name and not their father's. Some examples I have found of this are as follows:   In Special A, Kei Takashima is named of his mother's family not his father's. Unless the parents were cousins, it seems the dad changed his name to Takashima, too. In Naruto, Naruto Uzumaki is named after his mother Kushina Uzumaki. I know that this may be a plot device to hide who Naruto's father is at the beginning, but still why name after the mother? Why wasn't he named Namikaze? In Shokugeki no Soma, Saiba Jouichiro changes his name to his wife's: Yukihira. Why doesn't he keep his name? It's possible that he wants to stay out of the public eye, but is it common for the man to take his wife's name? Another example from the same manga as above, Azami Nakamura. He changed his name to Nakiri after marrying into Erina's mother's family. It could have been for prestige, but isn't it normally the wife who changes the name and not the husband? And Erina is named from her mother's family too.   Sorry for all the examples, but I really would like it if someone could help me understand. I know it could be because of a plot device, but it has confused me for a while. "
1063,What is the context for Rimuru's joke about taking five minutes for the audience to quiet down?,"In an episode of That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime, Rimuru is beginning to talk to his villagers. See episode 3, timecode 17:30.       Right, it took five minutes for all of you to quiet down.   He waits momentarily to give them a chance to respond, then thinks to himself after no response:     They didn't get my best joke?!   Unfortunately, neither do I. It appears to involve the fake mustache, which he discards soon after that.  My guess is that this scenario would be familiar to a Japanese audience.  What is the ""joke"" Rimuru is making? If it is something from Japanese culture, why would he think the evolved goblins and direwolves from this different world would understand it? "
1064,How could Tosen know that Kenpachi was smiling?,"When Tosen fights Kenpachi in the Rescue Rukia arc, Tosen uses his bankai to combat Kenpachi.  A while later, Kenpachi figures out how to defeat Tosen's bankai and smiles. Tosen somehow knew that he smiled (Because we heard his thoughts: ""He's smiling?"")  However, Tosen is blind. How could he have known? "
1065,"Does this character in ""Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion"" die?",Does      Lelouch Vi Britannia   survive at the end of Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion?  Some people say that      he's seen in Code Geass: Akito the Exiled   but isn't this before the events of the first two seasons? 
1066,What happened in episode 11 of the Little Busters Refrain anime?,"I am on Episode 11, they just ""explained everything"" but I don't understand it at all. How is a new world created? What was season one? What happens to the people from the bus?  "
1067,Are there any characters designed specifically for Norio Wakamoto?,"Norio Wakamoto is a veteran Japanese voice actor with a long portfolio of characters that he's voiced. His craft is such that he often times gets pigeon-holed into a certain character archetype that fits a particular acting style of his.  This acting style is so prominent that you often have people try to imitate his voice, other voice actors/actresses that try to imitate him for fun, and even competitions at conventions (like at Moe Culture Festival 2012) for imitating him. These characters are usually evil (but not necessarily an antagonist), funny, maybe a little crazy. Characters like Onsokomaru (2x2 Shinobuden), Victoreem (Gash Bell), Garuda (Magical Quiz Academy), Katakuriko Matsudaira (Gintama), Amagumo (Desert Punk), etc.  Are there any characters (whether they fit this archetype or not) that were designed specifically for Wakamoto to play? I know there's Commander Wakamoto from Virgin Fleet, which I didn't find really matching the archetype, but it's hard to imagine that the names were just coincidence. Was Commander Wakamoto designed to be played by Norio Wakamoto? "
1068,What is the background music played in ep. 2 when we are told of the conquest of Japan?,"What is the background music played in the first 30 seconds of episode two, when a narrator speaks of the conquest of Japan? This is the section before the OP is played. "
1069,Why did Madara use wood clones to manifest Susanoo while fighting the 5 Kage instead of shadow clones?,"Was it because:     shadow clones can't perform Susanoo, but wood clones can?   wood clones are stronger/better than shadow clones?   Madara couldn't perform Shadow Clone Technique?  of any other reason not mentioned above?  "
1070,What are Type A and Type B viewers?,I keep hearing the terms Type A viewers and Type B viewers in discussions and chat.  What do they mean? What is a Type A viewer and what is a Type B? 
1071,What happen if the Supreme Kais were removed from Good Buu's body?,"The fat version of Buu, or simply Innocent / Good Buu is the result of Kid Buu's absorption of Grand Supreme Kai and the Supreme Kais. Does the Supreme Kais still staying inside Good Buu's body?  I know if they remove the Supreme Kais, he will become the original Buu again. But, since the Good Buu and the Z Fighters were already removed from Super Buu's body, turning him into Kid Buu, then the Grand Supreme Kai and the Supreme Kais are definitely still inside Good Buu's body! But wait a second, if they remove the Supreme Kais from Good Buu, doesn't it mean that he will become Kid Buu again? Or he will split into the Supreme Kais and not having back the ""Buu"" body? Or, the Supreme Kais were just simply not exist inside Good Buu? "
1072,Are Sword Art Online and Accel World related?,"Recently, I have been hearing loads of theories about Sword Art Online and Accel World being related due to the fact that they refer to NerveGear and such in Accel World.   I have also been hearing that the plot of Accel World was made by Kirito.  Is there some sort of confirmation of this? Or trustworthy speculation? "
1073,Can Ken Kaneki from Tokyo Ghoul self cannibalize?,Would it be possible for Kaneki to eat himself to prevent starvation? Or to keep himself from dying? 
1074,Sadaharu's form in Gintama,"Since the Gintama anime recently ended, I dont think I saw what happened to Sadaharu after becoming small inside a sphere (of aura?). Will he always remain in that form now? Please clear  this question. Its been bugging my mind ever since I watched the last episode. "
1075,Couldn't Kabuto have un-summoned Itachi?,"I know that the Kotoamatsukami rendered Itachi free of Kabuto's control over his will. But he was still bound to the Edo Tensei, since he was released when the technique was cancelled.  So, couldn't Kabuto simply have un-summoned Itachi?    We have, in other situations (namely in chapter 514, with Deidara), seen that Kabuto can un-summon shinobi at will, an empty coffin appearing and 'reclaiming' the summoned. Were these other situations somewhat different from the situations with Itachi? Or did Kabuto have to completely undo the technique, even if he just wanted to un-summon a single shinobi? "
1076,What is this Detective Conan OVA title?,I just remember the last section bit where Conan &amp; Sonoko(?) forced to make emergency  landing on some harbor(?). I think the real Pilot &amp; Co-Pilot got poisoned by accident because they are kissing the victim hand without their gloves. 
1077,Why does the quality and style on this Naruto Shippuden series differ from the regular one?,I was watching this episode of Naruto on YouTube.  I would like to know why the quality and style of the anime differs from the regular one? 
1078,"In Sparks Liner High, could Avalon have saved Shirou?","In the Sparks Liner High ending of Heaven's Feel,       Shirou ends up as a vegetable, since his mind has completely deteriorated.   However, since he was lying next to Saber, could his deteriorated brain have been repaired by Avalon? Avalon is supposed to have ultimate regenerative properties, so wouldn't it be able to regenerate him?   Not to mention, Avalon allows people to use techniques that would normally be too overbearing to the user (like how Kiritsugu could use higher levels of Time Alter). Shouldn't the same apply to Shirou?  "
1079,Kakashi's chakra nature,"I haven't read the manga, but I have been watching the anime. Kakashi seemed to use earth style before inclining to lightning style.   So can a shinobi learn to master a chakra nature other than his chakra nature easily ? Or does Kakashi have both the chakra natures ? "
1080,Shouldn't Edward Elric still be able to perform alchemy?,"The reason I ask this is because Edward had his own portal of truth that he discovers after leaving Gluttony, but that's the first time he notices it. The first time he meets Truth, there's only one gate. Unless that first gate was Edward's portal of truth, and Gluttony was like some weird second door that gave him a sort of secondary exit, wouldn't Ed still be able to perform alchemy?  We never really learn what the two different gates mean, other than that one is Edward's portal of truth. What is the other? Has it been there the whole time? (Is it the one he used when he was little? He performed alchemy then, didn't he? With just one portal of truth, that, for all we know, wasn't his? Is this making any sense?) He gives up his portal of truth, yes, and all that should do is make it so that Ed can't go hopping back and forth to see Truth, as that was the access the second portal kinda allowed. "
1081,What has Mamoru Hosoda directed at Toei that he isn't credited for?,"On AnimeNewsNetwork, Mamoru Hosada is credited for around thirty productions under various roles:   Alice SOS (TV) Ashita no Nadja (TV) Coo: Tooi Umi Kara Kita Coo (movie) Crying Freeman (OAV) Digimon Adventure (TV) Digimon Adventure: Bokura no War Game (movie) Digimon Adventure: Born of Koromon (movie) Digimon: The Movie (U.S.) Dragon Ball Movie 4: The Path to Power Dragon Ball Z (TV) Dragon Ball Z Movie 10: Broly - Second Coming Dragon Ball Z Movie 8: The Legendary Super Saiyan Galaxy Express 999: Eternal Fantasy (movie) (The) Girl Who Leapt Through Time (movie) Occult Academy (TV) Ojamajo Doremi DOKKAAN!

Sakuragi Hanamichi (movie) Spiral (TV) Summer Wars (manga, movie) Superflat Monogram (movie) Voogie's Angel (OAV) Wolf Children (movie) Yu Yu Hakusho The Movie: Poltergeist Report   However, I know he directed a few episodes of Gegege no Kitaro in the mid '90s and the CG short Digimon Adventure 3D: Digimon Grandprix. Which Kitaro episodes did he direct, and is there anything else he directed that ANN hasn't credited him for? "
1082,Who died first? Hänsel or Gretel?,"In Black Lagoon, Hänsel and Gretel are deranged children suffering from Dissociative Identity Disorder.    Each of them have distinct personalities, but from time to time, they switch places with each other - clothing, weapons, voice, personality, and everything.  In episode 15, both of them are killed. Hänsel (the boy) dies in front of Balalaika after being shot by a sniper. Gretel (the girl) dies at the end of the episode when a hitman headshots her from behind.  But do we know if they were themselves when they were killed? Did Hänsel really die first?Or were they switched? Are there any clues anywhere? "
1083,Is Bentham really dead?,"I know that Bentham sacrificed himself to save Luffy so that he can escape from Impel Down.  He disguised as Magellan to open the gates for Luffy, but later the real Magellan came and it seems like the two fight each other (not in screen).  My friends believed that he's dead at that fight. But when I read this, it is stated that he's currently become the new queen of Newkama Land.     Bentham, alias Mr. 2 Bon Kurei, is a former officer agent of Baroque   Works and an okama (a Japanese slang term for a transvestite). While   he was once an enemy of Luffy's as a part of the Baroque Works, the   two became quick friends, leading Bon Kurei to sacrifice himself for   Luffy both at Alabasta and later at Impel Down.    He is currently the new Queen of Newkama Land.   So I want to know, is Bentham or Bon Kurei dead or alive after Impel Down arc? If he alive, have he shown in comics ar anime after Impel Down arc? "
1084,What is a Slay Vega?,"In the manga, Chise is referred to as being a ""Slay Vega."" In Japanese it's 夜の愛し仔（スレイ・ベガ）, ""Beloved Child of the Night.""      What does this term mean? What is the significance of this? "
1085,Who enforces the rules that the gods must obey?,"In episode 10, we learn that gods are forbidden from entering the dungeon. This is apparently against the rules.   But who enforces the rules? What happens to someone found in defiance of them? I mean, Hestia and co. are gods, after all.  "
1086,Was the Chocobi (チョコビ) snack from Shin Chan fictional or did it exist before Shin Chan?,"If you watched the Shin Chan anime series you will know what I'm talking about. (I don't know if Chocobi appears in the manga, too.) Was Chocobi an existing snack that just appeared in the Shin Chan series? Or was it invented with the series and later produced as a real snack for merchandise? "
1087,Does the anime of Denpa Kyoushi add anything new?,"I've kept up to date with the manga of Denpa Kyoushi, which I've really enjoyed - but I've heard bad things about the animé. Mostly about the low standard of art and not doing the manga justice in some scenes.  I did enjoy the manga, but not enough to watch the anime - unless there is any significant difference between them (in which case, I'd like to watch those segments so I have the complete story).  Is there anything major in the anime that is different to the manga? or any new characters? "
1088,What was the “I’m not a bad slime” reference?,"In episode 6 of That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime, Shizue notices that Rimuru is Japanese after he says “I’m not a bad Slime” which is apparently a reference from a game she heard about from a friend she had. We then discover that she got engulfed in flames during an air raid.  Excuse me if I’m wrong, but this seems like an air raid from WW2 and I don’t think there were any games back then. Is she referring to a board game or party game, or have I just got my history mixed up?  I’m curious as to what game she is referring to as well. Where did the idea of living slimes originally come from? Is she referring to a “tabletop RPG”? Where did that quote actually come from? "
1089,What happens if a dragon lacrima of another element is implanted?,"In fairy tail, we know that the third generation dragon slayers have been taught dragon slayer magic by dragons and also that they have dragon lacrimas implanted. If a dragon lacrima of an element of different type is implanted what will happen?  Will they gain two types of dragon slayer magic? ( For example if Sting is implanted with a fire element type dragon lacrima will he gain two types of dragon slayer magic? i.e. holy light type magic taught by Vicelogia and fire type magic gained from the lacrima) "
1090,What happens to Merihim/Shiro after Shana becomes Flame Haze?,"Merihim (whom Shana calls ""Shiro"") played a major role in training Shana prior to her contracting with Alastor and becoming a Flame Haze.    After making the contract, he challenges Shana to one final duel in which she wins. Shortly after, Tendōkyū (the floating landmass where Shana grew up and was trained) crumbles.  What is the fate of Merihim? Did Shana actually kill him? Did he die when Tendōkyū crumbles? I wasn't able to figure this out after re-watching the episode (ep16) a few times.  MAL only lists him as ""disappeared"". But are there any sources that actually confirm his death? "
1091,Why do all Marine Vice Admirals (and higher ranking officers) put their coats as capes?,"  Garp     The Vice Admirals     The Admirals     ex-Fleet Admiral Sengoku   Why are the coats always worn as capes? Is there an in-universe explanation as to why the Marines wear it in that way? The only character who I remember seeing, wearing a coat as it should be worn, is Gol D. Roger. "
1092,Why was Shana naked after using Tenpa Josai?,"In the final episode of season 1 (episode 24), Shana is forced to use her (supposedly suicidal) Tenpa Josai to absorb all the Power of Existence that had been released in the battle.  Tenpa Josai normally kills the Flame Haze, but for reasons explained in the subsequent dialog with Alastor, Shana survives.  But she's naked. Why?  Is there an actual plot reason to it? Or is it just another case of forced fan-service?    Furthermore... where did that towel come from? "
1093,"What's the significance of Kanon becoming ""invisible""?","In Kami-nomi, Kanon (the idol girl) becomes ""transparent"" several times throughout her Arc. (eps 5 - 7)     What is the significance of this? What does it mean? Does it symbolize something?  "
1094,What is the deal with some Emperors,"Note!! There will be Heavy spoilers.  Since the introduction of Haki (after the 2 year time skip), the colour of arms Haki has been the main way of hitting and damaging most defenses from devil fruits (Paramecia and logia type). But in Kaido's case, hitting him with Haki (even when he isn't using Haki) does no damage to him.    How is it possible that even the Color of Arms Aka Busoshoku Haki didn't seem to phase him at all. Is this related to the Tekkai technique used by the Cp-9? (We know the world government captured him at some point). Or is this ability an effect of Kaidos ""serpentine dragon"" devil fruit.  Also is it similar to Big Moms ""invincibility""? Because I also remember Bege talking about how Big Mom had never been wounded till the time she cried from  Mother Carmel's  portrait.  "
1095,Were the players able to communicate with the outside world?,"Were the players of SAO able to communicate with the outside world?  Could they get any info from the outside world?  We don't see anything in season 1 to support this, but they did have information brokers, and I think it was hinted that they brokers could get information from the outside, for example news. "
1096,How many episodes of Naruto are there?,"I have been watching Naruto online, and there are no episodes available to watch after 301, even though I know there is a big war on that episode. Are there any more Naruto episodes? People have been saying there is an episode 700, but is that all manga? "
1097,Who typically owns the rights to an anime's soundtrack?,"I watched episode 7 of Space Patrol Luluco today, and, well, that sure was a thing. Saliently, it featured      a piece from the Kill la Kill soundtrack: ""Gekiban Tokka-gata Hitotsu-boshi Gokuseifuku"" (OST 2 track 1), which is basically the soundtrack-ified version of ""Before my body is dry"", a.k.a. ""DON'T LOSE YOUR WAY"".   (I'm spoilering this because, frankly, this is the best anime-related surprise I've gotten in ages.)    This got me thinking - who typically owns the soundtrack of an anime? Is it the composer, or is it some other party, such as the animation studio or the production committee?   (By soundtrack, I mean the soundtrack; not OPs/EDs, which I strongly suspect tend to have different ownership schemes.)    The situation in Hollywood is interesting as a point of comparison - various ownership schemes seem to be possible (though I don't know which are more common). In some cases, the soundtrack will be treated as a work-for-hire owned by the film's producers; in other cases, the composer will own the soundtrack and will license usage rights to the producers; and surely other possibilities exist. (Keep in mind, of course, that Japan and the US have fairly divergent conventions when it comes to the handling of intellectual property, so the situation in Hollywood is probably not the same as the situation in... Akihabara?) "
1098,Is there anything driving the number of recent series and characters from the Touhoku region?,"In the last couple of seasons of anime, I've noticed quite a few shows being set in or using characters from the Touhoku region, especially around Aomori. Examples of shows include Kumamiko: Girl Meets Bear (set in Kumade Village somewhere in northern Touhoku); Flying Witch (set in Aomori) and Wake Up, Girls! (set in Sendai), while characters include Megumi Tadokoro from Shokugeki no Soma.  Is it just coincidence? Or a desire to pick a setting other than Tokyo or Osaka? Or some kind of reaction to the Touhoku earthquake? "
1099,Why does Takuto break Wako's seal at the end of Star Driver?,"The final episode of Star Driver is somewhat confusing to me. While it's clear what events took place, I don't understand why some of the characters did what they did.  Specifically, why does Takuto decide to break Wako's seal to unleash the cybodies into the normal world?    For the entire series:   The Glittering Crux Brigade seeks to break the seal of all 4 maidens to achieve the 5th phase. Takuto was pretty much fighting against them for the entire series to stop this process.   So why, in the final episode, does he ""change his mind"" and break Wako's seal?  (Note that is it implied that Wako actually allows Takuto to break her seal.) "
1100,Why was Asuna late?,"In season 2, episode 20, Asuna is disconnected from ALO by her mother because she is late for dinner.  Apparently, this isn't the first time she was late, and her mother said so.  The world of SAO allows for an in-game AI-that's-classified-as-an-item/NPC (Yui)to make phone calls, or players to do their homework.  Clearly there are extensions, apps, and 3rd party code available to run in ALO, kind of like with WoW here in The Matrix reality.  Clocks and timers are usually very easy to program, and it wouldn't surprise me if something as sophisticated as a VRMMO already had a rudimentary alarm clock built in.  How/why did Asuna get blindsided by the time?  Is it just a plotpoint meant for the audience to relate to being so engrossed in the game that you lose track of the time?  "
1101,What happened to the third iteration of Yuki?,"In the Redial conclusion to Future Diary, we see the 3rd iteration of Yuno living a normal life in the 3rd reality after the incident caused by the original Yuno and the 2nd Yuki saved her family's future. She has no recollection of Yuki at all in this world, even though she knows she is missing some very important memories.   This is almost identical to the state Yuki is in while trapped in the ""ideal"" world created for him by the original Yuno. However, she purposely removed herself from that false world, so it makes sense that Yuki can't even recall her name.  So what happened to the third iteration of Yuki that meant the 3rd Yuno couldn't remember him? He isn't seen at all in the final episode, so I'm confused as to what occurred in that regard. 1st Yuno wouldn't have had a reason to kill him as she wished to ""try again"" in that timeline, and Yuki, of course, wouldn't want to kill his own self.  Is there an explanation as to what happened to the 3rd timeline's Yuki? And if he did still exist in that iteration, why can't the corresponding Yuno remember his identity at all? "
1102,Current state of characters in Dragon Ball?,"I watched Dragon Ball, DBZ, DBGT, DB Super, but the order is such that DBGT is in the end I believe.  What happened to all the characters? On dragon Ball wikia, it said Goku died and is dead right now at Age 801, but I never saw this? "
1103,Is Unohana's compassion for others just an act?,"Unohana goes from being the most bloodthirsty, sadistic warrior in the Soul Society to being a kind, motherly person who goes out of her way to heal and help others, even enemies, and who tries to avoid and prevent fights.  Is this all an act?  I understand she was waiting around for Zaraki, but she could have done that without becoming the equivalent of Mother Teresa.  Did she really have a change of heart about others, and if so, why? "
1104,Does this swordsman pose have any significance?,"Does this pose of raising your sword with your right hand have any significance? For example, is this a famous pose used by a real life legendary swordsman? Both Zoro of One Piece and Erza of Fairy Tail have used this pose.    "
1105,What are these designs based on?,"I've noticed a recurring design in anime, manga, and other Japanese art and I'm wondering where it comes from. It's basically a jet-like machine or creature with a pointed head, tufted ""ears"", long neck, and sharp wings attached to a back-heavy body. Here's some examples:  The Gekko from Eureka Seven:    Latias/Latios from Pokémon:    Chiara Toscana's weapon/vehicle from Shakugan no Shana:    Are these simply coincidences or is it a design trope, similar to something like mecha? Is there more history behind this shape? If you know of any other examples, I'd love to know about them. "
1106,Why is altering the future limited to diary users?,"Throughout the episodes, there are several scenes that play out in a similar fashion:     Static is heard and a diary's contents are updated to reflect the updated future.      Person 1: ""Did you hear that?""      Person 2: ""There must be another diary user nearby""   But sometimes the things that alter the future are incredibly trivial, (like travelling to a different floor on the elevator, or not eating a salad) and theoretically anyone should be able to do them. The main reason the diary users change the future more often is because they can see certain events in advance and consciously decide to change them, but other than that, they are visibly no different from the rest of the population.  Everyone seems to have free will, and so everyone should be able to make a spontaneous decision and affect the timeline. For example, Yuki altering the future by opening the door at Yuno's house was down to his curiosity alone and not related to his diary, so surely a non-user would have altered the timeline in that same scenario.   Granted, for a diary to display the altered future, it has to correspond with that diary's output (e.g. something in close proximity to Yuki, something affecting an escape for Ninth), but that alone doesn't isolate changes to only other diary users.  So why are the diary users so confident in proclaiming the proximity of another diary user when the future changes? Why couldn't it just be a regular person altering their schedule, coincidentally coinciding with the user? And doesn't Akise change the future (as a non-user) in chapter 14 during the coin game?  Example 1    Chapter 11 page 27  Example 2    Chapter 14 page 33 "
1107,Why didn't Naruto do anything when he and Gaara were being beaten by the ressurected leader?,"In season 4 episodes 219-220 of the original Naruto, when Naruto and Gaara were being beaten by the resurrected leader, why didn’t Naruto release the power of the nine-tailed fox? Why did he almost die and yet nothing happened? He was one of the weakest people in this fight.  "
1108,Where in the Dragon Ball timeline is the Super series?,"At the end of the Dragon Ball series we can see Goku fly off with Uub towards his village to train. There had been years of peace so we see Goten and Trunks all grown to teenagers, yet in the Super series they are still young. So it seems that Uub does not exist yet and the Super series does not follow directly after the Dragon Ball series, the same way the GT series did. So where does it fit in? When does the Super series take place? "
1109,Why does Jushiro Ukitake have an item from Yoruichi's clan?,"Before Rukia's execution, Jushiro Ukitake took some time breaking the seal on an item which was later used to destroy the Sokyoku.    When Ichigo arrives to save Rukia he is wearing a cape which allows him to fly which Soifon comments during her fight with Yoruichi that the cape came from the Shihoin clan, Yoruichi's clan.    They both have the same insignia on it and I recall when Ukitake appeared with the shield thing someone commented that it had the Shihoin clan symbol on it.  But why does Jushiro Ukitake have it? Shouldn't it be with the stealth force or even Yoruichi's possession? Better yet, since it is able to destroy the Sokyoku, why is it entrusted to another captain rather than Head Captain Yamamoto? "
1110,"Any other ""common design archetypes"" in Kiznaiver that are shared with other Trigger-related works?","scroll down for character images  Niiyama Niko seems to be a character that's inspired by Kill la Kill's Mankanshoku Mako (behavior) and Harime Nui (appearance).   Tenga Hajime seems to be a dumber version of Kamina from Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann. Are there any other referances/homages to be found in Kiznaiver? For example, maybe something from Little Witch Academia?   FYI: Kill la Kill, Kiznaiver, and Little Witch Academia are produced by Trigger, which was founded by members of Gainax, which produced Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann.

1111,What happened to Katakuri's mouth?,"In One Piece episode 856 ""The Forbidden Secret! Katakuri's Merienda!"", the cooks who bring Katakuri's lunch say that no one has ever seen Katakuri while he is eating, and her sister Brulee says that he has never once been on his back since he was born. But when Luffy breaks the house made of Mochi by Katakuri, it is seen that he was lying on his back and eating with his big mouth.  So, what happened to Katakuri's mouth that it is so big and horrifying? Why does he hide his mouth and also from everyone while he is eating? Why does he murder the cooks when he is exposed by Luffy?  Relevant YouTube video: Katakuri True Face, Luffy Exposes Him "
1112,Why did Sinon act strangely when Kirito grabbed her tail?,I noticed in an episode of Sword Art Online II (Calibur arc) that Sinon (a Cait Sith) reacted strangely when Kirito grabbed her tail. Silica (also a Cath Sith) noticed this but it seems that she too (just like me) has no idea. What happened here? 
1113,How did Danzo acquire all those Sharingan in his arm?,"I was just wondering, how did Danzo get all those Sharingan eyes in his arm? Is it from the people that Itachi and Tobi killed that night?   "
1114,Why did Gintoki and Jirochou have a second fight?,"I didnt understand why Gintoki and Jirochou had a second fight. They said the winner would keep Tatsugoro's jutte and pipe, but I dont know what they really meant by that. Did they mean the winner would be the one keeping the promise to protect Otose? Did they mean the winner would be the one keeping the promise of protecting the city? "
1115,Why do Chimera Ants seem to remember only one past life?,"Some Chimera Ants remember parts, or all, of their life before they were eaten by the Queen.      By eating other creatures, a Chimera Ant queen can impart the characteristics of ingested creatures onto the next generation of Chimera Ants it gives birth to.    Chimera ants are shown to have characteristics that are from two, sometimes more (in the case of Rammot, a combination of human, rabbit and shrike) It is shown that not only human past lives can be remembered, because in Chapter 197 of the manga, Leol remembers being a lion.   However, the chimera ants that remember their past life seem to only remember one. Is it only possible for them to remember one? Why would this be? If they can remember more, why is this never shown? "
1116,"When is damage ""permanent"" in Accel World?","Within the accelerated world, when someone gets damaged or injured (even severely), they fully recover after leaving and re-entering the accelerated realm. (If you are killed you also come back normally.)  For example:   Taku cuts off Haruyuki's arm. (ep 5) Niko's left arm is ripped off when Yellow Radio's minions tear apart her fortress. (ep 11)     Both of these injuries (a loss of an entire limb) are serious injuries that can't be recovered in battle.* However, when they leave and re-enter the accelerated world, they are fully recovered.  *Barring Chiyuri's time-reversal ability.    But there are at least two instances of when damage is not reversed upon re-entering the accelerated world:   Kuroyukihime amputates Fuuko's legs - hence the wheelchair. (described in ep 16) Noumi steals Haruyuki's wings. (ep 15)     So what determines whether damage is healed?  Furthermore, how does Chiyuri's time-reversal ability play into this? "
1117,Dragon ball super timeline,"The dragon ball super anime started last week.  I'm wondering when this takes place. I know it takes place after the defeat of buu, like a few months or something.  But with the releases of the movies I'm wondering where does those fit in? Can anybody answer me this? "
1118,Does removing Potara earrings of a fused character nullifies the fusion?,"Just give you some info about the Potara earrings.        Potara Fusion is similar to the Fusion Dance technique, however unlike the Fusion Dance, the Potara Fusion is permanent.   To use the Potara fusion, the two fusees each take one of the two earrings and put them on opposing ears. The two will automatically merge as soon as the earrings are put on.      After the fusion is done, the fused character has 2 earrings on each side of their ears, neither in the Anime nor the Manga has shown that fused character remove the Potara earrings. This makes me wonder what happens when fused character like Vegito remove one or two of the earrings, will they be separated? Or still permanently fused forever?   "
1119,What is the weapon Adlet uses to spit fire called?,"In the first episode of Rokka no Yuusha, Adlet uses some kind of tool to spit out fire.    What is this tool called? Is there a real life equivalent?  "
1120,How can Itachi use his Mangekyō Sharingan after death?,"When Naruto was forced to fight Itachi for the first time when he was reanimated by Edo Tensei, you could clearly see that he could still use the power of his Mangekyō Sharingan. How is this possible if Itachi no longer had his original eyes (which Sasuke took it)? Does this mean that Edo Tensei can also restore certain aspects of a ninja even after death? "
1121,Since when Gowther become one of Ten Commandments?,"I know that Gowther is one of Seven Deadly Sins, but in later manga, it is revealed that he also one of Ten Commandments.  So, since when he is become one of them? Did he join Ten Commandments after or before he join in Seven Deadly Sins? "
1122,Why doesn't Nehushtan require its wielder to sing?,"When Chris purges Nehushtan and dons Ichii-bal during her fight against Hibiki in episode 7 of the first season, she complains about how she has to start singing now. And indeed, Ichii-bal, like Ame-no-Habakiri and Gungnir, generally requires the wielder to sing while transformed (because of, like, phonic gain, or something?).   However, neither Chris nor Finé sing when they wield Nehushtan (thereby depriving us of what would surely have been a glorious Sawashiro Miyuki battle song).   Why is that? Why doesn't Nehushtan require its wielder to sing? "
1123,Does Asuna speak English?,"In episode 5 of the English sub of Sword Art Online: Alicization, Asuna infiltrates the Ocean Turtle facility disguised as Mayumi Reynolds.   When she arrives at the facility, she says ""nice to meet you"" to the guard who greets her in English. Further in, when another guard asks her to remove her sunglasses and confirm her identity, she replies ""sure"" in English.  Does Asuna have any significant English speaking ability? Or did she simply learn a few words in order to solidify her disguise?  "
1124,"What do people eat, if not rice?","Episode 7 of Koutetsujou no Kabaneri brings up the point that nobody in Japan eats rice anymore, since the rice paddies are outside the stations, and hence overrun by the kabane.   This makes a lot of sense, and is a splendid bit of worldbuilding. But if they can't grow rice, what staple food(s) do they grow and eat instead?     Out of all the common staple foods currently eaten, it seems that potatoes (or sweet potatoes) can provide the most calories-per-unit-area, clocking in at about 4-5 times as much as rice. But at just 4-5 times rice's calorie/area yield, they'd have to have lost no more than 75-80% of their arable land to maintain the same calorie output. Judging from the sizes of the stations we've seen, it doesn't seem plausible that they still have that much arable land - we see the railforts driving through days of outside-station land between stations.  Perhaps the resolution here is that Japan's population has dipped so precipitously in the face of the kabane menace that the meager amount of land enclosed by the stations does suffice to grow enough of some other staple crop to feed the people? "
1125,Is Sakura's gesture a dead giveaway that she lied about remembering the transfer student?,"After a failed attempt at recalling the name of a childhood acquaintance, Miho helpfully guided Sakura to look at the blackboard where the teacher had the name of the transfer student written down. Sakura continued to feign remembering the guy, but then the scene panned down to reveal that Sakura kept one hand off the table while Miho remarked about Sakura being a liar.    How could Miho tell that Sakura was lying till the end? Was it the timid hand gesture or something she said? "
1126,Why did Yoshihiro Togashi recycle designs from Yu Yu Hakusho for his characters in Hunter x Hunter?,"  Although Gon doesn't look similar by facial design, he is similar to the green schemes that Yusuke has, and his hair color is similar.    Killua is similar to Hiei's demeanor.    Both Kurapika and Kurama have androgynous appearances    Personalities are similar. "
1127,"Can someone explain about the attendance record in ""Another""","In 1996, Mami Asakura was the extra student. She was also a student of 1993 (and she died that year). When she joins Yomiyama Junior High, Her name from the 1993 record disappears and everyone who knew her, loses their memory about her. After she disappeared, her name from 1996 record gets erased and it reappears in the 1993 record.  Am I correct?  Also, will her friends remember that she was in 1993?  How did chibiki identify that Mami Asakura was the deceased if a person's memories are altered? "
1128,Leaf Shinobi vest colours,"I am curious to know why some leaf shinobi's vest colours are green and some are dark green. For example, Shikaku wears a dark green vest and Kakashi wears green. Are dark green vests considered elite shinobi? Wouldn't Kakashi be considered elite? Does it signify something about that particular shinobi?  Thanks "
1129,"Do Byakugans also posses ""hidden"" ocular powers?","After Momoshiki was defeated by Boruto, Momoshiki appeared to him in the anime (Episode 65, 18:37) and told Boruto; ""You cannot see through your own destiny, But I can see your destiny very clearly""; as he said this, he started using his Byakugan.   The phrasing is very different in the manga.   Is this power to see into the future a hidden ocular ability of all Byakugan users? (more like the way all Mangekyous have special traits across the different Uchihas) Or was Momoshiki just trying make his words seem legit by ""claiming his Byakugan had such an ability"".     Also, when he told Boruto that ""those blue eyes will eventually take everything from you!"" was it metaphorically? (like some sort of japanese saying/ figure of speech) or did he mean Borutos Jogan? I've been thinking about it for a while now and it doesn't really add up.  "
1130,What is the purpose of having this face in the subtitles/lyrics?,"During the first verse in the second opening to Hayate no Gotoku (Shichitenhakki Shijou Shugi! by KOTOKO), this face (O_O;) appears in each version of the subtitles;  the translated, romanised and original Japanese versions.  Additionally, the face is also included on various lyrics sites such as here and here.  Why is this? I've never seen emoticons or unicode faces in any other subtitles, and I don't see how it adds to the song at all. I know this is a series that doesn't take itself too seriously, but is there any explanation as to why this is here?   "
1131,Why aren't Meow and Dandy zombies anymore?,"In episode 4 of Space Dandy, Meow, Dandy, and many other people become zombies, after Meow gets bitten by an infected alien. If I'm not mistaken, there's no cure for being a zombie -- all the advice Dandy and Meow get is to change their outlook by eating yoghurt instead of meat and sunbathing, so that they are fermenting instead of rotting. (Whether this logic about zombie biology is true is probably best left to another question.) This reaches the point where since life insurance companies are losing a lot of money to zombies cashing out on their policies, they try in vain to hunt down these zombies (but fail and eventually also become zombies).  Now, everything looks fine in the next episode: Meow, Dandy, and the massive swathes of the population that were zombies in episode 4 are now alive again. Why is this the case? Does Space Dandy largely simply consist of non-cohesive ""filler"" segments that don't necessarily have to follow each other? Or did some cure for zombification come up?  I haven't read the manga, so perhaps something comes up there. "
1132,"Who is the strongest fusion, Gogeta super saiyan blue or Vegito super saiyan blue?","Dragon Ball Super Broly shows,      Gogeta defeating Broly   About Broly it is said      He might be stronger than Beerus    If you consider these facts alone you could think Gogeta is stronger than Vegito but, of course, you can think Goku and Vegeta got stronger since before the tournament of power to the time they fought Broly. How about other clues in the series, movies, manga, official guides about Vegito and Gogeta's strenght? Who is the strongest fusion, Gogeta super saiyan blue or Vegito super saiyan blue? "
1133,How does Erza get her armor and weapons ready for Requip?,"In Fairy Tail, Erza can use Requip, but I wanna know how she gets her weapons and armor there in the first place? Her ability in Fairy Tail is not to put and leave items there, it's only for switching, so how did she place all her weapons and armor there in the first place? "
1134,"Why are ""traps"" and ""genderbending"" so common in anime and manga compared to Western media?","It seems to me that anime and manga has tropes like ""traps"" and even characters that change gender quite frequently, especially in comparison to Western series, which seem to have characters more consistently within ""the binary."" In particular, I'm thinking of shows like Ranma 1/2, Maria Holic, Ouran High School Host Club.  I am under the impression that Japanese culture is quite conservative, so this doesn't make much sense to me. I would expect a conservative culture to create series that aren't so liberal with gender related themes.  Is there a reason for this? Or am I somehow biased? Are there strong counterexamples to my observation? "
1135,What happened to the tailed beasts?,"This is another one of the questions that kishimoto sensei never actually addressed after the end of the series. It could be natural that they were left alone in forests , but is there any concrete evidence suggesting the same .  What happened to the bijuu's? Are they left alone in the forest or was there equal distribution amongst villages to leverage equal power? If yes , do we know about the existences of jinchuriki's post-naruto other than killer bee and naruto ? "
1136,Garmillans only sometimes speak alien language,"From time to time, we see Garmillans speak but sometimes in their alien language and sometimes in Japanese. Is this just to add flavor (and we should assume it is always the Garmillas language which is spoken)? Or does this dual dub have some setting/plot significance? "
1137,How did Waver appear in Iskandar's reality marble?,"In the final episode of Ufotable's adaptation of Fate/Stay Night, we were shown a glimpse of what Waver looks like years after the events of Fate/Zero:    In Fate/Zero, we are shown that Iskandar's reality marble contains all of his comrades from the past. One of the soldiers who appeared in his army looks very similar to Waver:    So is that really Waver? If so, how did he appear in Iskandar's reality marble? "
1138,Who is the guy that Shirou passes in the Clock Tower that he mentions he recognizes?,"  In the Epilogue episode of UBW, who is the guy that Shirou passes in the Clock Tower that he mentions he recognizes? Is his appearance significant in anyway? Like Luvia's or Waver's appearance (as El-Melloi II)?  "
1139,"Why is Midori referred to as green-skinned, when she's not that green?","During the anime and the manga, the author refers to Midori as green-skinned, in fact, even her name means green. But she doesn't look obviously green:    I would expect a name like Aoi instead if there was some leeway - [website]In the manga there is a panel with RGB codes, I thought I'd color her in just to make sure it wasn't an anime adaption problem &amp; I removed the shading:     Midori's skin is hex value #85D8D0 or RGB (133,216,208). The green component of her skin is only 8 units larger than the blue component. Thus, even without my subjectiveness, she can't be considered green-skinned. Several color-focused websites classify the color as Cyan, not a shade of green.  Is there some reason for this - maybe based in language? Why didn't they just say she was cyan / aqua / turqoise? or even, blue? "
1140,Is it known if Rimuru's magicule supply is growing rapidly?,"Rimuru, the protagonist of That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime, has powerful magical abilities.  In that world, ""magicules"" are basically particles of mana and are the fuel for magic.  In two episodes we see him depleting magicules to below his minumum reserve point, at which point he shuts down for three days.  When he awakens, his supply is fully restored.      In episode 3 he names about 100 goblins and, lastly, the direwolf alpha.  (Later we learn that naming the alpha (Ranga) allowed the name to be shared by the entire pack.) Then he shuts down due to insufficient magicules.  In episode 6 he names about 500 more goblins before shutting down.  Even if naming Ranga counted as 100 named wolves, that was still only 200 total beings named the first time.   Could he actually store about 2.5 times more magicules after about 10 days?  That is the simplest explanation for the greater feat.  If so, is it known if his magicule storage continues to grow at that kind of fast pace?  A second possibility is that, in the first instance, simultaneously affecting a whole pack acted as sort of a short circuit on magicule usage.  Doing it one at a time might have used much less total. This case would not require the kind of magicule storage growth seen in the first.  A third possibility is that as he learns to use his abilities, he gets more efficient in using them.  So the second time he could accomplish a lot more with the same amount of magicules.  A fourth possibility is that I'm way overthinking this... "
1141,"Which of the character quirks are based on real life, and which are purely fictional?","In the Kancolle anime (and presumably the game as well), several characters have little quirks that make them more memorable and unique. Some of these appear to be based on the factual history of the warships they resemble, but others I'm not so sure on.  For example, the character Kongou often uses English phrases sporadically in her sentences, and in her introduction to Fubuki she mentions she was ""born in England [and] raised in Japan"". The real life battleship that was the first of the Kongou class was indeed originally constructed in England, which makes me believe that the quirks of this character are a reference to the history of the warship.  So, which of the following are jokes based on fact, and which are simply made up, or carried over from the browser game?   Yuudachi's 'Poi' Shimakaze's speed Shimakaze having 3 'Rensouhou-chans' rather than turrets attached to her body like the other girls Sendai's love of night battles Naka's claim of being the one idol of the fleet Akagi's (and Yamato's) huge appetite Fubuki being unable to sail properly at the anime's beginning Akatsuki's obsession with being 'ladylike', Ikazuchi's phrases about relying on her, Hibiki's 'khorosho', and Inazuma's 'nano desu' Atago's 'pan paka pa~n' (ta-da!) The poor relationship between carrier groups 1 and 5 All sister ships have a close relationship, but is the especially close relationship between Kitakami and Ooichi significant? Ashigara and the other Myoukou class ships taking up positions as teachers in the fleet   I've tried to include links to evidence for most of them. If I've missed any major historical references made in the anime, please mention those in an answer as well. "
1142,Can the Kai earings(Potara Earings) be used again and again to keep fusing individuals?,"Supreme Kai and Kibito fused using the Kai Earrings. Can now Kibito Kai use the earrings again to fuse with another?  I searched for this and found no creditable source.  I know for a fact that the ear rings still work, since they were offered by Kibito Kai to Goku and Vegeta before the battle against Kid Buu. However they destroyed it. So could Kibito Kai use it to fuse again?  Edit: Accepted answer has added a somewhat relevant frame. It doesn't make it explicit but seems to indicate that fused individuals such as Elder kai, Kibito Kai and Vegeto can no longer fuse again. "
1143,"Does Nausicaä wear underpants, and if not, what outside-universe reason is there?","I haven't watched all of it yet, but it seems as if Nausicaä isn't wearing underpants in the anime version. Either that, or she's wearing tight-fitting slacks that are of a colour close to skin tone. Is she wearing underpants?  If she isn't wearing underpants, what is the outside-universe reason for not doing so? Within-universe, it seems to make sense: a lot of the clothing worn is very simple clothing, as if it were hand-made. However, while other Ghibli works I've come across seem moderately relaxed with regards to clothing (you can briefly see totally innocent underwear in Kiki's delivery service, and there's a joking suggestion of nude portraiture) it seems a little surprising. Is a bias against prudishness a shared theme of Ghibli, along with a love of flying and a love of nature?  This FAQ (cited by Wikipedia) denies that any scenes were cut because of nudity, and states that the impression she doesn't wear underpants were because of poor quality videotape fansubs, saying that watching the DVD would clear it up - but I was watching the DVD to start off with. It also has some cover art from a manga version (not the anime) with white-coloured slacks. "
1144,What is the process of making vivre card?,"From One Piece wikia for Vivre card     Vivre Cards, also known as the ""paper of life"" (命の紙 Inochi no Kami), are a special form of paper made in the New World. A Vivre Card is made from part of a person’s fingernail which is then made into paper.      Sabo made one. He made it himself or gave someone to make it.

1145,"Does ""Those Who Hunt Elves"" have a definitive ending?","I know the manga has ended already, and several years after the 2 seasons of anime which didn't have a definitive ending.      The second season ended with the attempt to send them back to Japan after all of the spell fragments were collected, but both failed and the fragments were scattered again.   Was there a definitive ending in the manga? Or more specifically:      Did they get sent back to Japan or was the final attempt the last possible one? Or is it like the ending of the anime where they just have to continue to do it all over and over again?  "
1146,Will Naruto have a Kid?,"In Naruto movie 4, during the ending scene      The priestess says that she needs to give her powers to the next priestess. And asks Naruto's help with this matter. But what did she mean by that? Did she mean it in the context ""Make a new priestess with me?"" or more in the context ""Once the time comes can you help me transfer my powers?"".    Video of the scene I'm referring "
1147,"Who is the ""dinosaur guy with the nasty attitude""?","It has been a while, so I can't seem to remember, but who is Beerus referring to, when he is talking about ""that dinosaur guy with the nasty attitude"" that he asked to destroy Earth?   "
1148,What was Doi really thinking about Shuichi?,"In the end of episode 11 when Shuichi walks home from school with Doi again, Shuichi tells that he hates Doi and leaves alone. Doi just stands there for a moment looking shocked and then angrily kicks the fence shouting ""Damn!""  There isn't much up until then to definitely say what kind of guy Doi is, but it's known that he once read Shuichi's diary note out loud to someone once (not sure exactly when and to whom), for which Shuichi might hold a grudge against him.  But the thing I'm curious about is why Doi was so emotional about that fence kicking after Shuichi said he hates him. I mean what did he expect if he really was bullying him? Or if he didn't do it to make fun of Shuichi then what, did he want to be friends with him and he just got very upset that Shuichi hated him for what he's done?   Also from episode 12:   Apparently, Shuichi can't tell either way too. "
1149,What are the responsibilities of key staff members in an anime production?,"With any given series, there's a lot of names and titles being thrown around in the opening and closing credits.  What are the typical key roles (E.g., art director, color-setters (iro shitei), producer, director, series coordinator) and their primary responsibilities? Are there also any roles or departments exclusive or work differently in anime production than in traditional or western animation? "
1150,What are the steps involved in producing an anime?,"I had a few ideas on how an animations are produced documentaries of western animation, but I was curious of how the process works in Japanese animation.  What are the typical order and steps undertaken by a studio or committee in producing an anime? Do any prominent studios do things differently? "
1151,Where can I get listings of convention locations and dates?,"My interest in anime and manga is largely a solitary pursuit that consists of me watching copious amounts of animated TV shows and answering questions on this site -- I don't really collect merchandise much or go to conventions . However, in the past, I've missed at least one convention that I would have liked to go to, on account of the fact that someone who had been involved with a few series I really like spoke there.  One problem, in addition to my lack of interest in looking through guest speaker lists early enough, is probably simply that I don't really know where I can learn about ongoing conventions. I might know of some small ""convention"" run by the anime club of a school I might be affiliated with, and, along with that, of one much larger convention in the area. However, I only know of these via word-of-mouth, and I pretty much do not know of the approximate times of any other conventions near areas I've lived in. Moreover, if I travel, it'd be nice to be able to have some approximate idea as to whether there are any conventions in the area, so I can see if I might be interested in going.  With this in mind, are there any websites that list major conventions by location and dates? (Bonus points: are there any particular websites that do not just do so for, say, the US?) "
1152,What do vampires have to do with the phase of the moon?,I've seen a few animes that linked a vampire's powers to the phase of the moon. Where does this idea come from?  Are there actual Japanese myths about vampires that this stems from? Or something odd that got mixed in when the Western myth was translated into Japanese? Something else? 
1153,"Why did Lelouch call it the ""United States of Japan""?","Lelouch declared the creation of the ""United States of Japan"". But why did he add ""United States""? Japan is not called this in the real world, nor in the series before this moment. Why did he have this change of mind?  I am in the middle of R2 but I will not mind spoilers from manga or further episode if necessary. "
1154,Who was Archer?,"Who was Rin's servant Archer in Fate Stay Night?  In the anime, it shows no reference to who he is or how he became a heroic spirit.  But in the Manga, it only shows how he became a heroic spirit.  The Holy Grail takes the soul or spirit from people of legends and myths.  So who was Archer in Fate Stay Night?   Only answer from Fate Stay Night, anime or manga.  It would get confusing if somebody gives an answer that is true from a different universe or timeline.  "
1155,How strong are the Marine Admirals?,Since the Navy mainly determines power through bounty.  They seem strong but Whitebeard was able to fight all three admirals at one.  Also the Commanders of Whitebeard were on par with the Admirals. So how strong are the Admirals?  How much bounty would they get if they got one? 
1156,Why does Obito look like an adult during the Kyuubi attack on Konoha?,"In the series, it is stated that Kakashi was 26 when he became the leader of Naruto's squad. So following that, he was 14 when the Kyuubi attacked the village. Seeing that Obito was the same age as Kakashi, he should be 14 but he didn't look like it. How old was Obito at that time? It shows him as an grown up, adult man. Is this because of Zetsu covering him or is he just older than Kakashi?  This is not a question directly about the age of Obito but also why he looked older. In my understanding Kakashi and Obito are about the same age. I don't care when Kakashi became a Jounin because that is not relevant to this question. "
1157,What determines Remuneration in Darker than Black?,What determines the nature of remuneration in Darker than Black?  Is it something ironic?  Similar to one of the contractors smoking even though he hates the thought of smoking.  Or is it some other way? 
1158,How does one become a Contractor?,How are Contractors made in Darker than Black?  Do you have to be born with the powers?  Or do you have to make contact with a spirit and make a contract with it? 
1159,About the industry: How much does it cost to license a manga outside of Japan?,"Today I'd like to know what kind of proposition one has to make to a Japanese publisher to have a go at distributing a title in a certain country (outside of Japan).  This article told me how things work in the industry and I pretty much understand that to get a deal, you need sales forecasts, a  distribution channel, a printer … ready to work for you. And you need to be able to tell the Japanese publisher how much he’s going to make throughout the coming months by trusting you to distribute his manga.  What I can’t seem to find though, is what a serious or standardized proposition in the industry is. I mean, what are the rules?! Are there rules stating that no matter what, a certain percentage of your margins should go to the Japanese publisher? Are there predefined sales volumes under which you won’t get a deal? Has anyone here actually seen such a contract? Where can one get his/her hands on one? What about digital distribution?  If any of you can point me in the right direction, tell me who I should ask this to, or highlight existing documentation, I would be absolutely delighted. "
1160,What determines the Abilities of a Contractor?,What determines the abilities of a Contractor?  In the anime two contractors have the same ability.  Both dealing having the powers of electricity.  So does this mean that there can many contractors with the same ability? 
1161,How do souls age in Soul Society?,"How do souls age in Soul Society?        People cannot die of old age resulting in the Captain Commander keeping his position for a thousand years.   There are some souls who look like kids and some who are adults.  In the manga, the makers flashbacked into the past of the Captian Commander showing that he had black hair instead of looking like what he was then.  Also, when Ichigo left the Precipice World he aged what looked like a couple years.  So how do souls age in Bleach? "
1162,Why does Zero have such a strong reaction to Shizuka Hio's voice?,"In Episode 12 of the Vampire Knight anime series, Zero encounters Shizuku Hio, the woman who turned him into a vampire. Even before she tries to compel him, he is shown as experiencing a strong physical reaction to her voice. It is clear that he already knew that she was there, so he shouldn't have been surprised to hear her.   Why does he have that reaction? Does her voice have a compulsion before she tries to actively compel him? Is it due to some sort of bond he has with her? Or is there another reason? "
1163,How did emigrants survive outside in Ergo Proxy?,"In episode 21, it was shown that Romdeau was in a state of disarray. Many opted to leave the city instead of staying inside. However, what I noticed is that emigrants seem to be able to leave their home cities without gas masks or any protective gear. The same applied to Vincent and emigrants from Mosk during one of his flashback, at least from what I can remember. They weren't inside a vehicle and they seem to have to walk to where they needed to go to.  Of course, it's possible that they were vaccinated before going outside, although it seems unlikely given the state of Romdeau during this time and that the city would try to keep them from going outside no matter what. Yet, Vincent was struck by disease after he went outside through the vent. Although he did survived, he either should have been immune from the conditions in the outside world, he actually wasn't exposed during his travel from Mosk to Romdeau, the vaccines keeping them healthy are temporary, or something else.   So how did emigrants survive outside without succumbing to disease? Have I missed anything? "
1164,Why isn't Gildarts one of the Ten Wizard Saints?,"He clearly is powerful. Makarov even said that Jura's (One of the 10 Wizard Saints) power was close to Gildarts, which means that Gildarts is more powerful than Jura.  So why isn't he a wizard saint?  Does he have to do something magnificent?  Or is he just not popular enough? "
1165,"How does Shingo's use of ""osu"" in this particular dialogue differ from its use elsewhere?","In the manga Osu!! Karatebu the word ""osu"" is used quite frequently, and from context I have so far assumed that it is a way for the junior members of the karate club to respond to their seniors in a general ""yes, sir"" way. However, I recently came across this panel which presents a quite different take on the word:    What is the significance of Shingo's particular dialogue about ""osu?"" Is it a typical philosophy of the character, karate, or a mix of the two? Why is it so different from how it is used elsewhere in the manga? "
1166,What other Beaters were there in Sword Art Online?,"In Episode 8 - Black and White Sword Dance, after Kirito got Asuna to agree to cook the Ragout Rabbit, Asuna dismissed Kuradeel and got refused:     Kuradeel: I can not leave you alone with a shady character like this   Asuna: While I can't say anything about his shadiness, he is actually quite strong. In fact, he's 10 levels above you, Kuradeel.   Kuradeel: Are you implying that I am somehow inferior to him? Wait, don't tell me he is one of those Beaters.   In Episode 2 - Beater, after beating Illfang the Kobold Lord, Kirito was discovered as a Beta player. Reflecting on Diavel's request, Kirito takes an antagonist stance and lies about how far he had progressed during the beta of SAO:     Kirito: I made it to floors not even the other Beta players could reach.   Kibaou: Then that makes you worse than a Beta, YOU A GODDAMN FILTHY CHEATER.   Background Player: He's a Beater!   Kirito: Beater huh? Yeah, I like the sound of that.   I was under the impression that Kirito was the only ""Beater"". However, Kuradeel says one of those Beaters, which implies that there are more as apart from him. Using the plural form, Kuradeel is grouping Kirito with others.  So I am wondering, were there any other Beaters in SAO? If there were, do we know who they were? "
1167,How does Naruto's right arm work?,"Spoiler alert for those who haven't finished the manga or the anime      After the Naruto and Sasuke fight (in Naruto volume 72: Uzumaki Naruto chapters 694-698), both of them lost one of their arms above the elbow.  After a while, Naruto got a fake arm (I think Sasuke didn't) which was wrapped in bandages (it was shown in the rest of the mangas, The Last: Naruto the Movie, and Boruto: Naruto the Movie).     It was shown in the movies and in the manga that his arm can move and act like his arm used to before he lost it, so he can use it for eating, writing, carrying things, holding things, waving hand signs, releasing jutsus, etc.. But how does it work? I know it was created by Tsunade, and since she's an excellent medical ninja she could have found a way or something, but was it ever mentioned of how it worked or anything? I mean, I know the Naruto Universe evolved over time and stuff, so I guess they found a way to create body part that works like they used to. "
1168,What are Mori and Honey doing?,"In the episode The Sun, The Sea and the Host Club. Honey-senpai and Mori-senpai are doing something with a couple of the girls in the background while Haruhi is under the umbrella complaining about the situation.  What is it that they are doing, and why does Haruhi act the way she does when she sees it? Does it have something to do with the class divide between her and the rest of the host club? "
1169,Why can Devil Fruit users use their abilities while wet?,"My understanding was that the sea is supposed to weaken devil fruit users and rob them of their powers. The One Piece Wikia elaborated:      Devil Fruit users are susceptible to all types of water, not just seawater. This includes the white sea surrounding Skypiea. [Oda] elaborated on this, saying that ""moving"" water, like rain or waves, does not weaken Devil Fruit users, while standing water does.   The Wikia also states the users cannot use their powers while submerged.     Even if a part of the user is submerged, they cannot use their Devil Fruit powers, no matter how much or how little is submerged. However, if the user's body has been permanently altered by the fruit, then the user's ability can be manipulated by outside sources (eg Luffy's neck was stretched while submerged at Arlong Park).   My questions:   How did Ajoki freeze the ocean?    May I emphasize he submerged his hand in the sea to use Ice Age? How did Luffy fight Crocodile while wet at Marine Ford?    He was dripping wet after having fallen into the sea. Does the water not weaken him since he was now submerged? I assumed since sea stone worked just by touching it and it has the same effect as the ocean, then by having part of the ocean ""touch"" him would drain his power.   Are these just plot holes or am I missing something? "
1170,What is the meaning behind dark works often taking place at midnight?,"A recurring story element that I've noticed is the accessibility of certain evil/dark devices at midnight.  A few examples:   In the third episode of Sailor Moon, girls listen to a midnight radio show that is hosted by the antagonists illegally. Girls that wrote into the show and are read on air receive a brooch which steals their energy.  In Persona, there is a midnight channel which broadcasts the shadow of the person that is currently missing. In Jigoku Shoujo, there is a website that is only accessible at midnight, which will allow the user with a grudge to send someone to hell.    Why do all three of these anime use midnight as a time for evil? What is special about midnight that sets it apart from any other time? "
1171,Does the Bleach anime stick to the manga's plot?,Does the anime series of Bleach stick to the manga's plot? Or is it like the original Fullmetal Alchemist series where the anime is its own thing and doesn't follow the story of the manga? 
1172,Why exactly is Saitama a hero?,"Saitama, who trained for three years only doing 100 push-ups, 100 squats, 100 sit ups, and ran 10 kilometers every day, became a ""superhero for fun"", but what does he mean by that.  Is he really only doing it ""for fun"" or did he have motives but then forgot? Because normally a hero does it for a reason like to protect the ones they love, to defeat all evil, to prove that their strong, to protect something like humankind, etc.. Or is he really just doing it ""for fun"" because he's bored. Or is there actually a deep meaning for those words? "
1173,Why did Jeremiah Gottwald use his Geass on Nunnally?,"In Code Geass R2, on episode 49, when Lelouch went to Nunnally      who was the holding F.L.E.I.J.A. switch, to confront her and to give to him the switch, it was revealed that she has now regained her sight which she lost because of his father, Charles Vi Britannia's geass. The only existing geass who can possibly cancel out that geass was the Geass Canceller. And Jeremiah Gottwald has that geass. On the previous episode, Nunally has fallen from her wheelchair and someone helped her. So it can be assumed (though it was not really stated or shown) that Jeremiah was the one who helped her then and canceled out the geass Charles used on her, thus having her regain her sight again.   My question is, why would Jeremiah      use his geass on Nunnally? (Assuming that he really was the reason why Nunnally regained her sight again.)    Was it out of pity? Since he      has vowed his loyalty to Lelouch,    did he feel the need to help Lelouch's sister, knowing that she is very important to him?  Or was it included in Lelouch's plan? If it is, what will it gain him?   Or Lelouch purposely asked Jeremiah to do it for him, again, for his sister's sake?  Or it was just a random act for Jeremiah just for the purpose of having his geass used?   I just need some clarifications on this part. Maybe I overlooked something or misunderstood something, but any clarifications would do. Thanks. "
1174,Why does Monthly Girls' Nozaki-kun get double-wide panels?,"In most 4koma manga, the panels are about half as wide as the page, and there are two strips of four panels on each page. Take K-On as an example:    However, Monthly Girls' Nozaki-kun has panels that are about as wide as two of K-On's panels, and each page only has one strip:    Is there any particular reason for this? Is it the magazine it was published in? Is it a shoujo vs. shounen thing? Is it just a random whim of the author? "
1175,Did Vegeta want to make Gohan stronger?,"  When Vegeta found Gohan on Namek, he told him:     . . . Too bad, because you see, we are the last of the Saiyans, that means we have to look out for one another, understand? It's like... like the three of us are brothers...   Then, Vegeta kicks Gohan in the stomach. At that moment he had a big grudge against Goku and could've easily killed Gohan out of anger. Instead, the kick that he gave him was nonlethal.  Now I am wondering if there was some truth in Vegeta's words. As he already explained many times, the more of a beating a Sayian takes the stronger that Sayian becomes. Did he really want to help Gohan become stronger by kicking him? "
1176,Where can I hear more music by Dragon Ball composer Shunsuke Kikuchi?,"I am a big fan of Shunsuke Kikuchi, the composer of the BGM (background music) for the Dragon Ball animes such as this one:   [website]While I can only usually find his music for Dragon Ball online like YouTube, etc, I am wondering if some of his other works can be listened to online. "
1177,Where in the timeline of SAO did the battle vs. Laughing Coffin occur?,"In episode of 6 of Sword Art Online (season 2), Kirito reveals that during the events of SAO, he and the front-liners confronted the Laughing Coffin guild at their headquarters.  The result was that 20+ members of Laughing Coffin were killed along with 10+ of their own. We also learned that Kirito killed a total of 3 people during the events of SAO. (2 during this battle)     But when exactly did this battle happen? This scene is completely absent from the first season. Did this battle happen before or after Kirito joined Knights of the Blood?  Chronologically, between what episodes from season 1 did this battle happen? "
1178,What can energybending do?,"Aside from taking away someone's bending, as seen against Firelord Ozai, is there anything more to the energybending?  Do we know any details on the technique other than what was told in the series itself? "
1179,Where can we find dialogues related to anime?,"I remember that the actual way that I learned to be fluent in English were by watching a lot of English movies. Since, I stepped foot on Japanese anime and I wanted to learn Japanese in the same way. Since English was a compulsory subject I could compare and learn, but Japanese is not. How I learned English was memorizing the fun dialogues and I want to do the same for Japanese. Since Japanese is not so easy to pick up and having Kanji to search for is definitely informative.   How can we get the subtitles for a specific anime? If it were lyrics it would've been easy, but I didn't find any sites that would give subtitles of the dialogues of anime. Are there any? If not, what can be done so that we can learn dialogues of the anime, since songs and dialogues are definitely easier to memorize. "
1180,Exactly when did Madara come back to life after his defeat by Hashirama?,"I know that Madara used Transcription Seal: Izanagi to fake his death and came back to life after a while. What was the trigger for this jutsu (Izanagi)? If it was his death, immediately he would've come back to life after death and Hashirama would've noticed it.   It is mentioned that he had used this jutsu on his own right eye. How come a dead person's eye is a trigger for his own revival? As I understand, there won't be any movement/thought from a dead person. "
1181,Why is (action-adventure) anime so focused on teenagers?,"I've been a fan of anime since Star Blazers in my childhood, but... I wonder about an overused cliche in anime action-adventure series: teenage prodigy heroes.  For example, the most popular action-based anime (as opposed to comedy or relationship-based) currently on Netflix and Hulu (as well as StackExchange tag frequency): Attack on Titan, Black Butler, Bleach, Death Note, Fairy Tail, Fullmetal Alchemist, Knights of Sidonia, Naruto, One Piece, Sword Art Online. All of them feature unusually capable teens as the lead protagonists. Adults are supporting characters, or entirely absent.  Certainly there are exceptions (Samurai Champloo, etc), and this trope is also seen in the US (e.g. Adventure Time, Avatar, Young Justice, etc) but it's a matter of degree. Non-child heroes are not a rarity in western animation (Avengers, Batman, Tranformers, etc).  Is this a real thing in Japanese culture, and if so what does it mean? Or is it just a USA-based artifact of marketing (i.e. this particular subgenre is actively emphasized for translation) or audience (i.e. non-child anime is just as common but has less active fans)? "
1182,How do familiars get created?,"   After eating a few humans ― approximately four or five according to   Kyoko in episode 5 ― they will grow into witches themselves.        familiars are ""projections of the magical girl's heart before she became a witch"".   When a magical girl falls into despair, her soul gem turns into a grief seed, which makes her a witch. What does ""projections of the magical girl's heart"" mean? Does it mean a magical girl can become more than one witch? Also, how does this affect the universal entropy? "
1183,Why does every major bad guy end up being a good guy later?,"It feels like the common thread is ""I'm a major bad guy in Naruto, I lose/die, then I have a change of heart and want to help Naruto once bigger baddy shows up"". When does a bad guy remain a bad guy? (e.g. - Zabuza, Gaara, Itachi, Nagato, Orochimaru, Kabuto, Sasuke, Obito, and the demon fox who was supposed to be the incarnation of the world's Malice/Hatred).   Even Madara seems poised now for a return as a good guy since there's a bigger threat and he originally had good intentions when he was a kid.    Is there a reason for this? Why aren't the bad guys more angry that they lost, and join up with new bad guy? Seems like they give up really easily and have no commitment to their goals. "
1184,"Why is there a war in ""Fireball"" and ""Fireball Charming""?","I know that there isn't any story in the series, but they do sometimes get into details about the setting (Merkur Era 48,650-48,794). Was there any reason given for the ongoing (very long) war with humanity that is constantly raging outside the manor? Or anything that can be gleaned from interviews with writer/director Wataru Arakawa? "
1185,How did Kirito find out Zekken's secret?,"What did Kirito whisper during his fight with Zekken before which he was  defeated? In episode 20, Asuna asked Zekken (Yuuki) about this and she replied that Kirito had ""figured out [her] secret"".  What was the secret? "
1186,What differentiates manga from other comics?,"What is a characteristic attribute relating to the visual aspect for a manga, differential to western comics like from DC or Marvel? For example the way they draw the eyes. In mangas they are much more complex and they look not even real.    Are there other clear attributes like that? And why is it common to draw them like ""unreal"" persons in Japan? "
1187,What was the purpose behind the personification of certain elements in The Wind Rises?,"In The Wind Rises, certain elements of the story are personified. From the beginning, we see an earthquake and fire, both of which are given very humanlike sounds, as well as being shown very artisicially (like the ground moving in waves instead of just shaking). Later, the planes in the movie are personified as well, their components and demonstrations being given very humanesque and biological sounds.    As Jiro and Honjo look around a plane in flight, an engine makes very gurgly sounds which are distinctly biological and not mechanical. Other planes do this as well, even in a scene which shows one of Jiro's designs as a conceptualization.  Obviously, the movie is very plane-centric and so the personification of the planes makes sense (to bring them to life). However, these other lifelike elements did not seem to fit into the more serious setting of this movie, compared to a movie like Ponyo.  What is the purpose of bringing these elements ""to life"" in The Wind Rises? And why was it these elements that were chosen? "
1188,Why does Team Rocket always try to catch Pikachu?,"Very surprised this question has not been asked yet.  In almost every single episode, at least from the first season all the way through to the Unova region, Team Rocket is trying to catch Pikachu to give him to Giovanni. Why do they do this? They often cite reasoning that this Pikachu is special somehow, but is that actually true? Nobody else really talks about how awesome Pikachu is, and he certainly doesn't seem to win very often.  I'm looking for any kind of answer, in-universe, out-of-universe, thematic, humourous, etc.  I have a theory I will post below but wonder if this community could come up with a better answer. "
1189,Why did Sakata Gintoki need to go to the future?,"In Gintama the Movie: Be Forever Yorozuya (Yorozuya yo Eien Nare), why did Gin need to go to the future first?   He was infected by the White Plague during the Joui war, so why did the future Gin call him to the future to kill the plagued future Gin instead of just sending him to the past and preventing the plague from spreading in the first place? "
1190,"Is there any explanation for ""Tequila"" in the Kuragehime eyecatch?","Kuragehime has my favorite eyecatch of all the anime I've seen:  Kuragehime Eyecatch  It's very amusing, but the ""tequila"" is pretty irrelevant to the show. Tequila isn't in any way relevant to the plot. It seems to be just a random word that they chose to use.  Is there any explanation for why they say ""tequila"" in the eyecatch, or is it just a random non sequitur for comedic effect? "
1191,What is Kaworu implying at the end of RoE: 1.01?,"I've rewatched Rebuild of Evangelion: 1.01: You can (not) advance, and something struck me. At the very end (so spoiler):     Kaworu is on the moon, looking at Shinji, and say ""You're the third again, Shinji""   Is the ""again"" a sign that what happened in NGE/EoE in the same continuity? Or does it link with RoE 3/4 (which I've still to see)? "
1192,"What is the reference being made by saying ""I did this at a serious seminar once""?","In Osananajimi wa Daitouryou, there is a comedy scene between the main character, Hondo Jun'ichirou, and Ell. The conversation goes like this:     Ell: A small test. It is a simple CPU inspection. I know.      Ell earnestly nodded, then pulled a mechanical pencil out from her pen case and faced the desk. She then muttered a single sentence.      Ell: Ah, I did this at a serious seminar once.      Jun'ichirou: What are you blurting out all of a sudden!?      Ell: It is a simulation. I heard that your test score will go up if you announce it in this manner.      Jun'ichirou: Where are you getting that information from...?      Ell: From 7ch.   This is a screenshot of the same scene in Japanese for reference purpose:    What is the reference being made when Ell said ""I did this at a serious seminar once""? "
1193,would devil fruit users be affected in fresh water,"The sea stone, which is the weakness of devil fruit users, was said to have the same power as the ocean, and it was said that the sea rejected the devil fruit users. I understand that devil fruit users can't swim, but if they were standing in a river or fresh water of any sort, would they still lose all their strength and be unable to do anything? I tried to search for it, but they closed it and archived it, so can anyone help please? "
1194,How can Haku perform hand seals with only one hand?,"In the Land of the Waves arc, it can be seen that Haku performs handseals with only one hand. That must be something special, because a.) even Kakashi was surprised to see that, and b.) that's never seen again somewhere (except I forgot it).  How is that possible? Is that a special technique? Was it ever explained in the manga/anime? "
1195,How does Tomoe's father know who kenshin is or that they were even married?,"In the manga Oibore in the fallen district (slums) ends up revealing who he is when asked why he helped Kenshin by telling the people there its his daughters husband who was there when she died.  But how did he know? Kenshin was a top secret assassin and his identity was kept secret to most of the public. How did he even know they got married (it happened in the mountains away from anyone) or Tomoe died while kenshin was there (the only people who would know, kenshin killed and maybe the higher up imperialists)?  It was stated he abandoned the family after his wife died so he wouldn't have had any contact with her or Enishi.  Enishi doesn't even meet him until after his fight with Kenshin, even then it is implied he doesn't really know who he is. "
1196,"What is the stance of Evangelion creators (Including but not limited to Hideaki Anno) on the ""Death of Author"" concept, regarding the series?","The Evangelion franchise is full of unknowns, most were never explained or given any ""word of god"" statement.   Some examples:     What Gendo whispered to Ritsuko after: ""I truly... (muted)"" to prompt her to answer: ""Liar!""        What is real the motivation for Asuka to tell Shinji ""気持ち悪い"" at the ending of the End?   Hideaki Anno then made this statement:     We all have to find our own answers.   Can we truly say that they left these blanks intentionally?  What is the stance of Evangelion creators on the ""Death of Author"" concept, regarding the series?  Please use references. "
1197,What's this symbol used by the Nazis?,"I'm on episode 5 of Black Lagoon, and I noticed this symbol being used by the Nazis on a flag and on a red arm band worn by one of the leaders of the group.      What's this symbol called, assuming it corresponds to something in real life? Is there any reason this should be used over a more recognisable symbol like the swastika? It doesn't correspond to anything listed on the Wikipedia page for Nazi symbolism.  EDIT: In response to the idea that it might have been censorship specific to Funimation, I decided to look up the episode on a Chinese streaming site I use. The symbol there was identical to the one in the Funimation episode. Of course, this doesn't mean that there couldn't have been censorship on the Chinese end as well. "
1198,Could Alluka completely heal Gon?,"I understand that she physically healed Gon via the wish that Killua asked of Nanika, but there are a few things that were possibly not ""healed"".    Gon's Nen ability   As far as we know Gen has lost the ability to use his Nen because of his fight with Pitou. I know there has been some speculation that Gon could have this ability back already but will need to train all over again to gain access to it.  Would it be a dumb theory that Killua could use Alluka to also explicitly wish back Gon's ability to use Nen?   Gon's Penalty    This is something that is little talked about but during that fight Gon somewhat created a rule similar to Kurapikas in the sense that he would give up ""all of it"" just so that he could kill Pitou. This sacrifice looks like it was supposed to kill Gon for that momentary trade in power, the only reason him being alive due to the life support after the fight and Killua's wish to Alluka. Is it possible that the exchange for that power has been nullified by Alluka healing him?   "
1199,In what order should the Appleseed movies be watched?,In what order should the Appleseed movies be watched?     Appleseed Ex-Machina    Appleseed Alpha    Appleseed Tartaros Appleseed Ouranos (others)??  
1200,"What exactly are those ""furby-balls"" in Dog Days?","In Dog Days, when ""normal"" inhabitants get knocked out, they turn into ""balls"" that look like a cats with large heads and short limbs. (similar to the Furby toy)      On other hand, when the main characters get knocked out, they look pretty normal (by Anime standards).    *Put aside the fact that a main character that is knocked out is usually striped of his/her clothes for no apparent reason other than fan-service.  So my questions are:   What's the proper name for these ""furby-balls""? How are these ""normal"" inhabitants different from the main characters? Do they ""recover"" back into human-like inhabitants?  "
1201,How do the Noble Families work in Bleach?,"In Bleach, there are Four Noble Families of the Soul Society. I know that people can have children in the Soul Society. However, is whether you are a part of the Noble family based on whether you were born into that family in the real world or in the Soul Society? For example, if you are from the original line of the Kuchiki family (in the real world) and you died, would you become part of the Noble Family?  "
1202,"Is ""Noise"" an initialism?","In episode 1 of Symphogear G, shortly after Maria summons Noise to the concert hall, we get a shot of a rack of TVs showing news stations from around the world reporting on the event.    In many of the languages shown (including English), the word ""Noise"" is set as ""N.O.I.S.E."", suggesting that it's actually an initialism (I'm guessing in English).   Is it? If so, what does it stand for?  "
1203,How far can the sharingan go?,"The Sharingan makes the user able to follow the target better, which shortens the reaction time of the user. Does the Sharingan make your mind think faster as well? If it doesn't, the users mind should not be able to keep up with what the Sharingan is able to see. If the mind becomes faster, then the user would become a super genius.  Or is there simply no logic at all?  Naruto has recently learned the flash ability from his father Minato. When someone uses flash are they teleporting or just moving really fast?  Additionally, could any form of the Sharingan ""keep up"" visually with the ""flash ability"" of either Naruto or Minato? "
1204,When did Uchiha Madara actually bite Hashirama Senju?,"After reading this question, I realized that the time Madara acquired Izanagi, was the same time he got the DNA of Senju Clan from Hashirama. However, after an extensive review on their fight (Episode 626), I can't see where and when Madara bit Hashirama. It said in the wiki that:    ""...To use Izanagi to its full potential, users must also have the genetic traits of the Senju, who are also descended from the Sage..""  Now, the question is when and where did Madara bite Hashirama? How come Madara activated Izanagi (I assume on its full potential) just right after he acquired the flesh/blood from Senju? "
1205,Why does Yuno paint her license plate yellow?,"In Volume 7 of Hidamari Sketch, the girls decide to play The Game of Life. They're bored with the generic jobs and events in the regular game, so they decide to customize their copy of the game using their art skills and creativity.  The first thing Yuno does is paint the license plate on her car game piece yellow, saying it's because the car is a light vehicle.       Nori: What are you painting?   Yuno: I changed the license plate to yellow to indicate that my car is a light vehicle. ♡   Nori: You have a very conservative life from the start...   What is she talking about? Why did she do this? "
1206,How did Hashiba conclude that the teacher-killer was in their class?,"In episode 2, Hashiba plants a phone in the classroom under instruction from Kobayashi, and then has Ms. Hanabishi show it to the class, asking who it belongs to. Hashiba replies that it belonged to their murdered teacher.   Somehow, from this sequence of events, Hashiba is able to deduce that the teacher-killer is in their class, as he reports to Kobayashi when he blusters his way into the interrogation room later.   I don't follow Hashiba's logic here. We did get those shots of an eye darting around (nervously?) during the sequence, but I'm not sure what to make of them. It can't be that Hashiba noticed Hoshino (the killer) acting suspiciously, since if he had, he could have just told Kobayashi about her right away. But nobody besides Hanabishi and Hashiba himself said or did anything (besides the darting eyes) during the staged phone-finding... so on what grounds was Hashiba able to conclude that the killer was in the class? "
1207,Was the abrupt cut to the eyecatch in the Funimation version of episode 2 of Kuusen Madoushi a production error?,"The Funimation simulcast of episode 2 of Kuusen Madoushi featured a very abrupt transition at the half-way point - Kanata was in the middle of a sentence (確かに、俺… / tashika ni, ore...) when he was cut off by the eyecatch. His being cut off was not humorous, so it doesn't seem like it was intentional.  Was this a production error? If so, whose fault was it - Funimation or someone further upstream? "
1208,How does Near prove that Light is Kira by seeing Kiyomi's name in Teru's death note?,Both Teru Mikami and Light Yagami write Kiyomi's name in their death notes the only difference being the time of death they specify. But in what way does this help Near to prove that Light is Kira?     This was a page from Teru Mikami's death note shown by Near to Light.  Does Near identify that Kiyomi died a minute earlier than the time specified by Teru? 
1209,Why do Terminal Services employees need to work in human-Giftia pairs?,"Why is it that Terminal Services employees need to work in pairs of one human and one Giftia?   Nothing they do as part of their jobs seems to strictly require the presence of specifically a human, nor specifically a Giftia. (And, I mean, given that humans and Giftias are virtually indistinguishable until near the end of the Giftia's life, what difference would it make, anyway?) "
1210,"What language is on the ""God's Message"" Cube?","In Crystal Triangle, there's an ancient relic in the shape of a cube that's got writing all over it and is referred to as ""God's Message"".     At first glance, it looks like it's based on Aramaic:     But then when we get a really good look at it, it doesn't look Aramaic at all:    Is this based on any kind of real world language/alphabet (similar to how the writing at the end of the Evangelion opening sequence is based on Angelic Script)? Or is it completely made up? "
1211,What is the extent of Bartolomeo's Devil Fruit power?,"Bartolomeo has quite a strong Devil Fruit. In the Colosseum...      ...he could block every punch with his Barrier fruit. He was really bored in this fight and had no problems at all.      For your information, the ""King Punch"" he blocked from ""The Fighting King"" Elizabello II is said to be more powerful than a Yonko. Elizabello II - Wiki     So my question is, can he really block everything?   Can it block beams, like the Slow-Slow Beam from Foxy, and shock waves, like what Whitebeard created with his Gura Gura Fruit? "
1212,"What does the title ""Aldnoah.Zero"" mean?","I recently watched ""Aldnoah.Zero"" and started with ""Aldnoah.Zero (2015)"". I was wondering about one of the main elements in this anime.      Aldnoah is something that was found on Mars (""Vers"" as it's called by the Martians) and is something old from an ancient civilization no one knows much about. They power up their ""weapon systems"" (mechs) with this thing too.   What is Aldnoah really? Is it some sort of stone, or some sort of energy? If it were just energy, they wouldn't have so advanced weapon systems, or not?  Where does the ""Zero"" in the name come from? "
1213,How does Obito use Kamui to move from one place to another,"How do Obito use kamui to move from one place to another? We have already seen that inside the kamui space, there are big square stepping stones and nothing else. So, how can he move absorbed himself into the kamui space, and materialize again in different place in the real world? "
1214,"What exactly is a ""Light Novel""?","I am only familiar with this term when I know about the anime.   Is this term only used in Japan?    Sometimes I read light novels on the internet but I never see the book myself. How is a light novel different from a regular novel? Except for light novels being... light, are there any other differences?  And usually I see the cover done in a manga-style drawing:   Are light novels used exclusively for anime or manga adaptations?  Are there any light novels that do not use manga-style drawings?    I tried to search ""Light novel cover"" and the result is as expected:   "
1215,What was Johan trying to achieve by setting fire in the book donation ceremony in Munich?,"I have completed watching the Monster anime. One thing is not cleared to me:  Johan eliminated all Schuwald's close friends just to get close to him. Once he became the secretary, his plan was to kill Schuwald. However, he changed his plan and set fire in that ceremony. My question is why Johan was so concerned with Schuwald. Why he even changed his plans on killing him?  If we look at the connections between them, we know that Johan's mother and Margot Langer were friends. Schuwald was aware of it. He even approached Johan's mother to search Margot. There he saw the twins. And that's it probably.  So, does Johan wanted to kill Schuwald initially because he saw Johan as a kid? In the end, he destroyed the books as it would be more painful for Schuwald? "
1216,What board game is being played in the early episodes of Steins;Gate?,"In episodes 4 and 5 of Steins;Gate, some of the characters are seen playing a board game, one of which is at a large tournament-style event. It's played on a board composed of blue and yellow squares, and seems to have to do with cards and flipping.  Here are some images of gameplay (sorry about the giant ""play"" icons):      What is this game called, and are its rules really defined? Does this game exist in the real world, is it based on one, or is it completely made-up? "
1217,Was the first time Zoro experienced haki in Alabasta?,Remember when Zoro learned to cut steel in Alabasta and he heard the breath in all things?  Was this swordsmanship or was this his first encounter with Haki?   
1218,Why did Tobi let Itachi remain in Akatsuki?,Tobi was well aware of Itachi's true motive for joining Akatsuki. He knew that Itachi massacred his entire clan only for the village's sake.      Then why did he let Itachi join the Akatsuki?   He was also aware that Itachi was trying to protect the leaf village from Akatsuki. So my next question is      Why didn't he get rid of Itachi at least after they start to capture the tailed beasts?  
1219,Did they ever talk about who left the nanomachines/viruses on Mars?,"Sorry didn't read the novels, but did they ever go into who left nanomachines/Methuselah virus on Mars?  Do they ever explore the concept of space/aliens again the story?  Seems like there are crazier things than humans, Methuselah or Crusniks in the their universe.   "
1220,How are games in the School Days franchise linked?,"I have played, watched and read the media from the original School Days, but I don't know much about the other games in the series and how they're linked to each other.  I even saw there's a tower defence game in the series, which seems bizarre.    What order should the games be played in and how do the games fit together (are they all in parallel universes for example?). Are there any alternate adaptations of the games while I wait for them to be translated?  Use the spoiler tags if necessary please. "
1221,How does Shi-Woon regenerate his wounds so fast?,In The Breaker-New Waves after his master broke his ki center he is still able to fight. In fights his level of regeneration is off the charts. He can keep fighting even if he has broken bones. Why is this happening? Is it because of training? Is it because of a medical condition? 
1222,Can the Titans swim?,"I have only seen the anime and haven't read the manga, but a question came to me:  Can the titans swim?  We know that they are abnormally light and strong for their size. However, the fact that they evaporate after dying kind of suggests that they are formed of some sort of compact water vapor, so should we expect them to melt when they come into contact with water? It's not like they disappear when it rains... Or maybe they can't swim because they're too stupid  Because, if they can't, this place in Paris could've been a possibility for humanity.    From [website]"
1223,Does the Extra return next school year to class 3?,"After the anime stopped       Reiko (the Extra) was killed   that school year in 1998, right? Does that mean that the Calamity has stopped, or will it happen again next year? "
1224,What order are couplings like 'CharAxCharB' in?,"In doujins coupling characters from a show off, the characters are usually referred to in the title as ""Character A x Character B""  (I feel this snippet from hanagai! explains it better)    Is there any meaning to the order of the 'multiplying'?   Is the first character mentioned the main character, more dominant, alphabetically first, randomly chosen or something else? "
1225,"What does the Death Note consider as ""original lifespan""?","I was reading this question and it got me thinking about what a person's ""original lifespan"" really was.  Does the original lifespan mean the amount of time a person has from birth to death, ultimately caused by old age (e.g. the longest a person could live barring abnormal health problems or unusual circumstances (e.g. murders, accidents))?   What if the person contracts a lethal disease? Surely it would shorten their lifespan, but would it affect their original lifespan?  So, take for example: John has a lifespan of 93 years (as seen through Shinigami eyes). He works for the CIA, though, and at one point comes into contact with a high dose of radiation from a nuclear device. Doctors tell him he only has a couple days to live.  In this case, John's lifespan has been shortened from 93 years to 2 days. If he writes his own name in the Death Note, set to die from a different disease that takes years and years to develop, would he have effectively beaten radiation poisoning?   Note that the 23-day rule (XVII) would not apply here thanks to rule XVIII. "
1226,How do anime streaming sites decide whether to acquire licenses from studios to show their anime?,What is the process of getting an anime for example onto CrunchyRoll? Let's say a new original anime airs in Japan and a lot of the viewers on the west want to watch it too.  What reasons does a streaming site consider before acquiring licenses to stream anime? How does a streaming site know what results to expect from streaming each title? 
1227,How much of their twin does the other twin need to eat?,"In Vampire Knight, if a vampire hunter family gives birth to twins, one will be weak and the other will be strong.   According to vampireknight.wikia.com:     For the pair to become powerful hunters, the stronger one has to devour the other and become one.    How much of the weaker twin does the stronger twin devour? Does the stronger one drink the blood of the weaker one or actually eat their flesh. Is this ever explained in canon or by the author? "
1228,Why does Yuuki's room change?,"During Vampire Knight (the first season) Yuuki shares a room with Yuri. During Vampire Knight Guilty, though, when they are all out for break, Yuuki's room only has one bed in it. Why isn't she staying in the dorm anymore? Where is she staying instead? "
1229,What happens to Demon Weapons who eat innocent souls?,"Okay, I pretty much get how Demon Weapons and Death Scythes work. I get how Kishin's work too. However, on the Wiki, it says that the process of becoming a Kishin is ""initially exclusive to Demon Weapons"" and requires the ""merging between a non-Demon Weapon and a Demon Weapon"", which would be a Demon Weapon eating Kishin Eggs (or souls not on the Shimigami's list).   Basically, you need a Demon Sword before you can have a Kishin.   We know that Asura ate his Demon Sword and became a Kishin so my question is this: who exactly is able to become a Kishin? What would've happened if Asura's Demon Sword continued to eat human souls? Although it was never mentioned or seen in the Soul Eater universe, could a Demon Weapon/Demon Sword--perfectly capable of killing and eating by themselves-- become a Kishin without a meister? "
1230,What is the process of acquiring a streaming license?,"When a streaming site decides they want to stream a particular anime series or movie, what steps do they take from start to finish?    Who emails whom? Does the streaming site hire additional staff like translators, censors/editors to add subtitles and hide/blur nude body parts? Which professional and legal services need to be paid? How much does each step cost?  "
1231,Can fans convince a streaming site to show a certain anime?,"If a streaming site, for whatever reason, doesn't have a certain anime of which you're a fan, can you gather enough votes in online petitions or facebook likes to convince the site to start streaming it? When could this work, and when would this be hopeless? For example: do studios decide not to work with specific streaming sites, regions or audiences of less than N viewers? "
1232,What music is playing in episode 95 of Hunter x Hunter?,I've heard this music playing in a lot of episodes but in episode 95 of Hunter x Hunter it plays at 21:19? what music is this? 
1233,Was the Earth in the Gurren Lagann universe destroyed before?,"In Gurren Lagann, when they are about to start the fight with the Anti-Spirals, they mention that the Spirals have tried to attack them before but lost. Then, in the episode when the fight is about to begin, you can see many destroyed battleships. Does this mean that the Earth was destroyed and rebuilt before? Or was humanity not completely wiped out? "
1234,Why is Homura still alive after shooting herself?,"A third of the way through the Rebellion film. Homura appears to shoot herself in the head after being unable to persuade Mami about what's going on. After the event, it seems that we see the exiting bullet, and we also see blood around the left side of Homura's face.  If this is the case, why is Homura still alive afterwards? Or did she not actually manage to shoot herself, or did she (or Mami) perhaps manage to heal herself afterwards? "
1235,Why not leave Yomiyama?,"In the anime Another, the town of Yomiyama is cursed with a calamity that causes the deaths of members of Class 3-3 and their family members living in the town.  This is obviously a big problem. So why don't the members of 3-3 and their families switch schools? Wouldn't that be a better choice than to risk death in Yomiyama? "

1237,How does Shiro get into the Deadman Wonderland?,"We know that Deadman Wonderland is a brutal prison for convicted criminals.  And at various points in the show, it is revealed how each of the main characters ended up there. (what crime they were convicted of)  But how did Shiro get there? Is it ever revealed what Shiro did to end up in that prison?    We know that Shiro was Ganta's childhood friend. So that means that she started off outside in the normal world. But are there any clues to what brought her into Deadman Wonderland? "
1238,Are joke episodes common in anime?,"Episode 101 of Naruto is a joke episode; it is set in between major plot events and revolves around trying to figure out what is under Kakashi's mask. It's also based off of an omake, which are often meant to be funny.  Is it common to have entire episodes dedicated to just a joke, or to have them based off of omake? While omake are relatively inexpensive to make, episodes are expensive, so it seems like this wouldn't be particularly common. Alternatively, it could be a useful way to fill up space in fillers in long anime, many of which I haven't seen. So, is this a common practice? "
1239,How much of the manga did Nisekoi season 2 cover?,"I'm not reading Nisekoi's light novel/manga, so I wonder, how much of the manga does the anime's second season cover? Because I found that only a few episodes contribute to the story itself and almost half of the entire season appeared to be fillers. Is it also the same in the manga? "
1240,Is Eren Jaeger considered a Rogue Titan or an Attack Titan?,"I know that Grisha was the Attack Titan before Eren ate him so that makes Eren the Attack Titan now... right?  I'm just not sure what to call his titan form. I know in the beginning they named him the Rogue Titan, but does it change now that we know he ate the Attack Titan? Most of the fandom calls him the Rogue Titan but I know a few that call Eren's titan form the Attack Titan. So is it just majority rules or whichever one you feel like calling him?  I think of Eren being called the Attack Titan is more of a title than what you should call his form... or is that the same thing?  "
1241,Does Ichigo still have his powers after his battle with Yhwach?,"The final chapter of the manga shows Ichigo leading a normal life but it's never really shown if he is still a Shinigami. Or is it the same as the time he used the Final Getsuga Tenshou in his fight with Aizen? Has Kubo talked about this somewhere, given how abrupt the ending was? "
1242,Why is the Japanese flag supposed to be funny?,"In the first chapter of Fullmetal Alchemist, immediately after the priest explains that he wants to conquer the nation, we see Ed saying that he doesn't care at all.    Why is there a Japanese flag on the priest's head? And what does Ed's gesture mean? "
1243,Great teacher Onizuka exam result,Great teacher Onizuka got full points from the high school exam. But as I understood there are 5 tests each valued at 100 points. How many questions are there for each test and how much time is each test?     If there is 2 points between Kikuchiki's result then each question must worth at most 2 points (if its standardised) and that'd mean he solved 250 questions in XX time.  His score = 500 Principal's hack score = 500 Kikuchiki's hack score = 494 Kikuchiki's score = 492 (He's the second highest next to Onizuka which means he intentionally got one of his answers wrong)   info   
1244,Was Kodomo no Jikan controversial in Japan?,"I recently read the Kodomo no Jikan manga. Then I read about the massive controversy when Seven Seas tried to release the series in the US, explained in excruciating detail by Seven Seas's Jason DeAngelis here, and summarized here. I also read about Kaworu Watashiya's response, showing that she absolutely did not one bit understand why the series was so controversial over here, and that machine translation still has a long way to go, since Watashiya got all her information from reading American forums passed through Google Translate. (I was particularly puzzled by her comments, made with an authoritative tone, that ""An adult, even a parent, who takes a bath with a child would be arrested"" in the United States.) This source also claims the series is only regarded as ""mildly risqu&eacute;"" in Japan.  Maybe I'm just too American, but Kojikan seemed like it would be at least somewhat controversial in almost any country. Rin is only in third grade when the series starts, and the later chapters deal with issues like sex ed, masturbation, menstruation, and sexual assault in a fairly realistic way. Was there any public controversy around the series in Japan? Did it raise any eyebrows at all?  I'd appreciate sources. Obviously, if the answer is ""no"", there is no such evidence, so my threshold for ""no controversy"" is ""nothing visible in a major media outlet"". If the United Moral Guardians of Podunksville, Hokkaido published a statement condemning Kojikan, I do not expect anyone to find it. (Though good job if you do.) I'm asking for evidence of a reasonably high-profile controversy, around the same scale as the one surrounding the US release. "
1245,Who is the leader of the pride troopers?,There are some spoilers for episode 101 of Dragon Ball Super which I believe comes from the Shonen Jump Magazine .

1246,Why does NARAKU NINJA wish to slay other NINJA?,"DŌMO, I am SENSHIN.  Fujikido Kenji's NINJA Soul is that of NARAKU NINJA, a NINJA who wishes to slay NINJA. And thus, Fujikido becomes NINJA Slayer. I understand why Fujikido wishes to slay NINJA - his family was killed by the NINJA of the SŌKAIYA, so of course he would want to perform FUKUSHŪ1.   But what is NARAKU NINJA's motivation? What drives him - a NINJA himself - to slay other NINJA indiscriminately?     1 Note: FUKUSHŪ means REVENGE. "
1247,Why didn't Ranma stay in China after getting the curse?,"Why didn't Ranma and Genma stay in China after getting the curse? They got the curse there in the first place. Also, if the only way to be cured was to go to China again and visit the cursed springs, then why don't they? Ranma could've swam back to China anytime he wanted and he actually planned to during the episode where Ranma was finding the cure for Akane after being attacked by Shampoo with her Xi Fa Xiang Gao technique. What's keeping Ranma in Japan? There were episode where Ranma and Genma discussed about Ranma going back to China but for some reason, Ranma ended up staying for whatever reason, probably something about inheriting the dojo. But Ranma can always return so why doesn't he? "
1248,"Who, specifically, did Yanagida mean by ""half the world""?","In episode 4, Yanagida tells Itami that the suits back in Nagata want to know whether the Special Region is worth turning half the world against Japan.   Who, specifically, consitutes ""half the world"" here? As of this point in the anime, we haven't been told much about the political situation surrounding the Gate. Is there a particular bloc of nations that opposes Japan's activity in the Special Region? Or is this more of a figurative ""lots of people will be angry with us if we colonize the Special Region"" sort of thing? "
1249,How many crew members that Straw Hat should be?,"In very first of episode, Luffy said that 10 peoples are enough for his crew. But I'm little curious, by 10 he mean, is 10 including himself or 10 other peoples on the ship plus Luffy?  I've read somewhere (I can't remember where I read, or even this is true or not) that Oda have stated the next crew is some kind ""old enemy"" of Luffy. I don't think that Jinbei is the person that Oda said because he is not an enemy for Luffy at all (Once again I don't even know that Oda really said that old enemy thing).  So, I just want to know if Oda really said something about that old enemy of Luffy, and if so did Oda also stated about Straw Hat crew members are 10 including Luffy or not? "
1250,"What does the ""FG"" in the formal name of the Symphogear system stand for?","The formal name of the Symphogear system is 「FG式回天特機装束」, which translates roughly as ""FG-Type Sky-Returning Specialized Garment"". (Maybe? I probably screwed something up, but this is close enough for the purposes of this question)   What does the ""FG"" in there stand for?  "
1251,Is Gintama ending or not?,"I came across this Kotaku article called ""Gintama Manga Isn't Ending Yet Because Its Creator Screwed Up"", and I'm not really clear on what's going on.  So apparently, Gintama was originally going to end in Weekly Jump on September 15, 2018. But now it seems like it's not ending, and it's moving to Jump Giga instead? What happened there? Could someone explain? "
1252,How are Anime distributed in Japan?,I'm curious about how Anime are distributed in Japan. Are they held by various networks? Or do they all go to the NHK? etc. 
1253,Pokemon: dialogue spoken by Ursula. Can you tell me the dialogue spoken by Ursula?,"I saw an episode of Pokemon. In this episode, the two Pokemon girls Dawn and Ursula were talking to each other. They both are rival of each other, Ursula taunts Dawn in that episode; they both have taken part in a Pokemon contest. Since I am not a native speaker I could not understand what they actually spoke. The conversation was much like this -:  Ursula: Maye! Maye! But you know it isn't sweet as little Dawn.  Dawn: Ursula.  Ursula: I have a less than pleasure of seeing your performance yesterday; as usual share dumb luck of yours gone passed. However, I do hope you make it to the final round that way when I beat you, you will make me all that much better.  _______________________________________  I don't make sure if these were the actual lines spoken by Ursula.  Can you tell me what Ursula actually said to Dawn? The link of the episode is given below and the dialogue took place between 4:34 to 4:50 seconds. Link: [website]  The dialogue took place at 4:34 to 4:50 seconds in that video.  "
1254,Why did Saber choose to return to her original timeline in Fate/stay night (Saber route) anime?,"Just finished Fate/stay night (Saber route).  I'm wondering why Saber chose to return to her original timeline only to give up and die, rather than stay with Shirou. Is it because of the consequences of leaving the Holy Grail undestroyed (what's wrong with leaving it alone, anyway?) or because she returned to fight, only to decide to give up as she returned? "
1255,Who was the little girl being possessed by Orochimaru during his fight with 3rd Hokage?,"I am wondering, during Orochimaru's fight with the 3rd Hokage, there's a little girl whom Orochimaru possessed.  Who was that girl? What is her ability, or why did Orochimaru choose to possess her?   I tried browsing the net and replaying the sequel but still can't find that little girl in the story. "
1256,Do the symbols that appear in the OP of Sasami-san@Ganbaranai mean anything?,"The OP starts out with this list of symbols that look like a table of kanas, except that some of those symbols are used more than once:    Many later scenes in the opening sequence can also be found to have a single, repeated symbol accompanying them:     Does the first image spell out an intelligible sentence in any language? And do the single, repeated symbols accompanying the later scenes signify anything? "
1257,Could a blind person with a death note exchange half their life to see again?,"One of the rules of the death note says that if someone makes the shinigami eyes deal they will have excellent vision regardless of their previous vision.  The rule in question, (listed under the Death Note Wiki as ""How to Use: XXI""):     ""Those with the eye power of the god of death will have the eyesight   of over 3.6 in the human measurement, regardless of their original   eyesight.""   Could Light or any of the other characters in the series have cured a blind person with this rule? It seems to be a brilliant way to avoid suspicion and get a true ally to cure a blind person in exchange for half of their life and abuse their gratefulness to make them kill people for you, and who's going to suspect a blind man?

1259,Difference between emission and conjuring,Alright I've basically finished the existing manga and anime and I'm still confused. What's the difference between an emitter and a conjurer? What can each do that the other can't?  
1260,Who produced what on Alexander Senki?,"Reading the question Can an animated show created outside Japan be called anime?, I recalled one of the worst shows of my teenage years: Alexander Senki, released in the US as Reign: The Conqueror.  This show retells the life of Alexander the Great as anime, in much the same way that the movie 300 retells the battle of Thermopylae as a video game. The first review on the MyAnimeList page pretty much sums up my feelings about this series.  Beyond its gruesome awfulness, I've always had my doubts that this show really counts as anime according to the definition that ʞɹɐzǝɹ gave in the answer to the linked question.  According to the Wikipedia page, the show was created by an ""international crew that drew from the resources of the worldwide animation community"". The offensively hideous character designs were courtesy of Korean-American animator Peter Chung, well known for such highly regarded anime classics as Matriculated from The Animatrix, Æon Flux, and Rugrats. The animation was by Madhouse, though Wikipedia claims ""[m]ost of the production work was handled by Korean animators."" The producers of the show also apparently created their own English dub, which was scrapped by Tokyopop when they distributed the series.  I'm curious who else made up the ""international crew"". Was it essentially a normal anime production, where Madhouse outsources the grunt work to Korean studios, except produced under the creative direction of a guy who thinks the ancient Greeks ran around in thong underwear with metal plates sewn on? Or did the Korean studios play a greater than average role? Was there some other significant part of the show which was produced outside Japan? "
1261,Was Goku using his full power against Kale?,"In Dragon Ball Super episode 100,      Goku attacked Kale Super Saiyan green ""berserker"" mode with a Kamehameha in Super Saiyan blue.    Was Goku using his full power when he did it?  If so, does this mean that...      Super Saiyan green ""berserker"" is more powerful than Super Saiyan blue?  "

And if so, why didn't he tell her?  "
1263,How did Chino's grandfather end up as a rabbit?,"From the first episode of Gochuumon wa Usagi desuka? (Is the order a rabbit?) Chino's grandfather was depicted as a rabbit (very questionable since he didn't look like a rabbit, but the anime says so, so let's call him a rabbit). However, considering that both Chino's father and Chino are normal humans, and that the writer who often comes to Chino's cafe (Rabbit House) used to chat with the first owner (Chino's grandfather), there must be a time where he was a normal human. Otherwise, the writer lady would have noticed it was him when she saw the rabbit. Also since the rabbit has no arms (at least the first season doesn't show it having arms), and considering his size, he wouldn't be able to pour coffee. Has it been explained somewhere (anime and manga) why Chino's grandfather turned into a rabbit?  Note: I haven't watched the second season. Please carefully put spoilers if they come up. "
1264,Did Kale knock out Goku?,"In Dragon Ball Super episode 100,      After Kale went all rage in super saiyajin green ""berserker"", and after she fired ki blasts in all directions, Goku appeared in base form after being in super saiyajin blue. Though I dont think wee see a ki blast impacting him.    Did Kale knock out Goku? or he transformed back to base form? "
1265,Just who knew Arturia was female when she was King?,"Originally, I thought Merlin, Lancelot, Guinevere, Morgan le Fay and Mordred were the only people who knew Arturia was female when she was king.   While reading up on Kay's profile on the Wikia, I read that he knew she was a female and vowed to keep it a secret     Her identity as being female was known to him, but he kept the secret all his life after being sworn to secrecy by Merlin.   So this got me wondering: Was there anyone else who knew that King Arturia was in fact a woman? How did they find out? "
1266,What kind of drawing format is this? Pictures with litle box on top left,"Sometimes I find art like these on Pixiv    Sources:   [website][website][website][website]The little box on the top left is usually blank and something is written in the square box next to it - sometimes it's the artist name and sometimes it's not. And usually the picture's title starts with 'C' and is followed by a two-digit number, although not always (see links).   What kind of drawing format is this? What's the little box on the top left for? And what's the meaning of 'C..' in the title? And what does the number stand for? Sometimes the title starts with 'C..' but doesn't have the same format, like this.   Note that two of the five links I provided are from pro artists. They are Akio Watanabe, the character designer from the Monogatari Series anime and Shinobu Shinotsuki, the illustrator of the Youjo Senki light novel. "

1268,Did Zero-Two regain her memories far earlier? [spoiler alert],"I'm doing currently a quick rewatch in order to find out hidden details, symbolism etc..  I noticed a possibility that Zero-Two could regain her memories far earlier than Hiiro. Even before visiting ""Garden"".  It would be even possible that she regained the memories, but didn't recognize him as him just after first meeting, or could have doubts if he is really he for long time or still could be afraid of rejection for being a demon.  Following this way of thinking, she could even believe that her ""old darling"" died in a battle long time ago like other yearlings and the person she met recently is only a clone. (Just as former 13th squad or Nana)  Obviously she seems like she does not recognize him during their first meeting (in recent timeline) but it seems like it might happen after about 1st-2nd episode.  Could you please help me find some references to similar investigation?  Or maybe I will try to state my question directly: Did she regain her memories before Hiiro? If yes, when approximately? "

1270,What is the proper reading order for the Corpse Party mangas?,"Of the mangas that are part of the Corpse Party franchise, what order should they be read in? Which of the series are one-shots/not relevant to the main plot?  Release order seems to be:   Blood Covered Musume Another Child Book of Shadows Sachiko's Game of Love – Hysteric Birthday 2U  and Cemetery 0: Kaibyaku no Ars Moriend (released on the same day)   Should they be read in release order, or is there a chronological order that should be used instead? "
1271,Can the two titan powers inside Eren be separated and given to two different people?,So Eren     Has the Attack titan and the Founding titan inside of him right?!   we can presume that if someone were to consume Eren      they will gain the two titan powers together.   So can some one consume or gain just one of the titans? Like when the original titan(the original Ymir) divided her powers in to nine different powers and gave them to her descendants?  
1272,Why does Lindy and Leti have the same mark on their foreheads?,"Both Lindy and Leti have a mark on their foreheads which appears to be 4 triangles pointing to one another  1   they aren't related. Neither one of their sons, Chrono and Griffith respectfully, have this mark and Clyde, Chrono's Father does not appear to have this which rules it out as being genetic.   it also doesn't appear to be associated with their rank in the Dimensional Navy as Gil Graham does not have it and he too is an Admiral like them.  So why do they both have the same mark on their forehead? is there some meaning behind it?  1: the image of Lindy is from the first Movie which seems to have high quality artwork than the series so i am assuming that while Leti's appears as 4 dots i am assuming that it's supposed to be 4 triangles aswell "
1273,How did Impel Down's staff not know Buggy was a devil fruit user?,How did the staff of Impel Down not know Buggy had a devil fruit when they put him in ? Don't they dunk prisoners in boiling water? Seriously how did Buggy get by these people ? Is Impel Down security that bad ? 
1274,Are the ends of Shingeki no Kyojin season 1 and 2 the same?,"So I'm really confused right now. I think maybe I'm subject for the Mandela effect or something, because I could have sworn that season 1 of Attack on Titan ended with the smiling titan eating Hannes and Eren using his founder titan power to control the other titans to eat her.   But now when I've started watching Season 2, that's what ends season 2? I don't understand that at all. I remember that I started reading the manga at chapter 50 and onwards, because that's how far the anime had come. And that was a couple years ago!   I'm talking about this scene right here.   I feel like I clearly remember having seen this, but Season 1 doesn't seem to end this way. So how the hell can I remember it from season 1? I haven't even come that far into Season 2 yet so I can't have mixed it up. "
1275,"In Sword Art Online Ordinal Scale, how does Asuna know about the boss' healing ability?","The final fight against the level 100 boss has two parts to it:   Kirito and his usual group of friends go up against it alone. Asuna, and everyone else from ALO and GGO join in.   In the 1st half of the battle, Kirito and friends basically get annihilated. In this first part, they observe that the boss will heal itself with a tree and drop of water.        In the 2nd half of the battle where everyone is in, the boss attempts to heal itself again. But Asuna tells everyone to block the drop of water to stop the healing.     Asuna wasn't there yet when the boss first healed itself. She wasn't watching either as she was talking to Yuuna and not in full dive.  How did she know about the move to tell everyone to block it? Is this a plot hole? Or is there an explanation to it? "
1276,What did really happen in the end of Phantom: Requiem for the Phantom?,"Some people claim that those Mongolian flowers are poisonous and that Ein ate one when Zwei died, but I've researched and there is no reliable source that tells us that those flowers are really poisonous. Some people claim that actually, they weren't together, Zwei was somewhere else, and others claim that Ein killed Zwei.   Did both Ein and Zwei die? What did really happen there?  "
1277,"Will ""Sailor Stars"" (the final season) be available in English dub?","I've been watching the English dubbed version of Sailor Moon over and over. During that time, I thought the Sailor Stars, the last season would soon come out in English, but it never did. So, I only had one solution: to watch the original Japanese version.  I tried watching the last season in Japanese with English sub, and it was so confusing. I was like 'Who's this character?' 'Oh, it's Mina! Minako is her name...' and stuff like that.  So, will Sailor Stars (the final season) be available in English dub? "
1278,What is the purpose for the art-style of puck changing by scene?,In some chapters or even as cover art in berserk puck is drawn fully with detail as shown here:     But in several chapters he is drawn like this:      Is there a reason for neglecting detail? I noticed that when he comes in as comic relief he seems to miss alot of detail like so. But is there some sort of artistic reason behind this choice that I am not aware of?  
1279,Why and how did Shiro kill Ganta's classmates?,"I have watched only anime and Shiro is a mystery to me. It seems like she has two personalities. It happened more than once, she was so nice and suddenly somehow gone crazy, her face changes completely. Even if I'm right and she has some mental disorder, I don't understand her at all.  How did she get out of prison if she is a prisoner and then killed Ganta's classmates?   Was that out of jealousy?   I just don't get it.  "
1280,What are the feathers on Rei's neck?,"As of episode 7, we know the following:   Rei is somehow connected to the Alones that are attacking the city. The (unnamed) black bird is able to inflict extreme pain on Rei through those feathers. Every time Rei fires an arrow at an Alone, she consumes one feather.     Is there anything else that has been revealed? Do these feathers symbolize anything? "
1281,"Did Kanade Oe break the ""4th wall""?","In episode 7 of Chihayafuru 2, Chihaya mentions that she didn't know what ""Frenzied"" means and Kanade says to herself:     ""We're in the second season and she still doesn't know what the title means?!""     I realize that ""chihayaburu"" is impassionate, but is this a play on words somehow? Or is this an instance of Kanade breaking the fourth wall? It would be the first instance of this happening as far as I know, seemed really awkward and out of place. "
1282,"Are the ""A Certain Magical Index"" seasons connected?",Can you watch A Certain Magical Index season 3 without watching the other seasons first? Do you have to watch them in order? Are all the Index seasons connected or is season 3 a new story? 
1283,"In the anime, how many girls did Itou Makoto sleep with and are they all emotionally tied?","Did Itou Makoto sleep with all the girls in the anime? And if so, did all those girls were affectionate towards Itou? I'm not sure if Itou really played dirty with all the girls. I'm too slow with this kind of thing and I just happened to watch this anime because of Kotonoha. "
1284,Is Tarble canon?,"There is this Dragon Ball family tree been shared in Dragon Ball related websites, which shows the name ""Tarble"" (ターブル - Tāburu)) in japanese. Is this official? Has Tarble been canonized? IIRC a brother of Vegita was mentioned in Battle of Gods but nobody said his name   "
1285,When did the Soul Eater anime and manga diverge?,"From what I've heard, the anime version of Soul Eater was fairly faithful to the manga up to a certain point (excluding a few fillers). However, the ending of the anime was nothing like the manga (which is still ongoing), and in my view the end of the anime was its weakest point. I want to start reading the manga at the point where the two diverged.  What is the last manga chapter that was adapted in the anime, and what episode does that correspond to? Also, are there any chapters before that which I would have missed from the anime (especially those which have important plot points)? "
1286,Why Raikage didn't consider Minato using Body Flicker in their fight?,"In his fight against Raikage, Minato spread his marked Kunai to many locations. It seemed like the Raikage was very sure that Minato would only appear at the marked area/kunai.    My question is, can Minato appear at unmarked location using Body Flicker? I think he obviously can. If so, then why Raikage didn't consider this in their fight? "
1287,Did both Crocodile and Smoker use the artificial rain powder in Alabasta?,"By reading the manga and rewatching the anime I reached to this conclusion -  Rain didn't fall in Alabasta for 3 years, but before that it did only in the capital and not in the neighbouring regions.  When the artificial rain powder is used, the location where it is used gets more than average rain and nearby areas don't get any.  Since by good faith we know the king wasn't using the powder or had any knowledge of it being used, could it be that Crocodile was using it in the capital from some hidden location which resulted in such a phenomenon and after he stopped using it, say the 3 years that no rain happened was the time natural weather was reconstructing itself and whether or not Crocodile was defeated, it would have rained nonetheless??  And secondly if Smoker had used artificial rain machine from a ship after the fight (couldn't figure out whether it was the case or not as he says when asked, he will never break the law but it is shown such a ship is there in the back) , how was he able to make rain the whole island??  "
1288,Can you physically stop someone from commiting suicide?,"Once you write suicide as the cause of death, the Death Note possesses victim and they commit suicide e.g. Naiomi Misora.  What would happen if you were to physically prevent that person from killing themselves?  For example, if Light were to physically restrain Naiomi before she hung herself, would the Death Note default to heart attack since the victim is incapable of fulfilling it? "
1289,Why do many anime not follow the manga? Why are they usually made shorter?,"Many anime do not follow the manga history and are made shorter. However there are a few that do follow it or try to finish the history with the manga like the big three (Naruto, Bleach, One Piece), Death Note, and FMA Brotherhood. But others finish the anime without the real ending like FMA, Ouran High School, Pandora Hearts, Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicle. Why is this so? Is it because of the high cost? Or the lack of popularity? "
1290,How did the angry symbol originate?,"We've all seen it many times... When someone gets angry or annoyed, the angry symbol (shown below) shows up one or more times in and around the person's head.     Where did it come from? How did it get popularized? Is there a proper term for it?  "
1291,Who was the first cosplayer?,"Who was considered as the first cosplayer ever? Or, who popularized cosplaying anime? Was cosplaying started in Japan as well or it started elsewhere?  "
1292,"Is there more than one World Tree in the ""known"" world?","In episode 37 ""Ging × And × Gon"" we can see that a tape was left for Gon by his father Ging. After playing this tape, the scene jumps to Ging riding atop two different beasts. The scene clearly shows a giant tree in the background.   Now, this tree size is substantially larger than anything else seen in the series except for the World Tree that Gon climbs up in episode 148 ""Until Now x and x From Now"". The tree showed in the scene looks to be even larger than the adolescent world tree. Ging also states that he has not been to the Dark Continent yet due to him meeting not meeting the requirements.  Would it be safe to assume that there was more than one World Tree seed that found its way to the ""known"" world? "
1293,What is the proper order to watch Hakuouki in?,"Pretty much just as the title states: What is the proper order to watch Hakuouki in?  Recently I watched Hakuouki Shinsengumi Kitan, and it really felt as if I jumped in half-way through a series. Then, I found out there are about 10 different Hakuouki and I'm wondering, in which order I should watch them to properly follow the story? "
1294,"What, if anything, was the early 90s anime creativity crisis?","I fairly often hear or read about how the anime industry had stagnated during the early 90s. It's mostly brought up in the context of Neon Genesis Evangelion being the first influential anime in several years back then as mentioned on this answer:     Eventhough they never directly admit it, I'm sure there's some amount of influence that Evangelion had on Rahxephon, intended or not, simply because Evangelion was an incredibly influential show, at a time when it seemed anime in general was stagnating. So everything that came after that, for better or worse, could have had some influence from Evangelion.      (Emphasis mine)   Is this true? If so, what exactly was this crisis and why did it happen? "
1295,Why do anime films tend to use film actors to voice the anime instead of professional seiyuu?,"For example, the voice actors for the protagonists of the anime film Uchiage Hanabi, Shita kara Miru ka? Yoko kara Miru ka? are Suda Masaki and Hirose Suzu, who are best known for their acting careers. Compared to other professional seiyuus in the industry, both of them have much less experience in voice acting.  On the other hand, famous seiyuus (i.e. Miyano Mamoru, Hanazawa Kana, and Kaji Yuki) were given a supporting role in the film.  Regardless of their performance in the film (cause it's not out yet), I was curious if there are any reasons these anime films tend to use film actors? Since there are a huge pool of seiyuu working in the industry.  Furthermore, Kamiki Ryunosuke and Kamishiraishi Mone got a leading voice acting role in Kimi no Na wa. They both did a great job and even received an award for it. However, it seems to me that they only do voice acting for anime films (especially Kamiki Ryunosuke).   Is there a particular reason for this? Or is it just a marketing strategy to use these big actors' names in the film?  "
1296,Live action version based purely on manga,"There are a lot of live actions that are based from anime. To name a few: Paradise Kiss, Kimi ni Todoke and Lovely Complex. Has there ever been a live action film that was purely based on manga, meaning without the manga becoming an anime? Or is it not possible to base a live action film purely on manga (since a manga that has its anime version defines its popularity)? "
1297,Does the super saiyan god return to Dragon Ball Super ? (possible spoilers),"    So there are rumours that the super saiyan god (red) is going to return to the Dragon Ball Super anime series. There is a text from a japanese magazine which supposedly says so, and even though I can't assert it's true, I indeed can read ""super saiyan god"" written in japanese in the text.    Can anyone confirm it or deny it by reading what the japanese magazine says in this text? (or through other source?)   "
1298,Is the Accel World manga the whole story?,"I found Accel World's light novel and the manga on Amazon. My question: Is the manga the completed story? The manga has 8 volumes and the last one will be released on December 11, 2018. But the light novel has 17 volumes and the last one will be released on March 19, 2019.  So is the manga the whole story? Or do I need the light novels if I want to read the whole Accel World? If so, is it because the light novels have more volumes and will be released on 2019 while the manga is only up to 2018 so the manga does not have the completed story? Or is it otherwise? "
1299,Why does Lupin have both prowess and infantile behavior when it comes to women?,"Why does Lupin seem to be both skillful with women but also devoid of seriousness and is infantile towards women?   What is the source and purpose of this equivocated attitude towards women?   And Lupin is by no means the only male character to do this. This theme seems to run like a red thread through most of the anime where male character seem to have the main role. But compared to other male characters Lupin is an adult making ""faces"". Is there a Japanese culture influence in this  funny-faces making or this is just a manga/anime original contribution? "
1300,Attack on Titan Opening Themes,"I'm having trouble matching the 3 opening themes to Attack on Titan to tracks available to purchase in various digital outlets.  For the avoidance of confusion, I'm looking for the long versions of the three tracks featured on this YouTube video [website]Thanks to other questions and answers on the site I'm confident that the first one is Guren no Yumiya by Linked Horizon, but while I think the 3rd one should be called Shingeki no Kyojin, I'm struggling to match it to an artist and I'm exactly nowhere with the 2nd one. "
1301,Does the Dragon Ball Heroes opening 5 have any meaning for Dragon Ball Super?,"In Dragon Ball Heroes opening 5,  (be careful, possible spoiler or not)  [website]   We see Goku, Freezer, and Jiren are the only players left in the tournament of power.    Does this have any relevance for what's going to happen in Dragon Ball Super?  "
1302,Does Gogeta have a new transformation in Dragon Ball Super Broly?,"This frame from Gogeta is seen in Dragon Ball Super Broly.     As we know several canon and filler transformations have been shown surpassing regular Super Saiyan Blue in the anime / manga   Ultra Instinct Omen Super Saiyan Blue Evolution Mastered Super Saiyan Blue Mastered Super Saiyan Blue Power stressed Mastered Ultra Instinct   Being Gogeta a fusion of Goku and Vegeta, one would think he should be able to access to some of them, combine them or use a new transformation. Is this state regular super saiyan blue, one of the former super saiyan blue upgrades mentioned above or a new transformation?  Does Gogeta have a new transformation in Dragon Ball Super Broly? "
1303,Where did the Dog-people come from?,"In Dragon-ball there are numerous dog-people, one of which is the king of the world    There were other dog-people in the anime episode Plight of the children.  One of the orphans was a dog person, and one of the police was a dog person.  Where did they all come from?  Did someone, one day, breed with a dog, thus spawning this race of Dog-people? "
1304,"What actually is modern magic, and how does it work?","The opening to the anime starts out with a monologue from Tatsuya explaining that magic, once a product of fantasy and the imagination, has actually been synthesised into a modern technology during the 21st century.  However, during the show's entirety, there is no concise explanation of magic, or any of its core concepts. Certain spells have a rough description before they're activated, but the fundamentals are never covered, or not at a depth where a desirable understanding of the phenomenon of magic is attainable. Additionally, the spin off series Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei – Yoku Wakaru Mahouka! only has one episode that covers how magic works, and the information there is pretty sparse.  So how does modern magic work? What does a CAD really do? What are Psions, CADs and an Eidos, and how do they influence each other to give the result we see in the series? "
1305,How is the ability to use chakra alloted?,"This might have an obvious answer that I've missed but I'm just checking it out for a fanfiction. I know kekkei genkai are genetic. I know everyone has chakra but not everyone has the ability to use it and this may or may not have something to not with the size of chakra coils? Not sure about this as I've probably read more fanfics than canon. Anyway. The question is this: Is the ability to use chakra genetic (so basically all ninja are descended in some way from Kaguya Otsutsuki including Sakura Haruno via some kind of recessive gene..) or was it simply available to use (randomly?) after Kaguya ate the fruit of the Shinju? Since Kaguya is named as the progenitor of chakra, I'm assuming no one could use chakra before her. The genetic theory requires a long period of natural selection, such as the Out of Africa and Eve theories on Earth. I'm not sure of the time skip between Kaguya and Naruto is enough for this. Anyway, all answers welcome. "
1306,How much time will it take me to watch the .hack series?,"I'd like to give .hack a go, however I have very limited time in my schedule so I often avoid picking series with too many episodes.  I would like to know :   How much time does it take to watch everything ? How much time does it take to watch main part of the series?  "
1307,Who was the attacker targeting in episode 1?,"Who was the man with the knife targeting or trying to attack in episode 1?  He didn't really stop, he just left the knife and kept going.  Was this a random event?  Kind of like a drive-by?  Did the attacker want to kill a random person? "
1308,Why are manga read from right to left? Has it always been so?,Why are manga read right to left? Has it always been so? Are there any exceptions?  (Flipped mangas are excused from this question.) 
1309,"Alternative super saiyan transformation of Kale, what's it supposed to be? (warning: content of recent episode 101)","In Dragon Ball Super episode 101, we've seen another transformation of Kale. Instead of having her eyes blank and her muscles inflated, the called ""berserker mode"", in the alternative transformation she has the regular form of a super saiyan but apparently she keeps a little of her greenish hair/aura (a little more yellowish maybe), and she's weaker than in berserker mode.   Kale in super saiyan Berserker mode:    Kale alternative super saiyan transformation:    Kale and Caulifla super saiyan transformations together for comparision:    What is this transformation supposed to be? Is it a regular super saiyan, or is it a different super saiyan transformation with a different level of power? "
1310,What is the meaning of the dialogue at the end of the episode 30?,"At the very end of the episode 30, the dialogue reads:     … but at that place, for that one moment the hero killer was the only one who stood up to fight against his opponent.   I just don't know what it could mean. Is it that this guy was standing and the others were lying on the ground or half-sitting? Why does it matter? It's phrased in such a way that you'd expect some teachable moment wisdom or a thought-provoking metaphor, but I just don't get what it could mean in this context. Maybe the meaning was lost in translation of the subtitles. "
1311,Who has the head as of episode 2 of Durarara!!×2 Ten?,"In the conversation between Seiji and ultra-stalker Mika at the end of episode 2 of Durarara!!×2 Ten, Mika claims that Namie probably doesn't know where the head is, and that Izaya probably doesn't have it either, since she wasn't able to find it when she snuck into Izaya's apartments.   In that case, who does have the head? I thought that Izaya did, in fact, have the head. Is it that Izaya has misled Mika somehow, or am I just misremembering something? And was Namie just lying when she said she'd give Mika the head? (I mean, Namie was obviously lying about being willing to give her the head, but did she even have the wherewithal to give Mika the head if she had wanted to?)  (I would appreciate it if stuff that the viewer isn't supposed to know at this point in the story were hidden in spoiler blocks.) "
1312,How Kabuto could reincarnate or manifest Hidan (in an anime filler)?,"In episode 290 of Naruto Shippuden, Kabuto creates Hidan from thousands of tiny snakes. But by looking at the eyes of manifested Hidan, it seems like an Edo-Tensei. And Kabuto mentions it himself.  Hidan isn't dead! Then how can he be reincarnated? What Jutsu is that??   In the manga of course there is no confusion..  But for that episode I am trying to find the logic. Do you have any thoughts? "
1313,"What is the origin of the title ""Ghost in the Shell""?","The anime series Ghost in the Shell has a Japanese name which can be transliterated as ""Mobile Armored Riot Police""; from Wikipedia:     Ghost in the Shell (攻殻機動隊 Kōkaku Kidōtai?, literally ""Mobile Armored Riot Police"")   It's clear to me that the English name of ""Ghost in the Shell"" is far, well, cooler than ""Mobile Armored Riot Police"". But why was this particular name chosen? What are its origins, and what significance does it have in the series (if any)? "
1314,"What ""actions"" did Toneri Otsutsuki perform on Boruto","In Boruto Episode 53, After Urashiki finally found Toneri, they both had a brief discussion about how the Main Branch of the Otsutsuki Clan had been monitoring everything that happened for the past thousand years.  Right before their battle, Urashiki  told Toneri: ""You may think you made the first move by doing something to that womans son, but that was very hastily prepared"" (he meant Boruto, who is the Son of the Byakugan Princess).  What exactly did Toneri do to Boruto? I'm guessing it has to do with his Jogan.      What is the connection between Boruto and Toneri? because I also remember Boruto's Jogan was activated immidiately after Toneri appeared in his dream.  "
1315,How did the lolicon genre begin in anime/manga?,I have always wondered how the Japanese got the idea of making animated productions including underage girls and the obsession with them. When did it start? Did the idea originate in Japan? Was it welcomed by the actual anime public? 
1316,Will Stain get One for All ability?,"After watching fight between Midoriya and Stain, I started to wonder if Stain may obtain the One for All ability ?    We all know that in order to pass the ability of One for All, you need to pass your DNA to other person ( By passing hair which All might did, but you can use blood or saliva too ). Now Stain always licks the blood to use his pulverise on the enemy, and he licked Midoriya's blood, too.    As now Midoriya has the One for All ability, licking his blood, and DNA there, seems like it may allow the ability to be passed to Stain?.    So is it really possible (considering Stain is unconscious/dead )? "
1317,"In the last episode of ""Your Lie in April"", what was enclosed in the envelope?","This is where the letter by Miyazano Kaori is being read out. The English subtitles said,     P.S. I'm enclosing something that I've always treasured.   If you don't want it, feel free to tear it up and throw it away.     I can't understand Japanese; I don't know if she was being more descriptive there. All I can see is a part of a picture of two females in skirts, and one or two little kids. One of them appears to be an adult or an older girl, and the other, a young girl. But I can't recall such a scene in the series. What exactly was she talking about, and what was the picture that was enclosed?  If the voiced description in Japanese was insufficient, does the manga shed more light on it? "
1318,How did Madara Uchiha survive such a long time?,"In the last chapters of the manga,      When Tobi finally admits he is Obito and starts to remember what happened after the rock hit him, he meets Madara. How is this possible? Hundreds of years must have passed; how was he able to survive so long?  "
1319,How is hentai anime voicing recorded?,"With normal anime, all the seiyuu involved are in one room where they step up and talk to the microphone when it is their turn. Both male seiyuu and female seiyuu are present in the same room and might even stand together one next to the other if their characters are having conversation.  However, what about hentai anime? Do they still record it as if it was a normal anime? "
1320,Does anyone know what those branches are in Goblin Slayer episode 7?,Does any one know what these branches are and what their purpose is (like herbal)? Is it in Japanese culture or any other culture?   
1321,"Could the Sharingan have seen Nue's ""possession chakra""?","Boruto's Jogan instinctively came on and enabled him to sense the ""chakra shadows"" of whenever Nue leeched unto and possessed someone.   If Sarada had awakened her Sharingan earlier, would she have been able to see the chakra from Nue's possession? Or was it ever stated if only Boruto's Jogan could sense Nue? "
1322,Is Grimmjow Jaegerjaquez alive?,"In Bleach, whilst watching the final fight between Ichigo and Grimmjow I noticed that Grimmjow's body did not vanish when he was defeated as the other espadas did (in the aftermath when Nnoitra appeared). There is no mention of Grimmjow after this. Confused I turned to the manga, in 286 I could not tell either. I was still confused so I turned to the wiki. In the wiki, it vaguely says      ""..but Ichigo steps in and protects Grimmjow as he lies on the ground, severely wounded. However, he survives the attack...   A quick google search and I found this yahoo answers post about this but both posts are vague and unhelpful. Is there some credible source that can verify if he is alive or not? "
1323,Doesn't Female Titan and Beast Titan have the Coordinate ability?,It seems like most titans have the Coordinate ability. Beast Titan was directly telling other titans what to do. Female was calling and leading them.   Whats the difference in Eren's Coordinate ability? They look the same to me. Or is it the same power like regeneration but only some titans have it? 
1324,"How are ""A Certain Magical Index"" and ""A Certain Scientific Railgun"" connected?","According to MAL, the former is the parent story of the latter, that appears described as a side story. However, I find no reference to these questions:  Do both stories take place in the same universe? Are they somewhat dependent on each other? If so, in which order should the series be watched? "
1325,Which music theme plays at the end of the Naruto vs Sasuke fight?,Which music theme is it at the timestamp 1:15:10 in this YouTube Link: Naruto vs Sasuke Full Fight English Dub ?  
1326,Why didn't Naruto use Summoning Jutsu in Chuunin Exam?,"They mention nothing about Summoning Jutsu in the exam and Naruto learned this jutsu before the exam. Even if Gamabunta would not want to fight for Naruto, why didn't he at least try to use that jutsu?    Did I miss something? Did they actually say that Summoning was not allowed in the exam? "
1327,How can we sort manga (by genre) within Crunchyroll's manga utility or mobile app?,"I've been considering getting a Crunchyroll membership primarily for the manga rather than the anime. Looking on their site, Crunchyroll does not have anyway to organize and parse through their manga library other than alphabetically. They do not have a way to search by genre or anything like that.  Is the mobile app for Android any better? Does it have sorting? "
1328,Is the reanimated Minato much stronger than when he was alive?,"In Naruto chapter 618, all the souls that are bound inside the shinigami of the shiki fuujin were pulled out by Orochimaru. It includes the souls of the four previous Hokages. Now, before his death, Minato was able to seal half of the nine tails chakra into his own. Does it mean that he is much stronger than he when was alive? Does he have any chance on using the kyuubi's chakra for himself just like what Naruto did? "
1329,"What is the difference between yuri and shoujo-ai, yaoi and shounen-ai and ecchi and hentai anime genre?","Yuri and Shoujo-ai are anime themes which are related to girl-to-girl relationship, while yaoi and shounen-ai are related to boy-to-boy relationships. But what are their distinct difference? When can you call a specific girl-to-girl anime a yuri or shoujo-ai? When can you call a specific boy-to-boy anime a yaoi or shounen-ai?  Plus, what is the distinct difference of ecchi and hentai anime? I just know that they are both for adults only-theme anime. When can you call a specific anime an ecchi or hentai? "
1330,What happened to Ray Penber when he died since he has used Death Note?,"I've just finished re-watching Death Note and the movie where we find out Light becomes a shinigami, and realised that Ray Penber also used the Death Note to write down names of his FBI colleagues in Episode 5 whilst on the train.  So my question is, does Penber also become a shinigami like Light? And if not, does he go to heaven or hell, as Ryuk stated that a human who uses the Death Note can't go to either. So is he like in some sort of void? "
1331,What is the role of the assumption 'As long as it doesn't violate pledge three' in pledge 4?,"No Game No Life pledge 4:     As long as it doesn't violate pledge 3, anything may be bet, and any game may be played.    What happens when we delete the hypothesis (aka assumption) 'As long as it doesn't violate pledge 3' ?   Of course, if we delete the hypothesis, then we might as well delete the 4th pledge altogether. Thus, pledge 4 may be restated:     Anything may be bet, and any game may be played unless it violates pledge three.   I guess my question may be rephrased to ask for (counter)examples of bets or games that would violate pledge 3.   I actually feel there's some   self-referential error, way that pledge 4 is actually redundant or vacuous truth.    This might be resolved by question 1, but if not, then what's going on?  Pledge 4 actually seems to point out that the 'game' and that which players bet in pledges 2 and 3 are kinda not quite defined at least in terms of the scope. I mean, what's the scope of the games or that which players bet? It seems pledge 4 is precisely defining the scope, but pledge 4 refers to pledge 3. My understanding is:     Pledge 2: All conflict in this world will be resolved through games, where games are defined in scope in pledge 4.      Pledge 3: In games, each player will bet something that they agree is of equal value, where games and that which players bet are defined in scope in pledge 4.      Pledge 4: The scope of games and that which players bet is that which does not violate pledge 3.   What am I misunderstanding? "
1332,How come Mr. Braun doesn't remember Suzuha?,"In episode 16 Suzuha goes back in time. Unlike what happens when they send a D-Mail or time-leap, this doesn't cause the divergence ratio to shift — which in turn means all lab members still remember her, since she was just there.  However, after that, Mr. Braun goes to the lab to give Okabe Rintarou a letter from Suzuha, saying:     It's a letter from someone who once took care of me.   Does he not remember her working for him as a part-timer? That would be weird, given everyone else in the lab appears to still remember her.    Or is the name change — from Amane Suzuha to Hashida Suzu — along with the age difference enough to make him not realize they're the same person? "
1333,"What was removed between the Japanese and English releases of ""Odin: Photon Space Sailer Starlight""?","The anime film Odin: Photon Space Sailer Starlight was released in Japan with a running time of 139 minutes, but Central Park Media's U.S. release of the movie is only 93 minutes long. This results in a whopping 45 minutes of footage edited out. I realize there was no real ending to the movie since it was originally planned to be a trilogy, and that the film itself is kind of slow to begin with. But what did the U.S. release edit out? Was there a specific chunk(s) of the story that was removed? Or did they somehow remove all of the panning, random action, and borderline long still shots throughout the movie? "
1334,Funding and anime diversity,"In this video, Digibro argues anime's international appeal is that, whereas Western TV including its animation is designed for financial reasons to meet a target demographic's existing interests, anime can be more diverse and give us ""something that we never would’ve known we wanted"". I'm sure I've simplified the argument (transcript here), but my understanding is that Digibro feels financial motives haven't homogenised anime as much as they have the animation of other nations. But why would that be so? "
1335,What does the R2 mean in Code Geass?,"The second season of Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion is suffixed with R2.  C.C's and V.V's names, while written with the dot between them they are pronounced as C2 and V2.  So I am wondering what the R2 in the title means: is it similar to how C.C's and V.V's names are writen and pronounced and it's supposed to be written as R.R? Does it mean something? "
1336,Why was Kisame surprised when he saw Obito (Tobi/fake Madara) without the mask the second time they've met in person?,"So, Kisame first met Obito (Tobi) when he introduced himself as the guy who controlls the Mizukage. Then, he tells Kisame about his Eye of the Moon Plan (Tsuki no Me) and recruits him to Akatsuki. So that's like 4 people who knew the true identity of Tobi as 'Madara' (later Obito, but they didn't know that): Konan, Nagato, Itachi, Kisame.  But if Kisame also knew him as the leader of Akatsuki, then why was he surprised when Tobi showed his face to him the second time, after Itachi died? I thought he already knew that Tobi mas Madara since he was the one who recruited him. It made sense for him to continue with Akatsuki after Nagato died, since Kisame didn't really care about who the leader was, as long as Kisame got the job done, but the only thing that bothers me is: why was he surprised when Tobi showed his face to Kisame the second time? He should've already known it was Madara/Obito. Is this a plot hole? "
1337,How did Menma fulfill her wish?,"In Ano Hana, if I understood correctly, Menma's wish was to help Jinta's dying mother fulfill her wish, and that was to make Jinta cry. If it was, then why did Menma start to vanish on the last episode when Jinta cried again for the first time after Menma appeared before him in the episode when he joked that he remembered something (a movie perhaps) to hide the real reason he was crying from Menma?   Would the wish just take effect if Menma clearly remembered what it is? Or making Jinta cry was just put in that way by his mother for the young Menma to understand and what it really meant was for Jinta to generally open himself up again to different emotions like enjoying himself with his friends, to laugh when he's happy, to get angry when he is, to cry when he's lonely, etc?   And the day Menma died, Menma called for the Super Peace Buster to fulfill that wish but unfortunately, due to Yukiatsu and Anaru's plan to tell everyone what Jinta feels about Menma, (which apparently Menma and Tsuruko knew about) it failed and led to Menma's death. How did she plan to fulfill that promise that day?   Was it explained or not? Or is it overlooking on my part? "
1338,What does C.C and V.V stand for?,"Disclaimer: I am not asking about speculation on C.C's (or V.V's) real names  In Code Geass, C.C implies that she abandoned her real name and has since forgotten it     Lelouch, do you know why Snow is white? it's because it has forgotten it's name   When talking to Lelouch about if she was human she says that if she wanted to be seen as human she would have a more human name, as if she hinting that her name C.C was something she chose. V.V also shares the same kind of name but nothing is ever said about it.  in Etrian Odyssey Untold, the AI in charge for firing Gungnir and Ricky's friend is named Mike however is spelled as M.I.K.E which stands for Memetic Installation Keeper Engine.  So i am wondering, does C.C and V.V stand for anything? "
1339,"How is the title of ""National treasure"" attained?","Ushio Hinomaru is one of the ""National treasures"", with the special title of ""Onimaru Kinutsuna"", along with a bunch of other very strong wrestlers, but at how was the title awarded?   Because Hinomaru ghosted at some point but still retained the title, How was that possible? How does it work and is it a lifetime kinda award? "
1340,Is it Boundman or Bounceman?,"Luffy displayed Gear Four for the first time against Doflamingo and called it a specific form.  Via Funimation subs I thought this form was called Bounce Man.  The wiki calls it Boundman.  Is one of these two names offically correct? If Boundman is correct, what is this referring to? "
1341,Ubiquity of Totoro,"Why is the image of Totoro (from ""My Neighbor Totoro"") so common? Even outside anime, background drawings can include Totoro dolls or posters.  Is it just a question of marketing or is there something special about the figure or character? I wonder if Totoro (as a toy or image) is even better known than the movie. "
1342,What is the name of this piano piece from Yuri on ICE!!! in episode 1 before History Maker?,"I was wondering what is the piano piece that was played before the OP starts in this episode?  The duration is approximately between 0:00 - 0:19.  I know that it was not included in the Oh Sketra!!! album, but it may be included in this album. "
1343,Why can Hiratsuka-sensei not get married?,"I am asking this because I could not find a related post anywhere. From what I infer from the source material, Sensei is a woman who is unusual for her age and gender. Not only does she have childish tastes, she is tomboyish. Even when acting like an adult, she resembles an old man, in Hikki's words. Hikki himself wonders about it when hanging out with her, esp. when driven by her in her aston martin. She also had several failed marriage interviews from what I read in Volume 5 and seems to attract ""hobos"" who took away her furniture.  Is her tomboyish/masculine nature the reason for putting off potential suitors? Does her nature also clash with the expectations of femininity in Japanese culture? "
1344,Is Beelzebub's main focus on comedy or storyline?,"I have started watching Beelzebub anime. The anime is very funny, and I feel there is a plot in it.  Does this anime have a real plot or is it just a comedy like Gintama?  By a real plot, I mean that the story is more important than the comedy (One Piece for example).  So, is it leaning towards One Piece or Gintama in terms of plot?  "
1345,How did Binchou-tan's grandmother die?,It seems like it may have been hinted at in one of the flashbacks (there were a few of them in the last episode) and it always seemed like it had something to do with that tree that Binchou-tan's always looking at (and writes a letter at the end).  Did her grandmother die at the tree? Did she die of old age or was it sudden (like getting attacked by a wolf)? It seems weird that she'd abandon Binchou-tan in the middle of the woods if she knew she was dying. 
1346,Who is this man whose face appears randomly?,"Throughout Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei, there's a picture (not animated) of a bald man's face that appears randomly (often as a censor). Who is he and what is his relation to the show (or their creators)? Does he randomly appear in other Studio SHAFT shows?     "
1347,What kinds of activities can be found in a Manga/Anime Club?,"We have a very popular Manga Club at our library.  The kids are interested in lots of different Asian cultures so we include cultural topics in our club such as Korean Word of the Day, Japanese Word of the Day and Chinese snacks like shumai and black sesame cookies. Other activities include a blog, dramatic reading and watching videos.  What other kinds of activities can be found on manga/anime themed clubs? In Asia, China, Europe, and/or America? This is for high school students.  "
1348,"What is Yotsugi Ononoki reading in ""Hitagi Rendezvous""?","In ""Hitagi Rendezvous"", Araragi speaks to Ononoki after Senjougahara proposes a date for the next day. Ononoki is shown reading something while lying on Araragi's bed.    Do we know what she is reading? Does it correspond to any work that exists in real life? I tried Googling アガジソ, which I believe to be the correct order of the katakana on the cover and spine, but there weren't any results that made sense to me. (It makes more sense for the katakana on the cover to be read right to left than for the identical string of katakana on the spine to be read bottom to top.) "
1349,What happened to Suguru at the end?,"At the end of Mahoromatic (second season), what happened to Suguru?       After Mahoro dies, the final episode reveals that Suguru was so distraught over Mahoro's death that he becomes a cyber bounty hunter who hates robots now. So he was wounded after being betrayed by his partner and then he sees Mahoro again. We know she died, but not in a way one normally would. We find that she has become the ""Id"" (I may be remembering incorrectly these terms) of humanity, so she's sort of still around. Does Suguru die and he's just hallucinating Mahoror or is he somehow metaphysically reunited with Mahoro?  "
1350,Is Guy's 'Air Walk' (8th Inner Gate Guy) and Sanji's Sky Walk similar?,"In Naruto: Shippūden, Might Guy opened the highest gate, the Gate of Death, in order to battle Madara and, surprisingly, it also enabled him to 'walk' on air by using kicks.  On the other hand, various characters in the One Piece universe have shown a very similar ability: members of CP-9, CP-0, some warlords, and Vinsmoke Sanji (after the 2-year time skip).   Also, I noticed that each kick has some 'musical tone', and in both cases, the style is very similar. Did Oda and Kishimoto inspire each other? Or were these ideas both inspired by someone else? "
1351,How are Akkis (fiends/ogres) immune to death-feedback?,"In Shinsekai Yori (From the New World), humans with Cantus powers are prevented from attacking each other by:   Mental Restraints: It prevents humans from intentionally attacking other humans. Death Feedback: If a human kills another human, the attacker dies as well.   This is what keeps humans with Cantus powers from destroying each other.    Akkis (translated as: fiends (UTW subs), ogres (Crunchyroll)) are mentally unstable and are able to break the mental restraints. So they have no problem attacking other humans. But what about the death feedback?  How are they immune to death feedback? What makes them different from normal humans? "
1352,What happened to Metal Lee's Mother?,"Metal lee is Rock lee's son and that is pretty obvious based of the similarities between both of them but what about his Mother?     At first, I thought it was Tenten because she seemed like the ""best available option"", but then, since she has not really been an active ""mother figure"", I'm guessing that's not the case.  And if she were his mother then she would have been more involved in his life. Except maybe there's a basis for her absence?     Also, is there a reason why his Mother's identity is not elaborated on?  "
1353,What character is Mio's doll from?,"In K-ON!, Ritsu found a doll (belonging to Mio) of an old man who's almost bald with a huge nose.  If I'm not mistaken, it was shown when they were cleaning their club room.    (season 2, episode 2, 4:54)  Who is that old man doll? Was that doll based from a real person or from another anime or just a random creation from K-ON! itself? "
1354,Who is Domo-kun?,Who is Domo-kun? Is he an anime character or a manga character? I often see him in anime stores so I wonder if Domo-kun is an anime character or a manga character?    
1355,Why are Kobato's eyes inconsistent in color between episodes?,"In Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai, Kobato (Kodaka's sister) appears to have Heterochromia iridum.  Her right eye is red and her left eye is blue.    But in episode 5 of the first season, both her eyes are blue.    What gives?  Is she wearing contacts? I wasn't able to find an explanation for this from the Anime. "
1356,Why do many characters tend to have crazy hair colors and styles?,"It's fairly common that anime characters tend to have ""wilder"" hair than most people we see in real life. This can be seen as far back as Neon Genesis Evangelion (though somewhat mild) from the 90s (though some older anime, like Akira, do not have this characteristic).  The ""wilder"" hairstyles tend to have interesting colors from throughout the rainbow (pink, blue, green, etc.) that are only seen in real life with dyes or highlights. They also tend to be spikier, another trait not seen in real life (probably because gelling one's hair that way every day is quite tedious).    Why do anime and manga characters tend to have this spiky, colorful hairstyle? What is the cultural origin of such a style? (And did the growing trend of Japanese teenagers spiking their hair in a similar style originate from this?) "
1357,How do alchemists draw transmutation circles?,"In FMA, alchemists draw transmutation circles that are made up of perfect circles and regular polygons.     Is it ever show how they make perfect circles and entirely equal angles? I know that it is difficult to free-hand draw things like that. Is anybody ever shown using rulers/compasses, or is it just understood that they are all able to free-hand circles/polygons without them? "
1358,"Is ""Kiyosumi High School Mahjong Club"" from Saki a real-life organization?","According to MyAnimeList (see Producers section), AnimeNewsNetwork, CrunchyRoll, and a number of less reputable sites, an organization called ""Kiyosumi High School Mahjong Club"" took part in the production of the Saki anime. For anyone not familiar with Saki, it follows the Mahjong club from Kiyosumi high school as they compete to be the best in the nation. The websites listed all included ""Kiyosumi High School Mahjong Club"" under production, which is unusual for in-universe organizations.  First, can anyone confirm that this is legitimate and not just an elaborate trolling attempt (e.g. by screencapping the credits)? And if so, what does the organization do? Is it a real high school mahjong club which was used as inspiration for Saki, or were they involved in some aspect of the production process, or were they just thrown in as a sort of shout-out, or something else? "
1359,Are there any other uses for a Pokeball besides capturing and storing Pokemon?,"Can a Pokeball be used for things other than storing pokemon?   Like a ""Hoi-Poi Capsules"" from Dragon Ball or even to imprison humans? "
1360,What is the color of a manga paper?,"The background color of a manga paper when scanned online is changed by the scanlators to white (#FFFFFF).  However, this is not the background color in an actual manga book. the color in the manga book looks little grayer in the paper.  What I am trying to do, is to publish a manga online with the same real background color.   What is the best estimation of that white-gray color? What are the manga papers made of? They are not the same as a normal white printer paper.   "
1361,How did Cell survive and teleport back after blowing himself up?,"In the episode where Cell (in his 2nd form) was trying to blow himself up along with the others, Goku teleported him to King Kai's planet to prevent him from destroying Earth.   How did Cell get back to Earth after self-destructing, while Goku and King Kai were killed? Not only that, how he was he able to stay alive in his 3rd or perfect form? "
1362,What is the purpose of characters shouting out the name of their attack?,"It seems to me that in a lot of anime (Naruto, Dragon Ball, Gurren Lagann, and Digimon are four that come to mind), characters or creatures who perform an attack tend to shout its name, almost as if necessary to perform such an attack. This seems very counterintuitive—telling your opponent that you're about to use a fireball would open you up to being blocked very easily.    Why do anime characters tend to shout the names of their attacks? (Bonus points: Has this spread into Western animation?) "
1363,Did Kishou Arima know about the dragon Kagune?,"Spoiler Alert!.  Arima Kishou made a very ""interesting prediction"" that if Humans accepted Ghouls then at some point, all Humans would become Ghouls. And later on in Tokyo Ghoul RE season 2, episode 10, we see a bit of his prediction actually happening.  However, I don't undestand how Humans can be ""infected"" into being Ghouls, the Kakhous are the organs that produce the Rc cells so even if a human is exposed to RC cells that shouldn't expressly make them a Ghoul because they would still lack the organ that physically manifests the Rc Cells?   Also why is Kaneki's Dragon Ghoul form still active? The real Kaneki, who was the source of the Dragons RC cells was taken away so how can the Dragon keep producing Humanoid monsters (the dragon orphans) that explode to release ""Rc cells""? Cause the Dragon is Kaneki's Kagune from mutation and Cannibalism right? I'm kinda like super confused.     Also, did Arima actually foresee Kaneki turning into the Dragon? If not then How could he make such a spot on prediction.   I dont read the manga and I also don't mind spoilers.  "
1364,Is it impossible for Goku and Vegeta to turn Legendary Super Saiyan?,"So from the spoilers of Dragon Ball Super Broly, apparently,       for a second Vegeta's hair turns green   Is it impossible for Goku and Vegeta to turn Legendary Super Saiyan? In the non canon movie (the original movie) it was made apparently that it was, but with the Dragon Ball Super series/ Dragon Ball Super Broly, is there anything that proves that Goku and Vegeta can't turn into Legendary Super Saiyan? "
1365,Where can I watch all episodes of Kiteretsu Daihyakka in English?,"Where to watch all episodes of Kiteretsu Daihyakka in English? Are they available for purchase? I loved this cartoon a lot. Unfortunately, it stopped showing up. "
1366,Was CosPrayers deliberately bad?,"If you've seen CosPrayers, you probably remember it as one of the worst anime you've watched. The story made no sense, with many important story elements being cut out entirely. The characters had no personality, terrible acting, and their actions didn't make sense. There was pretty much no explanation for what was happening either. The camera angles were strange. The random fanservice also kills any attempt at a serious tone, but the show seems to be trying to take itself seriously. It's just all-around a bad show. Wikipedia even claims that the show spawned a minor meme ""Worse than CosPrayers"" to describe incredibly terrible shows.  If that were all, then we could just write off the show as one of anime's great failures, but the abomination continued with Smash Hit! (Hit wo Nerae!) and LOVE♥LOVE?. These series were aired in sequence immediately after CosPrayers and produced by the same people. In them, CosPrayers is a live-action television show, and both shows are about the production of CosPrayers. It is plagued with numerous problems, including poor management, lack of experience of the producers, unsuitable content, and even actresses seducing the screenwriter to try to get more screentime.  If a real show was plagued with so many problems, I imagine the result would be pretty bad. So it's almost understandable why CosPrayers was so bad, especially if it was intended to add to the story of the other two series. However, if that was their goal, I'd imagine that airing CosPrayers last, rather than first of the three, would be the better approach. It's also rather unbelievable that a studio would create a bad show deliberately, since I can't imagine they'd expect to make money off of it. Still, the show seems almost too bad to be true, and some forum posts online claim that it was deliberately made that way to match the other two series better.  Is there any evidence suggesting that CosPrayers was made to be a bad show, and the problems plaguing it were deliberate? Or is this just ""fan"" speculation? "
1367,What does the German say in the opening of ef - a tale of melodies?,"The OP sequences for ef - a tale of melodies have a lot of German text in the background. The text seems to be the same for all of the different versions. This version is from episode 6, and features the instrumental version of the song (Ebullient Future) and the characters are not present, so it's the easiest to read the text:  [website]I think it's pretty safe to assume this isn't totally random German text. What does it say (in English), and what is it referencing? "
1368,Why did Majitani's surrender not count in his Trick Tower fight with Kurapika?,"In episode 9 of the 2011 version of Hnter x Hunter, Kurapika's fight is with the prisoner Majitani.  They agree to a battle to the death.  Once Majitani realizes he is hopelessly outmatched, he says ""I surrender!"" (time code 18:41)  Kurapika is already in the process of punching him, and knocks him out. The surrender is never acknowledged, and there is a verbal dispute over whether Majitani is dead.  The other prisoners claim that Kurapika's match must end before Leorio's can begin. Majitani's surrender is never brought up by either side.  One might argue that in a death battle, surrender is irrelevant.  Yet the first match, between Tonpa and Bendot, was also a death battle.  Tonpa was allowed to surrender. Presumably this was because when the examiner Lippo explained the rules, he stated, ""A winner is declared when the opponent admits defeat"" (episode 8, time code 14:17).  (following paragraph added next day) Everything Majitani said and did prior to and during his match with Kurapika was meant to intimidate. Calling for a death match was part of that strategy. He knew he was not really a strong fighter, so I believe his goal was to get Kurapika to surrender.  Why did Majitani's surrender not matter?  One might claim that no one heard it, not even Kurapika. But then dramatically, what was the point in having the surrender in the first place? If it's just going to be there, unexplained and unmentioned, it will just cause some nerd to come to a q&amp;a site and ask about it.  If a tree falls in the forest ... "
1369,Parody brand names in anime,"Why do anime use parody brand names in their series, and what benefit do anime like Code Geass and Darker than Black get when they use original brand names like Pizza Hut? Do they get paid for promoting the brand? If not, so they have to pay the company for copyrights? What benefit do the anime/manga artists get in the end? "
1370,How is this game where you write a kanji on your hand supposed to work?,"In Episode 6 of Bakuon!!, the Bike Club girls play some sort of strange game to decide who's going to organize the race they're holding for the school festival.          Hane: We're deciding by the popular vote system that Onsa-chan came up with. We each write a character on the palms of our hands, and whoever has the most wins.   Raimu and Hijiri both write 金 (gold) on their hands, which somehow means that Hijiri wins and that her idea has to involve ""gold"" somehow, which leads her to create a betting pool for the winner of the race.          Hijiri: I win with the most, which means...I'll be in charge of this matter.   Onsa: But how do you make the race more exciting with gold?   How is this game supposed to work? According to Hane, ""whoever has the most wins"". The most what? It looks like ""the most people writing the same character"". But then why does Hijiri win, and not Raimu, who wrote the same character? (Aside from the reason that it's hard to organize a race when you can only communicate by writing on a notebook and no one officially recognizes your existence.)  Also, if you're allowed to pick any character, the odds of any of the 50,000 kanji in the Dai Kan-wa Jiten, or even any of the 2,136 Jouyou kanji, getting a majority among five people are quite low. Initially I thought the characters were limited to days of the week, but Rin picked 銀 (silver), which isn't a day of the week.  Since Hane mentions that Onsa invented this game, I assume it isn't a real game, but maybe it's based on something, or was explained more fully in the manga. "
1371,"In yaoi anime, why does the uke always say 'senpai'?","I wasn't exactly sure how to phrase the title but in yaoi animes, why does the uke refer to their love I guess as senpai?  For example, wouldn't it make more sense to say 'I love you Takano' rather than 'I love you senpai'?  Is this a Japanese language thing or is it better to just say senpai rather than their actual name? "
1372,How could Kakashi use Susanoo?,"There are two reasons I have this query (spoiler alert!):      Firstly, Obito didn't have Susanoo. Considering you need to awaken both Tsukuyomi and Amaterasu, while Obito never used even one of them, how was Kakashi able to use Obito's eyes to produce Susanoo? If he copied Susanoo, then how did he do that? Is it even possible to copy something like Susanoo?   Secondly, not being of the Uchiha bloodline, he faces immense problems in using even a single eye for long periods of time. He almost lost half his chakra by making a lightning clone against Deva Path. On top of that, now he has both eyes after a long drawn battle fighting the likes of Zetsu, Obito, Madara and now Kaguya, how is he even supposed to stand?  "
1373,Who are the germa 66?,Just finished reading the chapter 828 and I have to say the germa 66 has me blown away.   Who exactly are they? Are they pirates? Are they nobility like the tenryubito?   Did I miss a chapter or something? Can someone fill me in?

1376,What is the name of this really funny anime?,Video here. (4:37 long)  Does anyone know what anime it is? Also additionally (from the same video) does anyone know if this is an actual Boy's Love Manga? Does anyone know the English translation of the title in the picture? Is it even a real life manga that I can read?   
1377,Why didn't Light kill Mello?,"In Episode 29, the NPA tries to capture/kill Mello. Soichiro Yagami gets the Shinigami Eyes and tells Light that Mello's real name is Mihael Keehl. So, Mello escapes because Soichiro Yagami couldn't kill him. But didn't Light know Mello's face?  It's mentioned that no matter how exact the drawings are, you can't see the names of the person with the Shinigami Eyes. But Light knew Mello's name was Mihael Keehl, he also knew how he looked like because of that girl who draws Mello's and Near's faces.  Also, one of the first rules of the death note states:     This note will not take effect unless the writer has the person's face in their mind when writing his/her name. Therefore, people sharing the same name will not be affected.   Light knew how Mello looked like. He also knew his name was Mihael Keehl.  Why didn't Light kill Mello? "
1378,What's the purpose of the dance that Narancia did in Golden Wind?,"I followed JoJo's Bizarre Adventure anime this season, it has 39 episodes total. It's currently on episode 11 (as of December 14, 2018).  I am confused with the dance that Narancia did with Fugo and Mista, while torturing Zucchero's head that got separated from his own body but was still alive, thanks to Buccelati's Stand: Sticky Finger.   What's the purpose of that dance and music towards Zucchero? When I tried to hear the music, it sounds like it's not a Japanese song, I didn't know what language they used. Does the dance have references from real life dance? Or is it just an original dance? Here is the scene when Zucchero got tortured. "
1379,How much of the manga did the Arslan Senki anime cover?,I finished watching Arslan Senki and am wondering:   How much of the manga did it cover? Are there any differences between the manga and the anime?  
1380,How do hybrids (half-humans and half-ghouls) rate in strength compared to normal ghouls?,"In the anime series, there are several types of hybrids: artificial half-ghouls like Kaneki, biological half-ghouls like Eto and half-humans like Arima. How are they supposed to rate in strength compared to regular ghouls? Are they stronger, weaker or have equal strength? Is this stated in the series? "
1381,How does Griffith's dream have anything to do with becoming a demon lord?,"Warning: Spoilers Ahead!  I just finished Berserk, and I'm left sitting here in confusion. I tried finding the answers on the wiki and forums, but had no luck. Came here in hopes of finding a Berserk fan online.    Griffith dream was to become a ruler of a kingdom, but at what point did his dream all go to hell? What exactly am I missing in the story that says ""My dream is to rule humanity!""?  How did demons originally get involved in all this...? "
1382,Why was 4th Hokage chosen when the 3rd was still alive and capable?,"A few examples:  4th Hokage: He was nominated and chosen when 3rd Hokage was still alive and was capable of fighting (courtesy: 9-tails attack on Konoha)  5th Hokage: after the Third Hokage deceased.  4th Raikage: After the Third Raikage deceased.  I thought the next Kage would only be chosen after the previous Kage's death. But that wasn't the case for 4th Hokage! Was he strong enough to be believed to take over Third? Was it because the Third believed he was too old ?  Btw, the Third continued to be Hokage after 4th was deceased!  I have never come across an info that notified the 4th Hokage's nomination.. "
1383,"Why did Mumei ""need to go to the toilet""?","In episode 10 of Kabaneri, Biba (aka. the Liberator) visits the local lord. He takes his Kabaneri with him, including Mumei.  As soon as they arrive, Mumei claims she needs to go to the toilet, then uses that excuse to run all the way back to the station's gates and open them.  What I didn't understand was why Mumei needed to accompany Biba in the first place. Since opening the gates was part of a grander plan devised by Biba himself, wouldn't it have been simpler to just leave Mumei behind?  Even from a purely political point of view, there doesn't seem to be any reason for Mumei to act. Unlike Biba, she's not a particularly important (political) figure; she wasn't born in a particularly rich or notable family, and although she calls Biba ""brother"", the two of them aren't officially related. Her absence would likely have gone unnoticed by the lord and his retainers. And even if her absence had drawn attention...      all of the witnesses would've been either murdered or kidnapped by Biba.     What was the point of taking Mumei along, then have her make up an excuse to run all the way back to the gates, instead of leaving her behind? "
1384,Is the nature of chakra hereditary?,"It's been observed that the nature of the chakra a person possesses is determined by the village they are from.  For example, people from Iwagakure (Village Hidden in the Rocks) use earth release techniques, while people from Kirigakure (Village Hidden in the Mist) possess water-type chakra.  There seem to be exceptions, though.  For example, let's consider Konoha : Naruto possesses wind-type chakra while Kakashi and Sasuke possess lightning. Sasuke also possesses fire.  Is it hereditary, or is there something else that determines it? Or is it random?  The 5th Mizukage possesses 3 types of chakra elements: Earth, Fire and Water. If my supposition is correct, how she could achieve this? "
1385,Could a person do the shinigami deal without losing half his lifespan?,"Quick question, if you trade half of your life for shinigami eyes and it happens to save your life, would you lose only half of the time you would have lived, or would you somehow lose half of the life that you would actually live since the eyes saved your life?  Bad example:    1 and 2 in a room 2 has 1's name and is about to write his name down in his Death Note 1 doesnt have 2's name and can't write his down in his Death Note 1 would only have about 30 seconds to live 1 Trades half of his life for Shinigami eyes 1 Writes 2's name down without him knowing and before he writes 1's name down.   Would 1 have 30(-15) seconds to live, or x(÷2)? And there's always the possibility of having his full life and only losing 15 seconds, x(-15). "
1386,Why do cosplay competitions require prerecorded dialogue?,"From local performances to bigger contests like EuroCosplay, many cosplay performances require you to prerecord your music and dialogue.  Usually it is part of the rules for participation. What is the reason for this requirement? Surely a 'live' dialogue would make the act seem more convincing - rather than cosplayers having to lip sync.  I understand mic's aren't great if you have giant lobster claws or something - but microphones can come pretty small now and could fit in a helmet. Even still, why restrict all cosplayers?  Why does this rule exist? "
1387,Why didn't Zoro use his Bandana in dressrosa arc?,Not only has he not used his bandana against Pica but is hardly shown wearing it on the arm.. I can't recall if he even had it on the arm.. He usually wears it to defeat the enemies but this time.. Why the exception? Is it because it doesn't look good on the suit he was wearing? If it was the reason it would be the stupidest reason ever! I Might be missing something.. Maybe.. 
1388,Any more HxH stories or episodes out there?,"I've watched all 148 episodes of the Hunter x Hunter anime, and even the movie ""The Last Mission."" Now I want to know if there is anything else to watch? Are there any more movies, or maybe some new episodes coming out? "
1389,Why does Miki keep pulling out a stopwatch?,"I'm currently on episode 10 of Revolutionary Girl Utena, and I've noticed that at certain points someone (most likely Miki, if I'm not mistaken) will pull out something that looks like a stopwatch or a counter. (This happens in the beginning of episode 10 when the Student Council is discussing the next duelist, and also happens earlier in some of the points concerning Nanami.) Some sort of clicking sound will accompany this.    But I'm not really sure what this is supposed to signify (if anything). Is Miki counting something, or is this supposed to just set the tone for something? If so, what is this ""something""?  Update: In episode 11, Miki pulls out a stopwatch again after asking Touga if he's just treating his sister like a pet (in the translation I was watching) and states a ""time"" of 6.54 seconds. But I'm still not sure what he's counting. Afterwards, the discussion immediately goes back to Nanami's loss to Utena. "

1392,What happened to the aliens in Italy?,"Gantz usually bring back people after they kill all the aliens, but when Kurono's team sent to Italy (chapter 291) Gantz sent them back to Tokyo even when the aliens were still there. So what happen with the aliens in Italy? Did they go away or what?  I didn't watch the anime, so I might be missing something here, or maybe there's some explanation ahead? I have already finished reading the manga, but maybe I missed something. "
1393,How did humans learn how to kill Titans?,"In Attack on Titan, how did humans learn the Titans' weak spot? How was it that they learned how to kill Titans?   Was it through experiments with live, captured Titans?   The only example I could think of where humans successfully captured live Titans and managed to get them within the walls was when they captured Sawney and Bean. But, during the time they had Sawney and Bean up until their untimely deaths, humans were already actively aware of the Titans' weak spots, which was the back of their necks (which could be cut/sliced/attacked).  I am rewatching Attack on Titan now and am currently on Episode 1. I may have overlooked something the first time I watched (hence I am rewatching it) but I am quite positive this might not have been answered.  So how exactly did humans learn/discover how to kill Titans? I still don't quite understand this. Manga answers are perfectly acceptable. ;) "
1394,Why did Cell and Frieza keep their bodies after they died?,"I thought only kind people who have great achievements could keep their body in hell or heaven so that they can continue to improve; Kami said that when Goku died the first time. But why did people like Cell, Frieza, Dr. Gero (and this one can't even fight!) keep their bodies? What's more, Baby didn't show up in hell. Why did all of this happen?  And why did Chi Chi keep her body when she died? She was sent to heaven in a flower ground with some other people when Goku was fighting Majin Buu. "
1395,Why did Emilia give Subaru a fake name on the first time they met?,"On their first encounter on a timeline that was later reset, Emilia told Subaru her name was Satella. We then found out, after the first (or second?) reset, that that is the name of the Jealous Witch, and something of an insult to call someone else — Emilia reacted badly when Subaru called her out by that name after a reset and they hadn't yet met.  So why did Emilia tell Subaru that was her name that first time? "
1396,Why do SMPTE colour bars block part of Ryou's face in episode 13?,"In the beginning of episode 13 of Anime de Wakaru Shinryounaika, Ryou's face is partially covered by a triangle with the SMPTE colour bars:    At first, Ryou just keeps talking as if everything is as expected. But then he seems to notice this blocking his face, and so he tries to step away from behind this triangle so that he isn't blocked by it, though the triangle follows him around:     In either situation, neither Asuna nor Himeru seem to paid any mind to the triangle with the SMPTE colours.    Then, it simply goes away, and it's as if it never happened. No one makes mention of it again, nor is it explained.  Was this a reference to something else I missed? What was the meaning of having partially blocked Ryou's face with a triangle with the SMPTE colour bars? "
1397,What was Eren's vision about?,I can't believe I missed this three times. I went back to the beginning of AoT in episode 1 and noticed these scenes that occurred at the beginning of the episode. Eren is having some type of daydream or nightmare before waking suddenly with Mikasa leaning over him. Here are the still shots of it.                 What exactly were these visions? Were they some type of compressed/hidden memories? What was the farm house we saw? I am also pretty sure this wasn't in the anime but manga answers are welcome also. ;)  Note: I couldn't find a video link to give but there is a animated GIF version of it that I made here. Also helpful but it is quite easy to see the scene if you want to since it occurs straight after the opening of AoT in episode 1. 
1398,Are Kale and Broly's transformations the same?,"So in the anime series we were introduced to Kale who many labeled ""female Broly"". Vegeta makes some comments about her possibly having ""the true super saiyan"" and we see her transformation with white eyes, bulky form and green hair and aura. And now we have the official version of Broly, with a transformation which in some sense looks the same, but different perhaps for artistic / animation style reasons. Are these transformations the same? Is there hard evidence that now they have the same transformations or may be now Kale and Broly's tranformations will be treated like different super saiyan transformations? "
1399,"Was the phrase ""Zawsze in Love"" generated using Google Translate?","In chapter 216 of the manga, it was revealed that the title ""Zawsze in Love"" was actually a mistranslation from an translation program. It didn't specify whether it was done using Google Translate or any other translation program.  The first volume of Nisekoi was published in 2011. At that year, Google Translate was not as good as it is now. I don't know the quality of Google Translate's Japanese to Polish translation in 2011 since I don't use Polish and never learned it, so there was no reason for me to translate from Japanese to Polish. My question is, has the author ever mentioned what translation program he used so that he ended up with the phrase ""Zawsze in Love""? Or did he generate the phrase himself and used translation program as an excuse in the story?  Note that I'm not asking about the meaning of ""Zawsze in Love"", which already explained here. I'm asking about it's origin. "
1400,Why is Suzuha pre-destined to die in 2000?,"Suzuha inevitably dies in 2000 after traveling back to 1975 to obtain the IBN.  It doesn't create any paradoxes, so there is no reason why she can't live to 2010 as long as Suzuha doesn't interact with her other self and the lab members until ""August 9th, 2010"" (the date she departs for 1975). Okabe has already demonstrated that you can co-exist with your other self.  Is her death just another convergence of the worldlines? If so, why? What significance does Suzu's death have on the worldline that the ""universe"" demands that she die at that point in time? "
1401,Does Kaido possess any other power other than just being physically strong?,"Kaido (カイドウ) has such incredible strength. But, to be one of the Yonko, it takes strength beyond even an Admiral level and there must be an explanation for Kaido. The most normal person I've known as Yonko is Shanks, but since he possesses incredible and powerfull Haki so it makes sense. But Kaido? Does he have mysterious power other than just being physically strong?  From One Piece Wikia :     Perhaps the greatest sign of Kaido's strength is his apparent   inability to die. He has been caught and tortured 18 times, and people   as powerful as the Marines and other Yonko have attempted to execute   him 40 times. However, he mysteriously survived every single attempt   because every single execution weapon broke when being used on him.   Most notably, Kaido has jumped from 10,000 meters in the sky onto the   ground, creating a massive shockwave strong enough to sink a large   ship nearby, and emerged without an injury; it has even become a hobby   for him to attempt suicide, only for it to fail.   That's not enough explaination about Kaido's power.  Here is the thing, you know Admiral Akainu (赤犬),  possesses the Magu Magu no Mi which grants him the ability to transform his body into terrifying magma and manipulate it at will, he can even afford to crush a land if he wants. But hey, that's not enough to match a Yonko.  So back again to Kaido, Does he have any other mysterious power? "
1402,Do otaku tend to be bullied?,"Otaku in Japan are somehow equivalent to being geek, meaning they are tend to be bullied or looked down upon. That's why some don't admit that they are otaku because of shame. And there are certain cases of otaku becoming a hikikomori, (an example of this is in Welcome to the NHK where the male protagonist is a hikikomori) wherein they isolate themselves or withdraw themselves from society and a NEET (Not in Education, Employment or Training), where they remain jobless. How true are these cases and is it true that most of hikikomori and NEET are otakus (like Misaki Nakahara in Welcome to the NHK)? Or hikikomori and NEET people tend to become otaku (just like Tatsuhiro Sato in Welcome to the NHK)? "

1404,How far along is the anime compared with the manga?,"Episode 596 came out today, and I am having a hard time placing this in the manga's time-line.   Around which chapter would the anime be right now? And would watching the anime spoil the manga for me? "
1405,Does the Magical Star Kanon 100% spinoff fit canonically within the main series?,"Kanon is featured in a manga and OVA anime spinoff titled Magical Star Kanon 100% in Shogakukan's Weekly Shonen Sunday magazine where she becomes a magical girl.  Is this series considered canon or another continuity (like Neigma?! Neo)?   If it is canon, where does it fit in the timeline of The World God Only Knows?   "
1406,What is the hazama in berserk?,In chapter 242 and in several of the chapters before. It is read that guts stands in the world of the hazama. Naturally off the context I assume that it means... spoilers below.     The world of demons that attacks him and casca constantly because they bear the mark of the sacrifice   But what does it actually mean? I'm not sure if I just missed it in a previous chapter or if it was never properly defined. Can someone help me out?  
1407,What figures does the Chaos;Head protagonist have on his shelf?,"In the Chaos;Head Visual Novel, the protaganist's room has lots of anime merchandise scattered around. Behind his PC he has a large set of shelves with anime characters on them:    Some gameplay of this scene can be seen on YouTube  I've also seen this image online, so perhaps one is changed in a remake or a spinoff or a different scene or something?    This one has figurines of Seira, an in-game fantasy anime character, and the other figures seem fairly generic &mdash; so I presume they're not from other shows.  The first image's characters are much more distinctive though and I can instantly recognise Saber from Fate/stay night.  What are the other series represented here? "
1408,Birth of Maria's child in Shinsekai Yori,"After having watched Shinsekai Yori, something is still bugging me.  From what I understood, the council received Maria and Mamoru's bones from Squealer/Yakomaru after they had gone alone in the wilds, behind the Holy Barrier. To me, that would mean that the bones were received only a short time after they escaped.  If they were really dead at that time (the Council says that the bones were DNA checked), then when did they have their child? Did I miss/misunderstand something? "
1409,What technique is used to draw the lifelike backgrounds in the movie Ponyo?,"In the movie Ponyo, the backgrounds (the clouds, pictured below) are not done in a typical anime style. Instead, they are much more lifelike and 3D.    What is the technique used to do this? Is this used in other films or series? "
1410,Does Hisoka know Gon is Ging's son?,I wondered if Hisoka knew if Gon is related to Gin.  Also if it contributes to his rating of Gon?  Do the Zoldycks know who he exactly is? 
1411,Differences between the Gintama anime/manga and the live-action?,"After watching the whole Gintama anime series and the live action movie, I couldnt notice many -if any- differences. Was the part where Gintoki asks to borrow a Gundam in the anime? (I can't remember) . How about the ending fight with Takasugi?  Were there differences between the anime/manga and the live-action plot or did the live action strictly follow the anime/manga story? "
1412,What is the difference between king vessel and metal vessel users?,What is a king vessel? Is it a dungeon capturer that is rewarded with a djinn? Then isn't it no difference from a metal vessel user? 
1413,Why does it seem like Syaoran likes Yukito?,"When Shaoran meets Yukito, he starts to feel embarrassed and blushed at his presence.   I always though he liked Sakura, but when these scenes happened I was kinda confused. Was Syaoran attracted to Yukito? If not, what caused him to feel this way? "
1414,How are things purchased in AoT?,"In Attack on Titans, how exactly was everything paid for? Not once in AoT so far did I ever see any exchanging of currency. For example the Markets:    How do businesses make money then? Is there a type of currency in AoT that they officially use?  For example do they just give away meat for free?    Are Potatoes, Vegetables and cutlery such as plates, bowls and cups free or have I just missed something?    Note: I think food is free for the survey corps or the people that are training to enlist in the army and be able to leave outside of the walls but what about everyone else? Is it free or is it paid for? If it is then whats the currency? Coins, notes (obviously probably not :P) or is there some sort of system where they trade for example their bit of farm land for a lot of cured meat or fish or vegetables for example.  So my question is how exactly are things purchased in AoT? "
1415,Can Fana still summon the Salamander?,"While Fana was being possessed by the ""Eye of the Midnight Sun"", she was able to use spirit magic to summon and control the Notorious fire spirit- Salamander. However, it was the ""Elf fana"" that was manipulating her and using its magic through out the entire time.   Can Fana still summon and control the Salamander? because ideally, it was in her Grimoire but then ""Elf Fana"" was actually the one doing everything behind the scene.     Also, can the elemental spirits die? Asta had previously defeated the Salamander but did he actually kill it?  "
1416,What political power does a Kage have?,"I know that, in Naruto, Kages (such as the Hokage) run the hidden villages (such as Konoha). There are, however, also other people in the world with political powers, such as feudal lords. What political power does a Kage have as opposed to one of the other political leaders in the world? To further that question, where in the hierarchy of all of the political people in the world do they fall? To clarify, do they answer to anybody or command any other political leaders, and if so, in what regards? "
1417,Why do the driving instructors look sort of like wooden dolls?,"In some of the earlier episodes of Bakuon!!, when Hane is getting her motorcycle permit, we see a lot of this driving instructor (who reminds me an awful lot of Pinocchio):    In episode 10, when Hijiri and Chisame are getting their permits, we see three more strange-looking driving instructors:      It seems like there's some sort of joke I'm not getting here. Why do they look like wooden dolls? (Is that even what they're supposed to look like?)  We also learn their names in episode 10, which could prove relevant to answering this question. Respectively, they are: 三等 (Mito), 参田 (Sanda), 木戒 (Crunchyroll claims ""Honke"", but that doesn't look right to me - this one isn't a real name as far as I can tell), and 座保 (Zaho).  "
1418,Are the Dragon Ball Heroes anime and manga supposed to follow the same story?,"After chapter 2 of the manga, and episode 6 of the anime, (after the battle with Cumber to be more precise) Dragon Ball Heroes looks nothing alike, they are fighting different villains. Is it episode 7 of the anime, supposed to be ""filler"" and Dragon Ball Heroes is going to retake the manga or how it is? Is the Dragon Ball Heroes anime said to be based in the manga or not? "
1419,Does Kojou Akatsuki have two kids?,"Does the fourth progenitor, Kojou Akatsuki, have two kids — one with Himeragi Yukina and another one with Asagi Aiba?  Well, when I saw the last episode it did not seem like that to me. However, many sites like Wikipedia claim so.  Can anyone give me definite evidence? (if possible with pictures) "
1420,What does K.Y. mean?,"There's this scene in Nichijou episode one where a Grim Reaper is asking everyone:     Do you know what K.Y. means?   Nobody replies him, maybe because they're scared of him. Finally he asks another reaper dressed in blue, and he replies:     Someone clueless, like you.   Is this supposed to be a joke? I don't really understand what happened.    "
1421,Why did the man steal the protagonist's lump?,"In the 1929 anime Kobu Tori, The protagonist has his facial deformation taken away by the tengu for being good entertainment and a welcome guest.  When the antagonist follows in his footsteps, he goes to the tengu also to get rid of the lump on his own face.    Kobu Tori is a silent film, so I wasn't able to translate the dialogue and I don't understand why does the antagonist steals the protagonist's lump    Is it to return it to him? To sell it?  "
1422,Are Walls Maria/Rose/Sina the only Wall community in the world?,"Okay I was watching Attack on Titan, and I was just wondering if this walled off part of land is the only one in existence? Like, if people were ever to go out past Wall Maria into the rest of the world, would they come across other Humans inside other Walled off communities?  Or is the one in the series the only one on the entire planet?  "
1423,Is getting hit by Perishables/Food worse?,"In Nichijou episode one, Yuuko gets hit by a Kokeshi, and then by an Akabeko on her head. She says that it could've been worse if she were struck by a Perishable, before actually getting hit on the head with a piece of Salmon.  I'm not sure if I get this. Why would it be worse? Why would she even say that? Is this some cultural reference, or am I just reading too much into this?     I should be glad nothing perishable struck me. It could have been worse.     "
1424,Why was Hiou and Kanae's meeting omitted in Skip Beat anime?,"Skip Beat in manga and anime are closely identical, (meaning, what was shown in the manga was shown in the anime during the first part) until such time when Kanae met Hiou.   I watched the anime first before I read the manga so I was shocked at Hiou's appearance (since he was just shown in the ending of the anime).   What was covered in the anime was covered in the manga, except for Hiou and Kanae's meeting. In the anime, after Kyoko successfully finished her PV with Shou (Stage 19: The Last Ritual), the next episode (Stage 20: Invitation to the Moon) is where she was scouted for an upcoming drama.   While in the manga, Kanae and Hiou's meeting happened between those said anime episodes. Why was that part skipped or omitted in the anime?   Is there any particular reason for this or did the production decided to not to include it in the anime since Kanae and Hiou's meeting isn't that significant to the main plot? "
1425,"Death Note, chapter 2 - Website ""The Legend of Kira the Savior""","I am re-reading Death Note and in the second chapter called ""page 2: L"" Raito Yagami found out through the website ""The Legend of Kira Savior"" that he is now known as Kira. In the English scanlations the text of that website mentions the resurrection and the return of Kira. Which would mean that Kira existed before and also that his followers are a group which has existed already and believes that Kira now has come back.  So did Kira exist even before Raito Yagami started his actions of justice?  What do you guys think about this? It makes me so confused that I am now trying to find the answer through researching instead of continuing re-reading the manga... "
1426,How does Nerve Gear work?,"When I watched SAO for the second time, I started to wonder: how does Nerve Gear work?  In SAO, you have all five senses with you, and also when you use the Nerve Gear, you close your eyes. So, how is it possible for the nerve gear to do all this?  Lastly, how does Nerve Gear kill someone? "
1427,Why do the stronger enemies in anime/manga tend to look more human?,"So if the question sounded a bit confusing, allow me to explain.  In media that feature a lot of non-human characters, such as many video games, anime, manga, or movies, the low-level enemies always tend to look blatantly non-human, ie generic monster.  However, as you encounter more enemies, you start to notice that the more powerful the enemy, the more human they look. They might still retain some monstrous features, such as horns, tentacles, claws, etc, but their overall figure is very clearly humanoid.  Let me use some examples to illustrate this observation.  Dragon Ball: Cell has various forms that he transforms into. However, his most powerful form looks the most human.  One Punch Man: The final villain of the first anime season is Boros, an extraterrestrial. Most of his subordinates look very alien-like, such as Geryuganshoop, with the big eyes and tentacles. However, Boros himself looks very human-like, save for the single eye. His hands even have 5 fingers.  Gantz: In the Osaka Arc, the final villain was an alien called Nurarihyon, who just looks like an old man.. His human-like appearance even caused some of the characters to doubt his status. However, his two subordinates look viciously demon-like, and all the other lower-ranked aliens also look very monstrous. Nurarihyon is the strongest of them all, but resembles a human the most. Also, in the final arc, the final alien antagonists are almost identical to humans in appearance, behavior, and civilization. They serve as the final villains since they're the most powerful aliens our humans characters have had to face.  Bleach: The Hollows all look like your average monsters, and are usually not that strong. However, the Arrancar, which are basically Hollows that have ascended and gained new powers, all look like humans, save for a few features. The Arrancar are exponentially stronger than regular Hollows, and serve as the antagonists for a major story arc.   There's a lot more series that implement this trope, and it extends far beyond just anime and manga. I'm just curious as to the reasoning behind it.   Is there some kind of physics-based reason for why stronger enemies tend to be humanoid? Is the humanoid form factor the most optimal one for combat?  Or is this some kind of literary technique that I'm not familiar with? Clearly these creators all have this type of design philosophy in common. "
1428,Where do magical girls get money?,"Magical Girls work a lot, and we never see them working.  They all have a house and usually money to buy stuff too. Where do they find money to pay rent or buy food? Do they steal it? "
1429,Was Kyon in love with Haruhi?,"It was not directly stated in The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya that Haruhi has feelings for Kyon but it can be assumed that she had because of her attitude towards him (like trying to fix her hair in pony-tail since Kyon told her before that it suits her, or having Kyon the only person with her when she subconsciously wanted to change the world).   And it wasn't also directly stated that Kyon had feelings for Haruhi. More frequently, Kyon is shown to have feelings for Asahina instead. Though, there are times that it can be seen that Kyon cared for Haruhi.   My question is, was Kyon in love with (or did he developed some affectionate feelings for) Haruhi? If so, is it possible that that feeling was caused by Haruhi's power and not Kyon's real feelings (since Haruhi can just think of having an esper, time traveler and alien would be great, and it will exist)? If he is not really in love with Haruhi or if he is in love with Asahina, then, why isn't he affected of Haruhi's power (assuming that Haruhi thought that having Kyon in love with her would be great)? Or is it that Haruhi didn't think of something like that (this seems to be impossible since she even dragged Kyon when she was about to change the world) or she's not really in love with Kyon (seems not the case as well)? Or Haruhi's power doesn't affect people's feelings? If Kyon is really in love with her (from the bottom of his heart and not from Haruhi's powers), then how can it be? Was Kyon the exception to Haruhi's rule or Kyon can somehow nullify Haruhi's power?  "
1430,What are the consequences of ignoring Kyubey's contract?,"Girls make contracts with Kyubey - they will have a wish granted in exchange of fighting witches using their new powers.  But, what is the consequence of simply not doing it? What if magical girls simply ignore Kyubey?  It somehow doesn't seem like Kyubey even has the power to kill them, otherwise he could just kill off Homura who keeps ruining his attempts to make a contract with Madoka.  The only thing that occurs to me is that their magic will deplete overtime and they need to kill witches to recharge - but then again I imagine that if they never fight witches they'd never deplete their magic in the first place. "
1431,How does element dominance work in Avatar?,"  Even though I learnt this concept from the Naruto series, it really makes sense:   When you blow (wind), fire will increase... so fire > wind When you throw water on fire, it diminishes... so water > fire When you smash water against it, it will have no effect on solid (earth)... so earth > water And so on...   Following this logic, why can't waterbenders beat firebenders in Avatar (The Last Airbender)?  I also noticed that Aang himself, who is an airbender, could defend against firebending with his airbending skills. (note that I am referring to those earlier episodes when he was just an airbender (season: 1, episode: 1-5))  How does it work in Avatar? Which elements dominate over each other?  Additional Info: few assumptions work in (Naruto) ninja world, that I didn't consider to include in the question because the question is actually focused on AVATAR not NARUTO   Element user's chakra flow matters in chakra domination. Example: Naruto vs  Third Raikage Combination of chakra elements. example: Water+Wind > Fire  "
1432,SAO Kirito immortal in episodes 6 and 8?,An Immortal object badge is shown in direct relation to Kirito's actions. What are these badges referring to? Was Kirito immortal? 
1433,Why does Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicle use the same characters as Card Captor Sakura?,"In the anime Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicles, the main characters have the same name and look like as the characters of Card Captor Sakura.   How was this why is that? Are they allowed to use to use other characters of other anime? "
1434,What does the 'belt' Orochimaru and the Sound Four wear signify?,"The Sound Four wear a purple-colored type of belt or wrap around their waists:    Orochimaru, their master, also wore one:    Being some of the few ninja I have seen wearing one, does it have a formal name? What does it signify and does it relate or exist in real world fighting..? It feels almost sumo-ish, I think. "
1435,"Does ""Evening Get"" correspond to a real-life television show?","In chapter 2 of Orange, Hagita tells his friends that he has go home to watch Evening Get. The text outside the speech bubbles explains it as:     Evening Get! It's a Nagano TV show that starts at 4:30. Ryuta Mine's gonna be on today's show.   Ryuta Mine appears to be a real Japanese actor from Nagano prefecture. Similarly, in ch.5*, Naho and Kakeru's friends give excuses for why they cannot walk home together with Naho and Kakeru. Hagita's excuse that he is going to watch Evening Get. Outside the speak bubble is:     They're doing a story on Mino Monta's son &hellip;   Mino Monta also appears to be a real-life personality in Japan.  With these two instances in mind, does Evening Get correspond to a real-life television show? I have tried a bunch of internet searches but have no found anything of use so far. Perhaps someone who can read the original Japanese text might have more luck? "
1436,What happens to the members of W.I.S.E. near the end of the Psyren?,"Towards the end of the manga,      After Ageha presses Miroku to go a different way to making a society of Psi users,  we are shown an airstrike that flies in and demolishes a huge portion of the forest.  WE actually see Ageha and his friends escape, but there is no mention of Miroku and his  companions.  In the last chapter, it is mentioned that the world ""believes"" they are dead.   Are we to assume that they die? Or is it that they go off into hiding? "
1437,Who is Saber extending her hand to in the ED of Carnival Phantasm?,"In the ED, we see each character (that appears in the show) is connected by (the proximity of) a hand.  Right as the ED of Carnival Phantasm ends, we see Saber extending her hand to someone, but we never see who that person is.  Was the identity of this hand ever revealed? If so, who is it?   "
1438,Did manga from North Korea undergo the same audience changes as in the rest of Asia?,"I was looking at Tongil Tour's website and saw that manga is sold on the streets of the DPRK:    I was able to find one manga that was translated into english and a site that sells books from the DPRK, but all ones that looked like they were manga (manhwa?) were targetted at young children.  The Gekiga movement in Japan started surfacing in 1957, which brought about manga targetted at older audiences and dealing with more gritty subject matters. However, Korea has been divided since 1945  Nowadays both Japanese manga and South Korean manhwa target several audiences. Did North Korean manga miss out on this development and continues to target only children - or are there manga for other readers too? "
1439,Are these two people with the same given name the same person?,"Are Emiya Shirou and Kotomine Shirou the same person?   He looks like Archer/Emiya.  If so, how did he become Kotomine and get a job as Holy Grail War Mediator? "
1440,Are the Chunin exams always held in Konoha?,"I know that all of the villages now hold their Chunin exams together and have since the Third Ninja World War. The only two in-canon Chunin exam that have been seen, however, were held in Konoha. Are all Chunin exams held in Konoha? If not, how is it decided where they are held? "
1441,How does the anime adaptation relate to the other parts of the Joker Game franchise?,"The Spring 2016 anime Joker Game uses, to the best of my knowledge, the same premise as a set of novels by Koji Yanagi. There is also a 2015 live-action film that Wikipedia states is based on the novel, and a manga based on the anime.  How does the anime relate to the previous adaptations in the franchise (i.e. the novels and film)? In particular, to what extent does the content of the film differ from that of the anime? "
1442,What is the origin of this facial expression with one's tongue sticking out?,"I've seen this expression probably a dozen times in anime and manga. There are many variants, but they all have the character's tongue sticking up out of the side of their mouth. Their eyes are also typically big and sometimes in the shape of a backwards の character, or sometimes winking. Here are a few examples, though there are many more:  Bakemonogatari:    Clannad:    Tonari no Kashiwagi-san:    What is the origin of these expressions? Are they referring to a particular art style or character? "
1443,Will I miss anything by watching Dragon Ball Z Kai instead of the other series?,"I've read that Dragon Ball Z Kai is an HD remaster and recut of Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z. However, Kai has 98 episodes while Dragon Ball has 153 and Z has almost 300.  If I watch only Dragon Ball Z Kai, do I miss anything I would get by watching the other two series? And is anything censored in Kai that is not censored in the others? "
1444,Where is Ergastulum located?,"In the anime, Ergastulum has the architecture of a typical Italian city. Yet, the newspaper is printed in English and the cars drive on the right, although road signs and the like do have a European feel to them. The police cars are also reminiscent of LAPD cruisers, in that they are black and white. Finally, from looking at the currency depicted in the anime, it seems that the city prints its own money.    I do remember a scene where a newspaper article shows something happening in Paris, France. So I do think the story takes place on Earth.  I have looked over the Gangsta Wiki and so far it does not seem to have any information on where exactly the city is located. Do we or will we know where Ergastulum is located? Is it its own country? "
1445,"Where did the name ""Kurama"" originate?","On both Naruto and Yu-Yu Hakusho, Kurama is the name of a powerful demon fox.  Does this have some meaning in Japanese mythology or folklore? Or did Yu-Yu Hakusho's author made it up, and Naruto's author ""inspired"" from it? "
1446,Why did Tobi use Kurama in his attack?,"After perfectly timing the Release from Kushina Uzumaki's body, Tobi attacks the village using Kurama, the Nine Tails, in chapter 501.  Why did Tobi suddenly decide to use Kurama to attack the village? He was going to need Kurama for his 'Moon plan' as well. So why did he not just take it and leave? "
1447,Do many anime play the main theme during the final battle?,"While watching an anime series with a friend, he pointed out that ""all anime play their theme song during the final fight."" Now, I doubt it's ""all"", but sure enough, the main theme song of Digimon Tamers and the (first) OP of Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood play during the final epic clash in their respective series. (And I'm sure there are many other examples.)  Do most anime do this? Is there a reason for it (as opposed to just playing a new epic piece)? "
1448,A one shot shoujo manga about a girl who's afraid of boys,"I've been trying to find this particular one shot shoujo manga.   It was about a shy girl with short (red?) hair, who didn't really know how to hang out/deal with boys. An upperclassman who had blond (?) hair from the drama club (?) noticed her predicament. He tried to help her out by going on a date with her to the amusement park. The upperclassman dressed up in different clothing for a stimulation, and he went with the cool ikemen image. They both went on their amusement park date, and the girl gradually fell for the upperclassman. Somewhere along the plot, she thought that she had been cured from her androphobia, but it turns out she was still bad with boys, except for that upperclassman.  The last thing I remember from the manga was that the girl found out she wasn't the only one that the upperclassman was helping. He had other girls ask for make-believe dates, so she felt betrayed, and she probably ran away crying or something. In the end, the upperclassman came to her and said that she was the only one for him, and he promised he would never go on make-believe dates again, all that jazz.  The art was shoujo, similar to Shiraishi Yuki's art.  I've been trying to find this manga for the past 4 months, and I don't know if it's real anymore.   If anyone has any idea what manga this is, would you please let me know? "
1449,When does Black Butler take place?,"In chapter 3 or 4 of Black Butler, Sebastian is using a mobile phone when talking to those guys who are holding Ciel captive.   Is this a mistake by the author or something else? Isn't Black Butler in the 1800s? "
1450,Who's the other Uchiha Danzo mentions while recruiting Torune into the foundation,"Danzo notices young Shino when strolling along with Shino's father and demands that a member of the Aburame clan be donated to the foundation, and he also mentions that an Uchiha member has been confirmed to join the foundation.  Refer to Ep. 317 ""Shino vs. Torune!"", is he/she in any way be this one mentioned on Who is this other Uchiha member?? The reasoning is because when Shino is young, Naruto and Sasuke are young too... so I'm sure that Sasuke's the only Uchiha alive at that point and the foundation always wished to kill all the Uchiha.  Or is it simply that the timeline is just before Uchiha massacre? and the Uchiha member being mentioned is just an ordinary member not worth mentioning? "
1451,Dragon Ball Volume 1 colored and uncensored?,I would like to buy  for my collection a copy of Dragon Ball Volume 1 colored and uncensored or the closest thing.   Browsing I have found so far:   Regular Volume 1 is uncensored but no color pages. Collectors edition has some colored pages but is censored.  Viz Big has some colored pages but is censored and is really big.   I am wrong?  Any other choice?  
1452,Are mangas freeware and shareware?,"I have been a manga reader for a long time, and also a developer. I know about the rules, like manga content can't and should not be edited without the author's permission, etc. But my question is, are they freeware and shareware? Can I just take or download or store or transfer or share content without the author's prior permission? "
1453,How much of the original Sailor Moon anime isn't from the manga?,"While I went through the first 7-8 episodes of the original Sailor Moon, I noticed a few episodes that didn't really advance the plot much. (An example of this would be the episode where Jadeite poses as a radio announcer and sucks the energy out of women who receive fake declarations of love.) I have also found lists of filler episodes on the internet, such as this one, for the original Sailor Moon.  I've also noticed that a lot of ""unnecessary"" plot seen in those episodes of the original anime is cut from Sailor Moon Crystal, though to some extent this also just makes sense given that they have a limited number of episodes to work with.  How closely does the original anime follow the manga? (I understand that they are probably more or less similar in terms of plot, but is there a significant portion of episodes or ""filler"" that's original material and not from the manga?)  Edit: I am referring to the original Japanese anime, not the English (or European) dubs - I already know that those involved quite a bit of censoring of things like nudity or same-sex relationships. I should also add that I just got into Sailor Moon, and so am not too familiar with it. "
1454,What happened to the kidnapped human babies at the end of Shinsekai Yori?,"Shinsekai Yori (From the New World) has just concluded with the season finale.  Often is the case for thought-provoking shows, there are unanswered questions that bug me...  As part of Yakomaru's (Squealer) grand plan, he has his followers kidnap human babies with the intention of raising them to be Akkis* (fiends/ogres) so they can be used to wipe out the human race.    The show ends 10 years after the war. What happened to all those kidnapped babies?  As far as I can tell, the Anime doesn't appear to offer any explanation. Are there any clues to this? Does the novel reveal anything?  *As revealed in the final episode, they wouldn't actually become Akkis. Being raised by the rats, they believe they are rats themselves and thus the Attack Inhibition + Death Feedback will apply to rats instead humans - thus allowing them to freely kill humans. "
1455,How does Saber's summoning to the Fifth Grail War work?,"In the Fate series (I've only ever watched Fate/stay night anime, never played the game), I understand that servants are essentially just a reflection of their former self.   But in the case of Arturia (Saber) that actually is her, to my understanding, before she died she made a pact with The World to be able to be summoned as a Servant to seek the Holy Grail. But during the conclusion of the anime, she speaks of a dream and dies. I assume the dream she speaks of was about having met Shirou, but what about her participation in the fourth Holy Grail war?  I'm just very confused about this scenario as a whole, can someone please help clarify this for me? After watching the series I feel that there's no real closure with her character. "
1456,"In Full Metal Panic, what does Mithril do with the Whispered they rescue?","In the first episode of the first season, we see a Whispered woman being taken away from a Russian facility. Mithril turns up and secures the area before Sousuke injects a sedative into her and takes her away.  We know that Teletha ""Tessa"" Testarossa is a Whispered and works as the Captain of the Tuatha De Danaan while Chidori is relatively left to her own life (under protection).  What does Mithril do with the Whispered that they rescue? Are they put to work like Tessa, or are they relocated and kept safe in the same way Chidori is (i.e., allowed to live a normal life, but monitored)? "
1457,Law regarding doujinshi,"Doujinshi, as defined on Wikipedia, are self-published works. While not all doujinshi are derived from other manga, they mostly are, like the many Touhou and Naruto doujins. The works that they are derived from are mainly those with copyrights, meaning that the characters depicted in those original works are also protected and thus cannot be used without consent of the copyright holders. However, as we can see from Yuru Yuri, Oreimo and the Comiket in real life, doujinshi are sold in Comiket. When they are derived from other works and sold, it means that their use is for commercial purpose, which would be very likely prohibited by the copyright holders. Yet, they keep selling doujinshi in every Comiket and the police ain't doing anything about it.  Thus my question: what is the law behind doujinshi? Does every doujinshi sold in Comiket have a written consent from the copyright holders? Or is it the case that by labeling their works as doujinshi, they are exempted from the copyright law? What about the R-18+ doujinshi? "
1458,"To what extent are Momonga's underlings aware that he's ""from a different world""?","Albedo's conversation with Momonga at the beginning of episode 5 has a few elements that confuse me. Albedo reports to him that they have yet to find any other ""Yggdrasil players"". Later, Momonga tells her that her love for him is a result of him messing with the ""settings"" Tabula specified for her.   Does this mean that Albedo is aware that her entire world used to be just a video game from Momonga's perspective? Did Momonga tell her this, or did she inherently have this knowledge from the very beginning (i.e. when Momonga got transferred into the game world)?

1460,How much does Tessa know about her brother Leonard?,"In the first season of Full Metal Panic, Tessa tells Chidori about her brother, who is a Whispered. In the second season (TSR), Chidori comes across Tessa's brother Leonard. When Sagara is talking to Gauron in the second season, Gauron comments that Amalgam has a Whispered in their highest ranks and we see shots of Leonard.  I am wondering, just how much does Tessa know about her brother? Does she know that he is working for Amalgam? And if not, where did she believe he was all this time? "
1461,"What makes a village a ""Hidden Village""?","In Naruto, there seem to be villages that are ""Hidden Villages"" such as Konohagakure no Sato and villages that are not ""Hidden Villages"" such as Tsuchigumo Village or Tonika Village.

1462,To what extent does Arata become weaker?,"I read on the wiki that he:     gives up his demon element to Anastasia   As I haven't watched that far in the series yet, I'm curious to know the extent of his power loss and if he becomes much weaker from then on? Does he ever get his powers back? "
1463,"Before Tobi/Madara fought Konan, why no one tried to attack him while he's transporting himself?","We now know that Tobi 'materialized' when he's transporting himself. There were some occasions when he's so close to his enemies while transporting:   When Tobi/Madara was wrapped by Yamato's wood style. Kakashi, Yamato, and Naruto were there. After finished talking, Tobi's transporting himself. Kakashi was RIGHT BEHIND HIM with Raikiri, but he(Kakashi) didn't at least try to attack him. After finished talking about his plan in the Five Kage Summit, he's transporting himself IN FRONT OF THE FIVE KAGE and other people there.   I actually have 2 questions:   I understand that they(other people) had tried to attack him for like a million times and failed. But why no one tried to attack him when he's transporting? Why Tobi/Madara was SO CONFIDENT AND CASUAL in transporting himself when his enemies were so close to him? I mean yes he could just immediately stop his transportation if someone who's fast enough tried to attack him, but then it would give a change for his jutsu's secret to be revealed.     P.S. I know his real identity, I've finished the series. "

What kind of will power would it take for her to overcome her father's geass? Did she has to take intensive training or such to do so? How can one overcome the power of geass that was cast on him/her without the usage of Jeremiah Gottwald's geass canceller? Or the geass would automatically be cancelled upon the caster's death?  "
1465,What lays beyond the walls?,"I've always wondered what really lies beyond the walls. The most we've seen of the area outside is the Female Titan arc and the scene that played before the theme in episode 1 of the anime. Both times, we didn't get to see much of anything besides lots of trees.   What else is out there? Old remnants of villages existing before the titans? Other walled countries? "

""    So are these 2 pictures supposed to be Goku new transformation or one is and the other isnt? They have the same hair but different aura, what does that suppose to mean? "
1467,Why did Wraith disguise herself as a man?,"During season 2 (The Second Raid), Chidori is being monitored from afar by a man who we later learn is an intelligence operative by the codename of Wraith. After Sousuke is reassigned, Chidori gets the drop on Wraith and confronts him, but is later shot by Xia Yu Lan.  After Leonard turns up and kills Xia Yu Lan, we find out Wraith isn't dead but that the bullet to the head ripped apart a mask. We see what looks to be a female eye. After the conclusion of the Hong Kong incident, the Mithril intelligence agent who was working with the SRT is talking to a woman who wasn't around before. At the very end, when Sousuke returns to school, this same woman is watching Chidori and Sousuke from afar. Her comments lead us to believe she is Wraith.  Why did Wraith pose as a guy? Was there any benefit to her mission in making people believe she was the opposite gender? "

1469,What are the real-life origins of CPU and CPU Candidates?,"In Hyperdimension Neptunia, Neptunia is based on Sega Neptune. The name of her country, Planeptune is obviously a reference to Sega Neptune. My question is, what console the other CPU and CPU Candidates (Nepgear, Noire, Uni, and Vert) are based on?  Noire means black and her country is Lastation which is based on Sony Playstation. But, PS2, PS3, and PS4 all has black color. PSX/PSOne is excluded since it's gray. Which Playstation console is she based on?  The same can be said about Vert, which means green. There are several variations of XBox. Which one is she based on?  And what about Nepgear and Uni?  EDIT: Considering that Blanc's sister are Rom and Ram, which is obviously a reference to ROM (Read-Only Memory) and RAM (Random Access Memory), it might be possible that Nepgear and Uni refers to a certain peripheral/component/parts of the console. But still, what part? "
1470,Does the mastered super saiyan blue exists in the anime?,"So since the battle with Zamasu Dragon Ball Super manga introduced the concept of mastered super saiyan blue, which it would be a stronger version of super saiyan blue, I guess similar to as super saiyan full power is a stronger version of super saiyan. Now they've used again in the last manga chapter,       making Vegita being able to land a punch on Beerus when using it, and getting Beerus to say may be he could be a god of destruction in another universe, but not in this one.   Then, does this concept of the mastered super saiyan blue exists in the anime? People were arguing before than super saiyan god transformation ""at will"" from Goku only existed in the manga, but now we've seen super saiyan god transformation will appear again in Dragon Ball Super anime episode 104th. Does this mean mastered Super Saiyan Blue will also exist in the anime? "

When Sousuke addresses him, he always calls him ""Your Excellency"" and stands at attention.  He seems totally fine condoning Sousuke interrogating the thug who passed on the message that Chidori had been kidnapped (closing the blinds and not stopping Ren or Sousuke).  While in a school environment, he is a figure of authority, but he is hardly the highest authority with the teacher still above him, and Sousuke never uses similar terms for any teacher.  So why does Sousuke call Hayashimizu Atsunobu ""Your Excellency""? "
1473,Why is it team JNPR if Ren's name is Lie?,"In RWBY, all the teams get their names by using the initials of all the team members first names. But on team JNPR, the members are Juan, Nora, Pyrrha, and Lie Ren. So, shouldn't L be the initial for Lie Ren?  Even though everyone calls him Ren, the team name should use his first name for the initial, so why is he the only one whose last name gets used? "
1474,What are the requirements to wield God ki?,"We have seen quite a bit of change from battle of the gods to the universal tournament arc in super.   So far as I know some supreme kai, Goku, Vegeta, Trunks and gods all can use god ki.   Goku has both red and blue ss forms. While the other saiyans can use or halfway use blue.   Is blue just kind of becoming the next level of evolution for ki? Or are there specific requirements that need to be met in order to tap into god ki?   Has the show or manga elaborated on this at all? "

1476,"How does the Mangekyo Sharingan blind its wielder, and why are some wielders not blinded?","A disadvantage of gaining the Mangekyo Sharingan is that it leads to blindness over time.    Source: Chapter 385, Mangashare/Binktopia scanlation We have seen Madara, Itachi and Sasuke, all wielders of the Mangekyo Sharingan, use Susanoo. All three have gone blind or have worsened eyesight at some point*. Itachi and Sasuke have also been shown using Amaterasu which makes the eyes bleed afterwards.   Danzo Shimura, Obito Uchiha and Kakashi Hatake, also wielders of the Mangekyo Sharingan, on the other hand, have never used any of the above techniques and have never shown any sign of blindness*. Why didn't they go blind or have worsened eyesight?   What causes the blindness effect of the Mangekyo Sharingan? How does the Mangekyo Sharingan eventually blind its wielder?    *Please correct me (or suggest an edit) if I'm wrong. Also, please feel free to suggest edits adding what chapters the events mentioned above happened, so question answerers can review it. "
1477,Is there a way to indicate the action to remove a manga's cover to see the hidden cover?,"Ok, maybe the question can look weird. And actually it is. Let me explain further: a friend of mine removes a lot of times covers from his manga(tankōbon). I don't mean that he actually rips off the cover from the manga, but he removes the dust jacket(or, for me, the first layer) of the colored cover. Under this dust jacket, sometimes, there is another hidden not-colored cover page, that shows author's easter eggs.  I don't have pictures now, but, for example, it happens with some volumes of Monster Musume and Made in Abyss.  I didn't find anything about this on the web, and no one talks about it. So, I was asking: is there a term to describe this practice? Is it frequent to do it between collectors? I am just curious to know about this.  P.S. I know that it's difficult to understand, but I don't speak english natively. I'm sorry for bad english.  Edit: As Aki Tanaka said in comments, also One Piece sometimes has this kind of easter eggs. "
1478,Why Goku uses all the transformations he has except Super Saiyan 3 in the tournament of power?,"is there any reason why Goku uses all the transformations he has in the tournament of power except super saiyan 3? So far he has used,  Super saiyan . Against Caulifla for example.  Super saiyan 2. Against Kale for example.   Super saiyan blue. Against the trio de dangers for example.  Super saiyan god. Against Dyspo for example.   Does super saiyan 3 has a disadvantage over all the other transformations or something? "
1479,What are those lines under some anime characters eyes supposed to be / mean?,"Some anime characters have lines under their eyes. I was wondering what it represents? Is it supposed to be like having dark circles under the eyes like some people in real life or?   Below is a perfect example, both the male and female characters have it so it couldn't be a beauty thing.      What does it mean? "
1480,Would the Inuzuka or Nara technique count as a kekkei genkai?,"Kekkei genkai are considered abilities passed on through bloodlines, from this question: How is a technique characterized as a kekkei genkai? When discussing kekkei genkai, however, people never seem to include clan abilities such as the Nara shadow possession or the Inuzuka collaborative jutsu with their dog partners. Would these (or similar) abilities count as kekkei genkai, and if not, why not? "
1481,How exactly does Akiko's healing ability work?,"In episode 4, we learn that Akiko is the Armed Detective Agency's doctor, when she's healing Junichirou Tanizaki.  Just when she's about to start healing him, she starts taking off her shirt, and though Tanizaki appears to be dreading what's about to go down, she has a grin on her face:    That suggested, to me, that she was about to take some sort of sexual pleasure from what's about to go down.  Then the scene switches to the next room, where Atsushi and Kunikida are, and it sounds like Tanizaki is not really enjoying himself:    But then the noise subsides, and he sighs in what seems like a pleasurable way:    So it made it look like, to me, he was suffering for a while, but ends up taking some kind of pleasure from the process too, like Akiko appeared to be about to take herself.  This section from Akiko's page on the anime's Wikia says:     Akiko is named after a feminist pacifist poet whose work was considered controversial in her time for portraying and encouraging female sexuality.   So, basically, how exactly does Akiko's ability work? What does she actually do to heal someone? It does have some sort of sexual connotation, given the trivia in the Wikia page, right?  Has the manga shed some more light on her ability? Or has maybe the author revealed anything in any other way? "
1482,"What does Gold Lion Shiki say at the beginning of ""Strong World: Episode 0""?","At the beginning of the OVA One Piece Film Strong World: Episode 0, Gold Lion Shiki says something to the Straw Hat crews (YouTube reference), which a certain fansubber refused to translate since they considered it as a spoiler to the related movie One Piece Film: Strong World.

1483,Questions about the time-travel scene in the Steins;Gate movie,"So I watched the Steins;Gate movie and got a bit confused in the end.   Who is that Kurisu wearing the clothes of a 13-year-old girl sitting next to 13-year-old Okabe in the past? When she traveled back and met Okabe at the end, did the world line change to one other than Steins;Gate? So Okabe remembered Kurisu giving him his first kiss. Did his memories change to engrave that event, or is this just a made-up fact from the writer?  "
1484,Social etiquette in anime/manga/pop culture Japan conventions,"When attending anime/manga/pop culture conventions, is there any guidance or any good manners I need to observe?  Is there something specific I need to observe, or is it just like the other ""normal"" conventions? For example, when you meet with a cosplayer or meet and greet with your favorite author, should we get hyped up, or do we have to have a poker face? "

In the end of the movie, she was also able to eat the attack from       the beast that was, in power only, stronger than The 10 Commandments.   How strong is she really to have been able to seal such monsters? Is it me or is the manga pretty inconsistent about power levels? "
1487,"What exactly is ""Paradise""?","In the Wolf's Rain anime, the goal of all the wolves is to reach a vague, nebulous goal called ""Paradise"". While there's a bunch of descriptions about what it looks like or where it is, what exactly is ""Paradise""? Did they reach it at the end of the series?

1488,How different are the manga and anime versions of Bakuman?,"I've been meaning to start watching/reading this series for some time now. However, I am unsure as to what media to choose.    Is there many filler material in the anime? Does the plot get better explained in the manga? Or are they absolutely the same? (meaning watching the anime or reading the manga will always leave me with the whole story)  If there are differences, provided that they do not compose an extensive list, please enumerate them. "
1489,Are Meliodas and Elizabeth still in love after he becomes the demon king?,"When Meliodas becomes the demon king, he becomes cold and blunt towards Elizabeth and even makes a statement that he doesn’t feel anything when she hugs him anymore.  Is that just a result of Meliodas being in his demonic form without his emotions, or has he really fallen out of love with Elizabeth and just wants to end their curses so he can be free of her? Will he want to be with her in the afterlife?  Does he still love her, or is he just keeping his promise to break their curses?  "

1491,Is the physiological progression (evolution?) of Kabane discussed in the manga?,"In the anime Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress, Kabane are shown with physical ability ranging from a slow, zombie-like walk to a high-speed animal-like sprint. In addition, Kabane are shown with various degrees of intelligence, ranging from mindless zombies to leader-types to being able to operate simple machinery.  What's the mechanism behind this variety? Do Kabane grow in strength, agility, and/or intelligence over time? Do their abilities depend on the original individual infected? Is it more related to the circumstances of the infection? Is there an intelligent agent and/or advanced evolutionary process behind it all?  The existence of Wazatori and Fused Colonies seems to indicate some form of guided evolution, but I'm frankly at a loss as to what mechanism could be behind all this.  "

Thanks. :)  PS: I watched the anime series some months ago and I want to now read the manga but I just want to read from where the anime series ended.

1494,Why is there so much nudity in anime and manga?,"I have been watching anime &amp; reading manga since 2 years ago. There are so many good anime and manga, but I find it somewhat strange that there is so much nudity in Japanese TV shows, anime, and manga. Why is that? Is this a cultural thing?  Even in kids shows, there are some adult scene. Not proper nudity (like adult thing), but like Crayon Shin-Chan. In India, Crayon Shin-Chan is censored by cutting the adult scene, but when I see the actual (without censoring) Crayon Shin-Chan, I find some adult things. "

I can imagine that they wanted to separate out all the ""Duel Cards"" parts, because that's what the kids were most likely interested in, but still? Why leave out the last 100 (or so) chapters? "
1498,What really happened at the end of Stone Ocean?,"At the end of Jojo Part 6: Stone Ocean, did Emporio get sent to a parallel universe? Is this the same universe that SBR and JJL then take place in? The wikia says that the universe is reset. What really happened? I'm so confused... "
1499,What are the relations between the level of power and abilities and the promotion of Pawn?,"In chess, pawn can promote to any other chess piece except King and get all the corresponding abilities and power. Similarly, in High School DxD, when Pawn promotes, their power level increases and they get other abilities also. For example, when Issei got a direct hit from Yubelluna's attack, he was protected by the Queen Protection abilities.  Let's take Issei's promotion to Queen (Akeno) as an example.  Are the abilities and the increase in power level the same for all the Pawns regardless of the power and abilities of the actual Queen (Akeno), or do they depend on that of the Queen?  And if Issei is King of his pieces and promotes himself to Queen, gaining abilities and power from both King and Queen pieces, will he be more powerful than Akeno? "

The   fruit has also given Chopper the ability to perceive concepts that a   reindeer would not comprehend, such as medicine. It also allows him to   transform into human/reindeer hybrid forms.   So how about if the fruit were eaten by a human being? Would the effects of Hito Hito no Mi kick in?  And it looks like Chopper ate that fruit by accident? "
1501,Did Kakashi Actually invent the Chidori?,"In the newest filler episodes of Naruto (462 and 465), they show Hagoromo and Indra using some sort of lightning release that looks like the chidori.

1506,When does one become a Super Saiyan?,"As per this Wiki page :     The Super Saiyan transformation comes in response to a need, not a desire.   So does it mean that even if a Saiyan might reach the energy level that a super Saiyan might have, he'll still not get converted to a super Saiyan unless there is a need? Energy level doesn't determine the ability to become a Super Saiyan, but a need to become one does?  On the other hand, as per the discussion on this page, it seems energy level is indeed an important factor.  It's confusing. "
1507,When did Edea die?,"In the third world (Chapter 6), in Sage Yulyana's sidequest to get the Conjurer Asterisk (after awakening 2 crystals) you learn from Dark Knight Alternis Dim, Templar Braev Lee and his wife/Edea's mother Mahzer Lee that the Edea of that world is dead.  However, at the start of the chapter, in a side quest before awakening any Crystals, Black Mage Ominas Crowe was expecting Edea to arrive to serve under his command. Before the fight with Knight Argent Heinkel, he questioned why Edea wasn't with Crowe.  After beating Braev Lee, he said Edea's sword was sent back to after her death. I can't think of why Ominas or Argent would have given a false report considering they just fought Edea and lost, or even how they got a hold of third world's Edea's sword, yet not show any surprise that Edea was actually alive (unlike Braev or Mahzer).  So I am wondering, when did Edea of the third world die? And were the Eternian Sky Knights forces in Caldisla not informed? "

1516,How durable is Natsu Dragneel?,"I've only seen part of the first season of Fairy Tail (up to the end of the lullaby flute battle with the Erigor and that Dark Guild). More specifically, I'm on the episode right after when Natsu and Happy steal the job for the cursed island off the upstairs board at the guild hall.  In the past battle over the Daybreak book, Natsu fought a pair of mercenaries who said that wizards spend so much time harnessing their minds that their bodies are weak, which is their weakness, but after fighting Natsu and his dragon-slayer magic they saw how powerful he was physically.  Exactly how durable is Natsu? Does it scale specifically off of how much fire he has absorbed? Or is his body just naturally tough from training directly under a dragon? "
1517,How does Natsuki Subaru manage to stay mentally sane?,"After watching his friends die over and over again, how does Natsuki Subaru stay mentally sane?   For example: watching his friend die once may already have dire consequences on him. It may emotionally break him down. But repeating it over and over is insane! His perspective on friends could change and he may distance himself due to going through the death of his friends. But how does he remain so positive and mentally sane? "
1518,What is the meaning behind Ginji's vow to Yukio?,"In final arc of the second season of Black Lagoon, in Episode 20 ""The Succession"", when Ginji swears his loyalty to Yukio, heir to the Washimine group, he says, ""although I'm unworthy, I am Matsuzaki Ginji, acting boss of Washimine group. Please allow me to protect you with all seven of my incarnations.""   What does he mean by ""all seven of my incarnations?"" Is it a religious reference or something else?   Where does this phrase originate from?   "
1519,"Why did King Bradley allow the Elric brothers, Hughes, and Armstrong to continue investigating the military?","In episode 10 of Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood, during the events in the Research Lab 5, Edward Elric is severely hurt. Later in the hospital, he writes down everything he had come to know, and he discusses with Alphonse, Hughes, and Armstrong about what to do with the information to continue the investigation.  At this point, King Bradley arrives with lemon into the room. He finds out what they are doing but acts very calm and chilled out and allows them to continue investigation while being careful.  Why did he not get Hughes and Armstrong killed at that point? Or at least tell them to not investigate at all? "
1520,D.Gray- man Hallow. Remake? Or continuation?,I'm not sure if this is a remake of the old D.Gray man or if this is a continuation of where the anime left off. Does anyone know anything about this anime? And maybe have a credible source to link?  
1521,Why didn't they take Asuna's NerveGear off?,"I've recently gone through Sword Art Online and I must say it is by far one of the greatest anime I've seen. But there's one thing that bugs me.  After SAO was cleared by Kirito and Asuna was found in ALO, why didn't they just take her NerveGear off? After all, it's ok to die in ALO and the NerveGear shouldn't fry the brain of the user after they die in-game anymore. So Asuna should've been completely fine right? "
1522,What's the story behind the Altair fanart in episode 20?,"Episode 20 of Re:Creators features something marvelous: real-world fanart of Altair from Pixiv appears in the show-world as fanart of Altair on ""Piclive"". For example, this screencap...    ...depicts this piece of fanart uploaded to pixiv back in May by artist Mochizuki Kei (望月けい).  A few seconds prior, a number of other pieces of fanart are shown:    These, too, are actual pieces of fanart from Pixiv (e.g. #6 by itsia, #9 by TOH, etc).   (Note that while all the linked images are SFW, Pixiv itself contains heaps of NSFW content.)    My question: how did these pieces of fanart come to be integrated into the anime? Were they ""planted"" ahead of time (i.e. did the artists have a prior arrangement with the producers to draw and release this art earlier in anticipation of episode 20)? Or was this art drawn ""organically"", with the artists only later being contacted about using it in the anime? "
1523,What Japanese books/piece of literatures that are shown in Psycho-Pass?,"On this scene and other bookshelves of a Psycho-Pass AMV, there are some Japanese books.  What are they? "
1524,Do we know the timing of all of the events in the anime?,"To the best of my knowledge, in the Joker Game anime, we are not consistently given information about when the different events shown occur. I do know the following:   ""Joker Game"" clearly occurs shortly after the founding of D-Agency in autumn of 1937. ""XX (Double Cross)"" occurs in spring of 1939. ""Robinson"" and ""Asia Express"" take place in 1939. ""Double Joker"" includes a flashback that takes place six months before the main events. In the flashback, the D-Agency has recently been created; the main events then probably are in 1938. The spy in ""Miscalculation"" had a one-year stay in France planned, starting from June 15, 1939. France was occupied in June 1940, so it seems likely that ""Miscalculation"" is set in 1940. ""Pursuit"" makes reference to the events of ""Robinson"", and so must have occurred afterwards.   We also see a character in ""Coffin"" comment that a behind-the-scenes three-way alliance between Japan, Germany, and Italy has been formed. This restricts the possible dates of the main events of that episode, but I still do not have anything narrow enough for want of sufficient historical knowledge.  I am left without knowing when ""City of Temptation"", ""Pursuit"", ""Codename: Cerberus"", and ""Coffin"" take place. (It is obvious, for instance, that ""City of Temptation"" takes place when Shanghai was occupied by the Japanese, but the resulting timeframe is still rather large.) Is there any official information on when the various events happen? If not, can we make any inferences (based on details we see, or details in other adaptations of the same material) to make educated guesses? "
1525,Can Formula One prodigies like Haruka (Sailor Uranus) drive younger than Japan's legal driving age?,"Japanese can drive cars from age 18, though many don’t (many who even bother to get their licenses are called “paper drivers” — meaning they can drive on paper but don’t make use of them and don’t have behind-the-wheel experience); they can drive motorcycles from age 16.  Is there an exception for Formula One prodigies, allowing Haruka (Sailor Uranus) to legally drive both on racecourses and on regular roads?  Taiki Kou (Sailor Star Maker) is seen driving a car in episode 178.  This is illegal since he’s 16 years old, correct?  (Japanese legally become adults at age 20; this is when they can start to vote, drink, and smoke.  They have a seijinshiki [成人式, Coming-of-Age ceremony] on Seijin no Hi [成人の日, or Coming-of-Age Day], a national January 2nd holiday on which most individuals return to their hometowns.  See episode 160 for more information.) "
1526,Why is Wolf's Rain so ridiculously expensive?,"I am looking to add the complete set of Wolf's Rain to my anime collection, however after shopping around on E-Bay I see the following:  Wolf's Rain for over $300  This is a pretty common price-point for Wolf's Rain, I constantly see that this series is starting at over $300. Why is this? From what I understand Wolf's Rain was never really a huge hit. So why does it cost so much to obtain a legitimate copy? "
1527,How much of Otome Youkai Zakuro is adapted in the anime,"On Wikipedia, it lists that the manga is still ongoing, with the latest volume released in March 2014. The anime however began airing in October 2010 and I'd assume it was on the works for a while.  After seeing the end of the anime and how things seemed to be resolved, I am wondering how much of the Otome Yōkai Zakuro manga was adapted into the anime? Did it deviate from the manga at any point in order to get a conclusion? "
1528,Is Ryuk required to write Misa's name in his Death Note at the end of her life?,"Death Note Rule LXIV states:     gods of death are obliged to confirm the death of the first owner and   write down that humans name in his/her Death Note   Misa was the first human owner of the Death Note that was brought into the human world by Rem. Misa then gave up this Death Note, and then picked it up again later, and this time the Shinigami owner was Ryuk (Light made him and Rem switch notebooks). Obviously the responsibility of killing Misa would normally be Rem's, since she was the first to ""drop"" that DN in the human world. But then Ryuk also ""dropped"" it after he got ownership of it, and Misa ""picked it up"" and became the owner for the second time. Rem is dead, so she can't kill Misa. Does this mean that the responsibility transfers to Ryuk?   I know that the anime makes it look like Misa was about to commit suicide. And it looks like it's her idea, too--I seriously doubt Ryuk would have made her go through all that trouble (wearing the ""handmaiden of death"" outfit and fancy makeup, traveling to the place where Light died,etc). But we don't actually see her die. Would Ryuk be the one to kill her, now that her life is about to end due to her own intentions?   Does anyone know of anything in the manga, creator commentary, etc., that might clear this up?  (Rule is from the wiki here [website]"
1529,Why do Japanese anime characters shout so much?,"I would like to point out this incident from NHK ni Youkoso - Episode 21 (11:12 to 11:34). The main character Sato is escorting his friend Yamazaki to a subway station to bid final adieu to him. Yamazaki is a game creator (gal games) and MC helps him to create one. I have written below a short piece of dialogue (writing it from the English subtitles) between the two at the subway station:     Sato: Sorry      Yamazaki: If you visit home, be absolutely sure you get in touch      Sato: Sure..      Yamazaki: See you around.      Sato (a bit panicked): Yamazaki..      Yamazaki: Don't let the world beat you, Sato      Sato (this main character seems even more panicked and shouts in Japanese): You are not going home defeated, right?!      Yamazaki chuckles.   ...   ..   Now my question to all the fellow members is, why does the character shout here? It seems a bit awkwardly and reluctantly placed. This is one instance which I have cited here but I have seen this sort of thing in other animes before. I can't exactly remember the names. "
1530,Who is the first Oppai Loli ever featured in anime and manga?,"The first time I ever saw Oppai Loli is Hestia from Danmachi. But, is Hestia the first Oppai Loli in anime and manga? Was there an Oppai Loli before her? "
1531,Who is Prince of Darkness?,"When Ichigo was using Hiyori Sarugaki's workout machine, there is some banter with the Visored such as Kensei Muguruma complaining about Lisa Yadoumaru reading swimsuit magazines instead of watching Ichigo.  At one point, Roujuurou Ootoribashi asks Love Aikawa if he has heard the new Prince of Darkness CD that has just come out, who then replies if he had read the latest issue of Shounen Jump.  Now I get why Shounen Jump is featured because the Bleach manga is serialized in it, but I am wondering, is Prince of Darkness a real life band? If so, then what is their connection to Bleach? Is it just merely product placement?  NOTE: this is in the English Dub. "
1532,What is the point of Jason asking Kaneki to count backwards by 1000-7?,What is the point of asking Kaneki the question 1000-7 at several points during his torture?  Is there some character development behind the reason hid did that? Or is it a known method of torture?  
1533,Touhou Song Identification Request?,"someone knows the exactly name of the song that is hearing in this video?

1534,What manga did Natsumi and the others read?,"In episode 7, Natsumi started to read what looked like a manga magazine, and the others start reading it with her.    Does it come from a real manga? If it does, what manga is that? "
1535,"Where does the word ""Nyanpasu"" come from?","Renge usually greets people with ""Nyanpasu"". The sub says ""Meowning"" which probably comes from ""Morning"" as a greeting. But ""Morning"" as a greeting in Japanese is Ohayo which is quite different than ""Nyanpasu"".  here's a YouTube video of how Renge said it  I don't really understand Japanese, maybe it comes from another word? "
1536,What Madoka Magica poster is this?,"Episode 4 of Gamers! has a scene where two characters go to an arcade.     Off to the right side of the scene is a poster that is unmistakably from Madoka Magica:    I consider myself something of a fan of Madoka Magica, but I don't think I've ever seen this poster. What, specifically, is this a poster for? One of the video games? "
1537,"In Death Note, how far could ""sexual"" interaction go with a shinigami before it broke rule XXXVI?","As the internet knows, in ""How To Use"" XXXVI, the following rule is stated: ""There are male and female gods of death, but it is neither permitted, nor possible for them to have sexual relations with humans. The gods of death also cannot have sex with each other. ""  Now, this rule isn't to prevent romantic interaction, as a shinigami can be in love and act like it, he will only die when he steps in to save his love interest. In other words, love isn't forbidden, purposefully saving lives is. No, the obvious would be that this rule addresses breeding. Nobody wants half-shinigami running around in either worlds. Or at least, the shinigami king doesn't.  But if something is not possible for a shinigami, why is it also forbidden? It's a pretty awkward catch: in humans (and supposedly also in creatures as sophisticated as shinigami, who have a culture and a personality) sexuality goes way beyond reproduction. We guys in the human world have hundreds of ways to spend a steamy hot night without actually doing the deed. So what is ""sexual relation"" supposed to mean? Here are the two options that seem obvious to me, but neither feel entirely satisfying.  1) If ""sexual relations"" are both forbidden AND impossible, can a shinigami behave as lewd as he wants, with humans or peers, since none of it can be called ""sexual relationships"" (they're impossible) therefore everything sexual he does is by default allowed? (In which case, the interdiction would only exist in case it somehow became possible for shinigami to get laid, I guess?)  2) Or, is the rule twisted/badly worded, and implies that intercourse is not possible but also that all and any sexual behaviour is forbidden, despite being completely feasible? If that was the case, it begs the question why this rule exists in the first place, since it won't cause any offspring. That would also be the first time a Death Note rule is so imprecise and ambiguous.  The whole question could be dismissed by saying that shinigami just won't be interested in it in the first place, but I ruled it out, given how diverse their personalities are and how much some of them like to mess with humans in every way possible out of sheer boredom am I right.  Both solutions seem problematic. Is there any info out there that I missed, or any thinking I got wrong? Thank you a lot for helping me solve this mystery.  "
1538,What is meant by Nagato when she mentions the 'Big Seven'?,"While attacking the Airfield Princess during the final episode, Nagato and Mutsu turn up midway through the fight. After firing a volley of shells at the target, Nagato says out loud, ""Don't underestimate the power of the Big Seven!""    What significance does this hold? There are more than seven ships present, so it's unlikely to be that, and the ship Nagato has more than seven guns both in the anime and in real life.  So, what is Nagato referencing when she mentions the 'Big Seven'? "
1539,Why aren't the normal titans affected by the 13-year curse?,"In Attack on Titan, the titans wandering around the walls seem to live longer than 13 years, bypassing the curse. We know for sure that the normal titans live longer because of the Smiling Titan.  But why aren't the wandering titans affected by the curse? Shouldn't all the titans have died just because of this curse? "
1540,Does Peggy's speech in the Tokyo ESP previews follow some pattern?,"The Tokyo ESP next-episode previews are pretty simple. They're just a mostly static screen on which the title of the next episode appears, and Peggy (the penguin) says something which seems to be the usual cute-sounding gibberish noises.    I noticed that Peggy seems to always say the same number of syllables as the title, and with a similar rhythm to how it would be spoken in Japanese. That makes me suspect that Peggy is actually saying the title of the next episode, but changes the syllables based on some pattern. Repeated syllables (like in the episode 6 preview shown above) are pronounced the same as far as I can tell, which seems to support this theory. Looking at a few English-language sources, I couldn't find any discussions of this, or even anyone suggesting that there might be some pattern.  Does Peggy's speech in the next-episode previews follow some set pattern? (As a bonus, does the pattern also apply to Peggy's speech in the episodes proper?) "
1541,Why didn't the Task Force capture Misa Amane?,"After the final meeting and Light's death, everyone in the room knew the truth. They knew that the 13 day rule was fake, and the rule about destroying the Death Note was fake, too.   They also had many evidences against Misa (the tapes, fingerprints, hair, etc.), and Light also screamed ""Misa write their names"".  At this point, they had enough proof that Misa was Second Kira, but why didn't they capture her? Why did they let her go? "
1542,Why does Eighth have such an oversized head?,"All the characters in Mirai Nikki follow more or less the same style, with one exception - Eighth, who has a strangely oversized head.           Spot the culprit   Why is this? Is there a specific reason Eighth has this appearance? "
1543,Do the pages to which Yuri Nazarov's photograph is clipped come from real publications?,"In episode 6 of Noir, when Mireille is identifying Yuri Nazarov to Kirika, a shot where his photograph is clipped to some papers with English text appears. Two different pages are shown.    The text in the papers contains references to 1990's American politics, with the mention of Gore, the Democrats, and Congress. Does the text come from any real-life publication from the period? Also, do the two different pages belong to different pieces of writing, or to the same one? "
1544,Is every human wizard a female?,"In both LWA series and OVA, I only saw female wizards. The most likely to be a male wizard are Lotte's dad and the magical shop owner but I never actually see them perform any magic. There are also several non-human male character like  the Dragon Fafnir, but every human male seems to be a muggle. Is there any human male wizard in LWA world? If there are none, why all of them is female? "
1545,"Why always ""skirt-flipping"" fan-service's (mini-skirt blowing up.)?","Sometimes in anime/manga, I see some scene's where the MC flip the skirt of the heroine, or even some random character with a cute face. I know there are many kind of fan-service's like groping breast, yuri scene's, etc. But why is it almost always skirt flipping ? Like it is the standard of fan-service.   Is there story behind it? Where does this originate from?  "

1548,How do cursed tools identify their owners?,"I see that cursed tools pass from a owner to the next when the owner relinquish ownership (like when Haruaki asked Kirika to give him the Tragic Black River belt) or when the owner dies and someone claims ownership (the The Indigo Vessel and Rawhide FCD comes to mind).  Since the curses normally affects their owners or people related to their owners, how exactly are the ownership given? Can tools decide to change ownership without killing their owners or with their owners relinquishing ownership? "
1549,Where and when does Franky say that Sanji is one of the strongest guys on the crew?,"I found this statement in the Wikia,     Franky acknowledges that Sanji's strength is greater than his own, claiming that Sanji was one of ""the strongest guys on the crew"".   but I can't find where or when does that (Franky's claim) happens. The Wikia doesn't give any citation there.  Did Franky say that? If so, where and when did he say it? "
1550,Why is Super Sonico famous?,"The first thing that comes to mind when you think of Super Sonico is probably her large * ahem * assets.     Super sonico is all over the internet and has many fan-service wallpapers, figures, etc.  What is Super Sonico actually famous for?   I know she's a mascot for a gaming company, but is it purely the appeal of her chest that has gained her the massive fan following? "
1551,"If Nagato has both of Madara's Rinnegan, how did Madara still have one Sharingan when he met Obito for the first time?","I agree with the fact that even after using the Izanagi Madara's other eye got revived after activating the Rinnegan. But when he met Obito for the first time, he had one Sharingan on the left eye. How can this be? He implanted both of his eyes onto Nagato, so where did that Sharingan come from?   Though only one eye of Nagato is always exposed I noticed he actually has Rinnegan on both eyes.   "

To quote Irisviel:     Older sister. Yes, that is the one who is older and has more power. When it comes to domestic hierarchies, they can hold more power than even the father. And they have absolute sway over younger siblings, which can never be overturned. The quote one great man, ""No little sister is superior to her older sister!""   Who are these characters?

1556,Are non-Tokyo dialects common in anime?,"Spoken Japanese has a number of dialects that vary regionally throughout the country. From my (moderately limited) Japanese language experience, most of what is spoken in anime is Tokyo-ben (aka Standard Japanese). I'm not great at telling the difference between dialects, however, so I was wondering, are non-Tokyo accents/dialects common in anime, or used at all? In shows like Yuri!!! on Ice, which is set in Kyushu, is a Kyushu accent being used or a Tokyo one? Do shows set in Kyoto use a Kyoto accent, or is everything standardized to a Tokyo-ben? "
1557,What is the light source in inverted world?,"At the end of the movie, we know that         Age's (Eiji) world was the inverted world and Patema's world was the normal one. However, when Age and Patema fell to the ""sky"" in Age's world, there was a ground on the other side of the ""sky"" with some kind of building there. And when it became ""morning"", there was some light source like a sun, and the ground in the ""sky"" was burn. Also, through out the movies, there was morning and night in Age's world. How could that happen?   What exactly was the light source? Was that the planet's core? (It wasn't look like that on Earth) Or was that some kind of device? "

1560,How did the people in the Naruto Universe forget about their history?,"Can somebody explain the timeline of Naruto?    Apparently everything started off with the Sage of the Six Paths creating jutsus (with no info on society before it), and then a couple generations later Konoha is founded. Then about two generations later Naruto becomes this savior of the world.  Judging from this, people forgot even though the span of their history could only be about 1000 years.    Let's say the Six Paths was 1000 years ago and the Konoha as well as the other major hidden villages were founded around 300 years ago.  What happened in those 700 years?  How did the people forget their own history, in such a short time?  Did everybody just forget to tell their children stories about the strong people of their time?  Was there no form of writing or stories passed down generation to generation?  Note: I'm not saying that the history was only 1000 years, it might have been longer or even shorter.  There was no evidence to it so I estimated it by generation.  Each new generation every 60-80 years. "
1561,What is the significance of the toad statues in Mount Myouboku?,"In Chapter 409, it's said that they were people who failed Sage Mode training and were turned into toads and eventually into stone. But there don't seem to be many people that signed the summoning contract, so they can't all be from people who failed Sage Mode training.  Why are there so many toad statues? So where did they all come from? "

1564,How was summoning jutsu created?,"How did the summoning begin in Naruto?   Summoning was a jutsu that not only required lots of jutsus, but also required a blood contract (probably from a village of animals since all of the summoning animals are sentient).    How was this accomplished when the animals were far away? "
1565,Why did Shouko use hearing aids even though she's deaf?,"In Koe no Katachi, Shouko Nishimiya uses hearing aids. She's deaf, so can she actually hear something or not?

1567,What is the importance of the number 7?,In the start when Natsu was looking for Igneel he said that Igneel was with him 7 years ago. After the Tenroujima incident they all disappeared for 7 years. Evil Rogue came from 7 years in the future. There were seven dragons that came out of eclipse gate after it was opened.

This slightly embarrasses Akane. When her sister leaves the room, Akane picks up her sister's smartphone.  She says to herself, ""I'm going to mess with her."" At that point she presses something multiple times.  The smartphone is on, but it appears no app is active. So what did Akane do?  BTW, I'm sure there was nothing malicious involved. It was just two sisters being playful.  I checked the next episode, but there is no clarification. Maybe I'm just clueless about Japanese smartphone usage. The common communication app they all use appears to be LINE.  It is a real app, very popular in Japan.  It combines texting, telephony, and instant messaging (over the Internet, not telephone lines). We didn't see if this is what her sister was using before she left, but that would be my best guess.  Yet how would one mess with it without it being open and active? "
1570,Does Devil Fruit taste bad?,"In One Piece, some people were shown eating the Devil Fruit such as Sabo and 2 CP9 said it was disgusting or tastes really bad. However, Luffy was shown eating it at the beginning without a complaint. In the anime series, he ate it for being upset; in a movie, he ate it for dessert. Another case was Buggy the clown but he doesn't stand much of an argument because he technically swallowed it whole by accident. Also with Chopper: he ate it when he was a deer. It it really tastes that bad, wouldn't he follow his instinct as an animal and stop eating it?  TL;DR: Does Devil Fruit taste bad? "
1571,Where did Yaoi Paddles come from?,"Sometimes on convention pages I see bans on Yaoi Paddles; canoe-like paddles with Yaoi or similar phrases (For example Seme, Uke or Yuri) written on them.    I understand that someone who has a Yaoi Paddle goes around smacking people on the butt with it, which presumably is why they are banned (as I've seen a lot of people complaining that they hurt) - but why is this a thing in the first place?  When and where did Yaoi Paddles originate? "
1572,How could the machine in Gantz manipulate life and death?,"In the anime Gantz, after you die, you're teleported to a special room where a black ball orders you to do some missions in order to continue your life. You can win special prizes with the danger of possibly dying again and only get revived by the exchange of points. How is this possible? How does this machine have power over life and death, and even the power of resurrection? "
1573,"Why is ""I won't forgive you"" a commonly used threat?","In a number of shows, ""I won't forgive you"" or some variation is used as a threat. Rukia uses it when she is trying to keep Ichigo to follow her into the Soul Society, saying, ""If you follow me, I will never forgive you."" It is used similarly in other shows. In Vampire Knight, Kaien Cross says to Kaname that, if he makes Yuuki cry, he will never forgive him.  This doesn't seem to be used in Western television, or at least not to the same amount as it is in anime. Is this a part of Japanese culture or is this something that originated in anime/manga? If it did originate in anime/manga, where did it first appear? "
1574,What does vegeta call goku black in dragon ball super?,"So I just realized the conundrum of Goku Black and Vegetas stubborn namming sense. Since the arc is a while away from being dubbed, I don't want to binge the entire arc again just to find any instance of Vegeta saying Goku Blacks name. So what does he call Goku Black? And does he call him something different after it's revealed who he really is? "
1575,Was Majin Buu able to turn people into physically anything?,"Majin Buu has a beam where he can turn people into chocolate or assortments of candy. In one episode he turns an old man into a carton of milk. In another he turns a village of people into a white clay? like substance to make a house. Does this mean he is able to turn people into physically anything, say for example.. a gun or money?   "
1576,Can Ryuk be killed with the Death Note?,After watching the Netflix Death Note movie I was left with a interesting question.  During the movie (from memory)     Light; What if I write your name into the death note?   Ryuk; Ha! I would like to see you try. Furthest someone got was two letters.   Was this also a possibility in the original manga/anime series? Or this something totally original to the movie?  There already seems to be a similar question Is there a way to kill Shinigamis with a death note? . This however only covers indirect usage of the Death Note and not directly writing it down (which the op of that question seems to debunk without a source) 
1577,Name Suffixes: Does Yaten (Sailor Star Healer) ever refer to Usagi (Sailor Moon) by her civilian name?,"Would Yaten use ""Tsukino-san"" to indicate his emotional distance from her, or merely ""Tsukino"" to indicate his penchant to be rude?  Is there any episode in which Yaten Kou (Sailor Star Healer) either directly addresses Tsukino Usagi (Sailor Moon) by her civilian name or refers to her by name when talking to someone else?  I've been searching through all the episodes of Sailor Stars, the 5th season of the Sailor Moon anime, but I cannot find an example.   He clearly calls her ""Sailor Moon"" when she is in sailor soldier form, but what does he call her as his classmate at school?  Taiki Kou calls Usagi ""Tsukino-san"" in episode 185. Seiya Kou (Sailor Star Fighter) calls Usagi by the nickname ""Odango,"" and she calls him simply ""Seiya,"" but she calls Yaten ""Yaten-kun"" and Taiki ""Taiki-san;"" Taiki calls Mizuno Ami (Sailor Mercury) ""Mizuno-kun;"" and both Ami and Hino Rei (Sailor Mars) call Seiya ""Seiya-kun."" "
1578,What happens if there is no relic in a summoning?,"In Unlimited Blade Works, we eventually learn that Archer was summoned as Rin had a relic associated with him (i.e. the pendant Shiro keeps). In the recent anime adaptation, there is also some statement to the effect of ""a relic is required to summon a servant"".  Similar sentiment is expressed in the Fate route of the visual novel. On the last day, Saber tells Shiro that he must have been able to summon her as a result of having had Excalibur's sheath embedded in him (similar to how it was embedded in Irisviel in Fate/Zero):     To summon a heroic spirit, one needs a symbol connected with that spirit.   This seems in line with the other summonings we see, such as Waver's use of a cloak to summon Iskandar and the trouble the Einsberns take to retrieve the sheath so that Kiritsugu summons a good servant. Finally, some remark Lord El Melloi makes about having to find a relic last minute suggests that a relic is always required.  Is this (""a relic is always required for a successful summoning"") correct? If so, did Rin have anything she knew to be a relic when she summoned Archer? (I feel like she didn't, but if a relic is required, I would have assumed that she'd be aware of this, as a reasonably competent magus.) "
1579,How is an anime based on western-literature made?,"I just saw some anime that are based on western literature. I was just wondering how is it done. I mean, does the anime production company have to ask permission from the author of the books? If so, what if the author has passed away? And what kind of permission do they have to take? Like some anime that are based on western-books have modifications to the real story, so do they inform the author about all the modifications? Thank you. "
1580,How rare is it to find an anime script from the late 1990s for purchase?,"I'm interested in buying official Japanese-language anime scripts from Japanese online auctions, Japanese online shops, eBay, and/or American websites. How often are they listed? If I see one, do I need to act immediately because the chance of coming across it again is extremely low? If it's not my favorite episode of the series, should I hold out and wait because other episodes' scripts will likely go up for auction at some point (say, within this year)?  Or is it more likely that the one I see is the only one I'm going to be able to get my hands on?  I'm particularly interested in Sailor Moon scripts which date from the late 1990s. How many copies of these were printed? "
1581,How Knov apperance kept on changing?,In Hunter x Hunter at first Knov appearance was pretty bold and looked smart. But after knowing the fact that their enemies are stronger then he got scared. But being a Hunter why he undergoes such a huge change in appearance ? I mean how come his whole physical body changed ? They knew that the mission they are going into is really scary but what was the reason behind his complete change?   First change: His hair got white and he was a little bit skinny.    Second change: Hair loss and lack of physical fitness.   
1582,In what order should I watch the Ghost in the Shell series?,"The Ghost in the Shell series is comprised of several movies and animated TV series.  TV series:   Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex Ghost in the Shell: S.A.C. 2nd GIG Ghost in the Shell: Arise   Movies:   Ghost in the Shell Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence Ghost in the Shell: S.A.C. 2nd GIG – The Laughing Man Ghost in the Shell: S.A.C. 2nd GIG – Individual Eleven Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex − Solid State Society Ghost in the Shell: The New Movie     For someone completely new to the series, what order should these be watched in? (Are the movies even important to the animated series?) "
1583,Why is there a difference in number of episodes between anime and TV broadcast of Haruhi?,"I am planning on re-watching The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, and all of a sudden I see that there are 28 episodes now when I was pretty sure the anime had ended at around 14 episodes (?).  Is there a sequel or did I just not see the other 14 episodes being released? "
1584,Was Picollo/Kami a special case of Namekian Fusion or this could be done by anyone?,"Some time ago I asked this. Potara fusion limit  In DBZ, we see Picollo fuse with Nail and exponentially increased his power. Then again he fused with Kami to further enhance this.   Was only Picollo/Kami able to do this type of fusion? I mean if you're on the verge of Genocide, you'd think some of the warriors may try fusing.  So was this due to knowledge (Nail new from the old Namek, Kami cos he divided his body) or physical limit of Namekians.   Associated, how many times could this be done? "
1585,Where can I buy the digital version of Gantz manga?,Where can I buy the digital version of Gantz manga? I searched in Dark Horse Comics site but they don't have the digital version. Amazon also just has the Physical version. Does Gantz not have a digital version of the manga? 
1586,How could Madara absorb the Divine tree?,In the anime Madara absorbs the Divine Tree with his rinnegan. How did he do that? Does Madara's rinnegan have the same powers of absorbing as Obito's Mangekyo Sharingan or is it just a plot-hole? 
1587,"Why was Reiko ""disposed of""?","In Shinsekai Yori (From the New World), children who show the potential to become either Akkis (fiends/ogres) or Gouma (karma demons) are killed off and removed from society.  Examples:        Katayama Manabu - He cheats in the ball tournament and is disposed of near the end of episode 2.  Aonuma Shun - He becomes a karma demon and dies after episode 10.  Kutegawa Izumi - She becomes a karma demon and is told to commit suicide in Tomiko's dialogue in episode 12.       But what about Amano Reiko?  She ""disappears"" at the end of episode 1. But what did she do wrong? It was apparent that she wasn't skilled with her juryoku (psychic power or Cantus). But is that reason enough to kill her off?   "
1588,What is the music being played when Tatara learns to dance from Kiyoharu?,"In episode 2 of Ballroom e Youkoso, when Tatara learns to dance from Kiyoharu, what song is playing? I'm referring to the backward-Jazz-piano music that starts at 1:17 in this YouTube clip.  The only songs I can find from this anime are things like OST/OP/ED, not those transitioning instrumentals used whenever someone dances.  "
1589,Conditions to obtain Mangekyo Sharingan,"I was reading this answer and it got me thinking, how can Sasuke obtain the EMS, if Itachi's eyes were in worse condition than his? Itachi's eyes were losing their light they weren't in ""good"" state to be considered a good replacement. How did they heal when transplanted?  "
1590,Dark Kamehameha?,I was curious about the use of the dark kamehameha. So far I know that color pigment to an energy move doesn't really matter and in most cases in DBZ it's a bit of a design trope to signify the uniqueness of that move to that character.   Black &amp; Mira(from Dragon Ball XV the game) are the only two characters portrayed to have a dark kamehameha technique.   Since the title is changed I was wondering if it uses something else other than ki. Perhaps dark god ki? Or demon ki?   Has there been any elaboration on the technique? Or is it just another trope like Freeza having a pink destructo disk?  
1591,"What is the Juralian referring to by ""that day""?","In episode 3 of Chargeman Ken, a Juralian speaks to some of the flesh-eating butterflies that have been plaguing Japan (and perhaps, elsewhere):     Oh, my lovelies. The Earthlings are in a panic over you. According to the Earthlings, you went extinct 50 years ago. My lovelies, until that day comes, be my power!      Nobody knows that I saved you 50 years ago, and that I improved you to eat human cells and multiply! All so that you would destroy the Earth!   [Text taken from Crunchyroll subtitles; paragraph breaks are my own.] What does the Juralian mean by until that day comes? Normally, it would seem to refer to the day 50 years ago when the Earthlings thought that species of butterfly extinct. However, this is not a good reading, since the Juralian indicates that this day has not come yet.  Does it perhaps refer to the day when that species of butterfly does in fact become extinct, or to the day when the Earth will be destroyed? "
1592,Who's Charlotte?,"Where does the title ""Charlotte"" come from? I don't remember a character or concept with that name. I don't remember the word even being spoken during the series itself. Do we know where it comes from? "
1593,Is there an in-universe explanation for how eye transplanting works?,"How can the characters in Naruto just have their eyes taken out nonchalantly, seemingly without pain and without regards for infection or damage? If I took out my eyeballs and put them back in, I can't guarantee that I would regain my eyesight. Shisui must've overdosed in painkillers.  Is there any in-universe explanation for how this works? "
1594,Can Kakashi use the jutsu he copied without the Sharingan?,"I'm not talking about Sharingan specific moves like Amaterasu, but the ones he had copied with the Sharingan like Water Dragon Jutsu.    With the sharingan he has copied and can use over a thousand moves.  Lets say he no longer has it (removed), does he retain the skills he had copied?  Does it depend on Sharingan or the skill of the user? "
1595,"What was the background music in episode 14 of Your Lie In April, starting from 08:52?","What was the background music in episode 14 of Your Lie In April, starting from 08:52? I can't find it in the OST album. Can anybody help? "
1596,How is 'Kuronue' spelled in kanji?,"The only place outside of fanfiction I've seen the name ""Kuronue"" is in Yu Yu Hakisho, so I suspect they made it up. How is it spelled in kanji in the original media? Or is it ever spelled out?  "
1597,How does Getsuga mode works?,"It is said that in order to release Final Getsuga Tenshou, Ichigo has to be Getsuga himself. But, what does it mean? How this Getsuga mode worked? Is it only Zangetsu exclusive? Is it cancelable and be reused? "
1598,Who are these guys seen in chapter 691?,SPOILER ALERT  Who are these guys? What are their names and their positions?   
1599,Übel Blatt Manga: What was the purposes of naming the 4 lances of betrayal?,"Potential Spoilers  What was the purpose of the seven heroes to name the 4 people as betrayers of their quest, even though      They were the real heroes and completed it. I understand why they were killed. Why not just let the king know that they too died after completing the quest? Why was their name dragged through mud. We see a lot of negative consequences of this, for example Kfeer's family ostracized and his territory thrown in Civil War.   Why demean the memory of their friends instead of honoring their memories? "
1600,"Can Pokémon say only what their species is named as, or are they named with the only word they can say?","This question has been quite bothersome. As mentioned in the title, how exactly does it work? Do Pokemon get their species names from the only thing they're able to say? Or do they say (and repeat) whatever species name they're given?   (I think it's the former reason. But I haven't found any factual description that proves it. So I'm looking for answers supported by facts considered cannon.) "
1601,What's with awkwardness/fear with romance?,"Why is it in almost every anime when there is a male main character, Everytime a female main character comes on to him he gets all flustered, scared, or runs away? I mean through a whole series we see tons of huge boobs, panty shots, etc. But when a hot girl or mainly the love interest, tries to hold hands with the guy or kiss or anything of that nature. He always chickens out, or thinks that it's inappropriate or they are interrupted or he's to stupid to get the situation. They can fight monsters and demons but when can't do that? It won't make the character any less Noble. Any why is there the need to ALWAYS have other characters interrupt it or make him to dense to understand the female loves him. Why can't anime creators for once let romance start near the beginning and go smooth instead of towards the end and super hard to get to? It's been this way since anime first started and it's not funny or entertaining anymore.  "
1602,Why can't Edward get back his power to do alchemy?,"Roy Mustang's vision was restored, so why can't Edward Elric try to use something to exchange back his gate, like using another philosopher's stone? Is it that he didn't need alchemy anymore because he fulfilled his wishes? "
1603,When do Japanese high schools have midterms?,"Exactly which days of which month do Japanese high schools that use a 3-semester format (which can cause students to repeat a grade) typically hold midterms in the first semester? And how many days pass between taking the midterms and the posting of the grades?  In episode 177 of Sailor Moon, Ami (Mercury) and Taiki (Star Maker) tie for top grade when grades are posted in the hallway. Taiki mentions in this episode that the (fictional) comet they see is visible at the same time as the (real-life) Centarus constellation, which is visible in Tokyo from mid-March until mid-May, with its maximum visibility around the first week of April.  However, in the previous episode, 176, Nezu (Sailor Iron Mouse) is reading issue 7 of STAGE芸能 magazine, implying that it is mid- to late-June (since Japanese magazines come out a month, or half a month, before their publication date: 7 = July) and class 1-1 has a sho tesuto (quiz) in Math.  In the following episode, 178, it must be before June 1 because the students have not done koromogae yet (changing from long-sleeved school uniform to short-sleeved, which I read on the web takes place on June 1st every year). On the other hand, in this episode, Yaten (Star Healer) is taping a TV show, and I read online that Japan has four television seasons: winter (January–March), spring (April–June), summer (July–September), and autumn (October–December), and that each episode of Japanese dramas are usually shot only a few (two to three) weeks before they are actually aired. The minor character Noriko accuses Yaten of ""itsumo"" (always) heading straight home after a taping, so they're a number of episodes into the series. This would indicate that episode 178 is, at the earliest, in early June so that the episodes can air starting in July.  I imagine that episode 177 is correct regarding the time of year for grade posting, and that episodes 176 and 178 are the ones that makes a mistake about the timeline.  I found this info about the Japanese high school academic year online:  Typically, the first day of a new school year is around April 8th, 9th. Summer vacation usually starts just before July 20th and usually lasts til the last day of August.  The students take their midterm exams at the end of May. Since the finals are given in July, that means the students only have a month and a half between midterms and final exams.  While midterm exams go on for two days, final exams last three days. For a week before both midterms and finals, school club meetings and other after-school activities are canceled. Students are also not allowed in the teacher's workroom or the copying room.  In high school, there are 5 periodical tests in a year (the midterm and the finals). There are some subjects which only require 1 test per term, some 2, others give no test at all, and some would base the student’s grade on classroom performance alone. Periodical exams are usually held within 3 to 5 days. There are some schools that give take-home exams or evaluation exams. "
1604,Is this girl really from Bleach?,"On some sites which have ads I've been seeing the following image  possibly NSFW if you look hard enough         Now I've only seen up to episode 130 and I've never seen her before. However she kind of looks like Lighting (AKA Clare Farron) from Final Fantasy XIII.  I am wondering: is this girl really from Bleach? If so when would I see her in the series (which episode or chapter), and if not where is she from? "
1605,Did Seki-kun ever pay attention to the class?,"  Seki-kun always plays in class or even outside the class (PE or even during disaster drills). Does he ever pay attention at all? What about tests or his homework? Has he ever been caught playing in class? Usually Rumi is the one who gets scolded by the teacher because she was paying attention to Seki.  Maybe it is not shown in anime or manga directly, but maybe there is something along the line of ""He only pays attention to some teacher"" or ""He used to always pay attention before"". "
1606,How lucrative is being a psychiatrist or MHP in Japan IN PSYCHO-PASS?,"In our society, psychiatrists are among the lowest paid physicians.*  The Best- And Worst-Paying Jobs For Doctors  I Don't Know - Med School Parody of ""Let It Go""  Unlike our society, mental health is anything but swept under the rug in Japanese society in Psycho-Pass.  **So in JAPANESE SOCIETY in PSYCHO-PASS:  How lucrative is being a psychiatrist relative to other medical professions? How lucrative is being a psychiatrist relative to other professions? A mental health professional?**  Feel free to spoil the figures if any and even the context. I'm expecting some kind of twist to reveal that MHPs are actually paid much higher or much lower than public perception.  Or you could just give the public perception of the figures then put the true figures in spoilers or something.    Elaboration:   I'm not sure I saw a figure in season 1 (haven't seen past that), but based on the existence of Sybil system and all that, I'm guessing it takes a lot of mental health expertise to maintain. Even though       Sybil is made up of brains of people with ASPD or something (well technically those who can't be read by Sybil system or something)   I don't see how mental health expertise isn't as highly valued in other aspects.   People want to keep psycho-pass levels low right? It's not like there's some       additional   conspiracy about manipulating psycho-passes.  Even if there was a      n additional   conspiracy, how would you do that without mental health expertise right?    *of course I'm adjusting for things like country, experience, etc so with sufficiently high probability, a psychiatrist will earn less than a non-psychiatrist doctor assuming they're both in the same state and have the same amount of experience  "
1607,What is up with Tsukihi and Karen's boyfriends' names?,"In Tsubasa Family and Tsubasa Tiger, it was mentioned in a conversation between the Fire Sisters and Tsubasa that both Karen and Tsukihi have boyfriends[1][2].  Karen's boyfriend is named Mizudori （瑞鳥【みずどり】）.  Tsukihi's boyfriend is named Rousokuzawa （蠟燭澤【ろうそくざわ】）.  What is up with these ridiculous names? Has the author explained the names or expanded the story on who they are?  1 Light novel - Nekomonogatari (White) Chapter 059.

1608,What makes the hero/commander units better if development takes so long?,"In Knight's &amp; Magic (MAL, Wiki), Silhouette Knight (mecha) development takes a long time, which is why Ernesti is making such waves.  However, it seems that commanders have more powerful units.  For example, Knight Commander Morten Fredholm's Haimerwort in episode 5.  The Earlcumber, and the King's unit also come to mind.  What makes these units special and/or more powerful? Could they possibly be using      custom ether reactors from demon beasts,    rather than the standard, mined, ones? "

Are there any references to the walls' names inside the story-line? "
1611,What determines what zodiac a person represents?,"In Fruits Basket, different characters represent different zodiac symbols that they then turn into when they are hugged by someone of the opposite gender. What determines what zodiac a person represents? Is it the year they are born in? If so, what determines who becomes the cat? Additionally, does that mean that every cursed Sohma is born in a different year (discounting Akito)? "
1612,When did a Celestial enter Tiz?,"When the party confronts Ouroboros at the Altar of Darkness when he addresses one of them he assumes their form.       At one point when he is talking about the Celestial Realm, he addresses Tiz and says that he sense a resident of the Celestial Realm in him.  After Ouroboros's defeat during the credits Tiz has Egil to go on ahead before he heads to the graveyard and says:  Tiz: I suppose i should return what i borrowed  Before a light leaves him. Tiz collapses suggesting that the light is the Celestial leaving him.   In the teaser footage for Bravery Second unlocked after the game, when Magnolia goes to get Tiz out of where ever he is, the way she talks is as if he is talking back to her:      Magnolia: Relax, There's no need to be suspicious of Me  pause  Magnolia: ...Yeh, I think that's fair to say...         Magnolia: I envy You Tiz  pause  Magnolia: Because, you've got the kind of good luck i'll never enjoy...  pause  Magnolia: ...You get to live in the same era as me, you lucky dog, you!         Magnolia: 'Kay, Let's get going.  Magnolia: ...To Where?  Magnolia: Mmm... to somewhere nice ♥   So this would indicate that Tiz only had a Celestial in him, he wasn't one himself which then left his mortal form (if he was he would be unresponsive to Magnolia)   I am wondering when did a Celestial enter Tiz? and did a Celestial enter every other Tizs' in all the worlds linked by Airy or was the Tiz we play as the only one? "
1613,Where is it mentioned the Accelerator's Vector Transformation works on all 11 dimensions?,"The wiki says this about Accelerator's Vector Transformation:     It is said to even be able to reflect teleportation vectors in the 11th dimension, though a strange phenomenon would occur in the 3-dimensional world, so thus people could not teleport harmful objects into his body, as most Teleporters would do in a battle.    However, no source is cited. I've searched the entire light novel for it, and haven't found where ""It is said"".  Is their claim true? Where is that stated in the series? "
1614,What song is playing during the first encounter with Granzeboma?,"During Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann: Lagann-hen (the second movie), the protagonists encounter Granzeboma at about 01:32:30 into the movie, and a battle begins. (A clip of the scene can be found here; the music begins about 10 seconds in.)    I've listened to as many of the songs in the OST as I can find, and none match this noble, battle-laden theme. What music is it that plays during this scene? Is it even available? "
1615,What is TK's actual name?,"""TK"" is a mysterious character who tends to speaks in nonsensical English phrases depending on the situation.  Was it ever revealed what is his actual name? Also, why do the other SSS members call him ""TK""?   "
1616,What's the range of a witch's barrier?,"Throughout the anime, after entering a witch's barrier, the Magical Girls are seen traveling a long way inside a maze-like struture before reaching the witch's lair. The lairs of the witches are generally spacious. Take the witch in episode 3 for example, when Homura was chased around by the witch-turned-worm, the worm was shown to be quite small inside the lair, which suggests that the lair inside the barrier is very wide.  So what's the range of a witch's barrier? And do the witches have total control over their own barriers? "
1617,"Is the anime called ""Working!!"" or ""Wagnaria!!""?","I just started watching Wagnaria!! and noticed that it says ""Working!!"" in the opening. I do understand that the title Wagnaria!!, as printed on the Box, DVD Cover and listed on NISA's Website, comes from the name of the restaurant in the anime which the story mostly centers around.  So I am wondering, does Wagnaria!! mean Working!! in Japan? Why is the anime titled Working!! but in the West it's labeled Wagnaria!! (with the second season being Wagnaria!!2), since normally in the West either the Japanese name is kept or it's translated to English? "
1618,"Did the incident mentioned in ""Kiba's Long Day"" really occur in the anime?","In the anime episode Kiba's Long Day (Season 4, Episode 184) there's a premise that a outsider had infiltrated the Village Hidden in the Leaves and used an infectious agent before committing suicide.  Naruto has heard about Kiba ""and the others"" having dealt with this previous incident (and seems petulant about missing out).  From the subtitles of the open:     Naruto: What do you mean by monitoring Akimaru?      Tsunade: You know about the incident where someone from outside   infiltrated the village, right?      Naruto: Yeah, I know about that. But I heard Kiba and the others   resolved that incident without any trouble.      Tsunade: That's right.      Naruto: Damn! That Kiba! I want a mission where I totally kick an   enemy's butt.      Tsunade: To be exact, that's wrong.      Naruto: What?      Tsunade: Before Kiba and the others had the intruder in custody, he   swallowed a pellet and killed himself.   Is this previous incident that Tsunade and Naruto refer to something that is portrayed earlier in the anime series?  We'd seen some episodes where outsiders disguised themselves and entered the Village (and infiltration is a theme of later episodes as well). But ""taking a pellet"" to suicide doesn't match with anything I remember in the series to that point. "
1619,Why don't Araragi and Senjougahara call each other by their given names?,"It only happened once in Bakemonogatari when Araragi went on his first date with Senjougahara (and her father). Araragi called her by her family name Senjougahara, and Senjougahara teased Araragi and asked if he call her or her father. And then Araragi called her by her given name (Hitagi)  They're dating, so why they don't call each other by given name? Does Senjougahara do this out of respect to Hanekawa? "
1620,What is the origin of the face fault?,"In many anime, when characters are surprised or seen to do something stupid, the other characters will sometimes fall or keel over on their faces in some comical positions with their legs in the air. Where did this originate and is it used in any other case and or culture where stupidity or shock is (or) not implied?    This link offers some information on it but it doesn't verify or explicitly state its origin.     When shocked or surprised, often by an absurdity or non sequitur, the   listener may fall over onto his face, his limbs in a twisted mass   above him. In its typical form, the character in question has just   heard someone else say something so incredibly stupid that it, quite   literally, floors them.    "
1621,"What causes people who come in contact with the ""Time Fruit"" to change?",What causes only males to turn into blood-wing angels and only females into immortals?  There have been occurrences of both happening to some people. Was that ever explained?   
1622,Does Fate/Strange Fake take place in the same timeline as any of the Fate/Stay Night routes?,"One of the hardest things to wrap my head around in the Nasuverse has been what events belong to what timeline, this is just one example of that.  It seems like F/SF isn't contradicted by anything that happened in the F/SN timeline (that is if you consider the unusual 'rules' of the Fake Grail War to be permissible in the same universe as the normal Fuyuki GW).  So, is it more or less the same timeline? If not, does it belong to any other timelines(like the KnK one for example)? "
1623,What is the meaning of the title of Fruits Basket?,"The title of ""Fruits Basket"" seems to imply that there is some basket with fruits in it which is somehow relevant to the story. However, I imagine that a story about a literal basket of fruits would not be very interesting.  What is the significance of the title? Is it referencing a literal basket of fruits or is it symbolizing something else? "
1624,"What does ""notice me senpai"" mean, when a boy says it to you?","So this boy in my class said to me, ""notice me senpai"".  What does it mean?     I think they like me, so does that have anything to do with it? "
1625,What happens if a Devil Fruit is destroyed?,"We know that if a Devil Fruit user dies, their fruit reappears (see In One Piece, does a Devil Fruit reappear after the user dies?). However, this doesn't answer the question of what happens when the fruit gets destroyed without being eaten. I don't know if that's even possible, but I imagine so with sufficient effort.   If a devil fruit is destroyed, would the fruit reincarnate in a nearby fruit (the same as when the user dies), or would it be destroyed for good?  "
1626,Why is there an extreme amount of censoring in Jojo (Stardust Crusaders) on Crunchyroll?,"There seems to be an extreme amount of censoring in Stardust Crusaders (black shadows, etc) compared to other anime or even the previous 2 seasons.  Examples:   Smoking Cut body parts Big wounds (eye stab, etc.)   I don't really understand. If perhaps the smoking thing is because Jojo is underage, Sanji smoked since ""day 1"" of One Piece (he was in his teens). The wounds I don't understand either, as some other anime don't censor large wounds (like Fate/Zero, which I watched while it was airing on TV).  Example of censorship in Stardust Crusaders:    Example of Jojo season 1 no censoring on huge wound:    I'm watching on Crunchyroll if it matters. Sometimes it's so bad I can't even tell what happened in the scene. Why is this? If there are any laws causing this, what laws and what do the laws say? "
1627,How did Mello know how to help Near in Death Note?,"In the end of Death Note, Near would've been lost if Mello didn't help him. That makes me think why Near who is always be careful (isn't like L or Mello) didn't find out about the possibility of fake death note, meanwhile Mello had found out about that.  For Mello, after he found out that Kira helped Japan Police, he would found out that Kira was there being watched by others. In order to keep killing people, he would need X-Kira (Mikami) to do the killings and a spokeperson (Takada) to help him communicate with him. Until then, Mello's and Near's thinking were the same: find the x-kira (Mello investigated Misa too). Mello could easily assume that Near had found the x-kira and been stalking him.  What makes it weird is Mello thought that this person who was being investigated by Near was using fake death note, and assumed that Near wouldn't ever found out about this unless he kidnapped Takada.  So, would Near have never found out about the possibility of fake Death Note without Mello sacrificing himself? If it was really that hard to find out, how could Mello know? Doesn't it sound like Near would get easily be tricked by Light, while Mello outsmarted the two of them? "
1628,Why is Toradora's ED about oranges?,"This site has Toradora's second ending theme, Orange (オレンジ), together with lyrics both in Japanese and translated.  First, it's worth noting that the word Orange is ambiguous in English, referring both to a color and a fruit, and it is used to this effect in the song. At one point in the song it talks about a fruit which is turning orange, and at another it talks about an orange. I don't know if we can conclude that these are the same fruit, so if you want to claim that they are actually different fruits feel free to do so.  What is the significance of this fruit, and the story told in the song in general, in the context of the anime? It seems to be symbolic somehow, but I don't know what it's referring to when the singer is talking about an ""orange ...[which] was sour, ... [but they] ate it all anyway.""   Can anyone decode the meaning of this song, and what the orange is symbolizing, in the context of the anime? "
1629,Does Ash walk away from the starting pokemon in the anime?,"I've not seen the show, but I used to play the video games. In Pokemon Go there is a secret way to get Pikachu by walking away from the starting Pokemon. People on the internet say Ash did so in the anime. Is that true? If not, how can this be explained with anime's events? "
1630,How would Annie's going underground prove anything?,"I'm wondering how Annie's going underground (in episode 23) would prove she wasn't the Female Titan? Also, was her reason for not going there only because she knew it was a trap, or did she have another reason as well? It feels like I have missed something.. "
1631,How could someone like Hashirama die in the First Shinobi World War?,"Hasirama is one of the most OP characters in the Naruto series. No one could match his strength, even Madara, and he had crazy regenerative abilities. Basically, he had no weaknesses. Narutopedia sums it up pretty well:     Hashirama was famed as the strongest shinobi of his era, reputed as a God of Shinobi ... His body was brimming with vitality, granting him considerable regenerative powers that could mend most injuries with no residual effects ... Hashirama was proficient in all five basic nature transformations, along with Yin and Yang Release ... [It goes on and on]   So how did someone like him die in the First Shinobi World War? He alone has the same power as an entire village, and so long as he is careful, no one can even scratch him. And if he gets hurt, he can just heal it and shrug it off. So how could he so carelessly die? "
1632,Is the Fruit of Grisaia an actual fruit?,"Having played a fair bit of -LE FRUIT DE LA GRISAIA- (Grisaia no Kajitsu, literally ""The Fruit of Grisaia""), I have to admit that the title has confused me more than anything else. It seems to have very little to do with the plot of the VN, at least so far.  What is the meaning of the title? Is it titled after an actual fruit, and if so what is the fruit? Also, what significance does it have to the plot? "
1633,How realistic is Totsuki Culinary Academy?,"In the show it's classed as an elite international culinary school, but given the graduation rate (less than 10%) and the idea of study behind it, is it realistic? Is there a real life equivalent? "
1634,Where does Kyoko get those delicious looking apples?,"In the show, we always see Kyoko with some sort of food, but we never see where or how she obtains these foodstuffs.  Where does she get those bags of apples from? Is it related to her powers some how (e.g. did she create them with her powers or use her powers to steal them)?      "
1635,Is there a reason Gon never speaks to his grandmother?,"In the 2011 anime version of Hunter x Hunter, Gon never speaks to his grandmother.  I have rewatched episode 1, 37, and 38, but he never addressed her.  We don't see him telling her goodbye or hugging her either. Nor is Killua shown to acknowledge her.  Gon's body language in 37 and 38 seems to pay attention to her when she speaks, though. And in the non-canon re-hash episodes 13 and 26, his letters begin, ""Dear Mito-san and Grandma,"". Countering these instances, at time-mark 9:25 of episode 37, Gon converses with Killua and states, ""Since Mito-san raised me by herself"". Although in episode 1 of the 1999 version, we do see both Gon and Kite speak to her.  Until I found the instances of acknowledgement, I was beginning to wonder if by the time he turned 12 his grandmother had become a ghost that only Mito saw. It seems clear that Gon sees her, too, though.  But alive or a ghost, why does he never speak to her? I guess it is possible that it is abnormal in Gon's culture to speak to a grandmother when your parent (figure) is there.  At 14:57 of ep.1(1999), the point Gon speaks to her, they are alone in the kitchen, with Gon asking, ""Where is Aunt Mito?"".  Once Mito shows up, he doesn't speak with his Grandmother again. (This is the scene where Mito brings Gon his father's fishing rod.)  The simplest explanation is that the animators and/or Togashi simply had nothing for Gon to say to his grandmother. Still, it seems at best awkward that he tells Killua that Mito raised him by herself, and that, during his extended goodbye to Mito before leaving for the exam, he ignores his grandmother. "
1636,Why do fansubbers merge video and subtitle into one file?,"Why do fansubbers merge video and subtitle into one file?  Sometimes its an mkv file and I can just extract the sub.  On some sites they hardcode it into the video frames as image overlay.  This is so silly. Why not just have the one video file which several languages or translation versions (corrections) can share, instead of re-encode and re-upload? And if someone wants a sub they can download just the sub. Distributing subs must also be easier because the subtitle files are smaller, so no wasted bandwidth, and it might not even be illegal to share just the sub. Plenty of reasons!  Do they have some reason which I do not realize? "
1637,Do Kururi and Mairu swap chat handles?,"In episode 6 of Durarara!!×2 Shou, we see Mairu speaking lines that are attributed in chat to ""Kyou"" (狂) around 18:14. Later on, around 18:44, we hear Mairu's voice actor (Kitamura Eri) speaking lines that are attributed in chat to ""San"" (参), followed shortly by Kururi's voice actor (Kanemoto Hisako) speaking lines that are attributed to ""Kyou"".   Then there's the fact that Kururi is taciturn in person but ""Kyou"" is super-talkative in chat, while Mairu is a chatterbox in person and ""San"" just occasionally posts one-line replies in chat.   Another thing (which I might be making too much out of) - in episode 2 of Ten, Mika mentions that ""San and Kyou are Mairu and Kururi"", without specifying which one is which.   And, to be clear, the character used for ""Kyou"" can also be pronounced ""Kuru"" (as in 狂う), while the character used for ""San"" can be pronounced ""Mai"" (as in 参る) - the chat handles are clearly derived from their names.   I don't see how to reconcile all these details without concluding that both Kururi and Mairu use both ""Kyou"" and ""San"" as chat handles at various times. This seems like exactly the sort of trollish thing they would do (runs in the family, I imagine). Am I right in thinking so? Or have I misinterpreted something? "
1638,What music plays in Hunter x Hunter SLOW MO?,"2011 release of Hunter x Hunter (Chimera Ants arc):  In the episode where Gon and his friends enter the castle of ants through the hole made by Knov , everything goes like a slow mo and an epic music hits. I apologise for not mentioning the episode number. This music is repeated several times during the arc after the inception.  I have listened to various OST's from Hunter x Hunter but I don't think any of them are the one which I am looking for...  Can someone Identify the music that was playing?? "

Can anyone let me know for sure if the series is canon or not?  
1643,"What is the meaning of the title ""Bad Apple"", and which characters appear?","The original video for Bad Apple!! is one of the most well-known Touhou videos. Here's the original, together with English subtitles:  [website]Why is the song called Bad Apple? There is an apple in the video but I don't imagine that's why. It matches the lyrics decently, but it still seems like a strange name for a song.  Also, all of the characters in the video are black and white silhouettes. Which characters are represented and in what order? "

So is it possible that it is some kind of mistake or there is any explanation behind this event ? I am not sure but there are few other events too which shows that she has both devil wings in previous episodes too. But how it is possible ?   "

1646,Why change an anime series into a recap movie?,"I'm wondering why would an anime that featured several episodes be compiled into a movie.  For example Attack on titan spanned 26 episodes that were later compiled into 2 movies. Another example is Death Note, also compiled into 2 movies.  I might understand the release of an original movie with new story, or a special episode that recaps the series. However, a full movie recapping the series ?!  Is it really necessary or profitable? "

1649,Who was Levi's host?,"Spoiler alert! Do no proceed unless you are up to date with the manga or you don't mind being spoiled.  In Chapter 112 of Shingeki no Kyojin, according to Eren, the Ackerman are able to unleash their power when their host are in danger and they will often have headaches as their inner self fights against the instinct of the Ackerman blood.  He then told Mikasa that her tagging along wherever Eren goes is just from her Ackerman blood as Eren is her host.  Levi is also an Ackerman and as seen multiple times, he is capable of nearly inhumane feats such as slaughtering a horde of Titans all by himself. My questions is, who was Levi's host? Was it Erwin? If so, do we have proofs that it was him? "
1650,Why is it that the Skull Knight and Void are against each other?,"In the manga, the Skull Night foils many of the God's Hand's plans, and also attempts to kill Void specifically.

1653,Where was the Seven Blood Stains Incident detailed?,"In Ar Tonelico Qoga, in the glossary under the Necrohouse of Ayatane, it talks about that some of the Teru Clans began to hate humans after something called the Seven Blood Stains Incident that was caused by Sol Ciel. It was this event that led to the Necrohouse allowing Garthnode Infiria to occur hoping that humans would destroy themselves.  But I don't know what this incident is. The only incident involving the Teru Tribe in Sol Ciel I am aware of was when Bourd kidnapped Misha from the Crescent Chronicle resulting in a battle between the Teru Tribe and Tenba which resulted in the destruction of Aurica's hometown Skuwat. But this was way way way after Garthnode Infiria so this can't be it.  The way it's worded seems as if this Seven Blood Stains incident is supposed to be matter of fact for players of the previous game (since it also clarifies that Mir's Son Ayatane is unrelated to the Necrohouse of Ayatane). So I am wondering where was the Seven Blood Stains Incident detailed? Was it in a drama CD or manga? "
1654,Are the honey-pickled apples from Spice and Wolf historically accurate?,"If you've seen or read Spice and Wolf, you probably remember that they had apples pickled in honey and spiced with ginger. That sounds delicious. In fact, this tumblr blog claims to recreated the recipe, and the results do look tasty.    Those apples look delicious too, though I have to admit I'm not sure if they're the kind I'm talking about.  Spice and Wolf is also culturally based on Europe, though exactly when or where isn't revealed and the setting doesn't seem to exactly be Europe. It's probably based on some times in the medieval period but we can't really be sure.  Is there any evidence of this sort of technique being used in Europe in the correct time period for the preparation of apples? If not, is it inspired by any other techniques for preparation and preservation of fruits (perhaps from some other location and time period)?  "
1655,Why is Tangelo Island named as such?,"In Pokémon, there's an island named Tangelo Island. However, it's Japanese name translates to Bontan Island.

Also, Tangelo and Pomelo are quite different fruits:  Tangelo ^  Pomelo ^  Which one of these, if any, is grown there? "
1656,Why does the church have seven-branched candelabra?,"In the first episode, d'Eon asks a woman about the ""nqm"" motif and is directed to go to a church to read the ""Psalm of Vengeance"" in the ""ancient tongue"" (i.e. Hebrew). While he is there, we see two seven-branched candelabra on the table.    This was strange to me, since the menorah, a Jewish symbol, was the first object I associated with ""seven-branched candelabra."" My internet searches did not clarify this:   Wikipedia suggests that the Orthodox church uses the menorah in liturgy, but Le Chevalier d'Eon takes place in France, where Western Christianity predominates. While I found a number of results that mentioned menorot in churches, I was not given much reason to believe that this was traditional practice.   I did find this forum post. The Google Translate version of the Wikipedia page linked suggests that ornate versions of such candelabra were common in the medieval period. However, I cannot tell from this whether they were still common by the period in which Le Chevalier d'Eon is set or whether smaller versions were ever at all common.  I searched for images of seven-branched candelabra; the results were largely Judaism-related.   Is there any in-universe reason (whether specific to Le Chevalier d'Eon, or related to its setting) why such candelabra are being used? "
1657,Why does Ryuk love apples?,"It is often seen in Death Note that Ryuk loves apple. Why is that? Do all Shinigami (Death Gods) love apples, is it the only food for Death Gods or does he just love apples?   Also.. Is it to signify the apple as the forbidden fruit?    "
1658,Why is Trunks not as powerful as Gohan when they are both human-Saiyan hybrids?,"In the Saiyan Saga (don't recall which episode, but I believe it was when he was with Nappa on another planet), Vegeta mentions that Saiyans who were born from humans and Saiyans are more powerful than pureborn Saiyans. This makes sense when you see moments of Gohan surpassing Goku in power level when he gets angry, such as when he fights with Garlic Jr. or Raditz.  Later, we see him being a teenager and surpassing Goku definitely by becoming SSJ2 first, but we don't see anything of this sort with Trunks. Trunks apparently surpasses Vegeta in a fight with Cell, but then we know Vegeta wasn't using the buff form because it makes you slow. And Gohan surpasses Trunks even more when he's 10 and Trunks is chronologically 19 or more (2 years in the time chamber). Later, Gohan doesn't train and Goku surpasses him, but then again when his hidden power is released he becomes the strongest character for a while again.  Gohan doesn't train much, but if he does he becomes the strongest. Why doesn't Trunks have this ""hidden"" power, or is able to surpass Vegeta when he gets enraged or after a hard training, as Gohan does with Goku? Trunks is also a descendant of a human and a Saiyan, so shouldn't he be much more powerful than what he is?  Edit: Now things have changed with the new Dragon Ball Super episodes where      Trunks can surpass Gohan, Vegeta and Goku in power when he gets angry, and it seems to have as much hidden power as Gohan. He also, when enraged, gets a new transformation no other Saiyan has obtained before.  "
1659,How and why is Subaru connected to the Witch (Satella)?,"All throughout the series, specifically, within the second Arc of the story, there are references to Subaru smelling like the Witch's Scent, Giving us the knowledge that he is Definitely connected to her.  Why is this? It's well known that Subaru was pulled from modern day Japan into this Fantasy world, as well as that he has the ability ""Return to Death"" In which he has the ability to Respawn.  These things most likely have things in common with his relations to the witch, though... What exactly is the relationship? How are they connected? "
1660,Why weren't some of the original Digimon able to evolve into their Ultimate/Mega forms in season 1?,"Up until Digimon Tri, only two people from the original Digi-destined were able to evolve their Digimon to their Ultimate/Mega form (and even go beyond that, see Omegamon). All the other characters were stuck with Digimon that could only go up to Perfect/Ultimate form. I get why, it's explained in episode 38 of season 1.  But why has that changed in Digimon Tri? How can Joe and Mimi evolve their Digimon into Ultimate/Mega forms so easily? What made it possible for them in Tri that wasn't possible for them in the original season? "
1661,Which parts of Dragon Ball GT do not follow the original Dragon Ball story?,"I watched Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z growing up. I read the mangas. I am familiar with the stories. I've read in wikis and articles that the GT story doesn't originate from or follow the original Dragon Ball story.  I didn't watch GT but recently I watched the final episode. There, Goku, at the end, makes the rounds and visits many characters from his childhood, before disappearing into the dragon.  Just from that episode, everything seemed like it was a continuation of the previous series and based off the original stories.  So how does it not follow the original Dragon Ball series? What is different? Are there aspects that contradict the original work? "
1662,Why is it so rare to see new long running anime series these days?,"Around the early and mid 2000's we saw the spawning of a large collection of long running anime series, such as Naruto, One Piece, Pokemon, Yu-Gi-Oh!, etc., all of which still are continuing today in its original series, or through some spin-off. Nowadays, we are left with mainly 12 or 24 episode anime, most of which will never see a second season.  Why is it so rare to see new long running anime series these days? What caused the shift in the anime industry to a more ""agile"" (borrowing a term from software development for lack of a better word) production rate?  My first guess is that the producers base their decision for a long-running anime series on the success of its source manga. However, this is not entirely true, as we see Attack on Titan is a 25 episode series, even though I believe that its manga sales overtook that of One Piece at some point. "

1669,Fairy tail wizard Myatogan's source of magic,"I was watching Fairytail and couldn't get my head around a query.  Mystogan is originally from Edolas and as mentioned humans in Edolas don't bear any magic within. However, Mystogan seems to be extremely strong and is capable of generating a lot of magical power. Where does he get this magic from? Shouldn't he be just capable of using magical objects rather than actually using magic from within? "
1670,"How does Gohan inherit his ""Mystic"" power while others do not?","Goten and Trunks in the current Z timeline are very powerful, but even the Fused SSJ3 Gotenks can't be compared to Mystic Gohan. He was more powerful than even SSJ3 Goku.   Even though Gohan didn't train for around 10 years between the Cell and Buu saga, he was able to surpass all Z characters except Vegtito and BuuTenks in power.  So, why is Gohan more powerful then other half-saiyan children?  In this question, the most upvoted (not necessarily correct) answer says that since Goku/Vegeta were more powerful when Trunks/Goten were conceived they were more powerful. Hence why Future Trunks was weaker. But, this doesn't explain why Gohan was the strongest of the lot when Goku was at his weakest in Z when Gohan is born. And, this directly contradicts the answer given above.  This question  may be related, but I believe that Gohan has a hidden power which was released by the Elder Kai answers the question. However, I can't find any source or the reason for the hidden depths to Gohan's power. So, that question may build on the premise of this question.  How does Gohan inherit his ""Mystic"" power when none of the other half-children such as Future Trunks, Trunks and Goten have it? "
1671,"What are the episode titles of Boku no Imouto wa ""Oosaka Okan"" parodying?","Listed below are all the episode titles from the official site (in Japanese). The title for the limited time episode on NicoNico is taken from the official (?) blog (in Japanese):     Episode 1: ある朝、大阪おかんの妹ができまして。 (Aru Asa, Oosaka Okan no Imouto ga Dekimashite)   Episode 2: 妹が大阪おかんなんですけど！ (Imouto ga Oosaka Okan Nandesu Kedo!)

It is interesting that the original series usually have something to do with brother-sister relation:     俺の妹がこんなに可愛いわけがない (Ore no Imouto ga Konna ni Kawaii Wake ga Nai)   ==> Episode 3: 俺の妹がこんなに大阪おかんなわけがない (Ore no Imouto ga Konna ni Oosaka Okan na Wake ga Nai)      お兄ちゃんだけど愛さえあれば関係ないよねっ (Onii-chan dakedo Ai sae Areba Kankeinai yo ne!)   ==> Episode 4: 大阪おかんだけど愛さえあれば関係ないよねっ (Oosaka Okan Dakedo Ai Sae Areba Kankei Nai yo ne)      最近、妹のようすがちょっとおかしいんだが。 (Saikin, Imouto no Yousuga Chotto Okashiindaga.)

What are the rest of the titles parody of?  Update: I have identified all of the main episodes' titles. However, I cannot find any work that resembles Episode 1.5: 配信限定大阪おかん. "
1672,Akito's motivation?,"In the anime Fruits Basket, what was Akito's motivation behind allowing Tohru to live with Shigure, Yuki, and Kyo?  Did he hope that Tohru would reject them, thinking that no normal person would ever care for them, and heartbroken, they'd all return to his side at the main house?  "
1673,"What happens, if the Einzberns don't have a homunculus?","In Fate/Stay Night and Fate/Zero, Irisviel and Iliasviel were used to summon the grail. What would happen, if the Einzberns hadn't created Irisviel in the first place? Could the grail still appear? Would another family need to create a homunculus? Would that even be possible, due to the fact that the grail was first summoned with the use of Justeaze Lizrich von Einzbern? "
1674,Can a transformed Saiyan lower his ki to base-human level when transformed?,"In Dragon Ball Resurrection of Freezer, Goku, when transformed in Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan, is almost killed by a laser beam from Sorbet. Now how could this happen? Was his ki so low even when he was a SSGSS? Later in the Dragon Ball Super series this seems to be corrected because he isn't transformed when he is hit. But then again, I don't know which is the version that counts, supposedly the manga is over the movie and series but between something that happens in the movie and series I don't know.  Then the question of this topic is: can a transformed Saiyan (Super Saiyan, Super Saiyan God, etc.) lower his ki to base-human level when transformed? Was this just a mistake or what? "
1675,"Did the Mass Production EVA Series make use of souls, like ""normal"" EVAs?","We know that an Evangelion needs a soul at it's center to operate normally, such as Yui being the soul of EVA Unit 01, and part of Asuka's mother being in EVA Unit 02. If the EVA Unit does not have a soul, then it would start bezerking like EVA Unit 00 during the testing phase of the EVA Series.  Now, for me, this raised another question, did the EVA Series (Mass production EVAs) use souls as well? Or were they ""soulless""? Like how they were pilotless, and were ""reliant"" on the Dummy Plug system?  "
1676,Did Death know Blair was a cat and not a witch?,"At the start of Soul Eater, Maka and Soul are tasked with hunting the soul of a Witch to turn Soul into a Death Scythe. The target is normally assigned by Lord Death as to avoid the Meister/Weapon group from getting killed.  During Maka's/Soul's fight with Blair, Death comments that there's ""something odd"" about her (right before he Reaper Chop's Spirit for Spirit's comment on Blair's body), then we learn she is actually a cat with a lot of magic. As a consequence, because Maka and Soul messed up the final soul, their previously collected 99 souls were confiscated.  From what Death said during the fight, it didn't seem as if it was a test to see if Maka and Soul could correctly identify a Witch. So I am wondering, did Death know Blair was a cat? If not, why did Maka/Soul get punished when he himself thought that she was? "
1677,Did the writer of Sword Art Online do a research on guns when writing Gun Gale Online?,"In a number of Sword Art Offline 2 episodes in Yui's trivia corner, she explains some of the guns seen during the series talking about their real-life counterparts.  Did the writer of Sword Art Online do a research on guns when writing Gun Gale Online? Did this trivia come after the light novels and used only to give something for Yui to talk about in Sword Art Offline? "
1678,Which sign language is being used in the Gangsta anime?,"In the anime, Nicolas cannot speak properly due to his disability. He has to use sign language in order to communicate with others. Is the sign-language used in the anime authentic? Which sign language is used if it is? "

1680,Why Is Britannia often depicted as an almighty power?,"Often in series revolving around wars, you will see a mention of Britannia.  More often so, they are depicted as an almighty power which is to be feared, or even one which has dominated most or all of the world.  Some of the most known examples would be code-geass where ""The Holy Empire of Britannia"" conquered most of the world, including Japan, which then became known as Area 11. Or a bit more obscure reference in nanatsu-no-taizai:    So why is Britannia often depicted as an almighty power? One who should be feared? "
1681,When did BlackStar and Tsubaki swap?,"In the second episode of Soul Eater, during BlackStar's fight with Mifune BlackStar, Tsubaki used Shadow Star to swap places with BlackStar and disguise herself while BlackStar attacked Mifune's blind spot.  Just before this, Mifune noticed BlackStar (apparently now Tsubaki) is a different person from the way he was breathing. He also commented that BlackStar's eye colour had changed.  So when exactly (episode time) did BlackStar and Tsubaki swap? Was BlackStar's eye color different at that moment or did it change suddenly later? And if it changed later, when was that?  NOTE: I ask this question as every time I re-watch the episode, I'm engrossed in the fight and keep missing it "
1682,How does Brook stay together?,"Bones are kept together in the body by muscles and tendons. Since Brook has none of those, how does he stay together and move? Especially with him being able to open his skull, how does he not fall apart? "
1683,How can Mjolnir Hammer joins the Far Eastern Magic Nap Society of Summer?,"By the time the club was established, Mjolnir Hammer, Dekomori Sanae, was a junior high student. How can she join the club? Was it because her junior high and the senior high that Tyrant Eye, Takanashi Rikka, attends is an escalator school? Is it common for student of an escalator school to attend club of the higher school in Japan?  If we don't count Dekomori as an official member of the club, then the club would have only 4 members (Dark Flame Master, Tyrant Eye, Mori Summer, Tsuyuri Kumin) which is one less than the minimum for a club.  Note: I'm not sure that the school is an escalator school. The uniform is similar and I think Yuuta once said to Dekomori, ""Oh, you attend our junior high, huh?"" which suggest that the school is an escalator school, but I'm not sure if I remember it correctly. "
1684,How does Suigintou function without her torso?,"In Episode 12 of the first season, after Shinku repelled Suigintou's fire attack back at her and her clothes burn off we see her torso is missing. after Shinku finish explaining how Suigintou was unfinished Suigintou's upper half falls to the ground.  Why it only when her clothes have been burned off does the reality of her floating upper half take effect? what was keeping both halves together as if she did have a torso? "
1685,How strong is Ash?,"Ash is occasionally observed to carry Pokémon besides his 5 kg companion Pickachu, which most often can be found on top of his head / shoulder.    or even heavier    Those are some heavy creatures for are teenage protagonist.  So has our teenage protagonist been hitting them gym(s)? Or is this all just caused by another perception of weight/strength in the Pokémon universe? "
1686,How could someone with Magic wield the Anti-magic weapons?,"The Witch Queen told Asta and his friends a bit about the history of the elves in Black Clover Episode 65. She stated that the elves possessed great magical abilities and were so strong that many of them were her equal in terms of magical strength (and she is very prideful; for her to admit that says a lot.)  What is really baffling me thou is when she stated that the leader of the elves was the former wielder of the Anti-Magic weapons that Asta currently uses, which subsequently blew Asta's mind and mine too!    How is it possible if people with Magic can't wield them?  We know that the only reason that Asta can use those swords is because he was born without magic and hence the sword does not weaken him. However, the leader of the elves possessed strong magical powers and yet he could still wield the Anti magic weapons. Even the Wizard King admitted that only people without Magic could wield those weapons. Are there any exceptional rules to how the Anti magic weapons work?  "
1687,How did Trafalgar Law get to and leave Marineford?,"My question is two-fold:    How did Trafalgar Law and the other ""Worst Generation"" pirates get to Marineford? I thought you had to go through the tri-currents? Or is that the tri-currents are just a faster way but you can come any other way since Marineford is not in the calm belt? How did Trafalgar Law leave the tri-currents? This especially puzzled me. I am thinking now that it might be because of their submarine. My assumption is that it can move freely, does not depend on currents, but I am not sure.    I would appreciate answers that are based on more than just speculation.   "
1688,How strong (physically) is Robin?,"How strong would robin have to be to be able to pull off all of those tricks with the Hana Hana no Mi since she's using her own arm?

Vegeta did it when he switched from super saiyan to super saiyan god, and Goku did it when he switched from super saiyan god to super saiyan blue (Goku also displayed a white mastered ultra instinct aura for a couple of seconds too). What does this mean? What's Goku's and Vegeta's green aura in Dragon Ball Super Broly?       "
1690,Who are the Baby-looking villains attacking universe 6?,"In episode 7 of the Dragon Ball Heroes anime, Baby-looking villains        attack Hit, Cabba, Kale and Caulifla   Who are they? are they from the same race of Baby? "
1691,How does a series go from manga to anime?,"In a previous question, I asked about Dragon Ball Super being released before its manga. My question here is about the life cycle of a manga becoming an anime.   From my understanding, an artist or mangaka creates their comic called manga and it gets published by a major studio if it's deemed worthy. From there if it cultivates a big enough fan-base it becomes licensed by a studio like Viz, Funimation or Bandai. And from there it becomes a game, movie, t-shirt, toy, etc.  Is that the way most anime's come into play? If not, what is the proper life cycle from drawing to manga to anime?  "
1692,Why do many anime OPs and EDs have onscreen lyrics?,"I have noticed that much, but by no means all, of the anime that I've seen has had lyrics onscreen during either its OPs, EDs, or both. Why is this so?  I know karaoke is fairly popular in Japan, so do people actually sing along while they wait for their shows to start? Perhaps it is done to promote the songs licensed for the openings/endings?   Some examples of what I'm talking about include:   Shirokuma Cafe   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Pokémon   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Dragonball Kai   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Doraemon    Note: Emphasis mine in all of these images.  As a bonus if you could include some information on these side issues, that'd be great:   Is this exclusive to anime, or does it appear in other forms of Japanese media (e.g. music videos? OPs of live action dramas? etc.)  Why are they almost never included in licensed English versions? What was the first anime to include them?   Perhaps this is a slightly broad question, but I assume there must be some general consensus on the matter. Does anyone have an explanation for this phenomenon? :) "
1693,Backstories of Naruto,"The back stories of Naruto, for example how danzo has so many Sharingans. These are only found in the wiki pages. Why aren't they made into anime or manga? OR are they already included in anime and manga? In my opinion, They can be made as new anime episodes instead of those fillers that don't have any connection with story. "
1694,What happened to Hibiya and Hiyori after they broke out of the time loop?,"(It's been over four years since I watched Mekaku City Actors and it wasn't the most coherent anime, so please forgive me if I've gotten any details wrong or missed something obvious.)  In the episode ""Heat Haze Daze"", Hibiya and Hiyori are trapped in an infinite time loop in which Hiyori keeps dying, and Hibiya keeps trying and failing to save her. They finally break out of the time loop (I presume) when      Hibiya sacrifices himself to save Hiyori's life.   The next time we see them is when Haruka breaks open the back of a van to find them bound and gagged inside. I don't recall there ever being an explanation of how they got there.  What happened to Hibiya and Hiyori between them breaking out of the time loop and Haruka finding them in the van? Who put them there, and why? "
1695,Can Minato teleport to his special kunai from Kamui's dimension?,"During his fight against Minato, it seemed that Tobi was trying to send Minato to Kamui's dimension. Even if Tobi had succeeded, couldn't Minato just teleport to one of his special kunai using the Flying Thunder God technique? Tobi knew of the Flying Thunder God technique, so what did he want to accomplish by sending Minato to Kamui's dimension? "
1696,Does tanuki hot pot actually exist?,"  Searching on Google, I found some food related to tanuki like tanuki udon (not sure if they really use tanuki). But I can't find anything like tanuki hot pot. Does this kind of food actually exist? Do they actually eat tanuki? "
1697,Why were Youko's friends added to the anime?,"I was reading that Sugimoto only had a bit part in the Twelve Kingdoms books, and Asano didn't even exist.  Is there any explanation as to why they were added to the anime?  Sugimoto has a pretty big role in the anime, but Asano felt pretty pointless.  Were they just added to give Youko somebody to talk to? "
1698,Why is Benten the way she is?,"I don't really understand her. She's human, but she can fly (I guess Akadama-sensei taught her how to fly when he kidnapped her and raised her as a Tengu) but then, she's kinda left him alone.   And then she joins Friday Fellows, and eats tank hot pot. But she knows who and what this tanuki is. And later, she goes back to Akadama-sensei.  So,    What exactly is her purpose?  What's the reason behind this behavior of hers? Is she the antagonist or the protagonist in the series?  "
1699,Isn't Doctor Laon's Weather Controller a violation against the Tigers Team?,In Episode 8 - Invasion of the Fierce Tigers - Transform to Zero Schneider it's revealed that the string of consecutive victories that the Tigers Team had been getting was thanks to the combination of weather control devices on the Tiger Team's Zaber Fangs and Doctor Laon deploying devices in the sky from his Whale King.  Now while i wouldn't doubt that weather control isn't entirely against the rules isn't Doctor Laon attacking using weather control from his Whale King a violation? like while the Blitz Team uses their Hover Cargo being used as support (ie. for the CAS) they aren't sending it into the field and using it's own weapons to attack.  So isn't Doctor Laon's Weather Controller a violation against the Tigers Team? did they get any fines or lost any points from their previous victories? 
1700,Trouble following Akai squad vs Gauna 487,"I'm having some trouble following the battle of the Akai squad vs Gauna 487 at the end of Knights of Sidonia episode 3 (which I am clearly overanalyzing). I've replayed the scene like five times and cannot figure out how or when Aoki is killed, and I can't follow Momose and Midorikawa's demise.  Something about the animation and visual similarity between characters (as well as similar voices for the men) is making it difficult for me. The only way I could really tell who was who was the unit numbers on their helmets (001: Akai, 002: Momose, 003: Aoki, 004: Midorikawa).  So from what I can tell (Netflix timestamps), I've bolded the parts that I wouldn't mind some clarification on:   19:44 Akai and Momose go in together, Momose gets grabbed. 19:59 Akai slices off the tentacle, saving her. In a heavy-handed sequence, everybody immediately yells ""Akai!"" an Akai apologizes, although I'm not sure how everybody knew he was about to die, because from the shot he looked safe and nothing had grabbed him yet. 9 seconds of wondering what he just apologized for follows, until... 20:08 Akai gets grabbed and is soon killed; we see him being pulled in in the following scene. 20:46 We see confirmation on control room screen that Akai is out and Momose is injured (presumably from when she initially got grabbed, but it didn't look like she took any damage?). 20:54 Aoki is told to take command and leave Momose, to which he responds ""but Momose is..."", but I can't figure out what he means by that or why he was told to leave her at that point or where she even was, because we haven't seen Momose do anything yet, really. 21:19 Aoki says ""I'm going in"" (I had to pause to read the 003 on his arm to confirm) and closes in on the Gauna, instructing Midorikawa to support fire 21:32 Momose goes flying past (about two frames, needed to pause to catch it and didn't even see this until like the third time I watched it) and Midorikawa yells ""stooooop!"". Momose goes into full blind rage mode. 21:57 Momose gets too close, takes a hit, we hear buckling metal. She is knocked back quickly. Presumably this is what ultimately kills her (she may or may not randomly explode later). 22:07 We see either Aoki or Midorikawa go after her and immediately deduce it is Midorikawa because we see 003/Aoki tell him to stick to the mission. 22:09 Immediately we see Aoki's view of some tentacles coming at him. Then the camera switches and we don't see anything else. Somebody yells during the exterior shot of Midorikawa, but can't tell if it's Aoki or Midorikawa. 22:12 Midorikawa grabs Momose as he flies past then soon after loses his grip and clearly dies as he is impaled by a tentacle. 22:25 Somebody explodes but I can't tell who or why. This part doesn't make any sense to me because:   Ok, so from 22:12 Momose is further from the Gauna than Midorikawa. Midorikawa grabs her. Now they are together. His grip slips and it looks like he throws her further because when he is impaled, he is clearly closer to the Gauna than she is. Exterior shot we see the person closest to the Gauna explode, unprompted (I didn't see any tentacles?), which is where Midorikawa was like a second earlier. But then we see that it wasn't Midorikawa, because we have an interior shot of him floating through space, blood-covered and dead. So somehow him and Momose switched places then she mysteriously exploded? Or perhaps it was Aoki that exploded? But he should be pretty far away (and I guess dead) now. Anyways Momose is definitely presumed dead. Adding to this, I later noticed that the explosion didn't appear to be anybody in the squad (see edit below the line below).    I think the final state is: Akai is captured/eaten/absorbed/whatever by the Gauna. Midorikawa is dead and floating through space. One of Momose/Aoki is presumably floating through space too and the other exploded (not sure who; update: see below, somehow neither of them exploded).  The whole scene is a little eyebrow-raising because the mistakes they made and tactics they used didn't seem to agree with the build-up of their skill and confidence to this point (although on the other hand none of them had fought a Gauna before and maybe highlighting their break-down and the contrast with their hyped up skill here was the point). They went down pretty easily.  So, questions:   Did I get all that right? How did everybody (including Akai himself) know Akai was going to die 10 seconds later? What was going on when Aoki was told to leave Momose behind? When did Aoki actually die? Who/what exploded?   I admit I'm overthinking this (and at this point I've spent about 40 minutes dwelling on a 3 minute scene where the only thing that's really significant about it is that it's chaotic and everybody dies), but this is the culmination of my frustration so far at having a really hard time keeping track of who is who (doesn't help that there's like, clones everywhere; at least I assume they're clones - either that or the animators are really struggling to differentiate the characters).    Update: OK, so two new data points that make this even more confusing.  First of all I just noticed that we briefly, for like a half second at around 22:31, see Momose floating through space (interior shot, this happens right before we see Midorikawa's interior shot):    We know this is Momose because if you look at the arm band it ends in ""02"", and if you look at the status display it's missing 002 (I noticed everybody's status display displays everybody but themselves). (This also re-raises the question of how Momose died; at this point only decompression seems plausible except their skin-suits are airtight)  So now it seems clear that Aoki was the one that exploded (although how he got so close to Momose/Midorikawa I have no idea), until...  We see this map in the control room at the start of the next episode:    So we see 001 (Akai) near the Gauna, which we already knew, and 003 (Aoki) as well. Momose and Midorikawa are not on the map, not even on the more zoomed out views in that same scene. But we know Momose and Midorikawa are both floating through space, we saw them directly after the last battle.  So that rules out Aoki exploding as well, which raises the question, what was that explosion at 22:25 in episode 3? Ahhh! "
1701,Did Sakamoto really write in cursive?,"At the end of the translated version of the first chapter of Sakamoto Desu Ga?, Sakamoto agrees to write a report, provided he can write it ""in cursive"":    Given that the manga is set in Japan, I assume the report will be in Japanese. However, I'm not exactly sure what is meant by cursive Japanese. According to wikipedia, cursive (sōsho, 草書) is rare in Japanese, though it's more common in Chinese. Of course, cursive is a particular style of calligraphy, but calligraphy includes more than just cursive, and clerical script (reisho, 隸書) would seem more appropriate for a report like this (though perhaps less awesome).  In the original Japanese text, was Sakamoto really saying that he was going to write in Japanese cursive, or just with handwritten calligraphy (or maybe even English cursive)? "
1702,Why did Kabuto heal Hinata?,"During the third part of the Chūnin exams when Naruto was fighting Neji, Hinata begins coughing up blood.

1703,Why does Naruto have whisker marks?,Why does Naruto have whisker marks on his face?     Does it have anything to do with the kyuubi inside him? Is it to signify that he is the host of the kyuubi or is it just a plain birthmark? Was it ever explained in the anime or manga? 
1704,How common is it for men to voice women?,"I know male characters are often voiced by women. Naruto for example, is voiced by Junko Takeuchi, Luffy is voiced by Mayumi Tanaka, and Hitsugaya Toshiro is voiced by Romi Park, all of whom are women.  How common is it for men to voice women? Is there any precedent to it? If not, are there any examples? I'm asking specifically about voicing in the original Japanese. "

A goes to the middle of the sea for diving. There, when he dives, a gigantic sea monster swallows him whole.   Is this kind of death possible? If so, wouldn't that make the Death Note the greatest scientific tool ever? I mean, it could be used to verify the existence of aliens too. "
1706,How come Koro sensei had tomato juice inside jail?,"In Assassination Classroom Season 2, episode 8, Tadaomi was fighting with Reaper, and then there was one incident where he faked his death from blood loss with the help of Koro-sensei. And then later it is shown that Koro-sensei was drinking tomato juice, and with the help of his one tentacles he faked that scene and helped Tadaomi.  So my question is: how did he get that tomato juice? Is it possible that he was keeping it from the start, or did he try to escape and then got one?    "

1708,Why didn't the Kill-T-Gang drain (and kill) Akari's Libido during the Oberon's battle?,"Amara told Daichi that Capt. Manatsu (Daichi's father) died before crashing into his Kill-T-Gang form: he drained the Libido (lifeforce) out of the spaceman.  It is stated mid-series that merely approaching a Kill-T-Gang can have this effect, and its range is estimated in the 10,000 kilometers (because it could drain the whole planet by just landing on it).  It is also stated that the Neoteny are immune because of their connection to their Livlasters.  During the Oberon fight (ep.24), the four Knights are seen battling the Kill-T-Gang, but only three of them are Neoteny; Akari is just a ordinary human.  The Kill-T-Gang are far from the Blume (and Akari is pegged to the OUTSIDE of the ship), but at most a dozen kilometers.  Besides some trope being applied here to justify this Fiat, shouldn't Akari die?  What is protecting her? "

1711,Why is Haruhi Suzumiya considered shonen?,  Why is Haruhi Suzumiya considered shonen ?  There are some serious and hard to interpret dialogs in the series.   Or is it considered a shonen with some seinen mixed anime ? 
1712,Who is the other asteroid head in the end credits?,"In the end track of Sabagebu! there are some asteroids floating around in the shape of  character's heads.  The first one is Platy, the Platypus:    The next one is our lead heroine Momoka:    But who is this last face? It doesn't look like anyone and there's not exactly a large male cast to choose from (assuming the face is male). The first time it's shown, it appears to have facial hair (although it could just be shadow), whereas later on it disappears:     Any ideas who that's supposed to be? ...it's kinda creepy "
1713,"Why is Futaba's nickname ""Teko""?","In Episode 1 of Amanchu!, Hikari bestows the nickname ""Teko"" on Futaba, with the following explanation.            Hikari: [Gazes longingly into Futaba's eyes]        Hikari: Wow! Your eyebrows are so thin. They're, like, one-tenth as thick as the average. One-tenth...Tenth...Teko! An adorable nickname!   How did Hikari hit upon this nickname in the original Japanese? And bonus question: the translation I read of the manga translated Futaba's nickname as ""Dotty"". Was this completely out of nowhere, or does it have some justification in the original? "
1714,Couldn't Misa have told Kira L's life span?,"In the manga Death Note, when Misa meets L for the first time, she has the shinigami eyes, so she must be seeing L's lifespan at the moment. L dies a few volumes later, so couldn't Misa have alerted Kira that L was about to die, and it wasn't worth much trouble?  Is this a flaw in the manga?  It might also be the case that since L was killed by a shinigami itself, the lifespan Misa saw with her shinigami eyes didn't account for that death.  Which of these possibilities is correct? "
1715,What's the significance of revealing a character's blood type?,A lot of Anime shows will reveal the blood type of one or more of the main characters:     What's the significance of it? What purpose does it serve? Where did it come from?  
1716,Why are Bomber's friends so weak?,"Why would Bomber be hanging out with two weaklings? Neither of them even had nen power that they used.  Also, why didn't Kilua fight Bomber? It seems like his abilities would've been better to use against Bomber since he was using ranged attacks but had a good way of defending himself.  I can see why Biske didn't want to fight him but honestly, Gon seems like the weaker of him and Kilua so wouldn't it make more sense for him to fight Bomber? "
1717,Naruto juubi's chakra,"When the Sage of the six paths i.e. Hagoromo and his brother Hamura defeated the juubi.    Is it that after defeating the Jubbi, Hagoromo himself sealed the whole juubi? If Hamura sealed a part of the juubi inside him too, does it mean that we haven't seen the full power of the juubi in the battle?  "
1718,How is Amon able to revoke someone's bending?,"It was never fully explained how, despite him being a great water bender and blood bender, how was Amon able to remove someone's bending?

He also tried summoning another coffin but Hiruzen successfully stopped it.   Who was inside that third coffin? It can't be the Fourth Hokage right? Because that time, he was still under the Shiki Fuujin Seal. "

1721,Does Ultra Instinct have a larger multiplier than Potara fusion?,"So in Dragon Ball Heroes is pretty clear, Goku Ultra Instinct is able to overpower Cumber, something Super Saiyan Blue Vegito Kaioken times 50 wasnt able to do. So in Dragon Ball Heroes Ultra Instinct has over 50 times a larger multiplier than Potara Fusion.  But how about the canon universe? Are there hints or statements which shows which would have a larger multiplier, Ultra Instinct or Potara fusion? "
1722,How far into the manga did the Kimi ni Todoke anime reach?,"Since the Kimi ni Todoke manga is still running, and the anime ended in 2011, it's safe to assume that the anime didn't adapt everything. However, I know that a lot of it was adapted reasonably faithfully, and I'd rather avoid rereading things which were part of the anime.  What manga chapter corresponds to the end of the second season of the anime? Also, are there any story arcs which were omitted from the anime up to that point? "
1723,How was Shibo able to take her true form?,"In Blame!'s manga version, Shibo's first appearance was in chapter 9.2. She looks ugly and more like a walking corpse. (read from left to right)    But surprisingly, in chapter 9.3, she was able to take her true form.  (read from left to right)    What did she do to re-make her physical form? On the Blame! wiki, it is stated that she used backup data, but do they ever mention how they created the physical body using 'data'? "
1724,"Can someone explain the term ""oranyan""?","I had never heard the word ""oranyan"" before reading this question. The question made it sound like the term referred to a male tsundere.  I searched this site for more mentions of ""oranyan"", but only found the linked question. I Googled for more info, but the only results I found aside from this TV Tropes page on tsundere and the question I linked above referred to the mythical founder of the Oyo Empire of Yoruba, which I'm pretty sure has nothing to do with the anime meaning of this term. The TV Tropes page just says ""oranyan"" is another word for ""tsundere"" which ""is sometimes used to refer to a male tsundere character&mdash;incorrectly since it means the complete opposite"".   TV Tropes's reputation for accuracy aside, the linguist in me wants to nitpick that statement because of its implicit prescriptivist assumptions about ""correct"" use of language; for this question, I'm going to ask that answers take the linguist's viewpoint and define ""oranyan"" as whatever the majority of people think ""oranyan"" means, and to please explain the situation if no majority definition exists, or if the majority definition differs between Japanese and Western fans.  So, here's what I'm curious about:   What's the etymology of the term ""oranyan""?  Is there any basis to TV Tropes's claim that it means the exact opposite of 'male tsundere'? In the common usage of the term, is there some difference in meaning from 'tsundere' aside from the sex of the character?  "
1725,What are the differences between the original and the re-cut versions of Psycho-Pass?,"I know that the original show has 22 episodes and the re-cut version has 11 one hour long episodes. However, I want to know if there are any major differences. What are the differences between the 2012 version and the 2014 version of Psycho-Pass? Did they add new scenes or information?  "
1726,Do vampires in strike the blood have any of the traditional story vampires flaws?,"I'm about to finish the first season of the Strike the Blood anime. So far I've noticed only 2 vampires , I dont know if I missed some, Kojou Akatsuki and Dimitrie Vatler. None of them is vulnerable to light, for example. Other traditional story vampires flaws arent shown in them. I dont know if it's so because they are particular strong or all vampires in Strike the Blood arent hurt by light or anything like that (garlic, holy water, christian crosses, etc.). How is it then?  Do vampires in strike the blood have any of the traditional story vampires flaws? "
1727,What are Elements and Maken?,"Most of the superpowers in the series seem to be related to two concepts, namely Elements and Maken. There are exceptions to this, like Himegami's Shikigami, but Elements and Maken are both referenced frequently, and they seem to be how most of the characters fight.  However, neither one was really explained, at least in the anime. It isn't really clear to me what either term means, and how they're related. It is clear that every character has a Maken, which is basically a unique ability or power, but there's a lot that's still confusing. For instance, for some characters, their Maken seems to be an item that they use in combat, while for others it's a power inside them. Haruko's Maken is said to be contained in a different dimension, and it opens a gate to the real world, and seems to almost be a living thing.  What are Maken, and how do they work? Also, what is the relationship between Elements and Maken? "
1728,Does super saiyan blue evolution exist in Dragon Ball Heroes?,"As we know, super saiyan blue evolution was a Dragon Ball Super anime-only creation. It didnt appear in the Dragon Ball Super manga or in the Dragon Ball Super Broly movie. But what about Dragon Ball Heroes? In Dragon Ball Heroes exists other Dragon Ball Super anime-only creations such as the super saiyan blue kaioken. Does the super saiyan blue evolution transformation exist in any of the versions of Dragon Ball Heroes? "
1729,"What part of Tiger & Bunny do purple, white, and green plastic bins refer to?","In an article I read recently, entitled ""Images That Do Not Make Any Sense If You Are Not A Fan"", about a Twitter hash that is currently trending, there was an image of a bunch of color-coordinated plastic bins:    The article seems to suggest that this image is somehow related to Tiger &amp; Bunny. What part of the anime are these bins referencing? "
1730,Why do Jinchuuriki die when their biju are extracted?,"When tail beasts (bijū) are extracted from their Jinchuuriki, the Jinchuuriki dies.   All seven Jinchuuriki died after the Akatsuki extracted the bijū from them. Gaara was resurrected by Chiyo using the ""One's own life reincarnation"" jutsu.   So why do Jinchuuriki die when bijū are extracted? What are the reasons behind the death of Jinchuuriki after the extraction of bijū? "
1731,Silver-haired humanoid?,"In episode 16, timecode 9:10, of That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime, Milim refers to Rimuru's human form as being a ""Silver-haired humanoid"". Here is Rimuru (right) and Milim:    Did they just have a bad translation, or does ""silver"" refer to some broader range of hues in Japanese? Or maybe Milim has some sort of weird color blindness, or sees only in black and white? I'm pretty sure most watchers have assumed Rimuru's hair color is blue, the same color as his slime form. "

Also Kirito was stabbed by Kayaba as well. How did he survive?  Was it in the novel on how they really survived? "
1734,How did the Denpa Kyoushi manga end?,"I have read the raws, but since my japanese isn't very good, I'm not entirely sure about what happened. According to what I understood, Junichirou built a time machine and went to the future. More precisely, the manga shows that he's currently at Africa. But I still have many questions:   Why exactly did he go to future? Was he ""sacrificing himself?"" Won't he come back to the present? What about his sister and friends?   I'm quite confused, as you can see. Thank you very much for your attention! "
1735,Is Gear Second still damaging Luffy?,"When Luffy first started using Gear Second, it was claimed that this was shortening his lifespan as it requires his body to work more than it normally does. Is this not the case anymore? And if not, why? What changed? Luffy has been using Gear Second in many fights now and there does not seem to be that worry anymore. Or is this something that will be addressed later in the story? "
1736,What's on the sign behind the guy with all the weapons in episode 8?,"In episode 8 of Hajimete no Gal, at around 12:59, Ranko mentions that there's tight security around the women's bath at the inn they're staying at, and then there's a cut to this sign:    It reads 完全被甲混乱, and was subtitled by Crunchyroll as ""Full Metal Jacket"". Is this right? If so, how does Full Metal Jacket have anything to do with this? "
1737,Why Akatsuki Kojou almost always use Regulus Aurum familiar for attacking?,"Akatsuki Kojou has 12 familiars. All of them werent available at first and he started to unlock them one by one, and even though Regulus Aurum was the first familiar he unlocked, he uses it once and again much more than the other familiars he unlocked later. Why is this so? Is it more handy, is it specially powerful or what? "
1738,How did Ivankov and Inazuma survive Magellan?,"So, in Chapter 545, Ivankov and Inazuma hold off Magellan. And they get covered in poison (at least Ivankov does for sure). How do they survive that? Maybe Ivankov I can understand, but how can Inazuma be defeated by Magellan and still be able to feel better enough, even with Ivankov's help, to help in the Marineford War?

1741,What is Chtholly?,"What is Chtholly in the literal sense?  In episode 7 (Home Sweet Home), it is shown that Chtholly undergoes some changes due to her meeting with Elq Hrqstn. She is proven no longer a Fairy (Leprenchauns) as Silver test fails.  If a Fairy is basically part of Elq's soul that still large enough and becomes an independent entity, does this make Chtholly a Visitor? Or is she a human? But a human requires the 'beast' aspect which she does not have. "
1742,Did Miki really never bully Shoko?,"When Shoya confronts Miki in the story to ask whether she told anyone about him bullying Shoko, Miki makes the claim that she never once badmouthed Shoko, and that she always told Shoya to stop. Miki is portrayed as manipulative, but Shoya also admits that he might not remember things correctly:     Miki is right... I probably altered my memories to make myself feel better. (Volume 5, page 112)   Could this be a case of an unreliable narrator? Can Miki's claim be validated? "

Based on the manga, it’s for decorating plants, but what exactly is it called?  Could it be a marker for flowerbeds or something? Is it something entirely unknown except to the author?  N.B : Does anyone know what did shouko said in panel 2 ?   "
1745,"Why does ""Sore Ga Seiyuu"" play other anime's OP/ED as its ending song?","I found that when I watched Sore ga Seiyuu anime, the ED songs seems from the other anime. For example, in ep. 1, they sang Evangelion OP, and in ep. 2, they sang Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei OP.  Here are some examples.   Evangelion OP ( Ep. 1 ) Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei OP ( Ep. 2 )   What's the reason they are doing that? "
1746,How does Sticky Finger ability works towards Pesci in Golden Wind?,"At the final battle of the  Grateful death arc, we could see Buccelati confront Pesci and his stand: Beach Boy using Sticky Finger. In the end of the battle, Buccelati attack Pesci repeatedly and suddenly Pesci was already rip apart into pieces. How could this happen ? I thought Sticky Finger ability was to make a zipper in an object and could open and closed the zipper so Buccelati could make a hole inside that object.   When he undone the Sticky Finger ability, the pieces would return back to normal body, without the body rip apart. But in pesci case, it seems the torn part didn't back to main body part. This is the scene where Pesci was rip apart by Sticky Finger "
1747,Dragonball Z different versions,"So as I understand there are four versions of Dragonball Z Anime (correct me if I am wrong with this):   Japanese version / Subtitles in English Funimation version Ocean Dub Dragonball Kai   So I am going through rewatching the episodes with my wife for her first time and am watching a version that seems ""less censored"" than what I remember watching. There is a lot of blood and swearing, which I am actually ok with as it makes it more realistic in my mind but which version would this be? It would not be the one that played on Toonami I am guessing.  My second question is, plot wise are there any major differences between the uncensored one that I am watching vs the more censored one? I just got to the start of the Freiza Saga and noticed that in the Saiyin Saga for example Gohan never mentioned where he wanted to invite Piccolo to his birthday party. This isn't a huge deal in plot but I was wondering if anyone who has watched both versions noticed anything bigger? I would think more or less that the uncensored version = censored version + a bit more.  One thing that really shocked me is that in the uncensored version, Goku finds out that he transformed into the Ape form and killed his grandpa when he was little, whereas the uncensored never mentions this. This seems to be a huge deal of him finding out or not!  I do notice that the music is quite different as well and IMO the uncensored music is better than I remember. It sounds like a full orchestra performing it each episode. "
1748,Why did Frieza trick Frost?,"Frieza pretended to work with Frost only so he could cheap shot Frost for an easy elimination. However, Frieza is very powerful in his golden form, much more than Frost. Why did he go through the trouble of tricking Frost if he could've just easily eliminated him the traditional way? Did Frost really pose such a threat to Frieza? "
1749,When does the Dragon Ball Super Broly movies occur in the series,Which episodes of Dragon Ball Super does the Dragon Ball Super Broly movie come in between? So if I was to watch Dragon Ball Super to make sense of the story in the movie which episodes should I have watched?  
1750,Dragonball Z - Rule for dragonballs,"This may be a question that can't be answered but I figured it may be a little fun to try anyways. I know the rules that are established about the dragonballs:   1 (original earth) /2 (later on earth) /3 wishes (Namek) depending on which version you have. Wish can't exceed the creator's power If the earth dragonballs then can't make the same wish twice   So in rewatching the series with my wife recently, when they are on Namek she asked if they could just take the balls into space to hide them which is a great question IMO. Freiza, or Vegeta for that matter, could have just parked their space ship floating over Namek or on some moon or close by planet and had it come get them every so often to deposit found dragon balls, or in Freiza's case where he doesn't need air to breathe he could just fly away with them.   So are there any rules about the dragon balls leaving the planet to which they were created on? Would they turn to stone? Would they just not work? "
1751,Who is the idol Yuna in Sword Art Online: Ordinal Scale?,"In Sword Art Online: Ordinal Scale, Shigemura is the creator of Ordinal Scale and is trying to recreate his dead daughter Yuna as an AI. Now, during the movie, we see two versions of Yuna. The first one wears an idol costume and appears at event battles to sing (I will call her ""idol-Yuna""). The second one wears a hoodie and appears to Kirito to point him in the right direction (I will call her ""hoodie-Yuna"").  By the end of the movie, I was under the impression that idol-Yuna was a throwaway data collection AI created by Shigemura. I thought that her purpose was to collect information so Shigemura could create hoodie-Yuna, who would be the true recreation of his daughter. However, in discussions and reviews other people have told me that idol-Yuna was the daughter AI, and that idol-Yuna and hoodie-Yuna were the same.  Were there two different Yuna's, a data collection program and a copy of the daughter? Or was there one Yuna and she only changed appearance? "
1752,How did the young man take his turn? (spoilers),"The sequence of events:   The old man pots the two balls The younger man attacks him just as they are potted The old man dies (or is knocked out or something) in the fight Young man returns to the table and proceeds to pot the rest of his balls   After the old man pots the balls, surely it's still his turn as he scored? Or did the rules of billiards that they were using not necessarily have turns? Or maybe he used the old man's body and made him miss?  Is there any proper answer to this, or is this just a big plot hole that was skipped over? "
1753,"Were Judeo-Christian religious references part of the ""Akira"" movie's original dialogue?","The animated Akira movie (not the manga) contains a number of explicit Judeo-Christian religious terms, in addition to the overall apocalyptic themes. The most prominent of these (from the 2001 dub) are:   When the citizens of Neo-Tokyo see Tetsuo deflect tank shells and destroy helicopters and tanks, somebody shouts out, ""It's the Great Awakening!"" while another says, ""Don't be fooled! This isn't the Rapture! He's a false messiah!""  Later, Lady Miyako appears with her entourage and, during the chaos of battle, chants, ""Burn all the unclean believers of our time! Give yourselves into the flames, children, you will all be born again. Consume our hearts! Wash our unclean hearts in the eternal fire!""   While different cuts of the movie may be of different runtimes, the scenes I'm referring to occur from approximately 1:06:00 (Tetsuo walking out of the smoke of the exploding helicopter) until 1:08:00 (Nezu's escape), and then 1:10:00 (Miyako's entourage) until 1:12:00 (Tetsuo destroys the bridge).   Were these religious references, extremely familiar to American Christian society, part of the original Japanese dialogue, or were they 'westernized' for the English dub? What was the meaning of these quotes in the original Japanese context? (e.g., did it refer to messianic figures or raptures etc?) "
1754,"Does Fairy Tail have one main goal / plot, or is it just many separate stories?","Does Fairy Tail have one major plot line that is developed along the hundreds of episodes it has, or does it simply have many ""chunks"" of unrelated adventures (in blocks of a few episodes)?  For example, in One Piece there is one main ""goal"", and even though there are several different arcs, there is a clear notion of ""progress towards the goal"" happening with every arc. Naruto, Boku no Hero Academia and Black Clover also have clear ""goals"", i.e. there is also a main plot, and the ""progress in the plot"" is clear after every canon arc, etc.   I started watching Fairy Tail (only watched 15 episodes so far) and so far I couldn't see any ""main plot"" or ""main goal"". It seems that they will simply have different adventures, by picking certain quests/missions in the guild, fulfilling the mission, coming back and repeating this loop. Surely they will probably get stronger with time, but this is not the ""progress"" I'm looking for. Is there a ""main goal"", ""main plot"" that gets slowly developed along the hundreds of episodes? Or is it just a collection of loosely-tied adventures (each taking a few episodes each)?  NOTE: Don't say what the main plot is (if it exists) - hide it in a spoiler tag. I just want to know if it exists - and if possible, what is the number of the episode in which this plot becomes clear. "
1755,Is it proven Gogeta is stronger than Beerus?,"Commentaries from dragon ball characteres many times tell us which character is stronger than other. But sometimes they seem to be wrong or contradict themselves later. With regards to Beerus, in the Dragon Ball Super manga in the times of the battle with Zamasu, it was said by Wiss if I recall correctly, than Gogeta might be as strong as Beerus. A lot of battles and training happened since that, several zenkais and Goku and Vegeta got stronger. Now in the Dragon Ball Super Broly movie, it was said by Goku that Broly might be even stronger than Beerus. If Broly is equally or stronger than Beerus, Gogeta has to be way stronger than him, since Gogeta showed to be much stronger than Broly. Is this so? Were Wiss and Goku just speculating or are there more clues sustaining the authors intended to assert this?  "
1756,Mountain Tribesmen in Hi Shin Tai,"In the manga Kingdom, several mountain tribesmen appeared as members of the Hi Shin Tai (飛信隊) during the battle against Gen Bou's (玄峰) army. These tribesmen had excellent hearing, which helped their unit escape the smokescreen trap of their enemy.  At this point the Hi Shin Tai was a ""temporary"" 1,000-member unit, so they must have joined Shin (信) sometime when they were just a 100-member unit. But was it shown or explained somewhere (what Chapter)? Were they from the same tribe as Yo Tan Wa (楊端和)?  Thanks for your time. "
1757,"In Fate, can a Master summon an Extra Class Servant during a Holy Grail War, or under any circumstances?","In Fate, can a Master summon an Extra Class Servant during a Holy Grail War, or under any circumstances?  For example, one Master summons Jeanne of the Ruler Class, and another Master summons Edmond Dantes of the Avenger Class. Can that happen? "
1758,Why do they tie their thumbs and don't use handcuffs?,"I've seen lots of animes where a character is caught and interrogated by some authority. The captive is usually depicted sitting on the chair in the interrogation room. But instead of being handcuffed, their thumbs are tied with a zip tie.  Why? Is there a meaning? It's so weird! Is it common to use zip ties to restrain criminals in Japan? I'm confused.  No this is not some kinky anime; I don't watch that stuff, it's an action based anime, more specifically, AICO incarnation or something like that.  "
1759,How strong is Hatchiyack in Dragon Ball?,"IIRC, Hatchiyack in the OVA plan to eradicate the saiyans was able to fight Piccolo, Goku SSJ, Gohan SSJ, Vegeta SSJ and Trunks SSJ? How strong is he supposed to be compared to saiyans now in Dragon Ball Heroes and before in his first appearence? "
1760,What role is Hikari playing?,"In the latest installment of Digimon Adventures Tri., we witness      Taichi becoming buried in a seismic fissure caused by the fights, and Hikari reacting to her brother's apparent death.   But this particular instance is strange, because we notice something...unusual about Hikari.  From the looks of it, she's covered in DigiCode.     This feels a little familiar, because a long time ago in Digimon Adventure 02, something somewhat similar happened.    The above is taken from Digimon Adventure 02, episode 13.  Maybe I'm getting my memories mixed up here since I last saw that show something on the order of 17 years ago, so I don't know if this is entirely similar, but it feels incredibly familiar.  ...But given all of this, and given the fact that      ...thanks to that DigiCode coming from her, TailmonOphanimon Fall Down Mode and Meicoomon have fused into some... thing, which seems to play right into the hands of the over bad-guys...   ...what role specifically is Hikari playing in all of this?  Is it possible that this could've been forseen by Ygdrasil or Homeostasis, and was Hikari preconditioned for something like this to happen?  Or...am I overthinking this and      was it just a reaction to her witnessing her brother's death?  "
1761,What's the basis for the gender of Black Hanekawa as reported on the wikia?,"The wikia for the Monogatari states that Black Hanekawa is     Male (Physically Female)   After seeing a blogger describe their experience of seeing this and concluding that Hanekawa is nonbinary (a conclusion which to be honest I was a bit suspicious of for reasons I'm not going into, since they're off-topic), I ended up with several questions:   Where is such a description of Black Hanekawa stated? Or is there no explicit in-text reference for this? Can this idea at least be drawn from other details in the ""text""? If such a conclusion about Black Hanekawa actually exists, why is the gender of Black Hanekawa what it is?   The most likely answer to me is that Black Hanekawa is based off of Hanekawa so the apparition will have female traits, but since the ""sawari neko"" itself has a gender, we have this discrepancy. But I'm not sure how true this is - it's possible that it was mentioned somewhere that the ""sawari neko"" is male (perhaps in Oshino's descriptions of it), but I don't remember this with complete certainty. "
1762,Sources for Christian themes and motifs in Naruto?,"Compared to some of its contemporary shounen titles, Naruto draws heavily on a variety of religious and mythological sources to inform its narrative, themes and cosmology. Kishimoto's use of explicit Hindu, Buddhist and Shinto motifs has already been discussed in a number of places. Common elements identified include deity names for jutsu, shamanic activities such as obtaining the eyes of others to 'see' as they do, making pacts with animal and other nature spirits, summoning 'demons' such as Susanoo, etc (Shinto, heavily associated with the Uchiha clan); Jimmu Tenno motifs for both Rikodu Sanin and later Naruto himself, such as his magatama and staff of 6 rings, manifestation of Gedo Mazu upon a lotus, etc (Buddhist, heavily associated with the Senjuu/Uzumaki clans); chakra, the 6 lokas (worlds) and 6 components of the bhavachakra corresponding to the 6 paths of Pein and referenced with the Rikodu Sanin as well, the Garuda, Jashin religion (apparently influenced by the Thug cult) and the battle between Indra and the Ashuras, complete with spiky hair imagery for his protagonist (and to a lesser extent the antagonist) frequently associated with ashuras (who are known for great rage and passion) - probably derived from Toriyama's Dragonball, a major influence on Kishimoto (Hindu, many elements absorbed into Mahayana Buddhist culture).   However, relatively little work has been done examining Christian influences to date, though some have already pointed out elsewhere that there seem to be a number of Christian references appearing, especially towards the end of manga/anime series, for example:   Kaguya, a woman who ate forbidden fruit from a powerful tree and brought powerful but potentially evil forces into the world (chakra from the chakra tree) (Eve); two of her descendants who were ""brothers"" (Asura/Indra then Naruto/Sasuke) fighting each other (Cain and Abel, Jacob and Esau); Sasuke, a betrayer who turned his back on his best friend for personal gain (Judas), yet Naruto repeatedly attempts to win him back, even to the extent of proclaiming his willingness to die in the effort (Jesus, the good shepherd); this eventually works and Sasuke repents and seeks forgiveness for his behavior (prodigal son);  Naruto as a messiah figure who was prophesied (by the Toad Sage) to save the world (plus his 'Christ the Redeemer' poses on high points, e.g. chap. 245); Naruto as the new Sage, who was the progenitor of the ninja world (Jesus as the new Adam); wooden memorial crosses marking the graves of Zabuza and Haku; frequency of resurrection jutsu (by Pein, Madara, Kabuto etc), even mass resurrections of the dead; Adam Barkman has suggested the use of crucifixion motifs (presumably referring to Kakashi's tortue by Itachi and/or the rongusodo ninja ato: waiya haritsuke jutsu) as having Christian significance.   The heavy use of religous and mythological themes at the heart of Naruto, suggests that these may not be coincidental parallels. (This does not necessarily suggest that these examples were exclusively derived from Christian sources, e.g. the cosmic conflict between Naruto/Sasuke could be influenced by the primordial 'brotherly' conflicts in both Hinduism (Indra vs the Ashuras) and Christianity (Cain vs Abel) simultaneously.)  One potential source for such themes could be Kishimoto's favorite movie The Matrix, known to be a source of some artistic inspiration as well (The Art of Naruto: Uzumaki, 2007), which is filled with many overt Christian themes and images.  Is anyone aware of other sources that discuss Christian influences and sources on the text, e.g. interviews with Kishimoto, academic texts, discussion groups, etc? "
1763,What shows inspired Sword Art Online?,"One of the biggest criticisms I've heard of Sword Art Online is that it's derivative; the ""trapped in a video game"" plot has been done before, and presumably better, by other anime.  But nobody bothers to mention which anime has done it before. Doing my own research I came across Log Horizon, although it would seem to me that if it were the only one it would get mentioned by name.  So which shows predate Sword Art Online that have the same basic plot?  Has Reki Kawahara ever said that he drew inspiration from a particular show? "
1764,To what extent is Momonga living in the current world in which this anime is set?,"Did the human body of Momonga transform itself into his character in the game? If that's the case, his soul should be in this character.  Or is it something similar to SAO in which his original body is still in the ""human world"", but his soul (or consciousness) in the ""game world""?  Or could it be that Momonga is with his soul and human body in his own world and sits in front of his computer playing this realistic game? "

In Volume 1, Shouko got bullied. Did she feel this way about Ishida back in elementary school? Did the author ever mention it on manga/anime ?  "
1767,How important was the invention of blue towards anime?,"In the video of Vsauce2 it is mentioned that      Prussian blue ... it reinvigorated Japanese wood block painting, which went on to influence manga which led to Japanese animation   The phrasing makes it sound like the invention of this Prussian blue is one of the key factors towards the development of Japanese animation or anime.  But was this invention really a key factor towards the creation of anime? Or did this Prussian blue really have a an effect to the creation of Anime at all? "
1768,Who is this group of people that have a beef with Shizuo?,"In episode 25 of Durarara!! (the second special episode), three groups of people try to attack Shizuo upon seeing on TV that he and Izaya are fighting.       The first group consists of some of the ruffians that Shizuo beat up in episode 3. Naturally, they'd want revenge on Shizuo. The third group is a bunch of members of the Yellow Scarves. The Yellow Scarves generally perceive Shizuo as standing in the way of their plans for Ikebukuro, so I can see why they'd want to take him out, too.  I do not recognize the second group, though (and I just rewatched the whole first season). Who are they? "
1769,"Corrupted Grail Fragments inside Sakura, and Illya's heart",Do the corrupted Grail fragments that Zokuen synthesised with his worms which were later placed in Sakura have a direct connection with Angra Mainyu inside the Grail? I know the fragments are the remnants of the Lesser Grail of the 4th HGW and are corrupted because Angra used the Lesser Grail to activate the Greater Grail and unleash his curses but can he control the fraagments after they were implanted inside the worms? And what about Illya's heart which is the Lesser Grail of the 5th war? 
1770,Hyperdimension Neptunia orderly list of dungeons appearance,"So, what is the orderly list of appearance of the game's dungeons in the anime? I'm pretty sure that based on the enemy (Dogoo) and the landscape, the first dungeon showed in the anime is Virtua Forest, but what about the rest, like the R-18 island? And since the game consist of several series, which version of the game the featured dungeon is based on?  Note: I played Rebirth 2 and only tried the prologue of Rebirth 1. But so far I can tell, the world map is different and the landscape of the first dungeon (both are Virtua Forest) is different too. Therefore, in the answer please specify which version of the game. "
1771,Would it make sense for there to be a new category of episodes between filler and canon?,"There are plenty of anime that have a lot of filler, such as Naruto or Bleach. However, there are a lot of filler episodes that fit completely in the storyline, and could easily have happened.  Wouldn't it make sense for the mangaka to declare some of these as canon?  This would clearly satisfy the audience as it kills a lot of people to see good content that didn't really happen. But building on this, would it be plausible for the mangaka to create a new category of episodes in between filler and canon that simply labels episodes as correct so people can watch them, but skip over them since they don't contribute to the plot? This would seem like a step up since there is a clear distinction between outrageously impossible filler and filler that could actually have occurred. "

1773,Can all Saiyans become a Legendary Super Saiyan?,"Legendary Super Saiyan requires one to have consciousness while maintaining the form. What we have seen so far (canon and non-canon) was the berserk state, where the user is simply out of control.   As we know in order to attain Super Saiyan 4 one needs to have consciousness during the Golden Great Ape state. The Great Ape forms have been known for all Saiyans to be a berserk state that can only be triggered when specific conditions have been met. The user is ""rewarded"" with tremendous power, but no control. This all is extremely similar to Legendary Super Saiyan Berserk. Once the user gets consciousness in the state he/she can then evolve into the next stage, which would be Super Saiyan 4 (for Golden Great Ape) or Legendary Super Saiyan (for Legendary Super Saiyan Berserk).  Since both forms (LSSJ and SSJ4) require the same amount of consciousness and mental fortitude, does this mean that they are basically the same? I found it extremely difficult to find some actual information on the progress of the two being unlocked so therefor this conclusion is purely theoretical.  Assuming they are, all Saiyans are able to become a Super Saiyan 4 with enough training, consciousness etc. Are all Saiyans also able to become a Legendary Super Saiyan or is it purely genetic? From what I've seen so far, the only distinctive features it has, is emitting enormous amounts of ki. We have seen that Saiyans were leaking ki all over the place, so in that sense it should be possible for all Saiyans eventually, or am I completely wrong?  Sources: mainly dragonball wikia, Reddit, the series from which DBGT for knowledge about SSJ4, DBZ+DBS for knowledge about LSSJ and DBS for Whis explaining loads of things.  "
1774,How does Tsumugi accelerate?,"Well, when Tsumugi is moving around in the space, she creates a Higgs particle jet just like a Gardes. Now, Gardes clearly creates the jet from its engine, but how about Tsumugi? Does she...fart? Is that it? Does she fart Higgs particles to jet around?  The reason I asked this is that a human's fart contains methane which is combustible. And since Tsumugi is shown to produce a blue jet of Higgs particles from under her dress... Does a similar mechanism apply here? "

When she first meets Desco she recognizes her to be the one who attacked her and believes the dream/nightmare is a result of being knocked out.  When the Hades Party goes to Earth Fuka found out that Des-X was the one who killed her, and since Des-X looks the exact same as Desco it explains why Fuka thought it was Desco.  But before invading the Information Bureau Desco admits she never met Fuka before, yet from the moment she was released she knew who she was (wanting to demonstrate her power to her Big Sis) and it seems Desco had been sealed up for quite some time given the other inmates and Axel knew about her (so she hadn't just arrived).  What I would like to know is the order of events between Fuka, Desco and Des-X such as which came first, Desco being locked away in Hades or Fuka being killed? And also how Desco knew who Fuka was despite never seeing her before? "

1778,"In what order should I watch the various parts of Love, Chuunibyou & other Delusions?","Now I noticed that this question has been slightly answered before but for absolute clarity, I need to know.  I came across these titles.    Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! Lite Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! Ren Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! Ren Lite Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! Ren Specials Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! Ren: The Rikka Wars Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! The Movie Lite   Now because of my lack of knowledge as far as OVAs, ONAs, base series, and movies go in the anime genre exactly what is the chronological order of this list? And is it missing any titles from this series?  Oh, and I just finished the first season and if anything I know that I am supposed to watch the first lite series next right? Then the movie?

1779,What made Sakuya decide to switch sides?,"In Rewrite, Sakuya, Chihaya's butler, is nothing but antagonistic towards the protagonist Kotarou from the moment they first meet. He calls him insulting names and is generally just a bit of an asshole. It later turns out that both he and Chihaya are working for Gaia, the eco-terrorist group who want to destroy all human life      (and who ultimately succeed in the final episode of Season 1).   Then, around Episode 8 or so, he randomly shows up in the magic forest and saves Kotarou's life. He announces he's now working with Kotarou and friends against Gaia, offers to train Kotarou, and becomes considerably less antagonistic towards him. Absolutely no explanation is given for this, and to me it seemed to come completely out of left-field.  What prompted Sakuya to change sides like that so suddenly? I think Chihaya may have already defected by this point, but surely that can't be the only reason? "

What does it mean? What can't be said on TV? Was this an in-joke based on a difference between the anime and the written material? "
1782,Why are llamas/alpacas so popular in anime?,This has been something that has been bugging me for a while:  Why are there so many llamas in anime and in anime fan culture?  Some specific anime examples:      You can buy alpacas at conventions too:    Where is this coming from? Why do I keep seeing llamas?! I don't believe llamas/alpaca are even native to Japan?

1788,Confusion about the naming of Aldnoah Zero's OST/opening/ending song titles,"I have a couple of very closely related questions regarding composer Hiroyuki Sawano's choices in naming Aldnoah Zero's OST/opening/ending song titles.  I will be referencing the tracklist for Aldnoah Zero's OST (link here), in addition to some opening/closing songs that are co-composed by Hiroyuki Sawano including ""aLIEz"", ""A/Z"", and ""&amp;Z"".  First, most of the song titles include special/non-alphabetical/non-English characters (even if the title is clearly meant  an actual word like ""robot"" or ""breathless""). Here are some examples:   R零B零T BRE@TH//LESS Ch19ヲFIRE★   Why did Hiroyuki Sawano decide to include all the special characters? Is there any significance in using them? To me, they are unnecessary, but I hesitate to claim that they are indeed unnecessary because they might actually have some meaning that I am not seeing.  My other question is why are some song titles seemingly extra-arbitrarily named? I realize that these are songs, so the composer can name them whatever he likes, but some song titles seem completely out of the blue to me.   I realize that there are explanations for the names of some OST tracks in the wiki that I linked.   For example, the song ""AD2014-7.5/7.9-零・A"" is named because ""2014 07-05 / 07-09 [are] ALDONAH.ZERO's air dates on Tokyo MX and ABC respectively"".   The explanation tells me WHAT the song is named after, but it does not tell me WHY is the song named after something as arbitrary as an air date for the show. OST track titles usually relate to what the song actually attempts to convey to the listener, or relates to the scene in the animation, but I cannot see how an air date relates to either.  Finally, I do not understand where the openings/ending names come from. What do the names ""aLIEz"", ""A/Z"" and ""&amp;Z"" mean exactly, and why are they named that way? "
1789,Soundtrack for Yamada-kun to 7-nin no Majo TV anime,"Does anyone know who composed the original soundtrack for the TV anime ""Yamada-kun to 7-nin no Majo""?

1790,Is it common for seiyū's to also be singers?,"While listening to the Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha Openings I noticed that the first 4 Opening songs (Original Series - StrikerS) were all sung by Nana Mizuki, the seiyū of Fate Testarossa. Looking at her Wikipedia Page I've also noticed that she's also been the seiyū for Hinata Hyuga in the Naruto Movies.  Now the other groups I know of who did Openings/Endings are FLOW, ALI PROJECT, ORANGE RANGE, Kalafina and ClariS, but I do not know if any singer of these groups were also a seiyū for any series (particularly ones their music was in) but I am wondering if it is common for a seiyū to also be a singer?   If so, is it also expected that if a singer sung the Opening/Ending Theme (or Insert Songs) they will also score a character role in the series? "

1795,Why is Kischur Zelretch Schweinorg both a Dead Apostle Ancestor and Wizard Marshall of the Mage's Association?,"It's my impression that the Twenty-seven Dead Apostle Ancestors as a group are loosely organized, or are at least affiliated with each other in some way. They're also generally hostile to both The Church and the Mage's Association. Furthermore, Dead Apostles in general have proven to be extremely antagonistic towards humans.  This begs the question: why is Zelretch seemingly tolerated by both groups?   Also worth noting here is that he is described as an ally of humanity and True Ancestors in the Type Moon Wiki. This begs a more general question - how can he be all of these contradictory things at once? "
1796,How is it that people in ALO didn't recognize Kirito?,"So, I've been enjoying SAO quite a bit more than I thought I would. My only thing is, why has no one in ALO even questioned if Kirito is the same Kirito from SAO? Especially his sister? I'm going on the assumption that their would have been some sort of news when he got out of the game, and that his character name would be mentioned. I know that if I see a character with the same name in multiple MMO's, I at least ask if they are the same person. I have to believe that SOMEONE would recognize the name at least.  Also, thinking back on it, I remember them reading something, seemingly the internet, inside SAO, that listed the news of what was going on in the game. So surely this was available to the outside world as well? "
1797,Actually how deaf is Shouko in Koe no Katachi and is it revealed why she is only wearing 1 hearing aid?,"As it's already been stated in a similar question, Shouko's not completely deaf, but it's still very severe as she wasn't able to understand people clearly. It seems to be very blurry as shown in chapter 51 of the manga.  But e.g. the scene on the Ferris wheel in which Naoka talks to Shouko, it seems that Shouko is able to understand what Naoka's talking (I'm not sure though, as she only answered ""I'm sorry"" which Shouko says a lot). Naoka deliberately talked very slowly. So, is it safe to assume that Shouko is and has always been able to understand people when they're talking slow enough?  If it wasn't the case when she was still a child, has her sense of hearing been improved until now to the point in which Shouko's able to understand people clearly when they talk slow enough? If I'm not mistaken, depending on the type of deafness, it is possible to stimulate the regeneration of the hearing ability through medicaments, clinical interventions or sometimes even without any interventions.  And why is she only wearing one hearing aid? Is it a repercussion of the time where Shouya damaged her ear? If yes, how badly injured is that ear? "
1798,"What does the position of ""theme song assistance""(?) entail?","Over the past 3-4 years, I've been noticing a number of anime that credit a person named 外村敬一 (""SOTOMURA Keiichi"", it seems) with 主題歌協力 - something like ""theme song assistance"". This credit, when present, usually appears on the same overlay as the four usual credits for the OP/ED song (vocalist, lyricist, arranger, composer). There are exceptions, though, like the Durarara!! Shou OP ""Headhunt"", where it appears on the following overlay.  Note that the list of credits on ANN I linked to above is non-exhaustive - I'm pretty sure (just based on my vague recollection of having seen this guy's name over and over) there are a lot more credits for this Sotomura fellow that they haven't added to their database yet. For example, he is credited on ""Connect"" (the Madoka Magica TV OP), but isn't listed as such on ANN:    Two questions:   What does this position entail? Why have I never seen anyone besides Sotomura Keiichi be credited with it?   "
1799,When do the events of Prince de la Bun take place?,"In one of the anecdotes in McDull, Prince de la Bun, McDull makes a comment (a bit after 19 minutes) about how his single mother takes J.K. Rowling's success as encouragement for her to continue recounting her stories. Thus, the ""present day"" portion of the film must have occurred after the first Harry Potter book was published (so at the earliest, post-1997). The mention of 两文三语 (an oft-used phrase by the Hong Kong government) approximately six minutes in corroborates this (at least per my reading of this Chinese Wikipedia article). Moreover, we see at 1:04:48 that the grave plot Mrs. Mak has reserved has a mobile phone number on its sign, which might push the date even later.  What I'm having trouble figuring out is what years the portions of the film that concern Mrs. Mak's younger years where she interacts with McDull's father (McBing) correspond to. I might expect the section that comes before McBing meets with  Mrs. Mak to have a looser correspondence to actual history, since it's more overtly fantasy, but the portion I'm concerned with seems to explicitly take place in some older version of Hong Kong.   About nine minutes in, there is old footage of workers at a factory (with Mrs. Mak's face superimposed on one of the worker's, as this is meant to be a recollection of her younger years), but I can't identify the year of it. After 47:00, we see the destruction of a floating restaurant, but I'm unsure if this is supposed to correspond to anything. The boat is still burning when McBing leaves Mrs. Mak, so it would appear that the entire sequence (between him meeting up with her and him leaving) is supposed to take place within a short period of time. (Then again, maybe this is just a fantasy element?) There are some posters on the walls (of celebrities I don't recognise) after 47:30. At 49:23, we see a member of the police stand atop a raised platform to direct traffic. From what I am aware of, this practice was definitely gone by the 2000's in Hong Kong, and I don't think it was used much (if at all) in the 1990's. At 50:49, McBing pays the fortune teller with a bunch of colonial one-dollar notes. Wikipedia tells me that 1 HKD notes were phased out in 1960. (That this is used at all and that there is a copy of The Little Prince on the shelf at 55:45 indicates that this should be post-WWII.)   Is there a consistent sense of when this period corresponds to, if at all? I'm starting to get the impression that some of the evidence may even be contradictory: if McDull is still in kindergarten in the ""present day"" period (see 2:05) and his father is really McBing, it would be odd for McBing to have left before 1990 (which would seem at odds with some of the other details). But it occurs to me that I might just be too unfamiliar with the historical context to judge properly, so I am looking for confirmation. "
1800,What was the moral of Sasuke and Orochimaru's arcs across the Naruto series? Was there any?,"So Naruto Gaiden has concluded, and it featured both Sasuke and Orochimaru in his latest iteration. Which again raises the question, what exactly was the moral of the story for these two?  The Naruto series excelled at emphasizing certain moral behaviors to its readers/viewers: e.g., with hard work, determination, self-confidence, and a will to succeed, even a loser or social outcast can reach the top; love and understanding each other on a deeper level can solve any problem and bring out all you're actually capable of; kindness and compassion towards wild 'Beasts' can lead to positive results; it's important never to abandon your friends and family; etc etc. All very good, solid shounen values!  So what do the lives of Sasuke and Orochimaru teach us (if anything) from their character arcs? By the end of Shipuden neither has really repented or shown remorse for their bad behavior (simple ""sorries"" do not cut it), both have done horrible things (murder, hideous human experimentation, etc) for which they are never punished (Sasuke is pardoned, Orochimaru's 'imprisonment' in Gaiden is pretty milquetoast, and he's even allowed to continue researching with his assistants!), and it is implied that they got a free pass for the simple reason that they joined forces with the Shinobi Alliance to destroy a common threat that was even worse (and one which was against their own interests to see succeed anyway!). Even then, Sasuke attempted to hijack things at the last minute and take over the world, only relenting when he was soundly defeated (i.e., he stopped when it was no longer possible for him to achieve his ends!). Yet both are still allowed to do pretty much whatever they please for the next decade or two. So what are we to make of all this? Do whatever you want and if you have powerful enough friends, you can get away with it, and keep on doing whatever you want? "
1801,Who is this mystery girl with blue hair?,"In Captain Earth, there is a girl that appears only in two occasions during the series, when Daichi gets his Livlaster, and at the ending.  She is featured in the opening, so at first I confused her with Setsuna, but the hairstyle was different (huge giveaway they were not the same person).  So who is this ex-machina-lady? (huge spoiler if I had to explain why the ex-machina part)    Some speculation in the talk page for Hana Mutou put her as the human form of the Space Squirrel Pitz, the incarnation of the Livlaster, or something otherwise.  Since that is just speculation, I would like to rule that source out. Can anyone point another source to her bio? "
1802,"What were the circumstances surrounding Niekawa Haruna being ""infected""?","As we learn in the second cour of the first season of Durarara!!, Niekawa Haruna is the Saika-wielder primarily responsible for the slashing incidents that have been plaguing Ikebukuro for a while.   In episode 17, when Anri reveals herself to be the true bearer of Saika, Niekawa realizes that it must have been Anri that slashed and ""infected"" her with Saika.   But, according to Shinra, Saika had been dormant for some five years prior - starting when Anri took possession of Saika after her parents' death, and ending presumably when the current series of slashing incidents began.   When did Anri slash Haruna? And why? I would think that if Anri had slashed her during Saika's supposed period of dormancy, somebody would have found out about it, at least.  "
1803,"What's with the ""x"" in ""Hunter x Hunter"" (and other anime/manga)?","I am wondering what the ""x"" in ""Hunter x Hunter"" means. To clarify: I am also talking about what the ""x"" means in general as many other anime/manga also have it in their titles.  A quick Google search for this question returns a Yahoo answer result which claims that the ""x"" is just for style and has no meaning whatsoever. Is this correct? Does this also apply to other anime? "

I wonder why him, specifically, seeing how Uvo left earlier than him.  Or should it be assumed that Kalluto just took Hisoka's number? "
1806,Are the Iris's the same person?,"In the Atelier Iris series, all 3 games have character called Iris.  In Atelier Iris: Eternal Mana and Atelier Iris 2: The Azoth of Destiny, they both have Iris Blanchimont. In the first game, she is a great Alchemist who practices the many teachings of  (with the exception of Mull) and she befriended the Mana.      She, however, passed away long before the start of the game from fighting Amalgam, leaving only her final creation Lita and the materials and formula to create the Ruby Prism   This is Iris in the first game:    In the second game, she appears as a small child who is taken in by Viese Blanchimont as her sister (though one could speculate that Viese and Felt one day married and adopted Iris as their daughter).      Later, we learn that she has the reincarnated powers of Lilith, the Creation Mana, who looks a lot like her, which explains her talents in alchemy.   Also in Belkhyde, there are placed like the Tower of Marcus and the Cleft of Nelva      And at the end, Lilith's power releases Mana throughout Belkhyde which makes Alchemy possible again.   This is Iris in the second game:    I just started playing Atelier Iris 3: Grand Phantasm and found out the Iris in this game is named Iris Fortner. It's mentioned she was raised by a family of Alchemists. However, when she talks to Yach about how she made the Heal Jars for the quest, he doesn't believe her and Edge indicates that Alchemists are rare (kinda like what was mentioned in the first game with Klein). Furthermore, it seems no one know about Mana and the world seems disjointed with other worlds called Afterworlds.  This is Iris Fortner:    They all look similar, and the first 2 games hint at a direct connection (with Iris's last name and how she would learn Alchemy). Is Iris Fortner the same as Iris Blanchimont (being a younger version of her from Atelier Iris 1)?   If that is not the case, is there a deeper connection to her and the game's title? Apart from her looking like the previous Iris, being an Alchemist and being a main character from the very start. "
1807,Is Sasuke serious about rebuilding the Uchiha clan?,"Is Sasuke actually serious about ever restoring his clan?  Restoring the Uchiha clan, both in population and prestige, was the second of Sasuke's two major life goals since the beginning of the Naruto series. Yet by 700, some 20 years after the massacre, he has so far succeeded in producing only a single Uchiha heir. If we include Sakura, that's only 2 additional Uchiha in that entire time! Given the highly dangerous shinobi training regime and overall risky lifestyle, isn't it  reckless to rely on Sarada alone to carry the tribal line, especially given the number of children he'd need to create a minimal viable population (MVP): sustainability levels for vertibrate mammals is generally estimated at 500 to 1000 individuals, but given there's a whole village of Konoha to interbreed with, let's be generous and say only 5% of that number would be needed (25-35). If so, then Sasuke really should be having in the order of 12 children (who, if each of those keeps up near that birthrate, the Uchiha clan would be fully restored within 2-3 generations!) I know it's common for contemporary Japanese families to produce only one or two children at most, so it's what the readers would be used to, but this is ancient/different dimension Japan!   What exactly is he waiting for?  (Maybe Shin will have to step up to the plate instead, or Orochimaru making a ton of test tube Uchiha babies, haha!) "
1808,How and why do the characters speak Japanese?,"In Ente Isla they have their own language, and I don't think the people there (especially the ones living on the land) know anything about Japan or Earth. So how could Emilia, her father and that one guy carrying that cart (in the flashback) speak fluent Japanese?  And if they actually know Japanese, why don't they speak it all the time?  "
1809,Has anyone ever gotten hurt in Girls Und Panzer?,"In the world of Girls Und Panzer, tankery (Sensha-do) is a school activity, and during practice and competitions, they appear to be using live ammunition. Has anyone ever gotten hurt (or killed) doing Sensha-do in the manga? It seems really dangerous:      There's even a flashback scene where a tank driven over mud next to a river falls into the river, and the girls inside almost drowned.   Or is it just that in this world, tanks and large shells simply aren't that dangerous? "
1810,"Which one has the ""Telepathic Kiss"" power: Hana or Daichi?","In the ending of the series, Daichi kisses Hana, and Puck is surprised to see they are doing a telepathic kiss between them.   Since that power works both ways, it's hard to pinpoint who has the power (because it is activated even if unwilling).  So, which one of the lovey doveys has the telepathic kiss power? Hana or Daichi?  Hana is biologically engineered from the Planetary Gears' royalty DNA, so she might be the one.  Daichi has just prestige-classed into ""Badass Protagonist"" because the stakes were raised and he had to beat the final boss alone. If he could learn how to teleport his Mecha in such a short time, why not?  And please back your answer with sources, if possible. Lets keep it the least subjective possible.     P.S.: In advance, I apologize for any time lost visiting TvTropes. Always mouse over links before clicking away.  "
1811,Is Togusa a cyborg in GITS:Arise?,"In the other anime movies and series, it is often mentioned that Togusa is 'natural' and that he is not a cyborg. However, in the last episode of Arise, he obviously got ghost-hacked.  Did I miss something, or is Arise inconsistent with the rest of the anime? What would be the point of having him on the team if he is just as prone to hacking as the other members? "
1812,What happened to Maria and Mamoru?,"I know that Maria and Mamoru      escaped the village and erased their tracks, making it impossible for even their own friends to locate them. The Bakenezumi (I do not know the canon transliteration) even assisted their escape by preparing fake remains for the villagers to find, so as to convince them of Maria and Mamoru's death.   However, the Bakenezumi are later shown to have possession of      their daughter.   How is this possible? Could it be that Maria and Mamoru      were captured by Squealer and forced to have a child?   In fact, the ethics committee later commented that      the remains they found matched entirely to the DNA records of the village. Does that mean that the remains really belonged to Maria and Mamoru, and they were killed after they were deemed to be of no use?   Does the novel explain this? I apologize if i jump to paranoid conclusions, but this possibility sounds too scary. "
1813,"Where do ""fiends"" get their abnormal strength?","""Fiends"" have tremendous killing potential, because they actively try to kill humans who cannot retaliate due to psychological and genetic safeguards against violence.   However, I have not seen anything that indicates that they have a particularly powerful Cantus. Is their ability not the same as that of a regular human?  I am raising this doubt, because      Maria and Mamoru's daughter could defeat the strongest Cantus user in the village at such a young age.   Did I perhaps miss some information that indicates that Fiends are much stronger for some reason? "
1814,Why was the ending to the Arrancar arc so brief?,"I started watching Bleach probably a month ago and quickly found it to be quite interesting. But there are some things I just don't get.   For example Aizen... I thought Aizen was awesome. He commands such awe, attention and fear and you can tell that from the Shinigami's protecting Karakura town.   But I don't get is reason for being.  As far as I remember, every villain that Ichigo came across and defeated - at least the fairly important ones had a background story.   To digress Grimmjow, Barragan, No 1 and 3, 5 (+ Neliora) Espada's etc.. had a ""beginning"".  Disappointingly, Ulquiorra (my favorite Espada - btw) had none.  Kaname had a reason for being. Even Gin - also another disappointment imo - had a beginning, despite its vagueness.   But back to Aizen - from the very beginning he was just someone that had twice the amount of reiatsu when compared to a Captain level.   From what I got he simply wanted more power. To destroy the soul king and in turn destroy  Soul Society.   But what happens after that? He obviously finds Hollows insignificant, he hates the Shinigami but we don't know why.    I'm not sure if many people feel the same way but there just wasn't enough back story as to why Aizen is.   In the end all we got was some speculation from Ichigo - that doesn't really make sense btw - about how Aizen felt lonely because no one matched his power.  So to find an equal Aizen groomed Ichigo's powers, but the funny thing is Aizen, according to Ichigo's speculation in the meantime sought more power by subjugating the Hogyouku to his will.  If he had so much power, and he felt lonely simply because he outclassed all others, why not find a way to suppress if not completely get rid of his powers akin to Zaraki's eyepatch?  Ichigo speculates that maybe Aizen let go of his sword willingly, but in Room 46 he doesn't look like someone that gave up his sword ""willingly"".  The ""explanation"" that we get from Ichigo sounds rather similar to what the author gave us about Jin Kariya. But there was a reason for Jin's motive and considering his back story the explanation for his defeat does make sense.  But Aizen... I just don't get it.  If anyone can make sense of my question, can you give me a satisfactory answer? :P "
1815,"Did Kirei know about Kiritsugu's Origin Bullet, or was he just lucky?","In Kirei and Kiritsugu's final fight, Kirei uses Command Spells as his Mana source.   That rendered Kiritsugu's Origin Bullet ineffective. Was that on purpose? That is, did Kirei know about Kiritsugu's ability and use Command Spells as a Mana source to counter it?  To note:   Kiritsugu's Origin Bullet must have been a pretty well-guarded secret, or Archibald El-Melloi should not have been caught off guard by it; Using Command Spells as a Mana source is pretty unconventional; In the anime (have not read the Light Novel), there is no indication that Kirei knew about Kiritsugu's ability before the fight;  "
1816,Did Daichi and Hana survive?,"Yes, here we are fans of confusing anime endings, for one more episode of ""Did them survive?"" [1] [2].  So, did the love doves Daichi and Hana survive the explosion of the (huge) ego block of Robin Goodfellow (formerly Puck)?  My question comes in 2 parts. For the 2 possible situations. What happened to the 2 of them after the explosion occurred.  If they died, then how did it happen?  If they did survive, how was that possible?  Try to get sources and references to the anime, if not make your speculative point plausible and very airtight, thanks. "
1817,Does Captain Earth borrow elements from Gurren Lagann?,"As a viewer of both series from start to end, I can see several elements in Captain Earth that seems to ""borrow"" from Gurren Lagann, especially in the second half of both of the series:   In episode 23, just before the entangle link, Daichi was interfered by Planetary Gears and put inside a dream where he was tempted to keep on living his normal life, not involving with the whole saving-the-world business. However, he broke out of the illusion due to the memories of his friends in his heart. This is similar to how the almost entire crew of Dai Gurren-dan got trapped in Extradimensional Labyrinth in episode 26 of Gurren Lagann and experienced their dreams being fulfilled, but managed to escape from it with the help of Kamina. Daichi and co. did an entangle link to jump from Earth to Uranus, similar to how Dai Gurren-dan jumped through dimension from Earth to Anti-Spiral's home world. They both missed on their first try and got ambushed. In the final battle, Daichi charged into the transformed Blume while sacrificing the expansion layer (which is assembled as the smaller mecha is launched to Tenkaidou). This is similar to the final battle between Simon and the Anti-Spiral, where outer layers of the Gurren Lagann is left behind as Simon charged in with his Lagann and destroy the Anti-Spiral. Kill-T-Gangs, the perceived antagonists of the series, don't have any libido (Orgone energy), therefore they can't reproduce, while all human has Orgone energy. This is similar to the Anti-Spirals in Gurren Lagann, who don't have any Spiral energy (since they purge it themselves), while human has Spiral energy. Both series feature clashes between one with the source of all-powerful energy and one without such energy.   Are these similarities normal for mecha anime, especially when the first 3 points are all focused on the last fight? Has there been any interview regarding this topic? "

1819,"If demi-humans age by leveling up, then can they die of old age?","If demi-humans grow older by acquiring more levels or becoming stronger, then could higher level demi-humans die from old age? Or is there an internal aging system that does not affect physical appearances? "
1820,Is there any other episodes of Naruto after Episode 220 before Naruto Shippuden Episode 1?,"I watched all Naruto episodes on Netflix. I want to know if episode 220 leads right into Naruto Shippuden. I only watched a few minutes of episode 1 in Shippuden, but just watching it, I feel like I'm missing more episodes that lead into Shippuden.  Is there anymore Naruto episodes after Episode 220? Like, do they show Pervy Sage actually training Naruto or does his path of training leads into Shippuden? "
1821,What are the 2003 Wendy's Promotional Pokémon Toys?,"On Bulbapedia, there is an article about 2003 Wendy's promotional Pokémon toys. It currently says:     The 2003 Wendy's promotional Pokémon toys were a set of five toys distributed with Kids Meals at Wendy's in May of 2003. Each toy also came with one of fifteen cards.   It also links to a missing video by a user (TheMasterGamerify) who is no longer on YouTube.  How long did this campaign run? What were these toys, and what were the fifteen cards available? "
1822,"Why do Gargantians call Chamber ""Yunboroid"" or ""Yunboro""?","In Suisei no Gargantia's second episode, Gargantians, out of the blue, start referring to Chamber as either ""Yunboroid"" or ""Yunboro"".  Where did they get this name from? Was it some type of 'model' name or something that Led told them? Or is it something they came up with?  Either way, what exactly does it mean? "
1823,Where did Gary get these badges from?,"In Episode 63 of the Pokémon anime, it can be seen that Gary has ten badges, seven of them unknown.    The known badges are Boulder Badge (top left), the Cascade Badge (bottom left), and the Rainbow Badge (next to the boulder badge).  Where are the other seven from? And why are there ten of them? Every conference needs eight badges, all of them from the same region. "
1824,What kind of demon is Akura-ou?,"In Kamisama Hajimemashita, Akura'ou is a powerful demon with an immortal body that has been living for at least 600 years. The manga doesn't say much about the circumstances of his birth,  except that the gods wept when he was born.   Appearance: he is very tall, has long red hair. Looks human except the large horns on top of his head and pointed ears.     Character: He is pretty much the force of chaos, loves war and slaughter.  The origins of other demons in the manga are more-or-less clear: Tomoe is a kitsune, Kurama is a tengu, Mizuki is a white snake, and so on. But it's unclear just what kind of demon Akura-ou is.  What inspired the mangaka? Alternatively, what characters from other manga/anime resemble him? "
1825,How many siblings does Tonnura have?,"From chapter 7 we know that Tonnura and Duke are brothers:    The next chapter, though, implies that Duke may not be Tonnura's only sibling.    Has it been revealed how many other siblings Tonnura has? And do we know anything about them (in particular, are they all large talking cats like Tonnura)? "
1826,How strong was the Genki Dama Goku made to defeat Jiren?,"Goku tried to defeat Jiren with a Super Saiyan Blue Kaioken x20 and he failed. Then he decided to use his best technique, the Genki Dama to defeat him. One would think the Genki Dama had to be stronger than the Super Saiyan Blue kaioken x20, but in other hand, where did he get the energy from? They were surrounded by void, and the only powerfull warriors we see giving power to Goku are Freezer,17,Gohan and in a lesser level Piccolo and 18 (Krilin, Tien and Roshi contribution would be minimal).  How strong was the Genki Dama Goku made to defeat Jiren?  "
1827,"Piecing together the premise of Aldnoah.Zero, link between Mars/Moon/Earth","I'm a little confused about some details of the premise of Aldnoah.Zero, particularly why the Orbital Knights waited 15 years without attacking, why they needed an excuse, and who is on Mars vs. the Moon. I'm about halfway through season 2, I was patient waiting for clues to be revealed but the series changed focus to Inaho vs. Slaine and the save-the-princess quest.  First of all, my understanding is: In 1999 Mars attacked Earth by sending the Orbital Knights and a bunch of other soldiers through the Hypergate on the moon. Yadda yadda, the Hypergate exploded, taking most of the moon with it. Now the folks who were sent from Mars are stuck here with no way back, presumably because Mars is out of range for normal travel. They can still, however, communicate with home, so they at least maintain contact.  That means:   The war stopped because the resulting devastation from the moon's explosion caused a huge number of losses on both sides (Saazbaum, for example, lost his significant other). The Orbital Knights and the remaining original Mars army are stuck here, so they dug in on the remains of the moon and built bases there and throughout the debris belt. The emperor is on Mars (we know this for certain because Slaine comments about being on VERS during his unauthorized use of the audience chamber to warn the emperor).   So my first question is, is my understanding above correct? My remaining confusion is based on that understanding.  The things that I don't understand, then, are:   Why were the Orbital Knights waiting for an excuse to attack Earth? Why assassinate Asseylum in the first place? The knights have both motivation and superior fire power, what stopped them from just... invading with no excuse?    The only possible theory I have is the emperor didn't endorse it. But why would these guys care? They're trapped without the Hypergate. They have no hope of returning home nor do they seem to ever attempt to find a way home or even care. The emperor can't touch them from Mars (and the threat of taking their Aldnoah drives isn't valid, we've already seen that once they are activated they don't need any more interaction from people with the Aldnoah factor unless they need to be re-activated, and we know there's at least 2 princesses and 1 terran that can do this, and the princesses can pass on the factor through kisses and blood or something, even unwillingly). It just seems reasonable to me that people in this situation, especially people desiring the Earth's resources so badly and trapped on the Earth/Moon, would go for it out of desperation if nothing else. It doesn't seem feasible for an entire army + 37 orbital knights to sit by and twiddle their thumbs in this situation waiting for some excuse (which they orchestrated themselves with the assassination plot conspiracy).  If you have the moral deficit necessary to conspire to assassinate your own princess as an excuse to attack, it doesn't seem so far-fetched to just skip the conspiracy effort and go for the attack.  How did the princess even get to Earth? The OK are isolated due to lack of Hypergate. So she couldn't have been sent to Earth after the fact. She must have at least been there since 1999. She's obviously pretty young, she couldn't have been more than a newborn or toddler in '99. This means the emperor sent his newborn grand-daughter to Earth during the first war? That doesn't make any sense. What was she doing there and how did she get there? Why were the Orbital Knights hanging out on the moon in the first place?   It seems as if it would have been a much more reasonable strategy for the knights and the Mars army to just go down to Earth and live there, or at least build a base on the surface (shouldn't be a problem with their vastly superior strength). We know their primary drive is lust for the Earth's resources (secondary drive is that they're just grossed out by terrans). The more power-hungry ones could just as easily dominate after going down to Earth. ""Because Martians would never be accepted"" isn't a great excuse for this. Inaho or Rayet or somebody early on even remarked on the fact that nobody can tell them apart unless they reveal themselves, since they're all human. There's no test for it. There's no way to tell. There were even Martian spies on Earth, a key point in the assassination plot. The Mars army and the knights could have blended in seamlessly.  Where are the Mars army soldiers coming from? I assume that the only soldiers available are the ones originally sent 15 years ago, as Mars can't send more soldiers in without a Hypergate. So either they're making babies (but all would be 15 years or younger at this point) or the Mars soldiers are a finite resource and nobody seems to be concerned about this. They must have just sent a lot of soldiers the first time through? None of the Orbital Knights seem to be concerned at all about the survival of their bloodlines, so either the situation is already resolved (their families are with them and they're having kids) or they just... forgot?   For that matter, how are they getting ammunition, supplies, and the materials needed to construct a moon base? Well, that's not a real question, I'm willing to let that one slide...    Anyways, it's very likely that I missed something in one of the episodes, and that's actually primarily what I'm looking for here. I am enjoying this series but in order to do so I have to set aside my questions about the fundamental premise, because otherwise nothing that's happening here seems to have any justification.  So the main thing I'm looking for is clarity on how the knights go to where they are and why they behaved the way they did in that 15 year gap, as well as what the princess is doing there. That is, some clarity on what remains of the link between Mars and the trapped Orbital Knights and army. "
1828,Did Goku get a Zenkai boost when Freezer gave energy to him?,"We know Goku and Vegeta get energy when they are healed by senzu beans, regeneration chambers, Dende and they get Zenkai boosts. But what about when he gets energy from another warrior, like he got from Freezer? I remember Kibito healed warriors with his technique, wasn't his technique about giving energy?  "
1829,What moments of Blue Gender considered causing huge controversy?,"This TV Tropes site about Blue Gender says:     Actually, the series itself seems to be a source of great trolling on most anime sites.   What's the reason of it? Is there any worthy example to prove, show or explain?  There's another mention in said link that it is because of the ending, which, I can perfectly understand, but is also implies that it's not the only point of controversy. "

1833,Why don't anime shows finish the manga?,"On almost every anime I've watched, they stop producing the anime even though there is more story in the manga, and then to get the rest of the story you have to read the manga.  For example, I've watched Maid-Sama, Fruits Basket, Ouran High School Host Club, Magi and none of them finish off what they started. The only show I've seen that has tried to animate the whole manga so far is Fairy Tail.  Why don't producers just animate the entire manga, or why do they start animating the manga and never finish? Why don't they finish the anime based on the manga? "
1834,Who is Macaroon?,"In a side quest of the first Hyperdimension Neptunia game, you fight a boss called Macaroon. Here's an image of her (unsure if this is from the original or Re;Birth)    In Trinity Universe, she appears as an Inn Keeper (before Pamula takes over) and as a shop keeper (before Violet takes over).    I've played though the Disgaea Games (with the exception to Disgaea D2: a Brighter Darkness, but it was released after Trinity Universe and Hyperdimension Neptunia) and I haven't seen her, so I assumed that she is a Gust character probably from the Atelier series, since both games feature Gust characters (Hyperdimension Neptunia has a character who represents Gust called Gust like how NISA has Nisa).  I thought she'd appear in the Atelier Iris series, but I'm currently on the third one and I have yet to meet her, but I know some of the Atelier Games were never localized and I'm assuming she's from the Atelier series (Gust also did Ar Tonelico and Ar no Surge).  So I am wondering, where does she appear? Or was she an original character only used in cross-over works? "
1835,"Why did Airi say ""Whose eyes are those eyes"" at the end of the first episode?","At the very end of the first episode, Airi is shown saying ""Whose eyes are those eyes?"" - a key phrase from Chaos;Head, another visual novel and anime from the same creators.  From what I've read, Robotics;Notes does have some ties to Chaos;Head that were seemingly cut from the anime completely (possibly copyright issues?). But it doesn't make sense to me that she would say this line when Chaos;Head is not referenced at all at any other point in the anime series, if I remember correctly.  Did I miss the meaning of the line within the anime series? Or does anyone have an explanation from the Robotics;Notes visual novel? "

Note: I know that the Narutopedia page for the Senju Clan gives a short explanation, but I would like further elaboration. "
1839,Is there a nen user that could've defeated Meruem (the king)?,"During the Chimera Ant arc of HxH, we witness the awesome battle between Meruem or the chimera ant king, and       Isaac Netero.   At the end,      Netero is defeated by the king's might (some may argue that Netero still won with the hidden bomb, but in essence and for this post, I am going to conclude that Meruem defeated Netero).     If       Netero   could not defeat Meruem, is there a nen user in the HxH universe that could? Perhaps someone from the main cast, such as Gon, Killua, Kurapika, etc., a lesser character, such as Ging, Kite, Illumi, etc., or maybe a character that was only briefly mentioned and not fully developed?

Source: Ozgameshop  Now, this sounds much like the Ar Tonelico series, which talks about how music is used as magic and how you need to develop the character's relationships with one another to develop their strength. Also, both games were developed by Gust.  This makes me wondering: Are the 2 games are related story-wise? If they are, when does Ar no Surge: Ode to an Unborn Star occur in relation to Ar Tonelico?

What is the significance of this form? Did he purposely choose this appearance? Why/Why not?  Why does Takashi call Madara by the name ""Nyanko-sensei?""   "
1846,Why doesn't Pain use other paths when his bodies are killed?,"During the Naruto vs Pain fight (before Edo Tensei), he has 6 bodies that he controls via Chakra and each body has the power of one path.   When Naruto kills anyone of them, it's stated that he loses usage to that particular power of path until he has another body for that.   My doubt is that since its just bodies controlled by chakra, why doesn't he use the remaining pain to use all the paths?  For example, if the summoning path dies, Why can't he use that path through the Yahiko pain or some other pain? "
1847,"Ranma 1/2 Season 7, Ep. 151, The Kuno Sibling Scandal - Score","Adorable, goofy song.  Could someone tell me what the song is at around 7:04, where Kuno Tatewaki jumps Ranma to reclaim his album of girl-Ranma pics, on the bridge with Kodachi? It's hilarious.  Link: [website]Thanks in advance. "
1848,How much does the Chuunibyou anime differ from the light novels?,"There seems to be a lot of exclusive content in the anime of Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai!, such as Sanae Dekomori, Kumin Tsuyuri, and Touka Takanashi (Rikka's older sister) all being exclusive to the anime.  What major differences (how differently do the events in the anime play out in the light novels) are then in the light novel compared to the anime? Why did the production make such changes?   "
1849,Is it explained how Emile hides their anatomy?,"Emile Crossford begins the series as Hayato's roomate.     But actually      ""He"" is a girl disguised as boy.   But when he wears ""other"" clothes, it is shown that this disguise would be hard to mantain.  Does the franchise make any effort to explain how it is achieved? Or is it just handwaved? "
1850,What is the name of Misaka 10032's cat?,"In episode 10 (Misaka Mikoto) Misaka 10032 finds a black cat. Touma tells her to choose a name for the cat, since she was the one who found it. She says that the cat will be called dog, which Touma dismisses, proposing that she chooses a ""more majestic"" name. So she says Tokugawa Ieyasu, which Touma dismisses as ""too majestic"". She than chooses Schrödinger, which, once again, Touma dismisses as being ""a taboo for cats"".    It was not clear to me which became the definitive name for the cat, although I have only seen up to episode 14. Is it ever said, either in the anime or in the novels, which name ended up being chosen? Or did she end up not naming it? "
1851,Who is the boy in the coffin in the last episode (of the Gemini of the Meteor)?,"Who is the boy in the coffin that wakes up in the last episode of the second season, Gemini of the Meteor? What significance does he play? Why does he look like Yin?   "
1852,Were Luna and Artemis the only (sentient) cats in Sailor Moon?,"In Sailor Moon, there are two cats, Luna and Artemis, who I believe act as advisers for Sailor Moon's mother, the queen.    It's been a while since I've seen the anime, but were there any other sentient cats in Sailor Moon? Or were these two the only ones? "
1853,What is the fate of Densuke at the end of the last episode?,"In episode 23, Densuke is ""lost"" (mobbed my illegals) when he was protecting Yuuko (Okonogi) from illegals.  However, in the last episode, Yuuko and Kyouko both are able to see Densuke without their Dennou Eyeglasses. How is this possible (since Densuke only exists in the virtual space)? Does this mean he was reborn or is the meaning purely figurative?   "
1854,Mjolmire and what does it profit a man?,"At time-code 20:45 of episode 21 of That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime, the merchant Mjolmire is considering Rimuru's offer to go to his capital city and help teach the folks there about trade. He says something I find strange:    ""So we would both profit... I mean benefit!""  Why would he feel the need to reject the word ""profit""? It seems perfectly natural to me. Rimuru's nation might be an ideal communist society (debatable point) but even communists would understand that a traveling merchant seeks profit. Or is the issue something else entirely? "
1855,What is the intended purpose of Haro?,What is the original intended function of Haro (both in-universe and in real life)? What did it end up becoming?   
1856,Why is Train Heartnet called Black Cat?,"The main character of Black Cat, Train Heartnet, is called Black Cat. Where did that name come from? Is it a reference to him being an assassin and, as such, being ""bad luck"" for people whose paths he crosses? "
1857,Who has the most informations about the poneglyph?,"I was wondering who has the most informations about the poneglyph ? like their origin, how they was introducing into the One Piece world, their purpose and their meaning ?  So basically who gathered the most knowledge about it and still alive ?   "
1858,Is Kamineko a jerk?,"In the last episode of the anime, Sakaki apologizes to it for trying to pet it all the time without taking its feelings into account. After that dialogue, it walks up to Sakaki and seemingly allows her to move her hand toward its head as though to pet it, but suddenly then bites her without any warning.  It also gathered a small horde of cats in order to attack Sakaki and Chiyo, but that ploy was foiled by Maya, Sakaki's pet Iriomote Mountain Cat.  Is Kamineko really a jerk and a bully, or is there some deeper reason behind its biting?   "
1859,What happens if a contestant's phone turns off?,"I was rewatching Mirai Nikki and saw Episode 15, and it got me thinking. Is it a requirement for your phone to be always on?  We already know that 'Future Diaries' are, in other words, your future. So if the phone breaks you have no future which means in short that you die.  So my question is: what happens for example if you decide to put your phone into shutdown mode? Do you still die?  Also how exactly are their phones powered? PS: Magic does not count.  I will accept Manga answers as I do not think it was explained in the anime. Also I have not read the manga so I am not sure. I will also accept answers with a bit of opinion as long as it is a good answer with some sort of canon. :) "
1860,Differences between the Battle Angel: Alita manga and anime and the Alita: Battle Angel Live action,"I've watched the Alita Battle Angel Live Action, and though I couldnt watch most of the anime yet it doesnt seem to be exactly the same story. For example, I believe in the manga she was named Alita after the doctor deceased cat and in the Live Action she's named so after his deceased daughter. Are there many differences like this? Which are the differences between the Battle Angel: Alita manga and anime and the Alita: Battle Angel Live action? "
1861,What kind of creature is Chiyo-chichi?,"Chiyo-chichi (Chiyo-Dad, or ""Father Cat"" in the dub) is a strange creature that appears in  Osaka and Sakaki's dreams. He says he's not a real cat before he tells Sakaki to ""find a real cat.""  What kind of creature is he? Where did the author get the idea of creating him?  He's the strange creature in the middle -- he doesn't like tomatoes because they are red :   "
1862,What dance is the battle between Lucciola and Cicada based on?,"In Last Exile, episode 23 (""Castling Lucciola""), the battle between Lucciola and Cicada resembles a dance routine. The actual fight begins at about 19:35 into the episode.  What type of dance is this supposed to resemble? I did a little research on it myself, and it seems to most resemble ballet. But if that's the case, then what kind of ballet? "
1863,Is Roronoa Zoro based on Rurouni Kenshin?,"There are several similarities between the two characters and also the characters they interact with.   They are both extremely skilled swordsmen. Their names/titles are slightly similar and hint at being swordsmen. I'm not entirely sure about Roronoa but Kenshin's name was derived from some samurai novel. Also, vaguely note how execution is a main topic in and is constantly mentioned in One Piece and the character Kenshin was based on a samurai who was executed. Kenshin was released in 1996 and One Piece came later in 1999.   From ANN's plot summary of Rurouni Kenshin     Himura Kenshin is a vagabond with a dark past and sunny disposition.   Not a ronin but a rurouni, he was never a samurai, but an assassin   of utmost skill in the Meiji restoration, who in the turning point   of the war simply walked away. His travels lead him to Tokyo in the   11th year of the Meiji era, where he befriends a female Kendo master,   a former thief, a brawler and a doctor all with their own   secrets. Together they fight off the enemies surfacing from the dark   past that Kenshin cannot escape. (Seems familiar with a certain   character's merry band of men?)   From One Piece plot summary:     ... Along his ways, with luck and determination, he finds himself many   members who are devoted but to different causes. (Sounds familiar with a certain wanderer?)   So I would like to ask, is there any source that confirms whether the character Roronoa Zoro from One Piece is related in any way to Kenshin, or whether One Piece is somewhat influenced by Kenshin? "
1864,Can hunters change their specialization through training?,"How did characters in Hunter x Hunter got their specialization or affinity? It is said that the specialization or affinity is based on the potential the characters got during their birth. Can they change the specialization or affinity they have just by thinking or training? But if they can, how can they train something they don't have? Like if they can't shoot the aura out, how will they get the specialization of shooting the aura by training?  Also, how come Franklin can shoot aura from his hands when he was born with human hands? How did Chrollo acquire spell stealing when there is no one to train with at the city of wasteland? "
1865,About the physics of transmutation in FMA:B,"Anyone who has watched even an episode of FMA or FMA:B knows how transmutations work. They are the staple of alchemy, and are very important to the show. The only rule with transmutations is the Law of Equivalent Exchange. This all seems fine and dandy when it is first explained to you; you must put in what you want to get out.  However, I soon started to considering the ramifications of this theory. Yes, it agrees with the Conservation of Mass, which states that matter cannot be created nor destroyed in a reaction. Sticking with chemistry and physics, it is also well-known that energy is required to make and break chemical bonds. While Edward provides ample matter for his transmutations (which are essentially 'reactions' in the parallel universe of FMA/FMA:B), where does he get the energy? If the Law of Equivalent Exchange was truly correct, wouldn't Ed and Al have to provide the equivalent amount of energy to bond all of the required substances together? Is this 'shortcoming' ever discussed in either series (2003 or 2009), or in the manga? "
1866,What was the first anime series to use digital production?,"What was the first anime series to use digital production? How many years passed between the first use and the complete conversion to digital?   According to this interview to Toshihiko Arisako by ANN [04:42] Toei first used digital animation in 1998 for the fourth GeGeGe no Kikaro series, and ""2000 was the year that most of our productions were produced digitally"". Is this time frame valid for other studios or Toei was a precursor? "
1867,Law's goal with the One-Piece?,Does Law have a particular goal with going after the one-piece? I'm not sure if he or the other major players in the running for the one-piece have had their motivations put front-and-center yet.   But so far everyone that is member of the straw-hats has had their goal explained. But aside from wanting to crush Doflamingo does Law have an actual goal?  
1868,Is Kayaba Akihiko the boss of the 100th floor of New Aincrad?,"In the anime Sword Art Online, the floors from 76-100 have been untouched since Kirito beat Kayaba, but before Kirito does so, Kayaba Akihiko said, ""I was meant to be the final boss at the 100th floor.""  Now that there is a New Aincrad built in Alfheim Online.  Is it possible that Kayaba Akihiko is waiting on the 100th floor for a rematch? Or could the end boss just be another random boss for them to fight? "
1869,What is the original text of Black Hanekawa's tongue twister?,"Bakemonogatari episode 14 has a fairly famous tongue-twister in it, which Black Hanekawa recites with her cat voice. It was translated as: ""Can you imagine an imaginary menagerie manager imagining managing an imaginary menagerie?"". The scene is here (potentially NSFW):  [website]Translating tongue-twisters is notoriously hard, so I suspect this is done fairly liberally.  What is the original Japanese text which is being spoken? Also, what does it literally mean (not worrying about making it a tongue-twister)? "
1870,"Why was the ""Anime no Chikara"" project interrupted?","Back in the 2010, TV Tokyo's anime department and Aniplex began a project called Anime no Chikara. After producing three anime with original stories, Sora no Woto, Senkou no Night Raid and Occult Academy, the project was put on break and never resumed.  The president of Aniplex Koichiro Natsume said in 2012, ""unfortunately I cannot say that this was a success"", but he didn't say exactly what was wrong with the project.  Are there any sources or data explaining why Anime no Chikara was aborted? Is this suspension related to Senkou no Night Raid controversies regarding the interpretation of Manchurian incident, causing the episode 7 to be released online only or there are more practical reasons behind this decision? "
1871,Why Oreimo changed the actual brand name in Akihabara,"In the anime, primarily ep2 when Kirino first come to Akihabara, I noticed many of the brand name or billboard was altered, リバティー/Liberty was changed into ワバチィー/wabaty, タカラダ/Takarada to タカダ/Takada, ガシャポン to ガチャポン, Laox to Taox, Labi to Labla, Gee! to Guu!, McDonald's to McDoneld's etc.    I wonder why they made such changes. They could have kept all the brand and billboard the same as they are in real life, but instead, they made so many subtle changes (while the maid cafe remains almost entirely intact).  Since many of these easter eggs are placed in a very obvious position, and animating such a complicated background asks a large amount of effort. I don't really believe these are purely the animator having fun. Are there any other reasons? Like copyright or advertising?     P.S. I am asking this for my essay, so please do think of it  P.P.S. image retrieved from this website.   P.P.P.S. feel free to leave any other thoughts about this  "
1872,"Does Madara's age make him immune from the Death Note's ""124 years old"" rule?","Disregarding for a second that      Madara is now dead, after ceasing to be a Jinchuuriki   The Death Note has a rule which states that     You cannot kill humans at the age of 124 or over with the Death Note.   The timeline isn't well explained, and I tried to reach a conclusion with a friend, but couldn't eventually.  The question is: Is Madara over 124 years old? And thus immune to the effects of a Death Note? "
1873,Why is it that many anime and manga depict being a virgin male as something embarrassing?,"From the long list of manga I read and anime I watched, especially in romance genre, including romance comedy, harem, etc, being a virgin has been depicted as something bad, especially a male virgin. Many of them have the virgin guy pretending that he is not. When his close friend, who happens to know that he is a virgin, blurted about the fact, he was seen embarrassed as if being a virgin is something bad despite them being High School Students. Another even said that if you are a virgin until 30 then you will become a wizard (IIRC it was Haganai).  Why is it that anime and manga depict being a virgin as something embarrassing? Does this reflects the Japanese society, mainly the teens? "
1874,What game is Subaru playing with the girls?,"In episode 5 of Ro-Kyu-Bu!, Subaru is trying to build teamwork by playing cards with the team members.  The first shot shown is of cards sequentially placed on the floor. There are some hearts missing.    Then, each player goes around in the circle (they all have one card left except one). In this case, they each passed on their turn, until a fight broke out, and one player was holding two cards: the 5 and 8 of hearts, and was accused of ""holding up"" the game.    What is this game they're playing (and is it American, Japanese, or otherwise)? And, how was the player with the 5 and 8 of hearts holding it up? "
1875,"Order to watch the Danganronpa series? Is there a ""Danganronpa 2""?","This season there are 2 simultaneous Danganronpa shows, both of which are prefaced with ""Danganronpa 3"".  The first series in the franchise is ""Danganronpa: Kibou no Gakuen to Zetsubou no Koukousei"".  I'm not clear on if there is a second series anywhere, or if the number 3 was just added to the names of both the new series.    Wikipedia says       A second anime series, titled Danganronpa 3: The End of Hope's Peak High School, began airing in July 2016. The series is split into two simultaneously airing parts; Side: Future, which serves as a conclusion to the ""Hope's Peak Academy"" storyline, and Side: Despair, which serves as a prequel to Danganronpa 2   which is clear as mud.  I am unable to find information on ""Danganronpa 2"", though I would expect one to be a prequel to the first series, and the other to maybe be a side story or a post story.   What order should I watch Danganronpa in? For the current series, does it matter which episode I watch first from each of the simultaneous ones (the ""Future Arc"" started airing before the ""Despair Arc"")? Does the Wiki page confuse ""Danganronpa 2"" with the manga/LN material?  "
1876,Have any successful manga artists picked up their skill without schooling?,"Asking as a person who knows very little about drawing but has some experience and is interested in drawing manga. Is natural artistic talent necessary if someone wants to become a good anime and manga artist or has anyone done it based on raw effort and or determination?  Along that same note, have there been any current or past manga artists that have derived success based on only what they taught themselves without any formal training?  In a nutshell, I'm basically asking how important nature versus nurture is to art in general as it pertains to manga and looking for examples of such. "
1877,Regarding the life of Fisher Tiger in One Piece,"I'm catching up on One Piece. I'm currently viewing the Fishman Island saga and more specifically, the story of Fisher Tiger.   Obviously, SPOILERS ahead regarding Fisher Tiger:       During that story we learn that Fisher Tiger managed to climb the Red  Line with his bare hands (10,000 meters from the ocean surface) and  attack the Holy Land of Mariejois alone. A feat which shows that  Fisher Tiger was a man of legendary strengh.    This is why his death was so perplexing to me. After reaturning Koala  to her parents he was attacked by Rear Admiral Strawberry and a score  (?) of marines. He was shot to death.     How this can be? How can such a powerful warrior die of a score of  mare marines and a Rear Admiral when he managed to attack and survive  Mariejois?   Am I missing something?  "
1878,What happened to the Super Peace Busters after Menma's passing?,"Is it known what happened to the Super Peace Busters after Menma passed away? Did they immediately disband, and immediately stop being friends? "
1879,Why does Puck refer to Emilia as 'My Daughter'?,"In episode 15, Puck referred to Emilia as his Daughter.  Why is this? A few thoughts I have come up with to explain the reasoning come down to:   They have a relationship like Father/Daughter. (In my opinion they do not have this, they seem more like best friends than this.) Puck IS her father. (Again, this seems convoluted to me, as it is stated that Puck is a Spirit. the 'Daughter' terminology is code for something else, Emilia likely having something like this for Puck too.   It is also said by Puck in episode 18 something along the lines of ""In accordance with my contract, I shall now destroy the world"".  When asked why, the answer given was ""Emilia is my entire reason for existing. There is no reason for me to exist in a world without her.""  This shows some kind of deeper bond between them, deeper than I can think.  What exactly is their relationship? "
1880,Why is shonen manga's goriness these days abundant?,"So I just read The Promised Neverland and the goriness is kinda jarring for me (and it's in Weekly Shonen Jump). It's a not alone there, actually. HxH has its own share of goriness. Shingeki no Kyojin is also formally a shonen title even though I personally treat it as a seinen. And there are other similar titles too many to mention here.  So what's the matter with the Japanese audience? Do they tolerate such level of violence (even though it's only fictional) especially for the kids? Isn't it kinda messed up to prematurely expose them to such vulgar things? "
1881,What is the chibi-esque gathering at the end of each episode?,"At the end of each episode of Ro-Kyu-Bu!, and sometimes during the episode content, the girls are seen talking to each other or to the audience in chibi form. Usually there is 8-bit music in the background, and the characters appear to be sprites (without animations).     Is this a game they're playing? Or, is it something more meta (like a representation of them talking by phone)? If it's a game, does it have a name? "
1882,Did that person actually fail to save Menma?,"Spoilers below.  Did      Poppo really fail to save Menma as she was drowning?   In real life, I doubt he would have just run away for help. It is known that her body washed away so if he saw her where she fell initially, it must have been just as she started drowning.  Is it known that he saw her, in the middle of drowning, and just left? Or did he see a body, or maybe just the flip-flop?  I need to know... "
1883,Why did WWIII happen because of the explosion?,"Alright, so in AKIRA the big psychic explosion causes WW3. My question is: why did WW3 ensue afterwards? Did the Japanese government cover it up as a nuclear explosion? It seems counterintuitive to start WW3, even if it is to cover up your psychic program. "
1884,Is Jiren a Fusion Character?,As we know Jiren is a Over powered character. Even Beerus was mind blown when he released his Ki questioning whether this really the energy from just one warrior?! What if Jiren is a  Fusion Character and he meditates in order to control the insane power within? 
1885,Why didn't Korosensei use his absolute defence form against the orbital laser?,"I've been rewatching S1, and something popped up in my mind the last few episodes: Why didn't Korosensei use his absolute defence form to protect himself against the second attack of the orbital laser? Isn't he supposed to be indistructable in that form? "
1886,Is there a continuation of Darker than Black: Gemini of the Meteor?,"I finished watching the second season of Darker than Black: Gemini of the Meteor, and seeing how it ended it seems like there may be a continuation since there are some questions left unanswered at the end:      1) Amber seemed to have wanted Hei to know the prophecy so did she wanted Hei to seal Hell's Gate in Season 1 solely to prevent it  2) Yin says for Hei to ""Take her Life"", since Hei's Powers are actually Pi's because she fused with him (her power being able to manipulate matter at the atomic level apparently) and Hei was only seen with his hand outreach at the end so is Yin now fused with Hei like Pi  3) Those 2 Doll Twins had the same kind of Specter that Yin had where instead of a blob they had a human from and they said they was going to a 3rd gate that has just appeared so what is the 3rd gate and why has it appeared after the first 2  4) There's the unknown being that would be born which is probably that child that came out of the coffin but also there's a huge black monolith extending out of Hell's Gate so does it has a connection to the kid   I'm wondering if there is a continuation and what form it is in (anime or manga). Since most anime are adaptations of manga, does a manga continuation already exists? And if so, are there any plans to adapt it into an anime? "
1887,"In the Monogatari Series, who is Araragi truly love? Hanekawa, Shinobu or Senjougahara?","I am kinda confuse right now because after seeing Kizumonogatari, it seems like Hanekawa was Araragi first love.(Am I right?)   In the Bakemonogatari series, Araragi also turn out like Senjougahara.   But...   Shinobu and Araragi these 2 people also seems like like each other too right?  So which one is Araragi truly love or like? "
1888,"In ""Your Name"", why does anyone let the scammers get away without calling the police?",There is the scene in Your Name where Okudera intervenes as the scammers say there is a toothpick in their pizza.  Why do they let the scammers get away like that? Is that for convenience as calling the police on them would make a scene or something else I am missing? 
1889,"Given how Obito had acquired Bijuu in the past, why would he bother going to war?",I don't get this.  Did Obito think that it would be easier to go to war with the whole shinobi world rather than capture the 8-tails and 9-tails Jinchuuriki on the low like how he did with the other ones?  He basically ended up fighting not only both of them but also the entire shinobi world.   Would Obito's plans succeeded if he did not declare war and kept everything under the radar till the end?  I believe he'd have been successful and that he wouldn't have needed to summon Madara at all. 
1890,"Why were Sayaka and Kyoko fighting in the beginning, and what caused them to eventually end up as friends?","Why were Sayaka and Kyoko fighting in the beginning, and what caused them to eventually end up as friends?  (Related: Why exactly does Kyoko attempt to save Sayaka?) "
1891,"When Kyoko overloaded her soul gem to kill Sayaka's witch form, did Kyoko then also become a witch?","When Kyoko overloaded her soul gem to kill Sayaka's witch form, does Kyoko then also become a witch? Or since she overloaded her soul gem, does she just die ""normally?"" If the latter is true, then why don't all magical girls just overload their gems before they become completely tainted, that way they don't become witches? "
1892,Is it true that hiden jutsu can be taught?,"I was browsing through naruto wiki, and came across this page  It is stated that ,     They are not to be confused with kekkei genkai, as technically, hiden techniques can be taught to anyone.   By ""they"", it means Hiden Jutsu. Is it true that they can be taught to others? Is there any evidence of this happening?  I remember in the Boruto movie that the Shadow Jutsu is used through that advanced gadget. But is it possible for a person who does not have any clan relationship to learn a Hiden Jutsu? "
1893,Can we say the human race won The Great War in No Game No Life: Zero or Tet won?,"In the movie, the human race really tried so hard so that they can win the war but in the final moment, Riku finally summon the Star Cup but unfortunately his both arm were blast off... and then Tet finally show up and give a hand to Riku.   After that, Tet use his power to repair the whole world and made the world calm down for awhile. So basically it was Tet power that made the world peace for awhile but isn't the human race actually contribute more than Tet right?   If Riku didn't plan this, Tet wouldn't come out and help the human race right? "
1894,What was the meaning of Leo's chant on episode 10?,"In episode 10, around 15:10 mark, just when Leo is about to collapse from hunger before they finally agree to settle for the burger place where he usually goes, he chants something that appears in the subtitles as:     Onbutsu sowaka mareba eloim essaza...   What's that supposed to mean? Is it a reference to something I'm not getting? "
1895,Who is Kouu the tyrant king?,"I'm reading the manga ""Reincarnation no Kaben"": there, the main characters get some powers from their previous lives, and hence are named after famous people of history.   I managed to find all of them except who the main antagonist should be: he is named after ""Kouu the tyrant king"". Does someone knows who the historical character they are referring to is? (Or is it a made up character?) "
1896,How did Toshinou Kyouko's personality change?,"In episode 11 of the first season of the anime, there was a flashback where it was shown that little Toshinou Kyouko was nothing like the current Toshinou Kyouko — she was quiet, shy and even had less presence than Akaza Akari. Yet, the current Toshinou Kyouko is nothing like that.  What happened between the time when she was shown as a quiet and shy little girl and the current her? Has the author ever being asked about this? "
1897,Did Goten and Trunks ever fused using the Potara earrings?,"We've seen Goten and Trunks fusing several times using the metamor fusion. But have they ever fused using the Potara earrings? How about in Dragon Ball Heroes? If so, what's the name of the warrior when fusing using Potaras? "
1898,What's the meaning of 'slice of life' animation?,"I recently joined this manga and anime forum and stumbled across this term numerous times. People reviewing different parameters of animes and calling that a ""typical"" slice of life anime.  Is this pretty common sort of anime?  What does this mean? "
1899,How are phones designed on “The Dirty Pair?”,"The two heroines in TV series The Dirty Pair work for the World Welfare Works Association (WWWA / 3WA) as “trouble consultants”, for example solving problems while blowing things up..  During the opening credits—and during the show—characters are seen using the phone to call WWWA with the number “3WA” being dialed on the keypad.    This style of keypad shows up throughout the show—and as far as I know—it’s not a standard style keypad outside of the world of “The Dirty Pair.”  Even if the W and A keys were there for the exclusive purpose of dialing “3WA” why are N and Y keys there?

1901,How can All Might still fight using One For All in the latest movie?,"In the rematch fight with All For One, All Might had used his last embers of One For All and told Midoriya that he couldn't fight anymore, but in the latest movie we saw that All Might was using One For All and I wanna know how?

1902,"Is Natsu Dragneel ""END"" in the Fairy Tail anime adaptation?","So I've heard/read that Natsu is END (Etherious Natsu Dragneel), but in the anime END doesn't get activated. In the manga we see that Zeref's reveals who he/it is, but not in the anime.  Is Zeref going to come back and awaken END (Because I'm sticking with the anime, not the manga)? Or is Natsu END even in the anime? (It could just be Hiiro not sticking with the manga?) "
1903,Two-armed Shanks after he saves Luffy,"As a One Piece fan who doesn't read the manga I must ask this:  In this flashback when Ace meets Shanks, Ace says:      ""My brother was always talking about you as his lifesaver""   As you are aware, Shanks lost his arm when he saved Luffy. However, at 0:43 you can clearly see both of his arms.  Does this happen in the manga or is it just an animation mistake? "
1904,Meaning of the term 'plotless',"I need an elaborate answer to this question. After one of the answers I got from another question where a particular film jargon (""plotless story"") was used, I read a wiki page and found that plot (narrative) means the chain of events which are linked to each other. In every show which is made for entertainment, there must be a link between events otherwise it would make no sense to watch it. Imagine a hypothetical ""plotless show"" where two characters completed unrelated to each other, die because of completely unrelated reasons, it'd rather be called a set of random events rather than a show.   When people say ""this anime has no plot"", what do they actually mean? Are they talking about two episodes not connected to each other? "
1905,How are Rikka's and Shichimiya's powers being affected?,"In the second season of ""Love, Chunibyou and and other Delusions"", Rikka's powers start weakening in the 9th episode. I don't get what's going on. Their powers are supposed to be imaginary. Then how is it possible for something imaginary to weaken unless the person imagines them to be weakening themselves. Rikka doesn't really have any reason to imagine that and apparently, from her reactions, she doesn't like it. Then what's causing it and why is it happening?  Furthermore, Shichimiya also tells Rikka about what once happened to her and that she decided to keep her powers and remain the magical devil girl. Does that mean that if she had fallen in love with Yuuta back then, her powers would have disappeared?  What do their powers have to do with Yuuta? "

1908,"Kurapika's initial disrespect for Leorio, ""Rewolio""","In the various English versions of Hunter x Hunter, Kurapika shows his initial disrespect for Leorio in various ways:  1) 2011 sub: calls him ""Leorio"" instead of ""Leorio-san""  2) 2011 dub: calls him ""Leorio"" instead of ""Mister Leorio""  3) 1999 sub: calls him ""Leorio"" instead of ""Mr. Leorio""  4) 1999 dub: calls him something like ""Rewolio"" instead of ""Leorio"" ( [website]This discussion takes place in episode 1 of 2011 and episode 3 of 1999.  I'm pretty sure the disrespect is due to the way Leorio had been being rude to the Captain and Gon. Anyway, I'm most curious about #4.  What exact name is Kurapika using? It is hard to tell with no text.  Does the actual word mean anything in either English or Japanese? "
1909,Mechanics of the Inuyasha love triangle?,"A large portion of the InuYasha manga and anime series deals with the emotional issues surrounding the primary love triangle of       Inuyasha, Kagome, and Kikyo, particularly from Kagome's point of view. However, it is revealed that Kagome is, in fact, a reincarnation of Kikyo, so they actually share the same soul, albeit from different time periods!   If that's the case, then this appears to remove all of the tension and underlying conflict, in effect Inuyasha is in love with      the same person (in two forms, one of which is even a vengeful spirit of the dead who wants to move on the afterlife)!   How exactly was this love triangle supposed to work, narratively? While I can't speak for the mangaka's inner thoughts, perhaps there are cultural nuances or tropes that I'm not aware of at work here? "
1910,Whose autograph is this on a Sailor Moon pencilboard?,"Whose autograph is this on this Sailor Moon merchandise (it looks like a shitajiki [pencilboard]) from the SuperS season? Is it a seiyuu, or a production company staff member such as an anime director, a SeraMyu musical actress, or is it supposed to be one of the characters' own signatures from an kigurumi live-action stage show? It looks to me like ""Amさぎ"" or ""Smさき♡"" but these combinations don't ring any bells...    (Here is a sample from a kigurumi show where the actress signed as Sailor Moon instead of her real/stage name in the same way that Disney costume characters at Disneyland sign as if they were the character)  "

Does anybody know what's in this book? Is it a collection of old manga chapters or just random artwork? Also, is it drawn by Go Nagai or not? I really appreciate your help... "
1915,Why do anime girls have huge chests?,"Today while reading ""Mushoku Tensei"" I once again got confronted with a character with (in my opinion) an insanely large chest. It even got mentioned that it could easily be a J size chest.  I understand that there will off course be some difference per person in their preference in size. But seeing as a D cup is already considered ""big"" where I live, a J size would be considered insane. Hence my question: Why are anime girls often depicted with a huge chest?  Is this just another part of the culture gap between western countries and Japan? Or does it maybe serve as an additional sales point towards a specific fandom?  "
1916,What happened to Yachiru?,"According to the Wikia, Yachiru disappeared leaving her belongings after the fight with Gremmy. She is said to be ""gone"" by Kenpachi in the penultimate chapter of the original series.  I use ""original"" because there might be extra chapters announced as the other big announcement.  So, what happened to her? Was she part of his Zanpakutou or something? "

However, the number does not appear to match any of the characters. On closer inspection, the current numbers are the same except for the first two numbers that change.   At a quick glance, they appear to be dates... is that what they are? The day on which the episode occurs      which would imply the story probably takes place in October of the year 2045?   What is the significance of the numbers used for episode names? "

1919,Clarification about Hashirama's Senjutsu?,"I was browsing about Hashirama's sage mode. What I could procure was that he went to Shikkotsu woods to learn the wood style and the sage mode respective to that.     Shikkotsu Forest (湿骨林, Shikkotsurin, English TV: Shikkotsu Woods, Literally meaning: Damp Bone Forest) is one of the big three unexplored sage regions, a legendary place that is equally famous as the other two: Mount Myōboku and Ryūchi Cave. It is the home of the slug Katsuyu, parts of which are summoned by Tsunade and her disciple Sakura Haruno. - source   How did Hashirama come to know about this forest which is the home of slugs? And what was his background to learning the Senjutsu? Additional question that arises is that Does this mean both Tsunade and Sakura can learn the sage Jutsu? "
1920,Are Tales of Zestiria and Tales of Berseria connected in any way?,"In a Funimation email I got (web version), it was talking about the Tales of Zestiria The X anime. In it, it says     It's time to switch gears and meet a new heroine in our tale and of the upcoming game Tales of Berseria. Velvet Crowe has been imprisoned on a remote island for three years but the time for her breakout has come. With revenge on her mind and demonic powers at her call, will she get what she wants or will her own vengeance create a dangerous bout of malevolence?   What I picked up on was the mention of another Tales of game. Generally from my understanding, most Tales of games are set in/on separate worlds and unless they share the same main title (e.g. Tales of Symphonia/Tales of Symphonia: Dawn of the New World or Tales of Xilla 1/2) are generally independent of one another.  However, as the quote mentions, Velvet Crowe is from Tales of Berseria. Below is a screenshot from the Tales of Zestiria The X that was in the Funimation email.    And below are the cover shot and screenshot from Tales of Berseria showing Velvet.      While she appears to be wearing something different between Tales of Zestiria The X and Tales of Berseria, her face, hair, and arm still look the same.  So I am wondering, is there a connection between Tales of Zestiria and Tales of Berseria? Is the Tales of Zestiria The X anime serving as a bridge between the two? "

Is that book a fictional work, or is it a real work?  In other words, does this book exist in the real world (i.e. for use with MMORPGS such as World of Warcraft, Guild Wars, et al), or is it something that only exists within the Overlord anime/manga universe?

1924,Did Morel find back his pipe?,I remember Morel and Shaiapouf have a fight and Shaiapouf won the fight and took Morel pipe and threw it somewhere else. *I remember he threw it into the sea if no mistake.  So after the fight did Morel find back his pipe? If he didn't have his pipe that mean he is useless currently right? 
1925,Discrepancies between Kishimoto and the Asura Path?,"According to the wiki:     The Asura Path (修羅道, Shuradō) grants the user the ability to augment their own body to summon mechanised armour and various ballistic and mechanical weaponry.   Two questions on this topic.   1) Kishimoto has said there is no technology in the Naruto universe that would defeat the purpose of ninjas, specifically guns and weapons. However, why did he have the Asura Path of Pain equipped with machine guns, rockets, and lasers? Here's a quote from him:     Masashi Kishimoto: Firstly, projectile weapons such as guns aren't allowed. (The one exception is Inari's bowgun.) Guns aren't suited to ninja. Gunpowder is used in the anime, though I don't think it should be there. And, vehicles such as aeroplanes are not allowed. I try to restrain technology that can be used for war... For example, if missiles were in it, it'd be the end. (laughs)   It turns out when Pain assaulted the Hidden Leaf Village, it pretty much was the end! So why did he say these things would not be in the Naruto universe when in fact they were?   2) So all the Rinnegan wielders have access to the Six Paths. Does that mean the highly advanced weapons from the Asura Path of Pain originated from the Sage of the Six Paths himself? In other words, did the Sage of the Six paths have some lesser, technologically inferior form of machine guns, rockets, etc. long ago for his Asura Path powers?  Also, what exactly are the powers for people who've wielded the Rinnegan at some point, like Obito, Madara, and Sasuke, regarding the Asura Path? Can they even use it since it involves constructing your own weapons? Or is there something they do to summon these weapons? "
1926,Why is alchemy powered by tectonic plates?,"   In the manga, alchemy is said to have been taught to Amestrians over 350 years prior to the start of the series by a mysterious man known as The Philosopher from the East and is explained to harness the diastrophic energy that is released from the movement and collision of tectonic plates deep within the Earth's crust to power transmutation.   I am simply confused between the correlation of tectonic plates and alchemy's power. How does the tectonic plates moving act as the fuel for any non-p.stone transmutations??? Alkahestry's source of power being ""chi"", or the lifeforce of the earth itself makes perfect sense; so why is alchemy powered by the movement of tectonic plates? That's so random to me. "
1927,Is there enough evidence to conclude Hans is a fake brave?,"Hans initially accused Adlet of being the fake to escape suspicion.  Then when Adlet returned, he deliberately let him live in order to maintain his alibi. Because of this, Adlet no longer suspected Hans, which worked out according to his plan.  However, Nachetanya still suspected Hans, and pointed out his inconsistencies. Is it safe to say Hans is a fake brave or at least a potential fake brave? Is there any evidence proving his innocence? "
1928,What did Pegasus do with his left eye after the Millennium Eye was removed?,"Maximilian Pegasus (Pegasus J. Crawford in Japanese) had the Millennium Eye in his left eye at the start of the original Yu-Gi-Oh! series.    It was later removed by Bakura, and in later appearances like in Yu-Gi-Oh! GX, his left eye is always covered by his hair.    What did he do with his left eye? Did he use a glass eye? An eye patch? Leave the eye socket empty?  I'd prefer an answer from the anime, but am open to a manga answer as well. "
1929,Why doesn't Kana's boss know about the Day of Flight?,"I'm currently rewatching Haibane Renmei. In episode 4, we see this exchange:     Kana's employer: Hey, is Kana going away?       Rakka: Oh, not at all. I didn't come to replace her. I'm just visiting everyone's workplace because I'm new. Kana loves it here. I can tell.      Employer: I see. Well, with those wings of yours, they make me think she might just fly away on me one day.      Rakka: They look fancy, but they don't actually work at all.      Employer: I see. That's good, then.   It's quite clear from this exchange that Rakka does not know about the Day of Flight, which is probably to be expected, as she's a newcomer who does not learn about it until Kuu leaves.  However, what struck me as strange was that Kana's employer (who looks relatively older and who isn't a Haibane) seems to have no knowledge of it (as might be inferred from his question). It would appear that he is old enough to possibly have seen other Haibane disappear in the past. There are two obvious ways to explain this for me. However, I'm not sure if either of them is correct:   Beyond the trading that the Communicator does with the Toga, the normal townspeople don't have many personal interactions with the Haibane, so they wouldn't notice if one disappeared one day. The townspeople might have a basic understanding of how Haibane life works (so wouldn't be surprised to see the teenage Rakka appear as a ""newborn"" one day) particularly if they often interact with them, but they wouldn't be aware of the specifics.  However, given the limited number of places where Haibane can work (in episode 3), I'm not sure how true this is, since the people who work there would probably be slightly more familiar with things, even if the townspeople seem to outnumber the Haibane. The Haibane are seen as somewhat separate: the employer earlier tells Kana:     The clock tower in your home. Go repair that yourself. [...] We're not supposed to meddle too much in the Haibane's lives.   This might mean that the townspeople might not delve into the specifics of the Haibane's lives, and that the Haibane are responsible for themselves. However, this is more of a general statement than anything, as we see in episode 3 that the housemother isn't a Haibane. Moreover, this would only mean that the townspeople might not bother inquiring after the Haibane who have disappeared (even if they might not know why they've disappeared): it does not mean that they do not necessarily know that the Haibane -- or at least the Haibane outside of the Federation -- eventually ""go away"".   Is there a more satisfying explanation for Kana's employer's ignorance about the fact that the Haibane eventually ""go away"" than these? Or do I already have the best explanation we can get? (Again, I wouldn't expect him to know the exact specifics about the Day of Flight beyond that the Haibane eventually leave.) Alternatively, am I possibly just misinterpreting the exchange? (I could see the first line as implying that the boss does indeed have the Day of Flight in mind, but what he says afterwards seems slightly out of line with that.) "
1930,Is Kid Buu twice as strong as Super Buu?,"I was watching the fight between Goku and Kid Buu in English, and in a moment Goku says Kid Buu is ""twice as powerful as he was before"".

But there is an unexplained connection between Hyouma and Gennosuke. With the order/granting/permitting of Gennosuke, he becomes able to   see. use Gennosuke's ability to control other people's bodies.   What is the explanation of this behavior? What exactly is Hyouma's special ninja technique?    It is used in only two scenes which are listed below. Note that, in the both times, Gennosuke was temporarily blind because of the poison of Hotarubi's snake. His blindness may have something to do with it.  Episode 11   Episode 17  "
1932,What stats are in KonoSuba world and what do they do?,"In KonoSuba's first episode, Aqua is said to have extremely high stats on all stats but below average intelligence and worst luck. Then, she was told that she can be anything but Arch Wizard since it requires intelligence. Arch Wizard, being a Wizard, and as we can see from Megumin, is a class that uses magic to attack. Aqua's low intelligence prevents her from becoming a Arch Wizard, means that magic is related to intelligence.  When they checked Megumin's adventurer card, both Kazuma and Aqua mentioned that Megumin, being from the Crimson Demon clan, has a very high intelligence and is an Arch Wizard. It was also shown that Megumin can cast advanced spell, Explosion although only once a day due to her limited mana.  However, during the fight with Dullahan, Aqua cast Sacred Create Water on a level where it destroyed the gate of the city, causing damage on the level of Megumin's Explosion if not higher.  My question is, since Aqua can't be Arch Wizard due to her low intelligence, while she shows that she can do magic on the level that of Megumin, then what does the intelligence stats do in KonoSuba world? While at it, what are the other stats in KonoSuba and what do they do? "

Or is he another homunculus?  In episode 42, when Van Hohenheim met Pride in an underground passage in Liore, he said that Pride shouldn't have been able to reside outside a spherical body.  This confuses me as to how Selim Bradley can be Pride. Am I missing something here? "
1935,Did Alicia really wear a wedding scarf at the end of Senjou no Valkyria (Valkyria Chronicles)?,"I've found this image by coincidence, but it immediately attracted my attention because I never saw such a scene in the anime.    Concerning the drawing style/animation (from the looks of it I doubt it's fan-made, it seems to be more like a screenshot), the sunset, Welkin's clothes (he wears them very rarely and if I remember correctly, he wears them only at the very end of the anime) and progression of the story (they end up together in the last episode (26)), this image has to be from the very end of the anime, but I couldn't find anything like it.  I've also watched it on different websites, but they all end with Alicia and Welkin holding hands in the sunset on a hill in front of their village.  Where is this screenshot from? Does that scene really happen in the anime or is it from the game? "
1936,How did so many people get away with cheating during the written portion of the Chunin Exam?,"Disclaimer: I never read past the Sasuke Retrieval Arc, so it is possible that my question may be answered if I had read further. However, I do believe that the Chunin Exam arc, which is what my question is about, is far enough from the Sasuke Retrieval Arc that my question would have already been answered by the time the story arrives at the Sasuke Retrieval Arc.   I will be referencing the part of the Chunin Exam Arc where the characters take the written portion of the exam. This is in volume 5 of the Naruto tankoban (which covers chapters 37 - 45).  During my trip down memory lane with my re-reading of what I have read of Naruto, this question occurred to me: how did so many characters get away with, at least to me, seemingly obvious, cheats during the written portion of the Chunin exam?  Here is a list of cheats in particular that went unnoticed that I would like to know how they managed to do so:   Akamaru was barking the answers to Kiba. We know that dogs are used a fair amount by skilled ninja, including Kakashi himself, so would it not be logical for the proctors to assume that a dog could be used to cheat? I can believe Shino's insect trick because ninja-insect interaction is much rarer than ninja-dog interaction since it is an ability exclusive to Shino's clan and also a fly buzzing is much more inaudible than a dog barking. Naruto and Hinata were having a full-blown conversation, it was whispering, but still a conversation nonetheless. How did none of the proctors notice? Also going along the lines of communication with other ninja in the room, how did Tenten manage to communicate to Rock Lee to raise his head band to notify her that he was able to see her mirrors in the ceiling/how did she communicate to him that the mirrors were even there without getting caught? How did Tenten get those mirrors up in the ceiling undetected in the first place? I cannot imagine that it was done before the exam started, unless she was planning to cheat from the very start, without knowing what the exam was going to be like. I can believe Kankuro and his Crow cheat because it is much easier to set-up Crow as a proctor undetected in the masses of ninja in the room than it is to set-up a mirror system in the ceiling. Ino's Mind Body Switch Technique requires hand seals. How did she get away with using it on Sakura without being seen? I would imagine that hand seals would be the very first thing that the proctors would look out for considering it is an exam for ninja. Proctor Ibiki himself actually SEES Gaara making a hand gesture that could pass as a hand seal if the next panel had not revealed that he was just using that hand gesture to cover his eye so he could create the sand eye. But even so, Ibiki did claim to count ""anything out of the ordinary"" as cheating, and a suspicious hand gesture resembling a hand seal, I would say, qualifies as ""out of the ordinary"", so why did he not call Gaara out? I realize that this last point is a bit too hypothetical and assumes too much, but  we do know that there are ninja who can sense chakra usage. I do not recall this directly from the manga, but taking a look at Ino's Wiki page here, it says that she is one of such ninja (eventually, but that is not the point; I am just linking to show that there does exist chakra sensing ninja). Surely [I know, this is a large assumption here], there must be some proctor in the room who would have such an ability since it is a ninja exam, so why did no one detect the chakra expenditure that was going on in the room?   "
1937,Why does the author replace the protagonist and his family with a bird?,"    What does the bird symbolize in Oyasumi Punpun?  Wiki says:     Punpun is depicted as a caricature bird, but this depiction changes frequently throughout the story to express his state of mind. The other characters, unlike the audience, only see his human form, since the caricature birds he and his family are seen as are entirely figurative.   Why does author represents the parents and the protagonist as a bird even if they have different states of mind? "
1938,Where to submit anime idea?,"If one has come up with an anime manuscript, where or who should you write to if you want to know if the idea is of interest and actually could become something?

1941,What happened to the other androids in Dragon Ball/Dragon Ball Z?,"In Dragon Ball Z, we are well acquainted with Androids 16, 17, and 18. In addition, we met Androids 19 and 20 (Dr. Gero) before 16-18. There may have been mention of others, but they were not developed or mentioned much to the extent of my memory.   I also think that we were introduced to Android 8 in Dragon Ball (the episode where Goku is ascending up the Muscle Tower with a new foe on each floor, one of which was Ninja Murasaki who on finding himself outmatched, ordered Android 8 to fight Goku, if I remember correctly).  However, I do not remember any mention of Androids 1-7, 9-15, and 21+, if they exist. Do they exist? Do we ever find out or know what happened to them? Is it further discussed in the manga? "

Yet, sites like the Symphogear wikia claim (or at least have, in the past, claimed) to translate the chants - for example, Ichaival's chant was given the translation ""Evening draws in the awakened Ichaival"".   Is it genuinely possible to translate the chants? If so, from what language or languages are they translated? (In the context of the show, Sumerian or some other old Mesopotamian language would make the most sense, because of Finé's connections to the region.)  Auxiliary question: if, as I suspect, they are not translatable, by what citogenetic process did these putative translations come into being in the first place? "
1944,"What does Playmaker mean when he says ""Arrowheads confirmed!""?","Whenever Playmaker performs a Link Summon in Yu-Gi-Oh VRAINS, he starts by saying      アローヘッド確認！！！   Arrowheads confirmed!   What does that mean? I know that some characters in the Yu-Gi-Oh series have their own catchphrases they sometimes say during special kinds of summons, but what is the meaning behind this one specifically? Does it have something to do with confirming summoning conditions? What does the ""arrowhead"" have to do with this? "
1945,Can the Tailed Beasts produce offsprings?,"Is it possible for the Tailed Beasts to produce offspring of their own? Both 'male' and 'female' type Tailed Beasts exist.   The offspring would be hybrid, but still, would it be possible? "
1946,Who can absorb the Genki Dama?,"In the Dragonball Movie, Super Android 13 Goku absorbs the Genki Dama to become more powerful and defeat his rival. Apparently (not sure), something similar could happen in Dragon Ball Super for a preview from the following episodes which was released.   That leads me to the question, who can absorb the Genki Dama? Is only the creator the Genki Dama who can absorb it? Or can someone else with good ki absorb it too?   We've seen in the first Genki Dama Goku made that someone with good spirit like Gohan could bounce the Genki Dama, may be someone with good ki can absorb it too? "
1947,Are the final events of DBZ considered canon?,"In Dragon Ball Z, the series flashes forward 10 years after the defeat of Buu and we're introduced to things like Gohan and Videl's daughter Pan, lazy teenage versions of Trunks and Goten, and a reincarnated Buu (Uub).  Since Dragon Ball Super begins sometime shortly after the defeat of Buu, are the flash forward events of DBZ wiped from canon, similar to the GT history?  My biggest point of confusion is the fact that Pan is 4 in the final events of DBZ which means she was born 6 years after Goku kills Buu. But at the beginning of Dragon Ball Super, Gohan and Videl announce they're pregnant with Pan. This could be explained easily if Super picked up some 5 years after Buu's defeat but Goten and Trunks appear to be the same age as they were in Z. So it seems likely that Pan is born way earlier than 6 years after Buu's defeat.  Do these events reconcile or was the end of Z undone to make room for Super to tell new stories? "
1948,Which level of Super Saiyan was Vegeta in Episode 8 of Dragon Ball Super?,"Vegeta was able to hit Beerus a few times in his episode 8 Super Saiyan level while Goku at Super Saiyan 3 was not able to. Canonically, Vegeta has never gone Super Saiyan 2 before (unless you consider Majin Vegeta to be Super Saiyan 2).   So which level did he go to in this episode? Super Saiyan 2 or something ascended? "
1949,Has the world in One Piece's world map been fully defined?,"From what I understand, Nami became a straw hat pirate to draw a map of the whole world. Doing so forces the implication that the whole world hasn't been traversed yet, in spite of the claims of Gol D. Roger the King of Pirates.   This leads me to believe that there is still a part of the world untraveled by any pirate. Because if there wasn't, then there wouldn't be a driving goal behind her character development.  So, can we really trust the current layout of the One Piece world? Or, has Oda made any announcements or claims that the world of One Piece as we know it is complete in its design? "
1950,How long does the producing of long run anime take?,"I know that this is already asked before in How long does producing a cour take?  But I assume that it's only related to the seasonal anime that appear once per season (except when it already has a sequel).  Does the production of the long run anime series like One piece, Bleach, HunterxHunter, Naruto, Toriko, and Detective Conan take the same amount of time?  I think this question is different from the question I mentioned before. As it only covers cours. "
1951,What is carved into Toko's leg?,"DanganRonpa: Ultra Despair Girls came out today in Europe and there's something I noticed about the 3D model of Toko Fukawa.      A.K.A Genocider Jack     There's something cut into her leg. I'm not sure that picture is an official model from the game, but I have definitely seen it while playing (screenshot below):    In the other games, we mostly see her waist-up - or in an uncut skirt, so I've never noticed it before:    What has she got carved into her leg?  I've only been playing the games - is there another source that describes how it got there? "
1952,When did Lelouch take the Code from his father?,"When I was just searching for theories for why people believe Lelouch is still alive, I found a theory which says Lelouch took the Geass from his dad, so when he was killed he actually became immortal. But on re-watching the series I can't find any such scene where we see Lelouch taking the Code from his dad. Or did I miss something?  When I watched the anime for the first time, I remember it had extra scenes like Lelouch driving the cart, which wasn't present when I re-watched the series. I read that it was removed later.  So, did the writers remove the scene in which Lelouch takes the Code from his dad? I am getting an impression that the writers had plans on keeping Lelouch alive, initially. They came out and said the ending was left ambiguous for the reader to interpret as they want, and then, they removed that scene and declared Lelouch is dead.  "
1953,What's the reason Dio and Joutarou could fly in Stardust Crusaders?,"When I watched the first season of Jojo no Kimyou na Bouken: Stardust Crusaders, I have never seen Joutarou fly with his stand, but suddenly in season 2 of Stardust Crusaders when Joutarou confronted Dio, he did fly. You could see on this scene, they did fly when they punch each other. Is this new ability of their stand?  "
1954,When did Erina learn that Yukihira's father was Joichiro?,"It is a known fact that Yukihira Soma is the son of one of the world's most famous chefs, Yukihira Joichiro.  When did Nakiri learn that Yukihira Soma's father was Joichiro? In which chapter? "
1955,Why does cutting out part of Orochimaru’s soul cause him to lose the use of his arms?,"When Orochimaru and the Third Hokage fight after the Chunin exam, the Third Hokage has the Shinigami cut out part of his soul, ""taking away his jutsu"" by making him lose the use of his arms. How does that work? Why does it specifically make his arms not work? Logically, it would pull from the part was the farthest from the chest where it was being pulled from, which would be the feet. Why is that not what happens? "
1956,How is Zamasu supposed to be alive in Dragon Ball Heroes?,"I dont think I missed an explanation in the anime, but I'm not sure if I missed on in the manga. How is Zamasu supposed to be alive in Dragon Ball Heroes? Is the same Zamasu? "
1957,How exactly was Kyousuke able to defeat Kengo's father in a kendo match?,"In Little Busters!: Refrain, we saw exactly how Kyousuke was able to get Masato to fight with only one hand and eventually defeat and befriend him. However, when it comes to how Kengo was recruited into the Little Busters, it wasn't played out in as much detail as Masato's. Specifically, I'm referring to this scene:    There's no doubt that Kyousuke had used some dirty tricks on Kengo's father, but I need more explanation on what was Kyousuke holding and what tricks he pulled to overcome my disbelief that a kid could defeat a kendo master in a kendo match, fair or not. Was it ever explained in more details in the visual novel? "
1958,Why does Dragon Ball Z have the letter Z in its title?,"Why is did they add the letter Z in this series of Dragon Ball? It seems kind of odd to throw that letter in there for no reason. I know that the Z is symbolized a lot in Dragon Ball Z (ex. The Z Sword, The Z Fighters, Zenie, etc.) but what does the Z literally stand for, and for what reason Akira Toriyama decide to use this letter in the title? "
1959,Why didn't Mello see Shinigami after touching the Death Note in Episode 29?,"I asked this question on Movies &amp; TV SE, but was requested to ask here.   In the 29th episode of Death Note (Father), a third Shinigami (Sidoh) arrived at Los Angeles to get his notebook back.  He needed the current owner (which was one of the Mello's subordinates, Jack Neylon) to touch the Death Note in order to see him.  How did Jack Neylon become the owner of the note if he didn't touch it?   And when Sidoh arrived, the Death Note was in the hands of Mello, but he didn't see Sidoh. Why is that? "
1960,"Is Migatte no Gokui the same ability of moving without thinking, as Whis explained to Goku and Vegeta when training them?","When Whis was training Goku and Vegeta, he told them they should try to acquire the ability of having each part of your body moving independently without thinking.   Was Whis talking about Migatte no Gokui, ability Goku got in the last episode? "
1961,Is Mangirl based off a real story to some degree?,"Mangirl is about a group of girls who start up their own manga magazine called Earth Star Entertainment.  While I was looking up some info about the show, I noticed that the original manga was serialized in ""Earth Star Entertainment's Comic Earth Star magazine"" (Source: Wikipedia). This seems to be a real company with a real website that even shares its logo with the fictional company's logo in the show.    Is any of Mangirl based on anything from the real life Earth Star Entertainment? For example, were the creators of the real life company all females or all amateurs, similar to the characters in the show? "
1962,"What is a ""fangirl moment""?","So I found this image highlighting the difference between an Otaku and a Weeaboo.    The 4th point says     Has ""fangirl moments"" at anytime, anywhere, and infront of anyone   But what are ""fangirl moments""? and what are their origin? (Is it actually from anime) "
1963,Why did Lelouch erase Shirley's memories of him?,"We all know that Lelouch erased Shirley's memories of him, during the Mao case. But why? Couldn't he just have erased her memories of him being Zero, instead of erasing all memories about him? "
1964,How many number of anime sales in Japan is considered as profitable?,"I was really curious so I wanted to know: How much sales of anime in Japan is considered profitable? By sales I mean the DVD or something like that. I heard that anime season or continuation is based on the sales in Japan so, any guess? "
1965,What is Katakuri's power?,   Katakuri is one of the sweet generals in big mom army and the strongest one of them.   we saw him     growing extra limb or moving them like an octopus. At some point he even performed the Elephant Gun move that is a signature move of Luffy with rubber body. He can also predict the future to some degree.   So what is his powers exactly? is he a devil fruit user or this is just some other race in One Piece world? 
1966,What's Koko's theme song in Enmusubi no Youko-chan?,"I've searched everywhere to find it but unfortunately, I only found OP or ED.  The song plays in episode 13, from 10:41 to 11:45 (YouTube reference)  What's the song when Koko appears?  "
1967,What happened at the end of Wasurenagumo?,"So at the end of Wasurenagumo, we have Mizuki:      With the spider girl and Shu. Spider girl makes Mizuki fall into the giant spider, Shu doesn't seem to care, then we're back in the city and the spider girl is with Shu and she looks like Mizuki now (or other way around?)   So did,      Mizuki die (and Shu didn't care)? Was there an ulterior motive for killing Mizuki, who seems to have simply been at the wrong place at the wrong time with the wrong person?  "
1968,How did Madoka essentially become the universe when all she wished for was to erase the witches before their creation?,"I get that Madoka would have to be a fundamental law of the universe considering that she's overwriting the concepts that the universe is based upon, but her only wish was that to erase all witches before their creation. However, somehow, Madoka now suddenly knows everything about the universe, including how Homura worked hard to save Madoka throughout all those different timelines. How does she have access to that information? How was she given vision of the entire universe and all events within if her wish didn't reach that far? She only had one goal and that's all she wished for, but she was given sight of the whole universe. "
1969,"Was the ""Cake Song"" released in a soundtrack?","I have 3 Puella Magi Madoka Magica The Rebellion Story soundtracks. they are,   OP Single - Colorful ED Single - Kimi no Gin no Niwa Original Soundtrack   I believed this was all there was and while waiting for an appointment i searched though all 3 looking to see if i could find the Cake Song that the Puella Magi sing at the beginning of the movie (when the Nightmare is changed into a cake for Bebe to eat).   i thought i might find it as just before i listened to wo ist die Kase? from Puella Magi Madoka Magica The Beginning Story &amp; The Eternal Story Original Soundtrack, Track 7. if i remember correctly this is the song/chant that's in the background when Sayaka and Madoka enter a labyrinth before Mami saves them, and it only goes for about 40-45 seconds (track file on my iPod/iPhone says 50 seconds however there's a block of silence at the end).  But after listening to all the songs in The Rebellion Story soundtracks i couldn't find the Cake Song. However i admit i didn't listen to the entirety of every song, rather the first couple of second then i skip about a couple of minutes to listen to another couple of seconds.  So i am wondering if the Cake Song was officially released on a soundtrack, if so which one? "
1970,Are the events in this manga panel happening simultaneously?,"I know manga is usually read right to left, top to bottom, but this panel confuses me a bit.    The guy on the right looks all annoyed and ""!"" first, and then we have the blonde sliding in like 'are you guys on a date too?', but chronologically isn't this a contradiction? Shouldn't we have seen the main character ask his question first and then spiky guy's reaction?   Or is this panel showing things simultaneously?  If someone could show me in what direction/chronology I'm supposed to read/understand this, it'd really help. "
1971,How do Salamanders keep Aqua warm?,"At the end of the first season, when Ai-chan meets Akatsuki, she says that Salamanders work to keep Aqua warm by fighting one another inside the floating building seen in the series.  However, I can't really believe that Salamanders just fight one another all day and night to keep the planet warm. So what is it Salamanders actually do and why does Ai-chan think they fight one another? (because Akari can't have been the one to put that in her head.... right?) "
1972,"Is it possible to use magic without saying ""System Call"" in Sword Art Online - Alicization?","I was wondering if it's possible to execute system commands without saying 'System Call'. The anime series Sword Art Online: Alicization shows something like that but I was wondering if the characters really didn't say 'System Call' or it was just obviated and not shown to the spectators. In Chapter 21:        Kirito is fighting with Eugeo when he said: 'Burst Element' generating a powerful wind burst. But he didn't say 'System Call' nor 'Generate Aerial Element'.  Also, The Administrator healed the wounds of Eugeo without saying anything. In addition, she blocked Eugeo's attacks with a magical shield without saying any command.   I was wondering if both characters used the proper commands to cast magic but it wasn't shown to the spectators or in-universe, they didn't say anything.  Maybe they are so powerful that they no longer need to call the system using 'System Call', they just use telepathy or something like that due to their high authority level or a previous secret command? Or maybe the command was just skipped by the director of the anime?  Is there any clue about this on the manga or the novel? Anything? I love spoilers. "
1973,What are the differences between Super Saiyan God and Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan?,"As stated in the title, what are the differences between the two? Are they supposed to be entirely different or is simply the next stage of the previous? "
1974,How does detective Kagami's sister get killed?,"How does detective Kagami's sister get killed? And I guess I'm looking for specifics, like did the killer break her legs, etc? From what I saw, her body was dangling, and it looked as if her arms were cut off. "
1975,Do all ki warriors need to power up?,"Time and again beginning with the later dragonball episodes and lkater dbz, dbzsuper,...) we see ki warriors power up before they unleash their true powers / strongest attacks.  Now I'm wondering though...as it seems powerup was only introduced later on when ki sensing and ki suppression was introduced: Do ALL ki warriors need to power up to unleash their strongest attacks / full power? Or is it only necesary when you suppress your power level to power up first? "
1976,Why did Igneel not attack Acnologia on Tenrou Island?,"For those who have read the Tartaros Arc.      In the Tartaros Arc we learn that the Dragons were hiding within the Dragon Slayers since the year 777. Hence, why Natsu and Gajeel could not leave the guild during the battle of Fairy Tail. We learn that they were hiding to build antibodies to prevent Dragon Slayers to turn into Dragons once again and were waiting for a moment to defeat Acnologia. Yet they had their chance to defeat Acnologia on Tenrou Island. Why did they not seize their chance then and there? With Makarov, Gildartz, Laxus around, they would have had a much better chance of defeating him. So why did they not attack on Tenrou Island?  "
1977,Was anything past volume 7 ever released in English?,"I'm referring to the manga Satisfaction Guaranteed by Ryo Saenagi. I came across this manga quite a few years ago, and really loved it!  I bought the first 7 volumes in English, which are distributed by Tokyopop. When I was finished reading them I tried to find volume 8 on Amazon, but didn't have any luck.  I searched and found that, in Japanese, nine volumes were released to complete the series.  But I couldn't find them in English anywhere.  I come back to this problem every couple of years and do a search in hope that something has changed, but I still can never find volumes 8 or 9.  Does anyone have any idea what happened to this manga?  If it really was never released in English beyond volume 7, as seems to be the case, then it seems the best I could hope for is to buy the volumes in Japanese and find a translation somewhere on the internet. If anyone knows where I can find such a thing, I'd greatly appreciate it. "
1978,Can universe 6 saiyans turn into Oozaru?,"In universe 7 saiyans need a tale to turn into Oozarus. How about universe 6 saiyans? Do they have this transformation? Can Kyabe, Kale, Caulifla, kefura turn into Oozaru? "
1979,Does Boruto have Sasuke's headband?,"In Boruto, does Boruto have Sasuke's headband (from the original Naruto series)? If so, why does Boruto have Sasuke's headband? Or will Boruto abandon Konoha sometime in the future, and put a missing-nin slash on his headband?    This question was inspired by the above image. Also, what does the extra scar (which matches with Boruto's eye scar) mean? If that is Sasuke's headband, why would Boruto wear it instead of his own? Also wasn't Sasuke's headband blue, not black?  I would appreciate any canon references that explain this. "
1980,How was Sayaka able to join Madoka in the Law of Cycles after her death?,"Adding onto this question, right after Madoka recreated the entire universe to accommodate with the Law of Cycles, why was everybody placed back in time right after the event where Sayaka gets killed in battle? Why were they placed specifically there in time? Also, do all magical girls join the Law of Cycles after they die? If they do, then what is the point? Madoka's wish was to erase all witches with her own hands, so anybody else in the Law of Cycles wouldn't have a job to carry out since Madoka would be doing it all herself. "
1981,Did anyone find and remove Kiritsugu's explosives?,"In this answer, I pointed out how Kiritsugu planned to use dynamite and the ley-lines to stop the Holy Grail War from occurring again. However, the plan failed because there was an excess amount of Prana in the Grail which caused the next Holy Grail War to occur earlier.  Given that regardless of the ending, the Greater Grail would be stopped (either by the events of Heaven's Feel, or Lord El-Melloi II and Rin dismantling it 10 years later), what happened to Kiritsugu's explosives?  All Wikia says is     The premature occurrence of the Fifth Holy Grail War and the subsequent destruction of the ritual means that it no longer has a purpose.   Yet it also said     The process involved utilizing stocked dynamite and the manipulation of ley-lines to ensure a severe localized earthquake in the targeted area within thirty to forty years of the Fourth War   I'm not sure how big the localized earthquake would be, but since the targeted area would be where the Greater Grail is, and it is under Mount Enzou which according to the Wikia is where Ryuudou Temple is and doesn't look all that far from the school according to a Fate/Hollow Ataraxia map  So did anyone find and remove Kiritsugu's explosives? If not, do we know if they pose a threat to Fuyuki? "
1982,What was Hirohiko Araki's inspiration to create JoJo's Bizarre Adventure?,"I was wondering what was Araki's inspiration in creating this manga? How did this idea came into reality? Also, how did he came up with the 'Stands'? "
1983,Why do the dogs pet the characters in Nichijou?,"I have seen this scene where it's only Yukko who's laying on the ground and they just like petting the Nichijou character just like that, but the one who did that in the different scene is just only the big dog.  What's the reason these two dogs doing this? And, why a dog?   "
1984,What is this dance that characters in Nichijou do during the episode breaks?,I always seen this kind of clip in every of Nichijou episode (but with different movement). You can see them doing that on this Scene  Is this just some random movement?   
1985,How do I figure out the contents of doujinshi?,"I have been to Japan and saw all these doujinshi manga which all look really interesting just by their cover. But how do Japanese people actually figure out the content of these books? There is no plot written anywhere, and you generally cannot open them.  For example, I have been reading 孤独のグルメ (Kodoku no Gurume) and I saw doujinshi based on it. Should I think ""the manga was good so let's try this version""? Or is there somewhere to look at to find out the content?  Does it work only by word-of-mouth or are there any resources on the internet we can check to have more information on the different authors and their doujinshi? "
1986,Did Goku actually die near end of Frieza saga? Plothole?,"So I am going through and rewatching Dragonball Z with my wife and noticed something.  When Goku is fighting Freiza as a SSJ, he gets sent into lava during the process of King Kai's wish for bringing back everyone that ""Frieza and his henchmen killed"".   So my first question is:  Did Goku die in this moment? Seems that the events went as follows:   King Kai starts wish Goku goes into lava and dies. Goku is brought back to life from King Kai's wish Goku is much more powerful and full of energy (finally having the edge over Freiza vs before these events when it was a pretty much stalemate)   This makes me think that yes Goku died but then this reveals a plot hole as the wish was made with the earth dragonballs which were stated many times to not be able to revive someone already revived from them before. Well Goku was revived for the Vegeta / Nappa arc already. Plot hole?  Second question:  After Namek blows up it is said by King Kai if someone were to be wished back they would appear wherever they died and basically making it so Goku can't be wished back since Namek is gone but later Vegeta states they can wish someone back to the Earth's check-in station and then wished back to life.   So they do they following 3 wishes:   Ask for Krillin to be wished to the Earth's check-in station Wish Krillin back to life. Seems to work based on rules. Wish Yamcha back to life. He doesn't have to be wished to the check-in station as well?   Is this because Yamcha was in a ""safe place""? Why did't they need two wishes like they did with Krillin?  FYI, even though I know many documented plot holes exist, and I could very well be wrong with my logic above, I enjoy learning things that I may have missed and having the discussion at least "
1987,"if Beerus, Whis, and other gods of destructions and angels can use Ultra Instinct, why they dont get Goku's aura?","Supposedly gods of destructions and angels can use ultra instinct, but they dont get the aura and eye colors Goku gets. Why is that? Is Goku using something else in this transformation, such a super saiyan transformation on top of it, god ki or something? "
1988,Why isn't Frieza permanently in his golden form?,"In Dragon Ball Super, Frieza is shown to have surpassed the limitation of his golden form, the stamina drain.  Why isn't he permanently in this form? Is there anything stopping him from doing so? "
1989,"Is this ring merchandise with a red seal and gold ""忍"" emblem exist in Naruto?","This is a ring with a red seal and gold ""忍"" emblem.    I don't know whether this type of ring is in Naruto.  Who wears it? Is it a knockoff? "
1990,"In the manga, how did Asako contact Ushio from within the sea serpent?","In episode 6 of the Ushio to Tora anime, Asako and a boy she meets at the beach (Tatsuya) find themselves swallowed by some sort of giant sea serpent monstrosity. In the anime, Asako calls her grandparents' beach house using her cell phone, and that's how Ushio learns that she's in trouble.   But the manga was written back in the early '90s, before cell phones were commonplace (the anime has been relieved of some of the trappings of the '90s [much as Parasyte was] in the interest of appealing to modern audiences). How did this scene play out there? How did Ushio find out what had happened to Asako and Tatsuya? "
1991,Did Ryu have an affair or was it Maki?,"Did Ryu have the affair and that's why Maki wrote ""Liar"" to Ryu? Or did Ryu's friend make that up? "
1992,Why didn't Kamui kill obito?,"When Kakashi used Kamui on Deidara, his hand was cut off since it was wrapped to the Kamui dimension.  How is Obito able to warp his body parts in and out of Kamui without dying?  Is there a valid explanation for this? Or is this a plot hole?  "
1993,Why can Sailor Pluto be away from the Space-Time Door?,"In the classic 90s anime, Sailor Pluto was commissioned by Queen Serenity (mom of Princess Serenity [Sailor Moon's ancient incarnation]) to guard the Space-Time Door, which she is shown doing in the R season, but she is later allowed to leave, and thus shows up with a civilian form (Setsuna) in the S season.  One of the 3 rules given by Queen Serenity was that she could not leave her post at the door.  She does go on to break all of the rules, but according to Wikipedia, Neo-Queen Serenity (future Sailor Moon) gives her permission to leave her post.  But why?  Does the door not need to be guarded anymore?  Is it temporary leave and she will need to return eventually, or is it permanent leave?  In the manga, Sailor Pluto's guarding location might be located outside of time (or is it located inside of the palace in 30th century Crystal Tokyo?), so perhaps she could technically be there as well as have a 20th century civilian incarnation that is at a point inside of time, so she could apparently continue to guard the door while she shows up in S, the SuperS movie, and Sailor Stars (but this is unrelated to why Neo Queen Serenity would excuse her from her post in the classic anime).  In the Sailor Moon Crystal canon, is Sailor Pluto able to and/or permitted to leave her post at the door? Is this aspect identical to the manga version? "
1994,"What song plays at 1:21:01 in the movie ""Futari no Hero"" (""Two Heroes"")?","In My Hero Academia: Two Heroes movie, at 1:21:01 when the other kids arrive and start attacking the villain, a certain song is played from the time      Bakugo says ""What are you doing getting all beat up by such a damn lame last boss?"" until the villain tangles All Might (practically during the time All Might goes Plus Ultra).   As far as I know, the song is not even included in the movie's OST discs.  Does anyone know what the name of that song is? "
1995,Why didn't Kenjirou Hata continue Ad Astra Per Aspera?,"The manga Ad Astra Per Aspera is currently on hiatus. The author, Kenjirou Hata, according to the internet (I forgot the source), stopped working on Ad Astra  Per Aspera because he wanted to focus on Hayate No Gotoku.  Then why didn't Kenjirou Hata continue Ad Astra Per Aspera, even after he just finished his other work Hayate no Gotoku in April?  UPDATE   I read this news: Hayate's Author Has Already Drawn 6 Chapters of New Manga Series. Does anyone know what that new manga series he's working on would be? Is it possible that it is Ad Astra Per Aspera?  UPDATE 05/11/2018  The manga that been talked about on this article is Tonikaku Kawaii a new manga series by Hata kenjirou on Shounen Sunday Magazine, that was first published on Feb 14, 2018. The manga still on going.    "
1996,What is the Toaru Kagaku no Railgun manga release schedule?,"Very recently, the Toaru Kagaku no Railgun manga series resumed after its break with Chapter 71/72 (They kinda messed with the chapter numbers, weird).

1998,What is the significance of the rescue of Nagate and Shizuka by 256 Guardians?,"I didn't understand what happened at the sixth episode. Can you explain me the point listed below?   Why did 256 guardians come for the rescue? Why so many, and why 28 of them? Why did the guardians break the law by rescuing them? What is wrong with the rescue? Why does it become unlawful? Why didn't the command center plan the rescue beforehand? Where they abandoned there officially?  "
1999,What are Croquembouche?,"    What are Croquembouche?  They can speak.They are delicious.Big mom was fed these stuffs by Jinbe. Are they living beings?

He throws the croquembouche into Big Moms' mouth, immediately satiating her. The croquembouche are glad to be eaten if they are found to be delicious.'   How are they tourists?

2000,Why was Spike looking for beans in “Cowboy Bebop: The Movie”?,In Cowboy Bebop: The Movie how did Spike know where to look for the virus? How did he end up in that Moroccan styled market?  Do we see him getting any leads that lead him there? 
2001,What did the old man say to the bartender at the end?,"In the short one-shot Death Billiards, the old man says something to the bartender at the end when they choose which elevator to get into (presumably, one goes to hell and the other to heaven). What did the old man say? He smirked at the end so it seemed like he got something that he wanted or had somehow tricked the younger man. The bartender wouldn't say what it was. Am I missing something or is this just completely wide-open-ended? "
2002,Why does Evangelion manga's plot diverge from the anime?,"I have read the manga, all of it, and I have watched the first 13 episodes of NGE. And it surprised me, because the plots were different with the manga (well, just some of it). Especially the ending in manga. I wonder why the ending and the plot were different? What's the reason for that?  And how was the manga made in 1994, while the anime aired in 1995? Which one came first? Was Evangelion based on manga?  "

Right after finishing the anime, I found out that they skipped a portion of the manga in season 3 (around episode 16) and would like to read more about it the potion that they skipped.  What part(s) of the manga did the anime not cover (were entire chapters or arcs skipped?) and where would they have fit into the anime? "

Why didn't the hunter associate search for Meruem's body? Did the bunker that Meruem located at is really invisible?   "
2006,Is Goku still pure-hearted?,"This question could seem as an opinion based question, but let me try to explain why I think it is not. In Dragon Ball, Goku was supposed to be completely pure-hearted to be able to ride the Flying Nimbus, to the point he needed to have no bad intentions at all, otherwise he couldn't stand in the top of it, he had to be a sort of Super Saiyan Jesus. At some point in the Dragon Ball series, Vegeta emphasizes this by saying Goku never dared to kill someone (because of this).   But at some point after that, Goku indeed kills someone, that is kid Bu. With Piccolo before, someone could argue he didn't actually finished him because he immediately reincarnated or so, but this isn't the case of kid Buu. And now, in Dragon Ball Super, Goku is doing something different to what he always did. When someone threatened the Earth or the universe, no matter how strong he was, he at least tried to defeat him. But with the case of Zeno, he didn't even try. Someone could argue Zeno is so powerful that he knew he couldn't defeat him, but is Zeno that powerful? He isn't almighty because several Zenos were created by Trunks and Zamasu when messing with time, Zeno isn't unbelievably strong because he can't follow Dyspo's moves. At some point I thought this ""destroying all universes"" thing was a fake, but now the manga has shown that      indeed Zeno destroys all universes permanently and the great priest doesn't care, he only acknowledges Zeno whims.   Why Goku didn't even try to defeat Zeno by training and merging with Vegeta or whatever, and he doesn't care much about all the universes which are being destroyed every time he defeats them? Is Goku still pure-hearted? "
2007,Can we share our devil fruit to someone else?,"For example, i have gomu gomu no mi. I already know that this is a devil fruit that whoever eat this fruit will gain a new power.

2008,Why did Midori become Seiji's right hand?,"In Midori Days, Seiji woke up one morning to find his right hand to be Midori. Why is this so? Is it some kind of a curse? Was it explained in the manga or anime why?  "

2011,Can Brook marry a real woman and have real kids (human kids)?,"He can almost do everything: eat, drink, poop (Luffy asked him when they first met), etc. Brook even says by drinking milk, his broken bones heal faster. So it seems food has effect in his body.  So I was just wondering that after a certain age, all the straw hats will retire and have a family. Will Brook also be able to do so?

2012,Strawberry Haagen Dazs: The favored flavor of anime murderers?,"Has anyone noticed how certain anime regarding murder and death that there is usually a reference to Haagen Dazs in there somewhere? Strawberry Haagen Dazs to be specific.   In certain anime, such as Kara no Kyokai episode 5 where the main character tends to eat nothing but strawberry Haagen Dazs.

2013,Cost for fan-made manga and artbook in Comiket?,"There is a con in Japan called Comiket. This con is held twice a year. There are like a hundred of circles/booths that sell their merchandise.

2014,Why was Neji Hyuuga surprised to see Naruto's Kage Bunshin no Jutsu in the Chuunin Exams?,"In the final round of the Chuunin Exams, when the match between Neji and Naruto starts, Neji is surprised when Naruto uses Kage Bunshin no Jutsu. He had seen Naruto use the same technique in the match against Kiba in the preliminaries. So he should have known that they were solid clones that can fight unlike the clones created by the Bunshin no Jutsu.    Why was Neji surprised when he saw Naruto's shadow clones?  Was Neji unaware of the Kage Bunshin Jutsu, which is a very popular jutsu used by the shinobi? "
2015,How old was Natsu when he was sent forward in time?,I know Natsu was 7 (or so speculated) when the dragons left. I know he was sent forward in time when that happened. However why doesn't Natsu remember what the world was like 400 years ago? I mean I think he would notice a difference... even if he was only 7. Was his memory altered or something? 
2016,"What is the name of the Naruto song that plays at the end of ""Battle at sea: The power unleashed""?",I know its a flute song that plays in the end of the episode. It has a nice melody to it but I can't seem to find it anywhere. I hope I can find the song cause it's pretty soothing.   [website]It starts around the 16 minute mark. 
2017,Can a mangaka continue another mangaka's manga?,"There are plenty of manga that never had an ending for many reasons. For example, High School of the Dead's mangaka, Daisuke Satou, has passed away. Some mangaka also cannot continue their work because of health problems, as well as other reasons. Say the original mangaka either prepared or did not prepare an ending himself/herself, can another mangaka continue their work? Has this ever happened before? "
2018,How long can a manga (or other work) can go hiatus,"Sometimes a manga went hiatus for quite long time, for example HxH was on hiatus from 2014 to 2016   Source [website]If there are no health issue or any major problem, since it can't be helped if that was the case, how long can a manga or any other work go on hiatus? What if the mangaka didn't show any interest on continuing their work? Would they, the publisher, dropped it even if it was popular? "

2021,is ultra super saiyan a transformation or a state?,"In the battle of Vegeta vs Trunks, when Trunks goes ultra super saiyan, Vegeta states: ""are you still relying on that sluggish transformation?"".   [website]That leads me to think ultra super saiyan is indeed a (useless) transformation and not a state, but now in the manga Wiss states Goku has 5 transformations, 1,2,3 god and blue. Since Goku was also able to go Ultra Super Saiyan, what does this mean, is Ultra Super Saiyan a transformation or not? "
2022,What is the game where you strike a stack of discs to knock one out?,"There was a game that appeared in a few episodes of Nichijou (not familiar with the original manga) where there was a bunch of circular (wooden?) discs stacked and a small hammer was used to try to strike one out, and I assume the object is to do so without toppling the stack.    Was this a made up game for the series or is it a real game? What is it called? "

2024,Do universe 6 saiyans transform more easily than universe 7 saiyans?,"So far we've seen 3 saiyans from universe 6 with an important role in Dragon Ball Super. In a short period of time, less than 48 hours for Kale and Caulifla if I recall correctly, and less than a year for Kyabe, they've mastered more than one transformation. Kale mastered super saiyan berserker and super saiyan green, Caulifla mastered super saiyan , ultra super saiyan (not sure if this is a state or transformation) which chances to master super saiyan 3 in the tournament according to Goku, and Kyabe mastered super saiyan and super saiyan .

2025,"Who was the first ""trap character""?","A ""trap character""(UrbanDictionary entry, may be NSFW) is a character who appears to be a girl until you get in close enough (plot-wise) to discover they are, in fact, a boy. The inverse trope exists as well; a ""reverse trap"" character is a girl who appears to be a boy.   (Note: The word trap here is not intended to be offensive, or a slur; it is only used to refer to fictional characters of this type.)  Some examples are Ruka Urushibara of Steins;Gate and Sora Kamomeya of Tsui☆Teru (pictured below):    Who was the first trap character in anime and/or manga, and what media did the trope originate from? "
2026,Why did Frieza need the second transformation?,"When Frieza transformed the first time, he said his fighting power in that transformed state was one million. But when Piccolo comes to fight Frieza, after a little while, Frieza undergoes his second transformation. What was the reason?   Was Frieza bluffing when he said his fighting power in that transformed state was one million? Did Piccolo become really very strong after his fusion with Neil that his fighting power reached to a level comparable to Frieza? Was Frieza afraid of losing, as a result of which he thought transforming would be a good option?     And then, after a few episodes, Frieza undergoes another transformation after seeing the amount of power Gohan had. So did Frieza start to panic out? "
2027,Why does Gai look like Rock Lee?,"Why does Gai-sensei and Rock Lee look almost exactly the same? Are they from the same clan or are they blood-related? Hinata and Neiji look the same and they're cousins, same with Sasori and Gaara, Sasuke and Itachi, so they're probably blood-related, or they're not? Are there any explanation regarding this? "
2028,What is the production process like for a doujinshi to be sold at Comiket?,"Are there steps for a doujinka to take when making fan-made manga that would be sold at Comiket? For example, the Comiket would be held in April. When will they start making the doujin?  Is the production process of fan-made manga similar to that of regular manga? I mean the doujinka had to like print the doujin themselves, while the mangaka don't. And they need to advertise their work. Do they have deadlines, too? What preparations do they need to make first?  Below is the timesheet of Nurarihyon no mago's author:    Do they manage the production and distribution of their fan-made manga? Or do they just print the manga and sell it? "
2029,Why is there less action anime every season?,"Why aren't there anime like Ninja Scroll anymore? Anime like Attack on Titan or One Punch Man came out and they were huge hits. But then each season, anime studios do more romance and slice of life animes.  With shows like Bleach, Naruto and One Piece, why are studios so hesitant to make an action anime series? "
2030,Why there are some American movie characters on the Tokyo ESP anime?,"If I remember correctly, on the episode 3 of Tokyo ESP, the Ghostbusters appeared trying to capture the flying penguin. Also, Murasaki's dad is clearly King Leonidas from the movie 300, and when Murasaki uses her powers on her dad's nunchaku, she was imitating Bruce Lee.    I found these references very funny, but I was wondering: why they added American movie characters on the anime? Did it also happened on the manga?  "
2031,Are the chosen anime within Welcome To The N.H.K. of any significance?,"In the anime of Welcome To the NHK, the show that is constantly played nextdoor is Puru Puru Pururin.    We know this character is not from a real show (although it has a website alluding to this), so it's not an external influence.  In the manga, an Ojya the witch is mentioned, along with lyrics from the relevant show:     Please give me the courage in my heart to help me fold away this carpet of sadness and discover the me inside,      Oh yes, the delicate heart of a lady,      Just look in my eyes and tell me you love me,      It's like a fairy tail      ...   Do we know if this is an actual show? If so, is it of any relevance?  In the light novel, the show that is played constantly is Ojamajo Doremi (or Magical DoReMi in English) and a life-size figurine is introduced from Martian Successor Nadesico      Yamizaki declares that the figurine is God and tries to convince Satou to worship it.      Do the choice of these shows have any significance?  Are there any (rough) similarities in plot to Welcome to the NHK?  TL;DR - Do we know the show that was in the manga, Do the shows in the light novel have any meaning or were they just chosen arbitrarily?  "
2032,What is the theme of Glasslip anime?,"I don't get what the theme of the story is. Although I can follow the romance aspect of the anime, I don't get what the story is trying to tell us.  It may have been due to Glasslip being the first original anime that P.A. Works has made. Other series (which are adaptations) were not so confusing, and some were successful at sending their message to the viewer. Hanasaku Iroha was about self-discovery. Nagi no Asukara was centered around ""Love brings people together"".  So what was the theme of Glasslip? What is the story trying to tell us? "
2033,Knowledge of Gear 4th through the world,"In the chapter 882 of One Piece (""Beyond the Expectations of a Yonkou"")      We see Luffy at the moment he'll use his Gear 4th, trapped in the Flowing Mochi, and his opponents reacts in this way:    This assumes that he has knowledge of both Luffy's Gear 4th technique and the mecanism to activate it. However, Luffy never mentionned it in his fight against him, so it is the first time he sees both Luffy and his technique.  How so ? Is it something that is known over Devil Fruit users, and everyone who ate them has ""gears"" like Luffy ? "
2034,Is there symbolism behind the language choices in Bleach?,"In Bleach, different languages are used by or to represent different groups. For example, the Bount spells are all in German. Many of the terms referring to/for Hollows are Spanish (e.g. Hueco Mundo, Las Noches). ""Pluses"" (整 (プラス)) is also an English word, or based on one. Is there any symbolism behind the languages used? For example, ""pluses"" are benign spirits in the human world while both Hollows and Bounts are bad. Does this have a historical or cultural coincidence or were these just randomly chosen languages? "
2035,What happened to Goku's Nyoibou and Kinto'un?,"Goku used to have a magical flying cloud (Kinto'un) and an extending staff (Nyoibou). Later on in the series (I think at DB-Z second half, but I am not sure), they were not shown on-screen anymore.  Considering the whole Dragon Ball series (DB-Z, DB-GT, etc)...  What happened to them? Were they destroyed, gifted, lost, stolen, or just hung out to dry? "
2036,What happens to a series after its author dies?,"As most of us know by now Daisuke Satō passed away. However, the series he worked on such as HOTD is yet to announce its discontinuation and thus remains on an indefinite hiatus.  This however made me wonder, what will happen to a series when the author passes away?  Will the franchise pick the series up with another mangaka instead? Silently let it linger on 'publishing' as memento? Discontinue it after a XXX amount of time? Or does this differ from publisher to publisher? Or maybe even mangaka to mangaka?  In the case of HOTD it already was on an extended hiatus, and the same thing could just happen to Yoshihiro Togashi, the author of Hunter x Hunter, as he is in quite bad health as well. But Eiichiro Oda, the author of One Piece, could also be next. In which case supposedly nobody knows the ending besides Oda himself and the diseased Hinati Fujinami. "
2037,"Does the ""flower's name"" myth have a real-world basis?","In episode 6 of Poyopoyo Kansatsu Nikki, several stray kittens suddenly turn up at Moe's house, and her family nurses them until they can find a foster home. They also decide to give names to the kittens.  So, Moe suggests they name the kittens after flowers. Hide, her brother, replies that he thinks death comes sooner to those who have a flower's name.    I've never heard this legend before; even Moe seems surprised (replying, ""Do they?""). Is this based on a real legend (Japanese or otherwise), or is Hide misinformed? "
2038,Why did Light want to kill Near?,"In Episode 37/Chapter 106, Light wants to kill Near. But what was his plan? Why did he want to kill Near? Was this because he was angry and wanted to kill the one who was responsible for his capture?  "
2039,Is Ryuk the only one who can kill Light?,"   Only a god of death that has passed on their Death Note to a human is   able to kill the owner of the Death Note**   This confuses me, because Light was able to kill Jack Neylon and Higuchi (although he wrote Higuchi's name on a paper from his notebook, so that maybe explains how he could have killed him). So, what does this rule exactly mean? Does this rule mean that if I write Light Yagami's name in a Death Note, he wouldn't die, since only Ryuk can kill him? "
2040,"What exactly is Nanoha's ""dead"" expression?","According to this Wikia page, where it discusses the difference between TV and DVD:     One of the most notable differences is the change of Nanoha's infamous ""dead"" expression when casting Crossfire Shoot on Teana in StrikerS to a more disappointed one.   When I bought the DVD Set which had all 3 series and the 2 movies from eBay, I assumed it was the proper Japanese DVDs. However, given how often the subtitles change fonts and how the translation of the names and terminologies changes in later episodes, it's obvious the seller made the copies from fansubs.  That being said, I am unsure if the episode I saw were ones from the DVD release or the Japanese television release.  So I am wondering, what is Nanoha's ""dead"" expression? How does it compare to her disappointed one? And why would it be changed? "
2041,What music was Kousei playing in the first episode?,"Right after the OP on the first episode, 11 year-old Kousei is shown playing the piano.    What music is he playing? Is this an existing music, or was it something made for the series? "

2043,"Are a lot of butlers named ""Sebastian""?","In Lucky Star, Konata calls Shiraishi, one of her classmates (and co-host of Lucky Channellu), Sebastian, apparently because he looks like a stereotypical butler.

2046,Why is the Tiger/German Suplex wrestling move so popular among anime culture?,"I see a lot of fan art that depict this move (even though nothing of the sort happens from the show/series where the characters came from) and even in Nichijou we have the school principal giving a deer a tiger suplex:    Shuichi drops a suplex in Gravitation  GTO dishes one out  Episode 87 of Gintama is: ""Perform a German Suplex On a Woman Who Asks If She or the Job Is More Important""  From Lagrange, the mechas do one:   And all the endless fanart:          Why is this so popular? Is this because wrestling is popular in Japan? But why this specific move? "
2047,What's up with the huge iron in FLCL?,"I think FLCL was a lot of fun, but I also found it really hard to follow sometimes.  For instance, what's up with the huge iron?  It's big, and it ejects steam at least once in the series, and it probably comes from aliens.  But why is it there?  What is it for?   "

2049,Why doesn't Trunks sense Cell when Cell uses Solar Flare just before absorbing android 18?,"After Vegeta lets the incomplete Cell go to absorb Android 18, Trunks attempts to stop Cell. When trying to escape Trunks' onslaught and get closer to Android 18, the incomplete Cell used the Solar Flare technique to blind Trunks and the others.  Solar Flare is a good technique to be used when the fighter attempts a quick getaway. However, in this case, Cell is still in the same area and it is made obvious that he attempts to absorb Android 18. Why can't Trunks sense Cell's energy level at this point? Why can't he sense Krillin's energy level to judge where Cell will end up going and prevent Cell's completion? "
2050,Who set Yuuko's sphere of allowable interference?,"In xxxHolic and Tsubasa, Yuuko says that there are certain things that she can do within her sphere of allowable interference such as     sending the original Syaoran to where the clone and the rest of them are.

2051,Why wasn't Guren reincarnated by Kabuto?,"Guren was a powerful, I mean crystal release? She was arguably stronger than the Sound Four. WHy didn't Kabuto bring her back to life when he was the one that killed her? He had her DNA. "

2053,How is Akai Ito the sister game to Aoishiro?,"According to VNDB (for both Aoishiro and Akai Ito) and the Manga Updates page for Aoishiro - Kaeishou, Akai Ito is the sister game to Aoishiro.  From what I can tell, they are both Shoujo Ai/Yuri titles, both done by Success and both seem to focus on Oni. However I can't see how those elements would make Aoishiro and Akai Ito sister games.  So I am wondering, is there some sort of connection between the 2? "

2057,What's the significance of apples in the OP?,"In the OP for the Denki-gai anime, it seems that apples are the main theme. Not only is the song called ""Kajirikake no Ringo"" (A Half-Bitten Apple), but apples are also seen several times:         I don't remember anything apple-related in the manga, so I'm assuming this is no reference to something that has happened there. What's the significance of the apples? "
2058,What is the first ever produced anime and manga?,"What is the first anime ever produced in Japan?  And what is the first anime film and first anime series produced?  I heard that it was Astro Boy, is that true? And what is the first ever manga produced in Japan? "
2059,What happened to the rest of the Academy class?,"In Naruto, when the academy classes are shown in the beginning, there are characters who appear who do not appear as genin later, as far as I can tell. The two characters in the second row on the right don't seem to show up later. What happens to these characters? Naruto is presented as one of the only characters to repeatedly fail, so are these characters who passed and then just never showed up again, or do they drop out of becoming ninjas?   "
2060,Did Rock Lee learn the Leaf Dragon God?,"It seemed that Master Chen refused to teach Lee the Leaf Dragon God.  Later on in the series, it appears that Lee was able to use the move anyway. How is this possible? Did he learn it from somewhere else? And is this move part of Lee's cannon? Or is just me getting filler mixed up with cannon? "
2061,Does it make sense that Knuckle has a mascot as an emitter?,"Knuckle Bine is listed as being a natural emitter but I am having difficultly reconciling that with his main power. As an emitter, the most difficult class for him to master is the conjuration and then (ignoring specialisation) transmutation.  His ability is to donate (sure you could call it emit) his Nen into another fighter. That Nen will gain interest until it reaches a point where it can force the other fighter into zetsu for 30 days.  The difficult thing to reconcil is that this Nen takes the shape of an indestructable mascot and has very unusual properties following very exact rules.  The creation of a physical manifestation is conjuration.  This creature appears to be made of Nen which means it wouldn't actually be a physical object (transmutation). These kinds of contracts/rule-following abilities seem to be tied to conjuration as well.  I could even buy that he is using manipulation to control the other person's Nen to force Zetsu.  Why is he labelled as an emitter?  Is his main ability emission or is he using a different type than his natural?  Do other emitters have such unusual Nen properties? (maybe the other ones I'm familiar with are just odd?) "
2062,Why do rich people laugh like they do in anime?,"I've found that whenever an evil rich character laughs in anime they raise their hands to their mouth and let out a 'ohohoho' or similarly annoying laugh.    Where does this mannerism come from? I can now tell someone is rich if they have this style of laugh, but that's because of association rather than understanding  There seems to be a YouTube user called ohohojuo-sama which posts lots of these [website]"
2063,What are Reiju's powers,"In the Wholecake island arc, Reiju was able to suck out poison from Luffy's body. How come? Wasn't Impel Down's Magellan the one who ate the Poison-Poison fruit? So what are Reiju's powers? "

2068,"How does Trigun Maximum relate to its predecessors, the Trigun anime and manga?","A few years ago, my friend and I watched the Trigun anime, and I've just now picked up Trigun Maximum omnibus #1. I haven't read the original Trigun manga.  We have become totally confused trying to understand how Trigun Maximum relates to the original manga and anime. I've heard mixed explanations: that Maximum is a re-imagining of the story, or that it's a sequel, or that it's a re-imagining of part of the events of the anime. Unfortunately I haven't found a clear explanation on Wikipedia or the Trigun wikis.  So, my question is: What is Trigun Maximum's relation to the original manga and anime?  Is it a sequel, or a re-imagining, or both? To what extent does it overlap or follow on from its predecessors? "
2069,Can you protect People with the Death Note by writing their name in it?,"A person whose name is written in a death note is immune to all other death notes. Are they immune to a bullet to the head or eating an arsenic cream pie, too? If so, would they have a sort of ""luck shield"" that stops any potential causes of death from making it impossible to fulfill the death note entry, or would they just survive it? "
2070,What song is Kyoko dancing to in Puella Magi / Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica?,"I've just been re-watching Puella Magi Madoka Magica / Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica (episodes, movie, doesn't change this situation). I noticed a song that sounded quite nice, that Kyoko was dancing to (playing Dance Dance Revolution, if you're happy to go by that name) in the 6th episode, or at 1:20:25 roughly, during the first movie. I'd like to make it clear that I am referring to the first song she dances to, not the second. I am well aware that the second song is Connect by ClariS.  The scene can be found at this link. It starts right near the beginning. What is this song / tune? Does anyone know the name, artist, or what it is from, if it is known outside of Madoka Magica?  Thanks in advance, "
2071,"What is the ""foreign"" language that is used in Suisei no Gargantia?","In Suisei no Gargantia, Led (and his civilization) speak a different language from the one spoken on Earth.  Depending on the point-of-view, one side speaks Japanese, and the other side speaks the foreign language. Occasionally they switch when the point-of-view shifts to the other side.  Examples:   When Led is talking to Chamber, they speak in Japanese. Dialog coming from everyone else is in the foreign language. When Pinion confronts Led in the hanger, he and Amy speak Japanese, while Led speak the foreign language.     UTW-Vivid subtitles these as symbols that don't look like any real language.  Obviously, they don't actually switch languages. It's only done to emphasize a language barrier that the characters experience.    But in any case, what is this foreign language that they are speaking?  Is it a real language, or just something made up? "
2072,What causes the androids to realize their sentience?,"In the series, it's hinted that something in the cafe Time of Eve causes the robots to develop or realize human-like sentience, even outside of the cafe.   While it's implied that they always had sentience, but was suppressed, as seen in the THX story arc. What caused their sentience to manifest and overcome such suppression?   Was it something that they've always had and something in the cafe ""triggered"" it (like removing a limiter), or was something added to their programming?    "
2073,What was the motive for kidnapping Eri in the 1st episode of Railgun season 2?,"In the first episode of Railgun season 2, Erii Haruue gets kidnapped.    But why? What did they want with Erii?  Does it have something do to with the level 6 experiment from the first season? "
2074,Is The Legend of Korra anime?,"I saw a comment online that stated The Legend of Korra is not anime. I kinda know the argument in that ""anime"" refers to only Japanese animation, but is that so? The style of this anime, the humour, and everything about it seems extremely anime. I understand that it was written by Americans and animated in Korea.  Is The Legend of Korra seriously not considered anime because of this?   Am I going to have to categorize this into an alternate genre type, so that I can add Archer and Futurama? Is there a genre type for these types of animations like with ""shoujo"", ""shounen"", ""seinen"", and ""josei""?  "
2075,Why do the characters in Akatsuki no Yona have Korean names?,"When I watch the anime and hear the names of the characters (Soo-won, Son Hak), I thought that the manga is written by a Korean and published in Japan - like in the case of Freezing.  I couldn't have been more wrong to assume that. When I check Akatsuki no Yona on mangaupdates, it was written by Kusanagi Mizuho, whose profile suggests that he is a native Japanese.  Foreign names are common in Japanese manga. It's very common to introduce a foreigner (main character or not) to join the rest of the Japanese cast. Apart from those cases, we have stories where the setting is in a land foreign to Japan, or in an alternate universe where the names of the character are made foreign like in the case of Akatsuki no Yona. However, in most of the manga I have read that falls into this category, the names are dominantly Western and I have never seen any other shows with all the characters having Korean names.  Why does the author go to the trouble to use Korean names for the characters? Why not Japanese? "
2076,What do the sheep dolls represent in Mayo Chiki?,"  Are these sheep dolls mascots, or do they represent something in the series? From the look of it, the blood (?) drooling from their mouths is like Sakamachi Kinjirou's nose bleed. "
2077,Why was Ueda Ryouhei appointed the head of the Yoshioka clan and not Seijuurou's son?,"I am reading the manga Vagabond. After the death of Yoshioka Denshichirou, someone named Ueda Ryouhei is appointed as the head of the family. Ryouhei then makes a decision that the school should fight Musashi near Ichijou-ji Temple outside Kyoto.  But according to an answer on History Stack Exchange, it was the 12-year-old son of Seijuurou's, Yoshioka Matashichiro, doing this. Is Ueda Ryuhei a fictional character that has replaced Yoshioka Matashichiro? If so, why did the author not show Yoshioka Matashichiro in his comic? "
2078,What is the difference between an OVA and an OAV?,"I've heard the terms OVA and OAV used interchangeably with one another, but is there a distinct difference between the two?  Do the definitions differ in Japan versus overseas? Where did the two acronyms originate? "
2079,What kind of transformation Trunks used in Dragon Ball Super when fighting Vegeta?,"In episode 54 of Dragon Ball Super (original air date, August 7):      Trunks uses some kind of transformation. After transformed SSJ2, his hair grows, electricity sparks disappear, and his muscles grow. It looks similar to the USSJ (Super Saiyan 1 third grade) but now he has short hair, so could his hair grows like if he were transforming into a SSJ3? Is this a kind of new transformation or what?  "
2080,"Who are the ""black"" and ""white"" characters?","In a TYPE-MOON Ace 7 - 10 year Anniversary interview, Nasu Kinoko, Takeuchi Takashi, Urobuchi Gen were asked a number of questions. while i was looking up for any interview about Alexander's name choice for another answer here i came acorss this (may have to expand Reference 8)     Q: Having the ""black"" one as the main character and the ""white"" one as the villain is a refreshing idea. Then, how about the red Saber (Saber Extra), who appeared in Fate/Extra?      Uro: That character is completely disconnected from the other Sabers. Personally, she looked like a female Gilgamesh to me.   Nasu: If I had written Fate/Zero, then Iskandar would have been a character like Red Saber. In my mind, I can only see Iskandar as a worthy opponent to Gilgamesh, but the Iskandar Urobuchi created was an excellent, wild, and unprecedented character that I could have never thought up. But I want to surpass him somehow, so maybe Red Saber was born out of my drive to create a different tyrant from Iskandar.   Just from the comments made by Nasu and Urobuchi i would suspect that when the question talks about ""black"" and ""white"" they mean the alternate forms of Saber-Arturia, Saber-Alter (black) and Saber-Lily (white) however i don't know any Fate/ work which has Saber-Alter as the main character and Saber-Lily as the villain.  Also i am aware of Saber of ""Black"" however because Nasu's comment i believe is talking about Saber-Nero given her reputation rather than Saber of ""Red"" i'd assume he's not talking about Fate/Apocrypha characters  I'm wondering who these ""black"" and ""white"" characters are and where they appear in the roles mentioned in the question?   Reference: Left is Saber-Alter, the right is Saber-Lily    "
2081,Is it possible for one Master to have multiple Servants?,"I'm reading the Fate/Stay Night visual novel. Early on, in the Kotomine Church, you can reach a bad ending by choosing to have Shirou give up his Command Spells and withdraw from the Holy Grail War as a Master. He goes outside to sever his contract with Saber, who says that normally she would kill a Master who abandoned her. Shirou asks if she'll form a contract with another Master, and Saber says that Archer's Master (Rin Tousaka) should be able to bring out her full power. Upon parting with Shirou, she goes into the church, presumably to form a contract with Rin.   Also, in the 2006 Studio Deen Fate/Stay Night anime (I haven't reached this far yet in the visual novel, but I assume it's similar),       Kirei Kotomine commands both Zero Archer (Gilgamesh) and Stay Night Lancer (Cu Chulainn). I assume he was officially the Master of at least Lancer, since unlike Gilgamesh, Lancer would have required a contract to stay in the world.    But I can't remember if it was ever stated that he is the official Master of both, or if       Gilgamesh was maintaining his existence with his own mana, and just stuck with Kirei for his own reasons.   We do know that it's possible for a Servant to have two Masters, as, for a time, both       Kayneth and Sola-Ui are Masters to Lancer    in Fate/Zero. But are the scenarios above instances of Masters with two Servants? Would Rin have been able to make a contract with Saber while also maintaining a contract with Archer, or was Saber relying on her knowledge that Rin wanted her as a Servant, and would cut off Archer if Saber became available? Was       Kirei the Master of both Archer and Lancer, or only of Lancer, with Archer a free agent?   If the answer is yes, do we know how the situation with Command Spells works? I assume this isn't a problem for       Kirei, as he gained all the leftover Command Spells from previous wars when he found his father dying from Kayneth's bullet in Fate/Zero.   But would Rin have gotten an extra three Command Spells if she made a contract with Saber, or would she have to save the one she had left as a sign of her control over both Saber and Archer?  I'm still early into the visual novel, and I haven't yet seen the last four episodes of Fate/Zero, so please use spoiler tags as needed. "
2082,Why is Erza able to feel pain during Kyouka's fight?,"   Don't read the question below if you are not up-to-date to the Fairy Tail manga. It may contain spoilers   In the chapter 399-400 from Fairy Tail manga, Erza is fighting Kyouka to stop faces's activation.  During this fight, Kyouka used her curse to increase Erza's sensitivity to pain.    After this curse, she used another one to remove all Erza's five senses. But Erza continued to fight.     One of the five senses is tactile perception. Without it, she should not be able to feel anything, including pain. Shouldn't it make Kyouka's first curse useless?  But somehow Erza continued feeling a lot of pain and suffering a lot.    How can she feel this amplified pain since all her senses were stolen? "
2083,"Why is ""Puella Magi"" equivalent to ""Mahou Shoujo""?","From my understanding, Mahou Shoujo = Magical Girl as the latter is normally used when turning the Japanese title to English, i.e.   Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha = Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha Sasami: Mahō Shōjo Club = Sasami: Magical Girls Club Mahou Shoujo Lalabel = Lalabel the Magic Girl   Now, I understand one of the themes of Puella Magi Madoka Magica is Magical Girl, and its Japanese name is Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica. I am wondering how did Mahou Shoujo become Puella Magi? "
2084,What happens if a person can't die of a heart attack?,"What would happen if a person wasn't able to die of a heart attack since they use a pacemaker or are connected to medical equipment that pumps blood for them?

2086,Are the varied non-monster species on Gaia a result of Terran Souls replacing Gaian ones?,"in Final Fantasy IX, Gardland uses Soulcage to separate Gaian and Terran souls from the soul circulation process with Gaian Souls being stopped and ejected out of Iifa's roots as mist while Terran Souls are allowed to continue with the process.  Now obviously replacing every Gaian Soul with a Terran Soul in the process is a long process which is why Garland needed Kuja and Zidane to create conflict to speed it up, however the process has been going on for thousands of years and according to the wiki Terran flora and fauna are already showing up     1000 years ago Garland placed the Soul Divider at the Iifa Tree's base to discard the Gaian souls and replace them with Terran ones, thus slowly restoring Terra. Terran flora and fauna began reviving on Gaia as it was finally recovering from the destruction that happened in the wake of the failed Fusion. The discarded Gaian souls were sent off through the tree-roots to the continent where, by this time, a civilization had formed.   Soruce: Terra > Story  > 1000 years ago - The Terran souls begin their restoration (First Paragraph)  and in Gaia we have other species such as the Burmecian like Freya and Puck and whatever species Baku and Doctor Tot are.  So i am wondering, are the varied non-monster species on Gaia a result of Terran Souls replacing Gaian ones? like say some of the species on Gaia at the moment of the game are actually Terran species? if so what species (or people) are actually Terran? (Excluding the obvious, Kuja, Zidane, Garland and Mikoto) "
2087,What is the Ash-Greninja form of Greninja?,"This new form of Greninja is circulating around. I am not following the anime or the movies so please try to be gentle if it was obvious.  What exactly is this Greninja? If it's a mega-evolution, how did it get there without a stone? How exactly does his powers/abilities/skills vary from other normal Greninja?  I know the physical difference, that it starts to resemble Ash a bit. Easily noticeable is the red middle part on his head instead of the body blue.  This is the normal Greninja:     And this is Ash's:     "

What is song played when Ken is being tortured on seaons 1 episode 12?      What is the song in Tokyo Ghoul with the discordant piano?   My question is about the atonal music played during Rize and Kaneki's dialogue and his torture in season 1 episode 12 from roughly 0:00–13:13, not ""Rize's Melody"" / Original Sorrow"", which starts at 14:00 after 40 seconds without music. What's this atonal music called? Is it released or named?  It evidently isn't ""Unravel"", and it does not feature strings as much as ""Die Verwandlung"". I have gone through the two OST disks and not found it.     Ost list 1   Ost list 2   "

2093,Is Yonezawa Sachiko inspired by Misawa Sachika?,"In Joukamachi no Dandelion, there is a character named Yonezawa Sachiko (aka ""Sacchan""). There also exists a real human being named Misawa Sachika. Observe the following:    Sachiko is voiced by Sachika. Their names are curiously similar, sharing three of five characters - 米澤紗千子 vs. 三澤紗千香. Sachiko is an idol. While I don't know that I would characterize Misawa as an ""idol"", per se, she is a skilled vocalist, and certainly strikes me as the idol ""type"" of voice actress. Sachiko has something of a resemblance to Sachika (though, granted, this is not a hugely uncommon look for a young Japanese woman to have):  　   This leads me to wonder: was Sachiko inspired in some way by Sachika? Chronologically, it's feasible - Joukamachi has only been in print since June 2012, by which point, Sachika had already debuted (in 2008) and had her first major voice-acting role (Kuroyukihime in Accel World, in spring 2012).   Has the author of the manga (or, for that matter, Sachika herself) commented on this?   (Wikipedia claims that this is indeed the case; however, I would like to see some kind of citation if possible. Twitter, a manga afterword, whatever.) "
2094,Is it possible to have absolute obedience using Death Note?,"We've seen Light completely manipulating the robber in the bus-accident case (in which he figured out the identity of the FBI stalker). At the end, though the robber died, but everything went according to the book or in other words the robber was completely manipulated.   So my question is, is it possible for Light to gain absolute obedience over the victim without killing him? If so, why doesn't he utilizes this power?   One possible way to gain absolute obedience is to write a task for the person and make the person's death to occur after a long period (say fifty years) "
2095,How much does the spider-girl show up in MonMusu?,"I watched the first episode of Monster Musume no Iru Nichijou. It was a thrilling experience. However, it came to my attention that one of the monster girls is, in fact, a spider-girl. My tolerance for invertebrates - and in particular, for those with too many legs - is very low. So I stopped watching MonMusu.   In order to help me evaluate whether I will be able to tolerate watching the rest of the show, I would like to know how much the spider-girl appears in the show. Answer this however you would like; some parameters that would interest me are:   When does she first appear? (i.e. are the first n episodes safe to watch?) Is the show structured so that each girl gets her own block of episodes (like an ""omnibus"")? If so, which episodes are the spider-girl's episodes? (so I can avoid them) If not, is the show structured in any other way that makes it easy to avoid the parts in which she appears? (e.g. multiple clearly delineated segments per episode?) Roughly what fraction of the show following her first appearance has her appearing on-screen?  "
2096,How tall is Vice Admiral Smoker?,"How tall is Vice Admiral Smoker?  I've used Wikia as a reference. They have the most information out there by a long shot. The heights of various characters are usually shown there.  Another resource that is useful is the SBS, perhaps it's stated on there? "
2097,When does Kud Wafter fit into the story?,"Kud Wafter is a spinoff of the original Little Busters! visual novel in which Kud is the main heroine. When, in the timeline, does it occur? Is it after Kud's route, or an alternative to Kud's route (i.e. after the common route) or in some other place in the story (e.g. after Refrain)? Of course, the name is a pun on ""Wafu"" (which Kud says frequently) and ""After"", but that alone doesn't seem to answer the question of how it fits into the main story.   "
2098,What is Marisa doing underground with a device on her back?,"  There is an unusual scene in the opening of ""The Memories of Phantasm"", in which we see Kirisame Marisa with some kind of measurement or detection device on her back.

2099,How is Sajin Komamura a wolf?,"Sajin Komamura is described as being an anthropomorphic wolf in the Wikipedia article, but everyone in the Soul Society is either someone who died or the descendant of someone who died.

2100,Could Hidan possibly get out of his hole?,"I'm just wondering, in the episode where Hidan lost his head against the Konoha jounin, which he killed eventually (forgot the name). There is a scene where he lost his head, and his body is still moving, looking for the head. Until Kakuzu stitched Hidan's head to his body. Then in the scene where Shikamaru buried him, Hidan is literally disconnected with his body (or did some of his parts even get vaporized?) But his head is still working. Supposing his body parts could still move on its own regardless if they are not connected with a central nervous system, could Hidan ""chew"", ""claw"", ""divide"" his way out of the hole? and then from some bit make himself whole again? His becoming whole again would incur maybe centuries, lets just say that somehow his tissues would become whole again over time. The topic would be, if he could get out of the mound which Shikamaru created from him. "

2105,Is Nishikyougoku Ramuko a word play of Toushinou Kyouko?,"When writing doujinshi, Toushinou Kyouko goes by the pseudonym Nishikyougoku Ramuko. Now, her name Toushinou Kyouko is written as 歳納京子. I'm not sure how her pseudonym is written since I wasn't able to find the original spelling for that name, but I think it would use the Kyou from Kyouko（京）in Nishikyougoku and Ko from Kyouko（子）in Ramuko. The first Nishi that I think of is（西）which means West, and the first goku I can think of is（国）which means Kingdom/Country. Thus, it would be somewhat a word play of her own name since Tou（東）in Toukyou（東京）means East.  Now, it is quite common for writers to use pen name that is similar to his/her real name and is related to him/her somehow. An example for this would be Joanne Rowling whose pen name was J. K. Rowling with the K. taken from her paternal grandmother's name, Kathleen. Another example would be the writer Saito Satoshi whose born name was Saito Tomohiro, more commonly known under his stage name as actor, Hiro Mizushima which uses the same Saito as in his real name. An example from another anime would be Kousaka Kirino whose pen name was Rino.  Which brings me to the question, is Nishikyougoku Ramuko really a play of her real name Toushinou Kyouko? Is my guess above correct (about the Nishikyougoku part)? What about the Ramuko part? "
2106,"Why does Ruriko get angry when she's called as ""Rurippe""?","Why does Ruriko get angry whenever Shun calls her as ""Rurippe"" when according to this,      'Rurippe' holds no real meaning except that Shun relates it to her   childhood appearance as a sniveler (or one who always has a runny   nose).   How does Shun relate this nickname to Ruriko as a sniveler? Is it because of how it is written in kanji or how the nickname is pronounced?  "
2107,How long did it take Meowth to learn to speak?,"I watched the episode where Meowth is telling his story. Aside from that, I read several threads where it was stated that he cannot learn any moves and he might be level 100 but is weak due to not fighting when he should have been.  The question is: how long it did it take him to learn to speak the human language? Is this possible to answer? "
2108,What was the concert program for Symphogear Live 2012?,"Symphogear Live 2012 - the concert for the first season - was, sadly, not officially videotaped. This being the case, I would be very interested to know what the program for the concert was. In particular:   What was the set list? (i.e. which songs were performed? Given the relatively limited number of Symphogear songs in existence as of the end of season one - 13, by my reckoning - I would hope the answer is ""all of them"".) Did the concert feature any segments of particular interest aside from the vocal performances? (talk segments and so forth, say)  "
2109,When/Why did Nagi move out of her mansion and into the apartments in the anime?,"In the first episode of the 4th season (Hayate no Gotoku! Cuties), Nagi is shown living in the apartment building with all of her friends.   (You can't really tell this is the apartments from the screenshot, but note the rather plain looking Japanese-style room compared to her Western-style room in her mansion which definitely had a fancy bed rather than a futon)  When did she move out of her mansion and into the apartments in the anime? I don't remember this happening.  And is there a reason she moved?  Update: In the following episodes, she is shown back in her mansion sometimes as well. This would imply that the current anime season is not fully following the manga which is why I have not accepted the answers giving manga-based answers.   "
2110,Are items that are gained during evolution part of the Pokemon?,"Pokemon such as Mankey and Abra gain items after evolution. Primeape has metal rings around its wrists and ankles, and Kadabra gets a spoon. What I'm confused about is that Braixen gains an item during evolution as well, the stick on its tail, but in the anime it is shown that Serena's Braixen broke her stick and found a replacement afterwards. So are the items gained during evolution part of the Pokemon? If not, does it count as a held item? "
2111,Where did the mecha genre originate from in Japan?,"I was wondering where mecha genre in Japan originated. It doesn't seem the same as something like the idea of a doll having a soul, which is from Japanese folk beliefs, but it could be.   Is there some historical basis for giant fighting robots (or similar things) in Japan? If not, where did they originate from, and what was the first series that showed them? "
2112,Who are the Heroes that Sweet Mask acknowledged?,"I saw an interesting question: How does Sweet Mask (A-Class rank 1) plan to stop unworthy heroes from moving to S-Class?  My question is, at the moment, who are the Heroes that Sweet Mask acknowledged as worthy Heroes? Are the Heroes he acknowledged all S-Class Heroes only? "
2113,When do you classify an AMV as an ASMV?,"As the name 'Anime Story Music Video' explains, an AMV which contains a story is considered as an ASMV. But when do you declare something as a story?  Is it necessary to have speeches in the video? If yes, to what extent? Do they have to underlay the very majority of the whole AMV or is it ok if they underlay only 1/4th of it?  Do the speeches have to link each other directly or do they only have to contain the same emotions (e.g. desperation)?  Here're a few examples of AMVs which could be considered as an ASMV:   This video is definitely an ASMV: [website]This one starts its speeches after 53 sec. and these speeches only deliver the same emotions (they're not directly linked to each other if I understood it correctly): [website]This one has no speeches at all, but it tells us a story only with the compositing of anime scenes and the music: [website]"
2114,What does this Treaty have to do with Ecchi Girls?,"In an email I got from JList talking about ""ecchi girls"" (their blog post), it talks about a Treaty of San Francisco     Then there's one of the most entertaining character types, the ecchi girl who can't think of anything besides sex, which -- in accordance with the 1951 Treaty of San Francisco -- must always be paired with a dull-witted male main characters who's unwilling or unable to take her up on her offers.   What exactly is this treaty? and does it really have so much control over anime in which all ""ecchi girls"" have to be paired with dull male character? "
2115,What happens to Obito after the 5 minutes of intangibility?,"Obito is intangible. This intangibility last for 5 minutes. After 5 minutes, what happens? I am confused. Or does  he needs  to keep phasing  through  objects  to remain  intangible? "
2116,"What's Hearts race/species, demon, alien or what?","So in the Core Area Warriors you have several race/species. A god (Zamasu) , a saiyan (Cumber) , 2 alien artificial life forms, possibly androids (Oren and Kamin), and above all of them , their leader Hearts. Which race/species is he supposed to be? Is he a demon, an alien or what? "
2117,What would happen if you caught a PokeBall with another PokeBall?,"Consider the following scenario: A trainer is trying to catch a rare or strong Pokemon, and figures that catching it in a PokeBall will have a low likelihood of actually catching and containing it.   What would happen if, after the trainer threw the first PokeBall and before the wild Pokemon breaks free, the trainer hit the occupied PokeBall with a second PokeBall? Would the both the original PokeBall and the wild Pokemon be ""caught"" by the second PokeBall? Would the wild Pokemon just be transferred from the first PokeBall to the second PokeBall? Would this double the likelihood that the Pokemon will be caught, due to the fact that it has to break out of two balls instead of one?   If the PokeBalls can be ""layered,"" and the probability that you catch a Pokemon increases with how many PokeBalls you can layer on it, could you not just keep layering PokeBalls until you reach the strength of a Great or Ultra Ball?  We already know that inanimate objects and things other than Pokemon can be ""caught"" by PokeBalls, as evidenced by this question.  "
2118,Waiting in the Summer and Onegai Sensei seem to plagiarise each other. Is this normal in anime/manga?,"Waiting in the Summer and Onegai Sensei have TONS of things in common:   Luscious Redhead Alien Main Romantic Interest? Check. Is she a Meganekko (warning: TV Tropes) even though her advanced alien civilization surely can fix the need for glasses? Check. Mature demeanor indicating a slightly older woman? Check. Works as a neutral observer on Earth? Check. Cannot get into a relationship with natives due to alien regulations and job specifications? Check.    Likes to look candidly over the shoulder while holding arms stiff against the back so to enhance the ""natural attributes"" during the show OP? CHECK!   Almost kills the MC during the first episode due to crappy piloting re-entry skills? Check. Saves the life of MC after the crash? Check.   Strange critter that doubles as the spaceship control interface? Check. Critter has the ability to teleport said alien redhead on demand? Check.    Lolita manipulator that seems to know everything behind the scenes? Check. Secondary ""death flagged"" romantic interest that never stands a chance against the aforementioned hot redhead alien? Check. Redhead is forcefully removed from Earth for breaking alien law? Check. Japanese countryside (almost rural) setting? Check. Character design by Taraku Uon? Check. Manga serialized by Media Works? Check.   I really felt deja vu all the time.  Is it common to repack almost the same story, setting and characters into another series?    I already told how the series are almost a copy of one another, I want to know how common is it to repack the same basic storyline and sell it again.  If the two series are in the same world is stuff for another question: What proof do we have that Waiting in the Summer and Onegai Sensei (and Twins by proxy) are set in the same Earth? "
2119,What is the song that Drocell sings?,"In Kuroshitsuji, they often sing a song that ends on ""my fair lady,"" see here.  It sounded really familiar to a song that I've heard before in several other languages, but I can't find the name or the origin of this song.   What is the name of this song? "
2120,What was the first anime/manga/light novel to accurately represent Japanese school life?,"A common theme in a number of anime/manga/light novels is that the cast are students currently going to school. While some titles use this as a backdrop to show how the cast used to have normal lives before they made to fight in conflicts against aliens/monsters/gods/the military, there are some which just show the cast's daily life in school.  I am wondering: what were the first anime, manga and light novel to accurately represent Japanese school life? Did they ever get any adaptations? "
2121,Does Saitama have enhanced senses?,"So Saitama jumped and appeared at King's apartment in floor 22th. How did he know King was there? Does Saitama have enhanced vision, hearing or something? "
2122,What did Guy say in his fight vs Madara?,"If you have seen the English subbed version of Naruto Shippuden, then you probably remember the word ""Flow!!!"" that Might Guy said just before using Night Guy on Madara. My question is, what does he actually say in Japanese? Using Google Translate, I get ""nagare"" as the Japanese translation of the word ""flow"". But it sounds like a one-syllable word in the show.  I think this happened in Naruto Shippuden episode 421.  Here is a clip from YouTube. "
2123,Have the creators of Tokyo Mew Mew or Sailor Moon commented on the similarities?,"There are a number of very clear parallels between Tokyo Mew Mew and Sailor Moon, beyond the fact that they're both magical girl animes. At 7:35 of this, the scene is incredibly similar to this at 00:53:10. There are other very striking similarities, like the personalities of the characters. Have the creators of either series commented on the similarities? "
2124,Why is Sanji wanted alive only?,"In One Piece manga chapter 801, all the members of the Straw Hat Crew have gotten new bounties on their heads, being shown on those wanted posters. Do you guys have any ideas as to why Sanji's poster only stated wanted: alive only? What makes him so special that the government wants him alive?   "
2125,Where do the people of Orth get their food from?,"Due to lack of land, there is no agriculture in Orth. This means that the town's food can only come from two places:  Imports/Trade  If Orth was trading relics for food, we would be seeing a constant line of ships coming and going. There would also be infrastructure in place to transport goods up and down the outside of the volcano.  Hunting/Foraging in the Abyss  In Episode 5, Riko mentions that any meat they had at the orphanage came from here, so this is the likely option. There are thousands (possibly tens of thousands) of people living on the surface. Shouldn't there be hundreds of people in the first layer every day hunting animals, catching fish and gathering fruit? How come we never see anyone other than the odd cave raider?  As much as food plays a role with our main characters, we curiously never see anyone eating on the surface. I doubt that the need to eat is tied to the Curse of the Abyss.  In a story so world-building focused, I find this to be a strange oversight (though not one that draws from my enjoyment of the show). "
2126,Can Alphonse sleep in FMA/FMA:B?,"In both Fullmetal Alchemist (2003) and Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood (2009), there are instances of Alphonse Elric saying what he can't wait to do once he gets his body back. He usually states things that only humans/living creatures can do that he cannot, such as eating and smelling.   Since sleeping is something that only humans/living creatures (i.e. - not a suit of armor) can do, does this mean that Alphonse cannot sleep? Does he just sit there all night on Ed's floor? Is this talked about/approached differently in the two shows? "
2127,What purpose does Zoro's third sword actually serve?,"Zoro has trained with Santoryu for basically his entire life, and has completely perfected it by this point. But, just from a fighting perspective, it would be quite difficult to get enough leverage/support with a sword in your teeth to actually do effective damage to anything (at least, without Haki). Unless this is just a classic case of ""this is a fantasy world with fruits that give people magical powers, so it's possible for Zoro to have a strong enough neck to use a third sword effectively"".   Most of the times we see him fighting, it's usually only with his two swords in his hands, and we barely ever actually see his third sword do anything. We often see implied strikes after he finished Oni Giri or other big finishing moves.   It seems Nitoryu would be just as effective as Santoryu in most situations.  What exactly does his third sword do in a normal fight, that is so important for his style to hinge on it? Did the third sword become more useful in normal combat after the timeskip (not including the use of Haki, because if that was included, obviously it would be more useful), or is it still basically the same? "
2128,Can the Law of the Cycle destroy itself?,"Could Madoka ever accumulate despair, or does her Soul Gem stay pure forever? According to Kyubey, she takes the despair away from magical girls about to become witches. If her Soul Gem became tainted, she could potentially become a witch and destroy herself (through her wish). Would that even be possible?? "
2129,"In season 2, how did Koichi manage to obtain Aoi Tsunemori's ear?","Note: The whole post is a spoiler.    How did Koichi come to be in possession of Aoi Tsunemori's ear?  In Episode 9 of Psycho-Pass 2, Koichi Kuwashima gave a present to Akane Tsunemori before turning himself over to MWPSB. That present was revealed to hold Aoi Tsunemori's ear.   Given the circumstances, I assumed that Koichi or Kirito Kamui and company abducted Akane's grandmother, but given Akane's reaction I suppose Aoi wasn't killed up until that time.   However, earlier in the same episode  Sakuya Togane ordered Mika Shimotsuki to determine the whereabouts of Akane's grandmother. Also, in the scene next to Akane's reaction after seeing Aoi's ear, the expressions on Togane's face implied (as I saw fit) that he was involved in that brutal act.   In the last episode, Togane had revealed that he was the one behind the brutal killing of Aoi, whose body was found in Warehouse district (not sure whether it is the same district where she was living; an earlier episode revealed that she was living in a  nursing home with considerable drones guarding the place).  All of this doesn't seem to add up to a coherent plot.   Kirito and company knew where Aoi was living and they were able to hack the drones guarding the place, as witnessed in an earlier episode. Togane came to know about Aoi's home via Mika.   Following are the two events that I suppose happened in the story but were not revealed and left to ponder:   Koichi or friends stormed the house, took away Aoi's ear, and left off. Later, Togane came and killed Aoi brutally -- too many flaws in this plot. Alternatively, Togane first reached the house, killed Aoi and left the body in Warehouse district. Koichi or friends later visited the house or the place where the body was dumped, took away the ear, and went off -- I have high hopes with this theory.   There are some theories floating in some places on web that Togane and Koichi were working together, so after finishing off Aoi, Togane handed over her ear to Koichi since both had the intention to blacken Akane's hue. This doesn't follow any logic in my opinion since Koichi remained a loyal friend of Kirito, and Kirito and Togane were enemies.  So, what really happened? Or, what is the most logical conclusion for the story? "
2130,"If the universe seed is for creating universes, why does Hearts think he can destroy the Zenos with it?","In Dragon Ball Heroes episode 9 of the anime , Hearts says that with the universe see he will destroy the Zenos. But the universe seed supposedly is for creating universes. Why did he say so? How would he use the universe seed to destroy the Zenos? "
2131,What is the most complete Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex DVD set to buy?,"I have a gift card from Best Buy and I wanted to buy Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex on DVD. But between Best Buy's website and Amazon there appear to be five box sets available. Does anyone know which version has the most content, and maybe which one's packaging is the easiest to take DVDs out of? Is there a collection that has both seasons or are they always separated? "
2132,What are the characteristics and themes present in Gundam characters based on Char Aznable?,"Across all Gundam universes, there is always at least one character based on Char Aznable from the original Gundam series. (I say ""at least one"" because sometimes there is a softer character that is less obviously based on Char.)   In Gundam Wing, the obvious Char knockoff would be Zechs Marquise; the tell-tale characteristic is the mask. He was the sister of Releena and the child of the Peacecraft family. This an obvious nod to the fact that Char was really Casval Rem Deikun, son of Zeon Dum Deikun. His sister was Artesia Rem Deikun, who took the alias Sayla and was an active member aboard White Base. Quatra is the less obvious Char clone, who shares Char's blonde hair and is named after the number 4. (Char in multiple Indian languages means four and his alias in Zeta Gundam was Lt. Quatro.) In the most recent Gundam Unicorn, Full Frontal is obviously the main Char character (many in the show itself believing him to be the famed Red Comet) while Ensign Ridhe is the softer Char character (indicated by his blonde hair, his family's ancestry, and rivalry with the main character).   The Char character usually has some kind of ""cool"" nickname; Char's is Red Comet, and Zechs has the name Lightning Count. Additionally, their mobile suit is usually colored red or white. Would this make Athuran Zala also a Char character, with his signature Red mobile suits?  Basically, what I'm wondering is: Is there a defined set of characteristics like the above mentions and their occurrences across all Gundam series (whether they be Universal Century or not)? "
2133,Who is the Seventh Sin?,I recently watched the anime but in the end I couldn't remember who the seventh sin was. He was shown as Escanor in the first episode (about 4:43). Is it possible that he isn't showing up in the anime? Or is he impersonated by someone else? 
2134,Does Lelouch vi Britannia speak with a Japanese accent?,"Jun Fukuyama obviously has a Japanese accent, and we don't necessarily know about Johnny Yong Bosch's Japanese accent from the Code Geass dub alone. Regardless, I'm talking about the character Lelouch from Code Geass, specifically when Lelouch has been masquerading as Zero from Season 1 Episode 1 until half of Season 1 Episode 12.  In Episode 12, everyone is surprised Lelouch/Zero isn't Japanese when Zero confirms Kirihara's guess (I originally watched the sub and not the dub, but I recall it went similarly in the sub, where I recall I thought 'They really thought Zero's Japanese?'). Does this mean that for the past 12 episodes, Lelouch, as Zero, had been speaking perfectly fluent Japanese with a Japanese accent, which he learned from his days with the Kururugi family and his other days in Japan thereafter probably with Sayokopter? If so, then is there any indication that he indeed had been speaking Japanese fluently with a Japanese accent? I believe that Lelouch is definitely N1 JLPT-level, but I'm not sure that means he has a Japanese accent, much like how not all fluent English speakers have an English (whether British, American, Britannian or European) accent.  My guess for the accent:   Since no one has suspected Zero is not Japanese whenever Lelouch, as Zero, has spoken Japanese publicly during the first 12 episodes, it follows that he, as Zero, must have had a Japanese accent while speaking Japanese in the first 12 episodes (and thereafter). Also, the indication may come after episode 12: If he later spoke Japanese publicly, then presumably he had a Japanese accent all along unless he had recently obtained one. Alternatively, if Lelouch, not as Zero, has a Japanese accent when speaking Japanese, then of course Lelouch, as Zero, will have a Japanese accent when speaking Japanese. Other possibilities include voice distortions like in Death Note (I don't think there was indication of this) or that Lelouch has come to mainly speak with a Japanese accent even when speaking English, as some kind of force of habit.   To compare Raye Penber from Death Note speaks Japanese, but his accent isn't Japanese, as Light pointed out. I like how the nationalities were pointed out like this even though the American characters in Death Note had their lines delivered in Japanese. Given that some other anime had addressed accents, I consider Code Geass unrealistic in this regard if Code Geass has not addressed things like this i.e. if indeed there isn't an indication of an accent, but of course, Lelouch had stayed in Japan more than Raye Penber had. "
2135,Why did Misty leave the Pokemon anime?,"I remember watching the Pokemon anime when I was a kid, and I was absolutely obsessed with Ash, Brock, Misty, and Pikachu. I remember when Brock left, and then there was Tracy, and then Brock came back. After a while, I stopped watching, but then resumed a few years later, to see that both Brock and Misty were gone, and they were replaced with May and Max (I think this is correct).  I must have missed what happened to Misty and Brock during my brief absence from the Pokemon franchise. I'll leave Brock for another question (or maybe bonus points if you know about what happened to him too), but what happened to Misty? What was her reason for leaving the original team? Separate from that reason, what was the executive reason for deleting Misty? For example, when the writing staff got rid of Brock the first time, they said it was due to his flirtatious manner, and were worried he would not be well received. Was there any reason similar to this for Misty's disappearance? Could she ever return, like Brock did?  "
2136,When did the transition from standard definition (4:3) to widescreen (16:9) for television anime happen?,"Modern television anime is produced at an aspect ratio of 16:9 - widescreen/HD. But in the past, television anime was more often produced at an aspect ratio of 4:3 - standard definition.  When did the transition from 4:3 to 16:9 for television anime happen?  Now, it's not too difficult to find isolated examples to get a sense for when the switchover was in progress. For example, Ouran High School Host Club, from spring 2006, was produced at 4:3, while Full Metal Panic! The Second Raid, from summer 2005, was produced at 16:9. Clearly, the transition was under way by 2005, but not complete by 2006. And I'm fairly confident that by 2011, all television anime were in 16:9 (Ninja Slayer notwithstanding).   But what I'm looking for is a more holistic view of how this transition happened. Who were the major players? Can we identify a clear starting date for the transition? And so forth.  "

2139,What makes an S-ranked shinobi?,"I'm not entirely sure what the criteria are that need to be met before a ninja is considered to be of S class. It looks to be some sort of combination of speed, strength, jutsu, etc. Does one additionally need some special techniques or bloodlines? Like Mangekyo Sharingan, Mokuton, Sage Mode, high class summons and/or kinjutsu? Are jonin like Kakashi Hatake and Might Guy S ranked? If so, at what point would you say they show the skills to be acknowledged as such? "
2140,What proof do we have that Waiting in the Summer and Onegai Sensei (and Twins by proxy) are set in the same Earth?,"Offshot of: Waiting in the Summer and Onegai Sensei seem to plagiarise each other. Is this normal in anime/manga?  It is said that both animes are set in the same Earth (I.E., Waiting in the Summer is a sequel of Onegai Series). While my first question addresses how common is to have two series that are almost a plagiarims of one another, this question is about these two series per se.  What evidence do we have to prove that Waiting in the Summer is indeed in the same World/Earth/Universe than Onegai Sensei, Onegai Twins? "
2141,How is it that Scanlations are still faster than Licensed releases?,"Yen Press is expected to release Volume 14 of Watatemote on September 2019    however the scanlations have already been translating Volume 14 and beyond    The above is the first page of chapter 150 that was scanlated and was uploaded to the site i got it from a month ago while the same site lists up to Chapter 152.   also said site also posted a Bookwalker special edition chapter Chapter 144.5 and this was posted 4 months ago    and as you can see in the image it says Volume 14 went on sale in January (assuming this year).  these 2 pages suggest that in Japan Volume 14 is already out and being sold. yet despite this for an official translation we have to wait 9 months for. but since Yen Press already has the licenses why does it take them so long to release when a scanlation group, which doesn't get paid and done in the group's free time (since they have lives and their jobs) can release it much faster? is this some sort of bottle neck that all licensed releases have? "
2142,Why have Fate/Zero and Fate/Apocrypha light novels not been officially translated to English?,"I've just started reading fan translations of Fate/Zero and Fate/Apocrypha light novels, but it made me wonder, why have they not been officially translated to English?  I don't know a great deal about the Fate franchise, but it seems to be increasingly popular with games and anime series and loads more content in development. There also seems to be a great deal of LNs getting published in English lately that don't have as much of a following.  Is it because they're considered old (Zero is 2006, Apocrypha is 2012) or because there's an anime adaption for both so what's the point? Was it just overlooked?  In response to the linked question:     The market for LN is really small outside Japan for a number of reasons so companies aren't interested in publishing them unless they are for very famous franchises   That's what I'm saying, is Fate not an incredibly famous and marketable franchise both in and out of Japan? A number of Fate games have English localization, most of the anime series are on Netflix USA/UK with English dubs etc, this one just seems a bit of an anomaly.   Not to mention that question is almost 6 years old, the market has grown since then with entire bookshelves of English LNs in Western stores now. Seems to me, despite profitability, Fate got skipped.  Especially considering LNs like Globlin Slayer and Rise of the Shield Hero have English translations way before they even had an anime* to market them in the West.   *December 2016 and September 2015 respectively, their anime aired Fall 2018 and Winter 2019.

Not wanting to be caught, he is unable to escape as the vault is moved into a storage room. Before he leaves, however, the girls come in and start to change, but then notice ""something white"" in the vault, and go to look.    However, the episode ends here, and episode 7 picks up in a completely different place and makes no mention of this. Was Subaru ever caught? What exactly happened here? "

After the arrow lands on his back, Xandes falls off a cliff to what I thought was his death:    However, in 19 I saw a character that looked like Xandes again:    And that was then confirmed to be him indeed:    How exactly did Xandes survive?

I'm also wondering as to who else would have known about it around that time as well (besides the obvious people like Urahara, Yuroichi, and Ichigo's father)? "
2150,Why is it that cursed children are all female?,"In the first episode of Black Bullet, it was said in the narration that all cursed children are girls. Has this been explained why in the light novel? Are the boys instantly turned into gastrea when infected by the virus or what? As far as I can tell from the 13 episodes of the anime, it wasn't explained. "
2151,Log Horizon: do some Landers know that their world used to be just a game where they were NPCs?,"Adventurers, for obvious reasons, never tell.  Landers, very conveniently, never ask - or never ask too much.  Not even the ones depicted as knowledge-hungry.  Not even when Adventurers let slip terms such as ""NPC"", ""real life/world"", ""game"", etc.  Yes, Landers can be very curious sometimes, but I don't remember hearing them asking embarassing questions about the Adventurers' world, questions that may lead to the unspokable topic. Not even Regan, Lenessia, or       Rudy.   Are there, in the Log Horizon franchise, Landers which [discovered | were told | figured out | whatever] about Elder Tale?  Do some of them know the ""uncomfortable truth""? I.e. that, in the world where Adventurers come from:   ""Adventurers"" are not ""Adventurers"" at all, they don't have special powers, they just played a game in which they killed monsters for fun, sitting on a chair and clicking buttons on a machine Theldesia is just the fictional setting of that game, where Landers are  fictional, computer-controlled characters.   It would be interesting to see how they reacted to this shocking revelation.  Note 1: I only watched the two seasons of the ""Log Horizon"" anime.  If the answer would contain spoilers for additional material, please direct me to that additional material (if it is available in English, since I don't speak Japanese).  Note 2: just realize that ""Adventures don't treat us like real people"" is necessary but not sufficient for what I'm looking for. This because realizing this is not so hard: in fact, before the Catastrophe, Adventurers did not look like real people to the Landers as well (so probably the ""Welcome to the village of Arb"" joke in season 1 episode 5 could be true also from the Landers' POV). I'm looking for at least a Lander who knows something like ""Adventures don't treat us like real people because they used to see us as fictional characters in a game, the so-called heroes were just playing make-believe to escape boredom"". This is a completely different animal.  Note 3: The fight between Papus and Elias Hackblade goes near to what I'm looking for, but I still don't think that's what I'm looking for. Papus says to Elias that he (Elias) is fictional, Elias is horrified, but it's not clear if he's horrified by the revelation, by that ugly monster or by the magic the monster he's casting on him. Anyway, Kanami treats Elias as real, but then the scene is cut and we don't know what happens next (at least in the anime). According to the wiki entry for Papus (beware of spoilers!!!), he has a special power that causes Landers to believe they are fictional. I don't care about what the Genius think about Landers, and I don't care if Landers are fictional or real people. I care if there are Landers who will believe what the Genius say, and if this will bring them to discover that Adventurers were just roleplayers, and how this will change their relationship with Adventurers. (Note that Elias is a perfect example of Lander that did not react or ask questions when Kanami and her friends used words like ""NPC"", ""playing"", ""game"", ""real life"", etc. No, I don't think he already knows the truth about Elder Tale just because he's on the Elder Tale box).

2152,Is Akaza Akari the same grade as Toshinou Kyouko and Funami Yui?,"The wikia page stated that Toshinou Kyouko is 14 years old, Funami Yui is 14, Akaza Akari is 13 and Chinatsu is 13. Chinatsu added the honorific senpai when she called Kyouko and Yui's name. However Akari who is of the same age as her did not.  Is this because Akari is close enough to Kyouko and Yui that she dropped the honorific despite being the kouhai (junior)? Or is she actually the same grade as Kyouko and Yui despite being one year younger? "
2153,Why does Sarada Uchiha wear glasses?,"In the anime, it was stated that Uchihas have the best eyes in terms of sight and visual prowess. If Uchihas have the best sight then why does Sarada Uchiha wear glasses?   I know there was the whole 'who is Sarada's mom' arc but      it was revealed that Sakura is Sarada's mom, not Karin   so then why does she have glasses? Even though her glasses are a gift, we know that she legitimately needs them (she doesn't wear them for style) and neither of her parents wear glasses.  I haven't read the manga so if there are any canon reasons as to why Sarada has glasses can you please give me the source? "
2154,Why do the English dubbed Madoka movies have a static movie menu and not an animated one like the English subbed one?,"When the Puella Magi Madoka Magica Movies first came out, they were only Japanese with English subtitles, but the DVD/Blu-ray menus were animated. I remembered that they had small clips from the movie and the background music was that of the music that plays when Sayaka turns into a witch at the end of the first movie.  When the English dubbed version of the movies came out I got them too and after watching the first 2 movies I've noticed they have a totally different menu. This time, it's just a static image, and the background music is different.  I am wondering why this is. Would it not have been easier just to use the same menu? Also, is this a common practice when an anime is first released subbed but is then later re-released dubbed that the movie menu is remade (and possibly made less dynamic/flashy in the English dub release)? "
2155,What did Izaya hire Vorona to do?,"In episode 24 of Durarara!! ×2 (the last episode of Ten), Izaya identifies himself to Vorona as one of her previous clients.   What did Izaya actually hire Vorona to do?   It was Yodogiri who hired her and Slon to abduct Awakusu Akane, and I don't seem to recall having been told who hired them to attack Anri (and in any case, I don't see what Izaya's motive for having Anri killed would be, though his motives are admittedly a little bit opaque at times). Am I forgetting something? "
2156,Is there any clarification from the publisher/author of Hunter x Hunter regarding the quality of chapters 335 to 338?,"Why do Hunter x Hunter's chapters between 334-338 look this bad?  I know that Togashi had several illnesses, but is the illness that he had getting worst at those chapter? (I didn't resize the image so everyone could see the picture very clearly at the first glance).  Has Shueisha ever made a clarification regarding those chapters?  I have the physical books/compendium version of Hunter x Hunter that have relevant chapters on it (chapter 335-338 are included in vol 32 of HxH). But the art is still the same (my physical books of HxH are translated to Indonesian language and it's published through legal sources).   It happened in the 13th Hunter Chairman Election Arc, started on chapter 334. why the art suddenly/constantly changed?  Page 19, chapter 334    The audience looks are not drawn well, it looks like that scene was still a draft.  In chapter 335, it looks worse than chapter 334.  Page 7, chapter 335    And worse in chapter 336 (it looks like a rough sketch, look at Killua's hair and body, Nanika's inked hair, also the bench....)  Page 12, chapter 336    The worst in chapter 337 (What's wrong with you Kaito... and also the background... just what... )  Page 12, chapter 337    Well, chapter 337 is the worst that I have observed so far... They started to change the art frequently starting from chapter 338, but I would say, it's still bad.  Page 12, chapter 338    and finally, in chapter 340, we can have the fine art from Togashi.  Page 17, chapter 340   "
2157,What is Truth's view of the philosopher's stone?,"What is Truth's view of the philosopher's stone? In an episode Father mentioned that ""playing god"" was a sin in Truth's eyes. Why doesn't Truth punish alchemists merely for creating or using a philosopher's stone then? "
2158,Why does Gekko Moriah set sailors back out to sea if their zombie version will die?,After Moriah takes sailors shadows he puts them on a boat and sends them out to sea. But he says that if the person who the shadow came from dies the zombie they gave the shadow to will die. So why does Moriah send the originals back out to sea? Wouldn't it make more sense to just lock them up so they don't die? Otherwise their zombies would just keep dying. 
2159,Why do Maeda Jun productions so frequently feature baseball?,"Things by Maeda Jun feature baseball. A lot.   Episode 1 of Clannad: After Story is a baseball episode, and there's a fair bit of baseball elsewhere in both seasons of Clannad. Episode 4 of Charlotte is a baseball episode. Episode 4 of Angel Beats! is a baseball episode, and the whole Hinata/Yui thing later in the show is also rife with baseball. Little Busters! is brimming with baseball. I'm told that Rewrite (the VN) also has baseball in it. Dunno about Air or Kanon, but I'd be surprised if they were devoid of baseball.   I know baseball is big in Japan, and I know that Maeda's work is formulaic to a degree (ever seen the Maeda Jun bingo board?), but this goes beyond that. Why does Maeda Jun put baseball in so many of his works? (I've heard that Key has some sort of sponsorship deal with a baseball team. Is this true? If so, that'd explain it.) "
2160,"What game are António, Carlos and Jobim playing?","In Cowboy Bebop, there are three men that are seen recurrently: António, Carlos and Jobim. They are most often found playing cards.

2162,Are all namekians brothers?,"IIRC , all namekians were born from the grand elder, but apparently in the new chapter of the Dragon Ball Super manga they say      One character who heals Goku and Vegeta is Dende's brother. If he's Dende's brother, does this mean the other namekians arent his brothers?   Then, are all namekians brothers or not? "
2163,What caused the shift in the world after the climax of the show?,"At the end of the show, it was implied that…      …the world was pretty much destroyed and recreated, with only a few select people remembering the changes and what happened. The currency of Japan also shifted from the Japanese Yen to the US Dollar.   What could possibly cause the shift in currency? Was anything revealed about the motives of Masakaki and/or the Midas bank?  It seems doubtful that the two had the best interests of the human economy in mind...   Was there some higher power (or deeper conspiracy) at play masterminding almost everything surrounding the Financial Districts, and simply playing along with the decisions made by the Entres?   "
2164,"What is happening in the ""Depth of Field"" specials?","The Depth of Field specials (included with the BD/DVDs) depict Dekomori and Rika going at it against each other in giant, magically-powered CG mechs.

2165,"In the male quarters, how exactly does the male crew of the Thousand Sunny sleep?","This question is regarding One Piece.    As I was going through the design of the Thousand Sunny on Wikia, I came across this image of The boys' room, which I've posted below:    As can be seen here, there are six hammocks in the image, verified by this link.     Suspended from the ceiling like wooden hammocks are three   double-decker bunks, which the men sleep in.      It also adds that     Behind these bunks, at   the back of the room, are six lockers where the men can store their   clothes.   Since there are seven male members in the Straw Hat crew, there must be one person who doesn't get to sleep in a hammock and who doesn't have a locker. My question is, who is it?  I came across this and this link which pose a similar question. The answers which seem to be valid are    Sanji sleeping in the kitchen     I don't think Sanji sleeps in the kitchen, but there is a couch to the right here, does Sanji sleep there?  I think Sanji does have a locker to himself.   Zoro sleeping in the crow's nest     The crow's nest seems to have wooden benches, but I doubt Zoro sleeps there.  I think Zoro has a locker to himself, too.   Brook not sleeping     In an SBS question, Oda has said that Brook sleeps for five hours. This is the link. This link gives their sleep timings. So that eliminates the possibility that Brook doesn't sleep. Maybe he doesn't sleep in this room though?  I can't guess if he has a locker or not.   Chopper sleeping on the bed in the Sick Bay     This seems like the most plausible solution, since Chopper considers the Sick Bay as his personal room, provided the bed isn't reserved for patients.  He might be the one who doesn't have a locker, since he can keep his stuff in the infirmary.   One of them is on night watch, so there are enough hammocks for the rest   This is possible, but is it true? If it is, was there any rare occasion when none of them was on watch? I highly doubt it, but if the answer is yes, how did they sleep then?  Even if they did manage to sleep somehow (one of them on the floor, for example), there are still six lockers though, so who doesn't have a locker to himself?  The following image provides a pretty nice solution, but this is an image from when the Straw Hats were on the Going Merry. Do they use the same solution on the Thousand Sunny too?    A person who has seen the anime or read the manga, or done both, might probably know the answer. Any help is highly appreciated.    I apologize for the lengthy question. I haven't watched or read One Piece. I came across it about a month ago and it drew my attention greatly. My knowledge is mostly limited to the information I gained by reading the Wikipedia and Wikia pages of One Piece.  "
2166,How to review Naruto before I begin from where I left?,"I was an ardent fan of Naruto and watched all of its episodes one after another and reached the end of Shippuden at that time. It was 2 years ago I guess and I last watched episode 220 or something... just after reanimation jutsu etc while the world war was going on. Then it became one episode per week and I stopped watching and thought to myself that I will pick it up again when it will be over. Alas! It is still going on but I have heard that it will end by this December. But now I am not sure that I remember the whole story and picking it up again will not be that enjoyable. So maybe I should re watch it whole and skip the filler episodes! That way I can join the current episodes within a month and watch the final as it air.  Or if I watch the Naruto movies, does it have the same story and characters and fill me in on all the important things to know before joining in on the current episodes which are going on nowadays? Movies will save me a lot of time and trouble but will they be enough? "
2167,Does Kanon enjoy figure skating?,"In G-Senjou no Maou, Kanon is a world-class figure skater. However, at different points in the story, when asked if she enjoys figure skating, she speaks ambiguously or dodges the question. It's implied at times that she is only doing it because her mother wants her to, but at other times she seems to like it.  What are Kanon's real feelings about figure skating? Is she continuing to pursue it for herself or for the interests of others?   "
2168,How do all the planets defend themselves?,"This will make sense if you've seen the material, but I phrased it this way to avoid spoilers.  In Dragon Ball Super, power levels go off the charts.  Which is cool to watch in the fight scenes.  However, episode 27 showcases (spoiler link) how easy it is for someone of such a high level to cause an irreversible catastrophe.  Since we later learn that our usual heroes and villains aren't especially powerful in the grand scheme of things, and that there are numerically many more beings with such high power levels, how do all these inhabited worlds protect themselves from such powerful beings?  Having a planetary defense network is one thing, but if any one person could cause such a catastrophe, how do you defend against that?  Is this just how the story/plot works, or are do all these planets have defenses against this sort of thing? "
2169,What is the card game the characters play?,"Throughout the story, the characters often play the card game with each other.   What type of game or games are they plays? What are the rules?   "
2170,"In Monster anime, what made Johan so special?","Why was everyone who knew Johan, so convinced that he was a superior figure or someone special, especially from the time that he was a kid?  The show gave a lot of instances where everyone who knew Johan, was rather impressed by him and regarded him as a kind of leader never seen before. In fact, many, like Baby, wanted him to become the next Hitler.   But what was so special about him?  Did the show really give any reasoning behind this? "
2171,How come sports anime never have tryouts?,"This might sound like a weird question, but hear me out. In all of the anime that I've seen that revolves around high school sports, they never seem to have the concept of the ""tryout"".   Keep in mind that I live in the States, so my perspective will be biased. When I was in high school, all of our sports teams required prospective members to pass the tryouts in order to join. Basically, the coach/advisor of the team would administer an exam for the new potential members, to gauge their proficiency in the sport. If they were deemed satisfactory, they are granted membership into the team. If not, then they are rejected.   However, in all the sports-related anime that I've seen, it looks like any student could just submit an application and join the team. They often don't even care about their skill in the sport, since I've seen many sports anime where new team members can be complete novices. So how come they don't hold tryouts/auditions to make sure that all members of the team are above some baseline level of competency in the sport? I'm sure this would greatly improve their performance in competitions and such. This isn't limited to anime either, since I've also seen it in Japanese soap operas. Is it just a cultural difference? "
2172,Who is Julius Kingsley?,"In the second episode of ""Code Geass: Akito the Exiled"" a man calling himself ""Julius Kingsley"" exites a train of the royal family. To understand this episode and not getting spoiled by my question you should have seen Code Geass R1 completely, the beginning of Code Geass R2 and the first episode of ""Code Geass: Akito the exiled"".    (Note that ""Code Geass: Akito the Exiled"" takes place in the year beetween Code Geass R1 and Code Geass R2)      The man exiting the train looks like Lelouch, his behaviour is also similar to Lelouch's (except Lelouch is less arrogant). The facts that Suzaku accompanies him and he wears an eyepatch on his left eye (the source of Lelouch's Geass) made me think whether this really is Lelouch or not. My first thought was that Lelouch lost his memories of the time before he was send to Japan (maybe he lost more memories too) and sees himself as a member of the royal family. Also, Julius Kingsley takes complete control of the troup planing. As Lelouch is a great tactician, I came to the conclusion that Julius Kingsley has to be Lelouch. Am I right? If so, why does he call himself Julius Kingsley? And what happened in the train, when he desperately begged for water?   Thanks in advance. "
2173,Can Norma have kids?,"So when I was watching this anime I was wondering - even though all the Norma are women and they are stuck on that island, is it still possible for them to have kids? And I also wonder, did any Norma have kids in the past? "
2174,"In Mobile suit Gundam ZZ, how was Judau able to control the separated parts of his Gundam?","I believe it was episode 47 when Judau battles Hammon Karn's Qubeley. Hammon manages to get hold of the Gundam Double Zeta. In order to break free, Judau separates his Gundam (it has three components, each with its own cockpit). Then there is some nonsense about the two leaving their mobile suits, Hammon with a gun and Judau with some metal rod. When Judau returns to his Gundam, he is able to use his Newtype powers to take control of the parts of his Gundam and reassemble them.  Now, in other instances where Newtype powers resonate with the pilot's mobile suit and result in some kind of physical action, it is attributed to the Psycommu. However, this is introduced to Federation and Aeug suits until the 2nd Neo Zeon War (this was the first) and double Zeta Gundam definitely did not have a Psycommu system.  There are two other instances I found where similar occurrences happened. One was when Amuro prevented Axis from crashing into Earth in what was to become known as the Axis shock. The other was when Banagher was able to link the Garencieres with the Nahel Argama. However, these two instances involve Gundams with Psycommu systems installed.  What explanation for Judau's abilities are there? Does this supersede the realm of science fiction? Would this be a deus ex machina?  Edit: I believe my initial assumptions when asking my questions were a bit incorrect. The Psycommu system was around since the 1 year war, present in several mobile armors including but not limited to Lalah's Elmeth and Char's Zeong. In Char's Deleted Affair, it is incorporated greatly into the mobile suit designs on Axis and eventually led to the creation of the Qubeley. The Psycho frame on the other hand wasn't introduced until the 2nd Neo Zeon War. I had the two systems confused. It was the Psycho frame which allowed the Axis shock to occur and allowed Banagher to get the Garencieres into space. However, the question still stands, How did Judau manage to reassemble his Gundam which lacked the psycho frame and psycommu? "
2175,What happened to Kaiki in Monogatari Series?,"We saw at the end of Monogatari Second Season that     Kaiki is apparently killed by one of the boys (or girls?, I do not remember very well) he scammed.    If I followed the storyline correctly, this happens just after the events that involved Nadeko, but before the graduation of Araragi and Senjōgahara.  Then, on Hanamonogatari, which is after the graduation of Araragi and Senjōgahara,      Kaiki is still alive and kicking, and without any evidence of the beating that he received.   Am I missing something in the storyline?      Because he should be dead by the beating that he received. Why he is not?   "
2176,How much of a Devil Fruit must be consumed to gain the power?,"To get the devil fruit power is it necessary to eat the whole devil fruit?

2177,How come Alphonse can do alchemy in Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood?,"In Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, how come Alphonse can sometimes perform alchemy, and at other times it seems he can't? Also, early on the show, wasn't it said that he lost his ability when he lost his body? And if he can do alchemy, why isn't he a state alchemist too? "
2178,Why should I skip the first episode of Gungrave?,"I've seen advice on the internet indicating that one should start watching Gungrave at episode 2, and possibly come back to episode 1 at some later point in the series.  Before I start watching this show, I would like to know whether this advice makes sense. In a spoiler-free way, can someone explain why I should skip episode 1? (Feel free to include more detailed explanations in a spoiler block.)  And should I come back to episode 1 at some later point in the series?  "

2182,What happened to the Ring of Andvari?,"I just finished watching all four seasons of Zero no Tsukaima, I don't know if I missed something, but I couldn't find an answer to this question.    After the battle at Lagdorian Lake (at episode 9, season 1), Saito promised to give back the Ring of Andvari to the Holy Water Spirit in exchange for ""the tear of a water elemental"", that was needed to create an antidote.  This ring was with Sheffield at first place, but after she loses it, who take possession of it? Was it ever returned to the Water spirit?  "
2183,Power of Ultra Instinct,"In the dragon ball universe there are plenty of methods to significantly boost the power level of the user. We have things such as Potara earrings, saiyan power ups etc. But more recently we were introduced to Ultra Instinct. As this is said to be a form attainable by anyone but mostly used by gods (which is even difficult for them to attain) how strong is it actually? Like how much does it power up an individual that uses it.  This question is mainly based on the episode of 115 where Goku used Ultra Instinct against Kefle as well as against Jiren in an earlier episode. In SSB form Goku was eventually outmatched even with Kaioken activated. We know for a fact that SS forms basically boost power and speed significantly at the cost of stamina and ki over time. Ultra Instinct is a state of the body, making it respond without having to process the thoughts; making the body capable of an instant perfect reflex to anything.   Goku was able to dodge all of Kefla's attacks which seemed like slow motion to him most likely. But he wasn't powered up. Ultra Instinct doesn't provide ki and such it simply is a state of the body making your reflexes perfect with no time delay. So where does the power output come from? How come his punches and such are stronger with Ultra Instinct compared to all his other forms?   As far as I understand each time he was in his none powered up form, his base form. This means his power level is a lot lower than even kaioken in base form. How come he is capable of having such a damage output? Does this mean a designing flaw in Ultra Instinct?   What is the actual power of Ultra Instinct apart from making muscle reflexes perfect? "
2184,Is Erza's samurai costume considered an armor?,"That famous costume where her hair is tied in a very long huge pony tail and she has only bandages on her torso and this baggy red hakama pants with a katana.  Is that an armor? If so, what's the name?   "
2185,Why isn't there any continuation to the Planetes' anime?,"Planetes was really well received but yet it doesn't have an anime continuation even though I hear the manga goes well beyond the anime (I think until exploration to Jupiter?).  I can't seem to find any reason why it's not happening, is it because it didn't have enough viewers or is it because it's been too long since the anime last aired? Usually anime that won't get a conclusion has an explicit reason but this one doesn't and it's really bothersome. "
2186,What is the longest-running manga series that has already ended before september 2016?,"Ah! My Goddess manga has run from september 1988 to june 2014, and that is 25 years, 9 months.  Of the manga series that have already ended by this posting (before september 2016), what is the longest-running one?  Is it Ah! My Goddess? Or is there an even longer one?  I'm more interested in the time between the first and the last chapter, but if you can in addition to make a point for the one with more chapters, that is also acceptable "
2187,Does Sailor Moon Crystal contain the Black Moon arc of the manga (Pluto and Chibiusa)?,"Has it been officially stated anywhere by a representative at the production company whether Sailor Moon Crystal's 26 total episodes cover the Black Moon arc of the manga (Chibiusa, Sailor Pluto, and the Black Moon Clan, equal to season R of the classic anime series)?  Has it been stated anywhere that it only covers the content of the Dark Kingdom arc of the manga (equivalent to the first season of the classic anime)?  Crystal has covered in a mere 8 episodes the equivalent of 33 episodes of the classic anime series which contained 46 episodes total.  In other words, it has covered 72% of the classic anime's first season content within only 31% of Crystal's scheduled episode count. I know that Crystal is based on the original manga, that it is not adapting the classic anime, and that the manga storyline progressed much faster (less filler), but even so, that's a big percentage of the manga's Dark Moon arc to have already shown us in only 8 episodes.  The opening animation sequence does not include any characters introduced in the Black Moon arc, but then again, it could receive a new animation sequence mid-run at the point in time when that manga arc would begin (without a second season needing to occur to herald the story arc shift). "
2188,Why is that woman considerd the woman that Rimuru is destined to be with?,"In episode 6, we learn that     Shizu   is the woman Rimuru is destined to be with.  She shows up in the next episode.     She also dies a couple of episodes later, the next day in-universe.  Aside from her showing up in the OP and ED, and being a quest-giver (for Rimuru to be a teacher) several episodes later, she doesn't have much going on in the series.   Why is she considered so important and ""Rimuru's destiny""?  Why is she seemingly more important than Veldora, the ogre women, Miliam, etc?      Why is she more important than any of the other monsters/spirits that Rimuru absorbed?   I'm only familiar with the anime, so if the manga/LN goes that much more in detail about this, then don't spoil it and leave the answer somewhat vague. "
2189,What is this manga about a demon or vampire linked to an acolyte?,"I read this manga a very long time ago....  And the story goes like this: There's a demon, or vampire or something (can't remember it well) who overpowers all.  He's the strongest, and up until the current state nobody can kill him, because he is somewhat an immortal, because of his healing powers...  He's also cruel. Then this girl came; an acolyte girl that was ordered cast a spell (or prayer) to him, and then to kill herself. She was ordered by the ""highest rank priest"" (somewhat similar from the position of the paladin in Ao no Exorcist). The spell was actually to connect her life to the demon, so whatever happen to the girl or to the demon will also happen to the other... I can't remember it so well, but I think the girl is scared to kill herself. She also wants to know why the priest ordered her to do such a thing (why did the priests want her to die?).  Well, it ends up that they tag along with each other from then.  That was all that I can remember. And that was just the 1st chapter... I remember that during the time I'm reading it online it was turned to be already licensed so I think the manga was dropped, but I still want to know the title of this one.  Does anyone know what this manga is? Thanks in advance. :)  and, NO. It's not zenki. It doesn't have an anime. "

2191,How Can so many weapons from Saito's world exist in Halkeginia?,"Saito went to Halkeginia from a portal that appeared in front of him in normal world:     At the time of the summoning, he had just picked up his laptop after attempting to get it repaired in Akihabara.   Walking home a portal of some kind opened in front of him; and Saito's   curiosity getting the better of him, he touched it and was sucked   through.   After this, he traveled to Halkeginia and become Louise's familiar.  But this portal only appeared at Saito's world because Louise used The Summoning spell, to summon a familiar (destiny?). At that time, nobody knew that Saito's world even existed.   So, how can be explained all other stuffs from his world that appeared in Halkeginia? Like all those weapons and airplanes used by him:   SIG Sauer P226   M72 LAW   A6M Zero fighter Mitsubishi-F-2A  Flak 88 anti-aircraft/anti-tank gun   I didn't read their manga/novels, is it better explained there?  (Weapon names and images taken from this Wiki). "
2192,When did Koko's mirror end up in Banri's stuff?,"Spoilers for the ending of Golden Time:      The twin mirrors are switched in the final episode. Yama is seen giving Koko the broken one in the previous one, but I missed the scene when the one belonging to Koko ends up in Banri's place.     Is that shown? If it is, in what episode? "
2193,Was Haru actually trying to kill Yamaken?,"In Episode 10 of Tonari no Kaibatsu-kun, after Yamaken asked Haru ""What if Mizutani-san says that she likes me more?"", Haru thought for a second and then slowly reached out to Yamaken. However, before he can do whatever he was thinking, Mizutani asked what he was up to and he snapped out of his thoughts.  Was Haru actually planning to kill Yamaken by pushing him off the stairs?  "
2194,"When I use online manga readers, does the mangaka get any income from it?","I usually read manga from online readers, specifically MangaPanda.  Am I contributing to a mangaka's income by reading from such websites? Are they licensed to distribute them online? "
2195,"Who is the ""emperor of BL""?","In episode 4 of Fudanshi Koukou Seikatsu, there's a gag where Sakaguchi mentions ""the emperor [or empress?] of BL, Mori███████yuki"". Judging from the bleeping-out of the name, I assume this is a reference to a real person who draws BL manga. But who?   I had a look through all the people on MAL whose family names begin with ""Mori"" and whose personal names end with ""yuki"" and didn't come up with anything.  "
2196,Was Hyakkimaru immortal before regaining his body?,"When Hyakkimaru was born, he had no limbs, no tongue, no nose, no eyes, no ears and no internal organs. How could he possibly survive then? If he couldn't breath and he couldn't eat since he didn't have a stomach or lungs, does that mean that during the duration of his ordeal he was also immortal? "
2197,What really happened in the bridge sequence in the final episode of Golden Time?,"Mysticism apart, there are several elements in that sequence that may be real and others that are purely imaginary.  The conversation between ghost Banri and Reawakened Banri is imaginary, but the other elements are confusing...   How the ring ends in Banri's pocket? It fell off the bridge. The ghost is soaking wet, implying that he did went into the river to get it, but the ghost cannot interact with the real world unless he is possessing Banri. Banri is dry when he hugs Koko. Linda's response: is it the real Linda that is delivering it (she could have ran after and caught up with Banri while he was discussing with the ghost) or just another figment?   How long is that bridge? Is it a real landmark?    "
2198,Why does Madhouse produce anime with consistently high-quality animation?,"That may be my personal observation, but I noticed that anime produced by the production company Madhouse have somewhat-consistently high-quality animation.  Even if the anime itself may not be a hit, the quality of drawings seems to be higher than most other production companies.  To list a few of their recent productions:   One Outs - a sports anime were lots of movements and running characters without the usual quirks of inconsistent body part movements. Death Note - Brilliant drawings of characters with excellent usage of colors to illustrate different personalities. Akagi &amp; Kaiji - somewhat weird looking characters with bold black outlining, but still manage to fit perfectly into the overall anime atmosphere. Btooom! - a short (and maybe unknown to many) anime, but still has still with excellent presentation.   The list could really go on and on with HunterXHunter, Trigun, Parasyte, Hajime no Ippo, Ninja Scroll, ...etc.  Is this just a case of a big studio that has lots of money (although I hear that the anime production companies are always running on limited budgets)?  Do they hire only the best illustrators? "
2199,Frieza's whopping power level in the Real 4-D,"In an cinematic attraction at Universal Studios Japan, Dragon Ball Z: The Real 4-D, Frieza has shown to have power level of 5.3 Billion. Does that counted as true? AFAIK, during Frieza Saga, 100% Final Form Frieza's power level is only around 120 Million according to this list. Is Toriyama completely ignore the previous power level or just for advertising purpose? "
2200,Why is King Deviluke in his chibi form?,"Why is King Deviluke in his chibi form when Lala, Zastin, Nana and Momo (his offsprings) are on their normal forms? I thought it was because he was on Deviluke planet, but even when he came to earth, he was still on his chibi form. Was it ever explain in the anime?   "
2201,Why was lord Muu's fissioned clone not affected by the Earth Release: Ultra-Added-Weight Rock Technique?,"During the 4th shinobi war, during Onoki vs Muu fight. Onoki makes Muu's body so heavy that he can't even lift his hands using the Earth Release: Ultra-Added-Weight Rock Technique.   After this Lord Muu using his Fission jutsu to become as two people with halved power.   My doubt is why is the fissioned clone not affected by the Earth Release: Ultra-Added-Weight Rock Technique? The single person becomes two when the fission Jutsu is used and also their power is equally shared. Then is equal part must hold true for the Damage taken also right? "
2202,How many different mental states of Banri are there in Golden Time?,"It is more of a list of the different mental states of Banri and the mental states he is experiencing.  So, please correct me and expand the list. I will follow this model:    ""name"". When he appears. What memories he has. Whether he is a stable or temporary state of mind.      Pre-accident Banri. Shown in flashbacks. Has all the memories pre-accident, stable. Post-accident (Main) Banri. The one that enrolls university and dates Koko. Has all post accident memories (including the hospital escapade). Stable during the first three quarters of the show.   Ghost Banri. Several scenes throughout the whole series. Only watches, cannot interact. Has all memories (since he is the incarnation of past Banri and watched main Banri all the time). ""Stable"", vanishes after his unresolved issue settles after Linda's confession/answer. Possessed Banri. A few episodes in the mid-series. Has pre-accident memories, but is somewhat psychotic. Very unstable.   Tabula rasa Banri. Last quarter of the series. Is catatonic, no memories. Unstable, reverts to main Banri after a while. Sometimes shown in the transition between possessed and main Banri (do proper names have plurals? - cross posting to ELL.SE).   Healed Banri. Final episodes. Has pre-accident memories only. Stable, but may have gone into possessed mode offscreen during the month he spent home to retrieve the ring.   ""Final evolution/Awakened"" (sorry for the pun) Banri. Ending, after Koko's visit and the mirror epiphany. Has all memories. Probably very stable, since he is the happy ever after version...   So, did I get it right or am I missing/mistaking something? "
2203,Which musical piece is this from Code Geass?,"This tune is from R2 episode 23, near 19:20 mark in the version I have, though it is played many times in the series.   The tune plays at 7:15 in this video.  Does anyone know which musical piece this is? "
2204,"What is the origin of the ""this is a work of fiction"" explanation? Is it a trope?","At the beginning or end of episodes of anime I sometimes see a disclaimer similar to this:  This program is a work of fiction. Any resemblance to people, parties, or situations is purely coincidental.   Is this a trope? Or is there some Japanese regulation that sometimes applies to these shows?  The above quote was taken from the end of Durarara! ep 1x13 to be exact. "
2205,An old anime with a scene of a young man struggling to reach the top of a glass staircase,"Any help solving this would be appreciated. It's been so long, I can't even tell if I actually saw this, or if it was some sort of fever-dream that I made up and will never track down. Here's the scene:  A young man is struggling to reach the top of a glass spiral staircase (maybe to save a young woman from something evil at the top?), and the glass steps under his feet keep cracking but not breaking all the way (and maybe cutting his bare feet?).  This really felt like I caught just the climax, and I don't remember anything before or after for context, unfortunately. That sequence has just always stuck with me over the years, I need to get closure and find out what it was! "
2206,What are the marks on Index-tan's left eye?,"In the Toaru Majutsu no Index specials, Index-tan is shown to have some marks on her left eye. However, she did not have any on the 'main anime'.      What is the significance of these marks? If it was not explained anywhere, are there any speculations as to what it might mean? "
2207,Does a ninja have to be a Jōnin to be a Kage?,"I mean does a ninja have to go through the ranks of being a Genin, a Chūnin, a Jōnin and then finally a Kage?  In the movie Road to Ninja Naruto asks Iruka to fill his Jōnin  form but Iruka refuses it saying that Naruto will have to be a Chūnin to fill out the application form of Jōnin. But when Naruto became Hokage he still has to be a Genin right? If thats a case can any of the a Genin, a Chūnin, a Jōnin become a Kage? "
2208,What will happen if a wild pokemon is hit by 2 pokeballs of the same strength at the same time?,"Wild Tauros appears. Trainer A throws Safari Ball (Ball A). Trainer B throws a Safari Ball (Ball B).  Now, a rare occurrence happens: both PokeBalls hit Tauros at exactly the same time. What will happen to Tauros? Will it enter Ball A, Ball B, or neither? Since PokeBalls converts Pokemon into energy before storing it, will it split in two and each trainer will have half a Tauros in each ball? Will this kill Tauros in the process? What if one of the balls is of better quality or strength? Like a normal PokeBall vs. a Great Ball? "
2209,In Nejimaki Seirei Senki: Tenkyou no Alderamin what happens to the spirit if his 'owner' dies?,"If the owner of the spirit dies, can the spirit chose another human? And what happens if the spirit and the human are separated?  Will it obey someone else and if yes, under what circumstances?  "

But in Dororo(1969), Hyakkimaru body is also been taken by the demon but he is able to talk.   Why? I see the story is wrote by the same person(Osamu Tezuka). Isn't Dororo(2019) is a remake version of the old one? "
2211,Does the rinnegan give perfect chakra control to its true wielder,"Does the rinnegan give their original/true wielder perfect chakra control?  Lets say Nagato was born with his rinnegan, would he automatically have perfect control over his chakra? "
2212,Was there ever a Pokemon game based off the Orange Islands?,"Did they ever release a Pokemon game dealing with the Orange Island League?   I was thinking and I remembered that each Pokemon anime series followed the same route as the games as far as getting the badges, but I wanted to know if they ever released a Pokemon game that dealt with Ash's adventures in the Orange Islands.   If they did what is the name of the game? If they didn't, why not?  "
2213,Have Mikage's powers diminished?,"At the very beginning of Kamisama Kiss, Mikage gave Nanami spiritual powers and made her the Kami of Mikage shrine, but did he do this without losing any of his own power? Is there any evidence that his powers have diminished? If so, how much has he been weakened? Is there any evidence to the contrary?  Related question with no satisfactory answers: What is Mikage&#39;s status (in the spirit/god world) after he passes the Tochigami Crest to Nanami? Is he still a god?  I'm looking for an answer with more evidence than the one for this question and I would like to see more of a focus on Mikage's power and abilities rather than his status. "
2214,Did the people of Trost District evacuate when the breach in Wall Rose happened?,"In volume 9 of Attack on Titan, when Wall Rose was breached, did the people of Trost evacuate to Wall Sina along with the settlers who lived in the southwest area (like Connie and Sasha's village) of Wall Rose? Or was it just the settlers that evacuated, for they were the ones closest to the breach? "
2215,"What does ""Daimadoshi"" mean in ""Dai no Daibouken"" (Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai)?","One of my favorite character in Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai is Pop the Magician. Toward the end of the series, he battles with Hadler's chess squad and has a one-on-one fight with the horse Sigma. Pop demonstrates great magical skills and Sigma asked him if he is a sage. Pop answers that he doesn't like the title of sage and had chosen a title for himself: Daimadoshi.  What does Daimadoshi mean in the universe of the manga?   The manga obviously uses a lot of Japanese, even if it is set in a fantasy universe. Does Daimadoshi mean anything in Japanese? Or is it a made-up for the manga?  Note: I hesitated before posting this question on Japanese.se, because I am not sure whether daimadoshi is a Japanese word (or made up from Japanese terms like Tenchimato) or a word from the manga's universe. "
2216,What was Avilio's alibi during the after-credits scene in episode 2?,"In the after-credits scene of episode 2 of 91 Days, Nero questions Avilio about the circumstances of Vanno's death. Crunchyroll translates the dialogue as follows:     AVILIO: He stole Vanno's gun. I shot Serpente, but it was too late.      BARBERO: Your hands weren't tied?      AVILIO: Serpente said he'd let me pray. Then he tied up Vanno...   Is that actually his alibi? It doesn't make a whole lot of sense that Serpente would have to steal Vanno's gun if Avilio were already tied up. And why would Serpente let Avilio pray and then tie up Vanno? This doesn't make a whole lot of sense. "
2217,Why weren't the Titans visible when the Armored Titan broke through Wall Maria?,"How come in the first episode when the Armored Titan breaks through Wall Maria, there aren't any Titans visible      given that the wall is made of Titans?   When Eren battles the Female Titan later on      the Titans in the wall are easily visible.   Was this due to the story having not developed to this point or is there another explanation? "

2220,Where do fans exchange info about anime/manga merchandise for sale?,"What are the main websites and forums where fans exchange info about where online to buy anime/manga collectibles from Japan (such as trading offers/requests, current auctions, recommended online shops, wish lists)? In particular, for hunting down/notifying about chances to acquire out-of-print merchandise such as for series which have already ended.  When I used to buy anime/manga collectibles made in Japan about 15 years ago, many fans were on email mailing lists (based on subjects such as shoujo anime, or specific series) where members would, from time to time, post links to trading websites and eBay auctions of interest, or share if they had found a reliable shop or proxy buying/bidding service, but I think this sort of ML is not very popular these days.  Where is the Go To place for most fans to share info about anime/manga merchandise that is currently for sale?  I came across [website]"

Is there any significance that they re-used this particular job request again and again?  Yes, I am positive that this has appeared more than this 2 times throughout the entire Fairy Tail Anime.  "
2222,How does censorship in the English release affect the Dragon Ball Z manga storyline?,"Dragon Ball Wiki stated that compared to the original Japanese manga, the Viz English release of Dragon Ball Z is censored.     English distribution      [...] The ""Dragon Ball Z"" manga remains censored, although many volumes (prior to volume 17) are technically uncensored since they did not contain any objectionable material.         Mr. Popo's lips and other dark-skinned characters were edited because of complaints made by Carole Boston Weatherford.   Middle fingers were edited into fists.         In 2006, Viz began releasing a second, A-rated (All Ages) edition of the series sans some nudity and profanity.         The name Mr. Satan was edited into ""Hercule"" (the same as Funimation's edited anime dub).   Firearms were edited into ""laser blasters"", though a pistol-armed robber was able to shoot a character without being censored.   Alcohol, drugs and sexual innuendo were edited.         VIZBIG editions      [...] These releases are also edited for content to make the series more family-oriented.   Does the manga alter any dialog or story? So, how bad is that in the overall experience? If it's so bad, what are my other options to read the manga? "

2224,Is there a reason Yato couldn't summon Nora in the final battle of the first season of Noragami?,"Nora (a.k.a. Furuhime) retains the mark of her past masters who never officially set her free, so shouldn't she still have Yato's mark on her body, allowing him to summon her at any moment?  If he can, is there any good in-universe reason that he didn't summon her during the final battle (in episode 11) in order to disarm Rabo?  Couldn't Yato have summoned Nora, dropped her onto the ground, and then used Sekki (Yukine) to deal with a weaponless Rabo?  Bishamon is able to have multiple shinki summoned into their non-human form at once, so there is no restriction that you can only have 1 shinki in weapon form at a time.    I assume that once she has been summoned by a god, she cannot be summoned by another god.   Also, while she was in her human form in episode 11, up until Rabo summoned her into his weapon version of her (Reiki), Yato could just as easily have summoned her into his weapon version of her, and if he had done so, Rabo could no longer summon her.  Is this a plot hole: that Yato just didn't think of disarming his opponent when he easily could have done so? "
2225,Why did Wenge get kicked off the Chinese national team?,"In Ping Pong: The Animation, Wenge is a Chinese exchange student who came to Japan to work his way back up to the Chinese national team (he hopes to win nationals, etc.).

2227,Do the Bleach light novels follow the manga plot?,"I know that there are two Bleach light novels (BLEACH-letters from the other side: The Death and The Strawberry and Bleach: The Honey Dish Rhapsody). Do they follow the Bleach manga plot lines or do they diverge? If they follow the manga, what chapters do they cover? If not, what happens in them? "
2228,How does L deduce that Kira needs a name and not just a face?,"This is something that I've been wondering about, how does L deduce that Kira needs a name? Surely all the victims he investigated had their name and face, but how can he figure that he needs both? The stunt on tv with Lind L. Tailor only proved that Kira can't kill anyone, and there are certain criteria. I'm not sure how that concludes that he needs both name and face.  Edit: To clarify, here's how I look at it. L analyzes all the victims of the Kira killings and noticed that what was broadcast about the criminals was their face and their name. How does he conclude that Kira needs both? Why not just a face? When Kira kills Lind L. Tailor, that only validates that Kira has the ability to kill people, to which L himself even says ""I couldn't believe it until I saw it, but it appears you can kill without being there in person."" When Kira subsequently is unable to kill L, L can then deduce that there are people Kira can't kill. However he concludes Kira needs both name and face, which I don't understand. To me, at that point 3 conclusions are viable: Kira needs a name AND a face. Kira needs just a name. Kira needs just a face. "

Is it because it is the Ichigo's final bankai? 
2231,How can a Shinigami drop its eyeballs?,"So BB was born with the Shinigami eyes because a Shinigami dropped it's eyeballs. But how is this even possible?

My question is about the exchange in sign language between them in the last 3 pages of the story. What do the signs mean?      Why did the boy blush and reply ""That's so embarrassing! How can you even say that?!"" in page second to last? And in the last page, when the girl grabbed his hand, why did he say  ""That's not what I meant!""?   The relevant 4 pages.

2233,How well thought out are the economics in Narutoverse (Konoha and other Ninja Villages)? Has Kishimoto ever explained it?,"Naruto uses a currency called the ryō (両).     The ryō (両) is the currency used in the Naruto world. It is based on an old Japanese gold coin that was used in Japan before the Meiji period. It was later replaced by the yen. The exchange rate of a ryō is 10 yen       (from [website]This means 1 ryo ~ 0.1 USD.  From what I can see the villagers pay money for all the missions completed. According to the wikia,        The reward for a D-rank mission is between five thousand and fifty thousand ryō   The reward for a C-rank mission is between thirty thousand and 100 thousand ryō.   The reward for a B-rank mission is between 150 thousand and 200 thousand ryō.   The reward for an A-rank mission is between one hundred fifty thousand and a million ryō   The reward for an S-rank mission is more than a million ryō      From what I can observe, if you earn 5k ryō a day for 200 days a year (1 D-Rank mission per day), you have 1 million ryō viz. $100k per annum. Not bad for doing oddball jobs. This doesn't seem like a feasible economy to me.  However, since all this information is available in databooks etc., has Kishimoto ever suggested how this economy would function?  Or is this another case of WritersCannotDoMath? "
2234,What is Arisa's status at the end of Guilty Crown?,"Arisa is shot several times by the GHQ soldiers at the end of the series, when her shield fails due to all voids disappearing, but the wiki pages have confusing information about her whereabouts at the end.

EDIT: at the time of the original posting of this question, it was uncertain if they would continue the anime series. As of the spring/2015 season, Nisekoi was featured, and new episodes will push the story further. "
2237,What does もっとたゆたゆver. mean in AT-X shows' broadcast information?,"NSFW Warning: The anime mentioned below is something that I think would qualify as borderline hentai or close to something like hentai.  Anyway, I came across this manga called Nande Koko ni Sensei ga!? which I found out just now that it will have an anime adaptation. From here, it says that Tokyo MX, BS11 and AT-X will air it starting on April 07.  Visiting AT-X's site, however, shows this information:        放送スケジュール   もっとたゆたゆver.   2019年4月11日（木）スタート   毎週（木）21：45   毎週（土）13：45   毎週（火）29：45   【15分×1話】   ※視聴年齢制限あり※      From what I could understand here from the little knowledge I have of Japanese, 4月11日 would mean April 11 as the start of broadcast, contrary to April 07. The times would be the broadcast schedules on specific days per week and 視聴年齢制限あり seems to be something about age restriction. What's bugging me is the line 'もっとたゆたゆver.' If I understand correctly, it is read as 'motto tayutayu' where 'motto' would mean more. But I can't seem to find anything about what たゆたゆ means.   What does the line もっとたゆたゆver. mean on AT-X shows' broadcast information? "
2238,"Why is Kazami Yuuji nicknamed ""Juicy Yuuji""?","I notice that a fair number of people (e.g. on reddit) refer to Kazami Yuuji (protagonist of Grisaia) as ""Juicy Yuuji"". Why? What's so juicy about him?  Also: I haven't noticed anybody in the anime (up through episode 4) refer to Yuuji as ""juicy"" or anything of that sort. Is the ""Juicy Yuuji"" nickname (or some Japanese equivalent thereof) used in canon (e.g. the visual novel) at some point, or is it purely a fan invention? "

2241,Can you release your zanpakuto if you are mute?,"So, this sounds like a stupid question I know but in the bleachverse 'names' are very important and you can only unleash the power of your zanpakuto if you can call out its name. Therefore, if a shinigami is mute, will they ever be able to achieve shikai/bankai? If so then how? Only one case that I know of is for shinigamis who have already achieved bankai to be able to release their shikais without a command.  Answers based on LN are welcome, but if you are citing from a dubious source or a source whose canon status can be question, please specifically mention it. I am mostly interested in an answer based on a  canon source. "

Why is there this difference? Is it just some mistake in the voice-acting or key animation ? The wiki page also states that the stand Name is officially Notorious B.I.G, not ""Notorius Chase.""   "
2244,How are the themes and songs picked for a particular series?,"Are the opening/ending themes, insert songs, and background music created specifically for the series they represent, or are they just picked by the producers/production committee based on how well they would fit their series?   What typically happens? What exceptions are there? How much have things changed now compared to the past? "
2245,What were the first anime based on manga and light novels?,"I know that original animes weren't based on light novels or mangas (see: this). However, I think there are some early shows that are based on mangas (Astro Boy for example, I think). What was the first anime based on a manga? Also, what was the first anime based on a light novel? "
2246,"Is there any meaning to the first Hatsuyuki Sakura OP ""freak of nature: start""?","The visual novel Hatsuyuki Sakura has 3 opening themes, namely ""freak of nature: start"" by I've, ""Presto"" by Kotoko, and ""Hesitation Snow"" by fripSide. The latter two have lyrics and a lot of images, so it's pretty easy to tell roughly what they're supposed to mean (basically, they're standard VN OP sequences).   However, the first is just vocalized, with very few character images (mostly just scenery), and thus it's hard to interpret exactly what it's supposed to mean. It plays very early in the novel (i.e. after 3 days, which is just the beginning of the prologue), and at that point the story really hasn't been established at all yet.  [website]What symbolic connection does this song have to the novel? Is it supposed to mean anything, or just set a certain mood? Also, what is the significance of the title ""freak of nature: start"" to the novel? "
2247,What's the tune that Noel is humming in Sora no Method?,What's the tune that Noel is humming as heard in around 02:55 of Episode 5? It seems that Nonoka also knows that tune. It also played as the ED of Episode 7. Does someone know how to tranlate the credits? I think the title is stated somewhere there. 
2248,Why did Vali join the Chaos Brigade?,"Exactly as the title says. Why? As of volume 16 of the light novel, the leader of the Chaos Brigade is Rizevim Livan Lucifer, his grandfather. His grandfather killed Vali's father and was the man behind the bad treatment his parents gave him during his childhood (Rizevim Livan Lucifer &amp; Vali Lucifer). So why did he join the Chaos Brigade in the first place? Why did he betray Azazel and the Grigori who raised him after he fled from home? "
2249,"What is a ""gal wife""?","In Ar Tonelico Qoga: Knell of Ar Ceil, when in Tyria's route (well, more being locked into her ends than a separate route), she expresses her desire to be Aoto's gal wife.  Now she's not the first to express wanting to be with Aoto, as Saki numerous times expresses how she would want to marry Aoto in her Cosmosphere. However, in their True endings....      Saki just has a wedding, wanting a private ceremony, while with Tyria, she's already married Aoto and is wearing something almost like a naked apron (she is wearing panties but I think that's it)   So when Tyria says she wants to be Aoto's gal wife, what does she mean exactly? How is a gal wife different from a normal wife? "
2250,Are there bands specifically dedicated to anime?,"The example of the Seatbelts, led by Yoko Kanno comes to mind. All of Cowboy Bebop's soundtrack was composed and performed by them. Looking at their discography, their albums are all from the Cowboy Bebop franchise, except their live DVD. However, I am unsure as to whether they were created for this purpose, or if they were just a perfect fit.  Are there any bands that dedicate themselves specifically to composing and performing for anime? Or that may be created specifically for a certain series/franchise?  "
2251,Which promised girl is Raku referring to?,"Onodera, Chitoge, and Marika seem to own a key and all of them have a fuzzy memory of their childhood. I think Raku really met them all when he was young and made a promise to each, maybe, so that makes all the three promised girls. Of course, only one key can fit inside Raku's locket but it's not whose key can fit but the girl he made a promise to. So the point of the story is whether Raku chooses the ""promised girl"" or his present love? Or I think is should be which of the three promised girls is his true love? So the one Raku's referring to as the ""promise girl"" is which: the girl with the key to the locket or the girl whom he promised to love?  Sorry I think my question sounds a bit confusing but I hope you try to understand it. "
2252,Is there any meaning behind Kirino's octopus plushie?,"What is the meaning behind Kirino's octopus plushie? Does it have any significance in the story, or is it a symbolic reference to something? Or did the author simply like the design so much he decided to include it?   I'm just curious about it, because while it was not given much attention in the anime, it did appear in most of the episodes.  "
2253,How do Konoha's powers work?,"In Kami Sen, Konoha is a god of poverty (though she denies this). She seems to have a number of special powers, but it's hard to tell exactly how they work. In some cases, she seems to be deliberately controlling them, while other times it seems to be subconscious. It's also implied that having more followers makes her more powerful, as does being in love. In some cases her powers seem to actually help the main characters while in others she brings misfortune.  How, exactly, do her powers work? What determines how powerful they are, and whether she can control them? "
2254,How is Aika related to Mahiro in zetsuten no tempest?,"I have watched the anime Zetsuten no Tempest (Blast of Tempest) recently and I am confused about the relationship between Aika and Mahiro.   From the anime it appears that Mahiro was the son of a rich and influential man and at some point he met with Aika who was to become his new sister.   What I don't understand is: was Aika an orphan child who was adopted by Mahiro's family or did his father remarry or something similar? Also, neither Mahiro nor Aika's parents are ever shown in the anime, are they dead? If so, is there any information concerning their deaths?   I have heard that there's also a Manga, so it might be that the anime is missing some information.   "
2255,What's the story behind Erik Dommel's kid?,"Very briefly in episode 20 (of the 2012 Xebec/AIC remake ""Yamato 2199"") you see a flashback of Erik Dommel's wife and a toddler. I not only assume it is his, I also assume something happened and it's this kid that is buried under the grave he meets his wife at in episode 11 after being awarded the Special First Class Dessler Cross.  What happened? Has it something to do with his wife getting involved in the rebellion against Dessler? (I can't read Garmillan, but the flowers are in the way anyway.) "

2258,Rem's encounter with Subaru at the end of episode 5,"At the end of episode 5,       Why does Rem kill Subaru, despite nothing wrong with relationship between them ?   These events unfold starting at minute 22.   At the end of Episode 5, at night, Subaru is sick. He goes out to find help. He is attacked. At 23:35 to 23:40, we hear the sound of an iron weapon (which is likely to be Rem's morningstar). And Subaru is killed with brute force.    However, it is unclear why Rem does that, given that Rem's relationship with Subaru is looking good. They both go to the village and talk. Rem also looks happy then (at 17:29).      I did watch Episode 6, where Subaru is very distant from Rem, and he acts suspiciously, along with having the witch's scent that gets him killed. But does Rem kill Subaru in Episode 5 for the same reason?    Edited: From @ObviouslyJake's answer, I would like to add some more detail comparing the time frame in episodes 5 and 6: - Similar: Subaru's witch smell (which is the main reason, according to @ObviouslyJake) - Different: the relationship with Rem   Episode 5: They talk and go to the town together. Rem is happy. (As I said above, with an accompanying picture). In this episode, I can feel that Rem and Subaru become friends.  Episode 6: Rem tries to be distant from Subaru. Also, Subaru falls in her garden twice, which she has to fix. In this episode, Rem and Subaru are strangers.    Does the difference in the relationship between Subaru and Rem contribute to Subaru's death at the end of episode 5, compared to episode 6? Or is the witch's smell the only reason?  Because there are two episodes, with some different choices and paths, I think there must be something different here. I feel there has to be, but I can't find it.     Edit (Aug 31, 2016): Thanks to @Davies comment and @ObviouslyJake, here is what I have in my head so far: in episode 6, things are worse than in episode 5. Here, we're talking about why Rem kills Subaru in episode 5, despite them having a good relationship.  My theory is that Rem has a dual personality: Rem the maid, and Rem the oni who hates the Witch.   In episode 5, Subaru has a good relationship with Rem the maid. As a result of having a good relationship with Rem the maid:  - Rem smiles at 17:29 (picture above)  - Rem gets Emilia to teach Subaru in the evening. (Episode 5, 17:57)     However, Rem the oni still hates the Witch, which leads to Rem killing Subaru because of his Witch smell.  Therefore, here is a summary: Rem will try to kill Subaru because of the Witch smell unless the following condition is satisfied:    Rem is dead (nothing to say, I suppose...)   or    Rem the Oni is freed from the tragedy of her childhood.    (Spoilers for episode 18 follow)       The second condition is satisfied when Subaru saves Rem from the demon beast in the forest in episode 11. The proof is in episode 18, from 20:00 to 21:00, where Rem confirms that.      That is what I think, please tell me if I wrong.  "
2259,Was there ever an a cappella version of Nemurihime released?,"In episode 21 of THE iDOLM@STER, Chihaya sings Nemurihime solo at a concert. Thanks to President Kuroi's interference, the technicians won't start the music, so Chihaya decides to sing a cappella (i.e. with no accompaniment). They do start the accompaniment at the first chorus, so it doesn't stay a capella the whole way through, and furthermore the song is cut (the full duration is 5).  The video from the anime is here. Note that this video contains major spoilers; in fact, this scene is basically the climax of the anime. In case you want to avoid any spoilers, the full version of the song from one of the CDs (with accompaniment throughout) is here.  Was a full a cappella version ever released on any of the CDs, or in any other form?   "

2261,Is Squirtle's water potable?,"From Arqade...  I've seen this photo on Facebook:    For sure I would take Charmander for the flame-throwing capabilities, but for the second starter I was thinking about grabbing Squirtle.  Gaining access to clean water would be one of the biggest challenges you would face in a zombie apocalypse, and Squirtle's water gun could be a very easy solution.  Question is, is that water potable? "
2262,"Why is the series called ""Amaama to Inazuma""?","The English title of the series Sweetness and Lightning is a pun on the idiom ""sweetness and light"".   The original Japanese title is Amaama to Inazuma (甘々と稲妻). I wanted to find out if there was a similar pun behind the Japanese title, so I started by looking up the words and was surprised to find that it's basically a literal translation of the English title: amaama means ""sweet"" or ""sugary"" and is the character 甘 (sweet) repeated, and inazuma means ""lightning"".  Without some kind of pun or joke behind it similar to the one in English, the Japanese title seems like sort of a strange combination of words to hit upon. It's such a direct equivalent to the English title that it almost looks like the English title was conceived of first and then translated back into Japanese, but that doesn't make sense because if the original author Gido Amagakure had come up with the English title, that would probably just be the title, since so many anime are named in English already.   I'm curious if there are any linguistic reasons to pick the Japanese title. I'm not asking for thematic reasons; the title is thematically appropriate in both languages, even without the pun. I'm asking why there was such a suitable pun in the English version that apparently didn't exist in the Japanese title, and whether the Japanese version also contains some pun or reference that I've missed. Was the fact that it translates so well into English just a massive coincidence? Is there something more to the Japanese title that I'm not seeing? "
2263,What's the fate of the tailed beasts and Sasuke after chapter 698?,"The fight between Naruto and Sasuke was brutal. It pushed them both to their limits.  In the last page, it is shown that both lose one of their hands. Sasuke admits defeat. I was actually shocked to see that picture. Never imagined the fight could lead up to that.   Now that Sasuke has finally acknowledged Naruto, does it mean Sasuke will now help Naruto? Where does it leave the future of the tailed beasts though, since Sasuke's intention was to kill them?  "
2264,Why does Minori have a flower on her head?,"In Toradora SOS - Hurray For Foodies (as listed on the DVD Cover of the NISA English Dub Release), I understand why Taiga and Ami have animal ears (Taiga is supposed to be the Plam Top Tiger and Ami is a dog because Taiga calls her Chihuahua). However, why does Minori has a flower on her head?  Example (subbed)  NOTE: Toradora SOS 1 and 2 are on the first BluRay disc which had Episode 1 - 9 and I don't recall any character trait of Minori which would indicate the reason for the flower in those episodes.

2266,Why did the shinobi become weaker with every generation?,"I've noticed that the most powerful Ninja seemed to be from older generations.

2268,DBGT: Does Goku die of old age when he turns SSJ4 in the future?," At the start of Dragon Ball GT, Goku was turned into a kid by Ultimate Shenron when Pilaf accidentally said ""I wish you were a kid again!"" after stating Goku became way too powerful and he doesn't stand a chance against him now,  but would if he were to be a kid again. (wish granted, goku turns back into a kid) During his fight with Baby, Goku turned SSJ4 and with it, became so strong that the magic of Ultimate Shenron could not affect him anymore. This was stated in the anime. He was too powerful for Shenron's magic to affect him.   After turning back into his base form, he became a kid again. He didn't go back to being an adult. So Ultimate Shenron's magic reasserted itself when he was no longer SSJ4.  At the very end of GT, we see the future. We see Pan being a very old lady, and a mini-goku and mini-vegeta fighting in the World Martial Arts Tournament. The mini-Goku was implied to be Pan's grandchild. Since we don't see them, we can assume that all of the Z fighters have passed away from old age. Goku is now walking around the tournament grounds, all grown up again in his base form, still having his tail (proving the wish wasn't reversed, because then his tail would have been gone) just before the end-credits come into play.   The question  If the Goku we see at the end turned SSJ4, would he get old and die?  If Goku hadn't become a child and grown up again because of Ultimate Shenron's magic, he presumably would be dead of old age by the time of the finale just like everyone else is. But as we saw before, if he turns SSJ4, Ultimate Shenron's magic wears off and doesn't affect him anymore. So is Ultimate Shenron's magic the only thing keeping him alive? Without it, would he become old and die like he would have if it had never affected him in the first place? "

2276,Why isn't anime critically analyzed like other forms of literature or entertainment?,"In high school English classes, we read many classics, such as Shakespeare, Steinbeck, Lee, etc. In many other classes, popular TV shows and movies are analyzed. Granted, these are also classics, such as Hitchcock's Psycho or Nichols' The Graduate.  Why is anime/manga not as critically analyzed by the general public, like other works of written/illustrated art are? There are a lot of different forums that review anime and many people on the internet who have their opinions on different shows, but why is it not recognized by the general American public like other literary works? Is it its age (it is still popular, and therefore not old enough to be considered a classic)? Is the fact that it is seen as a cartoon by many in the US? Is it due to negative stereotypes in the west surrounding anime (many may consider all anime to be hentai, for example, and therefore disregard it as an art form)?  EDIT: To explain this more...many, many anime have underlying themes and meanings that stretch sometimes deeper than current novels/books that are considered literary classics by the academic community. So, why aren't these shows studied and analyzed in an academic setting? For example, if I am in a high school/college film analysis class, why is the medium of anime not considered when picking source material to analyze?  A few of these shows I think you can find deeper meaning in easily (and this part is subjective, you may disagree), with similarities drawn to novels that are considered classics:   Ping Pong: The Animation: allows the viewer to determine the definition of success (similar to Invisible Man) Attack on Titan: comments on the human experience, portrays reality with a hunter/prey dynamic (just like Lord of the Flies) Fooly Cooly: coming of age story (just like Catcher in the Rye)   Many others can be listed, and the above shows can be analyzed much, much further.  Sorry for the poor tag, couldn't find one that was applicable. "
2277,How much of an influence/reference/relation Love Hina and Shakespeare was to Nisekoi?,"Both share way more elements in common than two random shounen shows. Digging into the preferences, sources and/or backgrounds of the author of Nisekoi, how much of Love Hina's influence can be found?  Both shows have the following in common:   Childhood Marriage Promise: The centerpiece of both plots is a blurred promise. Love Hina's is both a marriage promise and a college proposal, but has almost the same weight. Note that several other animes (hit TVTropes for the list) have it too, but not as the centerpiece for the love story.   Naru and Chitoge are almost the same person.    Tsundere? Check.  In love with the lead male? Check.  Denies affection to the deathbed? Check.  Hits lead male when some gag puts them in an awkward situation? Check. Hair antennae? Check. (Chitoge's is actually her headband, but is indeed an antennae). Probably the one that made the promise? Check.  Raku and Keitaro are similar too, but as far as shounen lead males go, they are all the same person by design. So not too much here.   My point is, if you swap the Nisekoi setting from a high school to a boarding house, and remove the Romeo &amp; Juliet elements, you have Love Hina.  Looking for credible sources. "

2279,"With animation being so time consuming, why are hairstyles so spiky and complex?","From my basic understanding, anime (or any animation) is drawn frame-by-frame. With that in mind, why are countless character designs made with spiky hair and other complex parts such as chains, intricate design patterns, etc?   An animator would have to re-draw every single strand and detail which would take longer for the animation to be made, so therefore I thought there would be less flamboyant hairstyles yet they prove me wrong every season, in fact each design being even MORE complex. Why? "

2282,"Why is pornographic anime and manga referred to as ""hentai"" by non-Japanese sources? And when did it start?","If you try to google ""hentai definition"" most result would define hentai as a Japanese genres of manga and anime with sexually explicit images and plots. But Wikipedia explains it otherwise:     In Japanese, the term describes any type of perverse or bizarre sexual desire or act; it does not represent a genre of work.       Internationally, hentai is a catch-all term to describe a genre of anime and manga pornography.   And from this question we know that the word hentai never means anime porn in Japan.      No, hentai is a typical ""英製和語"" that has gained a totally different meaning outside of Japan. It never means anime porn in Japan.   From that question, OP mentioned that it was originated from 4chan, but from some comment on that question, the word it self was already in use for Japanese animation porn long before 4chan.  So how come non-Japanese refer to anime and manga pornography as hentai? And when did it start? "

Nov 22nd 2010 - Nov 20th 2011. 8th place by selling 4,187,258 copies.      November 21, 2011 to November 18, 2012. 12th place by selling 2,974,750 copies.   However, unlike in the below chart, the sales popularity seems to remain consistently above 2.5 Mil, until 2016, where it dropped to 2.2 Mil. Suggesting it's popularity just normalized, instead of really 'dropping'  So what really happened to Bleach? Did it really suffer from a significant drop in popularity as shown in the graph below? Or is this just misinterpreted data by a user?   "
2292,"What's the ""super saiyan hair"" power in Tiger and Bunny?","In the Tiger &amp; Bunny wikia, one of the powers the heroes can have it's called ""super saiyan hair"" and it gives the user the appareance of a super saiyan, with spiky coloured hair and an aura and it also mentions a similarity with Dragon Ball's kaioken. What's this power about? Which advantages does it give to the user? "
2293,Why does the Aburame clan cover their eyes?,"The explanation in Naruto Wikia was not sufficient so I decided to go through the trouble to ask here. :)  Given that the defining traits of an Aburame is to wear something to cover their eyes and to dignify their whole body, why is it that they cover their eyes in the first place? Whilst, the other noble clans like Uchiha and Hyuga never covers theirs? Does covering their eyes boost their power? Or does it have to do with the insects getting on their eyes? Or might it be that their eyes are not presentable or not to be shown to the public?  Any philosophies that might shed light to the importance of protecting the Aburame clan's mysterious eyes? "
2294,What are the deeper meanings in Berserk?,"I'm referencing the first season of Berserk in this question, not the new 2016 continuation (I haven't finished that yet, so please don't spoil it for me).  As I've been watching Berserk, I've noticed that I enjoy two aspects of the show. I love how gory and action-driven the show is (the fight scenes are awesome), but I also enjoy the deeper meanings that the show portrays with its character development and plot. For example, I like the general coming-of-age style of Guts' narrative, and I have noticed other religious motifs throughout the show.  However, I haven't been able to explicitly ""nail down"" the big themes. I was wondering if anyone could extract the most prevalent themes from the show and help explain them to me (similar to critical analysis in a college-level literacy class). What are the deeper meanings in Berserk? Does it have to do with religion? Friendship? Loss? Life purpose and direction? Is it commenting on history and war? "
2295,"After the journey is over, why did Maetel go for another journey?","In final episode of Galaxy express 999 (episode 113), after Tetsuro &amp; Maetel destroy planet Peuromesyum, Maetel left Tetsuro behind just to guide another boy to the future (or something). But the whole reason she had to travel was, just so she can 'provide' that boy to her mother. So I'm wondering after this thing is over, why does she still need to travel? Can't she just wind up with Tetsuro?  "
2296,What is Himeka Akishino's relation to Eita in Oreshura?,"It was stated that she was Eita's lover from his ""past life"". But how is she related to Eita? Was she a childhood friend or an old classmate of Eita from the preschool? "
2297,"What does ""plus ultra"" mean in My Hero Academia","The credits for My Hero Academia add ""plus Ultra"" after the series name.  Occasionally All Might shouts ""plus Ultra!"" as sort of a battle cry when he is about to strike a foe.  From context, I guess it means ""extra power"" or ""boost"", but ""plus ultra"" seem so random. Is there more meaning to the two words than this? Is this just something which does not translate well from Japanese? "
2298,Does Kale have 2 or 3 transformations already?,"The Dragon Ball Wikia (which isnt an official Dragon Ball Source) claims Kale have 3 transformations,  1 Berserker Super Saiyan  2 Super Saiyan Perfect Energy Control (this name isnt even mentioned in the series)   3 True Legendary Super Saiyan  Now the supposed transformations 2 and 3 look very similar, personally I cant really tell if they are different transformations. The Dragon Ball Wikia claims they are slightly different in color at least (green vs yellowish brownish green) This difference could even be simply a different animator. My question therefore is, does Kale have 2 or 3 transformations already? Can you tell differences between the supposed transformations 2 and 3? "
2299,How does Origami Cyclone defeat his enemies if he only can copy NEXT bodies but not their powers?,"Even though Origami Cyclone is the heroe with less points, just below Wild Tiger, he has some hundred points meaning he had to achieve some successful tasks as a heroe. But he can copy NEXT bodies but not their powers, which isnt much useful at all for combat. How does Origami Cyclone defeat his enemies if he only can copy NEXT bodies but not their powers? Or is he supposed to make only rescue missions or something? "

Video 1  However, in this other video with english subtitles, about Kefura's fight vs Goku, Vados says:     .. and their power increases tens of times.

2303,What actually happened with sword maiden and her goblins?,"In Chapter 29, the sword maiden seems to ""know"" something that she didn't share with Goblin Slayer's team.  What is it? Is the goblin brought by the sword maiden? Did the sword maiden betray all the adventurers? They mentioned something about no rat quests. Why? Is it related?  If the sword maiden knew that and didn't tell the adventurers wouldn't that mean the sword maiden risk the adventurers' life unnecessarily? Isn't that betrayal. "
2304,Is a double fusion possible?,We know that there are 2 possible ways of performing a fusion.   Potara earrings Fusion dance   Is it possible to combine these 2?  For example we have 4 individuals. They form 2 pairs which are perfectly synced with each other for the fusion dance. Once fused they wear each a potaro earring resulting in the second fusion. Is this actually possible? If potara earrings can't be used on a fused body then we can have 2 sets of earrings for the pairs. The fused ones perform the dance for the final fusion.  
2305,"Why do we hear ""English"" speech in Philadelphia in episode 3?","In episode 1 of Time Travel Shoujo, it is established that Mari can communicate freely with local folk when she travels back in time. For example, when she travels back to 1600 and meets William Gilbert, she perceives Gilbert's speech as being in Japanese, and Gilbert perceives her speech as being in English. The audio itself is fully in Japanese during Mari's sojourn in Gilbert's time.  However, in episode 3, something curious happens. Mari has been sent back to the year 1752 and meets Benjamin Franklin. Again, she is able to understand him and vice versa. At around 14:37, though, we hear two background characters say the following in English audio:     GIRL: Rain, rain, go away! Come again on Saturday!      WOMAN: Good, Laura!      GIRL: Thank you very much!   To be clear, what I mean is that the viewer hears roughly 「レイン、レイン、ゴーア　ウェイ。　カム　アゲイン　オン　サターデイ。」 and so forth - the voice actor for the girl has a strong Japanese accent, but she's very clearly saying English words (ones that aren't loans into Japanese, in particular).  Now, why is that? Is there some sort of plot-related reason why Mari's ""babel fish"" didn't work on these two background characters? (The show pointedly addressed the idea of instantaneous translation during Mari's supplementary lessons earlier in episode 3, so I suspect this isn't just a goofup.) "

2309,"Did Kakashi eventually surpass Itachi, Jiraiya, Tsunade, and Orochimaru?","In the Naruto manga, Kakashi Hatake has been acknowledged by both Jiraiya and Tsunade to be one of Konoha's most powerful shinobi. But Kakashi himself had confessed that Orochimaru was on a completely different level from him, who in turn openly acknowleged that Itachi Uchiha was more powerful than him. Obito Uchiha was noted to be more powerful than any other Uchiha except Madara Uchiha, whom Kakashi defeated.   My question is, at the time when Kakashi defeated Obito, had he surpassed all of Tsunade, Jiraya, Orochimaru and Itachi? Is there any reference in the manga itself from which a definite answer can be given, either in the affirmative or in the negative?    Note:- Before posting any answer to the question please read most (if not all) of the answers that's already posted below. "
2310,How can I check that a given anime is really over?,"I have been frustrated recently when I watch the last existing episode of a given anime only to find out that the story is not over yet, and I will have to wait for another season (and who knows when that would be). Examples:   No Game No Life Ao no Exorcist Made in Abyss Gakusen Toshi Asterisk   Checking No Game No Life in MyAnimeList, for example, I can see:        Status: Finished Airing   No other anime listed as ""sequel""      I went to watch it, thinking it would be a full story in those 12 episodes, but guess what? The story is not over at all. Now here I am waiting for another season, that I don't even know when will come, if at all...  I know that whether a next season will be produced or not can't be predicted. The producers might decide it's not worth it for whatever reason. But some animes simply frustratingly end in the middle of the story. I was hoping that there was a place I could search for this information (if the anime is currently completed or ""paused/canceled"" in the middle of it). For example, I wouldn't have watched No Game No Life if I knew beforehand it was like that.  Since MAL's status of ""Status: Finished Airing"" is not what I want, how can I check that an anime is really over?  Notes: for my purposes, animes like Code Geass and Steins;Gate are to be considered complete, even though both of them have a new season coming, the already existing story is 100% complete (of course I only know this because I already watched them). "
2311,What does these non-numbered Monogatari novel's chapter title means?,"Based on Wikipedia, each English volume for the Monogatari novel book has its own chapter title, for example:   Chapter Zero Chapter One Chapter Two Chapter Three Chapter Four Chapter Five Chapter Six Final Chapter  Chapter Nixed Chapter Snug Chapter Idle Chapter Change Chapter Chaos   Basically, I roughly understand what does 'Chapter Zero' to 'Final Chapter' mean, I assume it is just for chronological meaning.  However, what does 'Chapter Nixed, Snug, Idle, Change, Chaos' mean? Any meaning behind why it is named after those 'term'?  Why don't they just name it 'Chapter Seven' and so on? And for Hanamonogatari, hana (花) means ""flower"", but why is its chapter named 'Chapter Change' instead of 'Chapter Flower'? "
2312,Did Hitoshi (alien-san) gain the ability to feel emotions at the end of the Kashimashi OVA?,"At the end of the OVA, Hitoshi and Namiko are shown together, about to kiss before they vanish.    Does this mean that Hitoshi was ""cured"" of his inability to feel emotions?   Does this also mean that the 35 year streak of Namiko is about to end?  NOTE: I am talking strictly about the Anime (OVA) here. The wikia pages (for Namiko and Hitoshi) seem to be either incomplete or based on the manga, so don't base your answer off of them. "

But now he's being beaten and he didnt activate Mastered Ultra Instinct. Before, he showed he could activate Mastered Ultra Instinct when stressed. Can Goku activate Mastered Ultra Instinct at will? Does the manga show something about it? "
2314,Does Trunks know how to fire a Kamehameha?,"I was watching this segment from a non canon movie (which is known to have some animation mistakes such as Krilin's ""Super Saiyan"" aura) and Trunks seems to do the pose, and he says the words like someone firing a Kamehameha.  I was wondering if his  Kamehameha scream was something made up by the dub, or if it was in the original Japanese audio, and in the case Trunks was genuinely made to fire a Kamehameha in the movie, if this is congruent with the series or does just Trunks supposedly know how to fire a Kamehameha only in the non canon universe?

Youtube video 1  This another video from a spanish speaking dragon ball youtuber with close to 600,000 suscribers also mentions Toei released a video 3 months ago saying than Caulifla has an infinite potential.   Youtube video 2  Now I havent found the original video which is in japanese, but this screencapture from the video shows in japanese the word ""power"" and the word ""infinite"" next to an image of Caulifla    What does that original video from Toei says, have anyone seen it? Or at least this japanese text? is it Caulifla power infinite? "
2317,Why are there four graves when Ciel first comes home?,"  Spoilers below for those who haven't read Chapter 129.   When Ciel first comes home with Sebastian,      why are there 4 graves when only 3 people died (Vincent, Rachel, and Real!Ciel)?   So why would there be four? Could it be that they're pre-made?

2318,Which kind of features do the armors the heroes use have?,"So in episode 2 of season 1 Tiger is shown by the armor designer that his new armor is more resistant, apparently. Tiger has x100 times resistant by himself, so I wonder if this resistant increases his superpower resistant or is it meant for him to have protection when he isnt using his powers. What other features do they have? I've seen they fire extremely hard wires and how about strenght? do they increase strenght? To summarize the question is,   Which kind of features do the armors the heroes use have? "

For example if they use their bender to control earth/ground, like making a wall using their bender, does it make an empty room below the wall ?   Does it make the ground unstable or possibility of erosion ? In my mind, the earth/ground is like a puzzle that, or am I wrong ?  Here some demonstration:    Or when they trying to close the pit from the result of their earth bender ability, does it make more complicated ?    Relevant video on YouTube, watch at 1:20 - 2:05 "
2320,How is possible Moro can defeat super saiyan blues but Majin Buu can fight him?,"Ok, so Moro can't absorb Majin Buu ki like he did with Goku and Vegeta. That still doesnt explain why at the begining of the fight when Vegeta power wasnt absorbed yet, he could fight at the level of him. Is Moro actually weak and his powerful magic attacks is energy borrowed from the Earth and magic and stuff? That still doesnt explain his resistance to hold a super saiyan blue. Does he have magic tricks for increasing his resistance with characters who dont have magic? Did Majin Buu grow stronger than a SSJ3? The question which sums it all up is,  How is possible Moro can defeat super saiyan blues but Majin Buu can fight him? "

2323,Tokyo ghoul's Kaneki's change in hair color,"When Kaneki's hair turned from brown to white, was it because because of the stress ? Or maybe because of his change of heart. A lot of anime and manga use hair-colors to describe someones personality, so maybe it was symbolic like, his hair turned white because he admitted that he has to change his personality..

However, what would happen if they wish to not become a magical girl instead? (Perhaps only Madoka knows)  I was thinking if Kyubey would explode or refuse the wish, but what if he didn't refuse? "

2327,Who is Mizuki in SawanoHiroyuki[nZk]:mizuki?,"I really liked the songs sung by ""Mizuki"" of SawanoHiroyuki[nZk]:mizuki in the Aldnoah Zero opening/ending/insert songs, so I tried looking for other songs that she sang.  However, I can't seem to find anything on her. The main issue is a one word name is very ambiguous, and so googling ""Mizuki"" or ""Mizuki singer"" brings up a lot of results for Nana Mizuki and other singers with Mizuki in their names.   If I google ""Mizuki aldnoah zero"", which disambiguates my query a bit, then the problem is that I just get all the songs she produced for Aldnoah Zero, which I am already well aware of.   So does the Mizuki in question go by the name ""Mizuki"", in which case, any tips for differentiating her from other singers with ""Mizuki"" in their names?   Or does she go by a full name that got omitted in SawanoHiroyuki[nZk]:mizuki or a completely different one?   Or is she just only producing music under the name SawanoHiroyuki[nZk]:mizuki? (I ask this because Aimer still has songs under her own name even though she collaborated with Hiroyuki Sawano as SawanoHiroyuki[nZk]:Aimer)  "
2328,What was the history of the Tailed Beasts (Bijuu) before the formation of the Hidden Villages?,"The founding of the Hidden Villages only goes back about 100 years. The same goes for the sealing of the Tailed Beasts. So is there any back history on them? Did they go on rampage a lot? Did they just ignore everything and it were the shinobi that discovered how to seal the beasts into themselves, to use as a tool of war? Or was it something else? "

2333,Does the winner of the election become king immediately?,"Does the winner of the election become king immediately? Or do they merely become heir apparent, to succeed Souichirou when he retires/dies?   I ask, because in episode 12,       we learn that Shuu has won the election. Was the ceremony at the end of episode 12 a proper coronation for him? Or was it just a ""congratulations, you're the heir, now wait a few decades"" type of thing?

2336,Is Holo different from other nonhumans?,"It seems to me that the introduction of nonhumans who aren't wolves introduced a break from the initial premise, and additionally it seems that all other nonhumans don't clearly have all of the attributes Holo and Myuri have, so I'd like some clarification.  From the initial story, Holo claimed to be a wolf, and she seemed to indicate kinship with other wolves. To be clear, she identifies mainly as a wolf, not a human, and her human form is treated as a guise. My understanding of this initially was that it indicated all wolves in this world were at human level intelligence, or at least smarter than normal animals, and might have the potential to take human forms. However, this assumption was probably wrong since there are shown to be avatars of birds, sheep, etc.   With regard to these other nonhumans, there seem to be differences to Holo. Firstly, Holo has the attribute of living in and having power over wheat (also, she is required to eat it to transform back into a wolf). I don't recall other nonhumans having any similar trait disclosed. Secondly, I haven't seen in the others the aforementioned kinship that Holo has for wolves. Our two sheep, for instance, are quite disrespectful to regular sheep. In volume 10 of Spice and Wolf,       we learn that the golden sheep has been eating sheep in order to fit  in to human society.   Then in volume 3 of Wolf and Parchment, after offering to buy mutton for Myuri and Col, on page 188 Ilenia goes on to explain, ""They look like kin, but in the end we're very different."" These two, and Ilenia definitively, don't seem to view the regular sheep as their kin. In contrast to Holo, they don't seem to identify themselves as sheep (though they also don't identify as human).  Holo's attitude couldn't be any more different from these two sheep. In fact, on page 168 of volume 10 of Spice and Wolf, she throws up after learning that the golden sheep has been eating sheep.  Another point of note, the new Spice and Wolf: Spring Log books have introduced two new wolves: Selim and her brother Aram. What is the significance of these two being able to hide their ears and tails in their human transformations when Holo cannot? Is there a difference between these two and Holo or are they all the same kind of ""wolf""?  So, for clarification, is Holo the same kind of entity as the rest of these nonhumans? Do these other nonhumans have powers over things like wheat but they keep their affinity secret, or do they lack these traits? Is the kinship Holo feels for the wolves merely a difference in attitude or does it indicate that she is a different kind of being? "
2337,Is Beerus able to use Ultra Instinct?,"When Goku first activated Ultra Instinct Beerus looked pretty worried. Is this because he has yet to unlock Ultra Instinct?  Whis described that is even for gods difficult to attain it. Beerus is a god of destruction. Meaning that it is difficult to attain even for gods indirectly indicates that not all gods have Ultra Instinct unlocked yet. If this is true, is Beerus one of them then?  "

They have the most powerful fighter for now, Jiren (Goku might surpass him eventually but for now he doesnt) and 2 other fighters who might be at the level of Vegeta or Freezer.   Now why Jiren is meditating if it's obvious Toppo and Dyspo wont be able to reduce all other universes to 2 or less fighters, universes which includes fighters in their level or above, like Vegeta, Freezer, 17, Gohan, Kale, etc.   How does universe 11 expect to win with their current strategy? is there any way they can win going like this?

I watched it once, a long time ago, on TV, when I didn't have internet. It was a lot of fun and holds a lot of memories.

2344,What's the story behind the intro of GITS:SAC soundtrack 08 - Velveteen borrowing a sample from Blade Runner (1982)?,"I just rewatched the original Blade Runner and noticed that in one of the scenes where the police sirens are heard (starts roughly at 01:26:30) is the exact same sound as the sirens from the track 08 - Velveteen of GITS:SAC soundtrack.  It's pretty much common knowledge that Ghost in the Shell universe and aesthetic was inspired in a large part by the previous works in sci-fi genre, Blade Runner especially. Is there any trivia about this specific sample being included into the track? As far as I know, clearing legal right for using audio clips from copyrighted works (like songs and movies) takes a lot of work. Was there any notable publicity about this?  Here's a video of the moment in the movie matched up with the track:  [website]"
2345,Who is this cat on Hunter X Hunter volume 32's cover?,"I have watched the anime version of Hunter x Hunter but I couldn't remember where or when I have seen this cat, who is this cat? Does the cat ever appear in the manga/anime ver. ?   "
2346,Is the birthday of Fuuka Akitsuki known?,"In the latest episodes, Yuu regrets not knowing the birthday of Fuuka (ch37 pg 16). Digging wikia, wikipedia, MAL, or just straight googling, nothing came up on her birthday.  Since she made cameos in two prequel series already, is her birthday known?  If her birthday is not know, can it be at least narrowed down to a season or month from the source material? "
2347,Are Erina Nakiri and Sōma Yukihira relatives?,"In the anime, Nakiri is waiting for Jōichirō Yukihira to come, why is that? Is it possible that Nakiri is related to Soma? Because we don't know anything about their mothers?  "
2348,"Who is faster, Flashy Flash or Speed-o'-Sound Sonic?","At some point in the webcomic, the speed of Flashy Flash's attack is given: it takes a centisecond to perform each attack. I suppose his speed can be calculated if you know the distance of his attacks. I don't know if Speed-o'-Sound Sonic's speed is given or it can be calculated, though it probably has to be over the speed of sound, right?  Who is faster, Flashy Flash or Speed of Speed-o'-Sound Sonic? "
2349,"Which version of One Punch Man is more expanded, the webcomic or the manga?","So, I've been reading the One Punch Man webcomic after Garou defeated Tank Top Master. I haven't read the manga but only small segments which appear in Youtube reviews and things like that. Which version of One Punch Man is more expanded, the webcomic or the manga? Am I missing something by reading the webcomic only, or are manga readers missing something by reading only the manga? "
2350,Can Sea Prism Stones be cut or broken?,I know sea prism stones are extremely hard and can't remember any moment where I have seen anyone to cut or break them. If someone is cuffed with them and he or she happens to be extremely powerful and not a devil fruit eater can he or she break it? Can a swordsman cut it? 
2351,Are parodied scenes in the Monogatari anime described in the light novel?,"In many scenes of Monogatari series, sometimes a character's art style changes because they were acting like other anime characters. Examples are given in the images below.       Are these scenes described in the original source (light novel) when their faces changed into other anime/manga characters? For example, when Araragi (left-bottom image) said:     I didn't fail to pay it!   he is parodying Kaiji's face from the anime Kaiji: Ultimate Survivor:     Then does the light novel have a passage like this (for example):     ""I didn't fail to pay it"", while my face turned into Kaiji's serious look.   or were these scenes originally made just for the anime version?    The reason why I think about this is that there is a scene in No Game No Life that matches between the anime and light novel like below:     ""I refuse!"" Blurting out these words caused her eyes to widen in response.      ""Could you...... tell me your reason?""       ""Hehe, that's because....."" Sora hugged his little sister who was watching with an expression that could not be discerned.      ""One of our most favoritethings for 『 』 is—""      ""Standing in a position where the opponent has an advantage and denying it with a 'NO' !""      Shiro combined together. Originally unclear of the plot, Steph and Kurami could not arrange this reasoning properly. Only looking at the excited siblings while feeling stunned.      ""Wahaha! 'I always wanted to try and say the number four lines[19] ' —and I really said it out!""      "".......Nii, nice, good job.""   It's similar to the anime version. They also made this scene which is described in the light novel. (Sora said a phrase which originally came from Kishibe Rohan's statement, a side character of Jojo's Bizarre Adventure: Diamond Is Unbreakable.    "
2352,How does Hisoka see Gon exactly? As a rival or as a toy to entertain himself?,"Hisoka hinted that Gon is his treasure and also his prey, but it can't be both, right? Because in the end, he didn't want Gon to die no matter what.  So it's weird that he didn't want Gon to die but also made him his prey to fight till death. Is it sexual for Hisoka or what? I still remember the 'Schwing' thing. "
2353,How can Pikachu speak now?,"In this clip from the new movie I choose you, it appears that Pikachu speaks natural language.   There is a clip of it in English on YouTube (speaks around 35 seconds)  I haven't seen the movie yet, but I'm interested to know how is the ability to speak explained? I remember that there was one time where the Unowns were dubbing the Pokemon, is this something similar? "
2354,What anime's/manga's character that araragi parodying?,What character did Araragi parodying at this scene ? is this a mascot of japan or something ? or maybe a character from anime/manga ?   
2355,What is the magazine the Dark Lord reads?,"In Hataraku Maou-sama!, there is a magazine that appears in the Dark Lord's apartment on more than one occasion. It seems to read something like ""yoride-FF"".      Is this any existing magazine, or a reference to some existing magazine, with a distorted name (like MgRonald)? If so, what is its genre/target audience/content? Or is it a completely non-existing magazine? "
2356,How Genjutsu works?,"As I understand Genjutsu is, affecting the opponent's chakra network with your own chakra through some medium, and create illusions in their mind. It's basically 'Yin Release' through some medium. Incase of Sharingan users, it's done through eyesight. They can cast Genjutsu when the opponent see the caster's Sharingan. That way they imply their chakra into the opponent's body.  Incase of Sage Toads and Tayuya, It's through sound. So, whoever is within the range could be affected by the Genjutsu.  The question is, Is there any other way to cast Genjutsu ? How come Kurunei is able to cast Genjutsu? Is it through eyes? "
2357,Why was Hideaki Anno picked to voice Jirou in The Wind Rises?,"Hideaki Anno is a well-known animator and director. He is not, however, a well-known voice actor. Prior to 2013, he appears to have a total of two voice-acting credits to his name - a minor character in FLCL and a minor character in Abenobashi Mahou Shoutengai. There's nothing terribly surprising about either of those - both were created by Gainax while he worked there; I'm sure nobody objected to letting their ace director have some fun in the recording studio.   Then, for some reason, Anno was cast as the adult voice of Jirou Horikoshi, the protagonist of Miyazaki's The Wind Rises. Why?   I know that Miyazaki has never been a fan of hiring from the usual stable of anime voice actors, but you'd think he'd at least want somebody who had some experience in the field... "
2358,Why were most of the characters' names changed in the dubs?,"In the anime Captain Tsubasa (I don't know if this is the most well-known name, since I knew it as ""Campeões: Oliver e Benji"", its Portuguese dub name), most of the characters' names were changed when the series was dubbed.    For instances, in the Portuguese dub, these are some of the names that were changed:     Ozora Tsubasa - Oliver Tsubasa     Genzo Wakabayashi - Benji Price     Ryo Ishizaki - Bruce Ishizaki     Taro Misaki - Toby Misaki (or Tobi Misaki)     Kojirou Hyuga - Mark Landers     Jun Misugi - Julian Ross     Hikaru Matsuyama - Philip Matsuyama     Shingo Aoi - Shingo Au     Nakazawa Sanae - Patrícia Sanae (usually called Patty)  From what I know, almost every dub (if not every single one) changed some names when the series was dubbed. I also know that some of the changes were different from dub to dub.    Were these changes something that happened because every dub 'team' decided to change the names? Or was it something that happened in the first dub, and that all the other dubs decided to follow (possibly because they were dubbed from the dub, instead of the original), unaware of the changed names?  Also, provided that the list is not too extensive, what names were changed in what dubs? "
2359,What was it that Yevon did to the Al Bhed?,"In Final Fantasy X, after being transported to Bikinel Desert by Sin and reunited, Rikku goes to tell the party where they are     Rikku: i know where we are, but you have to keep it a secret, especially from Yevonites   Wakka: What are you accusing Yevon of this time?   Rikku: Yevon did something really terrible to us before   however all Rikku says at Home is that Sin destroyed the island they came from and it was her father Cid who gathered the separated Al Bhed to build Home. i don't recall Rikku explaining what Yevon did to the Al Bhed, is it stated anywhere what Yevon did? "
2360,Why is Moral holding a golden gun in Episode 7?,"In the last scene of episode 7,       Moral was pointing a golden gun at Art.     But in the beginning of episode 8,       Moral is seen to be holding a normal black gun.     Why is he holding a different gun? Does this have any implications to the story?  "
2361,Why did they censor the word spam?,"On OVA episode 2, when all the girls went camping, Yukari showed her collection, rations from different countries, some of Rabbit Team girls started to yell *pam, *pam, *pam, which is I guess come from word spam. But why they censored the word? How could it become something like ""eggs, bacon, sausage, and spam""? "
2362,What happen to Orochimaru and his team after the war ended?,"We all know Naruto has ended. But seriously, what happen to Orochimaru and his team, Suigetsu, Juugo, and Karin? What did Sasuke do to them? "
2363,What kind of modifications the AE86's have had in Initial D?,"I am not that interested in automotive (aviation all the way DC-3) but after seeing ""Pimp My Reich"" (I strongly suggest you to watch it, the ending is great) I learned there is a manga and an anime called Initial D. As I learned, there were 3 AE86's in the whole series but what about the modifications? Were ""performance"" modifications ever used in the series? They can be simple engine part replacements or whole engine/aspiration type replacements.  Simply put: did anyone of the AE86's had any kind of performance mods? Also I want to make a replica of it in racing sims. So should I use carbon fiber or black painting for the hood? What is the history of hood part replacement throughout the series? "
2364,"Why does Tetsuo say ""I am Tetsuo"" at the end of Akira?","At the end of Akira, there is a massive power release; then:      Tetsuo manages to gain full control over his powers, and these abilities end up creating a new Big Bang in another dimension.   After this event, Tetsuo says the following: ""I am Tetsuo.""    Why did he say this? What meaning does it have? "
2365,What is the significance of the painting in The Girl Who Leapt Through Time?,"I've already kind of sorted out all the other mysteries of this movie but only this painting thing is killing me.    What is that painting? What's the story behind it? Why does it actually exist in the first place? And most importantly, what is the relationship between Chiaki and that painting? "
2366,Is Panzerfahren only for girls?,"In the anime series, all the Panzerfahren participants are girls. Are there any guys who also participate in Panzerfahren? And if I recall correctly, all schools that participate in Panzerfahren are also all-girl schools. Is there any rule of Panzerfahren that all participants must be girls? "
2367,Why do Saber and Rin sound disappointed when they see inside Shiro's shed?,"In the anime (and also in the visual novel when you make the correct choice), Shiro walks out and overhears Rin and Saber talking. They sound disappointed (maybe even angry) about a discovery they make in the shed Shiro practices in when he does reinforcement on stuff.  Is this in relation to his Unlimited Blade Works Reality Marble and how he has been unknowingly been doing something very wrong when he uses Reinforcement/Projection? Or, is there something else in that shed that Kiritsugu left, and never told Shiro about (like the Crest on the floor which activated when summoning Saber)? "
2368,What is the Pair ingredient in Toriko?,I've read those chapters over and over and I still don't understand what Pair is.  Was it a fruit that was eaten by a monkey and it became its testicles? Was it monkey testicles in the first place that got removed and put in the tree?  
2369,What is the name of the song that plays at 12:40 in Noragami Aragoto episode 12?,What is the name of the song that plays at 12:40 in Noragami Aragoto episode 12? It has a distorted female(?) voice and a flute themes. 
2370,"How were there 80,000 ninjas in the Shinobi World War in Naruto?","I have been watching Naruto anime for a few months and just started to watch Shinobi World War arc. I was shocked to see 80,000 ninjas assembled. Where did they come from? If we take into account that 5 countries and samurais make 6 countries total, each country would contribute around 12,000 ninjas. But only around 100 ninjas were seen in Konoha in the previous episodes. How did this number come from? Were they living in other villages under the orders of their respective Kage?  "
2371,Is Goku aware that he is in the UI state?,"Based on discussions, questions and answers, Goku achieves the UI state when he is at his limit. But when he achieves it, is he aware of that? Does he feel different? If so, then why doesn't he recreate the changes and feelings to control the state and use it more efficiently?  "
2372,Why doesn't Korra bend the metal on Kuvira's uniform?,"In the latest episode (S04E06, ""The Battle of Zaofu"") Korra fights Kuvira who wears the following uniform   (from avatar.wikia.com)  In the linked article it is also said that     While leading her army, Kuvira took to wearing a uniform with metal   strips on her back, biceps, and calves, for which she developed a   style of metalbending that involves bending the metal on her uniform   and shooting them off of like projectiles.   Now I was wondering: Can't Korra bend the metal on Kuvira's uniform and chain her (or subdue in another way)? Is this due to the fact that Kuvira already has control over the metal (as described in the wikia article)? "
2373,Why is Parasyte spelled with a y in the title?,"It is my understanding that the word parasite is spelled with an i and not a y. However, the title of the anime and manga, when translated into English, uses a y in the spelling. However, this only seems to apply to the title, since the species is referred to as ""parasites"" (at least throughout the wikipedia article) and Uda Mamoru calls his parasite as Parasite in episode 7:      Is there a reason for this misspelling? Or is there maybe a difference between ""parasyte"" and ""parasite""? "
2374,How well did Vampire Knight sell?,"I'm trying to get an all-around view of how popular the show/manga of Vampire Knight was.  A rather straightforward question, but how well did both the anime and manga sell?  Were they both popular? What was the account of units sold for the anime each season?  "
2375,What is the new shuriken formed from Naruto and Sasuke's power?,"In the end of chapter 634, the latest chapter of Naruto Shippuden, Naruto's shuriken and Sasuke's arrow mixed together and formed a new black kind of shuriken to attack the ten tails.  What kind of power does the new shuriken contain? It contains Naruto's Wind element, but which of Sasuke's powers does it contain?    Is it the ""Amaterasu"" OR ""Lightning"" element? "
2376,"Why is the name ""Harkonnen"" used on Seras' cannon in Hellsing?","After reading an interesting post on the ""anti-midian"" meaning of Seras' battle rifle/cannon thing, I would like to know what the motif of Vladimir Harkonnen from the ""Dune"" series has to do with her cannon?  Let me give you an example:     Alucard's awesome pistol ""The Jackal"" symbolizes Walter's future betrayal of Alucard because, in the Fred Forsyth book ""The Day of The Jackal"", the character The Jackal kills everyone who helped him make his forged documents and weapon as a way of covering his tracks as he tries to kill Charles De Gaulle. In the dream sequence where this motif is introduced, The Jackal comments, ""Never trust the man who makes your own weapon,"" which foreshadows Walter's betrayal.   So since Seras has two huge cannons that bear the Vladimir Harkonnen name and she even talks to Harkonnen in a trippy dream sequence, what kind of symbolism or motif does Harkonnen have in relation to the Hellsing universe? "
2377,How much of the Yumekui Merry manga was adapted into the anime?,"The anime series doesn't end conclusively:      With Mystletainn's defeat Merry's past is still unknown and ""Pharos"" Hercules's plans is still in motion being unaffected by Mystletainn's death.   So I am wondering, how much of the manga was adapted into the anime? And are there any deviations?    "
2378,What is Patti's nickname?,"It seems like all Dream Demons have a nickname in quotation:   ""Chaser"" John Doe ""Garden"" Engi Threepiece ""Pharos"" Hercules    (Not sure about Merry's or Mystletainn's though I suspect Merry's last-name, Nightmare, could be in quotation)  Earlier in the series Engi talks about her sister Patti who was drawn to the human world by ""Pharos"" Hercules lighthouse and suspected to have been killed by Mystletainn. However, I am wondering what Patti's nickname is? Since they're sisters is it the same or related to Engi's? "
2379,"Where is Maria's ""Double Contract"" referenced?","I read somewhere that Maria has a ""double contract"" with her Symphogear.  I searched on the TV episodes, but found nothing. Maybe it has to do with the fact that she can wield two different gears (Gungnir and Airgetlam).  So a few questions:   What is this ""Double Contract"" exactly? Why is it special? Where in canonical material is it talked about?  "
2380,Why is Gally's name localized as Alita?,"Battle Angel Alita is known as Gunnm in Japan, and Alita as Gally.  Why was the title and name of the series changed when it was localized? What other changes did they make from the original Japanese version? "
2381,Was Bakuman deliberately made to attract new manga artists in the industry?,"The manga and anime Bakuman talks about two middle school boys wanting to be published on a Shonen magazine. The anime clearly set a goal and create antagonists for narration purposes but the story explain rather accurately expectations, procedures and workloads of a real magazine.  Was Bakuman deliberately made and published on Shonen Jump to attract new artists in the industry? If so, are there any documented effect of this type of promotion nowadays, i.e. about more young people trying to join the industry? "
2382,"Was ""Snow Rondo"" all a dream or was there something more to it?","Near the end of the second OVA series (Patlabor: New Files), in the episode titled ""Snow Rondo"" (episode 14). At the end, Asuma Shinohara says it's not a dream and there are hints that it wasn't a dream, but also bits to indicate that didn't happen either.  Can anyone explain what exactly happened?    "
2383,What made Sekiguchi embarrassed when she was asked about cram school?,"In episode 6, there is a scene where Daiku, a former team member of Igo soccer, is getting bored with their inactivity in their club room. The conversation follows like this (read from left to right):           Daiku: Oh come on, everyone said they had cram school and left...   Daiku: And you're no fun, Sekiguchi   Sekiguchi is reading a book silently   Daiku: Don't you go to cram school, Sekiguchi?   Sekiguchi flips a page, looks at Daiku, then continues reading the book silently while being embarrassed   Daiku stares at Sekiguchi   Sekiguchi is getting more embarrassed   Daiku: You're joking!   Why was Daiku surprised all of sudden?  Relevant video on YouTube  "
2384,What did the Sailor Moon reference mean?,"In episode 5 - Ami Kawashima, after Taiga's encounter with Ami after school, Ryuji goes into Taiga's apartment later that evening to find out why she hasn't come down to have tea. He finds Taiga curled up in her blankets complaining about being short.  At one point she talks about Sailor Mercury's name but I don't really understand this. It could be because I grew up with the American English dub of Sailor Moon and Sailor Mercury's real name was Amy in that.  So I am wondering, what is Taiga talking about Sailor Mercury's and Ami's names and why is it a good thing they're similar? (In comparison to her other advantages mentioned, being taller and Kitamura's childhood friend.) "
2385,"What factors contributed to the ""golden age"" of anime?","The anime boom of the 1980s is considered, by many, the beginning of the ""golden age"" of anime.   What factors contributed to this boom? Where did it all start? Who were the major players?  What led to the end of this boom? How did we get to the so-called ""moe-boom"" we have today?   "
2386,What would have happened if Esdeath hadn't drunk all the demon extract?,"In Akame Ga Kill! I'm wondering why Esdeath drank all the demon extract. If she hadn't drunk the whole thing, could someone else have gained the power?  Can an Imperial Arms have 2 users at the same time? "
2387,Why does Mika go insane?,"What/who causes Lain's ""older sister"" Mika to go insane? What happened to her (physically and mentally)?   "
2388,What is the relation between the flowers and the heroines in ED sequence of Photokano?,"At the end of the ED sequence of Photokano, 7 main (?) heroines are shown.    Then in the next scene, at the same position, a pot of flower is shown for each of the girls.    What are the flowers shown in the screenshot? And how are they related to the heroines? "
2389,What fruit did they use to bath?,"On episode 9, Yasaburou and Kaisei went to bath, and they used some kind of citrus fruit like orange and put them inside the bath.  What fruit is this and why did they use it for bath? Does it have any relation with them being a tanuki? When they went to bath before with Akadama-sensei they didn't use this fruit.   "
2390,What happened at the end of the anime Berserk?,"This question and its answers will contain spoilers.  I just finished watching Berserk (the original, not the 2016 continuation), and was able to follow the plot up until the second to last episode.       At that point, the ground turned into faces and almost all of the main characters got killed. Griffith turned into a weird bat-thing. It seemed like Casca was raped, and Guts lost an eye and an arm.   What is this weird scenario? What happened? How does the plot actually end? Why did Griffith transform? Can someone just explain what happened in the last two episodes of the series (the conclusion)? "
2391,Where does the Future Boy Conan movie fit in?,Future Boy Conan is a 26 episode TV series and a hour or so long movie. Where does the movie fit into the TV series? Is the movie a retelling of the series? Is it a side-story or a sequel? 
2392,What was Sora Iro no Tane advertising?,"One of the earliest Ghibli works, Sora Iro no Tane or The Sky-Colored Seed, was an advertisement broadcast on Japanese TV in 1992.  This little green dude seems to be the mascot of the product, he seems to be a pig:    I can't find any information about what it was advertising originally, and I can't draw a logical conclusion from the show.  Does anyone know what it was advertising? And how were the animation clips relevant? "
2393,How are short anime scheduled to be broadcast in Japan?,"Normally, anime is about 23 minutes long. With the addition of ads, it will take about 30 minutes for one episode to air which is what one time slot normally is. Yet, some anime like Miss Monochrome and Tonari no Seki-kun are not 23 minutes long. They are just around 6 minutes long, approximately a quarter the length.  How are these shows scheduled? Do they air along with other short anime so that they can make a total of 30 minutes in a time slot? "
2394,Why does Rudeus keep using Zariff’s Arm?,"Since Rudeus's arm got regenerated      after he accepted becoming Dragon God Orstred's collaborator(?),   he's seen using the Zariff’s Arm when he fights one of the North Style Emperors. Why? Is there a specific reason that he keeps using it? "
2395,"Before the era of Naruto, One Piece and Bleach being published simultaneously, was there ever another well-defined ""Holy Trinity"" of Manga?","I recall a few years ago (around 2011) the phrase ""holy trinity"" being thrown around to describe the size, magnitude and importance of One Piece, Bleach, and Naruto all running in Shonen Jump.  Now, with two of those specific publications* ending, this so-called ""holy"" trinity is no more.  However, there would've had to have been three other manga that were considered something like this before, right?  Was there was such a confirmed trinity of manga that ran together?  It doesn't necessarily have to be from Shonen Jump, but the closest unsourced examples from the '90s were Dragon Ball, Slam Dunk!, and Yu Yu Hakusho, which were likely published in a shonen-oriented magazine.  *: This doesn't include Boruto.  That isn't Naruto. "
2396,What is the meaning of the Yellow balls in the second episode of Denki-Gai?,"One of the events of the episode is rolling a huge yellow ball. Hiotan is chosen to represent Umanohone, and there is some gag I did not get by that part.  What is the yellow ball supposed to represent?  Why is Hiotan embarassed and obviously aroused by the balls?  Why Hiotan says she can't be a bride anymore, after being trampled by one of the balls? "
2397,Protagonist saves the world by killing monsters by transforming into different mecha using disks,"I'm looking for an old anime which I watched when I was young, during the 90s. As far as I can remember:   The earth is flat in the story The storyline is about this protagonist trying to save the world by killing monsters by transforming into different mecha?  The protagonist transform by inserting a disk (?) into a device on his hand At the end of the first arc, the world isn't restored, and the protagonist had to return all the disks he collected to their original place Each time a disk is returned, one of the bad dudes will turn back to normal To make things clearer, it is the protagonist himself transforming  "
2398,What dictates who can use what magic in Fairy Tail?,"I know we have met a few people with a few types, but they tend to relate and many mages stick to one kind.   I mean I know Dragon Slayers have their own set of rules going, but Mashima has never dictated that if other magic is a straight up a hereditary thing or not.   So could Lucy learn how to use Cana's cards since they are both object mages? Or is these something that prevents her from that? But on the other hand she was able to use Urano Metria, a caster spell, which was unusual.   Why don't mages learn a bit of healing magic or something similarly useful; even if they can only use these spells at a limited low level they would help a little bit.   So what exactly is keeping one mage from learning other magic? Is it just plot? Easier to study just one? "
2399,How could Obito transport his body parts in another dimension without bleeding?,"I have a question that's been bothering me for a while. I know that Naruto is supposed to be a manga written for teens and pre-teens so some stuff doesn't have any explanation or represents a plothole, but still I would really like to know whether this question has a reasonable answer or not. How can Obito transport his body parts in another dimension without the person that passes through him getting blood over his/her entire body? And why doesn't the body just collapse with the head being in another dimension? "
2400,Have the Mugiwara pirates ever cashed in a Pirate for a bounty reward?,"Is the ""Bounty System"" in One Piece really necessary? I mean I have never really seen anyone get the bounty reward after capturing and handing the Pirate to the Marines.  Is there any episode where someone actually claimed the money after catching some pirates? What I know is Zorro's previous occupation was ""bounty hunting"", but did Zorro ever get the money?  Are there any episodes in One Piece that interpret how the procedure of taking the bounties from Marines work? "
2401,Who's the artist of the Oreimo's Suki Nandamon original edition theme song?,"I found a video of Ore no Imouto's 9th Ending Suki Nandamon and it says ""Original Edition"". It is different from the TV version sang by Ayana Taketatsu, the actual version of the ending of Oreimo. But the singer sounds a bit different from Ayana Taketatsu. I don't know if the Original Version and the TV Version have the same artist. So I'm asking, is Ayana Taketatsu the artist of the Original Edition? If not, who is the artist? "
2402,What connection is there between the Black Rock Shooter anime and PSP game?,"I've been watching the Black Rock Shooter anime this weekend; I decided to watch it now because I got the PSP game. However, the description of the game says that the world it's set in has only 3 girls left after aliens wiped out humanity, Black and White Rock Shooter being 2 of them.  The anime, however, seems to have no connection to this, so I'm wondering: Are the two linked in any way, or is the only connection between the anime and game the fact that Black Rock Shooter appears in it? "
2403,How does the automail work?,"An automail must be a masterpiece, as the user seems to be able to use it as a fully working arm/leg/... It seems however, that it's no regular artificial limb.  What's so special about an automail? How does it work? Are there any drawbacks? "
2404,Why does Kirito have access to Sachi's inventory?,"in Sword Art Online: Hollow Fragment, Kirito has access to Asuna's inventory, as expected since they married before Floor 75, but also he has access to Sachi's inventory which contains a Teleport Crystal, a Health Potion and the message Sachi left for him for Christmas (can't use it to confirm the message but I assume it's the same one).  Aside from Kirito's attire, everything up until Kayaba disappearing on Floor 75 is based off the anime. So how does Kirito have access to Sachi's inventory? To my understanding, Grimlock only had access to Griselda's inventory after she died because they were already married. Is there another way for a player to share their inventory without marrying them? "
2405,What happened to the Kyuubi's chakra after Orochimaru releases the Dead Demon Consuming Seal?,"We know that when the Kyuubi attacked Konoha, the 4th Hokage sealed half of the Kyuubi's chakra using the Dead Demon Consuming Seal and half within Naruto.  When Orochimaru sliced the stomach of the Dead Demon Consuming Seal ""Reaper""/Shinigami (Chapter 618), all things that was sealed in it was freed.  So what happened to the half of the Kyuubi's chakra that was sealed? Why didn't it return?  "
2406,"What does ""shirobako"" mean in terms of the anime?","Shirobako is supposed to mean white box, and is a conjunction of ""shiro"" (white) and ""hako"" (box). The ""h"" in ""hako"" turns into a ""b"" when you join the two words. Thanks @LoganM for the explanation.   Is there any meaning to making this the title? Is it an anime production-related term? "
2407,Does Sakamoto know that Nano is a robot?,"Nano Shinonome and Sakamoto are among the most interesting characters in Nichijou. The portrayal of daily life of a human-like AI with a condescending talking cat is something special in it's own respect, let alone Nichijou's humorous tone!    Usually, Sakamoto calls Nano 「むすめ」: ""Musume"", which translates to ""girl"" and calls Hakase as 「ガキ」: ""gaki"", which roughly means ""kid"".  However, is there any episode where Sakamoto actually talks about Nano being a robot or directly addresses Nano about it? Further, is there any incident where Sakamoto is present when Nano's hand opens up or something similar happens?  Or is it only Yukko who fully acknowledges the fact that Nano is a robot and respects her feelings throughout the series?  If not in the anime, I'm curious if it happens in the manga! "
2408,Why are there so many tragic ocean promises?,Quite often in a promise is made to go see the ocean. Just as often these promises can not/ no longer be achieved due to some events occurring.    Is there some symbolism at play here? Leading to a character always having to dramatically fail at going to the ocean together? Or something different all together 
2409,"Why do almost all anime series have a ""going to the beach"" episode?","Not many anime have a dedicated episode for going to the cinema, concert, amusement park, circus, football match, camping or any other activities. But, almost all of them spare at least one of their episode for a ""trip to the beach"" episode. The characters sometimes travel a long distance and/or struggle among hardships for this trip.   Is is just for fan service (showing boobs and bikinis)? Is it related to a strong cultural interest? Or, is this because of a psychological project of the Japanese government for encouraging Japanese youth for swimming? (This reminds me of USA TV series: In almost all shows, it is a must that at least one episode must be dedicated to a gay character, one episode for a Jewish character, and all good working computers are Apple (except for the ones which get hacked or broken).)   So, what does make beach so special in anime? "
2410,"How were the culprits ""dragged to their death""?","After a student is found guilty, the next scene if of them being tied up or trapped in a new room before dying an ""interesting"" death.  But who put them there? Does the anime ever give any indication of who is tying up the guilty and dragging them to the ""death room""?  See this video for example (Ep3): [website]The culprit is found guilty and shortly after Monokuma pushes the red button, he is instantly ""teleported"" to a room to die. How?  I hope this question makes sense. I couldn't figure out how to word it properly. "
2411,Need help identifying this manga- large guy helps out schoolgirl,"I remember reading a fairly new manga a while back where the main protagonist is a large guy on the wrestling team, who is actually really sweet and doesn't like to see girls get hurt. He rescues a girl from being groped on the subway (I'm pretty sure this is what happened), and she bakes him cookies and wants to be friends. He likes her, but assumes she actually is interested in his popular friend (who always rejects girls) and keeps inviting him along when she asks to hang out. It seems like the girl actually did like the main guy and not the good-looking friend, but he doesn't realize.   Does anyone know what this manga is called? Did it get cancelled? "
2412,What is the wage difference for mangaka whose work is published in magazines vs on the web?,"There are a bunch of manga magazines like:  Weekly   Weekly Shonen Jump  Weekly Shonen Sunday  Weekly Shonen Magazine and many more   Monthly   Monthly Urasunday Ultra Jump and many more   There is a question about this topic: How does a mangaka get paid?  Based on that question, i can assume that the answer was only based on mangaka that worked for manga magazine. What about web manga, like Mob Psycho 100? Is there any difference in wages between mangaka whose works are published in magazines and mangaka whose works are published on the web?   Does the rule ""Paid by the total amount of page per chapter"" still apply on the web? How many pages do web mangaka have to make for a weekly/monthly serialization?  Related question : Who started the format 18-36 pages in weekly and 36-60 pages in monthly manga magazine? "
2413,How did Koro-sensei's body change from humanoid to an octopus-like creature?,"In his earlier transformation form, Koro-sensei had a humanoid and white-colored body.     But later on, his body had undergone a drastic change and his body became like an octopus with a large smiley face.    Why did his body transform? And could he revert back to his humanoid-tentacle like body? "
2414,Is there a huge difference in the amount of male vs. female protagonists in anime and manga?,"I'm wondering if there's an imbalance in Japanese society as there is in American society. Or if anyone has come across a survey that found the percent of female vs. male protagonists in anime and manga?  I think the main difference in anime and manga is that the Japanese have created genres to meet the interests of those who consume anime and manga (which if I'm not mistaken, is a far larger amount than Americans who consume comics and cartoons). For boys, they have shounen, and for girls, shoujo. For more matured tastes we have seinen and josei (which could arguably still be divided into men and women). In shounen, the protagonist is predominantly male, and in shoujo, the protagonist is usually female. Should I instead be looking at which genre is produced more for my answer? "
2415,Did Vegeta SSJ2 against Beerus surpassed Gohan's mystic form?,"In Dragon Ball Super in the battle of gods saga when Vegeta fights Beerus, Beerus says fighting him was more fun than fighting Goku super saiyan 3. In the movie Battle of gods, master Roshi says Vegeta's power has finally surpassed Goku, and in the manga Vegeta could power up super saiyan 2 to a level above super saiyan 3. So everything indicates Vegeta enraged SSJ2 was able to surpass the power of a SSJ3. But what about Gohan's mystic form? Did Vegeta SSJ2 against Beerus surpassed Gohan's mystic form? "
2416,Why are some hissatsu techniques in Inazuma Eleven never used again?,"I'm not sure whether anyone around has watched and followed Inazuma Eleven enough to be able to answer this... but here goes!  A brief description: Hissatsu techniques are special techniques in the anime which enables the users to do some powerful moves, including goal keeper techniques, defense, offense and shoots.  Now, I noticed that there are some hissatsu techniques which aren't used again, especially those used in the movies of the anime:   Maximum fire used by Gouenji Shuuya in the movie Gekijyouban Inazuma Eleven Saikyou Gundan Ogre hasn't been used anywhere else in the anime. Omega the Hand used by Endou Mamoru in the same movie never appeared again. Ironically enough, the episodes immediately following it have Endou looking for a stronger hissatsu technique than his current strongest at that point in time (I hope this make sense ^^) Joker Rains used in the next movie, Kyuukyoku no Kizuna Gryphon by Shindou Takuto and Tsurugi Kyousuke is similar and isn't used again. Well, that one could be explained if they say they didn't want to use it again.   Is it just me or are the movies like... completely separate from the anime series? Why are hissatsu techniques exclusively used in movies never used again? If so, then there's something even stranger:   Matsukaze Tenma met Shuu the first and only time in the second movie, but knows him when he sees him again in episode 8 of Inazuma Eleven Go: Chrono Stone. All those who went to God Eden in the movie also know about this place back in the series.   That's about the things I managed to notice, there might be more I didn't. The only thing I can think about is that the first movie alone is like a side/parallel storyline, or an alternative ending to the series, while the second movie is more like an actual event that happened but not much spoken of in the series, which I find really strange. "
2417,Does the detail in a manga affect the mangaka's payment?,"The series like Vagabond, Vinland Saga, Ichigo Mashimaro, Made in Abyss, Planetes, I am Hero, Gantz, Inuyashiki, and Yotsubato  have such a surrealist and detailed background style. Did they get paid more than a regular one? Or the wages for every chapter they made are same with the other mangaka?  ""These"" mangaka have put a lot of effort for like adding detail to the background and such, the character, the environment, and so. I know other manga had some detail for their own style like Akame ga Kill, Toriko, One Piece, Yu-Gi-Oh! (in this context, the monster illustration in all of Yu-Gi-Oh! cards).  Compare it with ""other mangaka"", I thought they should get paid more but, but did they? "
2418,Exactly what is Aizawa-sensei's quirk?,"In My Hero Academia, chapter 6:      Midoriya throws the ball, and Aizawa erases his Quirk, making him fail a first time.   During this time, he grabs the student with his scarf, while not touching it. The drawn version is ambiguous, but the anime version is clear about that statement.  How so ? His quirk is only quirk erasing, not something about gravity or scarf controlling. Is there even a valid reason about that ?  Links to evidence:    Video extract (sorry for the commercial channel) "
2419,"What does Yoshimura mean by ""sugar"" in chapter 92?","On chapter 92, there's a conversation between Yoshimura and Roma inside Anteiku that goes like this:     Yoshimura: What do you have to be careful about in both ""the coffee you served to ghouls"" and 'prostitutes on street corner'?   Roma: ??   Yoshimura: ""Sugar""   Roma: ...... what? (confused)     This joke went right over my head when I read this chapter. If someone could explain it to me that would be great. "
2420,"What meaning does the nickname ""Kyon"" has?","In the Melancholy of Suzumiya Haruhi, the main character's nickname is ""Kyon"" (キョン). From the novel, the origin of the name is explained:     By the way, Kyon would be me. My aunt was the one who first called me   that. A few years ago, my long-time-no-see aunt suddenly said to me   ""My goodness, Kyon has grown so big!"" My sister thought it was funny   and also started to call me Kyon. After that the rest is history— my   friends, upon hearing my sister calling me Kyon, decided to follow her   lead. From that day on, my nickname became Kyon. Damn it, my sister   used to call me ""Onii-chan""!   Kyon does not seem to like the name very much. Also, his sister ""thought it was funny"". This makes me wonder what ""Kyon"" actually means. It it has no meaning at all, why would Kyon's sister find it funny?  Does ""Kyon"" mean anything? "
2421,What happened to Mouri in episode 219?,"In episode 219 of Detective Conan, ""The Gathering of the Detectives!

Spoiler alert if you didn't watch episode 25:     In the ending of episode 23, he captured Subaru's body which some would think was possible because Subaru has touched the book.

2427,"When is the track ""No differences"" played?","Track 01 on the Aldnoah.Zero Original Soundtrack is a vocal piece titled ""No differences"" (lyrics). It's positively eargasmic. Thing is, I don't remember it being played at any point during the show (and, given that the lyrics are English, I feel like I would have remembered it if I had heard it). Was it used? If so, when?  (Yeah, I could just rewatch it and listen for the track, but that would take a few hours I don't want to spend right now.) "

"
2429,How is anime as a whole profitable? (If it is),"I'm considering the following facts:   Japanese people have few spare time, with their jobs taking a lot of their time usually, even kids or teenagers have intense schedules. There are lots of anime series each year, we can easily expect at least 100  series with maybe an average of 20 chapters per each series. Most anime don't get out of Japan, even if we consider either worldwide legal or illegal services that offer anime, what is seen most are the most well-known series. Anime is not cheap to produce, we can consider that each anime episode is about 120000 US dollars. Anime is pretty time consuming to watch in general.   (I'm making up the previous quantities but I don't think I'm that far from the real ones).  With these facts I wonder how it's profitable in general as my guess is that with those conditions most series would not cover their costs, so it looks somehow strange that people are willing to spend much in something that's hardly going to be profitable (although if the anime is successful and moreover, exported worldwide, it can be truly profitable, that's true, maybe it's just that with their big hits they cover all the rest of the unsuccessful series).  I thought that maybe it was subsidized by the government but with an internet search it looks like this doesn't happen often.  What is missing or faulty in my reasoning, or is anime really profitable? Maybe it's what I've said earlier that their successful series cover the costs of the unsuccessful series?  On the other hand, could it be that it's not usually profitable but they still try to do it just because anime is so big in Japan and they love it? "
2430,Why did Heiji's mom have to lie to Mouri and Conan in episode 220?,"At the end of episode 220 of Detective Conan, ""The Client Full of Lies"", Heiji appears and explains the reason behind the fake name ""Reiko"" to Conan that it was to conceal the fact that his mom is from Osaka.  But that doesn't explain why she has to lie about her being good at cooking and her allergy to dust. If she were to hide her identity, she need not lie about the cooking and the allergies. Conan wouldn't be able to find out even if he knew that she was from Osaka since it was his first time meeting Heiji's mother.  Why did she have to go that far? Or was it part of her test for Mouri to figure out her real identity?  Even if it's the case, I bet no one's going to be able to deduce that she is Heiji's mother because first, it's impossible to even know the true identity of a person just by knowing her hobbies or skills. Unless she has a distinctive quality in which the Hattori's are famous for.  Second, Conan did not even know a thing about Heiji's mom. The test was actually for Shinichi but since he wasn't there, she tried Mouri instead. No matter how good Conan's deductions were, it was impossible for him to expose her real identity as Heiji's mom and her real intentions. They were even surprised when she revealed her true identity as Heiji's mom since Heiji didn't even look like her.  So, why did she have to lie about all the stuff? "
2431,What is the meaning of the title Trinity Seven?,I understand why Trinity Seven because there are seven deadly sins represented by a girl which is needed to be controlled by Arata. But I don't understand why Trinity? Which is referred to as the Trinity? Does Arata's magic have three forms? Does he need to do three things to control these seven sins? Are there three magus who can control these seven sins? What does the Trinity represent? 
2432,Are there any non-Japanese manga/anime authors or studios?,"Manga and anime famously originate from Japan, and the vast majority of the big names in manga and anime are Japanese; Hayao Miyazaki, Hideaki Anno, Hiromu Arakawa, and Masashi Kishimoto come to mind.  Outside of Japan, I can really only think of one creator who had their work become an anime/manga: The Deltora Quest series was adapted into an anime and manga and was created by an Australian writer, Emily Rodda.  Aside from Rodda, however, are there any* international creators, particularly from the Western world, that have successfully published manga (or anime) in Japan, manhua in China, or manhwa in Korea? Have any Western studios created and produced** anime (or rather, anime-influenced) series?  * - An exhaustive list is not necessary; a few examples from various countries and maybe some stats versus Japan, if possible. ** - Not as a result of outsourcing. "
2433,What is a vocaloid?,"I don't really understand what a vocaloid is so, what is a vocaloid? Is it an anime? If not, how is it related to anime? Is it a singer? If so, is it a real person (because someone told me that some are but mostly are just machine-created voices)? "
2434,Why do anime characters have official birthdays?,Why do anime characters have official birthdays? Why do they decide for the anime characters to have birthdays? Does this have a historical basis? And when exactly is a character's birthday decided? Is it when a character's physical appearance is drafted? What is the birthday's significance? 
2435,Can heroes have any kind of powers in One Punch Man?,"Something I find strange in One Punch Man is, it seems no all kinds of power seems to exist in the story. I mean, what we usually see is, people with increased strenght, resistance, regeneration, speed, (all augmentations of natural human habilities), ESP, and people who increased their power through artifacts such as cyborgs, people using special guns (like golden ball, spring mustachio, stinger, etc) and that's it. We dont see for example, heroes who can manipulate ice or fire without artifacts , invisibility, people who can naturally fire beams, wind control, water control, animal control, etc. May be I'm wrong and I don't know all the heroes, but isnt it so?  Can heroes have any kind of powers in One Punch Man? "

However, the protagonist name appears as an actual staff member in the credits of the anime as of Anime News Network, credited in other more recent works too.  Who really is Itou Makoto?

2437,How long are people genin before they take the chunin exam?,"Team 7 (Naruto's team) existed for at least while before they took the chunin exam, and they took on a number of missions before taking the chunin exams.

Is there some sort of mission requirement where they have to complete a number of missions before they can take the exam? "
2438,How does sailing all around the Orbus Barrier work?,"At the end of the game we see a clear image that both Inferia and Celestia are spherical worlds.  before Seyfert's Ring was destroyed it, Seyfert's Observatory and Aifread's dock were sitting on the Orbus Barrier. from Aifread's dock you could sail on either side of the Orbus Barrier such as if you entered the dock from Inferia and went onto the barrier (or entered from Celestia and rotated 180 degrees), the Observatory would be upside down.  yet you can loop around if you go in one direction. if it was like the water barrier that surrounds Ephinea (Tales of Graces) it would make sense since it's spherical around the planet. but both Inferia and Celestia are spherical and Seyfert's Ring sits between the 2 worlds on the Orbus Barrier.  So how does sailing all around the Orbus Barrier work? how does the Van Eltia not fall off an edge of the Orbus Barrier? "
2439,Can Genos do something to increase his power other than changing his parts?,So Genos follows Saitama as master and Saitama the only thing that knows for increasing a hero power is training.

2441,"About ""Hoshi no Hitomi no Silhouette""","In episode 21 of Sousei no Onmyouji, Mayura advises Benio to read a manga titled Hoshino Hitomi no Silhouette (""Hoshino Hitomi's Silhouette"") to learn how to deal with Rokuro romantically.    After googling around a bit, I noticed that this work is a clear parody of a work with a homophonous title ― Hoshi no Hitomi no Silhouette (""Silhouettes of the Eyes of the Stars""), published 1985-89. The author of the fictional work is ""Kaede Akane"", whose name means ""Maple-tree Red"", while the real work is by Hiiragi Aoi, which can be read as meaning ""Holly-plant Blue"". I point this out to emphasize that this is clearly an allusion of sorts.   Mayura describes this manga as a ""bible of romance"", supposedly read by four million girls, and shows us these archetypical shoujo-romance scenes from the manga:       I don't have any context for why the author might have chosen to parody this particular shoujo romance manga, though. Might there be some sort of connection between Sukeno Yoshiaki (author of Sousei no Onmyouji) and Hiiragi Aoi? Or is Hoshi no Hitomi no Silhouette a particularly classic exemplar of shoujo romance manga?  "
2442,Why do the eyes of a bounded soul glow?,"If I didn't miss one, all souls that were bound to armors have glowing eyes.      Why do their eyes glow?

2444,Can Accelerator be harmed by space-time abilities (such as teleportation)?,"Accelerator can control vectors with his ability ""Vector Change"" (sometimes also known as ""Accelerator""). Is it possible for someone with a space-time ability to hurt him (e.g. by teleporting an object inside his body or moving his body parts to different places)? If not, why not?

2445,Why does Shichika allow Princess Hitei to travel with him?,"The closing credits of Katanagatari show Shichika travelling with the Princess, and being pretty friendly to her.

2446,How does the NerveGear fallback battery work?,"On the first episode of Sword Art Online we know about a microwaves device installed on the helmet. We learn that this device can damage to death the user's brain removing the limiter. Unplugging the device causes the battery to activate as fallback, using the remaining power on the battery to damage the brain of the user.  The main device of a today microwave oven is magnetron, I cannot find any example of a magnetron consuming less than 1kWh as now (I accept correction), emitting more than 600W in microwaves. As of current technology, can a portable battery provide enough power to burn a brain? Are there more details about this issue described later in the anime or in the novels? "

2456,Do the runes appear in-universe?,"So we know what the runes translate to in Puella Magi Madoka Magica. Since the runes appear all over the place like on walls and when a witch appears, the Puella Magi must be aware of the runes, which are also on their rings as their names (see the images which show their rings).  I am wondering, in-universe, what are the runes? Are they magical, thus making up a runic magic system? Are they the native language of the Incubators? Or are they something else entirely? "

Since this anime makes a point to be more similar to the real world than others, it made me wonder if this sort of thing actually happens in Japan.  I recognized the trope from anime, but in researching this question, it seems that it's also common in other mediums.  Is the rain that cold over there?  Do people usually take showers at other people's houses after a downpour takes them by surprise? "

Also, Wikipedia, Right Stuff and Anime News Network have almost the same description which is     Maria Holic revolves around a high school girl named Kanako Miyamae, who is scared of boys and breaks out in hives if a boy touches her. During her second year of high school, she enrolls in an all-girls school hoping to find a female romantic partner. However, her ideal candidate, Mariya Shidō, turns out to be a sadistic cross-dressing boy.   Now sure, the premise might be interesting, a story about a girl getting over her fear of men through dating a cross-dressing guy (going by only what's been quoted) but if there is one thing I really, really, really really really hate it's being lied to about shoujo-ai/yuri, so how is Maria†Holic shoujo-ai/yuri? Are there actually lesbian relationships in it?  NOTE: I ask fully expecting spoilers. "
2459,Does Metal Bat need his bat for being more powerful?,So Metal Bat is capable of doing a swing which destroys a building. For doing such a swing he would need an incredible strenght and for having that strenght he would need a very hard body (arms and fits included). What does the bat add here? Does Metal Bat need his bat for being more powerful? Has he ever been shown fighting without the bat and being very powerful too? 
2460,Why are school swimsuits with name tags such a popular item in otaku subculture?,"How did it get so popular in otaku subculture?  What is the name of the proper name for name tag that's commonly found on female school swimwear? Sometimes it just says the name, sometimes just the class number, and other times both. What significance does it play both in-universe and in real life?    "
2461,Were there any Death Note Rules not shown mid episode of the anime?,"In the anime when there is a break in the episode we have scenes that look similar to the ""How to Use"" pages of the manga. except they aren't titled like ""How to Use XVI"".  I am wondering, are there any rules that were in the ""How to Use"" Pages that were not shown in the middle of the episodes? if so which ones? "
2462,Are MAD and AMV synonyms for Anime Music Video?,"On youtube and elsewhere it's frequent to find ""MAD"" video, a sort of Anime Music Video (AMV) composed by anime sequences on a music track. Are MAD and AMV synonyms? If not, how these differ from each other and what MAD means? "
2463,Are Den Den Mushis conscious?,"In One Piece there are some snail-like creatures that     ..have the ability to communicate with each other telepathically through   radio waves. The people in One Piece world take advantage of this   ability by attaching buttons and receivers to them. Den Den Mushi thus   take the place of telephones and other similar machines in the world   of One Piece.     I have never seen one moving about freely. Are they fully conscious of their surroundings, could they move freely if they wanted to? Or do once they become tamed and personalized they just become fully fledged telephones? "
2464,Did Frieza know super saiyan god?,"In the Dragon Ball Minus manga which is part of Jaco the Galatic Patrolman if I understand correctly, Frieza knows super saiyan god. But in the anime series he seems to know anything about him, since he feared super saiyan and not super saiyan god, which doesnt make sense if he knew super saiyan god who is much stronger. So my question is, is what Dragon Ball Minus says canon? Did Frieza know super saiyan god? Sure not all official Dragon Ball mangas are canon, because some contradict the series like the Dragon Ball Heroes manga or the Dragon Ball Gaiden manga. "
2465,How is Brook alive?,"One of the Strawhat pirate crew members, Brook, is obviously a skeleton. How is it that he's still alive? Even when his shadow is returned, why doesn't he just 'move on' like his other companion? Is there any explanation? "
2466,How are volumes determined in manga?,"My question is about how are volumes determined in a manga.  Does it go by major villain in a form of one per volume? Or...  Does it go by story arc, in a way that a new story forms a new arc? Lastly, are anime story series—arcs, seasons, sagas, etc—determined by the manga volumes?  Please help me understand how this categorization works. "
2467,"Why was it the Junker that proved to Yumemi that she was ""malfunctioning""?","In episode 5 of planetarian, after       the crab mech blows the lower half of her body off,   Yumemi tells the Junker (or ""kuzuya"" / 屑屋; I don't know what the usual translation is) that the reason she believed she was slightly ""malfunctioning"" is that she kept coming to the conclusion that no people would ever come to see her again. So the Junker's arrival did indeed prove her conclusion to be ""faulty"".   But the Junker isn't the first person since the war to see her, is he? There's a flashback in episode 1 where we see some old guy telling the Junker about how met ""a robot"" who I think it is safe to say was Yumemi. Judging from his irritation, Yumemi must've been awake (not asleep/charging), so I would think that Yumemi would remember the old guy.   Is this a plot hole? Or, perhaps, a defect of the anime adaptation?   (planetarian being a small and mostly self-contained work, I think it should be possible to identify whether or not this is a plot hole with a good degree of certainty.) "
2468,What was exactly the CLAMP role in making Code Geass?,"CLAMP collective is credited for original character design of Code Geass. Since the actual character design was made by Takahiro Kimura, what was exactly the CLAMP role in making Code Geass? "
2469,Why doesn't anyone suspect that Sai could be a computer bot?,"Hikaru makes Sai play Go over internet with the nickname ""Sai"". Sai is very powerful, and defeats everybody, even Meijin.  I don't know how to play Go very well, but I perceive that a computer algorithm that plays Go can be written easily. And I believe that there must be a lot of Go bots all over the real world currently.  Why doesn't anybody consider the probability that Sai could be a computer bot? I'm very surprised that it is not mentioned even once during the entire series. Is there a reason for this? "
2470,Are Dio & Lucciola gay?,"At first, I believe that Dio Eraclea and Lucciola were female due to their appearance and voice. However, at some part, people refer as ""he"" (English subtitle).  Wikia mentioned that both Dio Eraclea and Lucciola are male.    Are Dio Eraclea and Lucciola gay/homosexual (with explicit evident in anime/manga/novel)? Do people in Last Exile always acknowledge that Dio Eraclea and Lucciola are male (without even mistaking them with girls due to their appearance or voice)?   "
2471,"Why did Beerus say ""Say something."" at the end of Episode 118 of Dragon Ball Super?","At the end of Episode 118 of Dragon Ball Super, just after Champa and Universe 6 is erased, Beerus says ""Say something.""  Could this mean that Champa will continue to live on in Beerus' mind? Or did they previously have a connection that allowed them to communicate telepathically?  "
2472,Where is this scene originate from in Episode 5 of nichijou?,"What is this thing that Mio's cloud refers to?   And what does this text on the screen mean (The text on the screen, it's like an old Japanese font-style) ?     ""15:40  1-Q in front of the podium""   Based from the word ""sunk"", is that like boat or something ?     Relevant video on Youtube, check at 0:39. "
2473,Why do supernatural titles contain the word 'Code'?,"A lot of series about supernatural powers seem to contain the word 'Code' in the title. For example,    Code Geass Code:Breaker Code:Realise Code-E   Why is there a trend like this among anime titles? What does this signify, if any? "
2474,Why are the faces of dead people whited-out in photographs?,"I've noticed that, in a number of different anime, photographs of people who have died appear with the face whited out, generally by reflections of light. Is there a tradition behind this? Is there a cultural reason for this, or is it just laziness to keep from having to animate a character who would only be drawn once?     "
2475,Does Melissa Shield ever appear outside the movie?,"AFAIR, in the first 3 seasons of the My Hero Academia anime, Melissa Shield never appears. How about the manga? Does Melissa Shield ever appear outside the movie? "
2476,Where are the more powerful characters during the Tournament of Power?,"In the Tournament of Power, why does Goku's team have Roshi, Krillin, Tien, etc. in it, even though most characters are much more powerful?  Where are Broly, Goten, Trunks, Majin Buu? "
2477,Censorship in Japan,"This question is purely out of curiousity and based on some ecchi/borderline hentai shows.   As a fact we know that plenty of japanese content gets cencored in japan, but why is this applied to adult content? Such as a hentai manga. Once someone purchases it the final goal of the user is pretty straightforward. A minor won't be able to purchase one due to their strict laws and such.   So with this in mind it is pretty straight forward that your audience are adults. How come that the content still gets cencored? Some apply stripes, other apply pixelated art while others completely cencor certain parts of a body.   I have seen this applied to both manga and anime. The only shows and manga that didn't have any cencorship were unofficial stuff; essentially fan-art.   Is there a law in japan against nudity overall that prevents studios and official sources from implementing full nudity?   I don't require samples on full nudity anime/manga if there are any. I do wish those that answer to keep it as polite as possible so that if any youngster around us might read this it won't be against a law or the rules and regulations of this website.  I am simply curious about why this practise is implemented by (from what I know, not a fact) every studio out there in japan. Perhaps it is to make the show able to be aired on tv? I don't know.  This doesn't only apply to manga and anime but can also be applied to actual movies in Japan. In America cartoons haven't reached the level of 18+ due to nudity and explicit material, but plenty of shows have such as Spartacus and Game of Thrones (as examples) have. They are aired without any cencorship at all.  "
2478,How does Toya give his magic to Yue?,"I know that, in Cardcaptor Sakura, Yue starts needing more magic after Sakura collects all of the cards, which begins to negatively affect Yukito. Toya gives his magic to Yue to save Yukito. How does he pass the magic on? It makes sense that Sakura would have a connection to him, considering that both of them are connected to the cards, but why would Toya have a connection that allows him to give his magic to Yue? "
2479,"Why did Rem go crazy when she used her horn at the forest, but not when she was young?","[spoiler alert] Please do not read until you watch Episode 11 of the Anime      At Episode 9, and Episode 10, when Rem uses her horn to engage beasts,  it seem that she cannot control herself. At Episode 10, She also  attacks Subaru and Ram. Subaru has to hit her horn to bring her out of  madness.     Episode 10 at 19:47   However, in the flashback when Ram and Rem were young, none of them  become crazy when they use their horns.     Episode 11 at 1:26     Episode 11 at 2:17   Could anyone explain to me ? Does madness is the side-effect of using  horn, or there are any other causes ? Because as I see, it happened to  Rem in the forest with mabeast (demon beast) only.  "
2480,"Why isn't Subaru allowed to tell anyone about his ""return by death"" power?","In Re:Zero, Subaru has the ""return by death"" power, but when he tries to tell anyone about it he is stopped by what I assume is ""The Witch"". Why does this happen? Why can't Subaru tell anyone about his power? "
2481,Has Naruto's less-than-stealthy costume been explained in-universe?,"Out-of-universe, Naruto's day-glo orange costume was chosen to make him ""pop.""  In-universe, it's hard to imagine a less efficient color for a ninja, especially in a wooded area.  Has there been any in-universe explanation for why Naruto wears that color, and was allowed to continue doing so even during missions?  Failing that, has the absurdity of it at least been lampshaded? "
2482,"Can Ultra Instinct be used on top of other transformations, like Super Saiyan Blue Ultra Instinct?","Ultra Instinct is sometimes refered as a transformation and sometimes as a technique/state. Now apparently there are thousands of fans who believes Ultra Instinct can be used on top of another transformation, just like kaioken can be used on top of Super Saiyan Blue and make Super Saiyan Blue kaioken, they believe you can have a Super Saiyan Blue Ultra Instinct or a Super Saiyan God Ultra Instinct.   Personally I dont believe this is possible, but there are thousands who thinks so and this situation already has consequences in the Dragon Ball fandom, for example there is a videogame mod of Dragon Ball Xenoverse which allows you to use ""Goku Ultra Instinct Super Saiyan Blue Kaioken""  [website]and there are also fan arts made about it like this one,  [website]Are all these people just wrong or is there any hint/explanation in Dragon Ball Super that states this is possible? "
2483,Where should I start the Tokyo Ghoul manga from?,"I've finished the 1st and 2nd (√A) seasons and I wanted to start with the manga. So I want to continue it from the part where the anime left off, since I don't want to waste time reading what has been already done in the anime, assuming all the episodes are canon. If they are, which chapter should I start from? Or should I start from the beginning? And one more question, is it a weekly or monthly published manga?  "
2484,How many endings are there in the School Days Visual Novel?,"During the course of the anime, Makoto sleeps around with a lot of the female cast. In the manga, the story is more focused on the two main female leads.  As far as I know, each deals with a different route from the original Visual Novel.  In the VN, how many different endings were possible? Was it possible for Makoto to get with any of the girls that he didn't in the anime? (for example Nanami Kanroji)   "
2485,What does G.U stand for?,"in .hack//ROOTS and .hack//G.U, the guild Raven is actually the CC Copr Organization ""Project G.U"" who's focus is on AI, partially the AIDA, the Morgana Mode Gone Epitaphs and Aura.  But what does the G.U stand for anyway? i am well aware that in Terminal Disk each ""episode"" is named using the letters G and U like Graceless Unison and Guide to an Uprising but it it was never stated which one of those (if any) was the G.U used by CC Corp. the only 2 letter Acronym they explain is RA which is Rebirth Aura.  So what does G.U stand for in Project G.U? "
2486,In what year(s) does the Monogatari series take place?,"Looking from the perspective of the recent movie (which occurs at or near the chronological beginning of the series):   Koyomi has what appears to be a slide-phone with a keyboard, and Hanekawa puts her ""phone number and email address"" into it. Koyomi goes to the bookstore for porn instead of just looking it up on the internet. (This show never seems to indicate any signs of the internet even existing?) All the cars (which are mostly copy-pastes of the same CG model) seem to have a much older style to them.   Most of all, this frame (which appears right as Koyomi is about to bring up his phone) may indicate a year. But what does the ""G9"" stand for?   "
2487,Roronoa Zoro's sense of climate/aura/motion and other observation capabilities,"It's not a luck or co-incidence, of all people Zoro sensed first that their Ship isn't moving (when they entered Calm belt for the first time)  In episode 385 he sensed (along with Nami) change in climate before Serpent Currents emerged.  There are several incidences he has sensed changes in Climate and motion before all (or along with Nami, who's a navigator) in the series  Is it zoro's Kenbunshoku Haki, which was active all time? or does he have any special ability? Isn't it noteworthy? I don't see any sources highlighting this ability of his (even in Wiki)! "
2488,Why were people raised as food in Gundam: G Reconguista?,"I'm catching up on Gundam: G Reconguista and they keep talking about Kuntala.  The brief discriptions so far were that they are lower class citizens and that they used to be raised as food.  Cannibalism? For serious?  Humans would make the worst stock.  You'd have to wait 16 years to get a decent amount of anything to eat.  Cows mature in less than 5 (2ish maybe?), and sheep and goats are fast to raise.  And they eat grass, which is usually everywhere.  I found a blurb on a Gundam wiki, and a reddit thread asking similar questions, but not much for answers.   Why were people being raised as food? If such a people were freed from bondage, how and why are they still second class citizens and discriminated against?  "
2489,"Why was it so easy to defeat Toneri, Kinshiki and Momoshiki?","Toneri had somewhat the same Goal as Madara. Madara gained Hagoromo's Power and Toneri, Hamura's. The both powers are, I believe equivalent.  Sharingan >> Rinnegan = Byakugan >> Tenseigan  He who awakens the Rinnegan, shall receive the Powers of Hagoromo and he who awakens the Tenseigan shall receive the Powers of Hamura. Which is exactly what happened. BUT... Toneri had the Power of Hamura, who has the equivalent Power as Hagoromo... Then, how was Naruto able to finish Toneri's Tenseigan (and the Powers of Hamura) away with one blow?? + just in Nine Tails Mode, without his Six Paths Powers.. It just doesn't add up.  Now.. let's move to the Movie Boruto:  Kinshiki and Momoshiki are very powerful beings... Momoshiki even has 3 Rinnegan (One in his Forehead, and one in each palm) and has also the equivalent, if not greater Power to those of Kaguya.... how the hell was he defeated by only Boruto (a child)? While it took Naruto &amp; Sasuke to seal away (not defeat) Kaguya and they both had the Six Paths Powers, while Boruto had none whatsoever. "
2490,Can Natsu eat fire from objects he burns?,"I have been thinking that if Natsu can't eat his own fire, can he set some object on fire using his magic and then eat that fire?? "
2491,Where can I find a list of Yen Press shoujo ai/yuri titles?,"I've been building a list of the shoujo ai/yuri manga &amp; light novels so that I can have an idea of where to get them and how much does they cost. On Seven Seas Entertainment's site, they have a yuri tag  While not shoujo ai/yuri, when I added K-On, I was reminded about Yen Press, but there's no tag system on their website. When I do a search for ""yuri"", I only get Eclair. Under sub-genres, they have ""Gay &amp; Lesbian"", but looking up ""lesbian"" returns nothing (since I'm not looking for shounen ai/yaoi).  Where can I find a list of Yen Press shoujo ai/yuri titles? This way, I can search the title up on Yen press to find where I can buy it.  Note: If Eclair is actually the only shoujo ai/yuri title Yen Press has localized, then a resource is still useful in case searching for ""yuri"" on the site fails later on. "
2492,Why can't Titans attack using the canals passing through the walls?,"I saw this image on this question: Why are there outlying towns/cities on the walls in Shingeki no Kyoujin?    If you look carefully, there is a spot near the bottom where the water canal enters the district Shignashina and then through Wall Maria itself.  Why don't the Titans use this opening to attack the city? From the question, Can the Titans swim?, there haven't been any conclusive theories as to how the titans cross the water.     Titans floating seems misplaced and I think ""Connie's Mom"" provides evidence that someone probably turned few people living on the islands to titans to wipe out humanity  "
2493,Is there any significance in Mr. Tanaka's chibified form?,"In Kuroshitsuji, most of the time Mr. Tanaka is drawn in chibified form and says nothing but ""ho ho ho"". At certain times, however, he reverts back to his normal form for a short amount of time, like when he returned to his former rank of head butler following Sebastian's absence. Is there any significance to this? Does it has any meaning for the story?  Edit: I mean like how Finny was a kaizo-ningen (he underwent an operation to gain inhuman strength) or how Mei Rin was an assassin and Bard was a soldier. "
2494,Does any hero with enhanced regeneration in One Punch Man also ages slowly or live longer?,"In many series, heroes or superhuman people who has enhanced regeneration also age slowly or live longer. Is this the case in One Punch Man? Does any hero with enhanced regeneration in One Punch Man also ages slowly or live longer? "
2495,Why are recap episodes so common?,"Recap episodes are pretty common in anime.  Every so often there will be an episode (or multiple episodes like in One Piece) that brings the audience up to speed on presumably a lot of material.  In the past few years I've noticed that even 1 cour anime will have a recap episode somewhere in the middle (between episodes 4 - 6), and recently there have even been shows that are 1 cour with 2 recap episodes(thought the title escapes me at the moment).  I've never seen a positive fan reaction to a recap episode, so why are they still so common?  Are they a hold over from the days before Video on Demand (VoD) through The Internets?  Or is it just another filler-related solution?  Recap episodes are different than recap OVAs for the purpose of this question. "
2496,What does this flag mean? How is it related to Raoh?,"We see this flag/banner raised several times throughout the series.  It looks like a snake with wings and 3 pairs of legs.  It's our protagonist's (Raoh, the Dark King) flag.  What does it mean?  How is it related to Raoh and/or the school of the North Star?   "
2497,What is the text before the OP in Date a Live episode 9 talking about?,"Before the openings in Date A Live, the narrator reads some epic-sounding text which is somewhat related to the content of the episode. In most cases it's been easy to understand, but the text from episode 9 is ambiguous. Here's the translation from Funimation's stream of the episode, this dialogue starts at 1:30:     ""It"" is something all things are given.       ""It"" can not be bought.      People often waste ""it,""      hold ""it"" dear,      and chase after ""it.""      What... is ""it""?   What is this ""it"" that she is talking about, and what does it have to do with the plot of the series? "
2498,Why can Owl speak?,"Nagi has his vocal cord removed during his back story.  In the majority of the story, however, he talks freely.  Some deadmen show extreme healing abilities. Did he regrow them? He was being courted by a group in power. Did they pull strings to have them replaced? Note that I have watched the anime but not read the manga.  I kind of expect the answer to be there. "
2499,Do the moths during Grumman's thoughts have any symbolic significance?,"In episode 47 (12:08) of Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, general Grumman's thoughts about a leadership position in Central are made audible to the viewer:     Miles: And what about the plan, sir? Aren't you going to proceed to central?      Grumman: I don't seem to have much choice. I suppose I'll just have to let Colonel Mustang have the biggest slice of Central pie.      Grumman (thinking): Bradley's current administration will still be properly functioning at this point in time. If Colonel Mustang or General Armstrong try to make their move now, every soldier in Central will be ordered to retrieve their treasonous heads. And once they're captured, I'll step in to restore order. They'll take the fall as enemies of the state, while General Grumman will heroically come riding in on a white horse. I'll let the youngsters dive head-first into danger and do all the dirty work, and then I'll take my rightful place as leader of this country without any risk.   During the bolded part of his speech above, a lamp is shown with a few insects&mdash;which appear to be moths&mdash;hovering around it. One unfortunate insect flies into the lamp and is burned to death.    This seems like an odd thing to show during such a speech, which leads me to believe it might have a deeper meaning. Does this lamp scenario or the moth's death symbolize anything? "
2500,How are weapons formed?,"I will try to make this brief. I know Soul Eater ended ages ago and I just started watching it. I'm at season 3. I'm just curious about how they become weapons? I know that one is born as a weapon, but what happens physically? I might be overthinking it, but I am just curious. "
2501,How can non-Japanese fans encourage continued anime or sequels?,"What steps can non-Japanese fans take to support their favorite anime and encourage the studios to keep making the title (or make a sequel), assuming that there is more manga or light novel source material available?   I've heard it said that Blu-Rays are highly profitable, but I think it takes more than just profit to encourage sequels, follow-ups, additional cours, OVAs, etc.  For example, if I want there to be more Goblin Slayer, KonoSuba, Full Metal Panic, Log Horizon, etc. what could I buy or who could I write to ask for more? "
2502,What is the block used to symbolize the end of a chapter called?,What do they call this bar? Is there official terminology for it?  Sometimes they add filler text to explain the predicament the heroes are in inside of it or surrounding it.   It also somewhat seems like a stamp to me.   Examples:  One Piece    Bleach    Toriko   
2503,"In Mirai no Mirai, where is the protagonist's family house in Japan?",  Does anyone know where this location might be in Japan? Or is this a purely fictional location? I'm particularly interested in their house designs. The protagonist's neighbors' houses seem to be elevated. Is there a name for that style? 
2504,How much of the novel is covered in the anime?,"After watching the anime, I feel the need to finish the story through the novel. However, I do not know where in the novel did the anime end off or if it even followed the novel's plotline at all.  The question is that if I were to read the novel: Where should I start? Would I miss anything if I start where the anime ended? "
2505,"What does the word ""Akarin"" mean?","The word Akarin seems related to the fact that Akari is considered as a transparent person. As an example, every time Akari becomes transparent, the word Akarin appears.    What's more, Akari seems to dislike this word.  What does Akarin means? What is its etymology? "
2506,Questions about nationalities and languages in Death Note,"In the Death Note 2015 series, some people sometimes speak English. For instance when Raye Penber and Bell talk and when Lind L Tailor comes out on TV, it's in English.  The Death Note anime of course acknowledges the existence of the English language, like in the first episode, when people with English names are written down in the Death Note and when Near says 'Mister' Aizawa, but a lot of English speaking people instead speak Japanese.  So this got me to thinking,   Are L, Mello, Near, Watari, Beyond Birthday et al Western people who just so happen to be fluent in or at least sufficiently speak and understand Japanese? L once adopted the alias Ryuga Hideki. How would anyone think that a Western-looking person has a Japanese name? Is his cover story that he was adopted by a Japanese family or something? Are they necessarily British just because Wammy's House is in England? In general, is there anyway to know for sure what language is being spoken between a Western person and an Eastern person in the Death Note anime? For instance, when Light and L talk, are they talking in Japanese or English? How about when Near and Light talk?  "
2507,How and why was Alucard imprisoned in the Hellsing basement?,"In the beginning of Hellsing and Hellsing Ultimate, we see that Alucard is restrained and forgotten in the basement.  How was he originally restrained? In Hellsing Ultimate, he easily broke out of the restraints.  Why was he restrained? Throughout either series we see that he is like a mostly tamed wild animal but can be controlled. "
2508,Was Misa accessible to Light in the way that this proposition assumes?,"There's this video that proposes how Light could have beaten Near. A critical element of the proposition is that Misa is accessible to Light, but was she? I seem to recall Misa was in the custody of the SPK up until some time just before Light et al are about to leave "
2509,How did Toneri Otsutsuki move the Moon towards the Earth?,We know that Toneri tried to use the Moon to destroy the humans. How did he move the Moon? Did he have any control over attraction and repulsion like the Naraka Path? 
2510,What is the relation between Strike The Blood and Strike The Blood EX?,"I have read that in Strike The Blood EX, Kojou seems to have two children, so EX has to be set in the future.   Is it the future of the ""world"" the story takes place or is it the ""future"" shown at the end of the anime where Reina came from (you can see Kojou's daughters Reina and Moegi)? Or is EX maybe only the name of the last arc in the anime (where Reina appears)? "
2511,What happened to the second kira?,"After Light and Misa were cleared, everyone seemed to just forget about that there's more than one kira. What was up with that? I seem to recall Light instructed Misa to make a response to the task force's kira video, then L deduced that the two kiras have met, then Light and Misa were confined, then Soichiro fake shoots them and then they try to catch Higuchi. While trying to catch Higuchi and thereafter, has everyone just forgotten that there's more than one kira? Did anyone find it suspicious that there seems to have been only one kira around? Maybe they thought that the two kiras were acting as one?  Based on a comment I made here: Why didn't the Task Force capture Misa Amane? "
2512,Which heroes are mutants?,"As far as I understand, in One Punch Man all monsters are mutants. According to the wikia   Mysterious beings      humans naturally become monsters from a desire to transform into   something else through their bad habits, a complex or a burst of   dissatisfaction with their regular selves. They begin their   transformation due to their environment that triggers an abnormal cell   reaction   But how about heroes? Some of them are indeed mutants ie, Zombie man. Tatsumaki and Fubuki ESP powers have to be mutations, dont they? How about the others? We know Saitama got the strenght he has for breaking his limiters so it wouldnt be a mutation, but do the abnormal strenght, resistance, speed, fast healing etc some of the others display (Tank Top Master, Metal Bat, Flashy Flash, Watchdog Man, Superalloy Darkshine, etc.) is the result of mutations or not?

2514,"In Attack on Titan, how did the river barge escape Shiganshina in episode 2?","In episode 2 of the anime, the characters start off in the Shiganshina district.  When and how did they get inside wall Maria?  It shows them on a river barge with other refugees, but I do not think that explains it.  Is there a gate on the river for the barge to go through?  If so, is the gate ever shown, explained or attacked? "
2515,Why didn't Syaoran lose his memory?,"At the end of Cardcaptor Sakura Movie 2: The Sealed Card..     As the sealed card appears to go to Sakura, it chooses Syaoran as the one who will lose their most important feelings because Sakura used too many cards at one time.   However..     Crying and believing it's too late, but encouraged by the Hope Card, Sakura still confesses to Syaoran that she loves him and that he is her most important person. To her surprise, he gently replies that he loves her too, and Sakura realizes he didn't lose his feelings for her after all.   How was this possible? Was it because of the Hope Card?  I just need some explanation for clarification. "
2516,Is Hinaichigo still alive in the manga?,"According to a fandom wiki site, Hinaichigo's status is listed as alive in the manga, but deceased in both the 2004 anime and the 2013 anime. I've only watched the 2004 anime (a long time ago), where she loses the ability to move due to her Roza Mystica being taken by Shinku after her (indirect) link with her medium is severed. In the 2013 anime, which is supposedly more faithful to the manga, she is destroyed from the inside-out and she gives her Roza Mystica to Shinku before dying.  Is the fandom wiki site correct in stating that she is alive in the manga? Does the manga continue past where the 2013 anime left and involve Hinaichigo returning, or is the site incorrect? "
2517,What are the stuffed toys in Suguha's room?,"Kirigaya Suguha's room is often portrayed in the ALO arc of Sword Art Online.  When Suguya is in her room, some stuffed toys are visible in the background.      Penguins resemble those from Mawaru Penguindrum, even available as stuffed toys:    However, the animation studio is different and the link between the two shows is not clear to me.

2521,Is Orience on Gran-Pulse somewhere?,"Final Fantasy Type-0 is set in Orience however it seems to be connected with Final Fantasy XIII as ultimately the world is being manipulated by  fal'Cie in the forms of    each nation's Crystal being a fal'Cie (as the Crystals can brand people l'Cie)     Arecia Al-Rashia who created the Crystals and a servant of the fal'Cie Pulse      Gala, servant of the fal'Cie Lindzei who leads the Rursan Army for Tempus Finis      Diva, a neutral observer who i don't know who she serves    and their goal is obviously to open Etro's gate as per the will of Bhunivelze .  since these fal'Cie seems to have came from Pulse or Lindzei and more or less going after the the same end goal Pulse's and Lindzei's fal'Cie on Gran-Pulse and Cocoon were after, does this mean that Orience is somewhere on Gran-Pulse? or is it another artificial world like Cocoon or something else?

2522,Is Kaio-ken increasing Goku's potential?,"We know that using Kaio-ken damages your body as you are forcing it to go beyond its limits. But is it also increasing your potential for the higher power? I mean as the body is facing the forced power up it will try to improve and endure that power the next time, right? I guess it works kinda like muscle training, the more you push your muscles the more they develop.  So can't Goku stay in the Kaio-ken mode for an extended period of time (while not fighting) to increase his capacities and go beyond Kaio-ken X20? "

2525,How come nobody noticed Chapra's slave brand at the tournament?,"In the first book of Osamu Tezuka's ""Buddha"", one of the main characters is Chapra, a shudra (member of the slave caste). He is marked as a shudra by a brand on his foot; at one point he even considers chopping of his foot to get rid of this mark.  Later on, Chapra manages to pretend that he is a member of the much higher Kshatriya (warrior) caste.  During this time, he participates in a tournament. The tournament takes several pages, and it is clearly shown that his feet are not covered.  So how come nobody at the tournament noticed his mark? Did Tezuka overlook this, or did I miss something? "

2527,Why does Horo call Lawrence Master?,"Horo calls Lawrence ""mushy-o"" (phonetics), which in the translation I'm watching is translated to ""Master"", which seems strange for a proud wolf.

2530,At what point did Aizen switch with Momo?,"During the battle of Aizen VS Shunsui, Soi-fon and Toshiro, at the end when Toshiro impales Aizen on his sword the barrier that was protecting Izuru and the injured Soul Reapers came down and Momo started to walk off in like a trance.  at that time Ichigo yells out what everyone was doing revealing that the entire time Aizen had activated Kyoka Suigetsu and Toshiro had just impaled Momo while the Momo that was with Izuru was in fact Aizen.  But when did Aizen switch with Momo? because   the answer to This question says that Kyoka Suigetsu was activated from the start Ichigo wasn't under the hypnosis of Kyoka Suigetsu which is why he could see that they had just stabbed Momo Momo had been in the barrier getting treated by Izuru There didn't seem to be any signs that Aizen had broke though the barrier to switch places with her When the Garganta opened and Ichigo returned he didn't hesitate to attack Aizen (though he did hesitate to use his Hollowfication but that was a different matter)   So do we know or can work out when Aizen switched with Momo to escape being stabbed by Toshiro?

Also, Homura was somehow able to void Madoka's wish and do whatever she wanted. None of this makes any sense.   How can a soul gem be tainted by anything but grief/despair?

Wouldn't they have to physically go there and get into her soul gem somehow? Were they just teleported there by Homura since she ""willed them to be there""? "

2536,"How did the ""silver devaluation"" scheme work?","I need help understanding what is going on with the Trenni silver coin scheme plot that is mentioned throughout episodes 3-7 of Spice and Wolf season 1. Let me explain what I understand and hopefully get some clarity about these Spice and Wolf episode plots (also if someone can block out the impending spoilers that would be awesome, I don't know how to do it)  So our main protagonist Lawrence gets word that the Trenni silver coin currency is about to go up in its silver purity. This means that both the actual metal value of the Trenni silver coin and its representative value will go up.       This all turns out to be wrong though, as Lawrence finds out the Trenni silver coins are actually becoming less pure and going down in value and what he was told was a lie. This plot then leads Lawrence to go over to the Milone trading company where somehow he hopes to make a profit off of telling the company this info.   Now this is where it gets complicated. How was the Milone trading company going to make money off of the devaluing currency and how was Medio involved with this?   In the anime the Milone Trading company,       upon hearing the devaluing silver info from Lawrence, started stockpiling Trenni silver coins. Why are they trying to stockpile the silver coins if their price and purity is going down? Shouldn't they be trying to get rid of all of their Trenni silver coins if the value is decreasing?    Also it is mentioned that the Medio trading company is       hiring people to give merchants the wrong info about how the Trenni silver coins are going up in value instead of actually going down. Lawrence was even told this lie. How does the Medio Trading company possibly gain any advantage from this?     Basically I am asking what is the economic plot in the episodes 3-7 of Spice and Wolf season 1, explained in little kid terms, so I can hopefully comprehend what is going on in the story and enjoy the anime even more. I am sorry for not being more economics-savvy with this, but if you understand the plot be much appreciated for some insight. "

2542,How is it possible to run out of Haki?,"In One Piece, Luffy has a technique called ""Gear 4th"", which allows him to transform into an enhanced version of himself, further bolstered by Haki. This technique has a time limit, and when time is up, Luffy reverts back to his normal form, and cannot use Haki for 10 minutes. This is mentioned in Chapter 728.  Unlike other shounen series, Haki is an ability that is fueled by the user's willpower. It is not dependent on their physical strength or stamina. This is further proven when Sanji was able to still use his Haki normally, even when trapped in Nami's body during the Punk Hazard arc.  So my question is, how is it possible for a person -especially a person as strong willed as Luffy- to run out of willpower? Is willpower something that can just ""run out"" like that? "
2543,What or who can kill Orochimaru's life force?,"Where is Orochimaru's life force bounded? Why doesn't he die like others?    First at Orochimaru's den, Sasuke tried to kill Orochimaru while Orochimaru tried to take over Sasuke's body. Then later in the manga, during the fight between Sasuke and Itachi, Orochimaru was revealed to be partly present inside Sasuke, where Itachi dealt with him. Now, after Edo, Itachi and Sasuke beat Kabuto. Sasuke was able to pull out Orochimaru from Kabuto.   Why is that Orochimaru can survive in different distributed forms? How is his life force immortal?  (Sasori was able to survive using puppets for his real body, but the life force was bounded to his heart, so when the heart died, so did Sasori.)  What or who can kill him permanently? (except the author)  PS : I did read the question at this question but what I am interested in knowing is different. "

2546,What's the meaning of the spell's name that Wendy uses to cure Natsu's vehicle-sickness?,"In chapter 152 Wendy cures Natsu's sickness for vehicles. When doing this enchantment/spell she says TROIA:    What does that mean? Is it just a random word?  I ask this because troia is the Italian word for whore, but I hope it isn't related to this.  I'm reading the manga in English, so that's not an Italian translation. "
2547,"In 5 Centimeters per Second, why was Takaki struggling in love?","It is quite an old movie. Still...  SPOILER ALERT  I finished watching the movie and manga a few years ago. I've just finished the novel by Shinkai-sensei.  After watching and reading through these, I completely can't figure out why Takaki's relationships couldn't last.  He had 3 relationships, 2 during his university life and 1 with Mizuno. Let's just put the first two aside, I think he's going well with Mizuno. But, at last, when he took Mizuno to the station where he and Akari met each other again, he just couldn't and cried. Why?  Because judging from the novel, it seems like he was not trapped in the memories with Akari when he was going out of Mizuno, not to say that he'd forgotten the memories.  In my opinion, the last scene, where Akari and Takaki passed by each other, only Takaki was relieved and really started to move on.   But what really was Tataki's struggle? "

I'm talking about the cross-over style or the re-using of anime characters from one of their manga creations to another and the diverging of their stories. CLAMP is known for that style and it was loosely defined as the ""Clamp Universe"" or ""Clamp Multiverse"".

Is there anything new added or modified in the movies, or are they just summaries of the TV series? If there are any additions or modifications, would you please list them out?  I am aware that the content is compressed, so it is expected that many scenes from the TV series will be shortened to squeeze 675 minutes' worth of content into 120 (Gurren-hen) + 130 (Lagann-hen) = 250 minutes of the 2 movies. I am only interested in the new scenes and modifications to existing plot. An exclusion caused by modification to existing plot also counts. "
2555,Has a bankai ever been silently activated?,"To activate a Bankai or its ability, is the user required to perform some verbal command activation?   For example, Ichigo often yells     Bankai: Tensa Zangetsu   However, I'm pretty sure that I've read some silent activations, but I can't remember for sure.  So has a Bankai ever been activated without a vocal command?   Note that this is not a duplicate of Can a mute activate a zanpakutou, as that question asks whether it is possible. And this question asks if a silent activation has ever happened in the series.  "
2556,How strong is Trunks in Dragon Ball Super?,"One of the last episodes of Dragon Ball Super raised me this question.  Trunks fights alongside Goku against Black and Zamazu in Super Saiyan 2 state. But how strong he really is? In the fight Goku is Super Saiyan Blue and black Super Saiyan Rose, but he is able to score some succesful punches/attacks to Black and Zamazu, even though it doesn't hurt them. At the beginning of his appearance in Dragon Ball Super he is shown to fight Dabura. Later he is knocked in a training match against Goku Super Saiyan 3 (did he have a zenkai boost there?), and later he is knocked by Vegeta when training with him in Super Saiyan Blue (did he have another zenkai boost there?). And I've heard that in the manga he's a match for Goku in Super Saiyan 3, plus some mental training he has made since his appearance. Is Trunks now stronger than a Super Saiyan 2, may be at the level of a Super Saiyan 3? Or is he fighting alongside Blue and Rose super saiyajins just a plot-hole?  We've seen a super saiyan 2 can be at the level of a super saiyan 3 already when Beerus tell to Vegeta that he made he uses more of his power in his fight (1% he says) than Goku in Super Saiyan 3. "
2557,"Why are there so many ""in Wonderland"" episodes?","Many series that I have seen have ""x in Wonderland"" episodes where they have retellings/variations of Alice in Wonderland with the characters from the show. Examples of this include Ouran High School Host Club (episode 13), Black Butler (season 2 OVA 1 and 4), Cardcaptor Sakura (episode 55), and Code Geass (OVA). What is the origin of this?

2560,Why does Ed not pursue the origin of the fake Philosopher's stone used by Cornello?,"In the first chapter of Fullmetal Alchemist, Ed and Al come across Father Cornello at the city of Reole.       The Elric brothers Edward and Alphonse discover, soon after arriving in Reole, that Cornello's 'miracles' are nothing more than alchemy augmented by a Philosopher's Stone that the priest has in his possession.   One of the biggest rules of Alchemy is Equivalent Exchange, and Ed sees Cornello obviously breaking those rules, something that should have been impossible in Alchemy without the philosopher's stone.     Ed and Al have been searching for the Philosophers Stone as a way of returning their bodies back to how it was. Even if it wasn't a complete Philosopher's stone, the fact Cornello was able to bypass equivalent exchange should have been incredibly significant in itself and pursuing this lead would likely have lead them a step closer to their goal.       And it was later revealed that a Homunculus was behind the incident.   However, Ed, upon realising the stone was not a true philosopher's stone, left the town. Why is this? Did he, for some reason, think of it as unimportant, and if so, why?  "
2561,"Why did Father create his ""children"" as the 7 deadly sins?","In both the manga and the 2nd anime (FMA Brotherhood) homunculi are willingly created. As far as I understand it, Father was created (or rather summoned from the other side of the door?) back at Xerxis before using the entire city to create a powerful philosopher's stone for himself and van Hohenheim.  Some time passed by and father started creating other homunculi, each named after and behaving according to a deadly sin. They are fueled by parts of Father's stone and are powerful subordinates, but neither Greed nor Sloth nor Gluttony use their power to any mentionable extent for Father's benefit.  It is commented by van Hohenheim (and apparently the commonly excepted ""truth"" as seen in this post) that Father wanted to get rid of these ""human"" weaknesses. But that obviously didn't work: He still is immensely proud, so he sits alone in the center of the state, never standing up, making subordinates and machines do everything for him, thinking of himself as the best and most powerful being on earth and working towards becoming a ""perfect being""; He is greedy, so even though he has a powerful philosopher's stone and can create others from criminals and war casualties, he creates a stone way stronger than his old one has ever been and uses its power to enslave god and steal his/her/their/its power.  And he would have been successful if his underlings had used their powers to their whole extent instead of being too lazy, dumb, or greedy to do so. Van Hohenheim barely completed the inversion circle in time, and with faster digging at Sloth's end and Greed/ Gluttony going on a rampage to enforce the needed bloodshed, Father would have won. (Sure he still needed the sacrifices but as we see in the show, he can somehow make someone a sacrifice by force or he could have just ordered state alchemists to do things that made them become sacrifices. And that's not even the point.)  Is there another reason that I overlooked in the anime or that has been given in the manga why he created his ""children"" the way he did? Or a reference on why the plan of getting rid of these character flaws did actually work but just not entirely? "
2562,Why are Kakyoin and Polnareff so pleased about knowing the same hand signals?,"In episode 24 of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Stardust Crusaders, Polnareff takes advantage of a dangerous situation to show off his knowledge of hand signals. A video of this can be found here.  Kakyoin recognises the hand signal as meaning ""Your underwear is showing"", which greatly pleases Polnareff. The two of them share some kind of elaborate handshake to mark the occasion, the eyes of both characters being darkened (which, as far as I understand, usually indicates seriousness).  What on Earth is going on here? Why do Kakyoin and Polnareff know this, why is Polnareff so pleased and why do they share an elaborate hand shake afterwards? "
2563,Which is the first D-Mail?,"I think the common explanation for the shift in timelines is that ""In episode 1, Okabe sends the 1st D-mail, changing the world to the Alpha world line where Kurisu lives instead of dying.""  However, the mail Okabe sends is just an ordinary mail (have they even invented the D-Mail yet?), it is directed to Daru, and it only contains information from the past that anyone could have witnessed. How does this message turn into a D-Mail and tip off SERN? "
2564,"Are Hollows defeated by humans who are not Quincies considered as destroyed or ""purified""?","If I remember correctly, Shinigami are ""purifying"" Hollows with Zanpakuto, cleansing souls and sending them to Soul Society (not counting cases when souls are going to Hell). And regarding Quincy, it was said that the main conflict between Quincies and Shinigami was that, unlike Shinigami, Quincies were destroying souls when killing Hollows, which was bad for balance.  In series, it was shown numerous times that Hollows can also be defeated by humans having certain abilities, for example, Yasutora Sado, Orihime Inoue, Hanakari Jinta, etc. So, what happens with Hollow soul in this case? Is it exorcised, or destroyed, just like by Quincy hand? "
2565,How can Rock Lee stand on water?,"According to what I have seen, Rock lee isn't able to use ninjutsu nor genjutsu. However, it was shown that he can walk on water. Isn't walking on water a part of chakra control which he isn't able to perform? If he can control chakra then why not perform ninjutsu (doesn't need to be good at it, but at-least perform it.)  Also I am unable to understand how can he open the inner gates of chakra if chakra control is a problem for him? "
2566,How many kinds of guns have been used in Highschool of the Dead?,I wonder how many guns have been shown to be used by the characters? And are these real guns? Or are these just some made-up weapons? 
2567,How can Kyros run so fast?,"I know that Kyros is a legendary gladiator from Corrida Colosseum who was turned into a toy by Sugar. He cuts his left foot off to save King Riku (if I'm not mistaken). But, how can he run so fast with only one foot? Even when he is a toy, he can run quite as fast and in a human body, he can take the stairs to Flower Hill faster than Luffy. How can it happen? Is he using something like Sanji's Sky Walk or CP9's Geppo? "
2568,What conditions trigger becoming an undead,"In Episode 30 of the latest Jojo series, JoJo no Kimyou na Bouken Part 5: Ougon no Kaze, Giorno notices that Bucciarati became an undead and Bucciarati hypothesizes that his strong will was probably a factor at play. That, however, does not add up because lots of people who have died including Abbacchio and the previous Passione Capos had very strong will.  My question comes in 2 parts. Firstly, apart from a strong will, what other factor(s) cause a person to become an undead after they die? Secondly, why are the Stands of the undead not affected by harm done to their physical bodies? "
2569,What happened at the end of Tokyo Ghoul?,"I am a bit confused by Tokyo Ghoul season 2's ending. Why was Hide bitten, and by who or what? Was it in that ""war""? Or did Kaneki bite him?   And why did Yomo stop Touka when she was running to Kaneki (it was at the moment when he was carrying Hide)? Was it just because he did not wanted to let her be killed? Or was it something deeper?  "
2570,Who is this character being cosplayed in Japan Expo 2014?,"This is a snapshot from JAPAN EXPO 2014. I don't know the character, so does anyone know who this character is? Here is the source video.   "
2571,Is Doflamingo blind in one eye?,"There's a theory about that Doflamingo wears his iconic glasses because he's blind to his (IIRC) left eye. It was assumed because whenever his eyes were shown (quite rarely), it was actully always only the left one.  Is there anything we can know about it in canon? Any kind of disease of injury that would possibly, even theoretically justify it? "
2572,Name of the song that Conan played in Season 1 Episode 11: Moonlight Sonata Murder Case,What is the name of the song that Conan played in Season 1 Episode 11: Moonlight Sonata Murder Case at 08:27? Here is the link to the video. 
2573,"Ending of ""91 Days""","At the end of 91 Days, Angelo and Nero are walking on the beach and after Angelo walks past him, Nero      aims his pistol and fires a shot.   We never really see what happens to Angelo, as Nero drives off (with a can of pineapples?) and their footsteps are washed away by the ocean surf.  Did Angelo      get shot? Or was this another replay of the shot from 9 years ago when Nero's shot missed Angelo when he was a kid running away?   And I probably missed something at some point, but why the pineapples?  "
2574,"To do a 'Unison Raid', do you have to have the same type of magic?","In Fairy Tail, does it matter what type of magic two wizards use in order to perform a unison raid? Okay, I understand the Gray and Juvia have done unison raids before, but both of their magics have the same concept just in different forms. But let's say someone like Natsu, or anyone with a type of Lost Magic (dragon slayers) were to perform a unison raid with Mirajane, for example.   Specifically, my friend is writing a fanfiction on Fairy Tail, where the main character is a dragon slayer, and she also has another certain magic that was passed down from her mother, a type of lost magic (a musical magic, where if the character sings or plays any instrument, the sound waves attack the opponent, and because of the whole thing with the      Dragon Slayers with their dragons being inside of them, and making   antibodies so they wouldn't turn into dragons, (somehow) turned into   her forms that she can use for this lost magic, that's are crazy   powerful.   My friend isn't really sure if she can perform a unison raid with Mirajane, because they both sing, because Mira doesn't have this lost magic. So is this possible?  (Sorry if it's really long) "
2575,Who invented the Rasengan: Jiraiya or Minato?,"Was it Minato who invented the Rasengan, or was it Jiraya? All I know is that Jiraiya taught Naruto the Rasengan. Who is the original creator?  "
2576,Do the people of Kioka follow the Alderan religion?,"In Tenkyou no Alderamin, the Katjvarna Empire (where Ikta and friends live) has as its state religion the Alderan religion. In episode 10, we learn that they aren't the only such state - the ""home"" of the religion is actually a theocracy lying to the north of the Empire (which reminds me quite a bit of the Papal States).   What of the Republic of Kioka, which lies to the east of the Empire? Do they also follow the Alderan religion? We know that they make use of the sprites, but - as demonstrated by the Sinack people - sprite worship does not necessarily imply veneration of Alderamin. (I guess there isn't anything to say that the people of Kioka even worship the sprites - they could just as well see them as friendly little bioweapons.) "
2577,Tennouji Yuusha?,"In episode 4 of Rewrite minute 6:50-6:55, during the flash back between Tennouji Koutarou and Nakatsu Shizuru, Koutarou introduced his name as Tennouji Yuusha. When Shizuru called him Yuusha-senpai, he corrected it into Tennouji Koutarou.  In Ansatsu Kyoushitsu (Assassination Classroom), Kimura Masayoshi (木村 正義) was called Justice. His name, Masayoshi, while usually read as Masayoshi, it is actually read as Seigi, which means justice.  My question is, why did he introduce himself as Tennouji Yuusha? His name is written as 天王寺 瑚太郎, while Yuusha is written as 勇者. How did he get Koutarou into Yuusha? Or is this all part of his Chuunibyou? "
2578,"In the manga, what evidence did readers have about the identity of Miyu's brother?","Spoilers up to but not including the flashback arc in 3rei:      In the Prisma Illya anime, the fact that Miyu's brother is (Miyuverse) Shirou becomes obvious fairly early on. The scene early on in the first season (""1in""?) where Miyu mentions that Illyaverse Shirou reminds her of her brother already points strongly in that direction, as do the short still-frames of him we see in Miyu's memories during 2wei Herz.   Early in 3rei, Illya and Gil meet Miyu's brother, and though we don't get a clear visual on him, we hear Sugiyama Noriaki speak - that settles it for anyone who had any doubt.   However, I have heard that manga-readers weren't 100% sure about the identity of Miyu's brother until he shows up to fight the Ainsworths and utters ""Trace On"". I can see how this could be the case - if his appearance was better-concealed in the manga, that plus the fact that the manga is not voiced could have kept readers guessing for a while.    So - what evidence did manga-readers have about the identity of Miyu's brother prior to the definitive reveal?  "
2579,Why did Nibutani Shinka changed her hair color?,Why did Nibutani Shinka returned her hair color to light brown after dyeing it black in the first episode of Chu2byou! Ren (2nd season of Chu2byou anime)? Was it explained anywhere? 
2580,Do people die if they are killed?,"In Fate/Stay Night there's the famous scene in which Shirou speaks to Saber. The scene gained immense popularity across the web, and is usually accompanied by responses like O RLY? and You Don't Say!  The question is, does he actually say that? Is that line also written in the Visual Novel? Is this a translation error? Or is he just that stupid? "
2581,"How many times has Mob reached 100%, and what emotion surfaced each time?","When Mob reaches 100%, his esper powers explode and some emotion surfaces.   How many times did he reach 100% (not how many times he exploded)? What emotion surfaced each time? Supply chapter / episode reference for each event if possible.  "
2582,Where does Little Red Riding Hood appear?,"I was looking over the TYPE-MOON Wikia for new images and saw one which made me think of Assassin of Black in Fate/Apocrypha. However, under ""Appears on these pages"", it was listed to be in the List of minor characters.  In her profile it says:     Little Red Riding Hood (赤ずきん, ?) is a resident of Fuyuki City who died in a family suicide in Semina Apartments, whose death has become a ghost story involving Mr. A told by Ayako Mitsuduri.   Since Ayako Mitsuduri is the one who tells the story, I would assume she's in Fate/Stay Night, but I don't remember any side stories in the original visual novel (maybe in Realta Nua?) or any mention of her in Studio Deen's adaptation of the Fate Route.  So where does she appear? "
2583,Are these constellations real?,"  Are these poke-constellations real ? If so , then how do the constellations relate to the Pokémon , of vice versa ? And would you also please explain any other information you may have about the constellation and Pokémon relationship ? Or are these constellations just and only in the anime ? "
2584,"Why isn't blood pink in the Future Arc (Mirai-hen), like it is on other Danganronpa media?","In the first Danganronpa anime series (2013), blood is pink to prevent the series from having to have a higher age rating.   In Danganronpa 3: The End of Kibougamine Gakuen - Zetsubou-hen (2016), the ""Despair Arc,"" blood is also pink:    The first time blood was seen in Danganronpa 3: The End of Kibougamine Gakuen - Mirai-hen (2016), the ""Future Arc,"" the setting was pretty dark, so I wondered whether that made the blood not look pink or if it was actually not pink. In episode 5, we get a clear view of red blood, though:      Given that the ""Future Arc"" is set after all the events in the other pieces of the franchise, is it possible that something changed in-universe? Or does the ""Future Arc"" air at a different time, which makes the rating not as important for the producers of the show?  Someone in reddit suggests that it's only so the gag with the tomato sauce in the third episode, when pretending Asahina had been killed, is possible — that's obviously (?) not the case, is it? "
2585,Is there any humor or meaning to the conversation about Yuri's dream and how many Hinatas there were?,"In episode 5, Otonashi and Angel had a conversation about Yuri's dream and how many Hinatas there were, which seemed totally random and out of nowhere. When I first watched that episode, I didn't get the humor and meaning that I expected were there in the conversation. Is there a joke or meaning to those remarks, or are they just some disposable lines?    The curious conversation between Otonashi and Angel     音無：「すまん！ゆりの調子が不安定だ。 原因は、昨夜夢に日向が出てきて……」      日向：『今日の俺と明日の俺が同じ俺だと思うな。気を付けな。』      音無：「……と忠告してきたことによる。そして今、その忠告が事実であることをゆりが証明しちまったところなんだ。」      天使：「日向君は二人いるの？」      音無：「あ、ああ、そういうことになる。」      天使：「三人以上いるかもしれない？」      音無：「え？ああ、ありえる。」      天使：「お気の毒に。」             Otonashi: Sorry! Yuri's a little emotionally unstable. Because last night, Hinata showed up in her dream and—      Hinata: Don't think that the me from today and tomorrow will be the same. Watch out.      Otonashi: That's what he said, and Yuri just proved it.      Angel: Are there two Hinata-kun's?      Otonashi: Y-Yeah... that's right.      Angel: Is there a chance that there's more than three of him?      Otonashi: Huh? Oh, uh... it's possible.      Angel: I'm sorry to hear that.  "
2586,How does a mangaka get paid?,"From what I have seen from anime and heard, doujinshi artists get paid per book they sell at places like Comiket or online, but you have some mangaka who release one chapter per issue of serialized magazines like Shounen Jump and Comic Yuri Hime.  So, how does a mangaka get paid for their work? Does this change when they release more of their work which then spawns the creation of other adaptations and merchandise? "
2587,Significance of Aang's left eye and hand lighting up,"According to the Avatar series, the solar eclipse is when the Fire Nation was at its weakest. Why do Aang's left hand and eye light up? I don't believe he is left handed, so what is the significance?     "
2588,Law vs Breed: why didn't Law use room to remove collars?,"Law's room ability is a very strong technique, and he can use it to slice whatever he wants.  Why doesn't he use it when fighting against Breed to remove collars from other animal and chopper?  I don't know the chapter but it's on episode 626.  Here is a YouTube link. "
2589,Why does Zamasu know Goku in the future?,"So Zamasu created Black in the future because of Goku, right? But, we know that Goku died in the future because of an illness... a long time before he met Zamasu.   So how is it possible that Zamasu knows Goku in the future?  "
2590,What does the pink note left by Taiga say?,"In Episode 25 near 11:23, Ryuji goes to Taiga's condo and finds a note. What is written on it?   "
2591,How can a human like Yuto or Abe no Seimei live in Magano?,"In the 16 and 17th episode, we can see that Yuto probably lives in Magano since he appeared out of nowhere and left by jumping around, presumably to his hideout, instead of using Magano Gate directly.  Also, in episode 18, we can see Yuto placing flowers on the Hinatsuki Dorm in Magano, waiting for Rokuro to arrive. This means he is somehow, at least, camping there.  Also, according to the wiki,     Abe no Seimei is still alive in Magano   Is it possible for humans to 'camp' in Magano? Do humans who pass through the Magano gate not need nourishment? "
2592,Where is Yui stored in SAO II?,"We know that Yui was saved in Kirito's NervGear's local memory in the first season of Sword Art Online but in in the second season when Kirito is in Gun Gale Online, when everyone is watching Battle of Bullets Yui is there with everyone else watching it in ALO. she also talks to Asuna on her phone when she heads off to the hospital and in Agil's bar when Kirito sets up the cameras for her.  in all of these cases Kirito isn't using his NervGear and i would suspect it is turned off. so where is Yui now stored? and how is she able to go from this place to ALO, Asuna's Mobile and the cameras in Agil's bar? "
2593,Are all the angels children of the Great Priest?,"According to the Dragon Ball wikia article Great Priest  Vados, Whis, Cus, Marcarita, Martinu and Korn are children of the Great Priest. What about the other angels? Are they also children of the Great Priest or who's his father? "
2594,What is intended by a spiral on a character's finger and what is the origin of this trope?,"I am sure many of you have come across this trope in some anime/manga, where a character gives a thumbs up with an imprinted spiral.       The spiral is probably a simplified hanamaru:    which basically has the same meaning as a thumbs up, or ""good job"".  The focus of this question, however, is on the spiral that appears on the index finger.     In the two examples shown above, the characters were obviously not showing approval, so the idea of the spiral being a simplified hanamaru is out.  Someone has asked the same question here:     Spirals. Just spirals. Apparently there are ""spirals of depression"" and ""spirals of happiness?"" I think I heard the depression spirals are meant to represent ""sad spirits/ghosts"" or something like that? But if the character has spirals on her cheeks, she's happy. If there's a spiral on her finger when she points at you, she's being triumphant or prideful. Can anyone clear this up? :3    Is there any source to that statement in bold?  My question is: what is the intended effect of the spiral on a character's index finger, and where did this trope or art style originate from? "
2595,Is Lelouch's Geass limited in what it can tell people to do?,"Yes, I know that Lelouch can only use his Geass once per person, but can he control everything? I mean, if he says ""I command you to do whatever I say"", will it work?  "
2596,Why does the use of CGI in anime seem unrealistic as compared to other western animations?,"In recent times more and more series are animated with CGI, mostly a combination of 3D objects with 2D illustrations. For example, Berserker in Fate/Zero.  More recent examples include Ajin and Kingdom, etc. God Eater also used CGI techniques for animation. However, except for a few scenes, I always feel the movement of objects is slow, unsteady and frankly quite unrealistic. Take an example of sword fights in Kingdom and let's say something like Bleach (not the overall animation, just some action sequences). Though both require suspension of disbelief the ones in Kingdom are way below.   Comparing this to many western animations we can see they do a great job with 3D animation. Why is this a problem in anime? Is it related to costs or the decision to use lower fps or something else? "
2597,What is COMITIA? Is it different than Comiket?,"In Pixiv, sometimes I saw that as title. Here is the example: [ COMITIA119 ] 星の花束. Seems like it's a doujin. This is the first image (cover) - if anyone interested.    I found from Google that Comitia is a legal assembly of the people from ancient Republican Rome (seems like totally unrelated). At first I thought it's Comiket, but there's only 92 Comiket so far.  So what's COMITIA and what does the number represent? Seems like it's related to comiket after all. So how does it different than comiket? "
2598,Why didn't the Geass work on Kallen the second time?,Why didn't the geass work on Kallen the second time Lelouch used it?   [website]
2599,Why does Suzuki speak in both English and Japanese?,"In Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress, one of the ""steam smiths"" speaks in Japanese with bits and phrases in plain English. His name is Suzuki, and he is one of the steam smiths that fixes damage to the train:    As you can see here in this video, he mixes in regular English words like ""captain,"" and ""tank,"" with the rest of his Japanese dialogue. There are no other characters that do this. Why does he include random English words in his sentences (it seems that the English words may even be voiced by someone else, as they sound incredibly out of place with the Japanese dialogue)? "
2600,Why is the childhood friend trope commonly seen in anime?,"I've noticed that most anime, especially in genres like slice of life and romantic comedies,  there is at least one character that plays  the role of the childhood friend (osananajimi). This is often coupled with the unrequited love, girl next door, or other related tropes.  Of course, childhood friends are in every culture out there, but I'm curious if Japan has a special reason for this particular occurrence in anime shows. Also, aside from gender inclination towards the shounen genre, why is it that most osananajimi are girls whereas in real life, our childhood friends are typically of the same sex? Is this occurence more prevalent in Japan than in other cultures?  And feel free to edit (especially the title) and/or comment if this question is off-topic. "
2601,Who do the hands that help form Naruto's Final Rasengan belong to?,"Here is the video of Naruto's Final Rasengan in episode 477.  The hands of many friends, parents, and teachers of Naruto Uzamaki were shown shaping and enlarging together his Rasengan:    My questions are:   What is the meaning of this scene? What is the chronological list of characters of the Naruto universe who contributed to his Rasengan (with irrefutable evidence)?   "
2602,Was Shadorian Civilization technologically advanced?,"This question pertains to One Piece.      I know that Skypians, Birkans, and Shandorians came from the moon. But they should've been technologically advanced right? But Shandorians like Calgara seem to be a small tribe with zero knowledge of poneglyphs etc. Also, they seem to believe in rituals/superstition etc even though they were once an advanced civilization that lived on the moon. Also, they seem way too backward in terms of science and technology. How did that happen?    Also if that's true, then are Poneglyphs a way to find out the story about earth or moon? "
2603,Do manga publishers accept mangas from multiple artists under one pen-name?,"Is it allowed for a single legal mangaka entity to consist of multiple artists, each of which does different part of the job, like in Bakuman? For example, one makes the stories and the other does the drawing. Will a manga publisher work with such teams?  "
2604,What does Satella whisper to Subaru as he spams declarations of his return by death?,"The answer here How and why is Subaru connected to the Witch (Satella)? hints that it might be ""I love you"", and that communication with Satella becomes clearer the more Subaru dies (and more loops trigger, bringing his timeline/world closer to Satella's). [Citation needed]   What does Satella tell Subaru as he spams declarations of his ability? I was wondering if she generally says the same thing each time (so removing the case when Subaru took Betelgeuse along for the ride), if it was intentionally muted in the anime in previous instances. Does the LN/WN have her silently whisper?   "
2605,Who is this man in the cover page of One Piece chapter 839?,"In the cover page of chapter 839 of One Piece, there's a man on large bounty poster that Luffy draw number 3 on his face.        It seems that all Mugiwara crew give some respect to this man, even Chopper looks like he's crying for him.  I don't think he is the character on One Piece, is this some kind of tribute from Oda to someone? So, who is he? "
2606,"Who is the most-connected (in the ""six degrees"" sense) seiyuu?","A lot of you probably know about Kevin Bacon and how he's supposedly the most connected among Hollywood artists.     Who is the most-connected anime voice actor (seiyuu)?   I've seen in some places that either of Yuji Ueda or Megumi Hayashibara could be the Kevin Bacon of seiyuu, but has anybody ever done the graph of the interconnections between voice actors to support this claim?  (I'm only counting voices in the original Japanese, and not dubs.) "
2607,"What is the connection between the manga and movie of ""Abyss of Hyperspace""?","When I watched the anime Bodacious Space Pirates, I learned that it was based on the Light Novel series Miniskirt Space Pirates. However, there was also a sequel movie planned called Abyss of Hyperspace.  While I was looking at the Yuricon website, I found a listing for Bodacious Space Pirates: Abyss of Hyperspace Vol. 1.  So I am wondering what is the connection between the manga and movie of Miniskirt Space Pirates: Abyss of Hyperspace? Are they an adaptation of one another or are they continuing their own media (the manga follows the light novel while the movie follows the anime)? "
2608,Who is Mizuki Kusanagi's father?,Mizuki Kusanagi is Suito Kusanagi's daugher who is about to outgrow her soon.  At first I thought her father would be Kurita Jinroh. However he only arrived at the base 7 months prior to the start of the movie. Does this mean:   Suito Kusanagi has been alive since Mizuki was born? And the father is unknown? Mizuki grows very fast?  
2609,Where did the Haganai and Oreimo cameo appear?,"It's been a while seen I last watched haganai and oreimo, and I remember there was a cameo role in a certain episode. Problem is, I don't even remember in which of the two anime and season it happened, just that there was a cameo of the main group of characters.  Can someone point out to me where it appeared and what happened in the cameo? Also, was it reciprocated by the other anime in the pair? "
2610,How was it SHIKI saved Shiki?,"In Kara no Kyoukai 4: The Hollow Shrine when Ryougi Shiki is in a coma after throwing herself in front of a truck, her other persona, SHIKI, seems to trade places with Shiki as she's falling. It's later revealed by Touko that SHIKI gave his life to save Shiki.  So how was it SHIKI saved Shiki while she was in a coma? What was happening to Shiki that would allow SHIKI to trade places and cease to exist? "
2611,How and why does Wilhelm win against Theresia?,"So we know that Reinhard is brokenly overpowered with all the blessings he has.  (A google of ""re zero reinhard blessings"" will bring up a fair number of sources describing roughly the same list.)  Even if we assume that his grandmother Theresia only had the Sword Saint one ""Sword Saint: Swordsmanship maxes out, and become able to draw Raid, the Dragon Sword."".  How does Wilhelm defeat her in a sword fight as witnessed in the anime, before they sort of become a couple. Does the light novel or web novel shed more light on this?   Or did Wilhelm seriously outfight the sword saint in a sword fight? I assume she still had at least the sword saint blessing, as their grandchild Reinhard didn't exist yet to take the blessing from her yet. "
2612,How did Madara really obtain his Eternal Mangekyou Sharingan?,"Regarding Madara's Eternal Mangekyou Sharingan, there are three canon stories on how he obtained it.  The first version is mentioned by Itachi, while explaining the Mangekyou to Sasuke. In this version, he tells that Madara took his brother's eyes. Itachi shows the scene to Sasuke through Genjutsu, where Madara places his fingers over Izuna's eye and Izuna is surprised by the action. This would mean a forceful extraction.  The second version is told by Obito, acting as Madara. He explains to Sasuke that Izuna willingly gave his eyes to him (Madara), to protect the clan from the dangers of the fame.  The third version is told by the First Hokage, Hashirama Senju, when he was reincarnated by Orochimaru. He tells that Izuna succumbed to the wounds (during the warring period) caused by Tobirama Senju. And it is assumed that Madara took his brother's eyes after he died.  So which version is the actual one? Or is it a mix of all three? "
2613,Can Zeno really not die?,"We know that Zeno is an immortal. No matter how old he gets or how badly he is injured, he won't die. However, that's only true because of the indestructible body bestowed upon him by one of the dragons.  We also know that the dragons' powers can be passed on. When Kija, Shin-Ah, and Jae-Ha were born, their predecessors weakened and eventually lost their powers along with their lives. When the first Hakuryuu, Seryuu, and Rokuryuu left Hiryu Castle, they left with their tribes and only in those tribes would the next dragons be born.   Did the dragons pass on their genes along with their powers? If Zeno passes on his genes, would his ability also be passed on so he could finally die? "
2614,How can Mewtwo Mega Evolve?,"Mewtwo being an artificial pokemon, how can it mega Evolve? Has the mechanics of Mewtwo mega Evolution been explained in the Genesect movie, game or any other canon? "
2615,Was there any hint of the year before it is revealed?,"Before we find out that there is a three year gap between Taki and Mitsuha, were there any visible signs that the audience could have determined the date gap with? The anime has recent technology such as smart phones but it seems that the year was always absent from the screen when they were in the diary application or memos.   They were sorted by date, but seemingly neither of them noticed that there was a time gap until this moment. Odd that they could go to school and never have to write the year down on their papers they submit, but I'm just wondering if there was any way for us, as viewers, to have noticed the date discrepancy beforehand? "
2616,Did Meruem propose to Komugi by asking her to hold his hand?,"I was reading on a forum that the author/mangaka of the ""Hunter x Hunter"" series was trying to ""tell"" the readers that Meruem asked Komugi to be his wife by telling her to hold his hand. Is it true? Or he was just afraid to die alone, with the hand of Komugi making him feel safer (or at least that's what I understood from that scene)? "
2617,Inconsistency with regard to an event in the Resurrection of Freiza Arc and the Future Trunks arc,"During the ROF arc, we see Gohan powering up to his maximum (to an extent capable of almost of destroying himself), to allow Goku to detect his energy and use the instant transmission and get back from Beerus's world.  In episode 47 right before the Future Trunks arc, while Goku and Picollo are picking lettuce off the field, when Goku tries to go to Beerus's world, we see him not being able to detect Vegeta's energy until he turns SSJB. Him not being able to the first time, when he found out that Vegeta had gone off training on his own makes sense because Vegeta had gotten a lot stronger and it was stated that his ki was completely different. This time around, it didn't. It's obvious base Vegeta was a lot stronger than what Gohan powered up to during the ROF arc.  To top it all off, once Bulma contacts Vegeta and Goku regarding Future Trunks, we see Kid Trunks turning SSJ and barely powering up which was sufficient for Goku to find. Kid Trunks wasn't obviously stronger than Gohan or powered up to the extent Gohan did during the ROF arc. Which again doesn't make sense.  Many might argue that this is because Goku is now used to travelling to and fro and he wasn't then but you have to realise that instant transmission has nothing to do with being familiar with the place. It has to do more with detecting ki.  Is this in general bad writing and inconsistencies? Or is there a particular reason for the above listed events? "
2618,"Did Vegeta ever called Goku his earth name ""Goku"" in Japanese dub?","I recalled that Vegeta once said ""Goku"" in episode 72 of English dub. Does Vegeta said his earth name ""Goku"" in Japanese dub too? How many times did Vegeta said ""Goku"" throughout the series? And when is it? "
2619,What is the name of song from Code Geass in episode 5 when the Lancelot is saving Jeremiah?,"What is the name of song from Code Geass in episode 5 when the Lancelot is saving Jeremiah? I can't find it or any covers of it anywhere, it starts at 1:16 here:  [website]"
2620,Does the Steam version of Wonderful Everyday VN have upscaled CG?,"I'd like to buy Wonderful Everyday VN. I know that this VN is an old one. The CG was made around 2000-2010 in 480p.   Does the Steam version of this VN have the CG upscaled from 480p to 720p? Or do  they still use the 480p CG like the Japanese version?   I mean, I saw the CG on the internet, the VN still have the black bar for both side like it was made around 2000, is this same with the Steam version? "
2621,Why did Aoi suddenly hesitate to suffocate Asuha in the last episode of Qualidea Code?,"Asuha and Aoi were fighting against each other and the latter one was about to win. Just when she was about to suffocate Asuha, Aoi had a short flashback and then she loosened her arm which opened a chance for Asuha to turn the table around.  Did she do that simply because Aoi still had some lingering attachment to Asuha as a friend or comrade? And why did the flashback show Asuha alone (without her brother) after probably waking up from the deep sleep?   "
2622,When did Kagami first attend a Comiket?,"In Episode 12, the Hiiragi twins accompany Konata to a Comiket. While it is Tsukasa's first time there, Kagamin has apparently visited before (with Konata). Is this earlier visit (sans Tsukasa) covered in the anime? How about the manga?  Screenshots (clickable) from E12:  From ~1:50 where Konata tries to trick Miyuki into coming along:    The following snapshots are from ~3:30.     "
2623,What timeslips did Aoshima screw up to cause that snowball effect on later TSs?,"At the first timeslips he had that suburban life with Ai, but later on, the timeslips were getting more and more locked until he gets to the ""goes to Africa and dies"" inexorable ending.  Supposing he changed the future only when he acted on info obtained from a TS, what were the ones he messed up to end with that future (before graduation)?  My guess is that he screwed up on the very first one when he told her to stay beside her dying dog, thus giving her the desire to become a vet.  The whole series then showed the future getting more and more deviant.  Is this a viable interpretation? What went wrong? "
2624,Just what was the flower we saw that day?,"In Ano Hi Mita Hana no Namae wo Bokutachi wa Mada Shiranai, (Lit. ""We still don't know the name of the flower we saw that day""), there's a recurring theme of flowers revolving around Poppo, Menma, and the Opening/Ending of the series.    Just what is this flower? Is it what Poppo keeps putting in the jar of flowers where Menma's memorial is? And just what is the ""Blue Bookmark""? (Aoi Shiori) "
2625,Is Naruto related to Hashirama Senju?,"Hashirama Senju, the 1st Hokage, married Mito Uzumaki right? So does that make him Naruto's great, great, great grandfather? "
2626,Who was the first young character in anime to appear with white hair?,"By now the trope mystical white hair is used by everyone and their cat,  we have loads of characters who appear young yet have white / silver hair, either because they were born that way / used magic or other powers / had a traumatic experience etc.  Which was the first anime that had a young character with white hair? "
2627,What was Ging trying to accomplish at the election of the 13th Chairman?,"What was Ging trying to accomplish at the election of the 13th Chairman? It seemed that he had a plan and that everything went according to it, excepting the part where Pariston resigned from his position of Chairman. What was his full plan and what was he truly trying to accomplish (his final target)? Did he really wanted Pariston to be the 13th Chairman or his plan had a continuation? "
2628,How old is the snaggletooth trope?,"A lot of anime contain characters with a snaggletooth - typically a fang-like tooth that is displayed on its own. I found it odd as snaggleteeth (misaligned teeth) are rarely ever shown in any other media. Here are some examples :      [Lucky Star, Oreimo &amp; Slayers Revolution]  I'd like to know how recent this trope is and why it's used so often - does it serve a specific purpose?  Who was the first character to have a snaggletooth? "
2629,"How did Zeref ""Black Wizard"" get cursed?","How did Zeref get cursed? Some people think it was Mard Geer. I'm so sorry to trample on that thesis, but Zeref created Mard Geer and it is said that E.N.D, I mean Natsu, is the strongest demon who so happens to be Zeref's brother.  I was thinking that maybe Natsu cursed Zeref, but Natsu was out searching the world for his foster parent Igneel, right? Then I thought maybe Mavis cursed him? Not true either, because in the little flashback, Zeref already had the Death curse when he met Mavis and Mavis is way too sweet! Yeah some of you may be thinking ""Mavis is the Fairy Tatican and she has won many wars"" but I'm a Zervis shipper, sorry!  Then that had me thinking: does anybody remember that crucial detail (it happened fast but not fast enough) that Zeref 'lived' with all the monks, so maybe they cursed him? So then I did my research and some monks are, umm I don't wanna type evil, umm BAD. Most of the monks back then worshipped god. I watched a lot of religous anime! So that was soon to be proven wrong.  Yep, I can't answer my own question. I wonder if Hiro Mashima wanted us to think this? "
2630,Why did Caesar let Law in Punk Hazard?,"He had some gains from this, as Law used hs medical abilities and the power of the devil's fruit to restore the limbs in the inhabitants of the island.  But Law told him to not inform Doflamingo of the fact that he is staying there. (Later i would see that Doflamingo an Law had been enemies for years)  Didn't this alarm Caesar? What are the reasons that Caesar believed, Law would want to stay in Punk Hazard?  He didn't question Laws agenda or motivations at all? "
2631,What is the size of the crater left by the explosion in episode 26?,"In episode 26 of the anime, Silver/Ooguro/Tatsuya annihilated the Chinese fleet in one shot with Material Burst. No wonder his aunt had his ability locked...  What is the size of that crater? It was shown in satellite images to have eaten a piece of the coastline! Estimate from a screenshot if no source exists.  Since it was at the sea, of course the crater is filled with.... duh, seawater.  So by the images of episode 26, how big was the blast Ooguro caused? "
2632,Is there a connection between the Sephirot and Tales of the Abyss?,"While I was playing Shin Megami Tensei Persona 3, I was doing an extra lesson on the tarot and Mr Edogawa started talking about the Sephirot. He then went and mentioned one of its branches and I recognized three from Tales of the Abyss:   Malkuth => the Malkuth Empire which opposes the Kindom of Kimlasca Hod => the country that Guy and Mary came from that was destroyed in the previous war Chokhmah => as in Grand Chokhmah being the capital of the Malkuth Empire   There was also the fact that Sephirot can be transliterated to English as Sephiroth, which is the name of the tree that keeps the world up and out of the Qliphoth.  This got me wondering: is there a connection between the Sephirot and Tales of the Abyss? Or are all of these just coincidences? "
2633,Definition of a reverse trap,"I am confused at how people describe gender roles and their trope classification in anime. I understand that traps are characters appearing to be girls but are actually guys. One of my favorite traps of all time is Steins;Gate's Ruka Urushibara.   However, I don't get what ""reverse traps"" are. Are they appearing to be traps but are actually legit girls (a trap trap)? Or a character that initially appears to be a boy, but is actually a girl (a girl trap)? For clarity, consider what you would call Charlotte (Charles) Dunios from Infinite Stratos.     EDIT: This post is not intended to be offensive to other genders in any way, the naming convention of ""traps"" pertain to fictional characters in anime/manga only. "
2634,Who is the being with 2 eyes in Magi chapter 323?,"So I am confused about the identify of the 2-eyed thing.  I assume the person with 3 eyes is Ugo for that's how he looks when David fights him. For it to be Arba seems rather out of character to me, in later pages of the chapter.   Was 2 eyes some sort of amalgamation of Rukh/will of the world or something more individual?       "
2635,Why doesn't Lord Death die even though Death the Kid connects all three Lines of Sanzu?,"In the second to last episode of the Soul Eater anime, Death the Kid connects all three Lines of Sanzu. According to the lore, the Lines of Sanzu only connect when a person is ready to become the next Grim Reaper.  Since only one Grim Reaper can exist at a time, this usually means the current Reaper drops dead immediately.  There came a crack in Lord Death's mask when Kid did it, but he survived.  Why, then, doesn't Lord Death die? Is it because Kid only unconsciously connected the lines? "
2636,"How are Chaos;Head, Steins;Gate, and Robotics;Notes connected?","These series all seem to be connected, but asides from sharing the same production company and having the semi-colon separate their titles I can't see any relation between them. The plots seem to be completely disjoint.    When I was looking up Chaos;Head and Stein's;Gate, I also found Robotics;Notes, but it too seems to not be connected. Can anyone explain the connection between these series for me? "
2637,Who the heck is Baba Micchi?,"Both cours of Active Raid are now over, and I still don't know who Baba Micchi is!   As you will recall, Baba Micchi is apparently some person who Sena Souichirou knows, and whenever this person's name is mentioned, Sena has a rather visceral reaction.   The final mention of this person was in cour 2, episode 5 at around 17:37 - while Sena is riding around in the Senars Inc. garbage truck hoping to catch some of the petty criminals in action, a group of women mention Baba Micchi, prompting this reaction, followed by an ""I knew it!"".     But then the show cuts to a different scene, and Baba Micchi is never mentioned again.  Who on earth is Baba Micchi? "
2638,What is the meaning behind Mana Ryougi's name?,"During the Type-Moon Fes 10th Anniversary, there was this question:     Q: Who named Ryougi Mana? Was it Shiki, or Kokuto? Or was it someone else?      A: The one who named Mana was Mikiya. Mikiya himself came up with the name without a second thought, but Shiki knew its meaning. She said with a sour look on her face, ""Ah, so that's what it is."" and accepted anyways   What was the meaning behind her name? Why did Shiki make a sour face? "
2639,Does Sasori control Sharingan-wielding puppets?,"If you look at Naruto Shippuden Episode 26, in the episode, you can see that one of Sasori's puppets have the Sharingan in its eyes.    Is there any reason for this?  Can one of Sasori's puppets use the Sharingan? Wouldn't a lot of chakra be used up to manage a Sharingan, and could Sasori manage that too? "
2640,What is the thing Sakura is carrying?,"In the first opening sequence of Cardcaptor Sakura, towards the end she is shown carrying some sort of object which has written on it ""SAKURA"" in blue.    It seems to be tied to her hand or something. Apart from the letters, it seems to be orange, though it may have been intended to be transparent. I think I've seen the same thing in at least one of the episodes, though I don't remember which and I don't remember it being explained there. I really can't tell what it's supposed to be.  What is the object in Sakura's left hand in the above image? "
2641,What episode did Naruto combine Nine-Tails Chakra Mode and Sage Mode?,"In which episode did Naruto combine Nine-Tails Chakra Mode and Sage Mode?  If possible, how did he know, or who told him to do so? "
2642,Why does Wrath want Ed's limbs?,"In the 2003 series, Wrath is the homunculus created from Izumi Curtis' child, who either was stillborn or died shortly after birth. After Ed finds and interacts with him, he realises that Wrath has his leg and arm, and if I'm not mistaken, Wrath talks about wanting the rest of Ed's limbs. Wrath acquires the arm and leg when the brothers attempt human transmutation  Later, after Ed's disappearance into the alternate universe, we also see Wrath fitted with automail that was intended for Ed. According the wiki, this happens after Dante forces the removal of the limbs.  Why did Wrath ""need"" or ""want"" the limbs in the first place? If I'm not mistaken:   There wasn't any note of the child Wrath was created from having deformities, which suggests that Wrath had his ""original"" limbs that didn't come from Ed. This suggests that Wrath might have wanted Ed's limbs for some other purpose (e.g. wanting them in themselves, wanting to be able to perform alchemy), but I don't remember if this was explicitly stated anywhere.   Could someone shed any light on this, and perhaps provide an episode I could refer to and rewatch? "
2643,Is there some source as to what Taiga did during the skipped year in the last episode of Toradora?,"Taiga goes elsewhere for more than a whole year, entirely skipped in the anime narrative. What the hell was she doing, achieved or solved?  As a clue, the ep. 25 aftercredits preview has her in the voiceover saying she will now Show Ryuji her way of doing things.  Probably it is too pathetic to assume that her way is just running away for 300+ days just to blow steam.  Anywhere to shed light on the matter?  "
2644,Are there any other Guinness world record holders?,"Recently I stumbled upon a post mentioning that One Piece managed to get a place in the Guinness World Records for most printed comic series by one author ever.  Are there any other manga / anime that managed to place themselves in the Guinness World Records? Or is Eiichiro Oda, with One Piece, the only one so far? "
2645,Does Luffy touch his enemies in Gear Second?,"Though it was apparently obvious in some cases, Luffy's fight with Magellan made me a bit skeptical.   At the initial punch (Jet Pistol) Luffy touched the venomous body of Magellan, causing him extreme pain. In a later scene of the same fight, he used Jet Pistol to overcome his Hydra, but no sign of touching was shown.   In fact, in numerous cases, the way G2 works is ambiguous - some scenes imply that the pure speed even without touch creates an air pressure ""sphere"" that nevertheless causes huge injury when hits the target. Examples were seen in case of Blueno and much later, Doflamingo.  On the other hand, when he defeated Lucci, it was clearly shown that he actually punches him, and in several other cases it's often visible.  Which one is right? Or is itt possible that Luffy combines both? "
2646,Why do the MISAKA Sisters narrate everything they say?,"The MISAKA sisters from Toaru Majutsu no Index have this habit of constantly narrating everything they say in the third person, including the way they say it and actions during their speech. Moreover, the Last Order does it twice for every sentence.  Why do they do that? (And why doesn't anyone seem to notice?) "
2647,"What's true main story of ""Yu-Gi-Oh"" series before it was about TCG?","I have read the original of Yu-Gi-Oh series ( The First Generation ). It surprised me that the first chapter ( about 1 to 10 chapters of Yu-Gi-Oh ) it's not about a TCG (Trading Card Game) which people nowadays familiar with. Formerly, the main story is about Yugi and his penalty game, beating some bad guy, compare it with GX, 5D, Zexal, and Arc V which are already about TCG and Duel from the very first chapter.  Does Yu-Gi-Oh actually not a series about TCG from the first ? Why did they change the concept of story all of sudden ? if it's not,  Why the first chapter of the story is not about TCG ?  "
2648,Does anyone know the violin song that Toshiya Miike plays after Kousei's performance in episode 13?,Does anyone know the violin song that Toshiya Miike (Mikke-kun/-san) plays after Kousei's performance in episode 13? I wish I knew the exact time but I don't. I've searched everywhere trying to see if anyone figured it out or knew what it was but no luck. Help please? 
2649,Why doesn't Rin save Saber in episode 24 of Unlimited Blade Works?,"In the anime Unlimited Blade Works OVA, Rin rescues Saber before she disappears. Why doesn't she do the same in the main anime (episode 24)? In that anime episode, she doesn't do or say anything to help Saber (whereas with Archer she begs him and cries when he doesn't accept). What can possibly make Rin change her mind in the OVA? (I haven't read the visual novel and don't intend to, so feel free to talk about it if it gives relevant info related to Rin.)  Also, does Rin try to save Archer in the OVA? (We don't see what happens but since she already saves Saber and she would consume most of her prana, asking Archer would be very selfish (poor Saber) so she shouldn't ask Archer. In that case, why would she abandon Archer (her real servant) and choose Saber? (Again, if you know something relevant from the VN please tell me.)  Edit: Apparently Rin does ask Archer to stay in the OVA as well (VN source). Why would she do that when there's no mana for 2 servants? Is she just too greedy (to the point of being plain stupid and dying because of that) or does she intend to abandon Saber? "
2650,Does Dagashi Kashi author getting paid for advertise snack in her manga?,"The series Dagashi Kashi is like an advertise manga, it's promoted many snacks for children from japan. Does DagashiKashi's mangaka getting paid for promoted all of those snack?  I mean did all of those snacks which appear in DagashiKashi series (manga and anime) have been affiliated before between the mangaka and many snacks company ?  "
2651,Do the Quincy know of the consequences of their power?,"We know that when a Quincy kills a Hollow, they destroy its soul and cause an imbalance that could destroy Soul Society and the material world if done enough.  Are the Quincy aware of this fact? If so, why do they persist in killing Hollows? "
2652,What does the ending mean?,"At the end of First Squad,      The ghosts attack the Russian army to steal this artifact (can't remember what it was) but at the last moment, they change their attack. It looks like me the whole attack was a decoy, but for what? The movie ends soon after, without telling the whole story.   So what happened? "
2653,Is Nanatsu No Taizai inspired from Ubel Blatt?,If you've read both the manga you can see that both are very similar. This is not just limited to the characters but also how the story plays out.  Example: The seven deadly sins and Lances of Betrayal.  Has there been any statement regarding this from any of the authors or staff working on the respective manga?  Or is it the case that this type of plotline is too common anyways? 
2654,Who killed Lancer?,"Towards the beginning (after the OP) of the Carnival Phantasm Special Season OVA, the two waitresses of the Ahnenerbe Cafe, Hibiki and Chikagi, come into the cafe to find that someone has killed their co-worker, Lancer!  Based on the evidence at the scene of the crime, who amongst the extended cast killed Lancer? What was their motive (if any)?   "
2655,What are Archer's twin swords based off of?,"The Archer-class servant, summoned by Rin, in the 5th Fuyuki Grail Wars wields a pair of swords named Kanshou and Bakuya in close-combat.   Are these swords (especially their Overedge version, on the right in the picture below) based on real-life myths/legends or is in an original creation by the author/character designer? What type of weapons are they considered to be?   "
2656,"Is Ayase actually Kyousuke's sister, not Kirino?","I haven't watched to the end of OreImo, but someone told me that Ayase is actually Kyousuke's sister, not Kirino. Is this true? Can anyone lend credence to this theory?  "
2657,Why does Brad Pitt cameo in these manga?,"I noticed in some of the manga that I've been reading that Brad Pitt is appearing in them.    He appears in Yakitate Japan under the name Brad Kidd, showing up several times during the series (both anime &amp; manga) , mostly related to the Pierrot.    And in Arakawa Under The Bridge, it's said that he could be their neighbour on Venus  I know it's not unheard of for hollywood movie stars to show up in shows, but he appears noticeably enough in Yakitate Japan and the second occurrence made me think there might be more to it.  Is there anything behind the choice of western actor? I mean, they could have chosen Tom Cruise or someone else.  Does he cameo in any other shows? "
2658,Which media should I read to continue from where the Re:Zero anime left off?,"As most of Re:Zero's audience know the anime ended last week, and since there were a lot of people talking about the important part that was left out ""Which I still don't know about"", I decided I want to read the light novel to see what happened. Here is the problem, I found out that Re:Zero has a light novel, a web novel, and a manga, so what's the difference between them? Do I read all of them? And where should I start from? "
2659,Why is blood pink in Danganronpa?,"In episode two of Danganronpa, two characters die. On both cases the blood appears in pink, rather than red.        Why is this? Is blood in the Danganronpa universe pink? Or is this supposed to be less shocking for the viewer or something similar? "
2660,How did Saber become more linked to lions than dragons?,"We know Saber's real identity is Arthur Pendragon (""Chief-Dragon"") and that she is linked to dragons through Merlin's sorcery:     King Arthur was made into the incarnation of a dragon by Merlin by infusing her with the blood of a dragon, and one is shown in Realta Nua as a representation of her Magic Circuits and is visible standing near her Magic Core.   However, it seems that Saber is linked more to lions than dragons:     Though she once felt more linked to dragons, she came to enjoy lions after taking care of a lion cub for a month at some point in her life. She claims that it is not that she ""likes"" them, but rather the happiness she experienced as he became attached to her brought forth a bond with them. He was very energetic, often biting or scratching, but she wished to be able to stay with him until the end. She has had feelings for them since then, and even remembers the fond memories while holding a stuffed lion. Shirou seeing the memory of her rubbing her cheek against the lion comments on it being a time where she looks like a girl her age.   If I do an image search on Sankaku Channel with the tags saber lion, I get 129 results, which is much higher than the 31 results that I get if I search with the tags saber dragon. A glance through the images reveals that, in addition to the stuffed lion in the original Fate/stay night, there are also Saber Lion, the Unit Lion race car that appears in Carnival Phantasm, and a grown lion often found to also accompany Gilgamesh and Iskander.  It does not appear that Saber taking a liking to lions is central to the plot, so why the stronger association of Saber with lions than good old dragons? Was it ever revealed (e.g. in an interview) why Kinoko Nasu chose to portray Saber more as a Lioness than a Dragon Lady? "
2661,Who was the One-Eyed King after all?,"In the Tokyo Ghoul:re manga, I just got confused at a most critical point. Takatsuki wanted Kaneki to fulfil her wish to 'kill the One-Eyed', but in the end, as far as I can make out, Arima was the One-Eyed King (or was he?). And the next page pictured Kaneki as the One-Eyed King. Can someone explain with references from the manga? "
2662,What is the little doll on top of Tomoko's phone?,"In WataMote, Tomoko's phone appears to have a little figure on the top of it. It looks like a doll, with a kitty-face smile and an orange coat and antenna. In the ED sequence, it appears again, in both orange and blue.     Is this doll a reference to another series or Japanese pop culture? What does it mean? "
2663,Has there ever been official pornographic media for an anime and/or manga series?,"I've been wondering about this for a while now. With how perverted some anime and manga are without ever crossing into pornographic content territory, were there ever any anime or manga with official pornographic media? Example: a little spinoff series of sorts of a regular anime/manga, with one or two episodes focusing on characters bumping uglies mostly. Bonus points if those ""interactions"" are officially canon.  Obviously, I'm not talking about something like Dragon Ball or Pokémon. That's just weird. I'm talking about anime and manga that are already adult oriented, which already have some light sexual elements or sexual overtones, where it would make sense for official pornographic content to exist.  I wouldn't be surprised if some companies already tried to squeeze some extra bucks from the more fanatic and perverted parts of the fanbase, while those uninterested in the content never have to see it if they don't want to.  I'm specifically talking about series(es?) that started out relatively non-perverted and whose main source stayed relatively tame - no intercourse is ever shown directly, but it could be implied. VNs that had perverted elements and were turned into anime/manga later do not count, but feel free to give some examples if you want to. "
2664,How does Araragi know Ougi in Mayoi Jiangshi?,"In the beginning of Mayoi Jiangshi, we meet Ougi when she talks to Araragi in the traffic light conversation (i.e. ""Did you know that there is a time when all lights at an intersection are red?""). I didn't really think much of the fact that it was this random girl talking to him, thinking it was a friend from school.  Once I saw Ougi in the other ones in 2nd season / tsuki, I realized that that was also Ougi. Now that Owari is out, we see where he first meets Ougi. Because of that, I thought that this part of Owari was at the very beginning of 2nd season.  However, this site puts it after Mayoi Jiangshi. How is this possible? "
2665,Raye Penber conversation with Yagami Light following the bus incident,"After the bus incident, Raye Penber asks Yagami Light to keep seeing him a secret from the police, Yagami agrees and says ""I won't tell anyone, including my father"". Wouldn't Raye Penber ask himself why would Yagami Light think I know his father is in the police force? Doesn't it give a hint that Yagami knows he's being investigated? Do we just accept that Raye Penbar is a dull FBI agent? "
2666,Air Gear OVA 2 Battle Music,Does anyone know what is the name of this music which is being played at 5:16 in Air Gear OVA 2?   This music is being played when Sleeping forest members were preparing the balloon for battle between Kogarasumaru and Sleeping Forest (Inorganic Net). 
2667,"Why not simply ""Metal Alchemist""?",Why is Edward Elric known as the 'Fullmetal Alchemist' not simply as 'Metal Alchemist'? Is there any reason besides the names sounding better?  I've only watched the 2nd episode of FMA brotherhood. 
2668,Where did Scar's other tattoo come from?,"In the 2009 anime, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, near the end of the series,      Scar fights Wrath. During the battle, Scar surprises Wrath by using construction alchemy, revealing that he has a construction-based tattoo on his left arm.   Scar has not had this tattoo forever, though; in earlier scenes in the series, we can clearly see that Scar has only one tattoo on his body.    (Left: Scar, episode 22, no left tattoo. Right: Scar, episode 60, tattoo on his left.)  Is it ever stated when Scar receives this tattoo? Who gave it to him? "
2669,Do the symbols on Kazuki's shirt mean anything?,"In Buso Renkin, Kazuki, the protagonist, wears a red shirt with three odd symbols placed on the chest area:    They're not Latin characters and appear too simple to be Japanese or from other Oriental languages. What are these symbols? Do they mean anything in the story (or, if not, real life)? "
2670,Why are there two Utsu-tsus?,"In episode 2, there's a scene with Utsu-tsu cleaning the Tachikawa City International Greenery Garden where she volunteers. However, the scene is a bit strange, as it shows two of her in the same shot:    As far as I can tell, both of the people in the shot are Utsu-tsu. She's also in the two shots before this one, and doesn't seem to move between them, so there could be more than two of her.  Why are there two Utsu-tsus here? Is she able to double her body, or does she have clones, or are they imposters, or something else? "

2673,Who do the other names on the list of idols in episode 2 refer to?,"In episode 2, the producer has a list of idols/groups scheduled for events, and pens the Hacka Dolls into one of the slots to fill space.     I suspect that all of these are references to other idols or idol-like entities. Going down the list:   まつだひじりこ ""Matsuda Hijiriko"" → Matsuda Seiko (kanji pun on 聖) ""u's"" → μ's ""Sit Down Girls!"" → Wake Up, Girls! 美少女ハリウッド ""Bishoujo Hollywood"" → Shounen Hollywood でんじは組,etc ""Denji wa Kumi, etc"" → ??? ミス・カラフール ""Miss Colorful"" → Miss Monochrome スーパーソニ男 ""Super Soni-o"" → Super Sonico (Hacka Doll) 珂那ちゃん ""Kana-chan"" → the fleet's idol, Naka-chan ワン子クラブ ""Wanko Club"" → ??? 長森明菜 ""Nagamori Akina"" → ??? ゆりかおる ""YuriKaoru"" → YuiKaori Square → ???   I haven't managed to figure out the referents of the four ones I've bolded above. Who all are being referred to here? "
2674,What convinced Saber to destroy the Holy Grail in the Unlimited Blade Works movie?,"I've been watching Fate Stay Night and Unlimited Blade Works (movie). Haven't seen the manga yet.  In Fate Stay Night, Saber is determined to obtain the Holy Grail. After many experiences with Shirou, he convinces her that it is pointless, and so she accepts to destroy it. Shirou convinced her mainly because he wanted her to stay and have a normal life.  In the Unlimited Blade Works movie, there's no hint of major affection from Shirou towards Saber (who seems to be more interested in Rin). In fact, so many things happen so quickly that Saber even ends up as Rin's servant (so Shirou's relationship with her was like... null).  When the Grail is being summoned by Gilgamesh in Unlimited Blade Works, Saber doesn't even hesitate about destroying the Grail.  So in the Unlimited Blade Works movie, exactly what convinced Saber to destroy it?  I didn't really get UBW's plot very well though. I'm not sure if there was something especially wrong with that Grail that made it useless for Saber. Was there? "
2675,What's the difference between Fullmetal Alchemist and Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood?,"I've recently finished watching Fullmetal Alchemist and I then proceeded to watch an episode of Brotherhood before realizing, Brotherhood isn't actually a continuation of the first series. I then discovered there was a movie that tied up the loose ends at the end of the first series. Now, I want to know, what actually is Brotherhood? I've read that it's simply a version of the show that follows the manga more closely, but I haven't read the manga and I really enjoyed the first series. Will watching Brotherhood disappoint me or change my views of the ending? Could I have watched Brotherhood without having watched the first series (or at least before)? Are there any major (specific) changes that might frustrate someone who is dead-set on things happening like they did in the first series?  I know I have a lot of questions, but I hope someone can answer most of them! Thank you so much!  -Junebug "
2676,Why does Tomoko refer to My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic as an anime?,"This question regards the official English translation done by Yen Press. According to the copyright page, the translators are Krista Shipley and Karie Shipley.  Long Version  At the beginning of volume 7 (Fail 56), Tomoko is late to school because she got stuck watching My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic, a western animation. However, she refers to this show as an anime. Like an idiot, I got really hung up trying to figure out what the reasoning and implications were for using this terminology.   The quote from the manga is as follows:     When I randomly turned on the TV this morning, there was this anime showing... And I just ended up watching to the end, so...   So, why did the English translator choose to use the term anime here, which in English is only used to refer to Japanese animation, rather than something more accurate? I've thought of several possibilities, but have no way to determine which, if any, is right.  If I'm not mistaken, in Japan the word anime is used to refer to any sort of animation, with no distinction for its country of origin. So the translator may have chosen the term to convey that in Tomoko's mind there isn't a real distinction for foreign cartoons. But the translator did make this decision to use this term in the English adaptation, where anime has a different meaning, so alternatively it is also possible they're trying to convey that Tomoko isn't aware the show is not made in Japan.  Another reason could be for style. Tomoko talks about anime and manga a lot, so it might be a little unusual for her to use a more accurate term here, such as ""cartoon"" or ""animation"".  The translator's note at the end doesn't offer much insight onto the matter, though does seem to imply that the translator knows the show is a western animation:     The show Tomoko is watching is Hasbro's My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic, in which Rainbow Dash is a main character. Rainbow Dash's Japanese voice actress is Izumi Kitta, who also voices Tomoko in the WataMote anime series.   Short Version  Is there any way to determine whether the translator's choice to use the term ""anime"" to refer to My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic is a mistake or a deliberate choice to be accurate to Tomoko's character and/or Japanese culture?

2677,What is the significance of Koizumi noticing Kyon's mole?,What is the significance of Koizumi noticing Kyon's mole at the end of Lone Island Syndrome?   I don't think there was this ever an explanation made in the anime... was there any context given in the light novel?  [website]
2678,List of mangas by readership and reception,Are there any known lists of monthly/annual readership (e.g. top charts) of different mangas in Japan or the US? Perhaps by category and age groups (audience)?   What are some good English sources for looking up statistics of manga readership and reviews? 
2679,How much does a typical anime episode or series cost to make?,"While it's pretty easy to find what is the budget for most anime feature films like those from Studio Ghibli, the average cost for making an anime series, much less an episode, is not readily available.  How much does an anime episode or series cost to make these days? Where does the money come from?  What is the breakdown of all the cost (to what part [e.g., script, sounds, edition, etc.] go how much of the budget)? "
2680,Is there a superstition about good anime series having character(s) that run in the ED?,"At the end of the Carnival Phantasm: HibiChika Special, Kohaku (Koha-Ace ver.) mentions that there is a superstition where good anime all have people running in the ending animation.  Does this superstition actually exist? If so, how true is this superstition? Where did it first start?   "
2681,Why do red Saber and blue Saber look so alike?,"On the surface, red Saber (from Fate/Extra) and blue Saber (from Fate/Stay Night) look almost identical.   Was it ever explained why they look so similar?   What noticeable differences do the two have, aside from their abilities and attire?     "
2682,What is the source of superpowers in the One-Punch Man universe?,"Is it ever explained why some humans develop superpowers in the One-Punch Man universe?  I'm not just talking about Saitama, I'm talking about the other heroes and martial artists.  No one seems to think it's unusual that there are people who can lift up huge boulders (Tank Top Master), move faster than the eye can see (Flashy Flash), or smash through thick concrete prison walls (Pri Pri Prisoner).  Such people are just ""strong"" or have ""trained"". And then you have the esper sisters and the occasional oddball like Green.    It is implied that the Hero Association physical test looks for enhanced physical characteristics, although it's not explicitly stated as such. The series doesn't seem to want to confirm or deny that C-, B-, and A-Class heroes are actually super-powered, although there is evidence that they all must be, at least in terms of how super-powers are defined in Western comic books, i.e., physical abilities greater than a human could naturally have.    Is it a manga trope that people can naturally develop powers, or is there a hint as to why some people in this universe develop powers?   "
2683,Why do some of the scenes in the 5th Episode of Attack on Titan differ when it was aired in Fukuoka?,The airing of the 5th episode of Attack on Titan in Fukuoka (see top in the Youtube video below) had some noticeable differences from the original airing (see bottom).  Why were these changes made? Was it due to censorship or production issues?  [website]
2684,Who ended up placing fourth in block A of the autumn preliminaries?,"After Souma's turn in block A of the autumn preliminaries, the standings were thus:    As you can see, there's a tie for fourth between Marui and Ibusaki. It was mentioned in episode 23 that if there were to be a tie that affects who passes the preliminaries, the judges would vote to determine who passes and who doesn't.  So I figure they must have voted on whether Marui or Ibusaki would be the fourth contestant from block A - but which one of them won the vote? During the after-party, Yoshino mentions that Ibusaki was probably sulking in his room, so I guess maybe Marui won? But nobody seemed to explicitly acknowledge that Marui had made it through, so I'm a bit confused. "
2685,What is the seventh clan?,"In the first season of K, we're introduced to the red, blue, and colorless clans early on, and later on are told about the silver and gold clans. In the movie, we come to know of the green clan.  But there are seven clans, and that only amounts to six. What is the color (or non-color?) of the seventh clan?  "
2686,Is L-Elf clairvoyant?,"In the show Valvrave the Liberator, there's a secret agent of the Dorssian military named ""L-elf Karlstein"", who seemed to belong to a group of other ""gifted"" members of the Dorssian military. L-Elf seems to be able to see certain sequences of events in the future and be able to predict them (for example, to Haruto) in an almost Nostradamian way, yet during combat, he can clearly strategize a winning plan and even calculate the number of total loses correctly.  Is L-Elf clairvoyant with some sort of super-human powers? Or is he just really, really, smart? "
2687,Is Natsu's Etherious form still alive?,"As we read in the Fairy Tail manga,     Because of choosing to stay human, the two seeds inside Natsu's body(Dragon seed &amp; Demon seed) was vanished   Does that mean,  END(Etheriois Natsu Dragneel) is dead?  I have another reason of suspicion because of Zeref Dragneel.As we know,      Zeref is the one who revived Natsu as his strongest demon of book of zeref, END   So now that Zeref is dead, isn't it normal for END to be dead too? "
2688,What is this Geis from?,"On the Type-Moon Wikia entry for Geis it says this:     Contract used by Kiritsugu Emiya    Binding magecraft: Target – Kiritsugu Emiya    The Crests of the Emiya family hereby command: Provided that the following conditions are met, this oath shall become a commandment and bind the target without exception.        Oath:    To the fifth head of the Emiya house, Kiritsugu, son of Noritaka: regarding both Kayneth Archibald El-Melloi and Sola-Ui Nuada-Re Sophia-Ri, all intentions and actions to kill and harm shall be forbidden for all eternity.        Conditions:    Use up all the Command Seals, and let the Servant finish himself.   Now I've only seen up to Episode 10 but from how this reads it seems to have been in place before even the first fight between Saber and Lancer since by episode 10      Sola-Ui Nuada-Re Sophia-Ri is Lancer's Master and probably doesn't care about Kayneth since she loves Lancer   However, Kiritsugu had tried to kill Kayneth on more than one occasion and there seems to be nothing that tries to stop him from breaking this Geis. in Fate/Stay Night in one of Heaven's Feel's bad endings, it's shown what happens when Shirou goes against the Geis he forms with Rin      Once he plans on going against Rin's wishes of killing Sakura Matou, he finds that he cannot move his body at all to stop her. He is immediately freed upon Sakura's death, as there is no longer any reason to bind him.   and in Cú Chulainn's legend, his demise was caused when he was put in a situation where he had to break a Geis   Never refuse a meal offered by a woman Never eat dog meat   He was offered a meal of dog meat by a woman and as such he had to break one Geis.  So while I may be jumping the gun here and asking this before watching the entire series, where does this Geis with Kiritsugu and Kayneth appear? If it was before the first fight between Saber and Lancer, how come there was nothing enforcing the Geis as there was with Shirou? "
2689,What is Hayama Akira's ethnicity supposed to be?,"Judging from the flashback in episode 23, where Shiomi Jun meets a young Hayama in a spice market somewhere, I get the sense that Hayama was probably not born in Japan.

What's his ethnicity supposed to be? "
2690,"What is the meaning of ""deculture?""","Throughout the various Macross series the word ""deculture"" is used, like in the sign off, ""see you next deculture"" and in the Nyan Nyan song:      ""Nyan Nyan, Nyan Nyan, Ni hao Nyan, gorgeous, delicious, deculture!""   How is it used? What is its history? Where did it come from? (both in and out of universe)   "
2691,Is it normal to 'erase' a seiyu?,"Today I stumbled upon the Kotaku post regarding Ai Takabe's arrest in regards to drugs.  Besides her being erased from the credits, Bandai also announced that it’s no longer streaming Kill Me Baby as well as the 2009 anime Sweet Blue Flowers and the 2011 anime Wandering Son. Which are both animes Takabe had a voice in.  Has something like this happened before? Or is it considered normal to erase peoples existences from created products in Japan like has happened here, when a member of it's team commits a crime? "
2692,Does Sidonia no Kishi's 256 frame formation have scientific advantages?,"In episode five or six of Sidonia no Kishi, Tanikaze and Shizuka were rescued by their fellow knights against orders of the captain. The rescuers adopted a 256 Gardes formation traveling to and from the protagonist's location. Is the scientific reason behind this peculiar formation explained anywhere in the series (because I can't recall)?     Their formation was a perfect circle when they traveled to Tanikaze's location but was uneven as they carried his frame, hence balance might be out of the answer. This formation was also used later in the series when they were going to attack the massive Gauna (as the picture shows). They used all 256 for the formation but still, the mission-grouping were in 128 frames per objective.  I don't think this question is a duplicate of this question because I'm asking for the scientific explanation of the formation. I'm also aware this question may be put on hold or closed as too speculative, but it's an interesting thing to ask if the explanation is in the series anyway.  I believe krazer's explanation to the question above (as ton.yeung comments below) is on spot after a little research. However, what I really want to know is the benefits in having everyone in one giant ring when they could create two 128-frame rings that would've been apt on the later event I mentioned. They could even have 64 4-frame rings that might cover a greater area in the long run (or not). Does it save energy, minimize danger, or perhaps guarantee a lesser chance of being lost in space? "
2693,Do the Wammy's House members speak to each other in English?,"Related to this question: Questions about nationalities and languages in Death Note  It seems the Death Note 2015 series tries to incorporate the English language when appropriate, but even though Watari, L and Near are supposedly Western, they speak Japanese to each other. I guess it would be weird if they were played by Western actors even though their characters are supposedly Western. Artistic license and all that.  Might be a dumb question, but in the anime and manga, is it safe to assume that the Wammy's House members speak to each other in English?  I guess it's obvious that when Mello and Near here about L's death, they speak in English to each other and w/ the person who informed them about L's death.  What about for instance when Mello and Near were talking in the SPK place or whenever L and Watari talk privately? It's in English right? "
2694,What is Kazari Uiharu's esper ability?,"Uihara mentioned that her esper ability is really weak, and additionally in the Railgun anime, when asked about her headband made of flowers, she asks ""What headband?"".  Is her ability to grow those flowers? Or is it the ability to use computers really well or something else? "
2695,"Are there any prominent non-fan dubs of ""A Cruel Angel's Thesis"" in other languages?","Remembering that there was a dubbed version of one of the OP's from the 2003 FMA in Cantonese, that seems to have been popular in Hong Kong (judging from YouTube), I wanted to know if there was anything similar for NGE's ""A Cruel Angel's Thesis"".  I found this song on YouTube - there was at least one other upload of a song with the same voice, and I also found a set of lyrics that approximately correspond to what is sung there. However, I haven't really been able to locate the singer's identity from a quick Google search. Moreover, there doesn't seem to be mention of a singer or a dub of the song on the Chinese Wikipedia, although perhaps my Chinese skills aren't just good enough for me to pick this up. I also managed to find a different recording with a female voice that was in Cantonese, but had different lyrics, which makes me somewhat suspicious as to the existence of an ""official"" dub. (It's of course possible though that a song will have multiple covers in the same language by prominent artists, as happened with a popular Angela Aki song.)  I also looked up the Cantonese dub of the first episode of NGE, and the one I found kept the OP in the original Japanese.  Is there an actual, reasonably prominent dub of ""A Cruel Angel's Thesis"" in languages other than Japanese? I'm particularly interested in whether or not there are any Chinese dubs. I'm looking for something comparable to Eason Chan's dub of the FMA OP, in the sense that it should be reasonably ""prominent"" and done professionally and not, say, a amateur fan-made production. "
2696,"Are there any other Leg Style combatants other than Okamas, Sanji and Zeff?","Sanji's fighting style is using his leg and his epithet is also called Kuroashi no Sanji / Black Leg Sanji. He learnt this style of fighting from Aka-Ashi no Zeff / Red-Leg Zeff.  As far as I remember, Okamas also use (at least) their legs to fight, like Bentham and Emporio Ivankov.  My questions are :   besides Sanji and Zeff, is it only Okamas that using Leg Style for fighting? are there any other Leg Style combatants other than Okamas, Sanji and Zeff?  "

And then he goes into a monster school, and where the magic to stop humans doesn't work, and becomes a normal student. Am I the only one who finds this weird?

2698,Who do I contact regarding rights licenses of specific manga/anime characters?,"My company runs a card game in Europe, but we want to start including manga and anime characters. How would we start going about obtaining licences?  We want Akira, Fist of the North Star, Ako, Tank Police, Appleseed, etc.  It's just one image character per card. Does anyone have any details on doing this legally and respectfully, with links, etc? "
2699,Why was the framerate so low in the first episode of Sidonia?,"I only watched the first episode of Knights of Sidonia, and the main reason I dropped it was that the CG ran at an unbearably low framerate. I just took another look at it, and it looks like most of it past the opening sequence was ""on threes"".  I can understand why it's rare for anime to do hand-drawn animation (besides pans/etc) on ones - it takes a lot of work!  But I can't comprehend why this would happen with Sidonia - it was 100% CG! It seems like cranking the framerate up to twos or ones would just be a matter of changing a setting in whatever tool they were using to render the CG. Last year's ""Aoki Hagane no Arpeggio"" was full-CG too, and it didn't have this problem...  Do we know why the CG framerate was so low? Was it production issues, or an artistic choice, or...? (Side question: did it get better in later episodes and/or on the BD?) "

I have completed the Naruto original series, and am on episode 436 of the subbed Naruto Shippuden series. My question is, when should I watch The Last: Naruto the Movie and Boruto: Naruto the Movie? Should I wait until I am completely done with the Shippuden series, or do I watch them now?   I have seen other answers, but none have been definitive for me. I have not read any of the Manga, nor do I plan to at this point. However, I do not want these movies to spoil any of the plot lines from the Shippuden series for me. How many episodes are left in the Shippuden series? Can someone please give me some guidance and/or information on these topics? Thank you so much! "

2702,What would have happened if Brook Died from eating a Second Devil Fruit?,"I saw a post about ""Creating your own Devil Fruit Powers"".. Most OP would be having two abilities. Then I remember that eating Two Devil Fruits = your body to explode.   So.. I was thinking, What would have been the Result if Brook (Alive) would have died by eating a second Devil Fruit? Would his Yomi Yomi no Mi powers activate and revive him and if so, he is a person that was able to eat two devil fruit and live which means, two abilities?  "
2703,Do drifters age?,Count Saint Germi is regarded as one of the founding fathers of Orte and was also the first member of the aristocracy to side with Adolf Hitler in creating the Empire and that was 60 years ago. How was he able to live fo so long and not age a bit? Is this a characteristic of all Drifters? or just an ability exclusive to Germi. 
2704,Light's actions before hiding his death note,"I recently started watching Death Note and have reached episode 17's end.  Light hid his notebook in the jungle, could he not have killed L? I know that L said that would  make Light the prime suspect but what if he writes the cause of death to be a slowly degentrative disease like Huntington's (which would make it VERY ironic given how proud L is of his track record)? He can make it kill L early by specifying his date of death like he did with Ray Penber's fiancé. And L would become less and less useful as he loses control over his body.  This method would be especially convincing since no one has yet (as far as I have seen in the series) discovered that he can determine the cause of people's death. "
2705,Did Kino no Tabi (2017 Remake) ever release a soundtrack?,"I have been searching for a full soundtrack somewhere to at least purchase but I'm getting no results. Maybe that speaks for itself and tells me that it was not released, but I figured I should ask here before giving up. Anyone know something about it? Or should I give up? "
2706,Was the Scouting Legion's patch or the character's Military affiliation changed?,"In the Military, there are three units, each with its own patch: Scouting Legion, Military Police and Stationary Guard.  Left to Right: Scouting Legion, Military Police and Stationary Guard    So far in the anime (up to episode 12), from these three we've seen (if I didn't miss any) only the Stationary Guard's patch.   Most of the main characters (Eren Jaeger, Mikasa Ackerman, Armin Arlert, Jean Kirschtein and others) are in the Scouting Legion. However, they seem to have a different patch that exhibits two crossed swords. They've been wearing this patch since (in episode 2) formation, and the people in charge of training then were also wearing this patch.     Even characters, such as Annie Leonhardt, that belong to the Military Police exhibit the Crossed Swords patch.   What differs in the anime from the manga? Were both the patches and the character's military affiliations changed? "
2707,Why is the average number of suspects three or more in Detective Conan?,"I'm curious as to why in almost every Detective Conan case there are always around three suspects?

2710,Why does Eren Yaegar not have memories of previous attack titans,"It is acceptable that he does not have memories of the founding titan but technically each titan shifter inherits the memories of the previous generations that inherited the same titan. Why does Eren not have Grisha's and Eren Kruger's memories? One answer on reddit seemed to be explaining this with the help of the dominating effects of the coordinate. As Armin is soon to get his titan powers in the anime, will he atleast get the memories and finally solve the mysteries for the people inside the wall?  As you may have noticed I have already catched on to a few things ahead but still would appreciate if there are no major spoilers in the answers to the anime.

2713,Filler episodes for anime that has no manga original - some questions?,"I know that filler episodes are often done to keep a work going, or to flesh out a character's backstory.  In an anime that is its own work (not based on any manga, and with no manga counterpart), can filler be used as a means of taking a break from the story arc?  I know this is a different example, and a western work, but American TV drama series Grey's Anatomy was accused of having filler for much of Seasons 12, 13 and 14.  Filler isn't necessarily non-canon, is it?  Is it possible for a filler episode to later prove to be important even though it doesn't seem so at the time, if a character makes reference to the events of it further down the line, and how often as this happened?  I'm not an expert in anime, but is it more common for manga-to-anime adaptation than a series being entirely anime and created from scratch?  I'd appreciate any explanations, as I've seen varying discussions on filler. "
2714,"What does ""Blitzendegen"" mean?","The term ""Blitzendegen"" is used by the Dorssian military frequently (see here for an example). It seems to be used as a salute, but it's also used in other context. The term seems to be from German, but its literal meaning in German is ""lightning rapier"" which doesn't make much sense.  What is the in-universe meaning of ""blitzendegen"", and when are Dorssian soldiers expected to use it? "

While playing Shogi with Shikamaru, He asked if Shikamaru could figure out what piece represents the Hokage. Which of the chess pieces do?  Do all the other chess pieces have similar representations? Because Asuma mentioned that Shikamaru seemed more like a Knight and himself like a Pawn. Whats the reasoning behind this match up? "

2719,Why do ninjas run with their hands at the back?,Ninjas in Naruto run with their hands at the back (which is very different from normal anime character running). Why is that? Is it because of their too much running speed or the wind force that their arms tend to be at their backs? Don't they lose balance when they run like that? Is there any explanation for this?

2721,Why didn't Krillin and Gohan store the Dragon balls in a capsule?,"I'm watching Dragon Ball Z Kai and never really thought about it - If Bulma was able to pack up her cave back into capsules, why couldn't she put the Dragon ball(s) in the house, then pack up the house?   The resulting capsule would be small enough to cause confusion for anyone who had the dragon radar, as it would be in the vicinity (if it still showed up), but could be hidden in someone's pocket or even swallowed / regurgitated as necessary. It could have even served as a ""this radar is on the fritz, we don't have any of the balls to hand over, they're still out there somewhere"" excuse if cornered.  Was this simply a case of the characters not thinking to try it or is there something that would prevent the dragon balls from being shrunk down / stored in a capsule? And on that note, could you store a person / animal in a capsule? "

Considering that the sign that a child has gained their powers is the presence of a Blessing Spirit, this would be an indication that their powers are already leaking at this point.   So does this mean the Blessing Spirit is just another mutant? If so, what creature was originally a basis, and did they all end up looking the same? "
2724,Is there a name for the abbreviated (usually three syllable) title?,Surely the act of abbreviating an anime title to three syllables has a name...? And what is that name? (some of these will show my age)  ╔═════════════════════════════════════════════╦═══════════╗ ║                  Full Name                  ║ Shortened ║ ╠═════════════════════════════════════════════╬═══════════╣ ║ Kodomo no Omocha                            ║ Kodocha   ║ ║ Jungle wa Itsumo Hare nochi Guu             ║ Hareguu   ║ ║ Ore no Imouto ga Konnani Kawaii Wake ga Nai ║ Oreimo    ║ ║ Fruits Basket                               ║ Furuba    ║ ║ Japanese Animation                          ║ Anime     ║ ╚═════════════════════════════════════════════╩═══════════╝  
2725,How long can each titan keep his form?,"It's said that the Cart Titan is the one who lasts the most, having lasted 2 months in Titan form      It's been two months since the last time I turned back into a human. I   forget how to walk on two legs every time this happens.   and that the Colossus Titan last the least, about 15 minutes if I recall correctly.   What about the others? How long can each titan keeps his form? "
2726,Does Naruto consciously control his clones?,I've seen when Kakashi was training Naruto with his elemental affinity that Naruto cannot see what his clone is doing until it is undone. How does he control the clone? Does it move and think like a separate entity? Can it think to try to kill the original? 
2727,Is there any special episode of Conan and Kindaichi working together?,"According to Detective Conan World's Wiki, there are a few people who know Conan's real identity. I checked out the list and found Hajime Kindaichi.  I am a fan of Kindaichi series so I would like to know how did Kindaichi get to know Conan's real identity? Obviously Conan wouldn't have told Kindaichi himself. Kindaichi must have figured it out.  So is there any special episode or a manga chapter where Conan and Kindaichi work together?   I know about the game. "
2728,Is it possible to cultivate Sharingans?,"I got into a discussion with this with my brother the other day and I was wondering if this would be a valid way to cultivate and stock up on Sharingans.   We see that Madara/Tobi had an entire laboratory of Sharingans, presumably gathered from the corpses from the Uchiha Massacre. Now, if someone like Kabuto were to reanimate Uchiha, they would be revived back with their own eyes as we saw with Itachi.   Then, would it be possible to remove the reanimated Itachi's eyes and store them for use for a later date? My brother told me that the problem with this theory is that a reanimated body using Kabuto's Endo Tensei would just have body parts that would turn to paper/dust if detached from its body, as we saw from many reanimations who lost their limbs in the war.  But what if Kabuto un-did the Endo Tensei jutsu immediately proceeding taking out the eyes of Itachi. Would the eyes still turn to paper/dust or would they manifest in a physical form? If so, this would allow someone like Kabuto to infinitely cultivate Sharingans by continuously reanimating and un-reanimating an Uchiha, something that could be very powerful when comboed with Izanagi.  If the above is not possible with Kabuto's jutsu, how about with Orochimaru's Endo Tensei - the one he used to revive the First and Second Hogake against the Third Hokage in the first Naruto series? If I recall, Orochimaru's original Endo Tensei didn't make the bodies immortal or turn to paper. "
2729,Who do you have to contact to obtain a license to stream manga?,"I am curious to know who the copyright holder to a manga is: is it the mangaka, or the publisher (such as Kodansha, Shonen Jump, etc)?  Who do you have to contact to obtain a license for streaming it? "
2730,Why was Yoshimi killed?,"In the second part of the series after the first time skip, Saki learns that she did have a sister called Yoshimi. According to the comments made by her mother, Yoshimi was killed by an Impure Cat.  Yoshimi showed signs of having gained her powers early but didn't seem controlled because of how her name looked in the mirror Saki found. Considering that she didn't look all that much older to Saki,    Was Yoshimi really that much of a threat to have developed her powers so early that she had to die? Isn't the purpose of the Unified Class to help children and teenagers control their powers?  Why couldn't Yoshimi just be a child prodigy who could one day take Shisei Kaburagi place?   "
2731,Who are these characters in the bookstore?,"In Episode 16, when Kagami, Tsukasa, and Miyuki decide to visit Konata at her part-time job, the latter asks them to pick up the latest release of a couple of manga. At the bookstore, they are served by a character who doesn't appear to be the ""standard"" extra seen in the series. Even after the three girls leave the cash register, the shot lingers on this character who is joined by her sister. All this seems to suggest that this is something of a cameo performance or a hat-tip to something else.    Who are these characters? "
2732,Why we rarely see magic circle during battle in Fairy Tail : Final Series?,"I remember couple years ago, the thing that made me fall in love in Fairy Tail is they way they always summon magic circle in almost every battle which is very cool. See this epic magic by mystogan     But in Fairy Tail : Final Series I don't remember those kind of things exist. Are they so rushed to finish this series by skipping this battle element? Or is there any specific reason for that? I also realize the battles in this final series are so lame and quickly ended compared to the first series. "
2733,"Was Chiisana Obake Acchi, Kocchi, Socchi ever released in English?","When I was five or six years old, sometime around 1994, I pestered my mother to buy me a VHS tape about three little ghosts from the stand next to the checkout at the grocery store. I watched that video over and over again, then forgot about it until recently, when I remembered it, recalled how much the art style looked like early Pokemon, and suddenly realized that that was probably the first anime I ever saw.  In preparation to write an id request, I did some searching, and I now think the show I saw was probably Chiisana Obake Acchi, Kocchi, Socchi. The timeframe is right, the plot sounds similar, and the picture seems familiar. The character names listed for the Spanish and Polish dubs on Anime News Network sound familiar and both Anime News Network and My Anime List give the show the English title Three Little Ghosts. Anime News Network even lists English language script staff. But there's nothing under ""English cast"" or ""English companies"", and I can't find any hard evidence that it was actually released in the United States.  Was Chiisana Obake Acchi, Kocchi, Socchi ever released in the US, and if so, when and by whom? "
2734,"Origins and information about the song ""Kokoronashi""","I recently discovered a cover for the song ""Kokoronashi"" on SoundCloud, so I tried to find the original version of the song, or at least information about who the original artist is, on Youtube.  However, this song seems to have been covered by so many different people so many times that I cannot find out who sang the original as some singers who covered it cite conflicting original versions/artists of this song.  (The search queries that I performed on Youtube were ""kokoronashi"", ""kokoronashi original)    I noticed that the picture above was almost always associated with this song on Youtube and it had an anime artstyle, so I imagine that it might be some anime song, but upon performing a reverse image search, all the results simply brought me to the Youtube covers that contain the picture instead of pointing me to an anime where I can find the original song.  Does anybody know who sang the original version of this song and/or what anime it comes from, if any?  I realize that this is a very vague description of a song since I only provide the name, but I guarantee that if you search ""kokoronashi"" on Youtube, you will find many covers of the song that I am referring to without trouble on the very first search results page.  If it helps, here is a link to a fairly popular English cover of the song. I did not link to a Japanese cover because they tend to be more likely to be taken down by Youtube due to copyright violations than English covers, but the English melodies are very much the same as the Japanese covers that I have seen. "
2735,Isn't Flora's ability inefficient?,"I've been watching Claymore. I haven't read the manga yet.  Number 8, Flora:     She's the fastest there is at unsheathing, slashing, and sheathing back her claymore.     As you can see, she unsheathes, slashes, and sheathes back so fast that the image of her hand seems to be static, whereas a bunch of slashes appear around the target.  But wait.  What is the point of sheathing her claymore back while attacking someone? Isn't that a waste of time? Wouldn't it be more useful to unsheathe and then slash countless times rather than sheathing back her claymore during a fight?  Proof that she's indeed sheathing after X amount of slashes:  This scene below lasts for several seconds. This means that she must continuously sheathe her claymore, otherwise this image effect wouldn't be possible:  "
2736,What is the name of the song that plays when Itachi puts Sasuke's eye in a storage container? (videos linked),"The same song also plays when Push-Pain deflects attacks of various magical Konoha ninjas when he attacks the village. (At the same timespan he fought Kakashi). UPDATE: Thanks, @W. Are, I will l link to youtube videos if that is alright. Here is a video with timemark: [website]"
2737,Why is the anime of Akame ga Kill so different from the manga?,"I haven't read the manga of Akame ga Kill, but I have read that it is really different from the anime.  They even skipped 10 chapter of the manga completely.  Why did they decide to do that?  Was it because the show has to be done in a short amount of episodes or something else? "
2738,How does this calendar thing even work?,"I was enjoying my lunch over the 8th episode of YuriYuri and right at the beginning there was this unusual calendar:    Truth be told, this is the first time I see a calendar like that. As you can see, it consists of 3 parts which seem to be made of wood. The lower part says ""April"", so I assume it is removable so that the cubes above it can rotate, and that there are 11 more like it somewhere else in store.  Now the tricky part is the numbers. The 2 blocks on top are set up to read ""01"" which is for April the 1st. But the top side of the block that reads 0 in front, has a 6 on it. What's going on? And there are only 4 sides that can be rotated with their front sides for each digit to form a number of a day of the month. Is this an animation mistake? If not, how can this calendar thingie work?  Also, is it even possible to make them read all numbers from 01 to 31? "
2739,What are the real world locations for the Districts mentioned in From the New World?,"Given that in the series, Tokyo is visited, I assumed that the districts mentioned have real world locations.  According to the Wikia Page,     Although Kamisu 66 is the only district that appears in the actual story, there are other district names known, such as Shiroishi 71 in a location called Tohoku, Tainai 84 in Hokuriku, and Koumi 95 in Chuubu.   so I tried plotting them on a Google Map (static image), but when I tried and search for Tohoku, Hokuriku and Chuubu I didn't get a single place/prefecture to be confident that it is the district, and Shiroishi 71 to me seems a bit too close to Tokyo.  So I am wondering: what are the real world locations of the districts?  NOTE: I won't be allowing people to edit the map I have linked to as I have and plan to add other points which only are useful to myself. You can use Google My Maps to plot out the locations for your answer if it helps. "
2740,Why does a Devil Fruit's power nullify only if the user is knocked unconscious and not when he sleeps?,"I have noticed something rather strange: Why do devil fruit users abilities nullify when they are knocked unconscious but not when they fall sleep?  Take Moria for example. Moria had control of all the shadows when Luffy knocked him out, allowing the shadows to escape, so why does sleeping not do the same? Certainly he had to have fallen asleep at some point in time before Luffy had knocked him out.  Same is the case with Sugar. She was scared unconscious by Usopp and all the toys turned back to their human forms. Is there something about being knocked unconscious and falling asleep that is different in the One Piece Universe?    "
2741,What was the butcher's bill in the aftermath of the 1998 3-3 class' calamity?,"How many students, relatives died? How many survived?  Use this template. List names if you feel so (would like, but a body count is fine)  Teacher 2. Relatives __ Students __ Survivors __ "
2742,Can someone explain Leorio's wager with the prisoner?,"In Season 1 Episode 10, Trick x to x the Trick, Leorio wanted to bet on whether the blue guy was unconscious or not. At the time of the wager the prisoner was down 40-60 against Leorio.        PRISONER: Now, it's your turn to wager. What would you like to bet on?   LEORIO: Well... I'd like to bet on whether he's really unconscious or not.     Just before Leorio lets go of the blue guy, the prisoner says:      PRISONER: I bet 40 hours that he's unconscious. I'm betting all the time I have left.    Leorio lets go of the blue guy and of course he wasn't unconscious yet the prisoner was still awarded with 40 hours!!   Prisoner's time on the left, Leorio's time on the right.  After the prisoner was awarded the 40 hours, she says,      PRISONER: But now, you only have 20 hours of bargaining chips.    So they definitely made it seem like Leorio lost the wager, but clearly the prisoner did!  Why didn't the prisoner lose right then and there? Shouldn't that have been the end of the match? "
2743,Who is captain Jack?,The name of Captain Jack first appeared in Chapter 801 when Doflamingo was escorted by the Navy to Impel down following his defeat by the StrawHats in Dressrosa.   Captain Jack seems ready to take on the might of a Marine Admiral Fujitora and former fleet admiral Sengoku in order to rescue Doflamingo. Captain Jack again appears in the most recent chapter 805.  Is anything known of Captain Jack? Is he one of the unknown shichibukai?  
2744,What is the meaning of the cake song?,"In the Rebellion movie, the girls are performing a sort of a ritual that materializes a giant cake filled with whatever they are singing about. Then it's eaten by Bebe in Candy Witch form. It's all fun and nice, but what is the purpose of this ritual? Is it some sort of made-up substitute for transforming witch energy like Kyuubey did by eating the grief seeds, but with Bebe Witch instead? Perhaps there's some info on that in manga/novels?   "
2745,Can you conditionally kill someone with the death note?,"Lets say you write ""some dude dies of a heart attack at 3:00 PM if it is cloudy out"". Does the dude die? What if you said ""some dude commits suicide by gun at 3:00 PM if it is cloudy out"", so that it is just up to him whether or not to decide to die.  Any idea what would happen in these cases? "
2746,How do anime productions arrange for artists to do the end card illustrations?,"In nearly all anime these days, there's an artist illustration at the very end of an anime episode.   How do the productions get illustrators to do the end cards? Are they paid for it (if so, how much)?  How and why did this practice start?   "
2747,What is typically done when a voice actor for an ongoing series passes away?,"It was recently reported that Matsuki Miyu, a voice actress, has passed away, perhaps from pneumonia or related complications (RIP). She voice-acted key characters in as-yet-incomplete shows, including at least Prisma Illya (Sapphire).  This surely can't be the first time this has happened. What is typically done when a voice actor for an ongoing series (ongoing either in the sense of a continuously-aired show like One Piece or a show with future scheduled seasons like [currently] Prisma Illya) passes away?   (I see three main options - put in a new voice actor for the character; write the character out of the show; or, worst case, cancel the show altogether. But all three options are imperfect. Historically, what has been done in these situations?) "
2748,Is there a connection between the Eye of God from Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood and the Rinnegan from Naruto?,"After watching FMA again, I couldn't help but notice the similarities:   The same ripple-like pattern. Both related to godly powers. Both related to balance (Yin-Yang/All-One) Both related to life and death.      Is there a mythological or conceptual connection between the two? Is one based on the other? "
2749,Why doesn't Usopp create great weapons for himself?,"Usopp is the sniper of the Straw Hat Pirates and also a craftsman who created weapons like his fake 5 ton hammer. He also created a sort of a ""magic"" weapon, Clima Tact that he made for Nami.  I wonder why Usopp did not create another ""magic"" weapon for himself? He can make one for himself, right? I know he has Pop Green which he uses frequently, but it's more of an ammunition for him than a weapon. Why doesn't he create some weapons for himself? "
2750,Why does Black Jack charge exorbitant fees?,"Is there a reason why Black Jack charges exorbitant fees for the surgeries and operations he performs?  In the series I often find Black Jack to be inconsistent due to the amount of free surgeries he performs while maintaining a reputation of charging insane medical fees. Are his ridiculously priced operations merely to get his patients to question the value of their (loved ones) life?    Perhaps the only consistency about his fees, besides their high price, is that if he feels he failed he will cancel the fee. The pricing seems totally random and he charges high amounts even for people that appear to be poor. I understand that as an unlicensed doctor he has no obligations to save someone. However, part of my reason for asking is that the reason Black Jack is alive is entirely due to the fact that a doctor took responsibility and saved his life. Normally, people would feel a sense of debt to this fact and try to repay this debt by doing the same in turn to those they meet in life. I don't think as a doctor he needs to give away surgeries or operations, especially with his level of expertise, but doctors are already well paid and it seems outrageous to charge as much as he does.     Is there anywhere in the manga or anime that solidly explains why he charges as he does, or are there any convincing arguments about this? "
2751,Is the strange reproductive process in The Twelve Kingdoms based on a myth or legend?,"In The Twelve Kingdoms, babies are born from Ranka, or giant eggs that grow on trees.  Is this based on an myth or legend?  Or is it just a way the author invented to explore what happens to a society where the women do not have to give birth?  The idea of babies growing in eggs on trees seems like something I've heard of before somewhere else, but I can't recall where.   "
2752,Why is Dragon Ball Z's Blu-ray ending in English? Where can I find the original Japanese ending credits?,"I saw a DBZ ending on YouTube recently, and I realized that the casting is in English. Why isn't it in Japanese like in the DVD sets? Which Blu-ray set's ending is in English? It it all of them?  Where can I find the original Japanese credits in the ending?   "
2753,What would happen if a master won the Holy Grail War but didn't have any wish?,"In Fate series, what would happen if a master won the Holy Grail War but did not have any wish for the Holy Grail and did not destroy it? What would happen then?  "
2754,Who was Obito going to revive?,"I just watched the recent episode (391) and just prior to Obito being taken over by Black Zetsu, he seemed to have acknowledged his sins and was planning on using Rinne Rebirth - but for whom? It certainly wasn't for Madara because Black Zetsu wouldn't have gotten involved. Jiraya was on his mind, so was it him? Or was he planning on reviving all of the ninja who died during the war? "
2755,Why did Eren have a flashback about titans in episode 1?,"For those who have finished Attack on Titan season one: If you take all that you know into account and rewatch the first episode up to the the first 3 minutes, you will see that Eren was dreaming about the titans before he had ever met one. Do you think that Eren can live in another world or subconsciousness? Is there any explanation for him seeing this dream? "
2756,Why has the Hayate no Gotoku anime switched studios so many times?,"The anime version of Hayate no Gotoku has been done by three different studios so far:   Season 1: SynergySP Season 2: JC Staff Movie, Season 3, Season 4: Manglobe   Each studio's version is a little different. For example, SynergySP focused a lot on parody while JC Staff focused more on romance.  I've seen a few shows switch studios once, but switching twice seems extremely rare.  Why has it switched studios so many times? Was the creator unsatisfied with what the previous studios did to the story? Was it just some financial matter? "
2757,Old Anime (similar to Pokemon) that involved going to different places (/times?) and capturing monsters in their eggs?,I've been trying to find the name of this show for YEARS. I watched it every day when I was young (around 10 years ago now). I'm pretty sure it was on Channel 5 (for all you English people) in the early morning since I would watch it before school.  All I can remember is that there was a group of kids and they'd travel to different places (maybe times too?) and would have to capture some kind of monster (similar to Pokemon/Digimon) that was causing havoc. Each monster I believe was recaptured in an egg (each egg was also unique) and there was usually just one per episode. There may have been some kind of scientist involved with a machine that sent them to these places? But my memories may just be getting confused with Pokemon at that point. I know it wasn't Monster Rancher as I've had suggested by friends but beyond that I've no clue.  Any ideas? I really loved it and it would be amazing to rediscover it after all these years. 
2758,What is the range of Amaterasu?,"Distance-wise, what is the longest distance in which Amaterasu will ignite its target? Does it have unlimited range? For example, if someone used Amaterasu on the moon from the earth, or on the Hokage Monument looking at it from a mile away, would they catch flame? "
2759,Why are manga black and white?,This question triggered my curiosity for this question. Why most of manga are black and white? Is this because of more cost if they add colors to it?  
2760,How much do mangaka profit from anime or merchandise sales?,"People always say they buy stuff of a certain series to support a certain mangaka. Now it made me wonder how much actually goes to the mangaka himself. Do mangaka usually work for a publishing company like jump for example or do they work independent selling their copies to the company?  I assume for every Tankobon copy that is sold, the managaka gets a big share, because it is made by himself, but how does this work for other merchandise like anime, toys, tshirts, games or maybe even events? These things are made independently from the original mangaka by a different company, so does he still get a percentage in every sale of every article sold or how does this work? "
2761,How much time have the Straw Hats spent with each other?,Rewatching a few episodes of One Piece made me wonder:  How much time did the Straw Hats spend with each other before the timeskip?  [It's not necessary for all of them to be present. I'm looking for the time span between the Episode 3 (when Zoro joins the crew) and Episode 405 (when the Straw Hats are separated by Kuma)]  How much time has it been since the timeskip (till the start of Zou arc)? 
2762,What characters are these scantily-clad guys cosplaying as?,"Possibly NSFW (Contains near nude guys)         Does anybody knows what anime these costumes are from, and what characters they are for? Is this even from an anime? "
2763,Does the name Jiraiya mean something that connects these 2 instances?,"While I was playing Tales of Phantasia, in the Future where the vocal impressionists are (nearby to where the Elven Forest is) there is a guy dressed up like a frog. When you talk to him he says (according to the English translation)     Ninja Art!   Jiraiya!   Ribbit?   Obviously this made me think of Jiraiya from Naruto and his affinity with frogs and to my understanding Tales of Phantasia predates Naruto.  So does the name Jiraiya mean something that connects what this frog guy says in Tales of Phantasia and Jiraiya in Naruto? "
2764,Is there a reason for the sudden change in style in episode 11?,"The animation throughout the first 10 episodes seemed pretty consistent to me.       However, episode 11's style had nothing to do with the first 10 episodes (though it was probably consistent throughout the episode):     Since this show is filled with references to other anime, it occurred to me that the change in style could be a reference in itself. If so, what was it a reference to? If not, why the sudden change in style? Was it due to budget or something similar, or did they just decide to go on a different direction for some random reason? "
2765,Doesn't letting the non-existent students do exams acknowledge their existence?,"This contains spoilers for Another, which is somewhat new (the anime is from 2012).  Another is an anime series about a cursed classroom. The students (and teachers) have designed a countermeasure to avoid the curse from triggering each year, which consists on completely ignoring a student (treating them as non-existent). By doing this, the number of students in the classroom is technically decreased by one, which makes up for the extra dead student that got mixed in the class.  Misaki is the chosen student to be ignored by the classroom this year. After a mess up, Sakakibara is also ignored.  However, if I'm not mistaken, during exam periods, both students (Misaki and Sakakibara) have exam papers. Why? Doesn't giving them exam papers pretty much acknowledge that they exist? Doesn't that break the entire countermeasure? (from the point of view of the classroom)  Edit  For clarification: the countermeasure involves people directly related to the class. This means, students that belong to this classroom and teachers that teach this class. External students and teachers from other classrooms are not involved with the curse, so they may interact with the non-existent students just fine.  The librarian, and students from the art club etc, have no problem interacting with the non-existent students.  The external students/teachers are not very well aware of the curse though. The cursed classroom tries not to talk about it with others. "
2766,Why did Mavis lend Fairy Glitter magic to Cana?,Cana got Fairy Glitter from Mavis's tomb in Tenrou Island. Mavis also said in Daimatou Enbu that she lent this magic to Cana.  But I'm still not sure why Mavis lent Fairy Glitter to Cana? Is there any explanation for this? 
2767,Why can't Roy Mustang bring his eyes back using his gate?,"Why can't Roy Mustang bring his eyes back using his gate?  In the final chapter of the Fullmetal Alchemist manga, Roy Mustang said ""I'd readily sacrifice my own gate like Fullmetal did, but then I'd have no way back"".   Why he couldn't come back like Ed did?  "
2768,Did Whitebeard know where the One Piece is located?,"Whitebeard and Gol D. Roger were friends, they were shown chatting with each other, Roger even told Whitebeard that his name really is Gol D.

2770,Can Lucy still call her Celestial Spirits?,"After the time skip, Lucy gained the new magic ""Star Dress"" that allows Lucy to have the power of her Celestial Spirits.   But is she still able to call her Celestial Spirits as she did before?   I haven't watched the entire anime series, I just read the manga. Did I forget or miss something about Lucy's Celestial Spirits? "
2771,What are the differences between all those different ki blast attacks?,"Some ki attacks in the Dragon Ball universe have pretty distinct purposes. Taiyōken blinds, Makankōsappō punctures, Kienzan cuts, etc. But then there is the standard ki blast attack, and every fighter or martial arts school has their own version of it: Piccolo and Gohan use Masenkō, Vegeta uses Gyarikku Hō, and everyone descended from the turtle school uses Kamehameha. Not to mention the many nameless energy blasts used in between.  Is there an in-universe explanation for the differences between these (other than color and shape)?  Also, Vegeta develops new (presumably stronger) attacks to replace his old ones. He moves from Gyarikku Hō to Big Bang Attack to Final Flash. Kamehameha, on the other hand, remains a staple throughout the series.  Is there any logic to this in canon? I suspect not. But if I'm missing something, I'd be interested to know. "
2772,What does it mean when Pride mentions about Edward turning into a philosopher's stone to infiltrate him?,"In episode 61, when the fight goes on between Edward and Pride, Kimblee interferes with the mind of Pride. Edward uses this moment to attack Pride by getting into his mind (or body maybe). However, as this occurs, the dialog of Pride to Edward is this:     he turned himself into a philosopher's stone to infiltrate me?   What does this mean and how it is possible as Edward is not in possession of a philosopher's stone (not sure whether he can do it with a philosopher's stone)? "
2773,Minimum amount of people for harem?,"Silly question, but how many people do you need at minimum in a love-triangle (or love-polygon, whatever) for something to be classified as a harem manga/anime? If ""only"" three people are involved, and not even at the same time, would that already be a harem? "
2774,Why are post offices always a target for robbers in anime?,"I've seen quite a number of anime where the targets for robbers are mostly post offices and not banks and or other places that could have money. Is this a plot device that started somewhere or is it actually a fact that robbers actually go for post offices in Japan? If it is the latter, can someone shed some light on why post offices are a favourite target for robbers?  Some examples of anime that have post offices robbed off the top of my head are Sword Art Online and Toaru Majutsu no Index. There are probably more titles where this happens that I can't remember. "
2775,How many transformations does Chopper have after time skip?,"At first, Chopper said that he can transform into 7 different forms using his Rumble Ball:   Brain Point  Heavy Point Jump Point Guard Point Horn Point Walk Point Arm Point   By the time, he also has Monster Point by eating three Rumble Balls at once.  After time skip, he can also transform into his Kung Fu Point. I've so far seen Guard, Brain, Walk, Heavy, Horn, and Monster Point after time skip, but I think I haven't or have yet to see Chopper transform into his other forms.  Is Chopper have shown to transform into his Arm Point or Jump Point after the time skip? And is the Kung Fu Point his only new transformation? "
2776,Does the door connects only between 2 worlds or does it connects more?,"In Isekai Shokudou (Restaurant to Another World) does the door connects only between 2 worlds (let's call it world A and world B), or does it connects to more than 2 worlds?  In other words, does all the other world customer come from the same world, or do they come from many different worlds?  I notice that some do come from the same world, like the Princess Victoria and the Great Mage Artorius. But does Princess Victoria share the same world with Kuro? "
2777,What exactly is Devil Summoning?,"In Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 2 - Innocent Sin when you first go to the Kuzunoha Detective Agency both Tamaki Uchida and Daisuke Todoroki are described as ""Devil Summoners"".  After Yukino Mayuzumi joins the party and you visit the detective agency she comments that Tamaki is from Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 1 as both her and Tadashi Satomi are graduates from St. Hermelin (though i don't entire remember them) but i don't remember anyone outside the 10 Persona Users having gained any abilities during the incident.  So what is Devil Summoning? is this in some way connected to Personas? "
2778,Is there a flaw in the ease of access to One Piece?,"One Piece is the ultimate treasure, located in the hardest spot to get to in the world, or is it? Recently, the Straw Hats left Dressrosa and arrived at Zou. Both places are inhabited with some sort of intelligent being (Zou's people may not be humans). If this continues, or even if it doesn't, wouldn't it be really easy for these people to check Raftel for One Piece?  I understand this makes for a better story, but isn't that a serious flaw? "
2779,How did Boruto learn the shadow clone jutsu?,"Who taught Boruto the shadow clone Jutsu? In the anime, episode 36 Kakashi asks if Boruto's father (Naruto) taught him the jutsu, but he replied no. If Naruto didn't teach Boruto, then who did? "
2780,"Why is it said that the Tsukihime anime ""does not exist""?","I've been hearing people talk about how the 2003 Tsukihime anime ""does not exist"", for example, here and here. I wonder why that is, when the anime had great art and music for its time. On the other hand, I don't hear people saying Studio Deen's Fate/stay night anime does not exist, even though it has had its fair share of criticisms.  So why has the Tsukihime anime acquired this hate? How and when did the saying start to spread, and do the Japanese audiences also echo this phrase online? "
2781,"A different version of ""Attack on D"" from near the end of season 2 episode 12?","So I heard this song in Attack on Titan towards the end of season 2 episode 12 and when I compared it to the soundtrack, I found out it was called ""Attack on D"".  However, the song in the actual episode (episode 12) has a piano part in it and the 'la la la' part only comes in towards the end of the song.  Is it a different song? If so, is it available in the OST? "

2784,"What does ""padoru padoru"" mean?","In the short Nero in a Santa outfit sings a ""Jingle Bells"" with some rather casual lyrics.     Hashire sori yo, kaze no you ni, tsukimihara wo, padoru padoru   The lyric is a song of this clip (for the full clip, click here). The song sounds like a ""Jingle Bells"", but the subs don't seem to match up with the spoken dialogue (""Laughing all the way"" as a translation for ""padoru padoru"").  I have searched on Know Your Meme, but I couldn't get the meaning of ""padoru"" from the lyrics. I have also tried google translate, and this is what I got:     Peeling as Tsukurei Sled Like a cold   What is the meaning of ""padoru"" in the context the short or song? "
2785,Why is Kyoko not present in Madoka Magica's official artwork?,"Is there a reason that Kyoko is not pictured in some of the series' more prominent artwork? As part of the story's main set of magical girls, and a character important to the plot, I would expect her to be featured with the rest of the quintet. I consider this piece    to be the anime's ""official"" artwork, so (barring whether or not that is a valid assumption on my part) why is a character as important as Kyoko not featured in it?  The image above was used for Netflix1 in the past and is currently used in Crunchyroll's listing as well. The current (Dec 13 2014) image used by Netflix is apparently a different one but nonetheless still does not feature Kyoko.  Another instance of this ""phenomenon"" can be seen in the first volume of the manga:    though an easy explanation for this one could be that      Kyoko doesn't appear until the very end of the first volume, and/so her character is not significant to the first part whatsoever.   So my question is this:  Why doesn't Kyoko appear in the anime's more iconic or official artwork, or are my assumption(s) about the artwork incorrect?    EDIT: More cases   Netflix listing, Dec 13 2014 Older Netflix listing screenshot ... (source)     1This is the image I remember being used when I saw it on Netflix a while back, but I'm not sure if it's been updated/changed since, because I don't use the service anymore. "
2786,Why was Danzo after Shisui eyes?,"This has been bugging me for a while. I'm very interested in Shisui's story of his life, but the real question is why was Donzo after his eye? Was it because of his sharingan? and ""how is Donzo supposed to use this""? "
2787,Who has the highest bounty in One Piece?,"I'd like to know, who in the One Piece world has the max bounty declared against them till date? Note that the bounty amount has to be mentioned in either anime or manga or in the movies. I am assuming it is Katakuri? But I'm not sure. "
2788,Where are the remaining Angels?,"We know in one of the episodes while Goku, Vegeta, Whis and Beerus sat down to eat, Whis stated that there were 18 Universes before and Zeno erased 6 Universes while he was in a bad mood.   After the Zen Exhibition match, we know for a fact that if Zeno were to erase a universe, even the gods, The kaioshin and hakaishin would also be erased. We also know that the angels are not related to the universe and their duty is to only serve the god of destruction, which is again mentioned by Whis when Beerus questioned as to why he wouldn't get erased.  It was also mentioned by Shin during the Future Trunks arc that if Beerus were to die, Whis were to leave the universe as his sole duty is to only serve Beerus.   Based on these events, shouldn't there exist 6 more angels of the erased Universes? Why aren't they watching the tournament of power (When the exempted universes are watching the same)? We know these angels don't cease to exist once their universe is erased as we see some of the angels of the erased universes seated and watching the tournament of power.   What are your thoughts on the same? "
2789,Why are the chapters named after other works?,"Just noticed that some (if not all) of the chapter titles are named after another movie or book. There is   Chapter 005. Enter the Dragon Chapter 031. God Father Chapter 037. Mission Impossible Chapter 041. Die Hard II or Chapter 059. Groundhog Day   just to name a few.  And then I take a look at Wikipedia entry about list of School Rumble chapters and pick some random chapter and always find another work, film, series, or novel with the same title. Even side stories like    Side stories 15. Once Upon a Time in Mexico Side stories 25. Monsters Inc. Side stories 54. Ocean's Eleven    are named after another works.  So I tried to see list of School Rumble episodes, and it looks like only the manga chapters are named after other works.  Some titles are related to the story somehow, but some titles seem a little bit random. Why do these chapters use other works' titles? Has there been any word from the author about this? Are all chapters named after other works' titles? "
2790,Why is Rin's butler Emiya Shirou in UBW true ending?,"In the UBW true ending it is stated (in the anime) that Shirou is Rin's butler.  I assume they took it from Fate Hollow Ataraxia (the butler part). Why is that? Does Rin enjoy making Shirou be and feel beneath her or something?  New informtion due to the discussions that have taken place  I'm really sorry for the misunderstanding and not explainig well my question.  E..tto... I was asking something similar to what Lord was talking about. I used the word butler on purpose and I mentioned Fate Hollow Ataraxia on purpose as well. In fate hollow it is confirmed that Shirou works for Lluvia as a part-time job [to be able to eat without resorting to Rin I take it]. However, in the anime they changed it, Lluvia's words make it clear he's now Rin's butler, not Lluvia's. My questions remain being ""Why is that?"" and ""Does Rin enjoy making Shirou be and feel beneath her or something?"" "
2791,Why does Vegeta tolerate Android 18?,"Probably a stupid question but...  I was watching Resurrection 'F' and when 18 appeared on screen this question popped into my head. During the Android saga he was pretty much curb stomped by 18 right? (Memories are a little clouded) And Vegeta being as prideful as he is would he really let 18 live regardless of how ""good"" he became?  Is it just a plot point that wasn't explored? Is Vegeta's switch to the good side cause for this? I just find this one a little hard to believe. I'd probably believe it more that since 18 is important to Krillin and he is important to Goku, that Goku had something to do with it.  Again, sorry if this question is dumb. "
2792,In what order do I consume the Blame! universe?,"I recently stumbled upon the Blame! movie on Netflix. I eagerly watched it, enjoying every minute of it - not least for the underlying amazing world. I realized that it was based on the manga of the same name and looked it up.  Now there's more than just the manga, to my knowledge there is:   Blame! (Manga) Blame!² (Oneshot?) NOiSE (Manga) NSE: Net Sphere Engineer (Manga?) Blame! (ONA) Blame! Prologue (ONA) Blame! (Movie, 2017)   In what order should I best consume these works? And am I missing any more of them in this list? "
2793,What is the song when Karma was introduced for the first time in episode 2?,"In the beginning of the 1st episode of season 1, there is a soundtrack playing in the background that gives off sort of calm and mysterious vibe.   Usually, if I encounter an interesting music theme, I am able to find the author of the composition or even the OST itself with enough persistence and searching. However, this one has been a real struggle for me, probably the hardest one to find so far. None of the known methods of identifying music names were crowned with success in the instance with this piece of music, so I really would like to know if anyone knows something about it.   Also, this OST was played at the very end of the 2nd episode of season 1, when Karma was introduced to the audience for the first time.   I have provided a link below to the video of what the soundtrack sounds like:  [website]I really would appreciate if anyone could point me in the right direction because I don't know what else to do to get the answer at this stage.

2795,"At the end, did Naruto skip Chunnin and Jounin rank before becoming Hokage?","In chapter 700 of Naruto manga (last chapter) it was shown that Uzumaki Naruto finally reached his dream of becoming Hokage. It was also shown that he didn't achieve it immediately after the 4th Shinobi War ended as Hatake Kakashi was the 6th Hokage and Naruto was the 7th.  AFAIK, even when fighting Otsutsuki Kaguya, Naruto was a Genin as he never passed the Chuunin nor Jounin exam (as far as the manga is concerned). There is an anime where Naruto took the Chuunin exam, but he failed after disqualified due to using Sage Mode.  It was shown in Naruto the Movie ""Road to Ninja"", that to become Jounin, one must become a Chuunin first. However it is also to be noted that double promotion is also possible.  4th, 5th, and 6th Hokage were all Jounin prior to being Hokage. I'm not sure about the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Hokage, although strength-wise they are stronger than your average Jounin. The next Hokage was chosen either by the current Hokage, or the Daimyou of the Land of Fire. No other requirements was listed on the Wikia.  So, to the question, has Naruto reached the rank of Jounin when he was selected as the 7th Hokage? Or was he still a Genin, since it didn't actually matter much considering that everyone knows who he is, that he was the hero who saved Konoha from Pain, and more importantly the world from Infinite Tsukuyomi. "
2796,From which series should I start watching Dragon Ball?,"I know that Dragon Ball is a very long saga.   Which series should I start with? Is there any of the new ones the reboot of the old ones? If I start with Dragon Ball Super, will it be continuing the others, or is it a reboot of the first one?  "
2797,Can E.N.D slay Acnologia?,"If E.N.D is the strongest Demon in the Books of Zeref and if Acnologia can slay countless dragons, is it possible for E.N.D to slay Acnologia?  I mean, when you think about it, Natsu's dad couldn't slay E.N.D, so is it possible for the Demon to slay a dragon like Acnologia? "
2798,What kind of flavour do Devil Fruits have?,"In the One Piece world, there are so many Devil Fruits having different shapes. I'm a little bit curious about the flavour of Devil Fruits: Is it different from one to another?  If I'm not mistaken, there's a fruit that resembles Banana or Apple. Do they taste same as their real counterparts?  Is the taste of the Devil Fruits ever mentioned in the Anime or Manga? "
2799,Does Aniraza have ki?,"So three robots fused somehow with an apparent humanoid alien. The result is a giant humanoid looking alien that we dont know if it's a robot, and android, a humanoid or what. He has an energy reactor according to what android 17 said, though he has this big aura. 17 has showed in this episode to have aura but he has also said he doesnt have ki, making humanoid androids possible to have aura and not ki.   So, what kind of entity is Aniraza exactly? Does Aniraza have ki? "

2801,When did the Kin/Gin Brothers get their Nine-Tails power?,"Now I'm rather confused. The timeline doesn't add up to me. I was hoping someone to shed some light.  So here's how the events seemingly happened.   The hidden cloud had, for a period, attempted to capture the nine-tails. As a result, the nine-tails ate the Kin/Gin Brothers. To survive, they ate the flesh from his stomach. The nine-tails spit them out, and they had his chakra when they were expelled.   That's all fine, but it doesn't add up.   It was said that between the five great villages, the Hidden Leaf was the first. It was also said that after Madara's and Hashirama's battle, the nine-tails was sealed inside Hashirama's wife, Mito. Shortly before Mito died, the nine-tails was transferred to Kushina. During the short nine-tails attack on the village (after being freed from Kushina), the nine-tails was sealed again, inside of Naruto.   Now, we also know that the Kin/Gin brothers were at the same time as the second Hokage, Tobirama. Given that they were the ones who killed him.  When did they have time to get swallowed up by the nine-tails?. The Hidden Cloud village didn't exist before Konoha did, so it can't be before Madara's and Hashirama's battle, and right after that, the nine-tails was in constant Leaf possession.  So when? When did the cloud try to get the nine-tails? "
2802,"Why can Renamon disappear, while Guilmon and Terriermon can't?","In Digimon Tamers, we see Renamon disappear or fade out after she is no longer needed several times. (For instance, she disappears at the end of episode 7, after Rika, Henry, and Takato have rescued Guilmon.) Meanwhile, Guilmon and Terriermon do not seem capable of this: Takato has to take pains to hide Guilmon (ep. 2), and Henry has to pass off Terriermon as a stuffed animal when he is at home (ep. 1).  Why is this the case? Does it have something to do with the monsters themselves, or is it an issue of the abilities of the Tamer? (But Henry seems knowledgable enough to me, so I am not entirely convinced by that theory.) "
2803,Why are the DD Girls called that?,"Why are the DD Girls named such?  Their name in katakana: [ディーディー・ガールズ], has no meaning, other than just being ""DD Girls""...  How do we even know that they're called the DD Girls? "
2804,Can a single dragon ball be destroyed? What would happen to the rest of them?,I guess they'd be unsuable but would a new set need to be made then? Would the past set simply vanish or turn to stone? 
2805,Who writes the plot for filler episodes in an anime?,"Fillers are a given in most long running anime. If the anime is based on a manga then who writes the plot for the fillers?  Who decides the plot story for a filler season, so that it, for example, doesn't conflict with the original story of the manga? "
2806,"Anime reviewers refer to ""art"" and ""animation"" separately. What does each one refer to?","I've read and listened to anime reviewers rate the art and animation of a given title, and I'm not clear which is which, nor specifically what they refer to.  I imagine they're referring to the quality of the visuals, but I'm not sure if the backgrounds are the art, the characters the animation, vice versa, or if I've got it completely discombobulated. Is there more to the visuals than the characters and the backgrounds? Conversely, am I oversimplifying it?  Searching DDG yielded a mess since the terms were too generic. "
2807,Why does Law want to kill Kaido?,"Law makes an alliance with Mugiwara to kill one of the Yonko, Kaido of the Beasts. But, why does Law want to kill Kaido? Is it because Law wants to be one of Yonko? "
2808,Does Narcolepsy that Riki had really exist?,"At the earlier episodes of little buster. he said that he has an illness called Narcolepsy. Actually, from the beginning of the little buster series, he already in       Kyousuke's world where all of his friends died on car accident   So we ca assume that Riki only had his illness, when he got into       Kyousuke's World    But what happen with the Narcolepsy that Riki had before he enters       Kyousuke's World ?   Did he still got this illness ? "
2809,What's the difference between Sky Walk and Geppo?,"Is the technique Sanji learnt during the timeskip different from the one CP9 members and other Rokushiki users performed to stay in the air?

2810,How are anime seasons released?,"Are there set periods of time in which seasons start and end? In America, generally, TV shows begin in the Fall or the Summer.

2811,Why did Kaoru's hair color change?,"In the very start of the first episode, Kaoru had Dark blue hair. But after that, her hair color changed to blonde. Why did Kaoru dye her hair?  Does it mean something like a start of a new chapter of her life? What is the significance of this in the story?  During the Marriage/Honeymoon:   At home (and the rest of the episodes):  "
2812,What artbook is this image of an angel girl from?,"This question came up in chat here. The goal was originally to identify this image:    I found a much larger version of the image (click for full size):    This shows that this is actually part of a 2-page spread in an artbook (pages 16 and 17), and has some (Japanese) text on it. The text is somewhat readable, as is the artist's name, but there's some difficulty in reading some of the characters/letters. It also seems likely that the characters are original.  Who is the artist of this image, and what artbook is it from? Also, what does the text say? "
2813,Why has nobody been able to summon Exodia before Yugi?,"In the first episode of Yu-Gi-Oh!, Yugi manages to assemble all five pieces of Exodia, to which Kaiba says in shock:     Exodia! It’s not possible! Nobody has ever been able to call him!   [website]Why was it so tough to assemble Exodia, to the point where nobody had ever been able to summon him? I mean, we see a Rare Hunter do it in the Battle City arc, without really using the new rules Kaiba created. And given the number of people playing Duel Monsters, I would think somebody would have tried and succeeded before, despite the odds.  So why has nobody been able to summon Exodia before Yugi? "
2814,Where is the divergence in Fate/Apocrypha?,"I know that the light novel Fate/Apocrypha has some divergent point after the Third Grail War, but I was wondering what exactly that divergent point was. How did the world end up without a Fourth and Fifth Grail war? Did someone win the Third Grail War, or was there something else that happened differently? "
2815,Is there a specific arc for Sinon in the anime?,"I'm rewatching the whole SAO series and I go to the manga whenever I want to clear things up for the show but I thought about something.   In the Aincrad novels, there are specific chronological Arcs for:     Silica, Lizbeth, Yui, Sachi   But in the second season, we see Sinon, a ""main?"" character. But isn't there a specific Arc for her? or some more backstory than what we see in the Anime?       The fact that she gets scared of guns but in-game she isn't, and her past at the bank.   I couldn't find any Arcs for the characters of the second season so if there are where can I find them or what are they called? "
2816,How long was Saber waiting for Shirou after she died?,"Regarding the question that was asked before: Do Emiya Shirou and Arturia ever meet again after Fate/stay night?       In the Visual Novel of Fate Stay/Night Realta Nua once you have seen all 5 endings a new ending appears accessible from the title screen call -Last Episode-, this is in 2 parts, a Monologue of the Fate Route and a second part where Arturia is hearing from Merlin about a miracle achievable by 2 people, one who ""wait endlessly"" and one who ""pursue endlessly"", eventfully the pursuer will stop when they reach the waiter.      What Merlin is referring to is Arturia waiting and Shirou pursueing, eventually Shirou reaches Avalon where Arturia is sleeping and the 2 finally reunite, it's not entirely sure how long it took Shirou to reach Avalon however considering that Avalon transcends all magic including the 5 Magics it must have taken an eternity for Shirou to reach.   Obviously if it took them an eternity to meet, it's common sense that it never happened.    So my theory is that there are two options for this occasion:     The author's definition of eternity is something different from what is known to the public. That it was some sort of an inside joke to troll the audience who desperately want to see them reunite.   Is there any official statement about how long eternity is according to the Fate Stay/Night series? Are there even any clues on which to base some sort of speculation on the matter? Or maybe the light novel perhaps mentions something about it.    I really want to know how much Saber had to suffer in order to finally meet with Shirou. (IMO after all she's been through, she has suffered quite enough already).  "
2817,Why didn't Netero call the more powerful adventurers for help in Chimera Ant arc?,"In the Chimera Ant arc of Hunter x Hunter,      Netero and the Chimera King Meruem have a showdown, which leads to Netero's death, and later on, Meruem. The fight was pretty one-sided, considering the final state of Meruem compared to Netero, but it was to expect considering the former events.   We learn later that there are powerful adventurers out there (the Zodiacs), that have a seemingly tremendous amount of power.  My question is: why didn't Netero call them for help? He knew the enemy had a tremendous power, and he may have avoided what happened to him if he was helped during the mission (not even the showdown). So why did he call only those who are part of the mission in the Chimera Ant Arc? This could have been way less dangerous for them to have more firepower and capabilities. "
2818,Why is the kamehameha so widely used? Is it the best ki blast beam?,"There are tons of different beam attacks like the Masenko or Galick Gun, why does everyone seem to go for the Kamehameha instead? Going as far as to have Cell use it as his ultimate move instead of the Final Flash he witnessed not so long ago, is it the best ki blast beam? Why? Buu also copied it as soon as he saw it, he didn't seem to bother with the other beam attacks "
2819,"English, Hepburn, English, Hepburn, alternating in OP and ED. Why?","The anime series Big Windup has a full English dub, and it does it does something interesting with its openings and endings. (I just checked, and the same thing occurs in the sub.) By ""full dub"", I mean even the credits are translated. The interesting thing is that in odd episodes, the opening and ending songs are shown in English subtitles. However, even episodes show the song text in Hepburn (Japanese with Latin characters). At least I think it is an odd:even pattern; I'm only on episode 5.  I can think of a sort of practical reason to do this.  For English speakers who want to know what the songs mean, they see that in the odd episodes.  For English speakers who would like to sing along, they can do so in the even episodes. Is that the reason, or is something else going on? Have other series done this?  ----- added next day -----  I completed season 1, and have begun season 2.  It isn't on Funimation, though, but it legally streams on YouTube on Nozomi Entertainment's channel (Japanese dub with English sub). They continued the subbing of opening and ending songs.  This time, though, both the English and Hepburn text are displayed each episode. (Nozomi licensed season 2, Funimation season 1.) "
2820,What is the difference between Lost Technica 《秘奥義【ロスト・テクニカ】》 and Last Crest 《魔道極法【ラスト・クレスト】》?,"The terms Lost Technica 《秘奥義【ロスト・テクニカ】》 and Last Crest 《魔道極法【ラスト・クレスト】》 are quite ambiguous, since they are usually mentioned together with the explanation for being a member of Trinity Seven.  In chapter 17, both terms are used one after another near the end of the chapter. This is from just before Liese activated her trump card.     ""To be a Trinity Seven means that you've acquired the Lost Technica in your particular archive.""  - Liese [Japanese version]   When Liese activated her trump card, and Sora (the human form of Astil grimoire), warned Arata about the magic being used.     ""This is Avaritia's Lost Technica, the Last Crest ..."" - Sora      ""That's right. It's Baal Peor"" - Liese   Then in chapter 19, the condition to be part of Trinity Seven is reiterated, but this time with Last Crest in place of Lost Technica:     ""The Trinity Seven are the top class magi of each of the seven deadly sins, right?"" - Arata      ""Correct. We are the ones who have mastered the Last Crest of each archive"" - Lilith [Japanese version]   I have two questions regarding these two ambiguous terms:   What is the difference between them? Regardless whether they refer to different concept or not, does Lost Technica implies Last Crest and vice versa?   (Please back up your answer with primary sources, rather than secondary sources like Wikipedia or Wikia. You can use them as starting point, though). "
2821,Story gap between Manga Arc 2 and 3?,So I have finished the anime and been reading the manga but after Arc 2 when Subaru and Ram decide to go after Rem it abruptly finishes and Arc 3 starts after the battle with the demon dog.

2822,Divergence numbers in logo: Steins;Gate easter egg?,"So I recently remembered the Steins;Gate anime and upon searching the logo in google, there appear to be what I think are divergence numbers behind the letters. You can plainly see a complete string of numbers in the letter i. If you zoom in enough, there are also a bunch of scattered, unconnected(?) ones hiding in the letters n, s, G, t and e. A zero (0) can also be found in the dot of the ""i"", but it's a bit of a stretch. Or not.  My question is: What world line do these numbers correspond to in the anime or VN?

I want to watch conqueror of Shamballa but it seems like it continues from the  original series.

After the timeskip, though, only Sanageyama's is in working order - and it, too, comes apart as he's evacuating the last of the people from his home turf in northern Kanto.

2831,Has this painting appeared anywhere else besides Angel Beats! and Charlotte?,"It is well known that Charlotte is the second anime created by Key in collaboration with P.A.Works, the first being Angel Beats!. Therefore, it comes as no surprise that Charlotte makes passing references to Angel Beats!, most of which can be found in episode 7.  This is the scene at 08:19 of episode 10 of Charlotte:    The painting behind the school principal is the same as the painting hanging in the Anti-Angel Headquarters in Angel Beats!.  This piqued my interest: is this a real painting, perhaps one that hangs in the Key office or in the Japanese school principal offices? Or has this appeared in other fictional work, like one of Key's visual novels?  P.S. I know the probability is high that this is an original painting that first appeared in Angel Beats!, because a few seconds after the above scene, we could see the same calligraphy of the kanji character 心 (kokoro) that is featured in episode 12 of Angel Beats!, meaning the two paintings could just be references to the first anime by Jun Maeda, but I need more input backed by facts.

A variation of this technique was termed the ""threepeat tilt up"" by a redditor, but is that the correct technical term for this kind of shots? Would the above GIF be called a ""fourpeat zoom in""?  Also, was this technique borrowed from the film industry, or was it invented in anime? "
2833,Why was the Fifth Holy Grail War so early?,"I'm watching Fate/Zero, and it talks about how the Holy Grail Wars are supposed to be every 60 years. However, it's set in the 1990s, and the Fifth Holy Grail War takes place in the 2000s. Why were there only 10 years(ish) in between instead of 60?

2836,Why was Sakurai Takahiro recast in Psycho-Pass 2?,"In Psycho-Pass (season 1), Sakurai Takahiro voiced Makishima Shougo. In Psycho-Pass 2, he voices Hinakawa Shou. I find it strange that the same voice actor would be cast to voice two different important characters in the same show.   Sure, it's common for a voice actor to voice multiple side characters, I guess to reduce the total number of voice actors that need to be hired (e.g. from this season, Fukuyama Jun voices Hunchoceratops and a few side characters in Amagi Brilliant Park; and Kayano Ai voices a number of side characters in Shirobako). But two different main characters? That's weird.   Weirder still, Sakurai is severely playing against type as Hinakawa - soft-spoken roles just aren't what he does, for the most part. Do we know why Sakurai was recast as a different character in Psycho-Pass 2?  "

2838,Which route is the Rewrite anime based on?,"I watched the last episode of Rewrite the anime. I am well aware that it is based on the visual novel of the same title. I have a question regarding the end of the anime. The end is rather unusual.      At the end of the anime, Gaia successfully evoked Kagari's salvation. Humanity, including the main character, Koutarou, and the heroines are all wiped out too.   Because of that, I think that the ending is based on the      bad end   route. Is that really the case? If not, then which route was it based on? "

Issei managed to get rid of it from the White Dragon as it was a Fragment of Magical Device attached to the White Dragon guy's accessories. Then, after Issei defeats that guy, he gets the Divider Fragment and fuses it with his Dragon Booster on his right arm.  I hoped he would use that dividing power later in the next season, but what happened to it? Where did that power go? "
2842,Why do people keep comparing Shinji to Yesod?,"Several analyses of Shinji Ikari's character compare him to Yesod.   Now Wikipedia has this on Yesod:     Yesod (Hebrew: יסוד ""foundation"") is a sephirah in the kabbalistic Tree of Life. Yesod is the sephirah below Hod and Netzach, and above Malkuth (the kingdom). It can be seen as the vehicle, from one thing or condition to another (the power of connection).   I read some more on that, and I really didn't get it.  What is this connection / what traits does Shinji have in common with this sephirah? What symbolism does the MC of Eva have, in this context?

I know I demand too much, but please help me understand how Karma-kun got a^3/2. The only perspective that I got from Karma is that all the 8 atoms form a cube of their own, and the middle point of that imaginary cube is equivalent to all the atoms inside the 8 individual cubes.  And the video says so as well, but how the in the world has it gone from A 1/8 to 2A? and then a^3/2  as shown here:  "

2859,Who applies censorship on an ecchi anime?,"In my few years of watching anime, I have noticed varied amounts of ecchi-ness portrayed and the corresponding censorship it generates. I mentioned ""varied"" because I have noted differences in censorship techniques (black/white bars, excessive lighting) and the amount dealt to the scene. For instance most non-ecchi anime have the breasts censored, some only have the nipples removed, and a quite a few bare them completely. The quite few who go the extremes may even be classified as hentai already.  Points in case (I wanted to include pics but then decided against it):   Partial covers: Gokukoku no Brynhildr, Infinite Stratos, Trinity Seven Bared completely: HighSchool DxD, Yosuga no Sora, Elfen Lied   My question: How does Japan implement various levels of content ratings (G, PG, R18+)?  Is it the production studio who applies these varying amount of censorship or is there a committee assigned that does it? Does the same apply for violence/gore censorship? "
2860,Space-Time ninjutsu of Tobi,"Why can't Tobi attack while he is dodging an attack using his Jikūkan Ninjutsu ?      what Tobi actually does is warp away the part of his body that was being attacked to the other dimension.   During the entire anime it is portrayed that Tobi cannot attack while using Jikūkan Ninjutsu because his attacks will pass right through the target.   But while Kakashi was in Tobi's space-time dimension, he managed to punch him, thus indicating that Tobi wasn't intangible.  Is there any explanation or any theory on this matter ? "

Does he accept Luffy as his captain because of his dream? Or because he is stronger than him?

2863,Why is the fee for Yato-gami to do things just ¥5 (5 Yen)?,"No matter what the job is, finding cats, to avenging a murdered child, all it takes for Yato to grant those is just a measly ¥5. I suspect that this practice dated back from during the time when Yato was actively known as God of Disaster.   Since there is inflation, while ¥5 now worths almost nothing, it must have worth a lot more in the past. If this is the reason, then how much far in the past was the year that Yato was actively known as the God of Disaster if we are to use real world's currency value?  If this was not the case, why is the fee just ¥5 while other Gods have it more, which can be seen from their lavish and abundant number of shrines? "

So, what are the numbers referring to? 3.6 what? I googled Visual Acuity, and I'm guessing those with death god eyes can see over 3 and a half times further than normal humans? 3.6 times to be exact.   I never read the manga, or saw the Japanese version, so I ask this question to confirm it with perhaps something someone read. "

2869,What is the logic behind Sephiroth's forms?,"Generally in Final Fantasy the appearance of the final bosses have some sort of relevance to one another and/or the plot ie.  Final Fantasy VIII      1st - Ultimecia Fights  2nd - Ultimecia Summons Griever  3rd - Ultimecia junctions Griever (similar to what Adel does with Rinoa)  4th - Ultimecia begins absorbing all of reality (time, space, existence, stars and planets from across the space/time continuum)   Final Fantasy XIII      1st - Barthandelus fights the l'Cie to try and force their hand  2nd - Menrva enter into Orphan's Pool and gives birth to it, Menrva and Barthandelus are assimilated forming Orphan's protective outer shell  3rd - Orphan emerges exposed from the protective outershell   But with Final Fantasy VII i'm not quite sure of the connection between the Sephiroth who the party sees floating (after defeating JENOVA:SYNTHESIS), the 2 non-human forms the party fights then the human form Cloud fights in the end.   =>   =>   =>    Above is the order they appear in. the first one (human, wearing his black coat) is what he looked like before the battle against the 2nd final boss start. the second image is Bizarro∙Sephiroth who is the second final boss. the third image is Safer∙Sephiroth who is the third final boss and the forth image is what Sephiroth looked like in the cinematic battle (where while it shows a battle it's rigged for him to loose with Cloud gaining Omnislash and if he fails to use it and Sephiroth attacks Cloud counters killing him)  My question is how does Sephiroth go from looking human at first to looking like Bizarro and Safer Sephiroth before going back to human? is Bizarro and Safer Sephiroth just more Sephiroth Clones and only the last topless Sephiroth is the real Sephiroth?

2870,What rank does Edward Elric hold?,"Ed is a State Alchemist, but what's his rank within the military hierarchy?  Col.

Ichigo..apparently does nothing about this. He doesn't blindfold himself or protect his eyes in any way that would be obvious to an anime viewer. Aizen could presumably just activate his weapon and negate Ichigo's only advantage at a whim.   Does Ichigo do anything to protect him from Aizen's illusions? If not, why does Ichigo charge Aizen without any regard for protecting himself from his game-ending ability, despite being warned about it minutes earlier? "
2872,How closely related do two Uchihas have to be in order for one to obtain the Eternal Mangekyō Sharingan?,"When a user of the Mangekyō Sharingan wants the Eternal Mangekyō Sharingan, do they have to take the eyes of their sibling, or could they obtain the EMS by taking the Sharingan eyes of any Uchiha?    While researching, I found this:     Their vision can be restored by receiving the transplanted Mangekyō of   an Uchiha with strong blood ties — ideally a sibling — thus awakening   so-called Eternal Mangekyō Sharingan.   So my question is: what is considered ""strong blood ties""? Father, aunt, 2nd cousin twice removed?  Is there any other source that explains this in greater detail? "

2876,Why don't Evangelion Pilots need to pump the LCL out of their lungs after exiting an Eva Unit?,"I just started watching Evangelion on Netflix and the series explained that pilots' lungs become filled with LCL when in the entry plug of an Eva Unit, allowing them to breath and sync with their units.  However, it never shows or explained why they don't need to pump the LCL back out of their lungs upon exiting a unit. Is it just implied? Do their bodies absorb the LCL through their lungs? Is it assumed they just cough it up? Is there an explanation that I am missing?  Please Note: I haven't finished watching all of Neon Genesis Evangelion, so if this is a major spoiler please warn me via comments and/or use Spoiler Markup. "
2877,Can the Eternal Mangekyō Sharingan be obtained by implanting a normal Sharingan?,"As we know, there are only two who have achieved the Eternal Mangekyō Sharingan. Madara and Sasuke.  Madara  Madara and his brother both gained their MS from killing those closest to them. Madara then gained the EMS when he took Izuna's (his brother's) eyes, who had the MS.    Sasuke  Itachi gained his MS when he witnessed Shisui die. Sasuke gained his MS when he learned the truth about Itachi from Tobi. Sasuke then gained the EMS when he took Itachi's eyes.    Question  When Itachi was fighting Sasuke, he was saying how he wanted to take Sasuke's eyes so he could obtain the EMS. Sasuke did not have the MS at the time, so was Itachi lying, or are just ""blood tie"" Sharingan needed for the EMS? *Sidenote I personally don't believe Itachi would lie about this, because if he did and Sasuke found out, Sasuke would then be questioning Itachi's true motives.  Does anybody have any proof that you have to have the MS in order to awaken the EMS? "
2878,What series was Tomoko talking about?,"When talking about anime with Yuu-chan at ""SterTully's"" coffee shop, Tomoko says:       There's a lot of moeshit anime this season.   Slice-of-life anime is all they air these days, because of the new content restrictions.   There are some pretty interesting series, though! Like that EFB show...     This is what the subs from the version I saw said, the actual content may be slightly different.      Is Tomoko talking about any series that is actually coming out this season?

They are in an arid desert environment which appears to be the inside of an hourglass. Mayuri says that you could say that they are just one of many versions of themselves, but you could also say that they were the originals. Shortly before dissolving into sand, she says that their wills will carry on to the versions of themselves in Akihabara 70 million years in the future.  In the future, Okarin snaps out of a daze, like he does when he time leaps. Does that imply that Okarin remembers the incident? Was the incident symbolic? If this was one of Okarin's attempts to save Mayuri, why didn't it happen in the alpha/beta/gate timelines? "

I couldn't find a full version (if it even exists) and I'm starting to suspect that this actually is the fullest version, and it's called like that as a joke. Comments to youtube videos suggest the same, but I don't trust them.  Is there any official confirmation that this is indeed the whole track, or is there a longer version somewhere?  One of the many youtube videos: [website]"
2882,Does Garou have some important techniques of his own?,"We know that Garou was trained by Bang, and that he can use the Water Stream Rock Smashing Fist of this last, also we see him copying Tank Top Master and Watch Dog Man techniques and style. But how about his own techniques?  Does Garou have some important techniques of his own? "
2883,Why is Maid-chan voice actor listed as '???' in ending credits?,"In Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo ending credits Maid-chan's voice actor name is ""? ? ?"". Why is that?  "
2884,Were all fairies exterminated?,On episode 19 there are some flashbacks from King which imply that most of them got wiped out. However I'm still a bit unsure...  Is there a fairy realm? Are there any fairies still alive? 
2885,Why is Ryuunosuke Akasaka's hair so long?,"Why is Ryuunosuke Akasaka's hair so long? It makes him look like a girl. Is there some explanation to that in the series besides this being a possible consequence of being a hikkikomori?  Also, Maid-chan (the AI created by him) has a similar appearance. Ryuunosuke said that he wants to turn her into a real person (sentient AI?) one day. I suspect this may be related.  Also! Ryuunosuke has gynophobia (he's so afraid of females). This might also be the reason (in a way).   "
2886,Are all works of Seo Kouji set in the same world but in different timelines?,"Are all of Seo Kouji's manga related to one another/set in the same world? For instance, his manga Fuuka is related to Suzuka as Fuuka is Suzuka's daughter. Are the other manga related as well? "
2887,Do auras really have color and movement to them?,"Throughout Hunter x Hunter we see a variety of auras, with the majority of them differing based on color and the way that they move.   For example, Gon and Killua's are white and emit from their bodies fairly rapidly, similar to Saiyans from DBZ. But then if you consider Hasuka's and Killua's brother's auras, they're purple and kind of ooze. Lastly, there's also the chimera king's royal guard's aura which is red and really tentacle-like, and the chairman of the hunter association which is every color and radiates outwardly in all directions.   So, are these characteristics just for the audience to tell a difference, or do the characters also see these differing attributes? I know they can see auras, but do they see it the same way the audience does? "
2888,Ratio of key frames to in-between frames in anime,"In your average piece of animation, how many of the frames are key frames drawn by the animator, and how many are drawn by an inbetweener?  Even a small difference would have a huge impact; for example, having about a third of the frames be keys is a little over half the work for the animators compared to having half the frames be key frames, so this would obviously have a huge impact on budget, as fewer keys means you don't need as many key animators. I feel like a third or a fourth of frames being keys is probably average, but I haven't been able to find anything to support or debunk this hunch.  Anyone working in the anime industry, or familiar enough with it to give me a ballpark? "
2889,Is anything known about Saitama's family?,"I've watched season 1 and 2 of the anime, read part of the manga, read part of the webcomic and watched at least some OVAs (not sure they were all of them). I dont remember anything said or shown about Saitama's family. Is anything known about them? Also , aside of those sources, I know there are audiobooks, that there is an official encyclopedia, and that sometimes the author and the artist answer questions from the fans in an ""official"" way.   Is anything known about Saitama's family? "
2890,"Could Goku actually be an earth ""Prince""?","Ok so in the Dragon Ball/DBZ/DBGT/DB Super universe, everyone knows that Goku and Chi Chi are married and that Chi Chi is the daughter of the Ox King. That technically makes Chi Chi the Ox princess. But am I crazy or wouldn't that technically mean that by marrying the Ox princess Chi Chi, that Goku is unofficially the ""Ox Prince""? And what do you think Vegeta would do if he realized that Goku was also technically a saiyan ""prince"" (quote unquote)? "
2891,When did Kakashi and Obito awaken their Mangekyou Sharingan?,"In chapter 604 of the manga, it is shown that Kakashi kills Rin. This fulfills the requirement to activate the Mangekyou Sharingan. So that should have been the moment when Kakashi was able to use the Mangekyou Sharingan.   Also, the Yellow Flash was still alive when this happens, so this means that Naruto was not yet born. This clearly points to the fact that from the very beginning of the Naruto series, Kakashi had his Mangekyou Sharingan activated.   When Kakashi first fought Itachi (when Itachi and Kisame appear at Konoha) and faced the Tsukuyomi he was devastated in a moment, even though he had his Mangekyou Sharingan active (though not used). But the next time they face (during the rescue mission of Gara), he was able to withstand it.  Now my first question is, was Kakashi unaware of his Mangekyou Sharingan until he faced Itachi, or was he not proficient in using it. Also why in the Naruto series (I mean the series before the start of Shippuden) didn't Kakashi use his Mangekyou Sharingan?  Now for my second question, in the same chapter, a few pages back, just when Kakashi strikes the blow at Rin, Obito's vision starts to fade as he can sense Rin dying. Does this mean Obito's Mangekyou Sharingan was awakened at the same time? We know that Kakashi and Obito shares the same ""other dimension"" because of the same Sharingan that the both use (not the same eye, but the eye of the same Uchiha). So does the same apply for their activation of Mangekyou Sharingan? "
2892,What makes an object 0.5th generation?,"In the third arc (""The Ant and the Grasshopper""), the enemy object is described as being ""0.5th-generation"".   What does that even mean? I thought that the very first object to be built was itself already considered 1st-generation. Is a 0.5th-generation object some sort of subpar imitation or something? "
2893,"How Yami Bakura could summon ""The Winged Dragon of Ra"" without be in ""sphere mode"" and neither pronouncing the chanting?","I was watching this Yu-Gi-Oh! AMV about the duel between Yami Marik and Yami Bakura.  In the duel, Yami Bakura activates the spell card ""Dark Designator"" for declare a card in Yami Marik's deck and then use ""Exchange"" for get from Yami Marik's hand to Yami Bakura's hand.  In the 4:28 of the linked AMV video, Yami Bakura achieves summon The Winged Dragon of Ra, but I wonder:   Why Yami Bakura could summon ""The Winged Dragon of Ra"" without been in ""sphere mode""? - as happened when Mai Valentine summons him in previous episodes. Why Yami Bakura could summon ""The Winged Dragon of Ra"" without pronouncing the chanting? - as Yami Yugi/Atem did in next episodes?  "
2894,How do summoning jutsus work?,"Let's have a back drop on the story, the Third Hokage shows Jiraya, Tsunade, and Orochimaru his summoning technique. This intrigues Jiraya and he too tries to perform the jutsu without making a blood seal with an animal. As a result he is teleported to Mount Myoboku, where the Toads live. He trains there for some time.   Here lies my first question, until later into his training Jiraya had not made a blood seal with the toads, so how did he get to mount Myoboku to undergo his trainings? The reverse kuchiyose should only work when there is a blood seal with the animal. Going to Mount Myoboku on foot is a long and tiresome journey, so this possibility too is cancelled out. So, in order to go to Mound Myoboku did he use the kuchiyose no jutsu every time?   My other question is what decides which animal a shinobi is to bond with? There is a wide range of creatures that one can choose from, but certainly there must be some sort of compatibility to be worried about. What made Jiraya decide a toad summon would be best for Naruto?   Has anything that can substantiate the above points been mentioned in the manga? "
2895,Language of the elf-like people?,"This anime is still fairly new so I may be jumping the gun a bit, but in the episodes so far the people living in the world that the protagonist Toyohisa was transported to don't appear to speak Japanese.   Now my assumption may be off as I am not a fluent speaker, but as a third semester Japanese minor I usually can pick up on some words, phrases and contexts without looking at the subtitles.   When the elves speak there is a clear change in tone, pitch and pronunciation of words.  Are they speaking a different language entirely? Or just some sort of abbreviated form?  "
2896,What happened to Kirakishou in chapter 66 of Rozen Maiden Tales?,"    I just finished reading Tales (the second Rozen Maiden series), and I have a few questions.   Did Jun from unwound world became Kirakishou's master? How was she awakened? Is it because the wound world Jun appeared?  Regarding the dialogue on 24th page ""How do you do, Master? We meet again. And just for a while, I'll be going."", does it mean that she will return to adult Jun shortly after helping his childish form with the creation of the new rose, or that she will be staying in awakened form only during their adventure to recreate Shinku? If it is the latter, does it mean that she will fall asleep again, as they succeed in their journey and she will be returned to the unwound Jun, or she will still stay awaken, after being waken up once?  "
2897,Why do the Black Star Dragon Balls exist?," If Kami made the Black Star Dragon Balls, why didn't Dende have to recreate them like he did with the original ones? Why did Kami make the Black Star Dragon Balls in the first place? Namekians are supposed to be peaceful. Why weren't the Black Star Dragon Balls scattered? They were all together when Pilaf found them. (How did Pilaf get past Korin)  "
2898,Why Gowasu didn't foresee that Zamasu will turn rogue?,"If Gowasu can really travel to future at any point of time, why didn't he foresee Zamasu turning rogue in the first place?. He could have foreseen this even at the time of choosing Zamasu as his apprentice? "
2899,Why wasn't a Uchiha asked to control the Nine Tails during its attack?,"Madara or Tobi had controlled the Nine Tails to attack Konoha during Naruto's birth. But there were other Uchihas in the village such as Itachi's father. So, the village could have made use of them to defend the Nine Tails by controlling it using their sharingan. Why didn't they do that?  Another question: Why were the three sannin not seen during the Nine Tails attack? "
2900,Does Dororo meet Hyakkimaru again in the ending?,"At the end of the anime, Dororo grows up and becomes a beautiful girl, and she is running to Hyakkimaru, right?  Also, he is standing in a field. Which means, does Dororo and Hyakkimaru meet again? "
2901,What is the most popular demographic?,"I know that, in general, the higher-ranked manga tend to be shounen, such as One Piece, Bleach, and Naruto (based generally, I think, on readership). Is there anything showing general demographic popularity, such as the overall popularity of shounen vs. shoujo vs. seinen vs. josei, based on something like readership? If so, is shounen still the most popular? How do the other ones rank in relation to each other? "
2902,Sasuke's clan dream,"In volume 1 chapter 3: Hatake Kakashi, Kakashi asks Naruto, Sasuke, and Sakura what they like, dislike, what their dreams for the future are, and stuff like that. First it was Naruto, he talked about how he likes ramen, dislikes waiting for ramen to cook, and how he dreams to surpass all the previous Hokages, and even become one himself. Then there was Sasuke. He said he had a dream, or to better put it, an ambition. The resurrection of his clan. And to kill a ""certain man"",      which was Itachi, his older brother. But eventually he did kill him, and than he changed his goal... again.   My question is if restoring his clan is still his dream, or has he just forgotten all about it.  He only has one daughter with Sakura, and it seems that he is not planning on having anymore children since he is mostly out of the village on missions. So, did he forget about that dream or just realized that restoring a whole clan was almost impossible? Or did he just say that because he wanted revenge? "
2903,What's the deal with Yui?,"I've watched all the episodes on Crunchy Roll (SAO and ALO) and I think I missed something.  The character Yui acts as though she is the child of Asuna and Kirito.  I do not remember Yui in the SAO arc, but perhaps I missed it.  When did Asuna and Kirito have a child?  How did that child get special access to the system? "
2904,Why are they trying to pass out Sugar instead of beating her into a pulp?,"Sugar turned a lot of people into toys. Goal of the team Usolando is to turn those toys back into human beings. In the theory, if Sugar loses consciousness, the effect of the Hobby Fruit will lift off, and the toys will turn back being their original form. So, they prepared a super hot pill, disguised it as a grape, and trying to make Sugar eat it.  I don't understand this plot. They have never tried to poison, intoxicate or faint out by spices any of their foes any time. Why are they using this kind of attack particularly for Sugar? Why don't they just beat the ship out of her just like they have been doing to every enemy they have ever faced? "
2905,Is the city in which Fruits Basket is set ever identified?,"Fruits Basket appears to be set in a real Japanese city. Is it ever explicitly stated which one? If not, is it possible to deduce which one, or at least which part of Japan it's supposed to be?  (I'm more interested in the answer vis-a-vis the manga, but if there's a clue in the anime, that would be fine too.) "
2906,Why is Chi-Chi less of a a nag on Goten?,Re-watching Dragon Ball Z I have noticed that Chi-Chi's main goal in DBZ was to stop Gohan from training and force him to study instead. But once the Cell arc finishes and Goten is born. Chi-Chi doesn't treat him the same way.   It blew my mind that she even let him train at all but apparently through training with her Goten was able to transform into a super saiyan.   My question is why? Is it because Goku officially passed on so her character developed a bit? I never actually actuallly thought about it until now. 
2907,"Why is Monokuma's body half-black, half-white?","Monokuma's body is half-white, half-black.        Is there any reason for this? Does each half represent something? Furthermore, if each colour/half represents something, does the fact that his over-sized bellybutton is white and overlaps the black half mean that whatever the white part means prevails over whatever the black half means? "
2908,What exactly was Tatsuya afraid that Mizuki could discover with her sensitive eyes?,"When Tatsuya learns of Mizuki's sensitive eyes, he thinks to himself that he has to take care not to let her discover something about him.  Unmarked spoilers below.  What was it that she could discover with her ability?  Possible things:   The seal Miyuki placed on his abilities (since mantaining the seal uses up her magic processor, it is a kind of ongoing effect). His special abilities. Like she could sense his use of elemental sight. The fact he was not a born magician (his mother used a magic surgery to implant a processor in his brain). That she could catch him using flash casting  Something else?   Also, if the source material can be referenced (like the novels or something), all the better. "
2909,Manga where a daughter pays off her father's debt?,"I remember reading it a few months back, I have forgotten the name of it and some parts of it are quite fuzzy to me now. Can someone help. It has been on my mind for a while and I have been desperately trying to find it!    The manga was about a young high-schooler girl whose father was in debt. Her father basically leaves her to pay it off himself? Or something along the lines of that by working on a boat but something happens to his back as part of the plot in the manga. Then, she becomes a live-in housekeeper for a writer/author as she gets recommended to him by someone. She did so in order to help her father with the debt. She also tried getting a part-time job as a hostess/waitress at a place. However, she's supposedly underage but lies about her age. While she works she recognizes this boy whom she met and fought over some kind of food product/rice at the grocery store when they were younger. She finds out he is the son of the person who has hired her at the store. Unexpectedly, the author/writer comes in with the person who recommended her to him. The author/writer gets mad at her because she's underage and working there. He asks if the money he pays her is not enough. She begs the boy to not tell his mother that she is underage? There's also this part somewhere in the manga where her panties are stolen by a weird man and the author gets her panties back for her. I also think she realized she was developing feelings for this author/writer.   The manga is also currently on-going as far as I remember!  Thanks in advance xoxo :) &lt;3 "
2910,Why is it that almost every anime I watch is about School kids?,"Sure, there are a few exceptions, but very few. Every anime I watch is about School kids and/or usually takes place in a school. Why is that so? Is it about the general audience, or something else?  Edit: Oh yeah, also School Clubs. Schools and school clubs. Seriously.  Edit 2: I found this, I've already seen quite a few of the mentioned. I don't know if recommendations are allowed on this Stack site but I wanted to get your opinion in the comments.  "
2911,Why the Sword Ban?,"Why did Amanto ban the use of swords at all when they had already defeated the Samurai with swords? What threat do they have even if the Samurais have their swords since they are already stronger than them (Samurais)? If they allow wooden swords which are also destructive when used by the existing Samurais, then how would sword ban do any good? The anime only says 'sword ban' was enforced but no plausible explanation was given as to why. "
2912,"In chapter 507, what did Eileen mean when she said they are one and the same?","I know they are somehow related, but what does it mean when Eileen says she and Erza are one and the same? Is it like what? An Elodas version of Erza? So there would be 3 Erzas now? "
2913,Who was the Supporter of the Seleção in Eden of the East?,"It seems like this was never really addressed. This piqued my curiosity primarily because the supporter was stated by Mr. Outside to be one of the Seleção, and it seemed odd that one of the Seleção would willingly facilitate the game by enforcing its rules. Furthermore, the Supporter would have nothing to fear from breaking the rules of the game, so it would seem logical for him/her to pocket the money and do with it as he/she pleases. So that would seem to indicate that the Supporter is someone in league with Mr. Outside.  But who was the Supporter? All the evidence seems to indicate that it was Number XII, but can anyone confirm this? "
2914,How come Mokarin's mom is so good with guns?,"In multiple episodes of Sabagebu!, Mokarin's mom handles her gun exceptionally well and she's sort of badass too (Episode 7).    But how come? Was she part of her own Survival Club? Or, has she had some professional experience with guns? Was this ever revealed in the anime or manga?  Note: spoiler is acceptable. "
2915,What does Kanzaki Nao do?,"What's her occupation? It says student on the Liar Game wiki, but I don't think she had any occupation mentioned in the Liar Game drama. What is she studying? How does she have the time to do all this Liar Game stuff while she is studying/working? Sick leave? "
2916,Why do English dubs have a unique dialect?,"Something I noticed while watching a number of English dubs is that characters talk... the best way I can describe it is as a dialect. The scripts and voice acting are done by native (mostly American?) English speakers, but use odd vocabulary and turns of phrase that sound like part of its own dialect. It is difficult to describe, since it sounds nothing like any real English dialect I am familiar with.  For example, the English dub of Devilman on Netflix uses the word ""human"" (and at one point ""mortal"") instead of ""person"" or ""man"" in English sentences where those would be expected instead. The phrase ""go to hell, you mortals!"" comes across as distinctly stilted and unnatural to my ear (as a native General American English speaker).  Is this an actual phenomenon or am I imagining it? If it is real, why does it exist? "
2917,What is the gender of Armin in Shingeki no Kyojin?,"One of my friends read an article which claimed that Armin Arlert of Attack on Titan is female. Can anyone confirm or deny this?  This article included the following statement:     Q: Out of the group of female characters in the 104th Trainee Squad, who did Mikasa get along with the most?      A: Armin   This related article further states the following:     Isayama has revealed that Armin is a female character.  Now this is a huge surprise for Shingeki no Kyojin fans.  Everyone thought that Armin was always a boy but it looks like she was a girl.   Finally, here's another article discussing the possibility of Armin being female. "
2918,"What databases and listing sites exist for anime, manga, etc?","What are the major online databases of anime, manga, light novels, visual novels, and other related media? What are the differences between them?  To qualify as an answer, the source should list a large fraction of series in some particular medium, not just one or a few related series. The primary purpose of sites here should be indexing information about series. While it's acceptable to link to sites that do have some information related to e.g. fansubs, the primary purpose of all links in answers here should be indexing, not providing download links. Also, databases which are out-of-date should be removed.  Non-English sources are welcome so long as they qualify, but please specify what language in parentheses.     Note: This is intended to be the canonical reference for   questions like this to avoid lots of new questions coming in with   slightly different specifications. Please check the sites here to see   if any fit what you want before asking a new question. The answer is   CW, so feel free to add to it.  "
2919,Why are the protagonists generally seated by the window?,"I've noticed that in some anime the protagonist is seated by the window in the classroom. More specifically, the protagonist is generally on the second seat from the back (or sometimes on the very last seat). I don't know if this happens in every anime, but it seems to happen on at least some.        Top: Tomoko from Watamote (left), Touma from Index (right). Bottom: Light from Death Note (left), Tenma from School Rumble (right).  Why does this happen? Does it have something to do with character conception or mood setting? Is it a plot device or something else?  "
2920,Why does Levi wear Titan Pajamas?,  Does this have anything to do with the manga? Or is this just something that fans made up? Because I see so much people cosplaying as Levi in Titan Pajamas. 
2921,Do Bardock and King Vegeta make appearances in Otherworld?,"This is a two part question:   If Bardock and King Vegeta are dead, do they ever make appearances in HFIL or Upper World? One would think that either Goku or Vegeta would want to pay their fathers a visit.  Do Goku or Vegeta ever mention their fathers once during the entire anime?   I don't recall any of this. Feel free to include the manga if anyone has that much knowledge on the matter. "
2922,Differences in Yin Naruto and Yang Naruto?,"Initially, Naruto had Yang Kurama, said as the physical form or so. It gave him certain chakra and abilities.  Later in war he had Yin Kurama, the spiritual form, like genjutsu I believe. It must have given him some different abilities other than those given by the Sage of Six Paths. What are these?  And what were Naruto's post-Sasuke fight powers when he had both? "
2923,What was this cosplay where Maekawa had a donut in front of her chest?,Apparently this is supposed to be some kind of cosplay?  Which character is Maekawa trying to cosplay here?   
2924,Why do Androids in Dragon Ball Z sometimes use cars?,"There are a few Dragon Ball Z scenes in which Androids 16, 17 and 18 ride a truck despite the fact that they are capable of flight. It grants extra time to the heroes to recover (such as in Goku's case) and think about or prepare for what to do next, like exploring Cell's egg, or merging Picollo with Kami. To me, it seems both unreasonable and humorous at the same time.  Nevertheless, I don't understand the reason for why the producers/storywriters decided to do this. Is there any reason given for this strange choice? Could it be some kind of plot hole or plot device? "
2925,What does it mean when Kenshin says 'oro'?,Throughout the series Kenshin has added 'oro' somewhat comedically to his sentences. Is there any actual meaning to this or is this just a speech style/pattern that he has?  In episode 62 he says it several times in a row and Kaoru points this out.  
2926,What is the power of the seventh Witch?,"What exactly is her power?   Why did Miyamura's sister, Yamada, and the president not get affected by her memory erase?   I understand that perhaps she couldn't erase Yamada's memories, but then how did the other evade the memory erase? "
2927,What are OVAs and how are they different from Specials?,"I often see that a lot of Anime series have a few extra episodes. Some are explicitly labeled as Specials, others labeled as OVAs. I get Specials, but I don't quite understand the term OVAs.  I googled, and found this: What is the difference between an OVA and an OAV?, but all I understood from it is that:     OVA/OAV stands for Original Video Animation   Now that doesn't explain much, does it? So my question is, how is it different from other extra episodes (Specials)? Are they the same thing and the producers use the terms interchangeably or something else? "
2928,Can Shizuku's vacuum cleaner suck nuclear weapons?,"Can Shizuku, who is the 8th member of the Phantom Troupe use her Nen ability to absorb a detonated or/and a non-detonated nuclear weapon?  Can it suck the radiation caused by such weapons? "
2929,What happened with Akane in the manga? Did something like this happen in the novel?,"I've just read the tenth chapter of manga, Kämpfer (got it before I got 9 and 8). I'm a bit confused by the ending there and wikipedia didn't help much there.  I'm putting up spoiler tags as the important parts of the question below are directly related to the endings of the manga / novel:  Manga:      After destroying the statue, Akane suddenly disappeared. Why did that happen (I found the bit explanation before quite confusing but it sounded so as if Akane was created by the moderator?)?   Novels:      Additionally this gets to the second part of my question. Is there something similar there in the novels? As from what I remember, he got together with Akane there. So is it different there for her to whatever happens to her in the manga?  "
2930,What was Nezu stuffing into his briefcase?,"In the film, after burning loads of documents with his aides, a tank barrels into his estate and Nezu (over)stuffs a briefcase with papers before fleeing.  What were these papers? They did not appear to be money, and if they were documents that needed to be destroyed, why would he have taken them with him? "
2931,What might be the real life inspiration of Oda behind writing One Piece?,What might be the real life inspiration of Oda behind writing One Piece? Does anyone has an idea about Oda's inspiration of writing One Piece? 
2932,What are the differences between the Akame Ga Kill! manga and anime?,"First of all, why was the anime completed before the manga? As far as I am aware, the anime is ahead of the latest manga chapters by a large margin.  I've heard that the anime actually differs from the manga; does this mean we might get a remake like Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood for Fullmetal Alchemist?  Furthermore, will the manga continue on with Akame's story? Will it explain some of the plot holes that were left unanswered in the anime? "
2933,What will happen to the tailed beast if the jinchuruki is killed?,"It is shown in the anime that the jinchuruki is caught and the tailed beast is extracted and sealed into the Demonic statue by the Akatsuki. What will happen if the jinchuruki is killed somewhere else? In search for Tsunade arc, during the fight between Jiraiya-Tsunade and Orochimaru, Orochimaru tries to kill Naruto as he is the jinchuruki of the nine tails. What would have happened to the nine tails if he had killed Naruto? "
2934,"What does Ikumi mean by ""Sand that looks like it's from Koshien""?","In the anime Jinsei - Episode 2, a boy asks them advice on what to give his friend as a Birthday present that doesn't come off as cheap.  Ikumi gives this advice:    I googled Koshien and all I was able to figure out was that it's a Baseball stadium built for High School tournaments. Does this mean that Koshien is a very important place in Japan? But even if that is so, why sand?  I hope someone can explain this to me. Thanks! "
2935,Why did Hiruzen Sarutobi become the third Hokage again?,"Hiruzen Sarutobi is the third Hokage, while Minato is the fourth Hokage.  After the death of Minato, Hiruzen becomes Hokage again and he is still called the third.  But why still the third? Why isn't Hiruzen called the fifth then? And why didn't they choose a new candidate as new Hokage? "
2936,Why weren't the four Hokages reincarnated by Kabuto in the Shinobi war?,"In the anime, Kabuto reincarnated Asuma, Dan, Hizashi etc from Konoha to battle against the allied Shinobi forces. Earlier, Orochimaru reincarnated the 1st and 2nd Hokage to battle against the 3rd. Why didn't Kabuto reincarnate the four of them to fight against the alliance? Couldn't they be reincarnated again or wasn't that part of Tobi's plan? "
2937,Why are reading fairy tales so lewd?,"In Chapter 2, when Eto is wondering what she could do for Iono-sama (seeing how everyone has unique skills that served her and she didn't have anything), Iono-sama suggests reading fairy tales to her at night, which prompts Arge to call Iono-sama a Horny Queen.  Now at first I would have thought it was the suggestion of Eto being with Iono-sama at night which the explicit nature of the suggestion, but Eto asks Arge if ""fairy tales"" has that sort of meaning.    Later when Eto and Aida are talking, Aida mentions reading fairy tales to Iono-sama and Eto gets all flustered and says she looked it up suggesting that it's not the fact that it's at night but that Eto would be reading fairy tales which makes it lewd.    After reading the liner notes of Maria Watches Over Us some time ago, I know that some humor in Japanese language comes from puns on how words look very similar but have vastly different meanings only because of one character of the placing of a space.  So I am wondering, why is fairy tales so lewd? Is this some sorta of Japanese language pun? "
2938,Why are the 'things' that are created from human transmutation so randomly generated?,"This has been bugging me for a while but why are the 'things' that are created from human transmutation (Which has been stated is impossible) so randomly generated.  Ed and Al set out to transmute their dead mother but turns out to create some weird thing which was later identified to be some random male with black hair.    If anything why doesn't the end result of the transmutation be something more similar to what they initially wanted to revive? Why male not female? Why black hair not brown hair?  Additionally, what are they actually, other than failed outcomes of human transmutation? "
2939,Did Hana Hana no Mi give the user superhuman strength?,"Hana Hana no Mi is eaten by Nico Robin, as we know that she can grow parts of her body. She usually grow her hands to attack, or to defend her. She also can swing or lift her or other people with her growing hands. She can easily break the bones of her opponents, just like when she used clutch or twist.  I know that if her body parts are hurts, she also feels the pain. But is that mean when she used clutch or twist, she used her ""normal"" human strength? Because she doesn't seems no trouble when do that to her opponents. Or it's because the Hana Hana no Mi that also give her superhuman strength? "
2940,What's the design on their aprons?,"On the aprons (at least I think they're aprons) of the people that work on the Horse's Bone, a weird design can be seen:    Is this supposed to be a (weird) horse or something like that, which alludes to the shop's name? Or is it something else? "
2941,Why are cherry blossom so prevalent in anime?,"A lot of anime I have seen use cherry blossoms, especially when they fall from the sky. Romantic or emotional scenes have cherry blossom in the background. In many anime, there is a childhood scene in which friends see cherry blossoms falling and remember that day forever or they meet their love when the blossoms are falling.  Why is it always cherry blossoms? Does it have a special significance in Japanese culture? "
2942,Why is the title written differently in kana and romaji?,"Watching the anime titled Ao Haru Ride (AniDB link), I noticed that the title screen displays the title in kana but it is given as アオハライド or Ao Ha Raido, Ao Ha Ride; entirely missing a kana ル for ru  I noticed that this is already present in what seems to be the Japanese manga cover I found on Google images:    The title in kana reads Ao Ha Raido while the title in romaji reads Ao Haru Ride. Why this discrepancy? "
2943,Does Saitama still continue his training?,"Saitama mentioned that he got this strong through daily training, which consisted of 100 push-ups, 100 sit-ups and 100 squats along with running 10 km every single day. Also, he ate three meals a day, but only a banana as breakfast and also didn't use the AC, to strengthen his mental resistance.   Has he stopped his training and accepted his current power level as sufficient? Or does he still train using his methodology? (I've read till Vol 6, Chapter 32 and haven't found anything about his current training status) "
2944,What exactly is happening during the opening titles of “Crusher Joe: The Movie” (1983),"What exactly is happening during the opening titles of Crusher Joe: The Movie (1983)?  I am not talking about the pre-credits chase, but rather the action that happens right during the opening credits where the Crushers seem to be swooping in on an asteroid/starbase combo, burst through some airlocks and then send—what appears to be—a malfunctioning/failing part of the asteroid into space where it explodes.  Based on what is shown, I am assume that the thing exploding was some reactor connected to the starbase, but I am not clear about the action past what we see on screen. Was this an event straight out of one of the original Haruka Takachiho’s novels?  Screenshot below of the scene in question with the Crusher ships—Minerva and those other ships Alvin and Crusher Joe pilot—flying towards the hunk of rock in space.   "
2945,Which clockwisality should the swastika be in Bleach-related contexts?,"In the context of Bleach, which clockwisality should the swastika have?  Should it be ""卍解"", or ""卐解""? Or are both valid? Doing a google image search for both of them gets Bleach-related hits. "
2946,What is this song from Naruto song sung in Korean?,"I watched this show and they're singing the Korean version of an OST, and although it's familiar, I can't recognize it. Seems like it's from Naruto though.  Can anyone remember the title of this song? "
2947,Why do characters often pull down one eyelid and stick out their tongue?,"I see characters making this motion frequently in anime.  They pull one (or sometimes both) eyelid down, and stick out their tongue.  What does that mean?  Where does the gesture originate and what's the history behind it?      "
2948,Which end of a chocolate cornet is the head?,"  Some say it looks like a seashell.  Some say it looks like a caterpillar.  The real question, which end is the head?  Was it ever decided among the cast of Lucky Star? "
2949,"What is the so-called ""GUDAGUDA ship"" involving Oda Nobunaga and Okita Souji?","I was reading this piece of short comic remake titled ""How you play it"" illustrated by Kawacy and it says     Oda Nobunaga and Okita Souji from Fate/Grand Order      a.k.a the GUDAGUDA ship.   So I search about it, it seems like an event from Fate/Grand Order called GUDAGUDA Honnouji Event. From here, I know gudaguda (ぐだぐだ) mean exhausted; tired. But the event summery says     Something like a ""GUDAGUDA Honnouji"" suddenly appeared in Chaldea, and Oda Nobunaga is ready for action!   which suggests it's an object rather than a state  So what is GUDAGUDA exactly in relation to Fate/GO? And why did the Oda Nobunaga and Okita Souji pairing get called GUDAGUDA ship? I tried to Google GUDAGUDA ship and I got lot of Oda Nobunaga and Okita Souji pairing so it's not something only from Kawacy above    Note: I have zero knowledge of Japanese language and I never play Fate/GO "
2950,Why is the Monokuma's eye in the school crest?,"Hope's Peak Academy's crest looks like this:    In the center is a fountain pen and what looks to be a Monokuma's eye:    But the school was established before Monokumas were created if I'm not mistaken.     Before any of the games take place, Hope's Peak was a small-scale facility that survived on a government subsidiary and graduate donations. However, the research was often blocked by a lack of resources. The school's steering committee was not satisfied with this, so they instituted the preparatory school system in order to bring in more money. (Ref)   Why then is the Monokuma's eye in the logo? Or were the Monokuma designed to have the eye because of the logo? "
2951,How come Donyatsu can stand in the rain?,"In chapter 3, Donyatsu gets attacked by the Machumaro, and they take a bit from his back:     With this, we know that (at least) a superficial layer of his body is composed of some kind of pastry, which is even edible.  We also know that Donyatsu needs to eat, which means he somehow has a digestive system.  In chapter 13, however, Donyatsu is seen standing in the rain:        How can he stand in the rain and not melt (he has a sugar coating) or get soaked (since he's made of pastry)?  Furthermore, how exactly does his body (and of the bodies of the rest of his gang) really work, physiologically? "
2952,How did Araragi Koyomi lose his vampire powers in the Monogatari Series?,"Spoilers on Kizumonogatari below:  In Kizumonogatari, Oshino Meme says there is a way to keep Shinobu alive that would also stop her from eating humans. He says Araragi must almost kill Shinobu to do so, which turns her into a quasi vampire being. From what I understand that is how Shinobu lost most of her powers.  However, how did Araragi lost his vampire powers? He had just sucked Shinobu's blood a little earlier which made him more powerful and I don't see how almost killing Shinobu would make him lose his powers.   Also, why did Araragi stop wanting to eat humans? "
2953,"Is ""Ray"" a sidestory of ""Black Jack""?","The TV series Ray is about a woman with ""X-Ray vision"" who was saved by a doctor when she was young. In the first episode of the anime, this doctor is made out to look like Black Jack:    Although you never get a look at his face but you can see that there is some stitches on the doctor's face and his hair is black and white.  Is this cameo just a bit of ""fan service""/homage to the old Black Jack series or is this more like a same-universe side-story or spin-off of Black Jack? It doesn't seem like the staff of this show has worked on any of the Black Jack manga or anime. "
2954,Whose eyes did Uchiha Madara use during the ninja war?,I knew that Madara possesses the eyes of his brother to obtain Eternal Mangekyō Sharingan but is he still using those eyes during the Fourth Ninja World War? Or has he implanted different eyes? 
2955,Will Prism Nana be an actual anime?,"Last I knew, all the PVs were for a Pachinko game. Will SHAFT actually turn it into an anime? If so, does anyone know when are they planning to release it? "
2956,What happened to the Death Note?,"I realize that they (Near and the police) probably hid it somewhere, but after Light dies, would yet another Kira appear? Or would Ryuk take it back? I'm assuming the latter, but when Light dies, Near has the book. Light merely has his scrap paper in his watch. If Near still has it, would it just disappear? Or would Near become the owner? "
2957,Which owl is the source of Arima's quinque?,Considering the confusion between the 2 owls (Yoshimura vs Eto) do we know which one Arima took this quinque from? Has he fought both? I'm not sure if a Tokyo Ghoul: re tag is worthwhile.   
2958,"Is there any connection between ""Whispers of the heart"" and ""The cat returns""?","Recently I watched ""Whisper of the Heart (Mimi o Sumaseba)""1 and ""The cat returns (Neko no Ongaeshi)""2 and I notice that:   The main protagonists found a old store (by being ""guided"" by a big cat) - Muta in the first one and Moon in the latter movie. The main protagonist find a cat statuette in the old store (both refered as The Baron). Both protagonists feel attracted to the cat statue by his beautifulness and misterious charming - my own words here.   Is there a connection between ""Whisper of the Heart"" and ""The cat returns""?    1 Also know as Susurros del corazón ""spanish title"".  2 Also know as Haru en el reino de los gatos - ""spanish title"". "
2959,Straw Hat Luffy gonna destroy the Fishman Island?,"During the Fishman Island Arc, Madam Shyarly's in Coral hill predicted that a man with a straw hat is destined to destroy the Fishman Island.  They say Madam Shyarly's prediction never failed. I can't  think of any other besides Luffy that is wearing that hat.  How can Luffy possibly do it? Because in the first place, he saved that island and he's not that kind of guy who will do such a thing. Also, Fishman island lies right underneath the Red Line and Mariejois. So destroying Fishman island means destroying the capital of World Government, Mariejois.  Questions:   How can Luffy possibly do it? (if he is the destined one because it lies beneath Mariejois and Red Line) Could this be another straw hat guy? or her prediction is just wrong?  "
2960,What particular advantage was there on making Guilford think that Lelouch is Cornelia?,"I haven't read the manga. In Code Geass R2, Lelouch orders Guilford to think that Lelouch is Cornelia upon taking a specific pose. It would seem like he did this just as a precaution before meeting with Suzaku.  But, why not just order him to protect Lelouch when he takes such pose? What particular advantage is there on making him think Lelouch is Cornelia? "
2961,"In Sword Art Online, is Kazuto (Kirito) Suguha's cousin, or is he adopted from unrelated parents?","It's mentioned multiple times that Kazuto is Suguha's cousin, not her brother. However, the key conversation in question seems to imply that the explanation was made up on the spot. To me, it seemed as though that was best alternative Kazuto's mom could come up when Kazuto confronted her unexpectedly; in reality he's really adopted from unknown parents. I couldn't find a good clip of it, so here's the clip in a reaction video, which is close enough:  [website]Earlier in s1 ep15 Suguha mentions that she and Kazuto look nothing alike. To me, that was included to specifically suggest that they're unrelated.   Admittedly I'm relying on the english dubbed version and I've never read the Manga, so I was hoping there was more in the original sources.  "
2962,"""Full-time Employment is a Loophole in the Law to Make Wages Lower""?","In Episode 10, which itself is called ""Full-time Employment is a Loophole in the Law to Make Wages Lower…"" or 「正社員ってお給料を安くするための法の抜け穴...」 「Seishain tte Okyūryō o Yasukusuru Tame no Hō no Nukeana 」 (essentially taken from the dialogue)…  When referring to why Nene can't work as a playtester on weekends, they discuss:     Aoba: Why can't part-timers work on the weekends?   Kou: Oh, it depends on the company, but they're paid by the hour, so if they worked overtime and weekends, they'd get paid more than you, Aoba.   Aoba: W-Wait a minute! Is being a full-time employee just a loophole to make wages lower?   Kou: We can talk about that some other time.     What is this referring to? Is this something that also applies to the western world or some kind of business law in Japan? "
2963,Dying with a SMILE,"In the One-Piece manga and anime they showed that when a devil-fruit user dies, his ability leaves his body, and materialises in a nearby fruit (like how Smiley's axolotl or and Ace's flare-flare ability became a new fruit).  But what happens if you dye with a SMILE in your body? Does that become a proper devil fruit, a new SMILE fruit or it never becomes a new fruit? "
2964,"Is the ""wakakusa"" ad a references to something?","In episode 4, there is an ad for ""強力わかくさ"" or ""strong green/fresh grass.""    Is this a reference/parody to something (out-of series reference), like the ""Dogs Playing Pool"" in the background of episode 3 at the pool hall? If so, to what? "
2965,Why SSB Goku can face SSJ3 Cumber now?,"Before, not even SSB Vegito Kaioken x20 could face base Cumber. But now, SSB Goku can face a SSJ3 Cumber, a transformed Cumber 800 times stronger than base Cumber. What does this suppose to mean? Did Goku increase his power a lot with training or is Cumber weak for fighting other fighters or something? "
2966,"Do Bang, Bomb and Genos know who killed Elder Centipede?","I'm assuming that the Hero Association thought it was King and not Saitama who killed Elder Centipede, otherwise they would have likely promoted him. But how about Bang, Bomb and Genos who were there? Do they know who killed Elder Centipede or couldn't they tell as Elder Centipede was charging against King and in a flash Saitama killed him? "
2967,What do the half ghouls in CCG eat?,How does CCG keep ghouls alive for so long in their prisons when they can only eat humans? The same goes for half ghouls in CCG. What do they eat? 
2968,Why was Yamakan replaced by Takemoto as director of Lucky Star?,"When Lucky Star began airing, the show's director was Yamamoto Yutaka (""Yamakan"", as he is often referred to). However, after 4 episodes, he was taken off the project and replaced by Takemoto Yasuhiro (one of Kyoto Animation's longer-time directors), who went on to direct the remainder of the show.  What happened? This is the only time in KyoAni's history (since they started being a main production studio in 2003, anyway) that a show's director has been changed midway. Kind of weird, huh?  I'm aware of the general belief - that Yamakan's direction of the first four episodes was so bad that they had no choice but to get rid of him - but I'm looking for specifics, preferably from the mouths of the people involved.  "
2969,How can I easily find all languages a show has been dubbed into?,"I usually only watch anime with the original Japanese voice actors, since I've had bad experiences with dubs in the past. However, I'm sometimes interested in watching a show dubbed in something that isn't Japanese, and moreover, I want to know if there are any alternatives to English dubs.  Is there any site that will let me see all languages a show has been dubbed into efficiently?   MyAnimeList gives the voice actors in various languages for characters. However, this information is often incomplete. For instance, I just looked at the page for Nagisa Misumi of Pretty Cure and noticed that no Cantonese voice actress is listed, even though a Cantonese dub exists. A Wikipedia article in some language foo for a show will sometimes list any voice actors for the dub in foo in addition to the Japanese voice actors. Information about dubs in other languages is generally lacking. This would mean that I would have to check (and be able to read) each Wikipedia page in each potentially interesting language. Moreover, I would have to carefully check shows one at a time, which is not convenient. Similarly, wikis for a series sometimes contain information about dubs (e.g. a Sailor Moon wiki I found). As a general rule however, this is not the case. For instance, a Cantonese dub for Revolutionary Girl Utena exists, but there is no mention of it in a fan-made wiki.   In the case of Cantonese (or even Mandarin), I can usually ""guess"" that older, more prominent shows will have a dub. However, I find it difficult to do the same for other languages that I might be interested in (e.g. German), and at any rate, it'd be nice to not have to rely on my guesswork. "
2970,"Isn't Sunshine ""THE ONE"" mode not strong enough to fight The Demon King?","So chapter 317 already release and there is a conversation between Escanor and Mael.          I was shocked that Mael say that he cannot defeat the Demon King. But isn't Sunshine still have the ultimate mode called ""The ONE""? If I recall, when it reach high noon, the holder of Sunshine can use ""THE ONE"" mode, which is ""the invincible incarnation of power"" based on Merlin.   So why Mael seems like have no confident to fight the Demon King? Can't he use that mode to fight the Demon King? "
2971,Why hide Naruto's identity?,What harm would come if Naruto was told the fact about his lineage? Why didn't they just hide the fact that Naruto was a Jinchuuriki to save him from the outcast treatment from the villagers during his childhood? 
2972,What does Tanaka do?,"What exactly is Tanaka's function in the Phantomhive family? To my understanding from watching season 1 and 2 of the anime, the manga (up to the Phantomhive murders arc) and the OVAs, it seems like he was Vincent's head butler back when he was the head of the house.  But since Ciel has come into power along with Sebastian, his function seems small. In the anime and manga when Sebastian assigns tasks, he always tells Tanaka ""The usual will be fine"". What does this mean? Can anyone explain? "
2973,What are the exact abilities of the Rinnegan?,"Like my question is asking, what are the exact abilities of the Rinnegan?  I only know that Rinnegan users can bring the dead back to life, absorb chakra, extracted people's souls while also reading their minds, summon people and animals, and sharing vision with the Six Paths of Pain.  Of course I know there are more abilities the Rinnegan grants, but I don't know them. Would you please answer with as much detail as possible? "
2974,Are people from Shandia originally from Sky Island?,"I've just rewatched the Skypiea arc, and I realised that 400 years ago, before Jaya Island is blown up by Knocked-Up Stream, people from Shandia have wings.  People living in Sky Island also have wings, or it's more like people with wings are from Sky Island. Like people in Skypiea, Enel's crew from Birka.     Urouge also has wings and he's also from an unnamed Sky Island. As we can see, he talks to Kaido before he jumps from Sky Island.   Then, why do people in Shandia also have wings, even before they blew up? Are they originally from another Sky Island? "
2975,Why did the Leaf Village invite the Village Hidden by Sound for the Chunin exams?,"I am currently watching Naruto Shippuden and just watched the episode where in the past,       Orochimaru said to Kabuto that he is going to create the Village Hidden by Sound.   My question is, if the people from Konoha (Hidden Leaf Village) know that      the Sound Village is Orochimaru's village,   then why did they invite ninjas from the Sound to compete in the Chunin exams? Was it not common knowledge that       Sound Village was Orochimaru's village?   If this will be answered further in the Shippuden then I will watch it, but I don't see why it would be.  "
2976,Are Yusuke and Jin half brothers?,"I recently finished watching Yu Yu Hakusho and in that there was a fight between Jin and one of Yusuke's fathers friends, where the opponent said that ""I had a chance to fight with your father the thunder god!"" and then goes to a flashback where they show him fighting with a guy looking just like his father  I then did some searching around in the internet and when I search for ""Thunder god Yu Yu Hakusho"" I still get Yusuke's dad, so is Raizen the thunder god? then does that mean Yusuke and Jin are half brothers??? can anyone help me get clarity on this? thanks in advance! "
2977,Where did Cecianiah Corabelle come from?,"The actual name of C.C. or C2 has been a topic on the net because no one besides the author knows it. But for some reason the names ""Elizabeth"" and ""Cecaniah Corabelle"" pops up. Now the question is, why Cecaniah Corabelle?   I can understand why ""Elizabeth"" might be suggested; it was a common name at the time and place in Europe where C.C lived.  But ""Cecaniah"" is a rather unusual name and I couldn't find it anywhere. So why would she be named Cecaniah Corabelle? Is there anything suggesting such a name?  Where did this theory begin? "
2978,Why could Goten and Gohan not resist the Baby controlling them while Trunks was able to?,"In this episode, it seems like Goten is weakened before being taken over by Baby but was Trunks not in the similar condition ie weekend, in this episode, yet he was able to resist and succeeded to stop Baby taking over him. Why couldn't Goten do the same? Gohan on the other side wasn't hurt a bit; how could he be taken over so easily? "
2979,What is the other Carillon broken at the background?,"I noticed that the wikipedia page for Shuumatsu Nani Shitemasu ka? Isogashii desu ka? Sukutte Moratte Ii desu ka? / SukaSuka / WorldEnd is simply inaccurate. It states that Willem Kmetsch (Willem Kumesh in FgilanTranslation) wields Senioris and Insania. However the statement does conflict with the following facts in the Novel:   Volume 4 Chapter 4: It is stated that Willem specifically only capable of activating mass produced Carillons/Dug Weapons. He wields Lapidemsibilus temporarily on the novel. Specifically at Volume 4. Willem never wields Senioris / Seniolis in his active day as Quasi-Brave.       He does wield Senioris at the end of Volume 5 of the novel - albeit also temporarily.  It is shown in the anime that he wields Percival and another Carillon / Dug Weapon. As shown on the scene below showing Willem in the aftermath of fighting against Eboncandle:     My question is, what is the other Carillon broken at the background of the scene above? I can't remember the name of that sword and where it was stated in the novel. "
2980,Are there other nations in AOT?,They've mentioned this before but I'm confused now because Marley says that they need to be more advanced than the other nations. So are there other countries out there with like modern tech? And would those be countries in our world?  
2981,Did Orichimaru use the real bodies of the First and Second Hokage against the Third on the rooftop?,"I just wanna know if it was the real bodies, if so, wouldn’t they be like skeletons?? "
2982,Is there nudity in any of the Mobile Suit Gundam series?,"I heard somewhere that there is some nudity in some of the Mobile Suit Gundam series, is this true?  And if so, which ones have it and how sexual is it?  I want to watch the shows with my little brother and I just want to make sure there's nothing like that in it before we start it. "
2983,How did Heathcliff manipulate Kirito and Asuna back to the battlefield?,"Did Heathcliff use Yui (which was possible because he was Kayaba after all) or did he rely entirely on asking them for help with the final boss raid?     In episode 1x11, Asuna and Kirito ask for a leave of absence from the Knights of the Blood Oath. Surprisingly Heathcliff agrees. He then says, ""I'm positive you won't stay away from the battlefield for long."" This clearly foreshadows he'll manipulate them into coming back.   How did he do so? "
2984,What song is playing in DBS episode 130 at 4:22? (UI Goku vs Jiren),"I've been searching for that legendary guitar rift for a while now and can't seem to find it in any OST.  (starts at exactly 4:22 in ep 130)  I used Shazam, it kinda worked but not really. The result I got was:  [website]which is the music but it's a different version with singing, while the version used on the show had no singing. &lt; that's the one I'm looking for "
2985,Why Kaidou cant die?,"In his appearances of manga , kaidou is shown to jump down from sorajima and still live. The mystery still remains that he doesnt die even after doing this?  why is this so ? Mythical fruit users don't die, is it the case ?     Is he similarto charlotte linlin who also doesnt die even after suffering from many things ? "
2986,Why would Mori Summer use the same incantation as Tyrant Eye?,"In episode 4 of Chuunibyou demo koi ga shitai, when Mori Summer was fighting Mjolnir Hammer for the possession of Mabinogion, Mori Summer used the incantation,      Reality, be rent! （はぜろレアル！）   Synapse, break! （はじけろシナプス！）   Vanishment, this world! （バニシュメントティスワルド！）   This is the same incantation as what Tyrant Eye uses to transform (henshin). Mjolnir Hammer and Dark Flame Master also uses the same incantation. If I remember correctly, Sophia Ring SP Saturn VII also uses the same incantation. This is understandable since Sophia Ring SP Saturn VII was friends with Dark Flame Master and went to the same school if I remember correctly. Tyrant Eye came into existence due to Dark Flame Master. Mjolnir Hammer is servant to Tyrant Eye. So them sharing the same incantation is perfectly understandable.   However, Mori Summer who went to a different school and has no connection whatsoever with them, except Mjolnir Hammer, was using the same incantation. Why is that? Is there an in universe explanation why Mori Summer is using the same henshin incantation despite coming from a different branch of chuunibyou-ism?  "
2987,Check and circle marks in test papers,"While watching anime, especially ones that focus on slice-of-life or high school, I often come across a test paper containing a character's score. However, it is interesting to note that the correct answers are circled while the wrong ones are ticked (checked?). As far as I know, ticks are for correct answers and circles are for incorrect answers (unless I've been living in a shell, which would be embarrassing).    The image is from The World God Only Knows OVA: Four Girls and an Idol, where Keima Katsuragi intentionally placed an incorrect answer for question #1. As you can see, it is checked while the rest are circled. Does this mirror how Japan marks the test papers of students? If so, why? "
2988,Are “The Dirty Pair” actually a part of the “Crusher Joe” universe? Or are they just a film parody in that universe?,"The worlds of The Dirty Pair and Crusher Joe seem to overlap. But it's never been clear to me if the The Dirty Pair (aka: ""Lovely Angels"") were actually a part of the Crusher Joe universe or were they just a parody entertainment film in the Crusher Joe universe?  For example, in this clip in the film Crusher Joe (1983), the team is clearly watching a film of the The Dirty Pair. Is this all just a layer of meta-reference? "
2989,Why aren't Japanese animation studios switching to digital art for production instead of pencil and paper?,"In the introduction paragraphs of Visiting Studio Colorido: Up-and-Coming Digital Animation Studio by Naoya Koji posted in October 2015,     [...]      Today, many of Japanese animation studios rely on “papers and pencils” to produce anime. Although some parts have been updated, this is the traditional Japanese style of the animation production which has been handed down for decades.      The world is now in the age of the internet and the digital tools. The animation studios innovate those new cultures, but Japanese studios remain in the world of “paper and pencil.” [...]   Even today, Japanese animation studios still use pencil and paper to produce animation.  Why can't they switch from that method and proceed to digital hand drawing for animation production since it is much less time-consuming? Why can't anime studios use graphic tablets (e.g. Wacom) to draw and animate instead of using pencils, papers, and eraser because it's maybe outdated and obsolete? "
2990,Do real-life schools have maid cafes at their school festivals?,"In anime and manga where the setting is a school, there often is a school festival event. In such events, many would feature the students running a maid cafe - for example, Hanasaku Iroha.  Does this also often happen in real life? Do students in Japan also make maid cafes for their school festivals? "
2991,What are the effects of forging a contract with a dragoon?,"I don't know if it has ever been mentioned in the anime (or maybe I just don't remember), but what exactly happens if you forge a contract with a dragoon? I've tried searching it in google and  had no luck using the title as the parameters. The wikia doesn't say much about it, only that it requires an exchange of flesh to be formed.   Nearing the end of the second season, Toru finally forged the contract with Fredirika, and we can see regenerative abilities but not much else. What advantages and disadvantages are there in forging a contract with a dragoon? Considering how long Toru delayed it, there must be a reason why he chose to do it at the last minute. This may be explained in detail in the LN which I haven't read. "
2992,What are the difference between Koro-sensei and other tentacle creatures?,"Koro-sensei and tentacle-having humans (e.g. Itona) have a drastic difference in their bodies: Koro-sensei's body is made up of tentacles wholly, whereas Itona has his human body along with a tentacle.  Are there any differences between the no. of the tentacle cells infused? If yes, it's a fact that even a single tentacle cell can cause death like pain, then how did Koro-sensei survive that much pain?  "

2994,How Did Krillin Get Stronger After Potential Unlock in DBZ?,"In Dragon Ball Z ep.54, (this is during the Namek Saga), the Elder Guru unlocks  Krillin's sleeping potential, and so Krillin reaches his full potential, at a power level of 14,000. By the time Krillin fights Goku who was being possessed by Captain Ginyu (ep.71 I believe), he has a power level of 22,000, and by the time the Z fighters fight Android 18 (ep. 135 I believe), Krillin has a power level of 450,000!  If Krillin's true potential was really unlocked way back in the Namek Saga, then how could it have risen, wouldn't that mean that his true potential wasn't really unlocked? His power should have either been as high as it became at the start, or it shouldn't have been able to rise. Is there an in-universe explanation for this? "

2996,language consistency in anime credits,"The languages used in displaying anime credits varies from series to series. The second season of Big Windup brought my thoughts on this issue to a head. It is Japanese dub with English sub. The credits during the opening are in Japanese, while the credits in the ending are fully in English. From my experience, this is rare. Subs tend to credit in either the subbed language or Japanese plus other languages.  The latter appears to be the most common choice, at least nowadays.  In this case credits tend to be given in the language of the person or company being credited. Japanese nationals will be credited in Japanese, Korean folks in Korean, Filipinos (and other countries using Latin alphabet) in English, etc. I'm not sure about Chinese folks, because I haven't learned to tell the difference between Chinese, and Japanese with a lot of kanji. If a Thai graphics studio worked on the CGI, their credits might well be given in Thai. Anyway, frequently one sees multiple languages on one page of credits.  Is there a style for giving credits that is developing over time, or are they portrayed however the individual studio (or licensee) feels at the time? "
2997,What is the nature of the Juni Taisen?,"The contest involves twelve warriors that have some sort of power (some supernatural). Though the concept of common sense will fade away with elements like Necromantic and flying people in the show. One thing that stuck in my head was the part about the one wish to be granted to the winner. In the end, we see the Rat warrior going through 99 wishes that most of them are impossible to grand (like gaining another superpower or world peace). So what is the nature of the contest? Who is holding these contests and what kind of power do they have to grant such wishes? "
2998,Why isn't Raku Ichijou's mother's face never revealed in the manga?,"Why isn't Raku Ichijou's mother's face never revealed in the manga?  I mean the manga ended, and she was the last character introduced in the series. What was the need to hide her face then? "
2999,Why did Rem die in The Last Name?,"We all know, that in The Last Name, L survives, by writing his own name in the death note. But why did Rem die then? I mean a shinigami dies when he kills a person, in a way that saves the life of another person. But L didn't die. So technically, Rem shouldn't have died, right? "
3000,Do they always wear the same mask?,"In Tokyo Ghoul, each ghoul is provided a mask to hide their identity from the CCG. And although I've yet to watch the entire series (currently on season 2), it appears that ghouls always wear the same mask. Doesn't this cause a major disadvantage during battle?  If a ghoul wears the same mask all the time, then upon first look, an opponent will know the capabilities of the ghoul, should the ghoul have been encountered before. But, if different masks were worn, and/or traded around, this would provide uncertainty when beginning a fight, and would be much more advantageous for ghouls.    So, is there any particular reason a ghoul will wear only one mask?  "
3001,Why did the Hunter x Hunter anime stop in episode 148?,The Hunter X Hunter anime stopped in episode 148. I wonder why?   Is it because Hunter x Hunter is already finished? 
3002,Who's the character in the middle of this WIXOSS cast picture?,"Take a look at this picture, which I have not embedded in this post because it contains some spoilers for the end of season 2 of WIXOSS. It turns out that this is a drawing by Yakou Hiroshi (posted here on Twitter and here on pixiv), who was an animation director for WIXOSS. So not quite ""official art"", per se, but very close to it.   Who is the person in the middle of the picture (to the right of Hitoe, beneath Hanayo, and left of Yuzuki)?   I can identify everyone else in the picture, but I have no recollection of seeing this person. I think every important character in the series is in the picture, too (heck, even Ruuko's brother and the card shop lady are in there). The most important person I can think of who isn't in the picture is Hitoe's mom, and that clearly ain't her... "
3003,Why is this guy handcuffed censored?,"In episode 5 of Uchi no Maid ga Uzasugiru!, at around 12:04, there's a guy who was handcuffed after being found out asking for low-angle pics from young kids. However, the handcuff was being censored with mosaic.    Aren't kids/teens supposed to watch people get arrested or it's just an exaggeration? Or are they hiding other than the handcuff? "
3004,"Is there any official picture of ""Ultra Blue"" Vegeta?","So the japaneses are calling ""Ultra Blue"" to the supposed state Vegeta is going to have according to japanese magazines, where he will release his full Super Saiyan Blue power. And at the end of the last episode in the ending if I recall correctly, his Super Saiyan Blue had pupils, which the regular super saiyan blue doesnt have, and some people were speculating that was ""Ultra Blue"" Vegeta. And a Xenoverse 2 mod already incorporated ""Ultra Blue"" to the game. [website]My question is, is there any official picture of ""Ultra Blue"" Vegeta? "

For e.g. let's take an Ancient Zoan type DF user like captain X-Drake, can he achieve an awakening stage for his type of DF? "
3007,What is the structure of Umanohone?,"In the end of Denkigai no Honya-san there is a short scene with a bunch of Uma's employees and the main guy doing the morning drill with them, repeating the standard shopkeeper phrases such as ""Welcome, dear customer"", ""Thank you for your purchase"", etc.  From the short frames near the advertisement cut, it can be seen that the Uma store is several stories high and pretty big on the outside. But we only see the inside of the section where the main characters work. That last scene shows that there are a lot more employees in the store and that they work in sections divided by other topics. It seems like there are sections dedicated to items intended for adults.   What is the topic of the section we see? What are the topics of other sections? Also is there a name for such big manga stores? "
3008,"Why the ""½"" in the title of ""Ranma ½""?","Ranma ½ (Japanese: らんま½) is a manga, and later an anime, that tells the story of Ranma Soatome, a boy who due to an accident while doing martial arts training in Chine is cursed to become a girl when he comes into contact with cold water, while warm water will return him to a male state. (His father also suffers from this, but turns into a panda instead.)  Why, though, does the name of the manga/anime have the ""½""? I assume it has something to do with Ranma's gender bending, but is there an explanation for why the ""½""? "
3009,"Is ""Devilman: Crybaby"" related to the 90's or the older Devilman series?","I looked at MyAnimeList, there is a classic series, it's Devilman, had an anime adaptation in January 5th, 2018. I am interested to watching this series. Quick search for these series, it has a lot of adaptations since 1970's.   Do I have to watch all of those serieses before started to watch Devilman: Crybaby? Are these series unrelated to the past series?  Note: I have never watched or tried to watch this series, so I have no idea about this franchise. "

3013,How is Sakura's and Shinji's relationship different in Realta Nua?,"On the Beast's Lair forum post about the Fate/Stay Night Realta Nua PC English Patch, there is this item in the FAQ:     Q: I want to view the original 2004 version of the   relationship between Sakura and Shinji, but I don't   want to view the H scenes, what can I do?   A: We're working on something to accomodate this request.   In the meantime you need H scenes on to view the original   version of the Shinji/Sakura relationship. If you don't   want to view the H scenes but want to see thier original   relationship, then my advice would be to, starting from   Day 5 of HF, turn H scenes on when Shinji is in a scene   or is mentioned, and on Day 14 make sure you have H scenes   on until you see the last Shinji scene.    This can also been seen in this link.  Now i am assuming that what it's talking about is that in Realta Nua, Shinji's and Sakura's relationship is different compared to the original game. In the original Fate/Stay Night their relationship was that Sakura would became the new head of the Matou family, which Shinji believed he was entitled to, and when Sakura felt sorry for him, Shinji thought she was submitting to him which lead to years of physical and sexual abuse.      This leads to Heaven's Feel where Shinji attempts to rape Sakura, threatening her that he'll tell Shirou about what he has being doing to her and claiming that Shirou won't want to have anything to do with her after that. Sakura snaps and kills Shinji and then realizes she's the Shadow.   However, when I played it, there was no depiction of rape so I can't understand how or why Shinji's and Sakura's relationship would be different in Realta Nua. How is their relationship different, and why would it be changed? If Sakura's sexual abuse is cut out from Realta Nua does this mean her abuse at the hands of Zouken and his worms is also altered, and if so, how? "

And is there some sort of connection between all 3 characters who are in different anime to make them almost look identical? (e.g. the light in the hair and the face seems to match perfectly yet the shirt on either side doesn't) "
3017,"Where does the term ""waifu"" come from?","I was stalking a forum looking for images to nab to use as wallpapers, and there was a post where posters were claiming characters as their ""waifu"".  Seeing how it is spelled, I would assume that what they mean is ""wife""; however, it seems weird to use the term ""waifu"" rather than the normal Japanese term for wife (my understanding is that it's ""Tsuma"" (妻); however, I could be wrong).  So, where did the term ""waifu"" come from? If I am wrong, and ""waifu"" isn't what I think it is, could someone explain what it is and where it came from? "
3018,Why do the top 10 heroes in Boku no Hero Academia only come from Japan?,"In Boku no Hero Academia, we know the world is not limited to only Japan; there are America and other countries as stated especially in the BNHA: Two Heroes movie. But why are the known top 10 heroes (probably all the best heroes) Japanese? Endeavor, Jeanist, Edgeshot, etc. are all from Japan, even All Might (although he's been in the USA doing hero work).  Is there another top hero that is actually not Japanese or not from Japan? Or is it just that Kohei Horikoshi makes Japan so much stronger in this series? "
3019,Why is the title spelled as Terra Formars?,"Why is it that Terra Formars is spelled as Terra Formars and not Terraformars or Terra for Mars, while the technology to transform inhabitable planet into a habitable planet is called Terraforming and the noun is terraformer (Oxford Reference)?  Was there any particular reason mentioned by the creator of the series for this way of spelling or is it just on a whim? "

3021,Information about Spice and Wolf Manga,"So I completed the Spice and Wolf anime, seasons yesterday. And found the ending unsatisfying, so incomplete.  Now I want to complete the story, so I tried looking for the manga on some websites online but I could only find the manga up till Volume 6, which is part of season 1 of the anime.  I did find out that the light novel is way ahead with 15 volumes (anime completed at 5th excluding 4th volume) but I don't like reading light novels.  Later I did find  something on amazon It claims its volume 13th of the manga, but I am not sure it really is.  Now I want to buy the manga, but where can I buy them? And does the manga really extend beyond the 6th volume I already managed to find? "
3022,What kind of paper did Ghibli use for their storyboards?,"I googled their Wind Rises storyboards and noticed that many of the panels were painted in with watercolor. Does anyone know what kind of paper the studio used, when planning for their films?  I mainly would like to know the fiber/acidity, medium (this one might be redundant though the paper might be multi-media?), dimensions, texture, absorbency. Any approximate answer based on knowledge of common practices in the industry, or specific knowledge of Ghibli's processes (aside from The Kingdom of Dreams and Madness, are there other resources to learn more about the production details behind their films?), would be enormously helpful.     And out of curiosity, does anyone know if there are similar kinds of paper, that one could paint over with oil? Or is it just oil painting paper?  "
3023,Why did Nano explode?,"I was recommended My Ordinary Life by a friend and have watched the first episode.  Needless to say, I was confused and amazed.  Towards the beginning of the first episode, Nano trips into a guy and results in a rather large explosion.  I have a feeling trying to apply logic to this show is likely impossible, but is there any reason for the explosion?  Was it from tripping, the cherry blossom, or possibly the sandal falling off?  Note: I've only seen the first episode so far so (if there even are any) please refrain from spoilers. "
3024,"Has Saber, Arcuied, Shiki or any other Typemoon characters ever canonically meet one other within their respective story?","In All Around Type-Moon spin-off manga. It was mentioned that Saber from Fate/Stay Night, Arcuied from Tsukihime and Shiki from Kara no Kyoukai are the three main heroine of Nasuverse and they meet each other there, saying long time no see.   Have these three ever met before in their original story? Or if they weren't, is there any character, preferably the main characters, from their representative story meet each other?    And by original story I mean in Fate/Stay Night visual novel, its prequel Fate/Zero and its sequel, Fate/Hollow Ataraxia, Tsukihime visual novel and Kara no Kyoukai light novel. "
3025,How did Yui learn Classical Chinese?,"Near the beginning of the Fushigi Yuugi anime, Miaka and Yui find a copy of The Universe of the Four Gods in the National Library. Miaka is surprised that Yui can read this book, which is stated to be in Classical Chinese rather than Japanese or any other language.  How did Yui learn enough Classical Chinese to read this book? At the beginning, Miaka and Yui are both 15 years old, attend the same school, and are studying for the same entrance examinations, so it would seem unusual for their studies to have diverged significantly. Is this explained anywhere in the manga or in supplementary materials?   Is this a particular interest of Yui? Did Miaka pick a different language to study in school (if so, which one?)? Is Yui simply far more intelligent than Miaka? Is there some other explanation?  "
3026,What happens to the drones at the end of episode 6?,"At the end of the sixth episode of Jinrui wa Suitai Shimashita the two drones in form of black panels have handles attached to them and placed in a wooden shelf with a note near them saying ""1 hour of winding = 1 minute"". It's not very clear from the characters' lines what this all means.        Can't drones recharge from electric sockets? I thought Pion just did at the beginning of the episode? Why resort to manual winding mechanism? What's really going on? "

3028,Where were we first given the Angels' names?,"On Wikipedia and a bunch of other sites, we are given the names of a number of Angels, such as Sachiel and Ramiel. Yet at least in the subbed version of the original 26 episodes that I've been watching - I just got to episode 12 - I haven't seen much (if any) mention of the Angels' names. (Comparatively, I remember seeing the names of new monsters being listed as they appear in-episode in shows such as Ultraman Max. It's of course possible that I might have missed something similar in EVA, but I feel like it's hard to get through this many episodes without noticing at some point.)  Where are the names from? From sites such as this one, it seems that there is definitely official information out there, but at least in this case, this is only information for a ""platinum DVD release"", which would probably be quite a bit later from the original broadcast.  Thus: When and where did viewers first learn of the Angels' names? Was this within the original broadcast, or was this perhaps in something like an artbook? "
3029,Why didn't Annie take Eren out of his Titan when she kicked and beat him in the head during their fight in Stohess?,"When Annie hardened her leg and kicked Eren in the face, Eren started to bite down on the crystal until Annie started beating him in the head. However, when she was done, she just ran away. That was the perfect time to take him out of his nape and if she'd done so, I believe the female titan would've succeeded.  So, what was going through Annie's mind? Why didn't she take Eren out of his Titan when she kicked and beat him in the head during their fight in Stohess? "
3030,Why did they air all four Tsukimonogatari episodes in one day?,"The most recent story of the Monogatari series, Tsukimonogatari, has just aired and has all of its four episodes aired on one day. The same thing happened with Hanamonogatari which aired on August 6, 2014. They aired all of its five episodes on that day.  Why did they do that? Why didn't they wait and air 9 episodes over multiple days, or maybe wait some more to make Monogatari Series: Third Season with Owarimonogatari and Zoku-Owarimonogatari? Why did they air all its episodes in one day? What's the point of making it have 4 or 5 episodes when it could also fit in a movie as well? "

3032,What exactly happens to a Titan's body after it is killed?,"I just started watching the anime and I haven't read much of the manga so I don't know if it is explained further on.  We all know a Titan's body gives off extreme heat, from an encounter Eren had with the Colossal Titan and an episode where they learned this in class.  In episode 6, when Mikasa killed a Titan, we saw the body still giving off heat..    ..and a few minutes later it was pretty badly burnt, unrecognizable in fact.    Later in episode 7 when Eren in his Titan form attacks another and beats it to a pulp, we see that the process has somewhat accelerated? At first I thought the body eventually burned away but this one was different than the first. All of the Titan's flesh was gone.      So, what exactly happens to a Titan's body structure after it is killed? Does the heat burn it up now that it cannot regenerate or what? "

3055,How can we convert between a.t.b. and Revolution Year?,"In the first two seasons of Code Geass, dates are mentioned with ""a.t.b."". I took this screenshot from first episode of season one:    However, in Code Geass: Akito the Exiled, dates are mentioned as R.Y. (Revolution Year). This is a screenshot from the Akito the Exiled trailer:    So, first question: What does a.t.b. stand for? And, also: How can we convert between a.t.b. and R.Y.? Which Revolution Year would 2010 a.t.b. be? "
3056,How could the four Hokage be reanimated by Orochimaru?,"In Episode 264 of Naruto Shippuuden, Kabuto clearly states that the four Hokage can't be reanimated because their souls were sealed away in the Reaper Death Seal.  So how come Orochimaru can suddenly use the reanimation jutsu on them?  I kind of get the feeling that everyone just forgot that this shouldn't be allowed, or am I missing something that suddenly allows it? "

3058,Why do Pop Team Epic episodes repeat with different voice actors?,"When watching Pop Team Epic on Crunchyroll, each episode plays twice in a row. Both times the episode is nearly identical, only with the main characters voiced by male actors instead of female actors.  Why does each episode of Pop Team Epic play twice? Why re-record the show with different voice actors? "
3059,Any particular significance to the insects in episode 83 when Netero and one of the world leaders are having a discussion?,"In Hunter X Hunter episode 83, when Netero received ""orders"" from one of the world leaders to exterminate the Ants, there were insects moving on the window facing the leader as well as the one beside Netero while they were talking. Since those insects were given significant ""screen time"", I thought they signified something that I hadn't figured out yet.  At first, I thought they could be connected to Ponzu (but the insects didn't look like bees), Ponzu's bees had already done their job anyways and why would one fly to meet a supposedly 'Muggle' president anyways? I've searched a bit online already but couldn't find anything. Is there anything here directly related to the story or is it just some metaphor/symbolic thing regarding how the Hunters were about to confront Insects?     "
3060,How does the summoning of the Ten Tails work?,"If Demonic Statue of the Outer Path requires only a part of the chakra of the Nine-tails and the Eight tails, why did they have to kill the other Jinchuuriki to obtain the tailed beast just to complete the Juubi?   Why not obtain only parts of the chakra of each tailed beasts? "
3061,Why did Mikako send Ikaros from the sky?,"I have watched the movie of Sora no Otoshimono entitled ""Sora no Otoshimono Final: Eternal My Master (2014)"".   In this movie, when Mikako scans Ikaros' memory, it was revealed that Mikako was an Angeloid who sent Ikaros from the sky. In the anime TV series, it was never shown that Mikako is an Angeloid. She's just a childhood friend of Sugata, whom she calls ""Ei-kun"", and is the daughter of an influential yakuza boss in Sorami. And there was a possibility that Sugata is also an Angeloid because they were friends since childhood.  So, why did Mikako send Ikaros from the sky? To meet Tomoki?         This is Mikako Satsukitane.  "

It is in Hunter x Hunter, and the song is :  Tell Me (Kirua Theme)  Here is the link : [website]I need the instrumental version of this song. It has already appeared in some episodes, for example on episode 34 during the fight between Kirua and Riehvalt. Or when Kirua uses his yoyos.

3063,Is Law's Devil Fruit immune against Haki?,"Law cut Vergo into two in one hit on Punk Hazard.    As far as I know, Haki users can block Devil Fruit attacks. The best example was when Rayleigh fought against Kizaru, in which he easily countered Kizaru's sword with his Haki.    Why couldn't Vergo block Law's attack? Is Law's Devil Fruit immune against Haki? "
3064,How can Kurumi Tokisaki's clone be killed twice?,"In the anime series Date A Live to Date A Live II, there was this clone of Kurumi that had feelings for Shido. In seasons 1-2, the same clone was killed twice by Kurumi. The first was on the school rooftop and the second was in the festival. I finished the anime a while ago and there was some question that is bugging me.  How can the same clone be killed twice? Had the first death didn't kill her fully? If the first death killed her fully, then how did she manage to come back to meet Shido? And is it possible that the same clone will come back again? "

3066,What was the shop that Subaru went into?,"In Ro-Kyu-Bu! SS episode 6, Subaru and the team makes a stop at a local shop while on a class field trip. Aoi is with them as well, and reads the sign out as ""Youjiya"":    In the next cut, she says it aloud again, and says it as ""toddler shop"":    However, when we go inside the shop, Subaru is buying toothpicks:    Does the sign indeed say ""Toddler Shop""? If so, why were there toothpicks inside (and nothing seemingly toddler-ish)? If not, what did the sign actually say? "
3067,"What does Tomoko mean by ""Is he Kenshi***?""","In Watamote Episode 9, Tomoko is angry at her little brother and says:     Does he have to be better than his big sister at everything?   Is he Kenshi***? That bastard!      What does she mean by Kenshi***? "
3068,Do cell phones and email exist in Gankutsuou?,"For the most part, Gankutsuou is set in Paris in the year 5053. Technological advancements shown in the series include:   Space travel and moon colonisation Danglars' communication with Michelle, his assistant, over a wireless connection Noirtier de Villefort's prosthetic arm The pen inside Noirtier's arm, which auto-writes and which is used to access his memories Lucien Debray's use of headsets to access government records through a VR application The Count's pocketwatch, which is revealed to be a bugging device   With this taken into account, I was surprised to realise that the main characters never seem to use cell phones or email, even in situations such as:   Albert's failed attempted to see Eugénie after her engagement to Andrea Cavalcanti Eugénie's thwarted attempt to see Albert after the Morcerf scandal breaks out Eugénie's failed attempts to contact Franz while he was in Marseilles (although it is also possible that Franz intentionally made himself unreachable)   Do cell phones and email exist in the world of Gankutsuou? If they do, why do the characters not use them? Or are the technological advancements in Gankutsuou just constructed so that the original social structure  of the novel is not changed? "
3069,Is this the correct translation of what Tomoko is saying?,"In Watamote Episode 10, Tomoko comes back to school to find out that her seat has been changed, she gets a little agitated and says this (well according to the subs, that is):     I have to sit here for the whole goddamn second term? Fuck me with a chainsaw dildo!   Now, I can't really Read/Write Japanese or even understand it, but I'm not quite sure that she is actually saying that. Is she?   "
3070,Why was Light only targeting Japanese criminals when he was in the US?,"When Light's sister is kidnapped by Mellow's gang and the Kira Task Force goes to the US to do the trade for her with the Death Note, when things start getting out of control Light yells at Misa to keep writing in the Death Note.     Light: MISA! Just shut up and do like I told you, all right?! Look! I need you to keep killing Japanese criminals so just do that! This guy’s obviously investigating Kira and he won’t give up. If the killings are delayed, we are in trouble. Don’t you understand?   But as shown when L was investigating, Light focusing on an area is what lead to L's conclusion that Kira was Japanese and at this moment Light knew of Near's SPK in the US, not to mention Kira targets criminals around the world and gets a lot of the information from the internet.     Soichiro: But still, it’s impossible for us to sensor everything on the Internet. And we haven’t had any new leads in a while.      Matsuda: But posting names with faces online, I’m sorry, but if you ask me, it’s the people doing that who deserve to die. But I guess, that’s never gonna happen. Kira gets a lot of his information from the Internet so he’s not gonna kill those people.   I get why Light doesn't want the killings to die down but why is Light targeting Japanese criminals while he was in the US?  NOTE: I'm watching the English Dub released by Madman in Australia which I assume is the same Dub released by Viz Media. "
3071,"Why nuns, bishops and catholics have magic powers in A Certain Magical Index?","In Catholicism, magic is rejected and seen as something from the devil, witches, heathens and probably heresy. Miracles (which could be seen as magic by others) dont use a spell or a ritual as fair as I know.   According to this   Conspirancies &amp; Catholicism - Magic      All practices of magic or sorcery, by which one attempts to tame   occult powers, so as to place them at one’s service and have a   supernatural power over others – even if this were for the sake of   restoring their health – are gravely contrary to the virtue of   religion. These practices are even more to be condemned when   accompanied by the intention of harming someone, or when they have   recourse to the intervention of demons   In a Certain Magical Index, Catholics are seen portraying all kinds of magical powers. Now I don't know much about the non-catholic cristian anglican puritan english church , but I doubt they allow magical rituals in their practices either.   Why nuns, bishops and catholics have magic powers in A Certain Magical Index?  Is it just because of ignorance of the japanese authors about the Catholic (and perhaps also English puritan church) religions , or is there any reason which gives an argument to this inside the story? "
3072,How does Machvise even hit anyone?,"In the Dressrosa Arc, we see Machvise fight. His fighting style is focused around his Devil Fruit, the Ton-Ton Fruit, which allows him to change his own weight (up to a weight of 10000 tons!) with him jumping up in the air and then falling down on top of people.  What I truly cannot understand is how he is even able to hit anyone! One Piece is a universe where people are fast enough to smack cannon-balls out of the air and dodge bullets, how are they unable to just get out of the damn way when they see him jump up!?!?  Even falling from a mere 20 meters will take about 2 seconds, long enough for a real-life person to see where he will fall and get out of the way. And Machvise tends to jump a lot higher than that, sometimes what seems like 100 meters up, which would take 4.5 seconds to fall down from!!  Honestly, I feel that his Fruit is far more suited for a fighting style that focuses on wrestling (and he even has the big, burly body structure that would work well in wrestling). Just run in, and as soon as he gets a good grip he makes sure to ""fall over"" on top of the person (or at least on top of whatever part he managed to grab) while adjusting his weight to a couple hundred tons. If he does that when holding an arm, he would tear it clean off the body! Way more effective than ""jump and hope to hit"" "
3073,Why would anyone think that Zeref is dead?,"My question is a spoiler itself, you are required to be in/past Alvarez arc.      Why would anyone think that Zeref is dead? He is right there in Alvarez a king as obvious as the sun, so how could the people in Ishgar seriously miss such a fact?   Put simply, that's all I want to know. Many people thought he was dead, others that he was simply dormant because of his low profile.       But we know that Zeref said that he wasn't dormant at all himself. So why would people even think that? He was right there all along in Alvarez  "
3074,Why did Tsukasa say that if he and Senku would have met 3700 years ago they would be friends?,"Tsukasa said that if he and Senku would have met 3700 years ago they would be friends. How does this make sense? Tsukasa faces Senku because he wants to turn the stone world into a modern world through science. But if he would have lived 3700 years ago he would be friend with Senku and according to his imagination scenes, he would help Senku with his science. Which is the reason he opposes Senku now.   Why did Tsukasa say that if he and Senku would have met 3700 years ago they would be friends? "
3075,Can a child inherit both their parents' clans jutsu?,"Can a child in Naruto inherit both abilities from his parents' clans?  For example, if Ino and Sasuke had a child is there a possibility for it to have both Uchiha's Sharingan and Yamanaka's mind transfer jutsu? "

3077,Are the Curses of Earth natural?,"At the end of the anime series, when Madoka remade the Universe for Puella Magi to be saved before becoming Witches, Homura says that with Witches being gone Wraiths take their place because Madoka only stopped the Witches from being born and not eliminated the Curses of Earth.  in the Rebellion Movie when Homura transcended and becomes a goddess too, she chooses not to erase the Incubators from existence but rather give them the purpose of managing Earth's Curses (thus seemingly eliminating the existence of the Wraiths and what work Puella Magi needed to do)  Considering that the Curses of Earth were manifested in Witches first, are these curses natural? or is it a result of the Incubators? (ie. bring them to earth or a result of having created Puella Magi/Witches) "
3078,Are Japanese Students really not allowed jobs whiles in schools?,"In Hana and Hina After School (Hana to Hina wa Houkago) one of the main plot points it that neither Hana or Hinako are actually allowed a job and if discovered they could be expelled, to the point that Hinako  quit her job as a Model and      in Chapter 14 (still reading) Hinako quit her job with Hana because Maiko posted online about buying something where Hinako worked.   Is this really something in Japan? that students like Hana and Hinako aren't allowed jobs and would actually get expelled for having one, even if it doesn't interfere with their school works? (as shown how Hana's and Hinako's work scheduled were changed so they could do their exams) "
3079,Why is blood needed to sign a summoning contract and to use the summoning jutsu?,"In Naruto, I have seen that to create summoning contract and to use summoning jutsu, the user uses their own blood.  Why is this required? What is the significance of using blood here? "
3080,What's with Steve Job and crabs reference in Aiura opening song?,"In Aiura opening there's a lot Steve Job and crabs reference    There are still lot more than this. And the whole opening song is all about crab, and sometimes Steve Jobs make some appearance like two pictures above randomly. The anime it self has nothing to do with crab. What's with that? Why Steve Jobs? Why crabs? "
3081,Was L suspicious of all Light's girlfriends or only Misa?,"In Death Note, Chapter 33 (Vol. 4), Misa Amane is arrested under the suspicion she was the Second Kira. After that, L said that they collected lots of evidences in Misa's room (the cat hair found on the video cassette, make-up powder, clothing fibers etc.), besides the fact the criminal who killed her parents was killed by Kira. Supposedly, the objects L was analysing in Chapter 32 (a hair, crumbs from a snack) were collected from her room.  However, how L became suspicious of Misa before seeing her in Chapter 32, in Light's university? I suppose he discovered the relationship between Light and Misa because Mogi saw when the girl appeared suddenly to Light in Chapter 31, and so L ordered an inspection to her room. So, is there any indication that he was him investigating every one of the Light's ""girfriends"" (including the ""Refined Takada""), or it was just Misa that caught the attention of the detective? "
3082,"In Yaiba, why does Nezuko still have a ""muzzle""?","At this point in the anime (episode 17) we see Nezuko no longer act like the flesh hungry demon she was when she first transformed, this is for a couple of reasons that i can think of:     She found her senses and understands family is priority (as shown in ep 1)   In her 2+ year nap, her anatomy shifted (described by the doctor &amp; mentor), to the point where the hunger is no longer killing her and she can act (somewhat) normally     But given these, why does she still need the mouth piece? Whats its purpose? Also if she did still have the hunger, and it was being used as a preventative, couldnt tanjiro ask the doctor to make her be able to survive on only blood?    Something doesnt add up. "
3083,Why did Furuta leave Kaiko alive?,It seems that Furuta's aim was to kill all members of the V and Wasshu clan members who were controlling CCG. So why does he not eliminate both the V and Washhu clans together?  Why does he keep Kaiko alive? 
3084,What is a good way to protect manga from yellowing in an open bookself besides book covers/comic book bags?,"Recently I've started to collect manga. I have twenty-four volumes now. I keep them in an open bookshelf facing a window along with some other books which unfortunately I don't have any place for where it isn't facing the window, so I can't really keep them out of the sunlight. My fear of my books yellowing has been growing especially since the manga pages are so thin. I don't really like the idea of having to put each volume in one of those plastic comic book covers, so I was thinking of maybe putting a strip of white sheet behind them to minimize the impact the light has on them? I also have other books on the shelf that wouldn't necessarily fit comic bags. Is that a good idea, or would it just absorb more heat and further damage the books? Also, if anyone has any other methods, please share them. I’m open to buying stuff if I need to. I only have 20 volumes so it doesn’t need to be something huge (for now :D) Otherwise, the dimensions I need to cover are roughly 1.5 by 7 feet. Thanks in advance.   Edit: Addressing the suggested answers to the duplicate question suggestion and why I think it should be reopened, that question was answered with the comic protector sleeve option which I stated I did not want to do. I was asking specifically about other methods and if the method of hanging a portion of a cut white sheet behind the shelf would work. I would also be open to putting something else behind the shelf. Hopefully this is able to be reopened now, I think its probably different enough from the duplicate now but I can edit it further if need be. "
3085,After leaving the marines why did Aokiji join forces with pirates?,Kuzan/Aokiji was once an Admiral of the World Government. After he lost in the battle for the Fleet Admiral position he left the marines and wander around on its own. And eventually a shocking news shock the World Government. Kuzan joined forces with      Blackbeard pirates    which is regarded as a traitor to the government when he abuses his position as a Shichibukai.           Question: Why did he joined forces with the pirate group which is a traitor and a threat to the government? Does he not believe in justice anymore in the World Government?  
3086,Did the original Bem have a manga that was based on?,"As far as I know, the 2019 BEM series is based in a late 60's anime of the same name. Did that anime have an original manga version? Or did the story start with the anime? "
3087,Does the Vampire Knight manga have additional story that the anime doesn't?,I've watched the Vampire Knight anime. I really like the story so far but find it frustrating that the anime doesn't finish off the story. I'm trying to figure out if it is worth reading the manga.  Does the manga contain more story than the anime? Does it finish the story off? 
3088,"As of 2016, which has been the last Type-Moon work that's contained explicit content?","A recent question made me realize something. Type-Moon's early works like Tsukihime and Fate/Stay Night had explicit scenes in them. However, some of their recent works such as Fate/Extra, Mahoutsukai no Yoru and the many re-releases of Fate/Stay Night have actually had none of this.  So I have been wondering: As of 2016, what was the last work Type-Moon released that contained explicit content? Have there been any social factors which may have forced Type-Moon to cease adding explicit content in their works?  Kinoko Nasu first started Type-Moon as a doujin group, so I also include any Type-Moon released doujinshi they may have released (if there are any) which contained explicit content.  By explicit content, I mean graphic or deeply detailed sexual content which would be restricted to adults only. I don't count stuff like in Fate/Extra, such as      In the nurse's office when Hakuno Kishinami's Servant is being recharged by Rin/Rani, there is an implication they may be having sex. (Though I only saw Rin and Saber's scene. Not sure about Archer or Caster, but I assume it's more or less the same.)   Or in the Strawberry Panic Light Novel (which isn't Type-Moon), where      Yaya dreams she's having sex with Hikari and some of the language in that (when Hikari climaxes) I would have thought would only appear in 18/21+ adult content.   Neither of these was restricted to adults only (can't remember Fate/Extra's rating, but Strawberry Panic was marketed towards teens as per the rating on the back of the book). "
3089,Why did Harime Nui's eye not heal?,"Sometime before episode 12, we learn Harime Nui lost her left eye from Matoi Isshin slashing her with a half-scissor.  Around episode 20, Harime Nui is pierced through the chest by Ryuuko, also by a half-scissor, but that time, she did not experience pain and healed from this more serious wound instantly.  It is also revealed that Harime Nui was fused with Life Fibers from birth having been developed inside a Life Fiber cocoon.  Given these facts, why did   Harime Nui experience pain when slashed by Isshin? Her eye not heal from the wound?  "

3091,Does the title of Bobobo-bo bobo-bo mean anything?,"Bobobo-bo Bobo-bo (ボボボーボ・ボーボボ) is certainly a strange anime, but does the title mean anything?  The main character's name is also Bobobo-bo Bobo-bo (Bo-Bobo for short - but not Bo).  Some of the other names in the series are jokes - there is someone called Beauty and another called Don Patch (a pun on ""donpachi"", the Japanese sound of machine gun fire).  Is there some joke in his name (apart from the obvious absurdity)? "

3096,Where do the Alter characters come from?,"I'm fairly new to the Fate series, and I've been seeing a ton of art of 'Alter' characters?  I've seen a lot of fanart of King Arthur (the one you'd regularly see in the FGO game), and that makes sense. But then I see art of Alter Arthur, where the character has silver hair, but I can't seem to find any information on this character.  I get that 'Alter' generally means 'Alternative'. So I'm assuming that these are alternative versions of the characters.  Where are all of these Alter characters coming from? Are they official? What should I take a look at to get filled-in on this sort of info? "
3097,Is Bardock dead?,"I just saw two clips of a movie (I am not sure, because it was short) of Bardock.   One shows the destruction of the Saiyan home world, where he gets the power to see the future and psychic powers while fighting on a different planet.   The second one starts at the same place just after Frieza uses his powerball to destroy Bardock and the planet Vegeta. It starts from the blast and Bardock is sent back in time to his own planet where Frieza's ancestor arives and fights Bardock and where he becomes a Super Saiyan.   Does this mean he is alive? Or that his future would be different in the same way that Dragon Ball Z usually explains that every time you time travel and change history a different parallel dimension is created? "
3098,"Why don't English translated light novels retain the ""backwards"" page ordering?","Despite us westerners reading from left-to-right, top-to-bottom from the front to back with the book spine on our left, when manga is translated and localized (officially) it retains the Japanese way of reading, right-to-left from the back forward with the book spine on our right.  From my understanding the Japanese read text from top-down in vertical lines and since this is probably too much for westerners, it's ""corrected"" in manga. However, while we still read the text left-to-right, the frames/pages of the manga still retain the right-to-left ordering.  With light novels however, this doesn't appear to be the case. With the light novels of Strawberry Panic localized by Seven Seas and Spice and Wolf localized by Yen Press, the books are read from left-to-right with the spine on our left; this includes the order of pages.  Now ignoring the obvious problems of printing the words backwards, why aren't English translated light novels printed with the reverse page ordering? Where we start from the back of the book with the spine on our right? "

But when the demon king attack Escanor, it's appear that Escanor does take damage from him.          Isn't using ""The One"" mode any damage he receive is not harmful for Escanor?

3102,Why is the written language inconsistent throughout One Piece?,"I noticed even in the Englished Dubbed version of One Piece many of the props (flags, signs, etc) use Japanese symbols rather than alphabetical words, and now, watching on the Subbed version, I notice some things are actually written in English. For example an island entrance says ""Punk Hazard"" and ""Danger"" in English, even though they're speaking Japanese.   I've noticed this kind of inconsistency elsewhere too, for example, even in the Subbed version, you hear many English words and names, such as their shipwright saying ""Super!"". I've nopticed more things like this throughout the entire series, having watched many episodes in Dubbed and Subbed versions.  So, is there an explanation for why English and Japanese are intermingled so heavily in One Piece? it seems odd for the text to be inconsistent. Maybe they produced a few different versions with different text forms, but that would be odd since it's not even an English dubbed version in some cases.    Was the writer bilingual? Or was it perhaps a strategy to please English and Japanese viewers equally? Or some other reason? "

3105,"What would Light Turner's ""Conditional"" Entry in the Death Note actually do with the canon rules","in the Netflix Americanized Live Action Death Note Movie. we have this exchange near the end where Light Turner is confronting Mia     What?    What did you do?    You put my name in it, didn't you?    It was if you took the book.    I thought I could convince you not to.    Are you kidding me, Light?    -You put my name in the book! I got mad.    -Are you kidding me?!    You said you love me!    I thought you wouldn't take the book!   Source: springfieldspringfield (sorry there's no names. reason why i hate the site)  this exchange and from what i have heard from other people suggests that Light Turner put Mia's name in the Death Note so that she would die only if she took the Death Note (though i don't know the exact wording he used)  however with the real ""How to Use"" rules of the Death Note from the anime and manga, if someone wrote such a conditional clause how would it actually work? "
3106,Was this samurai the inspiration for the blind general's character in One Piece?,"This blind guy's attitude, facial expressions, and facial structure look very specifically like the blind samurai general in One Piece, who can lift mountains with his Devil Fruit powers. They even, from this short scene, have nearly identical personalities.  Did this movie character inspire the One Piece character, or is there no known relation? "
3107,"How should I approach the Beck manga, having watched the entire anime adaptation?","I just finished the Beck anime and I want to continue the story from the manga. Do I need to start from the beginning of the manga, or is there any specific volume/chapter I can pick up from? Also, are there any significant differences between the manga (source material) and the anime adaptation, that would require me to start over if i were to start reading the manga? "
3108,"who, or what, is Gal?","in the Post Game content of Tales of Hearts R you get access to locations called the Triverse Gate. while in there Gal seems to act strangely.  After you reach the end of the last Triverse Gate area (green area with a green winding road and a large green gate), when you beat the game again you get an extra ending shown here  [website]in it we see Gal at this same gate saying how he avenged his wife and daughter and it's ""Time to head back"" before the gate opens (it didn't when Kor approached it before) and Gal walks in. the next scene we see a group of soldiers with spears and a gate and something banging. the soldiers mention their surprise there might be a survivor before the gate opens and Gal comes out saying ""Home Sweet Home"". he is then seen taking off his Soma and tossing it to the soldiers saying it's a ""Gift from the other side"" before the scene ends with Gal getting a new title suggesting he's from another dimension.  In the Tales of games the only other dimension i know of is Niflheim however neither the Triverse Gate nor where Gal appears to show up look anything like the Ginnungagap and all the other places in the games i've played are separate planets from my understanding  So just who, or what, is Gal? Where did he come from? Why did he go to Organica? and what's this revenge about his Wife and Daughter is he talking about?  NOTE: i've played Phantasia, Destiny, Eternia, The Abyss, Legendia, Symphonia (and Dawn of the New World), Graces F and Hearts R "
3109,"The pun worked in English, but what was it in Japanese?","The series Kamigami no Asobi is a reverse harem involving a mortal girl, Yui Kusanagi, who is tasked with teaching six of the ancient gods about the meaning of love.  Episode 4 focuses on Hades.  He is shown to have a dry wit and a tendency towards intellectual puns.  However he avoids contact with people and gods because he is cursed and believes he will bring misfortune to those near him.  At the end, Yui and the other gods show him that they really like him and will chance misfortune to be around him.  In explaining his happiness to her, he says (in English subtext, time mark 21:04 to get full context):   I cannot wallow in misfortune. Kusanagi, ""Yui"" were right about everything.   The pun works great in English. It got me curious if there was a pun in Japanese as well.  Is ""Yui"" similar to a Japanese word for ""you""? If not, how did it work?  "
3110,Does the Hellsing manga cover more material than either anime series?,"Does the Hellsing manga cover more material than either anime series? I read the wikipedia page, but didn't see any mention of it.  For example, does the manga continue the story where the animes leave off?  I'm not a big manga fan, so I don't know how books and chapters translate to anime episodes in general, let alone to this one.  Watching Drifters makes me want more, so I started rewatching Hellsing Ultimate and I'm thinking about getting or reading their mangas. "
3111,What happened to Retsu's doll at the clothing shop?,"In the Hunter X Hunter: Phantom Rouge movie, what happened to Retsu's doll when she activates it after Gon and Killua step out to talk? We never see anyone exit the shop after Gon and Killua. Did she swap places with her doll?   She mentions she ""left her doll in the shop for safekeeping;"" what exactly happened here? How did she catch up to Gon and Killua in the alley?   "
3112,Why is Monokuma's English voice used in the videogame very different from his English voice used in the anime?,"Normally I watch anime and games with Japanese voice acting and subtitles, but my favorite streamer played through Danganronpa 1-3 and I watched with them playing with English voice acting.  In the game, Monokuma's English voice sounds cute but evil; it's high pitched, maniacal and Disney-esque.  In the anime Monokuma's English voice is deep and raspy; it sounds like a cross between Micheal Keaton playing Beetlejuice, and a chain smoker. In fact the English anime voice sounds more like the Japanese anime voice that was used for Monokuma.  Why is there such a difference in style of voice for the same character in the same language?   Most of the time I've seen the same voice actor for characters appearing in both the anime and the video game. And even if the company can't get the same exact voice actor, they at least try to get the voice in the same style of the character. Why is Monokuma's voice so different between the anime and video game?  "
3113,Why did Infinite Stratos light novel change publishers?,"The first 7 volumes of Infinite Stratos light novel was published by Media Factory under Kadokawa. Later it was suspended, but in 2013, volume 8 was released by Overlap (under Kodansha). They in turn hired a new illustrator to redo all the covers.  Some speculate that the reason was that the author argued with fans on Twitter, giving bad publicity. If that's the case, can said tweet be found now?  Some also said that Overlap was formed by former Media Factory employees. Could the conflict be higher up? "
3114,Visual novel profits and costs,How much money and time does making a VN usually cost? What's the profit it can usually generate? Is it profitable?  You can engage in any VN segment (indie games...) to answer my question as I know the topic is quite broad. 
3115,"What does ""Khorosho"" mean?","In episode 10 of Love Live season one, when Yazawa Nico is woken up and everyone sees her facial mask, Ayase Eli comments saying ""Khorosho"". She says this also when Sonoda Umi is woken up and turns into a ""demon"". Given the context, I thought ""Khorosho"" meant something like ""scary"" or ""frightening"" but it was weird that NISA didn't change this in the English subtitles.  However, at the end of the episode when all the girls are on the beach holding hands and watching the sunrise, when Nishikino Maki thanks her, Eli says ""Khorosho"" and also Eli's sister Alisa says ""Khorosho"" when she's corrected in thinking that a red bean bun was a cream puff in episode 12. In both of these situations, I can't really imagine ""Khorosho"" meaning ""scary"".  So what does ""Khorosho"" mean? And why wouldn't it be translated in the English subtitles? "
3116,Why does no one notice the 2nd generation Digi-destined in Digimon Tri?,"In the beginning of episode 1 of Digimon Tri, we see glimpses of the second generation Digi-destined (Davis, Yolei, Cody, and Ken; sorry I only know their English dubbed names) being destroyed by what looks like Alphamon.  Several (in universe) days have past since this event, so why has nobody inquired about what happened to them? I would imagine that they would be missing and somebody would notice.  Are the 2nd gen Digi-destined even alive after their defeat? "
3117,How could Naruto twist his ankle?,"Well, when Naruto was fighting Sasuke at the Valley of the End, Sasuke popped a hole in his shoulder, to prevent him from using the Rasengan.  Naruto, in response, activated his Nine-tails chakra (to less than one tail), and the hole healed so fast it was actually visibly closed.    A few years into the future, Naruto has (almost) complete control over the Nine-tails' chakra! And yet, when he attacked Kisame, he twisted his ankle, and that didn't heal until much later.  What the hell? That chakra had enough life force to sprout trees from Yamato's logs! Why couldn't it heal a simple twisted ankle? Can we dismiss it as a case of ""Allow Gai to fight Kisame and provide Naruto an excuse to stay out of it""? "
3118,How come that Yukiteru won if Ninth was still alive?,"I just finished watching the Mirai Nikki anime. Haven't seen the manga.  The last standing player becomes god. At the end, either Yukiteru or Yuno have to die. Yuno dies and Yukiteru is declared the winner of the game.  But how come, if Ninth was still alive?  I had some assumptions:   Maybe, at this point, no one cares about the game's rules.  But then it wouldn't be necessary to kill either Yukiteru or Yuno. So it seems like the rules must be followed no matter what.  Everyone thought that Ninth was dead. So perhaps the ""system"" was fooled.  But this would prove that the game's rules have no kind of ""transcendental/godlike"" authority, as they are incapable of telling whether Ninth is still alive or not. If that's the case, the rules can be bended. But if you could bend the rules, then it wouldn't be necessary to kill either Yukiteru or Yuno.  When Deus saved Ninth, maybe he kind of disqualified her from the game, so she's not a player anymore and doesn't have to die.  I don't remember if this was mentioned or implied. Was it?    How did Yukiteru win the game, if Ninth was still living? "
3119,In what order should I watch Afro Samurai?,"Should I watch the movie first or the start with the first season?   And if I start with first season then should I watch the movie and then the resurrection?   Please tell me what should I watch, in what order and why? "
3120,When and where does Attack on Titan take place?,"Is the setting of ""Attack on Titan"" (Shingeki no kyojin) supposed to be Earth in the distant future and Titans suddenly appeared out of nowhere and devolved society to medieval level of technology? Or is this just a completely fictional setting? "
3121,How do people set up sites like MangaReader and MangaFox? Aren't they illegal?,How do people set up sites like mangareader.net and mangafox.me? Aren't they illegal? 
3122,What are the revolvers from Trigun called?,Do the revolvers that Vash and Knives carry in Trigun have names? Is there anything they are called individually? 
3123,How old were Sting and Rogue relative to the other Dragon Slayers at this key point in the timeline?,"So anyway, in the latest chapter, it was revealed that:      Natsu and the 4 other Dragon Slayers from 400 years ago actually met some time before they were sent to the future. Quoting Zeref, most likely because of the dragons in their bodies making this stuff (I forgot the name) to prevent them from turning into dragons themselves, they have mostly forgotten about meeting.    Before they time travelled, they all seemed the same age. And Lucy's mother opened the gateway (I assume) just once for them all. She didn't have all keys and became ill until she died, so I think we can definitely assume she didn't do it again.    Then how is it that Sting &amp; Rogue are generally the same age as Natsu in the past, yet have to catch up to Natsu, Gajeel and Wendy who are frozen (petrified, Fairy Sphere'd) for 7 years?   I mean, it could be a reason we don't know yet. Or am I just missing something VERY simple? "
3124,Can 3 people fuse using the potara earrings?,"Consider the following scenario.  We have Goku, Vegeta and Trunks. Amongst the 3 they have 2 pairs of potara earrings.   Can Goku and Vegeta fuse using 1 pair of potara earrings and then using the other pair of earrings can Vegito and Trunks fuse ?  I understand potara earrings can only be used once in a lifetime, but here we have 2 pairs of potara earrings. So does the rule still apply ? If it does then Goku and Vegeta both use the potara twice, once in the buu saga and now in the next DBS episode. Or does this mean that Goku can only now fuse with Vegeta using the potara earrings ?  "
3125,Was Shogun artificially aged?,"Was Shogun artificially aged? I got the feeling that he had to be because Nanami is his real sister and she is not that old. Also the nurse ""Grim"" was performing some king of operation on him. Before that operation he appeared to be young as he lacked all of the wrinkles on his face. Also if he was aged how was that done? What was the yellow goop that ""Grim"" scooped out with the weird spoon? "
3126,Would Infel has disappeared if she and Nenesha succeeded?,"At the end of Ar Tonelico II - Melody of Metafalica when Luca and Cloche are singing EXEC_with.METHOD_METAFALICA/. Frelia is warning Infel that if Luca and Cloche are successful Infel will disappear because of what will happen to the Infel Pira, all the while Infel is saying she knows she's going to disappear because she designed Infel Pira.  But i am wondering, would Infel had disappeared when she and Nenesha tried to create Metafalica 400 year ago and succeeded? does this mean Metafalica was doomed to fail back then because it would require someone to sacrifice their life? "
3127,Do the events of the Dragon Ball movies happen to some extent in the series?,"It's widely known that many events of the Dragon Ball movies contradicted the series, sometimes irreconcilably, and that they are ""non canon"", but does this mean they didn't happen at all? The last two Dragon Ball movies showed many of the events of those movies actually happened in the series. Not long ago, I read an interview in Spanish from someone from the cast of Dragon Ball. I can't remember if it was an animator or director of the last movies, but when talking about the movies and Dragon Ball Super, he said something in the lines of, the true story of Bills, Super Saiyan God, etc, is somewhere in the middle of the movies and the series, meaning the series' events aren't even over the movies.  What about former movies such as Super Android 13, Cooler's movies, Broly's movies, etc? Did  the events of those movies (those which aren't contradicted irreconcilably) actually happened to some extent in the series' story? "
3128,What is the anime where a popular soft drink kills people who drink it X times?,"I've got this vague memory of an anime movie I saw once a very long time ago (around 1990?) and I'd like to find it—but I've no idea of any names that were mentioned.   A particular unique aspect of the plot was that there was some kind of new popular soft drink that was actually made as a part of an evil plan as people died or disappeared (turned to green sludge?) after drinking it X times. The setting was near-future, and I believe that the focus of the action was on some kind of sea warships, but I don't recall much more—that's why I want to find it! :) "
3129,How much can Makarov grow?,"Makarov, master of fairy tail, has the power to turn into a giant. What size  can he accomplish? Is that the limit of his power or there's more to his skill?  An approximate size is also valid. No need to go into detail as apparently the exact size hasn't been confirmed. "
3130,How different are the anime and manga versions of Nichijou?,"I was considering starting to watch the Nichijou anime series, and then thought that maybe I should read the manga first. Then I noticed that MAL lists Helvetica Standard as Nichijou's manga side-story, and that there is also an OVA listed as a prequel to the anime series, and 14 1-minute special episodes listed as the anime's side-story. Bearing all this in mind, I thought I might as well ask:  Is the anime (including the OVA and specials) a faithful adaptation of the manga (including the side-story), with only slight variations? Or does it add a lot of new content, and possibly stray from the original content? Or should they be regarded as two separate pieces? "
3131,What happens to a Peerage when their King is killed?,I was wondering what happens to devils if their king is killed? Do they become strays? And what if they have their own peerage? Does every one under that king including his pieces peerages become stray devils?  
3132,Do all published manga originate from one-shots?,"I heard that some popular manga (for example - Naruto, Nurarihyon no Mago, Beelzebub) are published as one-shots during their first try. I want to know if that applies to all manga or not? Would many manga be published as a one-shot first? "
3133,What is the difference between No jutsu and Ninjutsu?,Aren't Kage Bunshin No Jutsu or Kuchiyose no jutsu of ninjutsu type?   Also please state why Kabuto told Orochimaru that Naruto isn't blessed with a technique and he relies upon the Nine Tails? He said that during Jiraiya/Tsunade fight with Orochimaru in Search for Tsunade arc. I hope Rasengan is a ninjutsu. 
3134,Is the amount of chakra extracted equal to the size of the part that is cut off from the Bijuu?,"When the Eight Tails got a part of his tail cut off, Sasuke brought back the Eight Tails' body, but only about (estimate) 94% of it (due to the tail part still remaining with Killer B in it). Does that mean that they were able to extract 94% of the Eight Tails' chakra?  This also applies to Ginkaku and Kinkaku, who ate whatever was in the Nine Tails' stomach. Say, they ate (wild guess) 3% of the Nine Tails' total mass (they were in there for two weeks) did they attain 3% of the Nine Tails' total chakra amount?  I know my facts aren't spot on, I just wondered if the ratio between the amount of physical mass of Bijuu ""attained"", equaled the amount of total Bijuu chakra energy ""attained""? "
3135,What happened to Juuzawa Juu at the end?,"At the end of the anime,      Juuzawa Juu was hit by a car/truck and he was shown talking to Ame on the ground.   Are we supposed to assume that he       died,   or was it left as a cliffhanger that was never resolved (only three novels were written and that how it was left off)?    Also, how did Ame know that Juuzawa was in danger at the end? Was that supposed to show that she actually did know him from a different life or was it something else? "
3136,Japanese Characters double forename,"I have seen quite a bit of anime and manga now, and I believe I haven't seen a single japanese character with a double forename.  Question: Is there any anime with characters having a ""middle"" name? Also possibly interesting is, where these Characters originate? Are they ""foreign"" or are there japanese characters with a middle name?  To clarify i don't mean a Title or Nickname like Aisaka ""Tenori taiga"" Taiga (逢坂大河) from Toradora. "
3137,What does Kousei mean by not being able to hear the piano?,"This is not really associated with the anime, but, what does Kousei mean by not being able to hear the piano? I play the piano and the more I play, I tend to just look at my hands while it's moving and I can't hear anything except for the noise in the background. It's like the sound is fading away as I play longer. Sometimes I have to focus real hard just to make out the sound of the piano. Is this what Kousei means? "
3138,Is the Umineko ED used elsewhere?,"Recently, I have started watching Umineko no naku koro ni (When the Seagulls Cry) and I found the ending song (YouTube link) of this anime very familiar and similar to a song I have heard before in another anime. In particular, the part 0:40 - 1:00 sounds somewhat like something I've heard before.   Now my question is: did the same singer perform for any other anime, or are there singers who sang the same song as he did (specifically, the part of the song at 0:40 - 1:00)?  Edit: From the comments, I know the song is not used in any other anime known to date. "
3139,Is there a canon explanation as to why Naruto still likes Sakura?,"What characteristic of Sakura makes Naruto like her? She was very useless in the original Naruto, and she is in love with Sasuke. Not to mention, she did not have anything traumatic in her childhood, unlike Hinata, who actually liked Naruto from the beginning.   Also Naruto nearly unleashed the nine tails for Hinata, but still said Sakura was sort of his girlfriend.   Did I miss something here? What did Sakura do to get Naruto to like her? I am only looking for canon answers. "
3140,"What does ""dog's circle"" mean?","I just watched an anime where the phrase dog's circle was used in the English subtitles.  The sentence was, ""We are the dog's circle.""  Is that a well known Japanese expression?  The anime was episode 6 of Natsume Yujin-Cho 5, where it was used at time mark 20:10.  The episode just went up on Crunchyroll this week.  From context, I'm pretty sure it refers to them being a group of friends or allies around one they protect, but not literally surrounding him/her.  Checking on both Google and Bing, there appears to be no general English usage of this phrase.  Is my interpretation correct, and in Japanese would the phrase be instantly understood? "
3141,Why couldn't he simply turn into fire and repair the damage?,"Spoiler alert, stop reading if you're not past One Piece episode 483.  When the guy (Akainu) put a hole in Ace, why couldn't Ace just turn into his element like all of those elemental Devil Fruit users? I get that magma was able to burn him, but how does that stop him from just dispersing like the other elemental fruit users? "
3142,Was the Flare-Flare Fruit that Sabo ate real? Or was it a fake made by Caesar?,"How did Doffy get that Flare-Flare Fruit? Because until now I am still confused how the Devil Fruits spread around the world. Everything about the Devil Fruits is still unclear, like:   Do they grow in the same tree or each of them has their own tree (Flare-Flare Tree maybe)? After the users died, will the fruit grow in the same tree or just fall to random places like Dragon Balls?  "
3143,"Why is Chiisaku Natta Meitantei considered the ""real"" first episode?","MyAnimeList has published a database entry for Detective Conan: Episode One - Chiisaku Natta Meitantei.  In this entry, the synopsis reads:     The ""real"" episode 1 of Detective Conan written by the Mangaka Gosho Aoyama.   What makes this episode the ""real"" first episode? Was the story in the original first episode not by the mangaka? "
3144,Name of the song that plays in episode 6 and 21?,What is the name of the song that plays in Code Geass R1 during episode 6 around 12:20 and in episode 21 around 13:02? Where can I obtain this song? 
3145,"Why does ""Shin Sekai Yori"" portray a homosexual relationship?","In Shin Sekai Yori, there are kiss scenes between two men (Shun and Satoru, I think).  Are that scenes also described in the original novel? Why does it have these scenes since it is unusual for typical anime, and it isn't in the yaoi or shounen ai genres? "
3146,"Could Kana really tell Shinichi's Migi apart from the other Parasytes, or was she just delusional?","In episode 12, Kana tells Shinichi that she can tell Migi's emissions apart from the other Parasytes. However, she is shown as being on ""cloud nine"" for Shinichi - going as far as wrapping his hair around her finger like an engagement ring, and       near the end of the episode, she mistakes another Parasyte for Shinichi in the ruined building, leading to her death.   Since Migi states that her powers are increasing, it could be possible that she would be able to tell the Parasytes apart in the future. However, her death cut that development short.  Was she really able to tell Shinichi apart from the other Parasytes, or was she just delusional? Does the manga reveal anything about this? "
3147,Does Orochimaru know all his jutsu that he learned after he gave Anko the curse mark and was revived from it?,"A portion of Orochimaru's consciousness was in Anko's curse mark, so he could see what she saw, but is this linked with his other consciousness? So that if the real Orochimaru thinks he learns a jutsu, does the Orochimaru in Anko learn it too? Is there any canon explanation? "
3148,Laxus' plan. Would he have fought Makarov?,"In ""The Battle of Fairy Tail"" arc did Laxus ever actually plan on fighting Makarov?  His magic reveals his true feelings, and he tells his grandfather he really just wanted to make the guild stronger. So we know that he never would have smashed the statues of the girls, and he probably never would have set off the Thunder Palace. These were both just ways of pushing Makarov into handing over the guild.  He knows Erza and Mystogan will be coming for him. He plans for an inevitable battle with them, which he is sure he'll win easily. He even tells Freed he'll take care of them.  But, the statues and Thunder Palace aside as he never would have used them anyway, what if he did manage to beat Erza and Mystogan? What if the Thunder Legion had beaten everyone, and Gramps hadn't fallen ill? Makarov would never have just handed over the guild.  But would Laxus have actually fought Makarov in the end to get the guild? Freed tells Cana and Juvia he's storing up his magical energy to fight the master, but Laxus' true feelings are revealed in the end.  Laxus' plan seems to be a little over all the place at times.  "
3149,Why the popularity of German?,"Second to English, German seems to be the most popular foreign language in anime. You see it in titles, names, and even quite a few characters are of German descent.  For example, many characters in Shingeki no Kyojin appear to be German/have German names and there are a lot of German references. Elfen Lied is also German (translates to ""elf/elvish song"").  Is there a reason for this? "
3150,Where is Nagato's body?,"When Kabuto asked Tobi for alliance he showed five Akatsuki members' corpses, and one of them is Nagato's. But then Tobi encountered Konan to get information about Nagato's Rinnegan. Why was Tobi looking for Nagato's body when he already has it? Or is there something I'm missing? "
3151,Is it possible for someone to awaken the Mangekyou Sharingan before they even awaken the Sharingan?,"I was just wondering if it was possible for an Uchiha to awaken the Mangekyou Sharingan before even awakening the Sharingan.  According to wiki:     It (Mangekyou Sharingan) is initially awakened by the trauma suffered from witnessing the death of someone close to the user.   I think it should be common sense by now, but if you didn't know then to awaken the MS the user has to witness something so traumatic, like seeing someone close to the said user die.  According to wiki:     When a wielder of this kekkei genkai experiences a powerful emotional condition with regards to a person precious to them, their brain releases a special form of chakra that affects the optic nerves, transforming the eyes into Sharingan.   To awaken the Sharingan, an Uchiha has to have an extreme(powerful) emotion condition which causes their brain to release a special type of chakra, which will then cause their eyes to transform into Sharingan.  I have put the way the Uchiha awaken the Sharingan and the MS, but could it be possible to combine both of the said ways into one? What I mean is if an Uchiha, who hasn't awakened the Sharingan yet, witnessed something so traumatic they just awaked the MS. Could that even be possible? Or would it just awaken the Sharingan and then the MS almost instantly at the same time? "
3152,"Why is Gotenks never seen going Super Saiyan 2, only 3?","So, while watching DBZ (not super) I thought of something. Why can Gotenks go ssj3 but is never seen going super saiyan 2? Furthermore, how can Gotenks go SSJ3 at all if Goten and Trunks can only go SSJ? Am I missing something?  "
3153,Is the grip shown in Hikaru no Go really used by expert Go players?,"In an early episode of Hikaru no Go Akira Toya comments that Hikaru must be a beginner because he's holding his stones incorrectly. In the show, it is shown that real Go players use a grip that only uses their index and ring fingers. Is this true in the real world? And if so, what exactly is the advantage of this grip? It seems to me that not using your thumb would be more likely to lead to dropping a stone accidentally, so I'm having trouble seeing why it would be used.   "
3154,What does it mean that Gluttony is a fake Gate of Truth?,"Gluttony is said to be a fake Gate of Truth, as shown by when he swallows Ed and Ling. They are transported to a place that is full of blood, which seems to be entirely different from the place where the real Gate of Truth takes someone. What does him being a fake Gate of Truth mean, as opposed to just being some sort of transportation device? What is the difference between his Gate of Truth and the real one? "
3155,Which mountain did they try to climb over?,"During the anime/manga, Kasuga &amp; Sawa attempt to climb over the nearby mountain and reach the other side.  The work is set in a small town in Kiryū, Gunma so I was looking at the area on Google Maps, but it seems to be a very mountainous region:   Google Maps page  Is there any more precise information about where the show is set or the mountain that they climbed? I would like to know what exactly was over that mountain if they did manage to get over it "
3156,Where did Danzo get his first Sharingan?,"In episode 358, Danzo uses Izanagi against Shisui and steals one of his eyes, meaning Danzo had a Sharingan eye prior to having Shisui's Sharingan eye. Nothing is known about how Danzo got his first Sharingan from what I've searched on the web, but we do know that he had one friend named Kagami Uchiha, whom Danzo considered to be one of his true friends.   Ruling out the possibility that Danzo killed Kagami in cold blood, is it possible that Danzo was gifted his first Sharingan from Kagami, possibly in the battlefield? Or could Danzo have gotten the Sharingan from somewhere else? "
3157,Will the Nana manga continue?,"The anime covered until chapter 42 of the manga and the manga now has 84 chapters released. But in June 2009 the series was put on hiatus due to Yazawa being ill (Yazawa is the mangaka).  Yazawa returned from the hospital in the beginning of April 2010 but has not specified when or if she will resume the manga.  Does anybody know anything about it? Will it ever be resumed? If so, when? "
3158,"Why does Yomi relate 3661 with ""Samurai""?","In the last episode of Azumanga Daioh, Yomi relates 3661 with samurai word.    I know is a mnemonic technique to remember things, so things should be something like:  3 ~&gt; sa ~&gt; san 6 ~&gt; mu ~&gt; ??? (maybe shape of hiragana? む ) 6 ~&gt; ra ~&gt; ...roku?? 1 ~&gt; i  ~&gt; ichi   But I couldn't guess at all why relates 6 with both mu and ra. Any idea? "
3159,Do the trapped souls in the Reaper/Shinigami suffer?,"In the English dub, during the fight between the Third Hokage Sarutobi and Orochimaru in the first Naruto series, Sarutobi says that after using the Reaper Death Seal, the souls trapped in the Reaper are tormented for all eternity.   Does this mean that the souls of the First through Fourth Hokages were suffering from the time they were sealed away until they were released in Naruto Shippuden? Or was this a mistranslation?   When the First through Fourth Hokages were brought back by Orochimaru in Shippuden, they didn't seem like they were being tormented - or rather - it appeared that they had no recollection of their time outside of reality.   So which one is it? I did not watch the sub/Japanese episodes or read the manga from this part of the series. "
3160,What is Sakura's Chakra Element?,Naruto is Wind and Sasuke is Lightning if I'm not wrong. What would Sakura's Chakra element be? Was it mentioned in the series before?  
3161,How does a Poké Ball work?,"Is it ever explained how a Poké Ball works? I know that you throw it a Pokémon, and if it is weak enough, you catch it. But is the process ever explained? Does it work on humans? Do most Pokémon like being held in a Poké Ball? "
3162,Why didn't/couldn't Kabuto bring Orochimaru back?,"Kabuto had Orochimaru's DNA and a sacrifice, so why did he not use the Edo Tensei? Or couldn't he have used Anko, like Sasuke did? "
3163,Differences between anime and manga versions of Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic,"I watched Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic and want to pick up the manga starting from anime end. If manga and anime are too different, I might read skipped chapters. How different are then anime and manga versions? Do I need to read it to cover the whole story? "
3164,Why did the older Tetsujin brother become shorter in the anime?,"I was reading about the characters of Arakawa Under the Bridge, hoping to learn some of their background stories. From there, I found out that the older Tetsujin brother grew younger later in the series.  I took a look to verify and found out that this was true, indeed.   In episode 2,   In episode 13,   Did this ever occur in the manga? Is there any explanation to this? Could this be some sort of hint about the show or perhaps just an animation flaw? "
3165,Where can I find the Sunday Without God light novels in English?,"Just as the title asks, where can I find the Sunday Without God light novels?  The anime lacked some detail and plot that I feel it needed, but I can't find the English translations anywhere.  If there isn't an official one, could you give me a fan translated one or something along those lines? "
3166,What did Yuji do to his sister Kazuki?,"In Grisaia no Rakuen (Paradise), after saving Yuji and retrieving the real body of Thanatos (Kazuki actually), there was a scene (aboard the ship Mihama Academy) when Yuji got pissed or irritated due to Kazuki's ""bossy"" attitude. Yuji yelled ""Kazuki!"" and then he dragged her to some place on the deck. Afterwards, when they were ""finished"" Kazuki said: ""Dont ever do that to other girls anymore...""  My question is: What did Yuuji do to Kazuki? Is there a manga that explains this? "
3167,"What happened to Goku's ""Dragon Balls""?","In the Dragon Ball Z: Super Android 13! movie, when Goku is fighting with Super Android 13, there is a scene that showed Super Android 13 punching Goku in the dragon.. uhmm... genitals.  Caution: This picture can cause unexpected pain in the crotch! Watch it at your own risk.    Is there any evidence that Goku managed to produce Goten before that fight? Because I have a doubt about whether he could use them ever again. Are the two circles in the picture (that appear to be torn apart) something else? "
3168,How does the 3D maneuver gear work?,"In Shingeki no Kyojin, the soldiers use the 3D maneuver gear to attack the Titans and cut the back of their necks. In the last episodes, I have seen that they use a balloon of gas as the power to release the chains to climb the walls and trees. How does this exactly work? Is the gas the only power supply to release the chains?  "
3169,Who is this ghost from episode 8 of Shingeki! Kyojin Chuugakkou?,"Episode 8 of Shingeki! Kyojin Chuugakkou features this ghostly character, who is not addressed by name during the episode:    Who is this supposed to be?   From reading the cast credits, I see that this person's name is probably フリーダ (""Frieda""?). Should I know who that is from having watched the anime (not Chuugakkou; the main one, which culminates with the female titan arc)? If not, please please please use spoiler tags - I've been religiously avoiding spoilers for the show for three years now in anticipation of season two, and would rather not break my streak. "
3170,Are there more Exceeds and dragon slayers other than the known 4?,"100 Exceeds were sent to get the dragon slayers. Happy, Carla, Sting, and Rogue are all Exceeds who abandoned their missions.   What about the other 96 Exceeds who are unnamed, unseen, and out of the picture? Does this mean there are 96+ more dragon slayers in earth land? "
3171,What is the meaning behind Tsukihi's pose 17 minutes into in episode 1 of Tsukimonogatari?,"When Tsukihi is taking a bath together with Koyomi, she played with the foam and struck a pose while saying [都条例]【とじょうれい】 (or so I think, based on the translation). Koyomi said it was scary and splashed some water on Tsukihi to wash all the soap away.  Below is the image of the relevant scene (NSFW):         What is the meaning of Tsukihi's pose here? And why did Koyomi freak out like that? "
3172,Why does Zeref want to kill Acnologia?,Why does Zeref want to kill Acnologia so badly? Is there something I missed entirely? Or has it just not been said yet?  I'm not sure if this is explained in the manga because I've only watched the anime. 
3173,In which episode does Rei Ayanami have a life reflection dialogue?,"In which episode of Neon Genesis Evangelion does Rei Ayanami have a long dialogue, where she reflects on life saying things like ""Who am I? What am I? What am I?"". There are pictures of houses and in the background with some quiet eerie music you hear her voice.   I can't seem to find this scene that easily, and I really wanted to write the dialogue down. "
3174,Why do anime characters have pointy chins?,"I've always wondered why a lot of anime characters, or at least some, have pointed chins. One example:  Clannad   I'm wondering why they have such pointy chins. Is it to make them cute or something? Or is it because that's the easiest way to draw them? And if possible, I would like to know when it started, or who was the first to start including it in their work. "
3175,What are the reasons for producing short-form anime?,"Short-form anime (or tanpen anime, see Is there official terminology for anime series that run less than the standard length?) are relatively common, with at least a few each season.   It seems strange to me that this would be a worthwhile investment for studios. Sure, the production costs will be lower, but there are certain overheads that aren't going to scale with cost, and their DVD sales will surely be lower. So it seems like a losing deal for studios.   Why, from a production standpoint, would studios decide to produce short-form anime over a full-length TV series?  "
3176,"What exactly is a ""Nobita face""?","After Gankyou in Joshiraku removes her glasses, her eyes change to '3' characters.    Marii then exclaims:    I understand Nobita is a character in Doraemon, but I haven't found any information online either of pictures where Nobita has his glasses off, or any references to a ""Nobita face"".  Can someone explain this joke further? "
3177,Why did Kiki lose her witch powers?,"In Kiki's Delivery Service, Kiki is a witch and she sets out to train as a witch by herself (like an apprenticeship). Things are going well for her but at some point she starts to lose her witch powers, unable to fly on her broom and unable to talk to and understand her cat, Jiji.  Why did she lose her witches power? Was it because she got sick (but was still missing powers after she got better)? Or do all witches have to deal with losing their powers from time to time? "
3178,What is Ougi reading on her phone when she meets Araragi at the steps to the shrine?,"When Araragi and Yotsugi land at the base of the steps to the shrine in episode 3 of Tsukimonogatari, we see that Ougi is waiting there, reading something on her phone.    What's she reading? Is it plot-relevant? "
3179,At what point in the Strike Witches timeline does Brave Witches take place?,"I recently finished the Strike Witches anime (Season 1, 2, Operation Victory Arrow OVAs and Movie) and am planning to continue watching up to Brave Witches. I want to preserve the continuity of the series as I am watching it.  In the first episode, Miyafuji Yoshika is seen in the company of Sakamoto Mio as seen in the newspaper clipping below:    However, it seems that Miyafuji is still not that famous. I assume then that the events of Brave Witches start in the middle of Strike Witches Season 1.  Is my assumption correct? Where does Brave Witches take place in the whole timeline? "
3180,How can a clock stop working at 99 o'clock?,"  Yuru Yuri Season 2, Episode 4, 12:16  It stopped working but at 99 o'clock. If it's just the reflection (image) shouldn't it be 88:88? Even if it is inverted it will be 18:66, 66 min, but it is not inverted and after repair it shows the time as 15:49. So is that a mistake or there is something really funny which I am not able to get? "
3181,What is Jinta and Ururu's Identity?,"Jinta and Ururu are the kids that works in Urahara's shop. I'm curious as to what their identities are. As far as I remember it was never been said what their background stories are.  Are they Shinigami like Urahara was? If they were, why are they with Urahara? Were they also on the run from Soul Society?  Or are they humans with special powers like Chad and Orihime? If they are, were their powers awakened from being close to Urahara, much like Chad and Orihime's powers being awakened by being near Kurosaki Ichigo.  Or are they Quincies? Although I doubt this very much since they never been seen using bows and Quincy techniques. Or are they modified souls like Kon?  What are they? "
3182,What made Samehada team up with Bee?,"After Kisame passed away, heck, even before he passed away, Samehada seemed to be attracted to Bee. What drove it to do so? The ownership of a sword only changes when the new owner defeats the old owner, isn't it? Or am I getting something confused here? "
3183,Why can Korra bend 3 elements from the beginning?,"In the beginning of Avatar: The Legend of Korra, we see Korra, as a child, bending water, earth and fire, without training to do that. She was born in the Water Tribe, so isn't she supposed to know only how to bend water? Like Aang, who knew only wind and trained a lot to master the other three elements? "
3184,How did the Straw Hat crew become stronger in Enies Lobby?,"In Enies Lobby, everyone looks like they've suddenly become stronger (and have new techniques). Luffy, learned how to pump his blood and his bone. Sanji, learned how to burn his foot. Nami, learned to do Fatamorgana. Zoro with his Asura?  Which part in the story that tells how they got such power? "
3185,Does writing an alias in the Death Note count as misspelling the name?,"This question is inspired by the following rule of the Death Note (source: deathnote.wikia.com):     If a Death Note owner accidentally misspells a name four times, that person will be free from being killed by the Death Note. However, if they intentionally misspell the name four times, the Death Note owner will die.     Does writing an alias, when you assume it is the real name, count as accidentally misspelling a name or intentionally misspelling the name? Does it matter if the alias is similiar to the real name? What happens if the alias is similiar to the real name and as a result of a misspell you actually write the real name? Will the victim die?  "
3186,Filler episodes,"What are filler episodes? I've heard people mention them a lot but I'm not quite sure what they are. Apparently Naruto is packed with tons of them, so what are they? "
3187,Do apples grow on trees in the Shinigami realm?,"In the Shinigami realm, there are other apples, that taste like sand, according to Misa Amane. Do these apples grow on trees in the Shinigami realm?   I think they may rather grow on a plant, close to the ground, because of the sandy taste. But I'm not sure whether there really is ground in the Shinigami realm.  I've also heard that nothing grows in the Shinigami realm.  Is there anything known about this? In the anime, there are not much scenes from the Shinigami realm. "
3188,What's with the taped over speech-bubbles in the preview?,"I just finished episode 24 of EVA, and I noticed that the last two previews I'd seen looked a lot ""rougher"".   The preview after episode 24 consists of a series of what seem to be rough drawings or sketchs over a voiceover. The preview after episode 23 was animated (in that there were some ""moving"" frames), but looked unfinished - the colouring and lining looks incomplete. Moreover, some of the images look like they come from a manga (in terms of, for instance, speech bubbles, or hiragana/katakana given for some kanji - although it seems possible to me that the bubbles might just have been taped on so as to give people involved in production some idea of the dialogue in each scene). For example:     Comparatively, the artwork in prior episode previews seemed somewhat more ""finished"", and, at least in my memory, was usually animated. This I presume is probably because of the fact that EVA had production issues toward the end of the anime run.  But less obvious to me is this: what are these speech bubbles that show up in the episode preview for episode 24 actually for? Are they something that feature in preliminary anime sketches? "
3189,"If the World Government knew that the Strawhats were on Thriller Bark, why didn't they inform the marines?","The World Government was worried enough about Moria to sent Kuma to Thriller Bark, but not inform the marines? That's weird right? Unless they knew the kinds of things Moria was doing on the island - but there are enough marines out there who would look away from that sort of thing at get the job done despite that... "
3190,Why is Demon King not leaving purgatory?,Why are there no frontal battles between the Demon King and the Supreme Deity (the goddess)?  Is there a rule to prevent that? 
3191,Do normal titans have humans in them as well?,"There are several humans which can transfer into titans at will. What about the normal titans? Hange said that titans do not weight as much as they should. Their only vulnerable area is where the real human body would be for shape-shifting Titans. They also look like humans, are there humans inside normal titans as well?  "
3192,Story-telling technique where the drawing style briefly gets much simpler?,"I'm a big fan of web comics, and have a question about a drawing or story-telling technique that I've seen. It seems effective, but I'm not quite sure what it's effective for.  Here's an example, from the most excellent Questionable Content by Jeph Jacques. First, a frame in his usual style:    He's usually quite consistent, but once in a long while there's a frame where he uses a much simpler drawing style:    Another example, from this strip; compare...    ... to...    It's an interesting and entertaining motif, but I'm not clear on just what he's communicating with it, and why it feels effective. Is it an ironic aside? Or is it a pause in the action to let the characters (and reader) consider?  And, what is the history of this? Did Jeph make this up, or have previous cartoonists used it as well?  Any ideas? "
3193,What was the purpose behind Daphne collecting data on the wizards?,"In the Fairy Tail anime, what was the purpose behind Daphne collecting data on the wizards? Was it just to keep them busy fighting the Lizardmen while she destroyed Magnolia, or was she planning on using the data in some other way? "
3194,Why are there different classes of titans?,There are 4 size classes of titans.    Taken from Shingeki no Kyoujin Wiki  Why is this so? Do they get larger when they eat? 
3195,Can a Demon Weapon also be a Weapon Meister?,So I just started watching Soul Eater and have the basics pretty much and u was wandering. Could a Demon Weapon also be a weapon meister? This got me thinking when watching the Thompson Sisters defend themselves against an army of mummies can someone shed some light on this? I know the sisters are just weapons belonging to Death the Kid. 
3196,What is this Ghost Infiltration Key?,"Multiple times in the GITS Arise characters mention the mysterious Ghost Infiltration Key. From what I understand it is somehow used to stop (paralyze?) an agent of government, or perhaps anyone with a cyberized brain.  How does that thing work? A lot of cyber warfare is based on breaking encryptions and bypassing various types of barriers. And then there are these keys. They have to be unbreakable to be deemed worth keeping in one's hands. Otherwise the risk of such an item falling into enemy's hands is too great − they could neutralize the government agents.  It's got ""Ghost"" in its name for a reason, probably to make it clear that the target is not the cyberbrain device, but the Ghost of its user. Ghosts are as unique as it gets in GITS universe, so there can be only one key. Or not?  So my questions are:   How is the Ghost Infiltration Key created? How is it stored? How is it activated? How does it work? Can there be multiple?  "
3197,"Why do first, second, and third grade of Japanese students wear different uniform in Anime?","  I noticed that in most of school-life anime the first, second, and third grader usually wore different uniforms. It's not completely different. Sometimes the differences are pins, ribbon, indoor slippers, tie, and so on. But, what does the reason behind this?   I watch some Japanese dramas. But, couldn't recall any title that has those differences. Is this really part of Japanese culture?   PS: In my country, most students wear uniform too. But there's no differences of uniform between first, second, and third graders. "
3198,What is Takasu Yasuko's profession?,"Ya-chan (Ryuuji's mom) seems to work at nights in the entertainment industry?  She is shown carousing with some older men in a nightclub setting...  So what is exactly her profession? I do not think she is a sex worker, given the lack of social reprise shown in other series for that kind of work. "
3199,Why have they been delaying Kizumonogatari for so long?,"Kizumonogatari is a movie based on a story of the same name in Monogatari Series light novel, which is part of First Season before Nisemonogatari. I don't even remember when it was supposed to air, probably two or three years ago. After the delay, they kept producing other stories in Monogatari Series like Monogatari Series: Second Season, Hanamonogatari and Tsukimonogatari.  Why did they put it off for so long? If it was because of production issue, like Hanamonogatari, why did they keep producing another Monogatari Series but not Kizumonogatari? "
3200,Has there any official background story of Miku? Is she human or android?,"There's a manga titled Hatsune Miku: Unofficial Hatsune Mix written and illustrated by the original artist. However, it is said that it is not official (I haven't read it).   Has there ever any official background story about Miku? It doesn't have to be like any kind of manga, just a background story of her or her personality. All I know (from wiki) is that Hatsune Miku is a 16-year-old girl (or android).   I know Miku is a vocaloid, means she's a software. But as a character is she human or not? "
3201,Is there a way for Naruto to get the Rinnegan?,"Madara was able to get the Rinnegan by mixing Hashirama's meat with his own (i.e. mixing the Indra and Asura chakras) to get the Sage's power. If Naruto did the same by mixing Sasuke's meat with his own, would he get the Rinnegan? Or, if Sasuke mixed Naruto's meat with his own, would he get Rinnegan in both of his eyes? "
3202,Why is Hashirama hailed as the most powerful shinobi of all time?,"Why is Hashirama hailed as the most powerful shinobi of all time and there hasn't been anyone who can surpass him? Also, why is the Wood Style unique to him? "
3203,Brain flour and fairies,"At the end of Jintai's specials we find out that Watashi seems to have permanently lost some of  her brain flour. The number on the fairy spoon was 322 at the beginning and it ended up being 280. Extreme reduction of that number makes Watashi smaller and more simple-minded. At a very low value she started looking like a fairy and her speech became very simplified.      Does this mean that people can become fairies by reducing their brain flour levels? Can fairies become normal people if they eat some of those cookies made from the brain flour? Is this why they always crave sweets?  Also, Watashi looked like a very hard studying girl in the later episodes where her school life is shown. Did the loss of brain flour affected her intellectual capability enough to notice? "
3204,Sibling relationship in Big Mom family,"We see a lot of the girls trying to impress Katakuri and they get embarrassed when he looks at them and their hearts will race if they think he is going to praise them.  I don't think this is normal if they look at him only as a brother. Maybe I'm wrong to think that way (I'm an only child, not much experience with siblings) but was there ever any indication that a romantic relationship is possible between siblings in the Big Mom family?  Was there ever any indication of siblings getting married in the Big Mom family? "
3205,Does Shirou ever learn about Illyasviel being Kiritsugu's daughter?,Does it ever get explored in any of the materials? Does he ever find out?  It seems like she knows about him.   
3206,Why did Tokyo Ghoul √A completely deviate from the manga?,"The first episode of Tokyo Ghoul √A aired today, and at the end (obvious spoiler), Kaneki went with Aogiri (we don't know why yet). However, I read that in the manga, he did the exact opposite. Instead, he tried to create a group to fight Aogiri. Why did the second season completely deviate from the manga? Was it by the choice of the mangaka or the anime producers? "
3207,Is the golden armor (Garo) the only one that must be passed from ancestor to descendant?,"In Garo: Honoo no Kokuin, we see that the golden armor (Garo) can only be passed down to one's lineal descendants (for example, from Anna's father [the former Garo] to Leon and Alfonso).   What about the other armors, like Zoro and Gaia, though? Do they have any restrictions on who can use them? Regarding Zoro, in episode 24, we learn that      Germán's child with Ximena is going to inherit Zoro. That doesn't necessarily mean that Zoro has to be passed lineally, but it does sort of suggest that that might be the case.   On the other hand, it looks like Gaia doesn't have any restrictions based on bloodline, since Raphael was able to pass Gaia onto Alfonso, and I don't see how Raphael could be a lineal ancestor of Alfonso - Raphael is not Alfonso's father (the king), nor his maternal grandfather (the former Garo), nor his paternal grandfather (presumably the previous king, who must be long dead), and anybody from Alfonso's great-grandparents' generation should also be dead.  Answers based on the tokusatsu version are welcome if they make sense in the context of the anime. "

3210,Are manga artists really pressured by the editors not to put dangerous or illegal scenes in their works?,"In the Monthly Girls' Nozaki Kun (both in the episode 1 of the anime and chapter 1 of the manga), Nozaki tells Sakura that the bicycle scene cannot have tandem riding because it is against the vehicle law and he can't display that in his manga.  But the same tandem riding is shown in several current works (like episode 12 of ""Your Lie in April"" - Kaworu rides Kousei's bike standing up).  So, does the statement by Nozaki-kun have any real world parallel? Are manga artists really pressured by the editors not to put dangerous or illegal scenes in their works?  Is there any law in place forbidding this display of ""illegal"" activities?  Keepe in mind that Nozaki's manga is aimed at girls 15+ in his fictional world. "

But, what exactly is a dango? We know it's a food of some sort because the main male character goes and buys them from a gas station and then Nagisa eats them, but what exactly makes a dango a dango and why is there a ""big dango family"" anyway?

3215,Questions about the Korean dubbed Aria series and OPs,"Question 1  I have noticed that in the Korean dub version of the Aria series, the OP and ED songs are not only subtitled, but are also sung in Korean. How common is it to also dub the OP and ED songs of a not too popular series (cf. EVA, Doraemon)? And does that require more licensing than just subtitling the OPs and EDs?  Question 2  In the Korean dubbed OP of Aria the Animation, why was the Katakana アリア removed? Does this kind of thing happen in other subbed/dubbed anime OPs or EDs?    Original OP animation in the Chinese sub.    Altered art logo in the Korean dub.    Question 3  What is it about the Korean dub version of Aria the Animation that requires a director and editing? In contrast, the Italian staff has: a dubbing director, a coordination, a mixing, a post production and a sound engineer. Is any of these roles synonymous to the director or editing in the Korean staff?   "
3216,Meaning of telegraph code in the song planetes,"The song planetes in Guilty Crown begins with some telegraph encoding, which I think is Wabun code.

3218,What was the original idea for the origin of Goku (if there was)?,"I believe that Toriyama didn't have on start in its mind the idea of Goku's origin being that of a saiyajin alien or even something similar, it doesn't match at all with the concepts shown in the first Dragon ball series.  I know it's based on Sun Wukong from Journey to the West, but I think it's just an inspiration for the character, not that the character origin was going to be the same than that character.  Has Toriyama ever stated what was his original idea for the origin of Goku? If so, which was it? Or didn't he think about that until the Raditz Saga? "
3219,Long shot: ID an Anime Series,"Right off the top, going to apologize for the lack of description here... Really hoping someone might be able to take a stab and I'll be able to find this lost gem.  About 3 Years ago, I used Hulu plus and watched random anime. There was one series I watched I really liked, and want to continue to seek out... but I cannot even remember the name.  I want to say it had something to do with ""Seven"".... Seven samurai perhaps? Seven stones? but that brings nothing to searches.  So really, all I know is that one season streamed on Hulu plus, and I don't believe it is streaming any longer. and honestly, I don't even remember much more than that. It was not dubbed (subtitles English), though it may exist as a dub and I wouldn't mind.  I believe it was produced by the same company that produced Blue Exorcist (Aniplex?). It did have a similar animation style. But I see nothing like it on Aniplex lists...  I also vaguely remember a large stone he carried around that could talk... I think it was a demon trapped? This demon could sense other demons nearby, and the main character had some power that allowed him to see and fight these demons... (Gee, that limits it down, I know)  Any help? "
3220,Why couldn't Eren Yeager transform into a Titan in the last episode of season 2?,"In the last episode of season 2, named ""Scream"", Eren Yeager was unable to transform into a Titan to save Hannes from the Smiling Titan.  Why couldn't he transform?  I don't really read the manga, although I do look at it from time to time.  Has there already been an explanation for this in the manga? "
3221,What's the difference between Telesma and Mana?,"In the A certain magical index there are 2 forms of power energies, ""Telesma"" and ""Mana"". What's the difference between them? Can Mana be used only for magicians? "
3222,In the Zoldyck family is something known about the grandmother and the grandgrandfather?,"it is known that there are 10 members in the Zoldyck family. But do you know something about the grandgrandfather and the grandmother? Zeno Zoldyck is the grandfather. But father of who he is? From the father or mother of Killua. I think it's from Silva Zoldyck (the father) But in the episode Gon, Kurapika and Leorio go to find Killua, Killua's mother calls him father. Then how to know who the father really is? "
3223,How does Lelouch manage to contain his Geass?,"I've recently just finished Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion, now I've started R2. As much as I've started to love this, I noticed one little thing that I can't quite put my finger on. (I haven't heard anything in the anime about it either.)   I was led to believe that he was still unable to control his Geass (assumption based on how the first season ended), yet when he's around Milly, Shirley etc., it appears he has it under control?  Am I missing something? "
3224,Why are level 0 espers considered espers if they have no powers at all?,Supposedly level 0 espers have no powers at all. Are they any different to humans then? Are they supposed to have latent powers or something?

3226,Why did Accelerator turn into an angel?,"In the last episode of season 3 of the anime A certain magical index, Accelerator who is an esper turned into an angel. Why did this happen? Can he do this at will? "
3227,How powerful is the piercing feature of Misaka Mikoto's railgun esper power?,"In the first episode of A certain scientific railgun, Misaka Mikoto is seen to pierce and explode a car with her railgun power. I believe I heard or read somewhere that her railgun goes as fast as match 3 (about 1 km/s) . If I recall correctly, real military railguns being developed by the US military are said to go as fast as 3 km/s and being able to pierce and pass through a tank with easy. How powerful is the piercing feature of Misaka Mikoto's railgun esper power? Is this further shown or mentioned? "
3228,Why couldn't Otonashi of Angel Beats pass on?,"Everyone in the anime 'passes on' after coming to peace with the life they used to have, except for Otonashi. Unless I'm really confused, Angel seemed to imply that the reason Otonashi couldn't pass on is because when Otanashi was alive, he was an organ donor who gave away his heart.  This explanation doesn't make sense to me. Does that mean that all organ donors are stuck in limbo like Otonashi?  Why couldn't Otonashi find peace/pass on to the next life? "
3229,What happened to Naruto's Six Paths Sage Mode?,"In The Last: Naruto the Movie,      Naruto appears fighting Toneri using Tailed Beast Mode with Sage Mode. What happened to his stronger form (Six Paths Sage Mode)!? Did he lose it?    "
3230,"Why is it both ""Mai"" and ""My"" used for the title?","When we look at the title for Mai-HiME and Mai-Otome it's written in 2 ways   Mai-HiME/Otome My-HiME/Otome   We can see this in Manga Updates, My Anime List, Anime Planet and Wikipedia where either they list the alternate names showing both Mai and My to making a choice between My or Mai.  When we look at the list of Associated names on Manga Updates it shows   舞-HiME Dancing Princess Mai HiME My HiME My Princess My-HiME Princess Mai   considering that one of the characters (the main one in Mai-HiME) is Tokiha Mai and the Japanese used for the title is 舞-HiME with google translate showing 舞 is pronounced as ""mai"" which it translates to ""dance"", the associated names have different 3 different meanings   Possession of a Princess/Hime Referring to Mai as a Princess/Hime matching the google translation of 舞 (mai)   I am wondering why does sites associate ""My"" and ""Mai"" for the title? to me it seems both ""My"" and ""Mai"" give the title different meanings "
3231,Why was Kid sailing in Thriller Bark?,"At episode 629 and in chapter 700 we could see how Eustass Kid was sailing a smaller version of the Thriller Bark. Since Gekko Moriah has supposedly died, why is Eustass sailing his ship? What is the connection between any of the alliance and Moriah?  Im not completely sure whether this information is canon as the name is not written in the manga, but I doubt Toei didn't confirm such major news with Oda first. So what gives?     "
3232,Was there a time skip on episode 2 of Tokyo Ghoul Season 2?,"I just notice that Touka has changed and became more mature. Her surroundings, including Hide who has a part time job, have also changed/became more mature. How many years have passed? Does anyone know? "

Are there any prospective plans for the Movie to air in US theaters too? or is it exclusive to japan?  "
3234,Parasyte anime 20 years after the manga finished - Why?,"My question is Why?  Most manga that have anime adaptions get them while they are still on-going (even if the manga ends during the initial anime run.)  Can anyone give/think of a reason why they suddenly made this after 20 years?  Edit: Glad they did though, its might be my favourite anime. "
3235,Which manga is this smiling man from?,"  I can't seem to find this anywhere I've looked.  All I remember is that:   This man is a deity or demon of some sort.  He threatened the villagers not to come near his mountain, but it turned out that he found a baby and wanted to raise it there.  The baby grew in to a man, and soon he fell in love with a lady who loved him back. However, the villagers didn't like that, and because of a jealous villager, they killed them both. Years have passed and the deity/demon found them reincarnated and married with a son.   Does anyone know which manga is this from? "
3236,Who are the twins in Episode 1 of Durarara!!x2 Shou?,"At first, I didn't notice this part because I was too focused on Celty and Shinra's ""lovey-dovey upgrade"", until my friend told me about this part...   They are making something weird, or should we call it a weapon - right there on the table?  What I want to ask is, are they assassins? Or do they have another identity besides being obsessed with Yuhei-sama ?   "
3237,"What is the purpose of the weird gender swaps of certain Sabers they throw in in ""Fate/Apocrypha""?","In Fate/Zero and Fate/Stay Night, while Saber was referred to as 'king', she was always a woman.  However, watching Fate/Apocrypha, we bring in Saber of Red:       Mordred, who keeps saying they are King Arthur's (who is still the woman from Zero and Stay Night) 'son'.   The above character even refers to King Arthur as father and calls themselves 'his' son...   I don't get it... why did they gender swap these characters to women, just to have them refer to themselves as men (father, son, etc...). What did they want the audience to do with this? Is there any purpose to this? "
3238,A manga about a girl helping demons but can't touch anyone because of it?,"I remember a scene where a boy is riding a bicycle (?) and he runs into a girl. They both take a tumble, but when he goes to check on her, she is more worried about him. I believe she takes in or helps demons that the guy can't see. For each one she helps, she becomes more powerful, but the power is misfortune (?), I believe.  There is another scene where the demons are checking on the guy when he's taking a bath, and the demons are telling the girl they have seen him naked just to embarrass her.  I recall that she also helps a demon that is a store mascot (?), possibly a panda, and he joins her group. The demons learn that he does a ritual of some sort or has a charm that prevents them for doing any harm. "
3239,Weren't the names in Edolas and Earthland the same?,"As in like Lucy, Wendy, Natsu and all, their edolas friends had the same name. How come, then, that Makarov and Gerrard were different? There are official sources (can't remember where I saw that) that their Edo-characters were named ""Faust"" and Mystogan repectively. What makes these 2 different than everyone else, whose Edo-name was the same? (Natsu, cana, lucy, elfman, sugarboy, hughes, coco, etc.) "
3240,What did Kiritsugu do when he left Fuyuki?,"During Shirou's recollection of Kiritsugu at the start of Fate/Stay Night (Visual Novel, after Rin's Prologue) Shirou says that Kiritsugu went overseas and sometimes didn't return for months.  What exactly was Kiritsugu doing? Did he resume the job he had before he fought in the 4th Holy Grail War? "
3241,What are this headwing that appear after Sailor Moon/Sailor Chibi Moon transforming?,"At first, neither Sailor Moon nor Sailor Chibi Moon have headwing.    When Sailor Moon first uses the Holy Grail to do the Super transformation, both of them receive headwings, or whatever these thingies are called:     When the Super transformation ends, Sailor Moon loses her headwing. She gets them back each time she uses the Holy Grail or Pegasus' power to Super transform. But for some reason Sailor Chibi Moon can keep them indefinitely, even in her normal transformation.    What are these headwings, do they have any power? Why can Sailor Chibi Moon keep them in her non-Super transform? Does this mean that her normal transform becomes a partial Super transform, and thus is enhanced with some powers? "
3242,"Why does Satsuki address everyone using ""kisama""?","I'm rewatching Kill La Kill and I've noticed that the word ""kisama"" is used by every one of the bad guys (Student Council, Satsuki Kiryuin, Ragyo, and so on) to address basically every good character (i.e. Ryuuko, Mako, her family, etc.).   I know that in the Japanese language there are multiple different ways to address another person depending on the level of familiarity you have with them and so on, and I know that ""kisama"" is the most impolite way of addressing anybody (and it's usually translated as ""bastard"" or something like that when it's used).  My question is: why does Satsuki Kiryuin use ""kisama"" to address the Elite Four? They should, at least, be worthy of a bit more of respect. Was it a stylistic choice that Satsuki would address virtually everyone (with few exceptions such as the butler and Iori, for example) in such a disrespectful way, or is there a different meaning for ""kisama"" I'm not aware of? "
3243,Why is there a curfew for students in Academy City?,"In A Certain Scientific Railgun, it's mentioned several times that there is a curfew for students in Academy City. Why is this so? Is this ever explained? "
3244,What is the context of this Hunter x Hunter reference in Inou Battle manga chapter 2?,"In chapter 2 of Inou Battle wa Nichijou-kei no Naka de manga adaptation, we can see that the middle panel makes a reference to Dragon Ball's meme ""It's over 9000!"". The line was actually ""It's over 8000!"" in the original Japanese manga, and this explains why Andou only counts up to 8000. The censored word is Scouter, which is the device to measure power level.    However, I don't recognize the reference on the left most panel. Searching for the censored word reveals that it is Menthuthuyoupi from Hunter x Hunter. However, I don't read the manga, so I don't understand the reference.  Which scene from Hunter x Hunter does this reference come from? And what is the context that makes it worth referenced by another author? "
3245,Can Arrancar never fully remove their masks?,"On Season 10, when Nnoitra thinks back to when he fought Nel last time (when he broke her mask), he got her to fight by hurting Pesche and Dondochakka. Seeing them, Nel said that Nnoitra had ripped off their masks. However, Pesche and Dondochakka are Fracción and thus Arrancar, so their masks have already been removed.  Can Arrancar not fully removed their masks? If not, then how is Nnoitra ripping off Pesche's and Dondochakka's so bad that it was enough to bait Nel into a fight? "
3246,"What do I have to watch before watching ""Reflection""?","Which of the Nanoha TV series and movies do I have to watch before watching the third movie (""Reflection"")?   I assume that the first season and ""A's"" are a necessity, given that ""Reflection"" appears to be a sequel to the first two movies (which themselves follow the plot of the first season and ""A's""). What about ""StrikerS"" and ""ViViD""?   Also, do the first two movies diverge from the first two seasons in any significant way that would necessitate I watch them before ""Reflection""?   (Please place any spoilers in spoiler blocks.) "
3247,Why does Shiori Momono keep looking at Kakeru Satsuki in the 11eyes Anime?,"The question I have about the character Shiori Momono from the 11eyes Anime and Manga is why does she keep staring at Kakeru Satsuki in the anime?  ?  I have to say, I've seen a lot of mysterious characters in Anime before, and in my opinion, she is another mysterious female character, almost like all the rest. "
3248,What is spinning a girl in yukata like a top a reference to?,"     From left to right, top to bottom: Nisemonogatari, Midori no Hibi, Is the Order a Rabbit? and Mawaru-Penguindrum.  In the case of Midori no Hibi, why is Midori calling Seiji ""governor""? Is this a reference to something? "
3249,Calm music played after pain destroyed leaf village,"I have been searching for this music for long time, but couldn't find one, what is the music at time 20.51  when pain destroys the leaf village and everybody are rising after destruction, it's a music like a lady is singing.  This music also played when kaguya first appeard at time 1.30 "
3250,Does each Kaioshin have their own God of Destruction?,"In Dragon Ball Super, it is told that Gods of Destruction and Supreme Kais come in pairs, so if a Supreme Kai dies, Beerus also dies. What about the other Kaioshin? West Kaioshin, North Kaioshin, South Kaioshin , Grand Supreme Kai, Elder Kai, Gowasu, Zamasu, shouldn't they have or get Gods of Destruction?   And what about Kaioshin students who later on become Kaioshins, do they have a God of Destruction when they are born or when they are upgraded to Kaioshins? How does it work? "
3251,What is the context of this reference to Chrollo Lucilfer in Inou Battle manga chapter 1?,"In chapter 1 of Inou Battle wa Nichijou-kei no Naka de manga adaptation, Andou made a reference to Phantom Troupe's leader Chrollo Lucilfer from Hunter x Hunter series, as pointed out by Tomoyo. (Note the matching cross-shaped tattoo on his forehead).  What scene from Hunter x Hunter is being referenced here? And what is the context of that scene?   "
3252,Why can't Sasuke use Tsukuyomi even after implanting Itachi's eyes?,"The manga makes it plenty clear that Sasuke can/does not use Tsukuyomi. Both his eyes have powers related to Amaterasu only. But why? Madara and Kakashi could use Kamui using Obito's eyes and Danzo could use KotoAmatsukami using Shisui's eyes. Then why not Sasuke? We have seen that during fight with Kabuto, he uses ordinary sharingan genjutsu on Itachi when freeing him from Kabuto's sound genjutsu.  Does this mean that once you achieve your own MS powers, implanting someone else's eyes does not grant you their power but just give you EMS?  Does the eye transplant work differently for non-Uchihas, as in they just gain the original eye power?  But this still does not explain Madara's using Kamui.  Edit: People seem to be confused about the fact that Sasuke can NOT use Tsukuyomi. Here is the detailed answer I wrote: [website]Here is a Tsukuyomi wiki that clearly states the only user is Uchiha Itachi "
3253,Which are the five manga series that are based off the Toaru Majutsu no Index franchise?,"According to Toaru Kagaku no Accelerator     Toaru Kagaku no Accelerator (とある科学の一方通行アクセラレータ Toaru Kagaku no Ippō Tsūkō?, lit., A Certain Scientific Accelerator) is the fifth manga series that is based off the Toaru Majutsu no Index franchise   Which are them? Aside of Toaru Kagaku no Accelerator and Toaru Kagaku no Railgun? "
3254,"Is this an animation error, or just bizarre character design?","While rewatching The Flowers of Evil, I noticed this character in episode 2:    The character on the left struck me as very odd - she's wearing braids (which would normally suggest a female character), but she also has sideburns, which seem to be more or less only something men wear. (I'm assuming the character is female from the voice actor who plays at that moment.) Moreover, if the character weren't female, it would be odd for a school to allow him to wear braids.  Reddit suggests that this character also appears in the manga, so is this just intentional character design, rather than an error in the art? If so, who is this character, and is there anything (e.g. personality traits) that might explain this odd hairstyle? (I have not read the manga yet, and so can't easily look this up.)  Update: I remembered seeing some video footage of the live-action filming that the rotoscoped animation was apparently from on YouTube, so I might try to dig that out to see if I can get a better idea of what's going on here. On a second glance the braids struck me as a bit odd in terms of the shaping of their ends (one usually expects the hair to thin out somewhat and possibly curve a bit), so it occurred to me that this might be useful.  Update 2: After reading the entire manga, I couldn't find a character with identical design. (From the uniform -- notice that the character here wears a bow, instead of a tie -- it seems certain that they're probably female.) However, I did notice a presumably female character with very short hair (for a girl) that was in the corresponding chapater of the manga. I don't remember if the character was wearing a female uniform but will look it up later when I have time. "
3255,Why does Akiha have a physical reaction to Shiki's collapse?,"In chapter 36 of the Tsukihime manga, Akiha doubles over in pain while Shiki is collapsing at the site of the incident eight years ago. The pacing and a remark from Akiha indicating worry for Shiki imply that this is related to Shiki's collapse.    Why would Akiha have a physical reaction to Shiki's collapse? I do not recall seeing any indication of the two being linked physically or mentally in the way Shiki and SHIKI are. (Shiki eventually sees murders from SHIKI's eyes. We don't see Akiha undergo the same experiences as Shiki in this maner.) Alternatively, am I misunderstanding what happens here? "
3256,How Naruto can be a jinchuuriki if his mother is still alive?,"Inside the Infinite Tsukuyomi world, Naruto's parents are still alive, but Naruto is still a jinchuuriki. How is that even possible?  Even for an Uzumaki, extraction means death, so why would Minato transfer the Nine Tails to their son? Can someone explain what's going on here? "
3257,Why does Sasuke still have the Rinnegan?,"Hagoromo took back his Yin and Yang chakra from Sasuke and Naruto respectively (in chapter 690). So if the Yin chakra was responsible for the Rinnegan development in Sasuke's eye, why didn't it change back into his original eye after the chakra was taken back? Why does it become permanent? "

3261,Ending of The Adventures of Hutch the Honeybee,"The Adventures of Hutch the Honeybee was aired when I was a child, but I never know its ending. MyAnimeList said that it was aired in Japan from 1970 to 1971, but it was aired in my country around the end of the '90s or early 2000s I think.  So, how did the anime end? Did he reunite with his mom? Does someone know? "
3262,Will Philly the Kid die when he'll have no more skin to be tattooed?,"Philly the Kid is the main character of the original net anime, Cannon Busters (YouTube trailer), who has tattoos on his body.  Will Philly the Kid die when he'll have no more skin to be tattooed? What will happen then? Will he die permanently? "
3263,How did Madara fake his death during his battle with Hashirama?,Did Madara use Izanagi or Izanami and if yes then how did he have two Rinnegans? If someone uses Izanagi their sharingan gets destroyed right? If he used Izanagi then he should have only one sharingan left and then that evolved into Rinnengan. How does he have two Rinnengans? 
3264,Can someone explain the story of Space Battleship Yamato 2199?,I understand that Yurisha was sent to earth to deliver the construction plans for the wave motion engine and also Sasha to give them the wave motion power core but why did they do it separately? I mean Yurisha also could have delivered the plans together with the core...  The Gamilas empire expands and exterminates many other planets not only the earth. So why would Starsha want to help humanity? Moreover she and her 2 sisters are the only 3 remaining of her species. Also what would happen if the earth gets restored? The Gamilas just would have continued their attacks and bombs. If the Yamato didn't save the capital of Gamilas and killed their leader the earth would be still attacked sooner or later by the empire. But Starsha couldn't know that this would happen so her plan to help the humans and risk the lives of her sisters doesn't make much sense to me. 
3265,Is there an episode of A Certain Scientific Railgun which is identical to an episode of A Certain Magical Index?,"I'm watching episode 11 of season 2 of A Certain Scientific Railgun and I'm certain most of it is almost identical to an episode of A Certain Magical Index, probably from season 1 (though not sure) . It's the episode where Misaka meets Touma in the soda machine, they stole the cans, they meet a Misaka sister clon, etc. Is this so? Are the 2 episodes identical with the same animation and everything or are they different in parts? "
3266,What piano piece is Emil Nekola skating to in his short program?,"In episode 8 of Yuri!!! on Ice, Emil Nekola skates his short program to a piano piece. (This is around the eight-minute mark in the episode.) The music sounded like a classical work that I have heard before, but I was unable to place it. The most I have been able to gather is that if this is indeed a classical composition, it would have to be from the Romantic period in music at the earliest. (I also have a sense of which composers wouldn't have written something like this, but that's less useful.)  Is the music in Emil's short program an original composition? If not, what is its title and composer? "
3267,Is Hidan still alive?,"From what I recall, Hidan's head was buried deep inside a hole in the Konoha Forbidden Jungle.  Does it mean that Hidan is still alive after all this year? Is it possible for someone to rescue him and bring him back if he is still alive? "

The terms were for Eizan to stop destroying the Polar Star Dorm, but does Souma get to also usurp Eizan's position in the Elite 10 as the no. 9 spot (I believe Eizan is number 9 but not sure) because he beat him in a shokugeki? Or is there not enough information to answer? "
3273,Are Pluton and Uranus weapons too?,"During Fishman arc, it was told that there used to be three weapons – Pluton, Uranus, and Poseidon.  We already know Poseidon is Shirahoshi, then what about Pluton and Uranus? And if those are weapons, then are they related to Void Century or way past from that time like Garden of Eden time? "

3275,What devil fruits and their users that are able to fly?,"In the Alabasta Arc, Pell said that there are only 5 known flying devil fruits.       Pell: You're lucky to see this. Only five flying devil fruits are known to exist   What are these ""5 known flying devil fruits"" and who are their current users?   Apart from the 5 known, did they discover new flying devil fruits?  Note: I'm only talking about the ""real flying devil fruit"". What I mean here by ""real"" is like Pel who can naturally fly unlike others who uses their creativity in order to ""fly"", example of this is       Doflamingo.  "
3276,How did Nagato choose the paths of Pain?,"Potential Spoilers for the events Season 6-8 of Naruto Shippuden   In the Jiraiya vs Pain fight we get the following information.      Konan is a former student of Jiraiya, who is also the Angel of Amegkure and Pain who has the Rinnegan is the leader who defeated Hanzo. During the fight we learn of the six Paths of Pain, each who uses a different unique abilities while sharing their field of vision. Jiraiya was confused how could six people have the Rinnegan when only Nagato had it.   This is the setup for the sequence of the events leading into the next season.      Jiraiya recognises Yahiko, and then the body of pain that he pulls into the toad. He then decides to go back out and realises that ALL the paths of pain are Ninjas he'd seen/met before. And then the realization ""The real one is not among them."" This confuses me since we know Nagato can make any dead person a path of pain (the new Animal Path), Why would he chose those particular individuals that Jiraiya knows? Infact how did he know Jiraiya knows them?   And thus the question, How/Why did Nagato choose the ""Paths"" of Pain?  Additional Info: He chooses the following paths of pain      the 5 shinobi that Jiraiya encountered during his journey: The Puppeteer, The Waterfall shinobi, The Fuma clan shinobi, The Grass Shinobi, The Priest. The sixth path i.e. Yahiko seems obvious due to their connection. But again using the other 5 seems very coincidental.  "
3277,What are the objects that eat Devil Fruits?,"In the Alabasta arc, Mr.4 has a dog that shoots out an exploding ball, but Miss Merry Christmas said that it was actually a gun that ""ate"" a devil fruit.    Are there other inanimate objects that ""eat"" Devil Fruits?  If there is, then what object is it and what Devil Fruit did they ""eat""? "
3278,Why was Luffy never offered a Shichibukai position?,"I recall that a shichibukai needs to have quite a good bounty, and be very strong. So why was Luffy never offered the position? I mean his second bounty was higher than Crocodile and Hancock, so if we say he offended the World Government in the Enies Lobby arc, then before that, he was eligible, and even afterwards, we can't say he's not eligible; let's not forget Doflamingo threatened tenrybito with revealing some information, and his status was not revoked.

3279,Did Kakashi use genjutsu before the end of the Fourth Shinobi War?,"When you have the Sharingan, you can perform a genjutsu on a person for example, every Uchiha can use this ability. But what about Kakashi? He is not an Uchiha but can he perform genjutsu? If yes, please list it down.  Note: I'm not referring to after the Fourth Shinobi World War, since we know that after the war, Kakashi doesn't have the Sharingan. "
3280,Is this fluffy thing a rabbit?,"In Gochuumon wa Usagi Desuka?, Tippy, the creature on top of Chino's head, is introduced to be a rabbit.  Is it in any possible way a rabbit in real life, or is it just another RidiculouslyCuteCritter?   "
3281,What is the Hitotsubashi faction?,"It was clear that they were a traitorous faction within the Shogunate. In Gintama' episode 16, it's stated by Sougo that it's basically known that the Hitotsubashi were behind some bad stuff, but if they were called out for it, they could cause a lot of trouble for Shigeshige. But if they're only a part of the Shogunate, how could they have enough power to overthrow it, and how would that not be noticed?  In the same episode, Sougo says the Bakufu/Shogunate doesn't want any trouble with the Hitotsubashi. So if they're so dangerous, why weren't they taken out already? Just what kind of powerful organization are they?  I'm just having trouble understanding the premise of the Hitotsubashi. "
3282,Why did Eren survive getting eaten?,"Why did Eren survive when he was eaten by the titan during the battle of Trost? Why didn't that titan gain his titan abilities too? There hasn't been another example of a Titan Shifter being eaten in their human form and surviving.   Furthermore,       when Armin ate Bertolt he absorbed him and returned to normal immediately.   And when Eren was eaten no one saw him transform and break out of the titan, meaning the titan had enough time to walk away from Armin.  Is this an oversight? "
3283,How and how much do the dolls know about the other dolls?,"Preface: This is coming entirely from the anime’s perspective and yet without the 2013 one, which I've only started watching.  We are introduced to Shinku, Hina-Ichigo, Suigintou, Suiseiseki and Souseiseki in the first season in order of appearance. Bara-Suishou and Kanaria are introduced in the first and third episodes of Träumend, respectively. During episode 1 of Träumend, Shinku explicitly refers to herself as the fifth Rozen Maiden doll, and Bara-Suishou answers to the seventh.  In episode 1 of the OVA Ouvertüre, we learn that Shinku then only knew about three Rozen Maiden dolls at the time of Ouvertüre. However, for some reason, she knows that there should be seven. Also in that episode, Shinku gets to know Suigintou for the first time.      She finds out, that Suigintou is broken and initially does not even have a Rosa Mystica thus concluding that she shouldn’t be a Rozen Maiden. However in the second OVA episode, Suigintou has been restored after defeat and granted a Rosa Mystica, obviously making her a true Rozen Maiden.   In episode 12 of Träumend, we learn that      Bara-Suishou was not an original Rozen Maiden but rather an Enju Maiden being crafted by a different doll maker. It is not clearly revealed as far as I can tell whether she has a Rosa Mystica but she cannot cope with winning the Alice game and thus the other six girls’ Rosa Mysticas, possibly because she is not pure enough. In any case, the situation is restored to a pre-Alice-game situation where only those dolls defeated by Rozen Maidens stay defeated: Hina-Ichigo and Souseiseki (by Shinku and Suigintou).   I conclude from these facts, that Bara-Suishou is quite a bit younger than the other dolls.   Therefore, the dolls must somehow know that there are seven of them but not who they are until they met each other.   Why did they know that they must be seven? How and why did they know the how many-th doll they are?     How was it possible that none of the six met the seventh proper Rozen Maiden in the over 100 years that they had been living and fighting all over the world, so that they all assumed Bara-Suishou to be the proper seventh?      Shouldn’t there have been any clues for the other dolls that Bara-Suishou is ‘non-canonical’? E.g. the scene at the end of Träumend 10 where they meet Enju and call him father.   "
3284,Why didn't Bell level up?,"When Bell fought the monster on level 18, he was so much out of its league that I figured that would gain at least two levels. But no, he stayed level 2.   To level up in Is It Wrong to Pick up Girls in a Dungeon?, you have to be on an ""adventure."" An adventure was never properly defined but it was presented as winning a tough situation that needed you to go 110%. When Bell fought the minotaur, it was way stronger than him but he made it, so he leveled up.   Then, why didn't he level up after the fight on level 18?  "
3285,Is Yichang Shengwu Jianwen Lu anime?,"Yichang Shengwu Jianwen Lu is listed and shown in a lot of anime websites. But is it anime? It clearly is in chinese, why is it consider it anime then? Was it animated in Japan or something? Is its animation style anime-like? Or what?. "
3286,Why did Amane Suzuha have to plead to Okabe for saving Makise Kurisu instead of her doing it by herself?,"In Steins;Gate, Amane Suzuha pleaded to Okabe so bad to go back to the past and save Makise Kurisu.  Why didn't she go back to the past to save Makise Kurisu? Why did Okabe have to be the one to save Kurisu? "
3287,What does the dialog related to Nanami's quote in the last episode of Bokura Ga Ita mean?,"In the last scene of the final episode of Bokura Ga Ita (ep. 26), Yano repeats a quote that Nanami made in an earlier episode. The quote was      ""it all equals out"".   In the earlier episode, where the quote originated, Nanami was explaining to Yano how      he may not have anyone he loves, but there are people who really love him and thus ""shouldn't it all equal out?""   Now, back to the final scene. He repeats the quote      ""it all equals out"" and questions it. He says, ""it didn't all equal out,"" and that ""it ended up more equal...on the positive side.""   I've watched two different translations of the scene and I am still confused. I originally thought it was basically saying      'you love no one, but someone loves you a lot, so it equals out', so I'm not understanding the ""sides"".   What exactly is ""the positive side""? Did he simply just mean      I loved no one, Nanami loved me dearly, and it ended up being on the ""side"" of me loving Nanami?   Or is there more to it?    Note that this isn't a question about ""how it ended"". This is a question about the literal meaning of the final lines in the anime. I suspect it might be something lost in translation. "
3288,What does the twin witch pair in 'Spirited Away' represent?,"This is how I interpret the story of Spirited Away:   The bathhouse represents the society. People work with each other towards a common goal. Every night, 8 million gods come to the bathhouse and workers serve them, worship them. In a way they deal with them, do business with them. In Asian cultures, fire, air, earth, water, food, etc. are represented as gods, so bathhouse very accurately represents a working society. The 'spell' breaks if they stop working. Yubaba is the culture. She manages the bathhouse. She is a tyrant and rules over people by taking their real names and giving them new names. Chihiro was given a new name by Yubaba, 'Sen', which means 'one thousand', similar to how a person is given a roll number or employee number in an organisation. That number becomes her new identity. Haku has forgotten his real name. Similar to Islamic terrorists, he's become a slave to the tyrannical culture. He'll do anything the culture tells him to do. The baby is the belief system of the society. Yubaba is overly protective of him.   One thing I can't understand is, who is Zeniba, Yubaba's twin sister.   Yubaba and Zeniba are two parts of a whole. Yubaba keeps the baby locked in a room, afraid that he might get sick because of germs. Zeniba turned the baby into a mouse so that he might have a little freedom. Zeniba lives in the swamp bottom. There used to be trains running between the bathhouse and the swamp bottom in old days, but the return trains from the swamp bottom have stopped. Now it's a one-way road towards the swamp bottom. The tickets to the swamp bottom Kamaji gave to Chihiro had been with him for 40 years. 'Zeni' has two meanings in Japanese, 'money' and 'ancient'. 'ba' means 'old lady'. The meaning of Zeniba which seems to fit the story is 'ancient old lady'. Yubaba wanted to steal a seal from Zeniba, which was supposedly very precious.   So what do Yubaba and Zeniba represent in this story? It looks like they might represent:   culture and nature tyranny and individuality life and death interdependence and self reliance   but none of these seem to elegently fit all the points I've mentioned above. "
3289,Why no one else used Conqueror's Haki?,"In Marineford, there were other people than Luffy who had Conqueror's Haki (Whitebeard, Hancock, etc.). Why didn't they use it when Ace was about to get beheaded? Because if Luffy did not use it unknowingly, Ace would have died sooner. Or was it the case that no one had Conqueror's Haki as powerful as Luffy's which could act at a large distance? "
3290,Are the chicks and devils that appear on character's heads an allegory for their state of mind?,"In the manga and the anime series, sometimes a devil pops up from Izumi's head, and chickens from Wakana's head.  Izumi's devils seem an obvious allegory for the effects of       Sexual arousal on his private parts   But I am not sure about Wakana Ui's chickens.  Are those devils and chickens an allegory for their mental state? What is the meaning of Wakana Ui's chickens? "
3291,Why are ghouls' eyes red?,"Is there a particular reason why ghouls' eyes are red? (called 'kakugan' based on my research).    There might be a reason provided by the writer, which I cannot research as it may only be available in Japanese. (I am thinking that it may be due to the color of blood?) "
3292,"What exactly the demons gain from their ""contracts"", and how do they ""level up"" from executing contracts?","It seems that it is an routine after-school endeavour for the Gremory to be summoned through their flyers to do devilish stuff like foot massages and claim the dead as their pawns.  Aside from the summon shown in Ep. 1 (when Rias is summoned to claim her Pawn) and the paiting Azazel gives Issei, there are not shown in the anime what rewards the demons gain. It is mentioned towards the end of the second season that Gaspar makes the most out of contracts than any of them.  What do they get from these demonic contracts? And how exactly does fulfilling contracts help a demon rank up?    Side note: I have only watched the anime, but answers are encouraged to come from all media. "

3294,How works the eleventh water breathing technique?,In the last episode (20) you see Giyu Tomioka use an eleventh breath technique. He stopped the blood threates without doing anything. So how does it work? And it was said that there were only 10. So why didn't Tanjiro know about this? 
3295,What is the song that plays in Naruto Shippuden when Deidara fights Gaara?,I've been searching for that song for a really long time but I can't find it. It's kinda sad (?? for me at least) and it has a violin or cello or something like that. 
3296,Did Trunks SSJ2 become much stronger after the sparring with SSJ3 Goku?,"Before Trunks became super saiyan rage (super saiyan hikari), he had a battle where he was able to hold, hit and take apart Black Goku super saiyan rosé from super saiyan blue Goku. How was this possible? We know by that moment Black Goku super saiyan rose was stronger than Goku Super saiyan blue, which is a transformation stronger than super saiyan god, which is a transformation stronger than SSJ3, which is a transformation stronger than SSJ2.   In the manga Toyotaro made SSJ2 Trunks to be ""mastered"" and become as strong as SSJ3 Goku, but in the anime, Goku SSJ3 Goku knocked with one punch SSJ2 Trunks (even though Beerus commented Trunks was a good fighter) . Did Trunks become much stronger after this, because of a zenkai boost or something? Did his sparring later with super saiyan blue Vegeta and the mental training he had made his SSJ2 much stronger (to the point where he could fight in SSJ2 against Black Goku SSJ Rosé) or is there any other explanation to the situation of SSJ2 being able to fight SSJ Rosé? "
3297,Why is Big Mom afraid of Shanks?,Why is Big Mom afraid of Shanks? Is it because of his ultimate Haki? Or is it because of the fact that he even survived after clashing with Edward Newgate and getting in a war with Kaido? 
3298,Why don't anime seasons have a standard amount of episodes?,"Anime seasons are generally 12/13 episodes long. There are quite a number of exceptions though, where more or fewer episodes are fitted into the same timeslots. Most notably, however, a season can have 11,12 or 13 episodes a season. I've seen this discrepancy occur regularly.  I would have thought that keeping the episode amount standard is good for keeping the seasons aligned &mdash; 52 weeks in a year / 4 seasons in a year = 13 episodes per season. The variant I see most is 12 episodes at a time or 12 episodes with a bonus DVD-only OVA. What do they do with the 1 week gap?  Do stations plan their seasons far enough in advance to make it even out overall? What if a show is cancelled?  Why does this anomaly exist? Surely it makes it awkward to schedule TV. "
3299,Where and how was Diavolo hiding where he was after the body swaps of Silver Chariot Requiem?,"I don't understand the rules of the body/soul swap and where Diavolo was hiding during the soul swapping shenaniegans of Silver Chariot Requiem.    Was Diavolo apparently hiding inside King Crimson who was attached as a summonable stand of Trish (along with Spice Girl)? If so this raises many other questions for me of such as Why is it that King Crimson attached to Trish? Could King Crimson have happened have been attached to Trish, but could've been attached to anyone else as well? I would have assumed the stand to have been attached to the mind/soul as has been the case for the other swaps. Why is Diavolo's ""soul"" inside King Crimson , a stand rather than a regular physical body like the other swaps (albeit Polnaroff is in a turtle transport macguffin that has stand...?) Why didn't other souls get put into stands e.g. Giorno is inside Foo Fighters the airplane stand? My memory is foggy but I feel the question could be asked about how chaotic you want to make your swaps, does every bullet in Sex Pistols count of a potential body then?   Or is it the case that split personality thing made it so Trish and Diavolo mind/soul was in the Mista physical body she was inhabiting, and that King Crimson just has an innate perk of letting Diavolo inhabit it? "
3300,Do Mob and Saitama live in the same universe?,"In a former question it was pointed Mob appears in a cover photo of a One Punch Man manga. Does Mob appear in One Punch Man? . But also apparently Tatsumaki appears in a Mob Psycho manga (I've seen the anime but I havent read the manga), in an apparent scene of the manga itself, not a cover Tatsumaki in Mob Psycho 100  Do Mob, Tatsumaki and Saitama live in the same universe/planet kinda like Goku and Arale from Dragon Ball / Dr Slump ?

3305,Who are these bunny girls from Gurren Lagann referencing?,"I stumbled over this scene from Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann (EP6) again and realized it contains a lot more references than I initially realized.  The bunny girls seem to reference characters from other Gainax shows. I recgonize some of them as listed below, but for some I have no idea. I'm also not sure which ones are references at all and which ones are just generic; maybe I labelled too many. The labels are consistent over all pictures.        Nono (Diebuster) Asuka (Neon Genesis Evangelion) Lal'C (Diebuster) Mahoro (Mahoromatic) thanks ʞɹɐzǝɹ and Jon Lin Rei (Neon Genesis Evangelion) Probably Anna (He is my master) thanks Jon Lin Aki (Abenobashi) thanks ʞɹɐzǝɹ and Jon Lin Reiko (Gunbuster) thanks Jon Lin Jung (Gunbuster) ? Misato (Neon Genesis Evangelion) Maybe Owner (Ebichu) or Yukino (His and Her Circumstances) thanks Jon Lin A second Jung? Maybe Izumi (He is my master) or Miyuki (Mahoromatic) thanks Jon Lin  "
3306,Who is the magical girl who becomes Walpurgisnacht?,"Since witches are actually magical girls who, when their soul gems are fully tainted, become witches, that means that Walpurgisnacht was a magical girl. Since Madoka in two realities became a witch that could destroy the world/universe, that would mean there was a magical girl who was, at the time, much stronger than Madoka (before Homura's trips to the past compiling Madoka's fate and power).  Which magical girl became Walpurgisnacht? Were they like Madoka, and had their fate compiled from overlapping timelines? "
3307,"What order should the Fairy Tail volumes/chapters be read in? And how to read labelling ""Fairy Tail 465 - 400 Years""?","I've watched up to episode 120 of the Fairy Tail anime and want to start to read the manga, while I finish the anime. I'm quite new to reading manga and know how to read them, it's just working out which one is the first one I find difficult.  I would really like to get the first manga (in the story) for a Christmas present but I don't know which one is first.  I started to read what was listed as the first one on a manga website (Labelled as Fairy Tail 465 - 400 Years) to check if it was and ended up reading the spoiler:      That Natsu is Zeref's brother!   Can someone please help me by telling me which manga I need to read first and what is the order of the others?  And  If possible, Can someone explain the labelling ""Fairy Tail 465 - 400 Years""? so that I know what to look out for in the future, to prevent spoiling it for myself. "
3308,Is Kaoru the first person who had sex with Ritsuko?,"I just finished watching its anime, got curious about its ending, and found out by searching that the last 2 volumes are cramped in the last episode (so they skipped some scene).  I got to know that Ritsuko got a boyfriend when Kaoru was in Tokyo, so Kaoru breaks all his ties with Ritsuko. So I'm wondering if the manga stated if Ritsuko has sex with her boyfriend, because in the anime when Kaoru try to have sex with Ritsuko, she refuses (and that's when Kaoru starts ignoring her).  Is Kaoru the first person who had sex with Ritsuko? Is it ever answered in the manga? "
3309,How is Vash able to transform his arm into a weapon?,"In Trigun, Vash the Stampede is able to transform his arm into a big weapon with which he makes a hole in the moon.

3310,What is this Zabieru Tanegashima character a reference to?,"In chapter 17 of Denki-gai no Hon'ya-san, page 9, a figure of a character called Zabieru Tanegashima appears:      Is this character fictional — as in a character existing only in-universe — or is it based on/a reference to some other series' character? Or is it some other reference to something not anime related? "
3311,What technique did Minato use to separate the Kyuubi into two parts?,"When the Kyuubi attacked the Leaf Village after being hypnotized by Tobi, Minato as a last resort separated the Kyuubi into two parts. Recently in the latest chapters of the manga, it looks like the Kyuubi was separated into Black and White, as in Evil and Good, or Yin and Yang.  What technique did he use? Did he really split the Kyuubi into good and evil halves? Or is it just something made up for the split? "
3312,How was Holo unfair in this argument in volume 9?,"Sometimes I have difficulty understanding Holo and Lawrence's wit, such as in this conversation on pages 48-49 of volume 9 of the light novels:     Holo: Aye, we're all greedy, always running about in service of our own gain.      Lawrence: On that count, I'm forced to agree. Of course...Of course, if I weren't so greedy, I'd be able to buy you tastier food.      Holo: Mm. But is seeing my pleasure not in your interests as well?      Lawrence: If you were truly so easily bribed by food, then that might be so.      Holo: And what other methods could you use?      Lawrence: If food is out, then with words or manners.      Holo: Neither of which is so reliable in your case.      Lawrence: (Quoting Eve) Or you could imagine you've been deceived and decide to trust both. They might well turn out to be genuine.      Holo: That isn't what I meant to say.   They were originally talking about Holo's attempt to get a narwahl, but then it branched off into this conversation.  With line 8, Lawrence feels that he has effectively put Holo in a corner. The text also mentions that line 8 is something Eve previously said. The text then states that Holo has no counterattack. However, when Holo makes her reply with line 9, Lawrence feels like she has done something unfair. I am uncertain as to why Lawrence feels as though he has won, and as to why he feels that Holo was unfair with line 9.  "
3313,What's with the claim that Anna pulled a knife on Nobuko?,"In Ghibli's When Marnie Was There, there's a scene around 27:00 where Anna calls Nobuko a ""fat pig"". Pretty rude, but Nobuko does provoke her quite a bit. Later, around 35:00, Nobuko's mother is complaining about this to Anna's aunt and uncle ... but she also says that Anna pulled a knife on Nobuko! (""Knife"" in the English dub, ""cutter"" in the sub.) I certainly didn't see her do that, nor do I see anything suggesting a scene was cut.  So, what's the deal here? Did Nobuko simply fabricate the whole thing? Seems like a pretty strong accusation to invent ... Nobuko comes off as a jerk, but that's really over the top. Is it a mistranslation? Unfortunately, my ear for spoken Japanese is not up to transcribing what Nobuko's mother says. Also unfortunately, my library system does not have the book the movie was based on. "

What type of person was capable of creating this tablet? "
3316,How can two pucks be used at the same time in air hockey?,"  As we can see, there are two pucks on a single hockey table. They collide and goal. It doesn't look like one came flying from another table. As I know there will be only one puck in a single game on a table. So what is going on in this part? Does air hockey have different gameplay rules in Japan?   What is really going on here? Can someone explain about two pucks at once on a single table?   "
3317,Do Akatsuki rings have abilities?,Each of Akatsuki's members wear unique rings. I guess Itachi's one can use genjutsu.     But how about others? Can it be used as ninjutsu or genjutsu abilities? And why does Zetsu always collect those rings after each one of the members died.

3319,How much does Shalltear love Ainz? (All quotes from the source material),"I just finished season 1 and started the still ongoing season 2 from the anime and I loved Shalltear's character.  Now I wonder, were there any quotes in the light novel where it is shown Shalltear loves Ainz? Either through verbal or physical acts? Like blushing when Ainz's nearby, or fighting Albedo to marry him... I take it that the light novels might include more moments like these than the anime.  It seems that what I've watched so far covers volumes 1-4, so I am mainly looking for occurrences from those 4 volumes. Any other suggestions are still welcome as long as they don't include spoilers. Namely, all quotes are accepted if they don't spoil the story. "
3320,Did Eichiro Oda the first mangaka that make a side-story of certain character in his cover chapter?,"I would like to know if there are other mangakas like Eiichiro Oda who make an illustration cover of a specific chapter to be like a side-story, and it's really like a canon story, even it just a side story, for example, this one:   CP9 Side story Buggy's After battle   Is this really common in manga industry?

Furthermore, Dee has her body (in the outside world) in the final scene. How does Ai managed to ""save"" Alice? Yet at the same time she's standing in front of his grave.   Running through the forums and it seems like I'm not the only one who's confused.    What in the world happened? (no pun intended)  The biggest and undeniable contradiction is Dee going from ghost to normal human. Does this mean that some sort of change of history caused Dee and Alice to ""switch places""? "

3326,Were any of Houkago Tea Time's songs described or referred to in the manga?,"The K-On!! anime features a large number of songs performed by Houkago Tea Time. In addition to staples like ""Gohan wa Okazu""  and ""Fuwa Fuwa Time"", there are a number of other ones that I don't believe ever got playtime in the anime, like ""Watashi no Koi wa Hotchkiss"", to say nothing of the OP/ED themes and their B-sides, plus a ton of character songs (and not just for the main five, but also for Ui, Jun, and Nodoka).   Now, I haven't read the manga, but it's clearly inconceivable that all these dozens of songs could have been described in any substantial way in a mere four volumes of manga. In fact, I have to wonder if any of these songs were even noted as existing in the manga.  Do any of the songs in the anime originate in any way from the manga (even if only by virtue of a shared title or a lyrical excerpt)? If so, which ones?  (Ignore ""Tsubasa wo Kudasai"", which is a cover of a very old song.) "
3327,What is this anime where the girl wears a ribbon wrapping her hair like double helix and wears black dress?,"I saw the trailer of this anime on the Bleach DVD Volume 1, which was featured in the Extras > Trailers. Other anime trailers that were featured on the DVD were for Black Cat, One Piece, Death Note, Eureka 7, Dragon Ball Z remastered and that's all I remember.  For the unknown anime trailer:   The song sounded like j-techno with female singer. I could recalled an English part of the lyrics being ""I need you, I just kiss you, in my life"" Opening sequence shows a nude (?) girl in her early/mid teens with long pale blue hair tiptoed on the water The main character (?) is a boy in his early/mid teens with gold brown hair that is shaped like razors on the sides and wears red clothing    (Image of hair colour, maybe 1 or 2 shades darker) The girl  wears a black dress and has a black/white ribbon wrapped around her hair, kind of like a double helix.   (Almost identical to the image of the girl in the trailer) The main character and the girl seem to be romantically linked, as they are seen holding hands and the girl comforts the boy. Other characters in the trailer are shown one by one with small girl figures popping up behind them. Maybe the little girls are spirits or guardians?   That's all I have for the description, I've tried so long to find out what this anime is and I couldn't find anything related to it except for the picture of the girl. "

Most humans do not know that every person is one of three doppel liners, three people who share the same fate, and that god-like beings called mototsumitama protect the natural balance of power in the world.

3335,Oldest instance of Hanahaki Disease?,"From Fanlore on the topic:     The Hanahaki Disease trope was popularized with the Japanese shoujo manga,「花吐き乙女」(Hanahaki Otome), or The Girl Who Spit Flowers by Naoko Matsuda (松田奈緒子), which was released in 2009. The symptoms of the disease are summarized to strong pain, having flowers blooming in the heart and lungs, and then throwing them up.       However, among East Asian (Japanese and Korean especially) fans and creators, the concept of flower regurgitation due to unrequited love dates to before Hanahaki Otome's release. Its true origins are currently unknown.      Can anyone find an instance earlier than 2009, and maybe find the earliest?  Why am I asking? Because TVTropes is talking about it.  Expect your answers to go there...  And, KnowYourMeme isn't giving me anything about Hanahaki Disease.  Urban Dictionary's entry is like, from 2018? Way too late. "

3340,What does Zeniba represent?,"This is how I interpret the story of Spirited Away:   The bathhouse represents the society. People work with each other towards a common goal. Every night, 8 million gods come to the bathhouse and workers serve them, worship them. In a way they deal with them, do business with them. In Asian cultures, fire, air, earth, water, food, etc. are represented as gods, so bathhouse very accurately represents a working society. The 'spell' breaks if they stop working. Yubaba is the culture. She manages the bathhouse. She is tyrannical and rules over people by taking there real name and giving them a new name. Chihiro was given a new name by Yubaba, 'Sen', which means 'one thousand', similar to how a person is given a roll number or employee number in an organisation. That number becomes his new identity. Haku has forgotten his real name. Similar to Islamic terrorism, he's become a slave to the tyrannical culture. He'll do anything the culture tells him to do. The baby is the belief system of the society. Yubaba is overly protective of him.   One thing I can't understand is, who is Zeniba, Yubaba's twin sister.   Yubaba and Zeniba are two parts of a whole. Yubaba keeps baby locked in a room, afraid that he might get sick because of germs. Zeniba turned baby into a mouse so that he might have a little freedom. Zeniba lives in swamp bottom. There used to be trains running between bathhouse and swamp bottom in old days, but the return trains from swamp bottom have stopped. Now it's a one-way road towards swamp bottom. The tickets to swamp bottom Kamaji gave to Chihiro had been with him for 40 years. 'Zeni' has two meanings in Japanese, 'money' and 'ancient'. 'ba' means 'old lady'. The meaning of Zeniba which seems to fit the story is 'ancient old lady. Yubaba wanted to steal a seal from Zeniba, which was supposedly very precious.   So what does Zeniba represent in this story?

Is this the whole story from all previous stages redone with new animations? Or does it have anything new in the story?  "
3343,"What does it take to be an alchemist, besides knowledge and technique?","This is somewhat related to the question, Why can&#39;t the homunculi perform Alchemy?  Alchemy is an essential part of life in the series, where not only have the State Military weaponized it, but seems to be at the center of religion and priesthood of neighbouring countries. And yet, only a handful of people practice it. If it's so essential, why can't everyone work with it? We are not experts at all the fields we use, but we use them in some limited capacity anyway. For example, we are not all doctors, but when we have fever, we pop antipyretics; we are not all computer scientists, but we can use computers in our own ways, and so on. In the FMA-universe, alchemy seems to practised by just experts.  We already know that sin-essenced homunculi can't perform alchemy, but Father is a Homunculus (the original one), and yet he can perform alchemy. Ordinary doctors (eg. the Rockbells) have the smarts for advanced study, but don't seem to use any alchemy. Skilled automail mechanics have specialized technical knowledge, but none of them use alchemy.  There are exceptional circumstances where Father blocks tectonic alchemy for everyone, or Edward giving away his portal. But why can't everyone else perform some simple alchemy? Is there an explanation for this in the manga, that is similar to Star Wars' ""midi-chlorians""? "

3345,How does Father prevent the use of alchemy in Fullmetal Alchemist?,"I have recently started rewatching FMA brotherhood, and noticed some things I was confused about concerning Father.      He uses the pipes to spread the Philosopher's Stone beneath the nation of Amestris. The purpose behind this is to act as a barrier between the tectonic energy of the earth's crust, where Amestrian Alchemy gets its energy from, so that he can stop others from using Alchemy at any time.   Emphasis mine.  And also      he placed himself under what would become Central Command and used himself as a buffer against tectonic energy so alchemists would actually use energy derived from the souls of Xerxes contained within himself.   How is Father able to stop people from performing alchemy? And if the people in Amestris were partly using a philosopher's stone, wouldn't they be able to bypass the laws of equivalent exchange? "
3346,Why can't Ed perform alchemy without his arm?,"This answer establishes that all that's needed for a person who's seen the Gate to perform alchemy is to be able to make a circle with their body. However, Ed doesn't seem to be able to perform alchemy without his automail arm working.  Why can't he, for example, make a circle between his flesh arm and his shoulder/port and do alchemy that way? Or, alternatively, why can't he make a circle between his functioning flesh arm and his non-functioning automail arm?  Is there any canon explanation for this, or does it seem to be just a plot excuse for his automail arm being broken stopping him from doing alchemy? "

3348,Where does all the chakra of Edo Tensei shinobi come from?,"Where does all the chakra needed for the reanimated shinobi come from? It certainly cannot come from the caster, because the scale of the chakra being used for techniques is huge. In Kabuto's case, he was controlling several Edo Tensei shinobi at once. So all the chakra they were using couldn't possibly be coming from him.  Also, when Madara broke the Edo Tensei's contract, he mentioned about ""limitless chakra"". Where did the chakra come from? "

Tina is an owl model, Enju is a rabbit model, and so on.  Is it just a classification to sum up the abilities? Doesn't seem so, since Yuzuki can spin webs (although maybe they are artificial webs) but definitely Midori's cat ears are not artificial.  The several gastrea are also referred to as animal models (spider, ant, etc). Is there any relation between gastrea and animal DNA in the source material? "

Sometimes it is made suffix with a hyphen. Arc: Used to logically divide long running series. Season: Always used with a number starting from 1.  Why do they choose one over another? For example, why don't we say ""Moonlight Mile: Lift Off Hen"" or ""Naruto: Chuunin Exam Season""? Is this only a matter of choice or do they differ in meaning? "
3356,Where does MyAnimeList get their data from?,"I'm curious as to where/how exactly MyAnimeList gets their data. I understand there are a lot of similar services that let you ""Manage watching anime"", and I found them to mostly scraping the data they use from MAL (Or previously the MAL API).  AniDB and AniList were some of the larger players I found.   AniDB provides a reference to where the data (I assume) comes from:    So for a random anime I inspected, I was able to see that AniDB has used Wikipedia, MAL, as well as a few Japanese sites.  As for AniList and MAL, I could not find anything relevant.  So, where was/is the root of all the data? Did these services originally scrape from somewhere? "
3357,Is Conqueror's Haki Indiscriminate?,"Haoshoku Haki/Conquerors Haki by definition is:      is a rare form of Haki that cannot be attained through training. Only one in several million people have this ability. This type of Haki allows the user to exert their willpower over others. It is said that whoever possesses this type of Haki has the qualities of a king.   As most have seen watching One Piece this form of Haki has a few displays from small scale to large. What I am asking is if it is indiscriminate. When released on a large scale can it spare individuals? I have seen the cases where single individuals can be targeted by this haki. (i.e. Shanks vs Seaking, Rayleigh vs Elephant) I know that it has been shown people withstanding the haki but that seems to be due more to fortitude of the individual than the user sparing those people. So could a conquerors haki user spare his/her crew if they know they are weak willed?  "
3358,Can Earthling uses Latena,In the first episode in the anime it is stated that Kei's handgund poses a low amount Latena.

Does the novel eventually explore the possibility? 
3359,What does 'Akame ga Kill' mean and why is it called that?,"Just what the title says, why is the show called Akame ga Kill! and what does it even mean? Akame was just an ordinary member of Night Raid, yet the show is named after her. She wasn't the main Protagonist, she wasn't even the main Waifu! And as this unanswered question mentions here, the only difference was:      She fought Esdeath, the primary antagonist, and ultimately survived.   I googled a bit and came across this link, according to which Akame ga Kill! literally means:     Akame is kill    So what does that even mean? Does it mean that Akame is Death itself, or Akame is Dead (Not physically, but mentally - that she is dead inside). But I doubt that either of these interpretations are correct since she acts all cutesy from time to time.  As another user points out, a general translation would be Akame Kills, but that would be a very stupid name, wouldn't it? So can anyone help clear this up?    Edit: Even Akame knows something's not right (from AkaKILL Theater Episode 24 - END).   "

If a character from the anime doesn't have an online handle, then please include them in the list without a handle by their real name. A nicely organized list format would be most appreciated, if it's not too much trouble.  It would also be greatly appreciated if you were to state the colour of each character's handle next to it as well (I have difficulty reading kanji, so it's easy for me to lose track of who's who when they don't say each other's handle), please and thank you. Lastly, if you could please also state the character's colour gang affiliation (as well as if they were possessed by Saika) beside their name where applicable (except for any who are in the dollars, as that will already be taken care of in the above-mentioned Dollars site handle part of the list)? It'll really help me to be able to keep up with everything that goes on in the anime.  Here's an example of the sort of thing I'm looking for: Mikado Ryuugamine - Chatroom Handle: TarouTanaka (田中太郎, Blue) - Dollars Handle: _______ (______, _____)  Masaomi Kida (Yellow Scarves) - Bacura (バキュラ, _____) "

3363,Why is water coming out of the icebreaker?,"In episode 9 of Sora Yori mo Tooi Basho (宇宙よりも遠い場所), an icebreaker is shown breaking the ice.  From what I saw, the ship seems to lift itself up over the ice by shooting water out, as seen in these screenshots:      I think the ship is trying to reduce its weight so that it floats and goes above the ice, then it can crush it with its weight. However, in an earlier shot, I saw that the ship is already partially on the ice:    So why does it still need to shoot out water?  Also, I know that the icebreaker in the anime is based on Shirase icebreaker, so I looked up videos on YouTube to see how it breaks ice IRL. As you can see at the beginning of this video, there isn't any water coming out of the ship. It just runs over the ice and the ice just breaks automatically.  Why is there a need for the water anyway? Is this just to make the scene more dramatic? "
3364,An old anime/cartoon set in prehistoric time where the main character dresses like Tarzan and lives in a jungle,"I am looking for an old anime/cartoon. I have no idea about the name, the year it was published, the original language or whether or not it was an actual anime.  Things I know:   It takes place in prehistoric times, a little bit after dinosaurs. It was an adult man (dressed like Tarzan) that was struggling to survive (I think he had blond hair, and possible a girlfriend or wife). He was living in the jungle with thick vegetation. I watched it in 2000 ± 2 years but the anime could be 20 years older than that.   I think the main character's name was Koblan(k)/Coblan(k)/Moblan(k). His name was also mentioned in the intro.  It was played in Greece. It's not Shounen Kenya or Genshi Shounen Ryuu.  Thank you for your time. "

3368,Why are there sometimes darkened scenes in new anime?,"In the first Shingeki no Kyojin opening, I've seen some scenes with lower contrast or brightness, something like this:    And later, in the same sequence, a scene appears without that contrast change:    I've seen this kind of contrast change in the HxH remake as well, and the first thing that comes to my mind is that legendary Pokemon episode where a lot of kids suffered of photosensitive epilepsy attacks in Japan thanks to Pikachu and Co.  Does it has some relationship with that or there is another reason? Maybe a new law in Japan related to these flashy images on TV?  It seems this change appears only in new anime (I don't remember seeing something like this before last year). Any clue around that time?  ===UPDATED===  It's not just in the opening; here are more examples:  One of many scenes where the image is normal:    Then comes the darker scenes. Maybe it cannot be appreciated in the snapshots, but all are a full sequence of images appearing quickly with a bright background:      And then it returns to normal:    This is from the last HxH episode. At first, the image looks fine:    Then comes an attack and the image looks darker. Maybe the effect is not so intense as in Shingeki no Kyojin, but it is still there. Look, all these bright flashes coming from the hits seem not as bright as they should be:      And then the image looks normal again - compare the smoke color before and after:    As @JonLin notes, maybe it could be some kind of TV censorship, despite that there's nothing to censor besides all these flashy lights. Is it just me being paranoid or is there something more behind all this?  ==UPDATE 2==  I've found a Blu-ray rip of the Shingeki no Kyojin opening (no subtitles, no credits) and I took some shots of the same frames that I already put. To the left, the TV version and to the right, the BDRip version (click for more detail):        So it is not an effect to make things more dramatic, but rather an effect included only on TV. I suppose the same applies to the other shots (at least in SnK).    So my question comes again, why, lately, are there some anime with darkened scenes? My conspiracy theory is that it is related to those bright changes and possible photosensitive attacks. If that's true, why is this being applied lately? And why doesn't it appear on DVD/BD? If not, what else it could be? "
3369,Are all the Initiators/Cursed Children 10 years old? Were there none born after that?,"In Black Bullet, the main Initiators are all 10 years old girls. But there are several taller and smaller girls shown in the background.  Are all the Cursed Children 10 years old, or are there others born after that?  Does the contamination of mothers through the mouth still happen?  Do the Light Novels explain this phenomena in more depth than the anime?    It seems to be several questions, but the point is the same. Just different phrasing. "

So are some Devil Fruit powers just lucky, and allow infinite or a massive amount of usage, for example moving a mountain constantly for a hour or two, while others are extremely limited? Does it have nothing to do with the amount of work being done, for example?  In other words, is there any gauge or limit for the usage of all DF powers, or does it vary just completely randomly? "

I don't think I've heard that term anywhere else in the (anime) series. Sounds like some kind of martial art thing, but a Google search tells me more about some rock band.  So, what's a ""black key"" here? Do they appear anywhere in the series? Or is Kotomine an accomplished rockstar during his free time? "
3377,"What is the meaning of the phrase “If you're a man, then do it with a don”?","In one piece, On the Water 7 island sage, Tom said,   If you are a man, then do with a ""Don"", huh?   What does this mean?   "
3378,End of the HunterXHunter,"I started watching HxH and I saw the video where Killua and Gon said goodbye. I haven't watched anime completely yet, but I am really interested 1) Did Killua leave Gon forever? 2) Did the 2011 series end like that?  Don't worry about spoiling me its fine I just want to prepare myself mentally :d "
3379,Why didn't anyone find the explosion tags hidden in Konoha earlier?,"I am referring to the filler episode (Episode 200 of Naruto), where a Trap user named Gennō was on a mission to destroy Konoha by planting millions of explosive tags throughout the village while he disguised as a carpenter.  The tags were found 30 years after it was planted. Why did they find it now?  Meanwhile in Konoha, there were the Hyuga clan who were Byakugan users. Why didn't they at least accidentally find one or two in millions of the explosive tags that were hidden in Konoha? "
3380,Does Jiren use Ultra Instinct to some degree?,"Jiren was able to fight Goku and put him in trouble when he was using half Ultra Instinct. Does Jiren also have Ultra Instinct? This is a shot from the preview of the next episode, where Goku using complete Ultra Instinct fight against Jiren. Dont both Goku and Jiren have the same kind of aura? If so, does this mean they both have Ultra Instict?     "
3381,Lelouch - Geass in both eyes,"Until Lelouch confronted his father, his Geass was just in one eye. But suddenly, it changed and also appeared in the other eye. After that, he could stop his father's plans.  Was this a sign that his power was getting stronger? Or did something else change?  "
3382,What is the name of the show that involves a wish granting cat with a weakness to water?,"I remember when I was a kid watched an anime about a wizard cat. I think he was yellow and fat and each episode he made wishes come true hmmm... maybe for a bunch of kids?    He also has a weakness, the water, he hated it and I remember in one episode he touched the water and felt really sick and start to bleed by one of his mustache hairs.    That's all I remember,oh well, and it was a really funny animation. Anyone knows?  ==UPDATE==  I remember some other stuff too: He has a pointed hat, as a magician. Maybe black or blue, maybe has some stars? (I'm not so sure about that last point) and each time he started his magic, he dances and spins around with a lot of effects, kind of like any magical anime girl power.  I live in Chile, South America and it was not very popular between my friends (at least I've asked a few times and nobody remembers), but it must have been broadcasted in the '90.    And the last thing ""I think"" it was anime, I mean, I remember kind of anime drawing style and the ending with credits writing and song language unknown for me at that age. "
3383,Has the Twelve Demon Moons power levels be given by the author?,"I was watching a Youtube video and the Youtuber said the ranking of the 9 Pillars has be given by the author. Apparently it would be,       9 Insect Pillar. 8 Serpent Pillar . 7 Mist Pillar. 6 Love Pillar. 5 Water Pillar. 4 Wind Pillar. 3 Flame Pillar. 2 Sound Pillar . 1 Stone Pillar    How about the Twelve Demon Moons? Has the Twelve Demon Moons power levels be given by the author? "
3384,Does Princess Renner have other hidden personality as depicted in the 2nd season's ending credit?,"From the ED song, it seems like the Princess has dark/other personality which we all don't know about.  Is it true? Is there any story of hers to begin with?  The specific scenes from the ending:        "
3385,Why did Suzaku change sides?,"Suzaku was always Lelouch's enemy; they had the same goal, but different ways.  But when they met and killed Lelouch's father, he changed sides and became Lelouch's Knight. Why did this happen? At that point, Lelouch had the Geass in both eyes. Could he now manipulate people more often? Or did he just agree with Lelouch's plan to cheat the whole world? "
3386,Why is manga typically created with screentones rather than grayscale fills?,"I was recently introduced to the screen-tone process. Here's a short video for reference. Why was this, and why is this still the prominent technique for coloring manga? What advantages do screen-tones have over grayscale fills? &nbsp;  To clarify, a fill is when an artist uses a solid color to completely color one area (with marker, paint, pencil, etc...).  "
3387,Which demons developed sunlight resistance?,In the Kimetsu no Yaiba wikia it states that eventually      Nezuko Kamado develops sunlight resistance   Is there any other demon like this? Which demons developed sunlight resistance? 
3388,What is the relationship between the special chapters and the regular chapters for Wagatsuma-san wa Ore no Yome?,"My understanding is that there are actually two series.  Did the first series, which was in a monthly mag, get the boot?  If so, did the mangaka decide to start over when the series got picked up by the new mag? "
3389,Why is harem a common theme in manga/anime?,"Harem manga and anime are so popular that they have their own category. It's easy to name a few: Girls Wild, High School DxD, Sekirei, The World God Only Knows.  Why is this such a popular theme in both anime/manga? It is odd because in fantasy literature, American cinema, and Western television, harem is not a common theme and would offend most. How is it that they are so extremely prevalent (and seemingly accepted) in anime/manga? "
3390,Who was the child of the first Hokage?,"We all knew that Tsunade is the granddaughter of the First Hokage, but who are her parents? What are their whereabouts?

3391,Tanaka-kun Is Always Listless has a decimal volume number? Volume 13.5?,"I did a double-take, but it looks like Tanakeda volumes 13 and 13.5 are to be released simultaneously. Volume 13.5? A decimal volume number? I mean, I've seen decimal chapter numbers in Nichijou, and decimal game series numbers in Touhou, but this is the  first time that I've seen a decimal volume number...    According to the Tweet, 13.5 is going to be some kind of memorial book. Is it known what kind of content is going to be in this book? Is there some kind of special occasion that prompted the release of this unusually numbered volume? "
3392,Were the Arbiters previously humans?,"First, I was going to ask where the Arbiters originated from? Like where were they chosen from? But then after watching the animé, I learned the following:   Arbiters' 2nd Law : Arbiters have no emotions since they are dummies! Decim's statement to Chiyuki : If humans stay here for too long, they’ll turn into dummies!   These two things make me think that the Arbiters might be previously humans turned to dummies and then to Arbiters! Is it possible? Is that true? And if not then what about the origin of the Arbiters? How are they made or chosen? "
3393,"Contact info of Shamoe US, a vendor on Anime Expo","I went to buy anime merchandise at Anime Expo this past summer and I bought it from the these vendors. I went to the Asian American Expo and met them again. I forgot to ask them for their website but they said for the upcoming Anime Expo, they will go by the vendor name Shamoe US as stated here on Anime Expo listing page.  I looked up Shamoe US in the Anime Expo 2017 list and didn't find them so I guess they went by a different name this past summer. They were the vendors in the front who for some reason, had to shut down their vendor area and leave at around the 2nd or 3rd day of Anime Expo.    Are there any contact info of Shamoe US, like their official website? "
3394,Why did Bleach anime stop airing? And did Bleach manga also end its serialization?,"After I watched episode 366 of Bleach, I waited for a couple of months. As I expected, no new episode of Bleach anime has been released since then. And yet, I don't believe that the anime has reached the ending.  Why did Bleach anime stop airing? And did Bleach manga also end its serialization? Though for the case of the manga, I am not sure if it has actually finished. "
3395,What is the background about the tattoo around Jellal's eye?,  Why does Jellal have the red tattoo around his eye? Where did it come from? Is there anything special about the shape of the markings? 
3396,Did Saber recognize Illyasviel in Fate/Stay Night?,"In Fate Zero, Saber doesn't exactly meet Illyasviel, but she does see her, which is hard to forget because she looks pretty much exactly as her mother Irisviel, who was a good friend of Saber's.  In Fate Stay Night, Saber runs into Illyasviel multiple times, and eventually Illyasviel ends up living with her in Shirou's house. But, as far as I'm concerned, Saber doesn't seem to ""react"" at all. By this I mean something like:   ""Oh boy, that's Illyasviel, damned Kiritusugu's daughter"" ""Whoa, she looks exactly like my good old friend Irisviel"" ""von Einzbern? That rings a bell""   But it doesn't seem (to me) that Saber actually realizes this.  Does Saber recognize Illyasviel? If yes, why doesn't she bring it up? "
3397,Can't find the name of this anime for the life of me!,"The anime starts off with the guy in a hotel room, he turned on the TV and got a knock at the door. It turned out to be a girl that at the moment he didn't know but I think she turned out to be his cousin? They almost had sex because she seduced him and he thought she was a random call girl but he realized at the last second who she was I think and he kicked her out wearing no clothes lol.  Then, he started taking a bunch of college entrance exams failing all of them I think... he ran into some beautiful woman who I think went to the Tokyo U, or some kind of prestigious University that he couldn't hope to get into. But he went and took the exam anyway and that's about all I remember.  The art style was older, might have been late 90s early 2000's for all I know. Any leads? MC had longish black hair. I don't think it was a hentai or anything. I tried searching and literally nothing fits that description, so weird lol. Thanks in advance "
3398,Can there be 2 Pillars of the same style at the same time?,"So before the water Pillar Giyu Tomika, Sakonji Urokodaki existed, and before the flame Pillar Kyojuro Rengoku , Shinjuro Rengoku existed, and perhaps there are more examples I'm not aware of. Were some of them Pillars at the same time? Or does one of them have to retire for other Pillar of the same style to become a Pillar? "
3399,What is the status of the Valvrave the Liberator English Dubs?,"Since last licensed to Aniplex of North America, there has been only one English dubbed episode of Valvrave the Liberator. What is the current situation surrounding the English dubbed production of the anime? Will the entire series be completed? What is taking so long for the series to be completed? "
3400,How does the Install Port appear when a girl becomes a Reyvateil?,So 3rd Generation Reyvateils are originally born as humans but if their mother was a Reyvateil they may develop into one later in life.  From my understanding all Reyvateil have an install port surrounded by a tattoo and since Gathnode Crystals and Life Extending Agents are Physical Objects that get inserted into a Reyvateil with both being somewhat painful this would make it into a hole right?  But i can't imagine how this hole appears. does the skin just open up one day? does a Reyvateil have to go under some procedure to have it made (ie. when they get their first Life Extending Agent) or is it a gradual process? 
3401,"If Maika and Kaho work in the morning, when do they go to the school?","Maika and Kaho both are highschoolers, but they work in the morning. I assume so since when Maika comes to work, she says ""good morning"" in most of the episodes. It most likely morning than afternoon.  It's confusing as in the first episode itself, Maika doesn't go to school after work and instead went to an arcade.  Watching the last episode, I'm more or less convinced they work in the morning as Maika and the manager bump into each other at the train station and the time shown on the board was 10:23 AM. So perhaps she goes straight to work after homeroom.  However, in one of the episodes, she did say being held up at homeroom and being late for work. So either Maika was skipping school after doping in for attendance or they have a strange curriculum where they let students do jobs during school hours.  So, when do they go to the school? Don't they have daytime school, or is it evening classes? "
3402,How did Rukia become an unwitting carrier of the Hogyoku and executor of pre-planned events?,"There is great contrast: Aizen managed to insert it without Rukia knowing. later, he stated that extraction would be fatal (but it did not actually kill Rukia).   How did Aizen insert it into Rukia? And what are the plans he did so that she will be in a dangerous situation with Ichigo? "
3403,Do demon slayers change ranks automatically?,"In a chapter of the manga Inosuke tells to his friends,      We are kanoe rank now. And he shows them a drawing/tatoo like in his hand.    What does this mean? Do demon slayers change ranks automatically and they get printed in their hands or something? "
3404,"How can Sebastian use ""I am a butler and a devil"" so casually?","To my ears, the Japanese means:     I am an akuma (demon), and a shitsuji (butler).   I guess it must have a pun meaning, too. On one occasion, a bad guy cried out ""a-a-akuma?"", but that's the exception: everybody seems cool after hearing it. How can Sebastian say this so casually? "
3405,If a Pokémon trainer loses a gym badge can they get it replaced?,"In Pokémon: Indigo League, if a trainer earns a gym badge but then loses it during their travels and/or gets it stolen, do they have the ability to get it replaced without having to battle the gym leader again?   Throughout the series Ash keeps his badges pinned to the inner part of his jacket, but he's always flaunting them. Would it be possible for someone to just steal all his badges and skip the process of battling gyms, or is there some kind of registry that will verify the trainer's progress?  "

3408,Does Kibutsuji purposely choose Nezuko?,"Is there a reason why Nezuko is the only one in his family that turned into demon?  We all know that Nezuko has a strength that is in par with the Twelve Demon Moons, So I'm assuming that shes the only one from her family the has been successfully turned into the demon without dying even after Kibutsuji injected a large amount of his blood? "
3409,"Are some ""read the manga"" endings planned?","Sometimes when watching anime reviews, various reviewers will say a series has a read the manga ending.  From context, it appears to mean the anime is incomplete, there will be no sequel, and if you want to know what happens, you have to literally read the manga.  This is obviously used with a negative connotation.  I'm sure that usually this is not a planned result; due to whatever reason there ends up being no will or resources to do an additional season.  What I am curious about is the alternative case -- is a read the manga ending ever decided up front?  I.e. was the anime series considered by the producers nothing more than a marketing tool to drive manga sales?  Some reviewers give that impression, but I wonder if there are documented cases where it has been literally part of the plan from the beginning. "
3410,Why was everyone attempting to fool Ulla?,"This contains spoilers for Sunday Without God.  Ulla Euleus Hecmatika is the princess of Ortus, the capital of death.  She is the Idol of Murder, and whoever she sees, talks to, or touches, dies. Supposedly, she doesn't know this, as she's been fooled her whole life.  Kiriko, her instructor, was asked by some elders/superiors/whatever to fool Ulla.  What were they expecting to accomplish by lying to her?  Not from Kiriko's point of view, but rather from the elders/superiors who asked him to do it. Why do they want to fool Ulla? What were they attempting to avoid had she known the truth?  I suppose that she could get rebellious if she knows that she's murdering newcomers who want to join Ortus, but the concept of death has blended too well into the world's culture for over 15 years, so it is a daily, trivial thing and I can't imagine the elders considering it a bad idea to explain it to Ulla. "
3411,Why did Lupin the Third change its target audience in recent years?,"I just finished watching a lot of the original Lupin the Third television series from the 1970s.  Then I watched Lupin the Third: Mine Fujiko to Iu Onna and Lupin the Third: Jigen Daisuke no Bohyou. These two were my stand out favourites. They both also happen to be tagged as Seinen on MAL, unlike the rest of the Lupin shows which are Shounen.  Why was there a sudden change in the focus of the series? Or better yet, why isn't Lupin a Seinen series to begin with? Personally, I think it works much better as a Seinen series.  I also noticed that they're doing another Shounen series this year. Didn't people like the Seinen ones? "
3412,"Why does MAGES. say ""music animation game event school"" backwords?","In Hyperdimesion Neptunia Re;Birth, when the party does their first job for Avanir in Lastation, they come across MAGES. When the party is unable to help her find ""Doc P"", she calls someone and at the end of her call she says     I bid you luck. Loochs tneve emag noitamina cisum.   If we reverse the last part, it says:     music animation game event schooL   I know that MAGES. is a reference to the parent company of 5pb which is also called MAGES (Japanese Wikipedia Page), and I remember reading before the release of Hyperdimension Neptunia Victory that her design was inspired by Steins;Gate  Why does MAGES. say ""music animation game event school"" backwards? Is this some reference to one of 5pb's or MAGES' works? (like Steins;Gate or other titles in the Science Adventure Series) "
3413,Why did Chouji get fat when he received Naruto and Kurama's Chakra?,"Why did Chouji get fat from receiving Naruto and Kurama's Chakra? Chouji didn't activate any technique for it to happen, actually he was surprised.   Do Akimichi bodies just naturally convert chakra into fat?   "
3414,Does Konohamaru know how to use Sage mode?,"As you can see Jiraiya, Minato and Naruto summoning jutsu is a toad, also these people also know how to use Sage mode.   How about Konohamaru? In the boruto series, I see he have 2 different summoning jutsu, one is Enra (Little Monkey) and another one is Gamagoro (Toad).     So does he have the ability to use Sage? Since he have the contact with the toad, he also have the chance to learn sage mode in the Mount Myōboku right?  *ALLOWED SPOILER! "
3415,Psycho Pass Episode / Special Order,I just watched season 1 (episodes 1-22) of Psycho Pass on Netflix and now I want to watch the rest.  On the Funimation site there is:   Episodes 1-22 (Season 1) Specials 1-11 Episodes 23-33 (Season 2) Also there is the recently released movie.   I haven't started any of the specials or season 2 yet; I don't want to accidentally watch something out of order and spoil it. My question is: Where do the specials fit into the series? Between the two seasons? Side stories? Prequel? After season 2? When should I watch them?  The episode lists I've found seem to leave out the specials so I'm not sure how they fit in. 
3416,Where do the angels come from?,"The plot of NGE starts with the first angel ""Sachiel"". But where do the angels who are attacking the earth come from?  Also where were all angels before they came to Japan/Tokyo? And why do all angels go to Japan? "
3417,Why aren't most of the phones in anime smartphones?,"For example:   Gintama:   Oregairu: I can't think of any examples I can back up right now, but for Oregairu you just need to watch any episode and you'll see Yui's flip phone. Haganai   Black Rock Shooter     Is it because the authors are just from an older generation than the fanbase? No way, right? They have to have smartphones.  This says it's because smartphones aren't popular in Japan. I don't think that's true (bad evidence alert).  Several Reddit posts also agree that flip phones are more popular. Why are flip phones still so popular, (if you can endeavor to answer) in both society and anime/manga? "
3418,Did Yato cut Hiyori's ties to the Far-Shore in episode 6 of Aragoto?,"Tenjin agreed to send Yato and Yukine up to Takamagahara to confront Bishamon for taking Hiyori hostage on the condition that afterwards Yato would sever ties with Hiyori.     In Episode 6, when he returns, Tenjin brings it up and he wields Sekki to cut ties with her but she keeps refusing. However, it never shows him actually severing ties with her. Regardless of that, I don't think Tenjin would allow him to break his agreement. Later on in the episode, Tenjin and Tomone see Yato chasing after Hiyori and Tomone says, ""It seems they haven't severed their ties at all.""    Now, I'm sure that they said when a God severs ties with someone from the Near Shore they lose all memories of that person. It seems like Yato is frantically trying to get her to know him again, and she seems a little more distant than before. So, it definitely seems possible that he did sever his ties to her but then relentlessly harassed her to get her to know him again as sort of a loophole to his agreement with Tenjin. However, if that was the case, I don't understand why she would have remembered Yato was the one who helped her classmate when her classmate approached her later.    So were her ties severed or not? If they were, how could she remember these details from the past about Yato? "
3419,What was Tohsaka doing watching the dojo lately?,It was mentioned in episode 1 of Ufotable's Fate/Unlimited Blade Works that Tohsaka used to go to the archery dojo to watch someone. Was she secretely watching Shirou because she had a crush on him (but how?) or was she looking out for Sakura? Did Tohsaka know of Sakura's feelings for Shirou? 
3420,Why is K9999 almost identical to Tetsuo Shima?,"I was watching this video which shows the similarities between both characters. I suppose it must be a kind of tribute, or maybe is just a vile copy (I don't think so). Anyone knows the reason? "

If it is light novel art, which light novel of the monogatari series is it from?  If it is a fanart, does it have anything to do with the light novels (meaning does this scene takes place in the light novels)?   "
3422,Why is Gohan shown to be so weak in Dragon Ball Super?,"Gohan was the strongest in his mystic form back at the end of DBZ. How could Gohan have become so weak that he lost the ability to turn Super Saiyan 2 in such a short period of time? While on the other hand, Frieza was able to surpass Goku's Super Saiyan Blue transformation in only 4 months of training. That doesn't make sense.  Tagoma was even able to pierce him with a ki blast. Now he is losing left and right in every episode. Most recently Frieza in his base form was shooting ki blasts through Super Saiyan Gohan. So Frieza's base form is stronger than Super Saiyan now? How did that happen? "
3423,Why did Saber reveal to Shirou and Rin that she has participated in the previous war?,"  Saber did not reveal her identity to Shirou for fear of her master giving it away to enemies and thus exposing her strengths and weaknesses. But why, even though in front of a rival master, did she reveal the fact that she has been summoned to the previous Holy Grail War? Wouldn't that enable Rin to deduce whatever advantage Saber has because of her memories of the previous war and possibly even her real identity (Servants being summoned twice and retaining their memories was unheard of)?

Why did he do that? "
3426,Why was Gai resurrected?,"If Daath was after the king's power, they could have taken it from Shu anytime they wanted. Why wait so long and resurrect Gai for taking the king's power? They had someone else who could use king's power as well. Why does it have to be Gai?  And what caused a change of plans? Keido tried to be the ""Adam"". Then it was Gai. "
3427,What airs on TV in Japan during the break between the fall and winter anime season?,"With little to no new anime airing in the next week or so, with fall season now being over and winter season starting in January, I for the life of me, cannot figure out what airs on TV in Japan to take the place of anime which would usually air. Wouldn't there be a lot of empty time slots? They can't fill them up with Christmas specials right? Christmas isn't even that big in Japan from what I know.  "
3428,Which episode is this eye in hand from and what is its purpose?,"I was listening to some cover of Cruel's Angel Thesis when I stumbled upon this image:    Since every other image used in the video does come from NGE/EoE, I am inclined to think it does come from an episode of Evangelion.  However, I don't recognize the scene, and don't know of any character with such a... scar, nor its use.  Does anyone remember where it appears? What is it and what is its purpose? "

An example of this practice is Bimbo-gami, Kofuku, using Ebisu's name. Is such practice limited to the world within Noragami? Or does it stems from the real world? In other words, does some of the Japanese Gods in the real world also do such practice? "

3433,How were the English translations of character names for Hunter x Hunter conceived?,"If Togashi originally conceived the names in Japanese, for example Furikusu, how was it decided that this would translate into the decidedly weird Freecss, with 2 's'?  How did Zorudikku become the decidedly English-sounding Zoldyck?  How is the official spelling of names like Zushi decided from Zooci, or Killua over Kirua? Or when Chrollo is used over Kuroro?  Is it all simply a translator's discretion, or is there input from someone else about what they might have been intended to be? "
3434,Where does Kirito get his new gear?,"In the beginning of the Sword Art Online anime, episode 2 ""Beater"", Kirito acquires the Coat of Midnight when getting the last attack bonus on the boss.  Up until episode 7, ""Warmth of the Heart"", it appears he is using mostly the same gear. In the beginning of this episode when we first see him, he is daunting a new coat and his Elucidator sword. Lizbeth does say, ""this is the gnarliest sword you can get from a monster drop"" or something to that effect.   Is there ever any mention of where/how he acquired his new gear? I haven't read the manga series, is there any mention in it? "

3436,How come we never saw Dragons leaving the body of the Dragon Slayers in Fairy Tail (2014)?,"We don't see the Dragons leaving the body of the Dragon Slayers except in Natsu's case, even though Igneel mentioned it in Episode 89. Why is that? Did they forget to animate it?  [Edit- Note :If they have not mentioned it in manga then wouldn't that will be a plot hole because everybody will be aware of the dragons leaving the dragon slayers body and no one would have been surprised to see the face getting destroyed at that time. Also fighting Achnologia would have been much easier.] "

In episode 2, after Oubu knocks Entei into the air, we get what I presume to be an aerial view of the region (enclosed by a circular wall):    In episode 1, we see Kinoa and Shizuru beat up two people who appear to be guarding an entrance to the region. The character in red at the top of the tower in the top-center is 封, meaning roughly ""seal"" (as in ""isolate"").    Shortly after that, a man notifies Reoko that ""A Bubuki user has broken through the gate"". Upon hearing this, Reoko gets up and leaves the memorial ceremony she's at.  What is actually in the sealed region? I'm pretty sure the ""Buranki prison"" (i.e. the place where Oubu's skeleton is kept) is in there, but the region seems far larger than it needs to be just to accomodate the ""prison"". As you'll note if you look closely at the aerial view above, the streets inside the region are laid out in a very ""honeycomb""-like manner, while the streets outside the region are gridded, much like real-life Tokyo. What's the deal with that? "
3439,How did professor Oak discovered Ash's pikachu?,"   In the 4th Pokemon movie, Sam goes forward in time along with Celebi   and then battles alongside Ash and Pikachu. After the battle, Celebi   returns him to his timeline. At the end of the movie, it evens shows   Oak with a picture of Pikachu drawn in the notebook, kind of   confirming that Oak and Sam were the same person.   For the director's comments on the English DVD involving the voice talent, they talk about watching the original ending and being completely confused on whether it meant that Oak and Sammy were the same person or not. They note that the original is a fairly typical way for a Japanese movie to solve a similar mystery in the storyline. Once they confirmed that Oak and Sam were indeed the same person, they created the new ending to clearly show that they were the same for the English-speaking audiences.     here is the end according to bulbapedia: ""Oak notices Ash's   disheartened face and asks him what exactly is bringing him down, as   he hasn't said a word since they began talking. Ash replies that it's   because he made a really good friend, but now it seems they'll never   see each other again. Professor Oak responds that true friendships can   withstand the test of time and he's absolutely sure that he'll see Sam   again and that even though they're separated, they'll be friends   forever. Ash feels better from Oak's kind words and promises to tell   him the full story when he returns to Pallet Town, and Oak remarks   that he's looking forward to it.      After hanging up, Misty notices something: How could Professor Oak   have known that the boy they met was named Sam if none of them   mentioned this?""sorry if its too long   When Oak gave Pikachu to ash.  I don't think professor Oak was out of Pokemon, as he said:     ""you are late. I am only left with one Pokemon which is very difficult to train""    Professor Oak has a lot of trainer's Pokemon's so they breed together and usually give birth to new Pokemon, which are then given to trainers.  Professor Oak is also a Pokemon researcher, but how did this help him discover Ash's Pikachu?   Maybe there is something unique about ash's Pikachu, and the professor got it after some research when he traveled back into the past.  So I am left with the simple question:   How did professor Oak know this particular Pikachu belongs to Ash as he saw in the future after he returned to the past then he gave the same Pikachu to the ash to start his Pokemon Journey. Maybe sam and ash will meet again as oak said at the end of the movie in another time travel event in the coming movies or episodes and this mystery can be solved.  Sources I used   Ash traveled into the past along with Pikachu in Alola region Professor Oak traveled into the future along with Celebi and met Ash. Bulbapedia's page on Pokemon time travel  "
3440,How did Spandam become the leader of CP9?,"I've just rewatched the Enies Lobby arc and still don't understand how Spandam became the leader of CP9. Why didn't Lucci become the leader? He's the strongest member of CP9, but why Spandam is the leader? He can't even use Rokushiki. "
3441,What exactly is the deal with Black Blades?,"Zoro recently (in the anime) unleashed an impressive torrent of attacks using Busoshoku (Armament) Haki infused blades. This was not all that surprising but his flashback was (to me).  Zoro flashed back to both his training with Dracule Mihawk and his fight with him in the Baratie arc. Mihawk's main blade, Yoru apparently, is clearly shown to be black throughout this fight and the flashback stresses the fact that it is the strongest Black Blade.  Yet, the episode seems to say that Black Blades refer to swords turning black when infused with Haki.  As Mihawk is the strongest swordsman, it seems guaranteed that the world's strongest ""Black Blade"" may or may not have anything to do with Yoru's color itself.  In addition, you can note that both replicas of Yoru we see (Mihawk's mini sword and the one wielded by the Mihawk-like monkey Zoro trained against) have silver blades.  This all leads to 3 closely inter-related questions:   Did I understand this right? Does ""Black Blade"" refer to the sword or the technique? Did Mihawk use Haki on Zoro so early in the series? Does Yoru (as we've seen it but in universe) look black, silver, or does it vary from person to person? What if Yoru is not wielded by Mihawk?  "
3442,"Why did Dragon Ball Z Kai change ""It's over 9000!"" in the TV version to ""It's over 8000!"" in the DVD version?","In Dragonball Z Kai there are two different English dubs: the TV version and the DVD version. They handle the famous ""what is his power level"" scene differently.  TV version     Nappa: Vegeta. Vegeta! What's wrong with you?! Tell me what his power level is!      Vegeta: It's over nine thousaaand!!!      Nappa: What?!! Nine thousand?!!   DVD version     Nappa: Vegeta! What does the scouter say about his power level?      Vegeta: It's over eight thousand!      Nappa: Eight thousand?!!   While I presume that Nappa's first line was just a result of a different take or a slightly different wording, I'm confused especially about how the TV version (and all previous English dubs of Dragon Ball Z, shown earlier in the video) gives Goku's power level as ""over nine thousand"", while the DVD release of Kai changes it to ""over eight thousand"".   The two numbers have the same number of syllables, so it doesn't seem like something that would have changed to accommodate lip flaps or anything. So why the numerical change from 9000 to 8000? "
3443,How did Brook know what his devil fruit was?,"What I'm wondering is...is it possible to know what devil fruit power a devil fruit holds before a character eats it? Don't devil fruit eaters find out what their devil fruit powers are by experiencing the powers first hand.  I'm asking this because how on earth would Brook know that he ate the revive-revive fruit if he hasn't died yet? (For reference, in a flash back before he became a skeleton, the crew members ask him how his revive-revive devil fruit power works, to which he replies ""I'm not exactly sure, I haven't died yet, so I wouldn't know."" -I'm paraphrasing of course) "
3444,"Why does Nora's darkness/corruption not affect Yato (or any other God that has named her, for that matter)?","Disclaimer: I've only watched the anime.  When Yato gave Yukine a name, he immediately started suffering from all his ""sins"" and eventually an Ablution had to be performed to save both's lives.  Then why is it that he is not affected by Nora's actions? Unless he un-named her, which hasn't been mentioned. Either way, why doesn't he seek to kill her and end all these side problems that emerge because of her?  I am not entirely through with season 2, but similarly Kugaha's case confuses me too.   If anyone has answers, I'd appreciate them. Also, I don't care about spoilers, rather the opposite, if possible I wanna understand everything beforehand. This show sure is good, but it makes some mistakes in regards to explaining basic logic. "

3446,Why was Goku the only Z Warrior to contract the Heart Virus?,"In Trunks' future that had been destroyed by the Androids, Goku died from a Heart Virus.  Even in the alternate timeline caused by Trunks warning the Z Warriors about the Androids, Goku still contracted the Heart Virus but they already had a cure for it given by Trunks. Yet in both timelines out of all the Z Warriors Goku was the only person to contract it.  Why is this? Was it a targeted attack on him by Dr. Gero (given the timing of when it occurred)? Was Goku's diet a factor or was there something Saiyan wise that made him more susceptible which doesn't apply to Vegeta and half-Saiyans? "
3447,Why is Hiiro a Nora?,"We know that she has spent a lot of time with Yato (because they've shown to be together since childhood and Hiiro was his first Regalia) and also really cares about him. Yato himself says:        This means that Hiiro does care about Yato and has never done anything which she thought wasn't for the good of Yato. Just before this scene, we also see Hiiro saying that she wouldn't mind dying in the underworld as long as Yato was with her.  So why is it that she is a Nora? Why did she allow other Gods to name her? "
3448,"Is there a reason for this broken ""Fly""?","The picture below is a partial screen cap from time mark 1:44 of episode 24 of Haikyu!!, 2nd Season.  My main question involves Karasuno's team banner, with the calligraphy for Fly.  Several times this season the banner's translation is shown with the word ""Fly"" broken into two lines.  In each episode, there was obviously room for the ""y"" to appear on the same line with the rest of the word.     Was splitting it a pure mistake, possibly caused by some production issue?  I can imagine that maybe the translator was rushed and confused, or perhaps somehow could not tell that the entire word ""Fly"" would have fit on a single line. Was the split done out of habit?  I've seen that Japanese is sometimes written horizontally and sometimes vertically.  Perhaps the translator just did not realize how odd it would look in English to see a 3-character word split. Was the split a pure artistic choice?  It seems unlikely, but maybe there is some concept within the Japanese calligraphy that could be expressed in English by splitting the word ""Fly"".  I can sort of get it -- Fly, by its very nature, is a vertical concept.   Since the same frame contained Aoba Johsai's banner, I might as well ask the opposite question concerning it.  Why did the translators not split the word ""Court"" from the rest of the slogan so that it would appear below ""Rule the""?  This would allow the translation to not overflow the banner, as well as avoid a partial overwrite of a second calligraphic character.  The cinematography of the banners here is interesting. They are intentionally juxtaposed thematically, not as they actually were placed in the stadium. Perhaps the key is not in the individual slogans, but in the viewing them as a set. "
3449,What exactly is Madara implying about the Sage of Six Paths?,"Since Chapter 646 is currently the latest chapter, the question will be in spoilers.      My question specifically pertains to whether or not all shinobi descended from the Sage of Six Paths. Is this what Madara is implying in the last panel of this picture: ""[...] in effect, taught us all chakra...""?      I think there are multiple ways to interpret this. One is that all shinobi are related to Kaguya, meaning everyone related knows how to use chakra.   And the second way is that if one knows how to use chakra, then all their offspring will be born into the world able to use chakra. Therefore the Sage of Six Paths can simply teach others how to use chakra and then everyone else knows.   There were probably some words lost in translation, so I am just confused now.   Did all shinobi descend from the Sage of Six Paths or did the Sage simply just teach others how to use chakra?    "

At that time, there's some conversation between Dr. Kureha and Dalton. Dr. Kureha asked Dalton if he knew about Gol D. Roger.  It seems that Dr. Kureha knew Gol D.

Later in the manga is revealed that,      They are in kanoe rank. But it's never shown when they got the ranks inbetween   Is there an official guide, audiobook, interview or something which shows how they demon slayers increased ranks? Which rank is Tanjiro by the time he fights the spider demon twelve demon moon? "
3456,About Lelouch and Nunnally during and soon after the invasion of Japan,"From what I remember: Lelouch and Nunnally were given as hostages to Japan. Britannia invades Japan. Lelouch and Nunnally somehow live.  Why exactly are they alive and not announced dead?  I thought the whole point of taking or giving hostages is to ensure a certain agreement. When Britannia invaded Japan, it seems whatever agreement Britannia and Japan had was breached so why didn't Genbu or whoever execute Lelouch and Nunnally? Is it that someone tried but failed to do so?  Alternatively, if for some reason the relevant legitimate or de facto authorities of Japan didn't want to execute Lelouch and Nunnally (pity, morality, attempt at using them as double agents or whatever), why didn't Lelouch or someone decide to have his and Nunnally's (fake) deaths made known rather than making Clovis, Euphemia, Cornelia, et al merely presume or suspect their deaths?  Could be remembering the series wrong, but it seems like they guessed Lelouch and Nunnally were dead rather than, say, found out from Japanese news. If I were one of them, I would find it suspicious that the Japanese authorities didn't execute or announce that they executed them. "
3457,Why did Lelouch and Nunnally allow themselves to be seen in public?,"After the Second Pacific War and Invasion of Japan, Lelouch and Nunnally decided to live under false identities (not to have plastic surgery and be seen in public).  Why? What exactly were they thinking? They really wouldn't be recognised? I seem to recall Cornelia and Kirihara recognised Lelouch. "
3458,"What are the ""specs"" of the afterlife world?","Regarding the afterlife world we see in the Angel Beats! anime, I have many questions, but I think we can pack all of them as ""what are the specs of the afterlife world?"":   Are habitants limited to the school grounds? Can they, say, go somewhere really far away? Is this world based on an actual place in the living world? For instance, does this school actually exist somewhere? Do all individuals that die with regrets end up here? Surely millions of people die this way, and I'm pretty sure that we never see more than a few thousands. Are there other afterlife worlds? Or everyone ends up in the same place?  "
3459,"Why was ""Gold Wedding Ring"" displayed for less than a second?","One scene of Yuri on Ice (YoI) displays a register receipt from a jewelry store.  For less than a second, possibly even as short as a few frames, most of the receipt is visible, and it is clear Yuri is about to purchase a Gold Wedding Ring. Immediately the bulk of the receipt becomes masked by Yuri's credit card. At the beginning of time code 13:26 of episode 10 a lucky freeze-frame can capture:    After that instant, the only significant receipt info which remains unmasked is the price, 768.94 €.  Is there a verifiable reason the exact nature of this purchase is almost hidden from the viewer?  In the English subtitles, Yuri refers to it as simply a ""luck charm"".  There is a Tumblr post which explains that the term in Japanese is ""omamori"" and has a deeper meaning than a non-Japanese speaker would associate with ""luck charm"".  (I have no direct knowledge that this post is accurate, but it feels right.) So those in Japan would apparently get much more out of this scene, even if they could not read the receipt.  Within hours (probably minutes) of episode 10 airing, there were people posting the information on this receipt.  It is likely that, even though the details would slip by the vast majority of viewers, any internet-savvy YoI fan would know what the receipt said. So the scene seems to be intentionally hiding information, but with the knowledge that it will be revealed by the fans. Does this confuse anyone else?  Also, can anyone read the first word on the line with ""Gold Wedding Ring""?  I think it starts with an ""F"" but I cannot make it out, even in a sharpened version of the image. (The video was viewed, and image captured, at 1080p resolution, expanded to full screen on my 1920x1080 display.) "
3460,On Lelouch's grudge,"As a kid, Lelouch vowed to destroy Britannia or something, but how was he going to do that without the Geass or rich or powerful allies besides Suzaku and the Ashford family? It's not like the Japanese were using or planning to use him or Nunnally as double agents or anything like that, or were they?  Anytime pre-Geass, did he actually stand a chance of exacting his childhood revenge? "
3461,Why do producers translate some anime titles?,"A lot of producers these days seem to change the original Japanese name to English alternatives. Why do they do this? Does this add any value to the name of the anime in other countries or is it just that it is easier to read for people outside of japan/otaku society?  Because some of the cases are really weird and in my opinion not necessary. An example of this would be ""Ace of Diamond"" also known as ""Diamond no Ace"".  Is there anything to gain from translating the title? Also, why don't all series do this? "

They always kill people to get their remaining life span so if any person is saved in the process shinigamis don’t die.

It's true that she has her own fighting style, but like Soi Fon, she has the same fighting style, but uses a Zanpakuto.  There was some flashback moments when we saw younger Yoroichi wielding a Zanpakuto:    I imagine she had Shikai/Bankai to become a Captain, so she should be stronger if she uses it in a fight.

3475,Why is Natsume Desperate,"During episode 11 of Tokyo Ravens, there was a scene on a weekend that Dairenji Suzuka visited Tsuchimikado Harutora's room and explored its inside just to annoy Harutora.  Then after that, Suzuka also asked to enter Tsuchimakado Natsume's room. However, Natsume deliberately refused Suzuka's demand even though that they know that Suzuka can black mail Natsume about revealing her great secret.    Natsume even forced herself to go to her room even when Suzuka was already restraining her.   (Just look at Natsume's worried face XD)   And after that, Natsume was forcibly tied by Suzuka in order for them to visit Her room. The inside of the room was pretty normal, so they wondered why would Natsume be that worried, but as Suzuka monitored the room, she noticed a very complicated barrier that is protecting Natsume's closet. Curiously, Suzuka tried to forcibly open the closet by removing the barrier. Then Natsume desperately crawled going to her room with tears in her face showing her great fear of Suzuka opening the closet and them knowing the contents inside.  (Just look at her annoyingly cute expression as she crawled! XD)   Since Harutora was kind enough to feel pity on Natsume, He ordered Kon to release Natsume from her binding.  As soon as Natsume's binding was released, she desperately called Hokuto (Overpowered) just to protect her secret; Thus destroying her room due to Hokuto's size.    Now, this is my question:   Why was Natsume desperate of not letting them (Suzuka, Harutora, Touji) enter her room, even though its pretty normal? (if there is no exact reason, maybe a girl's perspective will do) What is inside Natsume's closet? Is it so very important that she even protected it with strong barriers and even called Hokuto just to protect it? (there is also a question related to this but the answers did not fill the void in my heart.  "

3477,Is there a religion in Amestris?,"Occasionally, especially when talking about human transmutations, Amestrians mention God, mainly with the idea of human transmutations being a transgression against God. An example of this is when Olivier Armstrong is talking about the three tenets for state alchemists and is answering the question of why human transmutations are forbidden.  It doesn't seem to me like this is a reference to ""Truth"", seeing as very few people seem to know about ""Truth"", who is essentially the God within the gate. Is there some specific religion's God that this is reference to, or it is a sort of generic God=nature? Is there a stated religion within Amestris? "
3478,How come Moro is stronger than Berus?,"I feel Moro has plot armor right now… Dragon Ball Super Chapter 46 dropped this week, showing Moro make quick work of both Goku and Vegeta as the two tried to stop the evil wizard while on Namek. The duo were already worn out after Moro's absorption technique prevented them from turning Super Saiyan, but things went from bad to worse once he drained almost all of their energy by grabbing them both by the neck and knocking them unconscious. After consuming their combined energy, Moro's body quickly transformed into a younger, more muscular form, and he used his newfound power to terrorize the Namekians for their Dragon Balls.  Given that he was able to take down two full-powered Super Saiyan Gods and has shown he can consume the energy of entire planets with his absorption technique, fans have already started asking — could he beat Beerus?  The God of Destruction has been the measuring stick for every Dragon Ball villain ever since he first arrived in Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods, and he has been shown to be much stronger than both Goku and Vegeta even in their Super Saiyan Blue forms with his Hakai ability.  So could Moro stand up to something like that? Well the manga gives a convincing argument when it shows that he is not only able to absorb energy from lifeforms around him, but also from energy attacks that are launched at him. Vegeta learned that firsthand in the latest chapter when he consumed a Galick Gun blast.  If Moro were able to consume Beerus' God Ki, or somehow absorb the force of a Hakai attempt, his power would likely spike to levels never seen before.  But on the other hand, it's possible Beerus would see this coming. While he opted not to help Namek during the ongoing fight, he hasn't confirmed whether he knows who Moro is -- he was first captured 10 million years ago, but Beerus is roughly 200 million years old. If he does, he'd likely know not to waste time with energy attacks and would use his Ultra Instinct Omen ability to fight in hand-to-hand combat.  What do you think? "

3481,"Why was anime produced on 24fps film, when Japan is a NTSC country?","Nowadays, NTSC isn't really all that relevant anymore since Japan ended analogue television almost a decade ago. But for most of the history of the anime industry, that's how it was broadcast.  Then it strikes me as really odd that the film was shoot at 24fps. To prepare 24fps video for NTSC broadcast, it would have to go through 3:2 pull down, which results in both interlaced frames and changes in frame timing.  Why was it not produced at 30fps instead, which fits much better with NTSC? Surely all that interlacing can't be good?  The basic animation modes should stay the same, shooting on twos (12 cels per second) is easily handled as shooting on twos (15cps) or threes (10cps) at 30fps, and shooting on threes (8cps) is easily either threes (10cps) or fours (7.5cps)  What's the technical reason for picking an animation frame rate that doesn't match the television frame rate?  Please, this is not about being animated at 24 fps, it's about the film being shoot at 24 fps "
3482,How does Mikoto know about the Sisters before the Sister's Arc?,"Misaka Mikoto seems to know about the sisters before the Sister's-arc, as she says both in the prologue of the first LN and the Railgun-manga:     Have you heard how my DNA map was supposedly analyzed and military Sisters were created based on it?   How did Mikoto know about the Sisters back then? She found out during the Sisters Arc (which happened later) that the Sisters exist and the rumor just spread then, too (at least it seems to me). How could she tell Touma about them? "
3483,Why does Hori treat her father so bad?,"In the manga Horimiya, the main heroine always treats her father poorly. Is there a reason as to why she does so? In the latest chapter (57) she states that there is no room for her father in the Kotatsu. In the chapter before, she doesn't give her dad any extra stew. From what I remember, both the mother and Hori treat her father unreasonably, but I don't remember a reason why. Is there a reason, or is it just some kind of running gag for comedy purposes? "
3484,Why did Orochimaru go for Sasuke instead of Naruto?,"During the second test of the Chunin exams, Orochimaru goes for Sasuke and even gives him power. But why does he avoid cursing Naruto like he did to Sasuke? Wasn't Naruto as powerful as Sasuke? Or was he too powerful to be controlled?  Also, why does he use the Five Elements Seal on Naruto? "
3485,"Why is the anime named ""Baccano!""?","The question itself is self-explanatory! What's the meaning of it?  And why is it named so?  How was the anime named so?  I thought the reason would be revealed by the end if the anime but it didn't, and I'm left here wondering... "
3486,Origins of the nose-bleed in anime/manga,"In a similar spirit to my previous question, I wonder who was the first artist to feature a nose-bleed when thinking, shall we say, ""provocative thoughts""?  Did it become popularized in anime/manga because of the popularity of the artist's work or because it is a common belief in japanese folklore? "
3487,"When does the Bible come up in ""Miss Bernard said""?","Prior to watching the anime adaptation, I read descriptions of Miss Bernard said (Bernard-jou Iwaku) in MyAnimeList and the Fall 2016 chart linked to in the Anime.SE chat. Both mention that the Bible comes up in at least one conversation in the series. Despite this, I do not recall ever seeing a discussion of or an allusion to Bible in the anime shorts, which I found a bit disappointing &mdash; I would have liked to see how they approached the subject.  In this case, seeing that Bible was mentioned in the show description in the first place, it seems likely that it at least appears once in the manga. Am I correct, and if so, where does it appear? (Alternatively, did I overlook some details in the anime?) "
3488,How does the dummy-pulled cart work?,"Yaichirou has been seen running a cart more than once during the series. It is pulled by a sort of dummy that runs like crazy, with its legs going back and forth.    How exactly does this cart work? Is there any source that explains this?    Also, does it belong to Yaichirou, or the Shimogamo family or is it some sort of 'service' (like a regular taxi)? "
3489,How did the Female Titan cut Eren's titan form?,"After she killed the Levi squad, Eren transformed to fight the Female Titan. In Chapter 29, Hammer, it looked like Eren was having the upper hand, but then the Female Titan turned around, and with one horizontal motion, cut Eren's titan form's head in half.  How did that happen? That part wasn't clear in the anime nor the manga. Did she take a tree and smacked him? Did she harden her hand and hit him?   "
3490,What happened with Kamisama Dolls?,"I watched the entire anime, but they leave the ending open. There's no further continuation in the manga of what we watched in the anime. They were going to make a movie, but they never did. What happened to the show and the manga? Is there some continuation in some novel? "
3491,What is the meaning of the shaking image in all the Symphogear XV preview image sets?,"On the day before each episode of Symphogear XV airs, a new set of preview pictures are released on the Symphogear XV website. Amongst each set of pictures, there's always exactly one picture that shakes when you hover your mouse over it.  Listed below:   Episode 1: Maria &amp; Hibiki (3rd image) Episode 2: Kirika (4th image) Episode 3: Hibiki vs. Millaarc (4th image) Episode 4: Flustered Bikki (5th image) Episode 5: Tsubasa (2nd image) Episode 6: Ogawa driving (6th image) Episode 7: Elfnein (1st image) Episode 8: Château de Tiffauges (6th image) Episode 9: Fudou (7th image) Episode 10: Bikki waist tape measure (7th image) Episode 11: Millaarc kick (8th image) Episode 12: Yggdrasil (2nd image)   I was wondering, is there any significance behind these particular picture choices? Or were they just chosen arbitrarily? "
3492,What does the following quote by Nagato mean?,"   Even innocent foolish children will grow up in the face of pain, until their thoughts and beliefs are same as their doubts   How can one's thoughts and beliefs be same as their doubts? I can't seem to understand this sentence. One of the biggest reasons I watch Naruto is because of its extraordinary philosophical background.  My reasoning on this quote: Children who grew up in war prone areas always doubt if they deserve to live on this planet or some form of source that ends the suffering. So, here their doubts are, is there really a chance for me to live without pain? An intuitive assertion being that, such a form of life will be impossible and cannot exist and the only way to live is to try and survive against all odds and doing whatever it takes. This enters their belief system and intern imparts their thoughts making them accept the fact that life is not fair for them. Is this interpretation correct or is there a different one?  "
3493,Did Yamamoto Genryuusai use all his power aganist Aizen?,"During the Arrancar war saga in Bleach, Yamamoto fought against Aizen before the arrival of Ichigo. In the end of the fight he used a kidou that almost killed himself tying to defeat Aizen. If I remember, this kidou uses the body as a ""fuel"" for it to work.   Spoiler:      But in the new saga, he showed his bankai against Juha Bach. And it's  very powerful.     He said that never used his full power, why didn't he use it against Aizen? If he underestimated him, why would he use that kidou that almost killed him and ended up losing the fight, instead of using his bankai? "
3494,How does one become a vampire in the universe of Diabolik Lovers?,"How does human turn into vampire in the world of Diabolik Lovers?  We know for a fact      that Yui is a vampire at the end of the anime.   And that one of the brothers mentioned that      no bride ever survived long enough to undergo the transformation.   So, is it ever explained in the anime or the VN? "
3495,"What happened at the end of Fate Zero, What was the wish","The grail is supposed to grant a wish, even in it's incomplete form of not enough sacrifices. Kiritsugu Emiya decided to save the world instead of resurrecting his wife and daughter, so why didn't it happen?   Why did the grail destroy part o the city?  Why was Kirei Kotomine, Gilgamesh, Kariya Matou and Aoi Tohsaka revived?  "
3496,Wasn't Dr Marco a sacrifice?,"This is kinda spoilers if you haven't watched all episodes, but my question is:  Wasn't Dr. Marco one of the few sacrifices? Envy didn't want Marco to die, but in the end wasn't used by Father.  Or did I miss something? Was Marco only captured to create stones?  "
3497,How can a Pure Titans recover the full body after extended period?,"It is said that Ymir spent about 60 years in Pure Titan form. It is also said that Pure Titan only have original subject's spine instead of full body like one of Nine (see ref [25] here or search word ""spine"" if number shifts).  So, how exactly she could recover back to complete human with brain, conciousness and memories while turning into one of Nine? Other transformations explicitly shown or mentioned so far generally only take less than hour between turning human into Pure and upgrading to Nine, so it less of a concern, but 60 years? Shouldn't pretty much of whatever was original Ymir be long lost by then? "
3498,What order should I watch Nurarihyon no Mago in?,"What order should I watch ""Nurarihton no Mago"" and ""Nurarihyon no Mago - Sennen Makyou"" in? Because I'm pretty sure the events from episode 1 of the latter of the 2 take place before the events in the former of the 2. So is that the correct order I should watch them in? "
3499,Where does the Devil Fruit come from?,"Where does the Devil Fruit come from? I know that the Devil Fruits come from a tree. (Is this only a theory or really confirmed?)  Do all different Devil Fruits come from the same tree or from different trees as usual? And where do these tree/trees grow?   And how come that all Devil Fruits are scattered on so many different places in the One Piece world. How did they get there?  A special example would be the ""Fire Devil Fruit"".  How and when did this Devil Fruit get on Dressrosa? "
3500,Are there any studios with good working conditions?,"I've heard a lot of horror stories about how animation studios don't treat their employees very well (or just Japan's corporate culture in general), giving animators poverty wages, overworking them and stressing them out to the point where some commit suicide (there's even a word for that, which I don't remember). Apparantly, animators are treated like dirt over there, even though the bulk of the work comes from them. Is there any truth to that? And if yes, are there any studios with good working conditions? I'm talking mainly about pay, reasonable work schedules and good compensation. "
3501,Why are the seven deadly sins used so often in anime?,"Pretty much as my question states itself. Why are the seven deadly sins used so often?  In a lot of anime I have watched/re-watched, lately I notice either a reference to the 7 deadly sins or their use. For example, in anime like Full Metal Alchemist and Soul Eater, these 7 sins are referenced as an obstacle to bypass or enemies to overcome.  Is there a specific reason for this? Or is this a reference of them being beyond sin? "
3502,"What does the ""S"" stand for in s-rank or s-class?","I know that S rank/class is above the standard A-F ranks/classes. A-F are used because they're the first letters of the alphabet. Is there a reason S is used, and/or does it stand for something? Maybe super or superior? "
3503,Does Ranma's dad prefer to be in Panda form?,"After the first few episodes, for the rest of season 1, we see Ranma's father in his panda form almost exclusively.  For comparison, we see Ranma in both of his forms about equally.  Does Ranma's father prefer his Panda form?  Is this for comedic effect?  Or was it a budgetary thing (ie less voice acting)? "
3504,Which was the first anime to feature mana as energy source for magic?,"Many animes use the idea of ""mana"", an energy source for magic that if it's consumed deny magic users the possibility of casting more spells. Some animes which uses this are A Certain Magical Index (2008) (and spin offs such as A Certain Scientific Accelerator (2019) and A Certain Scientific Railgun (2009)) , Arifureta shokugyou de sekai saikyou (2019), Black Clover (2017), etc , but the first use in a fiction AFAIK was in a 1969 american novel. Then at some point after that and very likely before the animes I mentioned, mana was first used in an anime. But when was this? Which was the first anime to feature mana as energy source for magic? "
3505,How were the Giant Hornets actually defeated?,"In Shinsekai Yori (From the New World), the Robber Fly colony uses the Akki (Fiend) to disarm the Giant Hornet soldiers.   However, in the 18th episode of the anime, it is also revealed that the Giant Hornet soldiers were reduced to nothing but lumps of flesh.   How is that possible? I understand that the Akki is immune to the death feedback when considering humans, but the Akki couldn't have possibly done that to the Giant Hornets, the Akki could have at most disarmed the soldiers.   That being said, how did the Giant Hornets die? Or is this something that is lost in translation? (I was watching the Japanese version with English subtitles). "
3506,Which powers does the Black Asta transformation give to Asta?,So far we see that Asta when transforming into Black Asta can fly and gets his skin covered with some black sustance in parts. But what others powers does he get when transforming? Does he get some protection or enhanced skills? Or is it just the possibility of flying? 
3507,How do 3D objects coincide with traditional 2D animation?,"I was watching an episode of Shirobako. I love how the anime gives you a slight in-depth view on the production process. However, something I can't get my mind around is those few segments that involve CGI (in anime in general) with the interaction of traditional 2D animation such as stationary or moving objects.  In the episode, a scene in Exodus where the girls rides a jeep while avoiding explosion was shown in key animations/""genga"": [website]As you can see, the 3D bike and characters basically move together on a plane. Could it be that the bike is animated frame by frame in traditional animation somehow? Or the other way around? Or could it be more technical than those? "
3508,How does ki work in Black Clover?,"In Black Clover, people has mana and ki. Mana is an energy source for magic and ki is.. well, that's what I want to ask. We know Asta can sense others through ki, but is there anything else? Does ki give people some power like in Dragon Ball? Is  knowing it useful for any other thing? How does ki work in Black Clover? "
3509,Is it possible for a magical knight to increase his amount of mana in Black Clover?,"In Black Clover, some magic knights run out of mana quickly after a few spells and others can use a lot of spells because ""they have a lot of mana"". How does this people to have a lot of mana? Can they train to increase it? Is the mana you are born with the only mana you'll ever have?   To summarize the question, Is it possible for a magical knight to increase his amount of mana in Black Clover? "
3510,"Why is Beethoven's ""Ode to Joy"" so prevalent in anime?","Beethoven's ""Ode to Joy"" is an important song in Evangelion.  The song is also important to the Read Or Die OVA.  And in the 13th episode of Gunslinger Girl, the girls start watching a meteor shower and want to listen to this particular as background music.  Why is this particular song so prevalent in anime? It may be a well-known piece, but there are lots of other well-known pieces of classical music.  According to Wikipedia, the song is played during Japanese New Year's celebrations. That would explain something, but in none of the above examples was there a New Year's celebration.  So, why does anime feature this particular song more heavily than other classical pieces? "
3511,When did Ussop awaken haki?,"Apparently haki does not always need training to achieve; since we have seen Doflamingo and Luffy awaken it unconsciously. But I heard the Ussop and Ace had the same unexpected, brief ""awakening"" of conqueror's haki, so when did that happen? Is it also in the manga? "
3512,Does the demon slayer sword have any advantage over the demon dweller sword?,"The first 2 swords Asta have are the demon slayer sword and the demon dweller sword. As far as I understand the demon dweller sword can nullify spells like the first sword, and it glows and it seems like it can fire some energy at long range when he makes a slash. How about the first sword? Does the first sword have any advantage over the second sword? "
3513,How does the hierarchy of the Elite 10 Council work?,"Do these seat rankings indicate one's cooking level or skill? If so, which seat represents the best cook?  I was trying to figure out if Seat 1 > Seat 10 or vice versa, but I couldn't find anything nor remember which seat is better to have. It seems like Seat 1 is probably the best seat since Doujima and Saiha were portrayed to be the best cooks in Seats 1 and 2, but I just can't find anything explicitly saying Seat 1 is the best. "
3514,Why is it that the majority of Gardes pilots are females?,"In Sidonia no Kishi, why is it that the majority of the Gardes pilot are females? I'm fully aware that they have a third gender, however, most of the pilots are taking the female form. Why is that? Was it ever been explained? Does being female help them in photosynthesizing?  "
3515,Did Kendo practicing helped Kirito in SAO?,"At the second season of Sword Art Online we can see Kirito and his sister practicing Kendo:     In this scene, he used a similar fighting style that he used in the game. Is it possible to say that practicing Kendo or other fighting sports could help people in Sword Art Online? I mean, being strong or fast in real life, Did it have some influence in the gameplay at SAO? If so, people like Kirito could have some advantage? "
3516,"What was it that the ""Cocoon l'Cie"" summoned against Ragnarok in the Pompa Sancta Parade?","During the Pompa Sancta Parade in Nautilus in Chapter 8 we see a number of familiar Final Fantasy Summons.   Carbuncle comes out from the disk Vanille is holding the ""Pulse l'Cie"" summons Ifrit the ""Cocoon l'Cie"" summons Ramuh   when the ""Pulse l'Cie"" Transforms into Ragnarok we see the ""Cocoon l'Cie"" summon or transform into something aswell to fight it. though i'm not sure what it is and wouldn't put it past the game to have made up something new (like with Vanille's and Sazh's Eidolon).  So i am wondering what was it the ""Cocoon l'Cie"" summoned against Ragnarok in the Pompa Sancta Parade? "
3517,What's the difference between Toshiro and Ichigo's Zanpakuto lore?,"In the series, it's explained that Zangetsu is a part of Ichigo and was suppressing his powers. Since he didn't want Ichigo to become a shinigami, he was practically always hindered Ichigo, as one day he might have to kill him depending on his changes.  Sorry but I read the following part in a wiki. Zangetsu tells Ichigo that the Zanpakuto is physical representation of Ichigo's power, and Ichigo remembers its red ribbon from his friend.  This is where I get a little confused. In one episode, Toshiro and another guy had same dream about the sword and both wielded the sword for a short time. The Soul Society then decided only one can wield him. However, if the Zanpakuto is a part of a shinigami, then how can two people have same power? And how come Toshiro had dreams about wielding the sword, while Ichigo didn't? If it wasn't for Rukia power awaking and Urahara forcing through Kido, Ichigo could never have become a shinigami.   It's like Toshiro's Zanpakuto was given to him by Soul Society because they agreed he was worthy of it after beating the other guy. "
3518,How closely does Rurouni Kenshin resemble real life?,"Rurouni Kenshin is an anime based on several historical facts. How accurately are the events in the series portrayed?  I don't mean just historical events used in the series, such as the Shinsengumi, but how accurate is their real life portrayal of the art of swordsmanship. Is it really possible to obtain such power with dedication to daily training portrayed in the series? "
3519,What is Mikage's status (in the spirit/god world) after he passes the Tochigami Crest to Nanami? Is he still a god?,"Mikage passed the Tochigami Crest (the symbol of divinity and ownership of his temple) to Nanami, but obviously retained several of his powers.      Like when he converted Nanami's dress into a butterfly pattern before her ritual dance in the end of 1st season.   He is no longer a god, because      he did not attend the Izumo meeting in the second season.   and also because      the host god of the Izumo meeting [name pending] specifically states that Mikage is hard to find because he is no longer a god.   So, what is Mikage as of the Izumo meeting? He is not a god. Is he a youkai, a fallen deity, or what?  EDIT: In the episode S2E4 ""The Goddess Makes Her Second Romantic Confession"", Mikage is shown at the god's summit closing banquet. So he has some divine status, but the divine familiars of Nanami and also the shrine spirits are there too, so that banquet is not deity-exclusive. "
3520,"What happened to the manga ""Me and the Devil Blues""?","What happened to the manga ""Me and the Devil Blues"" by Hiramoto Akira?   On MAL there's no finish date, but it looks like there hasn't been a new chapter in years.  Also, the author has since started a new work.  Did it end? Go on hiatus? Or get cancelled? "
3521,"What did Canute mean by ""this snow is love"" in chapter 34?","In chapter 34 of Vinland Saga manga, Canute seems to realize something, and starts narrating with ""this snow is love"". From page 33-36,     Pg. 33 I understand. It is as though a fog has lifted from my mind. (While holding a snowball) this snow is love.      Pg. 34 This sky... this earth... the blowing wind. The trees, the mountains...      Pg. 35 ...... but... how must I express it... though this world... though the work of God holds so much beauty...      Pg. 36 Is there no love in the heart of man?   I don't quite understand what the chapter means. Is this referring to the Christian religion? Could anyone explain to me what's this chapter's wisdom? "
3522,Why did Kurama keep helping Naruto?,"As I was browsing through an old question, the answer shocked me. It seems that if Naruto were killed, Kurama would just revive. Then why did Kurama give Naruto some of its chakra when he was on the verge of death? For instance, when Naruto first summoned Gamabunta while falling to his potential death, Kurama gave him some chakra and helped him out. Wasn't Kurama's dream to break free from Naruto? What's the need of breaking the seal when he can just let Naruto die and he is free? He did push Naruto to the point of opening the gate when Naruto fought with Pain. Why not just sit tight and let Naruto die? Did I miss something? All this while I thought if the host dies so does the tailed beast. "
3523,"Does Wendy Marvell have a couple? If not, why?","Fairy Tail has ended, but I realize that Wendy doesn't seem to have a relationship with a man as a couple.  I think it's logical because she's too young to get a couple.  Is my reasoning true? Otherwise, is there any reason why she doesn't have a couple? "
3524,Does Toaru Kagaku no Railgun continues after the 2 seasons of the anime in the manga?,I've finished watching the Toaru Kagaku no Railgun 2 seasons of anime. Does the story continue in the manga? Or is it finished already? 
3525,Is Goku using God ki when he uses Ultra Instinct?,"We know Goku in Super Saiyan God and in Super Saiyan Blue uses God ki. And apparently, he can also use God ki in base form. So, my question is, is Goku using God ki when he uses Ultra Instinct? Does the anime show something about this?   "
3526,Can more than one person have the same devil fruit power?,"How come in the island Amazon Lily, the snake princess's sisters have the same devil fruit power?  Since only one person can have any given devil fruit power at a time, does it have to do with blood line or something? "
3527,Where is Yuma Kuga’s mother?,"If you think about it, we all know what Yuma’s father, Yugo, looks like and what happened to him, but the manga and anime never seems to mention Yuma’s mother. Whatever happened to her? Is she dead, did she and Yugo have a divorce, or what? Because there had to be a relationship with a woman if Yuma is Yugo’s son. (Or is Yuma adopted?) "
3528,How many transformations does Drive Knight have?,"In the last chapter of the manga, Drive Knight transformed into      a sort of motorcycle.    In a past chapter of the manga and episode of the anime IIRC, he transformed into a centaur. Does he have more transformations?  How many transformations does Drive Knight have? "
3529,What was the purpose of sending the parasites to Earth?,"I'm still wondering, as it was not revealed in the anime version, why the parasites were sent to Earth? Was there any purpose to it? "
3530,How did the Hyuga clan come to be?,"So as we have seen in the Hagoromo filler:     Hagoromo didn't inherit the Byakugan and could not pas it over so a clan (Like Uchiha with Sharingan) Can be born. and we see that Hamura has the Byakugan, but he leaves and goes to the moon, and we see in ""The Last: Naruto The Movie"" That he formed a clan on the moon and there was a whole civilization there, but before he takes off for the moon there was no mention of his romantic life and no indication that he took someone with him.     So when was the Hyuga clan formed? did Hamura came back and took someone and formed a clan? or is this just a plot hole? "
3531,Analysis of target demographic?,"This question will seem a bit weird so I'll give a bit of background.   I like to view anime that follow a specific genre and target audience.   So naturally when a new title pops up on here, MAL, from friends or whatever I promptly Google it to see if it's something I'd like or not.   Is there a way to infer a target audience from analyzing the content of the first episode?   What I mean is if there are tell tale signs of each genre (ex. Supernatural, romance, sports) and demographic(ex. Shonen, seinen, shojo, josei etc.) that seasoned anime fans look for that allow you to know the genre and demographic without prior research?  If there is a viewing style or technique involved I'd like to know it. "
3532,Is there any connection between the Gundam series?,"I have watched a few (very few) gundam series, and to me they seem like independent mecha anime series.  Is there any connection between the Gundam series? Or are each of them in separate universes? "
3533,Does anime with more ecchi scene pays their seiyuu more compared to the non-ecchi anime?,"Seeing Citrus anime that aired Winter 2018 season made me thinking. This anime has so many ecchi scene. Yuzu and Mei kissed and did so many perverted acts.  Had this been boy-girl kissing scene it might be considered okay and normal enough. Problem is, Yuzu and Mei are both female, thus their kissing scenes are ecchi enough. Taketatsu Ayana (Yuzu's seiyuu) and Tsuda Minami (Mei's seiyuu) would have to make lots of perverted noises for those scenes.  This reminds me that High School DxD also has Itou Shizuka (Himejima Akeno's seiyuu) and Hikasa Youko (Ria's Gremory's seiyuu) make lots of similar noises for the recording.  While Itou Shizuka is also well known to be a seiyuu for Eroge, even she was embarrassed when she had to do many perverted noises during recording in front of many other seiyuus (read it somewhere but forget where, will update with link if I can find the said article again). Itou-san went as far as crying to Asakawa Yuu (provider of Megurine Luka vocaloid, also seiyuu for many Eroge) due to the embarrassment.  It should also be noted that both Itou-san and Asakawa-san used pseudonym for Eroge voicing. This suggest that such a work is not really desirable or at least it definitely is not at the top of desirable jobs to do. You don't have Hanazawa Kana do Eroge voicing now, do you?  Now, returning to Citrus, Taketatsu Ayana and Tsuda Minami was not a fresh, newly graduated seiyuu. They have worked in the industry for quite a long time and has built name for themselves.  Does this means that anime with many perverted scenes pays their seiyuu more?  Note: to make things clear, by ecchi here I mean the perverted noise the seiyuu has to make for the scene, and not the perverted image. "
3534,What are those weird three-line blushy things on some anime/manga characters cheeks?,"Some anime/manga characters (OR, those inspired by anime/manga) have those weird three-line blushy things on their cheeks. These characters tend to be cutesy and childish.  What are those lines called (a Japanese term would be appreciated)? What exactly are they for? Are they just blushes or something?    "
3535,Why did the Deucalion lift off from underwater in the start of Season 2 in Aldnoah Zero?,"If I'm not mistaken, the Deucalion was stuck to the side of Saazbaum's landing castle right? How come on the Season 2 Episode 1 scene where Yuki rescued Inaho, they were underwater? "
3536,What are the requirements to be a warlord?,Is there like a set list of things you need? And can there only be 7 at one time?  
3537,Gekko Moria's whereabouts?,Does anyone know exactly what hapened to Gekko Moriah? IIRC he was in the Marineford arc. But I haven't seen anything of him post time-skip?   Did I miss some development or something?  
3538,What does the scene where Shino holds a baby above her head refer to?,There's this scene in Seitokai Yakuindomo (8:55 in this YouTube video) where Shino holds a baby above her head with lightning in the background and exclaims 'This is my son!'.    I've seen this reference elsewhere but I'm not sure which show its referencing.   What does this scene refer to? 
3539,Did L win against Light?,"Did L win against Light? Let me elaborate:  After L's death in episode 25, we assume that Light won. But in episode 26, L leaves a message in his computer (which Light deletes in the same episode).    Also, at the end of the episode, we see that some data is being sent from L's personal computer.  So, my question is: did he know/confirm that Light was Kira and sent the case data to Near?    Note:By ""winning"", I mean that L defeated Light in their mind game/battle. L had confirmed that Light is Kira( but could not prove it in front of the whole world). He was able to see that Light would come to kill him in the future and confirmed that Light is Kira (when Light smiles at L's dying body). This is purely a theory based on the possibility that the transmitted data can indeed be the case data stating Light as Kira. "
3540,How did Jiraiya find out Tsunade's breast size?,"Jiraiya stated that Tsunade's oppai size was 106cm.  From Tsunade article:     Despite being known as flat-chested in her childhood, she now has a rather large bust; 106 centimetres in circumference, according to Jiraiya.   From Jiraiya article:      when caught spying on Tsunade in his younger years, she proceeded to break both of his arms, six of his ribs, and ruptured a number of organs as punishment.   Considering the amount of fear and respect Jiraiya then developed towards her, how did he know the measurement of the adult Tsunade?  Source: [website](I'm really sorry about the quality of the video)  Below is the image from the corresponding scene in the manga (chapter 406, page 9):   "
3541,Why do character colors sometimes suddenly change?,"I've seen this used in almost all of the episodes, where during a fight or a scene the colors of the characters will change almost immediately, almost to an inverted color scheme, or sometimes a more muted color scheme.  In this scene, you'll notice that Josuke's Stand, Crazy Diamond, is normally colored blue/pink, yet during the fight switches to blue/green, while Killer Queen, who is normally Pink/Black/Gold, is switched to Gold/Black/Blue (body, gloves, skullpiece).  In another fight, seen here, not only does Josuke and Yoshikage change colors, but their stands change color to yet another different color, with Crazy Diamond turning blue/brown, and Kira Queen turning Blue/Green/Yellow.  Another example of Yoshikage and Josuke:      Is there a specific reason for doing this technique?  Why has David Co ""switched"" the colors sometimes during a fight? "
3542,"Why does Midousuji always say ""Gross!""?","Midousuji always says ""Gross!"", but why does he do so?  For example, a scene where he says ""Gross"".     You pedal so hard. Just how high is your cadence? Gross.        "
3543,What is the point of the incest in the research group?,"In episode 6 of B The Beginning, we learn that a group of researchers:       ""Without a particular plan, they began an inbreeding program which produced malformed, insane offspring the called the Promising Ones"".   It seems that the incest/inbreeding probably wouldn't be relevant, especially because the researchers didn't have a clue how to work on the material (the stuff they were researching), nor how to determine if one was more or less qualified to work with it.  Why then, is it included?  What purpose does the inbreeding have?  Or is it just to feed into anime's obsession with incest?  I tried to word the question such that it wouldn't be one giant spoiler.  To anyone who is familiar with the source material, this should make sense.  To others, it's just more common tropes. "
3544,Did Obito let Kakashi win?,"So, during Obito and Kakashi's fight in the Kamui dimension, Obito gets a hole in his chest. After watching the episode, most of the viewers commented that Obito ""was defeated"" even though he had the Rinnegan. But wasn't it because Obito ""let"" Kakashi win to undo Madara's Seal (as we see in chapter 675, Obito gets to know about the seal and wishes to undo it) and become the Ten Tails Jinchuuriki? Also, I wanted to know that would Kakashi (a non-Uchiha and a non-Senju) have been able to actually defeat Obito? Because during their fight, Obito didn't use Izanagi or even one Rinnegan ability (even though, just moments later, he seals the Ten Tails inside him with the Rinnegan). I am compelled to say this, but Obito's abilities are no joke.  Please provide a convincing answer to explain exactly what happened during the fight and what would've happened if Obito was really serious. "
3545,Why are some anime and manga unlicensed?,"Usually, I see that all anime and manga are licensed! But sometimes I see that some anime or manga are not licensed. Why is that so?  Therefore, I am asking what is the difference between licensed and unlicensed anime and manga? And what does that mean for the producers, television stations, websites (and other who ""buy"" and publish the anime/ manga) and for the anime/ manga fans?  Also how does the process for licensing an anime work?  Could you this explain this through an example like these?   One Piece (licensed anime) Free!: Eternal Summer (unlicensed anime) Death Note (licensed manga) Hetalia (unlicensed manga)  "

3547,What do we know about Shirase's family?,"The whole premise of A Place Further than the Universe is that Shirase's mother disappeared on an Antarctic expedition a number of years ago, and that Shirase is going to Antarctica to find her. Of the rest of Shirase's family, only her grandmother seems to be mentioned. After Kimari asks her in ep. 1 if she can really go to Antarctica, she says:     That's what everyone says. My grandma, my friends, my teachers, my upperclassmen, and my neighbors &hellip;   There is also a brief appearance of Shirase's grandmother in ep. 3, towards the beginning.  Do we know anything about Shirase's family beyond her missing mother and her grandmother? For instance, do we know anything at all about Shirase's father? There are flashbacks to Gin's past interactions with Takako and Shirase in ep. 9, but other than that, there is not much to go upon. "
3548,Can someone identify this girl in Nurarihyon no Mago?,"I left the title ambiguous as my question is slightly spoiler-ish.      Who is this girl who killed Nura Rikuo's father, Nura Rihan?      Did they actually say who she was? Or am I right that they never flat out said it?      Hagoromo Gitsune was still sealed, so it couldn't have been her. But I know it has something to do with Hagoromo Gitsune's curse.  "
3549,"Why does the old man in episode 2 describe Oubu as ""a part"" of the thing that razed Ueno?","In episode 2, when Oubu ascends to the surface, an old man describes it as ""a part"" of the thing that razed Ueno.     In what sense is Oubu ""a part""? Oubu at this time does look slightly different than it did during the incident in Ueno (probably just because Oubu changes shape a bit depending on how powered-up/powered-down it is). Now:    And then:    But Oubu (unlike Entei) was no more or less ""complete"" now than in the past, so I'm not sure what the old man means. (Maybe he's just senile?) "
3550,What happened to London?,"At the very beginning of episode 13, when Epimew responds to Guy's summons to deal with a Buranki, we watch Epimew fly by London, the ""former capital"".     What on earth happened to London? Given that Big Ben is there, London must've at least been thriving until 1859 or so (assuming that things happened at the same time in the Bubuki Buranki time line as in the real world), but by 2040, it's been thoroughly overgrown. Some sort of Buranki-related incident? "
3551,No. 17 official status,"Be aware that this question contain spoilers from episode 127, 128 and 130.  So in episode 127 it was shown that 17 self sacrificed in order to save Goku and Vegeta. This resulted in referee saying that they could assume that he self destructed which resulted in Jiren getting no penalty. Is this correctly translated from japanese? Hence meaning that the referee indicates that 17 wasn't officially eliminated. In the godpad he was also never removed by the Zenos.   In episode 128 when Vegeta dropped out we were only shown a part of the godpad, the top row. 17 is on the bottom row, meaning there is no official status about it yet.  In episode 130 he makes a return. Were the previous episodes made like that in japanese as well (text wise) in order to indicate that 17 is still in the tournament? Or was he officially eliminated making his current status exactly what?   I find this extremely confusing as in the past there had been some translation errors meaning that a sentence can hold a different meaning from the original intended one. As far as I can tell he was never officially removed, meaning referee and Zenos were aware of this and didn't remove him. Or are they surprised and were they perhaps unaware, meaning that there was an error of judgement on their side? "
3552,Difference between a code and geass?,Code seems to be obtained after your geass upgrades to full power and you kill a code bearer. What happens to your geass after you obtain the code? Do you lose your geass? Is code an extra power? What is the difference between these two? 
3553,"Why do some works [anime, manga, novels] have a trailing dot?","Pure curiosity.  Why do some series carry a dot [.] at the end of their titles? Is there a meaning to it or is it convention?  Ex: Ore, Twintail ni Narimasu., Kobato. "
3554,"What does the term ""Kage"" in ""Kage Bunshin no Jutsu"" actually refer to?","   Kage Bunshin no Jutsu (影分身の術) literally translates into Shadow Clone Technique.

3558,Confusion about ending of Oregairu Season 2,What exactly was Yui trying to do in the ending of Oregairu Season 2?  I interpreted it in three ways:   She's going to fight for Hachiman and declares war on Yukino. She's trying to maintain the status quo of the group and just have them be friends forever. She's giving up on Hachiman and letting Yukino have Hachiman whilst also making Yukino admit her own feelings for him.   Which one is right? 
3559,Why does Harara have boobs?,"Why does Harara Hagakure have boobs?  We see them from the beginning of the OVA (meaning, there is never a time that he doesn't have boobs), and the boots of his armor have heels like a set of female armor would.  He's constantly referred to as Kakugo Hagakure's older brother.  Back in those days, strange production things happened, so was it a sudden change in story after the animation had been completed?  Or is this a translation issue? Like Sanji's lolipop, for example. "
3560,What is the jokes in regards to Dragonball Character names?,"While watching the Co-Optional Podcast (Episode 209. after 1:47:50 when it says ""anime thing""), when talking about Dragonball Fighters and how Broly and Bardock were the only 2 confirmed to be being released in future TotalBiscuit said that the names sounded like vegetables. in response Dodger said that the names of Saiyans were supposed to be vegetable puns like how the names of Bumla's family were jokes on underwear.  I admit Broly sorta sound like like Brocoli but not sure how Bardock is a joke on a vegetable, nor how Nappa or Goku (or even Kakarot) are jokes either (Gohan might since i know Gohan is sometimes used in Japanese for ""food"")  So what are these jokes/puns and are they categorized/themed as Dodger said? "
3561,Why is Suzaku able to see C.C. through the Knightmare?,"When Zero (Lelouch) asked for a private meeting with Euphemia, there was a scene where Suzaku was able to see C.C. in the cockpit. C.C. was curious how.  She said, ""looks like he can see me [...] is it because of what happened in Narita and Kamine?"" Then she said, ""or is he also? [...] if that's the case""  What does she mean by ""is he also?""?  The way Suzaku saw her is also the same as when C.C. was still inside the tank in the pilot episode. "
3562,What does this grinning gesture signify?,"The gif below shows Noriko from minute 11 of GunBuster's episode 3.    This is the dialogue directly preceding it:     Noriko: I should at least memorize basic space manoeuvring patterns. [...]      Smith: All that stuff is useless in real combat.      Noriko: Why do you have to keep patronizing me?      Smith: 'cause your such a cute little freshman.      Noriko: I'll have you know that Onee-sama and I are the best   team in the entire Top Squadron! A ""solo"" like you with no partner   couldn't possibly appreciate everything we've been through together as   a team. So long!   In terms of usage it seems somewhat interchangeable with the Eyelid pull taunt. I assumed it is meant to show defiance, kind of like baring one's teeth but in a more cheeky way?  The sound she makes is ""bi-"" I would say, but her action doesn't really fit any of the common uses of that onomatopoeia which I'm aware of.   I feel I've seen this before but I couldn't find it among any of the teeth and smile realated tropes on tvtropes.  So, TL;DR, does this have a name, is it repeated throughout anime and signifies something particular or is it just Noriko being random and I'm overthinking it? "
3563,Why is Nisekoi's name written in Katakana?,"Noticed it first in this Jump cover in the bottom right corner:    Katakana is used for spelling out foreign words. Nisekoi is Japanese for ""fake love"". So, why is katakana used? Just to make the name seem more ""cool""? "
3564,Questions regarding Goku's special training as shown in episode 71 of Dragon Ball Super,"In epsiode 71 of Dragon Ball Super, Goku is shown to have some kind of special training. It seems that Whis knows what Goku is doing but doesn't want to tell Vegeta.   My questions are:   What is the special training that Goku is currently undergoing? Why doesn't Whis tell Vegeta about this? Why Beerus says that ""Goku is the leading fighter..."" even though till the last fight (i.e., with Zamasu) both seemed to be on equal level? Does it mean that Goku is again going to get stronger than Vegeta?  "
3565,Are there any differences between normal anime compared to Netflix original series's anime?,"Recently, more and more Netflix original series (anime) pop up in my feed and so far, all of them are of extremely high quality. This goes in audio, visuals and usually story as well. Most of them are fairly unique compared to the mainstream ones.   So what I am curious about is if these are different from normal series. Like, do they have limitations for publication? For example, most series in Japan are for Japan only and are only able to leave the country through shipping DVDs or illegal streaming services. Is a Netflix original basically the same without any limits for publication?   What about production costs? Are those covered by Netflix and is the cast for example appointed by Netflix or does Netflix maybe have their own teams behind the shows?   Normally I wouldn't be bothered by this, but I have noticed a significant difference in quality from the big hits in Japan and Netflix original series. For example, most shows tend to forget about background characters, surround audio etc. In Netflix originals, I have yet to encounter these minor quality flaws. So what is it that makes the major difference between them?   I do am aware that legally the Netflix originals can only be found on Netflix. Does this mean that Netflix might be a new competitor in the anime industry?  "
3566,Are the Crab God and other supernatural creatures metaphors?,"I'm new to the Monogatari series; got into it because Nisio Isin wrote Medaka Box and also GIFs I found online.  I just don't understand whether we are intended to take the supernatural parts of the show to understand the characters or whether they are important on their own yet. For example, in the LNs, does the monologue hint at what is reality and what is made up?  How much of the content in the show can be chalked up to hallucination, etc.? Is the crab god really there? Or is it a metaphor for her not carrying her trauma, thus she is weightless? Or both? "
3567,Which powers/skills does Noumu have?,"It's mentioned and shown in the anime that Noumu has shock absorption, regeneration and it's as strong as All Might. Are those all the powers it has? Or does it have other powers? "
3568,How many students are there at Hagun Academy?,"After watching Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry, I found myself confused by what seems to be a plot hole. Specifically, the anime depicts the qualifying matches at Hagun academy for the Seven Stars Sword Art tournament. The qualifying matches seem to be a 20-round single-elimination tournament with 6 winners. This is never outright stated, but many points of dialogue suggest this rather strongly, and at the very least it is stated explicitly in the last episode of the anime that all of the competitors on the last day had won 19 matches.  The 6 winners:         By basic math, a single-elimination tournament with 6 winners and 20 rounds would imply that there are about 6.3 million entrants to the qualifying tournament. That number of students at the school seems to be effectively impossible. For comparison, the population of New York City is about 8 million people, and the total number of high school students in Japan in 2011 was about 3.5 million. So this seems unreasonably large as an absolute number.  In addition, the number is too large relative to the size of the school. The area of Hagun Academy is said to be more than 10 times the size of the Tokyo Dome (according to [website]So, I'm wondering, is this really the right number of students at the school? If not, is there some explanation for how the tournament has 20 rounds, or is this just a plot hole? "

However, he was OK with Olmine providing support through magic spells.  Why is Toyohisa OK with Olmine contributing to the fight, but not Jeanne?  Is it the manner in which they contribute?  Is spellcasting OK, but fighting with a sword not OK? "
3570,"What does the original Japanese title of ""Spirited Away"" mean?","The original title of the Japanese anime ""Spirited Away"" is ""千と千尋の神隠し"".

3571,What did Tsunozaki Taki say?,"In chapter 86 of Shokugeki no Soma as Yukihira was about to start whipping up some mad beef stew, this happened (roughly went like this):     Soma: You were Tsunozaki Taki senpai... right?      Tsuno: Huh? (What's with this guy?! He just went and talked to me normally!)      Soma: It seems you've been saying lots about me. I'll listen to your complaints, after I finish serving my dish!!!!   I've read through this bit quite a few times, and I still have no clue what Soma is referring to when he says ""seems you've been talking smack about me"". I didn't even know she existed until that chapter. Maybe I'm missing something crucial? "
3572,Why is it (almost) always a 10 years gap? What is so special with 10 years intervals?,"It seems there is something special in anime and manga about 10 years gaps. They seem to me that they will become a different person in 10 years.   Yes, I know people age and a decade is a long time. I can think of the me 10 years ago, and he was something of a mess.  But why is it always 10 years? not nine or eleven, 10... always 10. The list is enormous:   My wife is Wagatsuna-san: the MC can timeskip 10 years, to a time when he is married with the eponymous girl. Horimiya: in ch10 Izumi remembers his old self 10 years ago. Orange: the letters from their future selves is from 10 years ahead. Bleach: - ch 685 has a 10 years time skip. Dragonball: ch 518 has a 10 years timeskip. Soushin Shoujo Matoi Matoi's mother saved the world 10 years ago. Strike the Blood when Minamiya Natsuki lost her memory, she was turned into 10 years younger version of herself.   I am sure I've seen other 10 years intervals in other titles, the list could go on and on.  What is so magical about the 10 year gap? "
3573,Salary of the Prize Queen?,Does anyone know exactly how much a prize queen is paid? I know it must be a lot since that is Nozomi's goal and all. But is there a precise dollar amount stated?   Or is it implied to be the same tier as like a world champion? 
3574,What is the purpose of Zero's tattoo?,I've watched the Vampire Knight anime and noticed that Zero has this tattoo on his neck. See below.    In one of the episodes Yuki is given a bracelet that is meant to have a spell on it and told the bracelet can be used to stop Zero. The headmaster holds the bracelet up to Zero's tattoo to show what it does. It appears as if it temporarily paralyses him. The bracelet looks as if it has the same symbol on it as Zero's tattoo.    Was there no purpose to it previously? Or did it have a different purpose?  In another episode when he is struggling with his blood lust the tattoo appears to have changed and got bigger and has veins coming out of it.  This left me wondering: What is the main purpose behind it? Or is there actually no purpose at all.

3577,Why is the hair of Howl was colored black when he was young?,"In the beginning-middle of the movie, Sophie accidentally made Howl paint his hair black instead of his natural blonde color. I also suspect that this is his natural color because he felt so upset after the incident. But if this is right, then why Sophie saw him in the vision in his current color (black) which he got years after that scenario.  Was that an accident in script? or is there another meaning for that part of the story? "
3578,"Is super saiyan god a ""super saiyan"" transformation, or does just it have a missleading name?","After watching the trailer of the new Dragon Ball movie, where a villain with an armor similar to saiyans appear and it has yellow eyes,     I started to wonder if a super saiyan transformation can have eyes of a different color than blue, so I started to check,  SSJ1, USSJ, SSJ2, SSJ3, blue eyes, SS Rage, blue eyes, Legendary SS , blue eyes, SS Blue, blue eyes, SS Blue evolution, blue eyes,  SS Rosé, pink eyes, but I'm not sure if this counts because it comes from a half god / half saiyan, Ultra Instinct grey eyes, but apparently this isnt a super saiyan transformation, but a form any race can get, SSJ4 yellow eyes but it's non canon,  And the only one that's left is super saiyan god with red eyes, but is this transformation a real ""super saiyan"" transformation or it's just a missleading name? Super Saiyan Blue is attained by ""getting the power of a super saiyan god and transforming into a super saiyan"" . So how can you transform into a super saiyan if you already have the power of a ""super saiyan"" god? Wouldnt this mean the ""super saiyan"" god is a missleading name and it isnt a ""super saiyan"" transformation but another kind of saiyan transformation? "
3579,How do Toads in Naruto produce Oil?,"Toad oil as shown on Mount Myoboku was produced from a special fountain that allowed user to more easily feel the natural energy around them. This was used in the initial stages of Senjutsu training by Jiraiya and Naruto.  However, We've seen several combo jutsu's used by Jiraiya which rely on the Toads spitting Oil (Toad Oil Bullet). Which can be lit on fire or even mixed with both Wind and Fire Jutsu. We know toads can manipulate Chakra and are mostly affiliated with Water Style.  So Is the toad oil produced naturally in the Toad's stomach's or is it something that they achieve by nature manipulation (manipulating multiple chakra natures, similar to Kekkei Genkai)?  Update: I understand ""Toad Oil"" based techniques utilize chakra, but the source of the oil is not explained. I have read the wiki entries and Wiki just states ""converts Chakra to oil"" but doesn't explain it. Is it like the Dragon Flame produced by Dragons? For an in universe example take a look at Katsuyu and her/its ability. I can see Slugs producing Slime and Katsuyu using that slime similar to that of the Mizukage's Acid Release. This is both a Nature transformation and Kekkei Genkai, while also possible naturally. Do toads naturally produce this oil, do a nature transformation, Is there any myth that attributes toad spitting oil etc. is what my question moves toward.  Additionally, for those confused about Ying-Yang techniques and Nature Transformations should go through the wikia page and read the cited information! Naruto Wikia - nature Transformation     Aside from the five elemental nature transformations, there is a second kind of nature transformation that are the source of all non-elemental techniques such as the Shadow Imitation Technique, Multi-Size Technique, medical ninjutsu, genjutsu, etc. There is Yin Release (陰遁, Inton), based on the imagination and spiritual energy of a shinobi, and Yang Release (陽遁, Yōton), based on the vitality and physical energy of a shinobi. Together, they are used to perform Yin–Yang Release (陰陽遁, In'yōton, Onmyōton).    You can't just club any random technique to be Ying/Yang.  Additional Update: Trivia section of Wikia for the Nature transformation gave an interesting lead.     Techniques such as the Toad Oil Bullet and the Poison Mist mention ""converting"" or ""kneading"" chakra into materials or substances, but have never been mentioned to use certain chakra natures.    So I think I am not the only one unsure how these techniques are performed! "

Both were seen discussing about telling her theory to Light's father in front of the two receptionist before she became missing. Most police head quarters have CCTV cameras attached, so it should have been used by the police to get a clue about her before she went missing the day she visited the police. If she was alive after that day, she would have tried to visit the police head quarters again.  As per receptionists/ CCTV cameras she was last seen with Light and Light offering her to give the tip, so he can on behalf of her tell it to his father, even offering his phone. At least the initial investigation should have started with interrogating Light about her. How was this scenario missed by L and his Team? Is this not a goof? "
3588,How exactly did Yuma Kuga get to earth?,"If you think about it, Yuma tells Osamu about his coming to Earth, and yet Yuma never says how. Did Replica turn into a space-ship or something?

3590,What characterizes an EVA pilot?,"As far as I'm concerned, all the students in Shinji's classroom were candidates to become EVA pilots. That's all I know, but I don't remember if this is ever addressed:  What makes an EVA pilot? I mean, what special quality makes someone more capable of piloting an EVA than others? So basically, all the students in Shinji's classroom had this special quality? What was it? "
3591,What does the disk that fell on the ground contain?,"I’ve watched Chobits years ago and was curious.  The first episode/chapter tells us about how Hideki found Chii in the dumpster.  According to the plot description in the Wikipedia article Chobits (bold emphasis mine):     The series centers on the life of Hideki Motosuwa, a held-back student attempting to qualify for university by studying at Seki prep school in Tokyo. Besides a girlfriend, he dreams of having a persocom (パソコン?): an android used as a personal computer, which is expensive. On his way home one evening, he stumbles across a persocom in the form of a beautiful girl with floor-length hair lying against a pile of trash bags, and he carries her home, not noticing that a disk fell on the ground. Upon turning her on, she instantly regards Hideki with adoration. The only word the persocom seems capable of saying is ""chi"" (ちぃ Chii?), thus he names her that.   What does the disk contain? "
3592,What states besides Japan have a/the Sibyl System?,"I'm in the middle of Psycho-Pass Season 1.  Without spoiling, what states besides Japan have a (or the?) Sibyl System? There's this part in Episode 13 where 'world' rather than 'Japan' is used. Does the Sibyl System cover the whole world? Does it or do the dominators apply to anyone anywhere even in Antartica or International Waters? Are the police in third world countries using dominators?  I highly doubt Japan is the only place that has a/the Sibyl System because I don't see why the UN would just allow Japan if it disagreed or would not follow Japan if it agreed. It's like The Walking Dead: I highly doubt it's only the US that's infected. If so, the UN likely would've intervened already.  If any of these cannot be answered without spoilers, please use >! and indicate degree of spoilers (or whatever is the site policy for questions like this). "
3593,What are the reference of Heaven's Lost Property to the Greek Mythology?,"In Heaven's Lost property, there are some obvious references to Greek Mythology, such as Zeus' cannon which is obviously linked to the Greek God Zeus.    What are the references to Sora No Otoshimono in Greek Mythology? Are there any links between the references and the character designs?    This question is intended to be self-answered, but other hints and recommendations are welcome. "
3594,Are Jinchūriki immune to Genjutsu?,"So, everyone knows that Killer Bee instantly broke the Genjustu which Sasuke cast on him. How about other Jinchūriki? We know that Jinchūriki have a lot of chakra because of their Tailed Beasts and they could use this chakra to free themselves from Genjustu.  So, can we say that they are immune to Genjutsu?  "
3595,Why was Pikachu chosen to be the main Pokemon of the anime?,"In the Red and Blue game version of Pokemon, the 3 starters are Squirtle, Charmander and Bulbasaur.   As the anime is based on the game, it would be logical that the main Pokemon (the one with Ash since the beginning) is one of those three starters.  Is there any specific reason why any of those three Pokemon weren't chosen to be the mascot? Why and how was Pikachu chosen by the producers over all the 150 other Pokemon? "
3596,Why are Hajime's attack names in French?,"In ""Gatchaman Crowds"", the main protagonist is a 16-year old girl named Hajime Ichinose.  When Hajime fights in Gatchaman mode, she has several attacks:    Blanc et Noir (""Black and White"") Petits Ciseaux (""Little scissors"") Balles Patsels Wings de l'Avenir (""Wings of the future"" - a mix of English and French since the French word for ""Wings"" is ""Ailes"") Grand Ciseaux (""Big scissors"")   (The attacks where listed on the Gatchaman Wiki. ""Balles Patsels"" may be a misspelling - maybe it was ""balles pastels"", ""Pastel-colored balls"").  The ""scissors"" theme is logical, since one of Hajime's favorite spare-time activities is Kirigami. What's remarkable is the names of the attacks: the other Gatchaman team members have attacks with Japanese or English names, but Hajime's attacks have French names.  So, why do Hajime's attacks have French names? Is this ever explained in the series? "
3597,Is Blue exorcist really based on a slush puppy?,"During a discussion with some friends, one of my friends said that blue exorcist is based on a slush puppy. I know some artists can get creative through a lot of things (elfen lied from a German poem) but I found this one pretty hard to believe.     Hence my question: Is blue exorcist really based on this slush puppy? Or on something else? "
3598,What do the black and red scenes mean?,"In Bakemonogatari, it often happens that suddenly, a red screen with ""Red Scene (Aka)"" or a black screen with ""Black Scene (Kuro)"" appears for a short time. (At least these are written in my sub.)  What do they mean? Is there any difference between ""Red Scene"" and ""Black Scene"" and why are they used? "
3599,What are Yasaburo and Professor eating in episode 9?,"What are these huge donut-like things the characters are eating in the office? From the distance it looks like cylindrical donuts, but a closer look shows it's some sort of puff roll cake. I understand that the size is greatly exaggerated, but what kind of pastry is this?     (click images for full resolution)  This is from the episode 9. I remember this site had an event recently where the users were proposed to watch and then discuss this episode or something like that. I wonder if this was discussed there. "
3600,"Where did the anime trope of ""clothing damage""/""clothes being torn"" originate?","I noticed that commonly now in anime that mostly female characters' clothes are being torn especially in fight scenes.  I googled and found this to be called Clothing Damage, and here are a list of examples from anime and manga from which I remember in High School DxD where the main protagonist Issei uses a technique called Dress Break to make his female enemies lose the will to fight. Also found in Dog Days and Freezing.  Even JRPG games such as Doki Doki Majo Shinpan! and its sequel, Doki Doki Majo Shinpan! 2 Duo has this.  Who started this trope? Is it somewhat related to the origin of the tentacles trope in anime? "
3601,Why didn't Goku choose Android 18 for the tournament instead of Piccolo?,"In Dragon Ball Super Manga Chapter 6, Goku chose Piccolo for Beerus' team. But why didn't he choose Android 18?

An immortal man searching for the source of his immortality to become a mortal again. If seen this concept before in quiet some anime/manga. Usually these people are also accompanied by some legendary swordsman. Is this based on some old myth/legend or on something else?

3604,What was that thing Edward and Alphonse created when they attempted human transmutation?,"I just completed the FMA:B anime (been meaning to do this) and I'm still confused as to what they actually created. Originally, they thought it was their mother but then Edward realized that it actually wasn't their mother that they transmuted.  We then find out that Alphonse was able to see Edward from that thing's perspective. Was that thing a failed homunculus they created? And why was Alphonse able to see everything from its perspective? "
3605,"Is the 2013 Rozen Maiden ""Zurückspulen"" anime part of the same original storyline?","The main focus of the 2013 Rozen Maiden anime is on a Jun who didn't wind the key, in an alternate universe from the one who wound the key. In several points in the show, these two universes cross paths and are linked via N-field.  My question is, is the universe in this TV series where Jun wound the key the same world/story/canon in which the original Rozen Maiden took place (or even ""Träumend"")? Or is this just part of a completely different storyline/canon in which there was a Jun that wound the key and the events in that universe were similar but unrelated to any of the previous series? "
3606,Who was Hajime talking to at the end of Gatchaman Crowds?,"At the end of the last episode:     She called her mother to tell her that no matter what happens, ""I'm just me"". Then after the credits, Hajime was tapping her chest and was having a conversation with someone with another voice. Who was she talking to? Was that supposed to be Katze?   "
3607,Why can't Oreki refuse Chitanda?,"Oreki is a usually lazy and energy-saving kind of guy. After meeting Chitanda, Oreki is unable to refuse her requests. Why can't he refuse it? Is this because he is in love with her or is it a form of hypnosis?   "
3608,What kind of animation/drawing style is used on K-On! Ura-on?,"K-On! Ura-on are bonus episodes from the anime K-On! and they used a different kind of animation or drawing style.     This is the first time I've ever encountered such style (very different compared to the series, though you can easily tell the resemblance to the original) and was wondering for this style's name, if it have. Also, did other anime used this prior or after K-On! Ura-on was released? And, what is this style's history and background? Or is this just created to be unique or random reasons by the K-On! production? "
3609,Why was Ed's arm strong but Al's body not?,"At the end of FMA: Brotherhood, when Ed got his arm back, it was muscular, and he used it to fight. When Al got his body back, however, it was weak and emaciated, as it had shown to be throughout the show on the other side of the gate? Was it ever explained why this might have happened? "
3610,Name of hair style with one strand sticking upwards,"I always forget what this special hairstyle is called, which is shared by some characters. I'll give some examples, I think it should be clear what I mean.     Edward Elric also has this wisp(?), but I can't find a good image of it. What is it called? What does it stand for? "

3612,How powerful are Koharu Utatane and Homura Mitokado now?,"Right now in Naruto universe, Koharu Utatane and Homura Mitokado are members of Konoha Council.    They joined the council after Hiruzen becomes The Third Hokage. According to naruto Wiki:     When Hiruzen became the Third Hokage, Homura and Koharu became his   councillors. With their years of experience and knowledge and their   unending effort to make Konohagakure a better place, they eventually   gained similar respect and social status as the Hokage himself.   But it is known that before that, they're member of Team Tobirama, that also included Sarutobi Hizuren and Tobirama himself. They fought together during the First Shinobi War. So in this time their power could be compared to Hiruzen?     So, How strong are they now? Have they ever fought again after team Tobirama was dissolved? "
3613,How can Naruto characters teleport/disappear?,"In the manga/anime, it appears as if teleportation is very rare. The few we know that gets a little bit explained are, for example, Minato (4th Hokage) and Obito (Tobi).  Despite of this, a lot of characters (mainly in the anime) ""disappear"" with a flashy exit when they wish. Orochimaru does this a couple of times, including others. Often with a phrase such as ""I don't have time to play around with you any more"" and then poof, gone!  Is there some explanation to this? Do they use a clone and then run off while the clone says goodbye to the opponent? If that is the case, when do they create the clone? "
3614,What are the different colors in anime production drawings for?,"In a lot of production drawings for anime (and I've also seen them in plots), particularly of characters as opposed to backgrounds, the detailed sketches/drawings have lines in different colors. Is there a purpose for this other than maybe to differentiate between lines? Are they used for color boundaries? Is there a production reason why the specific lines have to be different colors?          Edit:  Just to be a bit more clear, I was wondering specifically with the colors used in these particular style line drawings, where the lines seemed to be color coded. For example, given this animatic, the first sketch has color used in shading and hue, but the middle picture shows the color coded line art, where the tears are red and the eyes are blue.   "
3615,How are anime soundtracks made for a story?,"So say there is a manga. Now who comes up with the soundtrack and composes that according to the anime?  Many many soundtracks (instrumental) are masterpieces, and just as equally or even more amazingly they are composed with story to have even more effect. I want to know more about the whole process.  I know how they draw manga from a story, and animate (which is extremely tedious in itself).   But when it comes to soundtrack I am completely clueless. Obviously a studio or an artist is paid to create soundtracks but what's their process?  So I want to know:   How do they decide what it should sound like? How do they actually create it and is there a process? How do the people who create this get training for it?   In the soundtracks that I have heard, they don't seem limited by instruments. Melodies are perfect, or composed perfectly. They often have human voices mixed with them, like this, this or this. "
3616,Who is this guy that appear in Charlotte's OP?,"I wonder who is this guy that appear in Charlotte OP. He has short black hair, and it looks like he currently in the middle of a pond, full of blood?  I have never seen this guy on the Charlotte series, or am I missing somethings ?   "
3617,Does a Jinchuuriki gain the nature of his/her tailed beast?,"I find this question interesting here: Chakra nature of Tailed Beasts.  And I saw the comment: Does a Jinchuuriki gain the nature of his/her tailed beast? And if so, does the tailed beast gain the nature of its Jinchuuriki?  So to confirm this, I ask a different question. "

It came across my mind what is the relationship of the Yin-yang to the 5 Chakra nature elements? And how come you can classify a Chakra nature as Yin-Yang? Does it has something to do with the Chinese Zodiac or principles of Taoism? 
3620,"Does Makoto Shinkai concentrates on a ""distant love"" theme for his works?","Some of Makoto Shinkai's known masterpieces are Voices of a Distant Star, The Place Promised in Our Early Days, 5 Centimeters per Second, and his latest creation, Garden of Words. I noticed that the plots mostly involves a distant love because of several reasons like literal distance/space, dreams, situations, and other aspects of life. I was just wondering if Makoto Shinkai prefer this kind of theme on his creation and concentrates on a ""distant love"" theme. Was there any official statements from him that explains the similarity of themes on his works? Or he just relates well to that theme because of personal experience? "
3621,Why did Fatima not wear any clothes?,"In Chain Chronicle, Fatima, one of the Three Sages, didn't wear any clothes as shown below. I tried to reread the part one, chapter three, story two about the Three Sages but they never really tell the reason.      Dilma      [ Fatima has a reason for dressing as she does, so don't bother her about it ]   Was it ever explained anywhere? Maybe from side story or her character story? She's available on Japanese version   "
3622,Who are these characters in the end of the last episode's still?,"The two similar looking guys on the left are most probably Ginkaku and Kinkaku Ebisugawa brothers, and the tiger must be Yaichiro. But who are the three female characters? They don't look like any of the other characters in this show. Is this perhaps a reference to another P.A. Works show or its crew?

There are many plotholes to cover.   Marcy Kimensho, Kouchu's childhood rival, turns into an enemy, and joins Hunter Grai's force to use the Crystal Balls, summon Devil J, and destroy the world. What would happen next? Elliott Mitoa, Kouchu's gay friend, have been abandoned by his parents when he was 12. Will he meet them again?

3625,"In Kyoukai no Kanata, are youmu the same as youkai?","In Kyoukai no Kanata, are youmu the same as youkai? Since half youmu half humans are also called hanyou, I'm assuming they are.   However, if they are, then why are they called youmu instead of youkai? "
3626,"What does ""life force"" mean?","The term life force is used a number of times during the series. Does life force simply mean chakra? If so, then do non-ninjas (such as Teuchi, the owner of Ichiraku Ramen) not have life force? Is there a canonical definition for this term? "
3627,Is Zodom a Virus?,"In Ar Tonelico 2 when Zodom appears in Lekra after EXEC_HIBERNATION was stopped Mir comments how it's cuter than other ones and that she wouldn't have made one so immature.  There are 2 things i can think of that Mir has created in the past, Song Magic and Viruses. so does that mean Zodom is a Virus and the song she sings is her version of EXEC_PAJA? if not then what did Mir create in the past which is like Zodom (only more mature)?

3628,"Can a reanimated person, be revived?","If someone is brought back to life with the endo tensi, could they also be brought back with justu's like Outer Path: Samsara of Heavenly Life Technique or what Chiyo used or again with the endo tensi? I would like to point out the diffrence between my question and Can reanimated Chiyo use One&#39;s Own Life Reincarnation technique?. The latter focuses on the paradox of using a life taking justu on an immortal person, while my asks about bring back someone twice, so that there are two of them at the same time.  Also, can you use an endo tensi as a sacrifice for an endo tensi? This way you could have an army with only one sacrifice. "
3629,Why is Princess Reiners called a monster?,"We got introduced to Princess Reiners in season 2, episode 1, and we were given flashes in the ending theme that she had a dark personality. This was later confirmed in episodes 9 and 10 when her brother, Prince Zanac, calls her a monster to her face. When she turned around, she had the anime crazy face, but didn't actually change form into a literal monster of any kind.  Over on the MAL forum for episode 12, they simply refer to her as a yandere. On the Wikia, they say she's a psychopath.  I always considered the anime crazy face to be a metaphor for viewers, not a literal change for other characters in-story. Aside from her dark personality / face twisting, and the fact that she plans out big, complicated, moves, I don't understand what the big deal is. Why would she be called a monster? How would anyone else in Yggdrasil would know that she is a ""monster""? Or is she a monster in a literal sense? "
3630,"What was the inspiration for ""Many copies, no original""?","In GITS SAC 2nd GiG, what was the original inspiration for the concept of ""many copies, no original""?  Does the concept have a name in real life? Or was it just a concept the writers created just for the show? "
3631,Can Natsu Dragneel use Dragonforce and Lightning flame Dragon mode at the same time?,"I've just read all the way to the most recent manga chapter which is chapter 466 of fairy tail and Natsu has just used, and seemingly lost, the Dragon King Mode. It seems that all hope is lost for the fairy tail mages since natsu has now depleted the Dragon King mode and the guild has lost their trump card to defeat zeref.  Here is my question. Can Natsu theoretically combine the Dragon Force with his lightning flame dragon mode in sort of a stacking kind of way? From what I understand about Dragon Force it is the most powerful transformation that a dragon slayer can take and puts their overall power on par with an actual dragon. It increases their strength, speed, power, senses and their overall magic power to unimaginable heights. Now from what I know about Lightning Flame Dragon Mode it increases the strength of natsu's attacks as well as grants him the ability to use Laxus' lightning to increase the power of his magic related attacks.  Here's the thing, it seems to me that Dragonforce is a full on transformation that can be utilized by the dragon slayers but it seems as though Lightning Flame Dragon Mode is more a power up that Natsu can use to finish a fight quickly rather than being a full on transformation. So it seems that it would only be logical that Natsu would be able to enter Dragonforce and then power up utilizing LFDM to end a fight with zeref quickly. If he could utilize both would this put him on par with the Dragon King Mode and would it be enough to defeat zeref who was almost critically wounded by the Dragon King mode? "
3632,Why doesn't Naruto possess any of his clan's specific jutsu?,"Neji, Hinata, Shino, Kiba, Sasuke, Choji, Shikamaru and Ino all have their clans' Kekkai Genkai, e.g. Shikamaru possesses shadow jutsu, Ino has mind controlling jutsu.  The Uzumaki clan is said to have sealing techniques. Then why doesn't Naruto possess any of the techniques? At least, he should have some of his father's abilities (excluding Rasengan, as Jiraiya and Kakashi were able to do it), but from the beginning, it is shown that he didn't possess any clan-specific technique. Why so? "
3633,"Osamu Dazai's book titled ""Josei Gakkou (Highschool Girl)"" in ""Tsuki ga Kirei""","In some episodes of Tsuki ga Kirei, I noticed that the main MC is borrowing some books called ""Josei Gakkou(Highschool Girl) by Osamu Dazai"".

3634,Why did Deidara want to kill Orochimaru?,"In the anime it was shown that Deidara was so fixated on killing Orochimaru by himself, he also recklessly attacked Sasuke for killing(!) Orochimaru...     It was shown that Deidara joined Akatsuki only after Orochimaru left,   So what could be the reason for his desire to kill Orochimaru by himself?   Is it said anywhere in story?  "
3635,"In the Bleach manga, does Byakuya really die in Bleach 502?","In the Bleach manga-volume 57, chapter 502, page 56-you see      Byakuya on a wall with blood splattered everywhere, and a man with white hair (sorry for me not knowing his name; I have yet to actually read the manga, besides the first three volumes) says, ""It seems Byakuya Kuchiki is dead.""   My question is: is Byakuya really dead, here, or does he come back and whatnot? This scene looks as though he is, but we've seen desperate situations-like this-in the past chapters (or episodes) of Bleach where the character isn't truly dead; they come back later making a dramatic entrance, looking even more badass than before. See what I mean?  This CAN'T be the end for Byakuya Kuchiki. It just can't! "
3636,Why did Rem kill L?,"I know that it was Light's plan to make Misa look suspicious again so that Rem would kill L. But why did she think that Misa was going to be executed?  Was it because her lifespan was shortened again?  I thought that only a Death Note can shorten the lifespan of a person, and even though she did the Shinigami eye deal again, was her lifespan too shortened?   Or can your lifespan get shortened by other people, because of their actions? "
3637,Did Kale ever turn into super saiyan 2?,"We have no doubts that universe 6 saiyans Caulifla, Kyabe and Kefura turned super saiyan 2.        But how about Kale?

According to the english wikia this is her when she's in SSJ2    Now the Dragon Ball Wikia arent official sources. Therefore my question is, did Kale ever turned into super saiyan 2 in Dragon Ball Super? "

3640,Does Akatsuki Nagisa knows that Akatsuki Kojou is the Fouth Progenitor?,"Title says it all. Does Akatsuki Kojou's imouto (little sister) knows that his oniichan (elder brother) is the Fourth Progenitor? If yes, since when she knows that? In the 24 episodes of the anime, it doesn't seems like Nagisa knows. What about the light novel? "
3641,"What is the relevancy between the common theme of Knight’s & Magic, In Another World With My Smartphone, and KonoSuba?","These three anime:   Knight's &amp; Magic In Another World With My Smartphone KonoSuba: God's Blessing on this Wonderful World.   and perhaps others anime as well begin with the common theme of a guy dying and get born on another world. That made me wonder what made this theme be present in so many anime.  I am specially focused on the death of the characters since that is, in my opinion, a different element of other isekai anime such as Sword art online. In Sword art Online the characters are truly imprisoned in a different world. In this three anime the characters die and continue their lives (are ressurected into) in a different world.  Is this kind of story present in some Japanese book? Is it just because this kind of narrative was well received? Are they anyhow related?   If possible it would be great if someone could find the first anime where this narrative was present. "
3642,How are the Monogatari manga and light novels related?,"Back on the 10th of January 2018 it was announced on Twitter that Bakemonogatari would be getting a manga.     【解禁】      『化物語』　漫　画　化　決　定      3月14日(水)発売「週刊少年マガジン」2018年15号ヨリ   Where the first Japanese volume was released on the 15th of June 2018, and has garnered 7 volumes in Japanese.

3645,Why did Madara have Rinnegan before activating it and nobody noticed?,"While I was watching Episode 322 of Naruto Shippuden, I found what I guess is a mistake:  First look at the picture:    Since Madara came, he was using only Sharingan, and this can be seen until 07:43 in the picture, while he was dodging Gaara's sand attacks. However, when Naruto was above him with an Odama Rasengan, Madara suddenly could be seen with the Rinnegan on his eyes (07:45), and nobody noticed it like if it was a mistake. It should have been normal Sharingan.  Then, at 08:17, Madara was using the Mangekyou Sharingan, since he activated it after Naruto's attack to invoke the Susanoo.  And after that, at around 10:04, Madara was targeted by a Rasenshuriken, hence he had to activate the Rinnegan, and that was at 10:06. It was the first time that he did it since he came to life with Edo Tensei, and that could be confirmed from everybody's reaction when they saw his Rinnegan at around 10:56 (""Why does he have the Rinnegan?"").  Was it a mistake that they drew Madara with the Rinnegan at 07:45? "
3646,Why does the use of Haki turn part of your body black?,"Before the time skip, characters like Garp and the Priest of Sky Island, used Haki to deal damage to Luffy via a blunt attack, which would have been impossible otherwise. Also, Haki was used by both sides during the Summit War. None of these people turned black.   But after the time skip, when Luffy used Haki against Hordy, he partially turned black. And during his fight with Z, they both turned partially black. Is this a special type of Haki? Is there any reason why they change colors and if so why black? "
3647,Do seniority relations among the fleet girls have any basis in properties of the actual ships?,"I notice, for example, that the Akagi and the Kaga both began construction in 1920, and they're portrayed as being more senior than the Fubuki, the Mutsuki, and the Yuudachi, all of which only began construction later on.   Is this a reasonably consistent pattern among the other fleet girls? Or is it more or less arbitrary which girls are portrayed as being senior to others? (Or is it not arbitrary, but based on something else entirely, like ship class?) "
3648,Naruto Discussion about Hashirama's sage mode,"in this answer to ""Is there a slug based Sage Mode?"" it says     He learnt Sage Mode in Shikkotsu Woods/Forest, a legendary place that is equally famous as Mount Myōboku (toad) and Ryūchi Cave (snake).   I was wondering if someone could direct me to the manga panels/anime episodes where it was mentioned that Hashirama trained at Shikkotsu Forest? "
3649,Nami look-alike in episode 144,"In episode 144, around 15:45 of One Piece, while salvaging the ship of a navigator that fell from the sky, Sanji came across a picture. The woman in the picture looked almost exactly like Nami.    It can't be a coincidence because Nami is a prodigy when it comes to navigation, and picture of her look-alike just happen to be at a navigator's ship.  Was that just a coincidence? Is there any theory related to that picture? "
3650,How can reanimated bodies get their eyes back?,"Okay, this question comes up in my mind most of the time. Considering the basic law on life and death: when a body part is taken from a dead body, it can never get that back. But in Naruto, many reanimated ninjas had lost their eye of some or the other reason (Sharingan, Rinnegan and Byakugan mainly).  As far as I know, Sasuke has taken Itachi's eyes to awaken his powers. So then how could Itachi get his Sharingan back when Kabuto reanimated him? Is there any kind of logic behind this which I've missed out? Or is that some law in the shinobi world? Obito had taken over Nagato's Rinnegan, yet Nagato had the Rinnegan when he was reanimated. Considering the power of Rinnegan which creates stuff, there hasn't been any scene where Sharingan and other eyes of Rinnegan were created and transplanted into Itachi and Nagato. "
3651,Did Future Zen-Oh destroy only Future Universe 7 or all 12 Future universes?,"If he destroyed only Future Universe 7 then other 11 Universes do not have a ruler God now because he went to the past, isn't that very bad?  If he destroyed all 12 Universes then why did he do that if only Universe 7 was polluted by Zamasu? "
3652,What class of Devil Fruit does the Gomu Gomu no Mi come under?,"Considering the three types of Devil Fruits that has been explained are 1. Paramecia Type - where the user can get super human abilities and change their body parts into weapons, etc. 2. Zoan type - where the use can turn into a particular animal and inherit its abilities 3. Logia Type - where the user's body inherits a particular element and the body becomes like air which cannot be touched or damaged by non Haki users.  So what exactly is the type of Gomu Gomu no Mi? It cannot be Zoan or Logia. It's very close to a Paramecia but still doesn't have a logical explanation to be of Paramecia type! So is it some special type of Devil Fruit? "
3653,Is Shido a spirit?,"I know Shido has the powers of a spirit, but he wasn't born with them but gained them in some roundabout way.  Does he really qualify as a spirit? Does it have something to do with how Kurumi really wants to devour him? "
3654,Why would VAs that have many memorable lead roles take lesser roles?,"This centers around Noto Mamiko, but you can answer the question from a general/industry stand point if you want.  Specifically since 2013, I'm noticing Noto Mamiko is pretty much a bit-character voice actress. She's not even ""the MC's best friend"" or anything.   I can think of 1 main character role in 2013 - Satellizer el Bridget in Freezing Vibration. That's it. Even last year, her biggest role was probably Nishiki in Donten ni Warau, not even a main character!  In severe cases she is in the show for literally 1-2 episodes.  Why would this GREAT VA, who has played some very memorable main character roles, now be playing barely supporting characters?  Did she get married? Start TV acting? Any reasonable suggestion for this atrocity?  Is it me or is Hayami Saori stealing her roles? "
3655,Where did Kagami Taiga live when he lived in the US?,"We see a flashback to when Kagami lived in the US in episode 1 of season 2 (26Q).     Judging from all the palm trees, I'd hazard a guess that he was probably in California. California also seems like the most likely option on a demographic basis (i.e. where are Japanese temporary immigrants most likely to end up?).  Is it ever explicitly stated where he lived? And if it is California, is it ever stated whether he's in SoCal or NorCal (or somewhere else)? "
3656,Why doesn't Sasuke use his Sharingan to learn Naruto's Rasengan?,"In the hospital rooftop fight between Sasuke and Naruto, why didn't Sasuke use his Sharingan to learn Naruto's Rasengan? Is it because the Rasengan doesn't use any hand signs? (But Sasuke learns Rock Lee's moves with the Sharingan even if it doesn't rely on hand signs). "
3657,How did the villagers know about Naruto being the Kyuubi's jinchuriki?,"I know that the villagers of Konoha were afraid of the Kyuubi because of its rampage on the village, and that the Fourth Hokage saved the village by sealing it inside Naruto. Based on this answer, the Third Hokage hid his identity to protect him.   Did the Third Hokage hide only Naruto's relation with the Fourth, or also him being the Kyuubi jinchuriki? If so, did the villagers find out because Naruto went out of control with the Kyuubi's chakra?   Edit: To make clear what I am exactly curious about.  Why didn't they also hide Naruto's identity as a jinchuriki so the villagers will not hate him? "
3658,Why doesn't Kabuto Yakushi have the curse mark?,I have not seen the curse mark on Kabuto. (I have watched till episode 120). Why didn't Orochimaru give the curse mark to Kabuto? Is it because Kabuto is already powerful?  
3659,How is Levi so fast when attacking the Beast Titan's nape in season 3 part 2?,"In episode 17 of Attack on Titan season 3 part 2, when Levi takes out the Beast Titan's arm, eyes, and legs, Levi is in the air above the downed titan. When Levi goes for the kill, Zeke says that he doesn't have enough time to harden his nape. (YouTube video)  Levi was in the air, reeling in towards the Beast Titan. The ODM wire was still taut but the ODM gear was set to reel speed. It's demonstrated time and time again that when people using the ODM would listen to the order from the captains/whoever was in charge, they all move at the same speed and don't seem to rehook. They just stay there.  We saw Annie/the Female Titan harden quick enough to be protected from Oluo which was really fast.  But back to Levi, there wasn't any tall freestanding objects insight, so how did he move so fast? Please don't say it was gravity. He wasn't falling, he was reeling. "
3660,Fairy Tail's Aquarius can still materialize?,"In the Alvarez empire arc, she is shown to have materialized in spirit form once again to help out Lucy.  But we all know the key that belonged to Lucy is broken.   What does this mean? are there 2 keys?  I'm happy she's back though "
3661,Why did Akihiko Kayaba make death permanent in Sword Art Online?,"In Sword Art Online, why did Akihiko Kayaba make the game so as to make death permanent? Don't get me wrong, I know that in episode 1 he claims that he would like to ""control this world's fate"".  However, in episode 17, when he says that he ""wanted to make a world free of laws and restrictions"", then why make it so that people must die in real life as well?  Wouldn't that make a real death contrary to his goals?  And if he ""forgot"" somewhere in the middle of the game (as he claims in episode 14), what is the point in continuing further?  Has he no regard for human life? "
3662,Confusing power level multiplier,"Power levels are so confusing throughout the DBZ series.   For example:  Kaioken = x2 base Kaioken x3 = x3 base Kaioken x4 = x4 base  and so on...  SSJ = x50 base SSJ Grade 2 = ? SSJ Grade 3 = ? SSJ2 = x100 base SSJ3 = x400 base SSJ4 = ? SSJG = ? SSJGSSJ = ? LSSJ = ?  Fusion = ? Fusion Dance = ? Potara Fusion = ?  Frieza form 1 = 1x base Frieza form 2 = ? Frieza form 3 = ? Frieza form final (full power) = ? Future Frieza = ? (Same with final form?) Golden Frieza = ?  Super Buu's Absorption = ? (times the victim's power level)  The unknown factor (""?"") makes me confuse about their power levels. Any ideas? Thanks. "
3663,Is it rare for two different anime to share the same OP/ED song?,"I have watched the anime Ano Hi Mita Hana no Namae wo Bokutachi wa Mada Shiranai. It has the ED song     ""secret base ~Kimi ga Kureta Mono~ (10 years after ver.) (secret base   〜君がくれたもの〜（10 years after Ver.）)"" by Meiko Honma (Ai Kayano), Naruko   Anjou (Haruka Tomatsu), Chiriko Tsurumi (Saori Hayami)   A few years later after I watched AnoHana, I watched an old anime, Kyou no 5 no 2. I heard one of its ED songs, and it's really similar to AnoHana's ED song. The title of Kyou no 5 no 2's ED song was like:     ""secret base ~Kimi ga Kureta Mono~ 「secret base ～君がくれたもの～」"" by Friends:   Yuu Kobayashi, Asami Shimoda, MAKO, Satomi Akesaka, Youko Honda, Kana   Asumi   So my question: Is it possible/rare for a song that is used in the OP/ED of an anime to be used also in the OP/ED of a different anime?  Has this ever happened to other anime? Or is it just a coincidence? "
3664,Is Dracule Mihawk really the strongest swordsman?,"When Shanks entered the Battle of Marineford, it was to end it. All he used was a single sword to stop Akainu (considered as the strongest in the marines now) from killing Coby.    Mihawk left the battlefield saying that he had only agreed to fight Whitebeard. So is this just a normal reason for him to leave or was he scared that he would have lost to Shanks? Because, in the war Mihawk fought with other pirates except for Whitebeard so it seems a bit contradictory to what he said while leaving.    Then there was a scene where he actually tracks down Shanks just to inform him about Luffy's first bounty. Is there any particular reason behind this?    Also, does Mihawk has some relation with Shanks or is he scared of him? "
3665,Did technology evolve in the 20 years humanity left Earth to Godzilla?,"Humanity left Earth to escape Godzilla.  In their relativity, they only spent 20 years away from the planet, while the planet didn't see them for ~20,000 years.  When they return to fight Godzilla (not a spoiler), you see large landing ships, hoverbikes, powered suits, and many other pieces of high technology.  Their legged tanks are even strong enough for Godzilla to feel threatened by.  Did the technology of the people who left advance that far in the 20 years they were gone?  Or did the other 2 alien species impart their technology to the survivors? "
3666,"Why does Kasumigaoka call Tomoya ""Mr. Ethical""?","In Saekano: How to Raise a Boring Girlfriend, Kasumigaoka always calls Tomoya ""Mr. Ethical"" (倫理{りんり}君{くん}).  Where did this come from? Is it explained at some point in the original source material?  Feel free to spoil it for me. "
3667,What type of government structure exists in Shingeki no Kyojin?,"So I guess that the remaining human survivors formed a nation, but what form of government exists in this nation? Who is the leader? "
3668,Why does Edward prefer to use his automail over Alchemy?,"So I've been watching Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, and I didn't understand why Edward didn't use Alchemy every time he encountered enemies? Like the fight with Number 48 in Research Lab 5, and the first fight with Scar, and etc. He just uses his right automail arm like a short sword, and we all know its not very effective to fight long ranged enemies. Alchemy definitely seems stronger, but why doesn't he use it?  "
3669,How is Levi Ackerman so unrealistic with the ODM gear?,"Time and time again we see Levi go into these god mode moments.  Example One:[![enter image description here][1]][1]  Example Two:[![enter image description here][2]][2]  But is never, to my knowledge, ever explained in the anime or in the manga on Attack on Titan. I know that Attack on Titan isn't realistic, but the ODM gear has 2 functions that deal with the hooks, shoot them out and reel them back. If this is true, then this shouldn't be possible. At least without some serious button/lever mashing. how is he able to do this? To give Levi some credit, he does do realistic things with the ODM gear, like blinding the Beast Titans eyes or speed blitzing the Female Titan when she's against the tree in season 2. these things are believable with someone as good as he is. Keep in mind he is spinning really fast while doing this, so fast, in fact, that we can see a blue circle around him, those are his blades. He is spinning this fast while operating a device that takes the majority of 3 years of training to learn. Somehow he is still able to stay in control doing this and knowing when to stop. Could someone please explain to me how this is possible? "
3670,Who is being parodied by Onizuka?,"In episode 8 of Great Teacher Onizuka, who is this ""Kenshiro"" that Onizuka is parodying?   "
3671,Where did Onizuka get his super human strength from?,"As I read the manga, I can't help but wondering where our favorite teacher Onizuka get his inhuman strength from? He's survived: falling from the school top floor, being shot at point blank, being smacked in the head, and many more. Is it because of his glory days as a motorbike gangster? Or is it because of his fighting spirit and will alone? Without his strength, the story would have ended much differently. "
3672,"Why does Happy from ""Fairy Tail"" have wings?","I was watching Fairy Tail the other day and I was like, hey why does Happy have wings? He's a cat. jeez. also, like, how can he fly Natsu around? He's puny. "
3673,What are these three references from episode 9?,"In episode 9, there are these three references I didn't get:     The first one is around minute 5, when Tomoko goes to see Yuu-chan at her uncle's café. She sees the names of two cakes (""Tarte Chiboust au Caramel"" and ""Bijou des Rois""), and then says this:   The second is around minute 15, when Tomoko is cleaning her stuff up. She wonders why her brother is trying to be better than her at everything, then says the following:    She then says ""I'm gonna make him cry for this."" The third one is around minute 17, when Tomoko is cleaning her stuff up and finds the cicada shells. She remembers why they were there, says ""A memory best left forgotten"", and then:     What do these three different situations refer to?  "
3674,Do both Kamui Sharingans share one dimension?,"Since Kakashi has the left eye of Obito, and Obito has his right eye intact, after awakening the Mangekyō Sharingan, they both gain the ability of Kamui in their eyes.  Using Kamui, both are able to teleport things to the other dimension, though Obito does it far more easily than Kakashi, initially. My question is, since they are the same pair of eyes, which once belonged to a single person, do they share the same dimension?   Say, Obito captures someone and keeps them in the other dimension, can Kakashi bring them back, as they may share the same other dimension? "
3675,What exactly was Roswaal's role within Re:Zero?,"I have just finished the anime, and althugh given that the show did a really good job at tying up loose ends with the plot, I still do not get Roswaal L Mathers' purpose within the plot. According to my memory, he was/did the following:      - Head of the mansion and the Mathers Domain  - Helped with the fight between Subaru et al. and the majuu packs  - Sponsored Emilia for the election   ...But then he wasn't seen within the show afterwards (for the latter section, at least).   Did his character play a bigger role that I overlooked? (Or potentially in a later release of the manga that has not been anime-tized?) "
3676,How much time does the original Fullmetal Alchemist anime cover?,"I was always confused with something in the original (2003) Fullmetal Alchemist anime.  When Elric brothers have helped the Hughes' when Alicia was born, that happened around the same time when Edward have become a State Alchemist. If I know well, he was 12 in that time. It was in episode 6.  Most of the following episodes (Barry incident, the Chimaera, etc.) seems to cover a relatively short time. However, later it was mentioned that Ed is 14-15 years old. And also, I'm absolutely sure that it was true at the time when Hughes was murdered.  Which is the exact timeline order of the event in the episodes? First episode is obviously an introducing one, and second is the beginning of everything, and then?   Also, how is it possible that Edward looks totally the same in Episode 6 (where he was 12) and in Episode 50, for example (where he was 15)? "
3677,When did Itachi plant his crow inside Naruto?,"We all know that Itachi had the left eye of Shisui which had the Kotoamatsukami. This was planted as the eye of one the crows of Itachi and the crow was planted inside Naruto, to counter Sasuke's Mangekyō, if ever, he turned against the village.  My question is, when did Itachi plant his crow inside Naruto and how did he do that?! Did he inject it inside Naruto, or planted it using Genjutsu, or something like that? "
3678,Why did Madhouse list Korean staffs in English on their credit?,"The closing credits of the anime series No Guns Life include credits to staff members of the Korean studio DR movie.    (screen shot from Funimation, No Guns Life episode 1, @22:10)  On other series I have noticed that, when non-Japanese staffers are given credit, it has been in the language of those people.  So I would have expected the credits for them here to be shown with the Korean alphabet, not the Latin one.  Is there a reason Madhouse (the primary studio) chose not to credit them in Korean?  Incidentally, when I was researching this, I learned that Madhouse is a partial owner of DR movie. "
3679,How did paradox work in Kurugaya's route?,"In Little Buster Anime Season 2 (Refrain) and Kurugaya route, there is a certain paradox which is stuck in 20th all the time. I played Little Buster but I forgot most of it. In anime, It seems like that paradox is created by Rin. Is there any difference between Anime and Visual Novel? What is the cause of paradox?  As far as I remembered, When Little Buster found out Riki interested to Kurugaya, Rin didn't show her jealous in Visual Novel as it is described in anime season 2. "
3680,Trying to find this anime about a girl who was bullied (more specifics in desc!),"It was an anime about a girl who was pretending to be an anime character of some sort, and she made a friend with a boy in her class who ALSO use to be bullied for pretending to be a manga character back in elementary school, but changed to avoid bullying in their new school.. From what I remember, towards the end of the film she had build a tower out of desks to jump off the school roof for suicide, but the male mc/her friend saves her? Does anyone possible know/remember this one..? It was pretty dark in context. "
3681,"""I want to forget the little nuts""","In the Ending animation sequence of Jintai, the song Yume no Naka no Watashi no Yume (My Dream Within a Dream) plays with the following lyrics in romaji:     Wasuretai tte kimochi   Sore mo uso ja nai kokoro   On Anime Lyrics it is translated so:      The feeling of wanting to forget   It, too, is an emotion that is not a lie   But in the subs I have, it is translated like this:     What is it?   There you sit on my lap, little squirrel   The chestnut is like your flag, you child of the forest, seeking courage      When the sounds of March are all around, even the humans will know      Day in, day out, I sow the seeds for the future   Eventually they bloom to flowers, and all feast on what it brought to fruit   My dream fulfills that of the others at the same time   Isn't it nice to make your wishes then?        I want to forget the little nuts   That's what I really feel like      What's wrong today?   You wave your chestnut like a flag, little squirrel   Soon you will run to the forest again, your refuge   What's wrong today?   Here you sit on my lap   Why don't you rest?   The animation sequence itself contains many objects that come directly from the story. Most of them I recognized, but where do these little nuts come from in the subtitle translation? Was it a mistranslation or some subtle reference to the events of the story? I wonder if the differences are because of some double-meaning words or some hidden context that one of the translators (or both) didn't get. "
3682,Why is (Adult) Gon Freece's Hair so Long? Why is Illumi's hair long?,"So I have seen, and understood how Gon would have to train for such a long time frame to have his hair be that long. But, Illumi also has long flowing hair. Does this mean that Illumi has done something similar? Or maybe has Illumi just had a ton of bloodlust? and his hair went straight up?   "
3683,What exactly is the problem with Yukinoshita Yukino being dependent on Hikigaya Hachiman?,"During the last several episodes of Oregairu Season 2 (Volume 10 in LN I think), Yukinoshita's sister was warning Hikigaya about this ""sinister"" relationship building up between him and Yukinoshita, and she said that their relationship is in no way genuine and that Yukinoshita is just depending on Hikigaya.   My confusion is: What is this dependency problem exactly? Clearly Yukinoshita has developed feelings for Hikigaya in the last few episodes, so isn't relying on each other a symbolism of trust? What is the exact thing that Yukinoshita Haruno seem so worried about? "
3684,What are the blue downward lines in used to symbolize depression or sadness called?,"Does anybody have any idea what these are called?    I've only seen them referred to as blue lines so far.  I've seen them represent depression, sadness or disgust before but could someone clarify this also? "
3685,What genre of music is this? Looking for something more specific than 'anime',"What genre of music is this?  Looking for something more specific than 'anime'. It's not really just this kind of orchestral, but any soul-wrenching or 'powerful' music like this that I am asking about and definitely not limited to anime scores either.  Is there even a definition for it?  [website][website]"
3686,Are there any significant differences between reading mangas as compared to watching the animation?,"The title says it all.  Personally, I am not fond of reading and when it comes to this, I'd prefer to watch the anime rather than read its manga. However, there are some who prefer reading the manga.  Why is that so? Are there any differences or is it just that one is better than the other at times? "
3687,What would happen if the NerveGear was yanked from someone's head?,"In the anime it is said that if you try to remove the helmet it would destroy the brain - so what if you pull it off quick enough that it doesn't have a chance to?  Certainly, it's not impossible; and on that note, why did they not just use an EMP on the device to begin with, frying the circuits so there is no way for the battery to power the microwave transmitter?  Is there some law of physics I am missing here? "
3688,Psycho-Pass Sinners of the System and Season 3,It has been quite a while since I watched psycho-pass and I haven't touched Sinner of System movies. I was wondering if I should watch them to understand Season 3. Aren't they standalone? Also Is this correct chronological order?   Psycho-Pass: Sinners of the System Case 2 Psycho-Pass 1 Psycho-Pass 2 Psycho-Pass: The Movie Psycho-Pass: Sinners of the System Case 3 Psycho-Pass: Sinners of the System Case 1 Psycho-Pass 3

3691,What manga chapters does the Akagi anime adapt?,"I just finished the Akagi anime. It seems safe to conclude that Akagi probably survives the match with Wachizu, but since there are two more rounds that aren't covered by the last episode of the anime, I'm wondering how they go.  As thus: which chapter of the manga does the Akagi anime end on? Is it safe to assume that up to that chapter, everything covered in the manga will have been more or less covered in the anime (given that in some anime adaptations, like FMA, this isn't true)? "
3692,How do I watch canon Kenshin content?,"I have watched the anime in full. I understand that canon stops at ep 62. What are the other animated contents that cover the canon story to the fullest?  Referring Wikipedia, there were two OVAs. Rurouni Kenshin: Trust &amp; Betrayal seems canon without controversy. Rurouni Kenshin: Reflection was declared non-canon by the author, but I guess it was sourced from canon.  So my best guess is, I must watch Trust &amp; Betrayal and then Reflection to get the canon story. Is my guess correct or did I miss something?    What parts of the manga have been not-animated? Are there upcoming projects that cover the canon story? "
3693,Why do most Naruto villains end up not just being bad guys to be hated?,"Is there a reason why almost all Naruto villains end up having very good excuses for becoming villains and start being seen as fighting for a different cause as opposed to just being the bad guys who need to be killed? What I mean by this question is that, why do Naruto ""villains"" never play the role of the standardized ""bad guy"", but instead introduce a new and different struggle from their point of view? Instead of having one clear person to hate and criticize their actions, you end up with two very different view points, never a good vs evil kind of situation, but more of a clash of opinions. "
3694,Differences between the Overlord light novel and manga,"Recently, I got very fond of Overlord. As the anime stopped at season 1 and there's no news of season 2 yet, I thought I will give a try for the manga continuation for the first time. I thought of buying the manga at Amazon as it's the only website I could find selling Overlord series.  But the problem is it's written as Overlord novel.  What's the difference between the Overlord novel and manga? Are they the same?  If they are not, is the novel illustrated like the manga with visual presentation?  Does the English translation for the manga have some translation errors?  I tried some searching myself for the information, but I didn't get any clear picture!  If anyone has a light novel or manga, would it be possible to share some contents in it by taking a picture and posting it? Thanks. "
3695,Why didn't the writer reveal the contents of the disk that fell on the ground?,"As mentioned in this question, I am wondering why the writer or the creator of the anime Chobits didn't reveal a crucial thing such as the contents of the disk in question.  According to this answer, the manga revealed the contents of the disk in the late chapters. Why did they not do so in the anime?  As I am not very familiar with finding writer's or creator's comments on their works, I am having a hard time understanding this.  Any reference linked to the subject matter or facts referring to the creation of this anime is very much appreciated. "

3697,Is Aogiri looking for Kaneki now that he's with the CCG?,"Haise Sasaki is Kaneki, and Kaneki's been gone for almost four years, yet Aogiri doesn't seem the least bit concerned about it, despite him being one of their captains. Do they think Kaneki's dead? I mean, Kaneki has disappeared without a trace and they do nothing to try and find him. What's more, if they thought the CCG had him, why not try to get him back? It's not like he's just an expendable henchman, he a freaking captain and he's a SS ranked ghoul! So even if they were just using him, that's plenty reason enough to go rescue him. Not to mention that he knows too much to just let the CCG have him. Am I just overthinking this, because it makes no sense. "
3698,Why did Itachi poke Sasuke's forehead?,"From the beginning of the series, even during his last moments, Itachi poked Sasuke's forehead as a way of showing affection and apologizing.  But is that the only reason? Did he perhaps try to transfer some knowledge or memories to Sasuke? Or is it simply unknown?  "
3699,Why didn't Kamesenin just chose to destroy the saiyan space ship when Vegeta and Nappa was on their way to earth?,"During Vegeta Saga  As I know, Bulma has asked Shenlong to kill the saiyans before they reached Earth. But, Shenlong said that the he couldn't do that because the Saiyans are stronger than him.  I am just wondering.. Since saiyans couldn't live in outer space. Why wouldn't they wish for destroying their space ships instead of resurrecting Goku? What's your opinion about this? "
3700,"Is it possible for Lucy to meet Aquarius again, or did she die/get sacrificed?","Is it possible for Lucy to meet Aquarius again, or did she die/get sacrificed?  So is there only one key for each of the 13 gates? Or are there multiple keys? "
3701,Did Kirito lie about being the *best* beta tester?,"I watched SAO on Crunchyroll, where the subtitles for episode 2 have Kirito saying:      I made it higher than anyone else during the beta test.  The reason I knew the bosses skills is because I fought monsters with katana skills on floors far above us.   At the time, I just accepted this as ""Kirito is just that good,"" which was born out by his skills and abilities later on in the series.  After all, someone had to be the best.  However, this question claims he lied during that speech, and I've since checked the dubbed version, where he says     During the beta, I made it to floors that were higher than any of the other testers.  That's a fact.  I knew about the boss 'cause I fought tons of monsters with way more sword skills on higher floors.   The implication of word choice and tone in the dub does sound like the kind of exaggerated bragging that gamers do when they're claiming preposterous things, but the subs don't convey that to me at all.  Is there any information showing whether he was actually lying?  Was he just a good beta tester (possibly in the lead group), or was he really significantly above everyone else? "
3702,Why is Ulquiorra's Cero green?,"Normally, all of Ceros are red in color, but why is Ulquiorra's Cero was green?  Does it mean that it's more powerful? What makes it so different? "
3703,Kneeling and Rock Throwing in Terra Formars,"In the fight between Adolf Reinhart and the cockroaches, why did the cockroaches use their kneeling friends to step on as they threw the rocks? Does doing this increases the attack power? If yes, did humans do the same thing during the age where we fought one another using similar weapons? "
3704,Where did the concept of multiple endings originate?,"A lot of games (and even anime like Oreimo) have multiple endings in addition to the Normal Ending -- most commonly the Good End, Bad End, and True End. Which series or what medias first popularized this concept?   What was the intended effect back then? Has it changed/evolved over the years? If, so how? "
3705,Explanation is needed at the end of Corpse Party - Tortured Souls OVA,"I can't figure out what's going on at the end of episode 4 of the OVA. When Satoshi, Naomi and Ayumi finally preparing the ritual to go back to their own world, Satoshi told Naomi that he knows she took other person's paper scrap. Then, he gave her his paper scrap because he had Yuka's (his sister) one.    And then, at the final scene, they made it without Satoshi. What's wrong here? If they can't use other person's paper scrap, then why Naomi still alive? Wait, I guess they can use other person's paper scrap but can't use deceased one (like Satoshi use his dead sister's one)? If so, does Satoshi purposely sacrifice himself to let Naomi escape? It's confusing though, well, I watched the OVA but didn't played the game before.   "
3706,What song is playing when Kakashi explains the terms of the bell test in episode 2?,"I have heard it in numerous episodes, including Naruto Shippuden episode 2 when Kakashi explains the terms of the bell test, and in one of the filler episodes in the war arc where Kakashi and Gai fight 2 of the swordsmen of the mist  YouTube link: [website]"
3707,Why is it that many yokai wear masks?,"While not all yokai wear masks, many do, such as the 3 yokai serving as Natori Shuuichi's shiki. Many of the other yokai that meet Natsume also wear masks.  In the story where Natsume was taken by some yokai to be presented to their boss, after he broke out of his confinement, he wore a mask to disguise himself. He also wore a mask for the same purpose when he joined the festival to take a magical kimono that enables the wearer yokai to be seen by humans. Thus it can be concluded that when a human wears a mask, it is to prevent yokai from learning that they are human.  Yet, why do yokai wear masks? What is the mythological background behind yokai wearing masks? "
3708,Why doesn't Hare fix Ayase's legs with her Bandage void?,"In episode 11 we learn that Hare's void is Bandage, a healing void. Throughout the next couple of episodes she heals Funell, a bridge, and Shu. Why doesn't Hare repair Ayase's legs so she can walk again?  Did the writers just not think of this or is there another reason? "
3709,Can a person die before their lifespan ends?,"So we all know, that everyone in Death Note has a lifespan and one day, they'll die when their lifespan runs out. But doesn't that mean, that the victims who get killed by a serial killer are destined to being killed by him? Or are their deaths destined the moment a serial killer decides to kill them? "
3710,Eighth gate of Gai,"I know if you enter and use the eight gates formation that Guy Sensei used, you will die. So I was wondering, is there a way you can use it and won't die? Perhaps use it for a second or a really short time and get out? Or not even use, just enter it for showing? And also how does one know he can use the last gate? "
3711,Could a koukaku ghoul be fast?,"I know that Koukaku ghouls are generally slow due to their kagune being heavy hitting armor protruding from below their shoulder blade, but there are other things that factor into how fast a ghoul is, like lower body strength and stuff, right? So couldn't a Koukaku ghoul also be extremely fast? I mean, Kaneki had that heavy hitting centipede Half-Kakuja that was huge, and he was still so fast, he was running on the freaking ceiling! So I think it's possible if they were very strong, and if they had a pretty lightweight kagune, they could be fast, too. However, those are my thoughts on the matter and I would like a second opinion. Actually, it would really make me feel better if I got quite a few opinions on the matter, because I'm mostly going off speculation here. "
3712,What are the powers of the Sword of Nunoboko?,"I have a few questions regarding this sword recently seen in Naruto manga (Chapter 651).  1st: How was this sword formed? I can see that it doesn't belong to the Treasured Tools of the Sage of the Six Paths. Is this forged or just formed from a special Chakra?  2nd: Does it have special abilities like the Sword of Totsuka wielded by Uchiha Itachi?  3rd: Does it have any connections to real-life history? Like the Treasured Tools of the Sage of the Six Paths related to the Chinese classic Journey to the West?  I have done an extensive research, but have not found anything useful. The wiki contains only its appearance and description from the recent chapter. "
3713,What are the similarities between Gol D. Roger and Monkey D. Luffy? Are they related by blood? What are their relatives' ages?,"This question is regarding One Piece.    I have three questions to ask. Since they are interrelated, I'm asking them as a single question on this site.    As I was reading about the prominent people in the One Piece universe, I came across Roger's page. It has been mentioned there and in many other places that Luffy is quite similar to Roger in character. Theories on some forums have gone so far as to state that Luffy is Roger's reincarnation. So,   1. Could anyone list ALL the similarities between Roger and Luffy?   This question might seem too broad and ambiguous, but when I say similarity, what I'm mostly referring to is   A common something that the two share An instance where Luffy says or does something that reminds someone of Roger Parallel life events   I came across this video and this link that cover a few of them. I'll post the relevant ones here.   A common something that the two share:   Will of D     Gol D. Roger Monkey D. Luffy The Straw Hat      In the manga and anime One Piece, Monkey D. Luffy's straw hat is the   main symbol of the entire series and is the origin of his nickname   ""Straw Hat Luffy.""          Much later, during the Straw Hat Pirates' departure for Fishman   Island, it was revealed by Silvers Rayleigh that this straw hat   originally belonged to Gol D. Roger.   Both can hear Sea Kings     Besides the Mermaid of legend, the only other people who seem to be   able to hear the Sea King have been Monkey D. Luffy and Gol D. Roger.   The latter was said to be able to ""hear the voice of all things"".  Both their first mates have a scar over one eye  This is probably pure coincidence, or not.    Silvers Rayleigh Roronoa Zoro   Both are from East Blue(?)     Loguetown, the city in the East Blue located closest to the Grand   Line, was the birthplace of the late Pirate King, Gol D. Roger.      Dawn Island: home island of Monkey D. Luffy, where he was raised in   the peaceful Foosha Village and where he trained on Mt. Colubo.   It is mentioned that Dawn Island is Luffy's home island, but is it mentioned anywhere that he was born there? The Supernova title(?)  Luffy is a Super Rookie, but was Roger one? In the video link above, Brook says     Gold Roger? There might have been a rookie by that name, or maybe   there wasn't...   Is there any solid proof that Roger was a rookie?  Instances where Luffy says or does something that reminds someone of Roger:   Luffy's smile when Buggy tries to execute him reminds Smoker of Roger     Smoker saw the smile Luffy gave off to mirror that of Gol D. Roger's   twenty-two years ago, and considered Luffy to be a potential danger to   the world.  Luffy's answer to Rayleigh when he's asked how he intends to conquer the Grand Line     Luffy replied that he does not really intend to conquer it, but that   the person with the most freedom in the ocean would be the Pirate   King. This brought a smile to Rayleigh's and Shakky's faces, seeing   the unmistakable likeness to Roger in Luffy just as Shanks saw.  Luffy's words to Raoul that he will be the next Pirate King     He was deeply shocked at hearing Luffy saying he will be the next   Pirate King and noted that the young boy was similar to Roger in his   presence.   Parallel life events:   The first person that Roger and Luffy ask to join them on their journey refuses to do so, but eventually accept the offer. Coincidentally, that person also become their crew's first mate.  Rayleigh:     At first Rayleigh declined, but some time later, he formed a bond with   Roger and became his first mate.     Zoro:     Luffy asked Zoro to join him but he flatly refused to become a pirate. Refusing to die, Zoro accepted Luffy's invitation and revealed his unique fighting style.     Could anyone list other similarities and when doing so, state where the similarity is mentioned: manga, anime or both? Also, could you prove or disprove the East Blue and Supernova cases?     The similarities could just mean that the two are extremely like-minded individuals or it could mean that they are related.  While in prison, Roger asks Garp to take care of his unborn son, Ace. From this, it is obvious that there's a strong bond between the two. Is the relationship based only on deep trust or are the Gol and Monkey families related? Basically,  2. Is Roger related by blood to Garp, and in turn, to Luffy?  A search on the web doesn't yield much, but from threads like this, this and this, a few likely possibilities(barring all supernatural theories) are:   Roger is Garp's brother or brother-in-law. Roger is Garp's son or son-in-law.   If the relationship had been revealed explicitly, Wikipedia and Wikia would have the answer. Since it's not, has it ever been implied indirectly, anywhere in the manga/anime that Roger and Luffy are blood relatives?    Since the answer to the above question might possibly be 'no' (at least for the time being), the ages of the people involved will be helpful pointers to accord with or negate theories about how Roger and Luffy could be related, to form one's own theories, or to refute the very idea that they are related. As of now, only Luffy's and Ace's ages are known, which leads to my third question,  3. What are Garp's, Roger's, Rouge's and Dragon's ages?  As with the second question, there's no answer in any online encyclopedia.   But some statements found on the Wikia pages are:        Thirty years ago, he* fought Chinjao and earned his hatred after denting his pointy head and robbing him of the means to acquire   a certain treasure.   It would seem that he** had been around for some time, considering that Brook refers to him as a rookie, more than 50 years   before the current storyline.   Twelve years before the current storyline, Dragon returned to his home in the Goa Kingdom and witnessed the burning of the Gray   Terminal.      *Garp **Roger    Have there been other time related statements in the manga/anime in relation to these four people that could be used to make a rough estimate of their ages?     My apologies regarding the lengthy question.I put in all the facts that I know so that if anyone answers this question, the things I already know will be skipped. A hardcore One Piece fan will probably be able to answer. Also, my knowledge about the series is mostly limited to the Wikia and Wikipedia pages. "
3714,What is the background of March Comes in like a Lion meets BUMP OF CHICKEN?,"There is a promotional video for March Comes in like a Lion (aka 3gatsu no Lion) called March Comes in like a Lion meets BUMP OF CHICKEN. It expands the closing song of the anime, Fighter, into a 6-minute music video, produced by the manga's author Chika Umino and the band BUMP OF CHICKEN.  I may have that backwards, though. The video may have pre-dated the anime by over a year, making the closing song a condensed version of the music video.  From what I can gather, a DVD with the video accompanied special copies of the 10th volume of the manga, released 28 Nov 2014.  The anime was announced 25 Sep 2015. If the music video pre-dated the anime, who animated it? Studio Shaft (producing the TV show) may not have even been involved.  add: The music video definitely predates the anime.  It was posted to YouTube on 8 Dec 2014.  Much of the art in the music video looks like it may have come from the anime (and a lot does not), but that could just be that they both share the manga as source material.  Also was the music video made in Flash?  Parts of it have that mechanistic feel, but I do not know enough about Flash video capability to know if it would have been up to the task.  The [Show More] section of the YouTube video has a link to a Japanese site or page apparently dedicated to the music video: 3月のライオン meets BUMP OF CHICKEN｜白泉社. It is somehow protected and won't translate (not that a translation would be very accurate). I can't even drag over and copy text from it. "
3715,Is it known whether Kaori Miyazono is half-Japanese?,"Her dad had a pretty big nose, if we want to go there. Nothing is said on the Wikia. And this question doesn't really matter... but I'm sure people want to know! Was Miyazono half-Japanese? What indications are there that she was? "
3716,What happens when an evil con-hollow dies?,"Aaroneiro and Szayel Appollo go to hell in an episode meant to promote The Hell Verse movie. Logically, they should split into individual souls and the evil souls go to hell and the rest are reincarnated judged on what they did before death.  Is this a canon depiction the fate of such beings? If so, how can it be explained? Why is the conhollowfied form judged for its sins? "
3717,Does Sasuke really need a new arm?,"So we all know that Sasuke does not have an arm. And after his fight, Sakura was saying something about making an arm out of Hashirama's cells. Thing is—Sasuke has the Rinnegan, and knows how to use it. So, he can use the Asura Path technique to get a new arm. So what was the need for an arm made of Hashirama's cells anyway? Why did they make one for Sasuke if he can get a new arm himself? And why is Sasuke missing an arm in the first place? He should have had his own new arm by now.   "
3718,Are there more Titan Shifters unknown as of now?,"These two pictures are taken from Attack on Titan Chapter 77:           In the first picture, the Beast Titan says:      '...the coordinate from here'. Does this mean there are other colonies with people like those from the Reiss family who can control titans?    In the second picture, can we conclude that there are other titan shifters who fight against humanity?  "
3719,How would you write Light Yagami's name in the Death Note?,"I don't know Japanese script, but Light would be spelled ""Tsuki"" which means ""moon"". So which of ""Tsuki"" or ""Raito"" can kill him? Would ""Light"" in English work?  It seems the death note is a stickler for spelling, as shown here: What did Light write before killing Shibuimaru Takuo? "
3720,Could an Ukaku ghoul beat a Rinkaku ghoul?,"So, when Kaneki tried to eat Hide, Touka took him on, and, according to Yoshimura, beat the *#@$ out of him. However, I feel like it wasn't a fair fight, seeing as Kaneki didn't know anything about how to use his kagune, what type of kagune Touka had, or even what types he was weak against. so, inexperienced and untrained as he was, Kaneki was obviously no match for someone who was familiar with their kagune and knew how to use it, therefore Touka had a guaranteed victory. However, if a experienced Rinkaku ghoul and an experienced Ukaku ghoul went for each others throats, who would win in the end? Ukaku ghouls have their speed and long-range projectiles, but don't have the stamina to match. Meanwhile Rinkaku ghouls have their sturdiness and extremely fast regeneration, but brittle, fragile kagune due to their RC Cells being more similar to liquids than that of other ghouls. Ukaku ghouls are weak against Koukaku ghouls, and strong against Bikaku ghouls. Rinkaku ghouls are weak against Bikaku ghouls, and strong against Koukaku ghouls. Who would win in a death match between the two? "
3721,Are Archer's twin blades a bootstrap paradox?,"According to this, Archer's weapon is based from a real weapon.  In the Holy Grail War, Shiro Emiya saw the servant Archer use those weapons. Then he traced them and used them himself. In the future, he will become the servant Archer and will be using those blades as his weapons.   Isn't it an example of bootstrap paradox? Where did he get the idea to use those weapons in the first place? Did the VN explain this? "
3722,What is this anime that was shown in Akira?,What anime is this?   I was watching some random akira videos and I found this easter egg that I never noticed before.  I remember seeing an opening of an 80s or older anime about some old police trio or something like that.Could it be possibly based off of this? Manga Mito Kōmon 
3723,What is this sheet Toshinou Kyouko is using?,"While I was looking for a cute image to post in the chat room, I came across this image    I remember in Season 2 Episode 8 - Chinatsu Unrivalled (I think), Toshinō Kyōko gets everyone to help her with her doujin work by doing some shading. From what I remember, they place the darker sheet on top of the outlined doujin pages.  So what exactly is this sheet? What is it used for? Is it something doujin artists use to supplement what a professional would use, or is it used by professional mangakas as well? "
3724,"What is ""the pose"" Eren did in chapter 89?","Please do not spoil yourself the content of this masterpiece.      In chapter 89, the first pages, Hanji says that Eren is doing ""the pose""? What does she mean? Is that the same pose that Zeke (beast titan) does or what?  "
3725,"Exactly how did Whis bring ""him"" back?","In Episode 131 of Dragon Ball Super, Whis brings Frieza back to life. How did he do it?   This is more of a question seeking confirmation on Whis' powers. Is he capable of bringing back the dead, or was it some other technique coordinated with Beerus? "
3726,What sources are Nico's cool lines taken from?,"In episode 5 of Nanbaka, we learn that Nico has a list of cool lines he wants to get to say at some point in his life.     Crunchyroll translates these as:   This hand of mine is burning red!! Say your prayers, evildoers I won't condone bad guys You're not weak, I'm just too strong Ora, ora, ora, oraa!! The heavens call, the earth cries out, the crowd roars; they are calling me to defeat evil! Balse!   #1 is from G Gundam (Domon Kasshu's God Finger); #5 is, of course, from Jojo's Bizarre Adventure; #6 is apparently the catchphrase of the title character of Kamen Rider Stronger; and #7 is from Castle in the Sky (or Re:Zero, whichever).   What about #2, #3, and #4? Are they ""from"" anything in particular, or are they just cool-sounding things Nico wants to say? "
3727,Who leaked info on section 9's kidnapping of Mr. Serano?,"- tl;dr Version -  How did information of Section 9's involvement with the second kidnapping of Mr. Serano, which happened in episode 23 of GitS:SAC, get leaked to the media? I can't find any source online that clarifies this.  - Longer Version -  In episode 23 of GitS:SAC, Major Kusanagi uses the memories she obtained from the Laughing Man to stage a second kidnapping of Mr. Serano under the guise of the Laughing Man himself in order to verify the connection between Serano Genomics and Secretary General Yakushima. During the kidnapping, Major Kusanagi impersonated the Laughing Man perfectly because, well, she was the Laughing Man for all intents and purposes. However, the degree to which the rest of Section 9 was filled in on this plot seems to be vague. Throughout the episode you can see the rest of Section 9 trying hard to ""arrest the laughing man"", though it's conceivable that this could have all been part of Section 9's plan.  Regardless of whether or not the rest of Section 9 was filled in on this plan, how on earth did the media find out that it was the Major who impersonated the Laughing Man and kidnapped Mr. Serano? At most only the members of Section 9 knew about this (and possibly the Laughing Man himself I suppose), so who leaked the information? One possibility is that Major's girly eyes gave it away, as is slightly indicated at the beginning of episode 24 when Chief Aramaki and Togusa are in the car, but that seems like a silly way for the news to be leaked. In the GitS:SAC wiki page, it's claimed that Secretary General Yakushima, the guy who this entire Laughing Man plot is focused on putting to justice, found out that Section 9 was behind the kidnapping and so leaked that info to the media (which played a very big role in the rest of the story). But how would Yakushima have known about that? Who told him?  What's really weird about all this is that in the beginning of episode 24, Chief Aramaki tells nearly everybody in Section 9 to ""find out where news of our op was leaked from."" But nobody ever seems to give an answer to this! "
3728,Did Elsie catch the runaway spirit (kaketama) that was in Nagase Jun?,"In The World God Only Knows 2 (Kami nomi zo Shiru Sekai II) episode 11 around 23:00, we can see kaketama of Nagase running away. After that, there is no information about that kaketama. It also doesn't show if Elsie catching the kaketama.  What happened to that kaketama? Did Elsie catch it? "
3729,Who are all members of Namikaze clan and is Namikaze clan a descendant of Senju clan?,"I know Minato (the fourth Hokage) is of the Namikaze clan, but I have never heard of anyone other than him belonging to the same clan. What is the Namikaze clan's history? Is it part of the Senju clan? "
3730,What race are the humans in Attack on Titan? What language do they speak?,"The majority of characters in Attack on Titan have German names. Does this mean they are Europeans? We know Mikasa Ackerman is Oriental. Did the writers avoid describing her as Asian because in the universe they have created, Asia doesn't exist? (The use of word Oriental may be a direct translation, but I'm not sure.)  Obviously the anime is in Japanese, but this surely doesn't mean the characters speak Japanese? Are characters in Attack on Titan (or any anime) self-aware about the language they speak, or their own race? How do anime/manga creators explain race and language in their art? Is this a detail that is left out because it has no explanation, or is it an answer of ""It's just that way""? Maybe anime are created in a fictional bubble with their own set of rules, and viewers are supposed to suspend disbelief.  I know this maybe a silly and or odd question, but I simply can't wrap my ahead around it.  "
3731,"Michiru is a fake blonde, ok. But what about Sachi and Amane's hair colors?","Both the VN and the anime stress that Michiru is a fake blonde.  Makina and Yumiko have natural hair colors...  But what about Amane and Sachi? I don't think there are too many natural redheads in the native japanese population of the Kyoto region (where Amane's parents are from), but I am almost sure no human is born with pink hair.  Is this just a case of ""anime hair"", and we are supposed to overlook these two hair colors (MST3k style), or is there something else abou these characters?  What about hair color as a recurring element(as @senshin pointed) in other shows? "
3732,How much of the light novels does the anime Sword Art Online covers (so far)?,"So... I want to start reading Sword Art Online light novels, but I want to read them from the point the anime left off (that is, Sword Art Online II, episode 24). Does it even go chronologically? How do I go about it?   "
3733,The real world location of Akiba Dome,"Where is the Akiba Dome that is mentioned in  Love Live! School Idol the Movie? At first since it says Akiba, I thought it would be in Akiba, Japan. But then, considering Ootonokizaka High's location (near Akiba), it doesn't make sense that they would go there on plane. Later on the Statue of Liberty was shown, so the Akiba Dome should be somewhere in New York, right? But where exactly in New York is that, because when I Googled, there is no such a thing such as Akiba Dome.  If it is actually a fictional place, what real world place is it modeled after? I guess the Madison Square Garden, just a guess though. "
3734,Is Zangetsu restored after Ichigo gets his powers back?,"This is really several questions. I do not read the manga so I'm certain this is likely covered there.  First, is Zangetsu fully restored after Ichigo's powers are restored? Does he look different? Both the Shikai and the Bankai appear different in the anime. Did this transformation result in any physical changes to Zangetsu's appearance? Of course, I mean within Ichigo's inner realm.  In the same vein, did Ichigo retain or regain any of his Hollow powers, or were they completely absorbed when he merged with his inner Hollow as revealed in episode 309? "
3735,Is the intersection of people killed by Cell and Majin Buu still dead?,"According to the rules of the earth Dragon Balls, a person can only be brought back to life once. Do the people that Majin Buu and Cell (or any other two villains) both killed remain dead despite the wishes used to bring them back? Or do these rules only apply to main characters?  It's been a long time since I watched the Majin Buu saga, but I do recall that Buu killed many people and destroyed the planet. I'm asking this question because I don't recall Goku and friends ever expressing any concern that some people wouldn't be able to be revived because they were killed twice (again, haven't seen it in a long time, so I can't be sure). "
3736,Why do people disappear?,"Why do people disappear if they become Angel's friend? Also, why did Otonashi say ""we will not disappear, be our friend"" (something like that)?   Why did other Angel's ""friends"" disappear and Otonashi and others didn't?  (""Angel"" is Kanade) "
3737,Is Bakuman realistic?,Does Bakuman explain the life of a mangaka realistically? Is the way shounen Jack works the exact same as jump? 
3738,Why was Shonen Jump called Shonen Jack in Bakuman Anime?,"Bakuman was able to get permission to use a number of titles such as One Piece, Naruto, Hunter x Hunter, etc. The creators of the manga also work for Jump. Many of the characters in Bakuman are based on real life mangakas, assistants and editors working in Bakuman.   The number of times it is used is mind boggling and seem odd to me. To be honest while companies pay for product placement, Jump had the perfect opportunity to add its own in an in-house manga/anime?  So, why did Bakuman use Jack instead of Jump, when they could have used it seemingly quite easily?  For example: Gintama has no problem using Jump in its anime.  In the manga translation I read, the magazine was called Shonen Jump, but was changed to Jack in the anime. "
3739,What are the orange stripes and fire that Eren's Titan body gets when fighting the female Titan for the second time?,"In the second fight with the female Titan, at the end, Eren's Titan gets some orange lines and fire. What is that? Is it some special power particular to his Titan just like the female Titan can harden part of her body when fighting?   "
3740,How exactly is the Eye of the Moon Plan supposed to work?,"First, I am wondering how exactly does this plan work in the Narutoverse?   When everyone is under the genjutsu, does that mean no one is actually living their own life? Or do people live their lives and the usage of the genjutsu just eliminates pain, suffering, and war?  Will the people starve to death under this technique? And if not, are they able to reproduce? And if they can do the above two, will this technique eventually cease when Madara/Obito die?   I'm just wondering if life can still continue under this technique? If so, does the technique ever stop?  Now on a more (deeper) philosophical level, how is this plan any different from Pain's total destruction plan? Both goals of the two plans are the same. They both want to end pain, suffering, and war.  Pain wanted to cause destruction to achieve his goal. Obito / Madara wants to put the whole world under a genjutsu to achieve their goal, and they are willing to cause total destruction in the process. Is there any real difference in outcomes?   The way I see it, pain is inevitable in human life. So then why bother with the Eye of the Moon plan if you can just kill the entire planet. I'm going to assume that if they have what it takes to execute this plan, they also have what it takes to just blow up the planet / eliminate all living beings.  This then leads me to believe that Madara and Obito just have psychological problems. Is this the reason why they are proceeding with this crazy plan? "
3741,Is One Piece Film Gold canon or not?,"In the film:       Tezoro stated that Loffy defeated Doflamingo, and Sabo has the Flair-Flair Fruit's power. That puts the Gold film after their fight with Doflamingo.   Also       After they defeated Doflamingo in the anime, they got separated from each other and Sanji went to his wedding and all that.   So is the film canon? If it is, when does it take place? "
3742,Can Konohamaru summon the Monkey King Enma?,Has it been revealed what Konohamaru's summons is? Did he inherit his grandfather's summons or did he show an affinity for frogs? 
3743,Whose and When did Clare felt the aura of yoma as strong and ominious as of Riful for the first time?,"In Claymore manga, chapter 45, The Witch's Maw, Part 5(21), Clare says that she has felt aura of yoma as strong and ominious as of Riful only one time before in her life.    But I don't remember her where she might have felt that aura. Among the awakened she met on her life which were shown in manga, Priscilla is the only one which have aura that powerful. But at that time, Clare was still human so she can't feel the aura.   As there are 3 case where she met the awakened(IIRC). One is the male awakened, second one is when she meets no 4 Ophelia, which was killed by Ophelia by herself and last one is the awakened Ophelia. Among three, I don't think anyone has as powerful aura as Riful.  Another option is, Clare is not talking about awakened but about the Claymore from number 1-5. As number 3 Galatea was with Clare in this fight, so she is out of the list. It can't be Number 1 Alicia and Number 2 Beth because they appear very late in manga. As remaining is number 5 Rafael, she does have enormous aura but they have never met each other. And she did felt something while walking away from Irene but not sure that was aura of Rafael or vanishing aura of Irene.  I tried out to find the time and the person but didn't find anything.  When did Clare felt the aura of yoma as strong and ominious as of Riful for the first time? Whose aura was that? "
3744,Whereabouts of Senju clan,Among the descendants of the Sage of Six Paths only the Uchiha clan seems to be alive. Where is the Senju clan (except Tsunade)? Were they eradicated during the wars? Or are they still alive? 
3745,"Why is ""-the Maxim-"" in the title?","I suspect there may be a Your Lie in April title spoiler situation here, or quite possibly I'm just dense. I'm on episode 10 of Parasyte -the Maxim- and I have been wondering the whole time what the title means.  At a guess, it could involve how episode 1 starts and ends.   start: Someone on Earth had a sudden thought. end: Someone on Earth had a sudden thought. ""Life must be protected.""   (The end quote appears at time mark 20:40.) The Google dictionary defines maxim as ""a short, pithy statement expressing a general truth or rule of conduct"".  So is that the maxim, Life must be protected.? If so, there will probably be a further reveal late in the series. Or am I way off base?  If the actual answer is a spoiler, please put it in a spoiler block. I'll hold off reading that part until finishing the series. "
3746,Do popular series like One Piece not take part in popularity polls in Bakuman?,"In the anime Bakuman, several real-world mangas were mentioned and one of them was One Piece. We saw that in the popularity polls, only the series made by the characters present in the anime taking part. I am saying this because we saw Eiji Nizuma in the first place for more than 20 times in a row.  Now, taking the real-world into consideration, and the fact that One Piece is still ongoing (so are some other series), it is very likely that those will hog the upper places.  So how come do we not only see a single character dominate the first place, but all subsequent characters taking the place below first (referring to season 3)? Is it that long-running and popular series do not take part in the polls (although that'd be a controversy since Mashiro's uncle had his manga dropped, not mentioning other problems that would bring forward)? "
3747,What was changed into an immortal object?,"In the first arc of Sword Art Online (episode 14, ~9:40), the boss whom Kirito fights activates something in a system console, and then a notice is displayed: ""Chaged[sic] into Immortal Object"".    However, this message does not seem to make sense. Despite Kirito's request,      Asuna is slain by a one-hit KO as she attempts to defend him, and Kirito is consequently killed as well. His remaining consciousness then gives one more blow to Heathcliff, who dies. Thus, it is clear that none of these three characters was given immortal status.   Was this an error, in that the message was supposed to refer to this boss removing his own immortality? If not, what exactly did this message signify? "
3748,How did Shinobu know where Araragi is when he was attacked by Tsubasa?,"In the other timeline where Shinobu destroys the world, Araragi was killed by Tsubasa. Why didn't she help him in that timeline? In both timelines, he didn't find her so what was the difference? "
3749,Does Orochi know Haise Sasaki?,Orochi reacted when he saw Haise Sasaki (Tokyo Ghoul :Re episode 1) and said      Hmmm? There's something about him...   leading me to believe that he recognized Haise Sasaki from somewhere before. How did Orochi recognize Haise? Are they anyhow related from the past? 
3750,What caused Ruka to change?,"What caused      Ruka to become a girl?   In episode 8, they jokingly try to alter      Ruka's gender to make her a girl   with a D-Mail, but what they do is scientifically crude and unlikely to do anything.  Then, they send another D-Mail which      changes Akihabara drastically   and it is after this change that Okabe discovers that Ruka has changed.  I thought it was the latter D-Mail that caused Ruka to change because it was the D-Mail directly before the change was realized, when people started behaving as if Ruka was      a girl all along.   However, when this latter D-Mail, which had an effect on the city,      is cancelled out,   Ruka is still      a girl.   Was it the former or latter D-Mail that caused Ruka to change?  Relevant episodes:  Episode 8      D-Mail sent to change Ruka's gender. Likely a failure as it just told Ruka's mother to change her diet.   Episode 9      Faris's unknown D-Mail which changes Akihabara.   Episode 10      Okabe discovers Ruka's gender change, spurred by how people treat her as a girl.   Episode 17      Okabe reverts Akihabara to its prior state.   Episode 18      Okabe has to revert Ruka to a boy.  "

3752,Is Mei Misaki dead?,I'm on episode 5. So they avoid her to not run into bad luck and stuff... but that means they see her (even though Misaki said they couldn't) so does that mean she's alive? Or is she dead? 
3753,Is distorted calligraphy used in the season 1 opening of Ushio to Tora?,"The opening sequence of the first season of anime series Ushio to Tora contains a series of images which might be distorted calligraphy, sort of like what Picasso might have done. There are a set of 6 varied-color frames, a short vertically scrolling sequence, and finally the title, which is clearly calligraphic and much less distorted. After that, the credits actually begin, now in a normal Japanese font.  Here some are:  First:   Second:   Seventh:   Title:   You can see them all beginning at time mark 4:30 of episode 1. The Seventh one is partial, a single shot from a short, vertical scrolling sequence.  I don't know if these are distorted calligraphy or not.  But going backwards beginning at the Title plate, there certainly appears to be a commonality of design. If they are calligraphic, are they legible?  If so I imagine they would be concepts such as courage, fate, etc.  If they are not calligraphic, what are they?  Do they symbolize something I should recognize? "
3754,In episode 4 of Golden Time is that the same Nana?,"At 15:27 in episode 4 of Golden Time, is that Nana the same as one of the mains in NANA?  The girl was decked out in a punk rock outfit, lugged around a guitar and gave the characters tickets to a show she's performing at. She called herself Nana. I was wondering if it's supposed to be the same Nana as one of the mains in the NANA series?   "
3755,Would it be illegal to host a anime streaming website?,I am very curious on this subject. Would it be illegal to stream anime on a website without the owners permission? If so how do many websites on the internet do it without getting in trouble? 
3756,How did Naruto call Shikamaru and the others during Obito's fight?,"Alert: This post contains spoilers. If you are not up-to-date to Naruto's manga, don't read it.  At chapter 651 of Naruto's manga, during the fight against Obito, Naruto called Shikamaru, Lee, Ino, Kiba and the others to join the fight and help him:    But what kind of jutsu did Naruto use to call them? Is he using the abilities of Yamanaka's clan or his own Kyuubi's chakra has this kind of power too?  "
3757,Is Eto/Takatsuki Sen the One-Eyed Owl?,"So I was introduced to Tokyo Ghoul by watching the anime. I recently started reading the manga and was surprised when I saw this on the character profile on the back-lid of the front cover of Tokyo Ghoul volume 14 (the final volume before :re):         I know it is implied that Eto is Takatsuki Sen in the anime and manga, but I don't recall anywhere in the anime where it is revealed that Eto/Takatsuki Sen is the One-Eyed Owl. I also don't think I recall reading in the manga that this was the case (until I saw this image).  Did I miss something? Is Eto/Takatsuki Sen the One-Eyed Owl? "
3758,How Edward managed to escape from Gluttony?,"In Episode 24 and 25 of Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, Ed, Ling Yao and Envy are trapped in a sub-dimension that was created for storing everything that Gluttony has ever swallowed.  Envy told that there's no escape, but Ed has found out something. What did he do exactly?  As far as I can get, he did human transmutation to open the Gate of Truth and by this, he can escape. But how is it possible? Since the sub-dimension is separated from the actual world.  Also, why Ed didn't lose anything when he opened the Gate again? Why Envy and Ling neither? "
3759,Are Watari and Kaori a couple by the time she is hospitalized after missing the gala violin concert?,"One of the reasons Kousei uses to rationalize never making a move on Kaori (and the real reason being his indecisiveness, in my opition) is that she is Watari's girl/romantic interest.  Watari and Kaori are never shown as a couple, or even having anything between them beyond friendship, when they are together onscreen. Kaori doesn't seem to even give Watari the time of the day.  In episode 17, he tells Kousei ""For the woman I love, I would drink even muddy water"", while trying to usher him into visiting Kaori. His attempt at pushing Kousei into going there seems a perfectly fine wingman behavior, so I am quite confused.  So, there are a couple unknowns here:  In the fist episode, it is clearly stated that Watari has an interest in Kaori (and it is what starts the whole ""Friend A"" Kousei's self-demeaning thought train). Did they move forward?  Is Watari really wingmanning Kousei when he tells him to go visit her? "
3760,What's the medical condition Whitebeard has?,"Whitebeard had a clear medical condition and it seemingly wasn't just old age. What was it, and why does he have it?  What did it impact? "
3761,Why didn't the Eight Tails' horns grow back?,"From Eight Tails article:     The lower left part of its horns was permanently sliced off in a battle with A, and the right horns were destroyed by its own point-blank Tailed Beast Ball when fighting the Ten-Tails.       Instead of hind-legs, its lower half consists of its eight tails, which resemble the cephalopod arms of an octopus. These tails will grow back in the event they are sliced off.    If the tails are able to grow back, then why can't the horns too? Since Gyūki is made of chakra, how was it possible to permanently slice off a part of its horns? "
3762,Why Tifa is conscious in The Last Order?,"In the short anime Final Fantasy VII: The Last Order, which retells events of Nibelhelm conflict, when Cloud arrives to Nibel mountain reactor Tifa regains consciousness and sees Cloud, stating that he came to save her just as he promised.  Yet, in original Final Fantasy VII Tifa remains unconscious, so she doesn't know that Cloud ever was in Nibelhelm (and some plot details heavily rely on this) until visiting his memories.  So, is this a mistake in the anime script? Or is it somehow explained why Tifa later doesn't remember Cloud visiting Nibelhelm? "
3763,Why does Kuzen not have red eyes when wielding his kagune?,"I love Tokyo Ghoul and have the manga, but can someone please explain to me why Kuzen doesn't have red eyes when wielding his kagune in the anime?  Is it just a mistake made when animating this episode?     Is this related with the fact that the manager always has his ghoul eyes in the later episodes?  "
3764,Did Major Gilbert survive?,"In the last episode of Violet Evergarden, when introducing herself, Violet paused and had a bit surprised look.  Is it possible that Gilbert is the one she met there in that cottage? Has there been any statement from the author on this? "
3765,Can someone help me interpret the end of root A?,"At the end of root A, all that is shown to us is this at the last scene:   Can someone help me understand what is happening here? Or what do you guys think is happening here if we don't have solid evidence? "
3766,What happened to Koufuu Hino?,"In From the New World (episode 18), during the Summer Festival attack, Koufuu Hino is protecting the people:    And he got killed by a sneak attack from the Monster Rats.  Upon his death, uh, his eyes kind of shot a beam of light into the sky, and a figure of a woman appeared. Apparently, she smiled at Saki.  What exactly happened there? Who was that woman supposed to be?   "
3767,Why did Dio cut off his head and not regenerate his body?,"In the first season of Jojo's Bizarre Adventure, when Dio falls off a cliff, he cuts off his own head.    Why?   At the end of the season, we see him in Jojo's wedding boat, his head in a container.    Why didn't he regenerate a body during all this time?  "
3768,"Why do animes have this ""milky""-like texture?","So I've always noticed this for years watching anime, I always look at anime characters and they seem to have to kind of milky/blurry texture on their skin/clothes. It's not to noticeable to some people, but hopefully you can see what I mean with these pictures.   (Click the pictures and zoom in for a better idea of what I mean.)      I copy and pasted the pics in Photoshop and used the eye drop tool on different areas of the skin and clothes. The color codes jump around everywhere so they can't be solid.  Could it be that these frames were scanned in at a certain DPI? Maybe something as a result of an editing software like After Effects? Or maybe it's the texture of the paper? "
3769,Why are Sailor Senshi earthlings?,"Tuxedo Mask is the protector of Earth, so it makes sense for him to be an earthling.  But what about the Solar System Sailor Senshi? Shouldn't they have been born on their respective planetary bodies, and live there protecting them? Why are they protecting Earth instead?  For example, I would expect Sailor Mars to be a real martian:   "
3770,What happened to the one-eyed twins after they escaped?,"Last we saw them, the one-eyed twins who seemed to be against Aogiri and the CCG were terribly wounded and struggling to escape Cochlea prison, while the CCG and Aogiri battled during a prison break of every ghoul held in Cochlea. Amon saw them escaping but did they even really get out of that maximum security ghoul prison? Did they get caught in the crossfire, or caught by the CCG's reinforcements? What exactly happened to them? "
3771,Where was Danzo when Pain attacked?,"When Naruto arrived, he and the toads fought Pain. The only other people of the Hidden Leaf, in my opinion, who were powerful enough to help would be:   Kakashi and other dead people Guy—not in the village Tsunade—in a comma The Uchihas—seemingly defected from the Leaf Danzo   Where was Danzo? He would not have wanted the Leaf to be destroyed, so I would imagine he would help here and also when Orochimaru attacked the Leaf in part 1.  Is there any hard evidence to support why Danzo didn't help in either attack? "
3772,Why did Naruto need to summon his Shadow Clones during his fight with Pain?,"While fighting Pain, Naruto used his Shadow Clones to store his Sage Mode chakra. Since the clones were at Mount Myoboku, he needed to summon them with a scroll.  A) Why didn't he just release the jutsu to get back the chakra in the clone?  B) Why did he need a scroll? Couldn't he have summoned him with just hand signs? "
3773,Why has she not changed at the end of Suruga Monkey?,"Why has      Kanbaru not regained her human arm   by the end of Suruga Monkey in Bakemonogatari?  If the Rainy Devil is gone, why is she still the way she was when it possessed her? "
3774,"While Rido possessing another body, will their bite turn the victim into a vampire?","Rido can transfer his soul into/possess other people's bodies.  Now, if he bites someone while in that other body, will they turn into a vampire? Or would it be like if any other non-pure blood bit them? "
3775,Ending of Bloody Monday season 3,"I started reading this series around 5 years ago. Finally finished it because the last chapter was finally translated, so I might have forgotten some things along the way.  Can someone explain to me the ending? My guess is that it was Maya in disguised delivering the flowers. The delivery lady also states the bouquet was from a ""friend"". If it is really Maya's gift, that makes me wonder is it actually a gift or perhaps a bomb / something malicious?  What is the intent and purpose of the flowers? "
3776,How long does producing a cour take?,"I've read through some questions about financing anime and so on, but don't know how long it takes to produce a complete cour of anime. I'm talking writing about 12 to 13 episodes, of a standard-length anime (roughly 20 minutes, nothing like Aiura).  Is there an average time needed to produce a series? Are we talking about months? "
3777,Is there any continuation to the marriage ceremony that got cut in the middle of the last episode of Shippuden?,"Episode 500 of Shippuden, the final episode shows some of the characters' marriage. However, their marriage ceremony fades through the white door.  I'd at least thought Naruto would be there for their ceremony and some happy moments before the story closes, but no.  Is there any official statement why it got cut/ended like that? Is there any OVA/continuation to their marriage ceremony somewhere?  (I know there's Boruto, but this question is more about their marriage ceremony, not the story long after that)  "
3778,What is this memorial/offering in The Walking Man?,"In The Walking Man by Jiro Taniguchi, the main character is walking down a road when he passes what seems like a roadside memorial:    I couldn’t find much information online about roadside memorials in Japan (what I found didn’t look like this) or offerings (closer to the image above).  What is it exactly? And what are the things that form it? (flowers, yes, but what are the other two things) "

But how does a man so huge, who is almost big as the Marine Headquarters, get put in the Level 6 of Impel Down? Also, when Blackbeard came, how does he get out? "
3780,Can Lugia be a legendary one that reproduces itself?,"In the official Pokedex, it says that Lugia does not have gender. In many games, there is only one Lugia.  But in EP221 a Lugia's pup is shown and captured by the Rocket team, and Lugia, hitherto genderless, is treated as ""the mother who fights for her son.""  If Lugia is a legendary and genderless type and, possibly, unique, how can he have a puppy? Legendary can reproduce even if they have no gender? "
3781,Why Uchiha Itachi didn't make his Mangekyo Sharingan eternal?,"To make an Eternal Mangekyo Sharingan, you need to transplant another Mangekyo Sharingan, right?  Itachi has activated his when Shisui died and Shisui gave his eye to Itachi.  So why didn't he transplant that eye and make his Sharingan eternal? "
3782,Why is there no reanimated Uchiha fighting in fourth shinobi war?,Why didn't Kabuto reanimate any person from Uchiha clan like Sasuke's parents and all other that Itachi killed or any Uchiha that has lived in Konoha? Did he not have any one's dna or whatever it takes to reanimate? Is there any mention about this in manga or anime? Thanks. 
3783,What is a kakuja?,"Okay this is several questions. For one, what exactly is a Kakuja? I mean, I get that they're extra kagune obtained by cannibalism, but what causes that to happen? How come Kaneki's takes the form of a centipede? All I know is it's somehow related to Yamori, but how did Yamori trigger this change in Kaneki? And why did it cause Rize and Yamori to become one with him? "
3784,What is the song when Usopp is defeating Sugar by using his Haki?,"In One Piece episode 697, there's a song when Ussop is defeating Sugar using his Haki. It starts at 0:53 in this YouTube video.  What is this song? Is it already released as a soundtrack? "
3785,Will Haise regain his memories and adopt to his true personality as Kaneki again?,"Will Haise become Kaneki again? By that, I mean if Haise will regain his memories and adopt his true personality as Kaneki?   I have a little bit knowledge of Haise's backstory (how Kaneki became amnesiac) but I haven't watched season 3 or read the manga (both Tokyo Ghoul and Tokyo Ghoul:re) yet.   Did this event occur in the anime or in the manga yet? "
3786,Power of M.U.I transformation,"So in DBS (now that the last episode has aired). Where exactly does mastered Ultra Instinct rank?   We know that Jiren is a mortal with god level strength. And we know that Mastered Ultra Instinct matched and overpowered Jiren until it's end state.   But where does it classify? Greater than god or something? I know trying to understand power rankings in Dragon Ball is quite a pain but I am curious as to if any interviews, trivia, video game etc. Have shed any light on this.   Previously, it was established that the power of ultra instinct is in unconscious attack and defense but it's clearly shown that it's power goes beyond kaiokenx10 ssb. So now that everything is set in stone.   Where does it rank?  This is related: Power of Ultra Instinct  "

3789,Does Mr. Braun still have his secret occupation in the beta world line (1%)?,"We know that FB is Mr. Braun. Now Okabe is in the Beta worldline, and M4, a.k.a. Moeka, is working part-time for Mr. Braun, a.k.a. FB which is very suspicious... Technically, they are still operating as Rounders, right? It's just they haven't take any actions against the Future Gadgets Lab yet, apart from retrieving the IBN 5100.  Right guys? "
3790,At what age did Kakashi Hatake become a Jounin?,"This answer on Yahoo! says he became a Jounin at the age of 13, which makes him the youngest Jounin.     I have heard a lot of chatter on the subject, but I've never seen the answer stated outright (or with any proof). The youngest I've seen reference to was Kakashi. He was a chunin at 6, a jonin at 10, and joined ANBU Black Ops at 13.      Itachi, on the other hand, became a chunin at 10 and became a Captain of ANBU Black Ops at 13. He's still pretty amazing, but Kakashi was younger.      Sources:         [website]  [website]     Is it true that he is the youngest Jounin? What is his real age when he became a Jounin?  The magic number starts from at the age of 5 "
3791,What was it that Rido did to the Night Class?,"In the Vampire Knight anime, when the Night Class is getting ready to attack him, Rido holds up one of his hands, from which black shadows shoot out and wrap around the Night Class.  I am wondering, is this a representation of Rido's power as a Pure Blood to force other vampires to obey? Or is it a unique ability he possesses, like the case with other vampires (Aido can freeze stuff, Ruka has hypnosis)? "
3792,What happened to Yin' spectre by the end of episode 14 of Darker than Black?,Her spectre was captured and used to lure her right? What happened in the end? Does she get her spectre back? Or do I just keep watching to find out? What exactly does capturing a spectre do? 
3793,What powers did Gol D. Roger possess?,I am a big fan of the One Piece manga. I just started watching the anime (completed 3 seasons).  I was wondering: What powers did the Pirate King Gol D. Roger possess?  Is there any chapter/episode which reveals his powers? Or is there any theory about it? 
3794,Why are unrelated one-shots by Masami Tsuda included in compilations of Kare Kano?,"While reading Kare Kano, I noticed that the extras included in the tankobon compilations seem to have absolutely no relation to the story of the main manga. (I have just finished the fourth volume of Kare Kano, so I've read both ""The Tiger and the Chameleon: A Promise for One Week"" and ""Meet Me Again Tomorrow in the Forest"". The former involves students in high school and has a romance theme, but it does not seem to belong to the same setting as Kare Kano. The latter is a story of a half-alien, half-human girl's experiences with racism on another planet.)  This observation was backed-up by some research that I did: the two extras that I have read so far appear to be works written by Masumi Tsuda in 1994 and 1993 respectively, prior to her publication of Kare Kano.  Why were pre-existing unrelated works included as extras? In the past, had other manga compilations done the same thing? I could imagine this as a means to ""promote"" the author or provide readers with bonus content at low cost, but in other manga that I've read, such as Fullmetal Alchemist, extra one-shots were clearly related to the main content. "
3795,"What's the difference between Father, Van Hohenheim, and the main Homunculi?","After rewatching most of FMA: Brotherhood, I'm a bit confused.  In Episode 40, Van Hohenheim explained that he's a humanoid form of the Philosopher's Stone. What difference does it make from the main Homunculi (Pride, Wrath, Envy, Gluttony, Lust, and the others) who use it only as an energy source?  For example, Wrath was a regular human being before he got the Stone, compared to Hohenheim who is the Stone itself. What are they different in?  Also, is Father the same? Since he was a Homunculus too (or whatever, I'm not even sure...), but he got the same ""reward"" in Xerxes as Hohenheim.  So, what's the difference between Father, Van Hohenheim, and the Homunculi?  "
3796,Why couldn't Mitsuha and Taki remember each other's names?,"In the second half of Your Name (after the body switching stops happening), Mitsuha and Taki can't remember each other's names. They can even end up forgetting the names within 10 seconds of seeing each other. Why does this happen? One theory I have is:      Before Taki intervenes, Mitsuha would have died when the comet hit. Taki couldn't remember her name because her future was hanging in the balance.   But this answer doesn't entirely work. For one,       He still fails to remember her name after they rescue Itomori, and Mitsuha is no longer at risk of dying   And second off      Taki was never in risk of dying in the comet, but Mitsuha still can't remember his name either.   So why did this happen? I know this is somewhat the main theme of the whole movie, but it never made sense to me how they could forget so quickly. It's almost like something was actively causing them to forget. "
3797,What do Karen and Tsukihi see Ononoki as?,"They told Araragi he would never grow up since he was still talking to a doll (Ononoki) at his age in Tsukimonogatari episode 4, 31 minutes in. It's always hard to tell how different people perceive the same phenomenon in Monogatari series, which is fun and puzzling.  What do Karen and Tsukihi see Ononoki as? Do they not perceive Ononoki as a human being? "
3798,OST in the 2nd season of Magi episode 19 around 4:43,"I have been wondering what the song at 4:43 episode 19 is in Magi season 2, Magi: The Kingdom of Magic. It plays when      the Leam and the Fanalis broke through the first barrier of Magnostadt and the Fanalis group leader did his little pep-talk to attack the mages of Magnostadt.   It sounds really nice but I cannot seem to find this one.  I've been going around some OST lists but can't seem to find this one specifically.   What is this OST called? Where could it be found? "
3799,Is Tanaka's high school more fancy than most in Japan?,"The main setting of Tanaka-kun Is Always Listless appears to me to be extraordinarily fancy, at least by my American experience of going to high school in Wisconsin.  Outside:    Do those poles along the building support a net, maybe to protect windows from stray balls? The surrounding area is beautiful, with a rural forested feel and located near a river.  Inside:    It appears as if one end is open, and there are other shots of small patios upstairs. Apparently they do not air condition the middle area -- it is sort of a breezeway, albeit with one end partially closed off.  I am impressed by the sunroof, the middle downstairs area which appears to be some sort of courtyard or atrium, and the upstairs walkway which reminds me more of an indoor shopping mall than a high school. I don't remember other anime where the high school itself was so interesting.  Wow, a Google search for Japanese high school architecture starts off with 5 more affluent-looking schools.  Maybe the word architecture tuned the search for high end samples. It gets even more impressive if you click over to Images. This ain't Wisconsin. "
3800,"Why does Homura have to die within her soul gem in ""Movie Part III: Rebellion""?","In Puella Magi Madoka Magica the Movie Part III: Rebellion, why does Homura have to die within her soul gem in order not to betray Madoka as she said here?  Even if Kyubey confirms the existence of God Madoka, it doesn't mean he has the power to manipulate it to his advantage. After all, God Madoka's power is greater. That's why Madoka is a God, isn't it? "
3801,What decides that a anime series gets a sequel or not?,"A lot of the anime I've watched are single, double or triple season anime series like Durarara!, Code Geass, Hagure Yuusha no Aesthetica, and Nabari no Ou, just to name a few. But there are also shows like Bleach, Naruto, D Grey Man, and Katekyo Hitman Reborn that have 300 or more episodes.  Why is that? How is it decided that these series get to go on so long?  "
3802,What does the title of first chapter of Attack on Titan (進撃の巨人 Shingeki no Kyojin) mean or signify in the context of manga?,"To You, 2000 Years From Now (二千年後の君へ Ni-sen nen-go no Kimi e) is the 1st chapter of the 1st volume and the 1st chapter overall of the Attack on Titan manga.    Who is the you?  And what is the significance of bringing up a timeline 2000 years from now?    One thing that is bugging me that the chapter,  volume and manga starts with Eren waking up fro a dream, crying and exclaiming that Mikasa's hair has grown longer?  As put in wiki:     Meanwhile, Eren Yeager is having a dream about an older version of his close friend, Mikasa, bidding him goodbye. He is promptly woken up by the real Mikasa, who insists that he is been sleeping for a while. As the two return to their village, Eren begins crying, but when Mikasa asks why, he does not give an answer.     "
3803,Who/what is Gamers and what is their connection to the Love Live series?,"In the first episode of Love Live! School Idol Project season 2, the girls went to what I assume is an arcade where the front sign says Gamers. When watching the ED for episode 2, I noticed this same logo appear in the credits (this is the localized version released by NISA).  I am wondering who/what is Gamers and what is their connection to the Love Live series? Is it just a product placement deal with the anime or has it got something to do with the real life idol group? "
3804,Why does Edo Tensei Madara have Rinnegan?," Edo Tensei restores a person the way they were at the time of their death. When Madara died, he was wrinkly and old. How come Edo Tensei Madara is brand new? Rinnegan is not a kekkei genkai/tota. Why does Edo Tensei Madara still possess the Rinnegan when, at the time of his death, he wasn't possessing Rinnegan (because he implanted them onto Nagato)?  Madara lost vision in one eye due to usage of Izanagi, but after awakening the Rinnegan, was he able to restore his Eternal Mangekyou Sharingan that he lost?   "
3805,What does Captain Kurotsuchi do to Nemu in Bleach Episode 200?,What does Captain Kurotsuchi do to bring Nemu back to consciousness after her spirit particles have been absorbed by Szayelaporro?

3806,Hellsing Organization: Is it Anglican or Protestant?,Does the Hellsing Organization belong to the Anglican Church or the Protestant Church? Or is it a secular organization? 
3807,When did otaku become a derogatory term?,"Related: Is the term Otaku derogatory?    I have been reading The Moe Manifesto lately, and noticed in a lot of the interviews, the term otaku was never really used in a derogatory form.  One of the interviews in particular mentioned something about otaku only becoming a derogatory term after some serial killer, which was found vaguely related to the anime culture, killed a bunch of children. However I could not find any credible online sources to confirm this.  This does however raise my question, when did otaku become a derogatory term?  Edit       Actually now that i started to look into it a bit it seems it has always been a derogatory term at least in Japan, but the situation seems to improve nowdays - Proxy    During the interview with Otsuka Eiji     patrick w galbraith   how should we define otaku?        Otsuka Eiji   To tell the truth, I dont really know. The word otaku was first used by writer Nakimori Akio in manga Burikko, back in 1983 when I was in my twenties and working as the magazines editor. It was the first time the term was publicly used to refer to enthusiastic manga and anime fans...      patrick w galbraith   Why do you think Nakamori chose this particular word to refer to Japanese fans?      Otsuka Eiji   The term otaku is a second person pronoun equivalent to you. It was used among scifi fans in the 1970s. By the 1980s the market for manga and anime had expanded and it supported a wide variety of specialty magazine, which provided space for new artist to work in niches.  "
3808,Who controls the mind after fusion in DBZ?,"In Dragon Ball Z, after fusion, who controls the mind and the body? Is it both or a single person? "
3809,"What does it mean that ""One for All"" allows to stockpile power?","In My Hero Academia, they say that the quirk ""One for All"" allows the user to stockpile power. What does this mean exactly? Does it mean that the current user has the quirks of the previous users? Does it mean that the current user has the added strength, speed, resistance, etc. of the former users combined? Or does it mean he can save strength, speed, resistance, power, etc. when he isn't using it, having it ""stockpiled"", and using it altogether, at some moment? Or does it have any other meaning? "
3810,What exactly happened to Yuta Gamon?,"Note: This entire question is a spoiler, so as it doesn't make sense to put the entire question in a spoiler block, read at your own caution.    At the end of Occultic;Nine, Yuta Gamon fires the unlocked Poya-Gun (revealed to be the Wardenclyffe Gun) at the Odd Eye in order to stop the New World Order from completing their mission.  It's presumed that he never makes it back to the human world (AKA is resurrected like the rest of the main cast), but what exactly happened to him?   I'm especially confused about the significance of the Sky Sensor playing staticky sounds in his father's old recording studio at the very end. Did Yuta return to the wavelength meant for the dead and in turn, get reunited with his father (again) or did he get stuck in the wavelength that the New World Order shifted to in an attempt to prevent Yuta from stopping them? "

3812,Who saved Hatchin from drowning in episode 7?,"Near the end of episode 7 (""The Monotone of Falling Rain"") of Michiko to Hatchin, Hatchin almost drowns. Before she passes out, she sees a (female?) figure above the water.    At the same time, Michiko is shown to be sulking in the hotel. The next scene shows Hatchin back in the hotel, next to a drunk Michiko.  So, who saved Hatchin? "
3813,What do the parenthesized numbers in the [color] Scenes mean?,"As you can see at the top of this answer, the [color] Scenes (Black Scene, Red Scene, etc.) in the Monogatari series all include a parenthesized number beneath the romanized form of the name of the color shown.   Here's a list of them:  ROMANIZED  GLOSS         NUMBER   KANJI(READING) aka        ""red""          (135)   赤　（あか）  kuro       ""black""        (629)   黒　（くろ） shiro      ""white""       (4646)   白　（しろ） ki         ""yellow""      (0303)   黄　（き） ouchi      ""lilac""        (349)   楝　（おうち） ao         ""blue""         (014)   青　（あお） momo       ""peach""        (372)   桃　（もも） moegi      ""light green""  (469)   萌黄（もえぎ） murasaki   ""purple""       (039)   紫　（むらさき）   Question: What do the numbers mean?  Possibilities:   Something to do with color codes (but this is unlikely because neither ""white"" nor ""black"" seems to have a special number) Some sort of character code for either the kanji, the kana reading, or the romanized form (though I haven't come up with anything for this) It's all a clever ruse by Shinbo to confuse us ???  "
3814,Does Nenene Sumiregawa seem like a Kansai-jin?,"In the anime R.O.D the TV, one of the principal characters is Nenene Sumiregawa, a famous author with an unusual personality for Japan: quick-tempered, brash, outspoken, defiant.  She lives in Tokyo now, and we learn very little about her past, but I’m wondering if she’s being portrayed as someone originally from Kansai. It seems to fit her personality better than the more cultured/repressed Tokyo style. I would guess it also fits her voice, because her seiyuu, Satsuki Yukino, hails from Ōtsu, Shiga Prefecture, in the Kansai region.  So, to those who are familiar with the series and who can judge such things: Does she sound like she speaks Kansai-ben (possibly influenced by several years in Tokyo)? Does she act like a Kansai-jin? Is she a character that most Japanese viewers would immediately recognize as being from Kansai? "
3815,Why does Madara give Nagato his Rinnegan?,Why does Madara give his Rinnegan to Nagato? Madara had already activated the Rinnegan since he is an Uchiha and also has the DNA of the first Hokage. But why does he give it to Nagato?  
3816,What is the Keijo manga release cycle?,Not sure if my phrasing is correct but does anyone know the manga release cycle of Keijo!!!! (Hip whip girl)?   I haven't seen an issue for it in a while and the source I use to read it seems to only update monthly.  Does the manga actually release monthly? And how can I find this information for future series that I read?  
3817,How do you pronounce Roronoa's name?,"I've heard from varying sources that Roronoa's name is pronounced two different ways and I was wondering what is the correct way to say it. I have heard it pronounced 'Zoro' in the manga but my bilingual (Japanese and English) friend says that it is pronounced 'Zolo.' So what is the correct way to pronounce his name?   What I'm trying to ask is, is his name Zoro or Zolo?  Also is Roronoa his first or last name? "
3818,What case is Naoto remember in Yosuke's horror story?,"During the Sky Trip in January when Yosuke is telling everyone a horror story about a girl who though another girl's ghost was coming after her, Naoto comments that she had heard about this as a case once before.  Do we know anything about this case is real or not? and how much it relates to Yosuke's Story? "
3819,Who generally owns the rights for a manga or anime?,"Who generally owns the intellectual property (IP) rights to manga characters and stories?  In the USA, comic books are generally produced by a team -- writer, artist, inker, colorist, letterer, editor, and maybe even plotter. Sometimes one or more of these folks can sometimes even get replaced mid-issue. The characters are typically part of a shared universe involving multiple, interacting characters. It makes sense that Marvel and DC, the largest publishers would own the IP.  It also makes sense that some of the artistic folks would want full ownership and control over their work, and independent publishers were formed allowing this. The leading publishers partially adapted to this desire, and sometimes grant limited exclusivity to the creator of a character. Ownership was still with the publisher, but only the creator could make decisions concerning their character, so long as they remained with the publisher.  From what I understand, manga is vastly different. One person handles writing, art, and lettering.  There is no colorist, and the publisher's editor generally suggests things, not mandates them. Characters from different manga seldom interact. With the one-person focus, it would make sense to me that the mangaka would hold IP rights. Is this generally the case?  Anime is broader, involving many folks for one series. Are they simply licensed to tell the mangaka's (or some other person's) story? (Maybe this is similar to how Fox is licensed to make X-Men movies, even though the X-Men themselves belong to Marvel.) I know some anime is a new work not based on a manga or light novel. In those cases, the studio is the creator, and it is likely they own the IP as well. "
3820,How is the ability of a Devil Fruit discovered?,"Since there is just one Devil Fruit for a specific ability, how does one know about what ability it holds? For example, Buggy and Teach knew about the powers their Devil Fruits would have provided them. It is mentioned that they had read about it. But if the fruit occurs only once till the user dies, how did they find out about the fruits' powers? "
3821,Where did the 9 tails of Sora go?,"Towards the end of Naruto Shippuden season 4, the 9 tail's chakra left Sora's body and then Yamato said that it will try to seek a new host now. Who was that new host? Did the chakra in Sora come back to Naruto, the real host of the 9 tails? "
3822,"In Soul Eater, does the rest of the world know about Demon Weapons and the DWMA?",Do other people who live outside Death City know about the DWMA and about Demon Weapons? Or is it some covert operation in an attempt to secretly purge the world of evil? I am unsure if this is a known fact that has evidence to support it or simply up to one's own interpretation. 
3823,Ladybug theme song identification,"Ladybug PV. The anime is probably Miraculous Ladybug, but can anyone identify the title of the song used in this PV? "
3824,Why did BiBi change their center in their live shows for the song Love Novels?,"According to Wikia, the original Love Novels has Ayase Eri as the center, but it was replaced by Nico in the live shows.    Has it been disclosed why this was the case? What is the reason behind the change? "
3825,What's He Smokin'?,"  Something has been bothering me lately and I don't know how quite to put it. I know Cromartie High School is known for its absurdist, non sequitur humor but does anyone know exactly what students at Cromartie smoke? Is it jello? I must find out. "
3826,The connection between the deadly sins and the animals in Nanatsu no Taizai,"In Nanatsu no Taizai, the main characters are associated with one of the 7 deadly sins, and to each sin is associated with a certain animal:   Wrath - dragon Envy - snake Greed - fox Sloth - grizzly Lust - goat Gluttony - boar Pride - lion   Is there some reference in this association? Does it correspond to some tradition or is it just made up in this manga? "
3827,"What did Griffith mean when he said ""you are mine"" to Guts?","Mind to help me with this curiosity? Griffith acts differently after Guts decides to leave. He says, ""you are mine"" to him.   Was this to imply that he was gay for Guts? Ever since they have first met, it confuses me.  "
3828,What happen at the end of the third Madoka Magica movie?,"I just watched the third movie (Puella Magi Madoka Magica the Movie Part 3: Rebellion) and I have a doubt about the fact that although Madoka wish in the second movie, which prevented the birth of any witch, both in the past and in the future. Why then Homura becomes a Witch?  I get an idea, but I'm not pretty sure about it. In the ending we see Homura feeding QB with her soul gem. Does this mean that all the curses of the universe are now contained in Homura's soul gem? And that feeding QB with them is a way to stop entropy?  When Homura says to Sayaka and Madoka that one day they will be enemies, is she referring to the fact that without suffering sooner or later the universe will run out of energy and Madoka and Sayaka will have to stop her? "
3829,How many DBZ episodes were actually made?,I've seen 276 episodes of DBZ but in many places it is written that there are 291 episodes.   Is this true or just a rumor? If it's true then is there anything I've missed out? 
3830,At which point in the series should I watch the The Last: Naruto the Movie and Boruto: Naruto the Movie?,"Okay, so I just recently watched episode 441 of the English sub of Naruto, and I was wondering whether I had caught up enough to watch The Last: Naruto the Movie and Boruto: Naruto the Movie?  Could someone tell me after which episode should I watch them? "
3831,Where exactly did they send Rin?,"Heavy spoilers warning. This question is based on the VN, it should be applicable to the anime, though I'm not sure.    In Rin's 2nd route, she is sent to another school where      many students died in a bus crash, and the rest are traumatized as a result. Rin is supposedly sent to help them.   However, as we know,      the bus crash actually happened to them.   With that in mind, where is Rin actually sent?      The place she is sent to does not exist, how does Kyousuke create something that should be an entirely different school with different people? Did he at all? What does Rin actually experience there? It breaks her mind as we can see in Refrain, but I don't know what it actually is that she experiences there.  "
3832,Goku SSJ Berserker in Dragon Ball Heroes?,According to this video (in spanish) Goku SSJ Berserker a magazine has showed a capture of a Dragon Ball Heroes card and it states Goku is going to achieve the super saiyan berserker form. Is this true? Can anyone read the japanese text showed in the video and/or the magazine and say if this is true?   
3833,Why was the world of SAO not dominated by good real-life fencers?,"There are many people in real life who practice fencing for fun. Most of them (at least most of those around me) also play computer games about fighting. Sword Art Online clearly fits into the fighting genre of computer games. I didn't make a survey, but in any game about fencing it is certainly possible to find someone who likes do the same things in real life.  As I recall, in the world of SAO combos are quick, but very predictable, especially the strong ones, and their speed is not above human limits.  As I assume, if one real-life swordsman would get his hands (or his mind) on SAO, he would wreck everyone. One can move his weapon without combos, losing some speed, but getting a huge advantage of being able to use feints. Plus he would be able to stop his attacks to block enemy's blow, etc.  Yes, he would probably be weaker at the beginning due to not knowing the animations yet and most of combos being very short. Plus, he would probably need to get used to the pace of SAO, which may differ from real-life. But at higher levels he could both identify a combo by it's first ""frames"", plus quickly react. It would also be nearly impossible to hit him unless he doesn't expect an attack.  One could claim that he would lose muscle memory -- he wouldn't, since this process is more mental rather then some change applied to muscles.  Why did this not happen in the novel, why was it dominated by a bunch of Mary Sue-esque characters? Or did I miss something? "
3834,"Need help in identifying movie with a boy who can turn into a tree, and a girl from centuries ago","I saw this movie within the past few years. It was an awesome movie but I can't for the life of me remember the name!   Here is what I remember:   A boy finds a girl sleeping in a glass pod underwater with thousands of others. He takes her to his village to help her recover. His village is connected by bridges to a dangerous, carnivorous forest on one side, and an industrialized desert on the other side. The boy's father is slowly becoming a tree. It turns out that the girl is from the same civilization, the apocalypse destroyed much of the world, and the people of her city were preserved in pods underwater. She came back to life hundreds of years in the future to a low-tech society. The people of her time used Ribbon (pronounced Ri-BONE) technology in much the same way we use Apple Watches and Google Glass. It's like a cross between a holographic smartphone and a necklace. Or bracelet(?) I forgot. The girl and anyone else who has come back from that time, is viewed as dangerous and is killed by bounty hunters from outside the village. They collect their Ribbons as trophies, but the bounty hunters can't use them because the Ribbon is bound to its user.   Here, the story gets a little fuzzy:   The girl ends up riding on a train to the industrial desert city. She is valuable to them somehow. The city has huge steampunk beasts used for war. The boy and girl end up in a volcano base which has mechanical legs and can move. The boy turns into a huge tree to help her escape the volcano.   I really, really liked this movie. Can you tell me what it is?  "
3835,What's the crater in the mountain shown after Izuku talks to Kota in season 3 episode 3?,"In My Hero Academia last episode, after Izuku talks to Kota, they show a sort of crater in the mountain. Does the manga say anything or help to guess what this could be? Does this have any relation with Kota?   "
3836,Does Tomura have other powers aside decay?,"Does Tomura have other powers aside decay? I mean, it doesnt make sense that he can be a powerful villain if the only power he has is decay. How could he face people who fire things from a large range, people who moves faster than a normal person, he wouldnt able to make them any damage if he can't touch them. Is he supposed to be faster than normal or something? How about resistance to attacks, does he have the resistance of a common person? "
3837,"Why if Endeavor solved more crimes than All Might, he isnt considered the number one hero?","In the anime version of My Hero Academia it's said that Endeavor solved more crimes than All Might, but he isnt considered the number one hero in spite of this. Why it is so? What does it make people to consider All Might the number one hero and not Endeavor? "
3838,Where will the Black rukh go to? Do Heaven and Hell exist?,"There are two kind of rukh in Magi universe. But first, let me explain what is rukh. SO basically, the rukh is:     Rukh is the home of souls. While we live, it is every man for them   self. But when you die, all go back to one place, This is Rukh. When   humans die, their bodies return to the earth don't they? The souls   return to Rukh, The home of souls.   And there is Black Rukh, which mean the polar opposite of Rukh. It is created when one goes against fate and tries to defy destiny. It is created from and fuels hatred and malice.   According that, we know that the true rukh at the end, will come to one place called home of souls, but what happens to Dark Rukh? Where will their souls go? Do they go to Hell or something? And what is the home of souls, is it what we would call Heaven? "
3839,What is the significance (or lack thereof) of Nausicaa's broken sword?,"I just finished reading the first volume of Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind. There was a scene that confused me in an earlier part of the book. I don't remember the page numbers.  When Princess Kushana lands her gunship in the Valley of the Wind, Nausicaa rushes in and challenges one of the soldiers to a duel (essentially). After the situation is defused by Master Yupa, Kushana asks if she can see Nausicaa's sword. Nausicaa hands over her sword, Kushana admires it for a moment and then cuts it to pieces with her own sword. There doesn't seem to be much of a reaction from Nausicaa or her people when this happens and the fact that Kushana destroyed the sword is never mentioned again.  What I don't understand is, why is the act of Kushana breaking the sword not more significant? Apparently the sword was made of ohmu shell, which is supposed to be tougher than the ceramic blades used by most soldiers (evidenced when Nausicaa chips her ceramic blade on an ohmu shell in one of the first scenes of the book). Furthermore, ohmu shell swords must be incredibly rare, considering that Kushana (who is the princess of a large empire) would be carrying an ""inferior"" ceramic blade. Wouldn't that sword be like a family heirloom or something?  The only explanation that I can think of is that the scene is purely intended to set up what a badass Kushana is and that Nausicaa is not upset because it is a small price to pay to get the Torumekian forces to leave peacefully.  Note: I have only read the first volume, which ends shortly after Asbel gets shot down by Kushana's gunship. I don't care about spoilers if you need them in your answers, so fire away. I have not watched the anime either. "
3840,Why did Strelitzia transform in Episode 15?,"In episode 15 we can see that after re-uniting with Zero Two, Hiro when connects with her      Strelizia jumps up in the air to transform into a red version of the FranXX while emitting a bright light, mid-air while transforming     Why did this sudden change in the FranXX take place?  The only possible reason I can think of is the newly mutual acceptance of each other that made this happen. Are there any canon reasons for it? "
3841,What is the song that plays at the end of episode 3 after Yuri finishes his performance?,"What is the song that plays at the end of episode 3 of Yuri!!! on Ice, when Victor calls Yuri after he finishes his performance?  It starts from 20:20 until 21:40, beginning with high-tones on the piano and flute. Then it gets upbeat with percussion and bass appearing.  Video: Official stream on Crunchyroll "
3842,Why are there no online stores that sell manga in PDF format for the English translation?,"I have bought a copy of One Piece, but I have to use some apps to read that while I have bought it with a full-priced. For example, I bought a manga online on some random online bookstore. The price for the digital version of that manga is about [tex]10.   It's understandable/acceptable for the price, with $3 different, because probably it was a cut-off from the printed cost which is come from the printed version, the digital version is print-less...  However, why do I have to read manga on some apps that were used for reading manga online? Why can they just give us, customers, the PDF version of the manga?  "
3843,"In Revolutionary Girl Utena, what's the power to revolutionize the world?","I made this question before but since a single answer won't suffice, I have broke it down into different post as suggested by other users. TL;DR: I'm tring to understand the story, not the analogies.  So, What is the power to bring revolution? Is it actual power (like the type you see in shounen animes) or is it just an analogy about making the world accept behaviors like homosexuality and incest (as seen in events related with Akio &amp; Touga or Akio &amp; Anthy)? "
3844,"How did Japonism, if at all, affect manga/anime?","While researching my own question How important was the invention of blue towards anime?, I landed relatively quickly on Hokusai, which was one of the key instigators of Japonisme.     Japonisme, is the study of Japanese art and artistic talent. Japonisme affected fine arts, sculpture, architecture, performing arts and decorative arts throughout Western culture   Although Japonisme mainly influenced the European art, it also had an effect on the Japanese art scene.   So did Japonisme also lead to, or influence the creation of manga/anime as we know it nowadays?  "
3845,Why is Luffy's smile so different in his latest wanted poster?,"I don't remember which chapter this started in, but I've noticed that his smile is not as wide as usual. It's very different from his wide, rubber-skinned smile. Now it looks more like a girl's smile in One Piece.  I know it doesn't matter much but could there be another artist besides Oda who is working on One Piece? Or could this hint to something related to a change in his stretchiness or something?   I've also noticed that he looks younger than pre-timeskip. Both of these could simply be a change in Oda's art style though.    The last poster was shown in the manga too. "
3846,Why did Arren kill his father?,This was the biggest question I had for Gorou Miyazaki's debut animated film Tales from Earthsea. Was the motivation for Arren's murder of his father ever revealed in the anime or in the original Earthsea series by Ursula K. Le Guin? Or was it just a projection of the inner feelings the director had toward his father? 
3847,"What is the source material, if any, for Sanzoku no Musume Ronja?","As the title says, I'm interested to know where the story for Ronja the Robber's Daughter came from, and if it has a source, I want to read it.  Is it based on a manga/light novel? Or is it an anime-original story? "
3848,Why are some characters shown to only eat one kind of food?,"I noticed that not only protagonists/main characters, but also other characters in an anime are shown to love a certain kind of food.  Here are some examples:   Naruto loves ramen. It's pretty much the only thing he ever really eats (as seen in Boruto where there are empty cups of instant noodles; he never leaves his office). Eiichiro Oda listed One Piece characters' favorite food, in which we all know is mentioned that Luffy loves Only meat (even in dessert). L from Deathnote  has a pronounced sweet tooth and gorges himself on various sweets.  Satellizer from Freezing really loves burgers. (Burger Queen to be precise) Shana loves melon bread just  as Ren of DearS is utterly addicted to melon bread (To the point she saves old melon bread wrappers for the smell). From what I remember Erza from Fairy Tail loves strawberry cake; when someone makes her drop it, run. Natsu loves anything that's covered in fire. Justified as it's his Power-Up Food aside from fire itself.   Why is this so? Is it relevant? Is this some kind of advertising or just a focus for a gag. "
3849,How did manga as we know it today come to be?,"While researching my own question How important was the invention of blue towards anime?, I landed relatively quickly on Hokusai. The page states that Hokusai is incorrectly considered the precedent to modern manga.     The largest of Hokusai's works is the 15-volume collection Hokusai Manga (北斎漫画), a book crammed with nearly 4,000 sketches that was published in 1814. These sketches are often incorrectly considered the precedent to modern manga, as Hokusai's Manga is a collection of sketches (of animals, people, objects, etc.), different from the story-based comic-book style of modern manga.   And considering that the first 'manga' was more art then manga as we know it these days What is the first ever produced anime and manga?  How did manga as we know it these days come to be ?  "
3850,"Why All Might had to punch over 300 times Noumu to defeat him, if it was the last ""plus ultra"" punch what sent him flying high into the sky","In the battle between Noumu and All Might, All Might says that if Noumu is made to fight him at 100%, he will have to punch him with over 100% of his strenght to defeat him, and that if Noumu's quirk is shock absortion and not regeneration, he might have a limit to how much beating he can take. After he sent Noumu flying, he said in his prime he would have needed 5 punches to defeat him, but he needed over 300. But what sent Noumu flying was only one punch, his ""plus ultra"" punch. Then, why didnt he just punched Noumu with his ""plus ultra"" punch from the begining? What were all the other punches for?  "
3851,Future Dragon Ball Super trailer analysis,"This teaser trailer linked below was in my news feed this morning as I had my coffee.   I instantly spat it out after seeing a cameo from it.  Before reading any further to my actual question please watch the video to avoid spoilers.   [website]Now, my question is: since the legendary super Saiyan appears and this is now canon, does that make Broly a canon character?? "
3852,Why is sanity a recurring theme in Haiyore Nyaruko-san?,"In several episodes, sanity is discussed by the characters. There is even a sunscreen to protect sanity from UV rays.  What is the purpose of sanity in the anime? Why is it a recurring theme? "
3853,What is Soul Eater's real name?,"In the show Soul Eater, the school which Maka and Soul Eater attend, the DWMA, allows students to go by stage names. Maka chooses to go by her real name where as Soul Eater goes by a stage name. I've been wondering what Soul Eaters actual name is for ages, and never seen it mentioned in the anime.  So what is his real name? And do we ever hear of his name in the anime, manga, or through other means?   "
3854,What is the logic behind Madara's plan A for his revival?,"Uchiha Madara's plan A for his revival was to make Uzumaki Nagato use Rinnegan's revival jutsu (Gedo Rinnei Tensei no Jutsu). However, when Nagato used this jutsu to revive everyone in Konoha, he mentioned that he cannot revive everyone. He can only revive those that only recently killed as shown in the picture below.    Another version of the translation is more clear in that there is a time limit to how long someone can die before he is brought back to life using this jutsu.    Which means that if one died long time ago, it would be impossible to brought back using this jutsu. This also fits the fact that he didn't use the jutsu to revive Yahiko. Because he can't.  After he used it, everyone was revived to the state right before they died.    Madara died of old age. If Nagato revived him using that jutsu, wouldn't Madara be revived as the old Madara that's about to die? Is this a miss on Madara's part? What is the logic behind Madara's revival plan? Why do Madara think that his plan A is a perfect plan (or the better plan), as shown when he complained to Obito about being brought back to life using Edo Tensei? "
3855,End of Evangelion - Why does Misato dissolve into LCL and why did Asuka re-materialize?,"These thoughts keep me awake at night:  After Misato is shot in the back while helping Shinji get to Unit 01- the elevator closes, she falls over, talks to herself/the deceased Kaji, Rei/Lilith/Adam appears above Misato and then there is an explosion. But if the frame is paused at the right moment- you can see her body is in two separate pieces- however later there is a shot with her jacket in a puddle of LCL. Video for reference: [website]I'm confused because one of the SEELE guys seemed very determined to remain alive until instrumentality occurred- He grins happily right before dissolving into LCL- and in the puddle of his LCL, his clothes and what looks like to be many medical devices that were keeping him alive into old age remains. From what I understand- during instrumentality, only living things dissolved into LCL (So SEELE guy had all the medical devices, Kaji didn't dissolve, etc). So I'm wondering why Misato dissolved into LCL because it looks like the explosion killed her. I'm guessing it's possible that her jacket is just in a random puddle of LCL and she didn't actually dissolve- and her body could be off-screen.  As far as Asuka goes- at the end, her and Shinji re-materialize from the LCL as they will to. But she was killed by the mass-production eva units. I would assume that she also did not dissolve into LCL but then why did Asuka re-materialize if she was not a part of instrumentality?  I realize the director, Hideaki Anno, says there are no ""right answers"" to the meaning of the movie but I am wondering if there are any clarifications to these questions. And please correct me if I'm incorrect on any of the above because I'm sure I have a few misunderstandings :)  EDIT: Defined my questions in bold and video reference added "
3856,What is the significance of the lottery box in Yuru Yuri Nachuyachumi! OVA? And why are some of the words crossed out?,"In Yuru Yuri Nachuyachumi!, in the scene where the girls draw lots from the lottery box, the lottery box is shown with some characters crossed out:    Searching for めだちた leads me to the dictionary entry for 【目{め}立{だ}ちたがり屋{や}】, which means ""attention seeker"". However, it feels a bit out of whack here.  What is the significance of this box? And why are the words crossed out? "

3858,Why is Utena able to beat other duelists?,"Every duelist is an expert on a different sword art (kendo, fencing, etc.), but Utena isn't, so she shouldn't be able to beat them.  That being said, there's the prince's image that falls from the castle into her, before she wins. Is that image why Utena can beat the other duelists? If so, what is the explanation for that image? "
3859,Is Hawk Wandle's Reincarnation?,"Hawk has the same clover-shaped mark as Wandle did. Also, their personalities are rather similar, causing Meliodas to mistake Hawk for Wandle. They both have a strong passion for something (Wandle: shiny things, Hawk: scraps), get annoyed by certain habits that Meliodas has (Wandle: littering, Hawk: doing perverted things to Elizabeth), and are talking animals. While a talking parrot isn't completely abnormal, a talking pig is (many people ask Hawk why he can talk). In addition, Wandle and Hawk are the only talking animals we see. Also, Hawk mentions that he has a weird feeling that he used to fly in a previous life (Wandle?)  Combining, all of these facts, I've come to the conclusion that the Demon King used both Wandle and Hawk to keep an eye on Meliodas, and that Hawk is Wandle's reincarnation. Is there any real proof of this, or are we just limited to clues(obvious clues, but they're still clues)? Is it ever explicitly stated that this is true? "
3860,What exactly happened when a person passed on?,"After watching the final episode of Angel Beats, I saw that, after the credits,      both Otonashi and Angel found each other again after being ""reincarnated"".    But is that all that happened when everyone passed on? Did they just lose their memory and get reincarnated as a human with a similar look? "

3862,What are the differences between the Totoro releases?,"I know that My Neighbor Totoro was released at least twice (possible three times because of some sort of airplane release) in the United States. I'm pretty sure that at there was at least a cast change between the two major US releases, but are there any other changes? Was anything censored or was any animation or lines changed? "
3863,What is the harpsichord music being played at the school?,"In episode 5 of Flip Flappers, Papika and Cocona end up in what Yayaka later reveals to be a day-long time loop. (This does not come as a surprise: prior to the announcement, we see Papika and Cocona repeat what is implied to the exact same routine every day, and the doll whose head Cocona moves in the evening always faces its original direction in the morning.)  One of the events of this repeated day is a music lesson: Papika and Cocona sit in a circle with some other students around some candles, and two students are playing a keyboard instrument. In the background, harpsichord music starts playing and runs until the bedroom scene. This occurs in each instance of the routine (music, library, tea, embroidery) that we see prior to Yayaka's confrontation with Cocona.  What is the music being played? (If it is an original composition for the anime, is there a track title that someone can point me to? If it isn't, what is the title and composer of the excerpted piece?) "
3864,What are the processes involved betwen job submission and rewards?,"According to Fairy Tail Wiki, there are different types of jobs with different levels of difficulty. From my understanding, any guild member can apply for the job and gets permission according to their level. There are some exceptions where the client ask for specific candidate(s), like in the case of Warrod Sequen. Marijane seems to be involved in job processing.  So I want to know the details on how the jobs are processed - from the moment the client submits the job to when the client rewards for job completion. If there are any other processes that are not mention below, feel free to add them to the list.   Are jobs submitted to every guild as advertisement or only to a specific Guild? Is every job accepted by guild? And who is responsible for this? Who is responsible for assigning the ranks of the jobs and giving permission to guild members to take the job if requested? How does the payment work after the jobs are completed? What happens when the mission fails?   If different guilds have different processes, then please use Fairy Tail guild as example. "
3865,(Spoiler) Did All for one give his ability to Tomura?,"In My Hero Academia, after the Showdown between All for One and all might, One for all is finally defeated.  But when he was arrested, All for One said the words :     As a teacher, I win, as my pupil is ready. (paraphrasing)   While it most certainly concerns the growth of Tomura, both as a leader, and as a villain, I am left wondering if it implied something more.   Did All for One pass on his ability to Tomura, the same All Might passed his ability to Izuku ?   We already know that All for One is able to give and take other's ability at will, I don't think it would be far fetched to think that this could apply to All for One itself.  On a story viewpoint, it would make Tomura a much stronger foe, and make him even more of a parallel to Izuku.  So, did Tomura inherit from All for One ? (is there any specification, from Canon, or author, hinting or stating that he did/did not ?) "
3866,Why Katsuki Bakugo was so mean with Midoriya when he didnt have any quirk?,"When a child, Midoriya didnt have any quirk. And at some point he considered Bakugo his friend. Why then Katsuki Bakugo felt threatened by Midoriya? This makes sense when Midoriya already had the One for All quirk and could be an obstacle for Bakugo to become the greatest hero (which is Bakugo's goal), but I can't understand why Bakugo was so mean to Midoriya when he was quirkless. Is there any explanation about this? "

3868,How old is Conan meant to be?,"I was rewatching an old episode of Detective Conan with a friend and we started discussing how weird it would be to hear a young child say some of the things Conan says. Then, I realized I didn't know the exact age that Conan was really supposed to be acting. I don't recall Conan's age to ever be mentioned in the show. How old is Conan supposed to be now? What was his age before he shrank? "
3869,Who is the first school idol group ever featured in anime?,"In the Love Live! series, UTX High School's A-RISE is the first school idol group featured. But, is A-RISE the first school idol group ever featured in the history of anime? If not, who is the first school idol group? "
3870,Why does Pokemon have a six Pokemon limit?,"I was wondering why is there a limit?  Why does everyone follow it in the anime?  Even Team Rocket follows it, even though they are a criminal organization that steals trainers' Pokemon. Just because there is a custom in place, doesn't mean people have to follow it.  Is it discussed or shown in the anime? "
3871,Do people still travel to and from Vers after Heaven's Fall?,"The lunar hypergate that was destroyed 15 years ago during Heaven's Fall was said to strand the Vers Knights on the Earth Orbit.  It is improbable that there are no unmanned ships ferrying supplies to the Vers homeworld (Mars) and parting from the Vers foundries to the frontline (Earth orbit).  But given the scale of space technology, it is not unthinkable that some people (commoners) would not travel several months to get from Earth orbit to Vers (Mars).   That the nobles of Vers think themselves as stranded on the orbit because they would not submit themselves to this arduous trip, OK.  But do people still travel to and from Vers after Heaven's Fall? Is there some reference from the canon material? "

3879,Reason for kanji and reading in 頂の座 Hecate,"Character of Shakugan no Shana, Hecate, has a title of 頂の座, which is supposed to be read いただき・の・くら (and is pronounced as such in anime) being translated as ""Master/Supreme Throne"". Info about about readings and meanings was checked with / found on Jisho.org  While 座 has similar meanings (seat/place/status/pedestal) and is also used in a compound for throne (王座) it has no reading くら and くら does not mean ""a throne"" (saddle/warehouse/treasury/contest). That said, there's a word for throne 位 with strikingly similar reading くらい.  Is it a play on something? Is it really switch between 座 and 位 (and would the くらい -> くら change signify something) or just an undocumented reading of 座? (does not have to be an official explanation)  Maybe maybe even 頂 plays a role here? 頂 also means to ""receive"" and if くら means a ""depository; treasury"" maybe it can be a play on the - allegedly she's somewhat different in anime vs manga, but at least in the anime iirc she seemed to be sort of a shell/container (くら) yearning for receiving (頂) experience/emotions? Just a brainstorming "
3880,How different are the anime and manga versions of Akame Ga Kill?,"Okay, so I watched all of the Akame Ga Kill anime. My question is should I start reading Akame Ga Kiru (the manga) from the beginning or continue from where they split?  I saw on another post that they split around approximately chapter 48. I understand that the overall plot is similar up until that point, but if there are additional characters or skipped over mini-archs then I want to go back and read it all.  If the anime is completely accurate until chapter 48 then I will just start there.  Anyone know the answer to this? (Please no spoilers from anywhere after the anime splits off) "
3881,How were Sakura's release sequences made?,"In Cardcaptor Sakura, there's something akin to a transformation sequence where Sakura calls upon the power of the key, and it turns into the staff and she twirls it like a baton. Here's a piece of it:    You can see the full sequence I'm talking about in this YouTube video. It also goes on to show the same sequence in many languages.  Normally I'd expect transformations like that to be made once and just reused as necessary since (AFAIK) magical girls usually transform into the same outfits. But in Sakura's case, she stays in whatever she's already wearing, so it could be pajamas, a school uniform, casual clothes, or whatever crazy outfit Tomoyo designs for her.  I'm very curious about how this is done. The magic effects and shots of the key could be reused, but Sakura's motions look extremely similar each time despite the change in clothing. It's not a long sequence, but it still looks nice, and I can't imagine it was easy (or cheap) to continually produce new ones with different outfits.  How were these scenes made? "
3882,How did Minori and co. get back to Akiba at the end of S2E21?,"Towards the end of season 2, episode 21 of Log Horizon, as Minori and the rest of the gang are walking home after getting some wyvern skins, they run into Nyanta, who ""happens"" to be flying by on a griffon. In the next scene, everybody is back in Akiba.  But how did they get back? Don't griffons only have a capacity of 2 riders? Did Nyanta make multiple trips, maybe? "

(letting out all the half way transformations, ie, false super saiyan , ultra super saiyan , etc. for simplicity)  Base &lt; Super Saiyan &lt; Super Saiyan 2 &lt; Super Saiyan 3   Where do the new transformations fit in this power scale showed above?

3886,OST Name used in Episode 18 Gundam Build Fighter Try,"In episode 18 of Gundam Build Fighter Try, the music starts from 12:44 (maybe? I'm not sure, correct me if I'm wrong) to 14:46.  I've been searching the whole YouTube, internet, and SoundCloud but won't get an easy hand on it.  Somehow, Sunrise like to use the old OST from GBF to GBFT, so I assume it's an old OST from GBF instead of GBFT (cause I have a full set of GBFT OST)  Here is the link to the episode on the official Gundam channel. "
3887,What are the markings used above some song lyrics?,"I believe lyrics are shown to both the first opening and ending songs of the tennis anime, Baby Steps. Here is a partial shot from the ending:    You can see that the normal credits are single rows of characters.  However, the lyrics at the bottom include a row of a few mini-characters above the main ones. What do these additional markings (characters?) indicate?  I am not asking for a translation, just what their purpose is.  I vaguely remember seeing them in another series or two, but this is the first time they really caught my curiosity. I'm assuming right now that they are related to the music, perhaps how the song may have modified pronunciation of certain words. It appears too sparse to be some sort of full musical notation. There is only one voice in each song, so it is not the simultaneous words of a second singer.  In the English Wikipedia there is an article called Shakuhachi Musical Notation related to Japanese music. It did not seem to help, though I don't know much about the topic. (I.e. I didn't see any pictures showing the double-row lyric thing.) "
3888,How similar is the Magi anime to the manga?,"I know some anime counterparts of manga are extremely different while others are so similar they nearly go panel-by-panel. I've watched the Magi anime (labyrinth and kingdom of magic) and would like to read the manga to see what comes next. My question: How close is the manga to the anime? Is it different enough that I should read the manga from the beginning or could I start off where the anime left off? And if I could start off where the anime left off, about what chapter would that be? :D Thanks so much in advance~! "

3892,What does the number of key animators and inbetweeners depend on?,"As I watch more anime I kind of noticed this: some ok-looking shows have a lot of animators while other really good-looking shows don't.  For example, Violet Evergarden and Sora yori mo Tooi Basho are two shows from Winter 2018, and the number of key animators and inbetweeners differ so much.  Violet Evergarden Episode 1:     9 key animators + 4 inbetweeners  Sora yori mo Tooi Basho Episode 1:     28 key animators + 14 inbetweeners  Why does Violet Evergarden have so few key animators and yet is so gorgeous looking? Sora yori mo Tooi Basho on the other hand, has simpler character designs and visuals. Wouldn't the latter take fewer people to draw? What could be possible reasons for this? "
3893,"What is the significance of the title ""Usagi drop""?","I was wondering what was the meaning of the tile Usagi drop: literally it means ""Bunny drop"", but how is it related to the story? Is there some reference to somethings or is there some pun involved? "
3894,"Is ""The Best Meat Buns"" a double entendre in Japanese?","Here is a shot from Baby Steps, episode 20 at time mark 16:46:    I think ""The Best Meat Buns"" is the English translation of the sign Nat-chan is wearing on her back. She is considered one of the prettiest and most popular girls in her high school. She is wearing a maid-cafe outfit for the cultural festival, and her group is selling meat buns. In English the sign is an obvious double entendre. What is the literal translation of the sign? Would Japanese folks see it as a double entendre too?  (Maybe in Japan, ""buns"" just means buns.)  I think if it is a Japanese double entendre, Nat-chan would be in on the joke. She is not portrayed as just a clueless girl. "
3895,Why are Rin's classmates afraid of him in the first episode of Kyoto Fujouou-hen?,"The first season of Blue Exorcist ended with Rin lauded by his friends.

And that the types of power that a human can have varies- Chad, Orihime, the Fullbringers, whatever was going on with Ururu and Jinta. So why is it that beyond seeing ghosts, only Quincy/Shinigami powers seem to get passed on from generation to generation?  Beyond the whole ""Karakura is the setting"" thing, why do we not even hear about this being possible?

And in the last episode of My Hero Academia (Season 3, Episode 4)      Midoriya punchs muscular with One for All 1,000,000%    Does this mean One for All give unlimited power?

3898,How big would the One Piece planet/universe be if looked from outer space?,"Since I don't read the manga and I can't remember a lot of it, maybe someone who has more extensive knowledge/understanding of One Piece world can have a rough estimate of how big the universe/planet/ocean is, I'm just curious because all that sea and island being wide apart and we haven't even got to half (or quarter) of it (I guess?).  Would the One Piece planet look similar to earth's size? Or is it more comparable to Jupiter, for example? "
3899,Are all of the interactions between Angelina and Belle covered in the Angelina Ending?,"I've been following this walkthrough for Katahane, and I'm do the Angelina Ending, because I brought the game purely to see the romance between Angelina and Belle, however I do plan to get the Wakaba and Coco Endings after (since I'm a completionist).  Are all of the interactions between Angelina and Belle covered in the Angelina Ending? Are there any scenes between them that only viewable in Wakaba's and Coco's Routes?  EDIT: After completing what i think is the Angelina Ending it seems to end abruptly and the Wakaba ending seems to have more of a conclusion to Angelina and Belle, i still got to get the Coco Ending just to check but it seems that maybe the walk through might be lacking with the Angelina ending, also, my friend who made the censor patch said that there are 3 Angelina x Belle H Scenes and the logs state that it's only blocked 2 which she finds strange so she's right now looking though her code just to see if the censor patch blocked and entire section but didn't log it "

In Eastern countries, all animation are thought of as anime.   So this question kind of leads to what is an anime? Does having a published manga a requirement to become an anime?

And recently a tweet was made by a Dragon Ball Super writer saying he's expecting a new form    "
3906,How did Zeff really lose his leg?,"So far, I have 2 versions of how Zeff lost his leg in the past,  1. Manga Version, Zeff ate his own leg to survive.    2. Anime Version, Zeff's foot got stuck in an anchor when saving Sanji underwater. And he never said he ate his own leg.  Note: The flashback is on 18:00 - 20:00 or something.  Look, I know that in One Piece Anime and Manga versions usually tell the same story. (e.g. Like when Dragon saved Sabo is almost obvious in Anime than in Manga).  Any idea guys? "
3907,Why do the racoons in pompoko have such large genitalia?,"I was surprised when I saw, watching PomPoko with my family, that the characters had really, REALLY large ahem ... well see for yourself:    I mean, that can't be natural can it? I'm pretty sure last time I saw a racoon it didn't have that part so huge.   Is it perhaps some other body part? You can see their tails in the below picture as they use the flesh for parachutes, so I'm sure it's not that. It does seem to be coming from their nether regions though.  What is up with these racoons?   "
3908,Is episode 12.5 in Durarara a filler?,"I am following the anime through EpisodeCalendar and there is no episode 12.5. Is this episode a filler or part of the original story? (That is, would I miss any part of the story if I skipped this episode?) "
3909,"If Kurama is the living embodiment of hatred, then what about the other Tailed Beasts?","If Kurama is really the living embodiment of hatred (not some self proclaim title), then what about the other Tailed Beasts? Are they the embodiment of something else? "
3910,What happens to the human inside the titan when the titan dies?,"Just to be clear I'm NOT talking about those who where swallowed.       We know that titans used to be humans and then somehow they transformed into titans.   When they kill a titan it completely Vaporizes and nothing is left. So what happens to the human inside them?     Could it be like when Eren was testing his limits and each time he fused more with the titan body? If so, why could Ymir live in titan form for over 60 years and still transform back into human?  "
3911,Why does Mars propose Ishimoto to call her Mottie?,"In the second episode of the first season, at the beginning of the episode, when Mars calls Ishimoto ""Isshie"", there is the following conversation :     Ishimoto : Isshie? Really?      Mars : Would you prefer Mottie?      Ishimoto : Isshie please.     I get that Isshie is the diminutive of Ishimoto, but I do not get why he would call her Mottie.  Why does Mars propose to call her Mottie and why is Ishimoto reacting that way? "
3912,Why didn't Goku and Chi Chi use the Dragon Balls to rescue the Ox King and his castle?,"At the end of Dragon Ball, when Goku and Chi Chi were questing to find the Bansho Fan to put out the fire trapping the Ox King, it seems as if they could have used the Dragon Balls to do it quickly. More than one year had passed since their previous usage and, as far as I could tell, the balls were not scattered after wishing Krillin and the others back to life (they remained on the ground at the Kame House after the wish).  So, it seems like they could have quickly made a wish to stop the flames and restore the castle. Why did they not do so? I did not read the manga, I only watched the anime. Was there a specific reason that either I missed, or that was perhaps stated in the manga, or was it simply a plot device to fill the last few episodes of the series? "
3913,"""Preview"" images in anime OPs","Some anime OPs have small pieces of future episodes in them. How do they include these?  Do the drawers create these segments before everything else then when they create the actual episodes they simply include them, or do they create every episode in advance and only air them after they're done? "
3914,How does Sanji produce fire in Water?,"As you know, Sanji has a move called Diable Jamble, where he somehow manages to generate fire on his leg by rotating with great speed.  We have seen this move first when he was fighting CP9.  According to science, fire can be generated by friction, but it should be spontaneous. This explains as to how he was able to generate while he was fighting CP9 at Enies Lobby.  But after the timeskip, when the Straw Hat Pirates were on their way to Fishman Island, they encountered a Kraken. How did Sanji generate fire in water?  In water, there is no rough material via which, fire can be generated.  And even if it is somehow achieved, how can the fire not get extinguished by the water!?   "
3915,Is there a Sword Art Online/Accel World crossover?,"Are there any crossovers of SAO and Accel World? Anime, manga, light-novel, anything?  I saw this image a long time ago somewhere:    And I read about a possible crossover between the two. Does anyone know if it has aired yet or will be? And where I can find the episodes/chapters or find more information? "
3916,Can someone please explain the ending of Shiki?,Did the whole village get burned down? How about the girl? The whole thing seems quite incomplete to me. Can someone explain the ending? 
3917,Why is Smith's wall clock open at night?,"Episode 13 of March Comes in Like a Lion includes an extended sequence focused on the side character named ""Smith"". At around time mark 4:20 we see him get up in the morning and go through some of his morning ritual. One of the things he does is close the door on the face of his wall clock.    Does anyone know why the door is even open? I saw no context concerning this. He gets out of bed and closes the clock door -- that's it, apparently very routine. Is leaving a wall clock door open something that a Japanese person could relate to? His morning routine is quirky and a bit funny. Maybe this is just part of Smith's own quirkiness.  This may or may not be significant -- I did not fully understand what they were saying, but I've read two comments to YouTube reviews of this series that implied that the sequence of him eating breakfast was a parody from an old Japanese series. (They didn't say live action or anime.) They only referred to the breakfast-eating, which occurred after, and did not mention anything about a clock.  /edit add 2 hours after original post  I just watched episode 14, and then a review of it. The reviewer provided a link to a 2-minute side-by-side comparison of Smith's breakfast and the live action drama it was parodying. It was funny and included the original guy getting up and closing the face of his wall clock. My question doesn't go away, though. Is there something Japanese people can relate to in getting out of bed and shutting the door of your wall clock?  If it matters, the original drama is called Kizu darake no tenshi (1974). The music in the video switches from the drama to the anime and back. A speaker symbol will be below the source of the music currently playing. "
3918,"Why is ""bioroide/bioroido/bioroid"" used in different animes?","In the 1984 anime series Super Dimensional Calvary Southern Cross, there are some alien mechas called ""bioroid/bioroido/bioloyd"" (depending on the translation) Bioroids SDC. In Appleseed there is an artificial species called bioroide Appleseed Bioroid. And apparently in this anime I don't know Armitage III there is also a song called Bioroid so I assume there is something called Bioroid in this anime. Where does this word come from? Does it come from anime, does it come from japanese or does it come from sci-fi? Personally I've only heard it in japanese animes.  "
3919,Are Elric brothers good at electronics?,"There is at least one situation per Elric brother, when they have fixed radio device - e.g. Edward fixed transmitter sg. Fuery was working on, and Alphonse fixed broken radio in Reole (Liore?).  One of the principles of the alchemy is that if you want to create some thing, you should know how it works. Which leads me to conclusion, that both Elric brothers should have some education in terms of electronic devices, and radio technology.  Is there any additional information on this in anime/manga etc? "
3920,"In episode 2 why is baka captioned with ""Dick Suck""?","In Episode 2, Zapp Renfro gets an introduction screen which captions 馬鹿 and バカ as ""Dick Suck"". At first, I thought this was a troll caption, but it appears in official releases such as the Funimation! stream.     Does anyone know why this was captioned this way? Possibly a reason/joke in the anime?   "
3921,Why does Lupin III refer to Inspector Zenigata as To-chan?,"I have started watching the Lupin III TV series and I am partway through the second series. One thing I am confused about is why Lupin refers to Zenigata as To-chan? I thought ""To"" meant father and ""chan"" was a postfix for young girls or women. What does this nickname mean, and why does Lupin use it? "
3922,Why does Rin have cat-ears?,"In the Little Busters!-anime, Rin sometime has cat-ears for a very short time (mostly only a split second). Is it used to show a character trait? What does it mean?  Here's an image of it:   "
3923,Why does no one remember Gildartz?,"During the Battle of Fairy Tail, no one mentions the S-Class wizard, Gildartz, when suggesting who is the strongest. Why does no one remember him? Do they assume that he would be on a mission that would take too long, and would take perfect timing for him to show up? "
3924,"Hilarious, but is it a ""burger""?","The team is eating breakfast at cycling camp in Yowamush Pedal episode 13, beginning at about time mark 2:45. We see the MC Onoda eating:    One of his third year senpai, Tadokoro, sees this, and isn't having it:     Hey now! What are you eating?!   Is that a snack? It's so little!   You have to eat more!   You'll drop out after the second day!   I'll share my Tadokoro Bakery Tadokoro Special Burger with you.         [A Tadokoro Bakery food truck had just been shown. I don't know if it is related to the character's family.]        Don't hold back. Eat.   (Onoda): There's no way!   In addition to the over-the-top (I assume) hilarity 😆, the word burger stood out. Is that a poor translation of the Japanese word for sandwich? Or maybe they are the same word in Japanese? (There is a long-running (since 1930) American comic strip named Blondie, and her husband is named Dagwood. Since he loves huge, multi-layered sandwiches such as these, they were known as Dagwood sandwiches. I'm not sure that term is still known generally, though.)  The scene takes place during the second day of their camp. Each team member must ride 1000 km over the course of four days. I realize they will be burning calories like crazy, but -- geez! "
3925,Why are almost all anime episodes 20 minutes long?,"Why are all animes around 20 minutes long? Sometimes less or more due to the opening and ending, and some recap from last episodes...etc, but it's always around 20 minutes.  Why is that? "
3926,Does CCG Know that Haise Sasaki is Actually Ken Kaneki?,"I just started the 3rd season, but I read the wiki, and I was curious.... Didn't CCG capture Kaneki and got the idea for the Quinx because of him? Then why did they let ""Eyepatch"" join the CCG as an investor (and gave him such a high status, too)? I know for a fact that CCG knows that he is a ghoul, so doesn't that mean they know that he's Kaneki? "
3927,How do the different media for No. 6 fit in with each other?,"During the Fall 2016 season, I chanced upon an off-hand comment somewhere on Reddit about the different adaptations of No. 6. If my memory serves me, the user argued that there was a discrepancy between the anime adaptation of No. 6 and the original light novels in how a certain plot point (possibly a relationship between two characters) was approached.  Furthermore, at some point before that, I saw someone mention in passing that she disliked the anime adaptation but enjoyed the manga and light novel, which suggests to me in retrospect that there are notable differences between the different adaptations of the underlying content.  At the time, I did not pay heed to any of this, since I had no interest in No. 6. Unfortunately, over the last month or two, I have seen a couple stills from the No. 6 manga that piqued my interest. Since I would like to know how to approach to series (via the manga, or via the anime) if I ever get to it, I am now wondering if there are any notable differences between the original light novels, the manga, and the anime, and if so, what the nature of these differences is:   Are there major differences in plot points, similar to how there are differences in plot between the two different anime associated with Fullmetal Alchemist or between the anime and manga for Elfen Lied? Alternatively, are there obvious discrepancies with framing or focus or tone? (For instance, the Revolutionary Girl Utena manga feels more grounded in reality than the anime, and concepts such as ""revolutionizing the world"" are more clearly fleshed out there. However the basic structure of the manga matches that of the anime, although the anime has an expanded plot, pairs Juri with Shiori instead of Touga, etc.)  "
3928,How does online anime streaming work within Japan?,"One of the main ways people in the United States watch anime these days is to stream it online via a streaming service like Crunchyroll or Hulu.  Is the online streaming of anime in Japan as popular as it is in America? I know that the Japanese music industry tries really hard to keep its works off the Internet as much as possible, and they try to get customers to buy physical CDs instead. Is there a similar impact on anime streaming where the anime industry tries to avoid streaming and opt for physical DVDs, Blu-rays, etc. in its domestic domain instead?  Also, most of the time in America, the subbed Japanese version is available for free viewing for anybody.  Do Japanese viewers have to pay in order to stream anime in Japanese? My guess is no, because I wouldn't see why Japanese viewers would be charged to view anime in Japanese when U.S. viewers get to stream anime in Japanese for free. "
3929,What is the source of Sanji's flame power?,"I recently came up with a theory that Sanji might get a power because all his siblings did, even though he was called a dud. I was then watching One Piece Film: Gold and remembered how his flames didn't make any sense. Could his flames have come from his father's experiments?  He did say in Enies Lobby that he got heated up when he was mad and his powers related to fire keep growing a bit stronger than friction should be able to make. His siblings had powers similar to devil fruit users, so the more powerful Sanji's flames become, the less I believe it is natural (by natural I mean through Haki and friction).  What do you think?  "
3930,What happens to Mr 3?,"As everyone knows that Mr 3 had helped Luffy to release Ace from the Kairoseki handcuffs by using his wax power. Once they were free, Luffy catches hold of Mr 3 and they move down towards the ground.     As you can see, the three of them in the pic. But what happened to Mr 3 when Luffy and Ace started getting back to the harbour? Was he captured or killed? Have I missed something here? "
3931,Can Katsuki Bakugo fly as much as he wants with his explosion quirk?,"In My Hero Academia, we see several times Bakugo using his explosion quirk to lift himself to mid-air and fly to increase his speed. How much can he uses this technique to fly? Can he fly as much as he wants or is he limited to fly a few metres above the ground? "
3932,Was Vegeta's design altered mid series?,"When we first see Vegeta, while he is in space headed to Earth and on the Bug Planet he looks like this    But when he gets to earth he undertakes a sudden colour change to this    Now at first since Vegeta is initially off world i though that maybe it might have been the local suns had a different colour light to Earth's, but then that wouldn't explain why his scouter would remain the same colour.  I am wondering, is Vegeta's colour change a result of his design changing mid series? or is there a reason why everything but his scouter changes colour when he arrives on Earth? "
3933,Which animation style is used in Kingdom?,I've been watching Kingdom and Kingdom: Season 2 for a while now and I can't help but be a bit distracted by how differently it is animated compared to most anime these days.  Which animation style is used to achieve this more 3D-like feeling? And why did they pick this over the usual animation style?   
3934,What is a Tokyo Raven?,"I don't recall the title of Tokyo Ravens being explained over the course of the anime (though it's possible I missed something). Other than the Raven Coat, I don't remember any particular references to ravens. Where does the term Tokyo Raven come from and what does it mean? Is there a historical basis for it or is it something the author made up? Is it explained in the light novels? "
3935,What exactly are Haibane in the anime Haibane Renmei? Are they angels?,What is the origin of Haibane? Where do the Haibane come from? A cocoon but where does the cocoon choose to appear?  
3936,What happened to Dr. Cid in Giruvegan?,"In Final Fantasy XII We know that Doctor Cidolfus Demen Bunansa (AKA Dr. Cid) found The Ancient City of Giruvegan where he met Venat, learned how the Occuria control the world by selectively distributing Deifacted Nethicite to control historic events and formed a partnership to ""return the reigns of history back to the hands of man"".  However for Vann and his party to enter Giruvegan they needed to summon Belias, as Esper they only obtained from Raithwall's Tomb having been King Raithwall's esper, i doubt Dr. Cid found the entrance to Giruvegan, went to the tomb to grab Belias and put him back after he opened it. i also doubt that Occuria would let Venat roam around Giruvegan on it's own given they know Venat knows what they know and is opposed to them.  So what happened to Dr. Cid in Giruvegan? How did he get in? why didn't the Occuria try and stop Dr. Cid and Venat from leaving? "
3937,Why the Survey Corps doesn't find a human body inside normal titan?,"Hange cut the neck of one titan to explore inside. Why couldn't she find out the main human body inside???  Maybe the main body was hidden quite deep so it was difficult to see. But if it was hidden quite deep, then how can Levi and other soldiers cut down the neck and kill the titan.  Is this a logical flaw in AOT? "
3938,How does wind chakra amplify water style?,"So in Naruto, wind chakra is strong against electric and weak against fire as it amplifies the fire.   But at the same time, when naruto does the Toad-water-pistol collaboration ninjutsu with the frogs, his wind style amplifies water style..how is that possible?  Doesn't wind style amplify fire? Then how come its amplifying water too? Wind and water aren't related in the chakra relation circle thing.. "
3939,What happens to King Torture's soldiers once defeated?,"King Torture's monsters always have some soldiers alongside them.    When the monsters are defeated, they scream ""Viva Torture!"" and explode. The soldiers, however, have been seen lying defeated on the floor even after a monster's explosion:    Do they also explode and vanish after being defeated? Or have they been being taken into custody for questioning or something of the sort? Or are they somehow able to get away? "
3940,Why did Ash became a child back in Sun Moon Series?,"I was watching Pokemon Sun Moon and I think its a continuation because he knows about Pokemon from other regions.  But the question is that why did he became a small kid, from a young guy, who challenged Alain in Kalos League Finals?  He nearly won the match so why did he need to go to Pokemon School?  "
3941,Is the girl waiting at the train station in Spirited Away from Grave of the Fireflies?,"Chihiro was traveling by train to the sixth station in Spirited Away (YouTube video). When the train passed the second station, there was a little girl waiting at the station.    Out of curiosity, I visited Google for some hints and was surprised to see some people say that the little girl's name is Setsuko from Grave of the Fireflies. She was waiting for her older brother.  Is the girl waiting at the train station in Spirited Away, Setsuko from Grave of the Fireflies? "
3942,Why doesn't the Gedo Mazo have tails?,"If the Gedo Mazo is the emptied body of the Ten-Tails, then why don't any of its forms look like that?   I have a theory as to why it doesn't have tails, maybe because its chakra was split into the Tailed Beasts and hence it lost its tails. But it still doesn't explain why none of the forms look like that considering that the Gedo Mazo is the way the body looked when Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki, the Sage of the Six Paths, sealed its empty body inside the moon with Chibaku Tensei (Planetary Devastation).  Any ideas as to why this might be? "
3943,Can any other saiyan attain Super Saiyan Rage?,"Trunks's new transformation, also known as ""Super Saiyan Rage"" has only been achieved by him. Neither Goku, Vegeta or Gohan has achieved it. We don't know much what it's required to acquire this transformation, one of the requirements seems to be being extremely furious, but this doesnt seem to be the only one. Gokú was very furious when in Super Saiyan Blue he was told Chichi and Gotenk were killed in another dimesion, he had an increase in power but he didnt transform into Super Saiyan Rage. Gohan had been many times very furious, particulary the time when he already had acquired the super saiyan 2 level, when Spopovich almost kills Videl, he didnt turn into Super Saiyan Rage. And particulary Vegeta, when he was already a Super Saiyan 2, and Beerus slaps Bulma, he was so furious than when being in Super Saiyan 2 it is said by others (Roshi, Beerus, etc) that he surpassed the power of Goku's super saiyan 3, but he didnt become super saiyan rage. What does this mean then? Can any other saiyan become super saiyan rage?   "

3945,Why is One Punch Man considered a parody anime?,"I checked the synopsis here and I was wondering about the genre of parody.    I’ve completed the season of One Punch Man and there was no parody of anything in the animé. The only parody animé I’ve experienced before is Gintama and the parody is altogether at another level! Whereas, One Punch Man had relatively none. Am I missing something or is it an error? "

3948,How was the Ten Tails actually separated?,"As we know about the Ten Tails.      Hagoromo separated the monster's chakra from its body before using  Chibaku Tensei to seal the husk in what would become the moon. From  there, the Sage used his Creation of All Things ability to divide the  chakra into the nine tailed beasts.   Now what my question is, How was it divided?  If we count the total number of tails. Shukaku  -  1 Tail Matatabi -  2 Tails Isobu    -  3 Tails Son Goku -  4 Tails Kokuo    -  5 Tails Saiken   -  6 Tails Chomei   -  7 Tails Gyuki    -  8 Tails Kurama   -  9 Tails -------------------- Total    -  45 Tails  I'm kinda curios, that the Juubi had 10 tails in total, so how was it divided? "
3949,Future Lucy's right hand?,"In the manga, we see that future Lucy has no longer her right arm, but no context is given about how she lost it.  Does it has anything to do with Natsu of that timeline to be killed by a dragon ? How did she lose her right arm ? "

3952,How does a Titan form or regenerate when injured?,   Where does the muscle and bone to form a titan come from; or is it generated by the titan shifters themselves? If so how? And what are the golden lines when shifters like Armin transform? 
3953,Is the identity of Rin's father confirmed?,"In the beginning of the anime we're lead to believe that Daikichi's grandfather and this Masako woman are Rin's parents.  During the anime they confirm that Masako is Rin's mother, but they leave the father's identity up in the air. If Daikichi's grandfather was Rin's father, he would have had to taken part in her conception at 73 years old - not impossible, but it's still a stretch.  Is Daikichi's grandfather really Rin's father? Is this revealed in the manga? "
3954,What are the Lost Logia?,"In Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha Season 1, Yuuno says that the Lost Logia are remnants of advance civilizations that have since been destroyed, but in Season 3 during Hayate and Fate's briefing on the relic they seem to imply that the Lost Logia come from a single civilization (Al Hazard maybe?)  So I am wondering, what exactly are the Lost Logia? "

"
3956,Is there a reason for the child of Maria and Mamoru to be called Messiah?,"So the official name for the child of Maria and Mamoru is 救世主 (Kyūseishu), which basically means ""savior"" or ""the Messiah""... It is unusual (and ironic) for a character to be called like that -- especially when she(he?) is pretty much the biggest threat for humanity at that time. Why Messiah among all names? Is there a reason for this? "
3957,Why is there an entire Death Note if only one page is enough?,"After discussing the matter of whether the Death Note will ever run out of pages, it appears to me that there is another unclear matter, which is whether the page itself can ever run out?  You can easily take a page, use an erasable pen and write carefully, then when filled, erase the entire writing without damaging the page. You will always be able to kill other people using that same page. I have the following sub-questions:   Is this even possible, that is, can you kill people after writing on an erased page? When do we say that the Death Note has run out? See the picture below1, which says that when you run out of room to write, you can ask your Shinigami to bring you another Death Note. If I fill my note, ask the Shinigami for another one, then erase what was written on my first note, will I have made two Death Notes for myself?  If the above is true, and since the rules imply that no more than six Death Notes can be brought to the human world, why didn't Yagami Light do that to get six Death Notes, ensuring that no one else gets a Death Note? How does the Shinigami tell that the Note is filled or not? Does he just look at the pages and see whether they are written or not?      1 Death Note Manga Pilot, Chapter 0, page 26.  "
3958,What is Kirito's relationship with the girls of SAO?,"In the first and second seasons of SAO, Kirito seemed to be interested in more than one girl at the same time. At the end they are all friends and such, but they are all jealous of him and he likes them back and all.  Some would argue Asuna is the real girlfriend, but:   In the cave with Sinon (SAO II, ep.11, 20:30), Sinon asks ""Is there someone you don't want seeing this?"" Kirito shyly answers no. While introducing Asuna to Sinon, Kirito only said that Rika and Asuna were his friends. Asuna looked okay, a bit like she was thinking ""Yeah I'm just his friend.""   These two occasions got me wondering: is he playing them all at the same time or something?   What I'm asking for is something like a timeline, which shows when Kirito likes whom. "
3959,"In Naruto, why were women chosen to be Jinchuuriki of the Kyuubi?","So we are told that during pregnancy the seal weakens. And we can see that in the Kushina episodes. But if the seal weakens during pregnancy, why would they even allow women to become Jinchuuriki? Isn't it way safer to just appoint a man to the role? Do they have anything to gain from appointing a woman? I mean.. Kushina was a woman... the Kyuubi's previous Jinchuuriki was also a woman. Why is that?  When discussing who the next Jinchuuriki will be did  nobody raise they hands and go like ""That's not a good choice at all! You guys do realize if she wants t have kids we'll need to organize a super-secret plan to exploit this. To which I'm sure somebody said ""It's OK, it's not like some random naked man is going to attack us while she's giving birth and exploit this mechanic.... right?"" "
3960,Can water created using water jutsu be drunk?,"The earth and wood style can create permanent trees and walls, can water jutsu create pond or smaller body of water to drink? Is there any instance of this in the series or manga? And where does the water came from. "
3961,Why are the episodes named after literary works?,"I noticed every episode of Parasyte, with the exception of the last one (which shares the title of the anime, Parasyte), is named after a literary work:     The Metamorphosis, Franz Kafka The Devil in the Flesh, Raymond Radiguet Symposium, Plato Tangled Hair, Akiko Yosano The Stranger, Albert Camus The Sun Also Rises, Ernest Hemingway A Dark Night's Passing, Shiga Naoya Freezing Point, Ayako Miura Beyond Good and Evil, Friedrich Nietzsche What Mad Universe, Fredric Brown The Blue Bird, Maurice Maeterlinck Heart, Natsume Souseki Hello Sadness, Françoise Sagan The Selfish Gene, Richard Dawkins Something Wicked This Way Comes, Ray Bradbury Happy Family, Lu Xun The Adventure of the Dying Detective, Arthur Conan Doyle More Than Human, Theodore Sturgeon In Cold Blood, Truman Capote Crime and Punishment, Fyodor Dostoyevsky Sex and Spirit, Clifford Bishop (this is the only one I am unsure of, since no link is available yet on the wikipedia page on the anime, so I had to do some research) Quiescence and Awakening Life and Oath   Why do the episode have these works' titles as their own? Were these significant pieces of literature for Parasyte's creator? Or are the titles somehow related to what happens on each episode? I can see the relation in the first two episodes, the 5th, the 15th and the 20th. But I don't recall precisely what events happened in other episodes, so I can't compare them to the titles (also because I hadn't noticed they were references before). Also related, and may help to answer the other questions: were these titles chosen solely for the anime or do the chapters (or at least some of them) use them too?      EDIT  I found a post on reddit that says:       And the name of the first episode, Metamorphosis, is writer Hitoshi Iwaaki's inspiration for the whole series.     There is no source or reference backing that up, though. Just edited that in so that there's at least somewhere to start looking, if the claim in the post is correct.    EDIT 2  The latest two episodes still aren't referenced in Wikipedia, and I have no idea what work they could be alluding to. If anyone knows what piece of literature they are a reference to, please edit my post accordingly. "
3962,How was Nagato able to re-awaken and control the Rinnegan?,"The Rinnegan originally belonged to the Sage of the Six Paths. He then divided his power between his two sons, which formed the Senju and the Uchiha. For any human being to be able to activate Rinnegan, they need both the Uchiha and Senju DNA. Uchiha Madara, in the last days of his life, was able to activate it, as he already had the Eternal Mangekyo and Hashirama's cells (Senju DNA), making him similar to the Sage.  But the question is: how was Nagato able to re-activate it? Yes, it was Madara who had implanted his Rinnegan in him at a young age, but then, even though the eyes were implanted, Nagato neither had the Uchiha DNA nor the Senju DNA to be able to re-activate the Rinnegan. How was he able to do it?  And as a continuation to it, let's assume he was able to re-activate the already awakened Rinnegan (Madara awakened it originally), how was he able to use it so well and control it without his body taking a toll? He belonged to the Uzumaki clan who may have been the distant relatives of Senju, but that doesn't justify how he was able to control it so well as he did not have any trait of the SO6P, unlike Madara who could now be compared to the Sage (with both DNAs and the Rinnegan).  An example to highlight this is of Kakashi. He got a Sharingan from Obito. But since Kakashi wasn't an Uchiha, his body would take a huge toll on him whenever he used it and had to cover his Sharingan when not using to save Chakra. Though later he trained and excelled at it, he still was a non-Uchiha and thus, his body used to take the toll, though, only after excessive usage. Similarly, since Nagato has no traits of the Sage, his body shouldn't have been able to take the toll of Rinnegan activated full and controlling his 6 Pain paths, and all.  Can somebody please give a detailed explanation of how Nagato was able to awaken and control the Rinnegan? "
3963,Why did Ash need to go back to Pokemon School?,"I was watching Pokemon Sun Moon. In the answer to this question ""Why did Ash became a child back in Sun Moon Series?"" it says that Ash never age so obviously he didn't became child.  But why did he need to go to Poke-school? He knows a lot on Pokemon and he went on till the finals in last league (Kalos) "
3964,Is the end of Honey and Clover Season 2 the end of the series?,"Warning! Spoilers ahead.  The final season of Chica Umino's Honey and Clover ended with Yuuta Takemoto eating a literal honey-and-clover sandwich made by his love interest Hagumi Hanamoto. He was crying as he ate it and said the lines (which made me tear up, just like the other moments of the series):     I’d been wondering whether there is a meaning to a failed love… Is something that disappeared the same as something that never existed? But now I know there is — There was a meaning right here.. Because despite the heartbreak, I’m still glad that I fell in love with you.      --Yuuta Takemoto (read more)   I wonder if Umino made the end a cliffhanger, an open-ended one or if there is a theory out there in the Internets that could shed a light into this. Do you guys know anything post-season 2? "
3965,Where can I watch Mushiking anime?,"I would like to know more about the anime called Mushiking. It is a 52-episode anime (according to Wikipedia) which I just can't find.  There are 1-2 segments on YouTube in Japanese, but that is the most that I could find.  Does anyone know what happened to this anime? Or where could I watch it? "
3966,What kind of technique is Madara using?,"In the episode that shows us the battle between Madara and Hashirama in the Valley Of The End, during an ""exchange"" of techniques, a peculiar one is being used by Madara. Mainly, after fending off a shuriken(?) his tomoe start spinning and the time seems to rewind to the point where the shuriken was being thrown in the first place. This was the only time I noticed this technique being used, and it looks like no other, apart from Izanagi, which it cannot be, for it would void his eye. The exact moment of usage "
3967,What is Kurumi's Gender?,"In Sundome, was Kurumi a transsexual boy before? I remember reading that in an early chapter Kurumi revealed that she used to be a boy before to the main character. Also she claimed to have the same father as him, kind of curious don't you think? "
3968,Is the Mangekyou Sharingan capable of controlling only the Kyuubi or all the Tailed Beasts?,"This is a picture taken from Naruto manga chapter 385.     Is Mangekyou Sharingan capable of controlling only the Kyuubi or is it also able to control the other tailed beasts?  Also, how does Sasuke come to know the nature of the Mangekyou Sharingan? "
3969,Are one-off openings and endings expensive to produce?,"At least two recent anime series have had openings (OPs) or endings (EDs) that were unique to a single episode.  The OP to Erased episode 11 was modified for dramatic purpose to carry over the suspense beginning in episode 10.  Every ED for ReLIFE had its own custom music, combined with a mixture of repeated and custom visuals. I am sure there have been other series to do this sort of thing.  As a fan, I appreciate the extra effort the studios take in producing special OPs and EDs. And it is likely the artistic staff at the anime studios enjoy offering their fans these special glimpses into their series. From a production standpoint, though, I wonder how much extra cost a special OP or ED adds. Do they expect that enhanced fan appreciation due to these things will result in higher returns?  Or are they, like the artistic folks, doing it ""for the fun of it""? "
3970,"Do Zoro, Nami and Robin suffer from bad eyesight?","Although I never noticed in the main story of the anime, there are scenes in some of the openings where Zoro, Nami and Robin are shown wearing eyeglasses:   Zoro in opening 11 Robin in opening 13 Nami in opening 16   Is the fact that they all have bad eyesight canon? Or is it just some filler that the author probably wanted to mix into the series? "
3971,What app has the most comprehensive selection of English-translated digital manga?,"I've been wanting to start reading more English-translated digital manga on my Kindle Fire HD, but I like books published by many different companies, and I'd like to keep any potential digital manga collection I create tied to as few different app sources as I can.  My questions is: is there any digital manga app that currently collects all digitally-published manga? If not, what are some apps that, while not having all series, do offer titles from different publishers, and how extensive is their selection?  As per Hakase's comment, info on sources for legal DRM-free English manga would also be appreciated. Ignore if this makes the question too broad. "
3972,"What is ""digi-paint""?","I was reading some reviews of this season's new shows, and I somehow happened to run across references to ""digi-paint"" twice(!):     The raw mechanics of producing anime can be a pretty frustrating thing sometimes. Back in the early 00s, technology shifts prompted the move to digipaint from traditional cells, and early adopters of the new system suffered heavily for it. Shows like Haibane Renmei had fundamentally gorgeous art design, but looked smudged and indistinct due to the new technology. (from BBK/BRNK - The Winter 2016 Anime Preview Guide)      So this is a forgotten digi-paint show that was dug up in a time capsule from no later than the year of our lord 2002, dusted off, reformatted into 16:9, and re-sold as an adaptation of a Masamune Shirow manga from 2010. How else do you explain its hideous color palette, jagged flat designs, and painfully dated obsession with fetishes of yesteryear like catgirls, maids, androids/cyborgs with unusually sexual hardware, and busty scientist onee-samas? (from Pandora in the Crimson Shell: Ghost Urn - The Winter 2016 Anime Preview Guide)   I ""get"" what they're talking about: that sort of crappy look that post-cel early-2000s shows almost invariably have. But I'm not sure what digi-paint actually is. Aside from another post on ANN that refers to (but does not describe) digi-paint, I haven't managed to google up anything relevant.   What is digi-paint? When did it come into use (was it immediately post-cel?), and what is used nowadays instead? "
3973,Why did Yuuto try to dodge Rokuro's attacks?,"In episode 42, Yuuto said that he took the spell power of Kuranashi, the 12 Guardians, and Abe no Seimei. Then why would he try to dodge Rokuro's attacks?  In episode 41, Kuranashi didn't need to dodge the attacks of Tatara. Then how come when Yuuto combined all that power with the Guardians and Abe no Seimei, he needed to dodge Rokuro's single attacks? "
3974,Why was the Shinobi War started?,"Why was the Shinobi War started if       Kyuubi chakra was all that was needed? Without Naruto (Kyuubi) and Killer B (Hachibi) being captured, the eternal genjutsu (Moon Eye) was initiated by Tobi/Madara. The reason being they could do it, is because they had one of Hachibi's tentacles (courtesy: Sasuke) and Kyuubi's chakra (Gold and Silver brothers). So which means all they needed was a sample of Kyuubi chakra (since all 7 Tailed Beasts were sealed, it was powerful enough to begin Moon Eye, also they had Hachibi's tentacle). Why did Tobi initiate the war if he could have collected Kyuubi chakra somehow? If Tobi knew about it earlier, could the war have been avoided?   His ambition could have been achieved without any war. "
3975,Danganronpa - What is supposed to happen if there are 2 or 3 players left?,"So I just heard of this anime that resembles the Mafia/Wolf game.     However, when Makoto arrives inside the Academy, he loses consciousness and wakes up locked inside the school, where he meets fourteen other newly picked Ultimate students who are in the same situation as him. It is there that a sadistic, remote-controlled bear named Monokuma appears before them, telling them they will be imprisoned in the academy for the rest of their lives, and that they will be put to death if they violate any of the schools rules. He offers only one way for students to ""graduate"" from the academy: murder another student and not be identified as the culprit.   So if the culprit is correctly identified (majority vote or something?), culprit gets executed. If not, everyone but culprit gets executed.  What is supposed to happen if there are 2 or 3 players left?  I'm not so naive as to think that what is supposed to happen is what actually happens, but I think there should be a rule for that.  If there is no explanation in the anime or other media, please state such and if applicable why no explanation is needed (I might be overlooking something obvious).  Liar Game had a rule as to what happens in Minority Rule if there are only 2 players left. There was some detail about it. I don't think explaining that rule spoils the manga or series: If there are 2 left, the prize is split. To drop out, half of the prize must be given back, whatever the amount of the prize is (half of the full 2.1 billion or half of 1.05 billion).  PS I'm done with the anime. Go ahead and spoil other media. But please use spoiler tags for others. "
3976,Why wasn't Naruto able to sense Black Zetsu?,"If Black Zetsu was commanded to be with  Obito while Madara was fighting the 5 kages,   How come, Naruto was not able to sense Black Zetsu in his Kyuubi mode while fighting with Obito?? "
3977,Is the English Pokemon theme song more well known than the Japanese version?,I was watching this video of the Japanese-YouTuber Hikakin beatboxing the first English Pokemon song. It made me wonder: was the English dub theme song more well-known than the original Japanese opening? 
3978,Why do so few light novels make it over via timely translation?,"There is a lot of great series translated by folks like Baka-Tsuki - so, why do series take forever to end up over here, and for that matter, once they're licensed - how come some releases are so spread apart?   Spice and Wolf used to be a 6-month release cycle from Yen Press - it has been reduced now but this is still quite long The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan, and others also find themselves on strange timelines.   Does it really take that long to translate or is there something else here? I've heard things like they're licensed one at a time and they gauge sales before going on. "
3979,"Why is the ""drinking milk"" trope so prevalent in anime?","Repeatedly I see that people in animes drink milk, often after bathing. Females tend to say that it helps to grow their chest. Is that true? But also male characters sometimes drink it, like Kurozuma Watarufrom.    Image from thedreamingotaku. Sanae Dekomori from Chuunibyou Demo Koi Ga Shitai in episode 5.  What is the meaning behind the drinking milk trope, what do people gain from it and why is it shown so often in anime? "
3980,How did Homura able to return to a past where Madoka isn't already a Magical Girl?,"I just finished watching Puella Magi Madoka Magica and its movie, Rebellion. And there's something that's been bugging me.   On episode 10, Homura's past was shown, and I will re-iterate it so you can understand my question.  Loop 1:  She was still a timid and shy girl, with her hair tied on braids and with glasses. She was then shown to almost become a victim of a witch if not for Madoka and Mami showing up, saving her as Magical Girls. Fastforward, Madoka and Mami were both killed at the battle of Walpurgisnacht and Homura decided to become a Magical Girl too, with a wish to go back in time when she met Madoka, but this time, she will be the one to protect her.   Loop 2: Time did return to the past and upon introduction of her by the teacher, she showed the Magical Girl's ring immediately to them, making Madoka and Mami surprised that there's a new Magical Girl. Fast forward, on the battle of Walpurgisnacht, she witnesses Madoka turn into a witch and realized that Kyubey has been deceiving all Magical Girls.  Loop 3: Homura went back to time and befriends with them again, so that she can warn them of Kyubey's deceit but to no avail. Until Sayaka became a witch too, and they had no choice but to kill her. Mami killed Kyoko as well then attempted to kill Homura, but was stopped and killed by Madoka. Homura and Madoka fought on the battle of Walpurgisnacht. They were both defeated and their Soul Gems are depleting, but Madoka gave a Grief Seed to Homura's Soul Gem, begging her to go back in time again and keep her from being fooled by Kyubey. Then she asked Homura to kill her before she can become a witch.  Loop 4: This is where Homura was convinced that no one will believe her story of the future and the deception and so she tries to prevent it, making her personality more aloof and cold, but stronger.  What I don't understand now is how Homura was able to go back to past where Madoka isn't a Magical Girl yet. See, on those first 3 loops, Madoka is already a Magical Girl. If her wish has something to do with it (returning to the past being Madoka's protector), she could've returned to Loop 2 with Madoka not yet a Magical Girl. I wouldn't think that Madoka's pleads to Homura has something to do with it on Loop 3 (preventing her to be fooled by Kyubey) since she's already a Magical Girl, thus, have already made her wish.   So, I don't understand how can she return to a changed past with a changed Madoka, cause as far as I know, she's the only character possible of change inside her looping timeline. Or am I wrong? Is there any explanation to this? "
3981,Why did the Phantom Troupe let Gon and Killua go?,"In the very first episode of the Greed Island arc, Gon and Killua meet up with two of the Phantom Troupe members while in the auction.  The members say they will no longer hunt our heroes because... something to do with their leader's Nen surviving after death? I watched the episode again, but it doesn't make any sense.  Why is the Phantom Troupe no longer interested in revenge against Gon et al? "
3982,Ane Doki ending and the possibility of a sequel,"So I was reminiscing about Mizuki-sensei's works and remembered Ane Doki's ending. For those of you who have read the manga, the ending was a big cliffhanger.   So I was wondering if there is a plan to have a sequel? Did Mizuki-sensei hint on it having a sequel? The manga could use a sequel you know, with an ending like that. "
3983,What are the differences between the manga and anime versions of Excel Saga?,"How does the anime for Excel Saga differ from the manga? More specifically, does the plot in the Excel Saga anime depart significantly from that in the manga?  I've read that some characters only appear in the anime. What are notable differences between the characters who appear in the manga and those who appear in the anime? Are there any other differences? Is the structure of the anime (i.e. one episode spoofs of different genres) different from that of the manga or are there similarities? "
3984,"Do people in soul society remember their life in the ""living"" world?","So we've seen that souls (ghost) in the living world retain their memories, even if they've turned into a hollow. However, do those memories get purged when they are sent to soul society?  The reason I ask is because I'm wondering what would happen when Ichigo died? Conjecture - he gets integrated right into a squad, new squad made with him as captain, etc, etc... Since he's basically qualified as a shinigami through trial by fire anyway. "
3985,Why didn't the Dragon slayers disappear when the eclipse gate was destroyed?,"During the Grand magic games, they were not able to actually defeat all the dragons that came out of Eclipse gate. The dragons as well as future Rouge and Lucy just disappeared and went back to their own timeline when the Eclipse gate was destroyed.  But as Zeref stated, Natsu and the other dragon slayers are from the past and traveled to current timeline using the same Eclipse gate.  So why didn't they disappear as well when the Eclipse gate was destroyed?  Possible plothole?? "
3986,How did Maria obtain her Gungnir Symphogear?,"The Gungnir Symphogear that was used by Kanade shattered, and splinters pierced Tachibana's chest right next to her heart (so close that the doctors did not attempt to remove due to the risks). This gave Tachibana Hibiki the power to summon the Gungnir Symphogear. Supposedly Kanade's pendant dissolved with her physical body, or Tsubasa would surely have retrieved it.  In the second season, when Maria summons the black Gungnir, everyone is surprised that there could be two Gungnir Symphogears, pointing out that Kanade's pendant was supposedly destroyed.  How can Maria have an intact Gungnir pendant? Is it explained how she came to obtain such an artifact? "
3987,Was Yachiru real or just Zaraki's spirit?,"In the final arc of Bleach, we see Yachiru going to a severely wounded Zaraki Kenpachi and talking to him. She couldn't physically be there, and she talks as if she were Nozarashi's manifestation. Yachiru is also reported has having a unique shikai.    Is Yachiru just a manifestation of Zaraki's Zanpakuto? Or did she really exists, and due to their bond, Nozarashi's spirit took her shape? or was Zaraki just dillusional? "
3988,Why did Major Kusanagi wear a particular extreme outfit on episode 14?,"On episode 14 - YE$, at 6:21 in this episode, we see the crew being debriefed by Aramaki. The chief remarks that she is wearing ""some get-up"", inquiring whether she is searching for a specific kind of attention. She replies, somewhat... despairingly(?), with ""...; I just... don't have a choice.""  The scene prior to this ended with her being ejected from a building through a window and landing on a pile of trash. She is noticeably soiled by ""garbage-type fluids"" and, presumably, needs to get cleaned up.  It is not explicit, but it seems that only a few hours, at most, have passed between the incident and the debriefing.  Aside from being her usual hot-gun-toting-super-hacker-ninja self, I have missed the implication as to why this particular outfit is ""mandatory"". Is there a specific clue I missed or was it just to imply that she may have had other, personal, obligations for which she was still dressed? Her outfit was definitely extreme for being at ""the office"", even for her. "
3989,When was the first shadow crocodile created?,"In episode 12 of Kagewani, Banba and Kimura both state that disappearances that are recorded as having happened in Yunnan (in modern-day China) are in fact the handiwork of the shadow crocodile, and that one of the warring factions in that region created the first shadow crocodile by the method of gu.  I don't recall them ever mentioning Yunnan before or after that, but the way they state it so matter-of-factly makes me feel like I'm missing out on something. When did these disappearances happen? Is there an allusion to real-world history I'm not getting here? "
3990,What happen to Nana and Kakeru in The Knight in the Area after the anime ends?,"I have watched The Knight in the Area, but I'm curious as to what has happened since the end of the anime until the latest chapter in the manga.   My questions are as follows:   Do Nana and Kakeru ever get together?  Do they win a championship? Is there a better understanding as to why Suguru can take over Kakeru?  Does Kakeru become the best scorer/forward in the nation?  "
3991,Is Gary also Blue?,"So we have this question about the character Red vs Ash.  It made me start wondering if your rival in the game (red/blue), or if he appears in the manga, is different from Gary.  So are Gary and Blue the same?  If not, what are the major differences? "
3992,"What official statements have Seo Kouji's studio made regarding Akitsuki Fuuka's fate, and what were the repercussions of said statements?","Wherever there is internet and controversial plot twists, there shall be rage, angst and trolling.  Trying to sift through the comment threads in /r/anime and other places is really a pain, and somewhere I end up bouncing on the language barrier.  Doing what they did to the title character so early surely was controversial, and it seems it was not an event planned from the beginning of the series.  What has Seo Kouji stated regarding       Akitsuki Fuuka's death   and how were those statements received? What were the repercussions in specialized media? "
3993,"Is there any material relationship between ""Pandora in the Crimson Shell"" and ""Ghost in the Shell""?","This season's Pandora in the Crimson Shell: Ghost Urn is a work created in part by Masamune Shirow - the same fellow behind Ghost in the Shell. Much to my chagrin, I haven't gotten around to watching Ghost in the Shell. But I do know bits and pieces about it, and there seem to be some surface-level similarities to Pandora in the Crimson Shell (which is airing right now, and which I'm watching).   Obviously, the title, for one (both in English and Japanese - Koukaku Kidoutai vs. Koukaku no Pandora); Pandora has ""Gerzekoma"" robots while Ghost has ""Tachikoma"" robots; and the whole focus on cybernetics and the line between humans and machines.   Do these surface-level similarities reflect any material relationship between the two? (e.g. is Pandora an alternate-universe to Ghost, or a ""meanwhile, in this other part of the world"" story, or something?) Or is it just that Masamune Shirow chose to write about similar themes in two otherwise unrelated manga? "
3994,Why are there songs in OSTs and music albums that don't appear in the anime?,"There are songs from OSTs, or even full albums by bands or singers in the anime, that I have never heard in the anime. Some music albums for which this is true:   Neon Genesis Evangelion: S² Works — many unused songs and alternate mixes or arrangements of existing songs. Le Portrait de Petit Cossette Original Soundtrack — the song my love, so sweet is never used in the OVA. Keep the Beats! by GirlDeMo. God only knows -Secrets of the Goddess- — the full version that is 11 minutes longer than the one used in the OP of The World God Only Knows: Goddesses!   Why do they do this? For fan service? To make us feel like the bands or singers are real artists? Or to get more profits from CD sales? In which case, couldn't they have just picked the cheaper alternative of selecting some existing songs that are good fits for the anime? "
3995,What is the relation between Steins;Gate and Steins;Gate 0?,"Is Steins;Gate 0 a sequel to Steins;Gate? If not, what is common between the two and where do they deviate?     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vs&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;                 Steins;Gate                           Steins;Gate 0   "
3996,How does immortality work?,Can someone explain to me how immortality works in UQ Holder? Specifically about how each type of immortality works and what is required to kill that type? 
3997,Why is incest such a prevalent theme in manga and anime?,"I used to think that incest was only in hentai/eroge, but gradually, I have run into more mainstream content which seems to hint at brother-sister, mother-son relationships, or the tension of such attraction.  What is the origin of this theme?  Why is it so prevalent in Japanese manga and anime compared to Western comics?   It seems strange for a taboo to be popping up everywhere, so I am curious as to the origin.  "
3998,How is Orochimaru able to use his arms?,"How is Orochimaru able to use his arms? Didn't the 3rd hokage cut them out of his spirit? So even if he did jump between bodies, he shouldn't be able to use his hands because it wasn't his physical body's arms that were cut but spiritual ones. "
3999,Are Coco and Jellal (aka Mystogan) siblings?,"In the anime, it is hinted that Coco is the daughter of the king, but she does not seem like one, nor does anyone refer to her as one. Jellal (known as Mystogan in Earth Land) on the other hand is clearly the son and a prince and is more than a dozen times called prince. So that would make them siblings, but they don't act like they are siblings at all.  Are Coco and Jellal siblings? If so, why don't they act like it, and how come Coco doesn't appear to be a princess? "
4000,Has there ever been an instance of an officially crowd-funded translation of a novel?,"There's some novels like ""From the New World"" which are excellent novels and award winner, but never make it over here. They still fall into the ""otaku"" subculture but appeal to broader audiences, too.  As consumers, has some sort of crowd-funding or the like ever been attempted to get these materials translated? How can consumers express their desire to bring this material overseas? "
4001,Has the release date of Shingeki no Kyojin's second season been announced?,"I've been hearing/reading a lot of news about a second season of Shingeki no Kyojin since 2014. All the sites said that the release date would be in the end of 2015 or the first months of 2016. We're in 2016 and there's still no season 2.   Is there any official source about a accurate release date? If so, what's the exact date? "
4002,How do UQ Holder! and Mahou Sensei Negima! relate?,"I've been reading UQ Holder! since it started coming out. So far (14 chapters into the series) I've understood everything, and (I think) I have not missed any reference or anything similar.  However, just today I realised that MAL lists UQ Holder! as Mahou Sensei Negima!'s sequel. How exactly are the two related, and how much do I miss if I haven't read the latter? Or is it just meant to be a spiritual sequel, and nothing in the story is related? "
4003,Is there an official statement about Detective Conan's ending?,"Currently, Detective Conan series is now on it's 721 (source) and probably still counting. Is there any statement from the production if they have any plans on having this anime series end? If there is, what is their plan on doing so? Will Conan be able to revert back to Shinichi and have the Black Organization behind bars or something like that? Or do they want this to be open-ended? "
4004,What is the purpose of purple rope belt that Sasuke wears?,All Orochimaru's people are wearing a purple color rope belt. What is the purpose of it? Why Sasuke is wearing it even after killing Orochimaru? Does it offer any power?   
4005,Can Logia type Devil Fruit users fight each other?,"Precisely the question is about fights like:  Portgas D. Ace VS Enel or VS Smoker.  This question isn't about who is stronger, it's rather about how can they fight each other if they meet? How can fire fight electricity or smoke?    I'm still at episode 338 so maybe I'm not aware of some information available in future episodes, but still, I'm getting too curious to wait for the episodes to reveal that for me. "
4006,Is ecchi used for humor or is it sexually playful?,"The definition of ecchi is sexually playful, right? But I heard it is almost always used for humor. Can someone explain please? "
4007,Why do the resurrected bodies disappear in the impure world resurrection jutsu?,"Some of the resurrected people like Sai's brother were freed from the jutsu although Kabuto told Tobi that the resurrected people can't be killed. This is a pic of a conversation between Kabuto and Tobi.    Similarly, Sasori also disappeared after telling Kankuro to use his puppet parents.     How can the souls be freed from the bodies even if the user who resurrected them did not release them? And why didn't this happen when the third hokage was fighting his predecessors during the chunin exams? "
4008,Who is to say if someone is 'murdered'?,"Who is to say if someone is 'murdered' (This is the main question. The sentences marked with '?' are just to help provide motivation and context for the question) ?  Example cases:   Does suicide count as murder? What if A accidentally or unintentionally (there might be a difference. I talked to a law expert once. not sure though) kills B, whether or not there are witnesses? What if C kills D in self-defense? What if some student E trips over and dies, without the death being intended by any of the other students, while there are no witnesses? How do the students know Monokuma would really state that E's death was an accident instead of calling a classroom trial to trick everyone? Who decides if a killing is done in self-defense? Who decides if a killing in an accident? The students? Monokuma? If one of the students has dissociative identity disorder like in Identity (2003), and one of the identities murders another student, what happens to the body containing the multiple personalities?   Re the self-defense (hardly spoilerous but just in case):      There was this one murder claimed by the murderer to be self-defense, but it wasn't.   Or it could be. I think that's kind of why we have juries, law experts, etc.  Oh and I guess 'not guilty by reason of insanity' is not a defense in Danganronpa.  PS I'm done with the anime. Go ahead and spoil other media. But please use spoiler tags for others. "
4009,What did Team Rocket use to evolve Rhyhorn?,"In the Pokemon Adventures manga, Koga used some kind of item (like a syringe) on his Rhyhorn:    The strange part is that the Rhyhorn suddenly evolved into a Rhydon, in the middle of the fight:    Red confirmed this:    I didn't understand how it would be possible to make Rhyhorn to evolve like this, because Rhyhorn is not the kind of Pokemon that could be evolved by stones.  So what did Team rocket use? Does this item appear again in the manga and did someone explain it better? Or does it even exist in the TV series?  "
4010,What did Light write before killing Shibuimaru Takuo?,"So I decided to rewatch Death Note. In the first episode, there's a motorcyclist called Shibuimaru Takuo - Light's second victim. In the scene where he is about to kill him, according to my subtitles, he writes:     Shibuimaru Takuo: car accident   And we see this:    I don't know Japanese, but it seems to me that all the lines are the same, except for the two last ones.  Since that guy is just his second victim, what exactly happened in that scene? What do these lines say, and why did Light several of them, over and over? "
4011,What does the symbol 油 on Jiraiya's headband mean?,"Jiraiya is shown wearing a headband with 油【あぶら】 drawn onto it. I know that 油 is the symbol for abura, and that it means ""oil"".  But how is it related to him? Does it have anything to do with the fact that he is a sage from Mount Myoboku? "
4012,How are UQ Holder member numbers attributed?,"In page 12 of chapter 11, Touta and Kuroumaru are officially accepted in UQ Holder. They are, respectively, attributed the numbers 7 and 11:    Do these numbers mean anything in particular and correspond to something in terms of hierarchy (of power or ranking)? If so, how powerful/ranked are Touta and Kuroumaru? Or are they just randomly chosen? "
4013,Can murders be committed by more than one person? Can there be more than one victim?,"Unlike the games in Liar Game, the rules of a Danganronpa game are sometimes made up or stated midway, which for me kind of sucks but is tolerable so long as the rules are consistent.  As far as I know, in Liar Game, the dealers have always accounted for all possible situations so whenever there are changes in the game, they state it outright. For example, in games involving voting, the dealers have stated what happens in the event of a draw.    In Danganronpa, can murders be committed by more than one person?  Monokuma stated (albeit midway) that accomplices after the fact are not considered as murderers for their purposes.  What if both A and B hold a single knife together and use it to stab C once resulting in C's death? In that case, am I correct that A and B are both the murderers?*  Perhaps Monokuma will adjust the rules, but I would like to know what are the stated rules regarding this, if any and from any media.  I'm done with the anime. Feel free to spoil other media, but please use spoiler tags.    *I'm trying to rule out trick cases like:   A and B use one knife each to try to kill C at the same time but then it will turn out that one of them was actually first or the second stab was the one that killed C. A and B say they will kill C together, but B didn't hold the knife firmly so only A is counted as a murderer.  "
4014,Why the appearance of One Piece characters have goatee after time skip?,"After time skip, the appearance of characters in One Piece are changed. Several of them change significantly like Nami with her long hair, Robin with brighter skin, Chopper with all of his transformation different before time skip, even Usopp have more muscular body and longer hair, he also have goatee.  But I want to know what happened with this goatee. Beside Usopp, other characters also have goatee after time skip like :  Sanji    Capone Bege    Well maybe I'm not sure who's the others, but why many of them have goatee? First I think it's for make them more mature or to shows that time has passed several years, but when I see (maybe it's bad example) Pokemon, in the latest generation they have another ""evolution"" called mega evolution, in this mega form, many Pokemon changes their appearance with some goatee like attributes.        Is this goatee is trend in Japan or what? "
4015,Can an animated show created outside Japan be called Anime?,"The ""Anime"" called ""Torkaizer"" which will be created in Alter Ego Productions animation studio in Abu Dhabi is created outside Japan but is called Anime officially, can a cartoonic show created outside Japan be called anime?  This is the official trailer by the official account of the studio on YouTube,  in the description it officially states that it is an Anime. "

4018,Was only Death Note Box Set 2 reprinted?,This is for the anime  I see that Volume 2 has been going out of stock everywhere - but it seems like it got a reprint this year. Was only Volume 2 actually reprinted? Is there no Volume 1 reprint?   I can't find any information about this on the internet.  
4019,What is the meaning behind the scene where Saki fights a Tainted Cat?,"In Shinsekai Yori episode 10, Saki encounters a Tainted Cat which attacks her in the neck, but fails to damage her due to a necklace she's wearing. While the cat is biting the necklace, she mumbles some words and after that the cat is killed.  The first impression I had was that she was defending herself. So she probably chanted something related to the way the cat was killed. But re-watching the scene, the cat had blood on its mouth despite not being able to damage Saki. What's the meaning behind this scene? What is Saki mumbling? Did SHE kill the cat or was it somebody else (like Shun)? "
4020,In what episode of the anime does Natsu become a demon?,Just like the title says: in what episode of the anime does Natsu become a demon (E.N.D)? I was wondering if that even happened in the anime or only in the manga? 
4021,"What would the list of manga genres in Japan be, based on bookstore labeling schemes?","I've seen various lists of manga genres in English, but in my experience they haven't lined up to the writing that I have read in Japanese book stores.   Note, so that the question is not too broad, I limit the scope of this question to the genres you would find in the labeling scheme of a book store in Japan. Obviously subgenres on to infinity can be defined.   Basically, at a Japanese bookstore (like Kinokuniya), what would the aisles be named?   I ask, because I imagine the perception of genre to the English speaking otaku may be different than what is considered in Japan.    For instance I see yaoi sections marked as BL  There appears to be a section for young girls, but I can't read the kanji Perhaps scifi? But again I can't read the kanji. Is giant robot considered a genre in Japan, is that something you'd see an aisle for in a bookstore?    What would be the idioms be in Japan?  "
4022,Why does the Death Note never run out of pages?,"It is kind of intriguing the Death Note never runs out of pages...     How to Use: XXXI      The number of pages of the Death Note will never run out.    Source  Since it's made of an unknown matter it's not really that difficult to believe, but we didn't really see the effects of this rule in the anime, which I guess could be more important than most of the rules (unless you show me some other point of view in the answers), by analyzing:  The thickness of the Note should increase:  By assuming that the number of pages will increase every time you use the Note pages to make it endless, we would clearly see that the Death Note will get thicker, since the number of pages is rising, and we would clearly see that the Note of Light would be too thick after his long years using it.  The already written pages remains:  We could also deduce that the pages that are already filled do not disappear since both L and Near did analyze the names written on the Notes and the names of the dead victims as another evidence of the conviction.  Now as a question:  We know that the user can rip some pages from the Note to use them later, now what would happen if the user rips all the pages from the last one filled to the end cover of the Note for using them later? :    Will it be judged as destroying the Note? Will it be judged as ripping some pages?    If 1), the Note will be rendered useless. If 2), would other pages appear in the Note? In case they appear, could the user keep ripping off pages and giving them to hundreds of people making Kira everywhere? Why didn't Yagami Light do such a thing as becoming the master of the page users and the only one knowing their names in case they disobey him, and as a result, creating an army for himself made of the Kira fans?    Check also: Why is there an entire Death Note if only one page is enough? "
4023,What happens in a drawn vote?,"Unlike the games in Liar Game, the rules of a Danganronpa game are sometimes made up or stated midway, which for me kind of sucks but is tolerable so long as the rules are consistent.  In Liar Game, afaik, the dealers have always accounted for all possible situations so whenever there are changes in the game, they state it outright. For example, in games involving voting, the dealers have stated what happens in the event of a draw.    Suppose in a Danganronpa game starting with 15 students,   all murders are committed by exactly one person (no collaborative murders during the act, but before or after the act is fine, assuming there would be some incentive) and to exactly one person (no multiple victims) all murderers are successfully guessed and convicted (iirc, this is by majority vote) so long as there are more than 3 players No one dies in a way other than being murdered. So, no one messes with Monokuma, dies of an accident, dies of health conditions (eg asthma) or naturally (eg old age), etc, but suicide is fine. No murders will be hidden from the other students indefinitely, as in all corpses will be discovered or if the body is burned, then there will be enough evidence to say a murder has taken place and thus enough evidence for a classroom trial to be called.   Assuming the above situation is consistent internally and consistent with the initial set up of a Danganronpa game, such game will eventually come down to 3 students, whom I'm going to call Kotonoha, Yuno and Mion.  Suppose further:   The game continues (so it's not declared a draw between the 3). Yuno dies, not of suicide or accident but murdered by Kotonoha or Mion. If there is a corpse (body is not burned or anything), it will be discovered. If none, Yuno's death is discovered in another way. Despite insufficient witnesses, a classroom trial will be called.   Questions:   So what happens in the event of a drawn vote between the two? Generally, whenever there are an even number of voters in a classroom trial, what happens in the event of a drawn vote? Since it's not a majority, everyone but the culprit dies?   I would like to know what are the stated rules regarding this, if any, and from any media.    If I made any logical errors either internally (inconsistent with itself) or externally (inconsistent with Danganronpa), please point them out.  PS I'm done with the anime. Go ahead and spoil other media. But please use spoiler tags for others.  PPS Re 'Kotonoha, Yuno and Mion'      Don't spoil please.  "

4025,"What exactly does ""best girl"" mean and where did the expression originate from?","I've seen the expression ""best girl"" being used several times, and I find it quite self-explanatory. However, some people seem to define it in slightly different ways. Here are some different definitions from one or two reddit threads:       It's when I get a boner in my heart.            Best Girl = Mai Waifu            I'm not sure if everyone thinks about it like I do, but with 'best girl' I just mean it's my favourite girl from a show.            As far as I can tell, it just means you post a hundred pictures of a pretty anime girl you're in love with. And its creepy without context. Unless its being done ironically, then its only a little creepy.   I was wondering if there's some sort of ""official"" definition for the expression ""best girl"". Beside that, where did the expression (or meme, I'm not sure it is considered a meme) originate from? Is this an expression that is used in Japan too, or is it a Western thing? "
4026,Aren't players required to choose a subclass?,"Most of the characters (at least up to episode 5, since I haven't gone any further) seem to have both class and subclass:     Akatsuki: Class - Assassin; Subclass - Tracker   Shiroe: Class - Enchanter; Subclass - Scribe Nyanta: Class - Swashbuckler; Subclass - Chef Serara: Class - Druid; Subclass - Maid   However, Naotsugu (whose Class is Guardian) appears to not have a Subclass.     From the Classes and the Subclasses page on Log Horizon Wiki, one can tell that once a player starts playing Elder Tale he has to choose a Class, which cannot be changed again. However, one also gathers that Subclasses, on the other hand, are changeable, but the site says nothing about whether or not a player is required to have one.  Does this mean that Subclasses are not required? Or was Naotsugu's class just not yet revealed/unknown? "
4027,Why are ogres so strong?,"As far as I know Ogres and Karmic demons are regular humans who (explained in conventional terms) have suffered and become full blown Sociopaths and heavily depressed individuals, respectively, who use all their might in throwing and restraining, again respectively, all their power at those surrounding them, but one way (consciously) or another (unconsciously) it goes out and hurts others.  My first question is: Does this affect anybody or just a few? The Second question is more a set of questions than anything: If just a few, then who? Talented/powerful people? If everybody, then does that mean that the world was filled with Ogres and Karmic Demons before the current order came in to place? If so, when why did the false Minoshiro (whatever that means) forgot to mention it? Or did I forget to watch it in the 3 times I watched the episode?  But the one thing that bothers me the most, which is basically based off all the previous questions is my third and last question: Why the hell are Ogres so goddamn powerful?  I mean, look at the Messiah, child of Maria and Mamoru, taken off them by Yakomaru. The first and only human kid the rats get in their hands on, breed to adolescence (which is when they get their powers) and turns out to be a killing sociopath with powers as immense as the most powerful dude in the village. This case essentially brings up all the previous questions I asked, which if you didn't notice, is driving me mad.  So, does anyone have any answers? "
4028,Is there a meaning behind the paintings in Tsubaki Kureha's living room?,"In episode 7 of Yuri Kuma Arashi, I noticed that Liberty Leading the People was hanging on the wall in Tsubaki Kureha's living room:      Here's an image of the full painting:      I get the symbolism of the painting itself, but what's the symbolism it has in the anime? Or is it just a known painting on the wall?    EDIT:  ʞɹɐzǝɹ pointed out in a comment below that the painting across from that one is Henri Rousseau's The Dream:      Here's the full painting:     So I extend my previous question to this painting too: Do the paintings have any special symbolism in the anime itself, or are they just paintings on the wall?

4029,Where is Eren's father Dr. Jaeger?,"So I finally got around to seeing what the fuss was all about with Attack on Titan anime series, by marathoning it in two days, and I am glad I did. Do note that I just finish watching the anime series only, so if it's answered in the manga, please indicate spoilers.  The thing that stood out for me though was the complete absence of Eren's father after the first two episodes, and the fact that no one seemed in the least bit concerned. We know he was (probably) not dead, because in the second episode, he was seen riding back home concerned about whether his wife, Eren and Mikasa were safe. In Eren's memories, he also seemed to be aware of what was going to happen (or saw it as inevitable), so it seemed unlikely that he had been killed, particularly with no mention of it.  However, aside from some recurrences of Eren's dream/memory, there was no sign of his father at all, and nobody seemed to care. Eren and Mikasa didn't mention or even recognised the absence. And the various soldiers, generals, etc. didn't seem interested either, even though Eren made it clear that his father had something hidden in his basement, possibly related to his ability. I would have thought that someone would have interrogated him further on what his father was doing or what could be in the basement. All we seem to know is that he had been traveling somewhere for a week or so.  Is there an explanation as to where Dr. Jaeger was during the 5+ years? Is it just an oversight that Eren's father is so glossed over by the series? Seems kind of weird when he's potentially a crucial character in the same vein as Annie's father. "

4032,"In Danganronpa, how can a classroom trial be called if there is no corpse?","Unlike the games in Liar Game, the rules of a Danganronpa game are sometimes made up or stated midway, which for me kind of sucks but is tolerable so long as the rules are consistent.  In Liar Game, afaik, the dealers always account for all possible situations and state consequences of the situations outright especially when there are changes. For example, in games involving voting, the dealers state what happens in the event of a draw, even if it later doesn't occur or even factor into some calculations made by the characters. In one voting game, a draw was not possible because of an odd number of players (well actually, assuming everyone votes). Later, the number of players became even, so the dealer of  the game immediately stated what would happen in the event of a drawn vote.    Iirc, a PA is made, after 3 students discover a corpse, announcing that there will be a classroom trial called.   What if there is no corpse to be found, like the body was burned (alive or dead)? What if student A is murdered, and the corpse is hidden for a long period? Can the game continue with an unannounced or unresolved murder?   PS I'm done with the anime.

4034,What's the meaning behind all the chairs in Madoka's room?,"In Episode 9 of Puella Magi Madoka Magica, during Madoka's conversation with Kyuubei, we see that she has a ton of chairs in her room:    At first I thought this was just the usual Shaft weirdness. But I stumbled on a blog post that attempted to explain all the symbolism behind the imagery in this scene. According to the author of the blog, the empty chairs represent fallen Magical Girls. While the author's interpretation is plausible, I also found it somewhat tenuous&mdash;the only evidence the author gives is the scene in Mami's apartment earlier on, when Madoka sees Mami's furniture and bursts into tears. I don't have a very clear memory of the scene, but I don't remember it focusing specifically on the furniture&mdash;it could just as well have been the empty apartment.  Is there any other evidence in the show that supports this blogger's reading? And is there evidence that supports another meaning for the scores of empty chairs in Madoka's room? "

According to the wiki, Rinne Tensei can re-infuse new life force energy to the bodies of those who have died. With that said, why Madara re-infused with Obito's body? and how come that Obito died (or is he dead)? What happened to the Black Zetsu?

4038,Why aren't Kyuubi and Naruto real allies?,"Several characters in the Naruto universe share their bodies with other entities, most of them are true allies. They share the Power both have, even if one has the upper hand controlling the body.  My question is, why doesn't this happen with Kyuubi and Naruto?  Several times Kyuubi saves Naruto with his red chakra out of hairy situations. Naruto is aware of it and sometimes they talk to each other. Kyuubi is an evil Daemon, sure, but due to the fact tat he would die if Naruto died; and Naruto, as a Ninja, has a dangerous live; it would be in Kyuubi's advantage to help out, given that his Chakra is way stronger than Naruto's.  Why don't they team up?  EDIT: Question regarding Naruto Vanilla not Shipuuden or anything else. "

4041,What does being a saint mean?,"In Toaru Majutsu no Index, there are currently about 20 saints      as of before the Acqua of the Back-Arc.   So far I've read until the arc named in the spoiler and I'm wondering, how you become a saint and what makes a saint?       Kanzaki mentions that she was born with that ability, so it's most likely that it's a trait that one has all his life. But it seemed to me, that Acqua of the Back wasn't a saint back when he worked for England; Is this wrong or did he become a saint when he became a part of Gods right Seat?  It also seems, that a life of a saint doesn't depend on being a saint, because Acqua comes back later.   Are saints just extremely powerful? Or do they have another special trait? "
4042,Are there different versions of the Captain Tsubasa anime?,"I recently started watching Captain Tsubasa online from the beginning again. It's been my favorite cartoon of my childhood. But I find some odd moments watching it again. It seems the animation is different in some scenes.   For example, from what I recall from my childhood, in the game between Tsubasa and Misugi, there was a heavy rain with dark sky and clouds which lasted far longer than what I saw online in this new version, or I remember specifically one of my favorite moments where Tsubasa hits the ground with his head during a game and tries to retrieve the ball again, but he can't focus - I remember his eye color changed, but in this newer version its color is the normal color.   There are a lot of these moments, which makes me wonder if what I see online is not the original version. Am I right to think like this? If yes, can anyone help me find the older version? "

Is this historically accurate? Where did they all get their guns from? "

Kurisu says ""About fifteen minutes ago"" and Okabe says ""I don't have the slightest idea"".  I guess it has (spoiler for the end of the anime)      something to do with time travel and world line travel in episode 23 and 24 but unfortunately I didn't watch those episodes that carefully.

One For All allows the user to access stockpiled power, which grants the user momentary superhuman strength at destructive levels, increased agility, and superhuman speed. Izuku Midoriya is the ninth user of One for All.   Now All for One,      All For One allows the user to steal other people's Quirks and wield these stolen powers as their own. All For One also allows the user to transfer stolen Quirks to other people. The user of All For One can combine several Quirks in order to create devastating techniques which would normally not be possible with the usage of only one Quirk.    In the fight between All might and All for one,       we see the combined effects of multiple quirks used together by All for one. Going by the name that is around 10-12 stolen offensive quirks (not to mention numerous defensive ones as well as ones allowing him to live etc.    How is it that the combined physical prowess of 9 individuals (2 of which we know were quirkless) can be stronger than the combination of atleast a dozen Strong quirks, maybe more?  Possibly Related: What does it mean that &quot;One for all&quot; allows to stockpile power?  The accepted answer fails to explain how this stockpiling would outgrow All for one, unless its some sort of exponential increase for One for All vs a linear increase for All for One. "
4051,Does making a TV anime series cost less than making a typical TV series?,"According to this post, 10 million yen per episode is the minimum price for making an anime. I am wondering how this price compares to making a typical TV series that film human actor?  I guess if the story includes lots of special effects (story like Harry Potter which needs special effect for magic, or story like Star Wars where most background needs CG), it doesn't cost much when making anime as those are still drawings after all. It may cost a bit more if there are battle scenes, but compared to filming using human actor, anime should be a lot cheaper to make? "
4052,Could Yuno do these things to win with both Yuki and her being alive?,"Scenario 1: if Yuno from world 1 (Yuno 1) killed Yuno from world 2 (Yuno 2) to take her place, wouldn't that take her out of the game? With that, Yuki could win and Yuno 1 would still be alive in world 2 that is, though she might have had to wait for the game to start before doing this.  Scenario 2: if Yuno came to world 2 in the past, she could break Yuki's phone before the game preventing him from entering, in which case she could win with Yuki still being alive.  Scenario 3: if Yuno 1 kept Yuno 2 alive and just hid for awhile, she could let them play out the game for awhile. When it gets close to the end, Yuno 1 takes out Yuno 2 and Yuki wins in another way. Yuno 1 could still be alive, though that would make Yuki mad considering it wouldn't have been his Yuno 2.  Could Yuno do these things to win with both Yuki and her being alive? "

4054,Was there an early preview of Kagamigami or a similar series in Shonen Jump?,"Alright, so this is driving me crazy but I recently read the first issue of Kagamigami that came out in Shonen Jump (I'm a few weeks behind). I remember reading another manga that felt almost the exact same as Kagamigami. In the manga I read, the crime takes place in a tunnel, not in front of stairs like in the recent issue. The evil Shikigami also wasn't called the ""Ripper"" I believe, and the main character didn't have a detailed discussion with the culprit like she does in this one.  The premise is almost the exact same: girl with power to trace objects becomes detective. The Shikigami that the boy uses are almost the exact same as the manga I remember reading. Besides re-downloading every issue of Shonen Jump, does anyone have an idea of what this might have been? "
4055,How can one tell if Nappa has become a Super Saiyan?,"We can identify Super Saiyans by the change in the colour of their hair. With Nappa being bald, how could we identify he has become a Super Saiyan? Is it only by the increase in power? "
4056,Question about Danzo's Isanagi,"So according to Madara, whenever a Sharingan eye uses the Isanagi, it casts an ultimate genjutsu on itself and whenever the caster is hurt / dies, it manipulates the genjutsu. The genjutsu is so powerful that it blurs the line between reality and fantasy and thus the weilder is healed / ressurected. But whenever the weilder is ressurected, the Sharingan eye dies.  Danzo wanted to increase the duration of his Isanagi and wanted to be able to possess more than one Sharingan eye so asked Orochimaru to implant the cells of the 1st hokage in his right arm to get the wood style and then implanted 10 sharingan eyes in his now powerful right arm. So he had ""10 lives""  Am I right till now?  Then my question is, what was Karen, during the fight, was talking about one eye closing every 60 seconds? I thought an eye closed after the isanagi ressurected the weilder..then whst was thing about an eye closing every 60 seconds? "

4063,Is there an official Otaku day?,"I've stumbled upon many posts on G+ and FB (example) that state that December 15th is some sort of official Otaku Day. I've also found this page which is from 2012, which means this was celebrated, at least, in 2012 too. However, I found no reliable pages that say that this is a thing, much like the person who posted the first post on this forum.  I found this ANN article that puts this year's Otaku Day on August 17th (2012's was on the 18th). Furthermore, the second link provided there links to a Facebook page, in which it is stated that this event takes place on the third Saturday of August every year.  The event announced on the first paragraph is, apparently, called ""World Otaku Day"". The one announced on the second is the ""(Annual) International Otaku Day"". However, I find no reference of any of these two, nor of any ""official"" Otaku day on Wikipedia.  So, is there a day that is really (official, or something of the sort) regarded as Otaku Day? Are there any more reliable sources that have a fixed date for this event? Or are these two events relatively official and both recognised as two different Otaku days? "
4064,Why are some panels just sketches?,"I have been reading some Boku no Hero Academia and in some chapters (only very few) there have been panels, which looked like sketches and not like the rest of the manga. Since it were only single panels, I didn't think much of it. But while reading chapter 182, there have been whole pages like that (s. picture below).   Did the artists run out of time and so, they weren't able to complete all pages? Or is there a different reason for this?      )  "

4068,Why is class 3-3 still open?,"I was wondering why would the school keep a cursed class open for more than 20 years when people are dying.  I think they Misaki mentioned in the anime that the school tried to change the class name to ""3-C"" or something similar, but was there a reason why they just didn't remove the class entirely so they go ""3-1"",""3-2"",""3-4"",""3-5"",...etc.  Is there a canon explanation of why the school is just ignoring the deaths an leaving it to the simple ""ignore one student"" strategy? Moreover why do students openly join a cursed class instead of moving to another class? another school? another city? "
4069,Why does Madara appear unhurt despite being covered in wounds?,"I'm not sure if I have missed anything in the past, but Madara seems unphased by every attack.  Sasuke stabs a sword through his arm, but this isn't a problem.  All the tailed beasts stomp on Madara with their tails, and Madara doesn't even evade. Instead, he tanks the attack like it is no big deal.  What's going on here? Hashirama's senjutsu should only do so much, but it seems like Madara is simply invulnerable, aside from a little bleeding. Why isn't Madara getting hurt at all?  Is this what we call a plot shield? "

This happens when Nanami first goes in past and sees Tomoe caring for the ""beautiful woman"".  Is the woman Yukiji? If yes, why does he care for Yukiji as if she is Nanami?

4073,Do Sharingan users experience its full potential when having mixed stages of eyes?,"Throughout the Naruto series, both original and Shippuden, Sharingan users are shown with the same stages of Sharingan in both of their eyes.  On the Sharingan Wiki page, it contains an image of Sasuke with his Sharingan Eyes when he unlocks them during his fight with Haku. In this instance, Sasuke has two different stages of Sharingan.

If not, why do the eyes develop differently? "
4074,What does the Jormungand system even do?,"Maybe I was not paying attention in class, but it seems Jormungand is an autonomous AI system that destroys all aircraft indiscriminately once it has been activated. It indiscriminately robs everybody of air travel, even Koko. It would make sense if it could leave civilian planes alone or obey their operators.  With what weapons does Jormungand enforce ""no air travel, ever""? Does it attack even low-altitude gliders? Is is completely indiscriminate, since it destroyed all aircraft at once? Can Koko override it? "

Did they really did the darkness detection, head cutting stuff? Could it be that they didn't detect any darkness in Naruto and let him pull the switch?  Or were they just meant as a horrible prank? "
4086,Explain the ending of Darker than Black season 2?,"I finished Darker than Black few days back and has been going through different forums and explanations to find a suitable conclusion but no good. Someone please help with the questions.  1) Yin was Izanami which is apparent and is shown in black outfit to differentiate from the actual Yin, which is white one. Correct?  2) Who was Izanagi?  3) What was that yellow spectre thing inside Yin which makes the promise to  grant her a wish?  4) Is Yin dead in the end? OR did Izanagi(considering Shion as Izanagi) create a clone of Yin which differs from her in gender and placed the Izanami inside that body? and later Hei carried Yin's soul to her original body.  5) How come Hei gets to know about the second earth and everything which is going on and stops Suou from shooting Izanami?  I find it difficult to accept that Hei separated  Yin from Izanami considering his powers because then there is no body for Izanami to return to? and Shion was already dead by the time Hei appears on the screen, so it will be impossible for Shion and Hei working together to separate Yin.  6) Also, does anyone have any idea about Yin's wish? Was it to be dead to save the world or to be with Hei? I personally believe the second one since and think that Shion to be Izanami and the yellow spectre(which i cannot explain how but please expain if you know since he is contractor nota doll so no spectre for him) and finally he creates a seperate body for Izanami hence full filling her wish.

4105,"How does Kihara Amata's device to bypass Accelerator's passive redirection actually work, and should it work at all?","Disclaimer: I watched only the anime. (And read Toarupedia)  In season 2 of Index we are introduced to Kihara Amata, one of the scientists who worked on researching Accelerator's ability. He attacks him head on which usually proves fatal for the attacker depending on their attack strength and punches Accelerator. Then Accelerator creates a wind tornado and attacks Amata. However, Amata dispels the attack into thin air.   Now the thing that bugs me is how he managed to punch Accelerator and the anime's explanation. Amata narrates what he is deeply knowledgeable about the inner workings of Accelerator's ability and points out that his redirection shield switches the directions of objects which come in contact with it and the trick to bypass it is to pull back your fist just at the moment of contact and the shield will switch direction of the fist which would be backwards right into Accelerator (or somehow the momentum of the punch and not the fist it is not perfectly clear to be honest).   The problem in this explanation is that we are quite often told that Accelerator's shield's speed is equal or faster than the speed of light because his ability reflects UV and other radiation (at least UV travels in speed close to speed of light) which means that to bypass the shield and trick it into letting through an attack Amata would have to move at speeds which are faster than the speed of UV rays or the speed of light, which is absurd even given the fact that he apparently replaces his hand with artificial one.   To illustrate, imagine what you are standing before a big Vector field which is slightly visible. It is of a size of a wall or something. You see Kihara Amata on the other side running at the wall going for a punch. There are few things what could happen here:   Amata moves faster than the shield can react and punches you in the  face. The shield's reaction time is much much higher than Kihara's time (and that includes calculations to determine whether the vector brings harm/no harm, as shown wth UV), Kihara moves his fist close to the edge of the field and then pulls back. Nothing happens, as the fist did not make contact. The shield's reaction time is still higher than Amata's punch,but this time Amata goes for the punch-pullback on the edge of the field, entering it slightly. As shield is too fast for him, Amata breaks his arm moment he even makes contact with the field, and there is no time for him (as per his relative slowness of movement) to even begin to pullback, as the shield already made calculations and reacted with at least speed higher than UV.   The only way the punch bypasses the shield is if it's movement speed is faster than the field's reaction. This way, it is possible to just ignore the shield as it does not even have time to make calculations if it is slower than the vector's speed.  Even if for a moment we imagine that Amata invented a way for his hand to harmlessly move at the speed of light or rather faster than the shield can react as we are never told in the anime whether the shield has any speed limits, his punch would just go through the shield, and if Amata pulls back, shield still would not have time to react and nothing happens. However that Amata can give a punch that travels at the speed of light is highly doubtful, so we can assume that the trick is something else and he bluffs. But what is it? Did the guy who wrote the script decide to include plot induced stupidity or is there an in-verse explanation which actually makes sense?  Edit: @Ryans comment's about with theory of possible exploit of the the shield got me thinking. If the field decides whether to reflect or not, and let's some things in, perhaps it could be exploited by first just moving slowly and entering the field. The field would mark the vector ""non-harmful"" and allow the hand in. Then the hand would suddenly accelerate into opposite direction of the shield's emittor (i.e. Accelerator) and the shield would mark the vector as ""harmful"" and switch the directions of the hand. Though this seems odd now that I think about it more, because the moment shield would switch direction of the fist it would become ""harmful"" again, would not it switch the direction of the vector again this time away from the field emittor? Now, one other things I wonder about is why Kihara's hand when he punches Accelerator does not fly towards him and instead the momentum of the punch does? This is certainlynot the case with bullets, when the field switches their directions, they fly away, not the momentum of theirs. But in anime it is shown that when Kihara sends a punch to Accelerator, when he executed his trick, it's not his fist what goes towards Accelerator after being switched by the shield, but the momentum. Thois seems to leave much room for speculation (for example, would the field even classify a hand, of any velocity ""non-harmful""? We never see in the anime and in other materials as far as I can tell from Indexpedia anyone touch Accelerator in a non-harmful way (aside from when Accelerator magines what a normal childhood would be like in Railgun S, but this is obviously in his head).   So far, it seems there is not enough information but as far as I see, @Ryan's theory seems to be the most plausible one. "
4106,Can only men pass on the will of D.?,"So I was wondering how the will of D. is passed on. We have seen three cases where the will of D. was shown to be passed on and they were all from generation to generation by birth. Luffy got it from Dragon, Dragon got it from Garp and Ace got it from Roger (and Rouge?). In each case the will was passed on along with the last name. Now this made me wonder. Is it merely in a name? Or is there more to it?  Ace would probably be the best example. He chose to go through life using his mother's name Portgas D. Now what if Ace's mother would not have been a carrier, would Ace have not have had the will of D because of his name? Or what if Ace's mother married some other guy who didn't have the will of D, would she be unable to pass it on, because children are given their fathers name? This sounds pretty sexist to me, so it made me wonder whether just having the right surname is enough for someone to have the will of D or if there is some other way to become a D or to pass on the will of D?  If there isn't, the will of D will probably die out pretty soon... "
4107,What is negative red/positive blue chakra?,"Ok, so when Killer B was teaching Naruto the tailed beast bomb rasengan thing he mentioned the negative red chakra and the positive blue chakra. What does that mean? I thought there was only one type of chakra..  They haven't mentioned any negative or positive chakra before have they? Then what is it? "
4108,What exactly is Touhou Kinema-kan?,"I see a lot of unofficial anime-style Touhou opening and ending videos with something like ""Touhou Anime Kinema-kan"" mentioned in the title or description. For example:   Touhou Anime Motion Picture ~Second Curtain~ 2nd PV 【東方】 Touhou Hana Kagura【Anime Motion Picture 2nd Curtain #2】【東方】【HQ】 Touhou Anime Kinema-kan - ""東方白昼夢"" ToHo Daydream(FULL)   But I can't find a good description or explanation of what exactly Touhou Anime Kinema-kan is. What does Kinema-kan mean? What does it refer to? And what does 2nd Curtain refer to? Is there a 1st Curtain, 3rd Curtain, and so on?  All I can gleam from the video descriptions is that it seems to be something that was released at Comiket or Reitaisai, but I don't know much beyond that. "
4109,When was the Day of Severance?,"We know that the Day of Severance had to have happened some time after Kureha was born. Indeed, it must have occurred sometime after Ginko and Kureha became friends (i.e. after they met on the snowy battlefield past the Door to Friendship), since they could not have become friends in the first place had Severance already occurred.   We also know that the Day of Severance happened before episode 1 of the show, because, of course, that's how the narrative begins in the first place. I'm pretty sure that Severance was also before Ginko and Lulu met.  Can we pinpoint when the Day of Severance happened any more accurately (relative to other events in the story)? In particular, it's not clear to me whether the Day of Severance was before or after the day on which Reia sent Ginko back across the Door to Friendship.   (Or maybe I've got this all wrong? In episode 11, the way Kureha's classmates harass her about her friendship with bear-Ginko [during a flashback] seems to suggest that the Day of Severance had already happened - so does that mean that the Day of Severance even precedes the day on which Kureha went across the Door to Friendship to fetch Kureha from the snowy battlefield?) "
4110,What happened to Yuki and Inaho's parents?,Yuki and Inaho are orphans by the time Aldnoah.Zero opens. Do we know what happened to their parents? Or are we just to assume they died in the mess surrounding Heaven's Fall?  Some have speculated that Saazbaum could somehow have been Inaho's father (given that Saazbaum and Orlane descended to Earth right around the time of Inaho's birth). Is that plausible? 
4111,Is Nadia voluntarily inspired by Castle in the Sky?,"It is pretty obvious that Nadia and Castle in the Sky shared a lot of their basic premise: both of them feature a girl who owns a mysterious glowing blue pendant, meets a boy who is interested in flying machines, and is chased both by a small pirate band and a sizeable military power. Other similarities are pretty obvious once one has seen both.  Was that level of similarity in Nadia due to a conscious or inconscious influence from Castle in the Sky? Did it come from a common origin? "
4112,How do the citizens of Arcanretia know that Aqua purified their hot springs?,"Starting in s02e09, Aqua is accused of purifying the hot springs in Arcanretia.  In the meta sense, we can tell the difference by the animated color (green for hot spring, clear/blue for regular water), and that Aqua is known to be able to purify water simply by wading into it, as we learned in s01e05.  It's never mentioned how any of the citizens would know that.  Here in reality, mineral water is the same color as tap water.  How would the citizens of Arcanretia know that the hot spring water was purified into regular water?  Note: This is a followup question to What is the difference between hot spring water and regular hot water?, not a duplicate of it. "
4113,Why do Rebecca's breasts appear polished/shiny?,"I don't understand this image:     If you look at her headgear, you'll see that it's polished and has that clean shine. But what's up with her breasts? They appear to be shining or they look polished, just like her helmet. I don't watch One Piece. So I don't know if she has shiny breasts, or if she polishes them. Can someone please enlighten me? "
4114,Why is Midoriya's power so low according to the official character book?,"According to the official character book or Boku no Hero Academia Wikia, Midoriya power is 1/5. However, other students have powers much higher than him:   Yuga 2/5 Tenya 4/5 Eijiro 4/5 Denki 3/5 Fumikage 2/5 Shoto 5/5 Katsuki 5/5   This doesn't make sense. Midoriya is supposed to have the most powerful quirk, One for All. In the battle with Shoto, when they clashed, they were almost even.   How does this power level from the official character book makes sense? I could understand if he doesn't have 6/5 (like All Might) but maybe 5/5 like Shoto or Katsuki or 4/5 (barely under Shoto since in their battle they clashed and Shoto won for a little), but certainly not 1/5.  Why is Midoriya power so low according to the official character book? "
4115,Why can Sonic become a Super Saiyan like Goku?,"I watched an animation about Sonic, and that hedgehog became a Super Saiyan using diamond shaped stuff.  What actually is that? How can Sonic become like that? "
4116,"What will happen if one of the guardians (cloud, sun, rain etc.) dies?","What would happen if one of the guardians died in a fight with another mafia family? For example: the vongola rain guardian of the 8th generation dies and everyone else is still alive..  Would the family/the boss just search a new one and replace him? Or would the place stay ""free"" until the next generation of guardians/bosses will selected? if that's the case: would be the boss (of the vongola family for example) stay alone if all guardians die? or will he just select new ones and stay as the boss? "
4117,Is the weird transition after the fight between Ichigo and Grimmjow deliberate?,"I recently got to the episode in the anime where Ichigo fought with Grimmjow in Hueco Mundo after Inoue healed them both.  However, even though the episode ends at the scene where it looked like Ichigo was about to beat Grimmjow, in the next episode, they were back in ""the real world"" and the events in Hueco Mundo haven't been mentioned for a couple of episodes now.  Is it just me or is this a weird transition in the storyline? Or is there a higher purpose in such transition and it will somehow make sense later? "
4118,How was Sato able to provide so many internal organs in Ajin Demi Human?,"In Ajin: Demi Human, Sato is able to trade internal organs for military weapons and guns. Initially I thought that he was just using his own organs, as when he brought more he mentions ""He has a lot more guys now"".  But seeing how the organs disintegrate when they are left behind/regrown, was he just taking them from the civilians/police they killed?  Or where did Sato get the internal organs from? "
4119,Who the saiyajins got the scouters from?,"The saiyajins were a primitive race without technology. Freezer's army use scouters, so you could think saiyajins got the scouters from Freezer. But when Kaiosama tells Goku the story of the saiyajin, in a flashback, the tsufurujins when fighting the primitive saiyajins are seen using scouters. So who the saiyajins got the scouters from? Freezer/Freezer army, the tsufurujins or any other race? "
4120,Why did Bartholomew Kuma allow Vegapunk to turn him fully into a pacifista?,"   Kuma seems to have a good enough relationship with Vegapunk. Vegapunk was able to grant him his final wish as a human being, which was to program Kuma to protect the Straw Hats ship until their return. It is very likely that Vegapunk highly respects Kuma's strength, as he modified Kuma to be the prototype Pacifista, and he let Kuma do things that go against the World Government, as well as granting him his last wish by including a mission into his programming that Kuma himself had requested.   It is even shown that the bible he holds is his trademark. If that is true why would he sacrifice his consciousness along with his humanity if he lived life cherishing something that very much so represented humanity, freedom and free will?  If he much admired the prospect of free will, going as far as wanting his last wish to protect the Straw Hats ship, why would he even agree to losing his humanity and getting modified to a fully-fledged Pacifista?  Is it ever mentioned or is it just some extremely personal relationship stuff shared between Vegapunk and Kuma? "

4122,Why was the Osiris Egyptian God Card translated as Slifer the Sky Dragon?,"In the Yu-Gi-Oh Abridged parody, the names of the three Egyptian God Cards are:   Obelisk the Tormentor  Slifer the Executive Producer and Mega Ultra Chicken   The second name is a reference to a producer of the Yu-Gi-Oh English dub, who is also called Slifer (Roger Slifer, to be exact). I thought that this was just a funny little coincidence that Little Kuriboh picked up on and made a pun out of.   But then, I looked up the actual names of the Egyptian God Cards on the Yu-Gi-Oh wikia:   Obelisk the Tormentor |     オベリスクの巨神兵 (lit. Giant Divine Soldier of Obelisk) Slifer the Sky Dragon | オシリスの天空竜 (lit. Sky Dragon of Osiris) The Winged Dragon of Ra | ラーの翼神竜 (lit. Winged Divine Dragon of Ra)   Huh? ""Slifer the Sky Dragon"" is called ""Osiris the Sky Dragon"" in the original Japanese. That... actually makes way more sense, because Osiris is an Egyptian God in real life. So, was Slifer an intentional reference to Roger Slifer made by the official translators?  I notice that most of the other languages use ""Slifer"" as well (including French, German, Italian, Spanish, etc.), and only the Chinese and Korean translations use ""Osiris"". What happened here? Why did the translators make this decision? "
4123,Did Best Jeanist die after All for One attack?,"After this attack,    I thought Best Jeanist have died, and it's hard to imagine how could he have survived that attack and that hole in the stomach, but later Kamui Woods recovers his body along with Mt Lady. It doesnt make much sense to recover a dead body in the middle of a fierce battle, so, what happened after it? Did Best Jeanist die after All for One attack or not? "
4124,What exactly were the DJ Condor segments supposed to be?,"After watching to the end of the anime of Oretachi ni Tsubasa wa Nai, I still don't entirely understand the DJ Condor segments. They seemed to be some sort of radio narration of the story, but also had a great deal of stuff that was clearly not actually occurring. The end-of-episode previews were mostly stuff from the next episode, but the segments at the beginning of the episodes seemed usually disjoint from the story and random. They're mostly inconsistent with the story as they involve characters interacting who have never actually met (as far as I could tell).  Is there some reasonable canonical interpretation for what these segments are supposed to mean (either based on the anime or the VN), or are the just totally random? Does it have to do with      Youji hiding in the abyss of his own mind?    "
4125,Where does Code Geass: Boukoku no Akito fall in the story line?,"I just finished the second OVA, and I have some doubts. Are the OVAs a spin-off of the series? If not, when in the story line are they set? Are they before R2 or after?.   There is a scene in the second OVA where we see Lelouch and Susaku in a train. Lelouch seems to be pretty hurt, and Suzaku looks at him with indifference. At the end of the second OVA they get out of the train and Lelouch calls himself as ""Julius ...something."" This actually blew my mind. I thought that the first scene was a connection with the end of the first season (when Suzaku and Lelouch fire each other), but apparently not.   What is the connection with this scenes? Or are the OVAs an spin-off? "
4126,Where there any other Master who didn't know their Servant's identity from the start?,"In Fate/Zero it seems to be implied that all the Masters, from the moment they started working with them, knew the identity of their Servants.  i known however that   in Fate/Stay Night    Shirou didn't learn Saber's identity until much later because it was feared that if he was captured he wouldn't be able to defend against mind reading magic Rin didn't learn Archer's at first because the summoning went wrong and messed up his memories however he continued to withhold it when he did remember who he was  in Fate/Extra   Hakuno didn't know the identity of his/her Saber, Archer or Caster until the final couple of weeks but i am not sure how many of the Masters they faced off knew their Servant's Identities at the start (though i get the feeling Rin, Leo and Rani knew)    so in all the Grail Wars (Fuyuki (Fate/Stay Night), Snowfield (Fate/Strange Fake), Moon Cell (Fate/Extra), Trifas (Fate/Apocrypha), Tokyo (Fate/Prototype), Caubac Alcatraz's Labyrinth (Fate/Labyrinth) etc.) where there any other Master who didn't know their Servant's identity at the beginning? if not at all? "
4127,How is the concept of aura in Hunter x Hunter?,"I have watched HxH 2011 around 1 year ago.  I still wonder how's the concept of aura in HxH? How many types of aura and what kind of each speciality?     e.g. Enhancer, Manipulator, Specialist, etc.   Can someone explain it? "
4128,What happened to the Shinigami Zellogi?,"In the ninth episode of Death Note, a Shinigami, Zellogi, decides to ""check out on Ryuk"":    A conversation with another group of Shinigami goes like this:     -Who'd want Ryuk as a pet? He's not even cute.      -Haha, you're right.      -So, what kind of human is it? Male or female?      -Who knows. I wonder.      -I'll find out myself.   I imagined that he would go to the human world and make some appearance there, but as far as I know, he doesn't. What happened to him? What did he do? "
4129,What if natsu ate a star?,"Admittedly, I'm only 60 something episodes in, so this may already have an answer.  However, as hypothetical as this may be, due to the fact it seems impossible, I'm simply curious what hardcore Fairy Tail fans think might happen if Natsu were able to eat the fire of a star? Just how strong might he become? How much might his physical form change? Would a star's gaseous fire even be compatible? If you've got the knowledge, I wouldn't mind someone applying some ""scifi"" theoretical science and possibly even math to the answer. Looking for a great read of an answer! Good luck and thank you! "
4130,Which version of Rumoosh died?,"Note: it's impossible not to spoil in the title. Behind there are more spoilers of Dragon Ball Super Manga 21      In Dragon Ball Super manga 21 Gowasu dies. I'm confused with all the future timelines thing, so my question is, since when a kaioshin dies his god of destruction also dies, which version of Rumoosh died? Isnt the Rumoosh we see alive in the Dragon Ball Super tournament anime?  "
4131,What is the origin of the one-horned rabbit so common in fantasy and isekai stories?,"Dozens of fantasy and isekai stories have the one-horn-rabbit as a staple beginner's monster.

(web novel ch. 22) Nidoume no Jinsei wo Isekai de (ch. 23) Saikyou no Shokugyou wa Yuusha demo Kenja demo naku Kanteishi (Kari) rashii desu yo? (ch. 2)   What is the origin of this monster, and why is it so common? "
4132,"Why are titles in Touhou often formatted like ""Japanese title ~ English subtitle""?","I've noticed that a lot of Touhou games, music, and print works seem to have titles that consist of a Japanese part and an English part, where the two are separated with a tilde.  For example, most of the main game titles follow this pattern, although some of the .5 games seem to use ""Japanese title ~ Japanese subtitle"" instead?  - TH06: 東方紅魔郷　～ the Embodiment of Scarlet Devil - TH07: 東方妖々夢　～ Perfect Cherry Blossom - TH07.5: 東方萃夢想　～ Immaterial and Missing Power - TH08: 東方永夜抄　～ Imperishable Night - TH09: 東方花映塚　～ Phantasmagoria of Flower View - TH09.5: 東方文花帖　～ Shoot the Bullet - TH10: 東方風神録　～ Mountain of Faith - TH10.5: 東方緋想天 ～ Scarlet Weather Rhapsody - TH11: 東方地霊殿　～ Subterranean Animism - TH12: 東方星蓮船　～ Undefined Fantastic Object - TH12.3: 東方非想天則　～ 超弩級ギニョルの謎を追え - TH12.5: ダブルスポイラー　～ 東方文花帖 - TH12.8: 妖精大戦争　～ 東方三月精 - TH13: 東方神霊廟　～ Ten Desires - TH13.5: 東方心綺楼　～ Hopeless Masquerade - TH14: 東方輝針城　～ Double Dealing Character - TH14.3: 弾幕アマノジャク　～ Impossible Spell Card - TH14.5: 東方深秘録　～ Urban Legend in Limbo - TH15: 東方紺珠伝　～ Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom - TH15.5: 東方憑依華　～ Antinomy of Common Flowers - TH16: 東方天空璋　～ Hidden Star in Four Seasons   Lots of songs from the main game series have tildes in them as well. There are a number of songs that don't follow the pattern though, so the following is only a subset of all the main game themes:  - TH06 (EoSD):     - 上海紅茶館　～ Chinese Tea     - ラクトガール　～ 少女密室     - 月時計　～ ルナ・ダイアル     - 紅楼　～ Eastern Dream... - TH07 (PCB):     - 妖々夢　～ Snow or Cherry Petal     - 無何有の郷　～ Deep Mountain     - 人形裁判　～ 人の形弄びし少女     - 幽霊楽団　～ Phantom Ensemble     - 東方妖々夢　～ Ancient Temple     - 広有射怪鳥事　～ Till When?     - 幽雅に咲かせ、墨染の桜　～ Border of Life     - 少女幻葬　～ Necro-Fantasy     - 妖々跋扈　～ Who done it!     - さくらさくら　～ Japanize Dream... - TH08 (IN):     - 永夜抄　～ Eastern Night     - 幻視の夜　～ Ghostly Eyes     - 蠢々秋月　～ Mooned Insect     - 夜雀の歌声　～ Night Bird     - 懐かしき東方の血　～ Old World     - 永夜の報い　～ Imperishable Night     - 少女綺想曲　～ Dream Battle     - シンデレラケージ　～ Kagome-Kagome     - 狂気の瞳　～ Invisible Full Moon     - 千年幻想郷　～ History of the Moon     - 竹取飛翔　～ Lunatic Princess     - エクステンドアッシュ　～ 蓬莱人     - Eternal Dream　～ 幽玄の槭樹 - TH09 (PoFV):     - 花映塚　～ Higan Retour     - 春色小径　～ Colorful Path     - 東方妖々夢　～ Ancient Temple     - 狂気の瞳　～ Invisible Full Moon     - 幽霊楽団　～ Phantom Ensemble     - もう歌しか聞こえない　～ Flower Mix     - ポイズンボディ　～ Forsaken Doll     - 今昔幻想郷　～ Flower Land     - 彼岸帰航　～ Riverside View     - 六十年目の東方裁判　～ Fate of Sixty Years     - 魂の花　～ Another Dream... - TH10 (MoF):     - 人恋し神様　～ Romantic Fall     - 厄神様の通り道　～ Dark Road     - 芥川龍之介の河童　～ Candid Friend     - フォールオブフォール　～ 秋めく滝     - 妖怪の山　～ Mysterious Mountain     - 御柱の墓場　～ Grave of Being     - 神さびた古戦場　～ Suwa Foughten Field     - 神は恵みの雨を降らす　～ Sylphid Dream - TH11 (SA):     - 封じられた妖怪　～ Lost Place     - 少女さとり　～ 3rd eye     - 死体旅行　～ Be of good cheer!     - 霊知の太陽信仰　～ Nuclear Fusion     - エネルギー黎明　～ Future Dream... - TH12 (UFO):     - 感情の摩天楼　～ Cosmic Mind     - 空の帰り道　～ Sky Dream - TH13 (TD):     - 聖徳伝説　～ True Administrator - TH14 (DDC):     - 輝く針の小人族　～ Little Princess     - 始原のビート　～ Pristine Beat - TH15 (LoLK):     - ピュアヒューリーズ　～ 心の在処 - TH16 (HSiFS):     - 秘神マターラ　～ Hidden Star in All Seasons.   Tilde usage for songs seems to have decreased for more recent games?  The titles of most of ZUN's music albums seem to follow this pattern as well. For example:  - 蓬莱人形　～ Dolls in Pseudo Paradise - 蓮台野夜行　～ Ghostly Field Club - 夢違科学世紀　～ Changeability of Strange Dream - 卯酉東海道　～ Retrospective 53 minutes - 大空魔術　～ Magical Astronomy - 鳥船遺跡　～ Trojan Green Asteroid - 伊弉諾物質　～ Neo-traditionalism of Japan - 燕石博物誌　～ Dr. Latency's Freak Report - 旧約酒場　～ Dateless Bar ""Old Adam""   Additionally, some of the print works seem to have a binomial nomenclature thing going on:  - 東方儚月抄:     - 東方儚月抄　～ Silent Sinner in Blue     - 東方儚月抄　～ Cage in Lunatic Runagate     - 東方儚月抄　～ 月のイナバと地上の因幡 - 東方三月精:     - 東方三月精　～ Eastern and Little Nature Deity     - 東方三月精　～ Strange and Bright Nature Deity     - 東方三月精　～ Oriental Sacred Place     - 東方三月精　～ Visionary Fairies in Shrine - 東方茨歌仙　～ Wild and Horned Hermit - 東方鈴奈庵　～ Forbidden Scrollery   Spell card names also sometimes seem to have a binomial nomenclature thing going on, though with quotation marks instead of tildes. For example, Flandre's spell cards in EoSD:  - 禁忌:     - 禁忌「クランベリートラップ」     - 禁忌「レーヴァテイン」     - 禁忌「フォーオブアカインド」     - 禁忌「カゴメカゴメ」     - 禁忌「恋の迷路」 - 禁弾:     - 禁弾「スターボウブレイク」     - 禁弾「カタディオプトリック」     - 禁弾「過去を刻む時計」 - 秘弾「そして誰もいなくなるか？」 - QED「495年の波紋」   Is there an explanation or system or backstory behind this tilde naming convention?

4133,"Did the Makers of the Lupin III ""Red-Jacket"" Series get Permission to Feature Superman?","In one of the Episodes of the Lupin III part 2 ""Red-Jacket"" series, Lupin foils a scheme by Fujiko who has henchmen impersonating Superman to rob banks.   I am curious if anyone has any information on whether this was technically allowed by DC, and if so, why?  If it wasn't allowed, then why is Crunchyroll.com able to screen this episode?  Here is the imdb page for the episode. There is another earlier episode of the same series that also mentions Superman. [website]"
4134,"What is the meaning of ""Cross"" in the title Cross Ange?","""Ange"", apart from the obvious reference to the main character, also means ""angel"" in French and implies the connection between Ange and Vilkiss, which has an angel sculpture on its head. This connection also extends to the full title Cross Ange: Rondo of Angels and Dragons, which foreshadows the end of Ange's journey, as seen in the last few episodes.  However, ""Cross"" doesn't quite make sense in the title. According to the preview at the end of episode 24, subtitle by CrunchyRoll:     What the hell did ""Cross"" in Cross Ange mean, anyway?      Ange is always cross, I guess?      It's a pun?!   1 Cross in this context means ""angry or annoyed"", according to Oxford Learner's Dictionary.  While it somewhat makes sense, this seems to be a liberal translation to match the fact it is a pun in Japanese.  What is the original explanation in Japanese? Is there any other official explanation of what ""Cross"" mean in the title? "
4135,"In ADV's ""Class album: The Complete Azumanga Daioh"" 5-disc box set, why are the episodes distributed 5-4-5-5-7?","This is just a small thing that I've been wondering about for a while now.  In ADV's 2005 release of ""Class album: The Complete Azumanga Daioh"", the episodes are distributed as follows:   1st disc: 5 episodes (1-5) 2nd disc: 4 episodes (6-9) 3rd disc: 5 episodes (10-14) 4th disc: 5 episodes (15-19) 5th disc: 7 episodes (20-26)   This seems a bit odd. It looks like they crammed 7 episodes into the last disc when the second disc still had room. Normally, you'd expect a more even distribution such as 5-5-5-5-6. Is there a reason why it was distributed this way? "
4136,What would happen if you died in normal SAO before the Kayaba announcement?,"This might be a bit out of a place-question, but does anyone happen to know what used to happen after dying in Sword Art Online before the Kayaba announcement that if you die, you will die in the real world? The players most likely respawned, but what about all of their progress? Would they have to beat all the levels and all the bosses again and start from the starting town, or could there have been a checkpoint system so you would not lose ALL the progress? "
4137,Is the gun mention a subtitling error?,"I'm rewatching the Naruto Chuunin exams, and in the Crunchyroll subs in episode 40, when it's being explained by Zaku's arms blew out, the explanation mentions gun barrels. However, as per this answer, there are no guns in Naruto. I don't remember the Japanese word for gun or gun barrel, and my listening isn't good enough to tell what they're saying in this particular part. Is this simply a subtitling error, or do they actually use a gun analogy in this case? If they do use a gun analogy in the anime, do they use the same analogy in the Japanese manga--that is, do they canonically explain the result using a gun analogy despite the lack of guns in Naruto?

4142,Did Yugi duel against a prerecorded Pegasus or the real one?,"In the duel between Yugi and Pegasus using the videotape, supposedly every Pegasus move was pre-recorded before the fight; during the first half of the duel, Pegasus used subliminar message by insert images into some frames to make Yugi choose certain types of monsters, so Pegasus theoretically would play the correct card to defeat him every turn. However we also know this is a Shadow Game, so Pegasus could use supernatural effects instead of just manipulating Yugi using the frames or predict his moves due to his knowledge of game and Yugi's strategies. So he (or his recording) can in thesis uses his Millenium Eye - according to the wiki he did it:     Secretly Pegasus was using his Millennium Eye to read Yugi's mind.   However, the timing of Yugi's turn durations and Pegasus turn durations seems to be so synchronized to be a duel against a pre-recorded tape. On the other hand, if it's not a pre-recorded tape, then how Pegasus would be prepared to duel Yugi in the exact day and hour he starts to watch it? It would be ridiculous to think about the long-haired businessman waiting all the time until Yugi put the tape in his video. But the wiki article suggests that the tape is more than a single tape, allowing instant communication between the one in the tape:     Although it appeared to contain a prerecording, people on the tape were able to communicate with people watching as if they were present at the same time and location as them.    I can't find in the manga a definite clarification if the duel was against a pre-recorded Pegasus or the real Pegasus in the same time, being able to communicate due to his Millenium Item effects over the tape. Is there any official explanation, be it in the manga or another source, about what really happened in this duel? "
4143,Does the Edo Tensei caster need to know all the hand seals to use the reanimated person?,"Is it necessary for, for example, Kabuto (the Edo Tensei user) to know all the hand seals and adequate knowledge on other techniques to control and fully utilize the reanimated person per his wish?  Or is it just a matter of ""controlling a person somehow and use him""? What I observe is even when being controlled physically, mentally the reanimated character is reluctant (sometimes except few exceptions). Then, if the mind is not under Edo Tensei user's control, how does controlling work? "
4144,Why was Grandpa Gohan never revived with the Dragon Balls?,"I was recently re-watching DBZ dub episode 171 about how Gohan got his name, tree he crashed through as a kid etc. And a thought came to mind.   Why didn't we ever see Grandpa Gohan in DBZ? I mean there were plenty of scenarios where goku could have found him in other world or the Z-fighters could have revived him with the Dragon Balls.   And in addition to that IIRC, They wished for all the humans killed by the saiyan invasion to be revived, wouldn't that also account Grandpa Gohan since he was accidentally killed by Goku in his oozaru form?   "
4145,Does handwritten speech indicate anything?,"I'm reading the manga for Fate Stay Night, and there's a part on page 15 of chapter 1 where the speech bubbles are handwritten and rather than in the normal manga font. As you can see, this is only for speech, not for the other text boxes, and is only on this page.     Other font styles (like bolded font) are used to indicate things like intense speaking, but it's not clear if this is supposed to indicate something like that. Is it? If not, why is just that dialogue handwritten? "
4146,Chain Chronicle viewing order?,"What is the best order to watch the 3 movies and the TV series of Chain Chronicle?  Is there any part that can be skipped (i.e. a movie is a compilation of the first 6 episodes, etc)? "
4147,"Besides the mecha, space and aldnoah technology displayed in the show, how technologically advanced is Vers compared to 2014' real world Earth?","Vers was colonized in 1980 according to the official timeline. Since Rayregalia cut ties with Earth shortly after, lets assume the scientific development was split, save for the occasional espionage or exchange.  There is much Mecha, space and aldnoah technology on screen, but what about the other fields? They should be really advanced in physics (having firsthand opportunity to build those special mecha), but in some ways it seems they have regressed. Like in social sciences.  How is Vers' knowledge, compared to our own? "
4148,"Why does ""merk"" mean ""meld""? Is it Japanese, or Hymmnos, or something else?","Why does ""merk"" mean ""meld""? Is it Japanese, Hymmnos, or something else?  According to the EXA_PICO Universe Wiki's Grathmeld article, in the original Japanese, it's グラスメルク, or ""Glassmerk""?  Ar tonelico Qoga: Knell of Ar Ciel Original Soundtrack Disc 2: Song 24 is originally titled as Merk~Tilia in English letters, which makes me think it's Hymmnos. A translation is Meld~Tilia.  I haven't seen any ""merk"" entry in any Hymmnos vocabulary list, so I'm not sure what language ""merk"" is from.  Although, I suppose it could be a distortion of ""make"" or something, if it is Hymmnos? "
4149,Who writes the Dragon Ball Heroes anime?,"So, it's known Akira Toriyama doesnt write the Dragon Ball Heroes directly or indirectly (such as he did with Dragon Ball Super), so, if it isnt Akira Toriyama who makes it, who is or are the persons behind it? is it someone who worked in Dragon Ball movies or animes (Dragon Ball GT or whatever) before, or is/are they completely new writers? "
4150,Why didn't Suzuha mention the destruction of Nakabachi's paper in Episode 23 (β)?,"In the original Steins;Gate episode 23 (after the events of Steins;Gate 0), it is understandable that Suzuha didn't mention the destruction of Nakabachi's paper because she already knows that Okabe must fail the first attempt to save Kurisu. After that, she mentions about it in the second attempt.  However, in Episode 23 (β), no second attempt is planned, therefore she should mention it from the beginning, right?  Why didn't Suzuha mention the destruction of Nakabachi's paper (stolen from Kurisu) in Episode 23 (β)? "
4151,Does Naruto only have the wind chakra nature?,Does Naruto have only the wind chakra nature?  If he doesn't then why doesn't he use any different chakra nature besides the Rasen Shuriken?  
4152,Does Tyria have Maid Droids too?,"Both Shurelia and Frelia have similar looking Maid Droids like Meimei and Kanade (AKA Child of Light) for Shurelia and has Riki and Reki for Frelia.  But looking at Tyria who is the third Reyvateil Origin i don't recall see a pair of Maid Droids for her. Who are her Maid Droids? or if she doesn't have any, why doesn't she when the other 2 do? "
4153,What's with the fantasy hair?,"All Out!! is a sports series about high school rugby. The teams are large, so there are many characters. I understand that the mangaka and character designers want to make each character stand out. They do a great job here. But a few stand out much more than others, due to what I think of as fantasy hair:     (ULC) Oharanu Etsugo -- ""antennae hair"", two small hair groups sticking straight up (URC) Ebumi Masaru -- ""anchor hair"", two somewhat bigger hair groups sticking left and right from bottom of his head. He also stands out due to eyes often wild and almost constantly angry expressions. (LLC) Ise Natsuki -- ""horn-hair"", they even manage to stick out of his helmet! (Rugby helmets have holes; his holes must be magically located.) (LRC) Sekisan Takuya -- ""ribbon hair"", curly ribbons of hair at various angles   Are any of these styles something a Japanese teenager would actually wear? (Are some of them even possible?) Except for someone from another team commenting that Sekisan has really wild hair, these fantasy styles are treated as normal looks. The styles definitely help the characters stand out. With three tall blonds on the team, it is nice that two of them have unique appearances. Is blond hair fairly common among Japanese teenagers?  The strange thing is that the series is reality based; no-one has a beyond-human-capability ability or genius move. For example, another series might have a character grow up on a dairy farm, and now he has an unbreakable grip on the rugby ball due to 10 years of milking a dozen cows twice daily by hand. In All Out!! there is nothing but tough training and a great coach.  It is just ... it's just ... the fantasy hair, man.  related: Name of hair style with one strand sticking upwards and Is there a reason for the &quot;Hair of Death&quot; hair style? "
4154,Does Dragonball super have only 1 underworld? Or one per universe?,One thing I'm not sure about with the introduction of the different universes is: Does Dragonball super have only 1 underworld/afterlife? Or 1 per universe? 
4155,"Where does ""time patrol Goku"" come from?","In Dragon Ball Heroes there is a ""time patrol"" Goku. Where does he come from? He doesnt come from Dragon Ball Super or Dragon Ball GT. Was he created for the Dragon Ball Heroes videogame or manga or does he come from another Dragon Ball videogame? Where does ""time patrol Goku"" come from?   "
4156,"Approximately when is the story of ""Boku no Hero Academia"" set?","As nearly as I can tell, the events of ""Boku no Hero Academia"" seem to begin some time around 2174.  I base this estimation upon the manga having been begun in 2014 and the current All Might being the 8th such hero (and taking an assumed average of 20 years per generation between passings-on of their power).  Is there a definitive answer for this?  If not, are there canon facts, observed trends, or even fan-based assumptions that might at least weigh to the contrary (whether earlier or later than 2174)? "
4157,Are the ice skaters in Yuri On Ice based on real life counterparts?,I watched the first few episodes of Yuri On Ice! and my girlfriend who iceskates said that she thought that the character Yuri Plisetsky really reminded her of Yulia Lipnitskaya in that they shared similar features and backgrounds.   Are they connected? What about the other characters? 
4158,How does the Tetsujin 28 movie fit into the series?,"I'm referring specifically to the 2004 Tetsujin 28 spin-off and the accompanying 2007 movie Tetsujin 28: Morning Moon of Mid-day. You'd think that the movie must be early in the TV series because of the characters:      Ryuusaku Murasame is still alive in the movie   but at the end of the movie      Chief Chloroform was killed, when he was seen in the TV series well after Ryuusaku was killed   Also the whole thing with Shotaro's ""brother"" doesn't even come up at all in the TV series.  Are the movie and TV series different continuities (though the description has them both adapted from the same Manga by Yokoyama Mitsuteru)? Or do they somehow fit together? "
4159,What is the extent of the power of the Dragon Balls?,"I have recently started watching Dragon Ball Z(Remastered Edition)* after a long break. There is this scene in S01E21 (Counting Down) in which Master Roshi and others summon the dragon to wish Goku back. Just before they can wish him back, Oolong (the pig) says:     Excuse me, Mr. Dragon could be possibly destroy the Saiyans that are on the way to Earth right about now.   to which the dragon replies:     Your wish cannot be granted because the guardian of Earth created me. I cannot grant a wish which exceeds his power.   Now, this has put me into dilemma. If the dragons' power was only limited to Earth, why was everyone around the universe after these Dragon Balls?  Here are few questions that bug me:   When the dragon says ""wish which exceeds his power"", does he mean that he can only use his powers on/for the Earthlings? If yes, how could they wish Goku back, because technically, he is not born on Earth? If not, why did destroying the Saiyans exceed the dragon's power? Everyone around the universe was searching for Dragon Balls because they could fulfill anyone's wish. Does it mean that it is not mandatory to be an Earthling, but it's compulsory to be on Earth to have your wish granted by the dragons? If yes, why didn't they ever wish to destroy the enemies after they had landed on Earth and within the effect of the dragons' power?  "
4160,Was it formerly common practice to credit voice actors in opening credits?,"The final OP for Monogatari Series Second Season (the Koimonogatari OP) is sort of an 80s-throwback sort of deal, with all the hallmarks of old anime styling - funky ""lens flares"", those old-school clouds, a song reminiscent of 80s-era pop, captioned lyrics - the works.   One particularly interesting feature of the OP is that it credits KAMIYA Hiroshi and SAITOU Chiwa as the voice actors of Koyomi and Hitagi, respectively.    No TV anime from the past two or three years that I have watched has (to the best of my recollection) credited a voice actor in the opening credits. The opening credits typically seem to be reserved for producers, directors, original creators, and people like that. Voice actors are, of course, credited in the ending credits, usually towards the beginning.     And so, the question: Was it more common back in, say, the 80s or thereabouts for voice actors to be credited in anime opening credits (in place of or in addition to the ending credits)?   (Or, alternatively, is this aspect of the presentation of the Koimonogatari OP just idiosyncratic / anachronistic / otherwise not in keeping with common practice from a few decades ago?) "
4161,What is the order for watching Lupin III?,"I want to watch Lupin III anime. I tried to search it and found in 2018 ( currently airing ) there is Lupin III part V. So i wanted to watch in order, like Lupin III part I. Checked on myanimelist site ( let's put aside first the spin off or movie )   Lupin III part 1 (?)(1971) Lupin III part 2 (1977) Lupin III part 3 (1980) Lupin III part 4 (?) (2015) Lupin III part 5 (???) (2018)   When i tried to watch the first part, it's long long ago tv series. And there is a gap 35 year until the next sequel from part 3 to part 4 (?) .  How should i watch Lupin in a proper way ? Should i watch the 1971 version first ? Or is there a remake of the series from part 1 to part 3 in early 2000 (Like evangelion and cardcaptor sakura ) ?  "
4162,Why do Asagi's eyes change color?,"Normally, Asagi seems to have reddish-orange eyes, but under certain circumstances they change to a bright red color. This happens, for instance, when she is hacking into the Nalakuvera. The change is a bit subtle and I'm not even sure if it's intended or if it's just a combination of different lighting and inconsistent animation, but it is at least noticeable. Here's a comparison shot with the two most extreme examples I could find:    Is this change actually occurring or is it an animation error? If it is real, what is the meaning behind her eyes changing color? "
4163,What is the difference between Kabuto's sage mode and Naruto's sage mode?,"So Kabuto and Naruto both can use nature energy to enhance themselves, in other words they can use sage mode but when Naruto uses it his eyes become like the eyes of a from. And when Kabuto uses it, HIS eyes become like the eyes of a snake.  So my question is-  What is the difference between those 2 sage modes? Why does one make a user resemble a frog and the other one makes him resemble a snake when both are using natural energy? "
4164,Why didn't Light use Shinigami eyes?,"Why didn't Light Yagami use the Shinigami eyes? Couldn't it have been an easy task for him? Was it his arrogance and overconfidence?   Alternatively, was he not willing to sacrifice half his lifespan, thinking it would be a loss for him?  Wouldn't it have been a wiser step to choose the Shinigami eyes and make life easier than playing and risking around his life?  "
4165,Does the anime adaptation of Absolute Duo deviate much from the light novel?,"From a quick scan through translated volumes of Absolute Duo on Baka Tsuki, it seems that the anime adapted up to Volume 5 - Chapter 2 (or a few more chapters ahead). However, looking at the illustrations, it seems that some content are not adapted in the anime.  What are the chapters missing from the anime adaptation? Within the adapted content, does the anime adaptation have any major deviation from the source material? "
4166,Could Eraserhead delete all All for One quirks at once?,"All for One is this powerful villain, who is almost unstoppable because he has and can use many quirks. Is there any reason why they never used Eraserhead to stop him by blocking all his quirks? Is this just a missing point in the plot or is there any limit to Eraserhead abilities or any quirk to All for One that makes him inmune to Eraserhead abilities? "
4167,How did Goku and Vegeta alone end up on Earth?,"How is it that only Goku and Vegeta ended up on Earth?  What happened to the other Saiyans?  Planet Vegeta was destroyed by Frieza, but which planet did Goku come from? "
4168,Can Byakuya overcome Aizen's Kyoka Suigetsu as easy as he overcomed Koga since both of them are based on illusion?,"     Byakuya breaks free and readies himself against Kōga, who is   determined to use his illusions on Senbonzakura as well. Before he can   attempt to do so, Byakuya activates his Bankai, Senbonzakura   Kageyoshi, and uses Senkei, which Byakuya notes will allow him to   overcome Kōga's illusions because his blades will always find Kōga.   The two clash evenly several times until Kōga uses his Spiritual   Threads to bind Byakuya once more. However, Senbonzakura has several   Senkei blades rain down and cut the threads, to Kōga's surprise.   Byakuya attacks him, but Kōga moves out of the way and wonders how   Byakuya can be so powerful. Though Byakuya and Senbonzakura explain   how their working in unison allows them to unleash their full power,   Kōga refuses to listen and proclaims his greatness was never   acknowledged.       [Bleach anime; Episode 252]   If Byakuya's Senkei will always find illusion based shinigami, does that mean he can overcome Aizen's Kyoka Suigetsu illusion just as easily with his Bankai? The war would be so much simpler with Byakuya, wouldn't it? Or there is something different with how Aizen's Kyoka Suigetsu work?  "
4169,"What does the ""teehee"" expression mean?","  I'm sure most of you know this phrase, what does it mean? Does it represent stupidity cutey thing that they do? What makes this phrase so popular? "
4170,Has there been a woman that Sanji did not get attracted to?,"As far as I have read One Piece, Sanji has not met any woman yet that he did not get attracted to (except okamas, old women and young girls). My question is, were all middle-aged women in the series supposed to be beautiful? Or does everyone look beautiful to Sanji? "
4171,What was Shoto Todoroki attack about?,"In the fight with Midoriya, Shoto didnt want to use his fire part of the quirk and attacked only with ice. His father warned him that he was going to reach a limit if he didnt, Midoriya pushed him, and after a flashback Shoto turned on his fire part. Then I dont understand very well what happened. It seems he sends an ice attack first that Midoriya dodges, and later he uses somehow his fire in the attack, but it isnt very clear how. What was Shoto Todoroki attack about? Did he just use fire, did he use a combination of fire with ice, did he use his ice part just to estabilize himself? How was it?     "
4172,How many quirks does All for One have?,"In the battle with All Might , All for One shows many quirks he has. Since I understand this is the last fight of All for One, are all his quirks shown in this battle? Is it known how many quirks does All for One have? "
4173,Which album has Steins; Gate OST 'Farewell' episode 21 version,"I love Steins; Gate OST 'Farewell' very much. I listen to the music again and again.  But I notice that There is another version of 'Farewell'. (It's not Suzuha.) The music was used in episode 21, when Okabe told Kurisu her death in Beta worldline. The music is different from original 'Farewell', it's more sad.  Where can I find the music? Is it official release? "
4174,Are there different types of sage modes?,"Why are some sage modes evil and make the user violent like Jugo's clan and Kabuto's sage mode? And why is Naruto's sage mode ""less dark"" ? Are there different types of sage modes? They all use natural energy so shouldnt they be the same? "
4175,What determines if someone going to Heaven or Hell?,"What determines if someone going to Heaven (reincarnate) or Hell (void)?  In episode 6, Harada was sent to void despite him repenting his attempt to kill Mayu. Yet, in episode 2, both Chisato and Shigeru was reincarnated, despite Chisato lying to Shigeru about her identity. Yes, Shigeru knows about her identity, but still she is lying to him.  So, what exactly determines the sentence? "
4176,What action is Yashiro supposed to take?,"In episode 3, Satoru tells his teacher to ""hurry up"" and do something about Hinazuki at the end of their conversation, and also states in the narration that he's ""positive Yashiro is waiting until spring vacation before taking action.""  I'm slightly confused. Yashiro earlier says that ""the Child Consultation Center visited their house three times."" I thus assumed that   The Child Consultation Center is already worried or suspicious (if they visited Hinazuki's home at all). Yashiro probably informed them about the abuse at Hinazuki's home. (Even if Yashiro didn't, they are already aware of the case.) The Child Consultation Center would be the party responsible for any further follow-up or protective measures, not Yashiro.   Am I wrong about this? If I am not wrong, what is it that Yashiro must hurry up and do? (Does he simply need to speed up things, given that the Child Consultation Center is ""so incompetent""?) "
4177,Where and when Mugiwara Crew's new bounty poster taken?,"After reading this question about why Sanji's bounty poster is drawn, not his real picture. I was just thinking about the bounty posters itself. I know that aside from Luffy, the rest of the crew's bounty posters are taken after Ennies Lobby arc.  But how about their bounty hunters picture after time skip?  I know it's probably when they are in dressrosa, but if I saw Sanji's and Chopper's posters, it's seems that their posters are taken in Sabaody Island. And also Franky's bounty poster taken when he's in Punk Hazard or Fishman Island because it's shown his Franky Shogun, not his true face. He only used Franky Shogun at Punk Hazard when battle with Buffallo and Baby 5 and when he's battle Fishman Pirate at Fishman Island.  So, I want to know where and when Mugiwara Crew's new bounty posters were taken? "
4178,"Cumber red ki, is his regular ki or is it a transformation?","In Dragon Ball, all saiyans have white/transparent ki with the exception of Vegita in a few chapters of Dragon Ball Z where he had light blue ki, and Goku Black who had black/violet/transparent ki before transforming into super saiyan Rose. What is Cumber red ki about then?  is Cumber red ki his regular ki or is it a transformation?   "
4179,Could Eri restore the One for All quirk to All Might?,"Supposedly, Eri has a quirk, Rewind, that allows her to rewind an individual's body to a previous state. She used this, for example, to undo the damage Izuku did to his own body when he used One for All at 100%. Could Eri restore the One for All quirk to All Might and also cure him from his injuries done by All for One? Or are there any obstacles for something like this to happen? "
4180,Where did the trope of yaoi hands start?,"There's a trope in yaoi manga of the character's having disproportionately large hands, often at least as big as their face.   Example of Yaoi Hands:    Where did this start? What was the first manga to do this? "
4181,Why didn't the magic emperor heal Asta?,"Oddly enough I was going to ask this yesterday after the Witches' Forest Arc but was doubtful since I was only at that part in the manga and my question might have been a little theoretical since I didn't know the full extent of the emperor's magic.  But now after the Royal Knights Arc we see the magic emperor himself face off against Licht and he uses his magic to reverse the flow of time and heal himself.  My question is why couldn't or why didn't he do the same for Asta's cursed arms or Fuegoleon's entire arm? We know he can restrict the flow of time in a specific area, why isn't he the greatest healer in a sense of should being able to revert a body to its previous state? "
4182,Can the Nine-Tails now leave Naruto's body at will?,"After Naruto and the Nine-Tails became friends, Naruto unlocked the seal.  Does that mean that the Nine-Tails can escape out of Naruto at his will whenever he wants?  If so, why doesn't he do so?  After helping him, couldn't they both go their separate ways?  If he were to leave, would Naruto die?  And while fighting Tobi in tailed beast mode, Naruto's seal was unlocked. Couldn't Tobi have used his Sharingan to control the Nine-Tails and force him out of Naruto, just like he did with Kushina when the seal was weakened during childbirth? "
4183,Why is Joker more powerful than other users?,"Joker, as a second generation user, is actually very powerful more than others of his generation.  As I understand, the ""skills"" acquired by second generation users depend on the person. In the case of Joker, he uses the cigars as a source of the fire.  Does this imply that other users can ""copy"" these techniques? Or is he different? "
4184,Awakening the Rinnegan,"To awaken the Rinnegan, can you just get any Uchiha's and Senju's chakra, mix them together and get the Rinnegan? Or do you need Ashura's and Indra's in particular (i.e. their reincarnation's)?    Do you still need to go through some very sad or aggreviating situation to awaken it, or do you automatically get it the moment you mix the two chakras together? "
4185,How did Frieza come to know of the dragon balls?,"I was watching Dragon Ball Z for the third time. When Vegeta after losing against Goku and others, comes back to Frieza's head quarters and recovers. There he comes to know that Frieza has already left to Namek, presumably to search for the dragon ballz. How did he come to know about them? Did I miss any episode or side story here or are we left to guess about it? "
4186,How can Naruto talk to the tailed beasts?,"How could Naruto talk to the tailed beasts while fighting Tobi? Was it because he was friends with Kurama now? If yes, then how could he talk to 4 tails? Because at that time he hadn't befriended Kurama.. "
4187,Were the Jail Scaglietti clones removed from all of The Numbers?,"At the end of Magical Girl Lyrical StrikerS, it's revealed that all of The Numbers had a clone of Jail Scaglietti in their wombs, so that in the event of his capture or death, as long as one of The Numbers escaped, his clone would be born with all his memories and knowledge, effectively allowing him to reborn.  A number of The Numbers were separated and imprisoned in different locations, while a group (who probably could be released and live normal lives like Subaru and Ginga) were in a separate facility near Ground Forces H.Q.  Were all the Jail Scaglietti clones removed from the wombs of The Numbers? Or only those who would be released, since the others would be imprisoned indefinitely? "
4188,Why did Cardfight Vanguard only change the OP Music but not the Animation?,"Around after Team Q4 lost the National Tournament (Episode 33) the OP for the series changed to feature a new Song, but with the Hanabee release (English Sub and Dub, actually watching the Sub rather than the Dub) it seems the subtitles were hard subs into the footage and thus you see a disconnect with what's on screen and what's in the song (ie. words appearing when there are no words in the song, clearly different words)  But why change the OP's music but leave the animation? if it was to cut cost on redoing the OP's animation wouldn't it then be argued it would have been better to keep the original OP's Music than change it? "
4189,Why couldn't Minato store the nine tails in a different way?,"Why couldn't in reality Minato store half of nine tails in Kushina and the other half in Naruto like in the filler ep 432? That way he and Kushina would have lived..  Or better, why couldn't he store the entire nine tails back in Kushina, prevent her from dying and sparing Naruto the trouble of becoming a jinnchuriki? "
4190,Are there censored or discarded Pokemon creatures and what are the motives behind it?,"After seeing some Youtube videos about censorship in Pokemon, it seems to me that the motives for it are based mainly on1:   Sexual content/innuendoes Violence (gore, mutilations, etc.) Religion references And others (offensive language, stereotypes, political matters, etc.)   I'm interested in knowing if there are censored or discarded Pokemon creatures, and if so, what are the motives behind it. Has Satoshi Tajiri published information about it?2    1 My knowledge about this topic mainly comes from creepypasta and other not too serious references (and also, those are in Spanish, so, I'm not sure if they would be accepted).  2 With the last statement I mean if Satoshi Tajiri approved or rejected the idea/fact of censoring his creations, or if he worked in the censored version, etc. "
4191,Confused about Obito's ability,"So Obito can transfer any of his body parts that are in contact with the enemy to the time-space of the Kamui and make it look like he cannot be touched.   But then in some of the fight scenes, for instance I remember when he was fighting Guy and Naruto, he was about to touch Naruto but guy kicked him from behind so he didn't solidify and let himself pass through Naruto and let Guy's kick pass through him. Well at that time, why did he even need to transport his hand too? Couldn't he just transport the part of his body that was about to be kicked by Guy and then touch Naruto?  Why did he transport his fingers using the Kamui too? It was completely unnecessary and he could have taken down Naruto if he didn't do that.. "
4192,What happened to Migi in the last episode?,What did actually Migi do in the last episode? I remember him saying about walking to a different path so he would sleep for a long time that he possibly won't wake up anymore. He could've stayed in Shinichi's hand as what he normally did and continue to coexist with humans like Uda and Jaw. But why should he do that? Was it for his own good? 
4193,How does All for One Impact Recoil quirk works?,"Supposedly All for One Impact Recoil quirk ""enables All For One to completely reflect the impact of an attack back to the attacker"". This seems to be the quirk used in season 3 episode 10 in the battle of All for One with All Might. If he can revert the impact of an attack back to the attacker, to use it all the time wouldn't turn the user invincible? Then why All for One doesnt use it all the time, does it have any flaws or drawbacks? "
4194,"Milk, regeneration properties for devil fruit users?","Does milk offer regenerative capabilities? I've never seen it in the anime but in the newest chapter 858 of the manga the following scene is shown.   Now, I haven't been reading the manga long I just started reading after the dressrosa arc but I watched the anime up to that point and I don't recall ever seeing anything like this.

4195,What does (present) Rin mouth when she sees her father and her past self at the shrine?,"At around 4:15 into Shelter, when present-Rin is witnessing her father and her past self visiting a shrine, she mouths something as her father walks past present-her. However, there is no voiceover here; the audio is just the piece ""Shelter"". What is she saying?  (I don't expect anybody will be able to lipread this, but maybe Robinson or someone else involved in the production has commented about it.) "
4196,Did zen-ohs play with real planets?,"Both zen-ohs were playing with planet-shape balls and they were being destroyed. Are those planets real? If so, why did they do that? They aren't gods of destruction and don't interfere with gods of destructions' job.  "

4200,Why did Minato's nine tails help in the fight?,I understand that Naruto's half of the nine tails had been befriended by Naruto but why did Minato's nine tails help? Wouldn't it make more sense that he would've resisted and didn't let Minato use chakra mode or tailed beast mode? 
4201,How did Homura get a bow as a weapon?,"In the last episode of Puella Magi Madoka Magica TV anime, Homura seems to have Madoka's bow. In earlier episodes, she only use guns and bombs, when and how did she get this weapon?  "
4202,What makes an anime a space opera?,"Recently, the Anime.SE Basement Anime club has finished watching Space Battleship Yamato 2199. After watching this, I've picked up on the term Space Opera. What elements of a show classify it as a Space Opera?  Would a more action-dense show like a Gundam series, also be considered a Space Opera? "
4203,Can we roughly determine the dates and duration of Otonashi's stay in the Afterlife World?,"In Otonashi's flashback in episode 9, he was on his way to take the National Center Test for University Admissions, held annually during a weekend in mid-January over a period of two days, when the train he boarded crashed. He took out his mobile phone to check the time and then realized that he was late for the test. Thus, we can conclude that January 15 was a Sunday and Otonashi left the real world on January 21 (Day 7).    Despite being a school-themed anime, there seemed to be little indication of time and the seasons in the Afterlife World when compared to the real world in the flashback episode, where we knew the exact dates (and even the days) of the incidents that were happening. Can we tell the date (or the time of the year) each episode occurred on from the activities the students were doing (or any other hint)? And can we possibly determine the duration of Otonashi's stay in the Afterlife World up till the last episode? "
4204,What is the Senju clan's speciality?,"Is it wood style? If yes, then how come only Hashirama can use it?  There has to be some special power that all the members of the Senju clan possessed, or else how could they be the greatest rivals to the Uchiha (who had Sharingan) who defeated every other clan other than the Senju? "
4205,Real story of Hampnie Hambart?,"In Sunday Without God, Ai's father takes his name from a story about a toy that continues to move for eternity after its spring breaks.

4206,How could Nunnaly see Lelouch's memories?,"    In the end, when Lelouch is about to die, Nunally holds his hands and is able to see his memories. How? The theory that Lelouch is immortal explains this, but that isn't official.   Is there any official explanation for this? "
4207,"Why is ""aku soku zan"" used in different animes?","In Rurouni Kenshin, Hajime Saitoh had a philosophy of life or something like that called ""aku soku zan"" that was something like ""kill the evil immediately"" which he mentions when fighting Makoto Shishio. Now in Dragon Ball Super Toppo says to Goku the same ""aku soku zan"". What is this really? Is this something from animes or the history of Japan or something? "
4208,How did Isaac and Miria became immortals?,"In one of the final episodes, Chez notices Isaac is immortal when he's trying to save him from falling off the train. Isaac also got shot, and beaten down.  However, he didn't drink the ""sake"" he and Miria stole from the mob, did he?  How did he and Miria became immortals? "
4209,"What does the top flag mean on the Japanese theatrical poster of ""From Up on Poppy Hill""?","In the Japanese theatrical poster of From Up on Poppy Hill designed and illustrated by Hayao Miyazaki, there is one flag before the two-letter signal (UW):    The flag looks like that which represents the number 1 in the International Code of Signals. However, looking up in the International Code of Signals (Revised 2003 United States Edition), I could not find the signal 1 UW, but only UW 1 (p. 89), meaning ""Thank you very much for your cooperation. I wish you a pleasant voyage"".  If it's not a numeral pennant, then is the flag what I think it is, the national flag of Japan? What are the signal flags as a whole supposed to mean? "
4210,Who is Mir's Mind Guardian?,"In Ar Tonelico 2: Melody of Metafalica, in the talk topic Mind Guardian? (Lv 3) when Croix asks if Mir has a Mind Guardian she says at one point     You are just unaware of her. You must have met her in my Cosmosphere by now   However after her ""story"" finishes Ayatane introduces himself as Mir's Guardian (he doesn't say Mind Guardian though).  Now according to this GameFAQs guide, the requirement to unlock this talk topic is     After completing Jacqli's Cosmosphere Lv 3   but I haven't seen anyone who could be a Mind Guardian but Ayatane. So who is Mir's Mind Guardian and where would Croix have met her before? "
4211,Didn't Supreme Kai know Beerus in the early episodes?,"In the current episodes of Dragon Ball Super Supreme Kai seems to know Beerus well because they are connected and share the same life force so, if one dies, the other does as well. However, in the early episodes of Dragon Ball Super Supreme Kai seems to know little to nothing about Beerus, and the elder Kai has to explain who he is. Is this a plothole or am I misunderstanding the situation in this episode?  [website]"
4212,Are the martial art techniques in Kenichi real?,"I've been wondering for a while are all the martial arts and martial art techniques in this series real? I used to be a former karate student, so I do know that the karate techniques used in the beginning 200~ chapters are legit.   As the series progressed, however, the karate techniques started to become a lot more complex and I have never even heard of them before.  Then they also started deviating from the standard martial arts and introduced some like pencak silat (which I never knew existed before).  If there are some fake styles or techniques, which ones are there*?   *Please don't use unreal fights to disprove. For example, when Akisame fought against that other master and they proceeded to counter-throw each others counter-throw, ultimately leaving them suspended in midair for half the chapter. The technique of a counter throw is real, but the manga just used it unrealistically. "
4213,Does Layla have some sort of connection to the X777 event?,"We all know that the dragons apparently disappeared in the year X777. At the same time, Lucy's mother, Layla Heartfilia, died at the age of 29. I don't know the cause of her death, it's just that I know she passed away at the same year.    Layla Heartfilia seemed to be a powerful Celestial mage given that she had three Golden keys (Aquarius, Capricorn, and Cancer; these three are pretty powerful too) and she probably had more than that (Silver keys or something).    It hasn't been mentioned whether Layla died the same day the dragons disappeared, just that it's the same year, or has it? So I was wondering, could she have had some sort of connection with the disappearance of the dragons?  Yes, the truth about the disappearance of the dragons has been revealed and all, but I still think that there's still something behind this.        Too bad the dragons can't reveal anything anymore.  "
4214,Is this proof than Piccolo is stronger than Trunks and Goten in DBZ?,"In Dragon Ball Z, when Goku was fighting ""Buutenks"" (not an official name), the kids lose the fusion inside Buu and Buu gets a caped Piccolo-like appearance. According to Japanese subtitles, Goku says to Buu: ""The half-pints have returned to normal from their fusion. Piccolo is coming out strongest"".   Is this proof that Piccolo was stronger than Trunks and Goten or is there something else in the series that shows otherwise?   [website]"
4215,Do Naruto and Sasuke lose their powers after the final battle?,"In chapter 698, Naruto and Sasuke have lost their hands which had the symbols given by the sage of six paths.   Does it mean that they lost the six paths power? Does Sasuke lose his rinnegan? "
4216,Why does Lady Kumaria look like Sumika?,"In the final episode of Yuri Kuma Arashi, Lady Kumaria regains her true form and appears before Kureha. Lady Kumaria clearly resembles Sumika Izumino, who was Kureha's girlfriend before she was killed by Mitsuko Yurizono.    What reason is there for this resemblance? The fan-made Wikia does state that:     Later, [Sumika] appears before Kureha as Lady Kumaria to turn Kureha into a bear and send Kureha and Ginko on a journey beyond severance.   This suggests that at least one person sees Sumika as being the same entity as Lady Kumaria. I have trouble seeing the idea of Sumika as Lady Kumaria incarnate as anything more than a stretch of the imagination; I do not recall any plot points or characterisation that make this an undoubtedly natural conclusion to have. (Sumika does indicate in her actions surrounding Kureha's birthday that she expects that they will be separated, and she does push Kureha in a positive direction. Such behaviour might be congruent with what I would expect of a benevolent deity made incarnate, but it's surely easier to explain this as being a result of Sumika's goodness and her classmates' actions.)  Alternatively, perhaps Lady Kumaria appears to girls in a form that is meaningful to them, but again, I lack any evidence that supports this to a reasonable degree.  Is there any official material &mdash; whether from the anime itself or from interviews or artbooks &mdash; that might shed light on these issues? "
4217,How come Naruto's Chakra responds to Wood Elements?,"Till now it's shown that Naruto is good in Wind Element alone but Naruto's Kyuubi chakra affected the Wood Style technique used by White Zetsu and even Captain Yamato's Wood Style.      If that's the case, then why can't Naruto use Wood Element technique? Why does Kyuubi chakra affect the Wood element alone?  "
4218,When will the airing of Fairy Tail episode 176 begin?,Will the series be aired again? If yes then when? 
4219,"Where does ""Accel World: Infinite burst"" fit into the story?",I've watched the Accel World anime and have gotten through a couple of the light novels but am not up to date.   Does the new movie follow after the anime? Or should I read the light novels before watching the movie? 
4220,Who exactly came out of Pandora's box?,"I vaguely remember the manga saying it was the Emperor that came out. So then my following questions is why won't they reveal what the Emperor truly looks like?  Also, how can there be two separate Emperors - one from Pandora's box and Chibi Emperor following Ogami around? Shouldn't they merge?  Who exactly did Pandora's box produce? "
4221,Why do characters always wear the same clothes?,"In most anime, most of the time, the characters wear the same clothes. Why is that?   I'm sure they are easier to draw but are there any other reasons? "
4222,Why does Tohru always try to get Kobayashi to eat pieces of her tail?,"In Kobayashi-san Chi no Maid Dragon, Tohru always tries to get Kobayashi to eat pieces of her tail. Why?  This started in episode 1 and has carried through to the current episode, with a mention/attempt almost every episode.  Is this a sign of affection for dragons? "
4223,Was Rem's warning fake?,"Rem warned Light not to hurt Misa or it would kill Light by writing his name in it's Deathnote, but Ryuk had mentioned in the last episode as well as before that either Ryuk would kill Light or that Light would die after living his natural lifespan. As Ryuk has to kill him, was Rem's warning a bluff?  If so, couldn't Light, being a genius, see through his bluff??  "
4224,"What is this animation style? I would call it ""serious"", but maybe gritty?","Often times in anime, I see a serious section accentuated by a gritty, more serious, more old school, animation type.  There will be many frames of animation, and the animation will be very fluid.  Usually this is done within a light-hearted anime, presumably for contrast with the main part of the show.  The example I have is not the best one, but gives you an idea of what I'm talking about.  The opening scene of Golden Boy has a super serious vibe to it, and then goes into the regular style for the anime.  This is a screenshot of the scent in the opening I am referring to:    This YouTube video has the opening, and the first 3 seconds are the most ""serious style"" of the opening.  Note that not in all cases are these clips of animation visually dark like this (for example having a black background.)  I think this art style is more often present when depicting fantasy anime, but I'm not sure.  Is there a name for this style of animation?  Ultimately, I would like to look for anime that use this style of animation throughout, so I am looking for something I can use to search The Internets for (aka a search term).  If I can think of another example, I will edit this question to add it. "
4225,What's the deal with Gowther's concealed identity?,"All 7 of the deadly sins were once a team before. It seems Gowther is able to identify everyone on the team, so why isn't anyone able to identify Gowther?  An additional question is why didn't Gowther reveal himself to the group sooner? I don't see why he would hide his presence from his closest allies. "
4226,How did Light went unnoticed by his dad?,"When Light's father was in deathbed, he looked at Light and confirmed that Light wasn't Kira by his Shinigami eyes since he was able to see his death date.   The only way his death date can become visible is if he doesn't have ownership of a death note with him at the current moment. If Light did not have any deathnote with him at that point, how he was able to keep his memory? And if he had a death note with him, why was his death date visible to his father? "
4227,Is there any specific reason why female voice actors act for male roles in anime?,"I've always been wondering: why do female voice actors act for male characters in anime?  For example: Mayumi Tanaka for Luffy, Takeuchi Junko for Naruto, even Goku's voice actor (Nozawa Masako), etc.  When there are such good male voice actors (for example the ones for Zoro, Sanji, etc.), why do the main leads get female actors?  Is there any specific reason or is it just the way it is? "
4228,"Why is the leader of Tanuki Society a ""Trick Meister""","According to Google a Meister is     denoting a person skilled or prominent in a specified area of activity.   But why is the leader of Tanuki Society a ""Trick Meister""? I don't see any of the characters play tricks and Kinkaku and Ginkaku mainly seem to just bully Yashirō because of his family name. "
4229,Why is Sanji's Wanted Poster drawn?,"Unlike any other characters, only Sanji's poster are drawn.     In chapter 436, they ask the photographer, but there's no reply (or at least the answer didn't revealed after).    Did he really forget to take off the lens cap?   How could he forget to take off the lens cap, if he managed to get another picture of the rest Luffy's crew? "
4230,What type of Devil Fruit did Sengoku eat?,"What type of Devil Fruit did Fleet Admiral Sengoku eat? Zoan? Logia? Paramecia? Since it seems he can change his physical appearance, I assume he ate a Zoan fruit, but what type?   "

4233,What is written in Baudelaire's Les Fleurs du Mal that impacts Takao so badly?,"In the manga Aku no Hana (Flowers of Evil), a lot of the main characters read the book Les Fleurs du Mal by Baudelaire. But what is written in there that affects Takao and Nakamura to the point where they wish to commit suicide so badly?  How did the text of that book impact the characters in the series the way it did?   "
4234,"What exactly is the ""Ritual of The Divine Tree""?","In the anime, it is shown that Kaguya regularly sends people to the Divine Tree for this ""ritual"" and those people somehow die.  So what exactly happens to them? I thought the Infinite Tsukuyomi was supposed to make people dream in their ideal world... Then how do people who go there for the ritual end up dead, whereas the ones who were first caught in it (King Tenji and others) live in their ideal worlds? "
4235,Who was George?,"Most who watched Seitokai Yakuindomo probably remember the story of George, the heroic sailor who jumped off his ship in the middle of a storm to rescue a drowning cat. His story was heartwarming and fantastic, but also a bit bizarre since the character didn't appear anywhere prior.  Is George or his story a reference to anything? Or was this just a crazy story that wasn't making any particular reference?   "
4236,Why did Madara and Kaguya stop the Infinite Tsukuyomi?,"When both of them first cast it, the Moon was shining brightly but then the light subsided.  Then Madara came down to hunt Team 7. At that moment, if the moonlight was already absent then why didn't the once caught into the infinite Tsukuyomi escape out in the absence of the moonlight?  Same goes for Kaguya...why did she wake up some of the people that were caught in the infinite tsukuyomi and erase their memory when from the starting she wanted to use infinite Tsukuyomi to put mankind under a genjutsu?   When the moonlight stopped shining, shouldn't all the people in both cases escape out of the genjutsu? "
4237,Why didn't Itachi kill Sasuke?,Why did Itachi not kill Sasuke but instead poked his head during their last battle that led to Itachi's death?  Was it because of the clan symbol behind him? Or because he loved him? 
4238,Art style choice?,I just watched the first episode of this anime and the plot seems pretty gripping but the art-style is what I found most interesting. It came out in 2013 so there weren't any technical limitations (at least that I'm aware of) but the animators decided to go with this style.   What is this style called? And does any one know why the designers used this as their style of choice?      
4239,Which song is played in One Piece Episode 395 when Zoro loses his way?,Which theme song is played in starting of this Zoro's haki video? 
4240,Why does Akira retain her memories of her experiences as a Selector?,"In episodes 7 and 8 of Selector Infected Wixoss, Akira calls Ruko and Yuzuki to an abandoned building. Akira shows them the scar that appeared on her face after her third Wixoss loss and tells them that her wish was to destroy Iona. This exchange suggests that Akira retains her memories of her experiences as a Selector.  In contrast, after Hitoe suffers three losses, she does not recognise Ruko and Yuzuki after they find her on the street. Even when she looks at her Wixoss notebook, she is unable to remember Ruko and Yuzuki. This is in accordance with Hanayo's statement that upon three losses, the Selector will lose her memories associated with being a Selector.  With this in mind, why does Akira retain her memories? Perhaps Hanayo's explanation of the loss penalties was incomplete? "
4241,Was Dr. House inspired by Black Jack?,"Was Dr. House inspired by Black Jack from Tezuka? Is there a proof of that, such as a quote from the author?  Many comments on the Internet state that the characters are very similar, some were stunned by this fact when they first saw Dr. House, ...  The French Wikipedia says:     Enfin, House est également inspiré du héros éponyme du manga Blackjack   (ブラック・ジャック, 1973-1983) d'Osamu Tezuka, un médecin cynique, sombre,   solitaire et sans diplôme accomplit de véritables miracles médicaux.   Cette influence est confirmé par House lui-même, qui déclare dans un   épisode que sa vocation médicale vient de sa rencontre avec un médecin   marginal japonais.   which means:     Finally, House is also inspired by the eponymous hero of Osamu   Tezuka's manga Blackjack (ブラック · ジャック, 1973-1983), a cynical doctor,   dark, lonely and without diplomas who performs real medical miracles.   This influence is confirmed by House himself, who said in an episode   that his medical vocation comes from his encounter with a marginal   Japanese doctor.   What's funnier is that there was a very short cross-over between Dr. House and Blackjack in the two promotional and official ads for the release of the season 4 of Dr. House in Japan, but I don't know if that is related to my question. "
4242,What is the difference between the new version and the old one?,"I want to watch Berserk, but there is 2 version of it. What is the difference between them?

4243,"Is there any equivalent to the ""fujoshi""/""fudanshi"" descriptors for yuri fans?","A woman who consumes and enjoys boys' love publications might describe herself as a fujoshi (腐女子), literally ""rotten girl"". There is an equivalent term for men: fudanshi (腐男子).  Does an equivalent term for men or women who enjoy yuri publications exist? (In other words, is there a term someone can use as a shorthand to say that she likes reading yuri manga?) My internet research suggests there is not, but I would like to see something more authoritative, particularly since my lack of knowledge might be linked to my lack of active involvement in yuri fan circles.   This Reddit thread poses the same question and does not come to any real conclusion. TVTropes mentions the fujoshi term in its page for ""yaoi fangirls"" but lacks anything similar on its page for ""yuri fans"".   If there is no such term, is there any reason for its lack of existence? "
4244,What exactly is the Honnouji Academy?,"I've been watching Kill La Kill.  So Honnouji Academy is an academy alright. Students go there.  But, why are entire families and neighbourhoods living in it? Is everyone in there a prisoner? What happens when a student is expelled? "

4246,Is Ritsu really necessary?,"Ritsu was great when she was first introduced, but as I go on with the series, she seems to be a little less useless every time I see her, and then in the past few chapters, she was just gone. Is she truly a great help? When they went to that one place to make a major Assassination attempt, I noticed that Ritsu didn't take part at all. So what I'm asking: is she a necessary component of the class? "
4247,Can Naruto use planetary devastation?,"If no, then why?  He has the sage of six path's powers too right?   Then why can's he use planetary devastation? "
4248,Did Naruto and Sasuke receive the Sage of Six Path's chakra or Asura's and Indra's chakra?,"So Naruto already has Asura's chakra, and Sasuke has Indra's chakra. Did the Sage of Six Paths give them his own chakra? Or did he give Indra's chakra to Naruto and Asura's chakra to Sasuke which fused together to make his own? "
4249,Why didn't Sasuke put Naruto or his Kurama in genjutsu during Naruto vs Sasuke?,"It only makes sense, he could have won easily that way if Obito can put a Jinchuriki (Yagura) under a Genjutsu, then why can't Sasuke? His eyes clearly surpass Obito's.  Why didn't Sasuke put Naruto or his Kurama in genjutsu during their battle? "

4251,Was Croix and his party the only ones to enter Frelia's Binary Field?,"In Ar Tonelico 2: Melody of Metafalica in the final episode of Frelia Binary Field when Miwa and Miora face off it appears Miora calls Miwa Mir     Miora: Hey! Mir! That's not fair! you didn't convert this story again, did you?      Miwa: Hehehe... Who knows.      Miwa: Talking Trash, I found some nostalgic data. why don't i input it into my system?      Miora: what are you up to!?      Miwa: Hehehe... you'll cry out og nostalgia, too. Now, let's go   At this point the background becomes that of Shadow Mir. the final boss or Ar Tonelico: Melody of Elemia and Miora seems to recognize it.  it almost seems to me that Miora, who has the same image as that of Shurelia when Mir connected to Shurelia's tower with Raki, became Shurelia as she seems to be referencing what Mir did her Binary field in the first game when Lyner dove into her.  However when Mir suggested that they enter Frelia's Binary Field she said that only 4 would be diving into her, that would be Croix, Mir, Luca and Cloche.  So i am wondering, is Shurelia, Misha and Aurica diving into Frelia as well? if so how? "
4252,How can anime or manga be made so quickly and consistantly?,"If multiple people are working on a manga or anime, how can the art style be copied so well without any style changes? Like can everyone replicate art styles exactly with no mistakes? In most American cartoons I watch, if multiple people work on an animation, you could definately tell if someone different drew it. Maybe I’m not observing enough or this question is stupid. "
4253,Who is the strongest Hokage?,"Who is actually the strongest Hokage? It would be such a simple question and answer if Kishimoto just gave us a direct answer. But instead, Kishimoto feeds us different information along the way as the story progresses.  Pre Chuunin Exam Sarutobi was highlighted as the genius Shinobi. The manga stated that he quickly surpassed both the first and the second at a young age, and was widely known as the Professor. We also find out later that the first and second died in war, while the third and fourth sacrificed their lives to use the demon god.   Chuunin exam era + beginning of Shippuden Minato was considered the strongest Hokage. Recall when Orochimaru was using Edo Tensei to revive all dead Kages - Sarutobi was most afraid of the Fourth. For a while, everyone regarded the 4th as the strongest shinobi. I am not sure if this is because they never witnessed the first, but it seems evident that Minato was the powerhouse. Everyone kept saying - If the fourth was here, Orochimaru would be no problem, etc.  Late Shippuden when Tobi starts acting and Madara is revealed Hashirama is the God of Shinobi. He is depicted as the strongest of all four, even recognized by Minato. He is the only one to resist Orochimaru's control. Madara Uchiha also regards everyone else, aside from Hashirama, as insignificant.  The thing that bothers me the most is how Sarutobi was not worried and was able to handle fighting both Hashirama and Tobirama. Minato was the source of his fear.  And then later on, Hashirama just seems like he is on another level. So I guess I have to redefine my question. Was Hashirama always the strongest Hokage, or did Kishimoto develop his strength later on? Or can this just not be determined? "
4254,What's this vocal piece in the beginning of episode 18?,"I'm on episode 18 of Cowboy Bebop, and I noticed vocal background music sung by a male singer that seemed rather classical in style at the beginning, when there is a montage of Faye at a horserace.  What is the title of this piece? Is it something classical music, or is it an original soundtrack-specific composition? The Wikia for the episode doesn't seem to give me anything. "

4256,Was Kazuki Takahashi involved in the modifications made in Yu-Gi-Oh! for reasons of censorship?,"Checking some Youtube videos about censorship in Yu-Gi-Oh! (especcially this video), it seems that the motives for censorship are based mainly on:   Sexual content/innuendoes Violence Religion references And others (offensive language, stereotypes, political matters, etc.)   There is a entire list of modified cards, but I'm looking for Kazuki Takahashi's words about this subject that covers censorship in his anime, manga and cards1.    1 The linked sources shows the reasons for censorship (i.e changes made in scenes and artwork card modifcations), but none of them mentions Kazuki Takahashi's opinion. "

4260,Explain about Ergo Proxy and Proxy one and their relation with Monard Proxy,I just now finished Ergo Proxy and have few questions regarding it. Please Help  1) Who loved Monard Proxy initially? Proxy One or Ergo Proxy?  2) Who created Romdo? Proxy One or Ergo Proxy?  3) Why did Proxy One create Ergo Proxy in the first Place? And why did Ergo Proxy had his memory locked away? Was it according to some plan of Proxy One?  4) Which one was imperfect Proxy? Since the creator of Romdo is Considered imperfect?  5) why did the creator of Romdo fled it? whichever proxy it was?  thanks a lot :) 
4261,Can One for All become too powerful for one person to wield?,"The Quirk One for All combines a quirk that stores power and a quirk that can be passed on. Izuku currently has the power and experience of eight previous One for All users, meaning the Quirk grows stronger with each generation. At some point in the very far future, does this mean that One for All will become so powerful, that no one can handle ALL of its power? We already know that it's so powerful now, that a new user can break his limbs off using it. How about in the future, when say 20 more people have passed on the Quirk? Even with training, will the power of this Quirk be too much? Will future users be limited to using a fraction of its power? "
4262,Where does the filler in Violinist of Hameln start?,In which episode does the Violinist of Hameln anime stop following the manga?  And which manga chapter does the anime go up to before the filler starts? 
4263,What does the name Muta mean (in The Cat Returns)?,"In Hayao Miyazaki's film The Cat Returns there is a character (a fat cat) called ""Muta"".  His true name is ""Renaldo Moon"". According to Google Muta can mean many things, including ""together with"" and the shedding of skin.  So is that the meaning of the word? Or what is it? If it is not the shedding of skin, why is he called Muta? "
4264,What happens to the Meister when they complete a Death Scythe?,"The Soul Eater anime only mentions one Meister who created a Death Scythe, and that was Maka's mother with Spirit Albarn being the Death Scythe she created.  When the other Death Weapons arrived in Death City after Asura's release, we did find out that the Death Scythes were stationed around the world. However, the anime didn't reveal who their Meisters were, or even what happened to them.  So I am wondering: What happens to a Meister when their Weapon Partner becomes a Death Scythe? Would the process be different with Kid and the Thompson Sisters? (Kid stated that he would rather use a Death Scythe he made than one of his father's) "
4265,How often do multi-season anime break their previous cour count?,"Usually with multi-season anime, successive seasons tend to follow a similar episode-count as previous seasons. Even if the exact number of episodes is off by a couple, or some are replaced by recap episodes, but in almost every Season 2 or 3 I've seen, the number of cours always matches up with the same number of cours as the 1st season.  First, is there a particular reason for this, or is it ""just tradition""?  Second, how often do second or third seasons break from the cour-count of previous seasons? Does it happen at least once a year, or is it uncommon enough that the last time it happened was ages ago? Does it even happen at all?  Third, are there any examples of anime that have asymmetrical seasons like this? Recent and otherwise examples would be nice. "
4266,What was the point of blocking the robot outbreak using Kill-Ballad?,"In Robotics;Notes, there is some sort of robot outbreak in the city. They all go out of control and attack what seemed like the city hall.  When Frau tries to hack into the servers to stop the outbreak, she is redirected to the Kill-Ballad game. When Kai beats the enemy, access is given and they manage to stop the outbreak.  What was the point of using Kill-Ballad to block the access to the servers? Couldn't the enemy just say ""nah, you don't have access, go away"" rather than giving a chance to actually stop the outbreak? "
4267,Why doesn't Archer seem to have feelings for Rin?,"So, I just watched Fate/Stay Night Unlimited Blade Works for the first time.     Archer is basically Shirou in the future of an alternative universe, right?   In the anime, Shirou mentions multiple times that he loves Rin or that he has strong emotions for her, at least. So why does Archer seem to be so ""cold"" towards Rin?   I mean, shouldn't he be at least a tiny bit attached to her in some way? Or did he really change THAT much as a person, that he doesn't feel romantic emotions towards her? (Well in the end he DOES save her so he seems to care about her in some way. But, it still feels like there is too much distance between them throughout the whole series)  I mean, technically, should Archer have had emotions for the Rin in ""his reality"" or not? What happened to her?  Sorry for all the questions. I will look for more content of the ""Fate"" series, but my curiosity is killing me and I may have missed something since it was the first time, watching that anime, for me. :D "
4268,Why shadow clone technique make a clone of what they are holding?,"Definition : Similar to the basic Clone Technique, Shadow clone technique creates copies of the user. However, these clones are corporeal instead of illusions.  According to me when Naruto uses Shadow clone technique then his whole dress also get cloned to other user, so there might be possibility that item inside bag might get cloned too. And it can also be proved as he uses All direction shuriken technique where ""Naruto and his shadow clones throw shuriken all at once."" - Source  So the quesion is: How non-living object get multiplied because according to wiki definition about Shadow clone technique : ""The user's chakra is evenly distributed among every clone, giving each clone an equal fraction of the user's overall power."" but non-living object has no chakra so how come ?  If it is possible to use it which is true, then let us say that those cloned user threw kunai on the target then for sure it will get hit on that target. But if that cloned user (which uses that kunai) got vanish then :  Will that kunai too vanishes at that same time or it will be there as it is? "
4269,Why didn't Kira kill manipulate the mafia to kill Mello?,"In the Mafia Arc, Kira was able to get hold of the names of the Mafia members under Mello's command, but the only thing he did was kill them. Couldn't he have manipulated them to help out in the assualt/kill Mello themselves?  Seems like a plot hole to me.  The same could be said for Mello killing the majority of the SPK members - he could have manipulated them to kill Near. However, this could be forgiven because he might have wanted to 'fight' Near 'mentally' with defeating Kira, the last boss.  Is there a rule that prevents them from manipulating to kill? "
4270,"In Kuroko no Basuke, are the characters ever compared to professional players?","So, in Kuroko no Basuke (or, The Basketball Which Kuroko Plays, as suits you), we see that the Generation of Miracles has some pretty wacky basketball superpowers. I'm no basketball expert, but it seems like if you took the five of them and transferred them into the real world (powers and all), they would beat most actual NBA teams. And the thing is, they're just 10th-graders. Sure, maybe they're the best 10th-graders (even the best high-schoolers) in Japan, but surely they can't be as good as professional players in the KnB universe, can they?   Which brings me to my question - does the manga ever talk about how good professional basketball players (NBA or otherwise) are as compared to the high-school players the story focuses on? "
4271,What differences are there between the manga and anime version of Coppelion?,"I've just watched Coppelion. Was curious about the manga, and according to the Wikipedia page... it is still going on? Apparently it has nearly 200 chapters, so I guess that the anime doesn't cover a large portion of the story.  I don't know if there will be further anime adaptations (will there?), but right now I'm more interested in knowing how does the current anime portion differ from its manga counterpart.  How faithful is the anime, so far? "
4272,When does One Piece take place?,"When does the story of One Piece take place? Since the story is pirate-themed, I thought it may be at the time of the Golden Age of Piracy. The Golden Age of Piracy spans from 1650s to the 1730s. So I thought it happened around that time. Am I right or do they have their own timeline? "
4273,Are the Space-Time Barrier and Flying Thunder God Technique similar to one another?,"I came across the difference between the Flying Thunder God Technique and Obito's Kamui Technique Transportation Technique, here.  But what I am struck with the fact that Fourth Hokage used a Space-Time Barrier tecnique to teleport Nine-Tail's Tailed Beast Ball. So my questions are:   Is Space-Time Barrier similar to Flying Thunder God Technique? Is it used to transport things using Teleportation Technique?  "
4274,Who is Onihime talking about in this scene? Is it a 4th wall joke?,"In Momokyun Sword episode 3, around 12:50, Enki is in the process of ""torturing"" her prisoner Karin, in a very special way:  Beginning by running her hands up her thighs, telling Karin ""私 は 天国 見せて 上げる"" - I'll show you heaven.  Then Onihime tells her to stop:     And Enki promptly stops and apologise, but she is looking straight at the camera angle - probably turning 180° and facing onihime based on their positioning on the shot above.    But who is this ""a lot of people"" Onihime mention? It couldn't be anyone from the Earth or Celestial realm, because they are really mad at the oni anyway by default.  It seemed to me that she was breaking the 4th wall. Is it so? "
4275,Does Nyu have Vectors?,"Does Nyu have Vectors? And if not, why?  I notice that when Lucy's mind switches to Nyu (looks like), there are no Vectors anymore, aren't there? And most of all, is Nyu a Diclonius? "
4276,Where should I start watching in the Naruto series?,I'm not new to the Naruto franchise. I'm also up to date with what's currently going on (Madara vs Naruto &amp; Sasuke). But I want to know the details of how everything happened. From which episode should I start watching? I want to at least start after the whole Pain storyline and around where the Fourth Ninja War starts. Anyone got an idea on where I should start? 
4277,What are the differences of Near in the manga version?,"In Death Note, I've read that Near displays more emotions and (more interestingly) shows greater insight and deduction ability than his anime counterpart.  What are the differences of Near from his anime counterpart? Is the above statement true? (And if so, please provide examples.)  There is another question, How different are the anime and manga versions of Death Note, but that just takes into question the ending. "
4278,What about Sebastian's footprints?,"In the Phantomhive Manor Murders Arc, in the Manga, when the murders were happening, the characters who were investigating specifically mentioned that there were no footprints of anyone from outside who might have come from storm or might've been wet because of rains near the crime scenes.  But later      when Sebastian was explaing that he was behind everything and that he switched corpse places from outside windows. Also he was shown wet a number of times. But no footprints were found? There were no footprints of the wet Sebastian? How?    Was mentioning the ""no traces of footprint"" thing a mistake or was it ignored while sebastian was explaining what had actually happened? "
4279,Why are corpses blinded with a cloth?,"In the Manga, in The Ship Voyage arc, the corpses on Campania are blinded by a cloth. Ciel speculates that they can't hear or see. But if the cloth is removed, will they be able to see? Or is it just for show? To depict that the corpses can't see? Any particular reason? Or the Mangaka just wanted to design the characters that way? "
4280,Who was this girl by Lucy in special episode 10.5?,"In special episode 10.5 of Elfen Lied anime, there was a scene where Lucy was together with a girl in a school. Who was that girl? A friend? And why did she want to protect her? I thought Lucy hated all humans and wanted to kill them!   "

I'm curious about this, I'm only familiar with Shonen Jump and it published in Japan by Shueisha from 1970  I was wondering if there are any other manga magazines that have been published before Shonen Jump? "
4282,What is the song Yuji humming everytime?,"Kaido Yuji sometimes seems to hum a song (which said in the anime was a popular song before the ""Blue"" incident)   Yuji first hummed this ""song"" when he was first awoken by soldiers from second earth (the scene with a soldier who maintains his armored shrike) in Episode 3 or 4 I think.  Yuji said that this ""song"" he was humming reminds him of his best friend who had promised to see him after a ""cure"" has been found for his disease (episode 21)  Is this a real song, or is it just a fiction? Do anyone know the title of the song? "
4283,What's the deal with Roronoa Zoro's eye after the timeskip?,"I'm up to date in the One Piece anime but not in manga, is there any information about Zoro's closed eye? Can't he open it because of his scar there or is he maybe hiding his real power with holding his one eye closed? How did he get his scar? Maybe in a final training fight with Mihawk?   Are there any informations about his scar on his eye?    Thanks for every helping answer! :) "

4285,Why is Steins;Gate in the Beta Attractor Field?,"As stated in the Wiki, the Steins;Gate world line is in       the Beta attractor field. In the Beta attractor field, the final convergent point is World War 3.   However, they prevent      WW3 by making sure the thesis will be destroyed.   The question is, if Steins Gate is in       the Beta attractor field, wouldn't it lead to WW3? If WW3 doesn't happen, shouldn't Steins;Gate be in another attractor field?  "
4286,"Has Kaido eaten a devil fruit? If so, what is its power?","Kaido is called the strongest creature in the One Piece world. Hence, he must be immensely powerful.   My question is: What is his power? Is he a devil fruit user? "
4287,Why doesn't Moeka believe the D-mail Okabe sent from her phone?,"    In the anime, under the pretext of sending a D-mail that asks her to change her phone, Moeka sends herself the location of the IBN 5100 (the shrine). Her past self then steals the IBN from the shrine. Okabe tries to undo this, by sending a message along the lines of ""Shrine is a trap. Don't go there"" from her phone. However, it is stated that she didn't believe that message, and stole the IBN from the shrine. Okabe then concludes that in order for her to believe the message, it must come from FB.   My question is, why would Moeka believe the first message, but not the second (sent by Okabe)? Both the messages were sent from the same phone, so why believe one but not the other? "
4288,How can Enel reach the moon?,"On the mini-series in Manga, Enel goes to the moon. It's a side story titled Enel's Great Space Operations. How can he reach the moon?    He goes to space where there is no air, how can he breathe?  It's a really long distance, the distance between earth and moon is 384,400 km (238,900 miles). And considering that One Piece takes place in the sixteenth century, the average speed of a ship at that time was less than 10 knot (18.52 kph/11.5 mph), it will take more than 2 years to reach the moon with a ship like that. Can't he just use his power to reach the moon? (I don't know if lightning can go through space or not, maybe Kizaru can do it better?)  "
4289,Why didn't Masashi Miyamoto take Taira's chip after cutting his fingers?,"In episode 7 ""Virtual bride"" of Btooom Masashi attacked Taira with his knife and cut his fingers off. He then caused Sakamoto to fall of the cliff and he kidnapped Himiko.   Why didn't he take Taira's chip? Why was he left alive? "

Looking around, Enel sees endless followers, and an enormous amount of ""vearth"", and decides that the ""Fairy Vearth"" was everything that he had wanted.   But what happen after that? Did he goes back to earth? "
4291,Do Alkahestry have same limitations like Alchemy? Or some different limitations?,"In FMA Brotherhood, Alchemy's limits were very well defined but the limits of Alkahestry are never mentioned. Is this ever described outside of the TV series, perhaps in other media or interviews? If so, what are these limitations? "
4292,Is there any anime with an overweight female protagonist?,"Is there any anime with an overweight female protagonist?  A friend of mine told me that there is none. Is she right?  I just need one simple yes/no answer and, if affirmative, one example. "
4293,How does Sweet Mask (A-Class rank 1) plan to stop unworthy heroes from moving to S-Class?,"Even though it's said by other heroes he should rank up, he refuses as he feels it is his duty to remain in the number one spot of A-Class to prevent the unworthy from becoming S-Class heroes, except for those whom he sees worthy like Genos, fitting Sweet Mask's philosophy about ""heroes needs to be beautiful too""  But how does he plan to stop? Had he not approved of Genos, what power does he have to stop him from climbing to class S. Isn't that the decicsion for the association? "
4294,Is there a single member of the Einzbern family who is a human being?,"From the information I could find, nearly all known members of the Einzbern family are (female) homunculi (Justeaze, Irisviel, Illyasviel and all the maids), the only exception being Jubstacheit, who is supposed to be an A.I. controlling an array of humanoid golem bodies.  Is there any information on Einzberns who are actually human beings? Are there any alive at all at the time of the events of Fate/Zero and Fate/Stay Night? If there is not, can the Einzberns actually be considered a ""bloodline"" in the strict sense of the word, or are they more like an army of self-cloning homunculi? "
4295,Does the Uchiha:Senju DNA ratio matter in awakening the Rinnegan?,"Is it possible for a Senju to awaken a Rinnegan? Suppose that a Senju got an EMS from an Uchiha and implanted it, would he also awaken the Rinnegan just like an Uchiha did, given that the ratio of Uchiha and Senju DNA is different than if an Uchiha awakens it? "
4296,Why didn't Kazuya use his freezing ability against Chiffon?,"On the last two episodes of Freezing Vibration (2nd season of Freezing), we could see Kazuya, Rana, and Satellizer fighting Chevalier's Pandora and Student Council President Chiffon Fairchild.  In this fight, although set as 2 against 1, Satellizer and Rana were badly wounded and beaten.  I was wondering, Kazuya was there and he has this powerful Freezing field he can generate on his own. So why did Kazuya not use his freezing ability against Chiffon?  Even though fighting against a ""True"" Pandora, two Pandoras working together with activated stigmata and a very powerful Freezing can mean a lot.  He used it in other episodes when he was fighting beside Satellizer against other tough pandoras. So why didn't he use it against Chiffon? "
4297,Where was it revealed that Jubstacheit is an A.I?,"So I read this question, where it says:     the only exception being Jubstacheit, who is supposed to be an A.I. controlling an array of humanoid golem bodies.   I've never read this before, so I looked it up on Jubstacheit's Wikia page, where it says:     Jubastacheit is an artificial intelligence made to control the Einzbern Castle, Golem Jubstacheit (ゴーレム・ユーブスタクハイト, Gōremu Yūbusutakuhaito?). It manufactures humanoid golem terminals, and Acht is the eighth generation.   However, this was not the case as on June 11, 2015, the same paragraph said:     Declared the eighth head of the Einzbern family, Jubstacheit was not around during Justeaze Lizrich von Einzbern's era, but kept himself alive for nearly two centuries by continuously prolonging his life.    This part started to change on January 13, 2016, and this new information had not been cited, as the only reference on the page is the Fate/Zero Season 1 Boxset - Drama CD 1, which has been there for quite some time.  So I am wondering, what Nasuverse title/material book says that Jubstacheit is an A.I? "
4298,What drove the hotel cook to start attacking students?,In the Another anime most of the students started to kill one another because they wanted to find the dead in order to stop. Even the cook was involved in the killings.    What's the motive behind her killings? Did she kill the manager and start the fire? Any clue?   
4299,What happened to people with other skin colors?,"In Attack on Titan, we know what happened to many people:      they became Titans.   But what happened to people with different skin colors, e.g. black?      Did they turn into Caucasian Titans? Or were they simply killed?  "
4300,Why do we generally see only one person per type of magic?,"Why do we usually see only one person using a type of magic? Look at Cana's magic for example. Out of everything shown via the Anime, no one else has used it on their own. Same with Reedus, Makarov, Evergreen, Bickslow, Gildarts, Jura, Erza (Knight), and many other people.  I can understand why limited number of people use the rare/lost magic (Dragon Slayer and other lost types), but what about the more modern magics? "
4301,Why were they surprised they couldn't send e-mails when the network was closed off in the first place?,"In episode 2, Yamane Yukihiro explains that the network on the island is completely isolated, a protected network.     If that is the case, why are they surprised when they cannot send e-mails or communicate with the outside world when the system goes down later in episode 3?   "
4302,In SAO 2 did Asuna break up with Kirito?,"I noticed that when introducing Shino to Asuna and Lisbeth, Kirito mentioned them as his nakama. Why is that? Why is it that Kirito didn't introduce Asuna as his girlfriend? Is this what is normally done by a Japanese couple? Or did they broke up? "
4303,What is a Grail vessel?,"In Fate/Zero, Irisviel was created to be the Grail vessel. In Fate UBW, I think Illya was one as well. (I think it's also the case in Fate/stay night in general, but I'm not sure).  What is a Grail vessel? Is it required to summon the Holy Grail? Because if that's the case, what if there is no Grail vessel in the war? "
4304,What were the Einzberns planning to do once Kiritsugu won the war?,"The Einzberns hire Kiritsugu. Some random mage hunter guy.  As far as I'm concerned, the Einzberns pretend to use the Grail to restore the Third Magic thing.  But, if Kiritsugu uses the Grail for his wish (the world peace thing), won't the Grail vanish?  So the question is, what were the Einzberns planning to do once Kiritsugu won the war? Don't they need the Grail to get the Third Magic thing? "
4305,How was the plan communicated between the killer and the director?,"In episode 2, Yamane Yukihiro tells Nishinosono and Professor Saikawa that the director isn't there, he's off picking up Dr. Magata's younger sister, Miki.      Nishinosono: Where did the director go?      Yamane: He went to get Dr. Magata's younger sister.   However, we later learn that Miki was actually Dr. Magata all along. This means that the director was aware this is the day he would die all along. How though, was this plan between Dr. Magata and the director communicated? I understand that all communications were recorded. They also said multiple times that no one had gone in to Dr. Magata's room for 15 years, except they did open the door anytime they had to put a large package in.   What was the method they used to communicate this plan? "
4306,Why did the Einzberns make Illya a master?,"In both Stay/Night and UBW, Illya is a Grail vessel.  ... and she's also a master.  Why did the Einzbern make her a master? If she wins the war, she will become the Lesser Grail because she is the vessel itself, won't she? And if she becomes the Lesser Grail, then there will be literally nobody present to take possession of the Holy Grail (since all other competitors would be dead / defeated). "
4307,Did Naruto REALLY fall in love with Hinata in The Last: Naruto the Movie?,"So we know that throughout the whole Naruto series Hinata is in love with Naruto, and Naruto is oblivious to it. We also know that Naruto like Sakura, somehow. Later on two years after the war, Hinata is still in love with him.  Spoiler below about The Last: Naruto the Movie      Hinata, Naruto, Sakura, Sai, and Shikamaru are sent on a mission to rescue Hinata's sister. At one moment they had to go through something to get to this one place (sorry I can't recall what it was.) When they went through there they fell in a Genjutsu without knowing. In that Genjutsu Naruto is seeing a flashback of Hinata and him, but mostly Hinata. Naruto starts seeing some moments where Hinata as a kid wrote his name on a piece of paper and started to get happy, then after he fought Kiba she gave Naruto that healing cream, when he was on the ground when he was fighting Pain she protected him and confessed her love for him, Hinata talking to Sakura about Naruto, etc. After seeing all that, Sakura is able to break the Genjutsu on him and he is able to wake up. After that, they continue to look for Hinata's sister. Hinata and Naruto have to share one of Sai's painted birds to fly on. Naruto starts to look at Hinata different. Is it because he feels sorry for being oblivious of her love for him? Then after feeling sorry, did he start feeling something for her as well or what because after that guy (sorry I forgot his name) took Hinata with him, Naruto tried to get her back. He ended up losing and getting so hurt he kinda fell in a comma. After he woke up Sai and Shikamaru told him that Sakura was all awake day and night trying to bring him back and that he was saying Hinata's name over and over. He went to see Sakura because Shikamaru and Sai said she was really bad. When he was with her she said, ""So you finally noticed"", or something like that. Then at the end of the movie, he takes Hinata and starts blasting his Rasengan like that they can move faster. They end up really high in the sky, then he kisses her. When the credits are on we see that they got married, then after that, there is a short scene that shows her knitting a scarf and his training outside in the snow. A couple of seconds later their two kids are shown, then they all start a snow fight.   So my question is if Naruto did quickly fall in love with Hinata after the Genjutsu in the movie, or did he slowly start to feel something for her after it?  Also, in between that blank timeline of those two years, did Naruto figure out that Sakura was never going to fall in love with him and stopped liking her or did he stop liking her after being in that Genjutsu? "
4308,What is the symbolism of Labyrinth in Grisaia no Meikyuu?,"The first VN/season deals with the fruit of Grisaia, the sins (or sorrow) of the girls.  Is the Fruit of Grisaia an actual fruit?  Now, what is Labyrinth in the title of the second game supposed to mean? "
4309,How is the use of the red stones able to bypass equivalent exchange?,"In the 2003 series, we see on different occasions that the red stones are used as an unstable alternative to the philosopher's stone despite the fact that they do not have any souls entrapped in them. They're just artificially synthesised.  If so, why was prophet Cornello able to apparently bypass equivalent exchange using the red stones? More controversial is the revival of birds by alchemy using a red stone. Why are homunculi fed with red stones as a source of souls? It all just doesn't add up. "
4310,Was a slaughter by Itachi the only option?,"Since the only problem from the leaf side was Danzo, why didn't Itachi and Fugaku convince Hiruzen and even possibly Obito to take down Danzo?   There is no possible reason for Obito to help Itachi but if the only reason to help Itachi was his recruitment to the Akatsuki, then why would he not agree to help Itachi if Itachi agreed to join the Akatsuki.   The only problem remaining is the bad Uchiha comrades. Their demands could have been fulfilled or they could have taken down. They didn't seem to possess the mangekyo sharingan given how Itachi was surprised when he saw Fugaku show his Mangekyo.  Was a slaughter essential only for the plot development of the series or was it something that was the only option? "
4311,Are some translated anime needlessly subbed twice?,Scenario:  A streaming site has streaming rights to an anime and then a different company picks up the title for DVD/Bluray viewing.  Question:  Does the second company have to re-subtitle the show even though that work has been done already by the streaming company?  Because I assume the subtitles belong to the company who made them - Do companies sell them on maybe? 
4312,Is it physically possible to turn a mahjong tile white with a super grip?,"In the manga Mudazumo Naki Kaikaku, the protagonist Junichiro Koizumi is able to use ""goumoupai"", the ability to turn any mahjong tile into a white/haku tile simply by gripping it with immense strength, usually leaving the tile dented.  Sure, the manga frequently goes overboard with the abilities of each character, but this one seems like it might actually be possible in real life. I'd assume that the material the tile is made out of would be a giant factor, but apparently Koizumi can even do it with depleted uranium tiles.  How much grip force would be needed to scrape/dent a mahjong tile so that it turns white? Would it be possible for a human (for any material)? "
4313,Where was Shinji Matou during Fate/Zero?,"In Fate/Zero, we see that the Matou don't really have a proper candidate to participate in the war. So Zouken adopted Sakura. Then Kariya comes up and participates. In exchange for winning the grail, Zouken will release Sakura from her fate as a mage (?).  Then Kariya loses. Therefore Zouken still needs Sakura, does he not? Zouken will continue training her to participate in the next war.  But, in Fate Stay/Night and UBW, this is the situation:   Sakura is a normal girl with no apparent knowledge of magic. Shinji Matou is the master fighting for the Matou family.   Then, my question is:   Where was Shinji Matou during Fate/Zero? Why did Zouken need Sakura if he had Shinji?  "
4314,What are the Guardian of Earth's tasks in Dragon Ball series?,"In case the question is not very clear, What I want to know is:   What Dende or Kami must do as the Guardian of Earth? Do they have to protect human being from evil? Do they have to create the dragon balls? Do they have to hear and grant (if appropriate) any humans wish (as the comment said they referenced as God)? Do they have to watch over every activity that people on earth do? If they don't have to create dragon balls, do they have to be from Namek? Aside from people safety, in what problems they may or must help humans  for fulfilling their job as Guardian of Earth?   Basically, the question is what are their tasks as the Guardian of Earth? "
4315,Can women be Makai Knights?,"We know that both men (e.g. Mendoza) and women (e.g. Ema) can be Makai Priests. And, of course, men can be Makai Knights (Leon, Alfonso, Germán, ...).   But can women be Makai Knights? In episode 24 of Garo: Honoo no Kokuin,       Jiruba says that Germán's child with Ximena is going to inherit Zoro. This prompts Leon to ask Jiruba if that means that the child is a boy.    This seems to suggest that women cannot be Makai Knights. Is this in fact the case? Supporting information from the tokusatsu series would be very welcome here. "
4316,How does the Grail choose the participants?,"How does the Grail choose the participants?   We know that the Grail tries to pick people who have some sort of strong desire (when Kotomine asks Tohsaka at the beginning of Fate/Zero). Do you need to descend from a mage bloodline? Did the murderer guy (the one who got Caster in Fate/Zero) have magical blood? It seems like you don't need to be aware of the existence of the Holy Grail war (Shirou and the murderer guy were both pretty clueless). You do seem to need an heroic relic... or do you? When Kotomine was surprisingly chosen in Fate/Zero, did he have one already? What if you lose the relic before the summoning occurs? (In Fate/Zero the participants were already making preparations for years before the summoning). The Matou were disappointed that Kariya left behind their magical teachings, so they decided to adopt Sakura to prepare her for the next war. When Kariya returns and chooses to fight, he successfully becomes a master. This suggests that there is a way to opt out/in from the war (?)   So how does the Grail pick participants exactly? "
4317,"Is there any meaning to the rail lines in Bakemonogatari's ""Tsubasa Cat"" OP?","The (NSFW, be warned) broadcast opening for the Tsubasa Cat arc of Bakemonogatari (""Sugar Sweet Nightmare"") features various artistic nudes with what appear to be rail tracks stretching out along the model's body, such as in this SFW sample:    The 'stations' here actually appear to correspond to various stations mostly in the Kansai area; for instance, 天見 (Amami Station) is a station on the Koya Line in Osaka, and 川西 (Kawanishi) is a small city in the same broad area.  On the other hand, a bit of digging doesn't turn up any rail lines that run between the two.    Does anyone know if there's any meaning to the specific choice of rail stations used in this opening and their layout, or was it essentially just a mishmash of random location names? "
4318,When or in what part did Milly Ashford (the school president) admit that she has feelings for Lelouch?,"I have read from an anime magazine that Milly Ashford, the school president, was described as the daughter of the owner of the school which is obvious because the name is Ashford Academy. However, she was also described as the girl who always pairs up Lelouch and Shirley as couple, despite she herself having feelings for Lelouch. Is there any proof of that? I watched the R1 and R2 anime 5 years ago and I cannot remember a part that could prove it. Or am I missing something? "
4319,Was there truly no magic in Sword Art Online?,"In the first episode, when Kirito was showing Klein the ropes of combat, the conversation goes     Kirito: However, there is no magic.      Klein: An RPG without magic? That is a bold decision.   However later on in the show, Kirito visits Lizbeth's shop in Temperature of the Heart.. Kirito is in shop for another sword, and shows Lizbeth his Elucidator.   Lizbeth responds with:     An Elucidator! This is the gnarliest magic sword a person can get from a monster drop.   If magic did not exist, how would there be a magic sword? "
4320,How did Natsu solve his transportation problem?,"In chapter 425, Natsu is seen riding a boar. How come his motion sickness had not kicked in?        He should've built an immunity to Wendy's anti-motion-sickness spell, so why isn't he getting a motion sickness here? "
4321,"Xeno Goku super saiyan 4 and super saiyan god transformations, which transformation is stronger?","According to Dragon Ball Heroes Ultimate Mission X, Xeno Goku is able to transform into super saiyan 4 and at some point he was able to transform into super saiyan god. So he has to know which transformation is stronger, and in the Dragon Ball Heroes continuity super saiyan 4 and super saiyan god can indeed be compared since both exists there. Then, which tranformation is stronger? Xeno Goku super saiyan 4 or Xeno Goku super saiyan god transformation? "
4322,Is the Merlion in Faye's childhood video a real location?,"In this MAL discussion about episode 24 of Cowboy Bebop, the user merle_noir posts that they have been to the Merlion seen in Faye's video:      Faye must be Singaporean... Wouldn't think the Merlion would be anywhere but there (in Singapore), and I even know/have been to the first Merlion she saw - the one in the video.   Is this a real, visitable place? If so, what is the location? "
4323,What's the deal with moving statues?,"In episode 1, how are Ed and Cornello able to make the statues move? How is that alchemy? Is it possible that the revived birds are under same process, i.e., they are just moving but not alive? "
4324,Why did the Uchihas never try to learn Sage Mode?,"Jiraiya, Naruto, Hashirama and Kabuto were able to enter into Sage Mode. One who enters Sage Mode possesses more abilities than a normal ninja. Why did the Uchihas never try to learn Sage Mode? Is it because of the Sage of Six Paths dividing his power among his sons? "
4325,Where can I watch or buy Captain Tsubasa J in English?,Where can I find Captain Tsubasa J first 33 episodes in English subbed? Every website I try only has first 3 episodes then then last 4. I was wondering is there a website you know of I can buy or watch it? 
4326,"The Chuunibyou crew wants to do what to ""this world"", exactly?","In Chūnibyō Demo Koi ga Shitai! the crew always yell      *anishment this world   during their ""transformations"".  What are they saying? Banishment or Vanishment?    There are several sources over the western web (just google it - I just did), and there is nothing conclusive, so if you can point to some canon or other eastern sources, appreciated. "
4327,Why does Takeshi Yamamoto have a interesting naming sense?,"In Katekyo Hitman Reborn, Haru mentions that Takeshi has a interesting sense of naming.   Now I were wondering, is this only because he added the 'Ko' character to the name? Or is there a deeper, under-laying joke/reference made there?   "
4328,Was Shanks expected to eat the Gomu Gomu no Mi?,"At the beginning of the series, we see Shanks carrying the Gomu Gomu no Mi fruit around like a treasure. Was he expected to eat this fruit? Or did he just sell it?    It's obvious he didn't want Luffy to eat it. "
4329,Why is it that some shikigami are like Wanzer from Front Mission?,"In Tokyo Ravens, why is it that some of the shikigamis (especially those used by the Onmyou Agency) are looking like wanzer from Front Mission? What is it derived from? Is there any improvement in Onmyouji between the time of the Abe no Senmei and the current time in Tokyo Ravens that caused this? Is there any explanation for this anywhere in the novel or anime?  EDIT: The following link refers to the Shikigami I call ""looking like wanzer"". [website]"
4330,How is King Bradley's sword so sharp?,"Throughout all of Fullmetal Alchemist Manga, King Bradley chopped his way through everything, from stone to arms to automail.  How did it get to be so sharp? What did the King use to sharpen his sword?  An aside: the sharpness of his sword seemed to transfer to any bladed weapon he used. Was it a side effect of his homunculus-ness? "
4331,What is the theme music when Androids 17 and 18 are activated?,"I'm referring to Episode 38 of the TFS Dragon Ball Z Abridged series, at around 7:40, I think, when Dr. Gero activates 17 &amp; 18 for the first time, a theme music plays in the background...  Various comments on the video say that it is the Cybermen theme from Doctor Who, but the theme sounds nothing like it.... Does anyone know which theme it is, or where can I find this theme? "
4332,What do we know about Shirou's biological ancestors? (not Kiritsugu),"What do we know about Shirou's biological parents/grandparents/etc.? Do we even know anything at all?   This is relevant to e.g. understanding why Shirou can perform magecraft despite presumably having had non-mage parents. (Also, it's just kind of weird that he seems to never say anything about them. He was certainly old enough to remember them when they died in the fire at the end of the fourth grail war.) "
4333,Are the ex-parasites in Darling in the FranXX immortal?,"In the final episode of the anime, Nana and Hachi (who used to be parasites in the past) claim that they're immortal:     We don't age and we're stuck in the middle, neither adults nor children. We have but one duty: to reach out to humanity's future and continue to watch over it. ~Hachi   But just a few minutes later the conversation between Futoshi and Ikuno seems to contradict it:     It's all thanks to your research that us ex-parasites' accelerated aging is being kept in check. ~Futoshi   What information have I missed? Are ex-parasites immortal or mortal? "
4334,"In Deadman Wonderland, is the Red Man is supposed to be Ganta's childhood hero, Ace Man?","I watched Deadman Wonderland about two months ago, when I started I watched the first episode on Adult Swim. I saw the Red Man kill Ganta's classmates and other episode Shiro was passed out in dark basement with this older gentle man.   As soon Shiro wake up it wasn’t her, she was a different person and she grabs this outfit that look like the Red Man’s clothes. Later on of the season it was Ganta’s flashback he had a figure look like Red Man also.      Who is the red man? Aceman ? Shiro?    "
4335,How do Otonashi and Kanade remember Iwasawa's last song in their next life?,"In the final scene of Angel Beats!, we see what we know is Otonashi pass by Kanade. Kanade is humming Iwasawa's last song 'My Song', which she wrote in the afterlife.  How did both Otonashi and Kanade remember this song? If they disappeared in the afterlife, their souls/spirits would have passed on, so how do they remember it?   I assumed that when they are 'reborn' in their next life, they would have no memory of the afterlife or previous life. I guess this isn't the case. "
4336,Which manga chapters are covered by both season of Kamisama Hajimemashita anime?,"Which manga chapters are covered by both season of Kamisama Hajimemashita anime?  Alternatively, if I am to pick up the story where the anime left off, what chapter should I begin reading? "
4337,How did Naruto learn the Teleportation Jutsu?,I distinctly remember that scene from the anime where Naruto has just learned to control the Nine Tail's chakra. He immediately senses Kisame hiding in the sword and goes on to teleport to him and give him a good punch.  Has it ever been explained how he suddenly knows how to use this jutsu? Is it maybe just the body flicker technique that was taken to new heights because he now has all this extra chakra or is it the teleportation jutsu in the same vain his father used? 
4338,Does cursed children erosion rate grow as time passes?,"Cursed children are contaminated with the Gastrea virus. If erosion rate reachs 50%, they turn into Gastrea. Does cursed children erosion rate grow as time passes? Or they have to get more contaminated with other infections for the rate to grow? "
4339,Does the Black Bullet anime cover the whole light novel and/or manga?,"Aside from the anime, Black Bullet has a light novel which started the franchise and a manga.  Does watching only the anime get to know the whole story or not? Does the 13 episodes anime cover the whole light novel and/or manga?  "
4340,How was Shoto Todoroki able to resist One for All?,"Something that I dont understand from My Hero Academia it's something characters which supposedly have average resistance (because their quirks arent about resistance) are able to resist One for All. For example, Shoto in it's battle with Midoriya (and wasnt this One for All 100%?) How was Shoto Todoroki able to resist One for All? "
4341,Why is the title Punchline?,"Why is the title Punchline? How does it relate to the series itself?  According to dictionary.com, punchline means     the climactic phrase or sentence in a joke, speech, advertisement, or humorous story that produces the desired effect.   So do we have to wait until the end of the series to understand the meaning of the title? "
4342,Did Pitohui have a special nerve gear?,"In the last few episodes of Gun Gale Online, it was shown that Pito was hyperventilating and should have been ejected from the game, but she wasn't.   It was discussed that she could be using a NerveGear, but this was never elaborated on.  Does the manga or other sources mention if Pito actually did have a NerveGear? Or just a modified version of the new one?  "
4343,How do Stigmatas and compatibility rate determine how powerful a Pandora is?,"I don't fully understand the way Stigmata works and how compatibility rate factors into all of it. Granted, I am only on chapter 25. Does the number of Stigmata determine how powerful the Pandora is? This seemed to be the case at the start of the manga, where it was stated that 6 is ""elite"" level and how all the characters emphasize how Kazuha had 20. But then, we see Rana and Satellizer being able to defeat third-years.  I noticed that Chiffon only has 4, but then you have Rana who has 6. Why is the former regarded as stronger if she has less? Is it possible for someone with 1 Stigmata to be stronger than someone with 5? Also, how does the compatibility rate factor into all of this?  I was hoping someone could just clear this up for me. "
4344,Why Kisara is able to cut through metal with her sword?,"AFAIK, Kisara is a regular human who has no superhuman habilities (correct me if I'm wrong). Why when she was attacked by Tina Sprout she was able to cut Tina's metal gatlin gun in half with her sword? Is because she's a very skilled martial artist? Does she have some superhuman hability or metal prosthesis that makes her stronger like Rentaro? Is her sword a special sword or it's made of varanium or something? What is it? "
4345,What does Ghoul mean in japanese?,"I know what a Ghoul is in the context of the Tokyo Ghoul series, but I was wondering what does Ghoul mean in japanese. Is it a made up word or it is the same ""Ghoul"" from Arabic? What do the kanji which composes the word mean separately? "
4346,Does using Devil Fruit powers drain the user's stamina?,"In many cases we see that devil fruit users go easy on their powers.  For example, why didn't Whitebeard spam his Gura Gura powers during the war?  couldn't he just have destroyed the entire island? or simply from a distance cause massive sea waves on the island before even starting the war?  There was a scene when the three admirals had to block his attack, why didn't he try it again, and again?  Luffy doesn't seem to get tired of using his Gomu Gomu powers, he basically gets tired of punching, running, or fighting..etc  So what's the deal with how Devil Fruit users use their powers? "
4347,Why is Dimension W negative X?,"When they are explaining Dimension W, it is represented as the negative side of the X axis. Why is Dimension W negative X? Is it not really it's own dimension?   "
4348,Can armament haki be used when in Logia form,"When a Logia devil fruit eater alters his shape to his type of fruit (like ace becoming fire) can he cover himself with armament haki?  We know that it can be used on the body and weapons, is it usable on the Logia form itself? "
4349,What are the laws or policies against using anime characters for application development?,"What I mean is, if I am trying to make a mobile game (say Pokemon), am I allowed to use the same characters as the anime? If not, then what are the rules and regulations regarding this kind of situation? "
4350,Does Enju have precognitive abilities?,"Cursed children are shown through the series to have many superhuman abilities: enhaced speed, force, healing, vision etc. There is an episode where Enju had ""a bad feeling"" and inmediately a shot by Tina Sprout is shown to almost kill Seinteshi. How did she know this? Does Enju have precognitive abilities? "
4351,"Why do sick anime characters often are said to have a ""weak body""?","In anime when a character is chronically sick, they are said to have a ""weak body"".  The first and most obvious example that comes to my mind is Clannad, but I've seen this in other animes as well.  Is this something out of japanese culture? Or maybe a quirk of translation?   Maybe I'm looking too far into it and it's really just a plot device, and nobody really cares about what the illness really is.   Thanks to those who reply! "
4352,Does the Parasyte story and/or manga continue after the anime?,I've watched the Parasyte anime series but I haven't read the manga. The anime ends in a way that it could be the end of the story.  How is in the manga? Does the Parasyte story and/or manga continue after the anime? 
4353,Did Kick-Heart reveal a breakdown of its expenses?,"Kick-Heart is notable as the first anime to be crowdfunded via Kickstarter.  The base goal of the Kickstarter was to reach $150,000, with additional stretch goals for more money.  On their campaign page, they tell potential backers how they intended to use the funds raised:        Increase the quality of animation   Increase the overall duration of the animation   Help offset the current production costs   Manufacturing costs for backers rewards (Blu-ray, printed materials, etc.)   Digital distribution costs for backers downloading the film   Festival submission fees      Do they mention the breakdown of expenses anywhere? I couldn't find it on their Kickstarter page. Generally speaking, it's not uncommon for crowdfunded projects to show where your money goes. Was it perhaps revealed in a backer-only update (which I wouldn't have access to)?  I just thought it was odd that the amount was so high compared to latter Kickstarters like Santa Company for $50,000, which was also a longer animation. "
4354,Why is Reinforce so small?,"At the end, of Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha A's and during Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha StrikerS, Reinforce is quite small.    However, in the above image she is shown to be just as big as Vita. The image above doesn't look like fan art and it's obviously set a few years after StrikerS as Tina is wearing the Enforces' uniform and has longer hair.  I am wondering why Reinforce was so small. Is it because she was still a new born that's yet to grow? If so, can Agito eventually grow up to be normal size since both Rien and Agito are Unison Devices? "
4355,Why is the mikan so popular in anime and manga?,In a lot of anime and manga we see recurring elements of the mikan in one form or another (most notably on a box).  Is there a reason these oranges (in one form or another) recur so often in anime and/or manga (and some games as well)? Where did it originate from?               
4356,Confusion on Meliodas' clones' power level,"In Nanatsu no Taizai season 2 episode 2, it's explained if Meliodas makes clones, his original power level is divided by the number of clones he makes.   For 1 clone, the power level is 1685, which seems correct.    However, if he makes 4 clones, their power level will be 420 each.    Mathematically, 3370 divided by 4 is 840, and when divided by 8 is 420.  But, why is it 420 not 840? Is this a mistake on the anime production? "
4357,What are Rein's capabilities with others?,"In Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha StrikerS, Reinforce, like Agito, is referred to as a Unison Device, who can fuse with their master to increase their strength.  Rein is however a product of the Tome of the Night Sky and is referred to as a ""control device"" for the Tome of the Night Sky.  I am wondering, if Rein fuses with someone else, what is her capabilities? Does the person she fuses with have access to anything in the Tome of the Night Sky? "
4358,Can someone learn more than one alchemy?,"In Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, the characters gain skill in alchemy through learning. So I'm wondering, is it possible to learn more than one alchemy? Because it seems like everyone is a specialized in particular alchemy. Also, if this possible, can they perform more than one alchemy at the same time? "
4359,Is the religion in Shingeki no Kyojin supposed to resemble a real-life religion?,"In the religion in SnK, they worship the walls as their protectors and a number of times say that the walls were put there by God. The walls are also at least once referred to as Goddesses, though that is from subtitles and may not be entirely correct. Is this supposed to be based off of or mirror any real-life religion? Have the creators made any comments about this? "
4360,Is Broly canon now? (Dragon Ball Super Broly movie),"So everybody in Youtube including those Dragon Ball Youtubers with over a million suscribers are saying the new Dragon Ball Super coming in December is called ""Broly"" and that's going to be written by Akira Toriyama (who didnt create Broly). Does this mean Broly is canon now? How about the 3 old Broly movies, do they become canon too?      "
4361,Will Yamato be rescued?,Kabuto used Yamato's power during the war to strengthen the Zetsu army. Will Yamato be rescued? Or will Kabuto kill him after he's done experimenting on him? 
4362,What was left out in the anime adaptation of Sugawara announcing that Sherry is his future wife?,"I was watching episode 20 and my friend said that they cut a lot of stuff out in the scene with Sugawara and Sherry. Could someone provide the details of what was left out from this scene in the anime adaptation? In other words, what drove Sugawara to finally give in to Sherry, where in the previous episode he was giving her the cold shoulder? "
4363,Subtitles vs closed captioning translation difference on Netflix?(specific to Funimation titles),"If anyone has Netflix in here, I have a question about the difference in Funimation subtitles vs closed captioning, which I'm guessing is provided by Netflix.   Not that I really even use Netflix for anime, but I have tried a few series and noticed Funimation titles have both, a Subtitles as well as a Closed Caption option, with different translations on both... not just the audible sounds and what not. Subtitles always being coded in yellow and CC being encoded in white.    Can anyone shed some light on this? Im guessing the yellow encoded subs are from the DVD localization, and then the white CC are a resub, relicensed through Netflix?? "
4364,Why can't Might Guy get his legs back?,"After the Fourth Great Ninja War, both Naruto and Sasuke lost an arm and Might Guy lost his legs (after awakening 8 gates). Tsunade and the team then built arms for Sasuke/Naruto using Hashirama cells.  Why didn't they chop Guy's legs and put Hashirama legs as well? Is it because Hashirama cells are not compatible?  "
4365,Is Anima a Final Aeon?,in Final Fantasy X when Yuna's party is going though the old Blitzball Stadium in Zanarkand they see a memory of a mother hinting for her child to choose her to become the Final Aeon. then we see a young Seymour crying saying he doesn't want her to.  However in the Baaj Temple (where Tidas first awoke in Spira and met Rikku) is a Fayth which is revealed to be Seymour's mother who choose to become the Aeon Anima.  So is Anima a Final Aeon? If so why didn't Seymour fight Sin? if not then what happened in Zanarkand that prevented her becoming the Final Aeon but instead a regular Aeon? 
4366,How does the Sword of The Thunder God get stopped by a Kunai?,"I used to watch Naruto a long time ago and I remember there being a filler anime about people using lightning techniques..  One thing I remember specifically was that one of the ninjas was using a lightning weapon that was supposed to be able to cut through anything including Chakra...  The problem was that one of the Ninjas from Hidden Leaf if I remember correctly was fighting them and stopping the blade with a regular Kunai...  How does that work?  If the lightning weapon can cut through anything including Chakra why would a regular kunai stop it?  After a quick research the weapon is the Sword of the Thunder God... as stated on Naruto Wikia: Sword of the Thunder God - Narutopedia, the Naruto Encyclopedia Wiki     As shown in Aoi's fight with Naruto Uzumaki and Sasuke Uchiha, the   blade was shown to not only be able to easily cut through any solid   object, but also through chakra-based substances as well.   After rewatching the episodes again the person using the sword swung at a ninja then a couple of kunais is seen to drop to the floor blocking the attack...  The Kunais are seen to be intact... So if this sword can cut through anything why was his attack stopped by them? "
4367,How did Diamond Jozu lose his arm?,I have read in the wiki that Jozu's right arm was missing after the war. But I have never seen nor notice it in the anime.  And I can't find the part where he lost it.  So when and how did he lose his arm and who was he fighting with?? 
4368,"How does ""The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan"" relate to the Haruhi Suzumiya series?","MAL's page on The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan lists it as a spin-off for both The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya and The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya (2009).  How exactly does the new series relate to the others? Where does it fall into the timeline? Or is it completely independent aside from using the same characters - in which case, can it be watched without previously having watched any of the older series? "
4369,What is up with the World Map?,"In episode 10, inside General Yan's room there is a world map. The thing I got confused with is that, the story takes place in Tokyo but what the hack is with this map? Why doesn't it have the original world map?   "
4370,What is Dr. Kureha's secret?,"In the Drum Island arc, Dr. Kureha always asks this:    So, what is the secret of her youthfulness? Is it because of her medicine? Her lifestyle? Maybe she found a fountain of youth? "
4371,What is the meaning of the hand gestures on Zetsubou Restaurant's cover?,"It's been a while since I watched this anime, and today I suddenly realized that the four ladies on the cover of Zetsubou Restaurant aren't all doing the heart hand gesture, but in fact have 4 different gestures:    The four characters are, in order:   Abiru Kobushi Matoi Tsunetsuki Harumi Fujiyoshi Kiri Komori   Maybe it's been only an aesthetic choice, but given all the hidden messages in SZS, that's probably not the case.  Fujiyoshi's heart might signify romantic (yaoi?) love. Tsunetsuki's hands instead seem to be in a Yoni Mudra pose, maybe symbolizing lust? (since she was the stalker in the series)  Are the other 2 gestures also some kind of Mudra (yoga gestures)?   Maybe Kobushi's doing an Hasta Mudra (apparently it's supposed to reduce anxiety)? I'm not sure what would be the relationship with her character.  And what about Komori? Is there some meaning behind this? "
4372,Are CITY and Nichijou set in the same universe?,"Recently, I've started reading CITY, the manga that Arawi Keiichi started working on after finishing Nichijou.  There are apparently some Nichijou cameos in CITY, such as this blue-haired mangaka named ""Naganohara Daisuke"" who briefly appears in chapter 25, and also this book cover by someone named ""Ogi Wataru"", which briefly appears in chapter 59.  Does this mean CITY and Nichijou are set in the same universe? Or are these just easter eggs? Is there any other evidence, for example, word from the mangaka, or perhaps any additional cameos? "
4373,How can Boruto handle a Chōōdama Rasengan?,"We see that at the end of Boruto:Naruto the Movie,      Boruto defeats the enemy by hitting him with what it seems a Chōōdama Rasengan (IMHO it looks larger than a Chōōdama Rasengan). I think Naruto infused some of his chakra in Boruto's jutsu to make it that big.   We see it took time for Jiraiya and Naruto to master the Rasengan, and Naruto was actually the only one to take it to the next level by adding his wind chakra (at the time).  So how can Boruto handle this large amount of chakra? Yes everyone says that Boruto can easily beat Naruto if you compare them at the same genin stage of their lives, but that doesn't mean Boruto is trained to manipulate such an insane amount of chakra. How was he able to pull it off? "
4374,What was the point of the angels?,"In retrospect, what was the point of the angels at all? The goal of NERV and etc. was the Human Instrumentality Project. Why go through the effort of killing fifteen angels? And even if you could say they had to establish peace for the moment to go ahead with the project, that just makes the entire plot of the angels a waste. So what was the point? "
4375,"What does ""Full Cowling"" mean?","Cowling: the removable cover of a vehicle or aircraft engine. So when Deku uses One for All-Full ""Cowling"" (as spelled in subs), does it refer to him removing the limiter on his power, or is it just mispronounciation ? Shouldn't it be ""calling"" instead?  "
4376,Why couldn't they make a vessel for Adam sooner?,"In Evangelion, why couldn't they have made a vessel for Adam sooner or brought an angel close to have started the Human Instrumentality Project.  What was the point of Rei also then? Making a vessel for Lilith's soul hardly serves the purpose of the project, and will go to waste anyways when it occurs. How was she significant to the project and what is her significance? "
4377,How much strong is at least Golden Cooler?,"In the Super Dragon Ball Heroes manga #2 we see      Golden Cooler defeats Goku SSJ Berserker who defeated Super Saiyan Blue Vegita (correct me if I'm wrong, this is what I got from the translation of the black and white manga)    How much strong is at least Golden Cooler then?       Does defeating Goku puts him over Super Saiyan Blue Kaioken x20 (since Goku manages that technique) or since Goku was possessed that shouldnt count? Any other logic or hint or source I'm missing?    "
4378,is Tina Sprout an initiator and a mechanical soldier?,"In the subbed episodes of Black Bullet I'm watching, if rightly translated, they seem to say Tina Sprout is a mechanical soldier? is this so? Why an initiator who already has superhuman habilities (enhaced strenght, speed, recovery, etc.) would need mechanical parts? "
4379,Why can't Kakashi use Lightning Cutter properly after losing his Sharingan?,"Is Kakashi's new technique Lightning Release: Purple Electricity as powerful as his signature technique, the Lightning Cutter?  On Naruto Wiki, it is written that after losing his Sharingan, Kakashi can't use Lightning Cutter properly. What does this mean?  "
4380,Why does Eiken have his camera?,"In the first part of the manga Cage of Eden, when Sengoku, Oomori, and Mariya went to the plane crash site, they saw the video camera that was being used by Eiken. They saw what happened on days they are not at the site abd they found it left inside the plane but Eiken is not in there. In first part of that arc, it is also implied that Eiken left the camera on the plane and made Rion the one to use the camera (she's the one who captured the scene about stabbing the pilot.)  So when everyone was gone, Sengoku found Eiken's camera inside the plane, where he also found Rion.   Meaning to say, Eiken should not be carrying his camera when they went to other places.    But when they went to the Top of the Mountain, there is a short slide that shows Eiken using his camera zooming wide distance in order to see the antenna tower,  So how is that so?? If Eiken left his camera inside the plane, how does he hold it when their group was on the top of the mountain?  To clarify things, Eikens group arrived first in the antenna tower before Sengoku's group.  Is this a mistake of the author? "
4381,How does the work relation between Shichibukai and the World Government?,"Shichibukai are pirates who have allied themselves with the World Government. But how does it work between them? What are their rule between each other? All Shichibukai have a bounty, is that means if they got caught they still got punished? On Crocodile side, he work against the World Government, so the World Government sent him to jail. And Jinbe got jailed because he refuse to help the World Government to fight against Shirohige. But what if they didn't do anything wrong and someone able to defeat them and give them to the World Government? Are the World Government still punished them? "
4382,"Golden Cooler vs Golden Freezer in Dragon Ball Heroes, which one is supposed to be stronger?","In the last episode of the Dragon Ball Heroes miniseries we've seen Cooler turning into its Golden Form. As we know Cooler has one form more than Freezer, so the logical conclusion would be than Golden Cooler is stronger than Golden Freezer, but in the other hand we see that Golden Cooler 5th form (the one before turning into gold) is having a tied battle with Goku super saiyan 2 Berserker. I dont know what the rest of the manga (the former Dragon Ball Heroes manga) or the videogame has to show about Golden Freezer, but from the main continuity (which I dont know if it counts in this case) we know Freezer 4th form was able to handle a Goku apparently using god ki (which it would be as a strong as a super saiyan god) . Who is supposed to be stronger then, Golden Cooler or Golden Freezer? Does the former Dragon Ball Heroes manga or the videogame has something to show about this?      "
4383,"Why go through so much trouble to show a character is staring by having her say or shout ""stare""?","In several anime shows, when a character is staring at another, the character actually says ""stare"" (sometimes with the ""stare"" in written form too not unlike manga - not the subtitles).  From the context and the animation, the stare is obvious, so why go the extra mile and literally shout ""stare""??  This is not about the lightning display when two characters stare into each other. It is about saying or shouting stare when staring.    I understand that in manga you have to put those things in written form, so this question is restricted to anime media. "
4384,How could the Marines catch Zoro?,"The first time Luffy met Zoro, Zoro got caught by the Marines because he killed Helmeppo's pet wolf.    He was already strong at that time, he could easily defeat Morgan, a Marine Captain there. Had he deliberately made himself get caught? Why did he do that? "
4385,Is there hard proof for the Curse of Ymir?,"As far as I know, the Survey Corps (and other relevant Elderians) learned of the Curse of Ymir (that a titan shifter only has 13 years to live and if not eaten, will die to have his titan power born again with a random Elderian) from the memories of Grisha Jäger, who in turn learned it from the Owl. The Marleyian army seems to be aware of the course as well. Owl probably got his information from the army or the Taybar family.  Now I wonder, is it guaranteed that this information is correct? From a narrative POV I don't believe the author will just wave his hands and say ""The curse never really existed, sorry!"", but from an POV from within the world, it would make sense that this is misinformation, deliberately given by King Fritz to protect Elderians outside Paradise (so they are not deliberately killed off as long as they can be used).  I want to know if there is hard proof that the curse is real? This can be witnessing it in the main series or spinoffs (I didn't really follow AoT - After the Fall so much) or in interviews with the creators.   Something ominous, deliberately question-dodging like ""Well, the characters got told so."" in the interviews would be interesting too. After all, the characters got also told that titans are mankind's enemy, that you die if eaten by a titan, that Paradise Elderians' are devils etc. Information given in AoT through characters cannot be trusted, as we know after all these years :D "
4386,"Details about ""Zettai Junpaku Mahou Shoujo""",I recently saw the OVA for Zettai Junpaku Mahou Shoujo on Youtube but couldn't find out anything else about it.  Is this an existing or preview teaser of some anime? Is there a manga series?  There are some details on myanimelist.net but it's just a review of the OVA. 
4387,Why didn't the entire village know Naruto was Minato's son?,"Besides the out of universe reason that his identity was hidden as a plot device, is there any in universe reason people don't know Naruto is the 4th Hokage's son?  After all, Minato was married to Uzumaki Kushina. She must have been pregnant for a while before her and Minato's death. Being the wife of the 4th Hokage, she must have been, at least to some degree, a celebrity figure. Everybody would have known she was pregnant. She must have been sporting a good baby bump for at least a couple months before her death. Shortly after the time of her death, there's suddenly a newborn baby named Uzumaki Naruto wandering around (that happens to have a striking resemblance to the 4th, which becomes more and more obvious as he ages), and nobody made the connection they were related?     Suddenly orphaned, Naruto was left to grow up knowing nothing of his parents, receiving only his mother's last name because the Third Hokage thought that it was best that nobody knew that he was related to the Fourth Hokage.   I know that the Third hid his relation to the 4th, but simply using the 4th's wife's last name doesn't seem like it would be very effective. Was that really all it took to fool just about EVERYBODY? Is there some other explaination to Naruto's anonymity?  "
4388,What exactly happens to Kyuubei at the end of Rebellion?,"Note: this topic was somewhat addressed in this question, but remained unclear to me after reading the answers to it.  At the end of Rebellion, after Homura has rebelled and created the Homuverse where everyone can have their desires for love and friendship fulfilled, after the end credits, we see Homura in a field, holding her new soul gem and dancing around a mangy, scruffy, miserable-looking Kyuubei.      As the movie ends, the camera closes in on Kyuubei's face, and we see its eyes seem to be ringed with the same black field as the witches' curses.     What exactly is going on here? It seems clear that Homura is torturing Kyuubei for its many crimes, but what exactly is she doing? "
4389,What's with the timing of the OP and ED in Minami-ke?,"I've seen other anime where opening sequences are placed much later in the episode, sometimes as far as halfway through. Rarely endings begin a bit early, with a short (cliffhanger) scene following. In Minami-ke Okaeri endings are placed a good third of the episode away from the actual end, acting like a scene breaker. What's up with that? Why such odd timing? "
4390,What language are the spells/chants in?,"In Brave 10, when a character goes to use a spell's incantation or uses a chant for a secret technique, the subtitles don't have any English words in it (I am referring to the home release by NISA, not fansubs). However, it does sound like they are saying something in Japanese. An example of this is in episode 2 when Hanzo Hattori goes to use Pure Flame Samadhi on Saizo.  I am wondering, what language are the spells/chants being said in? Or did they just throw random characters together? "
4391,Is there any cross-reference between Aku no Hana and Inside Mari?,"They supposedly share the same universe, but is there any element from one series referenced in the other?  Isao Komori is from the same region where Aku no Hana happens (and is the birthplace of both series' creator). Is it the only link, or is there anything else? "
4392,Anyone know the name of these One Piece Osts?,"I've been having trouble identifying some One Piece Osts used in the anime. I've taken up the task of re-watching some of the arcs for One Piece as I'm waiting for the manga to update and I came across some battle osts in the Enies Lobby arc that I tried to find out but have had no luck so far. It's been about maybe 2 and a half weeks since I've been looking for these, but no luck so far. The osts are at the beginning of the videos of these links.   [website][website]In both links, the ost I'm looking for is the first one played in the background of the fights. Any help would be much appreciated. I'm really stumped with the names of these osts "
4393,Can a Burst Warrior use any Burst Heart?,"I learned that Pokemon can combine with a person in a process known as ""Burst"".  Apparently the Pokemon are inside a crystal known as a Burst Heart and ""one must go through rigorous training or else their life will be in danger if they attempt it"".  My question, then, is if the training is Pokemon specific or works for all cases.  So if a person has trained to Burst with a Pikachu Burst Heart, could they also Burst with a Geodude?  If so, could the person Burst with multiple Pokemon at once? "
4394,Can Ghouls be killed with bullets?,"In the last episode of the first season a lot of special forces with machine guns attacked the Aogiri Tree. My question is, given the regenerative abilities Ghouls have, can  they be killed with machine guns? If they can't be killed, what's the point of using them? And if they can be killed, what's the point of using Quinques if you can kill Ghouls with long range weapons? "
4395,Why is Yukihira Soma not famous at Tōtsuki Culinary Academy?,"It is a known fact that Yukihira Soma is the son of one of the world's most famous chefs, Yukihira Joichiro, but why is it that the students from Tōtsuki Culinary Academy don't know about Soma?  It's even stranger that Nakiri, who is known as the God's Tongue for her extreme tasting skills, admires Joichiro but fails to realize that Yukihira Soma is the son of Yukihira Joichiro. She had seen Soma's application form, so it must have given her a hint already. One of the few people (or maybe the only one) who seems to know about this fact is the headmaster.  Why is that? Are they trying to hide the fact that Soma is the son of Joichiro, probably for some unknown reason? "
4396,How does one play Gungi?,"In Hunter × Hunter (2011), Komugi and Meruem play a game called Gungi. It's a fictional game which appears to take conceptual origins from chess, Go, and other strategic board games.    We see tidbits of it played here and there, but I'm left to wonder: How is it played? What are the rules? "
4397,How exactly did Obito escape from Itachi's Amaterasu?,"Itachi attacked Obito with Amaterasu through Sasuke's eyes, when Sasuke saw Obito's Sharingan. As soon as Obito was engulfed by the flames, he went into the dark region of the room and got rid of the lethal flame. How did he do it? Did he achieve that with Kamui? "
4398,What is the color of the State alchemist pocket watch?,So in my re-reading of the Fullmetal Alchemist series I remember them describing the State Alchemist issue pocket watch as being golden in color. But then in the both of the animes they show the pocket watch as being silver. Why is this different? and what is the true color of the pocket watch? 
4399,Why Japan makes most of Manga's which supplied to the world?,"Almost 99% Manga are written in Japan. Why is that so? Do they have any culture which support it? e.g. Naruto, One Piece, Death Note, Fairy Tale, Bleach etc. "
4400,What are the names of the characters in Gurren Lagann derived from? And how do they relate to the characters?,"The second DVD of the first movie Gurren Lagann The Movie: Childhood's End, and also one of the disc in Complete Bluray Box Set feature a quiz session between the voice actors for Youko (Inoue Marina), Shimon (Kakihara Tetsuya) and Kamina (Konishi Katsuyuki) about various details in the anime.  In the first quiz of the show, it is mentioned that one of the special features in Gurren Lagann is the names of the characters: [シモン]{Shimon} comes up [下]｛Shimo｝ (down), [カミナ]{Kamina}　comes up [上]{Kami} (up), and the answer to the quiz reveals that [リーロン]{Leeron} comes from [論理]{Ronri} (logic).  How about other characters in Gurren Lagann? What are their names derived from, and how do they relate to the characters?  Feel free to explain the relation between the names and the characters already mentioned above. "
4401,"Can an order be Remembered / ""Sanity"" be kept","As we know, if Lelouch uses his Geass, there is a small gap in memory from the order until it has been done.  My question is, can it be arranged so that if Lelouch's geass is used on someone, that person will remember the order after it has been done?  For example, can Lelouch order ""Hide this box, and remember where you hide it.""? The keyword here is remember - as in the person I geassed will remember it. Notice it's not a direct order that is ordered by a query (""When I snap my fingers, tell me where you hid it"")  Was this explored in the Anime? What about the OVAs or supplemental materials? "
4402,How do fishmen produce water when there is no water around?,"I was watching the fight between Luffy and Hody, when Hody tries to use the attack where he shoots water bullets (I think it's called Yabusame).  So I was wondering how he can produce so much water when there is no water around him? Is that some quality of the fishmen or am I missing something?  Here's the image from the fight.   "
4403,How powerful is the Rinne Sharingan?,"It's clear now that Rinnegan boasts the most powerful dojutsu out of the 3 dojutsu (not including Tenseigan here).  There are few occurrence where we got to saw Rinne Sharingan in action. So, where does it put the power of Rinne-Sharingan?  The current power level is laid out as such:   Sharingan 1st &lt; Sharingan 2nd &lt; Sharingan 3rd &lt; Byakugan &lt; Mangekyo Sharingan &lt; Eternal Mangekyo Sharingan &lt; One eye Rinnegan &lt; Both eyes Rinnegan  Where does the Rinne Sharingan lie? "
4404,What happened in the fight between Zoro and Monet?,"In the Punk Hazard Arc, Zoro has a fight with a logia named Monet. She had the snow snow no mi power. In that fight Zoro defeated Monet not using haki but using some form of fear relating to an animal.   How exactly did zoro defeat Monet using this new ability of his? What this ability of his do? Have we seen the same ability like this being used by someone else? "
4405,Kazusa true ending. Explanation of Setsuna's epilogue,"In the visual novel White Album 2 in Coda if you choose Kazusa then Haruki breaks up with her fiancee Setsuna.  While Kazusa seems quite elated with his choice (she says that having Haruki return to her side is the best thing that could happen to her and that she's never known such happiness), Setsuna didn't take it so well (She asks Kazusa why must she steal Haruki, hogging all the happiness. Setuna thinking she hates Kazusa and that she's her enemy makes it look she feels resentment).  My question is about Setsuna. She didn't take the breakup too well (She tried to commit suicide. Luckly the hit from that car didn't do anything to her). 2 years afterwards in Kazusa's true ending we see an epilogue where Setsuna is depressed and she's playing Haruki's guitar.  Can someone explain why she's playing Haruki's guitar? Why would she learn how to play that instrument when Haruki had been so cruel to her? "
4406,Is Hellsalem's Lot a reference to Jerusalem?,"Hellsalem's Lot, the current name of formerly New York City, immediately strikes me as a reference to Jerusalem, since they sound extremely close.  In fact, in Japanese, they only differ by one mora:     ヘルサレムズ・ロット (Hellsalem's Lot) vs. エルサレム (Jerusalem).   Is Hellsalem's Lot a reference to Jerusalem? If that is the case, what are the aspects in Hellsalem's Lot that make reference to Jerusalem? "
4407,I'm looking for an anime/movie that involved a plot with 2 boys and 1 girl. Had a piano. Something about different dimensions?,"This was either a short anime or animated movie.  3 main characters, as far as I remember. I remember that out of the 2 boys, one was a boy who was from a different planet(dimension?). He played the piano and it had strange effects on those around him. The other boy was human. The human boy and the girl were friends. This anime probably had a school setting.  I remember there being a lot of scenes involving the alien boy going into another dimension where there was always a bed(?) that he talked to. The boy's mission was probably (not sure!) to bring humans back to his home planet...  In the end, the 2 boys decided to leave earth so that alien guy could return to his home and the girl was left behind. As soon as the boys left, the girl lost all her memories about them.  Have been searching for ages now, but I always get Piano no Mori as a result back and that's not it.  Thanks for your help! "
4408,"Where is the translation of ""Dona Dona"" from?","In episode 16, what appears to be a Japanese translation of ""Dona Dona"" plays twice -- once where Nanami has a dream where she, like the calf in the song, is sent away to her death, and once right after Utena removes the cowbell.  I know that there are translations of this song (which seems to originally have been in Yiddish) -- there's a recording of Joan Baez singing it in English on YouTube, and Wikipedia lists a bunch of other languages.  Given that I doubt Japan has a particularly large Jewish presence compared to the other countries indicated by the languages listed on Wikipedia, I'm wondering about the Japanese translation: who did the translation, and when did a translated version of the song first appear? Did a translation exist before Utena? "
4409,Why did L trust the handcuff so much?,"Episode 20     L: If I die, as long as I have this (handcuffs), you'll share the same fate as me   Okay, excuse my language, but what is up with that? It's just a handcuff, you'll be able to chainsaw it or something!  If L thought that far and actually made the chain indestructible (Maybe he used titanium or something!?), we would have probably been able to pick it.  IF (highly unlikely) L actually took every precaution, L's body is not going to be as strong as the metal.  So why did he trust it so much? Was it a bluff/joke? "
4410,How did Edward manage to defeat Father?,"I remembered watching a battle scene from the 2009 anime titled Fullmetal Alchemist and was puzzled by how Edward Elric managed to throw volley of punches at Father, a homunculus or the dwarf in the flask whom had earlier absorbed an entity and gained the power of God.  Is it because the power of God cannot be controlled and led to Father's defeat, or because the absorbed homunculus or souls are revolting inside Father thereby restricting Father's focus on a battle? How did Elric win this seemingly impossible fight? What happens to Father after vanishing into thin air? Did he return to the flask? "
4411,Why didn't Mr. Satan know about Z Warriors and their abilities?,"Mr. Satan was a professional martial artist. Surely, he was also a buffoon, but from what we've seen he is definitely very strong and skilled by the standards of someone who was never trained by someone like Kami or Kaioshin. In Dragon Ball series, he would probably be a decent opponent for Goku or Tien.  He also wasn't completely stupid - you don't become champion, millionaire and world star by not knowing what are doing.   In the real world, it takes a mixture of raw talent, hard work, and passion to achieve such level, and we have no reason to assume that it's any different in Dragon Ball universe.  Now, to finally get to the point:   How come that he never came across stories about people like Master Roshi? How come he didn't watch 21st, 22nd and 23rd Tournaments, where flying, Kamehamehas, disappearing and other strange techniques were common? How come he had no idea about Tien (who won 22nd Tournament)?   Satan must have been a young boy or teenager, and if he had the passion for martial arts, people like Tournament Winners should be like Gods to him. And yet, after these Tournaments, Mr. Satan doesn't recognize Goku, Piccolo or the other Z-Fighters.   Mind that I'm not questioning why he kept on insisting that everything that happened during Cell Games was a ""trick"" - he wouldn't want to admit that he was outclassed - but why was he actually and genuinely surprised.  "
4412,"Where does Natsu and his party get money from, to pay their living cost?","I started watching Fairy Tail and have just finished the Galuna Island arc where, once again, the reward is turned down for pointless ""moral"" reasons.  Unlike One Piece (where they can just steal/procure food and such), they do actually require money for paying rent and such.  Do we ever actually see Natsu's party claim a reward? Otherwise, where do they get their money from to pay their living cost?  "
4413,Are the scenes in the opening theme content from later episodes?,The episode 629 of One Piece is out with a new opening theme. The opening shows scenes from dressrosa arc ( which I have read in manga ) which will be covered in the future episodes ( in the range of 30-40 future episodes ).  Are these episodes have already been produced and scenes cut from these episodes are used in the opening or are these short scenes are made just for the opening theme?   If future episodes are produced before hand then roughly how many episodes are produced in advance?  
4414,How does the Steins;Gate phone microwave work?,"The operation of the phone microwave in Steins;Gate is confusing me. I finished episode 9, and I don't fully understand how it works; except that it allows texts to be sent in the past, 1 second on timer = 1 hour in reality, and that messages can only be sent during 12pm-6pm.  Can someone explain the rest of the microwaves' operation?  1) the bananas turning green, and why the first green batch wouldn't transport?  2) why did Mayuri's chicken tenders burn? can food be cooked like normal, or is their microwave permanently modified?  3) why a phone is hooked up to the microwave, what is the significance in connecting it, and why is it no longer needed in future episodes?  4) in reference to question 3, what type of connection was the phone connected by? USB?  5) why does the timer always seem to be set to 120?  6) what do the orange numerals above the timer numerals mean?  7) how is data sent? how are objects sent?  8) what is the cause of the electrical discharge? and why does it appear at different intervals?  9) is there significance behind the rotation of the microwave table? does clockwise move time forward, and vice versa?  10) how is a modern day text message able to be routed to a 90s pager?  11) what is the large flat radio device sitting on top of the microwave, and what is its purpose?  12) what the heck is a CRT (Cathode Ray Tube)? the landlord wears clothing with CRT related phrases on them "
4415,Why Kuroko call Misaka with onee-sama?,"I just watched Toaru Kagaku no Railgun and it seems like Kuroko is in love with Misaka (?) and call her onee-sama, but when did it start? and how did this happen? "
4416,"Dragon Ball Super anime and manga. Do elements and concepts which exists in one, also exists in the other?","Until now, we've seen some elements from the Dragon Ball Super anime which doesnt appear in the manga, and viceversa, some elements from the manga which doesnt exist in the anime. For example, in the anime we've seen the super saiyajin blue kaioken and the super saiyan rage transformation, but we havent seen those in the manga, and in the manga we've seen (recently added spoilers)      Vegeta going super saiyan god (red) and a a technique where Vegeta is constantly switching from super saiyan god red and blue, red in repose and blue in brief moments of time when he attacks, to save energy and stamina    Do elements from one anime exists in the manga and viceversa? Or some elements are unique to each version and they wont appear in the other? "
4417,Why is gold important to Amestris' economy?,"I'm not too well versed in the laws of Amestris or its political climate, but the law only prohibits material transmutation to gold, besides human transmutation. I suppose transmutation to silver or other highly valued materials are still allowed, such as petrol, which is sometimes more valuable than gold in the real world. This leads me to believe that the only reason why it only prohibits gold is because the currency is backed by it.  Which leads me to the question, why couldn't they just use fiat currency instead? Why is gold so important to the Amestris economy when other precious metals and resources are allowed to be transmuted? "
4418,Why did Taeko's father hit her?,"Taeko (as a child) complains about not having a nice handbag and refuses to go out to dinner with the rest of the family. When she realises that they are willing to go without her, she bursts out the door after them - regretting the tantrum she just had.  Once she leaves the front door, her father hits her for seeing her come out the house with no shoes.  She recalls that this was the first time, and the only time, that her father had hit her.  I realise that she was being bratty, but what was so bad about leaving the house without shoes on (compared to having a selfish tantrum about handbags)? Is it a cultural thing? "
4419,In the orignal series does Hinata die?,"I just finished episode 46 (or 47) of the original series. Towards the end of the episode it shows Hinata being taken away, but it is never made clear whether she is dead or alive definitively. Naruto dips his fingers in her blood she coughed up, and says something about never losing. At first I thought that meant he was going to avenge her in some sort of way (implying death), but I'm not entirely sure.  This is sort of a two part question:   Is Hinata alive? Will she show up again in the original series, or does she end up coming back in Shippuden?   Keep in mind I've not watched past episode 51-ish, and I'm watching the original series. "
4420,What would've happened if Obito didn't accept Kabuto's help?,"If they weren't allies, how could Obito just think about capturing both the eight and nine-tails, and win a war in which he was challenging the 5 great nations?  His only weapons were the clones of the white Zetsu, which, regardless of their ""copy ability"", were such a big failure, and the Gedo statue, which was his trump card. In that way, Obito would stand against an Allied Shinobi Nation, who weren't weakened by the Edo Tensei reanimations, but obviously, he wasn't expecting that Kabuto would search for him and offer a helping hand, so I think that Obito was overestimated by Madara to think that he could manage a plan with such a great magnitude.  And as second thought, what were his plans for resurrecting Madara? Losing Nagato's 7th path, I'm curious how he would've managed this part of their plan. It's kind of luck for both Obito and Madara, that the events turned out as they are right now in the anime... "
4421,In which episode does this picture from the opening of K-ON! appear?,"In the first opening of K-ON!, the following appears at 35 seconds.    Which episode is that picture with Ritsu in the green clothing from? And what is the time mark in the episode? "
4422,"In Shingeki No Kyojin, when does Eren lose 3 years of his memory?","I was just reading asks on Attack On Titan and came upon this one What was Eren&#39;s vision about?  Where someone says in one of the answers that Eren lost three years of his memory due to his father experimenting on him? Can anyone tell me what volume of the manga this is from because I am all caught up and I don't remember this. I thought the timeline went like this (from the beginning of the manga/anime:   Dr.Jaeger says he's going into town to do some check ups The wall is broken The news reaches Dr.Jaeger (not sure how long this took) He kills the real royal family He goes after Eren (although I'm not sure how he found him??) Injects Eren (like we saw in his flashbacks), Eren eats him and he dies.   I'm also not sure how old Eren was when he ate his Dad? I think maybe he was 12 or quite young.  So in all this I don't remember his Dad doing any experiments on him or if was mentioned/explained/hinted anywhere? "

During the battle in Saint's Cradle, when Vita comes across spider like Gadget Drones, she remembers seeing them during the mission which led to Nanoha being critically injured, and she lets out her anger on them because they were apparently responsible for almost ruining Nanoha's life.  I am wondering, was the mission Vita and Nanoha did together where Nanoha was critically injured a Jail Scaglietti Investigation? If not, then what was the connection between Jail's Drones and that mission? "
4429,Did Sola-Ui truly love Lancer?,"Sola-Ui Nuada-Re Sophia-Ri, despite being Kayneth El-Melloi Archibald's fiancée, is shown not to particular like him, criticizing him about his strategy for not facing the other Masters face to face and hiding in the shadows while Lancer does all the work. However during the series it's shown she has developed feelings for Lancer.  Lancer however possesses a curse known as the Mystic Face which takes the form of a beauty spot on his face and causes any woman who looks at his face to instantly fall in love with him. During their first encounter at the port Saber was shown to be immune because of the High Magic Resistance those of the Saber Class obtain and pointed that out to Lancer (which lead to Lancer's identity).  So I am wondering, did Sola-Ui truly love Lancer? or did she fall in love with him only because of Lancer's curse? "

4439,Does Hisoka conjure cards?,"It is seen in anime that Hisoka hurls many cards, yet he never runs out of cards. He was never shown to buy, borrow or steal a deck of cards either. Moreover, he gets his cards out of nowhere in his hands (he never slips his hands into his pockets or his clothing to fetch cards).  So does he have the power of conjuring cards?  Similarly, does Illumi have the power of conjuring needles, and does Gotoh have the power of conjuring coins?  Or do they (i.e. Hisoka, Illumi and Gotoh) belong to the category of Emmiter? "

It was also found that not only One Piece but also Inu Yasha's Ending Theme song ""Every Heart"" was sung by a Kpop Artist which is BoA.  And Naruto's theme song ""Buterfly"" was sung by KARA.  I've Been watching anime since I was a kid (almost 20 years now), and I just recently got hooked in Kpop music. That's when I noticed this.

Are there any reasons for this? "

Can someone explain the ending to me, I'm not sure whether it was a good or bad ending. He completed his initial objective, but was that a good thing in order to fullfil his promise?   It are a lot questions but they are all related to the ending of season 2, hence why I didn't make several threads for this but just one. I am not really into novels or mange (yes it's weird I know) so I'd appreciate it if someone could explain the ending. Up to the point where he thought that he couldn't kill her but chose to go against his own instinct I could follow the storyline, but after that it all felt kinda rushed and I think those only watching the anime might've missed out on a lot important information. "
4446,"What is Aoi referring to when she says ""Comaneci""?","In episode 4 of Tesagure! Bukatsumono Spin-off Purupurun Sharumu to Asobou, at around 14:16 into the episode, when they are talking about making a new school song, Aoi interjects with an obscure reference ""Comaneci!"".    A quick search on the Internet point to Nadia Comăneci, who is the first female gymnast to be awarded a perfect score of 10 in an Olympic gymnastic event, among other achievements. However, I can't tell how it connects to the context here.

Koharu: Write the lyrics for a school song?      Hina: If the lyrics are used, they'll become a piece of school history.      Aoi: Comaneci!      Yua: All right!

When Heero woke up his helmet was removed and he immediately covered his face while asking Relena ""Did you see my face?"" as shown in this picture.

See in this video (sorry I just included Gundam Abridge-ning episode 1 dub parody of Gundam Wing)  What actually did Heero do? "
4454,Are Logia types overpowered?,"Logia types seem overpowered. Excluding the fact that they are practically invincible to anyone who is not a Haki user (if they can reflexively turn into their element), they have many more advantages:   Think about how outrageously powerful some of the Logia types could be if they were creative. Almost every other strong character in One Piece (Devil Fruit user or not) is strong because they were either creative as hell, had sheer strength and technique (Zoro), are Haki users with some sort of fighting ability or a combination of all three (of which Luffy is a perfect example). My point is, they all had to be creative or strong and skillful, with Haki to boot (sometimes). Let's be honest, most of the Logia types are so powerful because of their Fruits, I am not denying that their own, personal skill didn't attribute to some of their strength, but let's be real; you've got people like Enel, Kizara, Sakazuki and Ace. Pre-timeskip Ussop would be a formidable opponent with any of these Devil Fruits. It takes a lot of Logia types no physical training, and very little creativity to be a dangerous person to face. If these guys had creativity and didn't completely rely on their Devil Fruits' sheer power, very few people in the OP universe could beat them. Sakazuki could make his opponent's entire stepping ground a field of lava, he could simply make lava ""minions"" like mannequins made out of lava that could smash into his opponents. I'm sure there are more things he can do, I just made that off the top of my head. Anyways, there seems to be so much they could potentially do, that could wreck their opponent, but they are too comfortable in their abilities to even fathom needing more variety to beat someone. A Logia can produce limitless amount of their element, this screams overpowered. Someone as formidable as Hawkeye Mihawk could be rendered useless to Ace if he simply chose to send an island-sized fire ball, after all Logias can produce an endless amount of their element. Even if Hawkeye is very fast, Ace could simply use the fire ball if he neared him or if he moved out of sight, and nuke the entire area with it. I doubt even Hawkeye is fast enough to get out of the destruction the attack would cause. Or take another hypothetical situation, Enel verses Shanks. Shanks is one of the strongest characters in One Piece, but if Enel uses his supercharged mantra plus his ability to travel at the speed of sound, he would own Shanks within moments. This is a bit of a combo of my two points above, if they can control and manipulate their element in any fashion and use it limitlessly, couldn't they just create a repetitively powerful attack? Okay, some of them would need time for these attacks, but what about the extremely powerful ones that don't? Enel can easily send 200,000 volts into someone. I realize this won't immobilize some of the heavy hitters, but it would slow them the fuck down after he hit them with it for a second time. Kizara could just lock someone in a light cage and shrink it until they combusted inside, Ace could lock someone in a fire sphere and shrink, I am going off on what I read on Logias, that they can manipulate their element in any way, so they don't have to touch it to control it. Why hasn't anyone done this?   I would bring up other situations that a Logia could have dominated in a split second if they had simply thought of said tactic, but that would take too long. I know some Logia types are more restricted verses others, and don't follow the exact definition, but still most aren't. Logia types could easily destroy islands and kill strong people in moments, it is ridiculous considering Paramecia types and Zoans being on-par with them, some but not many. If we follow the Logia's definition, Logias should be dominating everyone, only challenged by other Logia types. It is the only way (that I know of) in which a weakling or complete idiot can become one of the most dangerous people in OP, maybe the idiot would die, but think about how easily he could decimate a town. And the weakling is worse, they could strategize with power and beat the shit out of anything. I know even the extremely powerful Logias can easily lose, but a lot of that is up to circumstance and they still have a better chance at winning unless they are fresh newbies.  Seriously, everyone else has to work their ass off to just compete with Logias, and they use almost non of the creative end of their powers and just rely on its sheer destructive nature, and I think Oda knows this. Oda probably knows almost no Logia uses their abilities to its fullest, not even a tenth of its potential, and is still extremely strong. It might be a long running joke. "
4455,"Which episodes of ""GITS: Arise − Alternative Architecture"" are covered by ""GITS: Arise − Border"" movies?","I recently watched Ghost in the Shell: Arise − Alternative Architecture episode 3 and was dismayed to find that the episode was pretty much a repeat of part of the Ghost in the Shell: Arise − Border 1 movie. I’d rather not re-watch the same content, so I was wondering    Which episodes of the TV series GITS − AA are covered by the GITS − Border movies? Are there any differences between the repeated stories (IE. extra scenes/new content/changed plot)?  "
4456,Is there any reason why the race takes place on Roboworld?,"Roboworld is a dangerous place for the racer. When they announced that the race was to be held in Roboworld, the President of Roboworld directly stated that they would not allow the race to be held there, and they would destroy any outsider who entered their territory by any means necessary. They know that Roboworld had many troops and weapons to stop the race. One of the racer even stated that Roboworld troops were the meanest troops in the galaxy. So why did they still decide to race there? Was there a reason behind it or did they just want an intense race? "
4457,Why are there omissions and discrepancies in Kaori's Kreutzer performance?,"In ep. 2, the entrants to the competition are shown playing extracts from the first movement of Beethoven's sonata no. 9 (often referred to as the Kreutzer). This is most likely the only movement played, given the portrayal of Kaori's performance and the length of the Kreutzer.  It would not be appropriate to show a performance of the entire movement. (It could bore viewers, and it could easily take up half the episode.) We can thus justify an abridgement of the piece or the removal of some of sections. The omissions I have found so far, however, do not make sense.   At the beginning, the section after the violin opening and before the statement of the theme (m. 5-18, mvt. 1) is omitted. The continuity of Kaori's movements might with the soundtrack imply that in-universe, she did not play those omitted bars, but it is unclear. Later after the piano finishes its reiteration of the theme, there is a pause (which exists in the original score). Kaori then jumps to a later section (the adagio shortly after), which is merged with the ending of the first movement. It seems that this jump also occurred in-universe. The ""bland"" part that the other violinists were shown playing, which should have fallen after adagio mentioned above, is skipped.   This leaves me with the following question. Is there any suggestion that the movement is actually being played with these omissions and discrepancies in-universe? If so, why would this be the case? Are these instead just badly executed (in that they are misleading) cuts? After all:   For the purposes of a performance used to assess musicians, certain omissions, particularly skipping repeats, could be acceptable. The sections involved do not fall into such a category. Surely if all the violinists are playing the same set piece in the same competition, there should not be any obvious variation in what is played, even if some parts are removed for length. The movement seems to be a reasonable length for a short performance, particularly if the one repeat that appears is taken out.  "
4458,Can a soul that is normally freed from the Edo Tensei be resurrected again?,"This Edo Tensei looks pretty complicated and annoying, since the revived one is immortal and powerful. As we've seen, every soul was freed and moved to the afterlife (by this I mean normally freed from the jutsu), so if someone decides to use this jutsu again, could it be possible to bring back again a dead person (meaning that until you run out of DNA samples and vessels, you can bring back anyone an infinite number of times)?  Being an exception, I'm not reading the manga, but unfortunately I know that the Hokage's are revived, and in the cases of Hashirama and Tobirama, they were revived a second time, BUT they were sealed in the Shinigami, so their souls aren't brought back from the pure world (again, I have no idea about their second arrival, please, no spoiler, just I've mentioned that they came from somewhere else).  So for example, could be Itachi brought back again and again with the Edo Tensei, or after his first revival and after his soul sealed, his soul would be ""blocked"" somewhere in the pure world, forbidding another resurrection of that soul? "
4459,"Is the Princess Tutu manga any different from the anime, and does it add anything to the story?","Per my knowledge, Princess Tutu's anime adaptation came first and was remade into a manga later on.

4461,How is CODE-E a prequel of MISSION-E?,"The code CODE-E series revolves around a girl that has the ability to generate electromagnetic waves. It basically follows the protagonist around in her ordinary life with the annoyance of wrecking almost anything that is electronic. After watching the last episode, I continued with MISSION-E and came across a completely different situation that suggests I have missed quite a portion of story.  How is CODE-E a prequel of MISSION-E? Should I watch/read something else? "
4462,Why was One Piece white washed?,"After the two-year time skip, Zoro and Robin came back lighter skinned. I would have thought nothing of it, but after searching for ""fishman racism"" on Google, I ran into an article on Oda's racism towards ""ethnic"" people. One Piece is my favorite anime and I watch it a lot, so I don't take any ""white washing"" argument lightly. I don't even want to think of Oda as having racial bias, but I won't ignore the facts.  The article discusses different aspects of One Piece that can lead one to believe that the show has some racist undertones, but I won't go into detail about the article. The story about racism in One Piece mentions that Oda did tell the animators to change certain things concerned with the two-year time skip, and two of the dark-skinned characters came back way lighter. Is Oda racist? I don't know but I can't say he isn't, as the article had valid and reasonable points to prove that he at least has a racial bias.  Then after reading the article above, I am sitting around thinking about it from time to time. So was it actually white washed or did these changes happen for some other reason?    "
4463,Why is it that some anime use language exclusive to the Yakuza?,"I was reading an article on language-learning hacks recently, and #13 of that list states (emphasis mine),     Some popular anime (popular in America at least, and mostly reserved for little boys in Japan) uses the kind of language which is in the real world almost exclusively reserved for Yakuza.   Is this statement true? What are some examples of this, and why is it done? "

Who are ""those guys from Season 4"" that the song references who are apparently a joke?  Unfortunately, the YGO:TAS is a very extensive series at this point, and I am not familiar with all of the episodes. "
4465,Would Nyu have developed murderous tendencies after enough time had passed?,"When Lucy is forced into her 'Nyu' personality, she is reduced to a basic level of intelligence, with a diminished vocabulary and no access to her vectors. As the chapters progress, we see her begin to learn - specifically new words, like 'Kouta' and 'Yes'.  Early in the story, we learn that Diclonius children gain access to their vectors and begin to kill humans at around the age of 3. Given that Nyu is in a childlike state, and that she's learning much like a normal Diclonius child would, does that mean that she too would begin to murder humans after around 3 years?  Or would the fact that she isn't actually a child mean those consequences wouldn't occur?  I've already finished the story, so no need to worry about spoilers.    Side note: If I remember rightly, at some point in the later chapters (just before Kaede house is attacked), a particular event occurs where Nyu regains most of her intelligence, and can string together proper sentences. I can't remember exactly what happens, since it's been a while since I've read it, but for the question's sake, let's just assume that never happened, and Nyu stayed as she originally was. "
4466,How did abridged versions of anime get started?,"I was watching anime clips on YouTube and I stumbled upon an abridged version of an anime. The process of dubbing an anime using the same scenes but with a different voice and script, they were changing the dialogues of characters to make it funny.  This is an example video  It was Gundam Wing (Entitled ""Gundam Abridged-ning"")   So how did this kind of voice dubbing and making it more funny get started? "

4468,How does navigation work in One Piece universe?,"The navigation devices in the One Piece universe are:   The compass for the Eastblue, Southblue, Westblue, Northblue The Log-Pose for the Grand Line The New-World Log-Pose for the New World   Other navigation instruments (in exceptional cases) are:   The Eternal-Pose for Grandline (always points at the same island) The South Birds on Jaya whose bills always point south. The Kame-Pose who always points to Mecha   All of these navigation instruments have limitations and disadvantages. The compass, for example, does not work for the Grandline and New World. The Log-Pose can follow only one magnetic wave and takes time to record the next magnetic wave. And the Eternal-Pose works for only one island.  As you can see, navigation in the One Piece universe is very complicated. And this is the point where my question is. Besides the Eleven Supernovas, all other pirates, marines and other ships are free to travel through the whole Grandline and Blues, and to go on any island they want.  In episode 392, Shakuyak explains how hard it is to travel through the Grand Line for the Eleven Supernovas as they tried to get to the Sabaody Archipel. However, the Marines and other pirates commute easily between every island. Do they have an extra expensive Eternal-Pose for every island?  So why is navigation so easy for the Marines and other pirates whereas it is so hard for the Straw Hat crew (as example)? "
4469,"Limitations on ""plunder"" ability?","Charlotte is a very interesting show featuring people with powerful abilities, but all of them have limitations. For example, the ""time jump"" ability makes the user's vision fade, and the ""high speed"" ability causes the user to move at an uncontrollable but very fast speed. The ""plunder"" ability is introduced late in the game, and it       allows the user to steal other ability-wielder's abilities.   However, as far as I can remember, there was never a limitation for this ability explicitly declared. Did I miss something? Are there no limitations? "
4470,Who is Hanazawa Hanako?,"I was rewatching the first season of Oregairu the other day, and something caught my eye on the list of contacts on Hachiman's phone (which we see in episode 5, after Yui adds herself as a contact).     The list here is:   Komachi Grandpa's Home Soubu High School Takatsu Dentistry Dad Barbershop Hanazawa Hanako (花沢華子) Mom 💕✨🎀✨💕Yui💕✨🎀✨💕   So we have Hachiman's relatives; places he goes (school, dentist, barber); and now Yui.

4472,Where can I buy Anime/Manga based Jigsaw Puzzles?,I have started doing jigsaw puzzles with a friend and we were hoping to find one for FLCL but I was not able to find any (on American online stores at least). My Google-fu is pretty terrible though. So are there any American or Japanese (or other) stores that sell Anime based Puzzles? I am specifically looking for FLCL as I said but I was barely able to find any at all so anything would be appreciated. Or is my search futile and Puzzles are just an uncommon piece of Anime merchandise?

But would it be possible to possess more than one type of magic? For example: Natsu being able to use Fire Dragon Slayer Magic and and also being able to use Magic like Gray's Ice-Make spells? Or are there rules for his Dragon Slayer Magic not allowing him to use different kinds of Magic?  
4475,How come Zorro's slash become a fire?,One Piece chapter 467 when Zoro fighting Samurai Ryuuma at the end of their fight Zorro slash him down and his wound become a fire? Is there any explanation about this? I don't remember Zorro doing something like this again later.   
4476,What did they use for their toast?,"In episode 17 of Kill la Kill, Kiryūin Satsuki brings out a toast to their success with what looks like a cup of sake. But, considering it is a school and they are between the ages of 16 and 19, they shouldn't be allowed to drink this yet, right? So what did they toast with?    "
4477,Is there any meaning behind Zoro's headband?,"When Zoro gets serious, he always wear his headband. Where did he get that? How did it become so important to him? Is there any back story about it (Maybe from a movie or something)? "
4478,"Is the setting of D.N.Angel based on a real world location, and if so, which one?","Some anime and movies feature and are shown with real world locations.  For example, this post gives some of the real world locations involved in anime such as 5 Centimeters Per Second (Shinjuku and Tanegashima) and Kiki's Delivery Service (Visby, a town on the Swedish island of Gotland).  I was wondering: where does D.N.Angel take place? Is it based on a real world location? "

4480,What is the limit of the Death Eraser?,"The Death Note Wikia states that...        The Death Eraser can revive the people that have been killed by the note   The Death Eraser is an artefact      In the wikia is also states  if you wrote ""dies from a tragic accident or something"",would the person's wounds or destroyed body parts be healed?  Which lead me to ask what is the limits of the Death Eraser and if you wrote ""commits suicide by gun"" and you used the Death Eraser to bring them back, would the wounds heal even though they come back to life? "
4481,How does the travel works in One Piece universe?,"I have noticed that traveling between and within the oceans in the One Piece world isn't easy.    However, the Marines and some advanced pirate crews/alliances commute daily between the oceans. To be more specific, here are a few examples to demonstrate what I mean:   The Marines travels between every oceans they want. By using Seastone on their ships, they can easily travel through the Calm Belt and switch between the Grand Line/New World and all Blues. Because the Marines is a member of the World Government, they can also pass the Red Line via Mary Joa.  However, the Seastone technique (Episode 410) is a new invention from Dr. Vegapunk. How did the Marines travel through the Calm Belt so easy before that? Another example in episode 502-503: How did a World Government ship travel from the Grand Line to East Blue 10 years ago when Seastone technique hadn't been invented? In Luffy's past, Shanks was in the East Blue, then in the Battle of Marine Ford, he was again in Grand Line, etc.  Same for Whitebeard. One time, Whitebead was in the Grand Line, then in the East Blue, and then again in the Grand Line, etc.  How do Shanks and Whitebeard manage to travel between the Grand Line and the Blues on daily basis? Do Whitebead, Shanks and other Pirates also use Seastone like the Marines? And what about Monkey D. Dragon? One time, Dragon was in the East Blue. Here, he was again in the Grand Line.   So I hope you see what my question is. I'm especially curious about the daily switching between the Grand Line/New World and Blues. As I know, the only way to enter the Grand Line is via the Reverse Mountain, which isn't the most harmless way as you can see in episode 61. Does that mean that every time Whitebeard and Shanks want to go to the Grand Line, they have to pass this small river with their gigantic ships?  Apart from getting to the Grand Line, how do they leave the Grand Line/New World? According to the maps, there is no way to get out. How did Krieg leave the Grand Line? "
4482,For what reasons do manga get banned?,"Thanks to the question Is there a list of banned manga artist whose work are not translated into English, which now is deleted. I was wondering, what are the reasons for manga to be banned? and does the same ruling apply to doujinshi?   I would assume there is a general rule set that is applied upon works after release, which determines if it should be banned, or at least some sort of measure to weigh it by.  "
4483,Are the peculiar One Piece laughs based on anything?,"In One Piece, there are several strange laughs such as    Donquixote Doflamingo with his Fuffuffuffuffu Dorry with his Gegyagyagyagya    Are laughs like these based on anything? Or are they just randomly chosen for comedic purposes ?  "
4484,Is there an official site for anime and manga ranking?,"Is there any official site for anime and manga ranking? I know some site for anime and manga, and they have some kind of rating and ranking, but their rating and ranking are different. I'm wondering if there are any official site for anime, maybe something like IMDB? Honestly, I don't really know if IMDB is official or not, but if someone is to ask for the rating of a movie, they always say to look it in IMDB. "
4485,Is Seki Tekko (the red glove with a blood drawing wristband) a part of Senketsu?,"Ryuuko uses Seki Tekko, the glove with a wristband to pierce her skin and draw blood that Senketsu needs to transform and give her power. That glove was given to Ryuuko by Aikuro Mikisugi (the teach in pilot shades) in episode 2.     It is colored red and is exactly what  Ryuuko needs to make use of Senketsu effectively. Was it just lying around in the teacher's closet for punishing  bad students and just happened to fit, or did Mikisugi make it specifically for Ryuuko? Where does this glove come from? "
4486,Who are Byakuya and Juushirou referring to in chapter 117?,"At the beginning of chapter 117 of Bleach, Juushirou Ukitake says, ""Byakuya... Who is he?"" (referring to Ichigo) and Byakuya replies, ""He's not related. At least not ... to the one you're thinking of. He's no one. Just a ryoka. I'll dispose of him. And then... this trifling conflict... will come to an end.""  Who is Byakuya referring to when he says, ""He's not related. At least not ... to the one you're thinking of.""? Or another way to say it, who did Juushirou Ukitake think that Ichigo was related to? "
4487,"What's this music in ""World of Ice""?","In ""World of Ice"" (ep. 9), there is music that starts off with something that sounds like a harpsichord, after Himari enters a hidden door in the library (around 6:11). Strings (mostly playing pizzicato, I think) and a clarinet come in later. Normally I'd assume that this might be something original created from the anime &mdash; for instance, I've heard stuff that could pass as classical music in the Monogatari Series.  However, I've noticed pieces that were clearly not original being used in this series, such as the beginning of Mozart's Piano Sonata K. 331 (when Himari is still in the normal section of the library), or the famous theme from Dvořák's 9th symphony (in ""Because I love him""). Thus, it seems plausible that this is not original music.  What is the music playing here? I tried to look up the soundtrack or the episode on the fan-made wiki, but neither gave a full listing. Is this original music, and if not, where is this music from?  Update: If I'm not mistaken, the same track appears in the first half of ep. 21 (""The Door of Fate We Choose""). This would suggest to me that it's more likely to be original music, but I'm not even completely sure right now if it's the same music.  Update 2: I tried to search Musipedia, which largely is a classical music identification site, for the beginning of this section of the soundtrack and came up with no results that seemed correct. I also listened to this section of ""World of Ice"" a second time and it struck me as less ""Baroque"" and ""classical"" than I initially thought. Original music seems more likely, but I'm still having trouble obtaining the title of this music. (It's definitely nothing listed on this Tumblr.) "
4488,Is Matsutarou imitating a famous Japanese enka singer?,In the opening song matsutarou sings along with Reika. They're both dressed in traditional kimono.    Matsutarou has these weird pink things on  the side of his head though. The only thing I can think of is that he's impersonating someone and it's possibly an imitation of that singer's hair? That doesn't really explain why it is pink though.   Does anyone know what the pink strands are? 
4489,How come Goku was defeated by Frost of the 6th Universe?,"Can anyone explain the reason why Frost of the 6th Universe was able to disable or paralyze Goku? I didn't get how that was possible!  Is there any sort of cheating or is there any ability of Frost that can paralyze the opponent somehow?  By the way, I am talking about Dragon Ball Super, episode 33. "
4490,What do servants expect will happen at the end of the Holy Grail war?,"I've begun rewatching Fate, and there is something unclear to me about the Servant's behavior during the war:  Does the Holy Grail grant only one wish? Because if that is the case, what goes through a Servant's mind when they participate in the war? If they use a bit of logic:   I kill all other Servants Me and my Master win Holy Grail appears ... Who gets their wish granted? Me? My Master?   Of course, we know that in truth, masters will use a command seal to kill their own servant at the end, so they can actually summon the Holy Grail. So Masters already have a plan. But what about Servants? Do they all plan to betray their Masters at the end or what? "
4491,How much of the Natsume's Book of Friends manga was adapted into the anime?,The anime series currently has 6 seasons. How much of the manga was adapted into these 6 seasons? Are there any differences in the plot between the anime and the manga?

For Example     Whitebeard had a powerful Devil Fruit. But even without that, his physical   strength was tremendous.   Can anyone please explain what made Shanks a Yonko?  "
4493,Difference Between the Anime and Manga for Gunslinger Girl?,"I started out by watching the anime for Gunslinger Girl, and now I want to finish the story by reading the Manga.  On what chapter does the anime end? And does the anime skip or change any chapters?  I guess what I'm really asking is:   What would I need to read, in order to cover the difference between the Anime and the Manga? "
4494,Why did Cardinal block Yui from relating with players?,"I just finished watching SAO, and I'm not sure if this is ever explained:  Yui is a program that supports the psychological health of the players. She states that, for some reason, Cardinal did not permit her to relate with the players, and was limited to observing them.  Why did Cardinal block Yui? Is this explained in the novel perhaps?  If Kayaba created SAO, I'd guess that he also made Cardinal and Yui. I doubt that he'd want to block his own creation from doing its job, so I guess that the fault is entirely Cardinal's. "
4495,What is the reference Iri is making when she says DDD?,"In Episode 1, Iri and Student 0 have the following conversation:     Student 0: There's no future to it (the War) at all. Why only one team, Instructor? I think everyone should just share it (the Grail).         Iri: There are DDD circumstances behind that, so I'm sorry. I'd like to tell you in greater detail, but it won't happen. It's still too early for you to experience the adult world.    On the chalk board behind her, it shows Dark, Dirty, Dandy.    Since this entire mini-series is cluttered with references to the Fate series, I'm wondering what this DDD means in relation to the Fate series? "
4496,How is Karin's technique similar to Kushina's?,"In Naruto chapter 663, Orochimaru mentioned that       the technique used by Karin to defeat the wooden statue is similar to that of from Kushina (both Uzumaki).      What is this technique and how does this work? Can Naruto (as Uzumaki) use this technique? "
4497,Do Digimon eat other Digimon?,"In the opening episode of Digimon Adventure, Taichi was attacked by Kuwagamon. Now, I'm wondering whether if that was just the Kuwagamon feeling territorial or did it see Taichi and Koromon as food? As we know from the episode where Taichi, the other Digi-Destined, and their digimon ate dinner at the mansion, they eat meat too: which means we can assume that other digimon might exhibit the same dietary manner.  In Digimon World (PS game), it was shown that meat in the digimon world is produced from farms in a fruit-like manner. While digimon that live in a community and have a farm can surely meet their dietary needs from those farms, what about those who don't? For example, would Leomon in Digimon Adventure hunt other Digimon to eat?  I have never watched any Digimon anime other than Digimon Adventure 1 (Agumon &amp; co.) and 2 (Veemon &amp; co.) So, I'm not sure whether the digimon that come later in the series would exhibit the same dietary manner, or even have needs to eat at all. Digimon in Digimon Adventure 2 should exhibit the same dietary manner since the story takes place in the same digimon world. "
4498,Who is the trainer with Typhlosion?,"I see a lot of fan arts like this one, a trainer challenging red. He always has a Typhlosion but I have never seen the other of his pokemon in any fan art.

4499,What did Elsie type at the first try?,"On first episode of The World God Only Knows Season 2, Elsie types something like a game, but her first try is wrong.  This is a picture of what she type:    What did it says? And how can she mistype that? It looks really different with the right one, which is 'kami nomi zo shiru sekai' (神のみぞ知るセカイ), but I don't know anything about Japanese so I might be wrong and Google translate didn't help much... "
4500,Where does the term Wud come from?,"In the series Wizard Barristers: Benmashi Cecil, magic users are often referred to as Wuds.  What does this term mean? Is it an acronym or an abbreviation? Or is it supposed to be some other thing? "
4501,How does Mirai's ring help her control her ability?,"The page on Kuriyama Mirai on Kyoukai no Kanata Wiki says she uses her ring to activate her ability. From the show, I got the feeling the ring was something that kept some of her powers on check, rather than an activator. I don't recall any explanation of how the ring works during the series.  Whichever the case may be, how exactly does the ring help her control/activate her ability? Does the ring possess some kind of magic? Or is it some kind of psychological power it exerts over Mirai? "

4504,Is Eren immortal?,"I don't know why, but while I'm reading fanfiction and other things I notice that people sometimes quote how no one wants Eren to die because he's ""the key to humanity"". I've always thought he was immortal so that confused me.  Because of Eren's Titan skills, he heals fast, which seems kind of immortal.  Does Eren have a weak spot that will kill him?  Also note that Levi said in an episode that there is no way for Eren to die (at least as of that point, given that no one has found a way to do so), but there is a way to permanently injure him. So does that make him immortal? And why do people say he's not immortal like he will die or something? "
4505,The divergence points for each of the routes?,"Each of three routes has a different series of events and endings. I’ve read that the first few days are the same but then they all diverge. What causes them to diverge exactly? For example, why is Shiro with Saber in ""Fate"" route and not with Rin? Why does Archer not enact his ""kill Shiro"" plan in ""Fate"" and ""HF""? likewise, the HF events are vastly different from the first two. Why?   Botton line: What event or lack therof causes the storyline/plot to branch off into three seperate ones: Fate, UBW and HF "
4506,Are all animals called by summoning jutsu able to speak?,"I remember that all toads summoned by Jiraiya or Naruto were able to speak. I know that Tsunade's snail or Orochimaru's snake is able to speak, too. But what about the Ninken? I know that Pakkun can talk, but what about Kiba's Ninken and the others (I know around 3–4 dogs out of 9)? I know that the Pain summonings aren't able to talk.  Is there a rule that every animal can talk, or something like this? "
4507,Can this anime be identified by a small number of disconnected scenes?,"Please forgive me my somewhat lengthy preface here.  At best I have to estimate that this anime was aired at least 14 years ago.  I don't recall it being part of a series, so I'm fairly certain it was a one shot movie.  Never can be sure though.  All I can really provide for identification purposes is a small handful of scenes.  I am unsure if these are all even from a single anime.  It may well be 2 different ones that my memories have somehow merged to form a full concept.  Hopefully someone will recognize at least one of these scenes, otherwise, I'll need to find some way to wipe these things from my memory and forget they ever existed:  Scene 1  Takes place on a star ship A tall alien with a disc like head.  At some point the monsters head detaches from its body and begins to fly around independently. That is all I can recall from it.  Scene 2  Takes place on a planet near some teleporters?  A woman is fighting the alien, hears a voice (her brothers?) telling her to use or run to the teleporter.  It later turns out to be a recording.  There was some emotional connection between the woman and whoever's voice it was.  During the fight the monster gets caught in an explosion and blown into a building, one of the teleporters I think.  It walks out of rubble with something impaling its head.  It doesn't appear particularly phased, but woman seems to make special note of the injury, as though it was somehow unexpected.  Scene 3  The woman, older male and youger male (possibly a child) are driving, in a tunnel or under a bridge, or just some dense cityscape.  I just recall the environment being very crowded.  At some point they run into quadripedal monsters of some sort and wind up running a test one one, determining that it is somehow related to the main antagonist.  Scene 4  The main antagonist alien/monster appears to have placed a beacon (for some reason it strikes me that the beacon was organic in nature) on the roof of a building to start calling in more of its kind from off world.  Scene 5  Takes place in a desert setting.  The woman confronts the monster.  The woman has a staff of some sort, it was shown earlier in the movie, I believe by the younger boy.  When the tip of the staff is pressed into the ground it generates a forcefield that surrounds the staff and its user.  the tip is pressed into the monster, causing the force field to cut the creature in half horizontally.  The top half falls towards the woman and the ""face"" of the monster extends from the head to attack her.  It turns out the things neck was its only weakness.  As it is falling, someone, I believe at this point backup had arrived, takes a blade and cuts into the things neck, and then slices it down length wise, cutting the face in half too.  If any part of these scenes can be used to identify an anime, I would be beyond greatful to know my mind wasn't playing tricks on me. "
4508,Do we know anything about Obito's parents?,"After Rin was killed, he went rogue and attacked Konoha with the Nine-Tails, and he was obsessed only with his Tsuki no Me plan. Didn't he have any sibling, parent, or someone to care about?? I don't remember seeing anyone close to Obito besides his teammates. "
4509,Why did Rukawa join Shohoku?,"At the start of the manga, Rukawa was already a legend and contender for ""No. 1 High School Ace"", but he enrolled at the extremely weak Shohoku, which at the time only had Akagi as a strong player.  Why did he join such a weak team, when he could have had his pick of great schools? One might initially think that he would risk being overshadowed in a strong team, for example by Sendoh if he were to join Ryonan. However, we know later in the story that he had very lofty ambitions - of even entering the NBA - and with such a goal, it wouldn't matter if he were the ace of a single team or not, since he had to outperform all the other aces.  Did Rukawa give any indication why he picked Shohoku in particular? Was it simply because, as a teenager, he made bad choices? Was there something special about Shohoku that I missed? Did the ambition come later, as the character evolved? Or did it make some sense from Rukawa's perspective? "
4510,Are Senri and Kaname cousins?,"In the Vampire Knight anime it is revealed that Senri Shiki's father is Rido Kuran and Rido Kuran is Kaname Kuran's uncle. However, Kaname and Senri never refer each other as cousins or family.  Are Kaname and Senri cousins?  and  Why isn't Senri called Senri Kuran?     "
4511,Why does One Piece antagonist disappear after being defeated?,"Let me take an instance of one villain: Arlong. Arlong got defeated by Luffy, he wasn't killed. Luffy didn't stay in Kokoyashi village either. So Arlong could have returned to his usual business of enslaving the village. He would have faced ugly humiliating words from Villagers initially, but why would it matter? All you gotta do is gang-up on them. No one in the village was strong enough to stop them.   There are many other pirates who just disappeared after being defeated. It's not like they lived their life with principle or something, they were bad guys who used to loot, cheat, and kill people. Why wouldn't they continue that after being defeated? "

4514,Why does season 2 of Gurren Lagann start so differently compared to season 1?,"Episode 1 of  the second part of season 1 of Gurren Lagann features more political themes than those seen in season one. However from episode two onwards it returns to being more about action.  Is this to do with how they were aired? Was this change enforced, so as to move away from the Mecha stereotype, by a 'higher up' in Gainax...and simply ignored from episode 18 onwards? In western TV, ratings that are seen by executives can influence the show...has something similar happened here?  Why is this? "
4515,What did Lelouch do to C.C?,"In episode 12, 4:58 there is a part were Lelouch and C.C are fighting, then the scene changes, C.C seems to be lying unconscious, while Lelouch is mad and taking a shower.  What happened there? Did he kill her? Beat her? Rape her?  [website]"
4516,When can chakra be seen?,"The answer to this question says that chakra can only be seen in certain cases, when the person is using powerful abilities. This lines up with reactions to people seeing Chidori and being surprised that it can be see. However, there are times when chakra can be seen when it is being built up instead of being used in a jutsu.  How does this happen, if chakra only shows up when someone is using a strong ability (such as Chidori)? Or is what Naruto using in the image somehow a different type of chakra?   "
4517,How strong is Magellan?,"He was trusted to guard the World Government's maximum-security prison from the most dangerous criminals and pirates from all over the world, he must be extremely strong.

4518,How did everyone end up on Kamine island?,"When Lelouch ordered Suzaku to live, Schneitzels Avalon started blasting everything.   But how did everyone get to Kamine island? How did the other Black Knights get out of that mess and not go to Kamine island? How come Black Knights couldn't know where the other team has ended up, they were just next to each other? How did Princess Euphemia end up there?    And there is a scene were C.C is possibly talking to Marianne and there is a mention that she sent them there?

4522,Was Erza's nickname 'Titania' inspired by Shakespeare?,"I read on Fanpop that the name Titania comes from a Shakespearean play called A Midsummer Night's Dream.  In this play, it happens to be that Titania is queen of fairies. Did the creators of Fairy Tail happen to get inspiration from Shakespeare's plays and was that how Erza got the nickname 'Titania'? Also did they use this play as an inspiration for the name of the anime Fairy Tail?  Note: I came across this when I was trying to find out why Erza had the nickname Titania? I did a Google search but didn't find out any solid answers besides...     She's the strongest mage in the guild, and that's how she earned the nickname Titania.   To sum it up, I am not asking how she got the nickname in the show, but how the producers came up with the nickname. What was their inspiration for the nickname Titania.  Please refrain from saying:   She got her nickname from being the strongest in the guild The producers came up with that nickname because she is strong  "

4525,Is Mario Bosh/Bossi Triela's real father?,"Is Mario Bosh (or Bossi) Triela's real father?  In chapter 3, Triela captures, and later frees, a former mafia leader, Mario Bosh.    He claims to have come to the town to meet his daughter (Triela?), whom he hasn't seen in several years.  He later sends Triela a bear as a Christmas present. (He claims to have sent his daughter a Christmas present every year, and Triela has received a bear for Christmas every year, supposedly from her handler.)  It seems odd that Triela also received exactly what she asked for for Christmas from Mario even though she never had the chance to tell him what she wanted.    Side note: this would actually make it the first year Triela has received a gift from her handler, not the first gift from Mario.  Also, Triela's handler hides around a corner, and doesn't show himself, allowing Triela to release Mario.  Is this an actual thing, or am I overthinking it? "
4526,"Why was the Buddy Complex ""second season"" just a two part finale?","It seems like there were expectations for a full second season of Buddy Complex, e.g. from here in March 2014:     ... the official Twitter account and website for the anime confirmed that the series will still continue.   But then, only three months later, a two-episode finale was announced instead, seemingly to the surprise (a reaction of confusion common in other forums as well, which I share) of many. The finale was released in September 2014. The finale announcement article also concludes with the same note that ""the story will still continue"" but this seems to be more copy-pasted from the first announcement than an actual announcement (it links back to the same old Twitter post).  Why did Buddy Complex not get a full second season? Was a second season scheduled and then reduced to two episodes because of poor sales or anything like that? Is another season still planned? I don't know Japanese and so searching for sources was difficult. I'm looking primarily for official news and announcements, interviews, etc. "

Surely this can't be the ""real"" Rei, given that later, I think we see Rei in bandages when Gendo Ikari goads Shinji into piloting the EVA? I'm assuming that this could be some sort of foreshadowing (?), but even so it doesn't make sense for Rei to literally appear before Shinji, unless this is some sort of illusion. "

4530,Can a person shorten their own life by using the Death Note?,"I was reading about the rules of the Death Note on Death Note wiki and I came across this certain rule...     A person can shorten his/her own life by using the note.    What does this rule mean? Does it mean that when Light uses the Death Note, he loses some of his life? I find it unlikely since he would have died quite a while ago. "
4531,Why does Kimura Kaere always threaten to sue people?,"At the beginning of her first appearance, Itoshiki Sensei explains about how foreigners always threaten to sue other people over the tiniest thing. And in a later episode Kimura Kaere often says she'll sue surrounding people after accidentally(?) flashing her panties, or anything that can be considered sexual harassment. Is this something like a parody about how Japanese see a foreigner? Or is this just simply her character?   "
4532,How can Nami's punches hurt Luffy so much?,"In One Piece anime, there are many instances where Nami has beaten Luffy to a horrible state,  Episode 215    Episode 316    Episode 572    and maybe many more. How is she able to do it? Does she know how to use Haki? "

4535,Why are butterflies not affected by the Black Iron Sickness?,"In Zetsuen No Tempest, there was this sickness that turned everything into black iron, which is where its name came from. However, from what I can remember, I am sure there was no explanation in the anime to this question.  Why are butterflies not affected by the Black Iron Sickness?  Was this ever revealed in the manga? I am positive that it is not mentioned in the anime series, or on Zetsuen No Tempest Wiki, but was there ever an explanation for this? And if this was in the anime, would you please include a reference to the episode?  Answers are appreciated. :) "
4536,Is she adult Rika in the final of Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kai?,"In the final scene of Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kai, we see how the past of Takano changed when she was a child and eventually her parents don't die, then an adult version of Rika appeared.

4538,What is the limit for the Rinne Tensei?,"I know, that the Samsara of Heavenly Life is able to resurrect either all the individuals recently killed, or a single person from long ago. I know also, that this jutsu it's different from the Edo Tensei, since ""It seems that this technique does not need the original body for the owner to be brought back, as Madara's original plan consisted of Obito reviving him at a time where the original body would have decomposed.""  So the question is: does this technique have a weakness, or a time limit, after which you can't use it, or it's flawless?..If that's the case, could a Rinnegan user revive e.g. The Sage Of The Six Path?      "
4539,What events usually happen at Comiket?,"I only know Comiket from anime and manga: they usually sell their own doujinshi and do some cosplay. Is this the only thing that actually happens at Comiket or are there a lot more things that happen? Maybe some kind of contest or something? Also, does Comiket only exist in Japan? Is it different from Comic-Con? "
4540,Why didn't Shirohige rescue Ace when he was still in Impel Down,The news of Ace capture is quite long time before the execution. And surely it will be much easier to save Ace when he was still in Impel Down (or maybe Enies Lobby). Is it because Shirohige is to far away? Can't he ask one of his subordinate or his alliance to save Ace? Where exactly was he at that moment? 
4541,What is the purpose of one-shot manga?,"One-shot manga usually only consist of one chapter, so what is their purpose? Is it mainly for promotion, filler or contest? And do they have their own media (like a magazine that only consists of one-shot or something)? "
4542,Is this Ghost in the Shell Volume complete?,"I'm looking to buy the Ghost in the Shell Manga on ebay, and I'm confused.  On one hand, I see an offer for about 5€ for the book with the  EAN: 9783897485037. No page count or further info is given.    On the other hand, I see an offer for about 23€ for the book with EAN 9781935429012 and ISBN 1935429019, the last one also mentiones a page count of 368 pages.  Now, GitS was apparantly first published in a serialized form, and the first bunch of the series was then published as one book. This is what I want to buy. I'm worried that the first, cheaper book might only contain part of the series. I know that there's GitS 1.5 and GitS2:MMI, I'm asking about the first Volume. I lack the knowledge of the vast Manga-databases* where I can simply look up with my EAN/ISBN number what I'm looking at, can someone help?

4543,Hyuuga and Uchiha clan family roots?,"The Uchiha clan is descended from the Hyuuga, right? So then why is the Hyuuga clan not seen during the founding of the Konoha Village? How did the Uchiha awaken Sharingan, when originally they had Byakugan? How did they come into changing their name? Would an Uchiha be able to awaken Byakugan? On that note, what would happen if a person were to obtain byakugan, eternal mangekyou sharingan, and rinnegan?  EDIT (4/2/14): So now Kaguya is shown to have Byakugan. It is evidence that Uchiha, Senju, and Hyuuga are indeed related. But how does the Hyuuga then come about? "

I tried googling/wiki'ing and I found this Wikipedia article - But I don't think it's the same person...? There doesn't seem to be any mention of Kill la Kill on his website.  I would love to find out exactly who it is, just to be sure. I thought the vocals were amazing and would like to see if this person had any previous work? "

4550,Who is Oshino Ougi?,"This question contains spoilers for the second season of the Monogatari series.  Oshino Ougi refers to herself as the niece of Oshino Meme. But Kaiki mentions in Koimonogatari/Hitagi End that Meme has no family at all and it's not possible that he has a niece.  Also, this news-article at ANN suggests that she (or he?) fights with Koyomi in the latest novels and it seems to me that she is responsible for Nadeko becoming a god. Is she actually an antagonist?

In Kagerou Project, where Marry's weight is:     130 apples.   Japanese Vocaloid Kaai Yuki has her height measured in apples.     Height:   ""As tall as 10 big apples""   Why do some characters have their weight measured in apples? Did the trend of measuring weight in apples start with Hello Kitty? Or is the trend not as common as I think it is? "
4553,What are Shiina's and Tsuyuko's last names?,"Looking through the Wikipedia article of Koufuku Graffiti, I noticed that Shiina's and Tsuyuko's last names are missing. It is also missing on the corresponding Japanese Wikipedia article. Since Japanese Wikipedia is usually very detailed about terminology and character names, the last name being missing suggest that it is not yet revealed at the moment.  What are Shiina's and Tsuyuko's last names? Has it been revealed in the manga? Is there any official reason why their last names are kept secret? "
4554,"What are familiars, their significance and abilities?","Nana Genie is Cecil's familiar.    There are other familiars that can be seen on the series, though we don't find out all of their names. Though Wizard Barrister's wiki does not elaborate on what familiars are exactly, and what their abilities are, Wikipedia's page on Wizard Barristers links familiars directly to this page, which explains familiars as:       In European folklore and folk-belief of the Medieval and Early Modern periods, familiar spirits (sometimes referred to simply as ""familiars"" or ""animal guides"") were supernatural entities believed to assist witches and cunning folk in their practice of magic.   However, the page does not seem to refer familiars in an Eastern context. So I was wondering if they are to be taken as they are in Western culture, or if they are an interpretation of this.  Further down the page, there is another definition:       A familiar spirit (alter ego, doppelgänger, personal demon, personal totem, spirit companion) is the double, the alter-ego, of an individual. It does not look like the individual concerned. Even though it may have an independent life of its own, it remains closely linked to the individual. The familiar spirit can be an animal (animal companion).   By this definition, does this mean that Cecil has a perverted side to her, that is expressed through Nana Genie?  They must be able to perform magic, as Magic Prohibition Law article 8 states that:       Article 8: If a familiar breaks the law, the owner is held responsible.     However, going back to Wikipedia's page, it does not explain what are their abilities (if they have any).    So basically, and as the title says: What exactly are familiars? (Are they to be considered exactly as Western Medieval Folklore interprets them?) What is their significance (in relation to their 'owners')? And what abilities to they possess? "
4555,Why did Goku have a halo when he was fighting Janemba?,"While fighting Janemba in the DBZ movie, Goku had a halo.  Also while he transformed into SSJ3, he told Janemba that he is the second one to push him as far, for him to turn SSJ3 (the first time being against Majin Buu).  But wasn't Goku alive after he killed Buu?   Is there something I'm missing?  "
4556,Did Shiraki Rig the Idol Festival Results?,"When the winner of the Idol festival is revealed, Shiraki comes up to Hayasaka and says ""they won"". The disgusted face on Hayasaka is priceless:    This is right after the announcement that the winners are Akamiso All Stars; While their performance is not shown, we can clearly see that the crowd is rather normal.    But on WUG's peformance, the whole stadium comes down:    We have a scene right before the result is announced, where Shiraki does a kind of power walk from the judge's booth (and the judges sound REALLY nervous), only to be berated by Hayasaka:    What really happened is not stated, but we have two scenarios:  1) WUG won, but Shiraki rigged the results.  2) The judges really chose Akamiso All Stars, perhaps because of Yoshino missed jump.  I really think that scenario (1) is the most likely, because:  a) it tells a better story b) explains screenshot 1 (scenario 2 leaves that comment floating on a void). c) is really on par with Shiraki's ruthless and unscrupulous persona. d) is a way for Shiraki to strike at the same time both Mayu and Hayasaka (for her daring to step on stage again, and for his ""betrayal"" on mentoring WUG)    For scenario (2):  a) judges be judges, and a missed jump can cost a medal.  So, without any further ADO, and before the flag hunters cry WOLF:  Is there any official / canonical reference that Shiraki rigged the Idol Festival results? "
4557,Why does Seki-kun need a voice actor?,"I've watched most of Tonari no Seki-kun, and all I can hear from his voice actor are grunts and groans, and a few other occasional sounds of panic or excitement.  Why does this require a voice actor at all?  I mention this because, in Non Non Biyori, the only male character didn't have any sounds associated with him.  Am I perhaps conflating the two character types together (one with an obvious role, and another with an obvious non-role)? "
4558,Why did Luffy ring the bell 16 times?,I'm confused as to why Luffy rung the bell 16 times. A navy member said it's a declaration of war whereas a pirate said it's about the change of an era. Can someone please explain what exactly is the reason behind it?? 
4559,What kind of fish is Jinbe?,"After having a first look at Jinbei at Impel Down I was wondering, what kind of a fish is he?    (Since fish-men are half human - half fish). Arlong was a blue saw-shark, but Jinbe doesn't appear to resemble a shark so I was wondering, what kind of a fish he could be? Also, are the two white things sticking out of his mouth teeth or elephant-like tusks? "
4560,"Why does Killua get upset when Gon says ""being weak is so painful"" in manga chapter 214?","In chapter 214, just after Knuckle and Shoot left Gon and Killua to go to NGL, there is a scene where Gon cried, saying that he didn't realise that being weak was so painful.     At the bottom of this page, Killua also cried, although I don't think the reason is explained clearly.     The next page explains that Killua intended to leave Gon after he spent 30 days protecting him.   Was the reason he cried because he knew that he would be leaving Gon, or because he empathised with Gon, or because he too felt that being weak was painful? If so, why would it effect him so deeply?  (Could it be a mixture of the two - he felt that he was too weak and that was the reason he would have to leave Gon?) "
4561,Who is being addressed at the start of the first episode?,"In the first episode of Serial Experiments Lain, right at the beginning, someone says:     Why? Why won't you come? I wish you would come here.   This person I assumed to be Chisa Yomoda, but I am not completely sure. Who is being addressed, and is the speaker Chisa or someone else? (Or is this perhaps simply something inserted for ""atmosphere"" that doesn't have an explicit answer?) Within the context of the story, it seems to make sense for the addressee to be Lain, but I'm really not sure. "
4562,Why did Nadeko use different names for Araragi?,"Episode 12, the story about Otorimonogatari, contains the story Nadeko Medusa. Nadeko said this:     Favorite big brother: Koyomi Oniichan      In Love with: Araragi Koyomi   why she said it differently? Does it mean that she consider Araragi as two different person? Because in Monogatari Series Second Season she turn out to be a      yandere, and want to kill Araragi, the man that she love.  "
4563,How accurate is the World Map in The Irregular at Magic High School?,In the monologue (at the beginning of episode 1) you may have remembered a world map being displayed.

4564,Is there a ranked order for the Phantom 4?,"Previously the Element 4 was a group of four S-Class Mages who were the most strongest in the Phantom Lord Guild. However was there ever a ranking/official ranking in terms of who was stronger?  The only information I can gather is the Aria was the strongest out of the Element 4. Was there any information that gave insight into the ranking on strength? It may have been already revealed in the anime, however I have forgotten if it was mentioned.  Answers are appreciated. :) "
4565,"How the Akatsuki members turned all ""missing-nin's""?","I know why Itachi went rogue, and why he left the village and joined the organization, and I know from other questions and answers why and how the members arrived to the Akatsuki, but I'd like to know why did the Hidden Villages and the Five Great Nation let these kinds of shinobi's to be excluded from their homes, nations, and eventually life?  Just think about it, since almost every member of the Akatsuki once belonged somewhere, and you should be a fool to mistreat and let go of fighters like: Kisame, Kakuzu, Hidan, etc. All of them are powerful warriors, immortals, owning a chakra level like a tailed beast, prodigies of the century, possessors of Kinjutsu's, etc. How come that a Kage isn't able to understand the importance of these kinds of men, especially when ""a nation is reflected by the military power it has"" and let them go wild, resulting in their exile from their own native villages?  "
4566,Who is the character in this picture with Yotsuba and Totoro?,"I am familiar with Yotsuba and Totoro, but who is the third character in this picture (the one in pink) ?

But then, he also mentioned that the previous reincarnations were Hashirama and Madara.  Because Indra's soul is inside Sasuke, and now that Madara is alive, whose soul does he have? Is there something that I've missed? "
4570,How much has changed since the start of One Piece?,"I recently started watching One Piece, and noticed as I reached episode 590 that the animation quality seems to have changed quite a bit since episode 1.   Now I was wondering, are there any other big changes they made since episode one besides quality changes? And how did they do those quality changes? I did not notice any changes until quite a bit in. Is there some particular technique they used?   So, summed up, this is my question.    What are the big changes in quality/animation they have made since the start? Are there any other big changes they made besides quality? How did they do the quality changes?  "

4572,How did Rance avoid impregnating anyone?,"After the fight with Miki when she transformed into the the Demon Lord, Sill protected Rance by putting herself in front of him, taking the brunt of Miki's attack. She was permanently frozen after that.   It was mentioned that the reason Rance does not risk pregnancy during his sexual escapades is because Sill used a magic spell on him to kill all of his sperm, if I remember correctly. After she was frozen, she wouldn't be able to do this anymore. So how did Rance avoid impregnating anyone after Sill is frozen? Can he use the spell himself? "
4573,How many nations are there in the Naruto universe?,"How many total countries are present in the Naruto universe, including small or less significant ones? Are there only the five nations which participated in the war? "
4574,Why didn't Pikachu evolve?,"I'm talking about Ash's Pikachu: obviously he already reached level 314159265kachu (Pun intended; that's not the exact number as I don't know what level he is).   I forget the reason for this - did he not want to evolve? If so, then why did he refuse to evolve? And does that mean that evolving is a choice? You can choose NOT to evolve your pokemon? "
4575,Juubi and Rikudou's brother?,"From the current chapters of Naruto, it is revealed, that Rikudou Sennin has a brother who also sealed the juubi in himself. That means there are two juubis in the world. If Madara has/had control of one of them, where could the other be hidden? His presence in the world for now is speculation. But as the Rabbit Goddess had Byakugan, this could mean that this brother may have been the Hyuuga's ancestor, which would mean Senju, Uchiha, and Hyuuga are indeed related, but Hyuuga and Uchiha could never be able to use the other's doujutsu, because of difference in ancestor.  So in essence, I'm asking, where could the second Juubi presumably be, is it not possible that the brother is the Hyuuga ancestor? For now this is all speculation, but I have a feeling that Kishimoto will end this series with a few plot holes, so I want to see other users' ideas on these questions. "

4577,How did humans get telekinetic powers?,"I finished watching the anime production of Shinsekai Yori (From the New World), but was a little unsure of how the telekinetic powers of humans were obtained in the first place. Were they obtained due to natural mutations? Or was it the fault of science and modern technology? Or was it war and nuclear radioactivity due to war?  How was it that they obtained this ""kamisama"" power? "
4578,Why are so many names based on folklore and such,"Lately, I can't help but notice that a lot of the names of characters and techniques used in Naruto seem to be derived from folklore and/or based on gods and the likes. Some samples would be:   Izanagi - a deity born of the seven divine generations in Japanese mythology and Shinto Jiraiya - originally known as Ogata Shuma Hiroyuki, is the title character of the Japanese folk tale Jiraiya Gōketsu Monogatari   So, why are so many of the names used in Naruto derived from such things?

Did they reset the after life world?   What exactly happen here? "
4580,Is it common for games to get a anime?,"A lot of anime are based off of the plot of a manga and/or light novels. Sometimes an anime is an original work that gets a manga story afterwards, but that isn't always the case.  I remember watching Amagami, where you could obviously notice that it was based on a game, and some are even named after the games such as Final Fantasy.  So how common is it for a anime to be based of a game? I have only seen it once or twice but is it really that uncommon? Or are they just animated in a way that you won't directly notice that it comes from a game unless you already know so? "
4581,How does the Angel Beats special episode connect with the main storyline?,"In the special episode (Stairway to Heaven), the Battlefront has decided to commence a new mission: Operation High Tension Syndrome.

4582,How can I quickly understand the basics of Naruto and the story without watching all 300+ episodes?,I would like to start watching Naruto as I have never attempted or tried to get into watching Naruto. The main problem I have is that I don't want to watch all 300+ episodes in Naruto or read the dozens of Mangas to understand what Naruto is about and the many plots that are involved.  I know this might be a really silly question for someone who watches anime and this may sound very far fetched but I havent watched Naruto before. I do not want to read through pages and pages of information from Naruto's Wikia and do not want to go watching through episode through episode of about 300+ to understand Naruto.  Are there any episodes in Naruto that will help me understand the story and key terms/terminology without doing this? In other words I am looking for a short cut.  Think of this scenario: Death Note created two special episodes for those who have not watched it before so they wouldn't have to go through all the episodes to understand the plot. Did Naruto do this? If so that would be extremely helpful.  Please note: I have not watched ever Naruto or Naruto Shippuden and as such have no actual knowledge of anything Naruto. 
4583,What happened at the end of the Magical Warfare's anime? Is Kazuma a Gekkou?,"In episode 12 of Magical Warfare, there was a lot left as a cliffhanger.  Since the show is not getting a season 2, I was wondering if anyone could explain what happened? Is Kazuma a Gekkou? "

Perhaps in a character profile or something similar? "
4585,Is there any relation between hair style and character's personalities?,"Generally speaking, hairstyle in anime represent the character personality, like short hair girl should become tomboyish or ponytail make a girl seems sporty, etc. But what about the others? Like long straight hair, or idiot hair, twintail, etc.  What is common hair style for girls and guys in anime and what are the character represent?  ADD There's a really fine blog about anime hair colors here thanks to @user1306322 comment below, I want an answer like that, but it's about hair style "
4586,Under what Touge rules did Project D race against Purple Shadow?,"From my understanding, throughout the whole anime series, the touge rules has been one of the following:  Cat and Mouse/Sudden Death (using Wikipedia Tōge terminology...)        Cars start bumper to bumper, if cat finishes a round ahead of the rat with a considerable time difference, cat wins. If rat overtakes the cat, rat wins. If neither happen, proceed to a new round and swap positions. Example: When Keisuke beat Wataru on Shomaru pass   Grip Gambler   Cars start side by side (or rolling start up to first turn), whoever is leader at the end wins. Example: When Takumi raced Keisuke at Akina pass   When Project D raced Purple Shadow, both Takumi and Keisuke's races started bumper to bumper indicating that it wasn't grip gambler. However, in both cases, they were overtaken at one point and the race didn't end, meaning it wasn't cat and mouse sudden death. Perhaps there's a non-sudden death version of cat and mouse, which would make a lot more sense as both races went into multiple rounds.   However, there is still something not quite right. In Takumi's case, he overtook his opponent back and prolonged the race. In Keisuke's case, he overtook his opponent back and the race ended (with no noticeable winning distance).   What was different between Keisuke and Takumi's race so that Keisuke won? Keisuke regained his lead but that should have taken it into the next round. Even Keisuke himself said ""That felt kind of questionable. Want to go for a third run?""  So overall, I am beyond confused. Exactly what Touge race rules did they race in? "
4587,What is Serial Experiments Lain about?,"I have yet to find a clear answer to this question. From what I've read, it may be an art-house series about dangers of remote communication, phobia of technological advancement and feeling of insecurity. The last point I can agree with because of how easily information can be accessed with the use if internet these days, but the rest… I think there's a more concrete meaning to this series.  SEL is a series with very unusual direction and a peculiar artistic style. These traits are commonly seen in art-house works that may not bear any specific message.  Throughout the series we learn about the difficult reality surrounding Lain: her relatives are troubled, some of her friends have psychological problems, there are suicides happening in mystical circumstances, and then there are some secret agents following around.  Later in the series, things become rather surreal and Lain turns into some kind of god of the Net. I've never understood this portion of the anime and what it could possibly suggest. Does it warn us about dangers of becoming too self-important? Does it mean it's possible to lose the sense of reality when using internet? Or maybe Lain's character is a metaphor for a person new to technological advancements of today?  What is the message the authors of SEL are trying to communicate? "
4588,Does the world on the other side of the gate exist for alchemy to exist?,"In one of the episodes of Fullmetal Alchemist (the original 2003 anime), Hohenheim of Light is sent to a parallel universe of some sort smaller than the world he once knew by Dante, using a baby as she did some research on The Gate. He says something along the lines off:     Even when we fix a radio with alchemy . . . it takes a life or energy from this world to do it   I know it's not exactly what he told his son Ed (although I do not remember why), but why does this other world exist? Does it just exist to serve the purpose of alchemy? "
4589,Are anime episodes/manga chapters really free?,"I believe almost all of the people watching anime or reading manga get them from various sites like watchop.com, Crunchyroll, anime44, etc., and similarly for manga there are various sites. But are these episodes/chapters really free of cost for the audience? I know that these companies have their major source of income from merchandise and all other stuff but the episodes/chapters are available on net so easily that too for free. Aren't there any copyright violations? If there are why don't these anime/manga companies do something about it?  "
4590,Who is the woman in the opening cutscene of Tales of the Abyss 3DS version?,"In the opening of Tales of the Abyss (from the 3DS, not sure about the PS2), at around 1:40, there's a shot of the Daarth Cathedral where there's a woman letting out something like a gust from behind her (moment before you see Ion or Florian at the alter behind). There seems to be more of this woman, as when I start a new game, the first cutscene shows a group of them gathering above the planet.  I'm currently on the final battle. At first, I thought the woman was Lorelei, but the characters call Lorelei a he. I checked the walkthrough to see if I was on the very last battle, since in Tales of Graces F there was a second story after I defeated Lambda which focused on fighting Little Queen, I confirmed that the fights I'm on are the last. (Then again, the walkthrough is for the PS2 version. A second story could have been added for the 3DS version, but I doubt it.)  Since I'm at the endgame, I am still wondering who this woman is? "
4591,Are the similarities between Homura Akemi and Kiritsugu Emiya intentional?,"Puella Magi Madoka Magica's Homura Akemi and Fate/Zero's Kiritsugu Emiya were both written by Gen Urobuchi, although Kiritsugu was created by Type Moon's Kinoko Nasu. There are numerous similarities between them:   Both are magic users with control over time. Both augment their magical powers with modern weaponry. Both are very taciturn, but deeply loving towards certain people (Homura towards Madoka and Kiritsugu towards Iri and Illya). Both are mentally damaged by the horrors of war (Homura's experiences in the time loops and Kiritsugu's experiences in various war zones over the years). Both characters are pivotal to the events of the story, but for most of the series the viewers, and even the main heroine herself, have no idea what they are thinking. Both have something of a gap in ideals with the main heroine (Homura's actions during the movie go against Madoka's wishes, while Kiritsugu and Saber clash so much from the very beginning that Kiritsugu assigns her to work with Iri). Both have great hair :)      Was this just an archetype of Urobuchi's writing, the way Stephen King spent three decades writing about common household objects trying to kill people? Or is there an interview or any evidence which suggests this was intentional? As a related question, how much of Kiritsugu's overlap with Homura was Nasu's doing, and how much was Urobuchi's? "
4592,"About Hanekawa, Golden weeks and possession occurences","I'm rewatching the first season of Bakemonogatari and it still confuses me how Hanekawa (in episode 10) was already known to be possessed by Black Hanekawa. I'm not sure about the timeline of this either, because burial of a roadkill white cat happens during the first season's episode and it doesn't look like it was a flashback moment. It also looks like in that same episode (1 year after the flashback?), the possession symptoms reappear in form of headaches, so I'm confused about when this all happens.  Black Hanekawa says in a flashback ""If this stress is not dealt with within a year..."" and then she gets suppressed by Shinobu. Does that mean a year has passed?  When does the possession begin and when does that flashback scene happen?  How many repeated possession occurrences are in the anime now? "
4593,Why do the giant armors bleed when cut?,"Although I am not sure if this also happened in earlier episodes, as I did not really pay attention to it, I couldn't help but notice that in episode 14 during the battle, Nobunaga's armor started bleeding after getting cut.  Why and how did the armors bleed? Did this happen in earlier episodes as well? "
4594,What happened to Aeka during the Nekoko and Mizuki stories?,"In the Aeka story, we see that Aeka is stuck in an incredibly bleak situation where she's being bullied at school by Kyouka Nanjou. She gets out of this situation by the end of her story with the protagonist's help, but it's rough going.    After the Aeka story, I became obsessed and raced through the Mizuki and Nekoko stories in three days, so maybe I missed the finer points. Was it ever mentioned what happened to Aeka in these stories? Was she still able to escape from her situation without Kouhei's help? "
4595,"Who is this girl stuffing food in her face, and what show is it from?","What show is this from?     what exactly is happening?   I found in this amv but the source for it (this is from boom boom dollar within that amv, at 22:04) only says ""various"". "
4596,What does the symbol on Akatsuki's costume represent?,"I'm referring to the red-colored, white-bordered cloud-shaped pattern which is present on the costume of all of the Akatsuki members. What is it called and what does it represent? Do they have a special meaning regarding the mission of Akatsuki or is it just plain-art with no real significance to it?   "
4597,Why did Itachi seek Tobi's help?,"In ""Episode 359 : The Night of the Tragedy"", it was revealed that Itachi sought the help of Tobi to massacre the Uchiha clan. So the following questions arise out of this situation:   Did he know Tobi's real identity? Why did he take his help to eliminate the clan (irrespective of whether his identity was known or not)?  Why did he help Tobi by not revealing that he was the village infiltrator as Itachi was always working for the Village? Why did Tobi agree to help Itachi eliminate his own clan?   Ideally, each question here should be a separate question, but in this scenario all these are closely inter-related and thus have been posted as a single question. "
4598,About Face and the demons of Tartaros,"So one of the goals of Tartaros was      that they would activate Face, which would then wipe out magic all together from the world. Or at least from the continent, which would be quite helpful for them as they don't use magic, but rather curses.   However, it is clearly stated that the strongest members of Tartaros      are all demons created by the dark mage Zeref himself. Even if they don't use magic, they are just Zeref's living magic.   Doesn't that make them vulnerable to Face? Wouldn't it kill them? "
4599,Is Tobias' Latios the same Latios as the one in the Pokémon Heroes movie?,"How can Tobias in Sinnoh League Champions ep.658 own Latios? Latios, as a legendary Pokemon, appears only once in the whole Pokémon world and, for we all know, he is dead since the Pokemon Heroes movie? "
4600,What song is used in this video?,I've tried using a song finder app to no avail. What is the song used on this site. Is it a song used in Cowboy Bebop? Or just some random song overlaid with Spike's picture? 
4601,How is the Boatdrift Ceremony (Ofunehiki) supposed to be held?,"I'd like to know how the original scenario for the Boatdrift Ceremony goes. In the anime things go out of control every time the ceremony is held, so I wonder how it is originally supposed to undergo.  Also, it looks like there have been very many ceremonies held in the past, as there are lots of wooden maidens found at the bottom of the vortex inside some sort of cracked dome with a hand in the middle. Characters talked about how the ceremonies have been held for many years, but how many years exactly (or at least approximately)?  And are there any other places in the world like Shioshishio where people gifted with Ena live? Do they also hold Boatdrift ceremonies? "
4602,What happened during the Void Century and the name of the KINGDOM?,I'm just wondering about the Void Century in One Piece. What happened during those years? The World Government came to be by taking down the mysterious KINGDOM. I really want to know the name of that kingdom. Can anybody guess or give me something that would put me at ease? 
4603,Has Hayao Miyazaki ever made an anime series or manga?,"Hayao Miyazaki is famous director for anime movies like ""Spirited Away"" and ""My Neighbor Totoro""  But has he ever made any anime series or manga besides movies? If so, What are they? "
4604,What are these A2 and A3 stickers?,"I just read the manga travel by Yuichi Yokoyama.  What is the meaning of the A2 and A3 stickers seen on packages and documents carried by strangers when the 3 main characters walk inside the train? A3 is on small tubes, and A2 is on a folder and an A4-sized box, so I guess it is not ISO 216 (paper size) though.  This manga contains zero dialogs and nearly zero text of any kind, except for A3 and A2, which are shown prominently.   |   Left: A3 stickers on page 30 | Right: A2 sticker on page 31 "
4605,"Why are there different words for ""manga"" and ""manhwa""?","So lately I have been noticing that a lot of people on fora tend to mistake manga and manhwa. And of course, I know that manga stands for comics made in Japan, and manhwa for comics made in Korea.   But what is the reason for the different naming? Or is there even a reason besides them coming from different lands to begin with?   In the end they are both comics with usually (a bit dependent on the artist/writer of course) same art/story building and the like. "
4606,"How much different are the live action and manga versions of ""Yamada-kun to 7-nin no Majo""?","I ususally read Yamada-kun to 7-nin no Majo manga from time to time. Recently, I heard a Live Action version was aired and completed. But its manga is still ongoing. So how much of the manga is covered by the live action version? And how closely does the live action version follow the manga version? "
4607,What is this bird?,"In Hana-Saku Iroha there's always a big bird that appear    At first I thought it's like a god or something, but as far as I know it didn't do anything. What is this bird? and what is its role? "
4608,Which chapter of the manga closely follows after Attack on Titan EP 25?,"I have been searching for this for a while now after I finished watching the series a week ago, but I can't find a rough answer on Google and sites such as answers.yahoo.com about which chapter of the manga picks up roughly around the end of episode 25 of Attack on Titan.  Which manga chapter will be a continuation from where episode 25 left off, and how accurate will it be? Does anyone know? "
4609,Are there any Evangelion games out there in US or EU?,"I really like Evangelion's anime and movies, and love the universe, but don't speak Japanese. I've tried to find video games on the universe, but the closest I found which made reference to Evangelion was Phantasy Star Portable on PSP, which have a plug suit and Longinus spear as bonus equipment...  Are there any games placed in the Evangelion universe that have been at least officially translated into English?  To add a little to the question, video game websites list these games (for current platforms):   PS3   Gekiatsu Pachige Damashii Max Evangelion (JAP only)  DS   CR Neon Genesis Evangelion : Angels Return (JAP) Puchi Eva : Evangelion Game (JAP)  PSP   Evangelion : Jo (JAP) Neon Genesis Evangelion : Battle Orchestra Portable (JAP) Neon Genesis Evangelion : Girlfriend of Steel Special Version (JAP) Neon Genesis Evangelion : Shinjitsu no Tsubasa (JAP/cancelled?) Neon Genesis Evangelion : Tamashii no Kiseki (JAP) Rebuild of Evangelion Sound Impact (PlayStation Store) (JAP/cancelled?)   "
4610,What is the paper at Saki's desk in From the New World about?,"I've been wondering this for ages:  At the end of From the New World, Saki has this piece of paper on her desk. Below you can see it (and somebody translated them to Spanish).  Apparently these are names, and some of them are followed by a number. Unfortunately I don't recognise any of those names so I'm not sure what is this paper about.  At first I guessed it was some sort of deceased people list (numbers representing their age?). However the fourth name reads ""New Yuubari"", so it sounds like a place rather than somebody... but it lacks a number, so it could actually be a headline, as in ""the following people died at New Yuubari"" - same thing for ""Shinamoto"", which makes sense - but then the first three names lack a headline.  So I'm not sure - what is this paper?   "
4611,"In Naruto Shippuden, why did Sasuke became evil?","I understand that Sasuke learns Itachi was motivated by his desire to protect the village. Itachi only slaughtered his clan because they were plotting a rebellion. And thus Sasuke's motivation for killing Itachi was slightly misguided. Since Tobi told him about Itachi, why does he want to destroy Konoha? Itachi died protecting it so why does Sasuke wants to destroy it? "
4612,Does Killua have a crush on Gon?,Watching the latest 3 episodes of Hunter X Hunter 2011 ( 114 - 116) I started to wonder. Does Killua have a crush on Gon? Or am I just mis interpretating his text lines? 
4613,Do publishers pick certain seasons for a show to be published?,"I have been thinking about this for a while, but I haven't really been watching enough just-released anime to form a picture of what type of series are broadcast when.   I'm interested to know if publishers pick certain seasons for a show to be published? Or do they release it as soon as they have the idea, in the nearest season?  I'm sure there could be lots of reasons for a show to be published in a particular season instead of another one:   Scheduled Christmas Episodes, Valentines Day/White Day School Holidays / School Year Seasonal trends for particular genres Publishers know a similar title / popular title will be coming out   I don't really see any trends with this though.  The answer could be very publisher-dependent, but is there any evidence that any companies knowingly wait until a preferred season? "
4614,Why did Edward not wear a uniform?,"As far as I know, Edward Elric is the only State Alchemist who doesn't wear a uniform. Why was he treated differently? Did he have a special rank or something?     This is Edward current 'Uniform'    These are some state alchemist, all of them wearing a uniform. "
4615,What is the motive behind the Titan Shifters' actions?,"Okay, so I read a bit of the manga, and I know a good amount of spoilers. But why are most of the titan-shifters trying to destroy humanity? Eren and Ymir are good, right? Why do some titan-shifters want to destroy humanity, and what are Annie's, the Colossal Titan's, and the Armored Titan's backstories and motives? "
4616,Is there any significance to the comment on madeleines?,"Towards the end of the last episode of Serial Experiments Lain, we see Lain have a brief conversation with her father. At the end of it, her father says:     Lain, I'll make us some nice tea next time. Hey, with some madeleines! Definitely. They're great!   This seems to be a reference to Marcel Proust's ""episode of the madeleine"" in In Search of Lost Time. Assuming this is the case, is there any significance to this reference in relation to plot beyond the fact that (according to Wikipedia anyway - I haven't read Proust yet) in Proust, the madeleine is connected to a discussion of memory?  Given that this is followed (or follows, possibly) some comments on memory in the anime, it would make sense for this to be a ""standalone"" reference, but I'm wondering if there's any significance to this other than it just being a reference to a literary discussion of memory. (For instance, is there anything specific about Proust's discussion of memory that's also relevant in the context of SEL?) "
4617,What is an ONA?,"Searching through MAL and other anime sites, I found an unfamiliar type of anime. What is an ""ONA""? Is it different from a OVA?   "
4618,Who is it that killed Zephyr's crew and then became a warlord?,So I just watched the One Piece Movie - The Battle of Z and it left me wondering who it was that killed Zephyr's crew (while he was in the Navy) and then became a warlord? It says he was a devil fruit user and that is why he acquired that weapon on/as his arm to take out all the devil fruit users he could.   Does it get explained anywhere in the manga? Any helpful information would be appreciated! 
4619,Does Izanagi really require both Senju and Uchiha DNA?,"From the Chapter 510, you can see Tobi talking to Konan    Tobi happens to mention that Izanagi is available only to those with the power of both Senju and Uchiha. Is it really true? Because in the very next line he happens to mention that it is the power of the Sage of Six Paths.  That means either of the below 2 things are not-true.   We know that when Itachi explained Izanami to Sasuke, he happened to mention why the Izanami was created. It was because the Uchiha folks back then, used Izanagi for all wrong reasons. And most of those Uchiha certainly did not have the Senju DNA. So if what Tobi said was true, this has to be false. If what Itachi explained about Izanagi's misuse is true and that every Uchiha who knows the jutsu Izanagi can use it, then what Tobi mentioned to Konan was wrong.   So which of the following is true? Or probably what Tobi told Konan was a plot-hole by Kishimoto? "
4620,How can Colonel Mustang create his flame alchemy differently?,"When Mustang performs his flame alchemy, he doesn't clap his hands to create it, did he? He's only snapping his fingers:    The others seem to always clap when performing alchemy:    How does Mustang do this? "
4621,What's the story behind the item Celty is looking for?,"I know Izaya       has her legitimate head, but how'd she lose it in the first place? She's also a Dullahan, so I don't understand why she even wants her head back?  "
4622,Why couldn't Dante create a Philosophers Stone by herself?,"In the 2003 Anime Fullmetal Alchemist, in episode 45, she says that she had the Homunculi search for a Philosophers Stone because without Hohenhiem she was unable to create one by herself. But why?  Did she require knowledge that only Hohenheim had or was she simply not strong enough to do it? Because in a flash backs of Dante and Hohenheim's history, he did all the work, which would suggest that maybe she needed knowledge or strength or both, such as what Transmutation requires, but I'm not sure.  An answer would greatly be appreciated. "
4623,Is Chapter 66 the last chapter of Rosario Vampire Season II manga?,"Is chapter 66 the true ending for Season II? According to Akihisa Ikeda, this chapter would be the last chapter and for three months I could not find any more pages after this. However, it seems it's still ""to be continued"" as mentioned on the page.    Is this the last page/chapter? "
4624,What is the explanation of Yuki sending e-mail to Naoto?,Naoto boasts about his ability and gives 30 minutes handicap to other players. Then surprisingly Yuki sends a mail to Naoto in which she asks Naoto to stop fooling around.  I'm very confused at this point. I have finished the series and I haven't seen Yuki and Naoto together even once. There is not even another sign about they knew each other. What is the background of this intimate message? Where does they know each other?   (Episode 11) 
4625,When did the event related to Rurichiyo Kasumioji really happen?,"In Bleach, while Ichigo and the gang invading Hueco Mundo, they keep cutting away to Rurichiyo Kasumioji and her story:      they save her, kill the guys with the Hollow Swords, and save the head captain.   When did that really happen? Did they help her before or after going there? "
4626,Which song are they humming?,Is the song they are humming in episode 17 of muv luv alternative: Total Eclipse based on a real Russian song ? Or is it just some random song made up for the anime specific? 
4627,Why is Ulquiorra the only Espada with a second release?,"In Bleach Ulquiorra is the only Espada with a second release, and he admits he has not shown Aizen. So I have come to a few questions:   Why would he not show Aizen how powerful he is? Why is he the only Espada with a second release? If Aizen knew about his second release, where would he be in the Espada rankings?    "
4628,Is it common for mangaka to maintain the same characters design between different titles?,After reading rave-master and fairy-tail I noticed the high similarity in their characters. Some even being identical copies of the characters out of the other series.  So how common is it for a mangaka to maintain the same character design through out several of their manga's? Or is this just something Hiro Mashima does ?  
4629,Is the manga Kingdom based on historical events?,"Is the manga Kingdom based on historical events and/or entities?  and if so, how historically accurate is it?  and finally, if possible, where can I read about the history of China in these times (~245 B.C.)? "
4630,Did Staz's have to stop his Kamehameha?,"In episode 6 Staz almost unleashed a Kamehameha attack. Is it okay to use this move outside of the Dragon ball series? If Staz did unleash this Kamehameha, Would it be considerd copyright infringement? "
4631,Was the anime faithful to the light novel?,"Recently I finished watching Muv-Luv Alternative: Total Eclipse and was wondering. How faithful to the light novel was the anime? Are there any mayor deviations, or even minor ones? Or is it identical? "
4632,"What does the cry ""kon"" mean?","In the end of episode 9, Inari's assigned apprentice familiar Kon the two guardian foxes of Uka-sama start crying the sound ""kon"" and soon the other foxes around Inari shrine respond, gathering as blue magic fires on the road up the mountain.     Is this like dog's barking is transcribed as ""woof"" but in fox version? Or is it a name of some higher power they were calling? "
4633,Where do den den mushi come from?,Is it ever explained where the den den mushi come from?  We know there are all kind of den den mushi variating in colors as well in functions. But do they originate from a devil fruit user or are they just some random existing creature in the One piece universe ?  
4634,Can loose souls hide in males?,"After finishing the first season, I have noticed that all the loose souls so far have been hiding in female hosts.  I realize it makes sense for the male protagonist to be working with females, but is it possible for a male to have a loose soul?  Perhaps there is a female counterpart to Keima that deals with the males? "
4635,Why didn't Jiraiya use reverse summoning as a way to escape?,"We know that animals can reverse summon humans who have a contract with them. So, my question is: why didn't Fukasaku reverse summon Jiraiya to Mount Myoboku while fighting Pain? If Jiraiya had enough time to write on Fukasaku's back then a reverse summon could be performed easily in that time. This would end up giving Jiraiya intel on pain and leaving the Sannin alive.  Why was reverse summoning not used to save Jiraiya? Are there any limitations on the technique that prevent its usage? "
4636,How did Dante know that the Elric brothers were going to bring back their mother Trisha?,"In the FMA Wikia it says this...     In the first anime series, the remains of the failed human   transmutation that was Trisha takes on a larger role. After the   brothers rush away from the scene looking for help, the deformed,   living mass that was created manages to crawl away. Patiently waiting   not far from the house was Dante, who fed it the Red Stones necessary   to give it a human form.   Which leaves the impression that Dante knew that they would perform human transmutation on their deceased mother. Isn't it a bit strange that Dante is so conveniently close to the house when the incident happens? It seems to me that she knew this would happen.  So how did Dante know that the Elric brothers were going to bring back their mother Trisha? I also can't remember when this happened in the series. Please list the episode in your answer if possible. "
4637,Where does Team Rocket get all of their vehicles and machines?,Team Rocket usually uses some weird vehicle or machine. Where do they get them? Do they build them themselves or do they buy them somewhere?   
4638,Why did Jiraiya have to die?,"In Naruto, when Jiraiya fights Pain, he goes out of the barrier to confirm his suspicion about Pain (that all the 7 pains are dead) but he could have used a shadow clone instead. Shadow clones can transfer knowledge and experience (as told by Kakashi) and if Jiraiya had the chakra to maintain the barrier, swim when he is badly injured and then be alive just to write a message on the back of the toad (apparently I forgot the toad's name), he could have had the chakra to create a shadow clone. Why didn't he do so? [Why did he have die? I feel so sad about him :'( ] "
4639,Is Magi based on religion?,"I started reading the manga Magi recently and can't help but get the feeling that it is based on Islam.  I couldn't find anything online, and neither do I have enough knowledge about the religion to really confirm this either.  So is the story of Magi based on Islam? Or does it use certain key points from this religion? "
4640,What is this buzzing sound playing?,"I heard this on buzz channel which is an anime channel, and now also in bleach. In episode 2 You can hear it at around 14:00 in this youtube video  Does this sound have a specific name? or is it some sort of soundtrack? "
4641,How powerful is Homura's shield?,"In the anime, Homura is only seen using her shield to reset or rewind time until the first time she met Madoka.  Can't she rewind time for a minute, or an hour? If she could do it, I think it would be easier for her to fight against Walpurgisnacht.  And how far is its area of effect? When she was chasing a car, she couldn't stop time, but only a few parts were stopped and she still had to run to catch up to it (if she could stop time, she wouldn't need to hurry).   "
4642,Why can't Mirajane fight after Lisanna's death anymore?,"After Lisanna died in the accident, it is understandable when one sees Elfman's apprehension/fear that he will lose control over his full body takeover again- the reason why Lisanna apparently dies.  I understand Elfman not being able to use magic, but Mirajane? She was an S-class mage. Why does she end up waiting tables at Fairytail? Did her magical prowess diminish after the incident? "
4643,Do the Sharingan dots decide their power/ family tree?,"In chapter 674 page 9, Madara says that Sasuke is the only one who awakened a Sharingan with straight commas, just like his. After that, he says that there might be a connection between them, something beyond blood.     Does this mean that an Uchiha can be distinguished by their Sharingan? Does this also mean that the power of their eye is decided by the type of commas (tomoe) they have? "
4644,Why wasn't there an OP for Shinobu Time?,"Each of the arcs of the Monogatari series through the end of Second Season (Hitagi Crab, Mayoi Snail, ..., Hitagi End) has had an OP theme sung by the arc's heroine1, save for Shinobu Time (i.e. Onimonogatari), which did not have an OP theme at all.  What gives? Shinobu's voice actress is Maaya Sakamoto, who is probably the most talented singer out of the entire Monogatari cast! Why didn't she sing an OP for Shinobu's arc?    1 Well, the OP for Hitagi End (Koimonogatari) was sung by both Kaiki and Senjougahara, but I think we can agree that they were both the heroines of that arc. "

4646,Origin of the Japanese school bell,"I  am wondering why the Japanese schools, and apparently more Asian countries, use a melody as school bell. Searching around can only tell me that it is common, but can't really state the reason for that. Where does this originate from? Is this some kind of cultural influence?  Examples:  [website][website]"

4648,Meaning of the symbols used in Milky Way?,"In the new episode of Fairy Tail for 2014, Wendy uses a secret Dragon Slayer Art, Milky Way which grants her the power to communicate or call upon lost souls of dragons.    I couldn't help but notice the symbols. Is there some meaning behind it, are these required for this to work and is this a type of language?  What exactly are they? Are they suppose to mean anything, or are they just there for decoration?  Answers are appreciated. :) "
4649,What is Haruhi's power?,"I don't read the LN so I don't really know what she really is. She seems to have great power. She can make things happen just by thinking about it. She even create a parallel world. And she seems very dangerous even when she's unconscious. So, what exactly is Haruhi? What is her power? Did they explain it on light novel? "
4650,"How did Ei Sei's mother, the Queen Mother, escape/get rescued from Zhao?","In the story of the manga,       it is said that after Ei Sei escaped Zhao (and eventually rescued by Qin troops), the King became aware of his escape minutes right after they exited the last gate, sending Zhao's cavalry to search for him. Everyone but Sei died, and even then had to be rescued almost at the end of the way.  If they went through all this trouble to just get Ei Sei, it is only strongly implied that Sei's mother, who hadn't been rescued, would be in grave danger, probably geting killed some time soon (since Sei's Zhao pursuers at some point mentioned that it didn't matter if they captured Sei dead or alive), and if not heavily watched and/or tortured and disgraced more harshly that she had been before (since people's logic of those times was so flawed that they would go so far as to blame some innocent person from a nation for the crimes of some other person from the same nation).   Having said that, I am wondering how the hell did she get out from Zhao? (seeing as Sei's initially unnoticed escape was barely possible.)  But having read until chapter 185, yet another question arises in my head.      If Sei and his mother hated each other so much (she tried to kill him), why on earth was she rescued in the first place to begin with? A thorough explanation on this would be great and would stop me from having to open a new question.   Aside from this, comes a question that might be considered off-topic, but I'll ask it anyway just in case. Is there any similar real life historic records chronicling how Lady Zhao somehow moved from Zhao to Qin?  I've done a quick read of Wikipedia and seem to not find anything, however I will keep on researching and update this if I find the answer on my own. "
4651,Does Obito master the Summoning Jutsu?,"I've seen the recent episode of the anime, and I saw when Obito summoned Kurama. I'm interested in the fact that does he get into some kind of ""contract"" with some animals/things? (That would mean that he is really able to summon.) I've checked on the Narutopedia, and it appears only the Gedo Mazo is attached to his name, so is the summoning of the Nine-tails just a normal/simple summoning technique? Because you must have that kind of bond between you and the summoned animal, which is made with your chakra/blood, just like Naruto did with the toads and it would be weird if you would be able to summon a tailed beast just ""because"". "
4652,Why is Sakurai-sensei always sweating like a sprinkler?,"I never really figured this out. Is Sakurai-sensei always super-uncomfortable around people? Or is she nervous? Usually sweat drops jumping off someone is a vfx for surprise, but I don't think this is the case.     What's up with those crazy sweat drop novas all the time? "
4653,How did Dante die?,"In FMA Wikia, it says Dante is deceased, but how did she die?  In one of the episodes of the FMA 2003 Anime, we see Dante escaping in an elevator, but is confronted by Gluttony. All we see is her saying ""Not now Gluttony, I'll feed you later"", and then we see Gluttony lunging at her and her clapping her hands, but that's it.  I'm assuming she died from being eaten, but it sounds unlikely that after 400 years she would be beaten by someone as stupid as Gluttony. So how did she die? Not so sure on this one. "
4654,Who is the person behind Roka ??,"  In the following screenshot was taken in Episode 3 (16:26) of D-Fragment series. In that time, Roka Shibasaki seem role-playing herself as some sort of director in Japan. I would like to know who is the person she trying to portray ???  "
4655,How do online Nerve Gear games handle player authentication?,"So there is a virtual reality device, the Nerve Gear, popularly used for MMOs.  As far as I'm concerned, we never see SAO or Alfheim using any sort of login screen.  Now, it makes sense for SAO to lack a login screen, since you can't log out. But what about Alfheim? How do normal, sane games authenticate their players?   Do MMO Nerve Gear games use username/password credentials?  Is it implied anywhere in the series? If I recall correctly, Kirito would just put on his Nerve Gear and instantly enter Alfheim without any sort of password screen.  Maybe the device serves as the credential itself?  But if I steal your device, I could impersonate you in all games... Besides, using a device ID is not secure at all. If I figure out your device's ID, I could hack mine to use such ID and then login as yourself.  Perhaps they do some complex biological scan on your body to create an unique ID...  That doesn't sound very reliable. Or healthy.   "
4656,Why are most people in anime white or European-looking (instead of Japanese)?,"Anatomically speaking Europeans don't look like that either. But most of the people look more European than Japanese, at least it seems to me ... Maybe it's the round eyes? And the non-black hair in some cases? "
4657,Who is the new girl in Kirino's group?,"In the last episode of Ore no Imouto ga Konna ni Kawaii Wake ga Nai, there's one new member in Kirino's group: Otaku Girls Unite, and she seems to be somewhat important.   I know that this anime is already ending just like the light novel, and there won't be any further episodes. But I've been wondering, who is this new girl? Maybe they show it in the light novel? "
4658,Who were the survivors in Danganronpa?,"In the last episode, many survivors were shown in the outside world. Who were these people? Is there any reference anywhere telling about these people, who they were and how they managed to survive?  "
4659,Do the master of The Ryozanpaku Dojo resemble certain stereotypical descriptions?,"Do the master of The Ryozanpaku Dojo resemble certain stereotypical descriptions? If they do, which stereotypical appearance would this be? "
4660,Why didn't Sarutobi kill Danzo?,"As I'm watching these filler episodes, I am wondering, why was Danzo still alive, after doing all the things he did to The Third? He hid a Wood style user, he tried to assassinate Sarutobi (not even once), he tried to lure the Anbu forces to join the Federation, he tried to manipulate the Hokage election after the death of Minato, and so on (just from these couple of episodes, without mentioning the whole ""rivalry"" between them).  The Third was aware of the situations, since he warned Danzo a lot of times. So even if he was a member of the Hokage's council, why did Sarutobi endure the disrespect and danger that came from Danzo? I would've been pleased even with a ban from the Village, but given what he had done, Sarutobi could've eliminated Danzo without any efforts. "
4661,Did Shichika's father try to kill Nanami?,"In Episode 7, Nanami seemed to elude that when Shichika killed their father, the 6th Kyoto Ryu, his father was about to kill her, or she already knew that he was planning on killing her.  I am wondering, did Shichika's father try to kill Nanami? And for what reason? (Was it to ease her suffering, or to stop her from becoming more powerful from observing more of the Kyoto Ryu art?)  Also if he did try and kill her, did Shichika kill his father solely to protect Nanami? "
4662,Did Saori also have feelings for Kyousuke?,"In Ore no Imouto ga Konna ni Kawaii Wake ga Nai, almost all the girls confessed their feelings to Kyousuke, and      even Kanako confessed when Kyousuke came to her concert.    In OreImo season two, when they were discussing (fighting) about who was going to accompany and support Kyousuke on his new apartment, Saori also insisted that she was supposed to do so. Did she also have feelings for him or did she only tease him? Do they explain this in the light novel? "
4663,Who is this female character from the 2005 series?,"In the second half of the 233rd episode of the 2005 Doraemon series, titled ""Gravity Paint"" (重力ペンキ). There seems to be a new girl (left most one in the picture below) in the group. Who is she? When did she first appear?    This portion of the episode was adapted from Chapter 72 (or the 2nd Chapter in the 5th volume of the short manga series) of the manga chapter by the same name:    In the manga, Yasuo (aka ""Boy A,"" the one with the baseball cap) takes her place. "
4664,What does Accelerator say to Dark Matter at the end of their fight?,"After Dark Matter's defeat, he stabs Yomikawa to further hurt Accelerator, which causes Accelerator to sprout his black wings and then tell him something in angel language.  The English translation says:     “—yjrpEVILqw”   What does he say in Japanese though? I tried finding the raw but couldn't, and my Japanese-fu isn't that good. Anyone familiar enough knows what he says there? "
4665,Where did Nanami's Clairvoyance come from?,"When fighting Shichika in episode 7, Nanami mentioned her Clairvoyance, but she never said anything like that when fighting the Maniwani earlier (in episode 4, I think).   Was her Clairvoyance what allowed her to copy Maniwani's Kempo, and she just didn't name it in earlier episode? Or did she learned Clairvoyance somewhere else after she left the island, and as such she never had it when the Maniwani attacked her? And if it's the latter case, where did she learn it? "
4666,Where to start with Gundam?,"There seem to be a ridiculous number of Gundam series, spinoffs and movies. There also seems to be a lot of timelines, parallel universes which has confused me more.  I've tried looking this up before, but there's a large variety of differing answers depending on people's opinions.   As an anime fan, I think I should at least try it out. It might also help for understanding a lot of reference jokes in other series.  Where does one start with all these? Can you watch the series as standalones or should I start watching in a particular order? "
4667,When was the Wolkenritter summoned?,"In Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha A's, at the very beginning of the first episode, it showed the Book of Darkness activating. Later in the series, it showed this again, but continuing on showing that the Wolkenritter were summoned at this time, and they lived like a regular family with Hayate.  When they learn that the Book of Darkness was draining Hayate, the Wolkenritter began to attack the Time Space Administration in order to fill all the pages, thinking that by doing so they could save Hayate.  The Book of Darkness Incident, which would be the reference to the clashes between the Wolkenritter and the TSAB (particularity with Nanoha and Fate involved) is documented to have occurred in 0065 of the Mid-Childan Calendar, the same year that the Jewel Seed Incident occurred (first season of Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha).  I am wondering, when were the Wolkenritter actually summoned to Hayate's side? Was it before, during, or after the Jewel Seed Incident? "
4668,Which countries watch the most anime?,"You know, I just got curious, and I guess the answer would be somewhere around Asia.  For example I know in Canada they watch anime but I'm also wondering about places like Mexico, Europe, Russia, and so on . . . Do they watch anime like Bleach, Naruto, and more? I've been wondering this for a long time . . . Is it popular there? Or does it depend? "
4669,Which god of Japan is actually portrayed by Yato in Noragami?,"As far as I watched, Bishamon and Kofuku are portrayals of the Seven Lucky Gods (七福神 shichi fukujin). But it wasn't clear about Yato. Bishamon mentioned him as a God of Calamity, but there is no such god among the Seven Lucky Gods. So, which god might Yato be a portrayal of? Is he a new character altogether? "
4670,Symbols given by Sage of the Six Paths to Naruto and Sasuke Chapter 672,"In chapter 672 The Sage of the Six Paths engraves one symbol into Naruto and Sasuke:     Is there any symbolic link to these symbols?  To me it appears as though the symbols are sun and moon, light and darkness.   Also, does it have any connection to Naruto and Sasuke's chakra nature? Naruto's wind element chakra is the promoter for Sasuke's fire element, just like the sun's light makes the moon shine.  Another aspect that hit my eye, is Naruto's symbol is in his right hand, while Sasuke's in his left. The right and left make a perfect set.  So, my question is, is there a link in the symbols given to Naruto and Sasuke. And are these links intentional or unintentional? "
4671,What is the purpose of the fast appearing screens?,"Several fast appearing/disappearing screens are featured, during the episodes of the series. They stay on screen for one second or so, and appear out of the blue. This makes them basically impossible to read/understand, unless the viewer pauses the video.      So my question is, are they supposed to be fully understood? If so, is the viewer really supposed to pause the video every time a screen like this appears? Or are they supposed to be, maybe, only partially understood, and should we carry on with the episode even if we couldn't read/understand everything? Or are they really of no importance, and just used to produce some kind of visual effect? In this case, is the content of the screens of little or no importance? "
4672,Is there such a thing as Waifu-Wednesday?,"I found an interesting phrase here on Facebook page,     What is Waifu-Wednesday? Is there such a thing as Waifu-Wednesday? "
4673,"What is this show about girls that use ""spirits"" to fight?","Genre: Probably Shoujo/Fantasy or magic  Type of media: TV show/OVA?  Characters: Mostly girls with one main heroine and a male protagonist living in modern times (school attendance was probably involved)  Plot: The story revolves around girls with ""spirits"" they use to fight. The main heroine was using a ""fire spirit"" but only after she accepted it in one of the episodes. There also was a smaller girl, which was firstly her rival but they became friends after some time. The little girl was using a huge sword and in one scene in park lot she cut a car in half. Apart from the girls there is also a love story involved with the main heroine and a boy. In the end they have to fight some evil villain.  Time range: I watched it around year 2006?  I know this is as vague as it can get, but if someone could recognize it - it would be much appreciated! "
4674,Who is the father of Minato Namikaze?,"Does Namikaze mean a clan or is it just his second name?  I think the only way Naruto could defeat Madara Uchiha is to be in a blood-line relation with the Sage of the Six Paths, and thereby achieving a Rinnegan of his own.   Since Kushina, Mother of Naruto is from Uzumaki clan; which is a blood-relative of the Senju clan, it will make sense if Minato is from any distant clan related to Uchiha clan.  Is there any clue revealing who might be the parents of Minato?  "
4675,Where does the flow of power come from for a Transmutation Circle to work?,"On the Full Metal Alchemist Wiki under the Category  Alchemy. It says this...     The circle itself is a conduit which focuses and dictates the flow of   power, tapping into the energies that already exist within the earth   and matter. It represents the cyclical flow of the world's energies   and phenomena and turns that power to manipulable ends.   But does this energy not come from a parallel world on the other side of the gate where alchemy took a different form of science? Did it not come from the lives of those who died in that world? Or is this different in FMA Brotherhood, because I am certain this is what Hohenhiem told Edward in the FMA Anime (2003).  Answers are appreciated. :) "
4676,Who healed Obito?,"I remember there was old man. But was it Madara? And shared his sharingan?  But Madara should have Rinnigan there, isn't it?  If that was Madara then why he was raised much younger later? "
4677,How do Natsu and Happy get into Lucys house?,"Just wondering but how does Natsu and Happy end up breaking into Lucy's house? I am wondering on this since I heard a recent rumor that...     Mirajane has a spare key to Lucy's home and often gives the key to Natsu and Happy   I also wanted to ask this question since when Lucy comes home or gets out of the shower, Natsu and Happy seem to be there. Of course though it is only a rumor, but is there anything to go against this or any information to say this is true or not? I trust this site so that is why I am asking it here.  Answers are appreciated. :) "
4678,Lost name of multi book series about a girl knight and a bipolar guy,"I'm trying to remember the name of a multi-volume story. Each volume was perhaps 20-25cm x 10cm x 3cm thick, perhaps 120 pages?    Not in colour - black/white line drawing with some cross hatch shading (not grey scale shading in the rubbed style).  Story has a girl in a large waterproof underwater + warrior suit, like a knight but bulbous and big.  She has some sort of ""magical"" abilities, I think. Not all that sure about this bit. She visits castles and keeps, helps people with problems, quests, etc.  Story has a flying ship thing run by a manic-depressive (bipolar) guy who dresses like a dandy.  This guy also has a maid/cook girl with an odd disease - she has holes and missing limbs, I think it's called ""Null disease"". Other people across the lands have it as well.  Knight girl meets up with flying ship guy.    I remember the books from about 12 years ago, maybe? Not sure when they were written. I also remember them being in English AND left-top-right reading, not right-to-left style. "
4679,How important are those hand seals really?,"In Naruto we can see people make hand seals to do technique's. The further down the story we come the more neglected this becomes aka Naruto's rasengan does not need any hand seals to begin with. Minato also displayed the ability to form hand seals using a single hand.  So my question, how important are those hand seals anyway? How do they affect the juutsu they cast. And can evrybody do it with 1/0 hands if they train enough ?  "
4680,Are anime that are not based on manga common?,Has there ever been an anime that was not based on a manga? I notice that most if not all were actually mangas before they were turned into a TV series.  Is it common for an anime to be created without there being a manga first? Answers are appreciated. :) 
4681,"Where is ""See you Space Cowboy"" from?","I feel stupid not knowing, but I can't quite put my finger on where ""See you space cowboy"" is from. I know it's from an anime (that I think was made in the 90s?), but what anime specifically is it from? "
4682,How many times has the original Nine Tails attack been flashed back?,"After looking at episode 248, I managed to once again gain a nice little view of the Nine Tails attack on Konoha. Even though we get a different point of view each and every time, it still is the original Nine Tails attack... AGAIN.    With that said, I've been wondering: How many times have we actually seen the Nine Tails attack the village, or at least fragments of this? And if possible, how much screen time has this taken in the two series so far? "
4683,How does transplanting different sets of Sharingan eyes work?,"I know the details of those eyes, I know their combination gives birth to the Eternal Mangekyo Sharingan. When Madara was almost blind Izuna gave him his eyes, the same thing happened with Itachi and Sasuke.  In these two cases we've seen the Eternal Mangekyo Sharingan and here comes my question:   In the first case, Madara was ""blind"" and Izuna had the good eyes, the combination was the Eternal. In the second case, Itachi was ""blind"" and Sasuke had the full eyes, giving birth to the Eternal. So it's indifferent which eye it's transplanted in the host body? (It doesn't matter that the good eye gets a disadvantaged blind eye?)  As for the main question, how it is realized the ""fusion"" of 2 different eyes in one eye hole? I don't want to dig myself into the nerve/artery things. I'm interested more likely in the fact that how you mix 2 eyes into one and how the full eye and the blind eye, it's yet so much stronger??   "
4684,Why does Yuno fall for Yuki in the first place?,"It occurred to me that in the whole anime, there is never any reason mentioned for why she falls in love with Yuki. I mean, the first Yuno from the first dimension loved him as much as the Yuno from the second dimension and so on the third (probably). But there was never any explanation for why that made her like him so much. Is there anything that explain that in the manga? or somewhere else?  "
4685,Who will be the Noblesse after the current one dies?,"When Kadis Etzamal di Raizel dies, who will take his position? I haven't found references for the Noblesse before Rai nor who will be his successor. Isn't there any information available? "
4686,What is the definitive Initial D collection box?,"I've already watched every episode from the series (downloaded from torrent sites), but wanted to buy an official box since I feel bad about not having the original stuff.  I wanted to know if there is a definitive dvd/bluray box edition. I always struggled with finding decent quality video/audio.  Ideally there would be a Blu-ray collection in 720p at least and with 5.1 DTS Japanese audio.  By making a quick search on ebay, I found this one, which is scheduled to release in a few days, but I don't know exactly it's specifications.  Where should I be looking for this stuff? It would obviously be ideal if English subtitles were available, but I guess I'm stuck with Japanese releases if quality is concerned. "
4687,Why does the first Season of Naruto have different Openings at the same time?,"I've just been reminded of this from reading another question. For the first Season of Naruto (before the Chunin Exams) i've seen 3 openings.   Southen Cross 10's Toasted TV (Dubbed - Zabuza's blood spurt from Haku and Kakashi being blind-sided by shuriken are black and white freeze frame. Naruto Poison scene is normal) Cartoon Network (Dubbed - no censor as far as i know) DVD (Dubbed - No Censor)   i suspect also the 4Kids version which for the Naruto Poison scene, Naruto is complaining about dropping his lunch, may also have a different opening however i actuly have never seen that (however i hear it notorious since it changes so much)  i am wondering why there are so many different openings for the same episodes?  NOTE: the Naruto Poison Scene is after they fight the 2 Water Ninja and Naruto makes that speach of not running away after extracting the poison with a Kunai. Kakashi then says something like      Ahh Naruto, that was cool how you took out the poison and all, but if you don't treat the bleeding soon, your going to die. *pause* it's a good idea to stop the bleeding now   EDIT: all 3 openings i have seen occur for the same episodes, ie. Episode 2 on the DVD has one opening, the same episodes on Cartoon Network and Toasted TV has different openings. "
4688,Why was Tobi not proactive after all missing nins got recruited for Akatsuki?,"As far as I know, Tobi didn't come to limelight until Sasori's death (I am talking as per the chronological order of the telly series). He teamed up with Deidara after Sasori's death. He knew Nagato and his team long back but he was not proactive with the organization at the beginning of series.  Why didn't he volunteer himself? Is it because Akatsuki work in pairs and he didn't have anyone? Or was he waiting for the right moment to join with the organization? "
4689,Is there a reason why the actors sound exactly the same as their anime counterparts in the live action movies?,For the first time today I watched Death Note and Death Note the Last name (real life movies) and I noticed that the actors sound exactly the same as their anime counterparts. Why is this?  E.g. Light Yagami in the real life movie sounded exactly the same as in the anime. Is this just me?  Answers are appreciated. :) 
4690,Who took care of Naruto when he was young?,"In episode 350, we see that the Third Hokage took on to take care of Naruto. But towards the beginning of the anime Naruto is seen to be living alone.   Did Naruto live with the Third? If so, why did he leave there? "
4691,How and why did the Tailed Beasts grow up?,"From the start of the series, we saw the Tailed Beasts as large, vicious, and angry entities bound inside the bodies of jinchuriki. They were shown to despise the humans who bound them and used their power for personal gain. But they weren't always like this.  Initially, they were shown as small and emotionally open towards the Sage of Six Paths. While I understand why they hate humans now, I don't understand why and how they grew larger from their small size to something equivalent to an 'adult size'?   They are now shown as a large mass of chakra. When they die they re-form. Also, as we have seen, when the kyuubi was divided into two separate parts, his size was reduced. But that reduction in chakra didn't make him small again.   So can anyone explain:   How did the Tailed Beasts grow from chibi to adult size? (Do they grow up like normal animals?) Also, do chibi Tailed Beasts have less power and chakra than their adult forms?  "
4692,How do the women of Amazon Lily reproduce?,"I just got to the part where Luffy arrived to Amazon Lily.  I started wondering, how do the women multiply in Amazon Lily as there are no men? There were kids, so they must've some method.    Maybe you could explain? "
4693,Did Midorima forget to bring his lucky charm in the Winter Preliminaries?,"As we all know, in Kuroko no Basketball, Midorimia usually brings along a lucky charm according to his horoscope for each day. For example, he once bought a bear with a fish in its mouth, as that was the lucky charm for the day. However, in the Winter Preliminaries against Seiho, I haven't seen him mentioning a lucky charm or holding a lucky charm, and I also couldn't see any lucky charm on the benches during the game.    Was this just that he forgot about it? Or was this a problem with the writers and producers, as they may have forgotten to include this crucial detail? I think this is quite unusual for Midorimia to not have a lucky charm during the game, as he has clearly demonstrated that he always had one.  Note: I noticed this during Season 2, Episode 30. "
4694,Izaya wants to be a god?,"In the final episodes of Season 2 of Durarara!!!, if I remember correctly, he said something about wanting to become a God himself? And what did he mean by this again? The series did not explain it very well.  The quote from the Wikia, which this scene takes part at, as far as I can remember     Anri confronts Izaya about his actions, knowing he was behind not just the incident with the yellow scarves, but also with the slasher attacks as he was the one who gave Haruna Niekawa the information she needed to start her attempted invasion. The two fight briefly but Izaya gains the upperhand and escapes. As he leaves, he angrily declares to Saika that he is the only one who can love humanity and that he refuses to share them with a sword.  "
4695,Does the usage of Haki affect the user in any way?,"We know that Haki is a mysterious power present inside every individual. But only few people are able to awaken and use it. It is very closely related to the willpower of a human being. So the question which arises here is: Does the use of Haki affect the user (physically or mentally) in any way? Does excessive use of Haki take a toll on the user?   If it is so, how exactly does it affect the user, since Haki isn't something like a physical energy? If it isn't so, why don't the Haki users use it all the time? Why do they use it only in specific cases like a battle, or entering enemy territories, etc?  "
4696,Which philosophers have influenced Death Note?,Which philosophers have influenced Death Note? What is the name (or category) of their philosophies? I want to read deeper. 
4697,Why exactly does Kyoko attempt to save Sayaka?,"In episode 8 of Puella Magi Madoka Magica, we see Sayaka transform into a witch, and in that episode and the subsequent one (at least in the second half of it) we see Kyouko's attempt to save her.  Why exactly does she seem so determined to do this, given that she'd talked earlier about living for oneself? (e.g. Perhaps out of sympathy for Sayaka's situation or a change of heart? Or maybe because of her ""goals"", which don't seem to be very well-specified when referred to in episode 9?) "
4698,Is Suzaku Kururugi completely oblivious of the Purges of Shinjuku Ghetto and the Saitama Ghetto?,From Episodes 10-13 there is a huge moral guilt bestowed on all the characters. And I find it funny because its from one battle where barely 1% of the casualties experienced from the purges were met.   Suzaku Kururugi wants to fight for Britannia to save his people (or hope they integrate into the system) but is he aware of what Britannia does to the Elevens?  Like honestly he thinks what the BKs do are wrong yet hes morally ok with mass executions of children/elderly. Is this explained? 
4699,Are 3DCG-based animes cheaper to produce?,"I've been noticing that CG in anime has becoming more popular. Recently, I've watched several shows that have almost fully 3D animation.  Arpeggio of Blue Steel and Knights of Sidonia:     I've also noticed it appearing to smaller effect in parts of other shows, such as Girls Und Panzer, when the focus is not directly on the characters:    It seems that primarily mechanical objects are done with 3D technologies as the measurements are exact. This doesn't surprise me, but human characters are notoriously hard to do with computer graphics - see the Uncanny Valley . For this reason I would have thought making 3d anime characters (who don't even have normal human proportions) would be expensive to do right.  Is the reason anime companies are starting to use this technique more for characters, that it has become cheaper to implement? Or is there another reason for this slowly increasing popularity? "
4700,Is Non Non Biyori's location based on a real one?,I have seen the photos at the end of the Non Non Biyori episodes and they seem to resemble places from within the anime. I wonder if all those photographed places belong to roughly the same location.  In other words: Is the Asahigaoka village in Non Non Biyori based on a real one?  And if yes: Where is this located? 
4701,Who is the old man at the end of Nijigahara Holograph?,"At the end of Nijigahara Holograph (Rainbow Field Holograph), Amahiko meets an old man at the hospital who gives him the box he carried around for the whole manga containing ""a spell"". The old man then asks Amahiko what his name is and tells him he is called Amahiko too, just before turning into a butterfly (or so it seems from the last scene):    However in the whole story there isn't any other character named Amahiko so I'm confused about who the old man is, also because I've read various theories on different websites.  The old man and Amahiko could be the same person, however this would create a loop since  Amahiko (old version) would give the magic box to himself (young version) and wouldn't really explain why does he seem to turn into a butterfly.  Another interesting theory is that the old man is God (or some kind of supernatural being) who came on earth to encourage Amahiko who was kind of depressed and didn't want to stand up and recover from the fall, this is supported by the fact that he seems to know a lot about Amahiko (however this is also a good point for the first theory), his face is never shown clearly and he just disappears/turns into a butterfly (and the butterflies have a lot of supernatural meanings in this manga).  There's also the possibility that Amahiko, being lost in his own world, imagined the old man, but he is shown talking to another character at the beginning of the manga so I don't think this is the case.  So, my question is, who is this old man? And whoever he is, what does this character mean/represent? What does the magic box represent since it isn't actually opened by Amahiko?  I really like this manga, but there are so many details I need to clear up a bit! "
4702,Is it possible to make such a clean cut?,"I started reading Rurouni Kenshin, and came across this scene:    Is it possible to perform such a clean cut, or is this just some made up anime fiction? If so, what is the name of this style/trope? (I don't particularly dislike seeing it. It has its charm.)  Edit:  As it seems materials seem to play a large role in the possibility, the tools used in this particular setup are:   A daikon radish A kitchen knife in the 11th year of Meiji (1878) made by a legendary swordsmith's son.  "

4704,Why is it common for anime to lack surround sound?,"With all this push for HD video, I would think HQ audio (5.1 surround sound) would be obvious. But I am having trouble finding any TV anime in 5.1; One Piece from Japan is only stereo (movies are an exception), Crunchyroll does not have any 5.1 according to their support, most anime series listed on sale say on Amazon (or even Rightstuf) don't even seem to have a field for the sound type (stereo or surround).   Why is this?  According to a reddit user:     ISDB supports 5.1 but in practice most broadcasts are stereo, with 192k AAC audio.   [1]  Another question of mine would be why would the DVD releases not support 5.1? "
4705,What is the name of Scar's brother?,"I was watching FMA Brotherhood, and I was wondering if any of the episodes in the original FMA Anime revealed Scar's brother's name. Now that I think about it, it really didn't really address it. Did they leave it out as it was not important? So far I haven't had any luck finding his name in any of the FMA or FMA Brotherhood episodes.  Does anyone know his name? "
4706,What are the remaining phenomena Heartseed places on the club members?,"The anime &amp; OVAs of Kokoro Connect only cover up to the light novel ""Kokoro Connect - Michi Random""  But there are several other novels:   Kokoro Connect Clip Time Kokoro Connect Nise Random Kokoro Connect Yume Random Kokoro Connect Step Time Kokoro Connect Asu Random (volume 1) Kokoro Connect Asu Random (volume 2) Kokoro Connect Precious Time   The Wikipedia page mentions other phenomena, such as ""Perspective Dreamland"", but this seems to be roughly translated and I have no idea what it entails.

4707,How did C.C get her scar?,"In Code Geass, when we see C.C mainly topless we see that she has a scar on her left breast.  The first time we see this is when Lelouch tried to get C.C to move away from the Lancelot when she's feeding Suzaku shock images to destabilize him. when Lelouch touches her he sees her memories and there is a scene where C.C is naked in a river and there is a close shot of her scar.  However in the scenes were we see when C.C obtained the Code I can't really see the scar on her when she's in the church naked talking to the nun who gave her Geass. After C.C is covered in blood from killing the Nun who gave her Geass i still don't see the scar.  The scar itself kinda looks like a trident and not the Geass Sigil which questions if it's even linked to Geass itself. So i am wondering, when and how did C.C get this scar? also given how she been shot in the head and stabbed with shrapnel and healed completely how come the scar hasn't healed as well? "
4708,Is it ever explained why Maya is rejected by the Ocean Agency?,"In the anime: ""Daphne in the Brilliant Blue,"" is it ever explained why Maya is rejected by the Ocean Agency?

4713,Why do fansubbed animes have a reminder to not sell their fansubbed product?,"Why do fansubbed animes have a reminder to not sell their fansubbed product?

4716,Do we know how old Kakashi is?,"I've been wondering, since I can't find an exact age... While watching these filler episodes, he appears as the ANBU Kakashi, who was leading his team. Being the Senpai of Itachi he looks exactly (maybe for me) like he does in the present day... Is this a coincidence? Or couldn't the animators be bother to add additional ""lines"" to his face? Note that we've seen the newborn Naruto, that would mean that Kakashi looks the same as he did 17-18 years ago.. "
4717,"In Death Note, what happens to Light Yagami after he dies?","I read the manga and am currently watching the anime.  Ryuk once commented that users of the Death Note can neither go to heaven nor hell. (Though one source claimed that this was only a fake rule that Ryuk wrote/spoke.)  This suggests Light becomes a Shinigami. If so, why does Light not continue the work he began on Earth? Does L (who also touched the Death Note) become a Shinigami as well, somehow preventing Light from doing his deeds? "
4718,Did Mest have a guild mark?,"With respect to the recent questions about guild marks, there seems to be an important piece of information missing.  A main purpose of a guild mark should be to identify who is part of a guild. When Mest infiltrated fairy tail, did he have a guild mark? Could he have faked a guild mark?   My impression is that he merely had to cover enough of his skin with cloths so they assume his mark is hidden as no one would think to check.  "

4722,Is there an explanation for Natsu's motion sickness?,"In Fairy Tail, Natsu is prone to getting sick whilst on modern transport. I am asking this question because it kind of annoys me when he gets motion sickness while fighting someone on board train or other forms of transport. These are the known forms of transport that he gets sick on such as...   Cars Trains Vehicles ... And many and all forms of transport that moves.  I think an exception to his motion sickness is when he is flying on Happy, but can't really think of anything else that he doesn't get motion sickness on. And waves, just discovered in Episode 133 (quite strange).   Generally, he gets motion sickness from all non organic transportation. He also gets motion sickness when riding on other people. He is also known to get sick from looking or thinking about all different forms of transport, e.g. looking or thinking about trains.   Was it ever explained in the anime or manga why Natsu suffered from motion sickness? And why did Wendy's motion sickness spell not work at all? Did something happen to Natsu in his life that made him suffer from motion sickness? If yes, please include it in the answer! Also, please refrain from using the reason ""Natsu built up immunity to Wendy's motion sickness spell"" in your answer, unless that's all you can possibly give me.  Answers are kindly appreciated. "

Answers are appreciated. "
4724,How do Demon Weapons work in Soul Eater?,"I don't understand exactly how they work. I've got the basics, but I want to know the details.  Simply put, a Demon Weapon is a person who can transform into a weapon. Alone they aren't much of a threat, but paired with a Weapon Meister the two are very powerful. But later in the Soul Eater series we see how some Weapons and Meisters pose a serious threat on their own, but they look trained and experienced, so it seems to be more of a guideline.  In the first few episodes there's talk about 100-soul ritual, where a Demon Weapon has to consume 99 Kishin eggs and 1 witch soul. The Weapon is supposed to level up after that somehow, and the effects of that aren't very clear to me.  The only thing that hints at the magnitude of such upgrade is that Death uses Maka's father as his weapon, him being a Death Weapon. It's like the two most powerful guys in the show together, yet not much is apparent about how it affects their power (both Meister and Weapon).  Also, we see some Meisters teamed up with more than one Weapon. They can resonate their souls and it somehow works for them. It seems this is kind of the same as multiple Weapon-Meister combos resonating all of their souls together. But what about combos with only Weapons and only Meisters? Would that work?  I'm also confused about how a basic Weapon and an upgraded one should be called. Are they Demon Weapons or Death Weapons?   What does completing this 100-soul ritual do for Weapon and Meister? What about combos with 1 Weapon and >1 Meisters? What are the basic and upgraded Weapons called?     Soul Eater Not! just started airing, possibly shedding more light on the mechanics of that world, but I guess the answers to these questions can be found in Soul Eater. "

4726,How does a Hidden Mist ninja have the Byakugan?,"We know that the Byakugan is the dōjutsu kekkei genkai of the Hyūga clan of the Hidden Leaf. And each village does its best to try and keep such coveted powers to themselves.  But in a recent filler episode of Shippuden, Episode 358 to be exact, a ninja from the Hidden Mist was shown to have used the Byakugan and could locate Uchicha Shisui, thereby asking his team to retreat. How does a ninja from a village other than the Hidden Leaf and not of the Hyūga bloodline have the Byakugan?  Is this for real or is it just another mistake by the animators? Is there a mention of such a ninja in the manga(I follow only the anime and not the manga)? "

4732,"When Edward and Alphonse try to transmute their mother, how come they didn't gain anything?","So, to my understanding, the idea of alchemy is equivalent exchange, in which you get in return as much as you gave.  This doesn't make sense to me, as in the beginning when they tried to transmute their mother back, Alphonse lost everything, and Edward lost his leg. They didn't get anything in return, or at least anything worth of a soul and a body. After this Edward transmuted his arm to get Alphonse back.  So, put in a calculation:  Things lost   Random piled ingredients which were supposed to compose the average human Alphonse's body Alphonse's soul Edward's arm Edward's leg   Things gained   A blob of purple stuff with Alphonse's soul affixed to it ( for a while ) Alphonse's soul   So, where the hell did the rest of the stuff go? And more importantly, why could they not just have transmuted everything back? "
4733,Where does the shroom on the head come from?,"If been re-watching some Gintama episodes and noticed the parasitic mushrooms in some episode. Which started to grow on their head and slowly take them over.  I also came across the pokemon Paras to which something pretty similar happens:     While Paras' symbiotic relationship with the mushrooms on its back isn't exactly normal, it is beneficial for both; Paras feeds the mushrooms with its body, and the fungus provides additional means of defense. Exactly how much control the mushrooms can exert over the Pokemon isn't clear, but odd goes to disturbing when Paras evolves into Parasect.      It's hard to say exactly what change takes place at Level 24, but for some reason, the mushrooms take their chance and merge into a single organism, taking over the Paras in the process. With heightened aggression and a pair of zombified milky eyes, anything cute or endearing about Paras is replaced by a demonic drone known as Parasect.   So now my question: where does the parasitic mushroom come from? Is this made up in anime, or like allot of other anime components based on some kind of folk lore? "
4734,Why do Aria and Suzu always play the drum and whistle?,"When Shino explains the school's rules, Aria and Suzu always play a drum and whistle. Why is that? Is this a reference to anything? Or is it just a Seitokai Yakuindomo thing?   "
