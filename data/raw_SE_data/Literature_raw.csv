"What does Nuvoletta's disappearance signify in Finnegans Wake?","<p>I am studying Samuel Barber's art song ""Nuvoletta"", whose text is adapted from James Joyce's <em>Finnegans Wake</em>. I have not studied <em>Finnegans Wake</em>. The music is very beautiful.</p>

"What was ""Rip Van Winkle"" based on?","<p>I was recently surprised to discover that the story of Rip Van Winkle is credited to the US author Washington Irving, who published it in 1819. I'd always vaguely imagined it to be a Brothers Grimm story or an old (probably European) folk tale. It certainly has the feel of such stories.</p>

<p>Was it, in fact, based on one? Or did Washington Irving come up with the story out of whole cloth, inspired merely by the idea and atmosphere of traditional folk tales in general?</p>

"How did people know the meaning to Shakespeare's new words?","<p>I don't pretend to know much about the history of literature, but I was always told that Shakespeare invented an awful lot of words, 1700 is usually the number given.

"Where did the idea of a ""true name"" come from?","<p>There's a common trope in Western fantasy that, up until now, I've sort of taken for granted: the ""true name.""</p>

<p>This is the idea that all things have <em>true names</em> that are somehow more closely linked to what the thing <em>is</em>, and that knowing it grants some degree of power over the thing. This has many forms and tropes, but they all have the exact same underlying elements. </p>

<p>Most commonly, though, it's used as a plot device with regard to <em>people</em>: </p>

<ul>
<li>That in order to figure out someone's true name, you have to totally understand them. </li>
<li>That true names are to be kept secret at all costs. </li>
<li>That finding your own true name requires some sort of developed sense of self-knowledge. </li>
<li>That knowing someone's true name allows you to bend them to your will. </li>
</ul>

<p>Some works seem to apply these to objects, or ideas themselves, but they ultimately stem from people and (more generally) sentient beings. Still, the idea <em>does</em> seem to show up in one form or another in <em>many</em> fantasy books. </p>

<p>Where did this idea come from, originally? Does it have a clear source?</p>

"Did Shakespeare consider Julius Caesar a tyrant or a martyr?","<p>I've seen the Shakespeare play <em>Julius Caesar</em> interpreted in two different ways (by people with different social and political views, naturally):</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>either</strong> Caesar as a power-mad tyrant who got his comeuppance, and Brutus and Cassius as freedom fighters sadly defeated by Caesar's former lackeys who now sought power themselves;</li>

"Why do the Grayer twins switch places?","<p><strong>This question contains spoilers for David Mitchell's <em>Slade House</em>.</strong></p>

<p>The first four chapters of Slade House end with the narrator in the twins' attic, sitting around a candle with them. I noticed that during Sally's viewpoint, they've switched places around the candle:</p>

<h3>Freya</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Left of the candle hovers a woman in her midthirties.</strong> She's familiar... it's Maggs the landlady, but twenty year younger, slimmer, blonder, smoother-skinned and eerily beautiful. <strong>Right of the candle is a man of the same age</strong>, also blond, and also known to me... as I study him, a young Fred Pink emerges from his face.</p>

<p>This seems like a mistake to me, but is there any evidence whether or not it really is (from inside or outside the book)? Has this been changed in another edition, has Mitchell commented on it, etc? As far as I can tell from the story, while the twins can work all sorts of magic, switching places in the attic should be impossible, since time doesn't pass in the attic between these scenes.</p>

<h3>Is there an existing tuition system in the real world that this system resembles?</h3>

<p>I ask this question because many pieces of the University (besides, of course, the alchemy classes) seem to be based on real world higher education, including fairly accurate representations of chemistry labs, among other things. Kvothe's struggles in making his tuition payments are discussed a lot in the first two books of the series, so I was wondering if this tuition system is based on anything currently or previously practiced in real institutions of higher learning. No school that I have attended has ever used a system remotely similar.</p>

"Is there any evidence that George Orwell read 'For whom the bell tolls'? Did Hemingway read 'Homage to Catalonia' or (later) '1984'?","<p>Orwell was familiar with Hemingway, who was already very famous by the 1920s. Mostly Orwell was quite scathing about Hemingway, because of his macho image.</p>

<p>Hemingway was relatively favourable towards the official Communists, did this contribute to Orwell's antipathy towards him? Did he ever read Hemingway's novel about the Spanish Civil War?</p>

<p>Did Hemingway read Orwell's book on the Spanish Civil War, Homage to Catalonia?</p>

<p>Did Hemingway read 1984 (obviously, <em>after</em> he had written <em>For whom the bell tolls</em>)?</p>

<p>Edit: I see from the Hemingway list below that Ernie owned <em>three</em> copies of <em>Homage to Catalonia</em>, including a first edition from 1938. I recall reading that only a few hundred copies were printed in '38 (HoC flopped as direct political pamphleteering) so this must have been a fairly rare first edition. Perhaps someone knows if Hemingway was the kind of man to collect books without reading them, or if he would have probably read what books he owned.</p>

"In ""Love,"" who is Junior's ""Good Man,"" and what does that imply about her?","<p>Late in Toni Morrison's <em>Love</em>, Junior starts referring to her ""Good Man"":</p>

  <p>They recognized each other the very first night when he gazed at her from his portrait. But it was in dream they got acquainted. No fuss, no bother, no recriminations -- he lifted her up to his shoulders, where she rode through an orchard of green Granny apples. When she woke in a bright, cold room, the dream-warmth was better than the blanket.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The portrait, unquestionably, is of Bill Cosey. But the leap that Junior makes -- from tough-as-nails, look-out-for-number-one survivor, to imagining a dead man as her personal protector -- seems to me surprising, out of character, and pretty  arbitrary.</p>

<p>Why does Junior ""adopt"" Cosey and cast him into the role of her ""Good Man""? What does this signify about her character? Are we meant to understand her as being insane, unstable -- or is this part of her character more thematic?

  <p>Sometimes the boat fought the mid-stream current, with a verdant world on either hand, and remote from both; sometimes she closed in under a point, where the dead water and the helping eddies were, and shaved the bank so closely that the decks were swept by the jungle of over-hanging willows and littered with a spoil of leaves; departing from these “points” she regularly crossed the river every five miles, avoiding the “bight” of the great binds and thus escaping the strong current; sometimes she went out and skirted a high “bluff” sand-bar in the middle of the stream, and occasionally followed it up a little too far and touched upon the shoal water at its head—and then the intelligent craft refused to run herself aground, but “smelt” the bar, and straightway the foamy streak that streamed away from her bows vanished, a great foamless wave rolled forward and passed her under way, and in this instant she leaned far over on her side, shied from the bar and fled square away from the danger like a frightened thing—and the pilot was lucky if he managed to “straighten her up” before she drove her nose into the opposite bank; sometimes she approached a solid wall of tall trees as if she meant to break through it, but all of a sudden a little crack would open just enough to admit her, and away she would go plowing through the “chute” with just barely room enough between the island on one side and the main land on the other; in this sluggish water she seemed to go like a racehorse; now and then small log cabins appeared in little clearings, with the never-failing frowsy women and girls in soiled and faded linsey-woolsey leaning in the doors or against woodpiles and rail fences, gazing sleepily at the passing show; sometimes she found shoal water, going out at the head of those “chutes” or crossing the river, and then a deck-hand stood on the bow and hove the lead, while the boat slowed down and moved cautiously; sometimes she stopped a moment at a landing and took on some freight or a passenger while a crowd of slouchy white men and negroes stood on the bank and looked sleepily on with their hands in their pantaloons pockets,—of course—for they never took them out except to stretch, and when they did this they squirmed about and reached their fists up into the air and lifted themselves on tip-toe in an ecstasy of enjoyment.</p>

"Why does the former nurse create with metal?","<p>In Kay Chronister's short story ""<a href=""https://www.shimmerzine.com/the-fifth-gable-by-kay-chronister/"" rel=""noreferrer"">The Fifth Gable</a>,"" the women who live in the four-gabled house are described in an interlude.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Before they had been women who lived in the four-gabled house, they
  had been:</p>
  
  <p>A maiden aunt.</p>
  
  <p>A minister’s wife.</p>
  
  <p>A washed-up stage actress.</p>
  
  <p>A nurse.</p>
  
  <p>They did not resemble themselves anymore.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I might be wrong, but as I see no other order to this list, I think that the first description (""A maiden aunt"") belongs to the woman who makes her bed in the first gable, and the second to the second etc. There is a certain amount of support for this throughout the story; for example, when the women of the house bury Marigold's third child (the one from the woman who makes her bed in the first gable), it would seem appropriate that the minister's wife would suggest a religious activity for the funeral.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“We should sing a hymn,” said the woman who made her bed in the second
  gable.</p>
  
  <p>“Why?” said the woman who made her bed in the fourth gable.</p>
  
  <p>“It’s conventional. She’d like that.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It makes sense that the woman who makes her bed in the third gable, whose reproductive process is linked to drama, is the ""washed-up stage actress."" A stereotypical minister's wife would keep a garden, I suppose, so it makes sense that the woman who made her bed in the second gable would produce botanical offspring.</p>

<p>I just don't understand why a former nurse would be associated with technology, and children made of metal. I guess it's possible that the women's life-creating powers don't relate to their former occupations, but then those don't really need to be mentioned at all, right? (And that also would contradict the pattern I established above.)<br>
Although, to be fair, associating the nurse with the almost-biological process of the woman who made her bed in the <s>first gable</s> cellar does make a certain amount of sense.</p>

<p>Another possibility is that the order of former vocations does not match the order of gables. I just think it makes sense to make the list follow that order; besides, if I'm right about the actress and the minister's wife, that means that half of the list <em>does</em> follow that order.</p>

"What are the Shadow Children?","<p>In Gene Wolfe's loose trilogy of novellas <em>The Fifth Head of Cerberus</em>, the middle story (<em>""A Story"" by John V. Marsch</em>) is the one which gives us the most direct insight into the lives of the so-called 'abos' or Annese, the original indigenous inhabitants of Sainte Anne. The story focuses on the twins Sandwalker and Eastwind, but the Shadow Children, mysterious person-like creatures who dwell on Sainte Anne together with the people, also get a lot of page time.</p>

<p><strong>Who or what are the Shadow Children?</strong> When they talked about having come from another world, I assumed they were humans who had somehow had their form taken from them by the Annese, and that this explained the humanoid form of the Annese in this story. But in the third story, <em>V.R.T.</em>, it seems as though the splashdown at the end of this story really was the first arrival of humans on Sainte Anne ... so where did the Shadow Children come from, why are they so insubstantial now (if they're not human, were they always that way?), and what is their relationship to the Annese?</p>

<p><sub>Even though I've now finished the whole trilogy, there are still things to be understood and mysteries to be unravelled! This reflects the depth and subtlety of the stories and the world Wolfe created. Perhaps I should reread the second one.</sub></p>

"How does scansion work in Arabic poetry?","<p>I was reading about Arabic poetry on <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_poetry"" rel=""noreferrer"">Wikipedia</a>, and specifically the description of scansion:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The rhymed poetry falls within fifteen different meters collected and explained by al-Farahidi in <em>The Science of ‘Arud</em>. Al-Akhfash, a student of al-Farahidi, later added one more meter to make them sixteen. The meters of the rhythmical poetry are known in Arabic as ""seas"" (<em>buḥūr</em>). The measuring unit of seas is known as ""<em>taf‘īlah</em>"", and every sea contains a certain number of taf'ilas which the poet has to observe in every verse (<em>bayt</em>) of the poem. The measuring procedure of a poem is very rigorous. Sometimes adding or removing a consonant or a vowel can shift the <em>bayt</em> from one meter to another. Also, in rhymed poetry, every <em>bayt</em> has to end with the same rhyme (<em>qāfiyah</em>) throughout the poem.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This confused me for a number of reasons.</p>

<ul>
<li>What does it mean to have fifteen different meters? Meter in poetry is the overall rhythmic structure; are the fifteen different things actually <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot_(prosody)"" rel=""noreferrer"">feet</a>?</li>
<li>Is ""seas"" really just another word for meter, or is there some significant difference between the ""seas"" of Arabic poetry and the meter of western poetry?</li>
<li>Since seas are made up of taf'ilahs, does that mean it's a <em>taf'ilah</em> which is basically a foot?</li>
</ul>

"Is ""The American Claimant"" a veiled take on ""The Indian Question""?","<p>Mark Twain's 1892 novel <em>The American Claimant</em> was written very soon after the Wounded Knee Massacre (1890), which was basically revenge for the 1876 Battle of Greasy Grass (""Little Big Horn""). This unprovoked and wanton slaughter was seemingly the final nail in the coffin of Indian resistance to Euro-American territorial incursion and cultural forced assimilation.</p>

<p>Although ""anti-Indian"" for the first decades of his life, it seems Twain at the end re-thought his position on them.</p>

<p>Could it be that the titled English heir in <em>The American Claimant</em> (Berkely Rossmore, who even dressed up as a cowboy and took the name Howard Tracy to remain incognito) was meant to represent wealthy Euro-Americans, whereas the uncouth and eccentric American (Mulberry Sellers) was a symbol of the ""Indians""?</p>

<p>Note that the character Washington Hawkins, a confederate of Sellers', was from Cherokee Strip (land taken from the Cherokees in the ""Oklahoma Land Rush"" of 1889).</p>

<p>Also, to quote from the book where the Earl of Rossmore speaks of the rights of the American Claimant: ""<em>...morally the American tramp is rightful earl of Rossmore; legally he has no more right than his dog.</em>""</p>

<p>Even L. Frank Baum (author of <em>The Wizard of Oz</em>) admitted that the way the Indians were treated was wrong, although he still called for their utter destruction.</p>

<p><sub>BTW, although I love ""<em>Tom Sawyer</em>"" and ""<em>Huck Finn</em>"" as much as (and probably more than) the next guy, <em>The American Claimant</em> may be my favorite novel from this, my favorite author. It is at least as topical as anything else he's written, too, and is replete with zombies, robots, mass-produced monstrosities, etc. etc. It could make a great movie. Are you listening, Hollywood?

"Was John Galt foolish in wanting to return to the world so quickly?","<p><strong>John Galt was a genius</strong>. He invented ""the motor"" and executed the greatest strike in world history. And it's clear that he understood the danger he was always in (out in the world) and how the looters operate.</p>

<p>So it has always been puzzling to me why, at the end of Atlas Shrugged, Galt thought it was a good idea to go back to the world so quickly after the final crash and bring all the strikers with him.</p>

<p>Granted, the lights had gone out in NYC, the Taggart bridge had collapsed, and the nation was near starvation. But the political leaders such as Mr. Thompson and all his cronies were still--at least to some degree--in power.</p>

<p>If the strikers had come back and started fixing everything, why would anyone believe that Thompson's gang wouldn't have immediately started exploiting them, regulating them, taxing them to death, and controlling them? I would have thought that the strikers needed to wait long enough for the current government leaders to be swept from power and run out of town, clearing the way for the strikers' return.</p>

<p>Rand makes it clear that the strikers cared little for political power, so we cannot assume that upon their return they would have tried to step into the shoes of political power in order to achieve their goals. They simply would have gone back to work, and once again been exploited by the looting politicians.</p>

<p>Admittedly, we don't know how much time passed between the rescue flight back from the State Science Institute and the moon-lit walk in the valley in which Galt declares to Dagney that ""we're going back"", but it certainly seems as though very little time had elapsed. Weeks? Days?</p>

<p>I wish to first introduce the current accepted interpretations of <em>Finnegans Wake</em>, and rail against these  on purely aesthetic grounds.
I will then pose questions suggesting an alternative reading, which now appears obvious to me. </p>

<p><em>Finnegans Wake</em> aside, Joyce has stayed with me, unlike most of the ""difficult""  postmodern texts, because Joyce's texts always <em>resolve</em>. The more you read the clearer Joyce becomes. Confusions clear into beauty. Once upon a time (and a very good time it was) I could not parse ""a moocow coming down along the road""! Later for ""Chrysostomos"" and ""Send us bright one, light one, Horhorn, quickening and wombfruit"". There are <em>now</em> many readers' guides to <em>Ulysses</em> that (1) members of this forum would mostly agree on, and, (2) make an initial reading of Ulysses a pleasurable task. </p>

<p>Twenty odd years ago, I began reading <em>Finnegans Wake</em>, and was immediately dismayed. No matter how I tried I could not parse even a few pages in. Armed with <em>A Skeleton Key</em> and <em>A Reader's Guide</em> I forced my way through. I was very disapointed and neither of the texts lead to <em>Finnegans Wake</em> <em>resolving</em> for me. To this day, every text I have read on <em>Finnegans Wake</em> seems hollow. Until recently so did <em>Finnegans Wake</em>.</p>

<p>Here is the conventional wisdom.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The book discusses, in an unorthodox fashion, the Earwicker family,
  comprising the father HCE, the mother ALP, and their three children
  Shem the Penman, Shaun the Postman, and Issy. Following an unspecified
  rumour about HCE, the book, in a nonlinear dream narrative, follows
  his wife's attempts to exonerate him with a letter, his sons' struggle
  to replace him, Shaun's rise to prominence, and a final monologue by
  ALP at the break of dawn. The opening line of the book is a sentence
  fragment which continues from the book's unfinished closing line,
  making the work a never-ending cycle.</p>
  
  <p>The introductory chapter (I.1) establishes the book's setting as
  ""Howth Castle and Environs"" (i.e. the Dublin area), and introduces
  Dublin hod carrier ""Finnegan"", who falls to his death from a ladder
  while constructing a wall. Finnegan's wife Annie puts out his
  corpse as a meal spread for the mourners at his wake, but he vanishes
  before they can eat him. A series of episodic vignettes follows,
  loosely related to the dead Finnegan, most commonly referred to as
  ""The Willingdone Museyroom"", ""Mutt and Jute"", and ""The
  Prankquean"". At the chapter's close a fight breaks out, whiskey
  splashes on Finnegan's corpse, and ""the dead Finnegan rises from his
  coffin bawling for whiskey and his mourners put him back to rest”,
  persuading him that he is better off where he is. The chapter ends
  with the image of the HCE character sailing into Dublin Bay to take a
  central role in the story.</p>
  
  <p>Part IV consists of only one chapter, which, like the book's opening
  chapter, is mostly composed of a series of seemingly unrelated
  vignettes. After an opening call for dawn to break, the remainder
  of the chapter consists of the vignettes ""Saint Kevin"", ""Berkely and
  Patrick"" and ""The Revered Letter"". ALP is given the final
  word, as the book closes on a version of her Letter and her final
  long monologue, in which she tries to wake her sleeping husband,
  declaring ""Rise up, man of the hooths, you have slept so long!"",
  and remembers a walk they once took, and hopes for its re-occurrence.
  At the close of her monologue, ALP – as the river Liffey – disappears
  at dawn into the ocean. The book's last words are a fragment, but they
  can be turned into a complete sentence by attaching them to the words
  that start the book.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The motifs I have seen suggest something like </p>

<ul>
<li>Finnegan/HCE  = Bloom, Joyce, Adam, etc., the master builder <em>and</em> the average man, overloaded with Homer, ?, Jesus, etc. </li>
<li>ALP = Molly, Nora, Eve, etc.</li>
<li>CAD = Blazes Boylan, Gogarty, The Snake?, etc., but also with  overtones of CAD~Finnegan/HCE </li>
</ul>

<p>Really? The genius who took Stephen to Bloom and Molly (with Boylan), had nowhere further to take this key structure than into the abstract? <em>No fundamental movement?</em> Sure Shaun and Shem is interesting, but we have already met Stephen+Mulligan. Come on. ""(please stoop)""!</p>

<p>Joyce taunts us with the question ""Who is he?"" and tempts us with tidbits of answers.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[261.26]
  Terror of the noonstruck by day, cryptogam of each nightly bridable.
  But, to speak broken heaventalk, is he? <strong>Who is he?</strong> Whose is he? Why is
  he? Howmuch is he? Which is he? When is he? Where is he? How is he?
  And what the decans is there about him anyway, the decemt man? <strong>E</strong>asy,
  <strong>c</strong>alm your <strong>h</strong>aste! Approach to lead our passage!</p>

<p>But the answers I have met in texts about <em>Finnegans Wake</em> seem empty. He is every man, but impossible to pin down. <em>But isn't Bloom every man?</em> Finnegan is a mythical/historical pre-shadow to HCE. <em>But what about Bloom and Homer?</em> Finnegan is but one form of HCE in dreamland with no referent in Heliopolis. <em>So why the title to the novel?</em></p>

<p>And the corollary question: Who is she?</p>

<p>The Joyce I know from <em>Ulysses</em>, wouldn't leave these questions without proper resolution. I don't think Joyce would leave it so open that all possible answers are the solution to the problem. I hope. A bit unrewarding for the amount of work the reader must put in. </p>

<p>And why no real drama for us to sink our teeth into? For example, both <em>A Reader's Guide</em> and <em>Finnegans Wake: A Plot Summary</em> read Anna's monologue as Anna awaking her husband HCE, in her mind, and then taking him on a stroll down memory lane. Is that really it? Not unlike Molly's monologue but without Blazes Boylan! </p>

<p>SPOILERS FOLLOW</p>

<p><strong>An Alternative</strong></p>

<p>The novel ends with a woman's interior monologue. Part IV is a single chapter that begin in dreamland, with dawn breaking, and ends with ALP delivering an interior monologue, as the rain falls softly, but persistently, outside. Ten pages of uninterrupted interior monologue.
A single paragraph readable to anyone familiar with Molly's monologue. By Occam's Razor, the owner of this monologue is the owner of dreamland, i.e., ALP dreams the wake (see <a href=""https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/6430/in-finnegans-wake-surely-the-dreamer-is-this-character"">In Finnegans Wake, surely the dreamer is this character?</a>). So that answers ""Who is she?"".</p>

<p>Anna's monologue is primarily addressed to a male ""you"" whom she 'awakes'. ""Rise up, man of the hooths, <strong>you</strong> have slept so
long!"". There is also a ""him"".
While ""there’s a great poet in <strong>you</strong>"", 
""so has <strong>he</strong> as bored me
to slump.""
While mostly addressed to ""you"", often about ""him"", 
the reader must cope with sudden pronoun-referent shifts characteristic of any realistic interior monologue. As ALP thinks about ""him"", ""you"" is prone to change in referent, i.e., ""you"" refers to ""him"" suddenly.
And naturally, there are few proper nouns, none definitive!</p>

<p>But who are these male ""you"" and ""he""? We are back to the question ""Who is he?"" but with a twist.</p>

<p>Anna/Joyce, frustratedly, give us the answer as we transition into the monologue.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[619.10] 
  <strong>Here gives your answer, pigs and scuts!</strong><br>
  Hence we’ve lived in two
  worlds.<br>
  He is another he what stays under the himp of holth.<br>

  <p>Soft morning, city! Lsp! I am leafy speafing.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>In Heliopolis there is a he other than HCE.</li>
</ul>

<p>While HCE, the ""herewaker"" will get up and face a new day in Heliopolis, HCE is <em>not</em> the ""he what stays under the himp of holth"". ""He is another he"".</p>

<p>That other ""he what stays under the himp of holth"", will <em>not</em> be getting up to roam Heliopolis, because
<em>he is dead</em>.
In <em>Heliopolis</em>, he ""stays under the <strong>himp of holth</strong>""
""under our  our <strong>mounding’s mass</strong>"", 
""and their upturnpikepointandplace is at the <strong>knock out</strong> in the park
where oranges have been laid to rust upon the green since devlinsfirst loved livvy"".
Sad, but true.
Infact,
""one yeastyday he sternely
struxk his tete in a tub for to watsch the future of his fates but ere
he swiftly stook it out again, by the might of moses, the very water was eviparated"", since he <em>had no future</em>.
""He addle liddle phifie Annie
ugged the little craythur"".
But then,
""wan warning Phill filt tippling full. His howd feeled heavy, his hoddit did shake. (There was a wall of course in erection) Dimb! He stottered from the latter. Damb! he was dud. Dumb""! The rest is herstory. </p>

<ul>
<li>This other he is Finnegan, ALP's <em>first</em> husband. He has been dead for many years by the time the novel begins. He died without completing his ""masterwork"". </li>
</ul>

<p>At the end of chapter one,
""good Mr Finnimore, sir"" is urged to ""take your laysure like a god
on pension and don’t be walking abroad"" since ""you’d only lose yourself
in Healiopolis now"".
Finn is kept up to date about ""the lads is attending school nessans regular, sir,
spelling beesknees with hathatansy and turning out tables by
mudapplication"" (Shaun and Shem)
and ""queer Behan and old Kate"" (Saunderson and Kate)
and "" your missus in the hall"" (ALP),
but no mention is made of Issy. </p>

<ul>
<li>Finnegan and Anna are the parents of the twins.</li>
<li>Issy is <em>not</em> born of Finn and Anna. </li>
</ul>

<p>Issy is born of Anna and ""that samesake sibsubstitute of a hooky salmon"". ""There’s already a big rody ram lad at random on the premises"", namely HCE, and it is HCE, not Finnegan, ""who will be
ultimendly respunchable for the hubbub caused in Edenborough"". 
He is Anna's ""P.S."". He is "" Soldier Rollo"".
Oh, and he is ""ensectuous"", which means, amongst other terrible things, raping your daughter: ""went nudiboots with trouters into a liffeyette when she was barely in her tricklies"". HCE is horrible. ""Rolloraped"". Here comes every man. #metoo #mishemishe</p>

<ul>
<li>Issy is born of Anna and HCE. </li>
<li>HCE is <em>not</em> the biological father of the twins.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, in Anna's monologue, who is ""you"" and who is ""he""?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[HCE]  will get
  himself up [...] when but, young as of old,
  for my daily comfreshenall, a <strong>wee one</strong> woos.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The receiver of Anna's confession, her father confessor, does not seem to be HCE, but rather some ""wee one"". </p>

<p>So who is this ""wee one""? </p>

<p>Let us resist jumping ahead to the monologue for clues, and attempt rather to let Joyce reveal the answer. </p>

<p>Since ""wee"" means small, one possibility is Issy. But the ""you"" in Anna's ""comfreshenall"" is most certainly male and hence not Issy.  Issy  features large in the monologue, but as ""she"". </p>

<p>Recently for me, the pun dropped. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Definition of wee. 1 : very small : diminutive. 2 : very early</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The receiver of the confession, the ""wee one"", is the earlier one, i.e., Finnegan. He only existed earlier, and now only exists in the ""wee"" hours. <em>(Of course, Finn is also late.)</em> The symbol of ""wee one"" as small one is <em>also</em> valid, since Anna will shortly tell ""you"" that ""You’re but a puny"". </p>

<ul>
<li>Anna primarily addresses her interior monologue to Finn, not HCE.</li>
</ul>

<p>In <em>Heliopolis</em>, Anna ""resurrects"" Finn every morning in her daily waking morning interior monologue. He must begin again. Anna is conscious of this activity. In <em>dreamland</em> too is Finn nightly resurrected, but that is obvious, and Anna is not conscious of it.  </p>

<p>This interpretation is supported by the monologue itself.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[619.25] Rise up, man of the <strong>hooths</strong>, you have slept so long! Or
  is it only so mesleems? On your <strong>pondered palm</strong>. Reclined from cape to
  pede. With pipe on bowl. Terce for a fiddler, sixt for makmerriers,
  none for a <strong>Cole</strong>. Rise up now and aruse! <strong>Norvena</strong>’s over. I am leafy,
  your goolden, so you called me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Notice that it is the ""man of the <strong>hooths</strong>"" that Anna 'awakes', rather than the man of the house.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[622.16] <strong>You</strong> know where I am bringing you? You
  remember? When I ran berrying after hucks and haws. With you drawing
  out great aims to hazel me from the hummock with your sling. Our
  cries. I could lead you there and I still by you in bed. Les go dutc
  to Danegreven, nos? Not a soul but ourselves. Time? We have loads on
  our hangs. Till Gilligan and Halligan call again to hooligan.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is Finnegan, not HCE, that Anna 'awakens' for this daily early morning ""helpyourselftoastrool"". The primary ""you"" is Finnegan. There is also, however, a ""he"".</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[619.31] But there’s a great poet in <strong>you</strong> too. Stout Stokes would take you offly. So has <strong>he</strong> as bored me to slump.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>The secondary ""he"" is HCE. </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>[627.36] And it’s old and old it’s sad and old it’s
  sad and weary I go back to <strong>you</strong>, my cold father, my cold mad
  father, my cold mad feary father, till the near sight of the mere size
  of <strong>him</strong>, the moyles and moyles of it, moananoaning, makes me seasilt
  saltsick and I rush, my only, into <strong>your</strong> arms.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>""You"", ""my cold father"" confessor, is Finnegan, and ""him"" is HCE. That's drama.</p>

<p>[... Note that John Gordon has ""you""=HCE, because there is no Finnegan, and no explanation as to who might the ""he"" of the monologue might be. Further he has ""wee one"" = Issy, with no explanation as to why Anna confesses to a male. William York Tindal has the ""you"" in the monologue being HCE, although morphing into Finn at times, and with no analysis of the ""you"" and ""he"" in the monologue ...]</p>

<p><strong>Alternative Motif</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Finnegan = Bloom, Joyce, Adam, etc., <em>but dead</em> <strong>before</strong> completing their ""master work"". Finns sin, ""finfin"", is an affair with Kate.</li>
<li>ALP = Molly, Nora, Eve, etc., but after the death of their first husband (Finn), but now married to HCE.</li>
<li>HCE = Blazes Boylan, Gogarty, The Snake?, etc., i.e., the average man, and he is <em>not</em> nice. HCE's sin is, amongst other things, an 'affair' with Issy. </li>
</ul>

<p>Joyce is able to look beyond his death, and truly write a ""Book of the Dead"", since he still lives in Nora's mind. Nora, has had to move on, and here comes everybody. </p>

<p>While Finnegan/Joyce/Bloom/Adam died (in this story) without completing their ""master work"" (<em>Finnegans Wake</em> in Joyce's case), ALP/Nora/Molly/Eve still reads this work, and dreams with its language. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[623.31] Scratching it and patching at with a prompt from a primer. And what
  scrips of nutsnolleges I pecked up me meself. Every letter is a hard
  but yours sure is the hardest crux ever. Hack an axe, hook an oxe,
  hath an an, heth hith ences. But once done, dealt and delivered,
  tattat, you’re on the map.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><s>As an example of how this reading makes things clearer, consider the mystery of the four wise men ""mamalujo"". Who are they? Look in any text on <em>Finnegans Wake</em> and you will find the answer disappointing. With this reading, however, they are certainly Finnegans childhood friends, still very much alive tonight.</s>(1)</p>

<p><strong>Summary of Question</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Surely, HCE and Finnegan are distinct characters in Heliopolis, but Finnegan is dead by the time the novel begins?</p>

<ol>
<li>Like HCE, Finnegan too has a referent in Heliopolis (not only in dreamland).</li>
<li>Finnegan is not HCE.</li>
<li>Finnegan was Anna first husband, but is dead before the novel begins. He died without completing his ""master work"".</li>
<li>Finnegan and Anna are the biological parents of the twins.</li>
<li>HCE is Anna's husband/partner by the time the novel begins.</li>
<li>HCE and Anna are the biological parents of Issy.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Further, in Anna's monologue, surely the monologue is primarily addressed to Finnegan, not HCE?</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Expected Answers</strong></p>

<p>In am expecting answers of the forms, ""No Finnegan is unlikely to be Anna's first husband because..."", or, ""No, in the monologue, Anna is more likely to be addressing her (current and only) husband HCE, because ..."", etc. Explanation, however, would need to be given to the ""pigs and scuts"" answer, as well as to the ""you"" and ""he"" in Anna's monologue. I am also interested in any references to analyses of Anna's monologue. </p>

"How much of Fantastica remains the same between iterations?","<p>Each time a human comes to Fantastica, the whole world is essentially 'rebooted'. We see this in chapter 13, where Bastian and the Childlike Empress start off in total empty nothingness, before he begins to make wishes and the world begins to be (re)created around them.</p>

<p>On the other hand, some features of the world remain unchanged. Not only the Childlike Empress herself; also, for example, Atreyu and Falkor, or the country of the Sassafranians (mentioned in both halves of <em>The Neverending Story</em>, before and after Bastian's arrival).</p>

<p>This raises the question: was there really total nothingness before Bastian started to make wishes? Did Atreyu, Falkor, the Sassafranian country, and so on exist only because he wished for them? (If so, Atreyu has a remarkable amount of free agency for someone recreated only through Bastian's will.) Could anything he remembers from the previous Fantastica be recreated? (But that would include many things that had been swallowed by the Nothing.) In short:</p>

<h2><strong>How much of Fantastica survives between iterations - what and why?</strong></h2>

"Did Isaac Bashevis Singer write only in Yiddish, or also in English?","<p>While researching another question, a couple of us have found what appears to be a contradiction in the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Bashevis_Singer"" rel=""noreferrer"">Wikipedia page for Isaac Bashevis Singer</a>. The introductory section of the article says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>He was a leading figure in the Yiddish literary movement, writing and publishing only in Yiddish.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Bashevis_Singer#Language"" rel=""noreferrer"">section 2.3 on language</a> says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>He edited his novels and stories for their publication in English in the United States; these versions were used as the basis for translation into other languages. He referred to his English version as his ""second original."" This has led to an ongoing controversy whether the ""real Singer"" can be found in the Yiddish original, with its finely tuned language and sometimes rambling construction, or in the more tightly edited American versions, where the language is usually simpler and more direct.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>None of these claims on Wikipedia is cited to anything else, and the language section in particular is full of <em>[citation needed]</em> notes. So what is the truth of the matter? Did Singer write his stories only in Yiddish, and merely permit others to translate them into English? Or did he write the English versions himself as well?

<p>What is the meaning of the line in bold? ‘Eden tree’ would seem to be one of the trees in the Garden of Eden, either the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_of_life_(biblical)"" rel=""noreferrer"">tree of life</a>, or the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_of_the_knowledge_of_good_and_evil"" rel=""noreferrer"">tree of the knowledge of good and evil</a>. ‘Tongue-leaved’ might mean ‘with leaves like tongues’ or ‘with leaves that speak’, but I can’t make any sense of ‘eye-figured’.</p>

<p>Cook says of this line:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The reference in this passage must be to a legend or allegory which I cannot trace. A friend suggests that the use of the epithets ‘tongue-leaved’ and ‘eye-figured’ was ‘due to some allegorical woodcut of the early sixteenth century, representing the tree of the knowledge of good and evil’.</p>

"Confused about the meter and rhythm of Ulysses by Tennyson","<p>Ulysses is written in iambic pentameter. There are a few spondees and trochees thrown in for good measure, but I'm confused in some places, like here:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I cannot rest from travel: I will drink<br>
  Life to the lees: All times I have enjoy'd<br>
  Greatly, have suffer'd greatly, both with those<br>
  That loved me, and alone, on shore, and when<br>
  Thro' scudding drifts the rainy Hyades<br>
  Vext the dim sea: I am become a name  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the second line, there's a trochee (<code>Life to</code>), but then it continues on normally. Ok. Fine. The line after that does the exact same thing (<code>Greatly</code>). What goes on in the fourth and sixth (last) lines, though?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>That loved me, and alone, on shore, and when</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The first pair (<code>that loved</code>) is an iambic foot, the second (<code>me, and</code>) is what? A trochee? The third (<code>alone</code>) is, finally, an iamb. The rest are iambs.</p>

<p>What goes on in Tennyson's head when he creates such a weird structure? How does he decide to break the rules, and where? Also, is it correct to think in pairs when breaking down a poem like this?</p>

<p>Similarly, the last line is also funky:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Vext the dim sea: I am become a name</p>
</blockquote>

<p><code>Vext the</code>: trochee.</p>

<p><code>Dim sea</code>: spondee?</p>

<p>There's also a line at the end of the poem that has 11 syllables, but I guess he just thought ""shit, this sounds so good I just <em>have</em> to leave it in"" because it's the best line in the entire thing. But I'm guessing that's not the usual thought process going on?</p>

"What is the history of the universe/canon/word-of-god approach to literature?","<p>Over on the <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com"">Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy Stack Exchange</a>, some participants apply the following theoretical approach to the interpretation of fiction:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The role of fiction is to <a href=""https://scifi.meta.stackexchange.com/q/1541/2502"">describe a fictional ‘universe’</a>, and an important <a href=""https://scifi.meta.stackexchange.com/q/5152/2502"">task of readers</a> is to determine facts about that universe by analysis of the sources.</p></li>
<li><p>Sources can be divided into ‘<a href=""https://scifi.meta.stackexchange.com/q/4783/2502"">canon</a>’ (works accurately describing the universe) and apocrypha (works that purport to describe the universe but which can be rejected as false, for example, <a href=""https://scifi.meta.stackexchange.com/q/6730/2502"">fan fiction</a>).</p></li>
<li><p><a href=""https://scifi.meta.stackexchange.com/q/2027/2502"">Canon determination</a> is based on a <a href=""https://scifi.meta.stackexchange.com/q/4783/2502"">hierarchy</a> <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/q/117948/2502"">of closeness</a> to the ‘main’ source or sources, or to the author, whose pronouncements are described as ‘<a href=""https://scifi.meta.stackexchange.com/q/9276/2502"">Word of God</a>’.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Does this approach to literature have a name? Has it been studied? What is its history? Is it purely a ‘folk theory’ or does it have an academic counterpart? Terry Eagleton’s <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Eagleton#Literary_Theory_and_After_Theory"" rel=""noreferrer""><em>Literary Theory</em></a> purports to give a “reasonably comprehensive account of modern literary theory” but does not mention it.</p>

<p>The earliest work I know that takes a similar approach is ‘<a href=""http://www.diogenes-club.com/studies.htm"" rel=""noreferrer"">Studies in the Literature of Sherlock Holmes</a>’ (1911) by <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Knox"" rel=""noreferrer"">Ronald Knox</a>, but Knox and the other early participants in the ‘<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlockian_game"" rel=""noreferrer"">Sherlockian game</a>’ were clear that it was to be played with tongue in cheek:</p>

"Doubts concerning Chapter 15 of ""Persuasion"" by Jane Austen","<p>I am having trouble understanding a passage in <a href=""http://www.gutenberg.org/files/105/105-h/105-h.htm#chap15"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Chapter 15</a> of Jane Austen's <em>Persuasion</em>. This chapter describes Mr. Elliot's renewal of acquaintance with his family, from whom he was previously somewhat estranged, while they are all staying in Bath.</p>

<p>The particular phrases and sentences in this passage that I am having trouble with are as follows.</p>

<ol>
<li><blockquote>
  <p>but he had now been a fortnight in Bath</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Does this mean that Mr. Elliot was presently staying at Bath? Why this confusion arose is because, at the end of the chapter, Mr. Elliot is being shown as visiting Camden Place. So, how could be Mr. Elliot be staying at Camden Place and visiting it at the same time?</p></li>
<li><blockquote>
  <p>Colonel Wallis had known Mr Elliot long, had been well acquainted also with his wife, had perfectly understood the whole story.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Colonel Wallis had been well acquainted with Mr. Elliot's wife. So, this means that Mr. Elliot had a wife and seemed to live perfectly happliy with her. Yet it has been shown that Mr. Elliot fancied Elizabeth to a certain extent. Why is that so?</p></li>
<li><blockquote>
  <p>Allowances, large allowances, she knew, must be made for the ideas of those who spoke. She heard it all under embellishment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What does it mean for Anne to hear it all ""under embellishment""?</p></li>
<li><blockquote>
  <p>Most earnestly did she wish that he might not be too nice, or too observant, if Elizabeth were his object; and that Elizabeth was disposed to believe herself so, and that her friend Mrs Clay was encouraging the idea, seemed apparent by a glance or two between them, while Mr Elliot’s frequent visits were talked of.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can't follow this at all: why did Anne ""wish that he might not be too nice""? What was ""the idea"" that Mrs Clay was encouraging?</p></li>
<li><blockquote>
  <p>Anne mentioned the glimpses she had had of him at Lyme, but without being much attended to.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What is the meaning of this sentence?</p></li>
<li><blockquote>
  <p>He, who had ever boasted of being an Elliot, and whose feelings, as to connexion, were only too strict to suit the unfeudal tone of the present day! He was astonished, indeed! But his character and general conduct must refute it. He could refer Sir Walter to all who knew him; and certainly, the pains he had been taking on this, the first opportunity of reconciliation, to be restored to the footing of a relation and heir-presumptive, was a strong proof of his opinions on the subject.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here Mr. Elliot has been shown as someone possessing somewhat negative qualities. For, he apparently tried to project himself as someone who never boasted of being an Elliot nor did he appear to conform with the feudal standards of the society back then. Yet he would mention of his connection with Sir Walter Elliot to anyone who he would meet and attempted to reconcile with the Elliot Family as he was the heir to the Elliot estate.</p>

<p>Then why would Lady Russell bear positive notions about Mr. Elliot?</p></li>
</ol>

They write the script with one part missing. It's a new idea. The home-maker, that's me, is the missing part. When it comes time for the missing lines, they all look at me out of the three walls and I say the lines: Here, for instance, the man says, 'What do you think of this whole idea, Helen?' And he looks at me sitting here centre stage, see? And I say, I say —” She paused and ran her finger under a line in the script. “ 'I think that's fine!'

"Why did Rachel Carson begin “Silent Spring” with an allegory?","<p>Rachel Carson begins her book <em>Silent Spring</em> with an allegory, explaining how a small American town with beautiful nature, one day is destroyed and all the birds stop singing.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There was a strange stillness. The birds, for example—where had they gone? Many people spoke of them, puzzled and disturbed. The feeding stations in the backyards were deserted. The few birds seen anywhere were moribund; they trembled violently and could not fly. It was a spring without voices. On the mornings that had once throbbed with the dawn chorus of robins, catbirds, doves, jays, wrens, and scores of other bird voices there was now no sound; only silence lay over the fields and woods and marsh.</p>

"Can the success of ""The Day of Doom"" be attributed to above average literacy in colonial America?","<p>""The Day of Doom"" has been described as America's first bestseller, but can that be attributed to the above-average literacy rate among Puritans and in America overall? Would this poem have been less successful in Seventeenth-Century England, as the literacy rate there was very low? 
I do concede that I don't know for a fact if there was an above-average literacy rate in America at the time of the poems release, so clarification on this would also be appreciated.</p>

"In ""Orphans of the Sky"", what does the society's treatment of women indicate about the society?","<p>In Heinlein's <em>Orphans of the Sky</em>, the people on the Ship treat women as if they're not people. There are references to ""naming"" their women like dogs, they make deals with father and husband, and are, I believe , referred to as ""wenches"" at several points. There are no women in high positions. There's also this quote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>He washed himself, and went thence to the compartments of his uncle, for whom he worked for his meals. His aunt glanced up as he came in, but said nothing, as became a woman.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These seem to reflect negatively on the society. However, the story was originally published in 1941. Women's rights in <a href=""https://www.theclassroom.com/feminism-during-1940s-14003.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">the 1940s</a> weren't the way they were today.</p>

<p>So, two closely related questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Was this intended to reflect badly on the society, or was it simply in line with the thoughts of his time?</li>
<li>Regardless of what the author thought, how <em>does</em> this change our perception of the society in the Ship?</li>

  <p>It was when we had come back from Canada and were living in the rue Notre-Dame-des-Chanps and Miss Stein and I were still good friends that Miss Stein made the remark about the lost generation. She had some ignition trouble with the old Model T Ford she then drove and the young man who worked in the garage and had served in the war had not been adept, or perhaps had not been <em>serieux</em> and had been corrected severely by the <em>patron</em> of the garage after Miss Stein’s protest. The <em>patron</em> had said to him, ‘You are all a <em>generation perdue</em>.’</p>
  
  <p>’That’s what you are. That’s what you all are,’ Miss Stein said, ‘All of you young people who served in the war. You are all a lost generation.’</p>
  
  <p>’Really?’ I said.</p>
  
  <p>’You are,’ she insisted. ‘You have no respect for anything. You drink yourself to death ...’</p>
  
  <p>’Was the young mechanic drunk?’ I asked.</p>
  
  <p>’Of course not.’</p>
  
  <p>’Have you ever seen me drunk?’</p>
  
  <p>’No. But your friends are drunk.’</p>
  
  <p>’I’ve been drunk,’ I said, ‘but I don’t come here drunk.’</p>
  
  <p>’Of course not. I didn’t say that.’</p>
  
  <p>’The boys <em>patron</em> was probably drunk at eleven o’clock in the morning,’ I said. ‘That’s why he makes such lovely phrases.’</p>
  
  <p>’Don’t argue with me, Hemingway,’ Miss Stein said. ‘It does you no good at all. You’re all a lost generation, exactly as the garage-keeper said.’ </p>
</blockquote>

<p>What does this mean? How does one lose oneself, or even a whole generation? What is it that they have lost? And where did they lose it? In other words, what did Gertrude Stein mean by saying this and what did Hemingway mean by including this exchange and what does it mean in the later context of American history? More broadly, are there any other references to this in Hemingway’s work? </p>

"Is this hypothesis about the significance of the name ""Denna"" in the Kingkiller Chronicle supported by the text?","<p>There's a somewhat popular theory about The Kingkiller Chronicle, which is that the name ""Denna"" derives from the use of denner resin, and its addictive properties. </p>

<p>The theory branches two directions: the first speculates that the name is supposed to be symbolic, rather than textual. Denna is an addictive person for Kvothe to be around, and causes long-term detrimental effects to his mental health and well-being. </p>

<p>The second theory states that Kvothe is an unreliable narrator, and since it's well-established already that Kvothe has an unfortunate tendency to embellish his stories, it's plausible that Kvothe simply has a denner resin addiction. Consequently, he'd be personifying that addiction in Denna. Curiously, this seems to have some more support: from Kvothe's extended poverty despite wealth, to the fact that seemingly every time he loses wealth, Denna leaves him (though this is never portrayed in a cause-effect way).</p>

<p>Are there textual reasons to believe either of these theories are true? (Or, alternately, are there good reasons to disbelieve them?)</p>

For example, in his essay, <a href=""http://wilson.med.harvard.edu/nb204/AuthorityAndAmericanUsage.pdf"">Authority and American Usage</a>, he makes use of a colloquial form of writing which is often repeated in his other essays. An example of this concerns his use of footnotes - the essay has 81 of them, and sometimes even footnotes have footnotes. This makes the essay something of a wild ride to read. </p>

<p>An example more localized to Authority and American Usage is the colloquial use of titles. Though they draw an ironic point, it's very typical to see this in DFW's writing elsewhere:</p>

  I had to choose between the death penalty and imprisonment for life, I
  would certainly choose the second. To live anyhow is better than not

"Did the Strikers assume that the Strike would change other countries as well?","<p>Virtually all of the Strikers were American - it included, for example, Judge Narragansett (Illinois), Midas Mulligan (Chicago, IL), John Galt (Ohio), Ted Nielsen (Colorado), Roger Marsh (Colorado), Hank Reardon (Minnesota and Pennsylvania), Dagny Taggart (New York), among others. The two recorded exceptions were Ragnar Danneskjöld (born in Norway, and possibly living at least part of the time in Norway while he was a Pirate) and Francisco D'Anconia (who was born in Argentina and was the only person definitely recorded to have lived outside of the U.S. much of the time).</p>

<p>The Strike would presumably put an end to looting and its philosophy (implying that people who survived the Collapse would be expected to change; there's no discussion about what would happen to the people what wouldn't change). However, how would it put an end to incompetence?</p>

<p>The Valley didn't have enough of a population to supply <em>all</em> of the necessary jobs to sustain the U.S. Economy after they re-emerged.

"Was Jim Taggart's physical abuse of his wife supposed to parallel and contrast with Hank Reardon's gift of the Ruby Pendant to Dagny Taggart?","<blockquote>
  <p>[Dagny Taggart] thought of the evening last winter, when [Hank Reardon] came in, took a small package from his pocket and held it out to her, saying, ""I want you to have it."" She opened it and stared in incredulous bewilderment of a pendant made of a <strong>single pear-shaped ruby</strong> that spurted a violent fire on the white satin of the jeweler's box... <strong>[the stone looked] like a sparkling drop of blood.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>On the other hand, when Cheryl Taggart finally realized how evil her husband Jim was, she visited Dagny to discuss the matter. They emphasized their connection to each other and discussed philosophy, with Dagny calling her her ""sister... by choice"" (<em>not</em> through Jim, as emphasized by Cheryl).</p>

<p>Upon returning home, she discovered the fact that Jim had just had an affair with Hank Reardon's wife. She confronted him on that as well as his ""overall"" evil, demanding to know why he had married her in the first place. At the end of their confrontation, she concluded that</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""You... you're a killer... for the sake of killing...""<br>
  It was too close to the unnamed; shaking with terror, [Jim] swung out blindly and struck her in the face.</p>
  
  <p>She fell against the side of an armchair, her head striking the floor, but she raised her head in a moment and looked up at him blankly, without astonishment, as if physical reality were merely taking the form she had expected. <strong>A single pear-shaped drop of blood went slithering slowly from the corner of her mouth.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the second scene, Jim's evil is on full display, ultimately expressing itself in physical abuse of his wife. This is an expression of the basic violence and destructiveness of his philosophy as well as of his personal evil.</p>

<p>In the former scene, Hank Reardon gives Dagny a gift simply for the pleasure of seeing her wear the pendant. It's a reflection of his love of life and the depth of their feelings of each other. It is reflected shortly thereafter in a physical expression of that (in contrast with the second scene, where this is the result of a physical expression of Jim's evil and his feelings of contempt for his wife).</p>

"Under Ayn Rand's philosophy, would the Strikers have the right to use and/or re-open abandoned factories and equipment?","<p>When the Strikers re-emerged, there would've been numerous abandoned factories and equipment (including, presumably, factories and equipment that had been abandoned by the Strikers themselves). While the original owners may have been around in some cases, in many other cases there wouldn't be any clear ownership of these factories (e.g. if the owners were dead). If some of them were in at least somewhat salvageable condition, would the Strikers be able to rightfully use them?</p>

<p>While the book doesn't directly answer this, how would someone gain the rights to the property in the first place?</p>

<p>Economist and political philosopher Murray Rothbard (who was <em>not</em> associated with Ayn Rand), for example, argued that property rights (e.g. to the rights to land ownership in a previously-undiscovered area) ""originally"" derived from being able to make productive use of it.</p>

<p>Does Ayn Rand have some kind of view of how property rights could ""originate"" in the first place? Is it similar to Rothbard's or different?</p>

<p>The most direct hint to this in the book is when Dagny and Hank visited the 20th Century Motor Factory, seeing if anything was salvageable from it. (They discover the prototype of John Galt's motor along with a partial manual related to it, which they promptly take with them; Dagny promptly goes through considerable trouble to try to find the original inventor and, when she failed to find John Galt, hired Quintin Daniels to try to reverse engineer it).</p>

<p>You <em>could</em> argue that this was meant to be descriptive rather than prescriptive (i.e. the fact that the book records that Dagny and Hank did that doesn't necessarily mean that Ayn Rand thought that they were doing the right thing), but <em>is</em> this an implicit endorsement of a view that's analogous to Murray Rothbard's? Was the fact that they were able to at least try to put it to productive use and the fact that there was no longer any clear ownership in the company a basis for them to claim at least some kind of a property right over it?</p>
"
"Did John Galt remove part of the manual for his engine from the 20th Century Motor Company?","<p>When Hank Reardon and Dagny Taggart searched the abandoned 20th Century Motor Company, they found the prototype of John Galt's motor along with some documents describing it. However, the documents related to it were incomplete, missing what Robert Standler and some other characters described as the most important parts (e.g. John Galt's definition of energy and some other basic facts).</p>

<p>John Galt later told Dagny that he left the prototype there because it was their rightful property, given that they had paid him to develop it. He also wasn't too concerned that they'd actually use it.</p>

<p>What about the manual? It seems odd that a lot of the manual was there, but it was only missing the most important parts. For example, if someone used the missing pages as fuel for a fire or something like that (like a lot of the other paper in the plant was), wouldn't they have just burned the whole thing? Why bother using only a few pages? Did John Galt (or William Hastings, John Galt's boss who later joined the Strike) remove the most important pieces? If so, why didn't they regard the manual as the new owners' property, too? If they didn't remove it, why did John Galt and William Hastings risk someone reading the documents and learning the secret of the motor?</p>

"Why wasn't Ellis Wyatt researching new applications of oil (or at least diversifying his product line)?","<p>When Dagny crashes in Galt's Gulch, we learn that Ellis Wyatt has been experimenting with new ways of producing oil.</p>

<p>However, there's no textual evidence that he was researching new <em>applications</em> of oil (unlike Hank Rearden, who actively researches new applications for his metal).</p>

<p>Here's the problem: the main applications of oil are engines of various kind (diesel engines, airplane engines, car motors). John Galt's motor obsoleted oil-burning engines; there's absolutely no reason that you'd ever develop anything but an electric motor. The fact that John developed the prototypes of the motor while he was at the 20th Century Motor Company, it seems likely that it was likely originally <em>intended</em> for use as part of car engines. Dagny pointed out that it could be used to replace a lot of other existing motors, too, such as engines for trains.</p>

<p>Also, the existence of Rearden Metal would drastically reduced energy consumption anyway because it was so much lighter than steel. For example, Hank Rearden told Dagny that he wanted to eventually make planes out of his metal.</p>

<p>I suppose that oil is also used in plastic manufacturing, <a href=""https://www.eia.gov/tool/faqs/faq.php?id=34&amp;t=6"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">it's currently not the primary source of raw material for plastic making in the U.S.</a>. According to the linked article,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Although crude oil is a source of raw material (feedstock) for making plastics, it is not the major source of feedstock for plastics production in the United States. Plastics are produced from natural gas, feedstocks derived from natural gas processing, and feedstocks derived from crude oil refining. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) is unable to determine the specific amounts or origin of the feedstocks that are actually used to manufacture plastics in the United States.</p>
  
  <p>Petrochemical feedstock naphtha and other oils refined from crude oil are used as feedstock for petrochemical crackers that produce the basic building blocks for making plastics. EIA data can only identify those oil-derived feedstocks specifically designated as petrochemical feedstock by petroleum refineries in EIA’s refining surveys, which break out into Naphtha For Petrochemical Feedstock Use and Other Oils For Petrochemical Feedstock Use. However, the petrochemical industry also consumes large quantities of hydrocarbon gas liquids (HGL), which may be produced by petroleum refineries or natural gas processing plants.</p>
  
  <p>In 2016, most of the HGL produced in the United States (85%) were byproducts of natural gas processing, and the remaining 15% were from crude oil refineries.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Point being oil production isn't even the main source of raw material for plastic anymore. (I have no idea if this was the case at the time that the book was written, though, or the extent to which it's true in other countries).</p>

<p>According to <a href=""http://alaska.conocophillips.com/what-we-do/oil-production/what-is-oil-used-for/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this list</a>, oil is used in some quantity in a number of everyday household items (even things like, for example, toothpaste and deodorant). However, I doubt that any of these applications come anywhere near the amount of oil that's consumed for cars, airplanes, certain types of energy production, etc.</p>

<p>That being the case, it seems like the majority of the use of oil would be for legacy purposes (e.g. cars, airplanes, etc. that hadn't been retrofitted with non-oil-based motors yet). Even in some of these, the amount of oil consumed would be reduced over time. For example, if they started manufacturing boxcars out of Reardon Metal, the overall weight of freight trains would've been reduced, which would've reduced the need for oil (even if Taggart Transcontinental was still using Diesel engines). In other words, the largest application of his product was becoming obsolete.</p>

<p>Why wasn't Ellis Wyatt doing more about the fact that the largest application of his only product was becoming obsolete?</p>

  She was at the door when he sighed and said, ""I hope he's still alive."" She stopped. ""I hope they haven't done anything rash.""<br>
  A moment passed before she was able to ask, ""Who?"" and to make it a word, not a scream.<br>
  He shrugged, spreading his arms and letting them drop helplessly. ""I can't hold my own boys in line any longer. I can't tell what they might attempt to do. There's one clique - the Ferris-Lawson-Meigs faction - that's been after me for over a year to adopt stronger measures. A tougher policy, they mean. Frankly, what they mean is: to resort to terror. Introduce the death penalty  for civilian crimes, for critics, dissenters, and the like. Their argument is that since people won't co-operate, won't act for the public interest voluntarily, we've got to force them to. Nothing will make our system work, they say, but terror.... We're trying to keep the Ferris boys in check, but... you see, they're set against any surrender to John Galt. They don't want to deal with him. They don't want us to find him. I wouldn't put anything past them. If they found him first, they'd - there's no telling what they might do... That's what worries me. Why doesn't he answer? Why hasn't he answered us at all?

Is he <em>actually</em> worried that they'd killed him? Or is this a veiled threat (i.e. ""either cooperate or I'll let the dogs off the leash"")?

<blockquote>
  <p>Do you not remember - for I, who see all things, discerned last night the phantasmal vision of Lineland written upon your brain - do you not remember, I say, how, when you entered the realm of Lineland, you were compelled to manifest yourself to the King, not as a Square, but as a Line, because that Linear Realm had not Dimensions enough to represent the whole of you, but only a slice or section of you? In precisely the same way, your country of Two Dimensions is not spacious enough to represent me, a being of Three, but can only exhibit a slice or section of me, which is what you call a Circle. (From Chapter 16, ""How the Stranger vainly endeavoured to reveal to me in words the mysteries of Spaceland"")</p>

"Short story in Russian about time travel and changing the history of WW2","<p>I remember when I was child (probably about 40 years ago), I read some story in a Russian book (I think original was Russian, not translated).</p>

<p>Story is the following: a man read some documentary book about WW2, but it isn't the same WW2, which we know, other events, other names, other Nazi leader (not Hitler).</p>

<p>And he think that if he could go to this time and kill this leader, we can save lot of lives. Then he fell asleep and transferred to this time. He managed to meet this leader and kill him.</p>

<p>Then we woke up at home, take this book and see that events changed, WW2 now is the same as we know and the Nazi leader was Hitler.</p>

<p>I'd like to find this story, so it's probably around 70th and in Russian language.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: What else I remember: it was in  a book, containing science fiction stories by different authors (for example I remember another story, where a man could use electricity instead of food and became very strong). This story (which I'm looking for) is short (2-3 pages).</p>

<p>To kill the Nazi leader (before they took power) the man came to one meeting and after the meeting asked the leader for a private conversation and strangled him.</p>

<p>Other detail: when he was in an old German (or maybe Austrian) city, he hired some man with a mustache to help with his luggage and by mistake gave him a very big banknote (because was not familiar with local currency). This mustache man took the money and disappeared very fast.</p>

"How should we view Dan Conway?","<p>Dan Conway, head of the Phoenix-Durango in <em>Atlas Shrugged</em>, was evidently a superb executive. He also receives (largely) positive treatment in the novel. However, the book also says that he initially went along with the industry group behind the anti-dog-eat-dog rule, and the novel gives several other indications that the author's not trying to present him as being 100% positive.</p>

<p>First, is there any significance to the fact that his railroad wasn't named after him? The ""good"" characters all named their companies after themselves (Wyatt Oil, Rearden Steel, Taggart Transcontinental, etc.) and the ""bad"" characters' companies had generic-sounding names (Associated Steel, Amalgamated Switch and Signal, etc.), so is the generic-sounding name evidence that we're supposed to have a negative view of Dan Conway - that he represents people who just ""caved"" morally?</p>

<p>Secondly, he definitely never joined the strikers (he wasn't in Galt's Gulch when Dagney was shown around, and Eddie is able to track him down towards the end of the novel), and there's no evidence either way about whether John Galt ever approached him (in fact, he seems to have quit on his own without any of the strikers having met with him).</p>

<p>That being said, why didn't Dan Conway ever join the strike? Why didn't the novel say whether he was asked to join? <em>Would</em> John Galt have been likely to have asked him to join? (It seems like an odd omission given that Dagney asked him to stay and fight and Eddie tracked him down to ask him to help Taggart Transcontinental).</p>

<p><strong>How does Ayn Rand want us to view this character?</strong> Is he basically a good person who ""caved"" under pressure from the looters?</p>

Some of them are widely joked about (Bert and Ernie, Peter Pan), but two characters on the list were deeply mystifying: Old Yeller, and Edmund Pevensie from the <em>Chronicles of Narnia</em> series.</p>

<p>Granted, it's been a long time since I read the Narnia books, but I did read them again as an adult, and I can't remember a single thing that would suggest Edmund is gay, particularly if we confine ourselves the <em>The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe</em> as the list does. I can't recall any of the four Pevensie children having any kind of sexuality at all, except for some intimations about Susan in <em>The Horse and His Boy</em> and <em>The Last Battle</em>, so it seems to me we could as well say that Peter was gay and Lucy was a lesbian.</p>

<p>I very much doubt Lewis, as a Christian philosopher in the 1950's, would have written a gay character intentionally, but is there any way to interpret the text that would suggest Edmund is gay? Conversely, is there a way to interpret the text that suggests he's not gay?</p>

"Should Go Set a Watchman change our view of Atticus defending Tom Robinson?","<p>I do realize that the passage of <em>To Kill a Mockingbird</em> where Atticus defended Tom Robinson has been heavily analyzed elsewhere at this point. However, it seems like most people got the impression that Atticus's choice to give Tom Robinson a competent defense reflected a progressive view of race on his part (I certainly got that impression from studying that in lit class). This is obviously why <em>Go Set a Watchman</em>'s portrayal of him was so controversial.</p>

<p>With that said, do we necessarily need to change our analysis of that passage based on the later book? How do you reconcile those two?</p>

<p>Given the complicated publication history behind <em>Watchman</em> (the fact that Harper Lee seems to have forgotten about it, the lack of clarity about when she decided to publish it, and the fact that <em>Watchman</em> was written before <em>Mockingbird</em>), is Harper Lee essentially flatly contradicting herself here? How did Harper Lee view Atticus at various points? For example, when she published <em>Mockingbird</em>, had she already forgotten about <em>Watchman</em> (and/or believed that she would never publish it) and therefore changed her view of Atticus? </p>

<p>There's a strongly related question about how much ""authority"" authors have to change an existing ""canon"" after the fact (particularly long after the fact), but that should be a separate question at a minimum and may or may not be the best fit for Stack Exchange.</p>

<p>Is there some particular reason?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Before reading the comments and responses I was not aware that the use of quotation dash was common in other languages. My purpose for asking the question was, as someone guessed, to find out whether Joyce aimed to achieve some theatrical effect or maybe introduce purposeful ambiguity by choosing the dash over the quotation mark. Or did he want to use the device that is common to plays - and if so did he explicitly ever mention why they are preferable to him?</p>

I think the settlers were Dutch or German. </p>

<p>There was one bit I remember vividly: upon arrival, they were taken in by a family, and saw something like a coal scuttle. When one of them asked what it was, the neighbor laughed and said something to the effect of ""Well, if you're living with <em>this</em> family, no wonder! A coal scuttle is for carrying live coals from one house to another when your fire goes out, and Mrs. [Name] has never let that happen! Her fire has burned for years!"" Later in the book, the family has rushed out for some emergency and forgotten to bank the fire. They run back, the woman feeds and fusses over the fire, and finally finds one coal poking out like a glowing eye: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>She sat back on her heels. ""X years,"" she said proudly, ""and still it burns!""</p>

<p>There were a few monochrome illustrations — maybe in brown? — and the one I remember is just after the two have transported back to the present.

"Story-ID Teenager in orphanage or prison","<p>I am looking for a story that was part of a Reader's Digest anthology.
I read in the very early 1990s as a German translation, but I am pretty sure, the story is from the USA (and was probably written in the 1980s).</p>

<p>I remember neither title nor author of the story, but this is a synopsis:</p>

<p>The story is probably set in the 1970s-1980s.</p>

<p>Main actor is Mat[t]hew (?) McFadden, a teenager around 15-16 years old.
He grew up on a farm (probably in Wyoming/Montana/Idaho), but lost his parents.
The first days after his loss, he stays with an aunt and uncle.
He also tried to commit suicide with a rope, but fails.
Somehow he ends up in a prison cell, where he learns, that his uncle and aunt do not want to / can not care for him on the long term.
Thus, he is sent to an orphanage (or a Juvenile Detention Center?).</p>

<p>During his time there he makes 3 close friends: </p>

<ul>
<li>The first is in his age.</li>
<li>The second is also around that age, but has hearing problems that were diagnosed loo late. Due to this problems, his family thought he was mentally challenged and he did not get proper treatment and education. He is a physically strong and friendly, good-natured person.</li>
<li>The third is younger, around 10. Grew up in a bad neighbourhood in a big city(?). He is clever, funny, and becomes the best friend of the ""second guy"". I think he also had fun learning sign language from his friend - I remember the sign for <em>snow</em> played a role.</li>
</ul>

<p>There is also a bad guy (red haired?), a criminal and leader of a group of bullies, some ignorant watchmen and a female teacher who recognises the kid's true potential.</p>

<p>The conflict between the ""good"" and the ""bad"" kids escalates and Matthew fights with the bully-leader. This fight was described rather detailed, I remember lost teeth and blood. 
He wins this fight (strong farm boy), but the revenge would be fatal. 
To save him, the teacher helps him to escape from the orphanage, brings him to an isolated farm where he can make a living.
One by one, his friends come to this farm as well (either escape the orphanage or are old enough to be released).
These last parts after his escape were less detailed, rather an epilogue.</p>

<p>Does anyone have an idea about the title/author or how to find it?</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>
It is not <em>Holes</em> by Louis Sachar. Comparing the two, I would say, the story I am looking for is more dramatic. The story focuses on the things that went wrong in the kid's previous life and the things that are wrong in this orphanage (<em>e.g.</em> like the ignorant watchmen). </p>

  <p>  The fact is not that officials do uniquely badly but that they are 
  uniquely vulnerable. Making fun of them has always been one of 
  the diversions of the British public. The fun sometimes has a touch 
  of malice in it, but the habit springs from qualities in the British 
  character that no one would like to see atrophied. The field for its 
  exercise and the temptation to indulge in it are constantly growing. 
  <em>De facto</em> executive power, which during the seventeenth and eighteenth 
  centuries moved from the King to Ministers, is being diffused lower 
  still by the growth of social legislation. The theory that every act of 
  every official is the act of his Minister is wearing thin.

  light that beats upon a throne and blackens every blot” is no longer 
  focused on the apex; it shines on the whole pyramid.</strong> So many 
  people have to read so many official instructions. These offer a 
  bigger target for possible criticism than any other class of writing 
  except journalism, and they are more likely to get it than any other 
  class, because a reader’s critical faculty is sharpened by being told — 
  as we all so often have to be nowadays — that he cannot do something 
  he wants to, or must do something he does not want to, or that he 
  can only do something he wants to by going through a lot of tiresome

<blockquote>
  <p>Deconstruction and a focus on the materiality of writing have also been 
  important for Henry Louis Gates Jr.'s theories of Signifyin(g) (see 
  Chapter 14). In fact, Derrida's own writing often Signifies on the 
  subjects he is addressing—which is one reason many people find 
  Derrida's writing rather difficult. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Are there examples where Derrida's Signifying makes something readable unreadable? </p>

<p><a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/14/books/playing-not-joking-with-language.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Rhodes Scholar John Wideman explains Signifying</a> in 1988:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>IF you look up ''signifying'' in a dictionary, you'll find a set of definitions. If you hear the word used by a black person, chances are you'll need something more than a dictionary to understand what the speaker means. The word ''signifying'' is situated where Henry Louis Gates Jr. in his new book situates the critic of comparative black literature, ''at a sort of crossroads, a discursive crossroads at which two languages meet, be these languages Yoruba and English, or Spanish and French, or even (perhaps especially) the black vernacular and standard English.''</p>
  
  <p>To identify the concept of signifying drawn from Afro-American oral tradition and signal its difference from, as well as convergence with, another universe of discourse, Mr. Gates employs a capital letter to distinguish black usage: Signifying. Since this seemingly innocent naming - assigning upper case to black, lower case to white - also implies hierarchy and pecking order, it is itself an example of Signifying. Signifying is verbal play - serious play that serves as instruction, entertainment, mental exercise, preparation for interacting with friend and foe in the social arena. In black vernacular, Signifying is a sign that words cannot be trusted, that even the most literal utterance allows room for interpretation, that language is both carnival and minefield.</p>

"Is the beginning of ""Their Eyes Were Watching God"" drawing a comparison of men and women?","<p>The beginning of <em>Their Eyes Were Watching God</em> goes like this:</p>

  away in resignation, his dreams mocked to death by Time. That is

<p>My other linked question asks how this fits into common definition of literature. However, I'd like to ask a more specific question here: someone else pointed out that this kind of text really can't be analyzed from an authorial intent perspective because there's no intent behind the text whatever (see, for example, the <a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_room"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Chinese Room argument</a> - it obviously makes no sense to try to claim that the computer was trying to communicate something specific). How would advocates of authorial intent theories of meaning respond to this? Do their definitions of literature usually explicitly require some kind of conscious intent on the author's part for something to even be considered literature in the first place? In other words, from their perspective, would they say ""that's not really literature"" or even ""that fundamentally doesn't even have any meaning at all""?</p>

<p>I suppose that a third possible response would be that the method of construction means that, in some sense, the programmer was the real author.</p>

<li><p>What does yawn of appetite mean?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Would you please paraphrase/rephrase these sentences and explain their relevance?</p>

<p>From Chapter 1, ""Found Objects"", of Jennifer Egan's <em>A Visit From the Goon Squad</em> (emphasis added):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It began the usual way, in the bathroom of the Lassimo Hotel. Sasha was adjusting her yellow eye shadow in the mirror when she noticed a bag on the floor beside the sink that must have belonged to the woman whose peeing she could faintly hear through <strong>the vaultlike door of a toilet stall</strong>. Inside the rim of the bag, barely visible, was a wallet made of pale green leather. It was easy for Sasha to recognize, looking back, that the peeing woman's blind trust had provoked her: We live in a city where people will steal the hair off your head if you give them half a chance, but you leave your stuff lying in plain sight and expect it to be waiting for you when you come back? It made her want to teach the woman a lesson. But this wish only camouflaged the deeper feeling Sasha always had: that at, tender wallet, offering itself to her hand-it seemed so dull, so life-as-usual to just leave it there rather than seize the moment, accept the challenge, take the leap, fly the coop, throw caution to the wind, live dangerously (""I get it,"" Coz, her therapist, said), and take the fucking thing.</p>
  
  <p>[...]</p>
  
  <p>Sasha sighed. She'd told Coz the plumber story about a month ago, and he'd found a way to bring it up at almost every session since. The plumber was an old man, sent by Sasha's landlord to investigate a leak in the apartment below hers. He'd appeared in Sasha's doorway, tufts of gray on his head, and within a minute-boom-he'd hit the floor and crawled under her bathtub like an animal fumbling its way into a familiar hole. The fingers he'd groped toward the bolts behind the tub were grimed to cigar stubs, and reaching made his sweatshirt hike up, exposing a soft white back. Sasha turned away, stricken by the old man's abasement, anxious to leave for her temp job, except that the plumber was talking to her, asking about the length and frequency of her showers. ""I never use it,"" she told him curtly. ""I shower at the gym."" He nodded without acknowledging her rudeness, apparently used to it. Sasha's nose began to prickle; she shut her eyes and pushed hard on both temples.</p>
  
  <p>Opening her eyes, she saw the plumber's tool belt lying on the floor at her feet. It had a beautiful screwdriver in it, the orange translucent handle gleaming like a lollipop in its worn leather loop, the silvery shaft sculpted, sparkling. <strong>Sasha felt herself contract around the object in a single yawn of appetite</strong>; she needed to hold the screwdriver, just for a minute. She bent her knees and plucked it noiselessly from the belt</p>

"How did the story of Robin Hood pass from oral literature to written?","<p>Robin Hood is a famous figure of English folklore, whose existence or fictionality is still a subject of debate. The stories about him started off as folk tales transmitted orally (ballads), but by now of course there are many written stories about him. I'm curious about the history of the transition of Robin Hood tales from oral to written form, and I've phrased my title a little vaguely because I think there are several interconnected subquestions here:</p>

<ul>
<li>Roughly when were Robin Hood stories first written down?</li>
<li>What is the oldest <em>surviving</em> written Robin Hood story?</li>
<li>Is there one particularly important early written text which influenced many of the later/modern versions of the story? (Cf. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Morte_d%27Arthur"" rel=""noreferrer"">Malory's <em>Morte d'Arthur</em></a> for Arthurian legend.)</li>

<blockquote>
  <p>It was about this English guy, Alec something, that was in the war and loses his memory in the hospital and all. He comes out of the hospital carrying a cane and limping all over the place, all over London, not knowing who the hell he is. He's really a duke, but he doesn't know it. Then he meets this nice, homey, sincere girl getting on a bus. Her goddam hat blows off and he catches it, and then they go upstairs and sit down and start talking about Charles Dickens. He's both their favorite author and all. He's carrying this copy of Oliver Twist and so's she. I could've puked. Anyway, they fell in love right away, on account of they're both so nuts about Charles Dickens and all, and he helps her run her publishing business. She's a publisher, the girl. Only, she's not doing so hot, because her brother's a drunkard and he spends all their dough. He's a very bitter guy, the brother, because he was a doctor in the war and now he can't operate any more because his nerves are shot, so he boozes all the time, but he's pretty witty and all. Anyway, old Alec writes a book, and this girl publishes it, and they both make a hatful of dough on it. They're all set to get married when this other girl, old Marcia, shows up. Marcia was Alec's fiancée before he lost his memory, and she recognizes him when he's in this store autographing books. She tells old Alec he's really a duke and all, but he doesn't believe her and doesn't want to go with her to visit his mother and all. His mother's blind as a bat. But the other girl, the homey one, makes him go. She's very noble and all. So he goes. But he still doesn't get his memory back, even when his great Dane jumps all over him and his mother sticks her fingers all over his face and brings him this teddy bear he used to slobber around with when he was a kid. But then, one day, some kids are playing cricket on the lawn and he gets smacked in the head with a cricket ball. Then right away he gets his goddam memory back and he goes in and 
  kisses his mother on the forehead and all. Then he starts being a regular duke again, and he forgets all about the homey babe that has the publishing business. I'd tell you the rest of the story, but I might puke if I did. It isn't that I'd spoil it for you or anything. There isn't anything to spoil for Chrissake. Anyway, it ends up with Alec and the homey babe getting married, and the brother that's a drunkard gets his nerves back and operates on Alec's mother so she can see again, and then the drunken brother and old Marcia go for each other. It ends up with everybody at this long dinner table laughing their asses off because the great Dane comes in with a bunch of puppies. Everybody thought it was a male, I suppose, or some goddam thing.<br>

"Can the apparent age discrepancies in The Count of Monte Cristo be reconciled?","<p>(Note: all emphases in quoted passages below are mine.)</p>

<hr>

<p>Continuing the theme of <a href=""https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/9503/can-the-count-of-monte-cristos-calculation-of-poison-dosage-be-explained"">confusing mathematics in <em>The Count of Monte Cristo</em></a>, here is another example that stymies me:</p>

<p>When Edmond Dantès is first described in <a href=""https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1184/1184-h/1184-h.htm#linkC2HCH0001"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Chapter One</a>, right when the story begins, his age is given as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>He was a fine, tall, slim young <strong>fellow of eighteen or twenty</strong>, with black eyes, and hair as dark as a raven’s wing; and his whole appearance bespoke that calmness and resolution peculiar to men accustomed from their cradle to contend with danger.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here he is estimated to be 18-20 years old. In <a href=""https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1184/1184-h/1184-h.htm#linkC2HCH0002"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Chapter Two</a> (which is the same day) he himself confirms that he is 20 years old:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“God forgive me,” said the young man, “for rejoicing at happiness derived from the misery of others, but, Heaven knows, I did not seek this good fortune; it has happened, and I really cannot pretend to lament it. The good Captain Leclere is dead, father, and it is probable that, with the aid of M. Morrel, I shall have his place. Do you understand, father? Only imagine <strong>me a captain at twenty</strong>, with a hundred louis pay, and a share in the profits! Is this not more than a poor sailor like me could have hoped for?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At the end of Chapter Two, Mercédès (Edmond's bride) is described as being 17 years old, and her cousin (Fernand) as being 21 years old:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Well, every time I have seen Mercédès come into the city she has been accompanied by a tall, strapping, black-eyed Catalan, with a red complexion, brown skin, and fierce air, whom she calls cousin.”</p>
  
  <p>“Really; and you think this cousin pays her attentions?”</p>
  
  <p>“I only suppose so. What else can a strapping <strong>chap of twenty-one</strong> mean with a fine <strong>wench of seventeen</strong>?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thus, at this point we have established that Fernand is about a year older than Edmond, who in turn is about three years older than Mercédès.</p>

<p>Fast-forward about forty chapters, and Mercédès is now married to Fernand (Count de Morcerf) and is the mother of Albert, while Edmond has become the Count of Monte Cristo.</p>

<p>In <a href=""https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1184/1184-h/1184-h.htm#linkC2HCH0041"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Chapter Forty-One</a> Edmond visits the de Morcerf house and sees a portrait of Mercédès:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It was the portrait of <strong>a young woman of five or six-and-twenty</strong>, with a dark complexion, and light and lustrous eyes, veiled beneath long lashes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Albert then explains that the portrait is his mother, taken 6-8 years ago:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Ah, monsieur,” returned Albert, “I would never forgive you this mistake if you had seen another picture beside this. You do not know my mother; she it is whom you see here. <strong>She had her portrait painted thus six or eight years ago.</strong> This costume is a fancy one, it appears, and the resemblance is so great that I think I still see my mother the same as she was in 1830. The countess had this portrait painted during the count’s absence. She doubtless intended giving him an agreeable surprise; but, strange to say, this portrait seemed to displease my father, and the value of the picture, which is, as you see, one of the best works of Léopold Robert, could not overcome his dislike to it. It is true, between ourselves, that M. de Morcerf is one of the most assiduous peers at the Luxembourg, a general renowned for theory, but a most mediocre amateur of art. It is different with my mother, who paints exceedingly well, and who, unwilling to part with so valuable a picture, gave it to me to put here, where it would be less likely to displease M. de Morcerf, whose portrait, by Gros, I will also show you. Excuse my talking of family matters, but as I shall have the honor of introducing you to the count, I tell you this to prevent you making any allusions to this picture. The picture seems to have a malign influence, for my mother rarely comes here without looking at it, and still more rarely does she look at it without weeping. This disagreement is the only one that has ever taken place between the count and countess, who are still as much united, <strong>although married more than twenty years</strong>, as on the first day of their wedding.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thus, at this point Mercédès would have to be 31-34 years old (25 + 6 = 31; 26 + 8 = 34), which would mean (as per the above evidence) that Edmond would be about 34-37 years old and Fernand would be about 35-38 years old. However, at the end of the paragraph just cited, Albert clearly states that his parents have been married for more than 20 years. That would mean that they got married when Mercédès was (at most) younger than 14 years old, Edmond (at most) younger than 17 years old, and Fernand (at most) younger than 18 years old. Yet that would mean that they were married even before the book began! This, of course, cannot be, as when the book began Mercédès was still betrothed to Edmond, and she only married Fernand well after Edmond had been imprisoned. According to Caderousse in <a href=""https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1184/1184-h/1184-h.htm#linkC2HCH0027"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Chapter Twenty-Seven</a> it was a full eighteen months later:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Mercédès begged for six months more in which to await and mourn for Edmond.”</p>
  
  <p>“So that,” said the abbé, with a bitter smile, “<strong>that makes eighteen months in all</strong>. What more could the most devoted lover desire?” Then he murmured the words of the English poet, “‘Frailty, thy name is woman.’”</p>
  
  <p>“Six months afterwards,” continued Caderousse, “the marriage took place in the church of Accoules.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To compound matters further, returning to Chapter Forty-One, Edmond meets Fernand who is described as being 40-45 years old: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Monte Cristo was engaged in examining this portrait with no less care than he had bestowed upon the other, when another door opened, and he found himself opposite to the Count of Morcerf in person.</p>
  
  <p>He was <strong>a man of forty to forty-five years</strong>, but he seemed at least fifty, and his black moustache and eyebrows contrasted strangely with his almost white hair, which was cut short, in the military fashion. He was dressed in plain clothes, and wore at his button-hole the ribbons of the different orders to which he belonged.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is problematic because it makes Fernand 6-14 years older than Mercédès (instead of four years older as indicated from the beginning of the book). It also doesn't fit with how Edmond's own age is described by Albert immediately thereafter:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“And what do you suppose is the count’s age?” inquired Mercédès, evidently attaching great importance to this question.</p>
  
  <p><strong>“Thirty-five or thirty-six, mother.”</strong></p>
  
  <p>“So young, — it is impossible,” said Mercédès, replying at the same time to what Albert said as well as to her own private reflection.</p>
  
  <p>“It is the truth, however. Three or four times he has said to me, and certainly without the slightest premeditation, ‘at such a period I was five years old, at another ten years old, at another twelve,’ and I, induced by curiosity, which kept me alive to these details, have compared the dates, and never found him inaccurate. <strong>The age of this singular man, who is of no age, is then, I am certain, thirty-five.</strong> Besides, mother, remark how vivid his eye, how raven-black his hair, and his brow, though so pale, is free from wrinkles,—he is not only vigorous, but also young.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Edmond being 35-36 would be consistent with Mercédès being 31-34 as was indicated by the portrait, but it is not definitely not consistent with Fernand being 40-45 years old. Furthermore, when Mercédès says “So young, — it is impossible,” she seems to be trying to refute a potential suspicion that the Count of Monte Cristo is actually Edmond, by saying that Edmond couldn't possibly be that young.</p>

<p>What is going on here? How can we make sense of the age discrepancies described above? Have I miscalculated, or misinterpreted any important details? Is this just a mistake?</p>

  &hellip; <br>
  Of the faithfulness of his rendering those acquainted with the French language will easily judge, as they can have under the same cover the English of the translator and the French of the dramatist, and they will thus, it is hoped, acquire a clear and adequate conception of the beautiful picture, which, thanks to Edmond Rostand, has restored the life and brilliancy to the somewhat faded features of that eccentric philosopher, poet, hero and gentlemen, Savinien Hercule de Cyrano Bergerac. <br><br>
  Adolphe Cohn</p>

<p>Now, he says here that, in order to have a good translation, the translator must be proficient in both the source and target languages, along with an understanding and familiarity of the setting, etc. of the source play.</p>

<p>However, these are some general translation tips, and while I think it does help to ensure a more correct play, I wonder what has been lost in, for example, the translation from English to French.

<p>Some other works that come to mind would be Dante's <em>La Commedia Divina</em> (Divine Comedy; Italian to English), many early philosophical works (e.g. those of Plato and Aristotle), and generally any early work of literature.</p>

<p>If he wanted to comment on the battle of Waterloo, why not separately write an essay on the battle and save me an hour of time when I'm trying to read Les Mis?</p>

"Was Isidora's fate in Melmoth the Wanderer directly inspired by Faust?","<p>When reading Charles Robert Maturin's <em>Melmoth the Wanderer</em> I couldn't help but notice that <strong>Isidora's fate largely resembled Gretchen's</strong> in Goethe's <em>Faust</em> and especially the endings of both storylines are largely similar.</p>

<p>Apart from the obvious connection of Melmoth's tale being a Faustian tale itself and from their nature as innocent girls seduced by the protagonist, the parallels between Isidora and Gretchen are quite direct. Both ultimately conceive an illegitimate child from him and end up in the dungeon for their involvement with Melmoth/Faust, losing their child (although Isidora's part in the child's death is less direct, or at least more ambiguous). Both are visited in their cell and tempted a final time by their respective lovers to join them in freedom, but ultimately choose heavenly redemption instead. This scene itself struck me as quite a resemblance beyond just the obvious similarities of Melmoth and Faust making deals with the devil.</p>

<p>So I wonder <strong>if that part in <em>Melmoth the Wanderer</em> took a direct inspiration from or is even a reference to Goethe's <em>Faust</em> in particular</strong>, or if it is actually relying on older and more general elements of the Faustian legend that Goethe also took inspiration from, or if it is just a downright coincidence altogether. Is there any more information on this? Has the author maybe commented on it or has someone already done a more extensive analyisis of the evolution of the stories? Or am I maybe missing other elements that substantiate the connection even clearer (or refute it altogether)?</p>

"Was there a deliberate parallel between the Thénardiers and Gollum?","<p>Long ago, I noticed that there was a parallel between <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> and <em>Les Misérables</em> in the characters of the Thénardiers and Gollum.</p>

<ol>
<li>Gollum has the One Ring at the start of the tale in <em>The Hobbit</em>, but it wasn't his. The Thénardiers had Cosette, but, of course, she wasn't theirs. The One Ring was taken from Gollum, and Cosette was taken from the Thénardiers.</li>
<li>Gollum pretended to help Sam and Frodo, while really intending to betray them. Éponine pretends to help Marius, while intending to have him die. Monsier Thénardier also makes false pretences while intending to rob Valjean.</li>
<li>Finally, Gollum had a major (if unintentional) role in the final destruction of the One Ring, just as Monsieur Thénardier was the unwitting reason behind repairing the relationship between Cosette and Marius and the ailing Valjean.</li>

Later, her parents consult the oracle of Apollo at Miletus to find out whom she will marry.  The oracle's reply is that Psyche should be dressed in funeral clothes and placed on a hill to be killed by a fiery winged serpent:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Let Psyche's corpse be clad in mourning weed </p>

<p>I cannot understand this prophecy either literally or allegorically.  She does not marry a fiery winged serpent. She marries Cupid, who is winged but not fiery. It seems like a metaphorical stretch to understand him as a serpent.  He does subdue each thing, but not with fiery flight.  While it is true that mighty Jove is subject to his might, I do not know what to make of the rivers black and the rest of that part.</p>

<p>Also the clear implication of the funeral dress in the first line is that Psyche will be killed by the monster, and this is how Psyche's parents take it.  But she is not.</p>

<p>What is going on here?  Presumably Apuleius’ point is not that the oracle blew it.  What does Apuleius mean us to understand about the prophecy?</p>

"Identify a historical romance/drama where a young woman has an affair while on a beach holiday","<p>My girlfriend is trying to find a story she once read (in 2004, when the book was not new). If anyone can help me earn a few relationship-points it would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>The story is set some time near the end of the 1800s, probably in the USA. The main character is a 15-year-old female only child (possibly named Ophelia?) who has gone on a holiday to the beach with her parents (her family has at least some money, but may not have been particularly rich). The beach has (some) segregated bathing hours, since there is a scene where the girl is walking on the beach with her father during the men's bathing time (which gets questioned). While there, she has an affair with a doctor who is already married with children (who may be a family friend or otherwise known to her parents). The two are caught in the act (possibly by the man's child?), leading to the expected scandal. The doctor's marriage is effectively ended by this, although he may or may not actually get divorced immediately.</p>

<p>In the aftermath, it is discovered that the girl is pregnant. While giving birth she is given laudanum (or some form of drug) and when she comes round the baby boy has already been spirited away by her parents against her wishes. She is then sent away to boarding-school for a few years, but this is skimmed over briefly. Her relationship with her parents is effectively over, due to them stealing her baby.</p>

<p>When she leaves the school at around 18-19 she goes looking for her child, and finds him with a couple who are not native english speakers (possibly French or French-Canadian). She takes the issue to court, trying to get custody, and wins her case but chooses to leave the child with the foster parents when she sees that he is too young to understand what is happening and doesn't want to leave his home (the child hasn't been told that she is his mother). The doctor has resurfaced and is involved in the court case, since he had been the one to find the foster parents three years ago.</p>

<p>The story ends with the main character and the doctor reunited, one or both of the foster parents ill/dying, and the child clearly about to be returned to her (but the story ends before that happens).</p>

"Why did the animals in Animal Farm confess to their crimes?","<p>One of the things that I did not understand about Animal Farm is why the animals, after the hen's rebellion, simply came forward to confess their crimes.</p>

<p>Napoleon offers no incentive for coming forward. He does not threaten anything against animals that have committed a crime and do not confess, nor does he offer any inclination that he even knows who has committed any crime, other than obviously understanding that there must have been ringleaders in the hen's uprising.</p>

<p>Yet, having seen other animals executed by the dogs for committing crimes, animals continue to come forward and admit that they broke the law, and are summarily executed in front of the rest of the congregated animals.</p>

<p>Particularly the rebellion leaders coming forward first seemed particularly strange, as they must have known their punishment would be severe. They were already questioning the authority of Napoleon, so to suddenly submit to him would surely be in their worst interests?</p>

<p>There is also no hint that these were false confessions manufactured by the pigs in order to establish a firm hand against dissenters, mostly because I can't see how anyone would be encouraged to confess falsely if they had just witnessed that their punishment would be death.</p>

<p>And if the hens who did spearhead the rebellion were not the ones who confessed and were executed, then I can't imagine that the pigs would quash the rebellion effectively, it would simply strengthen the resolve of the hens who started the first rebellion.</p>

  Oh, where have you been, my darling young one?<br>
  I've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains<br>
  I've walked and I've crawled on six crooked highways<br>
  I've stepped in the middle of seven sad forests<br>
  I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans<br>
  I've been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard<br>
  And it's a hard, and it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard<br>
  And it's a hard rain's a-gonna fall</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From reading the lyrics I can't figure out if the song is meant to be sad or uplifting. On one hand, a lot of the imagery connotes death and misery, such as ""a dozen dead ocean"" and ""seven sad forests"". And end end of a verse--""a hard rain's a-gonna fall""--seems ominous, almost like a warning of a coming storm. However, the song also seems to be about the reunification of a parent and his son: the parent is asking where the son was, and the son responds with a description of his travels.</p>

<p>The final verse adds to this ambiguity. The son informs the parent that they are leaving again (""Oh, what'll you do now, my blue-eyed son? / Oh, what'll you do now, my darling young one? / I'm a-goin' back out 'fore the rain starts a-fallin'""). This could be considered as sad--they are departing--but also a good thing--the son is continuing with his travels. In addition, the son informs that they expect to drown in the rising water--sad--but that they know their song and will sing it as they drown--defiant, inspiring, and perhaps an uplifting conclusion.</p>

<p>Dylan's performances of the song only add to this ambiguity. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCGoOPM2_x0"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">In one of his latest renditions of the song, he is accompanied by an orchestra, and the music is similar to an inspiring, uplifting soundtrack that would be played at the end of a movie</a>. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ex-m-eEKsg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">In another version from 1963, Dylan is accompanied by only an acoustic guitar, and his voice has the characteristic mournful quality that I associate with his music</a>. <a href=""http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x4ur3de"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">And in a third version from his 1975 Rolling Thunder Revue, the song sounds like a bar song: mournful but funny and entertaining at the same time</a>.</p>

<p>So my question is: is the song supposed to be mournful or uplifting? What accounts for the range of interpretations of the song, both from a close reading of the lyrics, and from the various ways that Dylan has performed the song throughout his career.</p>

  ""Your loyalty to your teacher is laudable, Senor d'Anconia,"" said Dr. Pritchett dryly. ""May we take it that you are an example of the practical results of his teaching?""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Given that Dr. Pritchett said that nothing is anything, that the mind is impotent, and that there's no such thing as objective morality or knowledge, why was he critical of Francisco's lifestyle?</p>

<p>Was it similar to the reason that Jim Taggart complained about the San Sebastian Mines affair in spite of the fact that Francisco had followed their morality literally? For example, the widely-held morality held that need took precedence over actual competence in selecting job applicants; accordingly, Francisco turned the operation of the mine over to an incompetent mining specialist that needed a job rather badly.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in the book, Jim Taggart describes Dr. Pritchett's philosophy as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Have you ever heard of <em>The Metaphysical Contradictions of the Universe</em>, by Dr. Simon Pritchett?"" She shook her head, frightened. ""<strong>How do you know what's good, anyway? Who knows what's good? Who can ever know?</strong> There are no absolutes - as Dr. Pritchett has proved irrefutably. <strong>Nothing is absolute.

<p>That being the case, on what basis does Dr. Pritchett criticize Francisco?

"First English Renaissance play where women disguise as men?","<p>In several of Shakespeare's plays, women disguise as men (for a variety of reasons). For example,</p>

<ul>
<li>In <em>The Merchant of Venice</em>, Portia disguises as a lawyer; Jessica disguises as a man when eloping with her non-Jewish lover.</li>
<li>In <em>As You Like It</em>, Rosalind disguises as Ganymdede, and her friend Celia as Aliena.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Stubbs"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Philip Stubbes or Stubbs</a>, writing before the start of Shakespeare's career as a dramatist, criticised this type of crossdressing in his book <em>Anatomie of Abuses</em> (1583). So what was the first English Renaissance play that involved women disguising as men?</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong> in response to various comments:</p>

<ol>
<li>Crossdressing may have been a feature of a number of plays from classical antiquity, but this is only of limited relevance to my question. A thousand years passed between the end of classical antiquity and the beginning of the English Renaissance. The theatrical tradition had been interrupted; the most common types of plays in Medieval England were <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystery_play"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">mystery plays</a> and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morality_play"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">morality plays</a>, which were based on a Christian tradition and far removed from the ancient Greek and Roman plays.</li>
<li>Cross-dressing seems innocuous now (at least in the West), but this was not the case in Shakespeare's time. 

<ul>
<li>There were <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumptuary_law"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">sumptuary laws</a> that regulated who could wear what types of clothes or materials; several such laws from the reign of Henry VIII were re-enacted in 1565. For example, only the nobility was allowed to wear imported woollen fabrics; only those with an income of £ 100 per year were allowed to wear satin, damask, silk, camlet or tafetta. The goal of these laws was to keep the ""natural"" class distinctions intact. (Source: G. Blakemore Evans, ed.: <em>Elizabethan-Jacobean Drama: A New Mermaid Background Book</em>. 1988. Pp. 129f.) </li>
<li>Cross-dressing was frowned upon; see e.g. <a href=""https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy+22&amp;version=KJ21"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Deuteronomy 22:5</a>: ""The woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man, neither shall a man put on a woman’s garment; for all who do so are abomination unto the Lord thy God."". ""Cross-dressing"" could be as simple as women wearing <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodice"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">bodices</a> done up with buttons (buttons were very ""masculine"") or a hat; people were shocked and complained you couldn't tell the sexes apart.

<p>Jim Taggart's evil is, of course, on full display here - not only in his disgraceful physical and emotional abuse of his wife, but also in the violence and destructiveness that's central to his philosophy of life. Of course, later he <em>does</em> realize the truth about himself when he realizes - to his horror - that he wanted Dr. Ferris to kill John Galt (even though it would mean his own death).</p>

What has always intrigued me is the small but significant Charles Calthrop plot-element. This was a person in the novel whom police agencies supposed to be the real identity behind the Jackal. Wikipedia notes that</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Charles Calthrop is the name of a former small-arms salesman who was in the Dominican Republic at the time Rafael Leónidas Trujillo was shot. The SIS later heard a rumour that Calthrop has helped the partisans kill Trujillo by shooting the driver of his armoured car, causing it to crash. In the book, the British police originally think Calthrop is the Jackal's real name, until the real Calthrop shows up at the end, after the Jackal's assassination attempt was thwarted. The authorities were misled by the fact that chacal (i.e., Cha[rles] Cal[throp]) is French for ""jackal"". </p>

<p>The main Wikipedia article elaborates that</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Lebel does everything he can to discover the Jackal's identity. He first calls upon his ""old boy network"" of foreign intelligence and police contacts to inquire if they have any records of a top-class political assassin. Most of the inquiries are fruitless, but in the United Kingdom, the inquiry is eventually passed on to the Special Branch of Scotland Yard, and another veteran detective, Superintendent Bryn Thomas.</p>
  
  <p>A search through Special Branch's records turns up nothing. However, one of Thomas's subordinates suggests that if the assassin were an Englishman, but primarily operated abroad, he would most probably come to the attention of the Secret Intelligence Service. Thomas makes an informal inquiry with a friend of his on the SIS's staff, who mentions hearing a rumour from an officer stationed in the Dominican Republic at the time of President Trujillo's assassination. The rumour states that a hired assassin stopped Trujillo's car with a rifle shot, allowing a gang of partisans to finish him off. Additionally, Thomas also learns that the assassin was an Englishman, whom he is able to identify as Charles Calthrop (...) </p>
  
  <p>Checking out the name of Charles Calthrop, Thomas finds a match to a man living in London, said to be on holiday. While Thomas confirms that this Calthrop was in the Dominican Republic at the time of Trujillo's death, he does not feel it is enough to inform Lebel, until one of his junior detectives realises that the first three letters of his Christian name and surname form the French word for Jackal, Chacal (...) the Special Branch raids Calthrop's flat, finding his passport, and deduce that he must be travelling on a false one (...)</p>
  
  <p>[Epilogue] In London, the Special Branch are cleaning up Calthrop's apartment when the real Charles Calthrop storms in and demands to know what they are doing. Once it is established that Calthrop really has been on holiday in Scotland and has no connection whatsoever with the Jackal, the British are left to wonder ""If the Jackal wasn't Calthrop, then who the hell was he?""</p>

<p>In short, the name of Calthrop cropped up in a high level international enquiry about the possible real identity of the Jackal, but the police became excited about its possibilities when the person was found missing and his name parts seemed to spell out ""cha-cal"" which is French for ""jackal"". </p>

<p>Ironically the Jackal was probably unaware of the name Calthrop and never used it as an alias, as far as I can recollect. However, what was revealed as false coincidence at the very end, actually energized the search for the Jackal, and gave the police focus and hope: in particular, the discovery of Calthrop's passport in his house created the impetus to look for recently faked or stolen passports and led them to discover the Jackal's assumed identities through genuinely good detective work, which in turn helped the authorities launch a massive manhunt that put him under various forms of pressure. </p>

<p>So how important was the Charles Calthrop element in foiling the assassination?  Did the wild coincidence mean pure bad luck for the Jackal, or was the investigators'   policy of following up every possible lead (especially <a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Person_of_interest"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">persons of interest</a> who were untraceable during that crucial time window) simply an example of good and meticulous detection?</p>

  <p>According to Aristotle, in great tragedy the hero must have a fatal flaw that leads to his downfall. What Eliot failed to recognize was that Hamlet's fatal flaws were intellectualism and indecisiveness (maybe because he saw these as positive character traits). The delay in revenge has no simple, rational explanation, because it's Hamlet's fatal flaw. If there had been a good reason for him to delay his revenge, the ending wouldn't be Aristotelean tragedy but just bad luck.</p>

<p>This assumes that the theories exposed in Aristotle's <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poetics_(Aristotle)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>Poetics</em></a> were <em>somehow</em> relevant to Shakespeare's tragedies during the period in which they were written.

"Can three unstressed syllables constitute a substitute foot in Shakespeare?","<p>While trying to ascertain the accentuation of certain names in Shakespeare, by analyzing lines of verse where they occur, I encountered a couple of lines that I was tempted to scan with a substitute foot consisting of three consecutive unstressed syllables. I would not even know how to call such a foot, if foot it be, but it falls out thus in what seems to me the best way to read either line.</p>

<p>My first instance is from the first act of <em>Titus Andronicus</em> (so we are more likely talking George Peele than Shakespeare, according to what seems a prevailing view among experts): </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Behold I choose thee Tamora for my bride, (1.1.322)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My analysis of this and other verse lines where the name occurs satisfies me that <em>Tamora</em> is always accented on the first syllable, and can scan variously as /&nbsp;˘&nbsp;˘ (end of iamb with pyrrhic or anapestic substitution following), or with secondary accent as /&nbsp;˘&nbsp;/ (end of iamb plus whole iamb), or with <a href=""http://rhetoric.byu.edu/Figures/S/syncope.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">syncope</a> as <em>TAM&rsquo;ra,</em> /&nbsp;˘.</p>

<p>I scan this particular line with iambic first and fifth feet, spondaic second and third, and the mystery foot fourth, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;˘&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  /&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  /&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  ˘&nbsp;&nbsp;˘&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;˘&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;˘&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/<br>
  Behold | I choose | thee Tam | ora for | my bride,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The speaker is new emperor Saturninus, in a mode of public pronouncement, which the five consecutive stresses suit well. Given that mode, the syncope option that would reduce the fourth foot to a regular pyrrhus seems all too sloppy and unemphatic, and it is easy to fit the extra unstressed syllable in while keeping the basic five-beat pentameter rhythm intact.</p>

<p>One could also assign the word <em>for</em> to the fifth foot, making that an anapest and the fourth either a pyrrhus or (with secondary stress) an iamb; but a natural reading seems to place the fourth beat on that <em>for</em> rather than on the <em>-a.</em> </p>

<p>My second instance is <em>Coriolanus</em> 1.6.10:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The citizens of Corioles have issued,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here the city-name <em>Corioles,</em> as it is spelled in F1 here and in most instances, seems elsewhere required by the meter to be pronounced sometimes <em>kor-EYE-oh-LES</em> (&nbsp;˘&nbsp;/&nbsp;˘&nbsp;/&nbsp;) and sometimes <em>kor-YOHL-es</em> (&nbsp;˘&nbsp;/&nbsp;˘&nbsp;). For the present line, <em>KOR-ee-YOHLS</em> (&nbsp;/&nbsp;˘&nbsp;/&nbsp;) is tempting but unlikely, since the two pronunciations are already a recipe for audience confusion. My scansion suggestion here is as follows, with the foot in question second:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;˘&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;˘&nbsp;&nbsp;˘&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;˘&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;˘&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;˘&nbsp;/&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;˘&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;˘<br>
  The cit | izens of | Cori | oles | have issued,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again syncope <em>(cit&rsquo;zens)</em> offers an obvious way out of the difficulty, but seems unnecessary in the natural rhythmic reading of the line, and likely to impair audience comprehension somewhat.</p>

<p>Should such a foot (&nbsp;˘&nbsp;˘&nbsp;˘&nbsp;) be admitted to the list of possible substitutions in Shakespearean iambic pentameter? And if so, what should we call it? Tri-pyrrhic?</p>

<p>P.S.: I see already a better scansion solution for the <em>Coriolanus</em> line, with secondary accent on <em>-zens</em> and an anapestic substitution at the third foot:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;˘&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;˘&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;˘&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;˘&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;˘&nbsp;/&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;˘&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;˘<br>
  The cit | izens | of Cori | oles | have issued,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <em>Titus</em> line still stands as an example, though as noted maybe of Peele rather than of Shakespeare. I have added an English Renaissance Theater tag accordingly, though without deleting Shakespeare. I&rsquo;ll be on the lookout for further bona fide Shakespeare examples.</p>

"What led Tolstoy to depict that a person would have a change of heart after throwing themselves under a train?","<p>After having read a few different works by Tolstoy, I have come to the conclusion that his main goal is to accurately depict what goes through a person's mind in various situations.</p>

<p>One of the most vivid memories I have from reading Anna Karenina is the fact that when Anna throws herself under the train, she has an immediate change of heart (i.e. she doesn't want to die), but there's no time for her to change her decision and the train kills her.</p>

<p>That always struck me as both 1) non-obvious and 2) making a lot of sense.  And my reaction seemed to be confirmed when I read <a href=""https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2003/10/13/jumpers"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">a 2003 New Yorker article on people who attempt suicide by jumping off the Golden Gate Bridge</a> that says <em>""Survivors often regret their decision in midair, if not before.""</em>, and <em>""“I instantly realized that everything in my life that I’d thought was unfixable was totally fixable—except for having just jumped.”""</em></p>

<p>How did Tolstoy know or predict that Anna would immediately regret her decision?  Had he spoken with people who had attempted suicide?</p>

<p>Here's the relevant paragraph:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>She tried to fling herself below the wheels of the first carriage as it reached her; but the red bag which she tried to drop out of her hand delayed her, and she was too late; she missed the moment. She had to wait for the next carriage. A feeling such as she had known when about to take the first plunge in bathing came upon her, and she crossed herself. That familiar gesture brought back into her soul a whole series of girlish and childish memories, and suddenly the darkness that had covered everything for her was torn apart, and life rose up before her for an instant with all its bright past joys. But she did not take her eyes from the wheels of the second carriage. And exactly at the moment when the space between the wheels came opposite her, she dropped the red bag, and drawing her head back into her shoulders, fell on her hands under the carriage, and lightly, as though she would rise again at once, dropped on to her knees. And at the same instant she was terror-stricken at what she was doing. “Where am I? What am I doing? What for?” She tried to get up, to drop backwards; but something huge and merciless struck her on the head and rolled her on her back. “Lord, forgive me all!” she said, feeling it impossible to struggle. A peasant muttering something was working at the iron above her. And the light by which she had read the book filled with troubles, falsehoods, sorrow, and evil, flared up more brightly than ever before, lighted up for her all that had been in darkness, flickered, began to grow dim, and was quenched forever.</p>

"Whitman's idea of democracy","<p>There are two lines which disturbs me a little on <em>One's self I sing</em> from Whitman. It reads:</p>

"What was the point of the job-switching lottery?","<p>One peculiar thing about the City (in the first two parts of the novel, at least) is that everyone must switch their jobs every once in a while, the job being chosen by a machine based in the person's previous record. The punishment for refusing to change jobs or evading them is being sent to labout on the marshes (as explained by Wan who's had experience with this). As an aside, the mayor seemed to remain the mayor (<em>seemed</em> to me) while other characters changed jobs.</p>

"Meaning of ""We make the wise distinction still, soever made in vain"" in a poem by Dickinson","<p><a href=""https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/We_send_the_Wave_to_find_the_Wave_%E2%80%94"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">A poem</a> by Emily Dickinson:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We send the Wave to find the Wave—<br>
  An Errand so divine,<br>
  The Messenger enamored too,<br>
  Forgetting to return,<br>
  <strong>We make the wise distinction still</strong>,<br>
  Soever made in vain,<br>
  The sagest time to dam the sea is when the sea is gone—   </p>
</blockquote>

<p>What is the meaning of ""We make the wise distinction still""? What is ""distinction"" here? I can't grasp the basic meaning - I don't need a complex interpretation, just the basic meaning. </p>

<p>Basically, I understand it thus: </p>

<ul>
<li>We send the wave to find the wave. </li>
</ul>

<p>Okay, ""we make a wave and we are sitting and waiting till it hits another wave and returns"". </p>

<ul>
<li>An errand so divine. </li>
</ul>

<p>Okay, let it be divine. Maybe by ""wave"" the author means some spiritual effort, an effort to understand some other person. Hence, a divine errand. It's hazy, but I get the general feeling. </p>

<ul>
<li>The messenger enamored too. </li>
</ul>

<p>The wave is enamored? It's getting hazier. The wave fell in love with another wave (another person?). </p>

<ul>
<li>Forgetting to return. </li>
</ul>

<p>It fell in love and forgot to return. Okay. </p>

<ul>
<li>We make the wise distinction still. </li>
</ul>

<p>What? Here I crush into a concrete wall. I don't understand this line at all. We sent our wave, it fell in love and forgot to return. But what is ""distinction"" and how does one ""make a distinction""? </p>

<ul>
<li>Soever made in vain.</li>
</ul>

<p>I understand that this relates to ""distinction"" but that does not help my understanding. ""This distinction is always made in vain; there is always no use of this distinction"" - but what is ""distinction""? Distinguishing two waves between each other? But we did not see our target wave, and the wave we sent got lost. </p>

<ul>
<li>The sagest time to dam the sea is when the sea is gone —</li>
</ul>

<p>Apparently the sea consisted of only two waves. And now that our wave got lost and the first wave was not even seen by us, the sea is gone and we can put a dam on the dry surface.  </p>

<p>Maybe there is a plain English explanation of this poem somewhere. I googled but found literary criticism, which does not help. I need at least to grasp the basic meaning.   </p>

  nestling close, always obligated; </p>

"In Margeret Atwood's ""Hag-Seed,"" where is Caliban?","<p>Margeret Atwood's <em>Hag-Seed</em> is a metafictional retelling of Shakespeare's <em>The Tempest</em>. Many elements of <em>The Tempest</em> are clearly recognizable (e.g. Felix is very obviously Prospero), while others have interesting twists (e.g. Felix's daughter is a combination of Miranda and Ariel -- and there are other characters who echo Miranda and Ariel as well).</p>

<p>But one iconic character seems to be missing. <strong>Where is Caliban?</strong></p>

<p>There's no clear reference to a Caliban character (as we have with Felix/Prospero, Tony/Antonio, Lonny/Lorenzo...). Nor is there any character who seems to take on Caliban's narrative role (e.g., attempting to undermine Felix, threatening something dear to him) or any of his thematic elements (e.g. being warped and misshapen; being mistreated by Felix).</p>

<p>One could argue that the book simply isn't focused on that facet of the story (as, indeed, the book is focused on some elements of <em>The Tempest</em> and not others), but the book's very title is <em>Hag-Seed</em>, a direct reference to Caliban. This seems to suggest that elements of Caliban should be central to the story -- </p>

"Earliest work of fiction in which characters using telepathy can't lie","<p>In Liu Cixin's novel <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three-Body_Problem_(novel)"" rel=""noreferrer""><em>The Three-Body Problem</em></a> (2006/2008), 
the inhabitants of the planet Trisolaris communicate with each other using telepathy and are unable to lie. In Ursula Le Guin's novel <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Left_Hand_of_Darkness"" rel=""noreferrer""><em>The Left Hand of Darkness</em></a> (1969), Genly Ai is capable of ""mindspeech"" (essentially telepathy) and says it is impossible to lie when using mindspeech.</p>

<p>The term <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telepathy"" rel=""noreferrer"">telepathy</a> dates from the late 19th century, although similar concepts in other cultures may predate the coinage of the word (see e.g. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ishin-denshin"" rel=""noreferrer"">ishin-denshin</a>, which is also perceived as a sincere form of communication [*]).</p>

<p>Characters who don't lie can also be found in fiction. For example, <a href=""http://www.mahabharataonline.com/stories/mahabharata_character.php?id=59"" rel=""noreferrer"">Yudhisthira</a>, a character from the <em><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahabharata"" rel=""noreferrer"">Mahabharata</a></em>, is said to a unable to lie, but this has nothing to do with telepathy.</p>

<p>So my question is: What is the earliest work of literature in which a character (or several) is capable of telepathy and is unable to lie using that form of communication? (Silent forms of prayer to a divine or semi-divine being are outside the scope of this question.)</p>

<p>Note:
[*] It would probably inaccurate to translate ""ishin-denshin"" as ""telepathy"", though. There is only a vague similarity in that it is an unspoken form of communication.</p>

"Looking for an old O. Henry story about a wealthy young man trying to woo a ""genteel poor"" young lady in New York City","<p>I'm trying to pin down a certain short story by O. Henry. I remember the plot quite well, but not the title, nor which book collection of O. Henry's stories I first encountered it within. And let's face it: That man (otherwise known as William Sydney Porter) wrote a huge number of short stories. </p>

<p>A little Googling failed to turn it up when I searched for words and phrases I thought I remembered. And when I looked for a collection of online summaries of O. Henry's works, I failed to find this one. For instance, it is not one of the stories summarized <a href=""http://www.shortstoryguide.com/o-henry-short-stories/"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a> or <a href=""http://www.eastoftheweb.com/short-stories/index.php?p=web/author/OHenry"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a>. </p>

<p>What I remember about the characters and plot:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>As the story begins, a young man is speaking to a young lady. It appears that they have known each other all their lives, and in recent years he has been thinking that he is love with her. Now he is begging her to marry him. (It may not have been the first time.) She seems fond of him, but for some reason or other she has turned him down. I got the impression that she was highly sensitive about the fact that his family was wealthy and hers was poor, which he may have been so foolish as to mention as a good reason for her to marry him. The girl's family's ""genteel poverty"" may have been a fairly recent change in their circumstances, however, since I <em>think</em> the two families lived near one another in a ""good part of town."" (Implicitly she resided in a large house which her family had owned, free and clear, for a long time, or so I gathered.) </p></li>
<li><p>She even goes so far as to say that she is going to return all his gifts. He blinks, and claims she has never done him the honor of accepting any of the gifts he has tried to give her. (Implicitly: Within the last few years, after he started getting really interested in her in romantic terms.) She gently but firmly sets him straight on that point. Evidently he has <em>forgotten</em> that once upon a time, when she was just a little girl (4? 6? Something like that?), and he was a few years older, he gave her a toy bear (I think) which was hollow and filled with candy. She ate the candy, but she still has the bear, and will return it to him as soon as possible as a sign that she doesn't want to receive any other gifts from him. </p></li>
<li><p>After this highly unsatisfactory conversation, this young man goes walking through a park (Central Park?). He sees another young couple sitting side by side on a park bench, and he somehow learns or deduces that they have nowhere else to spend the night, and it promises to be a fairly cold night. (Not actually snowing, if memory serves, but bound to be uncomfortable for people spending all the hours of darkness outdoors.) </p></li>
<li><p>The two young gentlemen confer, and the stranger in town says that he and the young lady are eloping. I think they were from ""old Southern families""; I forget how they ended up here (in what I'm <em>almost sure</em> is New York City, where so many of O. Henry's tales were set). They have little or no money at the moment, and no friends or relatives in this city who would put them up for the night, and they can't get properly married until tomorrow morning. Of course it would never do for them to share sleeping quarters inside a room somewhere when they were not yet a married couple.</p></li>
<li><p>The wealthy young gentleman would be happy to lend or give enough funds to let these two lovebirds each have a separate hotel room, but soon realizes that their Southern pride won't allow them to accept such <em>charity</em> from a total stranger. After chewing on the problem, he does suggest a compromise which would not require any money to change hands. He assures the Southern gentleman that he, the wealthy young man, is very well-acquainted with a young lady of impeccable moral fiber who would be happy to share her accommodations with another well-bred young lady (the Southern girl). The Southern gentleman is, of course, welcome to sit on the park bench all night if he feels the honorable obligation to do it that way, but wouldn't it be nice for his young lady to protect her health by finding shelter with another young lady? This suggestion is finally accepted.</p></li>
<li><p>At the end of the story, the wealthy young gentleman receives that toy bear back (by messenger, I believe), and there is something inside it -- or accompanying it -- to strongly suggest (in some symbolical way which escapes me) that his young lady has decided the time is right for them to get married after all, now that he's somehow ""proved"" something-or-other about himself.  </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Does anyone recognize this story? If I went digging around in all the online e-texts I could find that collect material by O. Henry, I might eventually unearth it, but I'm hoping that this approach will be much faster. (Since my Googling efforts didn't work.)</p>

Dumbledore fell in love with Grindelwald, and that that added to his horror when Grindelwald showed himself to be what he was.

But, he met someone as brilliant as he was, and rather like Bellatrix he was very drawn to this brilliant person, and horribly, terribly let down by him. Yeah, that's how I always saw Dumbledore. In fact, recently I was in a script read through for the sixth film, and they had Dumbledore saying a line to Harry early in the script saying I knew a girl once, whose hair... [laughter].

"What is the significance of the portraits in Slade House?","<p><strong>This question contains spoilers for David Mitchell's Slade House.</strong></p>

<p>In the first three chapters, the narrator will at some point ascend the stairs in Slade House and walk past a bunch of portraits. These seem to be very accurate portraits of the previous victims of the Grayer twins as they looked at the time of their death, in chronological order. The last portrait in the line depicts the narrator themselves, but without eyes (whereas the other portraits all seem to have eyes). As far as I remember, the portraits themselves are never mentioned explicitly by either the twins or Marinus in the book (the only people from whom we could expect an explanation).</p>

<p>It's been a while since I read The Bone Clocks, but I seem to remember that the Blind Cathar is also a painting without eyes. This doesn't seem like a coincidence, but I'm not sure what to make of it.</p>

<p>So what is the significance of the portraits? Is it just the twins showing off? Is it some sort of manifestation of the previous victims that they can't control, much like the ""ghosts"" of the hairdresser and of Gordon that show up? They don't seem to be a <em>necessary</em> component of the orison, since Freya doesn't see any portraits in The Fox and Hounds. Why don't the portraits have eyes until the victim is killed?</p>

<p>I suspect that a complete answer might have to draw upon the mythology established in The Bone Clocks, unless I'm missing something obvious in Slade House.</p>

"What is the greater meaning of the thrush?","<p>In <em>1984</em>, Orwell devotes a few lines to a singing thrush that lands several feet away from Julia and Winston during their first secret meeting. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A thrush had alighted on a bough not  five metres away, almost at the level of their faces. Perhaps it had not seen them. It was in the sun, they in the shade. It spread out its wings,  fitted them carefully into place again, ducked its head for a moment, as though making a sort of obeisance to the sun, and then began to pour forth a torrent of song. In the afternoon hush the volume of sound was startling. Winston and Julia clung together, fascinated.  The music went on and on, minute after minute, with astonishing variations, never once repeating itself, almost as though the bird were deliberately showing off its virtuosity. Sometimes it stopped for a few seconds, spread out and resettled its wings, then swelled its speckled breast and again burst into song. Winston watched it with a sort of vague reverence. For whom, for what, was that bird singing? No mate, no rival was watching it. What made it sit at the edge of the lonely wood and pour its music into nothingness? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But by degrees the flood of music drove all speculations out of his mind. It was as though it were a kind of liquid stuff that poured all over him and got mixed up with the sunlight that  filtered through the leaves. He stopped thinking and merely felt.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What's the purpose of such a detailed description? Personally, I've always thought that the thrush has had a greater symbolic meaning in the novel because its beautiful singing serves as a sharp contrast to the harshness of Oceanian society. Is there greater meaning in this passage that I'm missing?</p>

It makes perfect sense that there <em>is</em> no answer; that Handler didn't come up with an answer to ""what is the sugar bowl <em>really</em>"" because that would be 100% beside the point of the series.</p>

<p>At the same time, Handler builds it up so evocatively, puts such tremendous weight upon it and seems to sprinkle the series with oblique clues and references, that there <em>might</em> be an answer to be found. Even if the books don't actually give us enough information to puzzle it out, there might <em>still</em> be an answer that Handler has come up with, and is, at least, consistent with what we know.</p>

<p><strong>Does an answer exist?</strong> Has anyone made a strong, plausible claim to uncovering it? Has Handler gone on the record anywhere, saying there is or isn't a solution?</p>

<p>I'm less interested in what the answer <em>is</em> (although, sure, that too); what I'm interested in is whether an answer exists at all.</p>

"Is there any evidence of who assaulted Lola in ""Atonement"", given the final reveal?","<p><strong>Content Note:</strong> Discussion of the sexual assault of a minor, and ""evidence"" of the innocence or guilt of possible suspects.</p>

<hr>

<p><em>Atonement</em> revolves around Briony, who as a child is the only witness to Lola being raped. Briony doesn't get a look at the rapist, but she's convinced it was poor neighbor Robbie - and testifies as much to the police. Meanwhile, the book clearly implies the true rapist is Paul Marshall, the chocolate manufacturer who Lola later, achingly, marries.</p>

<p>But by the end of the book, we learn that we are not reading a neutral narration of the events -- the entire book is revealed to be written by Briony, out of her guilt over accusing Robbie. And an unreliable one as well; she says how she's made changes and touches and written it from memory at best.</p>

<p>It's all very tragic -- except now we need to reassess everything we thought we knew about the actual incident.</p>

<ul>
<li>The signs we <em>thought</em> were a clear implication of Marshall - scratches on his arm, lavishing attention on Lola - are no longer subtle authorial hints; they're tiny shreds of unreliable evidence that don't make sense for Briony to have remembered with any measure of certainty.</li>
<li>The signs we saw of Robbie's affability - e.g. the justification of clumsiness for sending Briony's sister a lewd letter - are now entirely fabricated.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>As far as I can tell</em>, this casts the story in a rather different light. While Briony has undoubtedly done Robbie wrong by perjuring herself, the book's assumption that Robbie is innocent and Marshall is guilty doesn't seem to have any concrete support. Unless I've missed something?</p>

<p><strong>Is there any reliable evidence that Briony was actually witness to, as to who the rapist was?</strong></p>

"Isn't Ayn Rand a bit irrational in her criticism of altrusim in The Fountainhead?","<p>In the speech of Howard Roark, or at most places in the book, altruists are shown to be in negative light/evil. But this criticism seems to constructed by deliberately painting such characters as evil. Altruism is not evaluated ideally as egotism is. All is virtuous of egotists and all is evil of altruists.Does this not weaken the philosophy of objectivism as the comparison is not fair?</p>

<p>For example in the speech :</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Men have been taught that their first concern is to relieve the sufferings of others. But suffering is a disease. Should one come upon it, one tries to give relief and assistance. To make that the highest test of virtue is to make suffering the most important part of life.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But it is not the suffering that we should treat as highest virtue, but the act of relieving the suffering. Did not the people like Mother Teresa, Gandhi and Mandela held relieving the suffering of others as prime motive of their lives? Did they enslave people or liberate them? So can't these be called altrusits who initiated human progress in their regions by gaining independence for their people?</p>

<p>I completely agree with virtues of egotism mentioned in the book. But I disagree with some of the vices of altruism mentioned. She says that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The man who attempts to live for others is a dependent. He is a parasite in motive and makes parasites of those he serves. The relationship produces nothing but mutual corruption. It is impossible in concept. The nearest approach to it in reality—the man who lives to serve others—is the slave</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The ""living for others"" here is meant in a sense in which Peter Keating lives, for other's appreciation to him etc. But this is how the character is pictured in the book. Can't ""living for others"" imply as life of say, Mahatma Gandhi or any ""honest"" social worker? An implication where self-sacrifice means sacrificing one's happiness, personal goals to serve others but similarly not selling one's soul to others. These people rather can be said to have strongest of souls in human history. Are these not the fountainheads of human progress?</p>

<p>Gautam Buddha renunciated everything as a king. His personal happiness was gained through relief of suffering of people, he liberated people. Unlike Toohey who made them dependant. Why can't the character be someone like Buddha rather than Toohey. Hence, is this is not unfair vilification of altruism? This defeats the rationality of her philosophy to some extent. </p>

<p>In this way, isn't the evaluation of altruism seem partial or conveniently alienated in the book?</p>

"Foreshadowing in The Great Gatsby","<blockquote>
  <p>How does the one writer you have studied foreshadow events or ideas to come later in their works, and what is the effect of such foreshadowing?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This was one of the questions which I have been assigned to. I am supposed to answer this question with reference to The Great Gatsby. One of my pointers is this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Secondly, foreshadowing is also used to allude to us that things are about to turn horribly sour for Gatsby. This literary device was used in chapter 5, during Gatsby’s meeting with Daisy. On the day that Gatsby and Daisy met, it poured heavily. Meanwhile, inside the house, as Gatsby was reclining, “His head leaned back so far that it rested against the face of a defunct mantelpiece clock, and from this position, his distraught eyes stared down at Daisy”. While conversing, “the clock took this moment to tilt dangerously at the pressure of his head, whereupon he turned and caught it with trembling fingers, and set it back in place.” Nick also notes that “I think we all believed for a moment that it had smashed in pieces on the floor.”</p>
  
  <p>This series of events that occur consecutively cleverly alludes to us what is about to happen to Gatsby. Firstly, the rain that was pouring during the meeting set the tone for future events to come. It alluded to us that although things appeared to be going well for Gatsby, trouble was just outside the door. Next, the defunct clock that Gatsby leaned on as he stared down at Daisy also represented his life as a whole. Gatsby was constantly shown to be living in the past, in the love that he and Daisy once had. That is depicted through the broken clock that represented Gatsby’s life being frozen in time. The clock then begins to tilt, almost crashing to the ground. This warns us that this frozen life of Gatsby’s is about to fall apart. Even when Gatsby attempts to put things back together, as shown through him setting the clock back in its place, his life will ultimately fall apart and he might even lose it. This is foreshadowed through the fact that everyone else still believed for a moment, that the clock had smashed to pieces on the floor.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Initially, I felt like this analysis was a bit too hopeful. Like I was drawing conclusions from an otherwise minor event in the story. I just found it weird that Fitzgerald would have chosen to write that bit about the clock tipping over if it had no special meaning to it. So I felt that I had to analyse it.</p>

<p>Is my analysis here too far fetched? Any advice on how it could be otherwise interpreted? Or whether this event in the story should need analysis at all?</p>

Jane Austen looked at it and laughed at it and devised a perfectly natural, shapely sentence proper for her own use and never departed from it.</p>

"Why was an American diplomat's family considered the best place for the Antichrist?","<p>In <em>Good Omens</em> by Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman, the original master plan (foiled by dumb chance and human incompetence) was that the newly born Antichrist should be brought up in the family of the US Cultural Attaché in Britain.</p>

"Why is a special license needed to get married?","<p>In a lot of historical romance novels (specifically those set in Regency England), people decide to get married very suddenly a lot of the time. You see this a lot in the marriage of convenience trope, but also in various other flavours of historical romance.</p>

<p>When this happens, they usually either end up running away to Gretna Green (because apparently anyone there can witness/perform marriages, at least in the era historical romances are usually set) or getting a ""special licence"" that allows them to get married very quickly.</p>

<p>What's this special licence? Why is it needed? Is this an actual thing that was required of people of the time, or is it merely a romance novel trope that allows the author to sidestep the actual laws/rules of marriage in that time period?</p>

"Rhett Butler's character archetype?","<p>My question is about ""Gone with the Wind,"" and is actually more about cinema than literature (I haven't read the book), but I think it might also be pertinent here. </p>

<p>How would you call Rhett Butler's character archetype in ""Gone with the Wind""? I don't mean so much his alpha-male, bad-boy or a self-made-man aspect, but him as a character who can successfully operate on both sides of the political divide without caring much for neither. He isn't a go-between, and the ""crafty self-made-man"" does not really capture his free movement between the two sides, his transcendent or dialectical position. Is there a term for a character archetype like him? </p>

<p>""The player"" would work, but I find it somewhat lacking as it subordinates his position to the divide rather than suggesting how he transcends it. He is no Harlequin. Trickster is a bit too generic</p>

"Why does ""Nighttime Birds"" associate night with warmth?","<p>The lyrics to <em>Nighttime Birds</em>, the title track from the album of the same name by <em>The Gathering</em>, are as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Their ways are open<br>
  they spread as their wings<br>
  they want to be certain<br>
  of a warm surrounding</p>
  
  <p>When they fly<br>
  through the night as beautiful<br>
  nighttime birds</p>
  
  <p>The warm wind picks them up</p>
  
  <p>When they fly<br>
  through the night as beautiful<br>
  nighttime birds</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm particularly interested in the lines ""they want to be certain / of a warm surrounding"" and ""The warm wind picks them up"". Why is this associated with <strong>nighttime</strong> birds? Typically, you wouldn't associate ""night"" with ""warm winds"" and wanting to be sure of a warm surrounding, but the lyrics are quite specific that they want to be certain of a warm surrounding ""when they fly through the night.""</p>

<p>Or, are they merely seeking warmth <em>in the midst of</em> the night?</p>

<p>A third (rather literal) interpretation is that the song's referring to the fact that migrating birds tend to try to catch warmer ""updrafts"" by opening their wings to ""catch"" it. There are a few birds that are either nocturnal or frequently migrate at night, so I suppose that it's <em>plausible</em> at least that the author was thinking of that.</p>

<p>Is there an authoritative source on which one the author was referring to? Or are there other possibilities that I'm not thinking of?</p>

After the first day he had no curiosity at all. To break the monotony he invented games. Death to all modifiers, he declared one day, and out of every letter that passed through his hands went every adverb and every adjective. The next day he made war on articles. He reached a much higher plane of creativity the following day when he blacked out everything in the letters but a, an and the. That erected more <strong>dynamic intralinear tensions</strong>, he felt, and in just about every case left a message far more universal. Soon he was proscribing parts of salutations and signatures and leaving the text untouched. One time he blacked out all but the salutation ""Dear Mary"" from a letter, and at the bottom he wrote, ""I yearn for you tragically A. T. Tappman, Chaplain, U.S. Army."" A. T.

"Accuracy of a translation: how to forge an opinion?","<p>This question is directly inspired from this one on <a href=""https://french.stackexchange.com/questions/27141/the-word-chimiste-in-baudelaires-au-lecteur"">French Language stack exchange</a>.</p>

<p>To summarize it, the OP is wondering about the good translation for <em>""chimiste""</em> in Baudelaire's opening poem <a href=""https://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Les_Fleurs_du_mal/1861/Au_lecteur"" rel=""noreferrer"">Au Lecteur</a>. This poem can also be found <a href=""http://fleursdumal.org/poem/099"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a> with some translations of it.</p>

<p>I have tried to provide an answer, but, as non specialist, I feel it can be considered as opinion-based. </p>

<p>So, my question here is double:</p>

<ul>
<li>What to think about this particular case (<em>""chemist""</em> or <em>""alchemist""</em>)?</li>
<li>And more globally what is the good way to forge an opinion in such a case?</li>
</ul>

<p>(I've read these questions and answers (<a href=""https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/163/what-are-the-challenges-in-translating-a-work-of-literature"">1</a>, <a href=""https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/2686/does-translation-take-away-from-the-meaning-of-verse-and-poetry"">2</a>) but I think this is not totally a duplicate of them)</p>

<hr>

<p>Following the comment of <a href=""https://literature.stackexchange.com/users/111/hamlet"">Hamlet</a>, I try here to explain my reasoning about this translation (but my English is poor and saying all this is not self evident... sorry about that). </p>

<p>I think Baudelaire could have chosen the word <em>""alchemist""</em> if he though it was the good/appropriated one. But he did not.</p>

<p>Surely there is the alexandrine aspect, and due to that we can not have:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sur l'oreiller du mal c'est Satan Trismégiste </p>
  
  <p>Qui berce longuement notre esprit enchanté, </p>
  
  <p>Et le riche métal de notre volonté </p>
  
  <p>Est tout vaporisé par ce savant alchimiste (13 syllables).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And we can't either have</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Est vaporisé par ce savant alchimiste (because we lose here the two hemistichs)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But (even if less pleasant), it can be:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Est tout vaporisé par ce grand alchimiste (12 = 6 + 6 syllables... even if Trismégiste is already ""three times great""...)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or any other formulation that surely Baudelaire was able to elaborate.</p>

<p>On another plane, there is the meaning aspect:</p>

<p>The first one is near context ""riche métal"" (""rich metal"") which recalls gold, added to ""enchanté"" (""bewitched"") et ""vaporisé"" (""vaporized"")... which all could tend to alchemy. </p>

<p>The second is the overall poem context: Baudelaire is talking about our human condition, something totally real which is not related to false beliefs (alchemy). And presuming Satan is part of this reality (or simply an allegory), he is surely skilled enough to make usage of a real science.</p>

<p>So, to summarize, my opinion is ""chemist"" is more appropriate. But I'm in hope to find here a more accurate and expert explanation.</p>

"Why don't people in the Chronicles of Narnia have trouble ""transitioning"" back to their old life after extended times in other worlds?","<p>In <em>The Chronicles of Narnia</em>, people often spend weeks, months, or even decades in other worlds. They return to their old life at the exact instant that they left as if they were never gone. For example, the Pevensies spent years (perhaps decades?) in Narnia after the events of <em>The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe</em>. Afterwards, they're transported back to their original lives as schoolchildren and carry on with their ordinary lives. People still treated them the exact same way that they always treated them, oblivious to all of the knowledge, skills, and life experience that they gained while they were in Narnia.</p>

<p>It's strongly implied that being in certain worlds influences your abilities and attitudes to an extent (characters often slowly regain certain skills, such as swordsmanship, over the course of several hours upon returning to Narnia). Even setting that aside, why didn't the characters find that <em>profoundly</em> disturbing? Personally, if I woke up as a 10-year-old again and was expected to carry on living as if I actually was a 10-year-old (returning to elementary school, etc.) and being treated as if I was 10, I'd find that <em>profoundly</em> unsettling and frustrating (not to mention infuriating), so why does this never appear in the books?</p>

"(How) have the interpretations of Macbeth's ending evolved over time?","<p>I just attended a performance of <em>Macbeth</em> that ended on a much more ambivalent note than Shakespeare's original text. Instead of Malcolm and his posse picking up the shambles and Malcolm motivating his men to look into a brighter future, it actually ended with Macduff crowning Malcolm, surrounded and cheered on by the witches who start to recitate, together with Malcolm even, the ""fair is foul"" rhyme.</p>

<p>This paints a lot darker prospect of the future, if we understand it as Malcolm ultimately becoming (if not already being) a playball for the witches' schemes as well. It then reminded me of the <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2884018/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Justin Kurzel adaptation from 2015</a>, which also had a more <a href=""https://movies.stackexchange.com/q/55556/49"">ambiguous ending that left me wondering</a> a little.

<p>Now my experience with <em>Macbeth</em> largely comes from cinematic adaptations, but in retrospect on these and reinforced by the performance I just attended, I can't help but notice a <strong>trend of having the play end on a much more ambiguous or even pessimistic note than the original text <em>seems</em> to suggest</strong>. But maybe it is also just me failing to read the subtext in the play's ending and it already contains more ambivalent undertones that I just missed in the dialogue. These endings <em>do</em> fit not too badly to the rest of the play's overall tone, especially if we take it as a general parable for the corrupting nature of power.</p>

<p>So to condense these ramblings into a hopefully not <em>too</em> broad question, I'd like to know more about the <strong>evolution of these interpretations. Are these pessimistic tendencies already present in the original play? If not, when did these more ambiguous intepretations of the ending emerge?</strong> Is this a generally exhibited approach to the play nowadays, maybe as a natural extension of its themes and is this trend maybe pointing to a larger difference in how the characters' motivations are seen? Basically, <strong>has the understanding of the larger-scale themes of the play maybe changed throughout history?</strong></p>

After 1611, Shakespeare co-authored <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_VIII_(play)"" rel=""noreferrer""><em>Henry VIII</em></a>, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Two_Noble_Kinsmen"" rel=""noreferrer""><em>The Two Noble Kinsmen</em></a> and possibly the lost <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_History_of_Cardenio"" rel=""noreferrer""><em>Cardenio</em></a>. Collaborative play-writing was very normal in Shakespeare's times, as can be seen from the examples of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beaumont_and_Fletcher"" rel=""noreferrer"">Francis Beaumont and John Fletcher</a>, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowley"" rel=""noreferrer"">William Rowley</a> and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Dekker_(writer)"" rel=""noreferrer"">Thomas Dekker</a>.</p>

<p>So what is the origin of the symbolic reading of the breaking of the staff that interprets this act is Shakespeare saying goodbye to play-writing? Who was the first critic or biographer who came up with this interpretation?</p>

<p>I consulted the following works in vain:</p>

<p>Here is my question:
does the author's use of parallelism reinforce the poem's strong
visual images?</p>

<p>The book says parallelism only adds to the poem's rhythm and elicits an emotional response from the reader with only such explanation about images:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In this poem, parallelism does not affect the strong visual images in
  any way</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why not? For example, in this excerpt, doesn't it help to produce stronger images by applying the same structure of lines?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Farewell to the mountains high covered with snow;<br>
  Farewell to the
  straths and green valleys below;<br>
  Farewell to the forests and

"What is Faulkner's point of view in the ""Address to the Graduating Class?""","<p>Here is the ""Address to the Graduating Class"" by Faulkner.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Years ago, before any of you were born, a wise Frenchman said, “If
  youth knew; if age could.” We all know what he meant: that when you
  are young, you have the power to do anything, but you don’t know what
  to do. Then, when you have got old and experience and observation have
  taught you answers, you are tired, frightened; you don’t care, you
  want to be left alone as long as you yourself are safe; you no longer
  have the capacity or the will to grieve over any wrongs but your own.</p>
  
  <p>So you young men and women in this room tonight, and in thousands of
  other rooms like this one about the earth today, have the power to
  change the world, rid it forever of war and injustice and suffering,
  provided you know how, know what to do. And so according to the old
  Frenchman, since you can’t know what to do because you are young, then
  anyone standing here with a head full of white hair, should be able to
  tell you.</p>
  
  <p>But maybe this one is not as old and wise as his white hairs pretend
  or claim. Because he can’t give you a glib answer or pattern either.
  But he can tell you this, because he believes this. What threatens us
  today is fear. Not the atom bomb, nor even fear of it, because if the
  bomb fell on Oxford tonight, all it could do would be to kill us,
  which is nothing, since in doing that, it will have robbed itself of
  its only power over us: which is fear of it, the being afraid of it.
  Our danger is not that. Our danger is the forces in the world today
  which are trying to use man’s fear to rob him of his individuality,
  his soul, trying to reduce him to an unthinking mass by fear and
  bribery—giving him free food which he has not earned, easy and
  valueless money which he has not worked for; the economies or
  ideologies or political systems, communist or socialist or democratic,
  whatever they wish to call themselves, the tyrants and the
  politicians, American or European or Asiatic, whatever they call
  themselves, who would reduce man to one obedient mass for their own
  aggrandizement and power, or because they themselves are baffled and
  afraid, afraid of, or incapable of, believing in man’s capacity for
  courage and endurance and sacrifice.</p>
  
  <p>That is what we must resist, if we are to change the world for man’s
  peace and security. It is not men in the mass who can and will save
  Man. It is Man himself, created in the image of God so that he shall
  have the power and the will to choose right from wrong, and so be able
  to save himself because he is worth saving;—Man, the individual, men
  and women, who will refuse always to be tricked or frightened or
  bribed into surrendering, not just the right but the duty too, to
  choose between justice and injustice, courage and cowardice, sacrifice
  and greed, pity and self;—who will believe always not only in the
  right of man to be free of injustice and rapacity and deception, but
  the duty and responsibility of man to see that justice and truth and
  pity and compassion are done.</p>
  
  <p>So, never be afraid. Never be afraid to raise your voice for honesty
  and truth and compassion, against injustice and lying and greed. If
  you, not just you in this room tonight, but in all the thousands of
  other rooms like this one about the world today and tomorrow and next
  week, will do this, not as a class or classes, but as individuals, men
  and women, you will change the earth; in one generation all the
  Napoleons and Hitlers and Caesars and Mussolinis and Stalins and all
  the other tyrants who want power and aggrandizement, and the simple
  politicians and time-servers who themselves are merely baffled or
  ignorant or afraid, who have used, or are using, or hope to use, man’s
  fear and greed for man’s enslavement, will have vanished from the face
  of it.</p>

<p>Here, I see mainly two groups of words that can show the author's perspective: ""we,"" ""us"" and ""you,"" ""your.""<br>
What I thought is that because this speech is motivational and gives life advice, it has the second person point of view. Because you do write a how-to-do-something or what-to-do articles by using this perspective, right?<br>
However, my book says the perspective is the first person. Even though I see a lot in the speech was said about ""us,"" I doubt if it's not more about ""you"" (since it was intended for the graduates whom the speaker could see and address; hence the word ""address"" in the title).<br>
Could you help with what's wrong here?<br>
Also, could here be two perspectives? I saw such a possibility as well though again, my book says otherwise.</p>

It is commonly believed that children are, by nature, more imaginative than adults, but this is questionable. It is probably the case only in cultures like our own which put a higher social and economic value upon practical and abstract thinking than upon wonder and images; in a culture which put a high value on imagination and a low one on logic, <strong>children might well appear to be more rational than adults, for a child is not, by nature, more <em>anything</em></strong>. In all cultures, however, there is one constant difference between children and adults, namely, that, for the former, learning their native tongue is itself one of the most important experiences in their lives, while, for the latter, language has become an instrument for interpreting and communicating experience; to recapture the sense of language as experience, an adult has to visit a foreign country.</p>

"What is the message of Poe's ""Eleonora""?","<p>I recently read Edgar Allan Poe's short story ""Eleonora"", a thinly veiled self-portrait in which the protagonist falls in love with his younger cousin, who later dies and leaves him alone. He (the protagonist, not Poe) vows that his love for his cousin will be undying and that he will never love another woman in her place. So far, so unsurprising: this is standard romance fare.</p>

<p>Then, in the final paragraphs of the story, the narrator reveals that, long after the death of Eleonora and his subsequent departure from the valley where they grew up, he falls in love again and marries another woman named Ermengarde, about whom almost nothing is said, except for the implication that Heaven and/or the spirit of Eleonora forgive him for breaking his vow, for reasons unknown.</p>

<p><strong>What is the message being put across by this story?</strong> Is the 'moral', if you will, that it's OK to break a vow of eternal love? The story is all about issues which were surely of great emotional importance to the author; is there some hidden meaning in it which isn't immediately clear?</p>

The austerity impressed his foremen, and they, after waiting for him to finish his meal, promised him to continue working, but pleaded for some solution. Of course, the payments came soon after.</p>

"Where did the spells come from in The Magic Grandfather?","<p>In <em>The Magic Grandfather</em>, by Jay Williams (published 1979), there are several spells that do certain things. For instance, <em>Aldoragamba luro vopo vir voarchadumia</em> is a transportation spell. <em>Tripsarecopsem</em> helps with the crystal ball.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Near the beginning of the notebook of spells he found a description of how to pronounce the hard words, which was a great help. He fixed each step for himself so that he was clear about how to open the portal and keep it open. Above all, he set himself to learning the transportation spell by heart. It had only five words, but they were a mouthful: <em>Aldoragamba luro vopo vir voarchadumia</em>.<br>

  <p>This, said the notebook, was a ball made out of rock crystal, whatever that was. Looking into it and saying the word <em>Tripsarecopsem</em>, you could see any person or thing at a distance and this helped you concentrate on them so that you could bring them to you.<br>

<p>When Corey describes the ethnicity and inherited culture of individual characters to depict a multicultural, multi-ethnic future, he focuses (sometimes in creepy detail) on their skin color and facial features. But while he's got a future full of people descended from Pacific Islanders, Asians, Africans, etc., hardly any individual is described with physical markers I'd consider ""white.""</p>

<p>I fully embrace an extremely diverse future, but I'm quite sure Corey's not imagining a future where humanity's simply blended out the extremes of physical diversity. I'm told this by his repeated emphasis that Naomi's multi-ethnic features are extremely unusual.</p>

<p>In the TV series based on the books both the main characters and a lot of the background folks are cast with white actors (even the guy with eight parents), but I don't see much indication that's specifically adhering to any sense the book provides for those characters.</p>

<p>Is Corey's future just a largely non-white one, or is something else going on? Am I anticipating a future revelation about the setting or is this just an uncommented bit of subtle worldbuilding?</p>

"Is the Blue Ajah portrayed as ""the good Ajah""?","<p>In Robert Jordan's <em>Wheel of Time</em> series, the Aes Sedai are divided into seven Ajahs: the Blue, the Brown, the Green, the Grey, the Red, the White, and the Yellow (plus the Black Ajah, which is secret and threaded insidiously through all of the others).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Warning: spoilers from books 4+ follow.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think few would dispute that the Red Ajah is portrayed as ""the bad Ajah"", the worst of them all (not counting the Black, of course). Various things throughout the series support this:</p>

<ul>
<li>By its very nature, gentling men who can channel, the Red Ajah presents a serious threat to the main protagonist of the series.</li>
<li>Several prominent Blacks are officially Reds, such as Galina Casban (head of both the Red Ajah and the Black Ajah, if I recall correctly) and Katerine Alruddin.</li>
<li>Elaida. 'Nuff said.</li>
<li>After the splitting of the Tower, the entire Red Ajah sides with Elaida - not a single one in Salidar.</li>
</ul>

<p>The closest we get to a protagonist among the Red, unless there's someone I'm forgetting, is Pevara, and she isn't really much of a Red, even having spoken in favour of Warders. By contrast, there are more ""good"" characters, people we can sympathise with, in every other Ajah.</p>

<p><strong>Can it be said that the Blue is portrayed as ""the good Ajah"" in the same way as the Red is portrayed as ""the bad Ajah""?</strong></p>

<p>Points in favour:</p>

<ul>
<li>The very first Aes Sedai we meet, and the only one we know for a long time, is of the Blue. In this sense, the Blue Ajah provides our introduction to Aes Sedai, a base point to identify with and from which to judge the rest.</li>
<li>After the splitting of the Tower, the entire Blue Ajah goes to Salidar - not a single one with Elaida.</li>
<li>There aren't many prominent Blacks who are officially Blues. There are two Blues among the thirteen Blacks who leave the Tower in book 2/3, but they're probably the two most minor characters among those thirteen.</li>

<li><em>The Sign of Four</em></li>
<li><em>The Hound of the Baskervilles</em></li>
<li><em>The Valley of Fear</em></li>

<li>fifty-six short stories, separated into five collections:

<li><em>The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes</em> (12 stories)</li>
<li><em>The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes</em> (11-12 stories)</li>
<li><em>The Return of Sherlock Holmes</em> (13 stories)</li>
<li><em>His Last Bow</em> (7-8 stories)</li>
<li><em>The Casebook of Sherlock Holmes</em> (12 stories)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>These were published between 1887 and 1927, and set between around 1800 and 1914. Some of them are set during the period when Holmes and Watson lived together at 221b Baker Street, and others during the period after Watson's marriage when they saw less of each other. But the cutoff point in-universe between these two periods is roughly marked by <em>The Sign of Four</em>, when Watson meets his wife, and this was only the second story to be published; so clearly the chronological and publication orders do not agree. Still other stories are set much earlier, before Holmes and Watson met (e.g. ""The Adventure of the <em>Gloria Scott</em>"", Holmes's first case) or much later, after Holmes retires (e.g. ""The Adventure of the Lion's Mane"").</p>

<p>My question is – what relevance does this chicken have?  Is it meant to show the poverty or loneliness of the men somehow?  Why include it in the story at all?</p>

"How to read é, ä, û?","<p>If I want to read Tolkien's text aloud, or appreciate the rhythm and rhyme in his poems, I find it distracting not to know how names including these characters (and similar ones) were meant to be pronounced. Unfortunately I only have the main books in e-book format; if this is answered in some background material I would highly appreciate a summary or even a literal quote thereof.</p>

<p>I am in particular interested in these letters, from which I assume it would be more or less straightforward to generalize to others reusing the same accents:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>ä</strong> (e.g. <em>Eärendil</em>): I suspect umlaut (German) or separation of sounds (French) or both, but I'm having a hard time in making the first verse trochaic (in accordance with the rest of the poem) in</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Eärendil was a mariner</p>
  
  <p>that tarried in Arvernien;</p>
  
  <p>he built a boat of timber felled</p>
  
  <p>in Nimbrethil to journey in [...]</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p><strong>û</strong> (e.g., <em>Nazgûl</em> or <em>Khazad-dûm</em>): I'm pretty sure that this is just the sound I know as ""u"" (sounds like the /oo/ in /doom/):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The shadow lies upon his tomb</p>
  
  <p>In Moria, in Khazad-dûm.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>What's the difference to ""u"" then?</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>é</strong> (e.g., <em>Sméagol</em> or <em>Éoden</em>): here I only have the pronunciation they adopted in the movie adaptation, the problem of which is that it plainly ignores any diacritics and says ""Smeagol"" in English pronunciation. I very much doubt that is what was intended. Similarly to the above, how to differentiate ""é"" from ""e""?</p></li>

The original account of this story, written in the 12th century by <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_of_Huntingdon"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Henry of Huntingdon</a>, uses it to illustrate Cnut's <strong>humility</strong>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[W]hen at the summit of his power, he [Canute] ordered a seat to be placed for him on the sea-shore when the tide was coming in; thus seated, he shouted to the flowing sea, ""Thou, too, art subject to my command, as the land on which I am seated is mine; and no one has ever resisted my commands with impunity. I command you, then, not to flow over my land, nor presume to wet ihe feet and the robe of your lord."" The tide, however, continuing to rise as usual, dashed over his feet and legs without respect to his royal person. Then the king leaped backwards, saying: ""Let all men know how empty and worthless is the power of kings, for there is none worthy of the name, but He whom heaven, earth, and sea obey by eternal laws.""</p>

"Book about a boy who develops several accidentally destructive science projects","<p>I read this in the 1990s while living in Kentucky. Pretty sure it was a library book, although I'm not certain if it was the school or city library. The main character is a young teenage male, in either middle school or high school, Caucasian, living in a small town in the United States. I believe it had pen-and-ink drawings at a few places in the book, and I'm pretty sure it was broken up into chapters. Two things have stuck with me: one is that he is at one point babysitting an infant (maybe his little brother?), and starts reading the dictionary to the child (I remember ""pusillanimous"" and ""susurration"" being two of the words, the latter being where he realized that the S words worked best), which calms the child. I think there was a later scene where the child was using a few multiple-syllable words as part of its babble, puzzling its parents.</p>

<p>The other is a running thread in the books where he's doing a science project for a science fair, and his projects keep accidentally breaking things. I believe his overall theme was sources of power over history. I remember one project was a full-sized catapult, complete with a large rock in the holder, which went off when someone (the teacher?) pulled the lever, not realizing it was functional. Another was a steam engine. I think it exploded because he didn't set up the pressure valve correctly. The last had something to do with a fan and a source of smoke, maybe a demonstration of wind power. I remember he initially was going to use a burning rag for the smoke, but found a more elegant solution, I think involving chemicals to generate smoke. At the time of the fair, the teachers were hesitant, knowing what had happened with the other projects, but when he switches it on, the calamity comes when a classmate suddenly leaps back and knocks some things (including a bottle of ink, I think) over. Turns out the classmate had reversed the fan blade, thinking it would cause the smoke to blow back on the protagonist, unaware that a reversed fan blade blows the same direction as before.</p>

<p>I feel like I ought to remember more of the book, but those are the bits that stick out. I remember being particularly impressed with the catapult, and trying the dictionary trick with my little brother (it didn't work as well as in the book, but I learned some new words in the process).</p>

Is it the way how characters are developed? Or is it some peculiarity in the use of language? Please feel free to explain in detail as I am a novice.</p>

<p>This is a question popped up in my mind because of several reasons. Literary fiction is the more respected form. But many valuable literary works have actually been popular ones. For example the ""Arabian Nights"" or even the bible stories must be considered to be popular. But they are also respected as literary works. Is that solely because of historic reasons? Also is there some objective criteria that demarcates the genre and literary works? Like one is plot driven and the other is character driven. Or the form of language used in one versus the other. If so can they be expressed explicitly? </p>

<p>From the current context, there could be a book which might be characterized as satirical or detective fictions. But they might still be giving valuable insights into human nature or the society we live in. Will such works be remembered as great works of art?</p>

"Why do Simpson and Bostley speak for each other in ""Lost Voices""?","<p>I'm trying to learn more about spoken word poetry, and I stumbled upon Darius Simpson and Scout Bostley's ""Lost Voices"" (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpPASWlnZIA"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">you can watch the performance online</a>).</p>

<p>One of the themes of the piece is the problematic nature of the privileged speaking for the marginalized. Darius Simpson is a black man, and Scout Bostley is a white woman. Throughout the poem, they describe how those with privilege speak for them rather than allowing them to speak. Here's one such line:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is not a problem that you want to sympathize but to tell me you know my pain, is to stab yourself in the leg because you saw me get shot. We have two different wounds, and looking at yours does nothing to heal mine.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What interested me about the piece is that when it's performed, the two performers describe each other's experience. For example, the poem begins with Bostley saying ""The first day I realized I was black,"" despite the fact that she is white.</p>

"Why does Merion react so strongly to being asked what their gender is?","<p>In the September/October 2017 issue of the <em>Cicada</em> magazine, they ran a story by Nino Cipri, entitled ""A Silly Love Story"".

<p>The story focuses on Jeremy - our main character, a man - and Merion, a bi-gendered character, who are in a relationship.</p>

<p>We see the story of how Jeremy and Merion met, and we see that Merion has an encounter with a girl who is curious as to whether Merion is a boy or girl.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Jeremy was eating kalamata olives when a tall brunette with Bettie Page bangs approached Merion. ""Sorry,"" she said. ""I just have to ask, are you a girl or a boy?""<br>
  Merion glared at her. ""I'm Merion.""<br>
  ""Like, as in Maid Marion?""<br>
  ""Like, as in fuck you,"" he spat. Jeremy's heart had sped up. It was an odd thing to fall in love with somebody's ferocious vulnerability...  </p>

"Which parts of the portrayal of women in ""Flatland"" are satire?","<p>I recently finished <a href=""http://www.geom.uiuc.edu/~banchoff/Flatland/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Flatland</a> (full text link), and I found it generally a somewhat disconcerting read. I realize that it's satire, and it's written in the tone of satire, particularly when it comes to women - but some of the remarks that they make in writing are very off-putting. </p>

<p>I can conclude roughly one of three things:</p>

<ol>
<li>It's actually satire and I'm misreading it under a modern lens with modern expectations,</li>
<li>or - It's poorly-executed satire,</li>
<li>or - This portrayal isn't satire at all, and it just seems like it could be because of a modern lens.</li>
</ol>

<p>I have no idea which of these it is. </p>

<p>The book as written is absolutely satire - the author denotes it as this; it's intended to remark on late Victorian-era societal structure. However, parentheticals sometimes include remarks and comparisons that we're intended to accept and gloss over, which has the effect of implying they're simply true without challenging them in any way (end of chapter 3):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thus, in the most brutal and formidable of the soldier class - <strong>creatures almost on a level with women in their lack of intelligence</strong> - it is found that, as they wax in the mental ability necessary to employ their tremendous penetrating power to advantage... </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Certain things are absolutely satirical (from chapter 4):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>...others oblige a Woman, when travelling, to be followed by one of her sons, or servants, or by her husband; others confine Women altogether to their houses except during the religious festivals. But it has been found by the wisest of our Circles or Statesmen that the multiplication of restrictions on Females tends not only to the debilitation and diminution of the race, but also to the increase of domestic murders to such an extent that a State loses more than it gains by a too prohibitive Code.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a setup that allows Abbot to draw attention to a poor Victorian standard... and then he challenges it in the worst possible way:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For whenever the temper of the Women is thus exasperated by confinement at home or hampering regulations abroad, they are apt to vent their spleen upon their husbands and children; and in the less temperate climates the whole male population of a village has been sometimes destroyed in one or two hours of simultaneous female outbreak.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These kinds of things, in addition to offhand references to ""the Frail Sex"" which go unchallenged, lead me to question whether, or <strong>which parts</strong> were intended as satire, and which parts were intended to remain unchallenged.</p>

<p>Is there any way to tell? How do we know?</p>

  Whoever has found a beloved wife,<br>
  let him join our songs of praise!<br>
  Yes, and anyone who can call one soul<br>
  his own on this earth!<br>
  Any who cannot, let them slink away<br>
  from this gathering in tears!</p>

<p>The 4th verse makes a passing reference to God, but only after a reference to the ""Daughter from Elysum"":</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Every creature drinks in joy<br>

  Do you sense your Creator, O world?<br>
  Seek Him above the canopy of stars!<br>

<p>When the Pevensies accidentally wandered back into England, they had been away for years (or perhaps even decades) and had only a vague recollection that they'd even seen the lamp-post before, which implied that they had forgotten. Why didn't they continue to express that kind of confusion when they got back? The book implies that they remember a good deal about what was going on when they left; for example, they remembered to apologize to the Professor for accidentally leaving the coats that they borrowed in Narnia.</p>

<p>The book also mentions that Mrs. Macready avoided the room. While I don't remember if it's explicitly stated in the text, I've always assumed that that implied that they remembered why they had entered the wardrobe in the first place (I could be wrong about that, though).</p>

<p>When they got back, did they remember ""where they had left off"" with their old life? Did they remember everything that they would have remembered when they left (e.g. what they had for lunch the day before they left, the fact that someone asked them to clean their room today, etc.)?</p>

<p>Similarly, after returning from Narnia in <em>Prince Caspian</em>, they apparently got on the train that they were planning on taking to begin with and carried on with their business. (Granted, their absence wasn't nearly as long that time).</p>

<p>I'm only interested in the first stanza for now. I have mixed feelings 
about the first stanza. I like the image of decrepit age being something tied to a dog's tail. It really serves to show how foreign age is to the poet's soul; it is simply not a part of him, but something he tows along.</p>

<p>I like the idea that age excites his imagination more, but when its song is dormant he must content himself with an old friend — Plato or Plotinus, interesting reading choices. He seems to be saying that Plato and Plotinus come in handy until the imagination is ready to soar.</p>

<p>But then, when the poet is ready to sing, when the imagination is ready to soar, there is no song, no beauty. Only this alternate possibility that things will go wrong, and the poet will be derided by a ""battered kettle at the heel"".</p>

<p>What does this phrase even mean? I can only think of a tea kettle. Why would it be battered? What image is he trying to show? What point is he trying to make?</p>

"Was Holden Caulfield molested as a child?","<p>In chapter 24, Holden goes to Mr. Antolini's place to stay for the night. He crashes on the couch, and suddenly is woken up by Mr. Antolini stroking his (Holden's) hair while he sleeps. There are, then, two passages that caught my eye:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I know more damn perverts, at schools and all, than anybody you ever met, and they're always being perverty when <em>I'm</em> around.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When something perverty like that happens, I start sweating like a bastard. That kind of stuff's happened to me about twenty times since I was a kid. I can't stand it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, throughout the whole book, I'd been getting the impression that Holden was a depressed individual — as in, actually clinically depressed, not just that ""that kind of stuff makes me depressed"" kinda talk he's always having — but was attributing it to his little brother Allie's death.  </p>

<p>Then this happens, right near the end of the book, and it seems like it connects a few more things: his apparent depression, why he's sexually awkward (see the scene with the prostitute, and how he describes how ""something always happens"" when he's about to lose his virginity), why he seems to hate adults a lot more than children and younger folks... and why he wants to protect the children as ""the catcher in the rye,"" as he describes to Phoebe in chapter 22.</p>

<p>Furthermore, Holden seems to actually get physically sick after the interaction with Mr. Antolini, mentioning he passed out, and almost vomited several times when he felt like laughing. This bit would suggest, I believe, a physical reaction to what might be, to some degree, repressed memories of past abuse.</p>

<p>Was Holden in fact molested as a child? Is there any other sort of evidence that I'm overlooking here? Perhaps from the book itself, or an earlier draft, or a note from the author? Or, given the many similarities between the narrative in <em>The Catcher in the Rye</em> and Salinger's early life (see <a href=""https://literature.stackexchange.com/q/209/3"">here</a>), is it possible that Salinger himself was molested as a child?</p>

<p>Have there been any cases where an author's later claims about the text were clearly refuted?</p>

<p><strong>Important note:</strong> I'm not asking about how authorial intent <em>in general</em> is related to meaning (that was already addressed in a linked post) - just how much weight later declarations that aren't clearly settled by the text should be given (like J. K. Rowling's claim).</p>

<p>It's been a few years since I read the book, but I didn't get the impression that the different narrators actually affect the way the story is told, where I would really expect an unreliable and in parts contradictory narrative.

I couldn't even really extract any characterisations of the individual narrators, or match the five people described above with the five different colours.</p>

<p>Is this background story and the use of the five different quotation marks just a gimmick or can we actually extract additional meaning from who narrates what part? What about the italicised part in the above quote? Seeing how much effort Danielewski put into every single detail of some of his other works, I'd be surprised if the narrative wasn't assigned carefully to the individual narrators, so I'm wondering whether the additional meaning is actually there but was just lost on me due to not paying enough attention?</p>

According to <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twilight_(novel_series)#Other_books"" rel=""noreferrer"">Wikipedia</a>, the reason Meyer never finished this project was due to her own change of heart about the story:</p>

They involved doing penance for a sin not yet committed, intense and fervent penance accompanied by scourging and flagellation, so as to build up, as it were, a store of credit. When the penance had reached the appropriate level for a particular sin, the penitent was granted absolution in advance, though he might never be called on to commit the sin. It was sometimes necessary to kill people, for example; and it was so much less troubling for the assassin if he could do so in a state of grace.</p>

"Why did the characters in ""No Exit"" agree to torment each other?","<p>Once the characters in <em>No Exit</em> realized that they were placed there to torment each other, why didn't they refuse to do so? When Joseph says ""eh bien, continuons"" (""very well, let's get on with it"") at the end, is he implicitly consenting to participate in this? What's the significance of his agreement (or at least lack of refusal) in Sartre's overall philosophy? In the context of the story (and Sartre's philosophy), could the characters <em>possibly</em> have refused and what might have happened if they had?</p>

"Political allegory in Lukyanenko's Watch series?","<p>The Watch series by Sergei Lukyanenko describes the often bloodless struggle between the Night Watch and the Day Watch. It's a sort of cold war in which each side is only permitted to attack members of the other side if they break the Treaty in some way, this rule being upheld by the Inquisition which stands above both Watches.</p>

<p>There's a great deal of discussion throughout the books of the nature of the Watches and the struggle between them. Anton's - and by extension, the reader's - nuanced perception changes quite a lot during the course of the series. After just having read a long conversation in <em>Twilight Watch</em> between Anton and Gesar about this, I was struck (not for the first time) by the thought:</p>

<p><strong>can the Night and Day Watches be interpreted as some kind of political allegory?</strong></p>

<p>I don't know much about the author's political views, but negativity towards America and the west comes across several times in the text, so perhaps the Watches can be seen as symbolising the two sides in the Cold War? Or perhaps they represent different political factions within Russia? (Again, I know nothing about Russian politics, so this may be a stupid suggestion.)</p>

<p><sub>I'm looking for answers based on <strong>connecting clues from the text to actual facts about politics.</strong> Authorial-intent answers with <strong>quotes from Lukyanenko</strong> would also be welcome, but please don't post answers just based on your own political views unless you can back them up with something more concrete. This is a literary question, not a political soapbox.</sub></p>

"Could Ozymandias be interpreted as referring to the power of the Church/pope?","<p>The poem's central line that establishes the theme of power:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Does the ""king of kings"" part happen to be a subtle reference to the English papacy by any chance? I don't know much about the European church system (not that I'm supposed to know anyway, given that I'm from South Asia), but it did come up in a few chapters of our History textbook. There were only 2/3 paragraphs at best on that topic and from what I've gathered, the Church used to wield more power than any king in Europe (I've no idea how much geographic area it spans). So basically the pope (the head of the Church) ruled over all the kings and could arguably be called the ""king of kings"". Sorry if I get anything horrendously wrong.</p>

<p>So, is Percy Shelley condemning the extent of the Church's power here? I'm aware this theory/interpretation is far too far-fetched to be what Percy really intended to convey, but it does explain the line somewhat.</p>

<h3>Note</h3>

<p>It seems that there has been an misunderstanding. All the answers below address whether the pope, at any point in history, used to be referred to as ""king of kings"" either informally or as an official title. But I never did suggest such a thing in the first place. I meant that because the pope had once been powerful I suppose calling him ""king of kings"" would not be too unreasonable. I was merely inviting the idea of the pope being a possible candidate for the ""king of kings"" Percy talks of here. I certainly didn't mean that the pope really could have ever been called so.</p>

<p>Again, don't get me wrong: I never claim the Pope is necessarily a <em>good</em> candidate for Ozymandias. I was simply suggesting the notion of that <strong><em>being possible to some extent</em></strong>. The very purpose of this question was opening this up to more interpretation. Note that I also say: ""I'm aware this theory/interpretation is far too far-fetched to be what Percy really intended to convey [...]"". I've admitted myself that I don't find the whole thing being very likely either.</p>

"What were John Galt's criteria for being invited to Galt's Gulch?","<p>Those who are in <strong>Galt's Gulch</strong> are there by invitation only. Dagny crashed the gate, but was clearly still on the future invite list. However, I find it interesting who got invited to Galt's Gulch and why. The obvious invitees are the high-performing titans of industry such as Hank Rearden, Dagny, Ellis Wyatt, and Ken Danagger. </p>

<p>But the more-surprising invitees include the following: </p>

<ul>
<li>the young brakeman of the Comet</li>
<li>the nameless writer -- ""fishwife"" in the valley (possibly an autobiographical insertion)</li>
<li>the young woman who owned the bakery shop and her two sons</li>
<li>Kay Ludlow (the actress)</li>
</ul>

<p>None of these were industrialists nor titans of industry. Though, we can safely assume that they were ideologically sound, which is to say they believed in meritocracy, capitalism, objective reality, etc. But if ideology is the only criterion, then is Rand suggesting that the few hundred people who lived in the valley were the ONLY people on earth with that ideology? Seems doubtful. Were they just lucky to have been discovered by one of the agents or a member of the valley? An elite few who had the right ideas <em>and</em> were lucky enough to know someone in Galt's secret network?</p>

<p>To be more specific, when a new character meets with Langdon, they might also remember his previous adventures but they never seem to mention... even in a casual conversation, and that makes me curious.<br>

<p>Here are my responses to the Guide for this type of question:</p>

<p><strong>When did you read the story, and how old was it?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Medium and appearance</strong></p>

<p>I do not remember what the cover looked like, but I remember it was a book, and not a magazine or a story from a textbook or anything like that.  My feeling was that it was a typical length for a YA book, probably no more that 200 pages.</p>

<p><strong>What language did you read it in, and was it translated?</strong></p>

<p>English, and I doubt if it was translated but you never know!</p>

<p><strong>Where did you read this story?</strong></p>

"Is there a canonical map of Thomas Hardy's Wessex?","<p>Most if not all of Thomas Hardy's novels are set in the fictional(ish) English region of <strong>Wessex</strong>.

<p>My edition of <em>Tess of the d'Urbervilles</em> includes a lengthy table mapping real locations to the fictional names they're given in the books.

"Did Lady Macbeth communicate signs of her instability prior to the blood scene?","<p>I'm looking back on Macbeth, and I'm wondering something that's piqued my interest again. There's a very well-known scene in Macbeth: the blood-spot scene, the hand-washing scene, and other such names. In it, Lady Macbeth goes... somewhat insane:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Out, damned spot! out, I say!--One: two: why, then, 'tis time to do't.--Hell is murky!--Fie, my lord, fie! a soldier, and afeard? What need we fear who knows it, when none can call our power to account?--Yet who would have thought the old man to have had so much blood in him.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Before this point, though, I'm struggling to figure out whether Lady Macbeth was foreshadowed to break under stress. She's mostly been removed from the focus of the play at this point, but Shakespeare draws our attention back to her with the intent to communicate that she, too, suffers for her crimes.</p>

<p>Was any breakdown of sanity foreshadowed or hinted at earlier in the play? Is there something I just missed, or is this supposed to be as sudden as it is in practice?</p>

<p>I'm trying to understand how the images in the last two lines are related to each other. So, the ""sparrowfall"" image is easy:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""'Sparrowfall' refers us to Matthew 10:29, where Christ is comforting
  the disciples by telling them that God's providence [...] covers
  everything, even the smallest details such as man himself would
  forget. For Hughes, this is no comfort to the old man at his death.""<br>

<p>Also, it might be helpful to note that Hamlet makes the same biblical reference, saying that ""there is a special providence in the fall of a sparrow"".</p>

<p>Then, when reading Matthew 10:29, we can also see that the ""sparrowfall"" is given in the context of commerce, and thus we can understand the meaning of ""natural economy"":</p>

"Is Paul Fry correct in saying that modern hermeneutic approaches largely developed due to the Protestant Reformation?","<p>In <a href=""https://oyc.yale.edu/english/engl-300/lecture-3"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">lecture 3</a> of his Introduction to the Theory of Literature Yale Open Course, Prof. Paul Fry makes the following claim:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>... the notion of hermeneutics arises primarily in religion first, specifically in the Christian tradition, but that isn’t to say that there hasn’t been, that there wasn’t long before the moment at which hermeneutics became important in Christianity, that there wasn’t centuries’ worth of Talmudic scholarship which is essentially also hermeneutic in nature–that is, to say concerned with the art and basis of interpretation.</p>
  
  <p>What gave rise in the Western world to what is called “hermeneutics” was in fact the Protestant Reformation. And there’s a lot of significance in that, I think, and I’ll try to explain why. You don’t really puzzle your head about questions of interpretation, how we determine the validity of interpretation and so on, until A) meaning becomes terribly important to you, and B) the ascertainment of meaning becomes difficult. You may say to yourself, “Well, isn’t it always the case that meaning is important and that meaning is hard to construe?” Well, not necessarily. If you are a person whose sacred scripture is adjudicated by the Pope and the occasional tribunal of church elders, you yourself don’t really need to worry very much about what scripture means. You are told what it means. It goes without saying therefore what it means. But in the wake of the Protestant Reformation when the question of one’s relationship with the Bible became personal and everyone was understood, if only through the local minister, to be engaged with coming to an understanding of what is after all pretty difficult–who on earth knows what the Parables mean and so on, and the whole of the Bible poses interpretative difficulties–then of course you are going to have to start worrying about how to interpret it. Needless to say, since it’s a sacred scripture, the meaning of it is important to you. You do want to know what it means. It can’t mean just anything. It’s crucial to you to know exactly what it means and why what it means is important.</p>

<p>Is this an accurate description of where hemeneutics came from? For example, is his implication that the Roman Catholic Church played little to no role in the development of Western hermeneutic methods correct?</p>

"Was Francisco d'Anconia's deliberate destruction of his competitors counterproductive to the purpose of the Strike?","<p>Related: <a href=""https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/5737/why-was-francisco-danconia-amused-by-ellis-wyatts-imminent-demise"">Why was Francisco d&#39;Anconia amused by Ellis Wyatt&#39;s imminent demise?</a></p>

<p>When describing what a playboy Francisco d'Anconia had supposedly become (including throwing wild and ridiculously expensive parties, his supposed womanizing, etc.), we find the following passage:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>... [Dagny Taggart] read the accounts of the business ventures he undertook at length intervals; the ventures were spectacularly successful <strong>and ruined his competitors</strong>, but he indulged in them as in an occasional sport, staging a sudden raid, then vanishing from the industrial scene for a year or two, leaving d'Anconia Copper to the management of his employees.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It turns out, of course, that he was actively destroying his company the entire time, as well as several of his competitors, Taggart Transcontinental, the Phoenix-Durango, Ellis Wyatt, and a host of other businesses.</p>

<p>One particularly notable example was the San Sebastian Mines incident, which both Dagny and Jim Taggart later described as a ""rotten swindle."" When Dagny went to see d'Anconia to confront him about the incident, she accused him of knowing full well that the mines would eventually be nationalized (and were of little value anyway):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""You knew, before you bought that property, that Mexico was in the hands of a looters' government... you knew that they'd seize those mines sooner or later. What you were after is your American stockholders.""<br>
  <strong>""That's true.""</strong> He was looking straight at her, he was not smiling, his face was earnest. He added, ""That's part of the truth.""...<br>
  ""You had exhausted every other form of depravity and sought a new thrill by swindling people like Jim and his friends, in order to watch them squirm. I don't know what sort of corruption could make anyone enjoy that, but that's what you came to New York to see, at the right time.""<br>
  ""They certainly provided a spectacle of squirming on the grand scale. Your brother James in particular.""<br>
  ""They're rotten fools, but in this case their only crime was that they trusted you. They trusted your name and your honor.""<br>
  Again, she saw the look of earnestness and knew with certainty that it was genuine, when he said, ""Yes. They did. I know it.""<br>
  ""And do you find it amusing?""<br>
  ""No. I don't find it amusing at all.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He <em>was</em>, however (as pointed out in the linked Q&amp;A), vastly amused by the destruction of the Mexican Planners, and even more amused by the fact that Ellis Wyatt was going to be wiped out. He was also fully aware that the Phoenix-Durango railroad was wiped out as a direct result of his actions, and that Dan Conway had been forced into retirement.</p>

<p>Given that part of the point of the Strike in the first place was to prove that looter governments would eventually collapse when they were deprived of people to enable them, was the fact that Francisco d'Anconia (and, for that fact, Ragnar Danneskjöld) was deliberately destroying the economy contrary to that goal?</p>

"Opposite of accismus in Julius Caesar","<p>A preliminary definition: <strong>accismus</strong> is a rhetorical device in which the rhetor turns down an offer for something that he/she earnestly desires (usually in order to come off as humble/temperate/etc).</p>

<p>Earlier today, I read the following passage from Shakespeare’s Julius Caesar, in which Brutus appeals to the Roman public just after assassinating Caesar. He says</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>...as I slew my best lover [Caesar] for the good of Rome, I have the same dagger for myself, when it shall please my country to need my death.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The gullible crowd, of course, cries “Live, Brutus, live, live!” It struck me that this rhetorical strategy is, in some sense, the opposite (or converse) of accismus - rather than turning down something that he wants, Brutus makes an offer that he does not want to be accepted.</p>

<p>Of course, Brutus is the most honorable and sincere character in Julius Caesar, so this tactic may not have been deliberate. However, we can see it in use even in everyday conversation when one person offers something to another person not because they sincerely want them to have it or have that person’s best interests in mind, but because they want to seem generous. For example:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Person A:</strong> I’m really upset; my grandmother died this weekend.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Person B:</strong> Wow, I’m so sorry. Is there anything I can do to help?</p>

<p>Clearly, there’s nothing Person B can do to help, but she’s offering anyways.</p>

<p>Then, I think the food weighed down his car too much for him to drive it, so he begins to eat some of the food so that he can drive the car.

This seems like a <em>highly</em> abnormal reaction to that kind of a personal tragedy at a minimum.</p>

<p>Or was Peter merely unaware of Susan's current mental state when he stated that she's no longer a friend of Narnia (given that he couldn't exactly visit earth to see how she was handling the whole thing)? But, if that's the case, how do we account for C. S. Lewis's comments on her being in a particularly silly phase of life?</p>

"How does Emeth's presence in Aslan's Country in The Last Battle fit in with the rest of C. S. Lewis's theology?","<p>In <em>The Last Battle</em>, Emeth was a soldier from Calormene who worshiped Tash. Apparently, he <em>thought</em> that Tash was basically like Aslan, so Aslan interpreted Emeth's worship of Tash as actually being worship of him. Aslan tells Emeth in chapter 15 that ""I take to me the services which thou hast done to Tash... if any man swear by him and keep his oath for the oath's sake, it is by me that he has truly sworn, though he know it not, and it is I who reward him.""</p>

<p>Obviously, Emeth ends up going to Aslan's Country.</p>

<p>What's the theological significance/basis of this? How did this reflect C. S. Lewis's broader views on salvation? Does Lewis think that sincerity is ""enough"" for salvation?</p>

"Was C. S. Lewis condemning nuclear weapons in The Magician's Nephew?","<p>Aslan says the following in <em>The Magician's Nephew</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""It is not certain that some wicked one of your race will not find out a secret as evil as the Deplorable Word <strong>and use it to destroy all living things</strong>. And <strong>soon, very soon,</strong> before you are an old man and an old woman, great nations of your world will be ruled by tyrants who care no more for joy and justice and mercy than the Empress Jadis. Let your world beware. That is the warning.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The first line <em>could</em> imply that whatever secret hadn't been discovered yet, but it could also mean that it <em>had</em> been discovered, they just hadn't used it yet. Was Lewis thinking of a particular invention (e.g. nuclear weapons or other WMD), or was he thinking of a hypothetical future invention? If it was the former, is Lewis claiming that nuclear weapons and/or other WMD are intrinsically evil?</p>

<p>Also, was Lewis thinking of a specific tyrant (perhaps Josef Stalin)? Or does the fact that he uses plural (tyrant<strong>s</strong>) indicate that he's thinking of several different tyrants?</p>

<p>Are these necessarily the same people (i.e. is the person who discovers/uses the equivalent of the deplorable word necessarily one of the tyrants)?</p>

"Why does Emmanuel Goldstein's book in 1984 have a title page?","<p>I was rereading 1984 when I noticed something amiss in this passage: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A heavy black volume, amateurishly bound, with no name or title on the cover. The print also looked slightly irregular. The pages were worn at the edges, and fell apart easily, as though the book had passed through many hands. The inscription on the title-page ran:
  THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF OLIGARCHICAL COLLECTIVISM by Emmanuel Goldstein</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Distracted by the wear-and-tear of the book, by the afterglow of his initiation into the brotherhood, Winston fails to ask:</p>

<p>Why does a copy of the most-hated book by the most-hated author still have its title-page? In full capital letters?
A title which arouses instant suspicion and would damn the holder if anyone even glimpses at it? </p>

<p>My personal belief is that George Orwelle's' intends to foreshadow that, the Brotherhood as described by O'Brien, is a fabrication.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You have imagined, probably, a huge underworld of conspirators, meeting secretly in cellars, scribbling messages on walls, recognizing one another by codewords or by special movements of the hand. Nothing of the kind exists. The members of the Brotherhood have no way of recognizing one another, and it is impossible for any one member to be aware of the identity of more than a few others. Goldstein himself, if he fell into the hands of the Thought Police, could not give them a complete list of members, or any information that would lead them to a complete list. No such list exists. The Brotherhood cannot be wiped out because it is not an organization in the ordinary sense. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>If the organization as described by O'Brien actually existed, one member in the brotherhood would have expurgated the title-page, or replaced the inscription with something far less obvious and offensive. They don't have the luxury of religious reverence towards their book, they can't treat it like a bible; they would have taken a basic-- and safe-- precaution. </p>

<p>Regardless of the Inner Party's motives, whether it was as an oversight or their way of strengthening Winston's entrapment-- leaving the title in the book seems like a masterful way to quietly foreshadow O'Brien's planned betrayal.</p>

<p>Or am I wrong in assuming that level of caution is needed? Would the real-or-imagined Brotherhood actually be fine with leaving that title-page in their book? Why?</p>

"What explains Maxim Kammerer's superhuman physical condition in ""Prisoners of Power"" (aka ""The Inhabited Island"")?","<p>Throughout the novel, Maxim is shown to have an almost superhuman physical condition, easily performing unthinkable feats, which include, but aren't limited to</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Being able to run for a very long time without fatigue</p></li>
<li><p>Being able to carry a (heavy) armed man while running</p></li>
<li><p>Reflexes considerably faster than those of the Inhabitants of Saraksh, able to dispatch ~10 men within a few seconds</p></li>
<li><p>Incredible resistance to radiation - able to swim in a radioactive river, and eat a radioactive fish with no harmful consequences</p></li>
<li><p>Able to survive 7 (?) bullets from a very close range directly to his torso; at least 2 of them should be fatal as per an assessment given later by a doctor</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The list may be amended, but this is the general shape of things. The novel is set in the 22nd century, and Maxim implies all humans are considerably improved physically by that time (he also states later in the novel that prolonged exposure to the climate of Saraksh has weakened him).</p>

<p>However, the novella <em>Space Mowgli</em> (aka <em>The Kid</em>, ""Малыш"") is set in the same time period (in-universe), and its characters do not seem to be as developed physically as Maxim (if they were, they wouldn't be as challenged when playing with the Kid), which leaves two possibilities:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Only the Free Search Group members are as physically developed, possibly due to some tampering with their bodies and stuff (for which there's no evidence in what I've read so far).</p></li>
<li><p>It's an inconsistency in the writing, because <em>Prisoners of Power</em> and <em>Space Mowgli</em> were written separately in different years (were they? I'm not sure). </p></li>

"Is there a relationship between Edward VI and The Legend of Sleepy Hollow?","<p>In my office there is a guy named ""Ed"".  When he is not around, some of the other guys say to those who ask for him that ""We are Ed-less"".  It sounds like an Irish accent saying ""headless"".</p>

<p><strong>I wondered if there was part of the Ichabod Crane story, ""the Headless Horseman"", that drew from a historical ""Edward"".  Does it?</strong></p>

<p>My thoughts were:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ichabod means ""glory is lost"" and Edward summarized the charges against Somerset as ""ambition, vainglory, ..."", and noted at his uncle's death that ""[he] had his head cut off"".</li>
<li>Ichabod's rival is the younger, Abraham 'Brom Bones' Van Brunt. Edward's father was Henry VIII, quite the father with his many wives, (arguably a veritable Abraham), and the legitimate antecedent to the throne.  Just as the line of Henry won, the line of Brom bones won.  </li>
<li>The primary competition in the time of Edward was the war on Scotland called ""the rough wooing"", and the primary competition in the legend is the wooing of Katrina Van Tassel, the daughter of a wealthy farmer.</li>
</ul>

<p>These have the ""weak smell"" of a connection, but I am no literary scholar, nor am I deeply familiar with the history of Edward Tudor.</p>

<p>If I did not know the history of the cold war between the US and Russia, and the lyrics to ""Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer"", then I would not know the strong connection of one to the other, likely driving unconscious connection and extraordinary popularity of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolph_the_Red-Nosed_Reindeer_(song)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Gene Autry's version the song</a>, released in 1949, about 2 years after the start of the cold war.  I'm wondering if Sleepy Hollow worked in a similar way, but about a 150 years earlier.  </p>

"How do publishers determine how much to charge for audiobooks relative to their printed version?","<p>Amazon.com prices for a few random books as of 10/5/2017:</p>

<p><em>Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</em> - paperback $9.29, hardcover $17.89, audio CD $38.98</p>

<p><em>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</em> - paperback $8.34, hardcover $16.41, audio CD $28.46</p>

<p><em>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone</em> - $7.89 for the paperback, $17.06 audio CD</p>

<p><em>The War of Art</em> - paperback $10.20, MP3 audiobook $9.79 (slightly cheaper)</p>

<p>The two obvious criticisms of what I have above are the fact that these are the Amazon.com prices (rather than the publisher price), and that this is a limited number of books (so it may not represent overall trends).</p>

<p>I don't have any hard statistics on this, but it seems to me that that audiobooks (with some exceptions) tend to be dramatically more expensive than the print edition of the books. Why is that?</p>

<p>This seems to hold true even with electronic versions (e.g. purchases from Audible.com or iTunes), so the physical cost of producing the CDs doesn't appear to entirely explain the cost differences.</p>

<p>I'm also not convinced that the additional cost of creating the audiobook in the first place entirely accounts for its price. I do understand that the publisher needs to recoup the cost of producing it in the first place in order to make it worthwhile to sell it, but it seems like that cost would be distributed among a large number of people (at least for popular audiobooks like <em>Harry Potter</em>). Also, the marginal cost of producing additional units it relatively low - selling 2 million units isn't twice as expensive as selling 1 million units. Finally, the cost of producing the goods in the first place isn't really related to the price that people are willing to pay for it.</p>

<p>With that said, what is the logic behind these prices? How do the publishers typically price audiobooks relative to paper and hardcover books and why? How does this compare to Amazon.com's pricing?</p>

<p>My understanding is that Amazon.com does dynamic pricing, so my guess is that they're doing some kind of regression analysis to get an objective function relating price to profit somehow and then doing single-variable optimization on that. But this doesn't really explain how they came up with the approximate price range to begin with, or how the publishers came up with the list price.</p>

"Why is the last title in Proust's ""Search For Lost Time"" not consistently translated as ""Time Found Again""?","<p>Marcel Proust wrote a seven-volume French novel called <em>A la Recherche du Temps Perdu</em>. The original French title of the last volume was <em>Le Temps Retrouvé</em>.</p>

<p>It seems to me that in these titles Proust intended an allusion to one of the aphorisms that Ben Franklin included in his book <a href=""https://books.google.com/books?id=8_c_vS40kMcC&amp;pg=PA32&amp;dq=lost%20time%20is%20never%20found%20again&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiqhe7Dr8jYAhXLMSYKHfg5AM84ChDoAQhKMAY#v=onepage&amp;q=%22lost%20time%20is%20never%20found%20again%22&amp;f=false"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>Poor Richard’s Almanac</em></a>:</p>

  <p>Lost time is never found again.</p>

<p>In the French translation of Franklin's book, <a href=""https://books.google.com/books?id=TjYUAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=franklin%20Bonhomme%20Richard&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjZgdnGiszYAhXEg-AKHdS5AgEQ6AEIJzAA#v=snippet&amp;q=perdu&amp;f=false"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>Feuillets du Bonhomme Richard</em></a>, this aphorism is translated as:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Le tems perdu ne se retrouve jamais</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All of the important words in this translation also appear in Proust’s titles, and the meaning of the titles seems to resonate the meaning of the aphorism. This supports the conclusion that Proust was alluding to Franklin’s words as they appeared in the <em>Feuillets du Bonhomme Richard</em>.</p>

<p>If that’s right, and Proust intended to allude to Franklin’s words, then it would seem natural that the English translations of the titles should revert to Franklin’s words. The titles should be translated <em>The Search For Lost Time</em> and <em>Time Found Again</em>.</p>

<p>Why should they be? Suppose that a French author wrote a book called <em>The Sound And The Fury</em>, and that an English translation was to be published. It would be common sense to call the English translation <em>The Sound And The Fury</em> rather than <em>Noise and Rage</em>, even if <em>Noise and Rage</em> was an equally accurate translation of the French title. The reason it would be common sense is that the French title suggested to French readers some connection to Hamlet’s soliloquy, and the best English title would preserve this suggestion, as <em>The Sound And The Fury</em> does, but as <em>Noise and Rage</em> fails to do. Of course other titles might actually be chosen, and perhaps for good reason; but common sense would suggest <em>The Sound And The Fury</em>. </p>

<p>In the case of Proust’s books, common sense did not prevail. In English translations published over the years Proust’s last title, Le Temps Retrouvé, has been rendered variously:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href=""https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0141180366"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>Finding Time Again</em></a></p></li>
<li><p><a href=""https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B000MMQ03W"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>The Past Recaptured</em></a></p></li>
<li><p><a href=""https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0375753125"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>Time Regained</em></a></p></li>
</ul>

<p>This strikes me as strange. Why did the English translations not use Franklin’s words?</p>

<p>One possibility is that they did not believe, and perhaps did not even consider, that Proust was alluding to Franklin. Another possible reason would seem to be that they did believe that Proust was alluding to Franklin but thought other phrases made better titles.</p>

<p>Apparently, evidence relevant to this question might include:</p>

<ul>
<li>logical reasoning</li>
<li>the words of Proust and his editors, translators and publishers, perhaps expressed in diaries, correspondence or even advertising</li>
<li>similar words attributed to other authors before Franklin's time, or contemporary with him, suggesting that the idea (that lost time cannot be found again) was already a commonplace and that the similarity in wording (between Franklin’s aphorism and Proust’s titles) is a meaningless coincidence</li>

<blockquote>
  <p>What she would engage to do towards augmenting their income was next to be considered; and here it plainly appeared, that though Edward was not her only son, he was by no means her eldest; for while Robert was inevitably endowed with a thousand pounds a year, not the smallest objection was made against Edward's taking orders for the sake of two hundred and fifty at the utmost; nor was anything promised either for the present or in future, beyond the ten thousand pounds, which had been given with Fanny.</p>

<p>So did Edward have 2 or 10 thousand pounds? What would be the interest of his money combined with Elinor's? And plus with the maximum of 250 pounds per year from his work, how much income did they both enjoy? And was it enough to live on?</p>

"What is a ""fetish man"" in African tribal culture?","<p>I'm translating Robert E. Howard's short story ""The Hyena"". It was published in 1927. There is a character called Senecoza and Howard (and the protagonist) always refer to him as ""the fetish man"". And this guy can turn himself into a hyena, but the reader only learns this fact at the end of the story. Now, I know ""fetish"" means idols or power objects. But I'm not sure what a fetish man is exactly. Is he someone like a voodoo priest? Does he do magic? This is the only bit of information I could manage to find: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A fetish man was thought to be more than human; he was divine, even infallible. Thus did chiefs, kings, priests, prophets, and church rulers eventually wield great power and exercise unbounded authority.<br>

"Meaning of a stanza in Byron's Don Juan","<p><a href=""https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Don_Juan_(Byron)/Canto_the_Sixth#LII"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Canto 6, stanza 52</a>, from Byron's <a href=""https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Don_Juan_(Byron)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>Don Juan</em></a>: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Dudù, as has been said, was a sweet creature,<br>
       Not very dashing, but extremely winning,<br>
  With the most regulated charms of feature,<br>
       Which painters cannot catch <strong>like faces sinning<br>
  Against proportion -- the wild strokes of nature<br>
       Which they hit off at once in the beginning,<br>
  Full of expression, right or wrong, that strike,<br>
  And pleasing or unpleasing, still are like</strong>.  </p>

<p>What is the meaning of this all in plain English - especially the part in bold?  </p>

<p>My attempts at deciphering this: </p>

<ol>
<li><p>She had a symmetrical face (""regulated charms of feature"")? Hm.. Or, to the contrary, her face and body were not symmetrical?  </p></li>
<li><p>Painters fail to reflect such ""asymmetrical charms"" in their paintings? In comparison, they fail to reflect ""faces that sin against proportion"". </p></li>
<li><p>Painters ""<a href=""https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hit_off"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">hit off</a>"" = ""describe in few characteristic strokes of a brush"" - in the beginning of their work upon a portrait. </p></li>
<li><p>What does ""that strike"" refer to? The strokes left on the canvas by the painters ""strike"" the viewers as very interesting/beautiful? </p></li>
<li><p>The phrase ""still are like"" leaves me completely baffled. Such strokes on the canvas, reflecting the irregular but characteristic features, are all alike, no matter who is being painted? </p></li>
</ol>

<p>I've reread the stanza many times but I cannot get a grip on its meaning. Once I think I understand some particular phrase, the general meaning starts to crawl apart because it fails to dovetail with other phrases.</p>

<p>Which of these is the better way to scan the line? Perhaps it was intended to stand out from the rest by its different rhythm for some reason? Or perhaps ""upon"" was pronounced with the stress on the first syllable in Hardy's time? Any light thrown upon this would be much appreciated.</p>

<p>In the passage above, Galt explains to his tormentors how to fix the torture device that had broken and they knew not how to fix. Although the irony makes a powerful statement, Galt is in fact violating his sacred creed by giving his enemies the tools of his own destruction.</p>

"Did Jean Rhys recognize her fictional portrait in Ford Madox Ford's *When the Wicked Man*?","<p>Jean Rhys's affair with <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Madox_Ford"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Ford Madox Ford</a>, and its effects on her marriage to Jean Lenglet as well as on Ford's relationship with Stella Bowen, have been variously cataloged by each of this foursome:</p>

<ul>
<li>In <em>Quartet</em> aka <em>Postures</em> (1928), Rhys depicted Ford and Bowen as Hugh and Lois Heidler; Stephan Zelli is Lenglet, and Rhys herself is the protagonist, Marya Zelli.</li>
<li>Ford followed soon after with <em>When the Wicked Man</em> (1931), portraying Rhys as Lola Porter, a drunken journalist who takes advantage of the generosity of Joseph Notterdam (Ford) and his wife Elspeth (Bowen).</li>
<li>Lenglet wrote an autobiographical novel, called variously <em>In de Strik</em>, <em>Barred</em>, and <em>Sous les Verrous</em>, published 1932 in Dutch and English, and 1933 in French. </li>
<li>Finally, Bowen's 1941 autobiography, <em>Drawn from Life</em>, provides her take on the affair. </li>
</ul>

<p>Rhys herself translated the manuscript of <em>Sous les Verrous</em> into English. In his article ""<a href=""https://www.jstor.org/stable/3831159?read-now=1&amp;seq=9#page_scan_tab_contents"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Jean Rhys and the Dutch Connection</a>"" (<em>Journal of Modern Literature</em> vol. 11, no. 1, 1984, pp. 159–173), Martien Kappers-Den Hollander has pointed out that Rhys made several changes: for example, cutting out all references to the character representing Bowen and softening the portrayal of her own counterpart. Lenglet in turn used the English translation as the basis for his Dutch translation. The French version, however, used his original manuscript. So by comparing the French original to the English translation, and by considering the changes Rhys made, we can gauge Rhys's reaction to Lenglet's portrayal of the affair.</p>

<p>Rhys refused to read Bowen's <em>Drawn from Life</em>, on the very sensible grounds that ""I was quite certain that Stella's opinion of me wouldn't be pleasant to read"". This is mentioned in another <a href=""https://jeanrhysreviewdotorg.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/measure-for-measure-quartet-and-when-the-wicked-man.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">article</a> by Hollander, ""Measure for Measure: <em>Quartet</em> and <em>When the Wicked Man</em>"" (<em>Jean Rhys Review</em>, vol. 2, no. 2, 1998, pp. 2–16). In the footnotes to this second article, Hollander says that Rhys eventually did read Arthur Mizener's biography of Ford, <em>The Saddest Story</em> (London: The Bodley Head, 1971), which draws upon Stella's account of the affair. Rhys was predictably upset at how Bowen depicted her. </p>

<p>I have been unable, however, to find any evidence either way whether Rhys ever read <em>When the Wicked Man</em>.  Do we know whether Rhys ever read Ford's novel and recognized herself in it? If so, what was her reaction to this fictionalized representation?  </p>

"Can the social commentary in ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" be applied to the present?","<p>Recently, I have picked up ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" after reading glowing reviews of the book.</p>

<p>However, as I read the book further, I felt that I have completely misunderstood the points it was trying to make - rather, I did not understand them at all. After some research, I have found the most common explanation: the book is a kind of commentary on the society in the US at the time.</p>

<p>This argument does not seem to be particularly fulfilling. After all, if all it was is a commentary on the 1970s, why the appraisal that the book still receives? The fact that it was adapted to a movie almost 30 years later tells me the same.</p>

<p>Perhaps I am missing a crucial point of the book, which didn't seem to contain any plot. That alone is not a big problem, as there are many books without a clear narrative, but combined with the style of writing it made reading this book a challenge.</p>

<p>Cahalen Morrison and Eli West released an album called ""Our Lady of the Tall Trees."" The <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYQlhLEJ5jc"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">titular song</a> (<a href=""http://www.songlyrics.com/cahalen-morrison-eli-west/our-lady-of-the-tall-trees-lyrics/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">lyrics</a>), however, contains a somewhat unclear purpose. I'm having trouble determining if the song is intended to just be as carefree and jovial as it sounds, or if there's some deeper meaning that I'm missing. </p>

<p>This starts with a pretty simple question: <em>who</em>, exactly, is the Lady of the Tall Trees? The song doesn't really seem to want to go into any level of detail. All it has to say about this topic is...:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>...Our lady of a lot<br>
  Said our lady of this and that<br>
  And other things that we forgot  </p>
  
  <p>...Our lady of the not<br>

  And other fancy things she bought</p>

"The Piper at the Gates of Dawn, and Wayfarers All","<p>In The Wind in the Willows, Kenneth Grahame's magisterial work, the first half of the book is mostly given over to the adventures of Mole and Ratty (although we are introduced to Badger and Mr. Toad). It ends quietly in chapter 5 (<em>Dulce Domum</em>), with Mole (accompanied by Ratty) finding his old and long-neglected home.</p>

<p>The second half of the book, quite rightly, deals with the amazing (and I suspect highly embellished) adventures of Mr. Toad, of which I am sure you are entirely familiar. However, embedded in these stories are two highly reflective chapters, <em>The Piper at the Gates of Dawn</em> and <em>Wayfarers All</em>.</p>

<p>Chapter 7 (<em>The Piper at the Gates of Dawn</em>) deals with Mole and Ratty's frantic search for Otter's missing son, Portly. They eventually find him on an island, sleeping at the feet of the demigod, Pan, who Grahame personifies as the protector of animals, and they give him due worship. This indicates that the animals follow a far more ancient religion than the Christianity hinted at in chapter 5 (<em>Dulce Domum</em>). Ratty is thoroughly taken up with the experience, so Mole rows him and Portly back home.</p>

<p>Chapter 9 (<em>Wayfarers All</em>), deals with Ratty's restlessness, and his desire to expand his horizons, and explore a world of which he has little knowledge. He chances on another rat (a true rat, rather than a water vole), and they strike up a conversation. The rat is actually a sailor who has decided to give up the sea and settle down, but he regales Ratty with tales of far-off lands, and Ratty decides that this is the very life for him, and tries to abandon his home (and his friend) and take to the sea. Fortunately, Mole realises that something is wrong and manages to rescue him from his mania.</p>

<p>Now, what are these chapters for? Why did Grahame write them? Are they just intermezzi in a three-act comic opera about Toad, or is there some other significance? As a child, I found <em>The Piper at the Gates of Dawn</em> utterly enchanting, but <em>Wayfarers All</em> bored me, and I usually skipped it. Now that I am well into my middle-age, I can see the relevance of it, and I wish that I had been more adventurous in my youth, but when I was a child, its meaning was lost on me, so what is it doing in a book intended for children?</p>

<p>A related (and perhaps more important) question is: are there any parallels in adult fiction, preferably (but not necessarily) pre-dating this book (first published in 1908)? If so, what purpose do they serve, apart from providing a counterpoint to more exciting chapters?</p>

"Are ""choose your own adventure"" books literature or games?","<p>This question concerns ""Choose Your Own Adventure"" books. These are books that start out as a normal story, but then ask the reader to make a choice. (The book will say something to the effect of ""turn to page 8 if yes, page 9 if no""). In this fashion, the story expands like a tree. </p>

<p>It seems to me that there are two different ways to think about choose your own adventure books.</p>

<p>The first is to treat choose your own adventure books as a collection of multiple versions of the same story. Let's take a hypothetical story with one choice: do you (the reader) enter the magical portal that takes you to Narnia? At this choice, two versions of the story are created: one where the reader enters Narnia and one where the reader doesn't. If a story has a lot of choices, then a lot of different versions of the story are created. While the different versions of the story can be compared, the act of the reader choosing isn't considered in the analysis of the stories' meaning. In this sense, choose your own adventure games are essentially the same as traditional literature.</p>

<p>The second way of looking at ""Choose Your Own Adventure"" books is by analyzing them as games. This means looking at questions like ""how to readers make choices"", or ""how does the act of making a choice affect the meaning of the story."" </p>

<p>My question is: how do scholars and theorists of literature think about ""choose your own adventure"" books? Where do they fall on the literature game spectrum that I just outlined? If there is a debate among scholars, I would accept an answer that outlines the different perspectives in this debate.</p>

<p>The series was originally written by Scott Ciencin for four books (<em>Faceless</em>, <em>No Fear</em>, <em>Nemesis</em>, and <em>Incarnate</em>). The first three of these were also printed and sold by Random House.</p>

<p>At the time, readers were urged to try and figure out the Lurker's true identity. In <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/19970810122940/http://www.randomhouse.com/lurkerfiles/incarnate/printeincarnate16.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the last chapter written by Ciencin</a>, we get: </p>

  <p>""Now you know,"" the Lurker said.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>-- but the reader does not get to learn the Lurker's identity.</p>

<p>From this point, the series was continued by Marc Cerasini (<em>Apparition</em>, <em>Triad</em>, <em>Clandestine</em>). The books got kind of wonky under Cerasini, veering from web-focused thriller/mystery into SF/F.</p>

<p>From October 1997 to January 1998, readers were exhorted to ""Get ready for the Lurker Files finale!"". However, the finale never came, and the Lurker's identity was never revealed.</p>

I'm curious about this tradition, since it's one of few occasions I've been to where the reading of a poem (other than grace) is an important part of a meal.</p>

"What are the ""old euphemisms"" in The Great Gatsby?","<p>In chapter 6 of <em>The Great Gatsby</em>, Nick describes Daisy's reaction to the people of West Egg:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But the rest offended her—and inarguably, because it wasn’t a gesture but an emotion. She was appalled by West Egg, this unprecedented “place.” that Broadway had begotten upon a Long Island fishing village—<strong>appalled by its raw vigor that chafed under the old euphemisms</strong> and by the too obtrusive fate that herded its inhabitants along a short-cut from nothing to nothing. She saw something awful in the very simplicity she failed to understand.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm interested in the part in bold, which says that Daisy was ""appalled by its raw vigor that chafed under the old euphemisms"".  What are the ""old euphemisms"" being referred to?  I've wondered about this for years.</p>

<p>A euphemism is where you use one word as a substitute for a more offensive word.  But I don't think Fitzgerald is referring to literal euphemism here.  I have one theory: perhaps he means that rich people have upper-class families have a way of masking their hedonistic tendencies.  The new-money people of West Egg, on the other hand, are more ostentatious about their hedonism.  Is this what Fitzgerald is talking about?</p>

How significant are these essays? They obviously help in exploring the themes and messages of the novel, but how do they fit in the definition of fiction?</p>

  <p><em>Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyám</em> is the title that Edward FitzGerald gave to his translation of a selection of poems, originally written in Persian and numbering about a thousand, attributed to Omar Khayyám (1048–1131), a Persian poet, mathematician and astronomer.</p>

<p>Was Edward FitzGerald the first to collect these poems together and publish them in a unified work, or had there been previous published volumes (in any language) of <em>collected</em> works of Omar Khayyám?

<p>In this sermon, John Winthrop compares the American colonists to ""a city upon a hill"":</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We shall find that the God of Israel is among us, when ten of us shall be able to resist a thousand of our enemies; when He shall make us a praise and glory that men shall say of succeeding plantations, ""may the Lord make it like that of New England."" For we must consider that we shall be as a city upon a hill. The eyes of all people are upon us. So that if we shall deal falsely with our God in this work we have undertaken, and so cause Him to withdraw His present help from us, we shall be made a story and a by-word through the world. We shall open the mouths of enemies to speak evil of the ways of God, and all professors for God's sake. We shall shame the faces of many of God's worthy servants, and cause their prayers to be turned into curses upon us till we be consumed out of the good land whither we are going. </p>

<p>What point is John Winthrop trying to make here by referencing ""a city upon a hill""? How would this have been interpreted by his audience? </p>

<p>I'm asking this question because this passage tends to be interpreted by modern audiences as one of the first instances of American exceptionalism. I'm trying to get a sense of whether that is an after the fact interpretation or a reflection of how the sermon was interpreted at the time it was created.</p>

"What's the symbolism in The Twelve Days of Christmas?","<p>The popular Christmas song ""The Twelve Days of Christmas"" has many different versions, but they're usually something along the lines of the following (final verse, which includes all the others):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On the twelfth day of Christmas my true love sent to me:<br>
  Twelve drummers drumming,<br>
  Eleven pipers piping,<br>
  Ten lords a-leaping,<br>
  Nine ladies dancing,<br>
  Eight maids a-milking,<br>
  Seven swans a-swimming,<br>
  Six geese a-laying,<br>
  Five gold rings,<br>
  Four calling birds,<br>
  Three French hens,<br>
  Two turtle doves,<br>

<p><strong>What do these choices of gifts symbolise?</strong> What's the deeper significance of each of the twelve types of people, animals, or objects? I seem to remember reading about a Christian significance (the twelve drummers are the twelve apostles, the four calling birds are the four evangelists, and so on). <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Twelve_Days_of_Christmas_(song)#Meanings_of_the_gifts"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikipedia</a> also mentions an interpretation in terms of Catholic catechism, but also cites a source claiming that this is incorrect.

"Does V reference Stanislaw Lem's ""His Master's Voice"", and if so, why?","<p>I've recently been reading and re-reading Alan Moore and David Lloyd's <em>V for Vendetta</em>. After having skimmed through it multiple times and settling a few questions I had about the continuity, only one question remains. In volume I, chapter 2, <em>The Voice</em>, on page 13 the following conversation occurs:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Nsn3k.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Nsn3k.jpg"" alt=""V and Evey talk about music""></a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>... they eradicated <em>some</em> cultures more <em>thoroughly</em> than they did <em>others</em>.<br>
  No <em>Tamla</em> and no <em>Trojan</em>. No <em>Billie Holiday</em> or <em>Black Uhuru</em>...<br>
  Just <strong><em>His Master's Voice</em></strong>. Every hour. On the hour.<br>
  We'll have to see what we can do about that...</p>
</blockquote>

<p><sub>Italics authors', bold emphasis and <em>choice of capitalisation</em> mine</sub></p>

<p>V says ""his master's voice"", which is also the title of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/His_Master%27s_Voice_(novel)"" rel=""noreferrer"">the novel by Stanislaw Lem</a>.</p>

<p>I can see that V is most likely talking about the order in which the citizens of post-war Britain live - the oppression, constant surveillance, fascism, etc. V's primary goal throughout the novel is to make people raise their heads and pave their own way with their own decisions, as opposed to their masters' voice.</p>

<p>But still I find the choice of words here peculiar. Having skimmed through Lem's novel's description on Wikipedia I can see that it is not exactly about the same things as <em>V for Vendetta</em>. There is a bit about ""criticizing Cold War military and political decision-making as corrupting the ethical conduct of scientists"", but as I said, this is not what <em>V for Vendetta</em> is about.</p>

<p>So here comes my question: is this quote a conscious reference to Stanislaw Lem's <em>His Master's Voice</em>? If so, how exactly are the two books linked? If not, what explains this choice of words (for instance, ""<em>their</em> master's voice"" would be more suitable, I think)?</p>

"Are there any recorded discrepancies between The Odyssey as oral tradition and The Odyssey as Homer transcribed it?","<p><a href=""https://muse.jhu.edu/article/214040"" rel=""noreferrer"">The Odyssey began as oral tradition</a>, and was later transcribed by someone we now call ""Homer."" Disregarding the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeric_Question"" rel=""noreferrer"">Homeric Question</a> concerning the identity of the person who transcribed these works, it recently occurred to me...</p>

<p>Since The Odyssey began as oral tradition, it must naturally have evolved over time. Transcription of oral tradition is an imperfect process, and having been passed by memory and by oral education, small changes are bound to accrue. Additionally, any specific player/orator has control over their performance, and individual changes as an individual deemed necessary are also likely.</p>

<p>It also seems plausible that multiple copies of at least <em>parts</em> of The Odyssey should exist: that ""Homer"" and Homer alone should feel the need to write them down seems counter-intuitive and inexplicable. It would be surprising to me to learn that <em>only</em> Homer bothered to write any portion of The Odyssey down. </p>

<p>At a minimum, if multiple people had versions of The Odyssey in their memory that <em>differed</em> from Homer's, I'd expect to find an account of that somewhere. There are a great number of ways that changes and differences could have been recorded and retained; that none of them seem to be mentioned anywhere confuses me.</p>

<p>Are there different copies of parts of The Odyssey, or is Homer's version the only known evidence of this oral tradition? If so, are there major differences between them, or are written versions largely consistent with the one presented by Homer?</p>

  <p>The light was ebbing, and Eddie Willers could not distinguish the bum's face. The bum had said it simply, without expression. But from the sunset far at the end of the street, yellow glints caught his eyes, and the eyes looked straight at Ellie Willers, mocking and still - as if the question had been addressed to the causeless uneasiness within him.</p>

"Vonnegut's writing style as time passed","<p>I've been reading a lot of Vonnegut recently, and I've noticed some interesting stuff. <em>Slaughterhouse-Five or the Children's Crusade</em>, <em>God Bless You Mr. Rosewater</em>, and <em>Cat's Cradle</em> are similar to a novel in format, though <em>Slaughterhouse Five</em> is of course all ""out of order"" and in two of the three, Vonnegut breaks the fourth wall more than a few times. </p>

<p>On the other hand, <em>Timequake</em> is this weird combination of stream of consciousness, real life, and fiction, so you have no idea what the heck's going on. Semi-similarly, <em>Wampeters, Foma, and Granfalloons</em> (a collection of Vonnegut's talks and articles) go over all sorts of different topics, with little rhyme or reason (at least to my mind), feeling kind of stream of conscious-y as well. </p>

<p>Interestingly, looking at the dates the novels were published, it shakes out as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Cat's Cradle - 1963</li>
<li>God Bless You Mr. Rosewater - 1965</li>
<li>Slaughterhouse Five - 1969</li>
<li>Wampeters, Foma, and Granfalloons - 1974</li>
<li>Timequake - 1997</li>
</ul>

<p>That is, the later the book was published, the less like a normal novel the book is. Does this hold true for the rest of Vonnegut's books? Was this intentional? Why did this happen? </p>

First was his comment to Katniss prior to the first Hunger Games that killing people in the Arena wasn't really all <em>that</em> different than just hunting animals.</p>

<p>The second was his invention of bombs designed to maximize casualties. In particular, he designed a bomb with two blasts: one to kill/injure people and a second, delayed explosion so that when people rushed in to help the wounded it would kill them, too. Even after Katniss confronts him about this, he rationalizes it and doesn't appear to show much remorse about its potential effects.</p>

<p>First, a quote from the opening scene of the book:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Who is John Galt?""<br>
  The light was ebbing, and Eddie Willers could not distinguish the bum's face. The bum had said it simply, without expression. But from the sunset far at the end of the street, yellow glints caught his eyes, and the eyes looked straight at Eddie Willers, mocking and still - as if the question had been addressed to the causeless uneasiness within him.<br>
  ""Why did you say that?"" asked Eddie Willers, his voice tense.<br>

  <strong>""Why does it bother you?"" he asked.</strong><br>
  ""It doesn't,"" snapped Eddie Willers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Later, towards the end of Part 1, Chapter 3, Dagney Taggert encounters a newspaper vendor in the Taggart Terminal:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the corner of the concourse, by the main entrance, there was a small newsstand. The owner, a quiet, courteous old man with an air of breeding, had stood behind his counter for twenty years. He had owned a cigarette factory once, but <strong>it had gone bankrupt, and he had resigned himself to the lonely obscurity of his little stand in the midst of an eternal whirlpool of strangers.</strong> He had no family or friends left alive. He had a hobby which was his only pleasure; he gathered cigarettes from all over the world for his private collection; he knew every brand made or that had ever been made.</p>
  
  <p>Dagney liked to stop at his newsstand on his way out. <strong>He seemed to be part of the Taggart Terminal, like an old watchdog too feeble to protect it, but reassuring by the loyalty of his presence</strong>. He liked to see her coming... she stopped tonight, as usual, to buy a pack of cigarettes... ""<br>
  ""I like cigarettes, Miss Taggart. I like to think of fire held in a man's hand. Fire, a dangerous force, tamed at his fingertips. I often wonder about the hours when a man sits alone, watching the smoke of a cigarette, thinking. I wonder what get things have come from such hours. When a man thinks, there is a spot of fire alive in his mind - and it is proper that he should have the burning point of a cigarette as his one expression.""...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After they muse about whether people <em>do</em> think these days, he continued:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""I don't like the thing that's happening to people, Miss Taggert.""<br>
  ""What?""<br>
  ""I don't know. But I've watched them here for twenty years and I've seen the change. They used to rush through here, and it was wonderful to watch, it was the hurry of men who knew where they were going and were eager to get there. Now they're hurrying because they are afraid. It's not a purpose that drives them, it's fear. They're not going anywhere, they're escaping. And I don't think they know what it is that they want to escape. They don't look at one another. They jerk when brushed against. They smile too much, but it's an ugly kind of smiling; it's not joy, it's pleading. I don't know what it is that's happening to the world."" He shrugged. ""Oh, well, who is John Galt?""<br>
  ""He's just a meaningless phrase!""<br>
  <strong>She was surprised by the sharpness of her own voice</strong>... ""Why do people keep saying it? Nobody seems able to explain just what it stands for, yet they all use it as if they knew the meaning.""<br>
  <strong>""Why does it disturb you?"" he asked.</strong><br>
  ""I just don't like what they seem to mean when they say it.""<br>
  <strong>""I don't, either, Miss Taggart.""</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are some interesting parallels here. First, the parallel phrase ""Why does it bother you?"" (the bum) vs. ""Why does it disturb you?"" (the newspaperman). Both Dagney and Eddie replied (Eddie ""snapped"" and Dagney replied ""sharply"").</p>

<p>Eddie denies that it bothers him at all, and Dagney says that it bothers her because she doesn't like what she thinks people mean by it.</p>

<p>The bum seems to be a permanent fixture of the streets (""pleas for dimes were so common on the streets these days that it was not necessary to listen to explanations"") and the newspaperman is a fixture of the Taggart Terminal itself.</p>

<p>Both the bum and the newspaperman have at least some degree of insight into the situation. The bum ""had spoken as if he knew that Eddie felt [the causeless uneasiness], and as if he thought that one should feel it, and more: <strong>as if he knew the reason.</strong>""</p>

<p>The newspaperman displays passive resignation to his situation, and the bum is described as having a ""cynical"" resignation to his situation. And yet the bum is described as ""intelligent.""</p>

<p>What do we make of these parallels? Are the characters supposed to be similar, or is there supposed to be a contrast?</p>

<p>The newspaper seems almost like a cross between Eddie Willers and Dan Conway in a weird sort of way.</p>

<p>Normally, passive resignation is seen as a bad trait, and the newspaperman's factory had gone bankrupt at least 20 years earlier. (The circumstances are never described, so it's not clear if it was due to incompetence or mismanagement on his part or if it was just bad luck or some other set of circumstances). With that said, he was aware of what was happening to people, didn't seem to share in their fear or purposelessness, and didn't like what was happening.</p>

<p>What are we to make of him? How did Ayn Rand want us to view him?</p>

He heard a soft, low, breathless tone - <strong>the tone of admiration</strong> - growing in her voice, as she questioned him about his work and looked at the place around her. He looked at her graceful figure moving against the bursts of furnace flame, and at the light swift steps of her high heels stumbling through drifts of slag, as she walked resolutely by his side. <strong>The look in her eyes, when she watched a heat of steel being poured, was like his own feeling for it made visible to him. When her eyes moved up to his face, he saw the same look, but intensified to a degree that seemed to make her helpless and silent.</strong> It was at dinner, that evening, that he asked her to marry him.</p>

<p>Why did she react that way to seeing the Mills? Why did intensifying it ""seem to make her helpless and silent""? Admittedly, she never could've matched his genius (a fact that she was well aware of), but then again, neither could Eddie Willers.

"Before reading ""A Grain of Wheat,"" what historical facts and cultural context are useful to know?","<p>I'm looking to read <em>A Grain of Wheat</em>, by Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o. However, I'm very unfamiliar with the history and culture of Kenya, to the point where I know practically nothing about it. </p>

<p>But I do know this: that the history of Kenya is long and complicated, and the culture of Kenya is, well, a <em>culture</em>. Absorbing it <em>all</em> before reading this book seems a little unnecessary, bordering on impossible. </p>

<p>My question, then, is: what should I already know (or familiarize myself with) before going into this book? Do I need geopolitical context? What key elements of Kenyan culture and history should I read about before I pick up this book?</p>

"What ""unspeakable conclusion"" was Amira's father about to reach?","<p>The short story ""Seasons of Glass and Iron"", winner of the 2017 Hugo Award for Best Short Story, may be read in full <a href=""https://uncannymagazine.com/article/seasons-glass-iron/"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a>. I just read it last night, and a single passage confused me, in the story of how Amira came to be on her glass hill:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The king’s daughter read an unspeakable conclusion in her father’s eye, and in a rush to keep it from reaching his mouth, said, Suppose you placed me atop a glass hill where none could reach me, and say that only the man who can ride up the hill in full armor may claim me as his bride?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>What was this ""unspeakable conclusion""?</strong> It can't be to marry her off to some prince, as he'd already said this was impossible for political reasons - nor can it be to put her on the glass hill, since that was <em>her</em> proposal to forestall him.</p>

"To what extent did Defoe attempt to apply formal realism in Robinson Crusoe?","<p>I recently finished writing a paper on <em>Robinson Crusoe</em> for my English class on the rise of the novel. We had read the novel concurrently with excerpts from Ian Watt's <em>The Rise of the Novel</em>, in which he argued that the works of Defoe, Richardson (we then read <em>Pamela</em>) and Fielding - which Watt categorized as the early novels - used what he called <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literary_realism#United_Kingdom"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">""formal realism""</a>. Moreover, he stated that these were some of the first - if not <em>the</em> first - significant pieces of literature to do so.</p>

<p><em>Robinson Crusoe</em> bears many hallmarks of formal realism (as I understand them):</p>

<ul>
<li>The presentation of people and events as ""evidence"", to use Watt's phrasing.</li>
<li>An attention to detail even in cases where it might seem overboard. For instance, some sections of Crusoe's journal seem . . . unnecessary. At the least, as we discussed, it's not clear that they're intended to advance the plot.</li>
<li>The implication that this is an authentic presentation of the events as they occurred.</li>
</ul>

<p>All of this has me a little curious as to the thought processes of Defoe and company (although I'll stick to Defoe, for simplicity). Was Defoe aware that he was using a new sort of realist techniques, and was this usage intentional? Put another way, are the indicators of formal realism in <em>Robinson Crusoe</em> part of an effort by Defoe, or just elements of the writing that were noticed long after the fact?</p>

"The proper way to count ""edition"" numbering","<p>Let's assume there is some John Doe, who is an author of Some Book.</p>

<p>And in 1810 it was published again, by the same publisher, but in 3 volumes, with images, preface, glossary, on handmade paper and in very limited quantity (only 300). And much more pricey, of course.</p>

<p>Yes, I know, Heinrich Oskar Sommer's work is perfect, but it's too hard to read, for obvious reasons.</p>

<p>Probably <a href=""http://d.lib.rochester.edu/camelot/publication/beardsley-birth-life-and-acts-of-king-arthur"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">F.J.Simmons edition</a>?

<p>* Upcott's edition is much better known as Southey's edition, but in fact Southey just wrote the preface, and has nothing to do with the text itself. The text is based on Caxton's 1485 edition, but contains a lot of errors and some strange replacements.</p>

"(Why) Is there a shift in style in Toll the Hounds?","<p>By and large, I have found the writing style in the <em>Malazan Book of the Fallen</em> to be consistent across the first seven novels. They were all written by Steven Erikson. However, I feel there is a distinct shift in style in the eight book, <em>Toll the Hounds</em>, also written by Erikson.</p>

<p><em>Toll the Hounds</em> seems to feature numerous passages of a style similar to, for example, the concluding section of Book Two's Chapter 9:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Night seeps into Darujhistan, a thick blinding fog in which people
  stumble or hide as they walk the alleys and streets. Some are drawn
  like moths to the lit areas and the welcoming eternal hiss of gas from
  the wrought iron poles. Others seek to move as one with the darkness,
  at least until some damned piece of crockery snaps underfoot, or a
  pebble is sent skittering. And everywhere can be seen the small
  glitter of rodent eyes, or heard the slither of tails.</p>
  
  <p>Light glows through shutters and bubbled glass windows, but never mind
  the light and all peaceful slumber and discourse and all the rest such
  illumination might reveal! Dull and witless the expectations so
  quickly and predictably surrendered!</p>
  
  <p><em>[Followed by quick peeks on the actions of Lady Challice, Torvald Nom,
  a guard, an ironmonger (?), Harllo Jr and a Great Raven, and this
  final passage:]</em></p>
  
  <p>And this was a night like any other, a skein of expectations and
  anticipations, revelations and perturbations. Look around. Look
  around! On all sides, day and night, light and dark! Every step taken
  with the firm resolve to believe in the solid ground awaiting it.
  Every step, one after another, again and again, and no perilous ledge
  yawns ahead, oh no.</p>
  
  <p>Step and step, now, step and step &mdash;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm not sure what to call this sort of writing, but it generally features:</p>

<ol>
<li>a quick third-person overview of a bunch of characters,</li>
<li>flowery descriptions of the scenery, and</li>
<li>exhortations to the reader to do something (look at, or appreciate the irony of, or take pity on, something or the other)</li>
<li>a short length (2-3 pages at most)</li>
</ol>

<p>This sort of writing is not unusual in itself*, but I don't think the previous 7 books had many, if any, instances of it, whereas <em>Toll the Hounds</em> has multiple such instances - and I am not even halfway through it!
Personally I find such sections tedious, making the entire book far more hard reading than the others.</p>

<p>Is there a noticeable change in Erikson's writing style in this book? If so, what triggered it? Has he talked about it somewhere?</p>

<hr>

<p>* It reminds me of 19th - early 20th century writings, for some reason. Dickens? O'Henry?</p>

"Is there an annotated edition of 'It Can't Happen Here' for non-American readers?","<p>I recently read Sinclair Lewis's 1935 novel <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It_Can%27t_Happen_Here"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>It Can't Happen Here</em></a>. The novel <a href=""http://money.cnn.com/2017/01/28/media/it-cant-happen-here-1984-best-sellers/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">appeared on Amazon.com's list of bestselling books</a> after the 2016 USA presidential elections, along with George Orwell's <em>Nineteen Eighty-Four</em> and, lower down the list, Margaret Atwood's <em>The Handmaid's Tale</em>, Ray Bradbury's <em>Fahrenheit 451</em> and Orwell's <em>Animal Farm</em>. </p>

<p>In an article in The New York Times Book Review titled <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/17/books/review/classic-novel-that-predicted-trump-sinclar-lewis-it-cant-happen-here.html?_r=0"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">""Reading the Classic Novel That Predicted Trump""</a>, professor Beverly Gage (who did not necessarily choose the article's title), wrote,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“It Can’t Happen Here” is a work of dystopian fantasy, one man’s effort in the 1930s to imagine what it might look like if fascism came to America. At the time, the obvious specter was Adolf Hitler, whose rise to power in Germany provoked fears that men like the Louisiana senator Huey Long or the radio priest Charles Coughlin might accomplish a similar feat in the United States. (...)
  In 1935, Lewis was trying to prevent the unthinkable: the election of a pseudo-fascist candidate to the presidency of the United States.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The persons mentioned in the book are partly real and historical—e.g. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huey_Long"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Huey Long</a>, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Franklin D.

<p>The book mentions a number of persons, organisations, etc. that modern readers are usually not familiar with, such as <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_State_Political_Directorate"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">OGPU</a> (the Soviet Union's secret police at the time), <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Streicher"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Julius Streicher</a>, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9la_Kun"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Béla Kun</a>, Salvemini (actually <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaetano_Salvemini"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Gaetano Salvemini</a>) and Oswald Spengler's <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Decline_of_the_West"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>The Decline of the West</em></a>.</p>

<p>The book also mentions many persons, organisations, etc. that non-American readers may not be familiar with, e.g. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Buchman"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Frank Buchman</a>, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lothrop_Stoddard"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Lothrop Stoddard</a>, the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Townsend#The_Townsend_Plan"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Townsend Plan</a>, the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Recovery_Administration"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">NRA</a> (no, not that <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Rifle_Association"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">other NRA</a>), <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Emergency_Relief_Administration"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">FERA</a>, the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_Community_Center"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">YMHA</a>, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Army_of_the_Republic"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">GAR</a>, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspar_Milquetoast"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Caspar Milquetoast</a>. The abbreviations are not expanded; many of the names are probably also unfamiliar to many American readers today.</p>

<p>The book also mentions many authors and book titles (novelists etc.); it is up to the reader to figure out how these names are relevant in the context where they are mentioned (which is almost impossible if you are not familiar with their works).</p>

<p>It is usually clear whether a name is fictional or not, especially if you know a bit about the history of English literature. Wikipedia can be a great help, but the lists of names can become really long, for example when in chapter 22, Lewis lists celebrities and journalists that get arrested: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raymond_Moley"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Raymond Moley</a>, Frank Simonds, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Kent"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Frank Kent</a>, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heywood_Broun"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Heywood Broun</a>, Mark Sullivan (not <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Sullivan"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">identifiable on Wikipedia</a>), <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earl_Browder"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Earl Browder</a>, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_Pierce_Adams"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Franklin P.

This is a single enumeration on the same page (p. 219 in Penguin's 2017 reprint). </p>

<p>So there's a lot of name dropping and it is rather tedious to look up every unfamiliar or half-familiar name and book title just to make sure you aren't overlooking any hidden meanings and allusions. For this reason, I would like to know if there is an <strong>annotated edition</strong> of Sinclair Lewis's novel <em>It Can't Happen Here</em> that would meet the following <strong>criteria</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>For every name, organisation or book title that is real, this should be mentioned. Readers can then safely assume that the other names are fictional. </li>
<li>For every author or book title where the content of the work would clarify something that is said in the book, the annotations should explain what information is relevant in that context. The same applies to politicians and the ideas they represented. E.g. who was Gaetano Salvemini (p. 202)? </li>
<li>If events described in the novel have a historical parallel in Nazi Germany, Mussolini's Italy or Stalin's Russia, this should be explained. For example, both a BBC journalist and a French journalist visiting the USA during Windrip's presidency note that the people are perfectly happy; they don't seem to know that the country has both labour camps and concentration camps, and they don't comment (or did not notice?) on racist policies.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/work/editions/1296784-it-can-t-happen-here?page=3"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Goodreads</a> lists an annotated Kindle edition (ASIN: B00751IMZM), but I can't find a trace of it on Amazon, so I don't know whether it fits my criteria. (The <a href=""https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B00DGZKU88"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Kindle version from Signet Classics</a> doesn't appear to have annotations.)</p>

"Is Jim Taggart's claim that Dagny ""never felt anything"" parallel to Philip Rearden's claim that Hank never suffered?","<p>From the scene early on in <em>Atlas Shrugged</em> where Dagny Taggart told her brother Jim that she had canceled his order with Associated Steel in favor of purchasing Rearden Metal track instead:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[Dagny] had turned to go, when [Jim] spoke again - and what he said seemed bewilderingly irrelevant. ""That's all right for you, because you're lucky. Others can't do it.""<br>
  ""Do what?""<br>
  ""Other people are human. They're sensitive. They can't devote their whole life to metal and engines. You're lucky - you've never had any feelings. You've never felt anything at all.""</p>

<p>Philip Rearden later demanded that Hank give him a job. During the course of their discussion, he stated:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""You haven't any feelings. You've never felt anything at all. You've never <em>suffered</em>!""<br>
  It was as if a sum of years hit Rearden in the face, by means of a sensation and a sight... You've never suffered, the dead stare of the eye was saying, you've never felt anything, because only to suffer as to feel - there's no such thing as joy, there's only pain and the absence of pain; only pain and the zero, when one feels nothing - I suffer, I'm twisted by suffering, I'm made of undiluted suffering, that's my purity, that's my virtue - and yours, you the untwisted one, you the uncomplaining, yours is to relieve me of my pain - cut your unsuffering body to patch up mine, cut your unfeeling soul to stop mine from feeling - and we'll achieve the ultimate ideal, the triumph over life, the zero!</p>

<p>The phrases are clearly parallel. Was Hank's realization basically what Jim Taggart was saying here - ""you've never felt anything at all"" meaning that only to suffer is to feel?</p>

  “Yes, the girls, where can one find any here?”<br>

"In Mansfield Park, why did Maria Bertram and Henry Crawford get together?","<p>I just finished reading Mansfield Park, and so far after (5 books) it is my favorite. However there are some things which I may unintentionally skip over.</p>

<p>I understand that Maria was a selfish person who thought she herself could do no wrong. However I believe that she must have known that leaving her husband and going with Henry Crawford would be frowned upon. I don't understand why she would do this. I don't think selfish is a good enough reason since she was of high birth and proper education. Is there any other reason that I might miss in the book?</p>

<p>Also the last chapter gives me the impression that Henry was still in love with Fanny (I love her too) even right up to the moment when he went off with Maria. So why did he do it? He knew Maria was married. He knew Fanny's opinion of him was softened, and he still loved her. So I don't understand why he would do something like this?</p>

<p>We don't know with certainty what sort of manuscript <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Thorpe"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Thorpe</a> used for the 1609 edition of the sonnets, but scholars now regard him as a reputable publisher.

  <p>He was strapped into a chair surrounded by dials, under dazzling lights. A man in a white coat was reading the dials. There was a tramp of heavy boots outside. The door clanged open. The waxed-faced officer marched in, followed by two guards. </p>

"What was the first book that taught readers how to analyse and interpret literature?","<p>Books about literaty theory have a long tradition; Aristotle's <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poetics_(Aristotle)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>Poetics</em></a> dates back to the 4th century BC. Books about how to write literature also go back a long way, for example, Horace's <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ars_Poetica_(Horace)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>Ars Poetica</em></a> (around 19 BC). And, of course, people have been studying and commenting on literature for many centuries. However, since many questions on this site are about the analysis or interpretation of literature, it seems worth asking when people (presumably academics) started teaching others how to do this.</p>

<p>In the English-speaking world, I assume that this started with the establishment of literature departments at universities during the 19th century. According to <a href=""http://etcweb.princeton.edu/CampusWWW/Companion/english_department.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">E.D.H. Johnson</a>, writing about the Department of English at Princeton (my emphasis),</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Until well through the nineteenth century, English studies at Princeton, as elsewhere, were regarded as incidental to preparation for the ministry, law, or public life, and as a result instruction <strong>concentrated on grammar and composition, rhetoric, and elocution</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He continues,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Although the Rev. James W. Alexander, Professor of Belles- Lettres, delivered in 1838 what should probably be regarded as the first course of lectures in English literature, <strong>official recognition of this subject</strong> in the College catalogue had to wait until <strong>1864</strong> when John S. Hart was listed as ``Lecturer on English Literature.''</p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to Paul Watt (<a href=""https://www.dur.ac.uk/cncs/researchconversation/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">""Criticism in late nineteenth-century England: Towards the regulation and reform of a profession in crisis""</a>), writers in 19th-century England found that the quality of criticism had declined significantly, so </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>By the 1880s, however, concrete plans were hatched by English newspaper editors, intellectuals and critics—as well as assertive newspaper readers—to lift the standard of criticism in England. The highest priorities were the <strong>establishment of training programs for aspiring critics</strong> and the <strong>formulation of principles and methods to guide them</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This seems to imply that such ""principles and methods"" did not exist in the 1880s, even though some literature departments had been established by that time. For example, <a href=""https://archiveshub.jisc.ac.uk/search/archives/5423a1c4-bcfe-3c21-8dcd-0ebf353a9207?component=be8ae1c0-8fd5-38ff-a63c-b44a86259931"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">in Scotland</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The <strong>Chair of English Language and Literature</strong> at Glasgow University was established by the Universities Commission of <strong>1858</strong>, its first Professor being John Nichol (1862-1889), making it <strong>one of the oldest Chairs in English Literature in Britain</strong>. Although English Literature had been taught in the University in one form or another for a century already by such well-known figures as Adam Smith , the first holders of the Chair of English Language and Literature had little precedents to follow, and none had ever attended a class in English or held a degree in the subject. These men determined the content and direction of the English class. Notable early occupants of the post included Andrew Cecil Bradley (1889-1900) and Walter Raleigh (1900-1904).</p>

<p>But none of the above sources, nor the Wikipedia article <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literary_criticism"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Literary criticism</a> make mention of books that teach readers how to analyse and interpret literature. So what was the first such book?

It's a modern, Caribbean-themed story inspired by Shakespeare's <em>The Tempest</em>.</p>

<p>One thing which confused me on the first reading was the use of pronouns. The story starts off written in the second person:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Did you sleep well?” she asks, and you make sure that your face is fixed into a dreamy smile as you open your eyes into the morning after.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But then, not long after this, there are some paragraphs written in the first person:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>She tell me say I must call her Scylla, or Charybdis.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I didn't notice this pronoun switch at first, and when I did, I foolishly assumed it was an inconsistency in the writing. Turns out Nalo Hopkinson is a much better writer than that: for the paragraphs in second person, ""you"" refers to Caliban, while Ariel is ""she""; for those in first person, ""I"" refers to Ariel, while Caliban is ""he"", and ""you"" is used to address the readers.</p>

<p><strong>My question is: why switch pronouns in this way?</strong> It's confusing on a first read - you only slowly realise that there's more than one viewpoint character - although it's all perfectly consistent once you figure out the pronoun scheme and treat the two types of paragraph separately. What does this stylistic choice add to the story?</p>

The central character is a reimagining of Shakespeare's Caliban, a Caribbean black man who finds white women to turn him into whatever they want him to be. For some reason, it seems only <em>white</em> women (""golden girls"", as he calls them) will do:</p>

<ul>
<li><blockquote>
  <p>The kisses of golden girls are chancy things. Once, after the touch of other pale lips, you looked into the eyes of a golden girl, one Miranda, and saw yourself reflected back in her moist, breathless stare.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
  <p>You pass another beautiful golden girl, luxuriantly blonde. She glances at you, casts her eyes down demurely, where they just happen to rest at your crotch. You feel her burgeoning gaze there, your helpless response. Quickly you lean and kiss the shoulder of the woman you’re with. The other one’s look turns to resentful longing. You hurry on.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
  <p>There’s a young black woman sitting on a bench, her hair tight peppercorns against her scalp. Her feet are crossed beneath her. She’s alone, reading a book. She’s pretty, but she looks too much like your sister. Too brown to ever be a golden girl. She looks up as you go by, distracted from her reading by the chattering of the woman beside you. She looks at you. Smiles. Nods a greeting. Burning up with guilt, you make your face stone. You move on.</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>

<p>The phrase ""golden girl"" is repeated multiple times in the story, referring to Caliban's love interests or potential love interests. He dismisses the young black woman for being ""[t]oo brown"".</p>

<p><strong>Why is Caliban only interested in white women?</strong> How does this aspect of the story tie in to the underlying racial tensions which are hinted at throughout?</p>

<p>Carol, a librarian at St. Paul Library, and Kennicott, a doctor in a small town called Gopher Prairie, went tramping together. After a walk, sitting on a bank, Kenicott persistently persuaded her to marry him and settle down in Gopher Prairie, saying that it was the nicest town in the world. He even brought some pictures of the town to show her.</p>

<p>In this part, I could not understand what were the ""crevices"" of a ""boggy bank.""
Does ""boggy"" mean that the bank resembled a bog? And how can there be crevices in the bank...? </p>

"What do the locations mentioned in First Love mean?","<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gwendoline_Riley"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Gwendoline Riley's</a> novel <em>First Love</em> (2017) is about the relationship of the female narrator, Neve, with Edwyn, and how the type of relationships she had with her mother and (especially) her abusive father play a role in it. Neve and Edwyn live in Edwyn's flat near <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Brompton_station"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">West Brompton station</a> in London. Edwyn grew up in <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isleworth"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Isleworth</a> in west London. Neve mentions that ""[her] parents' old flat was in <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiswick"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Chiswick</a>"", also in West London. (Chiswick apparently has had some interesting residents, such as Alexander Pope, W. B. Yeats, Ugo Foscolo, Camille Pissarro, E. M. Forster and currently Peter Brook.) </p>

<p>From Edwyn's point of view, Neve comes from ""the North"": she grew up in Liverpool (Gwendoline Riley was born there) and studied in Manchester (like Riley); she also lived in Glasgow for a while. At the start of the novel, Neve's mother lives in <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garston,_Liverpool"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Garston (Liverpool)</a>. In the chapter about her father's funeral, she mentions relatives living in <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aigburth"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Aigburth</a> and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speke"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Speke</a> (both in Liverpool). </p>

<p>Names of suburbs, areas and streets are typically mentioned without specifying in which city they are, although that normally becomes clear when you read on. What is not clear, especially to someone from outside the UK, is whether these place names carry any special connotations, e.g. are they upmarket or (more likely?) working-class suburbs? Have they been neglected or are living conditions improving? Or am I completely barking up the wrong tree by looking for this type of information and associations?</p>

<p>The book does not contain any dates (as far as I can remember), but I assume the ""present"" is roughly 2017, when the book was published, and since the main character is in her mid-thirties (barely younger than the author herself), she must have grown up in Liverpool between 1980 and the late 1990s. The only clearly datable reference can be found in a passage where Neve thinks back to a past relationship and says that, at that time, she had bought tickets for the documentary <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Of_Time_and_the_City"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Of Time and the City</a> by Terrence Davies, which was released in 2008.</p>

"What does ""nuh"" mean here in ""Shift"" by Nalo Hopkinson?","<p>In reading ""Shift"" by Nalo Hopkinson, I came across this paragraph:</p>

<p>I'm unsure what the ""nuh"" means in the two bolded sentences. It <em>sounds</em> rather like ""no"", but it's obviously not just a pronunciation difference; replacing ""nuh"" with ""no"" doesn't really make sense, especially in the first instance.</p>

<p>One of the interesting things about the story is that it follows a formula. The storyteller begins by framing the story as something not to be taken seriously:</p>

      I am going to tell this story<br>
  ne ɖeviwo abe fefe fefe ene<br>

<p>The storyteller then does a call and response with the audience: she says ""Listen to a story"" and the audience responds with ""Let the story come.""</p>

<p>Then, the characters are introduced with ""The story moves and lands on a man and the wife,"" and finally the narrative begins.</p>

<p>Some of the phrases used to frame this story (e.g. ""the story moves and lands on [characters]"") are used in another Ewe tale recorded on the site: <a href=""http://www.hum2.leidenuniv.nl/verba-africana/ewe/b-headless-crabs-analysis.htm"" rel=""noreferrer""><em>Headless Crabs</em></a>.</p>

"Was Wolf Hall originally written in the first person?","<p>When reading Hilary Mantel's novel <em>Wolf Hall</em>, I noticed that the protagonist, Thomas Cromwell, is referred to as often as possible simply as ""he""/""him"" rather than by his name. This includes in contexts where ""he"" would more naturally be read as referring to someone else: many times when reading such sentences, I would 'stumble', misreading who the pronoun was referring to, and have to go back and reread the sentence with the correct interpretation. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li><blockquote>
  <p>He sees three elderly Lowlanders struggling with their bundles and moves to help them. The packages are soft and bulky, samples of woolen cloth. A port officer gives them trouble about their documents, shouting into their faces. He lounges behind the clerk, pretending to be a Lowland oaf, and tells the merchants by holding up his fingers what he thinks a fair bribe. “Please,” says one of them, in effortful English to the clerk, “will you take care of these English coins for me? I find them surplus.” Suddenly the clerk is all smiles. The Lowlanders are all smiles; they would have paid much more. When they board they say, “The boy is with us.”</p>
  
  <p><sub>-- <a href=""http://www.tor.com/2013/06/10/wolf-hall-excerpt/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Chapter 1</a></sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>At first glance, I read this as the port officer lounging behind the clerk, or maybe someone else lounging ... I was completely confused about who was doing what. Only when I reached the end of the paragraph, ""The boy is with us"", did I realise that Tom must have helped the Lowlanders in some way, and then I went back and worked out that it was <em>him</em> lounging behind the clerk/port officer and signalling to the merchants.</p></li>
<li><p>There were many other (probably better) examples throughout the book, but I've given my copy away to charity and Chapter 1 is the only excerpt I can find on the internet.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>(This was part of what made me condemn <em>Wolf Hall</em>, despite its Man Booker Prize, as simply a poorly written book: if the reader keeps stumbling and having to go back and reread sentences because their intended meaning is different from their most natural meaning, that's usually a hallmark of bad writing.)</p>

<p>It struck me that this excessive use of pronouns would have made much more sense if the book was written with <strong>first-person narration</strong>. If Cromwell had been a first-person protagonist, there would never have been any confusion about whether the pronoun referred to him or someone else - it would have been ""I""/""me"" and not ""he""/""him"". Thus, I came to the conclusion that the book was originally written in the first person and then hastily and somewhat shoddily edited into third-person narration, changing too many of the ""I""s into ""he""s instead of ""Cromwell""s.</p>

<p><strong>Is there any more evidence to support this conclusion?</strong> Acceptable evidence might be either more textual clues suggesting that early drafts of the book were written in the first person, or possibly a statement from the author (if the author says it <em>wasn't</em> originally first-person narration, I'd take that with a pinch of salt, but if she says it <em>was</em>, I'd be inclined to believe her).</p>

"What does Tiriel's blindness symbolize?","<p>In <em>Tiriel</em>, it's mentioned several times that Tiriel is blind, first in Chapter I, line 27:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Look at my eyes, blind as the orbless skull among the stones!</p>

<p>And later again in Chapter II, lines 61-65:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Soon as the blind wanderer enter’d the pleasant gardens of Har,<br>
  They ran weeping, like frighted infants, for refuge in Mnetha’s arms.<br>
  The blind man felt his way, and cried: ‘Peace to these open doors!<br>
  Let no one fear, for poor blind Tiriel hurts none but himself.<br>
  Tell me, O friends, where am I now, and in what pleasant place?’</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As well as several more times afterward. </p>

<p>My immediate thought when I first read Chapter I was that it symbolized his lack of empathy (i.e. metaphorical blindness to the feelings of others), which led his sons to revolt and throw him out, but he <em>does</em> seem genuinely sad that his wife, Myratana, has died. Also, the arc of the story didn't seem to quite fit this reading. His lack of empathy doesn't seem to ever come back to bite him in a straightforward way: he gets exactly what he wanted, killing all his children with his curse; his brothers Ijim and Zazel remain in exile where he put them; and he dies as he wanted, cursing his own father, Har, for creating one set of laws meant to apply to everyone. Aside from the rebellion of his sons, everything pretty much seems to go his way.</p>

<p>What does the blindness signify?</p>

<p><sup><em>The Sandman</em> #2 ""Imperfect Hosts,"" page 21</sup></p>

<p>So I have, essentially, two questions about this exchange.</p>

<p><strong>1. What is the significance of the name change?</strong>  </p>

<p>As I understood it, Dream called them by names that he was likely using for millennia. Did they change names because of the general weirdness that happened during Dream's 70 year absence? I infer from the Crone's statement (""Atropos? No. Not now."") that the names were changed from what they were before (""not now"" as in ""not anymore"").</p>

<p>Does this name change have a deeper meaning?</p>

<p><strong>2. What do the different names represent?</strong></p>

<p>I am not very well versed in mythology; these names don't mean much to me. I was able to find some things during my preliminary research for this question:</p>

<ul>
<li>I found that Alecto, Megaera, and Tisiphone are the names of the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sandman:_The_Kindly_Ones"" rel=""noreferrer"">Erinyes</a>. (<em>Found that by searching Wikipedia for ""three witches comics,"" and finding a mention of the Erinyes on <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sandman:_The_Kindly_Ones"" rel=""noreferrer"">a page</a> about a volume of</em> The Sandman <em>that I haven't yet read</em>)</li>
<li>I found that the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Morr%C3%ADgan"" rel=""noreferrer"">Morrigan</a> is a figure from Irish mythology, a ""phantom queen"" who represents fate.</li>
<li>The most relevant result that I found by searching the web for the ""Diana, Mary, Florence and Candy"" was <a href=""http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Three_Witches"" rel=""noreferrer"">this page</a>, which is very light on the background for these names. I'm also confused about how the Maiden gave four names for three persons.</li>
</ul>

<p>In summary: <strong>Why did the three change their names now, and what do those different names mean?</strong></p>

"In ""The Accidental"", was it really Amber who did this?","<p><strong>Warning: contains unmarked spoilers.</strong></p>

<p>Ali Smith's <em>The Accidental</em> is about the Smart family (Eve, Michael, Magnus, and Astrid) and a woman, Amber, who seemingly appears out of nowhere at their holiday home and has a dramatic effect on each of their lives. The book is split into twelve main parts: a ""beginning"", ""middle"", and ""end"" for each of Astrid, Magnus, Michael, and Eve respectively.</p>

<p>After Amber leaves at the end of the ""middle"" section, the Smarts return to their real home to find it bare: thieves have completely ransacked the place. The implication is that Amber was to blame:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Months later he remembered that she knew<br>
  where the house keys were kept, after this game–<br>
  in the bedside cabinet. Months later, too,<br>
  he thought about the wanting her with shame<br>
  and not a little wryness, like a clue<br>
  right under his own nose, a clue that came<br>
  and went and told him exactly what he needed,<br>
  plain as abc, and he’d refused to read it.</p>
  
  <p><sub>-- middle, Michael</sub></p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote>
  <p>The real world was elsewhere, like she was.</p>
  
  <p>Imagine her, systematically emptying things room by room, shifting them through the front door and across the pavement into a van in the dead of night. She was in league with someone, a man, surely. She had to be. She'd need someone to help move the heavier things; you'd need someone to help you clean up afterwards.</p>
  
  <p><sub>-- middle, Michael</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>But is there really enough evidence to say that Amber robbed them after she left, or could it have been a coincidence? Or is the point that it's supposed to be ambiguous and we can never know? Given the significance of all the character interactions in the book, I'm sure that whatever the answer to this question is, it will tie in metaphorically to the relationships that form the core of the story.</p>

<p>This is a significant question to ask, because the answer to it may change our view of Amber. Was she merely a thief taking advantage of the family, and her lasting influence on their lives an accident, or was she somehow sent by Providence, an odd stranger, as Eve is to the other family at the very end?</p>

<p><strong>Was Amber involved in the ransacking of the Smarts' home or not?</strong></p>

<p>In George Eliot (Marian Evans)'s novel <em>Silas Marner</em>, the eponymous weaver's life goes through several significant stages:</p>

<ul>
<li>his years-long period of living alone and hoarding gold;</li>
<li>the miserable period immediately after his gold is stolen;</li>
<li>his time of happiness after Eppie comes into his life.</li>
</ul>

<p>The two most major life-changing events which happen to him during his time in Raveloe are of course the theft of his gold and the arrival of Eppie. Each of these has a huge effect not only on his way of living but even on his personality.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the novel, he gets some closure on the first of these events, when his gold is returned to him and the thief identified. But wouldn't his life would have gone on in pretty much the same way if this had never happened? Or is the recovery of the money and Dunstan's body somehow more momentous than just to make Silas realise how little the gold matters to him now?</p>

"How can ""Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde"" be read as a commentary on Scotland?","<p>In the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strange_Case_of_Dr_Jekyll_and_Mr_Hyde"" rel=""noreferrer"">Wikipedia page</a> for Stevenson's <em>Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde</em>, one of the mentioned interpretations of the story is as a symbolic representation of Scottish nationalism vs union with England. This seems to stand out among other more natural interpretations involving human nature and Victorian social commentary. Checking the sources of that section, I found <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/dec/13/dr-jekyll-mr-hyde-stevenson"" rel=""noreferrer"">this Guardian article</a>, which says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In this view, the moral focus of the story is the Scottish character, burdened by dual nationality (Scottish and British), caught between two tongues (Scots and English), its instinctive spontaneity repressed by a Calvinistic church - the very church that once came between Stevenson and his father, and caused a split in the family. Edinburgh is a city starkly divided into two: the foggy old town up on the hill, once the site of colourful crimes such as bodysnatching and of public hangings in the Grassmarket; and the splendid New Town to the north, on the other side of the then newly laid railway tracks. In Glasgow, where I grew up, the common perception of Edinburgh was of a cloudy inner life (old town) shielded by a genteel exterior (New Town). It was - how could you avoid saying so? - a Jekyll-and-Hyde sort of place.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This seems fairly weak evidence in itself. Many cities have a dual nature such as ""old city"" vs ""new city"", not only Edinburgh. But of course a news article isn't the place to look for detailed literary analysis. So I pose the question here:</p>

<p><strong>How can <em>Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde</em> be read as a representation of Scottishness? Can this reading of the story be well supported from the text, and does it have a strong history in the world of Stevenson criticism?</strong></p>

For example, as quoted in <a href=""https://literature.stackexchange.com/a/10886/17"">this answer</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I have often wondered why the <em>Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</em> was set in London instead of Edinburgh. Utterson is a very Scottish sort of lawyer; Lanyon is a very Scottish sort of doctor; and the metaphysical speculation that allures Dr. Jekyll to his doom is decidedly more Scottish than English. Furthermore, the tale might most appropriately be conceived as happening among the gloomy doorways and mysterious <em>wynds</em> that undermine the tall, decaying <em>lands</em> which darkly overhang the High Street of Edinburgh. Possibly Louis may have felt that Mr. Hyde could lose himself more easily among the shifting crowds of a vaster and less centred city. It is more difficult to hunt a villain down in London than in Edinburgh.</p>

"Does Joyce, in Finnegans Wake or Ulysses, link the sound form ""hoe"" to ""whore""?","<p>Does Joyce, in <em>Finnegans Wake</em> or <em>Ulysses</em>, link the sound form ""hoe"" to ""whore"", as in the current day ""ho""?</p>

<p>For example, is it probable that Joyce intended the (additional) modern day pun in the following line [<em>Finnegans Wake</em> p.g. 5.9]?  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hootch is for husbandman handling his hoe. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>In <em>Ulysses</em> standalone ""ho"" appears 29 times, of which 24 occur in Circes, but all appear to be standard usages. ""hoe"" appears but once. This <em>excludes</em> portmanteau usages such as ""hother’s"".  The prevalence of ""ho"" in Circes (a chapter of whores) suggests Joyce may have been onto this association. Perhaps for censorship reason? Does any <em>Ulysses</em> buff know more about this? Here are a few example.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>MARION: Let him look, the pishogue! Pimp! And scourge himself! I’ll
  write to a powerful prostitute or Bartholomona, the bearded woman, to
  raise weals out on him an inch thick and make him bring me back a
  signed and stamped receipt.</p>
  
  <p>BOYLAN: (Clasps himself.) Here, I can’t hold this little lot much
  longer. (He strides off on stiff cavalry legs.)</p>
  
  <p>BELLA: (Laughing.) Ho ho ho ho.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>THE CROPPY BOY: Horhot ho hray hor hother’s hest.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and my favourite, <em>if the pun holds</em>,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(Private Carr and Private Compton turn and counterretort, their tunics
  bloodbright in a lampglow, black sockets of caps on their blond
  cropped polls. Stephen Dedalus and Lynch pass through the crowd close
  to the redcoats.)</p>
  
  <p>PRIVATE COMPTON: (Jerks his finger.) Way for the parson.</p>
  
  <p>PRIVATE CARR: (Turns and calls.) What ho, parson!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since this sound form is so prevalent in <em>Finnegans Wake</em> it would be important to know if Joyce is using this association or not.</p>

<p>I have searched Google Books and can find no contemporaneous usage (the 1930s or before), so suspect perhaps not. I have also search some of James's love letters to Nora, and while ""whore"" indeed appears, ""ho/hoe"" does not. I could not find it in Shakespeare either.</p>

<ul>
<li>Has anyone commented on this before in the literature?</li>
<li>Does such a usage appear in any of Joyce's earlier works?</li>
<li>Do any such usages appear anywhere before the 1930s? </li>
<li>Is this the sound form for whore in any other language?</li>
</ul>

<p>Note the the sound form ""hoer"" from the Dutch is different to ""hoe"". <em>Finnegans Wake</em> is riddled with foreign words, especially (but not inclusively) from the Germanic, Scandinavian, Greek and Latin languages, so all such variants of ""whore"" appear in the text. All those close to ""whore"" end in an ""r"" of some sort, while ""ho/hoe"" does not. </p>

<p>I have found an example [p.g. 20.35] in <em>Finnegans Wake</em> that suggests he was very close to making the leap, where ann is the ""whore"" river-wife [think Molly] of the aforementioned husband manhandling his hoe.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Flou inn, flow ann. Hohore!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Research reveals to ""ho"" gained popularity in the 60s, which is 30 years too late.</p>

<ul>
<li>Demonstrating that Joyce was onto ""ho""-""whore"" in the Circe chapter of <em>Ulysses</em>, would, of course, completely answer this question, and I would absolutely accept such an answer without it have any discussion of <em>Finnegans Wake</em>. </li>
</ul>

<p>From what I know, the slash is used in literature to separate verses of a poem when written in body text. I have also asked my teacher, a professional translator specialised in literature, and she told me that she has only seen the slash in this context. But in this case there is no poem, there is not even a rhyme, so I don't understand the purpose of this punctuation mark here and I can't translate the text properly. Has anyone ever encountered the slash in a similar context?</p>

<p>Maybe it is something only play-related. Could it have something to do with the way the actors have to act this scene or these characters?</p>

"Is this sentence in The Count of Monte Cristo supposed to refer to Fernand or to Albert?","<p>In <a href=""http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1184/1184-h/1184-h.htm#linkC2HCH0078"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Chapter Seventy-Eight</a> of <em>The Count of Monte Cristo</em> Albert shows Monte Cristo the following article from the newspaper:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A correspondent at Yanina informs us of a fact of which until now we had remained in ignorance. The castle which formed the protection of the town was given up to the Turks by a French officer named Fernand, in whom the grand vizier, Ali Tepelini, had reposed the greatest confidence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Albert is offended by this because he thinks it is a reference to his father. As he tells Monte Cristo:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""It signifies to my father, the Count of Morcerf, whose Christian name is Fernand!""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Monte Cristo tries to convince Albert that no one will make the connection:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Now, just tell me who the devil should know in France that the officer Fernand and the Count of Morcerf are one and the same person? and who cares now about Yanina, which was taken as long ago as the year 1822 or 1823?""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yet Albert is unconvinced, and he goes to demand that Beauchamp issue a retraction of the article. At one point in the conversation Beauchamp says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Do you insist on this retractation so far as to kill me if I do not make it, although I have repeated more than once, and affirmed on my honor, that I was ignorant of the thing with which you charge me, and although I still declare that it is impossible for anyone but you to recognize the Count of Morcerf under the name of Fernand?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To me this seems to be essentially the same argument given by Monte Cristo – while Albert's father the Count of Morcerf is indeed named Fernand, that is not enough to make people think that the Fernand spoken of in the newspaper is in fact Albert's father.</p>

<p>However, in the edition containing notes by Keith Wren of Kent University, the following note appears on the last sentence above:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Fernand</em> clearly incorrect: Dumas means Albert</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am having trouble understanding this. The sentence seems to make perfect sense using the name Fernand, as Beauchamp is saying that no one will recognize the Count of Morcerf under the name of Fernand (despite Fernand being his actual given name). To replace Fernand with Albert would seem to make no sense – Beauchamp would be saying that no one would recognize the Count of Morcerf under the name Albert, which has nothing to do with what was written in the newspaper.</p>

<p>Am I missing something here, or is this note just wrong?</p>

I would think about his name until after a while I could see the word as a shape, a vessel, and I would watch him liquefy and flow into it like cold molasses flowing out of the darkness into the vessel, until the jar stood full and motionless: a significant shape profoundly without Me like an empty door frame; and then I would find that I had forgotten the name of the jar. I would think: The shape of my body where I used to be a virgin is in the shape of a and I couldn't think Anse, couldn't remember Anse. It was not that I could think of myself as no longer unvirgin, because I was three now. And when I would think Cash and Darl that way until their names would die and solidify into a shape and then fade away, I would say, All right. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter what they call them.</p>
  
  <p>And so when Cora Tull would tell me I was not a true mother, I would think how words go straight up in a thin, line, quick and harmless, and how terribly doing goes along the earth, clinging to it, so that after a while the two lines are too far apart for the same person to straddle from one to the other and that <strong>sin and love and fear are just sounds that people who never sinned nor loved nor feared have for what they never had and cannot have until they forget the words</strong>. Like Cora, who could never even cook.</p>
  
  <p>She would tell me what I owed to my children and to Anse and to God. I gave Anse the children. I did not ask for them. I did not even ask him for what he could have given me: not-Anse. That was my duty to him, to not ask that, and that duty I fulfilled. I would be I; I would let him be the shape and echo of his word. That was more than he asked, because he could not have asked for that and been Anse, using himself so with a word.</p>

"Were the footnotes included in the original text of the 1002nd Tale of Scheherezade?","<p>The short story ""The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Scheherezade"" by Edgar Allan Poe details a great many wonders of the more modern world being described by Scheherezade to her husband, in terms familiar to them, in such a way that they would have sounded preposterous to people of their time.</p>

<p>In my edition of the Collected Works of Poe, this story comes with multiple footnotes to specify the exact nature as we know it of each wonder that Scheherezade describes.

"Did Pilate have a vision of Woland/Satan?","<p>In ""Master and Margarita"", after hearing from Berlioz that Jesus was a fictional character, Woland starts to describe the meeting between procurator Pilate and prisoner Yeshua Ha-Notsri, saying that ""he was there, hiding"". </p>

<p>I always assumed that he indeed was somewhere in the background, but then I've found this fragment, that describes Pilate reaction, when shortly after deciding to let Yeshua go (well ""imprisoning"" him in procurator's mansion), he finds that Yeshua is also accused of questioning Cesar's rule: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Pilate another parchment.
       'What else is there? ' enquired Pilate and frowned.<br>
       Having  read the further evidence  a change  came over his  expression.
  Whether it  was blood flowing back into his neck and  face or from something
  else that  occurred,  his skin changed from yellow to red-brown and his eyes
  appeared to collapse. Probably caused by the increased blood-pressure in his
  temples, something happened to the Procurator's  sight. <strong>He seemed to see the
  prisoner's head vanish  and  another appear in  its place,  bald and crowned
  with a spiked golden diadem. The skin  of the forehead was split by a round,
  livid  scar  smeared  with  ointment.  A  sunken,  toothless  mouth  with  a
  capricious, pendulous lower  lip.</strong> Pilate had  the  sensation  that the pink
  columns of his balcony  and the roofscape of Jerusalem below and  beyond the
  garden had all vanished, drowned in the thick foliage of cypress groves. His
  hearing, too,  was  strangely  affected--there  was a  sound  as of  distant
  trumpets,  muted and threatening, and  a nasal voice could clearly be  heard
  arrogantly intoning the words: ' The law pertaining to high treason . . .'</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is that supposed to be a vision of dead Yeshua (but then ""golden diadem""?), the ascension of Yeshua-as-Jesus (but then I've never heard about mutilated Jesus described as ""toothless"") or maybe it is Woland/Satan that Pilate sees?</p>

"In what way was Dr. Robert Stadler based on Robert Oppenheimer?","<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Atlas_Shrugged_characters#Dr._Robert_Stadler"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikipedia</a> describes Dr. Robert Stadler from <em>Atlas Shrugged</em> as follows:</p>

  <p>A former professor at Patrick Henry University, and along with colleague Hugh Akston, mentor to Francisco d'Anconia, John Galt and Ragnar Danneskjöld. He has since become a sell-out, one who had great promise but squandered it for social approval, to the detriment of the free. He works at the State Science Institute where all his inventions are perverted for use by the military, including the instrument of his demise: Project X (Xylophone). The character was, in part, modeled on J. Robert Oppenheimer, whom Rand had interviewed for an earlier project, and his part in the creation of nuclear weapons. To his former student Galt, Stadler represents the epitome of human evil, as the ""man who knew better"" but chose not to act for the good.</p>

<p>(It cites Ayn Rand's journals as a source for these claims, which I unfortunately do <em>not</em> have access to at this time).</p>

<p>In what way was Stadler based on Oppenheimer? Since Stadler's defining characteristic was being the man that knew better, did Ayn Rand view Oppenheimer in the same way? What did Oppenheimer know better than to do - work on nuclear weapons? (Wikipedia seems to imply as much). If so, why did she oppose his involvement with that?</p>

<p>I can see how Project X was analogous to nuclear weapons in one sense, but Dr. Stadler was only loosely aware of the project (although he was admittedly ignorant largely by his own choice) whereas Oppenheimer personally supervised the research into the nuclear bomb, so does this analogy ""break down"" at some point?</p>

"Why did Robert Stadler claim that John Galt was ""probably a second assistant bookkeeper somewhere""?","<p>When Dagney Taggert went to see Dr. Robert Stadler at the State Science Institute, in explanation for his mistrust of humans and human reason, he told the story of his three students:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""These three men, these three who held all the hope which the gift of intelligence ever proffered, these three from whom we expected such a magnificent future - one of them was Francisco d'Anconia, who became a depraved playboy. Another was Ragnar Danneskjold, who became a plain bandit. So much for the promise of the human mind.""<br>
  ""Who was the third one?"" [Dagney] asked.<br>
  He shrugged. ""The third one did not achieve even that sort of notorious distinction. He vanished without a trace - into the great unknown of mediocrity. He is probably a second assistant bookkeeper somewhere.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I realize that Ayn Rand couldn't reveal that his third student was John Galt at that point, but why did he say that?</p>

<p>Dr. Stadler <em>had</em> shown considerable degree of obliviousness (both feigned and real - he appeared to be only dimly aware of the statement issued by Dr. Floyd Farris, he had to be reminded that Taggart Transcontinental was building a new branch line from Rearden Metal, and he pretended not to know about the properties of Rearden Metal); he appeared to have lost much of his will for personally investigating things at that point (such as Floyd Farris's activity). Was he simply too oblivious to know the phrase ""Who is John Galt?""</p>

<p>Alternatively, is he kidding himself about it being a different John Galt? (I have a vague recollection that that's the case from later in the book, but I can't remember exactly where). Or is he lying? And why didn't he actually state John Galt's name?</p>

Foster. p. 247 Middle.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>  The big, often very uncomfortable, ideas run rampant in those disquieting categories, “minority” and “postcolonial” fiction. That’s nearly inevitable. How can a novel by an African American or African Caribbean writer not take stock of the legacy of slavery and racist mistreatment? How can an African or Indian novel, or any other from a former outpost of empire, not speak to, among other things, the experience of oppression or the chaos that so often follows when the oppressor withdraws? Chinua Achebe has a famous essay of complaint against Joseph Conrad’s Heart of Darkness, itself a pretty dense little novella of ideas, but his better rejoinders are his fiction from Things Fall Apart forward. The essay states his ideas; the novels embody them. History, as I suggest elsewhere, is the one inescapable fact. Stephen Dedalus’s “<strong>History is the nightmare from which I’m trying to awake, [bold mine]</strong>” is merely a sign of his callowness. Writers as outwardly different as Salman Rushdie, R. K. Narayan, Kiran Desai, Caryl Phillips, Toni Morrison, Alice Walker, Louise Erdrich, and Edward P. Jones have in common the making of fiction filled with ideas in response to what history has handed them. [...]</p>

<li><em>The Mayor of Casterbridge</em> ... I didn't finish this one, but in spite of its often gut-wrenching twists and turns, at least <em>some</em> of the main characters end up contentedly married.</li>

"Why did all of the Taggart Transcontinental engineers volunteer to drive the first train on the John Galt Line?","<p>Early on in the book, the engineer running the Comet stopped for hours at a broken signal and spent hours waiting for someone to tell him what to do.</p>

<p>However, later we see that almost every engineer working for Taggart Transcontinental volunteered for the first run of the John Galt Line (and that numerous other staff members volunteered for other positions as well). The only exception were 3 who were incapable of doing so for various reasons (e.g. the fact that one of them was in jail for reckless driving).</p>

<p>I suppose that it's <em>possible</em> that the aforementioned engineer of the <em>Comet</em> was either one of the three or had left the company by then, but there's a good chance that he was one of the people to volunteer. Even if he <em>wasn't</em>, odds are there were plenty of people like him who volunteered.</p>

"When was young Cosette's bedtime?","<p>While the song ""Come to Me"" was probably not intended as a treatise on astronomical timekeeping or 19th-century French child-rearing, some of Fantine's lines (taken at face value) fit together for a remarkably specific implication about her daughter's bedtime. Cosette is roughly 8 years old at this point.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>it's past your bedtime</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So the bedtime is <em>earlier</em> than the ""now"" of the song.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>soon it will be night ... Don't you see the evening star appearing?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So ""now"" is twilight, just after sunset.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Don't you hear the winter wind is crying?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And it is winter, so we know that sunset is relatively early. Because in this period I believe clocks were set locally by the sun rather than by time zones, the sun would be highest at noon and would set <em>no later than</em> 6 pm in the winter. The lines seem to fit together like a logic puzzle.</p>

<p>Is the month of Fantine's death known? <a href=""http://lesmiserables.wikia.com/wiki/Fantine"" rel=""noreferrer"">Once source</a> puts it in December, <a href=""http://www.angelfire.com/pq/lesmis/chron.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">another</a> in March -- both consistent with the ""winter"" reference. At the latitude of Montreuil-sur-Mer, sunset would be about 4:15 pm in December, reaching 6 pm in March. The expectation for 8-year-old Cosette to be in bed before 6 pm, and possibly much sooner, seems unreasonably early.</p>

<p>There are many potential ways to explain the apparent implications:</p>

<ol>
<li>Fantine is emotional and hallucinating as she dies, and her time references are not precise.</li>
<li>Fantine has not been caring for Cosette day-to-day and may not know what a reasonable bedtime for her child would be.</li>
<li>""Bedtime"" might mean the time to <em>begin</em> getting ready for bed -- although in modern English it seems to refer to ""lights out"".</li>
<li>Attempting a scientific interpretation of the lyrics is inappropriate.</li>
<li>Or maybe the lyrics are actually telling us something interesting, that children in this time and place did go to bed <em>very early</em> by modern standards, perhaps due to the need to get up and perform chores well before dawn.</li>

Yeah, I know that 7 is a magically significant number, but 1 (the number of counterclockwise stirs) isn't, and neither is 2 (the number of stirs in the original directions), so really, I could ask how either of them came up with <em>any</em> of their numbers for stirs - it seems quite arbitrary.</p>

  I smell like palm trees, nothing but exotic on me<br>
  Hoes get erotic on me, I put the pipe down<br>
  Stick the pipe in her mouth tell her pipe down<br>
  Now lick a shot for niggas doing life inside<br>
  Grabbing you by the neck, sticking the knife inside<br>
  It's B-R-double-O-K, double A-K brining trouble your way<br>
  Knock niggas out, they can't get off the ground<br>
  Shell cases found, the cops get off the ground<br>

"What do people mean when they refer to a work as ""Dostoevskian""?","<p>I hear this term thrown around a lot, in connection to a variety of different works. They don't all share the same central themes, though - at least not necessarily. But they do all tend to be connected in a pretty basic way: they're all fairly grim.</p>

<p>Online definitions circularly say that ""Dostoevskian"" means ""in the style of Fyodor Dostoevsky,"" which isn't particularly helpful.</p>

<p>What aspects of his works are typically specifically referred to by this term? Do people mean to say that a work is nihilistic, or explores seemingly irrational behavior? Or do they mean something else entirely?</p>

"Why did Calaf offer Turandot the deal?","<p>In Puccini's <em>Turandot</em>, after Calaf successfully answers her riddles, Turandot begs her father not to make her marry him. (That's pretty rich given that the opera implies that she had at least 26 people killed for not being able to answer the riddles, but that's an issue for a different question). In response, Calaf states that he wants her to love him too and offers to call the whole thing off if she can discover his name by dawn. Why does he offer this? I understand that he wants her to love him, but why does he think that that would help?</p>

"What is Bob Dylan's definition of literature in his Nobel Prize lecture?","<p>Bob Dylan's <a href=""https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/2016/dylan-lecture.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Nobel Literature Prize Literature</a> starts off with the following paragraph:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When I first received this Nobel Prize for Literature, I got to wondering exactly how my songs related to literature. I wanted to reflect on it and see where the connection was. I'm going to try to articulate that to you. And most likely it will go in a roundabout way, but I hope what I say will be worthwhile and purposeful.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He does, in fact, go about it in a rather roundabout way, describing various books and their influence on him and his music.</p>

<p>He concludes with the following paragraphs:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So what does it all mean? Myself and a lot of other songwriters have been influenced by these very same themes. And they can mean a lot of different things. If a song moves you, that's all that's important. I don't have to know what a song means. I've written all kinds of things into my songs. And I'm not going to worry about it – what it all means. When Melville put all his old testament, biblical references, scientific theories, Protestant doctrines, and all that knowledge of the sea and sailing ships and whales into one story, I don't think he would have worried about it either – what it all means.</p>
  
  <p>...</p>
  
  <p>When Odysseus in The Odyssey visits the famed warrior Achilles in the underworld – Achilles, who traded a long life full of peace and contentment for a short one full of honor and glory –  tells Odysseus it was all a mistake. ""I just died, that's all."" There was no honor. No immortality. And that if he could, he would choose to go back and be a lowly slave to a tenant farmer on Earth rather than be what he is – a king in the land of the dead – that whatever his struggles of life were, they were preferable to being here in this dead place.</p>
  
  <p>That's what songs are too. Our songs are alive in the land of the living. But songs are unlike literature. They're meant to be sung, not read. The words in Shakespeare's plays were meant to be acted on the stage. Just as lyrics in songs are meant to be sung, not read on a page. And I hope some of you get the chance to listen to these lyrics the way they were intended to be heard: in concert or on record or however people are listening to songs these days. I return once again to Homer, who says, ""Sing in me, oh Muse, and through me tell the story.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is he making the argument that song lyrics can be literature (in spite of being primarily a performance literature) in the same way that Shakespeare is literature in spite of being intended to be performance?</p>

<p>What can we infer about Bob Dylan's definition of literature from this lecture?</p>

<p>What, exactly, are the papers that the judge had signed, and why did her ex-husband have them? Is this referring to divorce papers, or some other papers that the ex-husband had acquired?</p>

<p>Also, does the line that ""He shot me once, but I shot him twice"" imply that this was also self-defense, or was the main character the instigator here?</p>

The (unnamed) protagonist struggles to help New York to 'breathe' and be 'born', with the help of a man named Paulo, who apparently personifies the city of Sao Paulo. At the end of the story, the protagonist himself has taken on this adviser role in another city, and he now seems to personify New York.</p>

<p><strong>How does this personification process work?</strong> So many questions are raised - how did his role change from midwife to bearer of the city's soul? how did he become rich after the transformation? will he still have a normal human lifespan, and if so what happens to the city when he dies? - which, as far as I can tell, are left unanswered in the story. So my question is, first, is any of this actually answered somewhere that I've missed - and if not, <strong>why is so much left unanswered?</strong> What does it add to the story to <em>not</em> explain these things to us?</p>

"What is the significance of the ""suffocation scene"" at Tchermashnya in Brothers Karamazov?","<p>I'm re-reading <em>The Brothers Karamazov</em> and was struck again by a strange scene whose meaning isn't immediately clear to me.</p>

<p>In ""Lyagavy"", Part 3, Book 8, Chapter 2 of <em>The Brothers Karamazov</em>, Mitya rushes to Tchermashnya at the underhanded suggestion of Samsonov, in a desperate attempt to come up with money. Finding Lyagavy drunk, he decides after an unsuccessful effort to speak to him that he needs to stay the night until Lyagavy becomes sober. In the middle of that night, he awakes with a searing headache and realizes that he almost died because of the fire fumes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But his head ached more and more. He sat without moving, and unconsciously dozed off and fell asleep as he sat. He seemed to have slept for two hours or more. He was waked up by his head aching so unbearably that he could have screamed. There was a hammering in his temples, and the top of his head ached. It was a long time before he could wake up fully and understand what had happened to him.</p>
  
  <p>At last he realized that the room was full of charcoal fumes from the stove, and that he might die of suffocation. And the drunken peasant still lay snoring. The candle guttered and was about to go out. Mitya cried out, and ran staggering across the passage into the forester's room. The forester waked up at once, but hearing that the other room was full of fumes, to Mitya's surprise and annoyance, accepted the fact with strange unconcern, though he did go to see to it.</p>
  
  <p>“But he's dead, he's dead! and ... what am I to do then?” cried Mitya frantically.</p>
  
  <p>They threw open the doors, opened a window and the chimney. Mitya brought a pail of water from the passage. First he wetted his own head, then, finding a rag of some sort, dipped it into the water, and put it on Lyagavy's head. The forester still treated the matter contemptuously, and when he opened the window said grumpily:</p>
  
  <p>“It'll be all right, now.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mitya eventually goes back to sleep, and (as far as I know) the incident goes no further and is never mentioned again.</p>

<p>Dostoevsky is such a purposeful writer that I have a hard time believing that this is just a throwaway incident. <strong>Is there any special significance, symbolic or otherwise, to this event?</strong> Is it only meant to exacerbate the extreme mental turmoil Mitya is going through at the time?</p>

"Fairy tale story in two parts: ""as I first heard it"" and ""when I wanted to know more""","<p>I read this book some years ago, probably around 2010, though it was definitely older than that. It had a fairly short and simple title, of the kind one might expect to find on a fairy tale: ""The Lost World"" or ""The Princess's Journey"" or something in that vein. My copy was hardback, the cover mainly white with a stylised drawing running across both back and front, featuring a few people, one rather prominently on the front, and a landscape with mountains.</p>

<p>At first I thought it might have been written by Philippa Gregory, but I checked through <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippa_Gregory#Bibliography"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">her bibliography</a> and couldn't see it there. The author's surname definitely began with an early letter in the alphabet (A to H) - I remember that from where the book was in my bookcase - and it was probably written by a woman. <strong>Edit:</strong> on further reflection, I think the author may have been called Maria, with a surname starting with G and possibly Gl.</p>

<p>I don't actually remember much of the plot. It was a typical fairy-tale-ish type story: a princess going on a quest? meeting a poor boy in a forest? that kind of thing. The really memorable and distinctive part was that the story was told <em>twice</em> in the same book: once in a relatively short and simple way, prefaced by ""<strong>this is the story of <em>[title of book]</em> as I first heard it</strong>"", and then again in a longer way with more details included, prefaced by ""<strong>this is the story of <em>[title of book]</em> as it was told to me when I wanted to know more</strong>"". In their essential details, both stories were the same, but there may have been some actual differences between them as well as just extra material in the second retelling.</p>

I'm interested in how much of the wording of the poem was designed to be WWI-specific. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>clearly ""took the fire with him, and a knife"" is <em>not</em> specifically part of the war allegory, as almost exactly the same words appear in the Genesis link above;</li>
<li>I suspect that ""parapets and trenches"" <em>is</em> a war reference, and that all Abraham builds in any version of the Bible story is an altar;</li>
<li>what about, for instance, ""belts and straps""? Do they appear in some version of the Bible story, or are they meant to represent the uniforms worn by young conscripted soldiers?</li>
</ul>

<p>Most of all, I'm interested in <strong>""the Ram of Pride""</strong>. In the Bible story, Abraham sacrifices a ram instead of his son. But does the symbolic identification of this ram with Pride have any Biblical background, or is it an invention of the WWI poets?</p>

"In Beatrice and Virgil, why does Erasmus kill Mendelssohn?","<p>In Yann Martel's <em>Beatrice and Virgil</em>, there is a bizarre scene where Henry's dog, Erasmus, gets rabies and attacks Henry's cat, Mendelssohn. Because of this, both characters need to be killed: Mendelssohn because of the injury sustained in the attack and Erasmus because he has rabies. </p>

<p>What's bizarre about the scene is that although the vet claims the dog had rabies, there is virtually no logical explanation for how the dog could have gotten rabies. From page 161:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How their dog, who was supposed to have been vaccinated, caught <em>rabies</em>, which turned out to be the diagnosis, was a question that neither the vet nor the shelter were they had got him could answer. There are all kinds of wild animals in big cities that have rabies, he was told. Worse even: the plague. But proper sanitary conditions prevent the spread of these diseases and they don't normally jump to pets. Perhaps the vaccine had failed. Henry wondered if Erasmus could have contracted rabies at the taxidermist's store. The notion was ridiculous; nonetheless, it trotted in his head.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The even stranger thing is that the death of Erasmus and Mendelssohn, although clearly important to Henry, is not mentioned once later in the book. The mystery is never resolved.</p>

<p>I have two questions about the scene. First, on a practical note, is there ever a conclusive explanation for why Erasmus gets rabies? (It's very possible that the explanation is intentionally mysterious). Second, what is the meaning of this scene, and how does it contribute to the message of the rest of the book? I expect answers to answer both questions, in large part because they are interrelated; you can't answer one without considering the other. In other words, if your answer is just that this scene represents an improbable event, you also have to explain why this improbable event is such an important scene in the novel.</p>

"Why did the police go to The Orchard Keeper?","<p>In Cormac McCarthy's <em>The Orchard Keeper</em>, the eponymous old man is visited by the cops. They do not get a warm welcome.</p>

<p>Why did they go there at all, and why was the old man so hostile to them?</p>

<p>I might have just missed the fact that it was spelled out in the book, but if not, there are three possible reasons I can see for the cops to want to question him:</p>

<ul>
<li>They might have found the moonshine hidden on his property</li>
<li>They might have found the body hidden on his property</li>
<li>They might have discovered that the government ""tank"" on his property was shot up</li>
</ul>

<p>The first one is perhaps most likely, because we know the police were investigating the moonshine case after they found a lot of liquor in the car in the creek. If that's the case, though, I don't understand the old man's hostility, <em>unless</em> he himself believed they were there for one of the other two reasons.</p>

<p>It could've been the second reason (we already know some kids had found the body before the old man did), but if I recall correctly the body disappeared at some point before the cops came (although I don't think I understand who moved it).</p>

<p>If it were the third reason, which I guess is also likely, why did he respond with such hostility? Surely his crime, in this case, wasn't too egregious? What was the ""tank"", exactly?</p>

"Is there any evidence that this character in Harry Potter was a double agent all along, prior to the revelation?","<p>Warning: MASSIVE spoilers ahead. If you haven't read the last Harry Potter book, but plan to do so, turn back now</p>

<hr>

<p>Throughout the entire Harry Potter series, there was one character who was the comic 'bad guy' - designed to be disliked. This of course is Snape. </p>

<p>We think that he is a Death Eater, working for Voldemort, with a personal disliking of Harry. </p>

<p>However, in the final book in chapter 33 'The Prince's (Snape's) Tale', that all changes.</p>

<p>Our entire view of Snape changes, and we learn he isn't who we thought he was. He <em>wasn't</em> working against Dumbledore and for Voldemort, but actually the other way round:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Hide them all, then,"" he croaked. ""Keep her—them—safe. Please.""<br>
  ""And what will you give me in return, Severus?""<br>
  ""In—in return?"" Snape gaped at Dumbledore, and Harry expected him to protest, but after a long moment he said, ""Anything.""<br>
  ...  </p>
  
  <p>""Snape raised his eyebrows and his tone was sardonic as he asked,<br>
  ""Are you intending to let him kill you?""<br>
  [Dumbledore]: ""Certainly not. <em>You</em> must kill me.""<br>
  ...  </p>
  
  <p>""Severus Snape wasn’t yours,"" said Harry. ""Snape was Dumbledore’s, Dumbledore’s from the moment you started hunting down my mother.""  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>We learn all this when Harry sees the memories he gave him just before he died.</p>

<p>This is possibly the biggest twist in the entire Harry Potter series. It shocked many, and seems completely unexpected.</p>

<p>But maybe it <em>shouldn't</em> have been so unexpected...</p>

<p><strong>Was there any evidence prior to the revelation that Snape is actually a 'double-agent' and not who we thought he was?</strong></p>

"Does Portia subconsciously influence Bassanio's choice of casket?","<p>When Bassanio is about to make his choice of the three caskets at Belmont - a choice upon which rests his chances of marriage to Portia - she calls for music and singing while he ponders.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Music, whilst BASSANIO comments on the caskets to himself</em></p>
  
  <p>SONG.<br>
  Tell me where is fancy bred,<br>
  Or in the heart, or in the head?<br>

  <p><sub>-- The Merchant of Venice, Act 3, Scene 2, Lines 64-73</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Is this song an attempt by Portia to influence Bassanio subconsciously towards lead?</strong></p>

<p>The meaning of the song is about ""fancy"", superficial liking; it suggests that what appeals to the eye is not necessarily what is truly valuable. And in a subtle piece of wordplay, the first three lines of the song all rhyme with ""lead"". Portia is already in love with Bassanio, although she <a href=""https://literature.stackexchange.com/a/2318/17"">dare not admit it</a>, and she's certainly clever enough to set up such a scheme, in order to prod him towards choosing the right casket but still maintain plausible deniability. On the other hand, perhaps I'm reading too much into this, and underestimating Portia's honour and dedication to the rules imposed by her late father.</p>

"Given Anton's attitudes expressed to Budakh, why did Earth start Progressors?","<p>In conversation with Doctor Budakh - and later Arata, Rumata (Anton) basically states the Earth's - and his personal - party line about non-interference with foreign cultures:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>— Что ж, — сказал он, — извольте. Я сказал бы всемогущему: «Создатель, я не знаю твоих планов, может быть, ты и не собираешься делать людей добрыми и счастливыми. Захоти этого! Так просто этого достигнуть! Дай людям вволю хлеба, мяса и вина, дай им кров и одежду. Пусть исчезнут голод и нужда, а вместе с тем и все, что разделяет людей».<br>
  ... — <strong>Бог ответил бы вам: «Не пойдет это на пользу людям. Ибо сильные вашего мира отберут у слабых то, что я дал им, и слабые по-прежнему останутся нищими».</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>[I'm paraphrasing here, not direct-translating, for brevity - DVK]</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It won't help the people to give them enough nourishment, housing and
  clothes - the strong will take the goods from the weak, and the weak
  will stay in poverty.    — Я бы попросил бога оградить слабых,
  «Вразуми жестоких правителей», сказал бы я.   — <strong>Жестокость есть
  сила. Утратив жестокость, правители потеряют силу, и другие жестокие
  заменят их</strong>.  </p>
  
  <p>It won't help to protect the weak by making the strong weaker, as the
  new rulers who are harsh will arise to replace the ones you made

  <p>It won't help to punish the harsh ones, as the ones just less weak
  than them will arise and turn harsh, requiring to punish <em>everyone</em>.</p>
  
  <p>— Тебе виднее, всемогущий. Сделай тогда просто так, чтобы люди

  спутниках…   — Я мог бы сделать и это, — сказал он. — <strong>Но стоит ли
  лишать человечество его истории? Стоит ли подменять одно человечество
  другим? Не будет ли это то же самое, что стереть это человечество с
  лица земли и создать на его месте новое?</strong>    Будах, сморщив лоб,
  молчал обдумывая. Румата ждал. За окном снова тоскливо заскрипели
  подводы. Будах тихо проговорил:  </p>
  
  <p>And it won't do to mind-wipe everyone and turn them into Earth-model
  communars. Since basically it's the same as killing them and replacing
  them with earthlings.</p>
  
  <p>— Тогда, господи, сотри нас с лица земли и создай заново более
  совершенными… или еще лучше, оставь нас и дай нам идти своей дорогой. 
  — Сердце мое полно жалости, — медленно сказал Румата. — Я не могу
  этого сделать.</p>

"Does 'literary fiction' neccessarily have to be reality-based, or can it have fantastical themes/elements?","<p>There seems to be a great deal of ambiguity or confusion regarding the definition of ‘literary fiction’. Particularly, it is never really made clear to me whether literary fiction can also be speculative fiction at the same time. </p>

<p>On one hand, ‘literary fiction’ is often defined or talked about in such a way that suggests it has to be based on real life (i.e.: ‘serious’ fiction). But, at the same time, I have come across some definitions that say literary fiction can be ‘cross genre’ (unlike other types of fiction). </p>

<p>So which is it?</p>

<p>The main problem I have with a reality-based definition of literary fiction is that it seems obvious to me that speculative fiction, such as fantasy, romance, sci-fi (especially futuristic) and horror (especially psychological horror), can easily achieve and fulfill the sorts of things that ‘literary fiction’ is usually defined as fulfilling; such as a deep examination of the human condition, presenting a new philosophical outlook, beautiful prose, and so on. Even if most books in these genres don’t do this, there are many that do. Would they therefore be classified as ‘literary fiction’? Or are they excluded because they are speculative and not reality-based?</p>

"What’s up with Slothrop the paedophile?","<p>Sexual child abuse features centrally in <em>Gravity’s Rainbow</em>. While the sexual abuse of children is certainly a valid topic for a novel, I have become more and more disturbed by Pynchon's handling of Slothrop and Bianca. While I can justify the centrally themed child abuse in <em>Lolita</em> and <em>Finnegans Wake</em>, I am less sure about <em>Gravity's Rainbow</em>.    </p>

<p>Slothrop was sexually abused as a child by Laszlo Jamf, as part of an experiment involving inducing erections in the kid. It turns out that Slothrop's father had ""sold"" him, for Jamf's experiments, to pay for Slothrop's education. The entire novel is in essence Slothrop's response to this childhood horror and it's consequences. </p>

<p>Then Franz Pökler, at the  Zwölfkinder,   fantasizes incest with his daughter  Ilse, who is permited annual summertime visits, although Franz doubts the girl who visits is really is Ilse. Instead of acting on the fantasy, he becomes ""Ilse""'s ""father"".</p>

<p>I feel that there is no problem with Pynchon's handling of these first two examples. </p>

<p>But then there is Bianca! </p>

<p>Slothrop meets Greta Erdmann, the actress, who is looking for her lost daughter, Bianca. They head for Swinemünde, where  Bianca is supposedly on a boat. The Anubis arrives and Greta and Slothrop board, where they find an giant orgy. Slothrop and Greta participate. Slothrop catches sight of Bianca, who is eleven or twelve, ""a knockout."" Mother (Greta) and daughter (Bianca) then perform a public S/M act, with the mother fairly brutally slapping the little girl’s bottom, which Bianca seems to enjoy. Slothrop dreams about Llandudno, ""where Lewis Carroll wrote that Alice in Wonderland."" Bianca appears at his bedside, ready and willing. They have sex.</p>

<p>All very titillating and unreflective.</p>

<p>After sex, she asks him to escape with her: ""I'm a child, I know how to hide. I can hide you too."" Slothrop leaves without her and Bianca is lost again. </p>

<p>The only possible reflection demanded for our participation, is that later, Slothrop, when listening to Margherita's story, is overcome by nausea, but it is not even clear at what.</p>

<p>What is the reader to make of Slothrop and Bianca? What is the purpose/meaning/role behind Slothrop and Bianca? Or is this an example of Pynchon's  ""proto-fascism"", as he describes some
of his writings in <em>Slow Learner</em>?</p>

"How can we explain the porter's order of events in The Arabian Nights?","<p>In  <a href=""https://books.google.com/books?id=IbYQAAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=the%20arabian%20nights%20translated%20by%20husain%20haddawy&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiztKyd5YvdAhUJMt8KHQxlBCQQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>The Arabian Nights</em>, translated by Husain Haddawy</a>, the following chronology appears in The Story of the Porter and the Three Ladies on the 28th night (my emphasis):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>She walked before him until she stopped at the door of a house, and
  when she knocked, an <strong>old Christian</strong> came down, received a dinar
  from her and handed her an olive green jug of wine...</p>
  
  <p>the porter lifted the basket and followed her until she stopped at the
  <strong>fruit vendor's...</strong></p>
  
  <p>Then she stopped at the <strong>butcher's</strong>...</p>
  
  <p>The porter, wondering at all these purchases, placed his basket on his
  head and followed her until she came to the <strong>grocer's</strong>...</p>
  
  <p>The porter carried his basket and followed her until she came to the
  <strong>dry grocer's</strong>...</p>
  
  <p>The porter carried the basket and followed her until she came to the
  <strong>confectioner's</strong>...</p>
  
  <p>She smiled and walked ahead until she came to the <strong>druggist's</strong>...</p>
  
  <p>(p. 80-81)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thus, the order of places that the porter visited was:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Old Christian > Fruit Vendor > Butcher > Grocer > Dry Grocer > Confectioner >
  Druggist.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, on the 37th night the porter recounts the events as follows (my emphasis):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Mistress, you know that the reason I came to this place was that I
  was hired as a porter by this shopper, who led me from the <strong>vintner</strong> to
  the <strong>butcher</strong>, and from the butcher to the <strong>greengrocer</strong>, and from the
  greengrocer to the <strong>fruit vendor</strong>, and from the fruit vendor to the <strong>dry
  grocer</strong>, then to the <strong>confectioner</strong>, to the <strong>druggist</strong>, and finally to this
  house.</p>
  
  <p>(p. 104)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thus, according to the porter the order was as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Vintner > Butcher > Greengrocer > Fruit Vendor > Dry Grocer >
  Confectioner > Druggist.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is clearly different from the order mentioned above. For a visual aid, here are the two orders next to each other:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Old Christian > Fruit Vendor > Butcher > Grocer > Dry Grocer > Confectioner >
  Druggist.</p>
  
  <p>Vintner > Butcher > Greengrocer > Fruit Vendor > Dry Grocer >
  Confectioner > Druggist.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think it is safe to assume that the old Christian from the first version is the vintner from the second version, and that  the grocer from the first version is identical with the greengrocer from the second version, so those discrepancies are taken care of. However, in the first version the fruit vendor was visited between the vintner and the butcher, while in the second version the fruit vendor was visited between the greengrocer and the dry grocer.</p>

<p>What is the explanation for this discrepancy?</p>

<ul>
<li>Is this simply an issue with this particular translation?</li>
<li>Is it an authorial error?</li>
<li>Is it meant to be part of the story that the porter changed (or forgot) the
events?</li>
<li>Is it just to see if the reader is paying attention?</li>
<li>Something else?</li>
</ul>

<p>Has anyone else ever noted this discrepancy and possibly tried to explain it? (A very quick Google search did not turn up anything.)</p>

  <p><em>A Tale of a Tub</em> is divided between various forms of digression and

  <p>The ""tale"", or narrative, is an allegory of three brothers, <em>Peter</em>,

  <p>Each brother represents one of the primary branches of Christianity in
  the West. </p>

  <li><p><strong>Peter</strong> (named for Saint Peter) stands in for the <em>Roman Catholic</em> Church.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Jack</strong> (named for John Calvin, but whom Swift also connects to John of
  Leyden) represents the various dissenting <em>Protestant</em> churches such as
  Baptists, Presbyterians, Quakers, Congregationalists and Anabaptists. </p></li>
  <li><p>The third brother, middle born and middle standing, is <strong>Martin</strong> (named
  for Martin Luther), whom Swift uses to represent the <em>'via media' of

<p>There was a boy, who has discovered that he has hypnotic powers. He hypnotizes a hypnotist, which leads to him being accepted into an institute for researching hypnotism. I think the name of the institute started with a 'S'?</p>

<p>One day he's walking, and meets a guy who's also a hypnotizer (they called it bending I think).

<p>The main character (it's possible his name started with either Q, W, V, X, or J) goes back to the institute, where the guy in charge records him hypnotizing to vote for someone in an election, and then creates a virus that will go through the computers and hypnotize people. Our main character calls up the guy who he met and tells him that the bad guy rigged the election.</p>

<p>The guy comes to his house and discovers that main character's parents have been hypnotized to commit suicide if the main character tries to stop the bad guy, and they have to stop them from doing that.</p>

<p>So then the guy who he met (tree something?) gets his band of benders and goes to stop the rigging. The main character hypnotizes the guy who the bad guy has under control to drop out of the race.

Destitute and desperate, she becomes an ""ambusher"" (<em>atajadora</em>), someone who preys on a lower class – the ""Indians"".  These women attack the darker-skinned indigenous people on their way to market, beat them until they give up their goods, and then, as if to justify themselves, hand over a few coins as ""payment."" </p>

<p>Racial dynamics certainly are a key theme in the story, but normally when I think of racism, I think of unfairly discriminating against someone because of their skin color, or taking advantage of someone's low social standing for one's own gain.  Modesta Gómez's actions can certainly be characterized that way, but she goes even further – as she is assaulting an young indigenous woman in order to take her wool blanket, she yells:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You damn Indian!  Now you're going to pay me for everything!</p>
  
  <p><sup>¡India desgraciada, me lo tenés que pagar todo junto!</sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don't understand why Modesta is demanding payment – recompense? – from the girl.  Nowhere in the story do indigenous people persecute her in any way.  Yet it seems as if she is here blaming <em>them</em> for the crimes perpetuated against her by the wealthy and middle class.</p>

<p>Given that this line marks the climax of the story, I'm sure it's essential to the author's point.  Why does Rosario Castellanos have her protagonist demanding payment from the ""Indian"" girl?</p>

"What does ""The Edge of Doom"" mean?","<p>The following stanza is from Robert Frost's <em>Into My Own</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One of my wishes is that those dark trees,<br>
      So old and firm they scarcely show the breeze,<br>
      Were not, as ’twere, the merest mask of gloom,<br>
      But stretched away unto the <strong>edge of doom</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(Emphasis mine.)</p>

<p>I am guessing that the ""edge of doom"" is referring to the end of time -- as in, The trees are stretching into the end of time and space. Is this reading correct? Where does the phrase the ""edge of doom"" come from? At first when I read it, I thought that the ""edge of doom"" was a dark reference (similar to ""mask of gloom""), but it seems to be closer to a wedding vow, such as ""Our marriage will last unto the edge of doom"".</p>

<p>The obvious, and most literal, interpretation would be that they're meant to be the industrial mills which were appearing all over England around the time Blake wrote this poem, in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. But I've heard other theories, such as that they're meant to represent churches (Blake was a ""radical Christian"" who had little time for the established church) or even the academic institutions of Oxford and Cambridge. I'm interested in seeing evidence for different interpretations here.</p>

"Do we know what prompted Orwell to write 1984?","<p>I just read through Orwell's short essay, <a href=""http://www.orwell.ru/library/articles/As_I_Please/english/efasc"">What is Fascism?</a> In it, Orwell defines fascism (or doesn't) with two sentences:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Why, then, cannot we have a clear and generally accepted definition of it? Alas! we shall not get one — not yet, anyway. To say why would take too long, but basically it is because it is impossible to define Fascism satisfactorily without making admissions which neither the Fascists themselves, nor the Conservatives, nor Socialists of any colour, are willing to make.</p>

<p>This essay was published in 1944. So we know that issues of modern politics, particularly those surrounding the state of the world at the time of WWII, seems to have (unsurprisingly) been on Orwell's mind for some time before he wrote the book. 1984 was published in 1949, five years after the writing of this essay.</p>

"What is the argument for Kuni being a worthy leader, when all others fail?","<p><em>The Grace of Kings</em> is deeply concerned with the mechanics of power - who has it; how to get it; how to keep it; what price you pay for it.</p>

<p>Through its course, the book surveys a great many rulers and would-be rulers. In each case, the book portrays power as a corrupting force, that turns rulers to paths of indulgence and self-preservation -- which sooner or later devastate the society being ruled, destroying the ruler as well. The book also points out that those most drawn to power are often the ones who will wield it least wisely.</p>

<p>To all this, Kuni is an exception. His wisdom in ruling seems smooth and unquestioned. This is apparent at every point - from the complete lack of repercussions for the looting of Pan, under his command (compare to the harsh judgement of Mata's character we're supposed to accept, when he is forced to make human sacrifice to Tazu); all the way to the utopian portrayal of the kingdoms united under his rule:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The beggar's face fell at this news. ""Then it is even more generous of you to share food with a stranger. You're certain your parents will not mind?""</p>
  
  <p>The boy laughed. ""There's no need to worry. King Kuni and Prime Minister Yelu ordered grain to be shipped from Gefica, and all of us have plenty to eat.</p>
  
  <p>""You like the king then? Even though he is not from Xana?""</p>
  
  <p>""We no longer speak of Xana,"" said the boy.</p>
  
  <p>""But that's your country!""</p>
  
  <p>The boy shook his head. ""This is Rui, an Island of Dara.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>What is it that makes Kuni so exceptional?</strong> Why is he worthy and successful, when all the others are not? What is it that makes him able to navigate the minefield of rebellion, leadership, and power, without succumbing to all the same traps that every other leader in the book does?</p>

"Why does Ruth breastfeed Milkman, and why is this considered scandelous?","<p>I'm reading Song of Solomon by Toni Morrison for a class, and I'm confused by this.</p>

<p>An important part of Milkman's life story is that his mother (Ruth) breastfed him later than normal. It's how he got his name:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>She felt him. His restraint, his courtesy, his indifference, all of which pushed her into fantasy. She had the distinct impression that his lips were pulling from her a thread of light. It was as though she were a cauldron issuing spinning gold. Like the miller's daughter--the one who sat at night in a straw-filled room, thrilled with the secret power Rumpelstiltskin had given her: to see golden thread stream from her very own shuttle. And that was the other part of her pleasure, a pleasure she hated to give up. So when Freddie the janitor, who liked to pretend he was a friend of the family and not just their flunky as well as their tenant, brought his rent to the doctor's house late one day and looked in the window past the evergreen, the terror that sprang to Ruth's eyes came from the quick realization that she was to lose fully half of what made her daily life bearable. Freddie, however, interpreted her look as simple shame, but that didn't stop him from grinning.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I be damn, Miss Rufie. When the last time I seen that? I don't even know the last time I seen that. I mean, ain't nothing wrong with it. I mean, old folks swear by it. It's just, you know, you don't see it up here much….” But his eyes were on the boy. Appreciative eyes that communicated some complicity she was excluded from. Freddie looked the boy up and down, taking in the steady but secretive eyes and the startling contrast between Ruth's lemony skin and the boy's black skin. “Used to be a lot of womenfolk nurse they kids a long time down South. Lot of 'em. But you don't see it much no more. I knew a family--the mother wasn't too quick, though--nursed hers till the boy, I reckon, was near 'bout thirteen. But that's a bit much, ain't it?” All the time he chattered, he rubbed his chin and looked at the boy. Finally he stopped, and gave a long low chuckle. He'd found the phrase he'd been searching for. “A milkman. That's what you got here, Miss Rufie. A natural milkman if ever I seen one. Look out, womens. Here he come. Huh!”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Later in Milkman's life, he is upset about this, but Ruth defends herself:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“You nursed me.”</p>
  
  <p>“Yes.”</p>
  
  <p>“Until I was…old. Too old.”</p>
  
  <p>Ruth turned toward her son. She lifted her head and looked deep into his eyes. “And I also prayed for you. Every single night and every single day. On my knees. Now you tell me. What harm did I do you on my knees?”</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Ruth claims that she didn't:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Milkman leaned his head against the cold handbar that was attached to the seat in front of him. He held it there, letting its chill circle his head. Then he turned to his mother. “Were you father when he was dead? Naked?”</p>

"Book about ""lesser"" and ""greater"" magic, with main protagonist who learns both?","<p>Can you identify this book? Here's what I remember of it...</p>

<p>A civilization had their home world ravaged by some kind of disaster.  Using ""Greater"" magic they made a portal to another world.</p>

<p>The story is about this civilization a long time after this disaster and there are two types of magic, ""Lesser"" and ""Greater"". Lesser magic is parlor tricks and small scale magic, whilst greater magic is capable of controlling the elements.</p>

<p>The main protagonist pursued a lesser mage and convinced the mage to teach him.</p>

<p>Sometime after he learned lesser magic, mages that study greater magic kidnap him after learning that he has the potential to learn greater magic (Greater magic is more rare than lesser).  The boy is taught how to use greater magic in a tower where he is unable to speak and is put through a harsh training that almost erases all aspects of what he learned as a lesser mage.</p>

<p>One thing that i remember about greater magic is their capacity to ""teleport""; every location that a mage wishes to go to must have a mural on the ground that the mage must go and memorize in order to return there.</p>

<p>I also remember something about an arena where the main protagonist (after learning both lesser and greater magic) goes to. In the arena is an old friend of his (?), and that person is fighting to the death against others. The main protagonist gets mad and uses his abilities as a mage to wreck the arena and to threaten/terrify the nobility that were amusing themselves using the arena.</p>

<p>At the end the main protagonist ends up making a giant school and proceeds to teach both lesser and greater magic in order to train students and make magic less ""taboo"" and rare.</p>

  And you fire till he is done in but they catch you at the border<br>
  And the mourners are all singin' as they drag you by your feet<br>
  But the hangman isn't hangin' and they put you on the street</p>

<p>The following chorus is repeated after each of the three verses:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You go back, Jack, do it again, wheels turinin' 'round and 'round<br>
  You go back, Jack, do it again</p>

<p>Second verse:</p>

<blockquote>

  In a room with your two timer, and you're sure you're near the end<br>
  Then you love a little wild one, and she brings you only sorrow<br>
  All the time you know she's smilin'; you'll be on your knees tomorrow</p>

"Are gender roles gone in the future in ""The Story of the Amulet"" by E. Nesbit?","<p>When the kids go into the future in <em>The Story of the Amulet</em>, it looks like gender roles have perhaps disappeared. Some of the relevant quotes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There was no one in the room, but in the next gallery, where the Assyrian things are and still were, they found a kind, stout man in a loose, blue gown, and stockinged legs.<br>
  <sub><em>The Story of the Amulet</em>, chapter 12</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, I may be interpreting this incorrectly, but in my experience a 'gown' is usually a type of dress, with the exception of a 'dressing-gown', which is more like a bathrobe. This could be incorrect, as I'm a modern American and the book is rather old and British. </p>

<p>More telling is this quote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>'Why, we're all working people,' said the lady; 'at least my husband's a carpenter.'</p>
  
  <p>'Good gracious!' said Anthea; 'but you're a lady!'</p>
  
  <p>'Ah,' said the lady, 'that quaint old word! Well, my husband will enjoy a talk with you...<br>
  <sub><em>The Story of the Amulet</em>, chapter 12</sub></p>

<p>This seems rather clearer:' lady'is a 'quaint old word', and both men and women work. </p>

"Retelling of Odysseus story with humour and anachronisms (audiobook)","<p>I heard this in audio form, probably on a cassette or maybe CD, borrowed from a public library in England in the early noughties (2001-2006). I don't know how old it was, or whether or not it was an audio adaptation of a published novel. Essentially it was a version of the Iliad (I don't <em>think</em> it also included the Odyssey, but I'm not certain) retold for a younger modern audience.</p>

<ul>
<li>It began with Odysseus as a young boy being attacked by a wild boar and rescued by his grandfather, who'd left the court after behaviour ""not fitting for a member of the royal family, eh?"" (I remember this phrase), and who teaches the young Odysseus the value of cunning.</li>
<li>Later on, a huge crowd of princes are pressed together for some occasion - possibly the wedding of Helen and Menelaus, or a competition for Helen's hand? Odysseus is too small to push his way to the front, but he tricks Big Ajax into going somewhere else so that he can take his place. When Big Ajax realises he's been tricked, a fight breaks out. Agamemnon breaks it up and shouts that ""this isn't a football match"".</li>
<li>When Odysseus pretends to be mad in order not to have to join the Trojan War, he shouts ""Plough the field! Plough the field! Plough the field!"" and ""Sow the seed! Sow the seed! Sow the seed!"" These lines I remember <em>very</em> clearly.</li>
<li>During the voyage to Troy, Philoctetes is showing off his archery skill, shooting burning arrows off the ship and shouting things like, ""This one's for Hector! This one's for Paris! This one's for - AAAARGH!"" as he shoots the arrow into his foot. ""Who's AAAARGH?"" someone else inquires. ""Odysseus jogged me!"" Philoctetes yells. Later, when the smell of his gangrenous foot becomes unbearable, Odysseus is the one who tricks him into being stranded on Lemnos (""Oh, <em>Lemnos</em>! I thought it was <em>Limnos</em>! My mistake."")</li>

"Is the fight between Mercutio and Tybalt a joke, or is it serious?","<p>I'm watching two adaptations of Romeo and Juliet that take two different approaches to the play: Baz Luhrmann's 1996 film Romeo + Juliet and Zeffirelli's 1968 film Romeo and Juliet. There are some obvious differences between the two: one is set in 14th century Italy, and the other is set in the modern day. But there are some subtler differences between the two adaptations. In particular, I'm thinking of the very different approaches the two films take towards the fight scene between Mercutio and Tybalt, and Tybalt's death. I found clips of both scenes on Youtube: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjunMlGnlKU"" rel=""noreferrer"">here's the 1996 version of the scene</a>, and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1DNpQC43CQ"" rel=""noreferrer"">here's the 1968 version</a>.</p>

<p>In the 1968 version, the fight is treated as some sort of extended joke. Mercutio and Tybalt do all sorts of comedic routines with their swords, all the characters are laughing (including Mercutio, Tybalt, and the extras), and it appears to be an accident that Tybalt kills Mercutio, judging by Tybalt's shocked expression. Meanwhile, in the 1996 version, the characters appear to be very angry. They're clearly trying to kill each other, and the ominous music adds to this feeling.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Torn by revolution, gasping at the quick pace of technological change, divided by debates over racial equality, early 19th Century Europe produces a crop of batshit-crazy writers, and Mary Shelley. She writes a book that treats on themes of parenthood, which is completely misunderstood for two centuries.</p>

<p>I assume that the 'revolution' is the Industrial Revolution - because there isn't a political revolution at that time I can pin down. </p>

"How unreliable is the narrator in The Repairer of Reputations?","<p>Spoilers abound in this question about this sci-fi horror short, so you might want to read it at <a href=""http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8492"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Project Gutenberg</a> first. </p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> The narrator of this story is eventually revealed to be insane. It is strongly implied that he is delusional, wearing a cheap metal circlet which he believes to be a crown. This calls into question the validity of much of his tale of Imperial conquest and ""suicide booths"". </p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, there are two key points during the tale when things the narrator believes appear to be true.</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> First, he tells Hawberk that Wilde knows where to find a rare and valuable piece of armour. Second, it is implied that Wilde is quite correct to believe that Hawberk is a secret descendent of the ""Marquis of Avonshire"". </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The first of these, in particular, would seem to me to suggest that the tale should be taken at face value, depriving it of much of its mystery, impact and value.</p>

<p>Is this a deliberate clue left by the author as to the narrator's reliability, and if so, why is it there? Or is there another way of interpreting this information which leaves the mystery intact? What other clues can we glean from the text about the truth of the narrator's tale?</p>

"What is the meaning of Blake's poem ""The Sick Rose""?","<p>William Blake's very short poem ""The Sick Rose"", from his <a href=""http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1934/1934-h/1934-h.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>Songs of Innocence and of Experience</em></a>, runs as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>O rose, thou art sick!<br>
     The invisible worm,<br>

  <p>Has found out thy bed<br>

</blockquote>

<p>There's a surface meaning here about a rose being destroyed by parasites in the flowerbed (although I don't know what kind of worms ""fl[y] in the night, In the howling storm"" - does this line too have deeper significance, beyond specifying some particular members of the animal kingdom?) But the second verse at least has strong sexual undertones: the predator that destroys life with ""his dark secret love"" in ""thy bed [of] joy"" sounds a lot like a rapist or an incubus. I'm not sure what the rose symbolises in this reading of the poem though.</p>

<p>In short: <strong>what does this poem really mean?</strong> I feel like I'm seeing half of the direct surface reading and half of the deeper hidden meaning, but not fully grasping either of them.</p>

"Consular Operations in Robert Ludlum’s books","<p>When reading “Bourne Identity”, closer to the end of the book an agency called  Consular Operations is introduced. Since I had never heard of such thing, I’ve searched, and discovered that it is likely fictional: “consular operations” as a phrase is relatively common terminology amidst diplomatic/foreign relations types, but no such agency appear to exist within or without U.S. Department of State. During my search I have also found that the agency appears more prominently throughout Ludlum’s works, such as in “Janson Directive” (soon to be a major motion picture).</p>

<p>Even if it is fictional, what could be Ludlum’s inspiration for such an agency? Are there historical examples of U.S. or other countries’ foreign ministries running their own undercover intelligence or special operations, and not merely providing diplomatic cover for their respective intelligence and CI agencies, such as CIA, GRU, MI-6 etc.?</p>

<p>As a side question, while looking it up I’ve discovered that Shadowrun role-playing universe also has Consular Operations agency. Given that Shadowrun was introduced in 1989, at the height of Ludlum’s fame, is it fair to say that it is a direct reference, or merely a coincidence?</p>

  <p>The little old house was out with a little new shed<br>
  In front at the edge of the road where the traffic sped,<br>
  A roadside stand that too pathetically pled,<br>
  It would not be fair to say for a dole of bread,<br>
  But for some of the money, the cash, whose flow supports<br>
  The flower of cities from sinking and withering faint.<br>
  The polished traffic passed with a mind ahead,<br>
  Or if ever aside a moment, then out of sorts<br>
  At having the landscape marred with the artless paint<br>
  Of signs that with N turned wrong and S turned wrong<br>
  Offered for sale wild berries in wooden quarts,<br>
  Or crook-necked golden squash with silver warts,<br>
  Or beauty rest in a beautiful mountain scene,<br>
  You have the money, but if you want to be mean,<br>
  Why keep your money <strong>(this crossly)</strong> and go along.  </p>
  
  <p>The hurt to the scenery wouldn’t be my complaint<br>
  So much as the trusting sorrow of what is unsaid:<br>
  Here far from the city we make our roadside stand<br>
  And ask for some city money to feel in hand<br>
  To try if it will not make our being expand,<br>
  And give us the life of the moving-pictures’ promise<br>
  That the party in power is said to be keeping from us.  </p>

  While greedy good-doers, beneficent beasts of prey,<br>
  Swarm over their lives enforcing benefits<br>
  That are calculated to soothe them out of their wits,<br>
  And by teaching them how to sleep they sleep all day,<br>
  Destroy their sleeping at night the ancient way.  </p>

  The thought of so much childish longing in vain,<br>
  The sadness that lurks near the open window there,<br>
  That waits all day in almost open prayer<br>
  For the squeal of brakes, the sound of a stopping car,<br>
  Of all the thousand selfish cars that pass,<br>
  Just one to inquire what a farmer’s prices are.<br>
  And one did stop, but only to plow up grass<br>
  In using the yard to back and turn around;<br>
  And another to ask the way to where it was bound;  </p>

  <p>No, in country money, the country scale of gain,<br>
  The requisite lift of spirit has never been found,<br>

  To put these people at one stroke out of their pain.<br>

<p>The first couplet of this verse is made up of puns on the names of late 19th-century tourist agencies and operators, as described in <a href=""https://literature.stackexchange.com/a/5784/3003"">my answer to Peter Shor’s question</a>. But while researching this answer I noticed that editions of <em>The Seven Seas</em> have different text for this couplet. The original British edition (<a href=""https://archive.org/stream/sevensea00kipl"" rel=""noreferrer"">Methuen and Co., London, 1896</a>) gives the version quoted above (<a href=""https://archive.org/stream/sevensea00kipl#page/134/mode/2up"" rel=""noreferrer"">page 135</a>). But the U.S. edition (<a href=""https://archive.org/stream/sevenseask00kipl"" rel=""noreferrer"">D.

  <p><em>Carambas</em> and <em>serapés</em> we waved to every wind,<br>
  We smoked good Corpo Bacco when our sweethearts proved unkind;<br>
  With maids of matchless beauty and parentage unguessed<br>
  We also took our manners to the Islands of the Blest.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Several features of the replacement couplet are unsatisfactory or puzzling:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Waving <em>serapés</em> (Spanish–American shawls) makes sense, but waving <em>carambas</em> does not. <em>Caramba!</em> is a Spanish <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minced_oath"" rel=""noreferrer"">minced oath</a>, so waving it requires a very loose sense of the word “wave” (or else it is surprisingly rude: <em>caramba</em> is a euphemism for <em>carajo</em> meaning <em>penis</em>).</p></li>
<li><p>Kipling’s poem constructs an extended conceit between the Victorian <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-volume_novel"" rel=""noreferrer"">three-volume novel</a> (known as a <em>three-decker</em>) and a ship with three decks. Thus the ship is populated with tropes from these novels: “stolen wills for ballast and a crew of missing heirs” and so on. But considered as literary tropes, <em>carambas</em> and <em>serapés</em> seem to belong to <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_fiction"" rel=""noreferrer"">Western fiction</a> rather than Victorian melodramas.</p></li>
<li><p>“Corpo Bacco” looks like Italian for “body [of] Bacchus”, presumably an oath (compare <a href=""https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/perbacco#Italian"" rel=""noreferrer""><em>perbacco</em></a>), but in the context of the replacement couplet it seems to be a kind or brand of tobacco. Is this some kind of joke?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>If you search on Google Books for the phrase “Corpo Bacco”, there are (discounting duplicates) only two hits: Kipling’s poem in its U.S. edition, and the poem ‘<a href=""https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=fzAaAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA183"" rel=""noreferrer"">Camp Song</a>’ from <em>The New Monthly Magazine</em> for May 1853, signed ‘G.W.T.’ (perhaps <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Walter_Thornbury"" rel=""noreferrer"">George Walter Thornbury</a>?):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Corpo Bacco!</em> how we battled,<br>
    Camped and marched the wide world over.<br>
  <em>Caramba!</em> I’m like the Calmuc,<br>
    In my own land but a rover.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Can it be a coincidence that here we have <em>caramba</em> too?</p>

<p>A footnote explains that the italicized phrases in the poem are “oaths of all languages, picked up by the mercenary in different countries.” So in <em>this</em> poem “Corpo Bacco” and “Caramba!” make perfect sense: they are oaths picked up in Italy and Spain respectively. It looks to me very much as though the writer of the replacement couplet was pulling a prank by taking oaths from ‘Camp Song’ and sneaking them past the publisher by deploying them in misleading contexts.</p>

<p>My questions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Who decided to change this couplet, Kipling or his U.S. publisher, and why? (Did they doubt that their U.S. readers would understand the puns?)</p></li>
<li><p>Did Kipling even write the replacement couplet, or is it editorial meddling? Was it common for editors to rewrite parts of poems like this?</p></li>
<li><p>Is there a connection to ‘Camp Song’ by ‘G.W.T.’?</p></li>

Poetry being an art form, obviously no such definition will ever satisfy everyone, nor should it, but I still found the distinction made in the article interesting and worthy of consideration.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Yes, there is plenty of poorly written verse out there, but there is
  also plenty of poorly written poetry—and sometimes the verse is the
  better crafted.</p>
  
  <p>Robert Service’s “<a href=""http://www.poetryfoundation.org/archive/poem.html?id=174348"" rel=""noreferrer"">The Cremation of Sam McGee</a>,” with no help from the
  critical establishment, is still going strong after a century, while
  most early Yeats is read today only because it was written by Yeats.
  To use verse as a pejorative term, then, is to lose the use of it as a
  true distinction.</p>
  
  <p><strong>George Orwell gives us another way to think about this when he
  describes Kipling as “a good bad poet.”</strong></p>
  
  <p><strong>”A good bad poem is a graceful monument to the obvious. It records in
  memorable form—for verse is a mnemonic device, among other things—some
  emotion which very nearly every human being can share.”</strong></p>
  
  <p>Into this same pot Orwell puts “<a href=""http://www.poetryfoundation.org/archive/poem.html?id=174586"" rel=""noreferrer"">The Charge of the Light Brigade</a>,” the
  work of Bret Harte—and presumably that of Robert Service. “There is a
  great deal of good bad poetry in English,” says Orwell; by

"Who is ""Reported Missing"" addressed to?","<p>Anna Keown's poem ""Reported Missing"" is addressed to a World War One soldier by a first-person narrator who is desperately hopeful that he isn't dead. Here's the poem in full:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My thought shall never be that you are dead:<br>
  Who laughed so lately in this quiet place.<br>
  The dear and deep-eyed humour of that face<br>
  Held something ever living, in Death’s stead.<br>
  Scornful I hear the flat things they have said<br>
  And all their piteous platitudes of pain.<br>
  I laugh! I laugh! – For you will come again –<br>
  This heart would never beat if you were dead.<br>
  The world’s adrowse in twilight hushfulness,<br>
  There’s purple lilac in your little room,<br>
  And somewhere out beyond the evening gloom<br>
  Small boys are culling summer watercress.<br>
  Of these familiar things I have no dread<br>
  Being so very sure you are not dead.</p>

<p><strong>What relation is the soldier to the narrator?</strong> A son? A husband? A lover? Something else?</p>

"Why did Martin Eden live at night with the gods in a colossal nightmare?","<p>Re-reading Jack London's <a href=""http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1056/1056-h/1056-h.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>Martin Eden</em></a> for my project, I've come across this passage: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Martin had ascended from pitch to pitch of intellectual living, and here he was at a higher pitch than ever.  All the hidden things were laying their secrets bare.  He was drunken with comprehension.  At night, asleep, he <strong>lived with the gods in colossal nightmare</strong>; and awake, in the day, he went around like a somnambulist, with absent stare, gazing upon the world he had just discovered.<br>
  <sub><em>Martin Eden</em>, chapter XIII. Emphasis mine.</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This appears right after Martin discovers Herbert Spencer, whose works will play a major role in Martin's later life. </p>

<p>I can understand the sentences before the one with highlighted bit; I can also understand why he <em>""went around like a somnambulist""</em>.</p>

<p>What I can't understand is the ""nightmare"" and ""gods"". If ""nightmare"" is used in a literal sense here, why would he have nightmares at all, especially with gods? </p>

<p>If the nightmares are meant in a more symbolic sense, then what do they represent? It is stated in the book that Martin resented sleep, seeing it as a waste of time, and thus sleeping for only 5 hours a day (even trying sleeping for only 4 hours, but that was too hard). </p>

<p>I just don't see why Martin would experience anything negative in his sleep, since everything thus far has only been good for him - Ruth, studying, writing, and now Spencer. </p>

"What does Father Gur mean by ""And then you'll be given back!""?","<p>During the dinner at the king's palace, Rumata has a conversation with Father Gur, the poet. Rumata offers him a copy of the poets work, in exchange for a promise to write something new:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Very well put, Father Gur. By the way, is it still possible to find your book?”  </p>
  
  <p>“I don’t know… And I don’t want to know.”  </p>
  
  <p>“Just in case, you should know: one copy is in the metropole, in the
  library of the emperor. Another is kept in the Museum of Curiosities
  in Soan. The third is with me.”  </p>
  
  <p>Gur spooned some jelly onto his plate with a trembling hand. “I… don’t
  know…” He looked at Rumata mournfully with his huge sunken eyes. “I’d
  like to read it… reread it…”  </p>
  
  <p>“I’ll be happy to lend it to you.”  </p>
  
  <p>“And then?”  </p>
  
  <p>“And then you’ll give it back.”  </p>
  
  <p>“<strong>And then you’ll be given back!</strong>” Gur said sharply.<br>
  <sub><em>Hard to be a God</em>, chapter 5. Emphasis mine.</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am confused by Father Gur's reply. In original Russian, the last two lines of the conversation are as follows (with bold part matching that in the translation):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>— Потом вы вернете.  </p>
  
  <p>— <strong>И потом вам вернут!</strong> — резко сказал Гур.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A literal translation in this case is ""And then they'll give it back to you!"". While all three versions mean the same thing, I found the tone to be different, and it caused me to question the meaning of Father Gur's line.</p>

<p>When I read it in Russian, I assumed he was referring to future generations of poets that would be inspired by Father Gur's work. This thought of mine was prompted by an earlier line by Rumata:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Look at your plate and keep eating. I’ll tell you who you are. You’re a brilliant storyteller, <strong>the founder of a new literary movement — the most fruitful one there is</strong>.” Gur’s cheeks slowly started to glow. “In a hundred years, and maybe even earlier, <strong>dozens of storytellers will follow in your footsteps</strong>.”<br>
  <sub><em>Ibid</em>. Emphasis mine.</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>But then, Father Gur may be just too humble and skeptic to accept that possibility.</p>

<p>When reading the English translation, however, the tone suggested that Father Gur may somehow be referring to Don Reba, and persecution of artists in Arkanar, as if he was saying ""And then you'll be given back [after they kill me for possessing it]!"". This, I think, is supported by the line that follows immediately after:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rumata shook his head.  </p>
  
  <p>“Don Reba really scared you, Father Gur.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So which one is it? Is Father Gur telling that Rumata will be rewarded for lending Gur his book? Or is he telling that Rumata and Gur will be prosecuted for the possession of this banned work?</p>

"In ""The Sandman"", what are nightmares for?","<p>What purpose do nightmares serve in the world of <em>The Sandman</em>? In the second volume of The Sandman Library (<em><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sandman:_The_Doll%27s_House"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The Doll's House</a></em>), Dream spends most of his time tracking down and dealing with a number of errant nightmares (Brute, Glob, and the Corinthian). He refers to these as ""his creations"" many times, unforming some (to be reformed later) and banishing others (for a few thousand years, implying that they will eventually return).</p>

<p>What purpose do these creatures serve? Dream seems to take his ""job""<sup>1</sup> very seriously; this seems to include caring for the well-being of sentient creatures -- the other main story of <em>The Doll's House</em>, for example, was that of the dream vortex, which posed a great danger to anything that dreamed, and Morpheus did his best to avert the impending disaster.
In this volume, he also disbands and attempts to rehabilitate the Collectors.</p>

<p>One could argue that it's possible that while nightmares are not good for individual humans, they serve a greater purpose for humanity. The basis for that argument would be that the focus of Morpheus' care for sentient creatures appears to undergo some shift from <a href=""https://literature.stackexchange.com/a/2384/481"">humanity-only to include individual humans</a>, and the nightmares were created long before Dream cared much for lone individuals. The only caveat that accompanies this interpretation is the apparent absence of a benefit for humanity in general. (At least, I don't see one.)</p>

<p>It cannot either be that nightmares are things that humans (or sentient beings) find in their minds, and that Dream does not remove -- in this universe, nightmares are the creations of the King of Dreams. They are things that he expressly created, for some purpose that escapes my understanding at the moment.</p>

<p><strong>Do they serve some purpose in-universe? Are they just a plot device, or a metaphor? (Something else?)</strong></p>

<p>When I searched Google, I was not able to find much about nightmares. The <a href=""http://sandman.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Dreams/Nightmares"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">shared Wikia page for dreams and nightmares</a> says (without a source) that ""Nightmares are beings created by Dream to populate his realm and to help him with various tasks."" This does not, however, explain <em>what</em> the purpose of nightmares is. <a href=""http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/NightmareFuel/TheSandman"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">TV Tropes</a> seems to treat them all as mere ""<a href=""http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Nightmare Fuel</a>,"" but I think there should be a greater purpose in them, especially since Neil Gaiman is such a careful writer, and Dream is such a careful guardian.</p>

"Is Ari an unreliable narrator, or is he oblivious?","<p>At the conclusion to <em>Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe</em>, by Benjamin Alire Sáenz, the title character Ari reaches the realization that he is romantically attracted to Dante -- where previously, he firmly rebuffed Dante's explicit interest in him.</p>

<p>The way he arrives at this isn't portrayed as feeling any romantic or sexual desire of his own. Rather, his overall ""platonic"" passion for protecting Dante is interpreted by other characters as more than what mere friendship would explain. Hearing this, Ari understands it to be true, and comes to the conclusion that he's been repressing his own feelings and desire.</p>

<p><strong>Are we to understand that Ari <em>has</em> felt attracted to Dante, but has concealed that fact from us?</strong> Just as, for example, he explicitly tells us that he <em>won't</em> discuss whether he masturbates, or what he thinks about?<br>
Or, <strong>is this the first inkling Ari himself has of his attraction?</strong> Which would mean, for example, that he's lying when he tells Dante their kiss actually did work for him?</p>

<p>The difference between ""Ari admits feelings he previously kept concealed"" vs. ""Ari realizes feelings that are brand new to him"" seems immensely significant, but the way the book is narrated, the lines between the two are very, very blurry.</p>

<p><strong>Are we to interpret Ari as an unreliable narrator, or has all his narration reflected his knowledge and feelings at the time of each scene?</strong></p>

"Was Jerome K Jerome politically active?","<p>Jerome K. Jerome's short story ""The New Utopia"" has a strongly anti-socialist and anti-democratic message. </p>

  <p>I  had  spent  an  extremely  interesting  evening.    I  had  dined  with
  some  very  ""advanced""  friends  of  mine  at  the  “National  Socialist
  Club”.    We  had  had  an  excellent  dinner:  the  pheasant,  stuffed  with
  truffles,  was  a  poem;  and  when  I  say  that  the  ’49  Chateau  Lafitte
  was  worth  the  price  we  had  to  pay  for  it,  I  do  not  see  what  more  I can add in its favour.</p>
  
  <p>After dinner, and over the cigars (I must say they do know how
  to  stock  good  cigars  at  the  National  Socialist  Club),  we  had  a  very instructive  discussion  about  the  coming  equality  of  man  and  the
  nationalisation of capital.</p>

Men  have  not  only  got  to  be  equal  in  these  happy  days, but  to  look  it,  as  far  as  can  be.    By  causing  all  men  to  be  clean shaven,  and  all  men  and  women  to  have  black  hair  cut  the  same length, we obviate, to a certain extent, the errors of Nature.” <br />

<p>The book <em>SAT II Success: Literature</em> which I use to prepare for the SAT exam (a multiple-choice test for high school students in the US) asks the following question about the poem:</p>

  <p>(A) Metaphors<br>
  (B) Similes<br>
  (C) Grammatical irregularities<br>
  (D) Slant rhyme<br>

<p>In my opinion, every choice is present: metaphors (""Valves""), similes (""[l]ike Stone""), grammatical irregularities (punctuation), slant rhyme (""pausing""/""kneeling""), and figurative language (this one includes metaphors and similes).</p>

<p>However, the book says otherwise. Here is an explanation for this question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>The correct answer is (B).</strong> Remember to pay special attention to the
  word <em>except</em> in this question. “Chariots” and “Emperor” are clearly
  metaphors for wealth and power, which makes choice (A) true. Dickinson
  is known for her sharp, concrete images, like “Door,” “Chariots,”
  “Gate,” “Mat,” and “Stone,” making choice (B) untrue because they are
  not similes. Choices (C), (D), and (E) are clearly evident, and
  therefore do not meet the criteria of exception. Choice (B) is the
  right answer.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The book says that ""[l]ike Stone"" only includes an image of stone, but isn't it a simile?<br>
According to <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simile"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikipedia</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A simile (/ˈsɪməli/) is a figure of speech that directly compares two

"Interpretation of ""The Catcher in the Rye"" by J. D. Salinger","<p>In ""The Catcher in the Rye"" by J. D. Salinger, there are two topics that, in my opinion, are metaphors.</p>

<p>The first topic is the one of the ducks in the pond and where they go in winter. Looking on the web, it seems that there is some consensus on considering the ducks as an <em>alter ego</em> for Holden and its problems with his adolescence.</p>

<p>The second one, is the figure of the catcher in the rye. In <a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Catcher_in_the_Rye"" rel=""noreferrer"">this Wikipedia page</a>, it says that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This ""catcher in the rye"" is an analogy for Holden, who admires in children attributes that he struggles to find in adults, like innocence, kindness, spontaneity, and generosity. Falling off the cliff could be a progression into the adult world that surrounds him and that he strongly criticizes. Later, Phoebe and Holden exchange roles as the ""catcher"" and the ""fallen""; he gives her his hunting hat, the catcher's symbol, and becomes the fallen as Phoebe becomes the catcher.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have my own interpretations of these two topics.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>In my opinion (just as a reader, since my education background is in STEM), the ducks are all the boys and girls, like Holden, that have a particular sensitivity and predisposition for investigating and questioning the world around them. For them, it is more difficult to accept the adult's world when they are growing up (in the metaphor, to remain in the pond when the winter is coming). From this comes the question that Holden cannot solve: how can these particularly sensitive individuals survive to adolescence? When he asks to the taxi driver, the only answer he receives is about fishes. Obviously, fishes are different from ducks and they can survive the whole winter in the frozen pond. In this metaphor, fishes are like those children that seem to be better dealing with the problem of growing up because they do not question themselves about the adult's world: they accept it as it is without raising any problem, since for them it is totally natural. Moreover, during the night that Holden spend in the park, he looks for other ducks in the grass near the pond (therefore, just outside the society where other human beings live). He does not find any duck, he only risks to hurt himself falling in the pond. In my opinion, this means that individuals with this particular sensitivity are completely isolated from the society, for them it is hard to find people similar to them. Therefore, society seems to not understand the problem since it is not a common problem. </p></li>
<li><p>Again, my interpretation of the catcher is different from the proposed one. In my opinion, the cliff at the end of the field represents the possibility of mental illness during adolescence. Children are playing in the field during the childhood, but growing up they can have to face problems that can put at risk their own life. In this case, the catcher is not somebody that prevents the children from growing, but it is a person (maybe an adult?) that is fundamental in the development of the adolescent for surviving a period of struggle. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>The question are: <strong>are these interpretations consistent with the whole novel? Is there an ""official"" interpretation? Is it different from mine and, if yes, how and why?</strong></p>

"Does the description of Eustace's parents fit some known stereotype?","<p>In the opening paragraph of <em>The Voyage of the Dawn Treader</em>, C. S. Lewis introduces us to the (at this point in the story) singularly unlikeable character of Eustace Clarence Scrubb. About his parents, we read the following short summary:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>He didn't call his Father and Mother ""Father"" and ""Mother"", but Harold and Alberta. They were very up-to-date and advanced people. They were vegetarians, non-smokers and teetotallers and wore a special kind of underclothes. In their house there was very little furniture and very few clothes on the beds and the windows were always open.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I remember being confused when I first read this as a child: ""vegetarians, non-smokers and teetotallers"" all seem like good things to me, and I was raised on such principles myself, but evidently we're supposed to have a negative impression of the Scrubb family. Looking back at it now, I'm guessing that Lewis was playing into certain stereotypes which contemporary readers would have recognised as signals of a certain ""type"" of family. Since their diet, dress sense, and furniture aren't really relevant to the story, this must be scene-setting in terms of environment and personality.</p>

<p><strong>What stereotypes is Lewis trying to play into with this brief description?</strong> Or to put it another way, upon reading the above-quoted passage, how would contemporary readers likely have described or perceived the Scrubb family? I'm imagining an ""oh, right, they're <code>X</code>-people"" reaction, but what's X?</p>

It begins with the following words:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Eng. Lit was established one sunny afternoon in 1386, when a gang of people went for a walk to a place called Canterbury. They had a great time, telling each other dirty stories, which a man called Chaucer wrote down, thereby establishing the fact that English Literature is based on a collection of dirty jokes. After Chaucer Engl Lit dozed off a little until a man called Shakespeare began writing plays about murder, mayhem and paranoic Danish princes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It contains comments about Milton writing <em>Paradise Lost</em>, surviving the plague, blindness and the death of his two daughters, and then writing <em>Paradise Regained</em>. The Romantic poets die young, ""preferably in Italy"". Coleridge is described as waving dead albatrosses in people's faces. The text is funny if you get all the allusions (e.g. who is the ""shy librarian from Hull""?) but probably merely strange if you don't.</p>

<p>I once had a copy of the text but I can't find it any longer. (The above quotes are all from memory.) What I have never found out, however, is where this text was first published.

"70s or 80s Novel, Low IQ man finds/rescues young woman adrift at sea","<p>Probably read in 70s or early 80s. Probably set in the Caribbeans or Florida Coast, or Gulf Coast. The book may have been a mystery or thriller/adventure type story. It was in English</p>

<p>A low IQ man (He is capable, just slow) probably in his 30s finds a girl adrift on a lift raft/or ship wreckage. She is badly burned on her back/backside/back of the legs. He takes her to his cabin/hut he has built on a small island or cove where he lives away from civilization. (He sails to the nearest town occasionally to buy staple foods. (He might have been a Vietnam Vet on disability allowance? Head wound with a plate in his head?)</p>

<p>I don't recall if she was burned when the small ship (cabin cruiser/yacht/sailboat) she was on was was blown up/caught fire, or went overboard and was very badly sunburned because she had been adrift with no protection for many days.</p>

<p>I believe the Protagonist of the story is looking for the girl (Police? or Private Detective?)</p>

<p>There are two scenes I distinctly remember from the story:</p>

<p>One - A day or two after he finding her, she drowsily wakes up but is still half out of it, in his hut lying on her stomach. She is in great pain from her burned back. He is rubbing some cream/lotion/oil on her and it is soothing most of the burning pain. He is chatting away talking to himself as he applies the ointment. She is mostly drifting in and out, not paying any attention to what he is saying until she hears him say something like ""cute burned baby butt"" and realizes she is naked and he is rubbing the ointment on her bare butt. Just as she starts to panic, he pats he butt, gets up and says something that makes her realize she is safe he is not assaulting her. (i.e. Thats enough now, I have to go fix some food? catch some fish? work on the boat?)</p>

<p>Two - The low IQ man is very physically fit and strong, but has a strangely dished in forehead. a few days later (Maybe the girl is telling him her story, or she is asking him about his, he starts getting very distressed or anxious. He stands up goes to the center pole or roof support of the hut, grabs it and starts slamming his head against the pole many times. (The rounded edge of the pole perfectly matches the dished in shape of his forehead) She freaks and finally gets him to stop. He says something like when the bad thoughts/voices get too bad he has to knock them out of his head. They bond together (She keeping him stable. and He hiding her while she heals.)</p>

<p>I think it Might have been a three way triangle/race story between:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Protagonist (Police?/Private Eye?) who is looking for her,</li>
<li>Whoever caused her to be in the ocean (destroyed her boat or threw her overboard) who realizes her body never turned up and is looking for her again.</li>
<li>and the low IQ man/girl who are trying to avoid everyone.</li>
</ul>

<p>I think the Protagonist knows the low IQ man and would looks out for him. (May have been together in the service) I think before he found the girl he used to come into town every couple months to go to the local bar and get drunk and get into fights or sleep with an ugly old prostitute. I think the protagonist used to occasionally bail him out or give him a place to sleep it off if he got into trouble.</p>

"What is the difference between emotions and feelings in Wordsworth's Preface to Lyrical Ballads?","<p>In the <a href=""https://www.bartleby.com/39/36.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Preface</a> to the second edition of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyrical_Ballads"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>Lyrical Ballads</em></a> (1800), Wordsworth famously wrote that</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>all good poetry is the spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings: (...).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He later adds (my emphasis):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I have said that poetry is the spontaneous overflow of powerful <strong>feelings</strong>: 
  it takes its origin from <strong>emotion</strong> recollected in tranquillity: the <strong>emotion</strong>
  is contemplated till, by a species of reaction, the tranquillity gradually disappears,
  and an <strong>emotion</strong>, kindred to that which was before the subject of contemplation, is gradually produced,
  and does itself actually exist in the mind. In this mood successful composition generally begins,
  and in a mood similar to this it is carried on; 
  but the <strong>emotion</strong>, of whatever kind, and in whatever degree, from various causes, 
  is qualified by various pleasures, so that in describing any <strong>passions</strong> whatsoever,
  which are voluntarily described, the mind will, upon the whole, be in a state of enjoyment. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>If Wordsworth had written, ""the <strong>emotion</strong> is contemplated till (...) the tranquillity gradually disappears,
and <em>feelings</em>/<em>a feeling</em> (...) is gradually produced"", I would have understood ""emotion"" as the original experience
and ""feelings"" as the derived or perhaps renewed experience that leads to the creation of poetry.
But I can't see this kind of consistency in the above passage. To make matters worse, he also adds ""passions"" to the mix.</p>

<p>In fact, the Preface also provide arguments for considering ""feelings"" as the original experience, or at least closer to it.
For example, Wordsworth writes (my emphasis),</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Humble and rustic life was generally chosen, because, in that condition, the essential passions of the heart find a better soil in which they can attain their maturity, are less under restraint, and speak a plainer and more emphatic language; because in that condition of life our elementary <strong>feelings</strong> coexist in a state of greater simplicity, and, consequently, may be more accurately contemplated, (...).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wordworth uses the term ""emotion"" only four times in the Preface, namely in the second quote above. </p>

<p>Looking at definitions of ""feelings"" and ""emotions"" in present-day psychological sources does not help clarify the difference.
For example, in <a href=""https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/hide-and-seek/201412/whats-the-difference-between-feeling-and-emotion"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">What's the Difference Between a Feeling and an Emotion?</a>, Neel Burton makes the following distinction:</p>

<ul>
<li>an <strong>emotional experience</strong> is brief and episodic; e.g. I am currently proud of X;</li>
<li>an <strong>emotion</strong> can endure for many years and can ""predispose to a variety of emotional experiences, as well as thoughts, beliefs, desires, and actions""; e.g. I am proud of X;</li>
<li><strong>feelings</strong> is a broader term that covers both emotional experiences and physical sensations such as hunger and pain.</li>
</ul>

<p>He adds that ""an emotion, being in some sense latent, can only ever be felt, sensu stricto, through the emotional experiences that it gives rise to, even though it might also be discovered through its associated thoughts, beliefs, desires, and actions."" </p>

<p>Looking back at the Preface, one might say that <em>emotional exeperiences</em> may be ""recollected in tranquility"" and so gave rise to a mood that is conducive to writing poetry. Wordsworth uses the word ""feelings"" for the psychological phenomena that are active in that mood, but that does not accord with Burton's definition.</p>

<p>In <a href=""https://www.thebestbrainpossible.com/whats-the-difference-between-feelings-and-emotions/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">What’s The Difference Between Feelings And Emotions?</a>, Debbie Hampton uses other definitions (my emphasis):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Emotions</strong> are lower level responses occurring in the subcortical regions of the brain, the amygdala, and the ventromedial prefrontal cortices, creating biochemical reactions in your body altering your physical state. They originally helped our species survive by producing quick reactions to threat, reward, and everything in between in their environments.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Feelings</strong> originate in the neocortical regions of the brain, are mental associations and reactions to emotions, and are subjective being influenced by personal experience, beliefs, and memories. A feeling is a mental portrayal of what is going on in your body when you have an emotion and is the byproduct of your brain perceiving and assigning meaning to the emotion. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since psychology and neuroscience did not exist in the early 19th century, Wordsworth couldn't have come up with these definitions, but there is a parallel with the distinction between emotions as the original experience and feelings as the result of ""recollection"" that would have helped me make sense of Wordworth. Am I overlooking something in the Preface and does Wordworth really make a consistent distinction? If yes, what is it?</p>

  <p>What is the significance of naming each chapter after an ingredient of the dessert ashure?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashure"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Aşure</a> is a dessert eaten in both Turkey and Armenia (in the latter it is called anuşabur). It appears to have a lot of cultural significance, and it's mentioned explicitly both in <em>The Bastard of Istanbul</em> and in another of Şafak's novels. So I think this question is very interesting and worth exploring. <strong>Why are the chapters named after aşure ingredients, and does this tie into the themes of the story?</strong></p>

"What is the story of the woman who collected valueless things?","<p>In G. K. Chesterton's Father Brown short story, The Blast of the Book, he makes two references to a story (presumably allegoric) about a woman who collected valueless things. The references are not explained and from the context it seems that the reader is assumed to be familiar with this story.</p>

<p>The relevant quotes are:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I've often had to wait in your office, till you turned up; and of course I passed the time of day with poor Berridge. He was rather a card. I remember once he said he would like to collect valueless things, as collectors did the silly things they thought valuable. You know the old story about the woman who collected valueless things.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>He has nonsense notions of all sorts. About collecting useless things, for instance. Don't you know the story of the woman who bought the two most useless things: an old doctor's brass-plate and a wooden leg?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There seems to be some point being made with the reference to the old story, but without knowing that context it's hard to know what the point is. What is the original story about the woman?</p>

"Is Mike an anarchist in *The Moon is a Harsh Mistress*?","<p>In the later parts of Robert Heinlein's <em>The Moon is a Harsh Mistress</em>, we find out that Manny and Prof are motivated by their anarchist political beliefs.  They argue for these beliefs in the new parliment, and I think those beliefs took a big part of what motivated their active participation in the revolution.  Even in the earlier parts of the book, Manny explains some of his anarchist beliefs, but it's only in the later parts that tell how far he's willing to go to fight for them.</p>

<p>However, I am not sure about the motivation of Mike.  Is Mike also an anarchist by conviction?  If so, then that would have motivated him to participate in the revolution, just like it did for Manny and Prof.  But Mike didn't participate in the arguments in the parliment in the later parts of the book, or in creating the new free Lunar state in general.  This makes it more difficult to me to determine his true beliefs.</p>

<p>I can imagine hypothetical alternate motivations for Mike, rather than a deep conviction of anarchy.  He could have had no specific political preference, but went along with the other protagonist's plan to do something that was fun for him.  He could have felt personal sympathy with Mike and the Prof and supported them for that reason.  He could have just found the old government and the Warden so annoying or evil that he went through with the revolution to replace that, even if he didn't know what new government he wanted.  He could even have thought himself more powerful than the other characters (it would be a reasonable assumption), and was planning on a different endgame than an anarchist Luna, but still found the revolution a good strating strategy for whatever his goals were.</p>

<p>Thus, my question is, what is Mike's motivation for participating in the revolution?  In particular, what are his political or moral beliefs, and is he a convinced anarchist?  Note that I am not asking about Heinlein's own political beliefs.  That's a separate question that's partly covered by <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/q/54547/4918"">“How anticommunist was Robert Heinlein?” (on Sci Fi SE)</a></p>

<p>As usual, I'd like an answer supported by the book, or possibly by interviews with <em>Heinlein</em> or other books he wrote.</p>

His wife says:</p>

</blockquote>

<p>What does ""ketha"" mean here?</p>

<p>It is worth knowing that the word or phrase ""ke-tha"" occurred in Act II, Scene 1 of <a href=""https://internetshakespeare.uvic.ca/doc/Per_Q1/scene/2.1/"" rel=""noreferrer""><em>Pericles, Prince of Tyre</em></a>, namely in the First Quarto of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pericles,_Prince_of_Tyre#Date_and_text"" rel=""noreferrer"">that play</a>. (<em>Pericles</em> was not included in the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Folio"" rel=""noreferrer"">First Folio</a> of Shakespeare's plays but was one of the plays in the 1619 <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_Folio"" rel=""noreferrer"">False Folio</a>.) The relevant lines go as follows (<em>Per.</em> = Pericles; <em>1.</em> = First fisherman):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong><em>Per.</em></strong> What I haue been, I haue forgot to know;<br />
  But what I am, want teaches me to thinke on:<br />
  A man throng'd vp with cold, my Veines are chill,<br />
  And haue no more of life then may suffize,<br />

  handsome fellow : Come, thou shalt goe home, and wee'le<br />
  haue Flesh for all day, Fish for fasting-dayes and more; or<br />
  Puddinges and Flap-iackes, and thou shalt be welcome.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Editors emend ""ke-tha"" to ""quoth-a"" (i.e. quoth he), which is plausible, since the words ""Die, <strong>ke-tha</strong>"" may be spoken to the second fisherman. However, in the dialogue from <em>Jack of Newbury</em>, there is no third person, and the wife consistently uses ""you"" and ""your"" to refer to her husband, so ""ketha"" cannot plausibly be emended to ""quoth-a"" here. This leaves us with the question what it actually means. </p>

"Is it common to reveal suspense in epilogue?","<p>According to the dictionary <a href=""https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/epilogue"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">epilogue</a> means</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>a speech or piece of text that is added to the end of a play or book,
  often giving a short statement about what happens to the characters
  after the play or book finishes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When I read book sometime I skip epilogue section and finished my reading because it generally have details about what happens to characters and some other details.</p>

<p>But last time when I read <strong>1st To Die</strong> by James Patterson, which is a suspense thriller, important details about the suspense were revealed in the Epilogue. The ""end"" of the book is really good one, and I was originally going to just finish the book and skip the Epilogue, but for some reason I continued with epilogue section. It turns out that there was a twist in the story and that actual suspense was revealed. If I didn't read epilogue, I would've missed actual reason for killing.</p>

<p>Is it common to reveal suspense or other important plot details in Epilogue section? Or is this just a new trend to add a conclusion in that section?</p>

<p>How important Epilogue is relating to the story?</p>

<p>I've read a decent number of suspense-thriller books and this is the only example I've seen so far where there was a conclusion added in Epilogue section.</p>

"Why is Sergeant Shadwell obsessed with nipples?","<p>One of the many recurring gags in <em>Good Omens</em> is Sergeant Shadwell's obsession with nipples. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>One of the first questions he asks Newt when recruiting him to the Witchfinder Army is how many nipples he's got.</li>
<li>When Aziraphale recruits <em>him</em> in turn to help deal with the Adam situation, he asks suspiciously how many nipples this Antichrist has, and Aziraphale lies to convince him to help.</li>
<li>Finally, when he ""pops the question"" to Madame Tracy, it's not a marriage proposal but the question of how many nipples she's got.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What is the significance of this obsession with nipples?</strong> Is it just something to make certain readers snigger?

"Was C.P.

Snow's article/lecture/book <em>The Two Cultures</em>, about the divide between science and the humanities in academia. The Wikipedia page seems to have a contradiction, and I haven't got the original text to check, so I'm not sure which is right.</p>

<p>Firstly, at the beginning of the Wikipedia page:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Its thesis was that ""the intellectual life of the whole of western society"" was split into the titular two cultures – namely the sciences and the humanities – and that this was a major hindrance to solving the world's problems.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then later on, it says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Snow's Rede Lecture condemned the British educational system as having, since the Victorian era, over-rewarded the humanities (especially Latin and Greek) at the expense of scientific and engineering education [...] By contrast, Snow said, German and American schools sought to prepare their citizens equally in the sciences and humanities, and better scientific teaching enabled these countries' rulers to compete more effectively in a scientific age.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The quote marks around ""the intellectual life of the whole of western society"" suggests it's a direct quote, but surely Germany and America are also part of western society, and yet Snow apparently held them up as better examples than Britain in this respect. What was he really saying?</p>

(It wasn't worth it.) The author and narrator, Beerbohm, questions his friend Soames upon his return from the future:</p>

  <br>""Yes. I think so. Greyish-yellowish stuff.""<br>

""And all of them—men and women alike—looking very well-cared-for? very Utopian? and smelling rather strongly of carbolic? and all of them quite hairless?"" I was right every time. Soames was only not sure whether the men and women were hairless or shorn. ""I hadn't time to look at them very closely,"" he explained.</p>

<p>On one hand, this seems like a stupid question. Anastasia spends the next paragraph talking about how handsome he is. On the other hand, Fifty Shades of Grey seems to be popular, and presumably the language has some role in its popularity.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>She told the magazine: ""I wrote the Hermione-Ron relationship as a
  form of wish fulfilment. That's how it was conceived, really.</p>
  
  <p>""For reasons that have very little to do with literature and far more

  ended up with Ron.</p>
  
  <p>""I know, I'm sorry, I can hear the rage and fury it might cause some

  reasons of credibility.</p>
  
  <p>""Am I breaking people's hearts by saying this? I hope not.""</p>

  whether Ron would have really been able to make her happy,"" Watson

<p>Of course, in the books, Hermione does marry Ron and not Harry. So JKR's proclamation that Hermione would not marry Ron seems odd to say the least.</p>

  he heard a noise in the distance. At first he thought it was a great
  wind coming over the leaves of the forest. Then he knew that it was
  not leaves, but the sound of the Sea far-off; a sound he had never
  heard in waking life, though it had often troubled his dreams.
  Suddenly he found he was out in the open. There were no trees after
  all. He was on a dark heath, and there was a strange salt smell in the
  air. Looking up he saw before him a tall white tower, standing alone
  on a high ridge. A great desire came over him to climb the tower and
  see the Sea. He started to struggle up the ridge towards the tower:
  but suddenly a light came in the sky, and there was a noise of
  thunder.</p>

<p>I've done some background <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Orwell#Religious_views"">research</a> on this, and I've found that Orwell was strongly against anti-Semitism. From Wikipedia:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Writing in early 1945 a long essay titled ""Antisemitism in Britain,"" for the Contemporary Jewish Record, Orwell stated that anti-Semitism was on the increase in Britain, and that it was ""irrational and will not yield to arguments.""

<p>It's possible that people may be putting a meaning onto the work that was not in the author's intention.

The <em>longest</em> sentence in the Papers is actually <strong>200 words</strong>:</p>

  <p>The recommendatory act of Congress is in the words following: “WHEREAS, There is provision in the articles of Confederation and perpetual Union, for making alterations therein, by the assent of a Congress of the United States, and of the legislatures of the several States; and whereas experience hath evinced, that there are defects in the present Confederation; as a mean to remedy which, several of the States, and PARTICULARLY THE STATE OF NEW YORK, by express instructions to their delegates in Congress, have suggested a convention for the purposes expressed in the following resolution; and such convention appearing to be the most probable mean of establishing in these States A FIRM NATIONAL GOVERNMENT: “Resolved, That in the opinion of Congress it is expedient, that on the second Monday of May next a convention of delegates, who shall have been appointed by the several States, be held at Philadelphia, for the sole and express purpose OF REVISING THE ARTICLES OF CONFEDERATION, and reporting to Congress and the several legislatures such ALTERATIONS AND PROVISIONS THEREIN, as shall, when agreed to in Congress, and confirmed by the States, render the federal Constitution ADEQUATE TO THE EXIGENCIES OF GOVERNMENT AND THE PRESERVATION OF THE UNION.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You don't have to read that. You probably shouldn't, honestly. </p>

<p>But this is by far <em>not</em> the only example of this sort of stream-of-consciousness meandering excess in the Papers.

<p>This sort of leads me to wonder: were the Federalist Papers ever edited in a thorough and rigorous way? If so, by whom? And if so, what on earth were they checking for, and what changes did they make (if we know)?</p>

<p>I realize Mr. Riordan's books target a younger audience, and this may seem like a minor detail in the grand scheme of making the myths accessible to youngsters.

"Who is the speaker in ""O Captain! My Captain!""","<p>In ""O Captain! My Captain!"" by Walt Whitman, the speaker acts as if he has a close connection to Abraham Lincoln, saying:</p>

"What metaphor(s) are represented by the mysterious figure in Charles Causley's ""Innocent's Song""?","<p>The other day, I came across this rather sinister poem by Charles Causley, set to music.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Innocent's Song    </p>
  
  <p>Who's that knocking on the window,<br>
  Who's that standing at the door,<br>
  What are all those presents<br>
  Laying on the kitchen floor?    </p>
  
  <p>Who is the smiling stranger<br>
  With hair as white as gin,<br>
  What is he doing with the children<br>
  And who could have let him in?    </p>
  
  <p>Why has he rubies on his fingers,<br>
  A cold, cold crown on his head,<br>
  Why, when he caws his carol,<br>
  Does the salty snow run red?    </p>
  
  <p>Why does he ferry my fireside<br>
  As a spider on a thread,<br>
  His fingers made of fuses<br>
  And his tongue of gingerbread?     </p>
  
  <p>Why does the world before him<br>
  Melt in a million suns,<br>
  Why do his yellow, yearning eyes<br>
  Burn like saffron buns?    </p>
  
  <p>Watch where he comes walking<br>
  Out of the Christmas flame,<br>
  Dancing, double-talking:    </p>
  
  <p>Herod is his name.    </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It can be taken at face value as a poetic rendering of Herod's order for the murder of children at what would become Christmas-time. </p>

<p>However, several of the lines, particularly the reference to ""fuses"" and""melt in a million suns"" make it clear this is a metaphor. Apparently, Causley's work often shows a strong anti-war sentiment, which seems a likely interpretation. However, conflating it with Christmas and the murder of innocents seems an odd choice.</p>

<p>In addition, the un-named figure in the poem has a sense of the mythic about it, and the legends of South West England are another common theme in Causley's poems. This fits better with the Christmas setting, but seems to jar with the ""fuses"".</p>

<p>Are there additional interpretations that I have missed, and is there a central theme threading all the various metaphors together?</p>

  More productive<br>
  Comfortable<br>
  Not drinking too much<br>
  Regular exercise at the gym, three days a week<br>
  Getting on better with your associate employee contemporaries<br>
  At ease<br>
  Eating well, no more microwave dinners and saturated fats<br>
  A patient, better driver<br>
  A safer car, baby smiling in back seat<br>
  Sleeping well, no bad dreams<br>
  No paranoia<br>
  Careful to all animals, never washing spiders down the plughole<br>
  Keep in contact with old friends, enjoy a drink now and then<br>
  Will frequently check credit at moral bank, hole in wall<br>
  Favours for favours, fond but not in love<br>
  Charity standing orders on sundays, ring-road supermarket<br>
  No killing moths or putting boiling water on the ants<br>
  Car wash, also on sundays<br>
  No longer afraid of the dark or midday shadows, nothing so ridiculously teenage<br> and desperate<br>
  Nothing so childish<br>
  At a better pace, slower and more calculated<br>
  <strong>No chance of escape</strong><br>
  Now self-employed<br>
  <strong>Concerned, but powerless</strong><br>
  An empowered and informed member of societ, pragmatism not idealism<br>
  Will not cry in public<br>
  Less chance of illness<br>
  Tires that grip in the wet, shot of baby strapped in backseat<br>
  A good memory<br>
  Still cries at a good film<br>
  Still kisses with saliva<br>
  <strong>No longer empty and frantic</strong><br>
  Like a cat<br>
  Tied to a stick<br>

  Calm, fitter, healthier and more productive<br>

<p>Not coincidentally, the entire thing is read in a robotic, synthesized voice. Clearly, this is referring to the ""deadening,"" entrapping effects of the lifestyle in question.</p>

<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OK_Computer"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikipedia</a> describes this as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Fitter Happier"" is a short musique concrète track that consists of sampled musical and background sound and spoken-word lyrics recited by a synthesised voice from the Macintosh SimpleText application. The voice belongs to ""Fred"", a synthesised voice included with Macintosh computers. Yorke wrote the lyrics ""in ten minutes"" after a period of writer's block while the rest of the band were playing. He described the words as a checklist of slogans for the 1990s, and he considered the lyrics ""the most upsetting thing I've ever written"", and said it was ""liberating"" to give the words to a neutral-sounding computer voice. Among the samples in the background is an audio loop from the 1975 film Three Days of the Condor. The band considered using ""Fitter Happier"" as the album's opening track, but decided the effect was off-putting.</p>
  
  <p>Steve Lowe called the song ""penetrating surgery on pseudo-meaningful corporations' lifestyles"" with ""a repugnance for prevailing yuppified social values"". Among the loosely connected imagery of the lyrics, Footman identified the song's subject as ""the materially comfortable, morally empty embodiment of modern, Western humanity, half-salaryman, half-Stepford Wife, destined for the metaphorical farrowing crate, propped up on Prozac, Viagra and anything else his insurance plan can cover."" Sam Steele called the lyrics ""a stream of received imagery: scraps of media information, interspersed with lifestyle ad slogans and private prayers for a healthier existence. It is the hum of a world buzzing with words, one of the messages seeming to be that we live in such a synthetic universe we have grown unable to detect reality from artifice.""</p>

<p>Is this song comparable to ""Hotel California"" in a way - you can check out any time you like, but you can never leave (""No chance of escape"")? Or am I missing the point?</p>

"How did contemporary readers respond to coincidence in 19th century novels","<p>Reading 19th century literature in the 21st century, it is often striking how often the plot turns on often quite outrageous coincidences. Frequently this happens when a relatively small cast of characters interact over a lengthy novel.</p>

<p>To take two examples, the Creature in <em>Frankenstein</em> kills Victor's brother and friend without knowing who they are; and the narrative of <em>David Copperfield</em> spans at least two decades in which no more than ten major characters work for each other, live with each other, drown at sea together, or just generally turn up in the same place together without any convincing explanation.</p>

<p>Did contemporary readers just accept this? Were they put off? Was the coincidence necessary to reassure them that it wasn't real in some way?</p>

"Has there been any criticism of Bryan Smith's depiction in The Dark Tower series?","<p>At some point during <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_Tower_VII:_The_Dark_Tower"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>The Dark Tower VII: The Dark Tower</em></a> Roland's ka-tet has to save Stephen King, who ultimately seems to be a representation of one of the tower's beams, from getting hit by a car during one of his walks.</p>

<p>This part, like others of King's depictions, seems to be a largely autobiographical fictionalization of King's real accident in 1999. In fact, apart from the ka-tet's intervention and the ultimate reason for the accident, it even seems to depict the driver and the circumstances leading to the accident quite similarly to how they supposedly happened in reality.</p>

<p>It does, however, not paint the driver Bryan Smith in an all too favourable light, being basically a reckless stoner and coward. While the circumstances of the accident and maybe even his characterization don't seem all too far from reality and after what he did Bryan Smith sure shouldn't have much reason to complain, it raises some moral questions about King treating his accident publicly at the expense of Bryan Smith this way, especially in light of Smith already being dead by then (he died in 2000, on King's birthday actually).</p>

<p>So <strong>has there ever been any public criticism of how derogatorily King depicted this real person in the story</strong>? Is this just ignored because it is ultimately only a fictionalization? Or was it ignored because it <em>doesn't</em> spread too far from reality? Or has Bryan Smith just not been seen in the moral position to complain after what he did? (I might well have interpreted his depiction as more derogatory than it was, though.)</p>

In order to learn what is really going on and how King knows about Roland and the Tower, he hypnotizes him, which leads to King telling about an event from his early childhood, where he had to saw wood in the barn of his uncle and was attacked by a group of little red spiders coming from dead chickens, only to be saved by Eddie and Cuthbert Allgood.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""In  the  barn.""  King's  voice  dropped.  His  lips  had  begun  to  tremble.  ""Auntie  sent  me  out  because we tried to run away. [...] Me and my brother Dave. They caught us and brought us back. They said we were bad, bad boys."" [...]<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""That was your punishment.""<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""Yes."" A tear welled in the corner of King's right eye. It slipped down his cheek to the edge of his beard. ""The chickens are dead. [...] Uncle Oren says it was avian flu. Their eyes are open. They're . . . a little scary."" [...]<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""You couldn't leave the barn?""<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""Not  until  I  saw  my  share  of  the  wood.  David  did  his.  It's  my  turn.  There  are  spiders  in  the  chickens.  Spiders  in  their  guts,  little  red  ones.  Like  specks  of  red  pepper.  If  they  get  on  me  I'll  catch the flu and die. Only then I'll come back. [...] I'll be a vampire. I'll be a slave to him. His scribe, maybe. His pet writer. [...] The Lord of the Spiders. The Crimson King, Tower-pent.""<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""Christ, Roland,"" Eddie whispered. He was shuddering. What had they found here? What nest had they exposed? ""Sai King, Steve, how old were you — are you?""<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""I'm seven."" A pause. ""I wet my pants. I don't want the spiders to bite
   me. The red spiders. But then you came, Eddie, and I went free."" He smiled radiantly, his cheeks gleaming with tears.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Apparently this early experience was the first moment where Stephen King was tempted or attacked by the Crimson King in order to drag him and his creative powers onto his side and where he was ultimately drawn to the ways of Gan instead by Eddie and Cuthbert.</p>

<p>What I wonder is <strong>how much this event actually resembles a real event, or even trauma, from Stephen King's childhood</strong>. Many parts of the finctionalized King's story in <em>The Dark Tower</em> seem autobiographical to some degree. Was all of this childhood story just made up or does this resemble a real sitaution that happened to Stephen King? Could we even go as far as this experience, <em>if</em> it happened, influencing the imagery of the Crimson King as a big red spider or was that just retrofitted into the existing, possibly less traumatic, real memory?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>ASTROFF. A woman can only become a man's friend after having first
  been his acquaintance and then his beloved—then she becomes his
  friend.</p>

  look on me with compassion; you think, ""Poor woman, she is married to
  an old man."" How well I understand your compassion! As Astroff said
  just now, see how you thoughtlessly destroy the forests, so that there
  will soon be none left. So you also destroy mankind, and soon fidelity
  and purity and self-sacrifice will have vanished with the woods. Why
  cannot you look calmly at a woman unless she is yours? Because, the
  doctor was right, you are all possessed by a devil of destruction; you
  have no mercy on the woods or the birds or on women or on one another.</p>

"Why does the Czech translation of ""Till we have faces"" mean the opposite?","<p>The title of the book <em>Till we have faces</em> by C. S. Lewis is translated into Czech language as <em>Dokud nemáme tvář</em>. I would translate that into English literally as ""While we don't have a face"" or ""Until we don't have a face"", which is not very clear. But in both cases, it is the opposite of the original English name.  </p>

<p>EDIT (based on comments):
The Czech world <em>dokud</em> can be translated as both <em>until</em> or <em>while</em>. I know that in English <em>until</em> and <em>while</em> is not the same. 
My presumption, that the translations means the opposite is based on the fact that in one language the title is about having a face, while it is about NOT having a face in the other.</p>

"Was Shakespeare inspired by Olaus Magnus when writing Macbeth?","<p>One important plot point in <em>Macbeth</em> is that the King feels invincible due to the prophecy that </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Macbeth shall never vanquish'd be until<br>
  Great Birnam wood to high Dunsinane hill<br>
  Shall come against him.<br>
  (Act 4, Scene 1)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This, of course, happens in the final act, in the form of the soldiers under Malcolm who have cut branches from the wood where they made camp (Act 5, scene 4).</p>

<p>This is similar to a story told by <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olaus_Magnus"" rel=""noreferrer"">Olaus Magnus</a> in his work on Swedish history and society, <em>Historia de Gentibus Septentrionalibus</em>, printed in 1555: The Swedish king Hachonis are making war against the Danish king Sigaro, and are camping in a forest. The soldiers are ordered to cut branches and advance slowly on Sigaro's castle. A messenger tells Sigaro that a wood is advancing on his castle, and he interprets this as an omen that his death is near, and he is indeed slain in the following battle. (Book 7, chapter XX; AFAIK, neither of these kings have much if any basis in reality).</p>

<p>In my admittedly limited search for other potential sources I have not found anyone suggesting anywhere else where Shakespeare could have gotten it from. </p>

"Understanding political subtexts in the Turing test paper","<p>Alan Turing's article ""Computing Machinery and Intelligence"" (<a href=""http://www.loebner.net/Prizef/TuringArticle.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">which you can read online</a>) is commonly interpreted as introducing the Turing test. Briefly, the Turing test is when you have two computer terminals, one controlled by a human in different room, and another controlled by a computer. A second human then has to determine which terminal is the human-controlled terminal and which is the computer-controlled terminal.</p>

<p>However, if you read the actual text of the article, you will notice something strange. The test Turing proposes at the introduction is actually a test to see if someone can identify a terminal controlled by a man from a terminal controlled by a woman:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The new form of the problem can be described in terms of a game which we call the 'imitation game."" It is played with three people, a man (A), a woman (B), and an interrogator (C) who may be of either sex. The interrogator stays in a room apart front the other two. The object of the game for the interrogator is to determine which of the other two is the man and which is the woman. He knows them by labels X and Y, and at the end of the game he says either ""X is A and Y is B"" or ""X is B and Y is A."" The interrogator is allowed to put questions to A and B thus:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's only at the end of the article that Turing brings computers into play. He asks what would happen if a machine replaced the man, and whether the game would change. Turing reasons that if the third human identified the human man from the human woman at the same rate the third human identifies the machine pretending to be a man from the human woman, then the machine is indistinguishable from being a human.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We now ask the question, ""What will happen when a machine takes the part of [the man] in this game?"" Will the interrogator decide wrongly as often when the game is played like this as he does when the game is played between a man and a woman? These questions replace our original, ""Can machines think?""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Note that gender continues to play a role in the test. The Turing test, <em>as Turing proposes it</em>, is whether a human can identify a machine from a terminal controlled by a woman. <strong>Never in his paper does Turing propose a test where the only thing a human has to identify a terminal controlled by a human whose gender is unspecified from a computer controlled terminal</strong>.</p>

<p>My question is, why talk about gender at all? In particular, why talk about gender at the very beginning of the paper, and only later discuss the (presumably) real topic of the paper, computers?  Note that it's extremely unlikely that this is ""random"" (whatever ""random"" means in the context of literature).</p>

<hr>

<p>This answer has gotten a lot of answers arguing that gender has nothing to do with the test. I suppose this is a good thing: it's good to get a lot of different viewpoints. However, a possible answer that no one has considered yet is that Turing's paper may be related to various tropes about AI and gender. An answer arguing along that lines is something I would really be interested in reading.</p>

<p>If you're interested in writing such an answer but worried that it will get buried under the other answers here, don't worry! I'll accept the first good answer I see, which will move the answer to the top of the answers.</p>

<p>If you're unconvinced that such an answer exists, I would encourage you to take a closer look at Tariq Ali's excellent answer, which cites a paper dedicated to rebutting interpretations of Turing's paper that focus on gender. I'm interested in an answer that explains the arguments that Tariq Ali's answer rebuts.</p>

Each of them talks with a different typeface, to help differentiate their manners of speech and personality.</p>

<p>I'm wondering why Delirium speaks with colored speech bubbles. I understand that the shifting font size shows her to be slightly tipsy and not quite coherent, but I wonder what quality of speech might be indicated by the changing colors of the bubbles. Is it just more of the same, or do the colors indicate something else about Delirium's speech? (Whimsy, perhaps? My brother noticed that the colors of the speech bubbles in one panel matched the colors of the butterflies that Delirium created.)</p>

<p><strong>Is there a reason her eyes are two different colors?</strong> It appears from the above passage that it may have something to do with her development from Delight; is one color normally associated with delight, and the other with delirium?</p>

<p>I read this book as a child and thought it was nothing more than an amusing pun - the ""left"" wing being the right wing because it was the only one <em>left</em>.

<p>While I've read most of Baum's <em>Oz</em> series - albeit when I was probably too young to pick up on many political allegories - I don't know enough about his political leanings or other relevant surrounding context to be able to judge whether this reading is a valid interpretation or not.</p>

  <p>Life is odd, Ella. In the end I never made it to Mecca or Medina. Not then, not later. Not even after I converted to Islam. Destiny took me on a different route altogether, one of unexpected twists and turns, each of which changed me so profoundly and irrevocably that after a while the original destination lost its significance. Though motivated by purely materialistic reasons at the outset, when the journey came to an end, I was a transformed man.  </p>
  
  <p>As for the Sufis, who could have known that what I had initially seen as a means to an end would very soon become an end in itself? This part of my life I call my encounter with the letter u in the word “Sufi.”</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>While living with the Sufi brotherhood, he learns about Shams of Tabriz:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I was intrigued. But it was more than simple curiosity. As I listened to Master Sameed tell me more about Shams, I felt a shiver down my spine, an odd feeling of déjà vu.  </p>
  
  <p>Now, you are going to think I’m crazy. But I swear to God, at that moment I heard a rustle of silk in the background, first far off, then drawing nearer, and I saw the shadow of someone who wasn’t there. Perhaps it was the evening breeze moving across the branches, or maybe it was a pair of angel wings. Either way, I suddenly knew that I didn’t need to go anywhere. Not anymore. I was sick and tired of always longing to be somewhere else, somewhere beyond, always in a rush despite myself.  </p>
  
  <p>I was already where I wanted to be. All I needed was to stay and look within. This new part of my life I call my encounter with the letter f in the word “Sufi.”</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Finally, in his hotel room in Boston, he tells her about his cancer and subsequent travels around the world:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Then I retreated to write the novel I had always wanted to write but, in my laziness or lack of courage, had postponed endlessly,” said Aziz with a wink. “You know, it was one of those things I had wanted to do for a long time. I named the book Sweet Blasphemy and sent it to a literary agency in America, not expecting much and at the same time feeling open to all possibilities. A week later I received an intriguing e-mail from a mystery woman in Boston.”</p>
  
  <p>Ella couldn’t help but smile. A weak smile of respectful compassion, tender and pained. Aziz said ever since that moment nothing had been the same. From a man getting ready to die, he had turned into a man falling in love at a most unexpected time. Suddenly all the pieces that he thought he’d long ago put into place had to be moved. Spirituality, life, family, mortality, faith, and love—he found himself rethinking their meanings again and not wanting to die.</p>
  
  <p>This new and final stage of his life he called his encounter with the letter i in the word “Sufi.” And he said so far this stage had proved to be much more difficult than all the earlier ones, because it had come at a time when he thought he’d worked through most, if not all, of his inner conflicts, a time when he thought he was spiritually mature and fulfilled.</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What is the connection between these letters and the stages of his life?</strong> It reminded me of the way Shams assigned significance to the individual letters of Rumi's name earlier in the story (<em>the powerful, lucid R; the velvety U; the intrepid and self-confident M; and the mysterious I, yet to be solved</em>), and also of the idea that the entire Koran can be encapsulated in the initial letter B, but how do the different letters symbolise different parts and aspects of life? Is mystical significance of letters part of the Sufi belief, perhaps?</p>

She's very much in love with him, as we see from the chapters written from her point of view. The wedding night is described from Shams's point of view, and he feels desire for her too, but he refuses to sleep with her as her husband:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I kissed her again. The warmth of her lips sent waves of desire across my entire body. She smelled of jasmine and wildflowers. Stretching out beside her, I inhaled her smell and touched her breasts, so small and firm. All I wanted was to enter her and get lost inside her. She offered herself to me the way a rosebud opens to the rain.</p>
  
  <p>I pulled away. “I’m sorry, Kimya. I can’t do this.”</p>

<p>He steadfastly refuses to sleep with her throughout their marriage, even when she tries all the tricks in the book to seduce him. <strong>Why?</strong></p>

<p>I don't recall anything about Shams taking an oath of celibacy. Nor can it be anything to do with his being a Sufi, because in Islam there's no such thing as clerical celibates or 'monasticism' in the typical Christian sense. He talks so much about love, so why does he refuse to make love with this girl, despite the fact that she wants to, at least part of him wants to, AND they're married?</p>

"Why include the frame story in The Forty Rules of Love?","<p>The book <em>The Forty Rules of Love</em> contains two stories told in parallel: firstly, the story of Ella and Aziz in the 21st century; secondly, the story of Rumi and Shams in the 13th century as told by Aziz in his novel <em>Sweet Blasphemy</em> which Ella is reading and reviewing. I would say that the main point of Şafak's book, what sets it apart from many other modern romance novels, is the story of Rumi and Shams: it teaches the average modern reader a lot about life in the 13th-century Middle East, and it also adds context to the Ella-Aziz relationship by comparison. Why, then, didn't Şafak simply write the book Aziz did - a story about Rumi and Shams, without giving it any 21st-century context?</p>

<p>Winston takes a sip of VICTORY GIN after entering his apartment and simply watches outside turning his back to the telescreen, which resides in an unusual position due to an alcove and the reader is led to..</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It was partly the unusual geography of the room that had suggested to him the thing that he was about to do.</p>
  
  <p>But it had also been suggested by the book that he had just taken out of the drawer. It was a beautiful book, smooth creamy paper.. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>where what he is about to do is to start a diary.. So it is almost immediately after he enters his apartment, he gets inspired by his surroundings, not after a while. And we also know that it is a 20 minute walk from Ministry of Truth to his apartment. </p>

<p>However, after writing for a while in his diary he stops and we learn that..</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It was, he now realized, because of this other incident that he had suddenly decided to come home and begin the diary today.</p>

<p>Are we already warned that Winston has a terrible memory and conscious? Or is the narrator altering the past so quickly? </p>

<p>Who decides to start a diary and sacrifices his lunch in such a world where access to food is limited, forgets what he came home for, decides to start a diary due to a reason completely different than his original intent as he was leaving his work ~20 minutes ago?</p>

<p>Maybe there is a very simple explanation I am missing or I am not understanding the passage, or is there a different message here? </p>

<p>Here are some further hints I was able to find on Winstons memory from Chapter 1:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>He tried to squeeze out some childhood memory that should tell him whether London had always been quite like this. But it was no use, he could not remember: Nothing remained of his childhood.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The thing he was about to do was to open a diary. It was curious that he seemed not merely to have lost the power of expressing himself, but even to have forgotten what it was that he had originally intended to say. All he had to do was to transfer to paper the restless monologue that had been running inside his head, literally for years. At this moment, however, even the monologue had dried up.</p>

I don’t recall that it was a popular or extremely current book, as nobody else had chosen to read it in our class, but I don’t think it could have been written much earlier than the 70s; it seemed current enough, and the actual storyline was also somewhat contemporary.</p>

<p>I don’t remember much of the plot, but I believe the girl protagonist was an expat from the US living on the border of two or three  European countries: I believe Switzerland (possibly Belgium, but I think she was located near the Swiss alps for some reason). She was going to this foreign school and I believe she didn’t quite fit in (not 100% sure on this detail). Pretty sure regardless that she was homesick. </p>

<p>The biggest recollection I have of this story is the feeling and/or theme: she’s quite lonely, and lives in a very in-between sort of place (because she’s literally living on the border of these two/three countries: I <em>think</em> Switzerland and Italy; if not, possiblly her location was between Belgium, Switzerland and France). </p>

<p>The scene I can remember most vividly is a thematic description of the mountainous country surrounding her; she describes the differing terrains/ecosystems of the landscapes on each side of her: there’s a snowy, rough and high terrain (Swiss Alps?) and a (comparatively) more tropical, warm terrain (Italy?)</p>

"Searching for an Illustrated Children's Book with Animal Characters","<p>I just spent the last 5 hours browsing through google, pinterest, and eBay in an attempt to find a beautifully illustrated book I loved as a child. I remember what it is generally about, but I have not the slightest recollection of any names (title, author, illustrator, publisher, characters). I do remember that the edition we owned was hardcover and roughly 12 by 9.5 by 0.5 inches.</p>

<p>The story begins with a mouse in a speedster (possibly red) driving through the country one morning by a lake town. The mouse's automobile is rather loud and disturbs the locals who are trying to sleep. One of the mouse's tires is punctured by a nail/nails and he is stranded in that town(?) for the remainder of the book until the end where if I remember correctly he finally gets a new tire and leaves.</p>

<p>I remember that a white cat lets him stay with her (she wears victorian dresses and expensive necklaces of pearls and perhaps jewels). And there is a white goat who owned some sort of grocery store (I remember him on a ladder either putting things away or trying to reach something, and my sister remembers a scene where he is trying not to sneeze—probably the same scene). There is a dog whom my mother remembers being the handyman (possibly for the boat) and thinks was named Billy. I also have distinct scenes in my mind: one of the mouse somehow falling into the lake(?) and having to dry off with a towel, one of the goat laughing, one of the goat and cat having a glass of wine at night (I think they are discussing the mouse leaving and they are sad because they've grown fond of him), one of the white cat being swung around in a waltz at some celebration (possibly by the captain).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If a mere arrest could have secured the — er — good will and

</blockquote>

<p>This statement seems to imply that the only reason the N.I.C.E. brought Mark Studdock to Belbury was in order to get a hold of his wife, Jane. Now it turns out that Jane is a seer and an invaluable asset to either side, so the Institute wanting to get their paws on her makes perfect sense.</p>

<p>What doesn't make sense is that at the time Wither made that statement, the N.I.C.E. hadn't yet discovered Jane's powers. Frost had seen her in vision and was studying her in the vision—but we have no evidence that he knew it was Mark's wife that he was studying. Furthermore, Frost didn't see Jane in vision until <em>after</em> Mark was dragged to the Institute.</p>

<p>So, why did the N.I.C.E. want Mark Studdock at Belbury <em>before</em> they understood the significance of his wife and her gifts?</p>

<p>We are led to believe at various points before Wither's statement to the Fairy, that the Institute people wanted Mark so he could write good propaganda in the newspapers for them. But if that was the reason they brought him, why would Wither make that statement? </p>

<p>I would like to bring into analysis the role of Lizaveta, the pawnbroker's half sister who is accidentally killed by Raskolnikov. More specifically I'd like to understand in a better way how this episode (the killing of an innocent person) really influenced the rest of the book. In fact, it seems to me (but I may be  wrong) that what started as a potentially huge plot twist, later became less central or crucial to the book message. Let's put it like this: what would have happened if Raskolnikov only killed the evil pawnbroker and got away with it? One may say that all his immediate, post-murder, anxieties and second thoughts would have been much less severe and debilitating! He also felt empathetic towards the poor Lizaveta, almost enslaved by her sister. So my (wrong?) guess is that his hypothetical perfect crime would change the story quite a bit. Raskolnikov is indeed convinced (up to his typical overthinking) until the very end of the book (Siberia chapters) that killing the pawnbroker was not a bad thing at all. But here's the thing I don't get. In the book, especially the second part, it's more about the crime in itself, not much about the poor dead innocent. It feels to me that Lizaveta's death could have been used much more than it actually was, to work towards and to explain Raskolnikov's redemption.. for instance. But again it's not perceived to me as a very important fact in the end: Raskolnikov turns himself in because of his murder, it seems that with or without Lizaveta's death he would have done so anyway. </p>

<p>What do you think? Am I misinterpreting something? Or is this really the point of the book, that killing is wrong anyway?</p>

<p>Thank you!</p>

"How did Pilate order Judas' death in Master and Margarita?","<p>After several reads I am still struggling to understand the events around Judas' death in the Pilate story. On the face of it, the following things occur:</p>

<ol>
<li>Pilate has dinner with Aphranius (head of secret service), and mentions some of Yeshua's friends are plotting to kill Judas, discover how much money he was paid for betraying Yeshua, and return the money to the high priest with a note. Pilate insists all this will happen that same evening. Aphranius expresses surprise and concern at his own failing as he did not have this information.</li>
<li>Aphranius leaves the palace, orders some of his men out of town with carts 'loaded with entrenching tools and a barrel of water' (side question, is this to do with Judas or is it just for burying the executed men?). He talks with Niza, Judas' love interest. She then tempts Judas to Gethsemane outside the city. Once Judas arrives there, he is killed by Aphranius and his men, who also obtain the bribe money. Aphranius then attaches the note and returns to the palace.</li>
<li>Aphranius tells Pilate that Judas was killed exactly as Pilate had anticipated, and shows as evidence the money bag with note. He admits failure at having been unable to stop the death, and asks to be tried. Pilate questions him about the death, and Aphranius gives an invented story, carefully avoiding Niza and insisting that it could not have been a woman to tempt Judas to his death.</li>
<li>Pilate later tells Matthew Levi triumphantly that he killed Judas.</li>
</ol>

<p>Clearly Pilate did not directly order Aphranius to kill Judas. So was it a veiled order, or a manipulation of Aphranius (in that Aphranius had some reason of his own to kill Judas and this gave Aphranius the chance to blame the murder on Yeshua's followers)?</p>

<p>If it was a veiled order, what hinted to Aphranius that Pilate wanted Judas dead?</p>

<p>If Aphranius had his own motive for killing Judas why? Was he a secret disciple of Yeshua? If so, then why did Pilate have to give the order, couldn't he just rely on the chief spy to get it done at some point? </p>

"In the Iliad, why does Homer list every captain involved in the Trojan war?","<p>In book two of the <em>The Iliad</em> (<a href=""http://classics.mit.edu/Homer/iliad.2.ii.html"">which you can read online</a>), Homer does something that I find strange: he interrupts the story to list the name of every captain involved in the Trojan war:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And now, O Muses, dwellers in the mansions of Olympus, tell me- for you are goddesses and are in all places so that you see all things, while we know nothing but by report- who were the chiefs and princes of the Danaans? As for the common soldiers, they were so that I could not name every single one of them though I had ten tongues, and though my voice failed not and my heart were of bronze within me, unless you, O Olympian Muses, daughters of aegis-bearing Jove, were to recount them to me. Nevertheless, I will tell the captains of the ships and all the fleet together.</p>
  
  <p>Peneleos, Leitus, Arcesilaus, Prothoenor, and Clonius were captains of the Boeotians. These were they that dwelt in Hyria and rocky Aulis, and who held Schoenus, Scolus, and the highlands of Eteonus, with Thespeia, Graia, and the fair city of Mycalessus. They also held Harma, Eilesium, and Erythrae; and they had Eleon, Hyle, and Peteon; Ocalea and the strong fortress of Medeon; Copae, Eutresis, and Thisbe the haunt of doves; Coronea, and the pastures of Haliartus; Plataea and Glisas; the fortress of Thebes the less; holy Onchestus with its famous grove of Neptune; Arne rich in vineyards; Midea, sacred Nisa, and Anthedon upon the sea. From these there came fifty ships, and in each there were a hundred and twenty young men of the Boeotians. </p>

<p>This is just a tiny portion of the list: Homer continues listing these names for a long time.</p>

"What is the meaning of ""To Autumn""?","<p>Many poems are filled with metaphors and underlying ideas about deeper things and more broad issues or feelings. I personally feel that ""<a href=""https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems-and-poets/poems/detail/43609"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">To Marguerite</a>"" is an example of this, where the poem is bursting with stylistic devices, each of which contribute to the underlying ideas of the poem.</p>

<p>""<a href=""https://www.poetryfoundation.org/resources/learning/core-poems/detail/44484"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">To Autumn</a>"" is the 'other' kind of poem in my opinion. It's been described as ""nearly perfect, but doesn't have a lot to say"". If I'm not wrong, its only aim is to describe/praise Autumn. How would one effectively comment on Keats' writing in such a context? The poem is bursting with imagery, but how do you comment on it?</p>

"Is the cliffhanger at the end of ""First among sequels"" resolved?","<p>The book ""First among Sequels"" ends on a cliffhanger. The protagonist, Thursday Next, has to run for her life, to escape an impending fire.</p>

<p>The next book in the series, ""One of Our Thursdays is Missing"", has her counterpart Thursday5 investigate a crime. Thursday5 eventually finds Thursday Next, seriously wounded. </p>

<p>However, there don't seem to be burns involved. Thursday Next has been the victim of an attempt at her life, in the form of a taxi accident. Thursday Next's wounds are described as:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>She had a fractured skull, a broken femur, and eight breaks to her left arm and hand. There were multiple lacerations, a loss of blood, fever and a concussion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(I believe it also said somewhere that she had part of the taxi's steering column rammed through her in the accident. I haven't been able to find that back though).</p>

<p>So, it would seem that Thursday Nexts accident in ""One of Our Thursdays is Missing"" is a <em>different</em> one from the fire at the end of ""First among Sequels"" - where she may actually have escaped.</p>

<p>The book after that, ""The Woman who Died a Lot"", starts with a Thursday Next who has recovered enough to walk again.  </p>

<p>So it seems that the cliffhanger at the end of ""First among Sequels"" is never quite resolved. Closest thing I can think of, is that the remake of BookWorld at the beginning of ""One of Our Thursdays is Missing"", also changed recent history. This is never stated in the books though.  </p>

<p>It's not like Jasper Fforde to give us a cliffhanger and then not resolve it. At the very least he would make a joke about the structure or nature of stories. He hasn't done so in this case.</p>

<p>So - am I missing something here? Are the two issues the same? Or is there an unresolved cliffhanger?</p>

"Why does Stanley Uris react so gruesomely to It returning?","<p>Stephen King's novel <em>IT</em> concerns a group of children who confronted an evil entity haunting their town -- and their reunion twenty-five years later to face the being again for the final time.</p>

<p>Early in the novel, we see each of ""The Losers' Club"" react to the news and the summons. All are frightened, most are disbelieving, but they all answer the call -- all except for Stanley Uris, who commits suicide. Stanley kills himself, after scrawling a cryptic message on the wall with his own blood.</p>

<p>While this is a horror novel, and there is no question that <strong>It</strong> is horrifying, Stanley's behavior stands out in stark contrast to that of his friends. When I read the novel, I understood this as a kind of promise -- a promise that, as we learn the story of the children in '57-'58, one of the things we learn is how It left Stanley uniquely scarred among the group. Or, really, any explanation that would justify why Stanley kills himself in such an awful manner.</p>

<p>But as I read, I felt this was never addressed. I don't see Stanley as differentiating himself from the rest of the group in any particular way, or being more affected by It than the others, or being a person inclined to panic or suicide.</p>

<p><strong>Does <em>IT</em> explain why Stanley, and he alone, was driven to suicide?</strong> Or does the book not actually mean to imply that Stanley was unique in responding this way?</p>

"What concept of love does Tolstoy suggest in Anna Karenina?","<p>I know one of the characteristics of realistic works is they are mostly formulated as some independent studies of the life of society but, at the same time, I realise that the dominant approach to art in that time was to see it pragmatically, as a way to share your worldview.</p>

<p>Anna Karenina seems to describe lives of two relationships: Once (in the relationship between Anna Karenina and Vronsky) the characters fell into the natural desire for the ""natural love"" (éros, so to speak) and it ended badly and once, in the relationship of Kitty and Levin, the characters seemed to contemplate about their relationship for a while and they seemed to make a happy, overall fulfilled couple.</p>

<p>So we can see the book is pretty far from describing the naturalistic hopelessness and straightforward critique of the opportunistic society. Rather, I feel like Tolstoy thus argues by the natural nature of love for more liberal approach of society (the conservatism of Alexey and Mrs. Scherbatska had been devastating).</p>

<p>But is it really possible that Leo Tolstoy intended to make the story that symbolic? Can we see there some kind of model of love Tolstoy is trying to describe?</p>

"Meaning of the chapter structure in Calvino's Invisible Cities","<p>Italo Calvino's book <em>Invisible Cities</em> is essentially a collection of descriptions of cities. </p>

<p>What I find interesting is that the chapters follow a specific structure. There are ten categories of cities, labeled ""Cities &amp; Memory"", ""Cities &amp; Desire"", and so on. The book is also divided into ten chapters. It's hard to describe the structure, but <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invisible_Cities#Structure"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here's wikipedia's description</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The matrix of eleven column themes and fifty-five subchapters (ten rows in chapters 1 and 9, five in all others) shows some interesting properties. Each column has five entries, rows only one, so there are fifty-five cities in all. The matrix of cities has a central element (Baucis). The pattern of cities is symmetric with respect to inversion about that center. Equivalently, it is symmetric against 180 degree rotations about Baucis. Inner chapters (2-8 inclusive) have diagonal cascades of five cities (e.g. Maurila through Euphemia in chapter 2). These five-city cascades are displaced by one theme column to the right as one proceeds to the next chapter. In order that the cascade sequence terminates (the book of cities is not infinite!) Calvino, in chapter 9, truncates the diagonal cascades in steps: Laudomia through Raissa is a cascade of four cities, followed by cascades of three, two, and one, necessitating ten cities in the final chapter. The same pattern is used in reverse in chapter 1 as the diagonal cascade of cities is born</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wikipedia also provides a helpful table that allows you to ""see"" the structure visually.</p>

<p>My question is: how does this structure contribute to the meaning of the book? In other words, why did Calvino spend so much time creating this structure?</p>

Sara Danius, Permanent Secretary of the Swedish Academy, described Dylan as a ""great poet in the English tradition""; a poet, not a songwriter.

"How did Sheymov manage to convince KGB that he and the family were dead?","<p>Closer to the end of the book, Sheymov's contact from CIA refused to go with his plan to fake their family death when defecting. In <em>Chapter 11</em>, ""Misha"" refuses to help with the plan:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Victor nodded, then introduced his embellishment. “Good. Now, Misha, I will need your help on something else. We’ll have a tremendously greater advantage if the KGB is not aware that I’m in the United States.” Victor paused. “<strong>How about leading them to believe we’re dead</strong>?”<br>
  Caught completely off guard, Misha stared at Victor, trying to see if he was joking. He wasn’t. Misha chuckled: “<strong>Look, let’s just keep this professional, OK? We don’t have time to fantasize.</strong>”<br>
  “Misha, just listen to me. I think we’ve got a real opportunity here. For example, the three of us could go to the countryside, rent a rowboat, and capsize it. If it’s abandoned near a large water system with a fairly strong current, it would be perfectly natural not to find our bodies. I know for certain that in a number of such drownings every year the bodies simply never turn up.”<br>
  “<strong>No, Victor. Now you listen to me. Without mentioning the fact that a stunt like that would rob us of at least eighteen hours’ lead time, I can guarantee that nobody in Washington is going to approve it. Our highest priority is to deliver you safely, without taking any avoidable risks. So just forget it, and let’s concentrate on the task at hand</strong>.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Later in Chapter 11, he tells his wife about this and that he's still interested in the idea:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“What did your contact think of our ‘dying’?”<br>
  “According to the Americans, ‘<strong>playing dead’is not a good idea. From a conventional point of view, I suppose I have to agree. And that idea with the rowboat has to be abandoned. We can’t pull it off without the Americans’ help. Besides, they’ve got a point, it would rob us of eighteen hours. Nevertheless, I’m still determined to try to lead the KGB to believe that we’re dead. I’m going to do my damndest to pull it off</strong>. The fact is, there’s zero risk in it. If we succeed, we’ll have a tremendous advantage—not to mention that it would make things much easier for those we leave behind.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yet, in the last <em>chapter 12</em>, it indicates that the death faking indeed happen, but I don't think it was described how. All we see is that Victor is worried about being recognized, which would destroy his plan to be assumed to be dead:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I know, but it’s a tough call. Uzhgorod is in the border zone. On the one hand the Border Guards will every now and then raid trains like this one. They ask everyone for full identification and want to know exactly where you’re going and who you’ll be staying with. That’ll blow up everything I’ve been lining up so carefully. <strong>Also, our being here would be registered, and good-bye to any hope that they’d count us dead</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The last ""<em>About the author</em>"" section confirms this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In 1980, after establishing a contact with the CIA, Victor and his wife, Olga, and their five-year-old daughter were exfiltrated from Moscow. <strong>The KGB were even persuaded that they were dead</strong>. For his contribution to the national security of the United States, Sheymov was awarded the CIA’s highest medal.</p>

"Why does the narrator of ""Master and Margarita"" say that Caribbean are fiction?","<p>Bulgakov describes the appearance of the Archibald Archibaldovich (chief of the security of the MASSOLIT restaurant) in quite a peculiar way:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>At  midnight  there appeared a vision in this hell. On  to the verandah
  strode a  handsome, black-eyed man with  a  pointed beard and wearing a tail
  coat. With  regal gaze he  surveyed his  domain. According to some romantics
  there had once been a time when  this noble figure had worn not  tails but a
  broad  leather belt  round  his  waist, stuck with  pistol-butts,  that  his
  raven-black hair had been tied up  in a scarlet kerchief and  that  his brig
  had sailed the Caribbean under the Jolly Roger.<br/>
       But that, of  course, is pure fantasy--<strong>the Caribbean  doesn't exist, no
  desperate  buccaneers sail it,  no  corvette ever chases  them, no  puffs of
  cannon-smoke  ever  roll across  the waves</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is quite peculiar - maybe indeed the romanticised pirates akin to Jack Sparrow did not exist, but definitely there were pirates/privateers/bandits in the geographical region called ""Caribbean"" that anyone can find on the map. Was the existence of the Caribbean Islands somehow censored by the Soviet Union or was it Bulgakov's personal opinion? </p>

<p>To be honest, this whole paragraph of text is quite weird, because it seems that the narrator suddenly changed from the third to the first person:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Look  at that
  scraggy tree, look at the iron railings, the boulevard. . . . And the ice is
  floating in the  wine-bucket and  at  the  next table  there's  a  man  with
  ox-like, bloodshot  eyes and it's pandemonium. . . . Oh gods--poison, I need
  poison! . . .</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What was the point of this strange outburst from the (until this time) impersonal narrator?</p>

<p>EDIT: TvTropes suggest that characters in the book (mainly Master, Woland and Berlioz) are meant to be the narrator. This would make sense if the author of the paragraph was Behemot or Korovyev goofing around...</p>

"Why did Owen Kellogg have a practical need for physics but Dagney didn't?","<p>When Dagney Taggart spent time in the Valley, she asked to be allowed to attend John Galt's lectures on physics. He refused on the grounds that he didn't want to give her information or ideas that could be used to help people on the outside, and that all of his students had a practical need for it (implication: she didn't). Some of his students included (among others) Dwight Sanders (formerly an aircraft manufacturer), Ted Nielsen (formerly a motor manufacturer), Quentin Daniels (professional physicist), and Owen Kellogg (formerly a manager for Taggert Transcontinental).</p>

<p>Most of those make perfect sense - physics has obvious applications to manufacturing aircraft and motors.

"Trying to remember a junior fiction story about boys who go back to medieval times","<p>The two main characters are around age 13. They find? steal? a time machine from someone and end up back in Medieval England. But it's not them exactly - their consciousnesses get put into other bodies. The protagonist finds himself in some knight's body, while the deuteragonist initially gets put into the knight's horse! Later he gets thrown into the knight's squire (and the squire is mid-sentence when it happens, it's a rather bizarre scene). </p>

<p>Aside from the fish-out-of-water aspects, the main conflict is some evil knight, who eventually challenges knight-boy to a duel. I'm pretty sure the kid wins, but I don't remember the rest of the plot, and I don't remember how they get back to their own bodies and time.</p>

<p>I seem to remember that when the two are discussing whether to actually use the time machine, they talk about how the protagonist has hatched a lot of hair-brained schemes, including trying to sell some gross treats that turned out to be ""worse, not better, than they looked."" That might all be from another book entirely though.</p>

<p>I want to say the deuteragonist's name was Max.</p>

<p>This book was adapted into an animated film (not feature length - it might have been an episode in an anthology series) that I remember watching too. In it there's some knight with chicken pox, and he tells people not to touch him because he's cursed with ""little red itchy dots.""</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""The speaker challenges the idea of pleasure in the minds of the
  audience, and argues that pleasure is an unavoidable part of life;
  only by accepting this, and giving and receiving pleasure, can one
  enjoy life to the fullest.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The poem is pretty difficult to understand for me, so I was wondering if it accurately illustrates the point the author is trying to make, and covers the entire poem. Also, is it more of a summary, or does it actually goes into the deeper meaning behind the poem?</p>

<p>Here is the poem.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>From <a href=""http://www.katsandogz.com/onpleasure.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://www.katsandogz.com/onpleasure.html</a>:</p>
  
  <p>Pleasure is a freedom-song, But it is not freedom. It is the
  blossoming of your desires, But it is not their fruit. It is a depth
  calling unto a height, But it is not the deep nor the high. It is the
  caged taking wing, But it is not space encompassed. Ay, in very truth,
  pleasure is a freedomsong. And I fain would have you sing it with
  fullness of heart; yet I would not have you lose your hearts in the
  singing.</p>
  
  <p>Some of your youth seek pleasure as if it were all, and they are
  judged and rebuked. I would not judge nor rebuke them. I would have
  them seek. For they shall find pleasure, but not her alone; Seven are
  her sisters, and the least of them is more beautiful than pleasure.
  Have you not heard of the man who was digging in the earth for roots
  and found a treasure?</p>
  
  <p>And some of your elders remember pleasures with regret like wrongs
  committed in drunkenness. But regret is the beclouding of the mind and
  not its chastisement. They should remember their pleasures with
  gratitude, as they would the harvest of a summer. Yet if it comforts
  them to regret, let them be comforted.</p>
  
  <p>And there are among you those who are neither young to seek nor old to
  remember; And in their fear of seeking and remembering they shun all
  pleasures, lest they neglect the spirit or offend against it. But even
  in their foregoing is their pleasure. And thus they too find a
  treasure though they dig for roots with quivering hands. But tell me,
  who is he that can offend the spirit? Shall the nightingale offend the
  stillness of the night, or the firefly the stars? And shall your flame
  or your smoke burden the wind? Think you the spirit is a still pool
  which you can trouble with a staff?</p>
  
  <p>Oftentimes in denying yourself pleasure you do but store the desire in
  the recesses of your being. Who knows but that which seems omitted
  today, waits for tomorrow? Even your body knows its heritage and its
  rightful need and will not be deceived. And your body is the harp of
  your soul, And it is yours to bring forth sweet music from it or
  confused sounds.</p>
  
  <p>And now you ask in your heart, ""How shall we distinguish that which is
  good in pleasure from that which is not good?"" Go to your fields and
  your gardens, and you shall learn that it is the pleasure of the bee
  to gather honey of the flower, But it is also the pleasure of the
  flower to yield its honey to the bee. For to the bee a flower is a
  fountain of life, And to the flower a bee is a messenger of love, And
  to both, bee and flower, the giving and the receiving of pleasure is a
  need and an ecstasy.</p>
  
  <p>People of Orphalese, be in your pleasures like the flowers and the
  bees.</p>

"Why is the 'a cat may look at a king' quote relevant for when Dr. Rohmer is looking at the man on the podium?","<p>In <em>The View From Saturday</em>, chapter 2 (page 22 in my copy), there's this quote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On her left sat Dr. Roy Clayton Rohmer, the District Superintendent for Clarion Academy. Both Dr. Rohmer and Mrs. Olinski paid strict attention to the man at the podium. There could be no mistake: This was the man of the hour, king for the day.<br>
  He wore a navy blue, precision fit pin-striped suit and a white-on-dazzling-white shirt. An edge of his French cuffs showed beneath his jacket sleeves. Mrs. Olinski was not sure how much the correct amount was, but if she put a spirit-level to his, they would be exactly right. The French cuffs were held together with onyx cuff links, and his collar was tied with a red-striped power necktie. The television lights beamed down on his crop of hair, which was tinted the color of peach pits. He was dressed, brushed, coiffed, and blow-dried not just to be seen but to be looked at.</p>
  
  <p>Dr. Rohmer could not, would not take his eyes off the man at the podium, and Mrs. Olinski thought of <em>Alice in Wonderland</em>. ""Don't look at me like that!"" said the King to the Cheshire Cat. ""A cat may look at a King,"" said Alice. Mrs. Olinski wanted to tell Dr. Rohmer that a cat may look at a king. But why bother? The audience was not permitted to speak.</p>

"Why do the translators of ""Social Justice in Islam"" strongly hint at its controversiality, without mentioning what's controversial?","<p>I recently started reading the book, ""Social Justice in Islam."" This is a book by Sayyid Qutb, translated into English by John B. Hardie, commissioned by the Near Eastern Translation Program. There's not really any good references to any of these people online outside this book, nor is there any information about what the Near Eastern Translation Program was or what it did. Questions about who ran this program and why aside (though I'm very curious to know), they went to great lengths in their translation to highlight the controversiality of this book.</p>

<p>But they really didn't talk about what in it was controversial, who found it controversial, and why they classify it that way. The foreword to the book reads like someone defensively trying to justify translating <em>this book</em>, ending, for example, with:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It should, of course, be clearly understood that the views expressed in the works translated are the opinions of the writers and not of the American Council of Learned Societies or the Committee on Near Eastern Studies. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This seems like it goes beyond the standard disclaimer of authorial opinion. <em>Especially</em> in context, it's written in a much more personal tone, as if the writer <em>really</em> wants to emphasize this point. The translator's introduction goes on to highlight exactly the same thing:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""There will be many points which the specialist and the non-specialist alike will feel like challenging. So much the better, for this, from a Western point of view, is a provocative book. But the aim of the present work has been neither to comment nor to criticize, but simply to translate, as the author himself would have written it, had he written in English.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This also vaguely hints at some sort of controversy, predicted or past, surrounding this book. It's also the second time this is mentioned, and it occurs no more than <em>one page</em> after the prior quote. </p>

<p>And, to be clear, there's vague historical reason to believe that this book was, indeed, controversial, even in Muslim societies. A more modern book cover has this to say about the author:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Social Justice in Islam"" is perhaps the best known work of Sayyib Qutb, a leading figure in the Muslim Brethen of Egypt who was <strong>executed by the regime of 'Abd al-Nasr in 1966</strong>. Despite the years that have passed since Sayyid Qutb's death, the imprint of his thought on the contemporary Islamic movements of the Arab world remains profound. [emph. mine]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To me, all of these things seem like loose threads suggesting that some part of this book either <em>was</em> controversial, or was <em>expected to be</em> controversial - both to Muslim cultures and to Western ones. But nobody really seems to want to talk about why.</p>

<p><em>Was</em> there some sort of controversy surrounding this book, either in Muslim countries, ""Western"" countries, or both? If so, who took issue with it, and what, exactly, were the issues taken?</p>

<p>Also, if I'm reading this correctly, why, then, do the translators go to such great lengths to highlight how controversial this book is, without explaining anything about what's controversial in it?</p>

"Symbolism of Occam's death in Straight Man?","<p>In Richard Russo's novel <em>Straight Man</em>, the protagonist Hank claims to be a philosophical disciple of William of Occam, and applies Occam's razor to his approach to deduction many times.

<p>He names his dog Occam, which escapes from his house near the climax of the book, and is hit by a car and killed by one of his colleagues, Finny.  This provides some natural narrative symmetry by leading to a scene at the end where he buries his dog with his estranged dying father looking on, complementing a scene from the beginning where his father buries a dog with him as a child looking on.  One could also read into Occam's death some symbolism regarding the distance Hank puts between himself and others in his relationships.  Putting those points aside:</p>

  <p>Is there any significance that a character named ""Occam"", rather than just Hank's dog, dies at the end?  For instance, is there any evidence that Hank no longer so strongly subscribes to Occam's razor?</p>

It wasn't only those aspects like verbosity, but also a certain style—a grandeur, almost an admirable innocence.</p>

  such an argument were specious merely. I will be quite frank with you.
  I will confess to you that, in this humbling of myself before you, I
  take a pleasure as passionate as it is strange. A confusion of
  feelings? Yet you, with a woman's instinct, will have already caught
  the clue to it. It needs no mirror to assure me that the clue is here
  for you, in my eyes. It needs no dictionary of quotations to remind me

<p>Given Dostoevsky's success already in Beerbohm's early life, I believe Dostoevsky must have influenced Beerbohm significantly, if he creates such a character to me so iconic of Dostoevsky. But Googling the two names only reveal some loose articles that happen to reference both authors, not any interviews or writings of Beerbohm regarding Dostoevsky. Maybe even Beerbohm found Dostoevsky disagreeable, and was satirizing Dostoevsky's caricatures of suddenly-impassioned men—I don't know.</p>

<p><strong>Are there any interviews or writings regarding Beerbohm's opinion of Dostoevsky?</strong> Or was Dostoevsky so omnipresent in the late 1800s that documenting his influence on any author would have been superfluous? I'm also open to any analyses that show influence (or non-influence), even if not explicitly said or written by Beerbohm. </p>

"Why do we see so little mention of Leopold Bloom's social isolation in his internal monologue?","<p>Leopold Bloom is the primary protagonist of Joyce's novel Ulysses. Throughout the novel, we are treated to an extensive transcription of his thoughts and feelings via the stream of consciousness method that Joyce was pioneering. This has lead to critics labeling Bloom as one of the most fully developed characters in literature.</p>

<p>A key theme of the novel is Bloom's relative social isolation. Although not poor and with apparent society connections, he is treated with mild contempt and rudeness by many of the other characters in the book. He is half-Jewish but even other relative outsiders to Irish society - such as Italian immigrant Nannetti - are shown to have a higher social status (Nannetti has been elected a Councillor) and to act as though they look down on Bloom.</p>

<p>What interests me is why this is rarely mentioned in his internal monologue. Indeed, given the different social mores between now and the novel's setting in 1904, it took me several chapters to realise Bloom <em>was</em> being disrespected by many of the other characters. </p>

<p>What is the purpose of this omission in the otherwise comprehensive study of Bloom's character? Are we to presume that he barely registers the snubs he perceives? Or is the lack of comment setting up some of the later themes and plot threads of the novel? </p>

"What is the source of Mr. Norrell's wealth?","<p>In <em>Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell</em>, the magician Norrell has cornered the market on magical books, which must have been a considerable expense. He also seems to have a considerable estate. How did he become so wealthy?</p>

<p>I believe that the character's motivation is driven by the British peerage, in which titles and wealth go to people who have done important things, but inherited without evincing such merit. Norrell isn't a peer of any kind, and is ridiculed when the idea of giving him a title comes up. Wealth and title don't always go together, but there often seems to be a tension between the titled class and those who earned their wealth. So where did Norrell's wealth come from?</p>

"What specifically is being described as stupid and old-fashioned in this passage on arranged marriage?","<p>I'm trying to rhetorically analyze a passage in Amy Tan's novel titled <em>The Joy Luck Club</em>, where a character, Lindo Jong, describes her experience with the arranged marriage process. I've included the passage below:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The matchmaker had bragged about me: ‘An earth horse for an earth sheep. This is the best marriage combination’… But even if I had known I was getting such a bad husband, I had no choice, now or later. We were always the last to give up stupid old-fashioned customs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm currently trying to analyze the negative diction and ambiguity of this passage. The negative diction can be seen with the words ""stupid"" and ""old-fashioned."" The ambiguity occurs with the word ""customs,"" as the reader doesn't know what exactly the customs Tan is criticizing are: are the customs society's suppression of a woman's voice, or society's reliance on astrological signs?</p>

<p>I'm not really sure what the rhetorical goal of this passage would be, and what the purpose of the ambiguity is. Any ideas?</p>

"Why does ""Watchmen"" use the 9-panel grid?","<p><em>Watchmen</em>, the 1986 comic written by Alan Moore and drawn/lettered by Dave Gibbons, is recogniseable (among other features) for the schematic of its comic pages - they all use the 9-panel grid:</p>

<li><p>What was the reason for it?</p>

<p>E.g. in <em>V for Vendetta</em> David Lloyd, the artist, decided not to have thought baloons or sounds. Just because. Alan Moore had to adapt to that.

While a rotating cast of artists is a known thing in comics, especially in <em>The Sandman</em> and the new <em>Lucifer</em> series (though not so much in Mike Carey's series), I didn't know of a series that would change the writer in the middle of the run, and especially in the middle of an arc. </p>

<p>I know some other comics do it, but I expected <em>Lucifer</em> to be held to a higher standard. <strong>What is the reason the writer was changed mid-series?</strong> Was it a pre-mediated decision, or was it because of a disagreement over the process (which seems unlikely since Black and Kadrey did an issue together)? </p>

"What happened to the epic poem?","<p>It's so strange to me that we all praised and adore things, but would never consider supporting them in a modern setting. There are many examples of this: poetry (very unpopular nowadays; not in the amount of it, but by the respectability of it), obscure, but interesting essays like A Hanging, by Orwell. But not least of these is the most impressive, which is the epic poem.</p>

<p>These epics, like the Illiad, the Divine Comedy, Paradise Lost, et al., are praised and taught almost as if they are a standard for incredible writing and story telling. </p>

<p>Clearly there must be some hidden meaning behind this. Blake's poems tend to have a lot of religious themes, either overt or in subtext, and it's quite implausible for one of the Songs of Experience to be just a description of nature. Also, I can't really see anything ""experience""-related in the surface meaning. Most of the <em>Songs of Experience</em> have something dark or threatening about them, but this seems very benign. Understanding the subtext would probably help me to understand its placement in this collection.</p>

"Why were Ellsworth Toohey and Peter Keating so afraid of the identity of Ellsworth Toohey's assailant?","<p>Shortly after he lost a commission on the Cosmo-Slotnick Building, sculpture Steven Mallory took a shot at Ellsworth Toohey as he was getting out of his car to deliver a radio address (which missed by an inch). Ellsworth Toohey took it very calmly, giving the address exactly as planned.</p>

<p>After finding out about the news, Peter Keating was initially worried about whether the newspaper would still be publishing Ellsworth Toohey's column the next day, which was to speak very flatteringly of him. Once he realized that Toohey wasn't dead, though, his reaction changed (especially upon learning the identity of the assailant):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Keating stared - his throat dry - at the name of the assailant. It was Steven Mallory.</p>
  
  <p>Only the inexplicable frightened Keating, particularly when the inexplicable lay, not in tangible facts, but in that causeless feeling of dread within him. There was nothing to concern him directly in what had happened, except his wish that it had been someone else, anyone but Steven Mallory; and that he didn't know why he should wish this.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When Toohey found out who it was:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When he heard the name, Toohey's glance remained fixed somewhere between the shoulder of one man and the hat brim of another. Then Toohey - who had stood calmly while a bullet struck an inch from his face against the glass of the entrance door below - uttered one word and the word seemed to fall at his feet, heavy with fear: <em>""Why?""</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mallory himself indicated that him and Toohey had never met in person, he knew none of Toohey's friends, and that he didn't think that Toohey had anything to do with him losing the commission (which was perfectly true). The main connection was that Toohey had criticized him in his column at one point.</p>

Kipling's poem <em>The White Man's Burden</em>.</p>

<blockquote>

"What are all the stories left unfinished in The Neverending Story?","<p>A recurring phrase in Michael Ende's <em>The Neverending Story</em>, often seen when some character or characters drop out of the story, is "".. but that's another story and shall be told another time"". I believe this is what's being referenced by Bastian, Atreyu, and Falkor near the very end:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""The Water asks you,"" Falkor translated, ""whether you completed all the stories you began in Fantastica.""</p>
  
  <p>""No,"" said Bastian. ""None of them really.""</p>

  <p>""In that case, it says, the white snake won't let you through. You must go back to Fantastica and finish them all.""</p>
  
  <p>""All the stories?"" Bastian stammered. ""Then I'll never be able to go back. Then it's all been for nothing.""</p>
  
  <p>Falkor listened eagerly.</p>
  
  <p>""What does it say?"" Bastian wanted to know.</p>

<p>Given the whole theme of the book - sucking readers into the story in order to continue it themselves - I think these unfinished tales are a very important thing for readers to appreciate and make note of.

  <p>""You doctors,"" continued Levinson, ""spend your efforts treating symptoms instead of causes. Because I am tired, I must go somewhere and rest; because I can't sleep, I must get out somewhere and exercise; because I have no appetite, I must go away from my business! Why don't you find why I am tired, and can't sleep or eat? I should run my business like that and in a year I'd be broke—machullah!"" </p>

<p>I only found it on a thread about favorite words (not poker related words) in a poker forum: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""I've always heard it pronounced gunef or even ganef and in my experience it's meaning is more angle-shooter than out and out crook although I have certainly heard it used in the context of a guy who's business went ""machullah"" or busto and had all of his property in his wife's name.""</p>

<p>So I guess it's something about bankruptcy? </p>

"How much of the Looters' philosophy did Fred Kinnan actually accept?","<p>Related: <a href=""https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/6019/what-was-fred-kinnan-gaining-from-his-racket"">What was Fred Kinnan gaining from his racket?</a></p>

<p>In their discussion of Directive 10-289, Fred Kinnan said the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Well, if you want to talk practice,"" said Fred Kinnan, ""then let me tell you that we can't worry about businessmen at a time like this. What we've got to think about is jobs. More jobs for the people. In my unions, every man who's working is feeding five who aren't, not counting his own pack of starving relatives. If you want my advice - oh, I know you won't go for it, but <strong>it's just a thought</strong> - - issue a directive making it compulsory to add, say, one-third more men to every payroll in the country.""<br>
  ""Good God!"" yelled Taggart. ""Are you crazy? We can barely meet our payrolls as it is! There's not enough work for the men we've got now! One-third more? We wouldn't have any use for them whatever!""<br>
  <strong>""Who cares whether you'd have any use for them?"" said Fred Kinnan. ""They need jobs. That's what comes first - <em>need</em> - doesn't it? - not your profits.""</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>A few things here: first, the formula ""it's just a thought"" is used quite regularly by looters who are afraid to take a firm stance on anything. This seems somewhat out of character for Fred Kinnan.</p>

<p>Secondly, is Fred Kinnan actually accepting part of the Looters' creed here? He doesn't seem to make any pretense of accepting their ideas later in the same meeting - for example, he openly admits that he's going along with Directive 10-289 because he's a racketeer, not because he thinks (or pretends) that he's acting in the public interest. How much of their philosophy does Fred Kinnan accept at this point?</p>

"What does the Malvolio subplot add to Twelfth Night?","<p>Most of Shakespeare's comedy <em>Twelfth Night</em> is about the group of main characters Viola, Sebastian, Orsino, and Olivia, and the affections requited and unrequited between them. But there's also a subplot surrounding Olivia's steward Malvolio and her other servants, which seems completely unrelated to the rest of the play. It adds more slapstick comedy to the play which might otherwise be rather more serious, but also has a dark element when Malvolio is imprisoned and tormented before vowing revenge on his tormentors.</p>

<p><strong>Why is this subplot part of the play? What does it add to the story?</strong> Are we just meant to laugh at the fooling around of the servants, or to be affected by Malvolio's pathos? Does it connect in some metaphorical or symbolic sense to the main plot?</p>

"Jungian archetypes in The Many Coloured Land","<p>Julian May's science fantasy book, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Many-Colored_Land"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>The Many-Colored Land</em></a>, tells the adventures of a disparate group of time travellers (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Many-Colored_Land#Group_Green"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Group Green</a>) who travel into the early Pleistocene Era. The characters are finely drawn, and seem to be almost archetypal in nature, rather than mere stereotypes. I have always wondered how well they correspond to Jungian (or other) archetypes. For example. Stein (a brawler if ever there was one) would correspond to the hero, Aiken Drum would correspond to the trickster, Sister Amery to the maiden, and Elizabeth Orme to the nurturing mother. Is this reasonable, or am I clutching at straws? Is there a better correspondence in literature?</p>

<p>Other characters in this book and the series (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saga_of_Pliocene_Exile"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>The Saga of the Exiles</em></a>) are up for grabs.</p>

<hr>

<blockquote>
  <h1>Group Green</h1>
  
  <h3>Elizabeth Orme</h3>
  
  <p>Elizabeth was a talented metapsychic practitioner on the human-colonised ski-resort planet Denali, but suffered severe injuries which resulted in the loss of her metapsychic abilities. Unable to cope with the trauma of this, she travelled to the Pliocene hoping to travel freely in a hot air balloon. But in an ironic twist, the shock of time travel caused her operant powers to return. The Tanu race regard her with awe as no other naturally operant metapsychics have come through the gate, and treat her as something of a celebrity. Elizabeth is a peace-loving redactor with little interest in politics, but her knowledge of advanced Milieu metapsychic techniques and her high level of metapsychic power make her an important player in the Tanu court, whether she likes it or not.</p>
  
  <h3>Aiken Drum</h3>
  
  <p>A persistent troublemaker, young Aiken Drum refused to be bent to the will of society. Offered the choice of incarceration, docilization or euthanasia, he instead chose Exile to the Pliocene. Always landing on his feet, his quick wits and schemes earned him respect from his fellow time travelers, and his latent metapsychic abilities earned him a silver torc from the Tanu. But a greater future lies ahead for this maverick Scot.</p>
  
  <h3>Felice Landry</h3>
  
  <p>Felice starts the book as a tremendously talented athlete, with superhuman strength and coercive power (in short-lived, weak control of others minds), but with barely submerged psychopathy. She chooses to go into Exile when she is banned from her sport after two other players accused her of deliberately hurting them. In Exile she discovers her powers are stronger than she had previously expected but refused to be taken by the Tanu. Later in the book, Felice joins the Lowlives helping them discover that 'Blood-Metal' (aka iron) can kill the 'Exotics'. She is determined to get a Gold Torc throughout the book, confident that it will make her powerful enough to take on the Tanu.</p>
  
  <h3>Richard Voorhees</h3>
  
  <p>Richard is an ex-spacer who came to Pliocene after being sued by an alien space crew who he refused to help whilst on a mission for a client. Richard tries to act tough throughout the book and often refuses to help other people, especially the Lowlives, but always comes through for them in the end. Richard is most notable in the book for killing the first Tanu to die in the book, in the process discovering iron to be a potent weapon against them. He also flies the aircraft at the end of the book, as the only one with enough experience to work out how.</p>
  
  <h3>Bryan Grenfell</h3>
  
  <p>Bryan works as an anthropologist in the Galactic Milieu but goes into Exile in pursuit of his love, Mercy. When he arrives in the Many Colored Land, he is regarded as special by the Tanu, who allow him to work bareneck, without a torc, while he is there. In the time where Bryan is the main view-point he often quotes ""There is a lady sweet and kind"" by Thomas Ford:</p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>There is a lady sweet and kind,<br>
    Was never face so pleas'd my mind;<br>
    I did but see her passing by,<br>
    And yet I love her till I die.</p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <h3>Stein Olsen</h3>
  
  <p>An ex-driller with psychological scars from the death of his mother. He is of immediate interest to the Tanu, who want him as a competitor in the ritual Great Combat due to his heroic physique. With the help of Elizabeth, he is mentally healed by the human woman Sukey, with whom he falls in love.</p>
  
  <h3>Annamaria Roccaro</h3>
  
  <p>A nun who develops complex relationships with Claude and Felice.</p>
  
  <h3>Claude Majewski</h3>
  
  <p>A retired, widowed palaeontologist, planning to see the 'fossil Zoo'.</p>

"Why is ""Oranges and Lemons"" supposed to describe child sacrifice?","<p>The popular nursery rhyme ""Oranges and Lemons"":</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Oranges and lemons,
  Say the bells of St. Clement’s.</p>
  
  <p>You owe me five farthings,
  Say the bells of St. Martin’s.</p>
  
  <p>When will you pay me?

  Say the bells of Shoreditch.</p>

  <p>I do not know,
  Says the great bell of Bow.</p>
  
  <p>Here comes a candle to light you to bed,
  And here comes a chopper to chop off your head!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Has apparently a darker meaning:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Various theories have been advanced to account for the rhyme, including: that it deals with child sacrifice; that it describes public executions; and that it describes Henry VIII’s marital difficulties. Problematically for these theories the last two lines, with their different metre, do not appear in the earlier recorded versions of the rhyme. 
  <sup> <a href=""https://anilbalan.com/2016/03/20/oranges-and-lemons/"" rel=""noreferrer"">source</a> </sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>While I can understand the public execution theory:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The gaol stood on the current site of the Old Bailey, next to St Sepulchre’s church (the bells of Old Bailey in the rhyme). The sound of that church’s “great” tenor bell striking 9am on a Monday morning would signal the start of any hangings due to take place that week. The prisoners on death row were visited the night before by the bell man of St Sepulchre, who would hold a candle in one hand and ring the execution bell in the other. 
  <sup>ibid</sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have problems understanding why this would suggest child sacrifice, something that would be abhorrent in XVII century Europe and probably not heard of since the fall of the pre-Columbian Aztec empire. </p>

  B) respectful yet admonishing.  </p>

<p>In my opinion, the tone is not admonishing which made me eliminate choice B. A is actually a correct answer choice, but I am a bit confused by the explanation to this question. In regard to the incorrect answer choice B, the explanation says that ""there is nothing respectful about [the poem].""<br>
However, as far as I understand, ""respectful"" and ""reverent"" are actually synonyms with ""reverent"" having a deeper, more intense, feeling of respect towards something.<br>
My question is: How can there be then ""nothing respectful about"" the poem if the tone is meditative and reverent?<br>

"Why did Ellsworth Toohey advise people against doing what they really wanted when he was a career advisor?","<p>Prior to his job on <em>The Banner</em>, Ellsworth Toohey spent awhile as a career advisor at a college. One of his distinctive traits as a career advisor was that he usually advised people against doing what they really wanted to do, which directly lead to at least one person's eventual suicide:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>People noticed that Ellsworth Toohey seldom let a boy pursue the career he had chosen. ""No, I wouldn't go for law if I were you. You're much too tense and passionate about it. A hysterical devotion to one's career does not make for happiness or success. It is wiser to select a profession about which you can be calm, sane and matter-of-fact. Yes, even if you hate it. It makes for down-to-earthness.""...</p>
  
  <p>After leaving college some of his proteges did quite well, others failed. Only one committed suicide. It was said that Ellsworth Toohey had exercised a beneficent influence upon them - for they never forgot him: they came to consult him on many things, years later, they wrote him, they clung to him. They were like machines without a self-starter, that had to be cranked up by an outside hand. He was never too busy to give him his full attention.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We already know from elsewhere in the book that Elsworth Toohey is actually power-hungry, narcissistic, and sociopathic (hence, for example, his attempted takeover of <em>The Banner</em>'s editorial policy). But why this? Is it just for the pleasure of having power over them?</p>

<p>However, the 1623 ban is tagged ""citation needed"", so the exact nature of that ban is unclear. Was it simply a ban on swearing <em>anywhere</em> or did it also mention the theatre or literature generally. The wording ""general ban"" suggest that it does not focus on the theatre or literature, but a citation is needed to verify that claim.

  Babes reduced to misery,<br>
  Fed with cold and usurious hand.</p>
  
  <p>Is that trembling cry a song?<br>
  Can it be a song of joy?<br>
  And so
  many children poor?<br>
  It is a land of poverty!</p>
  
  <p>And their sun does never shine,<br>
  And their fields are bleak and
  bare,<br>
  And their ways are filled with thorns;<br>
  It is eternal
  winter there.</p>
  
  <p>For where-e’er the sun does shine,<br>
  And where-e’er the rain does
  fall,<br>
  Babe can never hunger there,<br>
  Nor poverty the mind appall.</p>

<p>In a practice test on the SAT Literature Subject exam, I found a question about the last stanza specifically:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the final stanza, what does Blake appeal to in his readers?<br>
  I.
  Their emotions<br>
  II. Their faith<br>
  III. Their reason<br>
  (A) I only<br>

  (C) III only<br>
  (D) I and III<br>

</blockquote>

<p>The only choice I am completely sure about here is III because it seems logical to have enough food in the place where ""the sun does shine"" and ""the rain does fall"" which is not the case in the reality. Also, I can agree with the choice I since the reader can feel pity for those in the poem who lived in poverty and hunger.<br>
However, I can't find a reason why the choice II may be correct. It is understandable that the poem itself does touch the subject of faith, but does Blake appeal to it in the last stanza specifically?<br>
Here is the test explanation for this question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>First, decide which of the Roman numeral item(s) is or are correct.
  Blake appeals to his readers’ emotions, so item I is correct. Although
  there is no mention in the stanza of religion, God, or faith, item II,
  the title “Holy Thursday” implies a religious context, making item II
  also correct. Blake does call on his readers’ reason, so item III
  should be included in the answer. Choice (E), which includes items I,
  II, and III, is the correct answer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here, I couldn't find how Blake appeals to faith in the <strong>last</strong> stanza. Please explain whether the subject of faith is maybe implied in the final stanza or influences it indirectly.</p>

"What is the literary effect of dropping articles from titles?","<p>Quite a few novels and films have titles which, if they appeared as phrases in everyday speech or writing, would normally have to be preceded by an article or other determiner. Some examples: <strong><em>Animal Farm, Little House on the Prairie,</em></strong> and <strong><em>Tropic of Cancer</em></strong> among novels, and <strong><em>Easy Rider, Taxi Driver,</em></strong> and <strong><em>Rear Window</em></strong> among films.</p>

<h1>My question</h1>

<p>My question is this: what artistic or literary effect does the omission of the leading determiner have in my six examples? Or, equivalently: why might an author prefer the above-cited versions of the titles over, say, <em>An/The Animal Farm, A/The Little House on the Prairie, The Tropic of Cancer, The Easy Rider, The Taxi Driver,</em> and <em>The/A Rear Window</em>?</p>

<p>I doubt it's the same reason (or group of reasons) in all cases. For example, in the answer which I posted below, I argue that the reasons for dropping the article from <em>Easy Rider</em> are unlikely to apply to <em>Little House on the Prairie.</em> This is why I think one needs to consider a number of examples before any patterns start to emerge.</p>

<p><strong>A bit of grammar</strong></p>

<p>Let's temporarily treat each of my six titles not as the name of a novel or film but as just a bit of regular text, a ‘word group’, and let's see how it behaves when we try to form complete sentences with it. We will soon notice two things.</p>

<p>First, we are normally forced to add another word in front of our word group, e.g. <strong><em>my</strong> little house on the prairie was a good place to grow up</em> and <em>next they saw <strong>an</strong> animal farm.</em> Words that will work (which we'll called <strong>determiners</strong>) include (1) the possessives such as <em>my</em> and <em>Alice's</em>, and (2) the <strong>determinatives,</strong> which include the articles <em>a</em> and <em>the</em> as well as words such as <em>some, this, that, each,</em> and <em>every.</em> </p>

<p>Second, the grammatical behavior of our word group is inherited from one of its nouns (<em>farm, house, tropic, rider, driver,</em> and <em>window</em>), which is therefore called its <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_(linguistics)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><strong>head</strong></a>. By ‘grammatical behavior’ I mean facts like these: once we add a determiner, the word group can function as the subject of the sentence, the object of a transitive verb, etc.; when it is the subject, we must have subject-verb agreement; and so on. We say that adding the determiner to our word group turns it into a <strong>noun phrase</strong> (NP).</p>

<p>A word group whose head is a noun but which has no determiner is often called a <strong>nominal</strong> or sometimes a <a href=""http://linguistics.oxfordre.com/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780199384655.001.0001/acrefore-9780199384655-e-399"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><strong>bare nominal</strong></a>. Some nominals can be acceptable even without adding a determiner, in which case they are called <strong>bare NPs</strong> and are often described as carrying the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_(grammar)#Zero_article"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><strong>zero article</strong></a> or sometimes the <a href=""https://escholarship.org/content/qt2kb4p9r0/qt2kb4p9r0.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><strong>null article</strong></a>. </p>

<p>The reason our titles (when viewed as just text) normally require a determiner is that their head nouns are all <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Count_noun"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><strong>count</strong> nouns</a> in the singular. (Count nouns are also called <strong>countable</strong> nouns.) Normally, a nominal can escape the requirement of having a determiner only if its head noun is one of the following: (1) a proper name, (2) a count noun in the plural (<strong><em>houses</strong> on the hill</em>), or (3) an <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_noun"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><strong>uncount noun</strong></a> (also called <strong>a mass noun, uncountable noun,</strong> or <strong>non-count noun</strong>—e.g. <em>deep blue <strong>water</em></strong>). </p>

<p>English wouldn't be English if there weren't any exceptions, and indeed there are some rare exceptions to what I just said, see <a href=""https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/280998/he-was-neither-seer-nor-prophet-how-would-you-explain-the-absence-of-an-articl/281105#281105"">here</a>. None of them apply to our titles, however.</p>

<p><strong>Ambiguities: those I excluded, and those that could help</strong></p>

<p>The problem, to repeat, is to explain what is the literary effect of having a normally unacceptable nominal be the title—or, equivalently, what reason an author might have for choosing such a title.</p>

<p>I have picked my particular examples in part because they cannot be explained by pointing out that the lack of an article makes for an interesting ambiguity as far as whether the word is really a noun, or rather an adjective (as in <em>Alien</em>) or a verb (as in <em>Network</em>).<sup>1</sup> </p>

<p><sup><sup>1</sup>True, <em>farm</em> and <em>house</em> are also verbs, and <em>tropic</em> is also an adjective. But in my examples, other words make it clear that they are used as nouns there.</sup></p>

<p>I suppose there could be cases where the ambiguity that's being played on is that between the countable and uncountable readings of the head noun. I don't think that's the case in my examples; I don't think any of the head nouns in my examples have any uncount meanings at all (at least not any relevant meanings; <em>house</em> does have one uncount meaning, that of a style of dance music). </p>

<p>Further, I think my six examples also can't be explained by postulating a non-standard usage for the head noun, in which a normally count noun is to be interpreted as an uncount one. That explanation <strong>might</strong> be viable with some other titles,<sup>2</sup> but I don't think it's a believable one with my six examples.</p>

<p><sup><sup>2</sup>I am purposefully not going to give possible examples that come to my mind, so as to not encourage straying off topic.</sup></p>

<p>One kind of ambiguity that does seem possible is that between the indefinite and definite readings of the noun group. This could be relevant to some of my examples (though I don't think it could apply to all of them); in my answer below, I explore this kind of ambiguity in the case of <em>Easy Rider.</em></p>

<p>Finally, there could be an ambiguity in the grammatical number, i.e. in whether the noun group has a singular or a plural meaning. This is a bit of a stretch in my examples, in which all the head nouns have plurals that are not base plurals (i.e. whose form is not identical with the singular). Nevertheless, I will briefly explore this possibility on the example of <em>Easy Rider.</em></p>

<p>I'm sure that titles of some dramas and even of some operas also fall within the scope of my question. However, for definiteness, unless there is a particularly compelling reason, let us please stick to titles of novels and movies. </p>

<h1>What I am <em>not</em> asking</h1>

<p>Let me stress from the outset that this is <strong>not</strong> a grammar question. Coming up with the title of a work of art is itself a creative process, for the title can influence the reading of the rest of the work. </p>

<p>Also, this is <strong>not</strong> a question about <strong>headlines</strong> and the writing style used in them, which is sometimes called <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headlinese"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">'headlinese'</a>. Although the topic of headlinese <strong>might</strong> be somewhat related to my question, it is still true that newspaper/magazine/blog post/etc. articles are not normally taken to be pieces of artistic literature (unless they explicitly are, as when a magazine publishes a short story; that case, of course, is fair game). In headlines, the main consideration is that of saving space. In contrast, while titles of novels and films are usually relatively short (although see <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/22/movies/22titles.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>), it seems to me that this is primarily for aesthetic reasons, not pragmatic ones. Moreover, headlinese has many other features, besides the dropping of articles, which are not shared by titles of novels and films. Some examples of these are (1) the preference for the simple present tense (e.g. <em>Governor signs bill</em>), (2) the extensive use of abbreviations and metonymy (e.g. <em>Wall Street</em> for <em>the financial industry</em>), (3) the absence of honorifics before names of individuals, and (4) the preference for short words which are only much more rarely used in normal speech and writing in that meaning (e.g. <em>bid</em> for 'attempt', <em>see</em> for 'forecast', and <em>tap</em> for 'select an appointee'). In short, it cannot be said that titles of novels and films—even those where articles are dropped— are written in headlinese.</p>

<p>Similar comments apply to any connection to the language of signs and notices.</p>

<p>I am <strong>not</strong> asking about titles of <strong>poems.</strong> Poetic language presents a whole other level of complication which I don't want to get into. I admit that some titles of movies and novels could be taken as being poetic, but I also think that this is not a fair thing to say about e.g. <em>Rear Window</em> or <em>Taxi Driver.</em> </p>

<p>I take song lyrics to be a species of poem, and so I don't want to consider titles of songs, either. </p>

<p>Titles of <strong>visual works of art,</strong> especially the more abstract and conceptual art, are also often too far removed from ordinary speech and writing to be useful for the purposes of my question. However, visual art of earlier epochs is probably fair game, as is art that is more in line with the traditions of earlier epochs, and which is often more <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Figurative_art"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">figurative</a>. Indeed, I've found <a href=""https://forum.wordreference.com/threads/usage-of-articles-in-the-titles-of-paintings.2445231/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">a relevant discussion in that context</a>. In the summary of the research I've done so far, I will present what seems to me the most interesting part of that discussion (<em>Japanese Vase</em> vs. <em>A Japanese Vase</em> vs. <em>The Japanese Vase</em>).</p>

<p>I am <strong>not</strong> asking about <strong>band names</strong> (i.e. the names of rock/pop/rap/etc. music groups)</p>

<p>And I am also <strong>not</strong> asking about <strong>brand names.</strong></p>

<p>Grammar Girl has an interesting discussion of article use in both band and brand names <a href=""https://www.quickanddirtytips.com/education/grammar/why-some-band-names-take-the-and-others-dont"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">(here)</a>, but in the end, her conclusions are not relevant to my question. I will explain why in the summary of the research I've done.</p>

<p>I am <strong>not</strong> asking about the names of ships, trains, and the like (see <a href=""https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/169970/why-does-english-use-definite-articles-before-certain-proper-nouns-such-as-the"">here</a> and <a href=""https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/136954/when-to-use-a-definite-article-in-the-name-of-a-ship"">here</a>). That context is simply too different from my question. Similarly, I am <strong>not</strong> asking about the names of lakes, mountains, and the like. And I'm not asking about <a href=""https://ell.stackexchange.com/questions/171462/why-is-the-added-before-wasp-but-not-before-antman/171472#171472"">the names of superheroes</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We cannot, to begin with, divorce this book from the specific social
  climate of that time; it was one of the last of all through the
  thirties, dealing with the inequities of the social structure of
  America.  It was published one year before our entry into the last
  world war–which is to say, very few years after the dissolution of the
  WPA and the end of the New Deal and at time when bread lines and soup
  kitchens and bloody industrial battles were bright in everyone’s
  memory.  The rigors of that unexpected time filled us not only with a
  genuinely bewildered and despairing idealism–so that, because there at
  least was something to fight for, young men went off to die in
  Spain–but also with a genuinely bewildered self-consciousness.  <strong>The</strong>
  <strong>Negro, who had been during the magnificent twenties a passionate and</strong>
  <strong>delightful primitive, now became, as one of the things we were most</strong>
  <strong>self-conscious about, our most oppressed minority.</strong> In the thirties,
  swallowing Marx whole, we discovered the Worker and realized–I should
  think with some relief–that the aims of the Worker and the aims of the
  Negro were one.  This theorem to which we shall return–seems now to
  leave rather too much out of account; it became, nevertheless, one of
  the slogans of the “class struggle” and the gospel of the New Negro.</p>

<p>All the characters in the books were animals that could talk and there were different stories about each one of them. </p>

<p>I think the cover, when you open both sides would be the whole jungle with a pond(or lake) in the middle where some would fish, other would just climb the trees and other animals would just sit nearby.</p>

"What does this paragraph of ""An Equal Music"" by Vikram Seth mean?","<p>I'm (re-)reading ""An Equal Music"" by Vikram Seth and encountered the following paragraph which I do not understand.</p>

<p>For context, the book is written in first person perspective (although that isn't apparent in the quoted portion), the main character (Michael) is a violinist and at this point in the book the love of his life (Julia) has just left Venice to go home to her husband. Michael stays in Venice (since he is on tour with his string quartet).</p>

<p>Here is the passage I'm having trouble with, I marked the specific words and phrases I do not understand in cursive:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>A walk</em> at the end of the world, the earthquake plate, alone; the
  <em>mudflats of subsidence and flood</em>, and the hermitage of the one who
  found the true cross. Then in the city on the day of the earthquake
  was born the weak priest whose writings were dispersed, coming through
  hands and hands to the library of the curved wall. There they lay <em>till
  ecstasy rose unheard to the crowning angels and the dove</em>. <em>If we were
  dolphins, what would we play?</em> If we had four hands would Bach's mind
  have further branched? Let our thumbs be opposable at the opposite
  edge. Let our teeth be pulled, let us have baleen like whales, that
  our plankton love might grow, that we might ungnashing plash and play.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are three points I have trouble with:</p>

<ul>
<li>Saint Helena (of Constatinople) is the one who (allegedly) found the true cross, and there is a chapel dedicated to her in the outskirts of Venice (a city plagued by earthquakes), which Michael and Julia have visited. However, who goes on this walk alone? Initially I thought it would be Michael revisiting places they went to together alone but since the next sentence starts with ""then"", it seems the walk has to precede the birth of the weak priest (1678) while the story is set in the present. Also, I don't understand what the mudflats of subsidence and flood are supposed to be.</li>
</ul>

<p>For context to the next phrase I'm having trouble with, an explanation of the weak priest: the composer Antonio Vivaldi (1678 - 1741) was born in Venice, (allegedly) during an earthquake, became a priest and had terrible health. He wrote a piece Michael and Julia played together which is part of  a set (now called the Manchester Sonatas) discovered only relatively recently (very recently when the book was written) in the Manchester city library (where Michael has spent time earlier in the book) which, according to Google Images, is a round building (so there is only one outside wall, in the obviously curved shape of a circle).</p>

<ul>
<li>Apparently the discovery of the Manchester Sonatas coincided with the rising of ecstasy – I don't have a clue. Neither do I know whether they lay unheard (which is obviously true, since, having been forgotten, they weren't played until their discovery) or whether ecstasy rose unheard (which makes no sense to me but the word order seems to indicate this). Who are the crowning angels? And does the dove symbolise the Holy Spirit? The idea of music being written and played <em>soli deo gloria</em> was common in Vivaldi's time, but in the present music isn't regarded in this way anymore.</li>
<li>What comes next might seem bizarre but Michael wouldn't be the first to wonder what composers would have composed if circumstances had been different. Though usually the question is what a composer had written if they had been born in a different time (usually later), what would change if humans had had a different physiology is not so farfetched. But what does this have to do with the rest of the paragraph? My best guess is that this wishing for different music for a different human condition somehow relates to him wishing for different circumstances in which he could be with Julia (an important motif in the book is them playing together) but I'm not exactly convinced of this interpretation.</li>

<p>But while the term ""havekar"" is explained to be, within the story, a sloppy transliteration of a (supposedly fictional) elven word, the text seems to suggest that it has, or at least points to, a real meaning in human language, too:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Money ruled the world, and demand created supply. The Scoia'tael roaming the woods piled up huge loot, for which they had no use, though. But they lacked in gear and weapons. This way a flying trade arose in the woods. And a kind of humans who catered to that trade. On the forest paths, glades and aisles quietly and secretly the carts of the speculators appeared, who did business with the squirrels. The elves called them <em>hav'caaren</em>, an untranslatable word, but in which ringed predatory greed. Among the humans the term ""havekar"" vernacularized, and that reminded of an even more detestable word. For it were detestable people. Cruel and ruthless they didn't shy away from anything, not even murder. A havekar caught by the army couldn't count on mercy. The same as he himself didn't use to be merciful. If he encountered someone who could reveal him to the soldiers, he reached for crossbow or knife without hesitation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But it's unclear to me <strong>what ""even more detestable word"" Sapkowski is alluding to here</strong> (which might extratextually have in turn inspired the elven word). This is made especially difficult since I didn't read the Polish original but its German translation (and thus the above excerpt has actually been translated into English by me from Erik Simon's official German translation). So it might very well be that the allusion got itself lost in translation and refers to a Polish word that doesn't actually fit to ""havekar"" in German. Alternatively, ""havekar"" might itself have been translated from Polish in order to make sense in the translation, a sense I'm nevertheless still missing.</p>

<p>So <strong>what real word is he hinting at here that the ostensible transliteration ""havekar"" is supposed to remind us of?</strong> Does this only make sense in Polish? Or does it maybe not even make sense in the original and is itself an empty allusion for the sheer sake of worldbuilding through incomplete knowledge?</p>

It is my understanding that this poem is about the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty_Tree"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Liberty Tree</a> that was located in Boston where the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sons_of_Liberty"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Sons of Liberty</a> met in order to plan (it died in 1923, and is now memorialized by a statue).</p>

<p>Specifically this stanza:</p>

  <p>In a chariot of light, from the regions of the day,<br>
  The Goddess of Liberty came,<br>
  Ten thousand celestials directed her way,<br>
  And hither conducted the dame.<br>
  A fair budding branch from the gardens above,<br>

  She brought in her hand as a pledge of her love,<br>

<p>Because in the middle he says that he has to finish the story quickly to help his 6-month pregnant wife, but in the last paragraph he says that he feels like being in a cage, and doesn't want to speak or touch her!?</p>

"Why does Mr Darcy immediately suspect Mrs Gardiner of telling Elizabeth of his hand in marrying Lydia?","<blockquote>
  <p>Now was the moment for her resolution to be executed, and, while her courage was high, she immediately said, 'Mr Darcy, I am a very selfish creature; and, for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings, care not how much I may be wounding yours. I can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor sister. Ever since I have known it, I have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully I feel it. Were it known  to the rest of my family, I should not have merely my own gratitude to express.'<br>
  'I am sorry, exceedingly sorry,' replied Darcy,  in the tone of surprise and emotion, 'that you have ever been informed of what may, in a mistaken light, have given you uneasiness. <strong>I did not think Mrs Gardiner was so little to be trusted</strong>.'<br>
  'You must not blame my aunt. Lydia's thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned with the matter; and, of course, I could not rest till I knew the particulars.<br>
  <sub>Volume 3, Chapter 16</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>As far as I can make out, a few people knew Mr Darcy was involved with Mr Wickham/Lydia affair:</p>

<ul>
<li>Mr Gardiner</li>
<li>Mrs Gardiner</li>
<li>The Gardiner children</li>
<li>Lydia</li>
<li>Mr Wickham</li>
</ul>

<p>Given that Mr Darcy knew what a thoughtless person Lydia was, why did he not suspect her?</p>

<p>I assume he would have known the embargo Mr Wickham placed on his new wife,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>'...But gracious me! I quite forgot! I ought not to have said a word about it. I promised <strong>them</strong> so faithfully! What will Wickham say? It was to be such a secret!'<br>
  <sub>Volume 3, Chapter 9</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>But did Darcy think such a promise would stand with Lydia, and it was merely a gentleman's agreement for discretion between himself and the Gardiners that he thinks Mrs Gardiner broke?</p>

<p>Is this an example of sexism/the titular prejudice on Mr Darcy's part, or does he consider the closeness between Elizabeth and Mrs Gardiner as the reason for her suspected divulgence? </p>

"What is the significance of the black void in ""The Dancer on the Stairs""?","<p>Sarah Tolmie's novelette <a href=""http://strangehorizons.com/fiction/the-dancer-on-the-stairs/""><em>The Dancer on the Stairs</em></a> is a kind of portal fantasy, with the protagonist whisked away from our world into a strange fantastical one -- except the place she is whisked to is a guarded stairway, where she depends on charity and desperation to survive, and can get out only by growing to learn the strange culture, and forge a meaningful bond with another.</p>

<p>At the story's conclusion, long after she has escaped, the protagonist is in an unexpected position of responsibility -- orchestrating the enigmatic coronation dance. And here, at the climax of the dance several strange things happen - a break from the culture's fundamental order; a miraculous signal; and also, this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is over. But not for me. There is no more rising effervescence, but a terrible black suction into an upward void, pulling pulling pulling. I scream and hold on to Yestril and to the railing, clutching the stone, every cell protesting movement upward, movement away.</p>
  
  <p>The pull ceases, and I fall down.</p>
  
  <p>A murmur passes through the crowd below, an outcry. Four members of the royal family, in their octagonal enclosure, are gone. There are tears, complaints, railing. But there will not be any serious attempt to explain it. Soon enough this will be one of the things that ""do not command attention"" or ""do not happen among us.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This phenomenon is brief and sudden, and obviously important to the story, but I do not understand it.</p>

<p><strong>What does it mean? Where are they being pulled? And why is it some people, and not others?</strong></p>

<p>This feels like it might tie in the protagonist's arriving in the first place, from another world. And as for explaining that, the hint we have is Yestril's conjecture:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""But then how,"" I continued, ""did I end up there?""</p>
  
  <p>He looked at me in puzzlement. ""I don't know,"" I remember him saying, ""Perhaps you, also, were too much bound?""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or perhaps it's to do with the climax of the coronation, which is a (temporary) breakdown of the sigil-groups, and this is somehow an extension of that sudden, shocking intermingling and universality. </p>

<p>But I'm not seeing a clear connection between the sudden void and either of those avenues. So I feel like I'm missing a key piece.</p>

<p>This is a deeply thematic story, so I expect the significance here is more a matter of understanding the theme, than it is of finding a logical, in-world explanation supported by the text -- but I might be wrong about that too.</p>

"Are there recorded instances of asexuality in the body of ancient Greek writings?","<p>I've been reading through a fraction of Ancient Greek literature, lately, and an odd thought occurred to me. In nearly every work of Greek literature that is tangentially related to sexuality (which, we've gotta admit, is quite nearly most of the well-known ones), sex is treated as universally desirable, and is a locus of control and power. Most of the discussion around women in Greek culture seems to revolve solely around sexuality.  </p>

<p>As another example, Eros is often referred to as being one of those omnipresent entities in male interactions in Greek culture. <em>The Symposium</em> goes into some manner of detail on this point about Eros, describing maleness and sexuality as effectively identical concepts with no real distinguishing factors. Still, beyond this, many of the Greek gods are described as sexually promiscuous. No emphasis seems to be placed in any writings on the <em>absence</em> of sexuality in the Greek gods. </p>

<p>Here, I mean asexuality to be the total absence of sexual attraction, with anyone. This is <a href=""http://www.asexualityarchive.com/asexuality-and-celibacy-whats-the-difference/"">a concept</a> distinct from both celibacy (not having sex for a particular reason) and abstinence (not having sex by choice). For example: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Dionysius is, based on what I've read, <em>abstinent</em> due to indifference to sexuality. There doesn't seem to be anything to suggest that Dionysius doesn't experience sexual attraction, irrespective of whether he partakes in it.</p></li>
<li><p>Artemis would count as an example of <em>celibacy</em>, because she's a sworn virgin. (Note: ""virgin"" means ""no sexual relations with <em>men</em>"" in ancient Greek works. There's some discussion about whether Artemis was <em>lesbian</em>, but either way, not asexual.) </p></li>
<li><p>While there isn't a whole lot of evidence either way, the speculation I've read about whether Athena had sex with anyone seems to have trouble differentiating between Athena as an asexual figure or an abstinent one. (This might make it hard to demonstrate asexuality through the <em>absence</em> of sexual writings.)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The quintessential example, the way ""asexuality"" is used nowadays, would be if someone in some situation were to turn down a sexual situation - <em>not</em> because they didn't want to have sex with them, but rather because they just didn't feel like having sex, as a whole, with anyone. </p>

<p><strong>Did asexuality as a concept ever appear in Greek writings?</strong> If so, is there both asexuality in the Pantheon and asexuality outside of it, or is it just one of the two? I don't expect that the ancient Greeks shared our modern conception of asexuality to a T; however, if it's possible to identify that ancient Greek writings reflect an idea of asexuality comparable to our modern one, that would probably count as an example. </p>

It&#39;s a commodity I&#39;m short on, but yours did well enough. When you wished it gone, it had no choice but to destroy itself. By the way, you&#39;ll be needing this.&quot;""></a><br>
<sub> Click for full resolution. </sub></p>

<p>At that point Lucifer has his hidden agenda, namely getting the Letter of Passage from Yahweh - he wouldn't go to all the trouble of fighting the Velleity otherwise. </p>

<p>Getting the Letter serves other means - breaking free of Yahweh's Creation, and of his omniscience and omnipresence. This is what Lucifer wants, or <em>desires</em> (as explained later, from the start of creation) - he doesn't show interest in anything else, and everything he does in the <em>Lucifer</em> comics series is for that one goal.</p>

<p>This was also acknowledged in the last issue of the series:</p>

"When did men dressed as women stop being the norm in English theatre?","<p><a href=""https://literature.stackexchange.com/a/2513/17"">This excellent answer</a> by Joshua Engel draws a comparison between men dressed as women in Shakespeare-era plays and perspective jumps in modern cinema:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The audience would, of course, have been aware that these characters were portrayed by boys. [...] It worked only because the audience was fully imbued in the trope, and simply accepted it. I think of it as similar to the effect of intercutting in modern cinema: the world doesn't jump perspectives like that, but since you've been trained to accept that as the language of cinema, it doesn't give you even a moment's pause. It's not so much ""suspension of disbelief"" as genuine belief: that's the way this world works.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which made me wonder: when did this <em>stop</em> being the norm? In Shakespeare's day, there were no women actors, and all the female characters were portrayed by men, but of course this is no longer the case today. <strong>When did women in plays start being portrayed by actual women?</strong> For that matter, was the change sudden (perhaps due to a change in law) or was there a more gradual shift?</p>

<p><sub>If a fully multicultural and international answer to this would be too broad, then it's OK to restrict answers to <strong>English</strong> theatre, which has had (as far as I know) a continuous history between Shakespeare's time and the present day.</sub></p>

<p><em>Hard to Be a God</em> is a Russian science fiction novel by Arkady and Boris Strugatsky set in the future. Some of the historical references in it are set in our future, but some reference things in our past.</p>

"What exactly was Shadow's crime, and what was Laura's part in it?","<p><sub> There may or may not be unhidden spoilers from the novel here. </sub></p>

<p>While watching the fourth episode of <em>American Gods</em>, where Laura and Shadow's mutual history has been revealed (to be the <a href=""https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2017/05/theamerican-godstv-series-fixes-one-of-the-books-biggest-problems/"" rel=""noreferrer"">first major deviation from the novel</a>), I noticed that the novel didn't explain what exactly it was Shadow did to get in prison, and what part Laura had in it.</p>

<p>Firstly, there is this exchange where it is shown that Laura asked Shadow to do something:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“How was prison?”</p>
  
  <p>“Could have been worse.”</p>
  
  <p>“Yes.” The tip of the cigarette glowed orange. “I’m still grateful. I should never have got you mixed up in it.”</p>
  
  <p>“Well,” he said, “I agreed to do it. I could have said no.”<br>
  <sub> Author's preferred text, chapter 3. </sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then there is this blurb where it is explained that Laura organised a robbery (?) because she was cheated by her associates (?) and Shadow was the driver (?):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>He hurried on, pushed through the warden’s gray office, and found himself looking at the VCR repair store on the outskirts of Eagle Point. Three years ago. Yes.</p>
  
  <p>Inside the store, he knew, he was beating the living crap out of Larry Powers and B. J. West, bruising his knuckles in the process: pretty soon he would walk out of there, carrying a brown supermarket bag filled with twenty-dollar bills. The money they could never prove he had taken: <strong>his share of the proceeds, and a little more, for they shouldn’t have tried to rip him and Laura off like that. He was only the driver, but he had done his part, done everything that she had asked of him…</strong></p>

"Are the new gods not aware of the appearance of this character?","<p><sub> <strong>There will be very heavy spoilers - do not read further if you haven't finished the novel.</strong> </sub></p>

<p>Mr. World is the leader of the new gods, though his exact area of influence is left somewhat ambiguous in the novel. This may be an intentional decision, because </p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Mr. World is in fact Loki, and also Shadow's old cell mate, Low Key Lyesmith.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>His appearance is somewhat distinctive:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Low Key, who was a grifter from Minnesota, <strong>smiled his scarred smile</strong>.</p>
  
  <p>[. . .]</p>
  
  <p>“How the hell should I know?” Lyesmith kept his <strong>orange-blond hair pretty much shaved</strong>. You could see the lines of his skull. “Tell you what, though. This country started going to hell when they stopped hanging folks. No gallows dirt. No gallows deals.”<br>
  <sub> Author's preferred text, chapter 1; emphasis mine. </sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The hair colour may be irrelevant, but combined with the scars on his face, which are faithful to a legend where his mouth was sewn shut after <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loki#Archaeological_record"" rel=""noreferrer"">some incident</a> or <a href=""http://americangods.wikia.com/wiki/Low_Key_Lyesmith"" rel=""noreferrer"">the other</a>, I claim for this question that his appearance is very distinctive and recognisable.</p>

<p>There is also reason to believe that Loki had the same appearance when in his role as Mr. World:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>He smiled then, <strong>his scarred smile</strong>. Mr. World was easily amused. Mr. Town had noticed this on several occasions. It had amused him to play chauffeur, in Kansas, after all.<br>
  <sub> Ibid, chapter 17; emphasis mine. </sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now for my question - <strong>don't the new gods recognise that Mr. World is Loki</strong>? I realise this piece of trivia is not very well-known, especially with him being portrayed by <a href=""https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/4383054-1630125576-39430.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer"">such</a> handsome <a href=""https://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/americangods/images/e/e9/Jonathan_tucker_low_key_lyesmith.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20170418202057"" rel=""noreferrer"">actors</a> lately, but surely the new gods have done their homeworks (with one of them literally being the god of wireless communication and all that) and must know the appearance of all the old gods (""know your enemy and <strong>know your ally</strong>"" and all that).</p>

<p>Two questions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Don't the new gods know that Mr. World is Loki, based on his appearance?</p></li>
<li><p>If they do, why on Earth would they accept him as their leader? Even if one factors in him being a Norse god and <em>maybe</em> having some sort of information about the enemy camp, he is <em>the Trickster God</em> - they should know this sword is of two ends.</p></li>

"Are Vin and Elend symbolically linked to Preservation and Ruin in The Hero of Ages?","<p>In Brandon Sanderson's <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mistborn:_The_Hero_of_Ages"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>The Hero of Ages</em></a> (book three of the <em><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mistborn_series"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Mistborn</a></em> trilogy), Preservation and Ruin are two anthropomorphized forces of nature, evenly matched in their struggle against one another.</p>

<p>These two forces are represented throughout the books by the colors white, for Preservation, and black, for Ruin. The mists are of Preservation, and are white. The ash is of Ruin, and is black -- really dark black, not the usual ash color (see, for example, the excerpt from Sazed's book at the beginning of chapter 19: ""Yes, the ash was black. No, it should not have been. [...] Perhaps it was the influence of Ruin's power [...]""). More explicitly, in the final chapter:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The twists of mist he saw, they led to a vast white light.</p>
  
  <p>He reached out and touched the mist, and felt an awesome power. A
  power of stability. To the side, the other corpse -- the one he didn't
  recognize -- was also leaking something. A deep black smoke. Sazed
  reached out with his other hand, touching the smoke, and felt a
  different power -- more violent. The power of change.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These powers are not <a href=""https://literature.stackexchange.com/q/672/481"">good and evil</a> -- Ruin is something of an entropic force, and Preservation is the anti-entropic force. This distinction appears to be very important to Ruin -- he tries to explain this to Vin more than once. For example, in chapter 57:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Vin, Vin. <em>Why</em> can't you see? This isn't about good or evil. Morality
  doesn't even enter into it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Throughout the entire series, Vin wears black, as it's a good color for sneaking at night, as Mistborn are wont to do. At the end of the second book, <s>King</s> Emperor Elend Venture is encouraged to wear white, which improves his image, making him stand out in a world covered by ash. This pairing of colors isn't really emphasized much throughout the book, except for one scene, in which Emperor and Empress crash a ball in a city they have recently placed under siege.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This wasn't an evening for subtlety.</p>
  
  <p>[grand entrance, billowing white cape]</p>
  
  <p>Inside the antechamber, waiting nobility began to whisper and
  question. Vin heard them asking if anyone recognized these strange
  newcomers, one in black, the other in white.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, the stress of the contrasting colors in this passage may only serve to reinforce to the readers that this couple doesn't really belong in that room, by flaunting their nonconformity to societal fashion. Later in the same chapter (30), a short while after the dramatic entrance, we're told that the ""men generally wore dark clothing, and the women generally wore colors.""</p>

<p>The royal couple are also shown, standing side by side, in white and black on the book's cover (at least, for the edition that I was reading):</p>

The first stanza mentions (King) David by name, and the first three lines of the second seem to refer to one of King David's stories (<a href=""http://www.sefaria.org/II_Samuel.11?lang=bi"" rel=""noreferrer"">II Samuel 11</a>). The fourth line, I believe, switches to a story of Samson (<a href=""http://www.sefaria.org/Judges.16.4?lang=bi"" rel=""noreferrer"">Judges 16</a>), and the fifth has elements of both David and Samson in it (Samson was a judge, and never had a throne; ""she cut your hair"" is <a href=""http://www.sefaria.org/Judges.16.19?lang=bi"" rel=""noreferrer"">definitely Samson</a>). The final line of the stanza reads ""and from your lips she drew the Hallelujah.""</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Your faith was strong but you needed proof<br>
  You saw her bathing on the roof<br>
  Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you<br>
  She tied you to a kitchen chair<br>
  She broke your throne, and she cut your hair<br>
  And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I assume that the final line of the stanza refers to Samson; however, I'm not sure what Samson has to do with ""Hallelujah."" Using a Bible search engine, I could not find an instance where Samson's name (שמשון) appeared with the word ""Hallelujah"" (הללויה). I could not either find the name שמשון in <em>Psalms</em> (although it's possible that one or more Psalms are attributed to Samson; I don't know <em>Psalms</em> or the commentaries on it well enough to say). There's certainly nothing in the story of Delilah with the word ""Hallelujah.""</p>

<p>The word does not appear in II Samuel 11 (nor, actually, in the entire book).</p>

<p><strong>So, my questions are:</strong>  </p>

<ol>
<li>Who are the subject and object in the final line of the stanza? Is it Bathsheba and David, or Delilah and Samson?  </li>
<li>What is the reference made by that line?</li>

In the story, Dream and his sister Death appear similarly to Pop Vinyl characters, and it's really quite adorable.</p>

<blockquote>

  <sub> (page 18) </sub></p>

<p>Cain objects to this portrayal of the eldest Endless, but Abel's rebuttal is a little unclear to me:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/7co90.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/7co90m.jpg"" alt=""Cain, to Abel: &quot;Children?

  <sub> (page 18) </sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So I wonder about the veracity of Abel's portrayal of the Endless. Cain thinks this is a gross oversimplification, but Abel says ""this is my story."" I think there are three possibilities:</p>

<ol>
<li>Abel knows that Cain is right, and changes the story and imagery for baby Daniel's benefit. After all, he does change the end of the story; it's clear by now that in Gaiman's world, Cain and Abel do not live ""happily ever after,"" as Abel finishes the story. He may sanitize other details of the story for the child's benefit.</li>
<li>Abel thinks he's right, because he is. We know that the Endless appear differently to different people (see e.g. <a href=""https://literature.stackexchange.com/a/2223/481"">this Lit.SE answer</a>).</li>
<li>Abel thinks he's right, but he isn't. Cain considers Abel simpleminded, constantly calling him any of several derogatory names like ""powderbrain"" or ""numbskull."" There isn't much to analyze, but Abel appears to be of normal intelligence, even if he is much softer (perhaps more naive) than his brother. If he honestly believes that he and his brother lived happily ever after<sup>1</sup>, then he may be an <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unreliable_narrator"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">unreliable narrator</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Which of these three is it? <strong>Was Morpheus actually ""Li'l Morpheus"" for a time?</strong> (Is there another possibility I haven't considered?)</p>

<hr>

<p><sub> 1: I don't think it's likely that he doesn't understand that his fraternal relationship is severely abusive and dysfunctional, although I admit the possibility. I submit that he doesn't intend the living ""happily ever after"" as part of his story, making it more of a hinted plea to his brother, because the point of view shifts from ""way back when"" back to the present time, when Abel is speaking to Daniel. On the other hand, he doesn't stutter during that part; Matthew notes on the next page that the stutter disappears when Abel tells stories, making it possible that that sentence <em>is</em> part of the story. I'm not really sure how to interpret that part. </sub></p>

 Did he just scribbled here and there for his little thesis? Or did he actually make a formal first draft for the thesis?</p>

"Is it possible that Bastian's journey to Fantastica was purely metaphysical?","<p>The first half of <em>The Neverending Story</em> is about Bastian reading a fantasy story about Atreyu's adventures in Fantastica. The second half is about Bastian's own adventures in Fantastica, a world which he basically recreates from nothing, becoming a completely different person himself in the process, before returning to his own world to find that he's still the same person as originally and only a single night has passed.</p>

<p>My question is: <strong>is it possible that Bastian never actually went to Fantastica?</strong> Is this a valid and consistent reading of the story, or does it  not make sense with everything that happened?</p>

<ul>
<li>Bastian's adventures leave a permanent effect on him, making him more brave and confident. But the same effect could have come from a vivid hallucination in which he had all the experiences detailed in the second half of the book.</li>
<li>The conversation at the very end between Bastian and Mr Coreander hints at a more metaphorical interpretation of Fantastica and the whole story, but I can't quite solidify this idea.</li>
</ul>

<p>Years after reading <em>The Neverending Story</em> as a child, I came to the conclusion that there are many different ways to interpret the story, and I <em>think</em> this may be one of them: that Bastian's whole experience was a dream or hallucination after reading a story he loved, which changed his personality literally overnight. But I'm not certain if it's a totally consistent model of the narrative.</p>

<p>However, he offered him a position as a Crouching Shadow. Was that the main reason he was permitted to take the exam in the first place? The Overseer didn't seem aware of his uncle's (supposed) death until shortly before telling Sunan about their decision, and Sunan had been studying for the exam under his uncle for years. Given those facts, how could they possibly have known that Sunan would be expected to replace his uncle?

So I was up to 1739 when I was about 14 you see. And then a little later I discovered something that I’d find out I just may have invented a thing which we now call operator calculus. That was invented in 1890-something. Gradually I was inventing things that came later and later.</p>

  but the writing style is suitable for adult readers as well. Currently

<p>Now I understand that they have to omit parts of the stories in order to fit them into this type of book. However, I don't see any reason why there would be a need to <em>change</em> things that are kept in the abridged versions. Yet in fact there are changes made in the abridged versions.</p>

<p>Here are three examples from <em>The Count of Monte Cristo</em>:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>In the regular version it was Abbé Faria who directly showed Edmond that it was Danglars, Fernand, and Villefort that had caused his imprisonment. Yet in the Great Illustrated Classics version it is described as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One day as Edmond and Faria rested from the hard work of tunneling,
  Edmond said, ""Father, I have been thinking about my enemies. Your
  lessons on history have taught me how the minds of some men work in
  evil ways. I believe I was accused by two men — Danglars and Fernand.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the next paragraph we have the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Very good thinking,"" said Faria with a smile. ""When you told me
  everything about yourself, I, too, suspected Danglars and Fernand. But
  I wanted you to puzzle it out.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This seems to be a complete invention.</p></li>
<li><p>In the original version the value of Spada's treasure is specified as 13 or 14 million Francs. In the Great Illustrated Classics version the value is given as 70 million Francs.</p></li>
<li><p>In the original version the cannon signifying an escaped prisoner goes off well after Edmond boards the smugglers' boat. In the Great Illustrated Classics version, however, the cannon is shot <em>before</em> he even sees their boat.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Here are two examples from <em>A Journey to the Center of the Earth</em>:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>At the end of the book when they get shot out of a volcano and
wonder where they are, Hans says that they are not in Iceland. In
the original version, the narrator says that Hans is wrong:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Hans must be mistaken,"" I said, raising myself up.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the Great Illustrated Classics version it is the narrator's uncle
who asserts that Hans is wrong:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""You must be wrong,"" my uncle cried.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>The date that they leave Stromboli is off by a month. In the
original version we have:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>After waiting forty-eight hours, on the 31st of August, a small craft
  took us to Messina, where a few days' rest completely removed the
  effect of our fatigues.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the Great Literary Classics version we have:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And forty-eight hours later, on the 30th of September, a boat took us
  to the city of Messina on Sicily.</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ol>

<p>There are many more examples, but I don't think it is necessary to list them.</p>

<p>Is there a purpose to these changes? Do they somehow simplify the story for children? Or did the adapters just read the originals and then entirely rewrite the books as simply stories <em>based on</em> the original?</p>

<p>I am primarily interested in a general principle (or set of principles) that addresses the series as a whole. However, if the answer is that each individual change has its own reason, I am okay with that but would ideally like to see one or two example explanations of some of the individual cases (not necessarily limited to the ones I mentioned).</p>

The book was first published in 2003 and the Harper Collins edition which I read was published in 2008.</p>

<p>The best and most affecting eyewitness account of Magellan’s circumnavigation was written by Antonio Pigafetta, the young Venetian scholar and diplomat who was among the handful of survivors. His chronicle remains one of the most significant documents of the Age of Discovery.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“He was so tall that the tallest of us only came up to his waist,” the
  official chronicler observed. “He had a very large face, painted round
  with red, and his eyes also were painted round with yellow, and in the
  middle of his cheeks he had two hearts painted. He had hardly any
  hairs on his head, and was painted white.” </p>
  
  <p>The giant was a member of the tribe known as the Tehuelche Indians,
  who were numerous throughout the region.</p>

  curtailed education and conversion of the Patagonian giant drew the
  attention of William Shakespeare, who read an English translation by
  Richard Eden of Pigafetta’s diary. Distinctive fingerprints  in 
  Shakespeare’s  resulting  play, ‘The Tempest’, first performed in
  1611, could only have come from Pigafetta’s account. </p>
  
  <p>In Shakespeare’s imagination, the humble details of Pigafetta’s
  encounter with the Patagonian giant are woven into an immense
  cosmological tapestry. The playwright sets the scene on an enchanted
  magical island ruled by Prospero, the duke of Milan, who, with his
  daughter Miranda, had been set adrift by his brother Antonio, a
  usurper. Shipwrecked, Prospero learns magic and manages to remain on
  good terms with spirits inhabiting the island, especially Ariel, a
  sprite whom Prospero had freed from an evil sorceress known as
  Sycorax. But Sycorax also has a son, Caliban, one of the most
  compelling yet enigmatic characters in the Shakespearean canon, and a
  character inspired in part by the Patagonian giant. </p>
  
  <p>The clash between Prospero and Caliban offers a vivid image of the
  impact of European discovery and conquest on indigenous peoples
  throughout the world, and Shakespeare dramatizes the encounter with
  wit and a frisson of horror.  </p>
  
  <p>You taught me language; and my profit on’t   Is, I know how to curse:
  the red plague rid you, </p>
  
  <p>For learning me your language!  </p>
  
  <p>Later, Caliban quotes Pigafetta’s account of the Patagonian giant:  </p>
  
  <p>I must obey: his art is of such power, </p>
  
  <p>It would control my dam’s god, Setebos,</p>
  
  <p>And make a vassal of him.  </p>
  
  <p>Although Shakespeare keeps the setting vague, this mystical play
  demonstrates, if nothing else, that the New World, with its splendour
  and barbarism, had taken up residence in the European consciousness.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is Caliban's description based on the Patagonian Giant described by Antonio Pigafetta? Apart from this reference in the referred adventure book, are there any other sources to support such a conclusion?</p>

"Fight Club book editions and different text passages","<p>I found out that there are different editions of the <em>Fight Club</em> book that contain different text passages. I cannot find any page that would describe these differences and I don't know which version is the original one.</p>

<p>Example of book differences (one of many):</p>

<p>After the following text in chapter 6:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Except for their humping, Marla and Tyler are never in the same room. If Tyler’s around, Marla ignores him. This is familiar ground.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In version 1 is the following text: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The big sleep, `Valley of the Dogs’ style. “Where even if someone loves you enough to save your life, they still castrate you.” Marla looks at me as if I’m the one humping her and says, “I can’t win with you, can I?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In version 2 is the following different text:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My father always said, “Get married before the sex gets boring or you’ll never get married.” My mother said, “Never buy anything with a nylon zipper.”  My parents never said anything you’d want to embroider on a cushion.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am not sure if these differences are between paperback and e-book editions. I have a Czech version of the paperback that contains text from version 2. I have been able to find the online English e-books only with the version 1 text.</p>

<p>I have a question about this poem in a book <em>Cracking the SAT Literature Subject Test</em> (by the way, if you've seen some of my previous SAT questions, these are from another book which is better in quality and which I use until I'm going to use until I finish with it):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What is the effect of using “silver” to describe the “horn” (line 4)?</p>
  
  <p>(A) To imply that the horn is not as valuable as a golden horn <br />
  (B) To foreshadow any item that may be used in the “hunt” (line 8) <br />
  (C) To be alliterative with the word “sound” <br />
  (D) To indicate that the image would be bright <br />
  (E) To symbolize the beauty of wealth</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think A, D, and E can be eliminated but am not sure about the remaining answers.<br>
In C, the words ""sound"" and ""silver,"" actually, are alliterated although I wouldn't think that could be a reason for using the word ""silver"" in general.<br>
As for B, I don't completely understand this answer. I couldn't find an analysis of the poem online although I know it is dedicated to someone who lost their touch with what's important in life. However, I am not 100% sure if the words ""horn"" and ""hunt"" are related in the context of the poem.<br>
And here is the explanation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>C</strong>   “Silver” and “sound” are alliterative (C). There is no comparison
  between silver and gold (A). “Silver” does not foreshadow the hunt
  (B). Silver is not necessarily bright (D). The horn is not about
  wealth, nor are we told it’s beautiful (E).  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Should it be obvious in the context of the poem that the horn and the hunt aren't related here? Is it just my lack of understanding? And do the ""silver horn"" and ""hunt"" symbolize something else?<br>
Also, can alliteration here be the main reason for using a particular word?</p>

"80s-90s Female Cat Burglar accepts only Sapphires as payment","<p>Read at least 30-40 years ago. Was in English read in USA.</p>

<p>Basics of the story is following the career of a Female Cat Burglar in Europe(?) (I think she was French) She travels from country to country pulling solo high value jobs for hire. She ONLY takes payment in the form of Blue Gems. (Believe it was Sapphires, but might have been Blue Diamonds)</p>

<p>Meanwhile in interludes, or maybe flashbacks, they are relating the events of her life, and how she became a cat burglar.</p>

<p>I don't remember anything about any of the jobs. Other than sometimes people trying to get her to take other forms of payment, despite her insistence of Gems as payment.</p>

<p>I do remember the the last job, the the people who hired her paid her in fake gems. And after she leaves with them, they are laughing it off saying more or less when she finds out, who is she going to complain too? The Police?</p>

<p>At this point I think when she discovers they are fakes, she has a quite explicit graphic flashback, which shows why she only wants Blue Gems as payment.</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> When she was a teenager the police grabbed her in a church (I don't
 recall if SHE had committed a crime, was the girl friend of someone
 who had committed a crime, or the police just decided to ""have fun""
 with a runaway they caught) They decided to ""teach her a lesson"" and
 violated her with their night-sticks. The night-sticks were described
 as either very heavily scuffed/scrapped/scratched or engraved with
 patterns so when they hit someone with them it would it would cut them
 up. And while she is being violated, and torn up inside, all she can
 see is a blue stain glass window, which through her tears looks like 
 lots of little blue gems.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I believe the book ends with her in the process of hunting down the men who paid her in fakes.</p>

  <p>A deeper and more esoteric meaning of the Kalevala, however, points to a <strong>contest between Light and Darkness, Good and Evil</strong>; the Finns representing the Light and the Good, and the Lapps, the Darkness and the Evil. Like the Niebelungs, the heroes of the Finns woo for brides the beauteous maidens of the North; and the similarity is rendered still more striking by their frequent inroads into the country of the Lapps, in order to possess themselves of the envied treasure of Lapland, the mysterious Sampo, evidently the Golden Fleece of the Argonautic expedition. </p>

And I do think that that is, except for the very final poem, which, I think, some details had to be put in there to appease the Church, (...) but throughout, I think Lönnrot maintained the feel and the morality (...).</p>

"""Literary theory"": Genre or field?","<p>I vaguely remember learning that ""literary theory,"" according to some, is theory through which society and other artificial constructs are analyzed as though works of literature or art.</p>

<p>I recall finding more useful for my own understanding an original interpretation that ""literary theory"" is theory (of culture, of society, of language, of whatever one likes) that is written as literature, with the same creative and imaginative affordances, the same sensitivities, and a flexible style.</p>

<p>I feel that defining the field of theory this way (ironically?) gives it some legitimacy--for example against the Sokal attacks, which arguably misunderstood its goals--and distinguishes it neatly from philosophy.</p>

"How are we supposed to know that Wainamoinen is the son?","<p>I've just read <a href=""http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/kveng/kvrune01.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the first rune of the Kalevala</a> (Crawford's translation). Most of it is about the ""maiden"", ""daughter of the Ether"", and how her travels in the sea lead to the creation of the world. It is mentioned that she has a baby, but nothing more about that baby:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Seven hundred years she labored<br>
  Ere her first-born was delivered.<br>
  Thus she swam as water-mother,<br>
  Toward the east, and also southward,<br>
  Toward the west, and also northward;<br>
  Swam the sea in all directions,<br>
  Frightened at the strife of storm-winds,<br>
  Swam in travail, swam unceasing,<br>
  Ere her first-born was delivered.</p>

<p>Later in the poem, after the world has been created, the story shifts abruptly to Wainamoinen:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thus created were the islands,<br>
  Rocks were fastened in the ocean,<br>
  Pillars of the sky were planted,<br>
  Fields and forests were created,<br>
  Checkered stones of many colors,<br>
  Gleaming in the silver sunlight,<br>
  All the rocks stood well established;<br>
  But the singer, Wainamoinen,<br>
  Had not yet beheld the sunshine,<br>
  Had not seen the golden moonlight,<br>
  Still remaining undelivered.<br>
  Wainamoinen, old and trusty,<br>
  Lingering within his dungeon</p>

<p>I've read enough about the Kalevala to know that he is the baby mentioned earlier. The title of this rune is also ""The Birth of Wainamoinen"". But how is this clear from the writing itself, without any external context? The baby is mentioned briefly early in this rune, and at the later stage it seems as though we're shifting locations from the maiden in the sea to a man in prison.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[Dagney Taggart] knew that the superintendent of the Ohio Division was no good and that he was a friend of James Taggart. She had not insisted on throwing him out long ago only because she had no better man to put in his place. Good men were so strangely hard to find. But she would have to get rid of him, she thought, and she would give his post to <strong>Owen Kellogg, the young engineer</strong> who was doing a brilliant job as one of the assistants to the manager of the Taggart Terminal in New York; it was Owen Kellog who ran the Terminal...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is somewhat ambiguous. What kind of engineer was he - engineer as in a train driver, or engineer as in ""the subject taught in college""? It's used in both senses in the book - Dagney studied engineering in college, William Hastings and John Galt were described as engineers, and Pat Logan was described an an ""engineer of the Taggart Comet on the Nebraska Division"".</p>

<p>Later, <a href=""https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/4704/why-did-owen-kellogg-have-a-practical-need-for-physics-but-dagney-didnt"">John Galt implies that Owen Kellogg has a practical use for physics</a> (with the possible implication that Dagney didn't). The exact reasons for Galt's statement are discussed more in that question, but does this suggest that he was an engineer in the same sense as William Hastings? Having a practical use for physics would be consistent with an engineering background (although you'd then have to ask why Dagney didn't have a need for it, given that she had an engineering background too).</p>

<p>On the other hand, the fact that he was helping to manage the Taggart Terminal rather than working in the research department would seem to suggest that he was an engineer in the same sense as Pat Logan.</p>

<p>Finally, when Owen and Dagney were stuck on a ""frozen train"" that had been abandoned by its crew, there was no discussion of having Owen Kellogg take over as engineer (even temporarily). This is a bit of an argument from silence, though, and it seems unlikely that he and Dagney would be able to run the train alone without other crew members in any case (so they still would've needed to send for a crew anyway, especially given that Owen Kellogg didn't intend to go all the way to the train's destination).</p>

"Tudor or Jacobean plays that are sequels to a Shakespeare play?","<p>William Shakespeare wrote around 40 plays (depending on how the Shakespeare canon is defined). Except for some of his history plays (<em>Henry IV</em>, <em>Henry VI</em>) and possibly <em>The Merry Wives of Windsor</em> (not a real sequel of <em>Henry IV Part 2</em> but another play involving Falstaff) Shakespeare did not write any continuations or sequels to any of his own plays. Marlowe, by contrast, wrote <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamburlaine"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>Tamburlaine the Great</em></a> as a two-part play. But what about <strong>plays by other dramatists that continue the plot of a Shakespeare play</strong>? Do any such plays exist? </p>

"In Great Expectations, who is the man at the pub in Chapter Ten?","<p>In Chapter 10 of Dickens's <em>Great Expectations</em>, Pip goes to the pub to find Joe, as told by his sister. When he enters the pub, Joe and Mr. Wopsle are sitting at a table next to a mysterious man:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>He was a secret-looking man whom I had never seen before. His head was all on one side, and one of his eyes was half shut up, as if he were taking aim at something with an invisible gun. He had a pipe in his mouth, and he took it out, and, after slowly blowing all his smoke away and looking hard at me all the time, nodded.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Pip would have immediately recognised him if it was Magwitch, considering the trauma he caused him, so it probably isn't. Is it Compeyson? If it is we don't get the tell-tale detail of the large scar across his face that defines his appearance in the rest of the novel. </p>

<p>The man then indicates for Pip to sit next to him and Pip declines. Then he proceeds to 'grill' Joe about who Pip is after he hears his name:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The stranger looked at me again - still cocking his eye, as if he were expressly taking aim at me with his invisible gun - and said, ""He's a likely young parcel of bones that. What is it you call him?""</p>
  
  <p>""Pip,"" said Joe.</p>
  
  <p>""Christened Pip?""</p>
  
  <p>""No, not christened Pip.""</p>
  
  <p>""Surname Pip?""</p>
  
  <p>""No,"" said Joe, ""it's a kind of family name what he gave himself when a infant, and is called by.""</p>
  
  <p>""Son of yours?""</p>
  
  <p>""Well,"" said Joe, meditatively - not, of course, that it could be in anywise necessary to consider about it, but because it was the way at the Jolly Bargemen to seem to consider deeply about everything that was discussed over pipes; ""well - no. No, he ain't.""</p>
  
  <p>""Nevvy?"" said the strange man.</p>
  
  <p>""Well,"" said Joe, with the same appearance of profound cogitation, ""he is not - no, not to deceive you, he is not - my nevvy.""</p>
  
  <p>""What the Blue Blazes is he?"" asked the stranger. Which appeared to me to be an inquiry of unnecessary strength.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If it is Magwitch, he would not need to ask all of these questions since he had met Pip and knew his name as well as meeting Joe when he was captured in the marshes as a runaway convict, so I don't think it is him. </p>

<p>The man also mentions this at the pub, when he is told Mr. Wopsle is the church clerk:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Aha!"" said the stranger, quickly, and cocking his eye at me. ""The lonely church, right out on the marshes, with graves round it!""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This detail supports that perhaps it was Magwitch, since he first appears and meets Pip there, but Compeyson was also loose on the marsh near the church as he was recaptured whilst fighting Magwitch.</p>

<p>Finally, the man begins to stir his rum and water with the file that Pip had given Magwitch to break his shackles at the very beginning of the novel:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>He stirred his rum-and-water pointedly at me, and he tasted his rum-and-water pointedly at me. And he stirred it and he tasted it: not with a spoon that was brought to him, but with a file.</p>
  
  <p>He did this so that nobody but I saw the file; and when he had done it he wiped the file and put it in a breast-pocket. I knew it to be Joe's file, and I knew that he knew my convict, the moment I saw the instrument. I sat gazing at him, spell-bound.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's strange that he was asking Pip's name just a few minutes ago but is now showing him the file, a very pointed symbol of Pip's frightening encounter with Magwitch in the first chapter. Maybe he was making sure it was Pip and not another boy? (this possible unsureness and need for clarification suggests is is not Magwitch) </p>

<p>Since he only let Pip see on purpose, he must either be one of the convicts or a messenger from the convicts. Either way this is a dramatic device used by Dickens to foreshadow the reappearance of Magwitch in Chapter 39 (when he reveals himself as Pip's mysterious benefactor, because he just before he leaves the pub he gives Pip some coins wrapped in two one-pound notes, which symbolises Pip's imminent unexpected inheritance) but is it actually one of the convicts? We know that Magwitch was eventually deported to Australia somewhere between Chapter 5 (when he is arrested in the marsh just after Christmas dinner) and Chapter 39. It is not stated when he does leave the country, but surely after his arrest to the prison ship he would not have been able to be at the pub, which is another consideration that seems to suggest that it cannot be him.</p>

<p><strong>Is there any evidence in the book (or comments by Dickens) that points to who this man is?</strong> </p>

"How to read S.?","<p>I've had <strong>S.</strong> by Doug Dorst and J. J. Abrams on my shelf for ages and finally want to dig into it. From what I've read about it, there is a ton of layers to the book: the printed book itself, pencilled notes, notes in coloured pens from two characters added at 4(?) different times, physical inserts between the pages.</p>

<p>So now I'm wondering, how do you go about reading it to get the most from the experience? Do you try to take in everything at once? Read through the book multiple times, layer by layer? How do you know which timeline of the notes the inserts belong to? Can notes from later times spoil the plot from earlier times?</p>

<p>I've tried googling around a bit, but the recommendations seem to be all over the place, and I'm also a bit wary of spoilers. Since the book has been out for a few years, I figured some people have come up with some decent strategies to enjoy the book as much as possible.</p>

<p>Is there a consensus among fans on the best way to read it (or an ""officially"" recommended way), or at least could anyone give a comprehensive overview of the different approaches to the book and their pros and cons?</p>

"Do Guildenstern and Rosencrantz deserve to die?","<p>In Shakespeare's play <em>Hamlet</em> (<a href=""http://shakespeare.mit.edu/hamlet/full.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">which you can read online</a>), Hamlet is on a voyage with his two friends, Guildenstern and Rosencrantz, to give a letter to a foreign ruler. However, Hamlet discovers that the letter they are carrying orders the foreign ruler to put him (Hamlet) to death. So Hamlet changes the letter so that it asks for Guildenstern and Rosencrantz to be put to death, and then leaves the boat to return home.</p>

<p>However, this seems a little bit unfair to Guildenstern and Rosencrantz. For one thing, they didn't write the letter--Claudius did (the letter had the king's seal). For another, as far as I can tell there isn't any evidence that Guildenstern and Rosencrantz knew about the contents of the letter.</p>

<p>When asked about this, Hamlet tells Horatio that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Why, man, they did make love to this employment;<br>
      They are not near my conscience; their defeat<br>
      Does by their own insinuation grow:<br>
      'Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes<br>
      Between the pass and fell incensed points<br>
      Of mighty opposites.</p>

<p>Which, again, I don't really think is fair. There's no evidence that ""they did make love to this employment,"" and saying that its ""dangerous when the baser nature [Guildenstern and Rosencrantz] comes Between the pass and fell incensed points Of mighty opposites [Hamlet and Claudius]"" seems pretentious rather than a valid moral explanation.</p>

<p>Am I missing something here? Do Guildenstern and Rosencrantz deserve their deaths?</p>

One of his most beautiful songs, <a href=""https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ma_France_(chanson)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Ma France</a> (1969), was banned from the radio for two years. It's last lines are as follows (emphasis added):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Elle tient l’avenir, serré dans ses mains fines<br />
  Celle de <strong>trente-six à soixante-huit chandelles</strong><br />
  Ma France</p>

<p>English (my own translation):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>She [France] holds the future in her fine hands<br />
  That of thirty-six to sixty-eight candles<br />
  My France</p>

<p>What is meant by the words ""trente-six à soixante-huit chandelles""? According to this <a href=""http://www.axisoflogic.com/artman/publish/Article_21885.shtml"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">article by Manuel Talens</a>, </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This verse of consonant rhyme (belle / chandelles) refers to two important dates of French left history during the 20th Century, 1936 and 1968. The first one was the year of Léon Blum's Front Populaire victory in parliamentary elections, whereas the second one was the year of the French May insurrection. Ferrat introduces a play of words with chandelles, which is part of a French language boxing idiomatic expression voir les trente-six chandelles — literally ""to see the thirty-six candles"" — equivalent to the English language ""to see stars"" after a blow on the head. This ingenious rhetoric metabole permutation of both numbers allows the singer to metaphorically represent the failure of the 1968 students uprising at the hands of the French Republic's repressive apparatus.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When I showed this to a teacher of French (a native speaker) whose favourite singer is Jean Ferrat, she was sceptical. So my question is: did Manuel Talens get the meaning of ""trente-six à soixante-huit chandelles"" right or is there a better explanation?</p>

"Meaning of ché in several French or Martiniquan Creole phrases in Wide Sargasso Sea","<p>The first part of Jean Rhys' novel <em>Wide Sargasso Sea</em> is set in Jamaica, but the main character's mother is from Martinique, where French and the French-based Martiniquan Creole are spoken. The family's parrot can speak a few words that are based either on French or Martiniquan Creole. </p>

<p>For example, on page 25 of the Norton Critical Edition of the novel:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our parrot was called Coco, a green parrot. He didn't talk very well, he could say <em>Qui est là? Qui est là?</em> and answer himself <em>Ché Coco, Ché Coco</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Judith L. Raiskin, who edited the Norton Critical Edition, explains Coco's words as ""Who's there?"" and ""Dear Coco."" The first translation is fine, but the second does not appear to make sense. It assumes that ""ché"" is a mispronunciation of ""cher/chère"", turning the French è into é and dropping the guttural R. However, the normal answer to, ""Who's there?"" would be, ""It's Coco"" (since the parrot answers himself) or, in French, ""C'est Coco"". ""Ché Coco"" can be interpreted as a mispronunciation (or perhaps an <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eggcorn"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">eggcorn</a>) of ""C'est Coco"", which sounds more plausible than Judith Raiskin's explanation. </p>

<p>In part two, Prof. Raiskin annotates another phrase in (presumably) Martiniquan Creole:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""<em>Doudou, ché cocotte</em>,"" the elderly woman said to Antoinette.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(The elderly woman is Christophine, who used to be Antoinette's nurse. The word ""doudou"" is also used in Nalo Hopkinson's novel <em>Midnight Robber</em>, which uses many elements from Caribbean culture.) According to Prof. Raiskin, the phrase is</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An endearment, ""darling little ducky"". </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wiktionary tells us that <a href=""https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/doudou#French"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">doudou</a> comes from a duplication of the French word ""doux"" (literally ""soft""), so the first part of the translation is fine. However, since the phrase is a greeting, it would make more sense to translate the second part as ""it's cocotte"" instead of ""little ducky"" (assuming that ""cocotte"" refers to the elderly woman and isn't used in its current meaning).</p>

<p>However, much later (page 90 in the Norton Critical Edition), Christophine uses the phrase ""doudou ché"", which Judith Raiskin translates as ""darling dear"". Based on word order, the translation ""it's doudou"" does not appear to make sense. </p>

<p>My question therefore is what ""ché"" in the above examples means. Does it always mean the same thing? If it comes from ""c'est"", how it is possible to make sense of the last example? (Does Martiniquan Creole use a different word order than French?) If it comes from ""cher/chère"", how does that make sense in the first two examples? </p>

"Aesop's ambiguous fables","<p>I've been reading through some fables of Aesop's. I notice that some of them draw an explicit moral, but I don't know whether these were edited in later. For example, <a href=""https://www.infoplease.com/aesops-fables-221"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this version</a> of ""boy and snails"" stops short of the moral while <a href=""https://sententiaeantiquae.com/2019/08/14/singing-while-the-house-burns-down/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this one</a> delivers it. The collection I've been reading mostly omits them, although characters do often get a line such as ""This is what I deserve for leaving my life in the pasture, hard as it was!"" or ""But the sheep was no fool and retorted...""</p>

<p>However, some are without editorialization and seem open to interpretation. Examples:</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The heart of my question: <strong>Do some of the fables have intentionally ambiguous meanings?</strong> I consider this important because that's quite a different species of literature than black-and-white moralizing. (Of course, I see that at least some fables are of the latter kind.)</p>

<p>Some subquestions of possible relevance:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is this the fault of my edition? That is, do we have some manuscripts with more of the morals spelled out and others with less? I know that the Victorians liked to gloss the fables...</li>
<li>Does something about the form tell me how to read it? For example, in the bramble story, does its having the last word mean anything?</li>
<li>Are there clues from the customs or mores of the time that make some readings more or less likely for the time? For example, if one used to wring swans' necks as a matter of course...</li>

<p>If memory serves, the premise of one of the books was that the beautiful wife-to-be of one of the protagonists was kidnapped by members of a rival tribe. A rescue party is formed by the protagonists and some of the kidnapped girls kin (from the rival tribe?). They track the kidnappers, and soon discover that the kidnappers have sold her to slavers or have been themselves taken by slavers (my recollection of this bit is a bit hazy). The rescue party learn the destination of the slavers by talking to salt traders.</p>

<p>The slavers are heading for the far away mountains to sell their catch to a (relatively) advanced city-dwelling nation ruled by a god-king.
To look at the god-kings face means certain death (unclear if this death is instant, or if it means that the offender is shunned as lawless/banished to a wasteland).
The girl is sold to the temple of the god-king and are to be wed and/or sacrificed to the king.
The rescue party find a local ally to help them, and end up saving the god-king from a plot by the evil vizier/main priest or whatever during a jaguar hunt.
As a reward the girl is freed and reunited with her betrothed, the protagonists get fancy gifts and travel back home.</p>

<p>Some details (that might be from other books in the series):</p>

<ul>
<li>There is a tapir hunt, involving using a big bow which have to be drawn using the feet while lying on the back.</li>
<li>At one point the protagonists have to climb trees to escape/hide from aggressive peccaries</li>
<li>Some people worship a giant (evil?) snapping turtle living in the bottom of a cave and feed it human sacrifices.</li>
<li>There is a sacred gathering of the tribes where conflicts are resolved, trade agreements are made, weddings are decided. All feuds and violence are banned during this gathering, but traveling to the gathering can be dangerous as the restriction on violence only applies to the gathering proper.</li>
<li>Salt, well crafted items and hides are the main trade goods, the protagonists doesn't understand the mountain nation's fascination for precious metals.</li>
<li>There is a character called something like Stonefist because his tolerance of pain (he receives the nickname after holding a burning coal in his hand for a dare?)</li>

"Why and how did the orphan kill his adoptive mother?","<p>While seeking the answer to a <a href=""/questions/tagged/story-identification"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;story-identification&#39;"" rel=""tag"">story-identification</a> question the other day, I got sucked into a collection of Guy de Maupassant's short stories.

<ul>
<li><p><strong><em>how</em> did he kill her?</strong> He does fall under suspicion, but seems to have a solid alibi and is acquitted. How, then (and when) did he actually manage to perform the deed?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>He proved that he had spent the evening up to eleven o'clock in a cafe. Ten persons had seen him, having remained there till his departure.</p>
  
  <p>The driver of the diligence stated that he had set down the murdered woman on the road between half-past nine and ten o'clock.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>More importantly, <strong><em>why</em> did he kill her?</strong> What was his motivation? She'd brought him up since he was a child, and never been anything but loving to him. Even if he hated her for some reason, she was actually in the process of leaving her home when she died, so he wouldn't have had to put up with her any longer anyway. What possible reason could he have to want her dead?</p></li>

"Understanding the use of the word ""Negress"" in the Kilmartin and Cox translation of Solaris","<p>I just finished reading Kilmartin and Cox's translation of Stanislaw Lem's <em>Solaris</em>, and one particular passage stood out to me. I'm hesitant to ask a question about the Kilmartin and Cox translation, because I found out after reading it that <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jun/15/first-direct-translation-solaris"" rel=""noreferrer"">(1) it's a very poor translation, most likely due to the fact that (2) it's not a direct translation, it's a translation of a French translation of the Polish text</a>. The passage occurs on page 30 of my translation, where one character is referred to as a ""Negress"" and described using racially coded language:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Suddenly, looming up in the opening which led to the communal bathroom, a tall silhouette appeared, barely distinguishable in the surrounding gloom. I stood stock still, frozen to the spot. A giant Negress was coming silently towards me with a smooth, rolling gait. I caught a gleam from the whites of her eyes and heard the soft slapping of her bare feet. She was wearing nothing but a yellow skirt of plaited straw; her enormous breasts swung freely and her black arms were as thick as thighs. Less than a yard separated us as she passed me, but she did not give me so much as a glance. She went on her way, her grass skirt swinging rhythmically, resembling one of the steatopygous statues in anthropological museums. She opened Gibarian's door and on the threshold her silhouette stood out distinctly against the bright light from inside the room. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>On one hand, I feel like I'm missing some things in translation here: the word ""Negress"" seems weird to me, and I'm not sure if this is due to Kilmartin and Cox's translation. On the other hand, the passage appeals to several racial stereotypes, such as the reference to the ""grass skirt,"" and the ""statues in anthropological museums.""</p>

<p>I have three interrelated questions. How much was this passage altered in translation? How would the language have been understood by Polish readers? And why did Lem code this particular character as black?</p>

<p>This is very messy, but it allows us to almost complete the above as:</p>

  o sagrada, ni fuentes de aguas | Or profane, nor springs of water<br>
  a donde no hayamos ido | Where we haven't gone to</p>

<p>This tells us that <code>λόγος</code> is probably a typo/mojibake for <code>λόφος</code>, given by <a href=""http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=lofos&amp;la=greek#lexicon"" rel=""noreferrer"">LSJ as quoted by Perseus's Greek Word Study Tool</a> as various things including <code>crest of a hill</code>, and that the incomprehensible <code>ρ6χ</code> must somehow mean <code>spring</code>. I looked for all possible combinations of vowels substituted for the 6 and endings, and found nothing on Perseus, but found <a href=""http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=raxia&amp;la=greek"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>ραχία</code></a>, <code>flood-tide</code>, on the Rocci dictionary. Not too fitting, but maybe. Back in the days when I translated Sappho, I had temporarily settled for <code>ῥέον</code>, but now I guess a better way to do this would be <code>ῥόος</code>, both meaning <code>stream</code> and keeping the initial consonant and possibly a vowel. Analysing other fragments in that safopoemas, 6 is almost certainly an omicron, and the chi could be a kappa, so we could have <code>ροχ</code> or <code>ροκ</code>, neither of which yields anything interesting on Perseus.</p>

<p>I looked around for another source for this completion (possibly Reinach, which this document claims to be following in the quote below), but was unable to find any. So my question is: what was this reconstruction supposed to look like, and who proposed it, and of course, how supported is this amongst critics?</p>

<p><strong>Quote from safopoemas.doc's introduction</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>El texto griego que hemos utilizado fue el que preparó Theodore Reinach, en atención a su magnífico aparato crítico y como homenaje mínimo a su severo y conservador trabajo, que prefiere, sin audacia, leer lo mínimo con la seguridad de que esas escasas palabras fueron de Safo, en lugar de las largas, interesantes y arriesgadas reconstrucciones de otros autores.

"About Sappho's epigram for the little girl Aithopia: first line (manuscript tradition and experts' take), and authorship","<p><strong>Background and research</strong></p>

<p>As I am planning to post this poem on <a href=""http://michelegorini.blogspot.it/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">my blog</a> relatively soon, I was doing some research on the first line. From what I had written previously, I seem to have found two different versions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Παῖδες, ἄφωνος ἔοισα τόδ' ἐννέπω, αἴ τις ἔραται</p>
</blockquote>

<p>or:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Καίπερ ἄφωνος ἔοισα ποτεννέπω, αἴ τις ἔραται</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I opted for the first one for my translations, because <code>καίπερ</code> only stresses the concessive (is that the word?) nature of the participle, and I preferred to have a vocative there like <code>παῖδες</code>, and also because instead of a seemingly useless prefix I preferred an object for the verb <code>ἐννέπω</code>. Tonight I was trying to get more info on the sources. I looked into <a href=""https://www.hs-augsburg.de/~harsch/graeca/Chronologia/S_ante06/Sappho/sap_intr.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">bibliotheca Augustana</a>, and the <code>ἐπιγράμματα</code> link does not exist. I looked at Edmonds (who proposes another version, <code>παῖς ἔτ'</code>, which I prefer to the one I opted for back in the days, and has <code>τόρ'</code> instead of the object, an adjective referred to the speaker meaning ""clear, distinct"", perhaps I will adopt this reading), and he says <code>Anth. Pal. 6 269</code>. Sadly, I found no scans of that. I looked at <a href=""https://www.scribd.com/doc/34720745/Sappho-and-Alcaeus-Loeb"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Campbell</a> hoping for a more detailed critical note, and the poem isn't there! <a href=""https://ia802704.us.archive.org/22/items/sapphomemoirtex00bunngoog/sapphomemoirtex00bunngoog.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wharton</a> agrees with me, <a href=""http://inamidst.com/stuff/sappho/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The Complete Poems of Sappho</a> follows Cox (or so he says), and ends up agreeing with my choice -- almost, he has <code>τότ'</code> instead of <code>τόδ'</code>, perhaps a typo, as ""then"" doesn't seem to fit in there. I'm starting to wonder where I got the other choices. Well, the <code>καίπερ</code> might have been off the weird safopoemas.doc (pdf version <a href=""http://ftp.utalca.cl/intercambio/plataforma/lgc/Dani/Libros/Para%20imprimir/Poemas_completos_Safo.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>), for which cfr. <a href=""https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/2704/who-put-forward-this-completion-to-sappho-94-and-what-is-it-actually-supposed-t"">my post on the completion of Sappho 94</a>.

I don't remember this source, but perhaps that was it.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Anyways, I was wondering what the experts think about this line and its most likely ""correct"" reading, what the sources for this poem have to say, and why Campbell doesn't include it. Is it perhaps of disputed authorship, along with the other two epigrams in elegiac couplets?</p>

"Are man and woman like ash and elm? How?","<p>In Neil Gaiman's adaptation of the Norse myths, <a href=""http://www.neilgaiman.com/works/Books/Norse+Mythology/"" rel=""noreferrer""><em>Norse Mythology</em></a>, it is sometimes clear that certain elements are used in the stories as a way for the Norse people to transmit useful information and skills to their children. For example, in ""The Last Days of Loki,"" Loki invents a net, and Kvasir deduces what it was (both its use and its manner of construction) from the pattern of the ashes. This small exchange can ensure that children understand the skill of net-making (and also, possibly, to teach them deductive reasoning).</p>

<p>One of the earlier stories, ""Before the Beginning, and After,"" describes the creation of human beings. Odin and his brothers, realizing that the world of Midgard must be inhabited, set out to create humanity. They collect two logs that had floated to shore:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The first log was a log of ash wood. The ash tree is resilient and
  handsome and its roots go deep. Its wood carves well and will not
  split or crack. Ash wood makes a good tool handle, or the shaft of a
  spear.</p>
  
  <p>The second log they found, beside the first on the beach, so close to
  the first log they were almost touching, was a log of elm wood. The
  elm tree is graceful, but its wood is hard enough to be made into the
  toughest planks and beams; you can build a fine home or a hall from
  elm wood.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The godly brothers then give the logs first life, then will, intelligence, and drive, and finally shape (one male, one female). Then they give them clothes, for they were cold, and finally they gave them names.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Last of all they gave the two people they had made names: the man they
  called Ask, or Ash Tree; the woman they called Embla, or Elm.</p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
<li>Does this description of man as Ash, and woman as Elm, tell us anything about how the ancient Norse people understood gender and the differences between men and women?</li>
<li>If the story does tell us something about the ancient Norse views on gender, is there something in the first passage I quoted, about the suitable uses for ash and elm wood, that is relevant to this? The explanation of the differences between the two woods (both are useful, but in different ways) might reveal a similar attitude toward men and women (neither is superior, but they have different roles), or it might only be a practical description of the materials available to the Norse, and nothing else.</li>
<li>Is this description of man and woman as Ash and Elm changed in any way from the original Norse myths? (I know there's been some discussion about the accuracy of Gaiman's transmission of the myths, but I haven't yet seen any discussion of <em>particular</em> discrepancies in <em>Norse Mythology</em>.)</li>

"What does it mean that different parts of humans are created by different gods?","<p>While looking at <em>Norse Mythology</em> to write <a href=""https://literature.stackexchange.com/q/2748/481"">this question</a>, I read a passage of the book more closely than I had before, and noticed something interesting. When humans are created, the brothers Odin, Vili, and Ve each take a different role in the creation of the first two fully functioning humans beings. First, Odin gives them life: ""Odin [...] breathed life into them [...] now they were alive."" Then ""Vili gave them will; he gave them intelligence and drive. Now they could move, and they could want."" Finally, ""Ve carved the logs,"" giving them a shape, making one male and one female. And then all three brothers give them clothes, and names. (p. 33-34)</p>

<p>Is there a significance to the creation of each different part of the complete human being coming from different brothers? After reading Gaiman's book, I don't feel that I know Vili and Ve very well, but Odin is certainly very different from his brothers. Neither Vili nor Ve, for example, sacrificed an eye or hanged themselves to seek knowledge. The gallows-god is also a strong-willed leader; Odin, not his brothers, leads the Aesir and the Einherjar. He is in charge of battle, and is the most important god in the Norse pantheon; these are qualities that his brothers lack.</p>

<p><strong>What, if anything, does it mean that essential qualities of humanity are endowed by different gods?</strong></p>

<p>Do these gods have different skill sets? Is it possible that Odin wouldn't be able to, let's say, carve the logs into a shape? Or could it be that, assuming all three brothers are equally capable, there is a reason that Odin, as the god of war (or any of the other things he is god of) is associated with the breath of life, and ditto for Vili and Ve? How should we explain the multistep and multi-player creation of humanity in the Norse mythos?</p>

"Confusing list in Crime and Punishment","<p>I have started to read some classic books and I am having some trouble understanding some parts of chapter 6 part 3 in <em>Crime and Punishment</em>, this is after Raskolnikov is called a ""Murderer"" by a man that was in Raskolnikov's lodgings. Briefly after Raskolnikov chases the man and comes back to his room, he starts thinking about his theory. However, I get confused in this part:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""In the first place, because I can reason that I am one, and secondly, because for a month past I have been troubling benevolent Providence, calling it to witness that not for my own fleshly lusts did I undertake it, but with a grand and noble object--ha-ha! Thirdly, because I aimed at carrying it out as justly as possible, weighing, measuring and calculating. Of all the lice I picked out the most useless one and proposed to take from her only as much as I needed for the first step, no more nor less (so the rest would have gone to a monastery, according to her will, ha-ha!). And what shows that I am utterly a louse,""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So I believe he is trying to prove that is indeed a ""louse,"" which I think means something insignificant and trivial. However, I don't get what he is trying to say with this list:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the first place, because I can reason that I am one</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ok so he is one because he can figure out by himself he is a louse. Got it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>secondly, because for a month past I have been troubling benevolent Providence, calling it to witness that not for my own fleshly lusts did I undertake it, but with a grand and noble object--ha-ha!</p>

<p>This is where I get lost. He says for ""a month past,"" which I think means a month after, he has ""been troubling benevolent Providence."" <strong>What is ""benevolent Providence?""</strong></p>

<p>Then he says that it wasn't because of his human lust, but because of a nobler purpose. How does that prove he is a ""louse""?</p>

Fortunately, I've now finished the sixth Alex adventure, <em>Ark Angel</em>, and don't plan to return to him until I've finished the second and third volumes of The Gatekeepers series.<br>
  What do the two series have in common? Pace, adventure, action, violence, and, I hope, readability. They're both fairly adult - not classic ""children's books"". But Matt Freeman is no Alex Rider. He's much less sure of himself, even more of a victim than Alex. And there won't be quite so many happy endings in The Gatekeepers.</p>

<p>But what are some examples of Matt being less sure of himself? In what other ways are they different?</p>

"Is the heart in ""The Hunt"" associated with Desire?","<p>One symbol that is repeatedly associated with Desire is a crystal heart. This appears in several Sandman stories, including in each Endless member's gallery. (Each Endless has a gallery, containing the sigils of the other Endless.) </p>

<p><sup>The Sandman #16 ""Lost Hearts""</sup></p>

<p>The hearts are also something of a signature for Desire; when Nada's village was destroyed by Desire in <em>The Sandman</em> #9 (""Tales in the Sand""), crystalline hearts are left in the sand (and prompt the old man to begin his tale). </p>

<p>I wonder, then, if the ""emerald heart of Koschei the Deathless,"" (seen in <em>The Sandman</em> #38 ""<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sandman:_Fables_%26_Reflections#.22The_Hunt.22"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The Hunt</a>"") is also associated with Desire of the Endless. The heart, given to Baba Yaga, appears strikingly similar to those hearts associated with Desire:</p>

<p>Desire's hearts appear in different colors, at least white and red, so I don't think Koschei's hearts green means that this is a different type of heart.</p>

"Did ""Number Five"" really act differently from his father?","<p>In the story <em>The Fifth Head of Cerberus</em>, the protagonist - whose real name is never mentioned, so I'll just call him ""Number Five"" as his father and aunt do - is essentially an experiment of his father's. Towards the end of the story he learns that he is</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> a cloned duplicate of his father, in fact part of a long sequence of such duplicates.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The visiting Dr Marsch describes the experiment as like ""relaxation"", in which approximations are made increasingly accurate by iteration. He says that ""Number Five"" and his father are now essentially one individual - an observation which seems supported by the close physical resemblance between them, noted throughout the story and especially strong towards the end.</p>

<p>But the implication of the final part of the story, or at least the implication I picked up, is that ""Number Five"" turns out <em>not</em> to be so much like his father after all. In fact, he</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> kills his father, and serves long years in a labour camp for this crime.</p>

<p>Was his father expecting this, and did he do the same thing to his own father? <strong>By doing what he did, is ""Number Five"" essentially conforming to his father's intent and carrying on the same family tradition? Or did he dramatically diverge from the expected behaviour of his family</strong> (and if so, why - what influences on his life made him so different from his father and grandfather?)?</p>

<p>I've only read the story once, and the answer to this important issue has evaded me. But I suspect that a close reading of the text, and especially the parts which refer to the protagonist's father/ancestors and his relationship with them, will provide enough evidence to piece together the answer.</p>

"How did having a full pot of tea betray the doctor's lowly origins?","<p><em>Memoires of gedenkschriften van minister Pieter Bas</em> (<em>The memoirs of Minister Pieter Bas</em>) is a satirical biography of a fictional Minister of Education. The book is mostly about the man's youth in the second half of the 19th century. The book was first published in 1937.</p>

<p>Early in the book, the author describes the social status of various members of the future Minister's hometown of Dordrecht, and how some of them fell down the social ladder.</p>

<p>Translating from Dutch:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Well-known is the case of doctor Jolles. His whole life had been one masterful tactic to hide the fact that his father had been a butcher. He married the daughter of Bille, he bought a house at the Wijnandt Bridge; and slowly ascending via the tax receiver, past the apothecary, past Boddens, yes past Venemeyer, he found himself in the space between Sanders and Simons, and would soon have been allowed to tap Simons' shoulder, saying: ""Would you come to me, Jan, tonight?"" when that fatal event happened on the card-playing evening of Mrs Beekman.<br>
  ""Do you want more tea, doctor?"" Mrs Beekman had said (she spoke those words at the window, according to others however she stood on the doorstep). ""No"", Jolles had answered laughing, ""I still have a full pot at home"".<br>
  <em>The moment</em> he said this, he went pale. But it was too late. His life's work was destroyed. He fell deep beneath the tax receiver, still made a few attempts to get out of this swamp until death surprised him. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The author goes on to suggest that death was a release, after this fall from grace.</p>

<p>The work is highly satirical, and the paragraph can be seen as poking fun at the value people ascribe to social status.  </p>

<p>It seems that both Jolles and Simons are medical doctors. Since it is set in the late 1800s, and written in 1937, it makes sense that a lowly origin affects Dr. Jolles' status, putting him below Dr. Simons in the eyes of the other people of status in town.</p>

<p>There doesn't seem to be much analysis of the book; most of what's on the internet is written by school children reading it as homework.

<p>The question is, how does having a pot full of tea at home betray his lowly origins and cause his fall from grace? Since the work is satirical, there may be a joke here that is lost on 21st century readers? The best we could think of is that it somehow showed him being too frugal to be a part of high society; but we were unable to establish if that was the case.</p>

<p>There are a number of things going on in this passage.

The dog comes in because you don't want the corpse you burried to be dug up: that ruins the power of the ritual.</p>

<p>At the same, <a href=""http://www.bartleby.com/40/188.html"">line 74 seems to be an allusion to John Webster's play <em>The White Devil</em>, which contains a very similar line</a>: ""But keep the wolf far thence, that’s foe to men, / For with his nails he’ll dig them up again."" I'm not quite sure how to interpret the contradiction between the wolf in Webster's poem, which is a ""foe to man"", and the dog in <em>The Waste Land</em> which is a ""friend to man"". However, the section of <em>The Waste Land</em> that line 74 is in is full of contradictions, such as ""winter kept us warm"" (line 5). All of these contradictions illustrate the irony of modern life.</p>

<p>I'm hoping to get a sense of all the different ways of looking at this line in <em>The Waste Land</em>. Any and all interpretations of this line (so long as they are based on evidence) will be accepted.</p>

"Why do the Watches bother with anything if the whole system is designed to be balanced?","<p>The basis of the interactions between the Watches seems to be to keep the balance in their powers: whatever one side does, it must allow the other to counteract. Thus the Night Watch/Inquisition/Day Watch system - to prevent any side from getting too strong and taking over the world. I.e. this is a sort of a zero sum game, where an advantage gained by one faction is compensated by providing the other side with an equal advantage (e.g. every Other has a certain allowance of applications of magic they can use every year). </p>

<p>This brings the question: why even bother trying to get the upper hand over the other faction? A striking example is Nadya, whom the Light ones designed to be the messiah of light, the most powerful sorceress in the history of ever. As Gesar later tells Anton, she came at a price - a ""credit"" or a ""loan"" taken from the Dark ones, meaning the latter had to be allowed to do something equally powerful.</p>

<p>Why do the Others keep playing this game? It always plays out in such a way that the two major factions remain at the same level, even if they gain a temporary advantage, except the stakes keep getting bigger (think Nadya, she saw said to be able to destroy the Twilight and the Earth).</p>

"Is ""Hyperdimension Warp Record"" parodying/referring to a particular anime?","<p>The short story <a href=""https://uncannymagazine.com/article/fandom-for-robots/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">""Fandom For Robots""</a>, written by Vina Jie-Min Prasad for Uncanny magazine,<sup>1</sup> concerns a robot entering into the fandom of a particular anime TV series. As a member of <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/"">an online sci-fi/fantasy community</a> myself, I can tell that this is a broadly accurate depiction of such fandoms in general. But as someone with absolutely no knowledge of anime, I have no idea if the fictional series 
<em>Hyperdimension Warp Record</em>, or <em>HyperWarp</em>, is a thinly-veiled reference to some particular real anime series, or if it's just meant to be a generic portrayal based on anime fandom as a whole.</p>

<p>From the text of the story (<a href=""https://uncannymagazine.com/article/fandom-for-robots/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">which you can read in full online</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hyperdimension Warp Record (超次元 ワープ レコード Chōjigen Wāpu Rekōdo, literal translation: Super Dimensional Warp Record) is a Japanese anime series set in space in the far future. The protagonist, Ellison, is an escapee from a supposedly inescapable galactic prison. Joined by a fellow escapee, Cyro (short for Cybernetic Robot), the two make their way across the galaxy to seek revenge. The targets of their revenge are the Seven Sabers of Paradise, who have stolen the hyperdimensional warp unit from Cyro’s creator and caused the death of Ellison’s entire family.</p>
  
  <p>Episode seven of HyperWarp comes with the revelation that the Second Saber, Ellison’s identical twin, had murdered their parents before faking her own death. After Cyro and Ellison return to the Kosmogram, the last segment of the episode unfolds without dialogue. There is a slow pan across the spaceship’s control area, revealing that Ellison has indulged in the human pastime known as “crying” before falling asleep in the captain’s chair. His chest binder is stained with blood from the wound on his collarbone. Cyro reaches over, gently using his grabbing claw to loosen Ellison’s binder, and drapes a blanket over him. An instrumental version of the end theme plays as Cyro gets up from his seat, making his way to the recharging bay at the back of the ship. From the way his footfalls are animated, it is clear that Cyro is trying his best to avoid making any noise as he walks.</p>
  
  <p>The credits play over a zoomed-out shot of the Kosmogram making its way to the next exoplanet, a tiny pinpoint of bright blue in the vast blackness of space.</p>
  
  <p>The preview for the next episode seems to indicate that the episode will focus on the Sabers’ initial attempt to activate the hyperdimensional warp unit. There is no mention of Cyro or Ellison at all.</p>

Lenina is <a href=""https://literature.stackexchange.com/q/4/115"">probably a Beta</a>. Linda is stated to be a Beta-Minus. Fanny Crowne is probably also a Beta or Beta-Minus since she works in the Fertilizing Room and it seems like all the technicians at the Hatchery are Betas (Linda worked in the Bottling Room).</p>

<p>There's some minor circumstantial evidence against the existence of female Alphas; at the beginning of Chapter 4 it says ""The lift was crowded with men from the Alpha Changing Rooms"", as if the Alpha Changing Rooms are all-male. But the door Lenina opens towards the start of Chapter 3 just says ""Girls' Dressing-Room"", not ""Beta Girls' Dressing-Room"". I'm not entirely convinced by this, though.</p>

"Is the impenetrability of Chapter 14 of Ulysses deliberate, or a consequence of its stylistic pastiches?","<p>Chapter 14 of Joyce's Ulysses, The Oxen of the Sun, frequently changes writing styles as it unfolds. Joyce was attempting to mimic the development of the English language, from its Latin roots through to modern-day street slang.</p>

<p>Many of these passages are extremely difficult to understand. Here's an example modelled on the work of early Roman historians:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Universally that person's acumen is esteemed very little perceptive concerning whatsoever matters are being held as most profitable by mortals with sapience endowed to be studied who is ignorant of that which the most in doctrine erudite and certainly by reason of that in them high mind's ornament deserving of veneration constantly maintain when by general consent they affirm that other circumstances being equal by no exterior splendour is the prosperity of a nation more efficaciously asserted than by the measure of how far forward may have progressed the tribute of its solicitude for that proliferent continuance which of evils the original if it be absent when fortunately present constitutes the certain sign of omnipollent nature's incorrupted benefaction. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here's another, which mimics the work of Aelfric, a 10th century Anglo-Saxon writer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Before born babe bliss had. Within womb won he worship. Whatever in that one case done commodiously done was. A couch by midwives attended with wholesome food reposeful cleanest swaddles as though forthbringing were now done and by wise foresight set: but to this no less of what drugs there is need and surgical implements which are pertaining to her case not omitting aspect of all very distracting spectacles in various latitudes by our terrestrial orb offered together with images, divine and human, the cogitation of which by sejunct females is to tumescence conducive or eases issue in the high sunbright wellbuilt fair home of mothers when, ostensibly far gone and reproductitive, it is come by her thereto to lie in, her term up.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My question is this: not being familiar with the overwhelming majority of historical styles employed, it is not clear to me whether or not the incomprehensibility of the text is a consequence of the style it's mimicking? Or to put it another way, could Joyce have attempted this literary history lesson while leaving the text easier for the reader to follow?</p>

"Who is Thomas o' Becket"" in Tristram Shandy?","<p>Who is Thomas o'Becket in chapter 2, vol.7 of <em>The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman</em>?</p>

<p>In this chapter Tristram says he has never visited St. Thomas at Canterbury before. This Thomas is St. Thomas à Becket. But in the following passage he also says as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So without arguing the matter further with <strong>Thomas o’Becket</strong>, or any one else—</p>
</blockquote>

<p>St. Becket is of course dead at the time when Tristram wrote this. So I wondered if this second Becket is the author's publisher, whose name was also Thomas Becket. Do you think my guess is right, or do you think Thomas à Becket and Thomas o’Becket are the same person? </p>

<p>Below is the whole passage for reference.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>——and I never gave a peep into Rochester church, or took notice of the dock of Chatham, or visited St. Thomas at Canterbury, though they all three laid in my way—— —But mine, indeed, is a particular case——</p>
  
  <p>So without arguing the matter further with Thomas o’Becket, or any one else—I skip’d into the boat, and in five minutes we got under sail and scudded away like the wind.</p>

"Why did the gods decide that Enkidu must die?","<p>In the Epic of Gilgamesh, a major turning point is the death of Enkidu as a punishment from the gods after he and Gilgamesh slew both Humbaba and Gugalanna. From the <a href=""http://www.jasoncolavito.com/epic-of-gilgamesh.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">modernised Muss-Arnolt translation</a>, Tablet VII:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The great gods Anu, Enlil, Ea, and Shamash held an assembly, and Anu spoke unto Ea thus: ‘Because these two slew the Heaven-Bull, and slew Humbaba, the guardian of the mountains and the Forest of Cedar, one of the two must die.’ Enlil said unto Anu, ‘Let Enkidu die, for Gilgamesh must die not!’ Shamash, however, spoke unto Enlil thus: ‘Was it not by thy order that these men slew the Heaven-Bull and the guardian Humbaba? Why should the innocent Enkidu die for this?’ But Enlil, burning with anger at Shamash, said unto him: ‘Each day thou traveled with them like unto a companion.’</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm missing the cause of the political undercurrents between these gods. Why is it that killing Humbaba and Gugalanna (at the behest of the gods?) is considered cause for killing one of the two men? Why only one? Why Enkidu and not Gilgamesh? (Could it be that Humbaba and Gugalanna are only an excuse, the real reason being Enkidu's failure to defeat Gilgamesh?)</p>

<p>Is there any more information about this decision, perhaps in a different version of the text, or some context from other passages?</p>

"Fantasy children’s novel about a boy who can’t lie","<p>I read this book around 2010 and I need help identifying it.</p>

<p>The first scene was of a woman who had just given birth (?, she had her newborn) and it was raining. A wizard (who have been called something else) knocked on her door and she let him in. He was there to give a gift to the child. He was already in a bad mood because of the rain and the mud. The mother was trying to get her son something good and she annoyed the wizard who ‘gifted’ the kid with truthfulness before leaving.</p>

<p>In the next scene (?) the boy is older and having difficulty with his inability to lie. There might be some sort of fair at his town. He talks with his mother and somehow it’s decided he’s going to magic school.</p>

<p>At the magic school (which I think was underground) he is working with another boy, who he is on vaguely antagonistic terms with. They either have to extinguish a flame or make it cold. The kid who can’t lie casts a spell (?) and when he picks up the candle it is cold. The other boy sits on the table and starts screaming because the heat was left behind. He accuses the first boy of doing it on purpose, getting him in trouble (?) from their teacher.</p>

<p>At some point both boys and the original wizard end up in tunnels on a flying carpet being chased by giant worms. (The worms might be purple, but I’m not sure.) I think the original wizard wasn’t very powerful.</p>

<p>I think the cover was yellow and it may have been part of a series.</p>

"What is the origin of the trope of an evil character whose name is not permitted to be spoken?","<p>Many works of fantasy involve an evil leader or ""dark lord"" whose real name is known but usually not permitted to be spoken, either by his own followers (out of respect?) or by others (out of fear?) or both.</p>

<ul>
<li>In the Wheel of Time series, the Dark One's true name is Shai'tan, but nobody uses the name, either Darkfriends or good people, for fear of attracting unwanted attention from him.</li>
<li>In the Harry Potter series, Voldemort is referred to by such names as You-Know-Who, He Who Must Not Be Named, or (by his followers) the Dark Lord.</li>
<li>In the Lord of the Rings, Sauron does not permit his name to be used by his followers. (I'm not exactly sure why and <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/q/218155/31394"">have asked a related question about that</a>.)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What is the origin of this trope?</strong> Many fantasy tropes spring originally from Tolkien, but this one feels older.

"Is there any special significance in Dr. Rutenspitz's last words to Mr. Golyadkin?","<p>Throughout <em>The Double</em> by Fyodor Dostoyevsky, there had been hints that maybe Mr. Golyadkin Jr., the double, was a product of Mr. Golyadkin Sr.'s imagination — and that it was either a way to signify him struggling to reconcile two facets of himself, or that he was simply suffering from some sort of mental disorder. Right at the end, it's made clear that it's most likely the latter, given that the last chapter pretty much describes Mr. Golyadkin having a psychotic/mental breakdown. Furthermore, a few chapters before that Mr. Golyadkin pulls a vial of medicine out of his pocket (even though he seems confused by it, and maybe thinks it's poison...?), which means he'd been presumably diagnosed with something beforehand too.</p>

<p>Right at the end of <em>The Double</em>, Mr. Golyadkin is taken by his friend, Dr. Krestyan Ivanovitch Rutenspitz, in a carriage, presumably to an asylum. As I mentioned before, the last chapter describes what seems like a psychotic or mental breakdown.

"What is the supposed cover story in ""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy""?","<p>Spoilers for John Le Carré’s <em>Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy</em>.</p>

<p>In this novel, Percy Alleline has become the director of “the Circus”, a fictional British intelligence service. Alleline and the department heads of the Circus (Bill Haydon, Toby Esterhase, and Roy Bland) are running a group of Russian agents, codenamed “Source Merlin”, who communicate by passing their secrets to Aleksey Polyakov, supposedly a cultural attaché at the Soviet Union’s embassy in London. Polyakov passes the secrets to Esterhase at meetings in a house in Camden owned by Alleline:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Treasury had sanctioned sixty thousand pounds for the freehold and another ten for furniture and fittings. To cut costs, it wanted its own lawyers to handle the conveyance. Alleline refused to reveal the address. For the same reason there was an argument about who should keep the deeds. This time the Treasury put its foot down and its lawyers drew up instruments to get the house back from Alleline should he die or go bankrupt.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Polyakov is actually a spy, and his cover story for the meetings is that Esterhase is <em>his</em> agent in the Circus, and accordingly the Circus carefully selects harmless low-level information (“chickenfeed”) for Esterhase to pass to Polyakov for the latter to put in his reports to “Moscow Centre”:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‘What I’m asking you is very simple,’ Smiley insisted. ‘Notionally, who is Polyakov’s agent inside the Circus? Good heavens, Toby, don’t be obtuse. If Polyakov’s cover for meeting you people is that he is spying on the Circus, then he must have a Circus spy, mustn’t he? So who is he? He can’t come back to the Embassy after a meeting with you people, loaded with reels of Circus chickenfeed, and say, “I got this from the boys.” There has to be a story, and a good one at that: a whole history of courtship, recruitment, clandestine meetings, money and motive. Doesn’t there? Heavens, this isn’t just Polyakov’s cover story: it’s his lifeline. It’s got to be thorough. It’s got to be convincing; I’d say it was a very big issue in the game. So who is he?’ Smiley enquired pleasantly. ‘You? Toby Esterhase masquerades as a Circus traitor in order to keep Polyakov in business? My hat, Toby, that’s worth a whole handful of medals.’</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My question is this. <em>In the Circus’ view</em>, what is Polyakov’s cover story, in his reports to Moscow Centre, for the meetings with Esterhase taking place at a house owned by the director of the Circus? I can see five possibilities, none completely satisfactory:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The Circus has not considered this problem.</p></li>
<li><p>The Circus believes that Polyakov says in his reports that he meets Esterhase somewhere else. (The problem with this is that Moscow Centre might tail him one day and discover that he has been lying.)</p></li>
<li><p>The Circus believes that Polyakov tells the truth about the location of the meetings but lies about the nature of the house. (The problem with this is that Moscow Centre might discover that Alleline owned the freehold. The novel is set in the 1970s, well before the <a href=""http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/9/contents"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Land Registration Act 2002</a> made it compulsory to register ownership upon purchase, but the seller and both sets of conveyancing solicitors would have known, and it seems risky to depend on their silence for such a delicate operation.)</p></li>
<li><p>The Circus believes that Polyakov tells the truth about the house but says that Esterhase, as a senior member of the Circus, is able to suppress evidence that the meetings took place there. (The problem with this is that the safe house has a housekeeper, Millie McCraig, and there would need to be a convincing story explaining why her silence could be relied on.)</p></li>
<li><p>The Circus believes that Polyakov tells the truth about the house but says that Esterhase has a cover story for the meetings, namely that Polyakov is <em>his</em> agent. (There are several problems with this. One, Polyakov would need to be passing “chickenfeed” to Esterhase, in addition to the “Source Merlin” material, to explain how Esterhase is able to make his cover story stick, and there is no hint of this in the novel. Two, Esterhase’s cover story wouldn’t be convincing to the Circus as it wouldn’t explain how Polyakov was able to secretly visit the house, as he points out himself: “But [Polyakov]’s got to pretend to his own people that he’s spying on us. How else does he get away with it? How does he walk in and out of that house all day, no gorillas, no babysitters, everything so easy?” Three, this scenario is too close to the truth.)</p></li>

<p>I'm confused about this one. Firstly, Jian Yi appears to genuinely be taking a shower. Secondly, the bathtub is behind him.

<blockquote>
  <p>Read not to contradict and confute, nor to believe and take for granted, nor to find talk and discourse, but to weigh and consider. Some books are to be tasted, others to be swallowed, and some few to be chewed and digested that is, some books are to be read only in parts, others to be read, but not curiously; and some few to be read wholly and with diligence and attention. Some books may also be read by deputy, and extracts made of them by others; but that would be only in the less important arguments and the meaner sort of books; else distilled books are like common distilled waters, flashy things. Reading maketh a full man, conference a reading man, and writing an exact man. And therefore if a man writes little, he had need have a good memory; if he confers little, he had need have a present wit; and if he reads little, he had need have much cunning to seem to know that he doth not.</p>
  
  <p>Histories make men wise, poets witty, the mathematics subtle, natural philosophy deep, moral, grave, logic and rhetoric able to contend.</p>

"What does the author imply by using the phrase “open to attack” for the element of worship in patriotism?","<p>Source:  <a href=""https://csatprep.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/rc-exercise-1.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://csatprep.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/rc-exercise-1.pdf</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Patriotism is a very complex feeling, built up out of primitive instincts and highly intellectual convictions. There is love of home and family and friends, making us peculiarly anxious to preserve our own country from invasion. There is the mild instinctive liking for compatriots against foreigners. There is pride, which is bound up with the success of the community to which we feel that we belong. There is a belief, suggested by pride, but reinforced by history, that one’s own nation represents a great tradition and stands for ideals that are important to the human race. But besides all these, there is another element, at once nobler and more open to attack, an element of worship, of willing sacrifice, of joyful merging of the individual life in the life of the nation. This religious element in patriotism is essential to the strength of the State, since it enlists the best that is in most men on the side of national sacrifice.</p>

  <p>What does the author imply by using the phrase “open to attack” for the element of worship in patriotism?</p>

<p>Options are:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>This element is unnecessary in some instances of patriotic behaviour </li>
  <li>This element will call for various acts of national sacrifice</li>
  <li>This element has no historical basis yet it is important </li>

"Were the contributors to ""The SEA is Ours"" all already established authors?","<p><em>The SEA is Ours</em> is an anthology collection of steampunk stories by various South-East Asian authors, including names such as Olivia Ho, Marilag Angway, and Timothy Dimacali. I know very little about either steampunk or South-East Asian literature, so none of these names were familiar to me; however, a little online searching told me that at least some of them, such as <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TJ_Dimacali"" rel=""noreferrer"">Dimacali</a>, were already well-known authors in the genre, and presumably were asked to contribute for that reason.</p>

<p><strong>Were all of the contributors already established authors?</strong> In other words, is <em>The SEA is Ours</em> a collection of short stories by famous authors, the sort of anthology that might advertise itself by ""includes stories from So-and-so!"" - or is it a collaborative effort to create a new thing, a South-East Asian steampunk collection, by a mixed team qualified more by enthusiasm than experience?</p>
"
"Do the stories in ""The SEA is Ours"" accurately portray the essential aspects of South-East Asian culture?","<p><em>The SEA is Ours</em> is <a href=""https://literature.meta.stackexchange.com/q/738/481"">this month</a>'s <a href=""https://literature.meta.stackexchange.com/q/571/481"">topic challenge</a>. The purpose of these challenges is to increase the diversity of the literature that we discuss on this site. This is important for a number of reasons, among them to increase our understanding of cultures other than our own.</p>

<p>Therefore, I'd like to ask if the stories from <em>The SEA is Ours</em> accurately portray South-East Asian culture. I have little to no prior experience with SEA culture, and want to ensure that I'm getting a correct picture from the stories of this anthology (whenever my copy arrives). I understand that <a href=""https://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/1037?m=38044993#38044993"">culture isn't static</a>, and that part of writing SEA characters and culture into a steampunk world necessitates the creation of something new; however, I imagine that an effort was made to preserve the essence of SEA culture and society in the brave new steampunk world(s) of this collection. If that effort falls short in some manner, I'd like to be alerted about it in advance so that I don't come to misunderstand the culture under discussion.</p>

<p>While an <a href=""https://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/1037?m=38044864#38044864"">argument could be made</a> that if ""SEA authors are writing SEA steampunk, then it would be difficult for it to not in some way be an authentic representation of SEA culture,"" I know that other efforts by members of a given culture to explain parts of that culture have fallen short in different ways. (See, for example, <a href=""https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/1037/conversation/counterargument-to-if-chamorros-are-doing-it"">this part of a conversation in chat</a> regarding Chamorro culture.)</p>

<p>I suppose that the best answers to this question will come from those who have both read the book, and are familiar enough with SEA culture to point to things that were done correctly (or not). Answers that quote reviews from South-East Asians describing the accuracy of the stories are also acceptable.</p>

"Why did Morris and Clay preemptively dissolve the Red-Headed League?","<p><strong>Spoilers ahead for The Red-Headed League.</strong></p>

<p>In this Sherlock Holmes story, Holmes and Watson are recruited by a flustered pawnbroker, Jabez Wilson, who has been tricked into joining a fake society, the Red-Headed League. In reality, the society was just a ruse to get Wilson out of his house between the hours of 10 and 2. Whilst he was out, the criminal John Clay, who had taken a job in Wilson's shop, was digging a tunnel to the nearby bank. Wilson was supervised by Clay's accomplice, William Morris, who acted as the League's enforcer and who served to make sure Wilson never left the offices they had hired for him to use.</p>

<p>When Clay had finished the tunnel, Morris disbanded the League. Wilson came to the office as usual to see a sign that read:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Red-Headed League is Dissolved<br>
  9 October 1890</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Holmes is then able to guess the date when the duo plan to carry out their raid on the basis of this announcement.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""And how could you tell that they would make their attempt tonight?"" I asked.<br>
  ""Well, when they closed their league offices that was a sign that they cared no longer about Mr Jabez Wilson's presence - in other words, that they had completed their tunnel. But it was essential that they should use it soon, as it might be discovered, or the bullion might be removed. Saturday would suit them better than any other day, as it would give them two days for their escape. For all these reasons I expected them to come tonight.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, wasn't this a daft and reckless move on the part of the criminals? Relieving Wilson of his cushy fake job at the office was sure to arouse his suspicions. Because of Wilson's despair at losing the job he ended up recruiting Holmes, which lead to the foiling of their raid. Wouldn't it have made much more sense simply to leave Wilson to keep his membership of the League until they'd made their escape? He would eventually put two and two together once his assistant disappeared and he stopped getting £4 a week for doing essentially nothing. It seems that they put an awful lot of work into creating this whole charade in the first place. Why didn't they maintain it for just a couple more days?</p>

<p>This misstep certainly doesn't fit with Holmes's judgement that Clay was one of the brightest criminals in London.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Smart fellow, that,"" observed Holmes as we walked away. ""He is, in my judgement, the fourth smartest man in London, and for daring I am not sure that he had not a claim to be the third.""</p>

"Why is The Dreaming a simple place compared to Hell?","<p>In chapter 2 of <em>Season of Mists</em>, Lucifer says the following to Morpheus, when trying to explain his burden of ruling Hell:</p>

<p>I cannot say I see Lucifer's point here. In some of the further stories it is shown that Morpheus has lots of work in The Dreaming, and that it doesn't seem to be easy to rule at all. What does Lucifer mean by ""A simple place - compared to Hell""?</p>

"Who was Long John Silver based on?","<p>In his <a href=""http://surface.syr.edu/libassoc/206/"" rel=""noreferrer"">little-known preface</a> to <em>Treasure Island</em> (which I discovered while answering <a href=""https://literature.stackexchange.com/q/2330/17"">this question</a>), Robert Louis Stevenson wrote rather persuasively on the possibilities for how a fictional character might be inspired, whether by a stranger encountered once or by a good old friend:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And then I had an idea for John Silver from which I promised myself funds of entertainment: to take an admired friend of mine (whom the reader very likely knows and admires as much as I do), to deprive him of all his finer qualities and higher graces of temperament, to leave him with nothing but his strength, his courage, his quickness, and his magnificent geniality, and to try to express these in terms of the culture of a raw tarpaulin. Such psychical surgery is, I think, a common way of ""making character""; perhaps it is, indeed, the only way. We can put in the quaint figure that spoke a hundred words with us yesterday by the wayside; but do we know him? Our friend, with his infinite variety and flexibility, we know ― but can we put him in? Upon the first we must engraft secondary and imaginary qualities, possibly all wrong; from the second, knife in hand, we must cut away and deduct the needless arborescence of his nature; but the trunk and the few branches that remain we may at least be fairly sure of.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As soon as I read the first sentence of this quote, I wondered: <strong>who was the friend of Stevenson on whom Long John Silver was based?</strong> Silver is easily the most interesting character in <em>Treasure Island</em> - a most ""ambiguous rogue"", as I once saw him very accurately described - and it would be very interesting to know who inspired him, especially if it was a famous figure ""whom the reader very likely knows and admires"".</p>

As is the norm in many of Sanderson's <a href=""https://literature.stackexchange.com/q/1575/481"">Cosmere</a> books, the story is followed by a short section titled ""Ars Arcanum,"" with a description of some of the various kinds of magic present on that particular world of the Cosmere.

<p>While lazily skimming that section, I noticed that the final sentences read:</p>

  interest to the Cosmere, it is this one. I think there are great

<p>Most of the rest of that section was written neutrally, without a specific voice; however, those lines reveal that someone must be speaking. Those last few lines force the weary reader to wake up and pay closer attention to that which he has just read. (At least, that was the effect it had on me.)</p>

<p><strong>Who wrote those lines?</strong> Is is Mr. Sanderson himself? Is it <a href=""http://stormlightarchive.wikia.com/wiki/Hoid"" rel=""noreferrer"">Hoid</a>, the world-hopping character who finds himself in many of the Cosmere stories?

<p><sup>1</sup> I am uncertain of the author's intention, but I feel uneasy about whoever it was that wrote this. I understand that the art described, Hemalurgy, was just described in that appendix as ""not evil,"" but is known only (to me, at this time, at any rate) as an art that requires very bloody (described as ""messy"" in one of the books) murder and implanted metal spikes to function. I would feel uneasy about <em>any</em> character that found Hemalurgy interesting. (At least, more interesting than Feruchemy or Allomancy. Those are clean magics, and feel a lot more fun and wholesome.)</p>

These books include series that have already begun (eg <em>Stormlight Archives</em>, <em>Elantris</em>, <em>Mistborn</em>, and others), and some that have not yet started (eg <em>Aether of Night</em>, <em>Dark One</em>, and <em>Dragonsteel</em>).</p>

<p><strong>What order (if any) should the books be read in?</strong> Obviously, books should be read in the proper order within a world, but is there reason to read the books of one world before another?</p>

<p>I do realize that the answer to this question will change an evolve over time as more books are released, but answerers today and in the future should respond according to the best knowledge available to them at the time answered.</p>

"How did the Inklings originate?","<p>The (original) Inklings were a group of Oxford academics and writers, their most famous members including J.R.R. Tolkien, C.S. Lewis, Charles Williams, and Hugo Dyson. They used to meet regularly, often at the Eagle &amp; Child pub in Oxford, and read portions of their work to each other. Out of this group came such well-known and influential works as <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> and <em>The Chronicles of Narnia</em>.</p>

<p>My question is: <strong>how and why was this group first established?</strong> When was it set up? Who were its founding members? Was there any special motivation for it,  and how did it grow to its later glory?</p>

<p><br></p>

<p><sub>While this question doesn't directly relate to any particular work of fiction, I feel it's very interesting from the point of view of understanding not only the lives of <em>several</em> authors but also the possible effects on their works. After all, feedback received during Inklings meetings may have led to substantial changes to some of the works being read.</sub></p>

"Should I read the English translation of ""Khasākkinte Ithihāsam"" first, or the original?","<p>O. V.

The Wikipedia article, citing P. P. Ravindran as a source, says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Khasakkinte Itihasam</em> has been translated into ... English ... differing substantially from the original in its sensibility - most
  readers prefer to read it as an independent novel by Vijayan in
  English rather than seeing it as a translation. [...]</p>
  
  <p>The early Vijayan was marked by deep philosophical doubt and
  skepticism, but the later Vijayan upheld certitudes. <em>The Legends of
  Khasak</em> was written by the Vijayan of certitudes, which makes it a
  very different novel in its sensibility, in spite of being a

<hr>

<p>To underscore the difference in the works, the titles themselves are different. The Malayalam word ഇതിഹാസം is singular, and its plural is ഇതിഹാസങ്ങൾ (Ithihāsangal). Thus, the Malayalam title would be literally <em>The <strong>Legend</strong> of Khasak</em>, which can be interpreted differently from <em>The <strong>Legends</strong> of Khasak</em>. The former could mean that <em>Khasak</em> itself is of legend (like in <em>the legend of El Dorado</em>), whereas the latter implies the legends belong to Khasak (like in <em>the legends of England</em>).</p>

"Does Dr. Manhattan have free will?","<p>In Alan Moore's <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchmen""><em>Watchmen</em></a>, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Manhattan"">Doctor Manhattan</a> is a superhero with godlike powers, including the ability to view his past, present, and future simultaneously. Manhattan believes that everything that happens and everything that will happen has been predetermined, and cannot be changed.</p>

<p>My memories of the comic show him to be almost passively compliant with what he's seen and what he's ""supposed to"" do. Earlier in the series, when he's building his city on Mars, he does question ""A world grows up around me. Am I shaping it, or do its predetermined contours guide my hand?"" (<em>Watchmen</em>, chapter IV), implying that he's uncertain about the predetermination of his own actions.<br>
However, I think that he later changes his mind, and completely believes that his actions are predetermined. This is supported by several later quotes throughout the story, like the ones below (also on Mars):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Why does my perception of time distress you? [...] Everything is
  preordained. Even my responses.</p>
  
  <p>[...]</p>
  
  <p>We're all puppets, Laurie. I'm just a puppet who can see the strings.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><sup><em>Watchmen</em>, chapter IX</sup></p>

<p>He does seem to change his mind several times about his willingness to get involved in the affairs of humanity during that conversation, implying that he has (or believes himself to have) the freedom to choose, but that could simply be because he doesn't know everything all the time (either usually, or now because of the tachyon interference).</p>

<p>Most people read Doctor Manhattan as a god, partly because of his powers and partly because of his detachment and separation from humanity. (There's also that whole creation of life thing going on there at the end.) However, I think it's possible that Manhattan is simply a confused human being with more knowledge and power than he really knows what to do with. I think he's really Jon Osterman underneath his blue skin, but I'm not sure if he thinks that anymore.</p>

<p>Has Doctor Manhattan ever attempted to do anything differently from how he foresaw it? Has he tested his puppet strings? What makes him certain that he lacks free will?</p>

<p><strong>Doctor Manhattan seems to believe that all of his actions have been preordained. Is there any support for this, or its negation, in the story?</strong></p>

"What's the symbolism of the flowers in The Winter's Tale?","<p>In Act IV, Scene IV of <em>The Winter's Tale</em>, Perdita is ""mistress o' the feast"", playing hostess at the sheep-shearing feast, when King Polixenes and Camillo arrive in disguise.

<blockquote>
  <p>Give me those flowers there, Dorcas. Reverend sirs,<br>
  For you there's rosemary and rue; these keep<br>

<p>Jack, for me, simply goes mad, and the apparent lack of punishment suggests this. Fear, hunger and pride drive Jack to savagery, a way to forget all the bad things (the beast) and to have the power his pride needs. Jack's new way of life allows Roger to unleash the 'badness' in him.</p>

"Is Irene actually delusional in ""The Famine King""?","<p>At the end of ""The Famine King"", we are given the impression that Irene is delusional and that everything that relates to the windigo is actually just imagined:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Where did that bruise come from?” Az pointed to my throat. A purplish streak marked the curve below my chin. I understood why she was concerned. It resembled a self-inflicted injury, the impression of a makeshift noose. But much like the face print Mr. Botello left on my childhood window, the bruise was evidence of monsters. Real monsters. During my psychotic thrall, while I imagined wendigo conspiracies, ancient ghosts wrapped a sheet around my neck. I must have faith in my little specks of proof, because the alternative is too terrible. Above all, I fear that my life is one endless hypnopompic nightmare.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, she seems to believe that it's all real. And there's one thing that makes me suspect that she's not delusional - the opening.</p>

<p>The story opens with Irene having a sleep paralysis vision of her neighbor at her window:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Face pressed against the glass, it said, “Hey, Irene. I have a secret for you. People rarely starve like they used to.” It sounded like a shrill parody of the neighbor, Mr. Botello.</p>
  
  <p>“Go away,” I thought. “Stop.” Though young, I was accustomed to hypnopompic nightmares projected on reality, hallucinated monsters and voices without mouths.</p>
  
  <p>The silhouette withdrew, leaving marks where its skin had touched, where its hot breath had fogged, and where its nails had pawed the cold glass. As it dissolved into the 2 a.m. shadows outside, it called, “The hunger is still here.”</p>
  
  <p>[...]</p>
  
  <p>Sometimes, I heard my tattooed window repeating “the hunger, the hunger, the hunger” behind its curtain shroud.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, that same neighbor <em>did</em> at that time did commit murder suicide, killing his wife and children.</p>

<p>Also, these ""hunger"" delusions seem eerily similar to what she would later encounter after seeing the trailer for <em>The Famine King</em>.</p>

<p>Does this mean that she wasn't delusional after all, or is she too much of an unreliable narrator for us to tell? </p>

"Why does Uri get a special answer when his balloon pops?","<p>In Miriam Roth's classic Hebrew children's book <em>A Tale of Five Balloons</em> (Hebrew: מעשה בחמישה בלונים), five children each get a balloon:</p>

<p>In sequence, each child sees their balloon pop. And each is told not to cry, with the refrain, ""That's the end of every balloon"" -- ""זה סופו של כל בלון"".</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/SpEAK.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/SpEAK.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>While this is a very simple children's story, it deals very directly and explicitly with loss and impermanence; possibly even grief.</p>

<p>Which is why I'm always a little unsettled by the <em>first</em> iteration, which is a little different -- a small difference, but I feel a significant one. When Uri's green balloon pops, he isn't told to cheer up because ""that's the end of every balloon."" Instead, he's exhorted:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>אל תבכה, אורי<br>
  אל תצטער<br>

  <p>Don't cry, Uri,<br>
  Don't be sad<br>
  <strong>We'll buy you a new balloon</strong></p>

<p>This is a perfectly reasonable thing to say to a crying young child -- but it feels to me at odds with all the following repetitions. None of the other children are promised another balloon; all of them are told to accept the popping of balloons as inevitable.</p>

<p><strong>Why is Uri different from all the others?</strong> Isn't it odd to break the story structure in this one, initial instance? Is there thematic significance here; does this somehow tie into the theme?</p>

  <p>CAESAR: <strong>Et tu, Brute! Then fall, Caesar.</strong></p>
  
  <p>Dies</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For some reason, the last part of the phrase is always left out when discussing Caesar's death. It is very widely believed that <em>Et tu, Brute?</em> were the last words of Caesar*, and is often used as a joke in common speech. Even Wikipedia ignores the last part, and has an <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Et_tu,_Brute%3F"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">entire page on Et tu, Brute?</a> with no mention of the subsequent phrase.</p>

<p>The reason I bring it up is that I think it brings up a different interpretation of the sentiment Shakespeare was trying to convey. ""Et tu, Brute?"" sounds like an accusatory statement of betrayal, similar to ""how dare you!"" Even Wikipedia mentions this interpretation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It has been argued that the phrase can be interpreted as a curse or
  warning</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On the other hand, the addition of ""Then fall Caesar"", at least in my opinion, makes it sound more like a disappointment - similar to ""how could you?"" In a sense, Caesar believes that the fact that Brutus has taken the side against him is reason enough for Caesar to not fight back against his impending death. This is, of course, my interpretation. </p>

<p>Nonetheless, I don't understand why the second part of the phrase is never mentioned, even in literary discussions. Is it just because Latin sounds cooler?</p>

<hr>

<p><em>(To be clear, I'm talking about the Shakespeare version of the story, and not the actual series of events. There's some evidence to suggest that Caesar's actual last words may have been ""And you, son?"" (translated), but that doesn't change the point of the question.)</em></p>

Trading on the image of the block again, the eternalist takes reality to be one huge block of everything that ever was and will be.

Oblivious to his daughter's pain throughout, Rappaccini was a fairly early example of what was to become a common literary and cinematic archetype: the cold-hearted scientific genius whose human empathy is decapacitated by an all-consuming lust for knowledge. </p>

<p>I am interested in tracing the evolution of this Rappaccini literary archetype, especially in relation to the Scientific Revolution in Europe that began 250 or so years before Hawthorne penned his short tale. Specifically:</p>

<ul>
<li>Are there instances of the archetype in literature prior to the
Scientific Revolution? (Non-European literatures included.)</li>
<li>What are the earliest examples of the archetype appearing in
literature after the start of the Scientific Revolution?</li>
<li>Did the frequency of the archetype's appearances in literature
increase as the Scientific Revolution progressed between the 17th and
19th centuries?</li>
</ul>

<p>I am not well-read enough to begin answering these questions, and they've been itching me since reading  Hawthorne's story a few weeks ago. I'll be grateful for any light cast on them. </p>

"What happens to Crow after communion?","<p>In ""Crow Communes"", The lines following the communion - after Crow tore off a mouthful of God - describes the results of this act, in two phases.</p>

<p>At first, Crow seems unsure of what his act might achieve:</p>

"What is steampunk?","<p>I've long been confused about what exactly comprises the <strong>steampunk</strong> genre. Of course I realise that genres aren't usually things for which one can pin down exact definitions, but I don't even have a proper 'feel' for the steampunk genre or where its boundaries are.</p>

<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steampunk"" rel=""noreferrer"">The Wikipedia article</a> is full of <code>citation-needed</code> notes, and I'm somewhat suspicious of its attempts at defining the genre. For example, it cites <strong>steam power</strong> as being a required part of steampunk stories (which also makes sense given the name <em>steam</em>punk, of course), but I'm pretty sure that many 'steampunk' things are actually based on other technologies such as clockwork: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFCuE5rHbPA"" rel=""noreferrer"">gears are a common device used to make objects steampunky</a>. But I'm not really sure where else to look to get a proper idea (if not a rigorous definition) of what it means to be steampunk.</p>

<h3><strong>What <em>is</em> steampunk, really? What makes a work of literature steampunk or not?</strong></h3>

"In Finnegans Wake, surely the dreamer is this character?","<p>As I see it, <em>Finnegans Wake</em> has two main sections, namely Section A (“dreamland” [1-617.29]) and Section B (“anna’s interior monologue” [617.30-628]). Section A and Section B are my terms and there is no structural division between A and B. Structurally, the novel has Parts I - IV, with my Section A being the last 10 pages of Part IV <em>(Part IV has only a single chapter beginning on page 593)</em>. </p>

<p>As with <em>Ulysses</em>, <em>Finnegans Wake</em> ends with a woman’s interior monologue as she just awakes (Section B). A reader of <em>Ulysses</em> will find Section B “easy” familiar reading. There are a few strangenesses encountered, especially near the beginning of the monologue, i.e., when Anna is closer to sleep. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Soft morning, city! Lsp! I am leafy speafing. Lpf! Folty and folty all the nights have falled on to long my hair. Not a sound, falling. Lispn! No wind no word. Only a leaf, just a leaf and then leaves.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Joyce has noticed that such ""leafy speafing"" is more consistent with our own interior “monologues” than the language that he used for Molly (just listen to yourself). Joyce renders a better interior monologue in <em>Finnegans Wake</em> than in <em>Ulysses</em>. But a good old-fashion modernist interior monologue nonetheless. Ten pages of devastating beautiful fluid sensible reading. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But I’m loothing them that’s here and all I lothe. Loonely in me loneness. For all their faults. I am passing out. O<br>
  bitter ending! I’ll slip away before they’re up. They’ll never see. Nor know. Nor miss me. And it’s old and old it’s sad and old it’s sad and weary I go back to you, my cold father, my cold mad father, my cold mad feary father, till the near sight of the mere size of him, the moyles and moyles of it, moananoaning, makes me<br>
  seasilt saltsick and I rush, my only, into your arms.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Section A, on the other hand, consists of 617 pages with not one “readable” paragraph. With familiarity, Part I is fairly ""clear"", but as the night progresses, so the text becomes murkier and murkier.  </p>

<p>The universe of Section A is that place you find yourself when dreaming. It is also that place you find yourself when you are having a two way argument with your “partner”, entirely in your head, while washing the dishes alone after the divorce. The characters are “you”, and your “partners” (who have many forms and voices all “spoken” by you), and all the characters from all your dreams, and waking life (""heliopolis""), days stacked upon nights stacked upon days, etc. The “narrators” too are of that world. </p>

<p>It is argued as to who is the dreamer. From my reading of texts about <em>Finnegans Wake</em>, many feel there is one dreamer, although some prefer “us all as the dreamer” (tenable) or even a few multiple dreamers (less tenable). </p>

<p><strong>If there is a unique dreamer, then who is it?</strong> </p>

<p>Before I got to the end I was betting on Issy (I). <em>[I didn’t think a man could dream the wake. The dreamer knows girls and women from the inside. The dreamer knows so much sexual abuse from the inside.]</em></p>

<p>On the other hand, all texts that I have read posit a male dreamer (Kevin or HCE).  </p>

<p>But then Section A ends with dawn breaking and “the smog lofting”. “The grand fooneral will now shortly occur” [617]. And then, Anna’s monologue, with numerous consistent referents to the previous 617 page dream world.    </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Surely the dreamer is</strong>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> -  Anna? </p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>

<p>Surely the structure is such that this character is obviously the dreamer, and before arguing <em>any</em> other position (Kevin, us all, etc) one would first have defeat the simplest position <em>(Occam's razor: this character dreams the wake)</em>? One would also have to explain who dreams Section B, or how Section B is located ontologically.</p>

<p>The kind of answer I am looking for is something like ""This character cannot be the dreamer since..."" or ""It is much more likely that... since..."". I would also be interested in any references to arguments that this character is or is not the dreamer. </p>

<p>[... The pure uninterrupted interior monologue begins 619.20. 617.30-619.19 is a transition, but more <em>Ulysses</em> than <em>Finnegans Wake</em> ...]</p>

"Repetition in Faulkner's ""As I Lay Dying""","<p>While reading As I Lay Dying, I noticed that the characters repeat certain phrases a great deal. </p>

<p>Here's an example from one of Tull's chapters which shows the same two phrases recurring three times in a short space of the text.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>That boy comes up the hill. He is carrying a fish <strong>nigh long as he is</strong>. He slings it to the ground and grunts ""Hah"" and spits over his shoulder like a man. </p>
  
  <p>Durn <strong>nigh long as he is</strong>. </p>
  
  <p>""What's that?"" I say. ""A hog? Where'd you get it?"" </p>
  
  <p>...</p>
  
  <p>""<strong>You clean that fish</strong>,"" Anse says. Vardaman stops. ""Why cant Dewey Dell clean it?"" he says. </p>
  
  <p>""<strong>You clean that fish,</strong>"" Anse says. </p>
  
  <p>""Aw, pa,"" Vardaman says. </p>
  
  <p>""<strong>You clean it</strong>,"" Anse says. He dont look around. Vardaman comes back and picks up the fish. .... He goes on around the house, toting it in both arms like a armful of wood, it overlapping him on both ends, head and tail. <strong>Durn nigh big as he is</strong>. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>These repetitions are not unique to Tull but occur in other chapters narrated by other characters (see the previous chapter where Dewey Dell repeats ""without the words"" for example). </p>

<p>Because they are phrases in thought and speech, they seem to be fundamentally different to, although mirroring, the descriptive repetition that occurs elsewhere in the book.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It will give her confidence and comfort. I go on to the house, followed by the <strong>Chuck. Chuck. Chuck.</strong> of the adze. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why does Faulkner have his characters repeat themselves so often? Is it a common speech pattern in the Southern US dialect he's seeking to mimic, or are there deeper meanings here, perhaps related to the descriptive repetition?</p>

"Explain the bidding in ‘The Unprincipled Affair of the Practical Joker’","<p>The short story ‘<a href=""http://gutenberg.ca/ebooks/sayersdl-treasury/sayersdl-treasury-00-h-dir/sayersdl-treasury-00-h.html#Page_191"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The Unprincipled Affair of the Practical Joker</a>’ by Dorothy L. Sayers was collected in <em>Lord Peter Views the Body</em> (Gollancz, 1928). In this extract the characters are playing a game of bridge:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‘Whatever has induced you, my dear boy,’ said Colonel Marchbanks, ‘to take up with that very objectionable fellow Melville?’</p>
  
  <p>‘<strong>Diamonds</strong>,’ said Lord Peter. ‘Do you find him so, really?’</p>
  
  <p>‘Perfectly dreadful man,’ said the Hon. Frederick Arbuthnot. ‘<strong>Hearts</strong>. What did you want to go and get him a room here for? This used to be a quite decent club.’</p>
  
  <p>‘Two clubs?’ said Sir Impey Biggs, who had been ordering a whisky, and had only caught the last word.</p>
  
  <p>‘No, no, one heart.’</p>
  
  <p>‘I beg your pardon. Well, partner, how about <strong>spades</strong>? Perfectly good suit.’ </p>
  
  <p>‘<strong>Pass</strong>,’ said the Colonel. ‘I don’t know what the Army’s coming to nowadays.’</p>
  
  <p>‘<strong>No trumps</strong>,’ said Wimsey. ‘It’s all right, children. Trust your Uncle Pete. Come on, Freddy, how many of those hearts are you going to shout for?’</p>
  
  <p>‘None, the Colonel havin’ let me down so ’orrid,’ said the Hon. Freddy.</p>
  
  <p>‘Cautious blighter. All content? Righty-ho! Bring out your dead, partner. Oh, very pretty indeed. We’ll make it a slam this time.’</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The puzzle here is to explain the bidding, which I’ve highlighted.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>If Lord Peter and Sir Impey have the cards for a slam, how come they stopped bidding at one no trump?</p></li>
<li><p>According to the <a href=""https://cdn.acbl.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Laws-of-Rubber-Bridge.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">modern laws of rubber bridge</a>, a bid “names both a level, from one to seven, and a denomination”. So Lord Peter’s opening bid of “diamonds” would today be given as “one diamond” and Freddy’s “hearts” as “one heart”. Was it the norm in the 1920s to omit the “one”, as in the dialogue above?</p>

<p>By comparison, in Agatha Christie’s <em>Cards on the Table</em> (1936), the bidding is in the modern form, in this respect at least:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There they were well down to it, their faces serious, the bids coming quickly. ‘<strong>One heart</strong>.’ ‘Pass.’ ‘Three clubs.’ ‘Three spades.’ ‘Four diamonds.’ ‘Double.’ ‘Four hearts.’</p>

<p>There are various critical interpretations as to what does the over-usage of the word ""smile"" mean, some say it is because she wanted to hide her feelings of sadness, while some say she was out of words.

<p><strong>Is ""The Light(adjective) Fantastic(noun)"" a correct meaning/translation of the title? If so, does ""Fantastic(noun)"" here mean fiction?</strong></p>

<p>Investigating this only made me more confused:</p>

<p>Reading the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Light_Fantastic"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">wikipedia page</a>, the title of the book is a quote from ""L'Allegro"" by John Milton, but <a href=""https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/L%27Allegro"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">there</a> it is used like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Come, and trip it, as you go, 
  On the <strong>light fantastic toe</strong>; And in thy
  right hand lead with thee</p>

<p>So is it used there as ""The Light(adjective) Fantastic(adjective)""?.</p>

<p>A definition for ""Fantastic(noun)"" <a href=""https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/fantastic#Noun"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">yields</a> ""A fanciful or whimsical person."" so this could refer to one of MCs of the book (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rincewind"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Rincewind</a>?).

"What does H. G.

When he wanted to say he had a sixpenny- <strong>ha'penny longcloth to sell</strong>, he put it thus to startled customers: ""<strong>Can DO you one, six half if y' like</strong>.""He always omitted pronouns and articles and so forth; it seemed to him the very essence of the efficiently businesslike. </p>

<p>I recognize that these expressions are idiosyncratic to Shalford, and are supposed to give him character. But being a non-native speaker of English I'm having a hard time understanding their meanings. What does Shalford mean by ""Can DO you one, six half if y'like"", and is the ""ha' penny"" supposed to be an abbreviation of ""had a sixpenny""? There have been quite a few such colloquial shortenings of sounds in this book up until this point but this is the first one that's giving me any real trouble. Can anyone help? Thanks!</p>

"Children’s story: boy accidentally hits bird with stone and nurses back to health. man hurts it on purpose nurses it back to get gift","<p>A long time I read a story where a young boy accidentally hits a bird (with a stone I think). He runs over to find it and nurses it back to health. It flies away and eventually brings him back some sort of gift (a bag of gold maybe?). A man sees this happen and decides to try the same thing. He hits the bird on purpose and nurses it back to health. However, the bird knew his intentions and did not bring him a gift but instead punished him in some way. I’m not sure where I read this story but I want to know how it ends and I would very much like to find it. Is anybody familiar with it or may have some resource that could help me find it?</p>

"Understanding the 2018 and 2019 Nobel prizes","<p>When someone is awarded the Nobel prize, the Nobel committee always gives a short description of their achievement.</p>

<p>This year, two prizes were awarded (for 2019 and 2018):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Peter Handke</p>
  
  <p>“for an influential work that with linguistic ingenuity has explored the periphery and the specificity of human experience.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Olga Tokarczuk</p>
  
  <p>“for a narrative imagination that with encyclopedic passion represents the crossing of boundaries as a form of life.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can make some sense of the description of Handke's achievement, but not of Tokarczuk's. Can someone explain it in layman's terms?</p>

<p>I can't make sense of terms like ""encyclopedic passion"". ""Encyclopedic knowlegde"" is a common phrase that I understand. Encyclopedias are the books where one finds the most knowledge. So this term makes sense to describe someone who has vast knowledge. But I do not understand the relationship between encylopedias and passion.</p>

<p>I also don't understand ""crossing of boundaries as a form of life"".  Does she write about other forms of life than humans? Or is this a metaphor that only makes sense with some background knowledge? ""Crossing of boundaries"" makes some sense as a metaphor to me, but it is awfully nonspecific. Perhaps I'd understand it if I had read her books.</p>

<p>Please explain for a layman who is not well versed in abstract literature, but is excited about the Nobel prize and is interested in the getting to know the work of the prize recipients.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>These lyrics confuse me slightly. Invoking the ""thief,"" I'm pretty sure, cannot be only for the purpose of creating an example of someone who's unafraid -- why not ""hero,"" or any other person who is unafraid? (The word is also the title of the song, perhaps hinting at something...more?)</p>

<p>Additionally, the word ""thief"" can carry a negative connotation, and so (at least for me) distracts from the request to ""take me back"" to an earlier, simpler, and more naive time ""when I believed."" Also, ""all the heights/that I could reach"" make more sense when connected to almost any other profession that requires bravery from its practitioners.</p>

<hr>

<p>My understanding of the song is that the singer is speaking to someone who doesn't understand the darkness that can exist in the world, for people who experienced things than the listener had not, as in the first stanza:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If only you<br>
  You could see<br>
  The darkest place that you could be<br>
  Oh maybe then you'd understand<br>
  From desert heat to cobbled streets<br>
  From broken home to the city beat<br>
  There's so much more than you could know  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is followed immediately by the chorus: ""So take me back..."" I interpret this as a hope or prayer that the singer can go back to a simpler time, so that he and the listener will be on the same level again. (He does <em>not</em> ask that the listener gain negative life experiences.) I <em>don't</em> think that ""thief"" is a good example of someone who has that earlier and lighter frame of mind that the speaker wishes to return to. The thief may be unafraid, but that mindset is probably not the solution that the speaker seeks from the ""darkest place that you could be.""</p>

<p><strong>So, why use the word ""thief"" in ""Thief""?</strong></p>

"Who is the speaker in ""The Unreturning""?","<p>Wilfred Owen's poem ""The Unreturning"" (<a href=""http://markandrewholmes.com/theunreturning.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">full text here</a>) seems remarkably free of context - it never says explicitly what it's about, what's happening, which ""dead"" are being talked about, who or what are ""unreturning"", or what the point of the poem is. Therefore I'm hoping that this is a poem which will lend itself well to close reading, and that our understanding of it will be greatly increased by doing so.</p>

<p>One of the first questions this poem made me ask is: <strong>who is the narrator?</strong> The poem is written in the first person in at least a couple of places:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There watched I for the Dead; but no ghost woke.<br>
  Each one whom Life exiled I named and called.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This makes it sound like the narrator might be God, calling the dead as they leave life ...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I dreaded even a heaven with doors so chained.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>... but this suggests that the narrator fears heaven, which surely God would not.</p>

<p>So I can't really work it out. <strong>Who is the first-person speaker?</strong></p>

  <p>The most frequently encountered metre of English verse is the iambic pentameter, in which the metrical norm is five iambic feet per line, though metrical substitution is common and rhythmic variations practically inexhaustible. John Milton's Paradise Lost, most sonnets, and much else besides in English are written in iambic pentameter. Lines of unrhymed iambic pentameter are commonly known as blank verse. Blank verse in the English language is most famously represented in the plays of William Shakespeare and the great works of Milton, though Tennyson (Ulysses, The Princess) and Wordsworth (The Prelude) also make notable use of it.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Here are my takeaways:</p>

<ul>
<li>Athena is obviously very affectionate for Odysseus. Regardless of whether they have any history, I’m suspecting that Athena cares for him as he is essentially her male/mortal counterpart-he is known as a very wise/cunning man, and known for his valor in war, while Athena is the goddess of wisdom and battle. I suspect that she is affectionate for him in the same way that a master is affectionate for their skilled apprentice, although I don’t know how to explicitly support this claim with this passage</li>
<li>The Gods seem to favor punishment/use violence as a means for resolving issues. Zeus looks at most humans as corrupt, using Aegisthus as an example. Athena, on the other hand, seems to believe that not all humans are bad, and seeks a way to help them, in this passage she advocates for helping Odysseus, and later on she assists Telemachus in finding his father, as well as helping comfort Penelope, reassuring her that her son was in good hands. The gods seem to have traits typically assigned to their respective gender, the male gods being violent, and the goddesses being kind and compassionate. This, along with other evidence like Zeus deciding to help free Odysseus behind Poseidon’s back, justifying it with essentially “we can overpower him” shows that the gods aren’t necessarily these enlighten beings, they seem to have many of the traits/flaws characteristic to humans</li>
<li>I also noticed how Athena, despite having traits commonly possessed by women, acts as a fatherly figure to Telemachus. She guides him on this journey, trying to help him achieve manhood by telling him he has to kill the suitors, be confident, and brave. This isn’t entirely related to the passage but ties into my first observation, although I’m not really certain what the significance of this is.</li>
<li>I noticed how Zeus seems to be a fairly poor leader. Almost immediately after Athena makes her point Zeus says that the gods have not freed Odysseus because of Poseidon, but then decides that they should go against him with his only reasoning being that if Poseidon acts out against it, the other gods could overpower him. It seems as if not much has to be said to convince him, however this is the only example I have so far.</li>
</ul>

<p>Are my takeaways accurate? I feel like there’s not many more observations I can make, though I feel like there’s so much more this passage says about Athena and the gods as a whole. I feel as if some parts of my takeaways are already reaches and don’t know what else is so significant about it. Did I hit on any good points?</p>

"Regarding a conversation between Miss. Price, Miss. Crawford and Edmund in Mansfield Park by Jane Austen","<p>I am reading chapter 11 of Mansfield Park by Jane Austen. There is a conversation going on between Fanny, Edmund, and Mrs. Crawford. In the book the conversation is going on without explicitly mentioning who is the speaker. Since there are three speakers, I am unable to follow who is speaking the following sentences. If anyone could help me regarding who is speaking which sentence, it would be of great help.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Edmund looked round at Mr. Rushworth too, but had nothing to say.</p>
  
  <p>""Your father's return will be a very interesting event.""</p>
  
  <p>""It will, indeed, after such an absence; an absence not only long, but
  including so many dangers.""</p>
  
  <p>""It will be the forerunner also of other interesting events: your
  sister's marriage, and your taking orders.""</p>
  
  <p>""Yes.""</p>
  
  <p>""Don't be affronted,"" said she, laughing, ""but it does put me in mind
  of some of the old heathen heroes, who, after performing great
  exploits in a foreign land, offered sacrifices to the gods on their
  safe return.""</p>
  
  <p>""There is no sacrifice in the case,"" replied Edmund, with a serious
  smile, and glancing at the pianoforte again; ""it is entirely her own
  doing.""</p>
  
  <p>""Oh yes I know it is. I was merely joking. She has done no more than
  what every young woman would do; and I have no doubt of her being
  extremely happy. My other sacrifice, of course, you do not
  understand.""</p>
  
  <p>""My taking orders, I assure you, is quite as voluntary as Maria's
  marrying."" ""It is fortunate that your inclination and your father's
  convenience should accord so well. There is a very good living kept
  for you, I understand, hereabouts.""</p>
  
  <p>""Which you suppose has biassed me?""</p>
  
  <p>""But that I am sure it has not,"" cried Fanny.</p>
  
  <p>""Thank you for your good word, Fanny, but it is more than I would
  affirm myself. On the contrary, the knowing that there was such a
  provision for me probably did bias me. Nor can I think it wrong that
  it should. There was no natural disinclination to be overcome, and I
  see no reason why a man should make a worse clergyman for knowing that
  he will have a competence early in life. I was in safe hands. I hope I
  should not have been influenced myself in a wrong way, and I am sure
  my father was too conscientious to have allowed it. I have no doubt
  that I was biased, but I think it was blamelessly.""</p>
  
  <p>""It is the same sort of thing,"" said Fanny, after a short pause, ""as
  for the son of an admiral to go into the navy, or the son of a general
  to be in the army, and nobody sees anything wrong in that. Nobody
  wonders that they should prefer the line where their friends can serve
  them best, or suspects them to be less in earnest in it than they
  appear.""</p>
  
  <p>""No, my dear Miss Price, and for reasons good. The profession, either
  navy or army, is its own justification. It has everything in its
  favour: heroism, danger, bustle, fashion. Soldiers and sailors are
  always acceptable in society. Nobody can wonder that men are soldiers
  and sailors.""</p>
  
  <p>""But the motives of a man who takes orders with the certainty of
  preferment may be fairly suspected, you think?"" said Edmund. ""To be
  justified in your eyes, he must do it in the most complete uncertainty
  of any provision.""</p>
  
  <p>""What! take orders without a living! No; that is madness indeed;
  absolute madness.""</p>
  
  <p>""Shall I ask you how the church is to be filled, if a man is neither
  to take orders with a living nor without? No; for you certainly would
  not know what to say. But I must beg some advantage to the clergyman
  from your own argument. As he cannot be influenced by those feelings
  which you rank highly as temptation and reward to the soldier and
  sailor in their choice of a profession, as heroism, and noise, and
  fashion, are all against him, he ought to be less liable to the
  suspicion of wanting sincerity or good intentions in the choice of
  his.""</p>
  
  <p>""Oh! no doubt he is very sincere in preferring an income ready made,
  to the trouble of working for one; and has the best intentions of
  doing nothing all the rest of his days but eat, drink, and grow fat.
  It is indolence, Mr. Bertram, indeed. Indolence and love of ease; a
  want of all laudable ambition, of taste for good company, or of
  inclination to take the trouble of being agreeable, which make men
  clergymen. A clergyman has nothing to do but be slovenly and
  selfish—read the newspaper, watch the weather, and quarrel with his
  wife. His curate does all the work, and the business of his own life
  is to dine.""</p>
  
  <p>""There are such clergymen, no doubt, but I think they are not so
  common as to justify Miss Crawford in esteeming it their general
  character. I suspect that in this comprehensive and (may I say)
  commonplace censure, you are not judging from yourself, but from
  prejudiced persons, whose opinions you have been in the habit of
  hearing. It is impossible that your own observation can have given you
  much knowledge of the clergy. You can have been personally acquainted
  with very few of a set of men you condemn so conclusively. You are
  speaking what you have been told at your uncle's table.""</p>
  
  <p>""I speak what appears to me the general opinion; and where an opinion
  is general, it is usually correct. Though I have not seen much of the
  domestic lives of clergymen, it is seen by too many to leave any
  deficiency of information.""</p>
  
  <p>""Where any one body of educated men, of whatever denomination, are
  condemned indiscriminately, there must be a deficiency of information,
  or (smiling) of something else. Your uncle, and his brother admirals,
  perhaps knew little of clergymen beyond the chaplains whom, good or
  bad, they were always wishing away.""</p>
  
  <p>""Poor William! He has met with great kindness from the chaplain of the
  Antwerp,"" was a tender apostrophe of Fanny's, very much to the purpose
  of her own feelings if not of the conversation.</p>
  
  <p>""I have been so little addicted to take my opinions from my uncle,""
  said Miss Crawford, ""that I can hardly suppose—and since you push me
  so hard, I must observe, that I am not entirely without the means of
  seeing what clergymen are, being at this present time the guest of my
  own brother, Dr. Grant. And though Dr. Grant is most kind and obliging
  to me, and though he is really a gentleman, and, I dare say, a good
  scholar and clever, and often preaches good sermons, and is very
  respectable, I see him to be an indolent, selfish bon vivant, who must
  have his palate consulted in everything; who will not stir a finger
  for the convenience of any one; and who, moreover, if the cook makes a
  blunder, is out of humour with his excellent wife. To own the truth,
  Henry and I were partly driven out this very evening by a
  disappointment about a green goose, which he could not get the better
  of. My poor sister was forced to stay and bear it.""</p>
  
  <p>""I do not wonder at your disapprobation, upon my word. It is a great
  defect of temper, made worse by a very faulty habit of
  self-indulgence; and to see your sister suffering from it must be
  exceedingly painful to such feelings as yours. Fanny, it goes against
  us. We cannot attempt to defend Dr. Grant.""</p>
  
  <p>""No,"" replied Fanny, ""but we need not give up his profession for all
  that; because, whatever profession Dr. Grant had chosen, he would have
  taken a—not a good temper into it; and as he must, either in the navy
  or army, have had a great many more people under his command than he
  has now, I think more would have been made unhappy by him as a sailor
  or soldier than as a clergyman. Besides, I cannot but suppose that
  whatever there may be to wish otherwise in Dr. Grant would have been
  in a greater danger of becoming worse in a more active and worldly
  profession, where he would have had less time and obligation—where he
  might have escaped that knowledge of himself, the frequency, at least,
  of that knowledge which it is impossible he should escape as he is
  now. A man—a sensible man like Dr. Grant, cannot be in the habit of
  teaching others their duty every week, cannot go to church twice every
  Sunday, and preach such very good sermons in so good a manner as he
  does, without being the better for it himself. It must make him think;
  and I have no doubt that he oftener endeavours to restrain himself
  than he would if he had been anything but a clergyman.""</p>
  
  <p>""We cannot prove to the contrary, to be sure; but I wish you a better
  fate, Miss Price, than to be the wife of a man whose amiableness
  depends upon his own sermons; for though he may preach himself into a
  good-humour every Sunday, it will be bad enough to have him
  quarrelling about green geese from Monday morning till Saturday
  night.""</p>
  
  <p>""I think the man who could often quarrel with Fanny,"" said Edmund
  affectionately, ""must be beyond the reach of any sermons."" Fanny
  turned farther into the window; and Miss Crawford had only time to
  say, in a pleasant manner, ""I fancy Miss Price has been more used to
  deserve praise than to hear it""; when, being earnestly invited by the
  Miss Bertrams to join in a glee, she tripped off to the instrument,
  leaving Edmund looking after her in an ecstasy of admiration of all
  her many virtues, from her obliging manners down to her light and
  graceful tread.</p>

"What does it mean when Ralph is thinking about Piggy's death in Lord of the Flies by Golding","<p>I have a question about this quote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""He yearned for a bed and sheets- but the only whiteness here was the slow spilt milk, luminous round the rock forty feet below, where Piggy had fallen. Piggy was everywhere, was on this neck, was become terrible in darkness and death.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think the ""spilt milk"" is referring to a problem, but what does it mean by whiteness? I guess it is related to the bed and sheet, does it refer to the cleanliness that civilization has?</p>

<p>That last sentence is what is mainly confusing me. ""Piggy was everywhere"" probably means that Ralph's mind is filled with Piggy, ""was on this neck"" probably refers to Piggy being on that neck of land, but what does Golding mean by ""was become terrible in darkness and death""?</p>

"Difference between Indian and English lyricism besides language?","<p>Suppose we sing or rap about dark themes (depression, alcohol, drugs, violence, sex) similar to modern American music from 1970-present day in Hindi, Punjabi, Tamil, or Malayalam over Indian classical-Rock, Pop or Hip Hop fusion. Would the lyrics sound as modern; sounding similar in sound/delivery, flow/melody, and meaning as English lyrics? Could it be as common (used in everyday conversation), complex (lyrical), explicit (swearing, slang), or controversial? </p>

<p>I say this because I'm an American from Indian Origin. Dark themes hardly exist in Indian music and if it does it's extremely poetic with references to nature (sun, flower, moon), dresses (veils, saris, fabric), organs (heart, liver) and gods. Their music remains very ancient and hardly modernized to this day.</p>

<p>Some songs with dark themes (I read English translations) exist in India but few are well-known :</p>

<p>In Independent music there is a rise in rock (apocalyptic themes, depression) and rap (struggle, representing neighborhood, alcohol, sexual references to women):</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqFy-SgYQho"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Bandeh (Hindi)</a> (Apocalyptic)</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bK5dzwhu-I"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Mere Gully mein</a> (Initimidation, Representing Neighborhood, Violence)</p>

<p>But some of these songs hardly contain elements of Indian classical music so it’s hard to say it’s musically “familiar” to Indian ears.</p>

<p>Most of these songs use poetic lyricism but we see some songs (Represent, Mere Gully Mein) use more common everyday language. However, the most well-known rap songs (char bottle vodka) refer to alcohol and women but are not as lyrically sophisticated (dull compared to English).</p>

<p>So can Hindi lyricism sound as modern (using dark themes) as English over a beat.</p>

"What does ""ceremony of innocence"" mean In ""The Second Coming""?","<p><a href=""https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43290/the-second-coming"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""> The Second Coming</a> by W.B. Yeats:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Turning and turning in the widening gyre<br>
  The falcon cannot hear the falconer;<br>
  Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;<br>
  Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,<br>
  The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere<br>
  The ceremony of innocence is drowned;<br>
  The best lack all conviction, while the worst<br>
  Are full of passionate intensity.  </p>
  
  <p>Surely some revelation is at hand;<br>
  Surely the Second Coming is at hand.<br>
  The Second Coming! Hardly are those words out<br>
  When a vast image out of Spiritus Mundi<br>
  Troubles my sight: somewhere in sands of the desert<br>
  A shape with lion body and the head of a man,<br>
  A gaze blank and pitiless as the sun,<br>
  Is moving its slow thighs, while all about it<br>
  Reel shadows of the indignant desert birds.<br>
  The darkness drops again; but now I know<br>
  That twenty centuries of stony sleep<br>
  Were vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle,<br>
  And what rough beast, its hour come round at last,<br>
  Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>What does the phrase ""The ceremony of innocence"" mean here? From a quick look online, one interpretation I found is that the ceremony of innocence refers to christian baptism, but that doesn't sound quite right to me (how do you drown an actual ceremony?). </p>

<p>One idea I had is that maybe ""ceremony of innocence"" refers to people pretending to be innocent, so the lines ""The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere\
The ceremony of innocence is drowned;""
mean that humanities evil deeds (the blood-dimmed tide) are so numerous that there is no point for anyone to pretend to be innocent.</p>

"What does ""get to"" mean in ""Hillbilly Elegy""?","<p>I have been reading a book titled ""Hillbilly Elegy,"" and I have its Korean translation too. But at some part, especially which I am curious about in meaning, the translation seems so uncertain, so I want someone who is a native English speaker to let me know what this ""get to"" means here.</p>

<p>If you already read the book, it might be much better. But no problem. Here is part of the book, which will help you understand the meaning.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>... Most of this tradition was far from child appropriate. Almost all of it involved the kind of violence that should land someone in jail. Much of it centered on how the county in which Jackson was situated--Breathitt--earned its alliterative nickname, ""Bloody Breathitt."" There were many expectations, but they all had one theme: The people of Breathitt hated certain things, and they didn't need the law to snuff them out.</p>
  
  <p>One of the most common tales of Breathitt's gore revolved around an older man in town who was accused of raping a young girl. Mamaw told me that, days before his trial, the man was found facedown in a local lake with sixteen bullet wounds in his back. The authorities never investigated the murder, and the only mention of the incident appeared in the local newspaper on the morning his body was discovered. In an admirable display of journalistic pith, the paper reported: ""Man found dead. Foul play expected."" ""Foul play expected?"" <strong>my grandmother would roar</strong>. ""You're goddamned right. Bloody Breathitt <strong>got to</strong> that son of a bitch."" ]</p>

<p>In Korean version, it is translated into like ""Significant parts of an entire region moved north along plants(or factories)"" or ""Significant parts of an entire region moved north, looking for plants(or factories).""</p>

"Meaning of the prose of Monsieur Jourdain","<p>I just stumbled across the expression in Molière's <em>Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme</em> of Monsieur Jourdain having been speaking prose for all of his life.</p>

<p>As far as I understand this is used today as a metaphor (correct rhetoric figure?) for if someone is doing something of high achievement without noticing himself. The point which I do not understand is the bit that it's ""prose"" what he is speaking. According to my knowledge prose is anything except the bound language of lyrics. So it includes the normal everyday spoken language, doesn't it? In this understanding I would think that the figure of Monsieur Jourdain discovering that he spoke prose is a mere joke without noticing is that he actually just discovered an euphemism for a plain common thing, but his fascination for the sound of the euphemic expression is larger than his understanding of the meaning.</p>

<p>Apparently my understanding is in mismatch with the common usage, so I wonder what am I missing?</p>

"Meaning of some phrases and lines in ""Quality"" by John Galsworthy","<p>I am reading ""Quality"" by John Galsworthy and there are some phrases and lines which I could not grasp. I thought that this site would be the perfect place to ask this question. Below are some lines from the story from the beginning.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I knew him from the days of my extreme youth, because he made my father's boots; inhabiting with his elder brother two little shops let into one, in a small by-street--now no more, but then most fashionably placed in the West End.</p>
  
  <p>That tenement had a certain quiet distinction; there was no sign upon its face that he made for any of the Royal Family--merely his own German name of Gessler Brothers; and in the window a few pairs of boots.</p>
  
  <p>I remember that it always troubled me to account for those unvarying boots in the window, for he made only what was ordered, reaching nothing down, and it seemed so inconceivable that what he made could ever have failed to fit. Had he bought them to put there? That, too, seemed inconceivable. He would never have tolerated in his house leather on which he had not worked himself.</p>
  
  <p>Besides, they were too beautiful--the pair of pumps, so inexpressibly slim, the patent leathers with cloth tops, making water come into one's mouth, the tall brown riding boots with marvelous sooty glow, as if, though new, they had been worn a hundred years. Those pairs could only have been made by one who saw before him the Soul of Boot--so truly were they prototypes incarnating the very spirit of all foot-gear. </p>
  
  <p>These thoughts, of course, came to me later, though even when I was promoted to him, at the age of perhaps fourteen, some inkling haunted me of the dignity of himself and brother. For to make boots--such boots as he made--seemed to me then, and still seems to me, mysterious and wonderful.</p>

<li><p>What does the phrase ""two little shops let into one"" mean? Does it mean that Does it mean that the shop consisted of two ""shops"" and there was one entrance into the shop?</p></li>
<li><p>What does the phrase ""reaching nothing down"" mean? I think it means that he did not make more shoes than required, that is, he only made what was required.</p></li>
<li><p>What does ""the tall brown riding boots with marvelous sooty glow, as if, though new, they had been worn a hundred years"" mean? I think it means that by looking at those shoes one could understand that the shoes were the epitome of endurance.</p></li>
<li><p>What does ""These thoughts, of course, came to me later, though even when I was promoted to him, at the age of perhaps fourteen, some inkling haunted me of the dignity of himself and brother."" mean? I am unsure of its meaning.</p></li>
<li><p>What does ""When one grew old and wild and ran up bills, one somehow never ran them up with Gessler Brothers. It would not have seemed becoming to go in there and stretch out one’s foot to that blue iron-spectacled glance, owing him for more than — say — two pairs, just the comfortable reassurance that one was still his client."" mean? I think that the first sentence means that the shoes made by him were affordable so one never fell into debts with them. I am unsure of the second part of the paragraph.</p></li>

"What is the significance of the name ""Kopy-Keck"" in The Light Princess?","<p>In ""<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Light_Princess"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The Light Princess</a>"" by George MacDonald, the king consults ""two very wise Chinese philosophers"" about the princess's condition.<sup>1</sup> The philosophers are named ""Hum-Drum"" and ""Kopy-Keck."" The story is full of puns, and these faux-Chinese names would seem to be no exception.</p>

<p>Hum-Drum is described as ""a Materialist... slow and sententious""; his name is clearly a play on the word <a href=""https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/humdrum"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">humdrum</a>: ""lacking variety or excitement; dull; boring."" So far, so good.</p>

<p>However, I'm not coming up with a similar play on words for Kopy-Keck, who is ""a Spiritualist... quick and flighty."" Kopy sounds like ""copy,"" perhaps, but ""Keck"" has me stumped. (I don't think the sense of ""<a href=""https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/keck#Verb"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">to vomit</a>"" has any bearing!)</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.quora.com/What-does-the-name-Kopy-Keck-allude-to"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">This Quora post</a> suggests ""<a href=""https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/copycat"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">copycat</a>,"" but I am unconvinced:</p>

<ul>
<li>The post's author tries to explain the connection between ""copycat"" and ""quick and flighty"" by saying that cats are quick; but cats don't really have anything to do with the usual meaning of ""copycat.""</li>
<li><a href=""https://www.etymonline.com/word/copycat"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Etymonline</a> informs that ""copycat"" is first attested in American English in 1884, although the word is ""probably at least a generation older""; still, it seems unlikely that MacDonald, a Scottish writer, would be making a pun on the term in a story published in 1864, twenty years earlier.</li>
</ul>

<p>And in any case, it's unclear that Kopy-Keck has a tendency to ""copy"" anything. He propounds a theory that the princess has no gravity because her soul is from another planet and therefore is not attracted to the Earth, and he suggests that she can be cured by being taught extensively about the Earth so that she takes an interest in it. I can see the connection here to being a ""Spiritualist,"" but that's it.</p>

<p>So, the question: <strong>What is the significance of the name Kopy-Keck? Is it a pun or play on words? If so, on what?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>  Related to this is one final question: What is fiction <em>meant</em> to do? Why are you 
  reading a novel at all? Are you expecting to find out some truth about human nature? 
  Should a novel reveal some difficult, hard-to-face truth about ourselves? Do novels 
  show the inevitable end of certain paths? Or are they, instead, agents of moral 
  change? Do they show us models so that we can amend our ways? This idea—that 
  fiction provides us with a model—itself has a certain assumption behind it: There is 
  some standard of human behavior which applies to all of us, in all cultures, and our 
  quest in life is to uncover it.<br>
    The opposing idea was once expressed by Alexander Pope in the phrase, 
  <strong>""Whatever is, is right.""</strong> The novel doesn't set out an ideal, because to assume that 
  there is such a thing as an unchanging standard of behavior governing all people at all 
  times is narrow minded and myopic. The novel has no business in providing models. 
  It simply explores realities: It opens numerous doors for you to peer through, but 
  makes no suggestions as to which threshold you should cross. </p>

"Why was the ending of ""And Then There Were None"" changed for the stage version?","<p>Agatha Christie's famous crime story <em>And Then There Were None</em> was written both as a book and later as a play by Christie herself. However, when adapting her own story for the stage, she made a significant change to the ending, namely ...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Warning: major spoilers follow!</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>... in the book, every single one of the ten people on the island ends up being killed, even the true mastermind behind it all; while the play has a happier ending, in which Vera Claythorne and Philip Lombard are innocent and manage to escape the island together.</p>

<p>The <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/And_Then_There_Were_None_(play)"" rel=""noreferrer"">Wikipedia page for the play</a> (cited to Christie's autobiography, which I didn't find online) says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>She knew the ending would have to be changed as all of the characters die in the book and therefore ""I must make two of the characters innocent, to be reunited at the end and come safe out of the ordeal.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In contrast, other stage versions of the story (including one from 1944, only a year after Christie's own play) have preserved the book's dismal ending.</p>

<p><strong>Why did Christie change her play's ending from the novel's?</strong> Was she afraid that nobody would like a story in which all the main characters die - and if so, why did such qualms apply to the play more than to the original novel?</p>

"A story in which a young girl saves a poor boy from a factory owner and meets that boy decades later","<p>Yesterday, I was reading a 5th grader's comprehension book. It had multiple excerpts from good (if not well-known) novels.</p>

<p>One of them particularly stood out to me. It was about a woman who lived in the Victorian era. When she was a young girl, Victoria was crowned. On her coronation day, the protagonist and her sister couldn't handle the huge crowd and so started walking down a less busy road. There they see a sickly boy of their age lying on the ground. He tells them that he'd escaped from the factory he worked in. The master used to beat underage workers and kept them in alarmingly unsuitable conditions.</p>

<p>Her older sister is considerably disgusted by him and tells her to leave him as is. Not listening to her, she helps him stand up and is kind to him. He begs them to let him escape so that he can live a better life. And he implores her not to say which way he went if the master came searching for him.</p>

<p>Soon the dreaded master comes and gets hold of the boy. He is rough and tells the girls that this is the way of life for the poor — harsh. He himself worked in factories as a boy and believes the poor have no way but to work hard. In the meantime, the boy slips off his grip and manages to flee. The master gives up then and heads back to the factory.</p>

<p>Many years later, she reminisces about that day as she attends Queen Victoria's funeral. She has become old and can't push her way through the crowd. A gentleman helps her pass the crowd and when she turns to thank him, she smiles and sees that exact same scar the boy had on the man's face.</p>

"Did Conan Doyle's belief in the supernatural influence his fiction writings in any way?","<p>Arthur Conan Doyle was a believer in the supernatural. My source here is from the Muse magazine, published by Cricket Media, in the October 2011 issue, page 6, by Doug Stewart. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One of the English celebrities who came to see the mystifying American perform that year [1920] was Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the mystery writer. Conan Doyle was as famous around the world as Houdini was, thanks to his wildly popular detective stories starring crime solver Sherlock Holmes. Sir Arthur's admirers may have assumed that he, like the brainy sleuth he had created, was committed to keen observation, hard evidence, and logical reasoning.<br>
  If so, they were wrong. Conan Doyle believed in fairies, ghosts, haunted houses, and messages from beyond the grave. He rushed backstage after one of Houdini's performances, and the pair talked well into the night. Sir Arthur believed that certain people, called mediums, had supernatural abilities. He was convinced that Houdini was one of them.</p>

"What is the difference between a philosophical novel and a novel of ideas?","<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_fiction"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikipedia</a> calls the novel of ideas a subgenre of philosophical fiction, without defining the first term. The <em>Routledge Encyclopedia of Narrative Theory</em> (2010) uses the terms ""novel of ideas"" and ""philosophical novel"" interchangeably.  In <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/20/books/review/whatever-happened-to-the-novel-of-ideas.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">articles</a> published together in the <em>New York Times</em> in 2016 under the headline ""Whatever Happened to the Novel of Ideas?"", Benjamin Moser also uses the terms to mean the same thing, and Pankaj Mishra, while eschewing the word ""philosophy"", draws no distinction between them. Writing in the <em>Financial Times</em> in 2012, Jenny Erdal <a href=""https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:Qm3xMUk5gc0J:https://www.ft.com/content/1cc50e4c-7d81-11e1-81a5-00144feab49a%3Fmhq5j%3De2+&amp;cd=2&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=fr"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">describes</a> the two forms as ""close cousin(s)"", but she does not explain the difference.</p>

<p>There does, however, seem to be general agreement that the novel of ideas is quite rare nowadays.</p>

<p>Since not all ideas are philosophical, I do not favour a definition of the novel of ideas as a type of philosophical novel, it seeming that if one is a subtype of the other then the relationship should be the converse. But in that case, what definitions might we use? And if neither wholly includes the other, and therefore each has instances that are not instances of the other, how might we define the two genres as ""close cousins""?</p>

<p>Google's Ngram viewer returns the following for the use of the two terms over time:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/XzcNd.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/XzcNd.jpg"" alt=""philosophical novel and novel of ideas""></a></p>

<p>I have looked briefly at a number of other sources, including encyclopedias. While several define the two terms as equivalent, several others do not. But I have so far found only one source that offers clearly contrasting definitions, namely Leszek Kolek's <a href=""http://www.inibi.uph.edu.pl/images/inne/publikacje_ka/Kolek_PhD.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">1975 PhD thesis</a>. The author defines one of his aims as being to provide ""a definition and description of the genre called 'novel of ideas' on the basis of (Aldous) Huxley’s fiction"". Achieving his aim, he describes its distinctive features as being found in</p>

<ul>
<li>its “material”: that is, explicit ideas appearing in the fictional reality;</li>
<li>a reduced semantic significance of character and plot;</li>
<li>a semantic and structural balance between explicit and implicit modes of presentation,</li>
</ul>

<p>where an explicit idea is ""an abstract, syncretic and explicit statement analysed in essayistic utterances of the characters, the narrator’s comments, and in various forms of quotations"" (p.106).</p>

<p>He goes on to say that the novel of ideas differs from the philosophical novel ""owing to the syncretic character of explicit ideas"" and its ""lack of a 'thesis'"", the implication being that a philosophical novel shares the above three features except that its explicit ideas are non-syncretic and it contains a thesis. (It could also be that he means to suggest that the expression of ideas in a philosophical novel is achieved using means that have a greater proportion of the implicit rather than the explicit, but he does not say so explicitly.) Kolek qualifies the distinction, however, by acknowledging that ""we"" lack a precise definition of the philosophical novel (p.107). </p>

<p>How far this gets us, I am not sure.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Ah, and who were the women?” enviously my master asks. At first glance my master usually looks cold and hard; but, to tell the truth, he is by no means indifferent to women. <strong>He once read in a Western novel of a man who invariably fell partially in love with practically every woman that he met. Another character in the book somewhat sarcastically observed that, as a rough calculation, that fellow fell in love with just under seven-tenths of the women he passed in the street.</strong> On reading this, my master was struck by its essential truth and remained deeply impressed. Why should a man so impressionable lead such an oysterish existence? A mere cat such as I cannot possibly understand it. Some say it is the result of a love affair that went wrong; some say it is due to his weak stomach; while others simply state that it’s because he lacks both money and audacity. Whatever the truth, it doesn’t much matter since he’s a person of insufficient importance to affect the history of his period. What is certain is that he did enquire enviously about Coldmoon’s female fiddlers.</p>

<p>The lyrics are awfully specific about what happened to this ship, which is a common pattern I see when a song is referent to a real-life event.

<p>But, while Barrett's Privateers is fictional, it contains the details needed to tell a full story. Mabel Grey here seems to be a snapshot of some existing story - its descriptions are both cursory and rather specific, leaving a great number of holes for the listener to either fill in, or, alternately, understand within a pre-existing context.</p>

<p>The Harry Potter books are a ripping yarn, but the logical consistency of their setting tends to play second fiddle to the demands of character and story. It is hard to see how many aspects of Wizard society and economy might function and is the cause of many fan questions.</p>

<p>Of course, there are no rules to say fantasy worlds have to make logical sense. The fashion, since Tolkien, is that they should. But prior to him (and a few later examples), wild flights of fancy were the norm. Kazuro Ishiguro is on record has saying he's not interested in whether his fantasy worlds make any sense, merely in whether they work to help examine his chosen themes.</p>

<p>This makes me wonder whether these omissions may have been partially deliberate on the part of the author. What if Rowling intentionally made aspects of the wizarding world nonsensical in order to make points about modern society?</p>

<p>Take Quidditch. It leaves much to be desired as a sport, yet many Wizards seem oblivious and remain fanatically devoted to it. Could this not be read as a wry commentary on the fanatical devotion shown by many sports fans to what are, after all, relatively inconsequential pursuits? And the ""poor"" nature of some Wizarding families in spite of the magic available to them. Again, perhaps a comment on how a rich western society still relegates some people to live in poverty, in spite of the wealth of the nation?</p>

<p>Has Rowling ever intimated, or is there any additional evidence, that some or all of the logical inconsistency in her invented world should be read as allegory or metaphor?</p>

"What is the explanation for the two versions of Lucifer's fall from Heaven in ""The Sandman"" and ""Lucifer""?","<p>In <em>Season of Mists</em>, the fifth book of <em>The Sandman</em> series, in chapter 2, Lucifer explains that rebelled against god, and was cast out of Heaven to Hell, along with his lieutenants. </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/71a6d.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/71a6d.jpg"" alt=""Lucifer: &quot;I thought I was rebelling.

And I knew then that there was no way that I would ever return to paradise...&quot;""></a></p>

<p>This version of Lucifer and his fall <a href=""https://twitter.com/neilhimself/status/880069124440944640"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">was inspired</a> by John Milton's <em>Paradise Lost</em> (<a href=""https://literature.stackexchange.com/q/2552/11"">could use a comparison</a>, though).</p>

<p>In the last, 75th issue of <em>Lucifer</em>, a different story is told. Lucifer rebelled, yes, but the wasn't cast down - he was offered to rule the (then barely-existing) realm of Hell, as a compromise, by his Father. This would put Lucifer as far away from Heaven and God as possibly, which is all he wanted.</p>

<p>The pages from <em>Lucifer</em> are Lucifer's memories, meaning they can't be wrong. <em>The Sandman</em> pages, on the other hand, can - maybe Lucifer was lying to Morpheus, who knows?</p>

<p>When Lucifer fell, his wings (which used to be white and feathery) burned and became bat-like. However, we can see that in <em>Lucifer</em>, he didn't fall and his wings were left unscathed. And yet, in <em>Lucifer</em> #8 (""The House of Windowless Rooms pt. 4), Susano-o-no-Mikoto says that separated from Lucifer (as Morpheus cut them off), his wings ""healed"", meaning they returned from their bat-like shape to the normal angelic shape.</p>

<p>Therefore, in <em>The Sandman</em> Lucifer fell (literally), and his wings burned, as seen in <em>Season of Mists</em>. In <em>Lucifer</em>, it is implied that he fell, because his wings are burnt as well, but his own recollection is that he didn't fall, but simply left Heaven. </p>

<p>At first, I wanted to chalk this up to the simple reason - <em>The Sandman</em> was written by Neil Gaiman, while <em>Lucifer</em> was written by Mike Carey (albeit with help and advice from Neil Gaiman), so the latter could have simply retconned the former. But that doesn't explain why Lucifer's wings were burnt if he didn't fall in the first place.</p>

<p>How can those two stories, as told by Lucifer in <em>The Sandman</em> and his own series be made to work with each other?</p>

"Mathematics or gibberish? Understanding a description of an alien message in His Master's Voice","<p>I'm reading the 1983 Michael Kandel translation of Stanislaw Lem's <em>His Master's Voice</em>. The plot revolves around a secret military project to decode an alien message. The main character is a mathematician, and in one scene in the book he describes a mathematical proof of certain properties of the alien message. The scene takes place on page 86 of my copy of the book, and I have reproduced the scene below:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It was from this position that I proceeded to the translation of the problem into the language of mathematics. What I did I cannot present plainly, since our everyday language lacks the required concepts and words. I can only say, in general, that I studied the purely formal properties of the ""letter""--treating it as an object mathematically interpreted--for features that are of central interest in topological algebra and the algebra of groups. In doing this, I employed the transformation of transformational sets, which gives the so-called infragroups or Hogarth groups (named after me, since I was the one who discovered them). If I obtained, as a result, an ""open"" structure, that would still prove nothing, because it could be that I had simply introduced an error into my work, going on some false assumption (such an assumption might be, e.g. the assertion of the number of code signs in a sing e""unit"" of the message). But it happened otherwise. The ""letter"" closed beautifully for me, like an object separated from the rest of the world, or like a circular process (to be more precise, like the DESCRIPTION, the MODEL of such a thing).</p>
  
  <p>I spent three days setting up a program for the computer, and the computer carried out the task on the fourth. The result said that ""something, in some way, closes."" The ""something"" was the letter--in the totality of the interrelations of its signs; but as for the ""how"" of that closing, I could only make certain guesses, because my proof was indirect. The proof showed that the ""described object"" was NOT ""topologically open."" But to reveal the ""means of closure"" with the aid of current mathematical methods was impossible for me; such a task was several orders of difficulty greater than the one I had managed to surmount. The proof, then, was very general--one could even say vague. One the other hand, not every text would have displayed this property. The score of a symphony, for example, or a linear coding of a television image, or an ordinary linguistic text (a story, a philosophical treatise) does not close in that fashion. But the description of a geometric solid closes, as does that of something as complex as a genotype or a living organism. The genotype, true, closes differently from the solid. But by going into such distinctions and details I fear that I will be confusing the reader rather than explaining to him what I did with the ""letter.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have two related questions about this passage. First, I'm hoping that someone can break down the mathematics or lack thereof in this passage. Some of this is clearly made up; Hogarth is the fictional main character, so ""Hogarth groups"" probably aren't a real thing. But given Stanislaw Lem's reputation, I doubt that all of this is made up; I feel like some of this passage must have a relationship to real mathematics. It would be great if I could get an explanation of that.</p>

<p>Second, this passage is simplified, and the (fictional) narrator tells us that it's intentionally simplified. So my question is, what does this passage tell us about the message? What does the fact that the message is ""closed"", which makes it more like a ""geometric solid... [or] a genotype"" than a ""a story [or] a philosophical treatise"" convey to a lay reader? The narrator tells us that this is meant to be understood without a background in mathematics, but I feel like I'm missing something.</p>

"Identify mystery novel: Past crime uncovered in English village, gossip leading to death(s)","<p>I'm trying to remember a book I read sometime within the last ten years, but although I'm able to recall a fair bit of the story I have no idea of the title or author. I believe it's a ""modern"" mystery (rather than something by Agatha Christie or someone like that), but it's definitely set in England sometime between the late 19th and mid-20th century.</p>

<p>As I recall, some decades before the time of the story, there was a death where a woman was poisoned (or thought by people to have been poisoned) and a man was suspected. I think the suspect was the vicar (unpopular in town because of his ""modern"" ways), or perhaps a doctor, and the woman may have been his wife or fiancée. In any case, he was also suspected of having an affair with some girl, perhaps a maid, and this was supposed to have been his motive for murder.</p>

<p>A malicious gossip (I think some kind of religious fanatic) has kept the story alive all these years, and the vicar (?) was ostracized or driven from the town, perhaps to his grave. (I seem to remember a gravestone being vandalized or shunned. Perhaps the girl was also suspected of involvement in the murder and died somehow?)</p>

<p>All of this is only revealed gradually, because something in the present of the story brings it back up, but I don't remember what it is (are there more deaths? someone's will?). Anyway, it turns out the vicar was innocent, both of the affair and the murder. The girl was maybe infatuated with him and made up some story, or she was having an affair with someone else and the rumor was distorted. Did the victim actually commit suicide because she was in love with the man, over the gossip of his affair with the girl? Or was it assisted suicide because she was suffering from some malady? I don't recall precisely. At the bottom there was definitely a story of two lovers who were torn apart by malicious gossip, leading to the death of one or both, and still being maligned by the town decades later.</p>

<p>I also seem to remember that there's only one or two people in town who don't believe in the gossip, one of them a doctor or dentist (or lawyer?), and the other I think an old lady living in the house where it took place (the sister of one of the people involved?). I have a vague recollection that the doctor turns out to have been guilty of something (possibly of facilitating the woman's suicide, or keeping some dying admission secret).</p>

<p>I also seem to remember that the main character (a man, I'm pretty sure; he might be a journalist or attorney of some kind) travels back and forth to this town, presumably from London, several times, and that the whole business has more or less poisoned the atmosphere of the town with guilt/resentment, making it suspicious of outsiders digging into the past. The destructive consequences of village gossip is a major theme.</p>

<p>The main character first gets wind of the story in the inn/boardinghouse/B&amp;B where he's staying or a pub where he's having dinner. I also seem to recall that there's something in the story about music (was the vicar a music lover who introduced new tunes to the services?), but I can't swear to it.</p>

<p>It was much later that I read <em>Missee Lee</em>, which I assumed to be in the same metafictional category. Although not featuring the character of Peter Duck, it does seem to follow on from the novel <em>Peter Duck</em>, and it similarly stretches the reader's suspension of disbelief much more than most of the books in the series.</p>

<p>Other candidates for possibly being metafictional include <em>Great Northern</em> (which also features the boat <em>Wild Cat</em>) and <em>Pigeon Post</em> (wherein, if I recall correctly, the children successfully dowse and mine copper). But these I'm less sure of.</p>

<p><strong>Which of the books in the <em>Swallows and Amazons</em> series are considered to be metafictional?</strong></p>

<p>This question would probably be best answered using intertextual references (<em>Peter Duck</em>, for instance, is clearly metafictional because of the way it's described in <em>Swallowdale</em> - are there other inter-book references like this?), but I'm open to being convinced by other evidence too.</p>

"How much French does Madame Eglentyne know?","<p>In the General Prologue of <em>The Canterbury Tales</em>, we're introduced to Madame Eglentyne, a prioress (a nun). On lines 124-126, there's a confusing passage where we're told that she speaks elegant French, but that she doesn't know the French of Paris:</p>

"What exactly happened at the end of The Dumb Waiter?","<p>I've read a few critical explanations and exegeses on Harold Pinter's one-act play, <em>The Dumb Waiter</em>. I'm still confused by a few things that happen at the very end, before the curtain. I understand that Ben got the order to kill Gus, but what confuses me is how Gus went into the lavatory, through a door on the left, and then for some reason came back in through the other door, the one on the right. Did he loop around? Is that even possible in old hotels in England?</p>

<p>The other--and more confusing--element is this: Upon returning from the lavatory, why was Gus stripped of his jacket, waistcoat, holster and revolver?</p>

"Who or what is the narrator of “Our Talons Can Crush Galaxies”?","<p>I just read Brooke Bolander's short story ""Our Talons Can Crush Galaxies"", which has been nominated for both Hugo and Nebula Awards for Best Short Story after its publication less than a year ago (November 2016) in Uncanny Magazine.

<p>We can tell from the story that she's one of a group of sisters from a millennia-old civilisation, who speak an ancient language, possess great power, and can pass in and out of the ""mortal plane"". Does the text or subtext suggest a <em>particular</em> civilisation and language, a particular kind of mythical creature? Or is it meant to be vague about her exact nature and leave it to our imaginations?</p>

"Did Dirk Gently do anything to help Odin the end of Tea Time?","<p>At the end of <em>The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul</em>, the following things resolve Odin's troubles:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Thor changes an eagle back into a fighter plane, which (unintentionally?) kills the Draycotts, whom Odin entered a contract with.</p></li>
<li><p>Odin re-entered the hospital he wanted to stay in, on more favorable terms.</p></li>
<li><p>A new Guilt God emerged, apparently from Dirk's old fridge, and dealt with Toe Rag and the green-eyed giant, as they were escaping from Valhalla.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Apart from getting rid of his old fridge, and possibly giving an old god (who was perhaps a guilt god, as Dirk felt a ""nameless roaring guilt that came howling at him out of nowhere"" at their encounter) a coin, which apparently helped precipitate the 3rd item above, I don't see that Dirk did anything for the resolution of this story.  But as Toe Rag and the giant were escaping anyway, this doesn't seem crucial to the resolution.</p>

<p>Dirk made his way to Valhalla, and tried to help Odin against the Draycotts, but quickly gave up.  Kate apparently is responsible for 2, and Thor for 1.  As far as I can tell, it seems like he figured out, more or less, what was going on, and tried to help fix things, but without success in any major way.  Did Dirk actually do anything useful for the end of this story?  (Am I missing the significance of 3?)</p>

<p>It was in English and I can't say if it was translated. It was set in the UK or USA, but it might not be translated I suppose.</p>

<p>One of those girls tries to commit suicide, but fails. However, she does it again and dies. Thereafter, another one tries and succeeds. This thing goes on and on.</p>

<p><strong>What emotion is making her so speechless?</strong> Is she choked up at the thought of a gift from her father, angry at her mother for her presumption, or something else?

"Why does Ishtar insist on being called ""Ishtar""?","<p>There are many characters in Gaiman's Sandman stories that have multiple names; Morpheus is one of them. For the most part, they usually don't mind if someone calls them by one name or another. The first that I've seen this happen was with Ishtar.</p>

<p>After meeting Ishtar, Morpheus calls her by two other names for goddesses of love (Belili and Astarte). She corrects him both times, asking him to call her only ""Ishtar.""</p>

<blockquote>

  Ishtar: <strong><em>Ishtar.</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This exchange is interesting, and makes me wonder if there is a reason that Ishtar insists on that name, as opposed to the others? Perhaps there is a historical element of worship that Ishtar had that Belili and Astarte didn't, that allowed her to draw the power she needed to live from the nightclub where she danced?</p>

Or were Inner Party members not <em>actually</em> expected to conform to the party's beliefs to the same extent that Outer Party members were as long as everyone else was convinced that they did?

<ul>
<li><p><a href=""https://mainlynorfolk.info/louis.killen/songs/bonnyatmorn.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">""Bonny at Morn""</a>, an English folk song, which according to one account,</p>

<blockquote>

<li><p>A Belarusian folk carol ""Бегла старожа"" (""Running guard"", I think). Having no better source, I'm quoting its description from <a href=""https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-lyrics-of-the-Witcher-3-soundtrack-about"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Quora</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is a Belarusian folk carol called Бегла старожа. The phrase repeating after each line literally means Good evening, but rather than a normal greeting, it looks like a reference to Christmas. My interpretation is that on Christmas Eve Khazars (violent Medieval Turkic people who were enemies of Eastern Europeans) attacked some village/city and abducted Sergey’s daughter. The guard wakes everyone and wants to go to war and marry the girl when once he rescues her.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>""Fear a' Bhàta"" (""The Boatman""), a Scottish Gaelic song, which even has its own <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_a&#39;_Bh%C3%A0ta"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikipedia entry</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>""Naranča"" (""Orange"", the fruit), a Croatian folk song about the sea, the winter, and wine.</p></li>
<li><p>""Lazare"", a Bulgarian folk song, which is typically sung on Lazar's day, 8 days before Easter, to call for good harvest, prosperity, etc.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>. . . And probably some others. </p>

<p>The songs were no doubt used because they gave a sort of an ""authentic"" feel to the game by introducing some Slavic melodies and Slavic lyrics. <strong>However</strong>, it's the choice of those particular songs that draws my attention.</p>

<p>I'm fairly sure they weren't chosen for their melodies (i.e. the tunes were composed for the game), but I also can't see why they would be chosen based on their lyrics. Except for ""Fear a' Bhàta"", which is featured in locations associated with the sea in the game (the Skellige isles), the song lyrics do not match the situations the songs are featured in - most of the tracks inspired by songs I list here are played during fighting sequences, while their lyrics sing of peace, prosperity, harvest, and so forth.</p>

<p>How do those songs' lyrics fit in the context of the game? Was the choice of those lyrics intentional, or was it purely for ""the feel""?</p>

They suppose that opinions, being different from both ignorance and knowledge, must pertain to things neither existing nor nonexistent. The following excerpt from the conversation ensues:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Socrates: Then what remains to be discovered is the object which partakes
  equally of the nature of being and not-being, and cannot rightly be
  termed either, pure and simple; this unknown term, when discovered, we
  may truly call the subject of opinion, and assign each to their proper
  faculty,—the extremes to the faculties of the extremes and the mean to
  the faculty of the mean.</p>
  
  <p>Glaucon: True.</p>
  
  <p>This being premised, I would ask the gentleman who is of opinion that
  there is no absolute or unchangeable idea of beauty—in whose opinion
  the beautiful is the manifold—he, I say, your lover of beautiful
  sights, who cannot bear to be told that the beautiful is one, and the
  just is one, or that anything is one—to him I would appeal, saying,
  Will you be so very kind, sir, as to tell us whether, of all these
  beautiful things, there is one which will not be found ugly; or of the
  just, which will not be found unjust; or of the holy, which will not
  also be unholy?</p>
  
  <p>No, he replied; the beautiful will in some point of view be found
  ugly; and the same is true of the rest.</p>
  
  <p>And may not the many which are doubles be also halves?—doubles, that
  is, of one thing, and halves of another?</p>
  
  <p>Quite true.</p>
  
  <p>And things great and small, heavy and light, as they are termed, will
  not be denoted by these any more than by the opposite names?</p>
  
  <p>True; both these and the opposite names will always attach to all of
  them.</p>
  
  <p>And can any one of those many things which are called by particular
  names be said to be this rather than not to be this?</p>
  
  <p>He replied: They are like the punning riddles which are asked at
  feasts or the children's puzzle about the eunuch aiming at the bat,
  with what he hit him, as they say in the puzzle, and upon what the bat
  was sitting. The individual objects of which I am speaking are also a
  riddle, and have a double sense: nor can you fix them in your mind,
  either as being or not-being, or both, or neither.</p>

"Is it reasonable to use the movie version of a book to interpret the book when the same author wrote both?","<p>Related: <a href=""https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/2008/how-much-weight-should-we-give-authors-declarations-of-their-intent-after-the-f"">How much weight should we give authors&#39; declarations of their intent after the fact?</a></p>

<p>Just to give a concrete example of what I'm asking about, I'm thinking in particular about <em>The Hunger Games</em> books and movies. Since the book was written entirely from the perspective of Katniss, the movie has a significant amount of detail that the books didn't. For example, in the movies President Snowe explains why they have the Hunger Games in the first place instead of, for example, just rounding up kids at random and executing them on the spot.</p>

<p>Suzanne Collins is, at a minimum, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hunger_Games_(film)"" rel=""noreferrer"">listed as one of the first movie's screenwriters</a> (although she's not listed as a screenwriter for all of them, such as <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hunger_Games:_Mockingjay_%E2%80%93_Part_1"" rel=""noreferrer""><em>Mockingjay</em> part 1</a>). She was presumably still involved in the creation of all of the movies, though.</p>

<p>That being said, <em>assuming that authorial intent has some bearing on how we interpret the text</em>, is it ""valid"" for us to use the additional information introduced in the movies to interpret the books?</p>

"Is ""The Most Dangerous Game"" Literature?","<p>Way back in high school, many many years ago, our teacher described to us what made something literature or not.  This lesson always stuck with me for two reasons: 1) I didn't really think it was right; 2) I really enjoyed the short story associated with it.  We read some story that was considered literature, I don't remember what it was anymore.  Then we read <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Most_Dangerous_Game"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">""The Most Dangerous Game""</a>.  This apparently, according to her, was not literature because of the ""too"" coincidental incident of how the MC fell overboard.  If I recall correctly, his cigar was knocked out of his hand by the sail when it was blown in the wind and then he was knocked overboard.</p>

"What was the purpose of Sam Black Crow in American Gods?","<p>In Neil Gaiman's novel <em>American Gods</em>, many of the characters Shadow encounters turn out to be somehow part of the world of the gods, even those like Low-Key Lyesmith who'd seemed innocuous. Most of those who don't had either been part of his life before prison, such as Audrey, or were people he met in Lakeside, like Chad Mulligan. All of these characters, at some point in the story, help move the plot along; they have some connection with other characters, integrating them into the world.</p>

<p>An exception, as far as I can tell, is <strong>Sam Black Crow</strong>. She turns up several times through the book, but each appearance feels like a one-off and not really connected to anything else in the story. She could be removed altogether and nothing important would change.</p>

Her voice was so harsh, as harsh as that of a roving crow, that her otherwise fine appearance diminished in enchantment. So much so that I didn’t even bother to turn around to see what sort of person this Gen-chan was, but sauntered on toward Onarimachi with my hands tucked inside the breast-fold of my kimono.

<blockquote>
  <p>&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;I like Faulkner as well as I like Hemingway, and I’d like to believe that even William Strunk and certainly E. B. White would not have tried to edit Faulkner out of existence. When Hemingway writes “He disliked bars and bodegas,” speaking of an old waiter in “A Clean, Well-Lighted Place,” few of us would argue that his sentence is not simple and direct or that it is cluttered with needless words. But when Faulkner writes about the boy who’s the protagonist in “Barn Burning” it’s hard to see how Strunk and White’s admonition might apply:</p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>The boy, crouched on his nail keg at the back of the crowded room, knew he smelled cheese, and more:<strong>[.]</strong> from <strong>[From]</strong> where he sat he could see the ranked shelves close-packed with the solid, squat, dynamic shapes of tin cans whose labels his stomach read, not from the lettering which meant nothing to his mind but from the scarlet devils and the silver curve of fish— <strong>[.]</strong> this <strong>[This]</strong>, the cheese which he knew he smelled and the hermetic meat which his intestines believed he smelled coming in intermittent gusts momentary and brief between the other constant one, the smell and sense just a little of fear because mostly of despair and grief, the old fierce pull of the blood.</p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Simple and direct it most certainly is not. Both writers, Faulkner and Hemingway, introduce us to the thinking of their characters, but just as the thinking of Hemingway’s old waiter is infinitely more tired and less active than the thinking of Faulkner’s boy, the sentence each writer constructs is intended to hit us in very different ways for very different reasons. Start cutting out words and simplifying the syntax in Faulkner’s sentence and we’ll miss the complex thinking that haunts the boy throughout the story.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why didn’t Faulkner split the sentence overhead into three, by substituting a period for the:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>colon (in the second line)?</p></li>
<li><p>dash (in the fifth last line)?</p></li>

"How can some similes 'make comparisons' without thinking 'of one situation or thing as being something else'?","<p>Prof. Brooks Landon, U.

<blockquote>
  <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  First, prompts of comparison—figurative language. Remember the basic distinction between a simile and a metaphor is that a simile explicitly compares two things of different kinds or quality, usually introducing the comparison with <em>like</em> or <em>as</em>, while a metaphor offers a comparison of two things of different kinds or quality, but does not introduce it explicitly with words such as <em>like</em> or <em>as</em>. Thus, “She ran like a gazelle” is a simile, comparing a girl to a famously fast and graceful animal, and introducing the comparison with <em>like</em>. But “She gazelled her way across the field” would be a metaphor, the comparison implicit in a verb that suggests her movement had qualities that might be associated with a gazelle.<br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  Not every simile is a metaphor, since <strong>some similes simply make comparisons and do not ask us to think of one situation or thing as being something else</strong>, but every metaphor inherently implies the comparison we find in a simile. Both similes and metaphors make our writing more interesting and more effective. Both quickly and powerfully suggest comparisons that might be impossible to explain in any literal way. Years ago, S. I. Hayakawa noted in his classic textbook <em>Language in Thought and Action</em> that similes don’t actually compare two apparently dissimilar things or situations as much as they compare our feelings toward those two things or situations, thus offering a window into the way we feel, as well as the way we think.<br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; As Hayakawa puts it: “The simile . . . is something of a compromise stage between the direct, unreflective expression of feeling and the report, but of course closer to the former than the latter.” He goes on to suggest that “[t]he imaginative process by which phrases such as these [similes] are coined is the same as that by which poets arrive at poetry. In poetry, there is the same love of seeing things in scientifically outrageous but emotionally expressive language.”</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>On my right hand there were lines of fishing stakes[,] resembling a mysterious system of half-submerged bamboo fences, incomprehensible in its division of the domain of tropical fishes, and crazy of aspect[,] as if abandoned forever by some nomad tribe of fishermen[,] now gone to the other end of the ocean; for there was no sign of human habitation as far as the eye could reach.</p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p><strong>I’ve slightly repunctuated this sentence to emphasize its cumulative rhythms [I emboldened]</strong>, but I cite it here to note how it is only when we get to the simile “as if abandoned forever by some nomad tribe of fishermen” that we fully understand the extent to which Conrad’s narrator has a very active imagination and loves to use it to make stories out of what he sees. In other words, while mastery of coordinate, subordinate, and mixed cumulative forms is an important goal and may tell us a lot about a writer’s syntactic skill and versatility, it doesn’t do much to distinguish the skill and versatility of one writer who writes great cumulative sentences from the skill and versatility of another writer who also can write great cumulative sentences. However, the similes these two writers will think of, the comparisons they will make, will almost certainly be different, each writer drawing from different knowledge, different experiences, and revealing different interests.</p>

  <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  And here are two very different-sounding sentences from two of Thomas Berger’s novels. The first is from his classic <em>Little Big Man</em> and is in the inimitable voice of Jack Crabb:</p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>As I say, none of us understood the situation, but me and Caroline was considerably better off than the chief, because we only looked to him for our upkeep in the foreseeable future, whereas he at last decided we was demons and only waiting for dark to steal the wits from his head; and while riding along he muttered prayers and incantations to bring us bad medicine, but so ran his luck that he never saw any of the animal brothers that assisted his magic—such as Rattlesnake or Prairie Dog—but rather only Jackrabbit, who had a grudge against him of long standing because he once had kept a prairie fire off his camp by exhorting it to burn the hares’ home instead.</p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  The second example is from Berger’s retelling of the “matter of Britain” in his <em>Arthur Rex</em> and sounds more than a bit like Sir Thomas Malory—but like a Malory who has just mastered the cumulative sentence:</p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>Now the abominable Sir Meliagrant took Guinevere to a kingdom that was not very distant from Britain but was cunningly concealed, tucked into a valley amongst mountains, entrance to which could be gained only by one pass not easily found, and before this pass was a rushing river over which was but one</p>

  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  I’ve chosen these particular passages to share with you to suggest the range of prose rhythms we can hear in Woolf’s finely architected prose, Berger’s mastery of American vernacular prose rhythms, and Berger’s ability to invoke the sound of Sir Thomas Malory’s prose, but in a book whose prose is also thoroughgoingly modern. <strong>Notice that these passages are rhythmical, but not musical or even metrical</strong>—the result of the way each proceeds forward in steps rather than the result of syllable count or meter. As Ursula K. Le Guin reminds us in her delightful writing text, Steering the Craft, “The sound of language is where it all begins and what it all comes back to. The basic elements of language are physical; the noise words make and the rhythm of their relationships. This is just as true of written prose as it is of poetry.”</p>

"What's Samuel Johnson truly saying about Dryden and Pope?","<p>Samuel Johnson wrote the following comparison between Dryden and Pope:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Pope had perhaps the judgment of Dryden; but Dryden certainly wanted the diligence of Pope. In acquired knowledge the superiority must be allowed to Dryden, whose education was more scholastick, and who before he became an author had been allowed more time for study, with better means of information. His mind has a larger range, and he collects his images and illustrations from a more extensive circumference of science. Dryden knew more of man in his general nature, and Pope in his local manners. . . . There is more dignity in the knowledge of Dryden, and more certainty in that of Pope.<br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The style of Dryden is capricious and varied, that of Pope is cautious and uniform; Dryden obeys the motions of his own mind; Pope constrains his mind to his own rules of composition. Dryden is sometimes vehement and rapid; Pope is always smooth, uniform, and gentle. Dryden’s page is a natural field, rising into inequalities, and diversified by the varied exuberance of abundant vegetation; Pope’s is a velvet lawn, shaven by the scythe, and levelled by the roller.<br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of genius, that power which constitutes a poet; that quality without which judgement is cold and knowledge is inert; that energy which collects, combines, amplifies, and animates—the superiority must, with some hesitation, be allowed to Dryden. . . . Dryden’s performances were always hasty, either excited by some external occasion, or extorted by domestick necessity; he composed without consideration, and published without correction. What his mind could supply at call, or gather in one excursion, was all that he sought, and all that he gave. The dilatory caution of Pope enabled him to condense his sentiments, to multiply his images, and to accumulate all that study might produce, or chance might supply. If the flights of Dryden therefore are higher, Pope continues longer on the wing. If of Dryden’s fire the blaze is brighter, of Pope’s the heat is more regular and constant. Dryden often surpasses expectation, and Pope never falls below it. Dryden is read with frequent astonishment, and Pope with perpetual delight.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And what Connors reports has a bit of the feel of a good news/bad news joke. The good news is that he cites a number of empirical studies that seem to validate the assumption that sentence-based writing pedagogies do indeed improve writing—and do so rather dramatically. The bad news is that they have fallen out of fashion, precisely in part because of a larger suspicion in English studies of empirical studies as <strong>antihumanist</strong> and a suspicion that these teaching techniques stifle creativity, are not themselves located in larger theories of discourse, and might actually be demeaning to students, with exercises, far removed from actual writing situations, that boil down to “mere servile copying.” More bad news is that by the mid-1980s “[t]he result of all these lines of criticism of syntactic methods was that they were stopped almost dead in their tracks as a research program and ceased being a popular teaching project just a little later.” The good news, however, is that Connors concludes, “It really does seem that the current perception that somehow sentence rhetorics ‘don’t work’ exists as a massive piece of wish fulfillment.” As Connors explains (more good news!) in a sentence that is as carefully suspensive as his earlier sentence was balanced: “In other words, if people believe that research has shown that sentence rhetorics don’t work, their belief exists not because the record bears it out but because it is what people want to believe.”</p>

At least, as much sense as Mieville allows. I'm sure the answer to ""what happened"" is fundamentally uncertain, but I'm not sure that I even know what exactly to be uncertain about.</p>

<p>Thanks, and I'm happy to clarify if needed.</p>

"Complicated name features in Wuthering Heights","<p>In <em>Wuthering Heights</em>, Catherine Earnshaw and her daughter Catherine Linton constantly change their names and created confusion as to who is who. And you would all have read the part where Lockwood discovers carved variation of their names (Catherine). And the Catherines of this book change their names, such as 'Catherine Earnshaw' to 'Catherine Linton', and 'Catherine Linton' to 'Catherine Heathcliff' - soon-to-be Catherine Earnshaw.</p>

<p>By changing the female protagonists' names, what can be expected of its effect to our readers or the character's status in the story? Isn't this quite an uncanny aspect of the book?</p>

"Shakespeare and Iambic pentameter","<p>My question is, 'Is Iambic pentameter just an illusion?'</p>

<p>When I learned Shakespeare in school, my teacher emphasized on the thing called 'iambic pentameter'. That goes like 'du Dum du Dum......' But when I looked up at the famous 'tomorrow speech' from Macbeth, I really didn't think this isn't on Iambic pentameter. Only Iambic pentameter I can name was the line 'That strets and frets his hour upon the stage.'</p>

<p>So I posted a question in the other site and the answer I was given was that there is no strict iambic pentameter. No-one writes poems in strict iambic pentameter and that shakespeare isn't much of it. They said it is even debatable whether Shakespeare 'knew' what is iambic pentameter or he just followed what other people in his period wrote. I was... deeply confused?</p>

<p>And they say the poem I gave as an example of Iambic trimeter isn't much of Iambic either. It goes like this.</p>

<p>'Although the sun and moon were gone
And the universe ceased to be
And thou art left alone
Every existence would exist in thee.'</p>

<p>Is my perception of Iambic completely wrong? I've  always thought that poems are to be written in iambic. I don't know why my teacher so much gave an emphasis on it.</p>

"Why is it important that 'Nowadays it's the girl who takes the initiative'?","<p>In <em>Sophie's World</em>, we have one scene that can be described as a sex scene. It's in the chapter 'The Garden Party'; page 478 in my edition. Here's the relevant part:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The guests applauded, and one of the boys threw a firecracker up in the pear tree. Joanna left the table and pulled Jeremy up off his chair. They lay down on the grass and started kissing each other again. After a while they rolled in under the red-currant bushes.<br>
  ""Nowadays it's the girl who takes the initiative,"" said Mr. Ingebrigsten.<br>
  Having said that, he got up and went over to the red-currant bushes where he stood observing the phenomenon at close quarters. The rest of the guests followed suit. Only Sophie and Alberto remained sitting at the table. The other guests now stood in a semicircle around Joanna and Jeremy.<br>
  [...]<br>
  ...fumbling with his belt.<br>
  ""Don't catch cold!"" said Mrs. Ingebrigsten.<br>
  Sophie looked despairingly at Alberto.<br>
  ""It's happening more quickly than I thought,"" he said.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What is going on in this scene? Why is it important that the girl is taking the initiative? Why does everyone go watch? What is Alberto talking about - what's happening here?</p>

"Terms for structural analysis of a non-linear narrative","<p>I'm struggling to identify established terms for analyzing non-linear narratives.</p>

<p>If the narrative chronology is the order in which events are narrated, what is the standard term for the ""internal"" chronology of the fiction itself?</p>

<p>And to which of the two ""chronologies"" should we seek to apply the standard structural patterns like e.g. Freytag's pyramid?</p>

<p>For example, in <em>Hamlet</em>, the event that arguably kicks off the whole sordid tale is when Claudius murders the king, but the actual narrative starts <em>in media res</em> with the appearance of the king's ghost. Sources disagree on which of the two events is the ""inciting incident"".</p>

<p>Non-linear narratives date back millennia, can it really be true that we're still struggling with the terminology?</p>

"Analysing a quote from Much Ado About Nothing","<p>I have analyzed a quote from the play <em>Much Ado About Nothing</em> with the question, ""How is reputation shown in the play?""</p>

<p>Leonato is a king and does not want his reputation to be ruined due to the awful acts of Hero. This is shown through the quote, ""here point a dagger into me"". Shakespeare uses ""dagger"" to show how he wanted to kill himself when his reputation was ruined. This is because if a king had a bad reputation people would hate him and no one would follow him. The audience understands how reputation was important to Leonato as a king.</p>

<p>Can someone please give me feedback on this analysis? Thank you.</p>

"In what sense will ""nothing come of"" Geralt and Yennefer's relationship?","<p>At the end of ""The Bounds of Reason"", the first story in the collection <em>Sword of Destiny</em>, the second of the first two Witcher short story collections, we see the following exchange between Yennefer and the dragon Villentretenmerth:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Forgive me my frankness and forthrightness, Yennefer. It is written all over your faces, I don't even have to try to read your thoughts. You were made for each other, you and the Witcher. But nothing will come of it. Nothing. I'm sorry.""</p>
  
  <p>""I know,"" Yennefer blanched slightly. ""I know, Villentretenmerth. But I would also like to believe there are not limits of possibility. Or at least I would like to believe that they are still very far away.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What exactly does he mean by ""nothing will come of it""? Does it just mean that they will have no children together (due to Yennefer's barrenness), or that their relationship will not last (as it didn't last last time - indeed, they've only just got back together again)?</p>

<p>Is the meaning of this phrase more clear in the original Polish text?</p>

<p>Do they deserve this evaluation, though? For one thing, the <em>were</em> able to capture Morpheus. Granted, he was <em>very</em> weak, but then it did require some preparation on their part to do so.</p>

<p>Roderick Burgess was also called the Daemon King; Alex Burgess states that he had seen things that were supposedly real magic; it's mentioned once (in <em>Kindly Ones</em>, if memory serves) that Aleister Crowley had admitted Roderick Burgess was the best of them. It's also postulated that he was able to summon the four winds to do his bidding (and that Alex was nothing like his father in that regard). Not to mention, of course, that Roderick was able to kill Sykes once he'd lost his protection amulet.</p>

<p>My point is, although we don't know any of their achievements, evidence points that they <em>were</em> real, qualified magicians, not to the opposite. What makes Neil Gaiman say so?</p>

"Where did the Fables get all those weapons in the first place?","<p>In the second volume of <em>Fables</em>, <em>Animal Farm</em>, we see that the Fables possess an enormous amount of various firearms:</p>

"How much of the original verse is lost in Fitzgerald's translation of The Aeneid?","<p>I checked out <em>The Aeneid</em> from the library and read it today. I found it a bit easier to read than I'd expected (I guess I expected worse-than-Shakespearean language/turns of phrase) and then I realized that of course, it had been translated from Latin.</p>

<p>As I read through, I found kind of odd phrasing here and there, that made me wonder how different it was from the original text. I also found it really hard to discern the meter (apparently, it's written in dactylic hexameter) but would it have been easier to hear in the original language, and perhaps there was also more rhyme in the original? </p>

<p>Could there also have been ""clever"" pieces of writing, like puns and such, that you can't pick up in the language?</p>

<p>In short: how much was lost in translation? (My copy was the translation by Robert Fitzgerald.)</p>

"Why does only one of R. S. Thomas' poems conform to traditional poetic devices?","<p>R.S. Thomas was a Welsh poet who worked between 1942 until his death in 2000. His poems are almost exclusively modern in structure, in the sense that they eschew meter and rhyme in favour of a more prose-like structure. Here's a short example:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Looking upon this tree with its quaint pretension<br>
  Of holding the earth, a leveret, in its claws,<br>
  Or marking the texture of its living bark,<br>
  A grey sea wrinkled by the winds of years,<br>
  I understand whence this man's body comes,<br>
  In veins and fibres, the bare boughs of bone,<br>
  The trellised thicket, where the heart, that robin,<br>
  Greets with a song the seasons of the blood.    </p>
  
  <p>But where in meadow or mountain shall I match<br>
  The individual accent of the speech<br>
  That is the ear's familiar? To what sun attribute<br>
  The honeyed warmness of his smile?<br>
  To which of the deciduous brood is germane<br>
  The angel peeping from the latticed eye?    </p>
</blockquote>

<p>One of his poems, however, is quite different in structure:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One night of tempest I arose and went<br>
  Along the Menai shore on dreaming bent;<br>
  The wind was strong, and savage swung the tide,<br>
  And the waves blustered on Caernarvon side.  </p>
  
  <p>But in the morrow, when I passed that way,<br>
  On Menai’s shore the hush of heaven lay;<br>
  The wind was gentle and the sea a flower,<br>
  And the sun slumbered on Caernavon tower.  </p>

<p>Why does this - and, as far as I can tell only this - poem, entitled <em>Night and Morning</em>, among his work conform to traditional poetic structures?</p>

"Benvolio and Mercutio in Romeo and Juliet","<p>What do the characters of Benvolio and Mercutio in <em>Romeo and Juliet</em> symbolize, if anything? Mercutio's character mainly provides jokes, and then, in his hot-headedness, is slain by Tybalt. </p>

<p>Benvolio at first tries to take Romeo's mind of Rosaline, and then tries to stop the violence between first Tybalt and Mercutio with Romeo, and then between Romeo and Tybalt. He then, after Romeo kills Tybalt, reports to the Prince of Venice what happened.</p>

I have heard that the former is the first book by Sir Arthur Connal Doyle. And it gives initial insights into the character of the protagonists. However, I found the prose of 'A Scandal in Bohemia' more appealing as per my tastes after flipping through the first few pages of a reading app. Hence, I want to pick up this book first.

"Why is 'Hamlet' considered one of the very best plays ever?","<p>When an intellectual work (philosophy book, literary book, painting etc) is studied there are (at least) two principal questions to be addressed:</p>

<ul>
<li>What is this work about?</li>
<li>Why is this work important?</li>
</ul>

<p>These questions are very intimately interrelated.</p>

<p>For example, if you know more precisely what is this work about then you can answer more convincingly why this may be important.</p>

<p>Also, if you know why this work is important then this may shed light on some cardinal aspects of the work and it may make you understand it better.</p>

<p>But these two questions are (probably) not identical because to start with the latter question needs significantly more the historical context of the intellectual work to be addressed and also perhaps some comparative analysis in general so that the question is more precisely answered.</p>

<p>In a quite interesting way, although many people can answer the former question about an intellectual work they usually are not so confident or convincing when answering the latter question.
(See also <a href=""https://philosophy.stackexchange.com/questions/55227/why-the-tractatus-logico-philosophicus-was-is-so-groundbreaking"">here</a> when I asked the same question about the Tractatus Logico Philosophicus - nobody really gave an inclusive answer)</p>

<p><strong>In any case, I want to ask the latter question about 'Hamlet': Why is 'Hamlet' considered one of the very best plays ever?</strong></p>

<p>It may be that the existential monologue of Hamlet is a quite strong advocate of why this play should be considered so important as it addresses the topic about what is the meaning of life and when life loses to such extent its meaning that death is almost mandatory.</p>

<p>But still, in my opinion, this is only a part of the play and it is not exactly its overarching theme and in this regard the play should not be evaluated only on this.</p>

<p>Another factor which may make the play (considered as) great is the unique alternation of extreme emotions and behaviors which certainly makes the play rich as a kaleidoscope of human psychology. </p>

<p><em>Just to make clear that I am not saying that Hamlet is not or should not be considered as a great theatrical play but I just want to see some compelling arguments/evidence from people who has seriously read it.</em></p>

<p>I would strongly prefer a comprehensive answer and not a too brief one.</p>

  <p>Elizabeth’s last letter had communicated a piece of news of some

  called a second time, a third; had been pointedly attentive: if
  Elizabeth and her father did not deceive themselves, had been taking
  as much pains to seek the acquaintance, and proclaim the value of the
  connexion, as he had formerly taken pains to shew neglect. This was
  very wonderful if it were true; and Lady Russell was in a state of
  very agreeable curiosity and perplexity about Mr Elliot, already
  recanting the sentiment she had so lately expressed to Mary, of his
  being ‘a man whom she had no wish to see.’ She had a great wish to see
  him. If he really sought to reconcile himself like a dutiful branch,
  he must be forgiven for having dismembered himself from the paternal
  tree. Anne was not animated to an equal pitch by the circumstance; but
  she felt that she would rather see Mr Elliot again than not, which was
  more than she could say for many other persons in Bath. She was put
  down in Camden Place; and Lady Russell then drove to her own lodgings,
