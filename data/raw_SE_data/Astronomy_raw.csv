"How do I calculate the inclination of an object with an amateur telescope?","<p>Suppose I would like to calculate the inclination of a satellite from the <strong>ecliptic</strong>. Would it be possible to do this with an amateur telescope? How would I go about doing so?</p>

<hr>

"How do star densities work?","<p>If we take a look at stars more massive than the Sun, their densities vary a lot.

Neither of them are main-sequence. </p>

<p>The Sun has a lower mass than both of them, yet it's also smaller than both of them.</p>

<p>It doesn't seem like mass makes a big difference. Both reach hydrostatic equilibrium at completely different sizes. r136a1 has a much stronger gravitational pull than UY Scuti, but it should also have much more radiation pressure, right?</p>

"Precise declination of Moon","<p>The moon follows 5.14 deg inclined path. the ecliptic and the Moon's path coincide are called 'nodes', and they travel around the ecliptic in a period of 18.66 years.</p>

<p>Once every 18.66 years, the ascending node coincides with the vernal equinox, and the Moon will reach declinations of about +28° and -28° (much more than the Sun, which reaches ±23°); this is called a 'major lunar standstill'. 9.33 years later, the opposite is true, and the Moon will only reach ±18° during a 'minor lunar standstill'.</p>

"Can an astronaut ever reach a Black Hole theoretically?","<p>Ok, bear with me, while I try to explain the question I have.</p>

<p>I read that time slows as we approach a black hole.</p>

<p>So, suppose,theoretically, as astronaut is approaching a Black Hole. And he gets near enough now that time starts slowing down.</p>

<p>If you remember this equation: v=d/t  So, at the moment, t is going infinity, so it means 
V is going zero.
So the astronaut can never the reach the Black Hole because time is slowing down and its taking longer and longer for him to approach the Black Hole.</p>

<p>But then again, we know, a Black Hole sucks everything and that light cannot even escape it.</p>

<p>So, what's happening to the equation above then? [ this time it means v is going infinity and so, t is almost zero], so the astronaut will be sucked almost immediately.</p>

"A question about using both the Simbad and the Gaia archive","<p>It seems a bunch of people, including myself, have got it into our heads to create a 3D visualisation of the stars around us - one where you get to fly around them rather than view them from the viewpoint of Earth.</p>

<p>This means, obviously, that I'm limited to stars that have parallax values, which in the case of the <a href=""https://gea.esac.esa.int/archive/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Gaia archive</a> is about 2 million whereas in <a href=""http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Simbad</a> 100 000. The reason why I'd like to use both is that Simbad appears to have more useful information, including names and types of star. Also, amazingly, the highest parallax (in milliarcseconds) in gaia is in the 200s, which suggests that alpha centauri is not in the archive! My hunch is that Simbad is the place to go for nearby and named stars, whereas Gaia has higher numbers.</p>

<p>I imagine (perhaps incorrectly) that there is a way to identify a Simbad star on the Gaia database and vice versa. Gaia has a bunch of id values (solution_id, source_id, random_index) whereas on Simbad there's just the one (Identifier). I have the suspicion that Simbad may have more columns I'm not aware of.</p>

<p>In any case, my plan would be to query both archives, and weed out multiples based on an identifier of some sort. Maybe there's a third database that links the two? Maybe I'm missing something obvious? Perhaps there's the perfect page out there that tells me precisely how to do this which has eluded my googling.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Scientists base this scenario of how our solar system came to be on observations of protoplanetary disks around other stars that are young enough to currently be in the process of birthing planets. Using the Atacama Large Millimeter Array, or ALMA, comprising 45 radio antennas in Chile's Atacama Desert, the team performed a survey of young stars in the Taurus star-forming region, a vast cloud of gas and dust located a modest 450 light-years from Earth. When the researchers imaged 32 stars surrounded by protoplanetary disks, they found that 12 of them—40 percent—have rings and gaps, structures that according to the team's measurements and calculations can be best explained by the presence of nascent planets.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The article ends by saying:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Going forward, <strong>the research group plans to move ALMA's antennas farther apart</strong>, which should increase the array's resolution to around five astronomical units (one AU equals the average distance between the Earth and the sun), and to make the antennas sensitive to other frequencies that are sensitive to other types of dust.</p>
  
  <p>""Our results are an exciting step in understanding this key phase of planet formation,"" Long said, ""and by making these adjustments, we are hoping to better understand the origins of the rings and gaps.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Changing from 15AU to 5 AU suggests a roughly factor of 3 increase in the overall scale of the pattern of antennas. The <a href=""http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/aae8e1/meta"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">linked paper in ApJ</a> Feng Long et al. has a preprint in <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.06044"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ArXiv</a> as well, which says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>All observations were obtained from late August to early September 2017 <strong>using 45-47 12-m antennas on baselines of 21∼3697 m (15∼2780 kλ)</strong>, with slight differences in each group (see Table 1).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Several years ago I remember reading about the design of ALMA and there are a lot more <em>places to put dishes</em> than there are dishes. I think there were five optimized configurations that all looked to have a similar spiral shape, but each one was maybe a factor of 2 or 3 larger than the previous. </p>

<p>Since the dishes take time to move and setup and calibrate, this probably doesn't happen that often.</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> How often does it happen? How often do they move most of ALMA's dishes to change resolution?</p>

<p>I got into orbit of moon and then I was able to get back to orbit of ""Kerbal"" (the home planet in this game, similar to Earth) and land succesfully.</p>

<p>I did not have much fuel left, therefore I wanted to save as much as possible for anything that can happen during landing. When I was at my Apoapsis (which was as far away as moon) from Kerbal I used fuel to get my periapsis to only 50km, while Apoapsis remained the same. The trajectory was very ""ellipse-like"".</p>

<p>What happend? When I was aerobraking at 50km with more than 3000m/s speed, the apoapsis decreasing, while periapses remains almost the same. Then I was catapulted ""back to the space"", but with shorter trajectory around kerbin.</p>

<p>I did this multiple times and after some time, my speed at periapsis decreased to 2400m/s and after that, the apoapsis got as low that I stayed in atmosphere and landed.</p>

<p>The point is - I did not have to use as much fuel to get low orbit, I slow down a lot with repeating ""slow a little with aerobreaking and then go again to space"".</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Let $n$, $T$, and $x_i$ be the number density of hydrogen, the temperature of the gas, and $n_i/n$, where $n_i$ is the number density of the $i$th component of the interstellar medium. We can then write the criteria for thermal equilibrium as
  $$n^2\Lambda(n,T,x_i)-n\Gamma(n,T,x_i)\equiv n^2\mathcal{L}=0$$
  where $\Lambda$ and $\Gamma$ and the heating and cooling functions, respectively, and $\mathcal{L}$ is defined through those functions and $n$. If the equilibrium is unstable,
  $$\left(\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial S}\right)&lt;0$$
  for entropy $S$.  </p>
  
  <p>This leads to different instability conditions, termed the <em>isochoric</em> and <em>isobaric</em> instabilities (<a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/bib_query?1965ApJ...142..531F"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Field (1965)</a>, $\text{Eq } 4a,4b$). These can be determined from the temperature, pressure, and density of the gas (also assuming that the gas can be approximated as an ideal gas).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>which is not helping me <em>understand why there aren't any</em> beyond saying simply ""because they are unstable.""</p>

<p>900 GHz (0.9 THz) is quite a high frequency for a radio receiver! Each ALMA dish down-converts received frequency to a baseband of a few GHz before they get digitized and sent to the correlator for digital interferometry, but you still need an ultra-stable local oscillator (LO) for downconversion, and all of the LO's of all of the dishes need to be mutually coherent. That's quite a feat considering they can be tens of kilometers apart!</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> How does ALMA produce stable, mutually coherent ~THz local oscillators for all of their dishes?</p>

<hr>

<p>As suggested in this <a href=""https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/a/20086/7982"">partial answer</a> to the question <em>How does the Event Horizon Telescope implement the interferometry?</em> hard drives collect digital data down-converted by local atomic clocks, probably using GPS as a secondary reference, then brought to a central location for post analysis.</p>

<p>I am guessing that they spend a significant amount of time trying to reconstruct coherence at the millimetre (picosecond) level, but that option is not available for ALMA as data is continuously recorded at some large fraction of 24/7, and the huge volume of data at a location where magnetic hard drives don't work is overwhelming. So they need to get it right the first time.</p>

"What astronomical observations would give conclusive proof of alien life?","<p>There are several ways we are coming closer to answering the question ""is there life elsewhere in the universe?"".

Another is to try to search for habitable exoplanets, and eventually examine the habitable ones in detail via direct imaging. Another is too look for evidence of life or life that existed in the past right in our own solar system (for exmaple on Mars, Titan, Europa, etc). </p>

<p>1) Have I missed any other astronomy-related approaches to answering this question?</p>

<p>2) Short of radio contact from an ET civilization, or a visit by aliens, or the discovery of life/past-life in our solar system, what would give conclusive evidence of alien life in the galaxy? </p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>In 20 or so years when we develop the technology to directly image exoplanets, we will be able to determine their chemical composition and characterize their structure. If astronmers who study exoplanets found what they are looking for -evidence of oxygen and other biomarker gases - this might be highly suggestive of life, but not conclusive evidence. What kinds of observations of an exoplanets could enable us to say with ceartainty ""there is life on this planet""? Short of telescopic observations of truly unbelievable detail, I cannot think of a way that we can look at a planet and say ""yes there is life on it, or no there is not"" other than perhaps if seeing lights on the dark side of the planet. </p>

<p>Edit: Actually, I forgot the obvious scenario where there are trees/grass on the exoplanet.  But I don't think the plant life is required to be a different color from the rest of the terrain, and a planet with aliens does not have to have plant life. So we might not be able to detect life visually.</p>

"How does an accreting black hole acquire magnetic fields?","<p>There is actually a similar question on this site: <a href=""https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/questions/8525/can-magnetism-escape-a-black-hole"">Can magnetism escape a black hole?</a>, however the answers do not focus on accretion, which is my main concern, so I start a new one.</p>

<p>In Kip Thorne's book <em>Black Holes and Time Warps: Einstein's Outrageous Legacy</em>, there is a paragraph in Chapter 9, describing how the central black hole of a quasar (or radio galaxy) acquires a magnetic field through accretion:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Where do these magnetic field lines come from? From the disk itself.
  All gas in the Universe is magnetized, at least a little bit, and the [accretion] disk's gas is no exception. As, bit by bit, the disk's gas accretes into the hole,
  it carries its magnetic field lines with it. Upon nearing the hole, each
  bit of gas slides down its magnetic field lines and through the horizon,
  leaving the field lines behind, sticking out of the horizon and threading
  it [...]. These threading field lines, firmly
  confined by the surrounding disk, should then extract the hole's
  rotational energy by the Blandford—Znajek process.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unfortunately this description does not seem clear to me (although Thorne generally is excellent in explaining things throughout the book). To be specific, I cannot get a picture of the gas ""sliding down"" its magnetic field lines through the event horizon, while making the magnetic field ""stick out"" of the horizon at the same time. And here Thorne did not seem to point to any original research papers for further study.</p>

<p>So, my questions are:</p>

<p>(1) Do today's astronomers still believe that disk accretion is the main process by which supermassive black holes acquire a magnetic field?</p>

<p>(2) If the answer to (1) is ""yes"", then how can I build the picture (if there is such a picture) that Thorne is trying to convey in his paragraph?</p>

<p>(3) Is there any research paper that addresses this problem to some detail?</p>

As I was looking at that, one of the stars seemed to disappear in front my eyes. I thought it an illusion and carried on looking and about 6-7secs later a star appeared to the right of where I thought I saw one disappear initially. The light stayed for about 2secs and off it went again. I felt like someone was flashing a torch or even space station personnel having a call and response (baffled). One thing I was sure of was that it wasn't a plane as I am an Aeronautics man by profession and am familiar with all aircraft strobes. Another 6-7secs later it reappeared even further to the right than the second time round. For the next 11mins or so it came on and off at those regular intervals and yet still traveling to the right until it was out of my sight. tried to record a video of it with my phone but it wouldn't pick it up nor could it the other brighter stars.

<p>But what I wonder is, whether the fact that just the outer stars are attracted to more mass, because there is more mass of stars that are within the orbits of the outer stars, explains the equality?

so I will have    0.1 arc sec = 3pc/distance, and solve for distance as the answer.

"Estimating the angle covered by the star trails and deducing how long the exposure lasted","<p>How would you estimate the angle covered by the star trails and deduce how long the exposure lasted in the following image?</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/fh0iZ.jpg""></p>

<p>Here is the photo's caption:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Star trails beyond the Gemini Observatory on Mauna Kea, from which a laser beam forms a guide star on the Earth's ionosphere that enables the use of adaptive optics. In this long exposure, the laser beam tracks across the sky, making the visible arc. (The object in the sky at which the laser was pointed changed several times during the night.) Note that stars rise and set at an angle (not perpendicular) relative to the horizon, because Hawaii is about 20 degrees north of Earth's equator. Also, the farther a star is from the pole, the more its path looks straight, over a short distance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I read <a href=""https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20081024132334AAP642v"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the answer to this question about how to measure star trail angles</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The only star trail angles I'm familiar with deal with astrophotography.
  You set up a camera, put the film in, open the shutter for a time exposure of the stars. As the stars appear to revolve around the earth, they make ""arcs"" on the film.</p>
  
  <p>To calculate the angle of the arc, use the formula: 1 minute of time = 15 minutes of arc. If the answer is over 60, divide by 60 to get degrees of arc. So: 12 minute exposure = 180 minutes of arc or 3˚ of arc length for your star trail. </p>

<p>I'm not sure how to approach this problem since the answer uses time to calculate the angle of the arc, but no time is given here.</p>

"Transit Depth Color Versus Transmission Spectroscopy","<p>One of the tools being developed for the study of exoplanets is called <A HREF=""http://www.exoclimes.com/topics/transmission-spectroscopy/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">transmission spectroscopy</A> - basically looking at how passing through the exoplanet's atmosphere changes the spectrum of the star. The problem, though, is that spectroscopy is hard, and requires a big telescope, probably space-based. This makes the process slow. It seems that it would be very useful if we would triage the data using broad-band photometry to more quickly limit the presence of compounds like water, $\mathrm{CO}_2$, and $\mathrm{O}_3$. Looking at a plot of <A HREF=""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7c/Atmospheric_Transmission.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Earth's atmospheric transmission</A>, with a breakdown by chemical compound, it seems like looking at the color of the transit depths in and between the windows in the wavelength range from 1 to 20 microns, might provide a plausible alternative to quickly get information on the atmospheres of planets and brown dwarf stars.</p>

<p>I don't know what the teacher wants to highlight, i.e by saying that the formal expression of the total number density of galaxies is problematic in practice, given that I even haven't the kind of expression or equation which gives the estimation of galaxy density.</p>

<p><strong>1) Concerning this distribution to use, do you advise me to use a distribution as a function of magnitude, mass or a distribution as function of luminosity (like Schechter) ?</strong></p>

<p><strong>2) I have seen on web the HMF (Halo Mass function) but it seems to be about the dark matter halos : can we count one dark matter halo per galaxy ?</strong></p>

<p><strong>3) But the problem is here is that a dark matter halo is more massive than the galaxy hosted in this halo : how can we deal with this ?</strong> </p>

<p>If someone could help me, this would be kind.</p>

<p><strong>PS:</strong> <strong>I have also to explain why the estimation of galaxies density is difficult and problematic</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>4) What are the issues when we want to estimate density of galaxies ?</strong></p>

<p>Traditional mirror periscopes work well, but when I look into the one end of the periscope, I see the reflected image at the end of a long tube. I figure that using some combination of lenses, you should be able to make it look as if the position of your eye/head was actually <strong>at the top</strong> of the tube looking out at the world rather than looking <strong>through</strong> a tube. </p>

<p>My thinking here is that when you look through binoculars or a telescope, you don't see the inside of the tube, just the enlarged image. So shouldn't you be able to do the same thing but without the magnification?</p>

<p>I purchased some lenses from Amazon with focal lengths of 200mm and -100mm and based on some optics simulators assumed(incorrectly apparently) that I could arrange them 10cm apart and then another set reversed on the other side like so:</p>

<p>`````()````````````````)(```````````)(``````````````()<br/>
200mm````````-100mm``-100mm```````200mm</p>

<p>() = convex lens<br/>
)( = concave lens</p>

<p>The thinking here was that one set would condense the image down so that the walls of the tube were no longer visible within that viewing angle, and then the other reversed set would reverse that and the image would be back at normal size to my eye, it would just look as though my eye were actually at the opposite end of the tube. </p>

<p>This didn't work. The image is close to life size, but the tube looks even longer: a foot long tube has turned into a 3 foot long tube, and the circle I can see the world through is very small.</p>

<p>Is this a pipe dream? I feel like it must be possible if they used periscope in military applications for years before electronics and fiber-optic cables were invented. </p>

<p>Where did I go wrong? Any guidance would be hugely appreciated.</p>

<p><strong>Edit: some follow up questions</strong></p>

<p>Am I stuck having a small field of view out of the end? Or would using a lower focal point(wide angle) lens allow me to see a wider angle?</p>

<p>Also, is there any way to have a variable length tube? For instance if I'm looking around a wall, is there a way to install the lenses so that the tube could be ""telescoped"" out to look around a thicker wall?</p>

"Is it ever possible that the graviation from the mass of kinetic rotational energy will overcome centrifugal force?","<p>This is, I think, somewhat intuitively obvious, but this comment got me thinking about this:</p>

<p><a href=""https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/questions/13563/what-is-gravitational-force/13571?noredirect=1#comment20082_13571"">what is gravitational force?</a></p>

<p>""Rotation speed can create centrifugal force opposing gravity and making things lighter,"" Rotation also stores energy, and energy is mass, per $E=mc^2$. A body spinning sufficiently fast will exert higher gravity, e.g. a slowly-spinning neutron star will have a weaker gravitational pull than equivalent neutron star that spins very fast.""</p>

<p>Intuitively, my answer is ""no way"", added mass by rotational velocity I would think, could never be extensive enough to counteract the ""flicking off"" or centrifugal force of very fast rotation.  Even with a Neutron Star I would think it's impossible, but I'm not 100% sure, so I thought I'd ask.</p>

<p>If we ignore relativity from motion but not $E=mc^2$, as that's the crux of the question</p>

<p>Centrifugal force = $m v^2/r$</p>

<p>Kinetic energy of rotation = $1/2 I w^2 = 1/5 m v^2$</p>

<p>Mass equivalent of kinetic energy = $1/5 m v^2/c^2$</p>

<p>gravitational force $g=\frac{Gm}{r^2}$</p>

<p>so if we apply the gravitational force of kinetic energy</p>

<p>$g = G(1/5 m * v^2/c^2) / r^2$, or, simplified, $G*m*v^2 / r^2 c^2$</p>

<p>and we compare the two equations 
Centrifugal  $m v^2/r$
additional gravitational   $G*m*v^2 / r^2 c^2$</p>

<p>we can remove $m*v^2$ from both on the top and 1 $r$ from the bottom</p>

<p>additional gravitation ratio to centrifugal force = $G/r * c^2$</p>

<p>$G$ and $c$ are numerical.    $G$ is very small, $c$ is very big and the ratio grows smaller as the radius grows larger.</p>

<p>gravitational constant:   $6.67408 × 10^{-11} m^3 kg^{-1} s^{-2}
c = 2.998 x 10^8 m s-2</p>

<p>the ratio, unless my math is broken, centrifugal force to additional gravity from added mass by kinetic energy of motion = $1/r * 1.35 * 10^{27}$, so you'd need a hugely small r, almost a plank length or a singularity where the added gravity from kinetic energy of rotation would overcome the ""flicking off the surface"" or centrifugal force.  </p>

<p>When I work out the units, I get meters per kilogram, which I don't think is right.   The units should cancel out with a ratio of two forces in opposite directions, so I think I made an error, but I don't see where I made it.</p>

<p>My question is two fold.    1) is my math broken? and if so, where?   and 2) is the added mass from kinetic rotational energy ever relevant, say in a very rapidly rotating Neutron star?   Could it ever assist the Neutron star in collapse or add gravity?, I can see how it could add to flattening, as rotation flattens objects naturally and perhaps, add a speck of gravity on the polls where centrifugal force is zero, but logically, I think, rotational energy would end up spinning any non black hole object apart, long before the added energy of rotation had enough mass to make a measurable difference on gravity.    Is my sense right or is there a situation where added mass from energy of rotation could overcome the centrifugal force?</p>

"number density of Dark Matter Halos Versus number density of Galaxies","<p><strong>Can we count only one dark matter halo for each Galaxy ?</strong></p>

<p>Indeed, I am trying to estimate the total density of galaxies in given volume and I have often seen on physics exchange and other forums the estimation of dark matter halos distribution (as a function of the mass of halo or as a function of Luminosity).</p>

<p>If I could count one galaxy per halo, this would make the things simplier but I think that things are more complicated, especially since a halo and the galaxy associated to this halo have not the same mass, so distribution mass is different (mass of halo is not linear towards the mass of galaxy, isn't it ?).</p>

"Will we see gravitational waves from the big bang?","<p>This is almost identical to an unanswered question already asked, but I want to put it a different way. The announced LIGO event was from a localized source. I assume that gravitational waves from the Big Bang would come from ""everywhere"" like the CMB, so I don't see how LIGO or the next generation observatory (ie. eLISA) would detect this.</p>

<p>One thing else I would like to know, if anyone is aware: I watched an hour long webcast on You Tube and the question I had during the whole time was asked just as the webcast went ""off the air"". My question is that, since this announcement is about five months after the detection and since it happened ""right away"", has anything else been detected over the last five months? (Has LIGO been continuously observing? I know that the upgrade is still in progress and sensitivity should get about three times better.)</p>

"Why can we detect gravitational waves?","<p>Now that LIGO has finally measured gravitational waves using a huge laser interferometer, to me, the question remains, why was it possible? As it is explained in many news articles, gravitational waves are similar to water waves or electromagnetic waves, they just do not exist in a medium like water or space, but space-time itself is the transport medium. If space-time itself gets contracted and expanded by the gravitational waves, so does any means of measurement. The ruler you use for measurement (the laser beam) gets deformed while the wave travels through the measuring device. Otherwise the ""ruler"" had to live outside of space-time, but there is no outside. If space-time was a cup filled with pudding, on which we had painted a straight line with 10 marks, pushing into the pudding slightly with our thumb does bend the line, but for us, there remain 10 marks on the line, because to measure the extension, we had to use a ruler, outside of our space-time (pudding) to measure, let's say, 11 marks. But, well, there is no outside. I assume the same happens not only to the 3 spacial dimensions but also to the time dimension. Because they ""did it"", what am I missing?</p>

<p>We have not done any work on this so far, but for very large mirror arrays, e.g. 25000 heliostats, the raytracer takes quite a while to converge.

<p>This is why we are looking for faster ways to evaluate the optical performance of these systems while still getting highly accurate results.</p>

<p>I have calculated the ellipticity of a spiral galaxiy with two different methods using data from SDSS DR7. First I used the method using the stokes parameters and second I used the values for isoA and isoB. Both calculations where done in the <em>r-band</em>. </p>

<p>The data can be obtained with the following CAS Query:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT
    g.objid as objId,
    /*  stoke parameters*/
    q_r,u_r,
     /*  iso_a, iso_b */
    isoA_r,isoB_r
FROM Galaxy AS g
WHERE
    g.objid = 587722982832013381
</code></pre>

<p>yielding the result</p>

<pre><code>objId: 587722982832013381   
q_r : -0.1206308    
u_r: 0.002988584    
isoA_r: 169.3949    
isoB_r: 84.78848
</code></pre>

<p>The ellipticity by stoke parameters is given by</p>

<p>$$
e  = 1 - \frac{b}{a} = 1 - \frac{1 - \sqrt{Q^2 + U^2}}{1 + \sqrt{Q^2 + U^2}}.
$$</p>

<p>The ellipticity from isoA and isoB is very given by</p>

<p>$$
e  = 1 - \frac{isoB}{isoA}.
$$</p>

<p>But I get completely different results when I use isoA and isoB or the stoke parameters. I get:</p>

<pre><code>ellipticity from stoke parameters: 0.2153498356
ellipticity from 1-(isoA/isoB): 0.4994626166
</code></pre>

<p>The results can be reproduced with the following python code:</p>

<pre><code>import math

def ellipticityStokes(q, u):
    e = 1 - ((1-math.sqrt((q**2) + (u**2)))/(1+math.sqrt((q**2) + (u**2))))
    return e

def ellipticityNormal(a, b):
    e = 1 - (b/a)
    return e

q = -0.1206308
u = 0.002988584 

isoA = 169.3949  
isoB = 84.78848

print(str(ellipticityStokes(q,u))) #0.2153498356239003
print(str(ellipticityNormal(isoA,isoB))) #0.4994626166431221
</code></pre>

<p>Looking at the image</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/gD8HT.jpg"" width=""200"" height=""200""></p>

<p>(and compare with this <a href=""https://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/Sept11/Buta/Buta5.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">website from Buta</a>) I would say the value 0.4994626166 (from isoA and isoB) makes more sense. The value calculated from the stokes parameters is just wrong I think. </p>

<p>What is the mistake here? I would expect both calculations to yield similar results.</p>

<p>However for newer data releases isoA and isoB are not available any more because they seem not to trust those value? What should I do with newer data releases as DR12?</p>

"Minimum Mass Solar Nebulae Scaling Factors","<p>I'm attempting to build a MMSN, I've been trying for about... a week to get an intuition on the scaling factors for calculating the mass of the disks, I'm not entirely sure how to think about it.

I'm not looking for a solution, I'm looking for intuition on how these scaling factors are found. </p>

<p>My understand is that you pick an element, (Fe), and compare that to the solar abundance (does this mean the abundance of Fe in the sun? From there I would look at the abundance of Fe in the cores of the planet and compare them somehow to get some sort of scaling factor. From what I understand Fe makes .14% of the suns mass, so if I know lets say that neptune has a mass of 17m(earth) how would I start finding the scaling factor. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The newly released picture shows the terrifying power of an actual
  supermassive black hole located in the galaxy Pictor A, some 500
  million light years distant.  <strong>This black hole is about 40 million
  times the mass of the Sun (that’s about 10 times larger than the black

"Is it fruitful to search for a correlation between rates of in-falling matter in black holes and the expansion rate of our universe?","<p>To my understanding, white holes are hypothetical objects that are time-reversed black holes; black holes gravitationally ""suck in"" matter whereas white holes ""spit"" matter back out. As such, I think it's a nice idea that the Big Bang could be the ""spitting of matter"" via a white hole (assuming such an object exists). </p>

<p>This got me wondering how one could experimentally test for such an object. Since the expansion rate of the universe is increasing, could one possible explanation be that a white hole is continually ""spitting out"" matter such that an increase of flux of in-falling matter/space could be observed as an increasing rate of expansion of out-pouring matter/space? While I don't know of a way to detect this, I was wondering whether the following idea was fruitful or not. </p>

<p>Given that a supermassive black hole is believed to be at the center of every galaxy, given that most galaxies (sans Andromeda) are receding away at a speed proportional to their distance relative to us observers, and given that the spatial distribution of matter in our universe is isotropic and homogeneous, could one build a simulation of such a concept? To emulate isotropy and homogeneity, one could use a random number generator corresponding to a uniform distribution to place ""galaxies"" along a grid; accounting for gravitational forces, one can simulate the time-evolution of these galaxies and compare rates of in-falling matter to find a correlation between the rate of in-falling matter and the expansion rate of the universe (likely as a function of time-elapsed, and age and size per black hole). While the simulation does not definitely prove anything, providing a correlation could be interesting in my opinion.</p>

<p>Is this a stupid idea, or is there a potential to build upon this idea? If it is not fruitful, I am curious as to why.</p>

"Why do pre-main sequence stars show lithium in absorption?","<p><a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.07270"" rel=""nofollow"">This paper</a> and <a href=""http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/0004-637X/816/1/21/pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">this paper</a> state without discussion that the presence of lithium absorption in the stars they observe as strong evidence of these stars being pre-main sequence stars. Because they state this without any discussion and justification, I assume that it's a commonly known and accepted fact.  The second of the two papers also state without discussion or justification that some observed strong H$\alpha$ emission was also evidence of the stars being pre-main sequence stars.</p>

<p>Googling around I was able to get a partial answer for why this is so.  Pre-main sequence stars retain their primordial lithium as they collapse, but at some point around when they become main sequence stars, the lithium in their photospheres is destroyed by fusing with protons. I haven't been able to find anything describing why H$\alpha$ emission is associated with pre-main sequence stars, other than this has been known for a very long time (since before at least 1945).</p>

<p>I am wondering</p>

<ul>
<li>What is it about becoming a main sequence star that causes the lithium to fuse with protons near the surface?</li>
<li>How fast is the lithium destroyed, and does this destruction occur right when the star enters the main sequence?  I'm wondering how definite the presence of lithium absorption is in saying whether a star has entered the main sequence or not.</li>
<li>Why is H$\alpha$ emission such a prominent feature of pre-main sequence stars?</li>

"Finding a location geographically of a celestial object, in this case the moon at one of its quarters","<p>Years ago it was mentioned to me the New Yorker magazine had a Young Moon “contest”; who could find the youngest moon; the thinnest crescent after a new moon. I knew enough to know that I would have to know exactly when the new moon occurred and more importantly where. The Thin Crescent wouldn’t be too hard as it would follow closely the sun. Still, not knowing where the new moon happened meant that I could see anything from nothing to a one day old moon. I knew the moon traversed about 13 degrees of arc a day in so doing about 7% Of its disc was illuminated so my chance of seeing a very thin crescent depended on the new moon happening to the east of me by some 6 to 12 hours, as the “record” was something in the realm of 9hours.</p>

<p>So the question arose in me “Where on the globe would an observer see any of the quarterly phases exactly over their meridian?” This question led to almanacs that used hours, minutes, seconds and hundredths of seconds of measurements, all starting from the celestial spheres Greenwich or zero longitude, the Vernal Equinox, that semi-fixed(a 26,000 year cycle) starting place for celestial longitude. My question is, how can I find and use that “exact” beginning zero “longitude?</p>

<p>In an extreme case, is it possible that a very distant Kuper Belt Object (KBO) would never be observed in prograde motion?  I imagine that if you were to observe a KBO that was in the direction of Earth's motion then there would be no contribution from the Earth's velocity on the observation and you would be able to see the object in prograde motion, no matter how slow it was travelling. However, such an object would likely be obscured by sunlight, since objects that lie in the direction of Earth's motion lie above the day/night interface on the Earth.  My question here is that, given real-life observational constraints (like sunlight) how far from the Sun would an object have to be to never be seen in prograde motion?  You can be mathematical.</p>

"What area of Proxima Centauri would need to be occluded for the effect to be observable on Earth?","<p>One of ideas of how <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakthrough_Starshot"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Breakthrough Starshot</a> could communicate data from Proxima Centauri is to have a massive swarm of the solar sail powered craft to pivot (with their sails) synchronously, taking either 'sideways' or 'head on' orientation to the star - in effect either obstructing it or revealing for an observer 'behind' - on Earth. If the swarm is big enough, it would cause an observable dimming of the star - and timing the pivots right it could encode data in the star's visible luminosity.</p>

<p>The primary question of viability of this idea lies in 'how big a swarm?'. What percentage, or what absolute area or a star like Proxima would need to be occluded for the effect to be observable?

"What effect does time dilation have on bodies orbiting close to Black Holes?","<p>As far as my (somewhat basic) knowledge of astrophysics goes in general the closer to a star your orbit gets smaller (because you travel less distance) and faster (because you're deeper in the gravity well and need to go quicker to avoid falling in.)</p>

<p>But what happens on bodies orbiting close to black holes and subject to time dilation as far as an external observer is concerned?</p>

<p>This question isn't about interstellar but it's a good point of reference. Take the water planet they drop onto where gravitational time dilation is enough to make 20 or 30 years pass to the external observers while only a few hours pass for them. (I don't know if this is a realistic rate(?) of time dilation.)</p>

<p>What would the apparent orbit of their planet be to the external orbit and what would his orbit appear to be for them? Even though he is further from the star would he complete more orbits in the elapsed time despite being further from the centre of the system? And would they appear to be orbiting ""slower"" than him from his point of view.</p>

<p>Out of interest, though perhaps a second question is more appropriate, how would the apparent difference in relative orbital speed affect rendezvous manoeuvres if at all?</p>

<p>For example would the standard decelerate and fall into a lower orbit still apply but the trajectory plotted from a static observer look weird as time dilation set in? Or would the manoeuvre have to be different to account for the apparent velocity difference? What would a non-circular orbit look like in this system when observed from a circular orbit?</p>

<p>Also is the velocity required for orbit so close to a black hole high enough that speed based relativity also comes into play?</p>

"How does the Gamma Ray Burst that occurred when 2 black holes merged compare to other GRB's?","<p>A Gamma Ray Burst was detected 0.4 seconds after the gravitational wave event, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_observation_of_gravitational_waves"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">GW150914</a>, caused by a black hole merger, and it was in the same part of the sky. It is uncertain whether <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_observation_of_gravitational_waves#Coincident_gamma-ray_observation"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">that Gamma Ray Burst was associated with the black hole merger</a>. The odds of a GRB being coincident (or just background noise) is 0.22%. That implies a 99.78% chance the black hole merger was related to the GRB. Later analysis suggests the GRB was just a background event that occurred in the same place in the sky at just 0.4 seconds after the black hole merger, and therefore not related.</p>

<p>While a GRB may have relativistic jets beaming out from it in opposite directions, research ""excludes the possibility that the event is associated with substantial gamma-ray radiation, directed towards the observer."" I interpret that to mean this GRB did <strong>not</strong> have relativistic jets, but was omnidirectional. (Not sure how astronomers came to that conclusion.)</p>

<p>Anyhow, whether it was coincident or not, I am asking about how the energy output of that GRB compares to other GRB's. The Wikipedia article in the link says the ""energy emission in gamma-rays and hard X-rays from the event was less than one millionth of the energy emitted as gravitational waves.""</p>

<p>How much energy does a typical GRB emit? What was the spectrum spread of a typical GRB? Over what amount of time does a typical GRB emit that energy? (How many seconds?)</p>

<p><strong>How do the energy levels, spectrums, and time durations of other GRB's compare to the GRB associated with the black hole merger?</strong></p>

<p>If it is similar to other GRB's, that would support the hypothesis this GRB was just a coincident event at nearly the same time and location in the sky.</p>

<p>If this GRB has different energy emissions and time duration than other GRB's, that would support the hypothesis it is truly associated with the black hole merger.</p>

"Why black holes have positive energy?","<p>How could Hawking get the conclusion ""[...] <strong>and black holes have positive energy</strong>. That’s why empty space is stable. Bodies such as stars or black holes cannot just appear out of nothing. But a whole universe can.""? It would make sense to me, if a black hole has negative energy.</p>

<p>Quote from book <em>The Grand Design</em>, page 180:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If the total energy of the universe must always remain zero, and it costs energy to create a body, how can a whole universe be created from nothing? That is why there must be a law like gravity. Because gravity is attractive, gravitational energy is negative: One has to do work to separate a gravitationally bound system, such as the earth and moon. This negative energy can balance the positive energy needed to create matter, but it’s not quite that simple. The negative gravitational energy of the earth, for example, is less than a billionth of the positive energy of the matter particles the earth is made of. A body such as a star will have more negative gravitational energy, and the smaller it is (the closer the different parts of it are to each other), the greater this negative gravitational energy will be. But before it can become greater than the positive energy of the matter, the star will collapse to a black hole, and black holes have positive energy. That’s why empty space is stable. Bodies such as stars or black holes cannot just appear out of nothing. But a whole universe can.</p>

"Theoretical sudden appearance of a black hole in BBC drama show *spoiler warning*","<p>I asked this on the ‘movies’ stackexchange site but they suggested I ask here, it’s a purely hypothetical query based on a BBC drama show called ‘Hard Sun’, feel free to kill the question if it’s inappropriate here.</p>

<p>In the TV show’s series finale an expected ‘extinction level event’ happens and appears to be a black hole close to our sun, it already has developed a spiral of hot gas around it drawn from the sun.</p>

<p>Clearly this is fiction but I’m keen to understand just how badly-considered this is. Firstly the show is set in London and everyone seems amazed when the image below rises from the dusk yet clearly it's been in existence for the time taken to create the spiral (hours at least?) so nations east of the UK would have seen it for that time and reported on it globally surely?</p>

<p>My real question is more around is there any potential scenario where a black hole of that size could develop suddenly and get to that size quickly enough for that image to be a surprise? My understanding, very much as a scientific-layman, is that a black hole of that size would have to have the mass of at least one of our suns to get to that size (probably more) - is that a valid assumption? If so where has the mass come from? Also wouldn't the sudden existence of something else with at least the same mass as our sun suddenly appearing at the centre of our solar system have enormous gravitational impact on everything in the system, including Earth? We'd have massive volcanic/tectonic impact wouldn't we?</p>

"If the earth was not tilted, what would be the north star?","<p>What is earth tipped toward? The simple answer is Polaris.  The axis (one end of it) points at Polaris, so that's what it's tipped to point at.  But when we saw ""toward"" what do we mean? When it is tipped ""toward"" one thing, what is it being tipped ""away from""?</p>

<p>If earth were not tipped then the equator would lie in the same plane as earth's orbit.  Earth being tipped 23 degrees means it is tipped 23 degrees ""away from"" alignment with its orbit.  So a 0 degree tip would be ""not tipped"" and a 23 degree tip is tipped 23 degrees in some direction.  What direction is it tipped in?  Another way to ask this would be, what would it be tipped at if it was tipped a full 90 degrees in the general direction in which it is currently tipped 23 degrees?</p>

<p>Imagine a coordinate system with two axes in the plane of earth's orbit and one axis perpendicular to that plane.  Earth's orbit stays in the plane, and the angle that earth is tipped points to, let's say, negative X.  So the line through the north pole and south pole lies in the XY plane and the earth's orbit lies in the XZ plane.  I want to look at stars and be able to see those axes, so I want to know what stars they roughly point at.</p>

<p>A cleaner way to ask this might be, what would be the north star if earth wasn't tipped? What would be the south star? What if it was tipped 90 degrees? That gives four of the six stars I'm looking for. I'm not sure how to phrase the question for the other two.  I want to call these stars ""untipped north"", ""untipped south"", ""winter"", ""summer"", ""spring"", and ""fall"" because the direction of the stars would be the same as the direction earth is from the sun during the extremes of those seasons (northern hemisphere).</p>

<p>[EDIT]</p>

<p>The plane of earth's orbit is aligned with a celestial (infinitely distant) great circle called the ecliptic.  It inversely happens to also be the path through the sky that the sun takes over the course of a year.

From subtracting both of these numbers, I get 3 days plus about 2 hours 45 minutes and 52 seconds. So to answer this question I will get 2 hours 45 minutes 52 seconds behind. My answer is that I will see the moon set at 13:45:52 PM. Do I right? I don't understand why the time I get is behind instead of earlier as the question about the Arcturus I asked before. I'm also not sure that does the declination of the moon and the position of the observer relate or not too. Thank you very much:)</p>

"Relationship between metallicity and color? Should Pop.

  disk stars <br>
  open clusters <br>
  metal rich makes stars redder</p>
  
  <p>Population II<br>

<p>And I also found (from: <a href=""http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Starlog/pop12.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Starlog/pop12.html</a>): </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Population I stars include the sun and tend to be luminous, hot and young, concentrated in the disks of spiral galaxies. They are particularly found in the spiral arms. With the model of heavy element formation in supernovae, this suggests that the gas from which they formed had been seeded with the heavy elements formed from previous giant stars. About 2% of the total belong to Population I.</p>
  
  <p>Population II stars tend to be found in globular clusters and the nucleus of a galaxy. They tend to be older, less luminous and cooler than Population I stars. They have fewer heavy elements, either by being older or being in regions where no heavy-element producing predecessors would be found. Astronomers often describe this condition by saying that they are ""metal poor"", and the ""metallicity"" is used as an indication of age.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><b>If Population I stars are metal rich and therefore appear red, how can they be luminous, hot, and young, and concentrated in disk (the region of star formation)? Shouldn't they appear blue? How does color relate to metallicity?</b></p>

<p>Hot stars should be blue, shouldn't they? As stated here for example:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A star’s color is critical in identifying the star, because it tells us the star’s surface temperature in the black body radiation scale. The sun has a surface temperature of 5,500 K, typical for a yellow star. Red stars are cooler than the sun, with surface temperatures of 3,500 K for a bright red star and 2,500 K for a dark red star. The hottest stars are blue, with their surface temperatures falling anywhere between 10,000 K and 50,000 K.

"Problem with denoising the BICEP2 data?","<p>This question pertains to <a href=""http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-31058529"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a> article which talks about why the BICEP2 measurements of B-mode polarization in Cosmic microwave background radiation turned out to be noise from galactic stardust. They go on to add that the Plank data of the noise does not lend to getting a good B-mode estimate from the BICEP2 data.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>However, the results of the joint assessment would suggest that
  whatever signal BICEP2 detected, it cannot be separated at any
  significant level from the spoiling effects. In other words, the
  original observations are equally compatible with there being no
  primordial gravitational waves. ""This joint work has shown that the
  detection of primordial B-modes is no longer robust once the emission
  from galactic dust is removed,"" Jean-Loup Puget, principal
  investigator of Panck's HFI instrument, said in the Esa statement.
  ""So, unfortunately, we have not been able to confirm that the signal
  is an imprint of cosmic inflation.""</p>

<p>Can someone explain why(from a signal processing perspective) exactly the detection of primordial B-modes is not robust even after the emission from galactic dust is removed? And what are the proposed workarounds to tackle this problem?</p>

"Can we see the stars at the edge of the Milkyway?","<p>This question proved much more difficult to formulate than I initially imagined. It concerns how far out in the Milky Way that we actually see with different telescopes. I know the Milky Way disk is about 100k light years wide, its halo a couple of times that wide, and most of the naked eye stars are within 1000 light years. I also know that when many stars are close together they are more visible, which means we can easily see for example the double cluster in Perseus at about 7000 light years with our naked eyes. But if you take a large telescope and peer into the distance, how easily do you see through the star fields until the point where you have no more foreground stars in the field of view, and all that is there are the numerous faint galaxies lurking in the back. For example, in the Hubble Deep field you see a few stars. Are we looking at the last few stars at the edge of the Milky Way, or are there more hidden in the field that we can't see because they are too far away/too faint?</p>

<p>I realize that there are dust clouds in the Milky Way obscuring the view, so if you look towards the galactic center you would definitely not see all the way to the other side. But lets assume we're looking perpendicular to the galactic plane. Lets also say that you're using a 16"" telescope, allowing you to see maybe down to the 15th magnitude. Do you see the stars at the edge of the galaxy?</p>

<p>Another way of approaching the question... From what I've read it seems we estimate the Milky Way to contain about 250 billion stars. I also read that the Gaia satellite will map about 1 billion stars. Does that mean our best telescopes are only able to discern 1/250 of the stars in the Milky Way? Of course all stars on the other side the galaxy disk are hidden from us, so they surely account for a large portion of the invisible stars. But looking straight up from the galactic plane, can we see the last galactic stars before the empty intergalactic ""void""?</p>

"What would the tides on the Trappist-1 planets be like?","<p>In the recent press conference about the planets orbiting around Trappist-1, one of the astronomers mentioned that the planets are close enough to each other that the tidal forces between planets are non-negligible. Supposing there were oceans on 1, 2 or all 3 of the planets in the habitable zone. What would the tides on these planets look like?</p>

<p>Because the dynamics of planet-planet interactions would be quite different from a planet-moon interaction, the tides would be far more complicated than a sinusoidal low-tide/high-tide at any given point on the planet. The abstract of the Nature paper on these planets states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The six inner planets form a near-resonant chain, such that their orbital periods (1.51, 2.42, 4.04, 6.06, 9.1 and 12.35 days) are near-ratios of small integers.</p>

"Entropy of black hole","<p>A line from one of the <a href=""https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/a/8769"">answers</a> on a different question got me thinking:</p>

  <p>The simplest way to see this is probably that a black hole has a much
  higher entropy than a star or even another type of stellar remnant of
  even vaguely similar mass and so there simply could not exist a
  spontaneous process by which a black hole develops back into a star.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, I agree a black hole turning into a star seems far-fetched since it's a one-way trip (like you can't recover a block of sugar from a glass of water to that exact form). But as far as I know entropy is the amount of disorder. A black hole is denser than a star. For a density that high, I assume a certain amount of order (inverse entropy?) is required. It's an enormous amount of mass in a small amount of space, keeping itself together. Sounds to me like a system, not like a random collection of mass.</p>

<p>How can the amount of order necessary for such dense objects as black holes be lower than that of the star they originate from?</p>

"What will happen when landing on Jupiter?","<p>Jupiter is a gas giant, so landing on it will not be like landing on Earth, our Moon or Mars etc., as it <strong>does not</strong> have a <em>solid</em> surface like these.</p>

<p>If we have a hypothetical spaceship or probe landing on Jupiter, and it can withstand the enormous pressure, what or how will be the sequence of events?</p>

<p>I already read <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploration_of_Jupiter"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A major problem in sending space probes to Jupiter is that the planet
  has no solid surface on which to land, as there is a smooth transition
  between the planet's atmosphere and its fluid interior. Any probes
  descending into the atmosphere are eventually crushed by the immense
  pressures within Jupiter.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What I do not understand:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is this enormous or immense pressure of atmosphere or Jupiter's <em>surface</em>?</li>
<li>While descending, will we know that we have transitioned from the atmosphere to the <em>surface</em>?</li>
<li>Why does animated footage (real or conceptual) of Jupiter appear like a high viscous liquid (e.g. lava) rotating in an opposite direction, rather that gas(es)?</li>
<li>Does Jupiter have an inner solid core?</li>

<p>We see that 12-hours day happens around 17-18 of March, however the Vernal Equinox takes place on 20 March 2017, 10:29 GMT.</p>

<p>I understand that due to refraction in the Earth's atmosphere and due to the fact that sunrises and sunsets are defined by the top of the Sun's disk, sunrises are ""earlier"" and sunsets are ""later"", so the 12-hours day indeed should happen before the equinox.</p>

<p>But why the directions of sunrise and sunset are east--west on that same day? The above factors should not influence <em>directions</em>, should they?</p>

"How precisely is planetary tilt defined (the tilt direction, not just the angle)?","<p>The earth's axis is titled 23.4 degrees with respect to the ecliptic. Since this tilt is responsible for the seasons, it's clear that the tilt is in the direction away from the sun on the shortest day of year in the winter (on the northern hemisphere). That uniquely defines the tilt direction for me. How do we define the tilt direction for the other planets, though? What is the proper way of determining in what direction the tilt of a planet occurs?</p>

"How does gravity have an effect from the inside the event horizon of a black hole with the rest of the universe?","<p>According to general relativity, as I understand it, the space around a black hole's event horizon is distorted by gravity, such that the distance to a point approaching the event horizon from an observational point further out from the EH approaches infinity.</p>

<p>So if the distance to any mass inside the EH appears to be infinite, how does this mass assert gravitational effects outside the EH?</p>

<ul>
<li>ellipticity from stoke parameters or the flux-weighted second moment as described <a href=""http://www.sdss.org/dr12/algorithms/classify/#photo_stokes"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>. </li>

Wouldn't everything be infinity magnified (if its mass independent empty space should work, right)?

"What should I expect to see with my telescope with what EP's?","<p>Recently got a Celestron 130 SLT (first ""real"" scope) and have a question. I have the following:</p>

<p>130mm F/5 newtonian, 650mm focal length scope</p>

<p>9 and 25mm factory EP's (more on that later)</p>

<p>Svbony 2x barlow</p>

<p>Very, very dark skies (100 miles from any cities, out in the desert, light pollution maps show ""zero light pollution"" on the maps anywhere I view from once I'm 5 minutes from home). I don't have expensive glass, I don't know what I'm doing... but at least I have this going for me :-) </p>

<p>4500 elevation with low mountains on either side, 10-25 miles away  (don't know that it matters) </p>

<p>20/20 uncorrected vision (if that makes a difference)</p>

<p>I am curious what I should expect to be able to see with my scope, and at what magnification I should see them at? I plan to buy 3 EP's, and want to know the lowest and highest I should buy to see what I ""should"" be seeing. I don't want to pursue things that I won't be able to make out clearly anyways, or buy the wrong EP's for seeing those things. I see anywhere from 25 to 60 X your scope size, which is a wide range of mags. </p>

<p>I have beautifully-dark skies, so I'm not sure if the EP has to do with light pollution also, or solely ""seeing"". </p>

<p>Will I be able to make out cassini's division? Will I be able to complete the messier list? </p>

<p>I have nothing in-person to compare my scope to, so I'm relying on random internet information, which tells me my max magnification is anywhere from 150 to 250, and varying features and objects that I will be able to see. Any input will be greatly appreciated. I plan to start the lunar observing program soon (LOVE the moon, mostly because of my spaceflight interest and occupation), and have only looked at the moon so far, along with learning my constellations. </p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

"How do I measure occultation for the upcoming lunar eclipse?","<p>I'm trying to simulate the lunar eclipse on Jan. 31, similar to <a href=""http://time.com/4882923/total-solar-eclipse-map-places-view/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this simulation</a> I made of last year's solar eclipse, using Three.js. I have the minute-by-minute coordinates for the Sun and the Moon in the J2000 frame -- where Earth is always at [0,0,0] -- and need to calculate the degree of occultation at each moment.</p>

<p>I'm treating the Sun as a point, since that's how 3D lighting works in Three.js, and came up with what I think is a clever solution to account for the penumbra: I calculated what size the Earth would have to be to create the penumbra from a point instead of a large spherical light source, like so:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ADFdJ.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ADFdJ.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>(This obviously isn't to scale, but the inner circle would be the actual earth, the black lines are the penumbral rays from the Sun, and the blue lines originate from the center of the sun but reach the plane of the moon (the little gray guy) at exactly the same point.)</p>

<p>To test whether this actually works, I need to calculate the occultation of the moon and my imaginary Penumbral Earth (which is 8154.15km in radius), and compare those figures to <a href=""https://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/LEplot/LEplot2001/LE2018Jan31T.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Fred Espenak's calculations</a>.</p>

<p>I found <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5188561/signed-angle-between-two-3d-vectors-with-same-origin-within-the-same-plane"">this StackOverflow post</a> on how to calculate the angle between two vectors in 3D space. What I can't figure out his how to determine the apparent width of that angle and whether it is greater than the sum of the apparent radii of the Earth and Moon. I thought the Law of Cosines would be sufficient, but it accounts for the distance between the Earth and Moon as well. Here's a to-scale simulation showing the path of the moon over 24-hours on Jan. 31, with the Sun way off-screen:</p>

<p>One idea I had was to measure the vector from the sun to the outer edge of the fake earth, and the vector from the sun to the inner edge of the moon, but cannot figure out how to determine the points on the sphere where these vectors would be tangent. (I <a href=""https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2615021/calculating-the-tangent-line-from-a-point-to-the-surface-of-a-sphere?noredirect=1#comment5400837_2615021"">posed this question</a> to Math StackExchange, but am hoping there's an easier way.)</p>

<p>While SPICE (via the Python wrapper spiceypy) was perfect for getting the locations of the bodies, it's occultation function doesn't allow for an arbitrary location of the observer, which eventually I will need to account for.</p>

<p>Is there an easy--or difficult--equation for occultation? Thanks!</p>

"Are they really sure this isn't an Airy disk? How was that ruled out?","<p>How do they know that this is a spherical shell of gas, and not just something like an Airy pattern-like artifact produced by the VLT's large interferometric aperture?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“We were able to construct an amazing image, and reveal the onion-like structure of the atmosphere of a giant star at a late stage of its life for the first time,” says Antoine Mérand, member of the team. “Numerical models and indirect data have allowed us to imagine the appearance of the star before, but it is quite astounding that we can now see it, and in colour.”</p>
  
  <p>Although it is only 15 by 15 pixel across, the reconstructed image shows an extreme close-up of a star 100 times larger than the Sun, a diameter corresponding roughly to the distance between the Earth and the Sun. This star is, in turn, surrounded by a sphere of molecular gas, which is about three times as large again.</p>
  
  <p>T Leporis, in the constellation of Lepus (the Hare), is located 500 light-years away. It belongs to the family of Mira stars, well known to amateur astronomers. These are giant variable stars that have almost extinguished their nuclear fuel and are losing mass. They are nearing the end of their lives as stars, and will soon die, becoming white dwarfs. The Sun will become a Mira star in a few billion years, engulfing the Earth in the dust and gas expelled in its final throes.</p>
  
  <p>Mira stars are among the biggest factories of molecules and dust in the Universe, and T Leporis is no exception. It pulsates with a period of 380 days and loses the equivalent of the Earth’s mass every year. Since the molecules and dust are formed in the layers of atmosphere surrounding the central star, astronomers would like to be able to see these layers. But this is no easy task, given that the stars themselves are so far away — despite their huge intrinsic size, their apparent radius on the sky can be just half a millionth that of the Sun.</p>
  
  <p>“T Leporis looks so small from the Earth that only an interferometric facility, such as the VLTI at Paranal, can take an image of it. VLTI can resolve stars 15 times smaller than those resolved by the Hubble Space Telescope,” says Le Bouquin.</p>
  
  <p>To create this image with the VLTI astronomers had to observe the star for several consecutive nights, using all the four movable 1.8-metre VLT Auxiliary Telescopes (ATs). The ATs were combined in different groups of three, and were also moved to different positions, creating more new interferometric configurations, so that astronomers could emulate a virtual telescope approximately 100 metres across and build up an image.</p>
  
  <p>“Obtaining images like these was one of the main motivations for building the Very Large Telescope Interferometer. We have now truly entered the era of stellar imaging,” says Mérand.</p>
  
  <p>A perfect illustration of this is another VLTI image showing the double star system Theta1 Orionis C in the Orion Nebula Trapezium. This image, which was the first ever constructed from VLTI data, separates clearly the two young, massive stars from this system. The observations themselves have a spatial resolution of about 2 milli-arcseconds. From these, and several other observations, the team of astronomers, led by Stefan Kraus and Gerd Weigelt from the Max-Planck Institute in Bonn, could derive the properties of the orbit of this binary system, including the total mass of the two stars (47 solar masses) and their distance from us (1350 light-years).</p>

My question is, how does this work with elements with only one shell, such as hydrogen? Also, what determines how many energy levels are dropped?</p>

<p>But if it's a warping of spacetime, not a particle phenomenon,  (or is it somehow?) How fast do these waves travel through space? Is it  constant or variable? Slower than the speed of light or even faster? If spacetime has no resistance per se, the what would keep them from traveling infinitely fast?</p>

"Determination of High-Accuracy Distances of Terrestrial Planets from the Sun","<p>I understand how in olden days the Sun-Planet distances were estimated using:-</p>

<p>(i) measures of planet orbital periods ($T$) from analysis of observations over several centuries;</p>

<p>(ii) <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler%27s_laws_of_planetary_motion"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Kepler's 3rd Law</a> $(T^2 = k.a^3)$ applied to the planet orbital periods to determine the relative lengths of the Sun-Planet semi-major axis distances ($a$) expressed in terms of the AU (astronomical unit = distance from centre of Earth to centre of Sun);</p>

<p>(iii) particular Earth-Planet distances along Solar radials were measured using <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallax"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Parallax</a> techniques such as that by <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanni_Domenico_Cassini"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Casinni</a> for Mars and <a href=""http://spiff.rit.edu/classes/phys445/gettys/venus_ex/venus_ex.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Transits of Venus</a>;</p>

<p>(iv) From one or more Earth-Planet radial distances the length of the AU could then be determined by simple algebra.</p>

<p>(v) Other Sun-Planet distances could then be determined once the AU length was found. </p>

<p>Modern ephemerides e.g. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_Propulsion_Laboratory_Development_Ephemeris"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">those issued by JPL</a> use various techniques:-</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The orbits of the inner planets are known to subkilometer accuracy through fitting radio tracking measurements of spacecraft in orbit about them. Very long baseline interferometry measurements of spacecraft at Mars allow the orientation of the ephemeris to be tied to the International Celestial Reference Frame with an accuracy of 0′′.0002. This orientation is the limiting error source for the orbits of the terrestrial planets, and corresponds to orbit uncertainties of a few hundred meters. </p>
  
  <p>The orbits of Jupiter and Saturn are determined to accuracies of tens of kilometers as a result of fitting spacecraft tracking data. </p>
  
  <p>The orbits of Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto are determined primarily from astrometric observations, for which measurement uncertainties due to the Earth’s atmosphere, combined with star catalog uncertainties, limit position accuracies to several thousand kilometers.</p>

<p>I understand how spaceraft telemetry has been used to obtain highly accurate distances between Earth and the terrestrial planets.  But I am not clear about how highly-accurate distances can be determined between those planets and the centre of the Sun. </p>

<p><strong>Question</strong></p>

<p>Do such (Sun-planet-distance) determinations still basically rely on (the more accurate Newtonian version of) Kepler's 3rd Law relating planet orbital period and Sun-planet semi-major axis distance?  </p>

<p>$$\frac{T^2}{a^3} = \frac{4 \pi^2}{G(M+m)}$$</p>

<p>What other methods or assumptions are used/involved?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT - Afterthoughts</strong></p>

<p>After further thought prompted by feedback from  u/atmosphericprisonescape
my question boils down to  ""How are the positions (over time) of the Sun's Centre tied-in (with sub-kilometre accuracy) to the 4D space-time array of triangulated, high-accuracy, telemetry-derived, Terrestrial planet position determinations. </p>

<p>I guess that Kepler's 3rd Law is not invoked as such. Rather, high-accuracy (sub-kilometre) determinations of the position of the Solar centre presumably require (in addition to the high-accuracy planet positions) some specific deterministic ""motivation model""; i.e. a model of motion-determining factors.  </p>

<p>These factors would include Newtonian Inertia, Newtonian Gravitational forces and Non-Newtonian factors leading to additional orbital angular velocity (cf Non-Newtonian Perihelion Precession and General Relativity as described at <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apsidal_precession"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""> wikipedia/Apsidal_precession</a> ).  </p>

<p>The ""motivation model"" would constrain the relative positions of the Sun and planets via their involment as motion generators, reactors and enactors. </p>

"Special Relativity as Applied to an Interstellar Starship?","<p>I'm once again confused by the twin paradox. Let's say I am on an interstellar starship flying at 0.6c from a star 30 light years away from Earth to a star 50 light years away from Earth and 40 light years from each other. How would you estimate the difference between the time on the ship when you reach the destination versus the time a person on Earth thinks it should be? Now let's say I travel back to the original star (In both circumstances, I accelerate at 1g until reaching 0.6c.) I would assume that I could use the twin paradox formula to determine the difference in elapsed time on the ship from that measured by a clock left at the first star.</p>

<p>Now, let's say I'm traveling in the same manner (1g acceleration until reaching 0.6c and 1g deceleration for the same duration until arrival) beginning at Earth, traveling to 16 stars and returning to Earth. I am thinking that the time difference between the ship clock (date) and Earth time would be based on the distance and acceleration/ deceleration segments of each leg of the journey independent of the components of the travel vectors in the direction (toward or away from the Earth). Am I right??</p>

<p>Would Earth send messages to the ship based on conventional measurements (ie Physics 101)? I would want to determine the difference between the time on Earth when the message is sent and the ship time when the message is received, considering of course the time of transit of the message (at light speed).</p>

They stopped short of saying that the tangential velocity of this spin rate is ""c"" (and how can a singularity have a ""tangential velocity""?) They did say that the event horizon at maximum spin of a stellar black hole is about 1-1/2 km. and that if a black hole were to spin faster then the result would be a ""naked black hole"" that would defy the laws of physics (GR). </p>

"Why doesn't the equipartition theorem disallow spinning dust?","<p>This <a href=""https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/a/22996/7982"">excellent answer</a> to the question <em>What is the physics of the “spinning dust” contribution to Cosmic Microwave Background measurements?</em> Is well sourced. The abstract of one of the papers there, Purcell 1975 <a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1975duun.book..155P"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Interstellar grains as pinwheels</a> begins with:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Contrary to the assumption usually made in theories of grain alignment, the rotational energy of an interstellar grain is likely to be very much greater than 3/s kT, where T is the gas temperature, or the grain temperature, or any other temperature in the system. Any more or less permanent irregularity of the grain’s surface with respect to accommodation coefficient, distribution of H-H recombination sites, or photoelectric emissivity will result in an unbalanced torque capable of spinning the grain up to high angular velocity. Such a grain is, in effect, the rotor of a heat engine.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the body of the paper, the first example given is of a sort-of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought_experiment"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">gedankenexperiment</a> involving a hypothetical <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crookes_radiometer"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Crookes radiometer</a> with the gas removed. The author explains that it would spin up to high energy (without saying how):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[...] The kinetic energy of the rotating paddle wheel is now enormously greater than it would be if it were immersed in, and en equilibrium with, a 6000 K radiation field, for then it would exhibit only a residual “Brownian rotation” appropriate to that temperature. So the wheel is really a heat engine, depending on the difference between the temperature of the vanes and that of the radiation field to which they are exposed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Without the gas to cool them, I suppose that after the whole thing reaches equilibrium temperature the black sides radiate more strongly than the white sides and so there should always be a torque, and the final speed and kinetic energy would be limited only by friction and other practical losses.</p>

<p><a href=""https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/a/11577/7982"">This excellent answer</a> to the question <em>What is the difference between gas and dust in astronomy?</em> points out that there is no real distinction between the two, but that they are limits in size, gas particles being small and dust particles being large(r).</p>

<p>So if dust can become pinwheels, then I have a hunch that very very large molecules can do this too, and if so, then so can smaller molecules. All you need is some mechanism for torque. Molecules can certainly have a non-uniform distribution of  H-H recombination probability just as dust can, and they can have some regions that are concave and some that aren't.</p>

<p>This makes me wonder if these gas molecules no longer obey the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equipartition_theorem#Basic_concept_and_simple_examples"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Equipartition theorem</a> of thermodynamics. The spinning dust certainly doesn't. </p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> How can spinning dust and by induction, my hypothetical spinning molecules avoid conforming to the equipartition theorem? Why doesn't the equipartition theorem disallow spinning dust?</p>

"Symmetry in Hawking radiation?","<p>I have a question concerning how Hawking radiation works.</p>

<p>As I understand, a pair of particle-antiparticle may pop to existence near the event horizon (from a virtual particle).</p>

<p>Then it might happen that the negative particle (antimatter) gets captured by the black hole whereas the positive particle (matter) escapes.</p>

<p>This results in a net loss of the black hole mass. If you repeat this process an astonishing number of times the Black Hole might end up completely evaporating.</p>

<p>Am I right so far? (Even if the explanation is not very mathematical)</p>

<p><strong>My question then is:</strong> </p>

<p>This assumes that when a pair particle-antiparticle is created, a bias towards antiparticles being captured and particles escaping must exist.</p>

<p>Otherwise, the mass of the black hole might fluctuate, but in average for big numbers of pairs, equal percentage of particles and antiparticles would be captured/escape.</p>

<p>I was considering a different approach: </p>

<li>Use intervalometer in the camera firmware to take multiple photos of moderately long exposure, short enough that the stars don't blur into lines.</li>

<ul>
<li>A singularity implies having an event horizon and therefore a black hole. Since the mass is compressed in a zero volume space, if you get close enough there will be a point where the escape velocity gets bigger than the speed of light so you will get a black hole by definition.</li>
</ul>

<p>But what about the opposite? Does having an event horizon imply the existence of a singularity?</p>

<p>Could it be that you have a neutron star massive enough to reach a escape velocity equal to the speed of light but not strong enough to make the matter collapse?</p>

<p>Even if such star can not exist because the strong force collapses before reaching an event horizon, this doesn't mean an equivalence. </p>

<p>It just means that for some specific value of the maximum strong force this is not possible, but image now an imaginary exotic matter that has a way bigger strong force.</p>

<p>For such ""science fiction"" matter, it would be possible to reach an event horizon without collapsing to a singularity, right?</p>

<p>One of the big questions that still need answer and that Planck might help clarify is about the dynamics and driving mechanisms in the first phases of the universe, in particular in the period called <code>inflation</code>.</p>

<p><em>Thankfully</em> there is room for improvements at small scales, i.e. small pieces of sky observed with extremely high resolution, and more importantly for experiments to measure the polarisation of CMB.
I know that for the next years a number of polarisation experiments, mostly from ground and balloons, are planned (I'm not sure about satellites).</p>

<p>For sure some of these result will rule out some of the possible inflationary scenarios, but to which level?</p>

<p>Will we ever be able to say: ""inflation happened this way""?</p>

"Are the planets Trappist-1 in the solar system?","<p>I'm an Astronomy noob, but I'm interested in learning how stars and planets work. Everything started with the Trappist-1. I read about it, and it's fascinating. However, it's impossible for me to localize it with my current state of knowledge. Therefore, I would like to ask some general questions here. </p>

<p>First of all, during high school, I have learned that we are in the solar system and there are some planets orbiting the sun. Easy to remember and imagine, but there are stars, planets, constellations, etc. which I can't manage to relate to this basic system that I learned about. </p>

<p>And what confused me a lot are these two pictures: </p>

<p>And this definition of an exoplanet:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An exoplanet or extrasolar planet[...]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From the pictures, I can see that Trappist is in fact in the solar system. Is this right? And if this is right, why in the world did it take us so many years to find it? We have one Voyager that is almost out from the solar system. Couldn't it find it before? And is it possible to find more planets in our solar system? Is it because Voyager went only in the x-y direction, and not ""perpendicular"" to the orbits?</p>

<p>I'm sorry for asking these stupid questions, but I simply can't build new knowledge on my current low-level understanding of the solar system. This is my current knowledge:

"How could a hobbyist astronomer determine apparent magnitude of a star?","<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apparent_magnitude"" rel=""noreferrer"">Apparent magnitude</a> is a rather complex way to determine the brightness of a star. Quoting the introduction text from the linked to Wikipedia page:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The apparent magnitude (m) of a celestial body is a measure of its
  brightness as seen by an observer on Earth, adjusted to the value it
  would have in the absence of the atmosphere. The brighter the object
  appears, the lower the value of its magnitude. Generally the visible
  spectrum (vmag) is used as a basis for the apparent magnitude, but
  other regions of the spectrum, such as the near-infrared J-band, are
  also used. In the visible spectrum Sirius is the brightest star in the
  night sky, whereas in the near-infrared J-band, Betelgeuse is the
  brightest.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While it is of course a useful measure also for the slightly more casual, non-scientific observer to help determine the observed star from its neighboring cluster, or identification in general, I always wondered if there is a way to measure apparent magnitude with enthusiast-class equipment, and what would these procedures be?</p>

<p>I believe that MgI stands for neutral, atomic magnesium, and since this is optical (not X-rays) this would have to be free atoms, or perhaps molecular, but not bound magnesium in compounds or metals.</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> Why is there free magnesium in the ecliptic (if there is) and why would some be orbiting within the ecliptic plane but retrograde?</p>

<p>The abstract in full:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This thesis documents the building of a pressure-scanned Fabry-Perot Spectrometer,
   equipped with a photomultiplier and pulse-counting electronics, and its deployment at the Observatorio del Teide at Izaña in Tenerife, at an altitude of 7,700 feet (2567 m), for the purpose of recording high-resolution spectra of the Zodiacal Light. The aim was to achieve the first systematic mapping of the MgI absorption line in the Night Sky, as a function of position in heliocentric coordinates, covering especially the plane of the ecliptic, for a wide variety of elongations from the Sun. More than 250 scans of both morning and evening Zodiacal Light were obtained, in two observing periods – September-October 1971, and April 1972. The scans, as expected, showed profiles modified by components variously Doppler-shifted with respect to the unshifted shape seen in daylight. Unexpectedly, MgI emission was also discovered. These observations covered for the first time a span of elongations from 25º East, through 180º (the Gegenschein), to 27º West, and recorded average shifts of up to six tenths of an angstrom, corresponding to a maximum radial velocity relative to the Earth of about 40 km/s. The set of spectra obtained is in this thesis compared with predictions made from a number of different models of a dust cloud, assuming various distributions of dust
   density as a function of position and particle size, and differing assumptions about their speed and direction. The observations fit predominantly prograde models fairly well, but show a morning-evening asymmetry, different in the two observing periods. Models are investigated containing various components, including prograde and retrograde orbiting dust around the Sun, a drift of interstellar material though the Solar System, and light from distant emitting matter. The implications for possible asymmetries of the Zodiacal Cloud are discussed. Other researches on the Zodiacal Dust Cloud, before, during, and after my observations, are reviewed, including recent insights into its structure, orientation, and evolution, up to the present day, and my observations are evaluated in this context. Period of study, 1970-2007.</p>

"What resolution is needed to see a quasar through the galactic center?","<p>The center of the galaxy is densely packed with stars and obscured by a whole lot of dust between us and it. For those reasons, groups that study the motion of stars around the super-massive black-hole in the center of the Milky way need to use big telescopes at near infrared wavelengths. Questions of dust obscuration aside, what resolution would a telescope need to have to pick out a background quasar looking through the center of the Milky Way?</p>

<p>SDSS QSOs start at around 8th magnitude (Vega) in 2MASS photometry ($H$ and $K_s$ bands), and rise like a power law as flux goes down Here's a quick and dirty plot of SDSS QSO survey made from SDSS data release 10 made using <A HREF=""http://www.star.bris.ac.uk/%7Embt/topcat/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">topcat</A>. I would convert the graph to counts per solid angle, but I'm too lazy to look up the survey area of the SDSS spectroscopic survey right now.

<p>There's a quick and dirty example of the effect I'm describing in Figure 2 of the <A HREF=""https://arxiv.org/abs/0808.2870"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Ghez et al. (2008)</A> paper Rob Jeffries linked to below. The difference between the red points and blue points is both exposure time (more photons) and higher <A HREF=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strehl_ratio"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Strehl ratios</A> (a measure of how close to diffraction limited the image is and, hence, a proxy for resolution given the same optical system).</p>

<p>Generically, you could say that the question is: how do we determine the confusion limit in images with point sources? This is just specifically applied to the field of view on the sky with the highest density of resolvable point sources available. Concretely, say we wanted to resolve $22^{\mathrm{nd}}$ magnitude sources in views of the galactic center, what resolution is required to do so?</p>

<p>Getting to the full answer to the more concrete question ""how deep would we have to look to see a background quasar"" would require additional information: size of field of view, and dust extinction along the sight line. So, for simplicity, I'm assuming that if you're resolving $22^{\mathrm{nd}}$ magnitude sources in $K$ band, you're probably seeing a quasar. Thus we only need the projected density on the sky of sources brighter than that cutoff, roughly, and some description of how resolved sources need to be from the background brightness to detect them to answer the question.</p>

"Is it unlikely for a meteor to hit the day side of the earth?","<p>I have binge watched a lot of documentaries and movies about meteors hitting the earth.

"Why don't astronomers use meters to measure astronomical distances?","<p>In astronomy distances are generally expressed in non-metric units like: light-years, astronomical units (AU), parsecs, etc. Why don't they use meters (or multiples thereof) to measure distances, as these are the SI unit for distance? Since the meter is already used in particle physics to measure the size of atoms, why couldn't it be used in astrophysics to measure the large distances in the Universe? </p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>The ISS orbits about 400 km above Earth.</li>
<li>The diameter of the Sun is 1.39 Gm (gigameters).</li>
<li>The distance to the Andromeda Galaxy is 23 Zm (zettameters).</li>
<li>At its furthest point, Pluto is 5.83 Tm (terameters) from the Sun.</li>
</ul>

<p>Edit: some have answered that meters are too small and therefore not intuitive for measuring large distances, however there are plenty of situations where this is not a problem, for example:</p>

<ul>
<li>Bytes are used for measuring gigantic amounts of data, for example terabytes (1e+12) or petabytes (1e+15)</li>
<li>The energy released by large explosions is usually expressed in megatons, which is based on grams (1e+12)</li>
<li>The SI unit Hertz is often expressed in gigahertz (1e+9) or terahertz (1e+12) for measuring network frequencies or processor clock speeds.</li>

"Can eternal inflation and gravity explain dark energy?","<p>First of all, I have absolutely no background in astronomy and physics. I just watch a lot of ""i-hope-scientific"" youtube channels talking about physics and astrophysics and I can kind of follow the maths and concepts.</p>

<p>So, I was thinking, with absolutely no physics to support this:</p>

<p><strong>REAL QUESTION STARTS HERE:</strong></p>

<p>Say, the big bang happened everywhere, followed by inflation that never stopped. This is wat eternal inflation described (if i am correct)</p>

<p>Then, as eternal inflation goes on and more and more universe outside of the observable universe is created. Then there would be an unlimited amount of mass outside our observable universe. </p>

<p>Can this mass create an gravitational effect on the galaxies in our universe?</p>

<p>We are at the center of our observable universe, so the gravitational effect of all the mass outside our observable universe would never affects us. But from the perspective of another galaxy, it would be affected by a bit of universe that is outside our observable universe. </p>

<p>Then you might explain the effect that galaxies that are farther away from us move faster away from us. And that galaxies closer to use move slower away. Then you can explain this by saying that the galaxies farther away are closer to the ""unlimited"" mass outside our observable universe. And thus are more affected by this. And that galaxies close by are less affected.</p>

<p>The theory with dark energy claims that dark energy causes an outward push from the inside of our universe. Wouldn't this be indistinguishable from a gravitational pull from the outside?</p>

<p>Also, could this explain the red-shift we see in light from the far end of the observable universe? If I remember correct, gravity can red-shift light if the light moves away from the source of the gravitational pull (as seen near black holes). Light form the far end of the universe has moved trough the gravitational pull away from the ""infinite mass"" of the outside universe.</p>

<p>This was my idea, and I would like to see where I am thinking wrong.</p>

<p>One thing where I obviously might be thinking wrong is that this effect would be homogeneous throughout the universe and it should cancel out. But is this also true when you throw some relativity into the mix?</p>

"Affordable night sky photography","<p>As an amateur with limited budget, I'd be interested in taking photos of the night sky, trying to capture more detail than human eye armed with a lens of comparable parameters to what I have in my camera normally could see. I doubt I'd ever get down to details as fine as Jupiter's moons, but I'd hope to see detail of some nebulae I have a hard time seeing through my inexpensive telescope, stars too dim to notice in less-than-perfect conditions etc. I'm interested in taking full-sky images just as well as zooms on specific objects too.</p>

<p>Currently, I have a lower-end SLC camera, with two lenses - good sharpness though lower aperture with 50-120mm focal length, and a wide-angle, high-brightness one (about 12-50mm) currently. Firmware hacks allow me to take photos of arbitrarily long time, and I have the remote to start and stop it without touching the camera, and generally software-wise the camera is quite powerful. One of the lenses (the longer focal length) is of ""standard professional"" quality level too.</p>

From the position vector I directly calculate declination and right ascension, using cartesian to spherical coordinates conversion.</p>

<p>Right ascension gets calculated correctly but I am having problems getting the same result for declination as the one displayed by satellite trackers.</p>

<p>Speaking of satellite trackers, I don't understand how is their declination value even correct.</p>

<p>Declination is an angle measured north or south of the celestial equator.

<p>Celestial equator of course is on the same plane as the equator of Earth.</p>

<p>Then how is it possible that, when a satellite (ISS in this example) is almost directly above Earth's equator, satellite trackers calculate declination to be around -29° ?</p>

Then there are many hypothesis on how it's evacuated, which are mostly pretty logical.</p>

"Looking for help in understanding how black holes can move","<p>I'm looking for help in understanding how black holes can move through space. This is probably a trivial question for anyone who knows astronomy, but probably due to my lack of education on the topic, I can't come up with an answer or visualization on my own.</p>

<p>Specifically, my confusion is as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I saw Dr. Kip Thorne in a documentary on black holes state that there is no longer any matter in a black hole once it forms. He said something like, the matter was there, but it has been crushed out of existence and basically has been transformed into the energy that produces such a great curvature of spacetime.</p></li>
<li><p>From that description, it seems to me that within the event horizon of a black hole it is simply this enormous ""dent"" in spacetime itself that is moving around. </p></li>
<li><p>I also saw Dr. Andrew Hamilton in another documentary state that within the event horizon of a black hole (again paraphrasing), space is falling toward the singularity so fast that it effectively drags everything with it (including light).</p></li>
<li><p>Based on 1 (no matter remains in the black hole) and 2 (space is being pulled towards the gravitational singularity from all directions), I try to picture the black hole moving, and it seems to me that if, say, the black hole moves in one direction, I can see how its event horizon is also moving, bringing that bit of space into it. But how can the other end of the black hole let space ""escape"" in order to complete the motion? </p></li>
</ol>

<p>I am pretty sure I am just missing something here, because as I have learned, black holes have been found in galaxies and solar systems and many other places where they have to be moving. But I want to understand why it is that space itself can cross the event horizon when other things can't. And along those lines, it seems amazing to me that a black hole could be in essence a kind of scar in spacetime that can also move through it.</p>

<p>Thanks for any help and sorry for the wordy question. </p>

<p>UPDATE: Thanks for the answers so far. I hope someday I'll be able to comprehend them fully. :-)</p>

<p>I would like to add some further context that better illustrates my question.</p>

<p>If you go to the video here and watch the first minute or so (up to around 31:00)</p>

<p><a href=""http://youtu.be/Niurc_6xIYg?t=29m48s"" rel=""nofollow"">http://youtu.be/Niurc_6xIYg?t=29m48s</a></p>

<p>you can see Andrew Hamilton explaining what I have a question about along with an animation to illustrate the description. </p>

<p>On the one hand, we have spacetime curved in such a way that the black hole structure remains intact - that is, there is a constant event horizon generated by that extreme curvature. But on the other hand, Dr. Hamilton describes a flow of spacetime between the event horizon and the inner horizon, and he says it is plausible that within that area, space itself (which has no substance, in his words) can be described as flowing in and being flung back out. </p>

<p>I don't understand how space can have these two opposing properties - (1) a curvature that is maintained in order for the black hole to exist, that is, a curvature generated because matter can interact with the space and (2) a flow of space that sounds like it is not subject to a restriction of crossing back out of the event horizon.</p>

<p>It's that apparent difference between (1) and (2) that I want to understand better.</p>

"total energy and apparent bolometric magnitude","<p>So I have been given this question:</p>

  <p>A typical Type Ia Supernova emits $10^{44}\ \mathrm{J}$. All nuclear weapons
  tested by humans have released a total of about $2\times10^{6}\ \mathrm{TJ}$ of energy. Assume the Supernova energy is released at the distance of the Sun. Determine how close to your retina the nuclear weapons energy would have to be released to make both appear to have the same apparent bolometric magnitude. </p>

<p>The issue I'm have is normally apparent magnitudes I would have to have joules per second where this is in just total joules.</p>

<p>So is it that with bolometric magnitude there is an automatic assumption that when total power is mention you assume joules a second?</p>

"How do they know how far out Farout is? (2018 VG18)","<p>The Carnegie Science article <a href=""https://carnegiescience.edu/news/discovered-most-distant-solar-system-object-ever-observed"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Discovered: The Most-Distant Solar System Object Ever Observed</a> begins:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Washington, DC— A team of astronomers has discovered the most-distant body ever observed in our Solar System.  It is the first known Solar System object that has been detected at a distance that is more than 100 times farther than Earth is from the Sun.</p>
  
  <p>The new object was announced on Monday, December 17, 2018, by the International Astronomical Union’s Minor Planet Center and has been given the provisional designation 2018 VG18. The discovery was made by Carnegie’s Scott S. Sheppard, the University of Hawaii’s David Tholen, and Northern Arizona University’s Chad Trujillo.</p>
  
  <p><strong>2018 VG18, nicknamed “Farout”</strong> by the discovery team for its extremely distant location, is at about 120 astronomical units (AU), where 1 AU is defined as the distance between the Earth and the Sun.  The second-most-distant observed Solar System object is Eris, at about 96 AU.  Pluto is currently at about 34 AU, making 2018 VG18 more than three-and-a-half times more distant than the Solar System’s most-famous dwarf planet.</p>
  
  <p>2018 VG18 was discovered as part of the team’s continuing search for extremely distant Solar System objects, including the suspected Planet X, which is sometimes also called Planet 9.  In October, the same group of researchers <a href=""https://carnegiescience.edu/news/new-extremely-distant-solar-system-object-found-during-hunt-planet-x"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">announced the discovery</a> of another distant Solar System object, called 2015 TG387 and nicknamed “The Goblin,” because it was first seen near Halloween.  The Goblin was discovered at about 80 AU and has an orbit that is consistent with it being influenced by an unseen Super-Earth-sized Planet X on the Solar System’s very distant fringes.</p>
  
  <p>The existence of a ninth major planet at the fringes of the Solar System was first proposed by this same research team in 2014 when they <a href=""https://carnegiescience.edu/news/solar-systems-edge-redefined"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">discovered 2012 VP113</a>, nicknamed Biden, which is currently near 84 AU. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That's great! But the next bit confuses me.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The discovery images of 2018 VG18 were taken at the Japanese Subaru 8-meter telescope located atop Mauna Kea in Hawaii on <strong>November 10, 2018</strong>.</p>
  
  <p>Once 2018 VG18 was found, it needed to be re-observed to confirm its very distant nature. (<strong>It takes multiple nights of observing to accurately determine an object’s distance.</strong>)  2018 VG18 was seen for the second time in <strong>early December</strong> at the Magellan telescope at Carnegie’s Las Campanas Observatory in Chile.  These recovery observations were performed by the team with the addition of graduate student Will Oldroyd of Northern Arizona University.  <strong>Over the next week, they monitored 2018 VG18 with the Magellan telescope to secure its path across the sky and obtain its basic physical properties such as brightness and color.</strong></p>
  
  <p><strong>The Magellan observations confirmed that 2018 VG18 is around 120 AU</strong>, making it the first Solar System object observed beyond 100 AU.  Its brightness suggests that it is about 500 km in diameter, likely making it spherical in shape and a dwarf planet. It has a pinkish hue, a color generally associated with ice-rich objects.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Question(s):</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>How was the value of 120 AU <em>actually determined?</em> </li>
<li>or at least, how <em>could it be determined</em> if the explanation isn't readily available?</li>
<li>Is this measurement <em>more of</em> an orbit reconstruction, or a parallax measurement of current distance?</li>

"Statistics of elements abundance in exoplanets","<p>Recently, I encountered the concept of carbon planets - planets, which would be, unlike the Earth, formed mostly by carbon, instead of oxygen, silicon and magnesium. (I am not counting iron, which is mostly locked in the core). Now, I am interested in the planetary chemical compositions in general. I found interesting articles investigating the topic of variance of the planetary chemical compositions (for example <a href=""http://www.researchgate.net/profile/D_Fischer/publication/230967637_The_Planet-Metallicity_Correlation/links/00b7d52be357729458000000.pdf"">here</a> or <a href=""http://arxiv.org/pdf/1405.3253.pdf"">here</a>), but it is quite hard for me to make an overall picture of the state in the field.</p>

<p>I would like to ask on these things:</p>

<p><em>1. What typical compositions of terrestrial planets are expected to occur?</em> (I guess there will be plenty of correlations, some groups of elements occuring together as they are bound, for example to the CNO cycle or other nuclear cycle.)</p>

<p><em>2. How much different the chemical compositions of terrestrial planets really are?</em> (I.e. are all terrestrial planets mostly similar to each other, or should one rather expect that every planetary system has unique ratios of elements?)</p>

<p>Here are some quotes from the pop article:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A rocky, ocean-bearing planet with more than 0.1 percent methane in its atmosphere should be considered a potentially inhabited planet, the researchers say. And if the atmospheric methane reaches levels of 1 percent or more? In that case, “potentially” doesn’t cut it—such a world would “likely” be home to alien life.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thus, methane and carbon dioxide together, unaccompanied by carbon monoxide, on a rocky, ocean-bearing world would best be interpreted as an airtight sign of anoxic life.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, some information about Titan from the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titan_(moon)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikipedia page about Titan</a>:</p>

<pre><code>Titan's atmosphere
    Stratosphere:
        98.4% nitrogen
        1.4% methane
        0.2% hydrogen
    Lower troposphere:
        95.0% nitrogen
        4.9% methane
        -OR, depending on who you ask-
        97% nitrogen
        2.7% methane
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>The density of Titan is consistent with a body that is about 60% rock and 40% water.</p>
  
  <p>There are trace amounts of other hydrocarbons, such as [...] carbon monoxide [...].</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If I understand correctly, 'trace amounts' of CO is in line with the requirements stated in the Catling paper.</p>

"How do observational astronomers manage streaks and other artifacts from objects in Earth Orbit?","<p>There are thousands of satellites and spent rocket parts in low earth orbit (LEO). Mostly near the lines of dawn and dusk they can be in sunlight while observatories below are still viewing the night sky, as are the observatories like Hubble (also in LEO).</p>

<p>They are moving roughly 7 km/sec and as seen from Earth that motion will be roughly a half-degree per second, depending on distance.</p>

<p>Considering the number of observatories imaging the sky at any moment and the number of objects in LEO, streaks across images must be happening quite regularly.</p>

<p>While that would strongly impact a one-hour exposure on emulsion, these days solid state imaging is used and these are probably regularly buffered to provide the dynamic range necessary to capture dim objects with very bright images in the same field. </p>

<p>While a fraction of a second streak by a satellite will not normally completely obliterate a long exposure, it is still a problem and it seems would have to be managed in an accepted and systematic way.</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> How do observational astronomers manage streaks and other artifacts from objects in LEO? Since these things are (usually) carefully tracked and their trajectories predictable, do observatories, or at least observers, ever plan ahead for these events, or schedule to avoid them? Or is it just handled automatically in post-processing?</p>

<p>I've heard the Earth's orbit is elliptical, but to keep things simple, let's just say the orbit is a perfect circle. Therefore the radius of this circle is 93,392,474 miles. This would mean the diameter of our orbit would be 186,784,948 miles:</p>

<pre><code>93,392,474 x 2 = 186,784,948 miles
</code></pre>

<p>The circumference of a circle is π x the diameter of a circle. Therefore, the number of miles in Earth's orbit would be about 586,504,736.72 miles:</p>

<pre><code>3.14 x 186,784,948 = 586,504,736.72 miles
</code></pre>

<p>So, the Earth travels about 586,504,736.72 miles in one year. Since there are 365 days in year, that would mean that Earth travels about 1,606,862 miles in one day.</p>

<pre><code>586,504,736.72 ÷ 365 = 1,606,862.292383562
</code></pre>

<p>That would mean the Earth travels about 66,953 miles per hour:</p>

<pre><code>1,606,862.292383562 ÷ 24 = 66952.595515982
</code></pre>

<p>And this would mean the Earth travels about 1,116 miles per minute:</p>

<pre><code>66952.595515982 ÷ 60 = 1115.876591933
</code></pre>

<p>Lastly, this would mean the Earth travel about 18.6 miles per second:</p>

<pre><code>1115.876591933 ÷ 60 = 18.597943199
</code></pre>

<p><a href=""http://neartalk.com/ss/2016-02-19_003_1041x870.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Google says</a> the diameter of the Earth is 7,917.5 miles. So, as fast as the Earth is traveling, a catastrophic meteor has about a 7 minute window to hit target Earth.</p>

<pre><code>7917.5 ÷ 18.597943199 = 425.719119329 seconds
425.719119329 ÷ 60 = 7.095318655 minutes

<p>What are the odds of a catastrophic meteor hitting the Earth? Or, maybe a better question: What are the odds of the Catastrophic Earth hitting a poor meteor!?</p>

"Is it possible that the Sun has a binary partner (the Nemesis Theory) that has eluded detection?","<p>I just recently learned about the theory that our Sun has a small companion star with a 26 million year orbit.

My question is not whether or not this is possible as that has been asked before; my question is how could we have missed it? </p>

<p>When we look for exoplanets in the Universe, we are sometimes able to detect a slight wobble in the parent stars. Along those lines, if the Sun had a companion star, how would we not notice the effects on its rotation/orbit? If the sun and this companion star were locked in a 26 million year orbit, would we be able to notice the orbit? </p>

<p>Finally, when you have a star system like ours, with so many planets, is it possible to tell which planet is causing which specific motion in the Sun? For example, let's say we traveled to a different star system a few hundred light years away, and we were studying our solar system. Would we be able to look at the way the Sun wobbles and determine how many planets were in orbit around our Sun, or would we only be able to say that there was one, or simply that there may be several?

I found equations on <a href=""http://aa.usno.navy.mil/faq/docs/GAST.php"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this website</a> to convert to LST.

<p>where $UT$ is the time in Universal Coordinated Time, $LST$ is the Local Sidereal Time, $L$ is the longitude, and $T$ is:</p>

<p>$$
T = \frac{JD-2451545.0}{36525.0}
$$
where JD is the Julian Date at noon UTC.  Once I've calculated the time in UT, I then add or subtract 24 until the result is within 0 - 24 hours.  Then I can convert from UT to local time.</p>

<p>I would prefer to have this as accurate as possible.  I did a calculation using this, but according to Stellarium I was off by about an hour.  Could this be due to Daylight Savings time or something?</p>

JD0 = 2457813.5
L = - 106.6056

The fact that they are visible in the upper atmosphere of HD 209458b confirms that atmospheric 'blow off' is occurring.</p>

<p><strong>example 2: CoRoT-7b</strong></p>

<p>According to the NASA article <a href=""http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/news/topstory/2010/earthlike-exoplanet.html"">""Most Earthlike Exoplanet Started out as Gas Giant""</a>, CoRoT-7b is an Earth-sized planet where a hot Jupiter usually is found, they describe it as</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>is almost 60 times closer to its star than Earth, so the star appears almost 360 times larger than the sun does in our sky,"" Jackson said. As a consequence, the planet's surface experiences extreme heating that may reach 3,600 degrees Fahrenheit on the daylight side. CoRoT-7b's size (70 percent larger than Earth) and mass (4.8 times Earth's) indicate that the world is probably made of rocky materials. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The high day time temperature means that the star-facing side of the planet is likely to be molten, any tenuous atmosphere is also blasted away.  Scientists estimate that many Earth-masses may have been boiled off.  It also seems that the decreasing mass is causing the planet to be drawn closer to the star  -cause more material to be boiled off, hence the mass to decrease.</p>

<p>To summarise on of the scientists in the article:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You could say that, one way or the other, this planet is disappearing before our eyes,""</p>

"Strength of core-envelope coupling in stars","<p>For a star with a given Zero-Age Main Sequence (ZAMS) mass, as a function of metallicity how strongly is the star's core coupled to its envelope?</p>

<p>I understand that the core-envelope boundary is only (semi-) well defined for Main Sequence stars that do have a core, and that in principle the final spin (angular velocity) of the core should depend on the spin of the star prior to losing its envelope in a mass transfer event. I've read, <a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2000MNRAS.315..543H"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a> for instance, that the core should be nearly completely uncoupled from the envelope, however in <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.07053"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this</a> recent paper they assume that the coupling is sufficient enough to determine the natal spin of the stellar core (see figure 1).</p>

"Will gravitational waves too far away ever reach us?","<p>Gravity is the curvature of spacetime, and its effects travel at lightspeed. However, space is expanding; eventually, light from distant galaxies will become more and more redshifted, and we will no longer be able to see them (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cosmological_horizons#Future_horizon"">source</a>).</p>

<p>As such, there is a limit to how far we could ever possibly see, since light too far will never reach us due to the rapid expansion of space...or at least, if I'm understanding this correctly.</p>

<p>Now, gravitational waves travel at lightspeed. So, after enough time, when an object's light no longer reaches us, will its gravity no longer affect us either?</p>

<p>A better rephrasing is: at a certain point in time, will the gravity of any extremely distant object — even the most massive stars, black holes, or <em>galaxies</em> — simply not affect us whatsoever, in the slightest?</p>

Objective Diameter: 50mm 
Focal Length: 36cm 
Tripod Height: 38cm 
Main tube Color: Silver 
Net Weight: 1.78kg 
Case Size: 43cm(L) x 10cm(W) x 26cm(H)</p>

<p>2)Optical Design: Refractor Mount Type: Altazimuth Ideal Usage: Astronomical and land observation Focal Length: 500 mm Aperture: 40 mm Focal Ratio: 13 Highest Useful Magnification: 94x Finderscope: 2 x 20 Lens Coating: Fully coated Light Gathering Power: 33x Limiting Stellar Magnitude: 10.5</p>

<p>3) 2x Barlow Lens and Enhanced Stability The Celestron Powerseeker 40AZ black comes with two extra eyepieces, one which is 20 mm and magnifies up to 25x and the other one is 8 mm which magnifies up to 63x. It also includes a 2x Barlow lens that almost doubles the magnifying capacity.</p>

<p>4)Meade NG60-SM Altazimuth Refractor Telescope Meade's value priced NG60-SM Altazimuth Refractor is an affordable entry level telescope that features an easy to use Altazimuth mount with slow motion controls for precise tracking. The complete package includes a sturdy metal tripod, a red dot viewfinder, two 1.25 inch eyepieces and a star diagonal, and a software DVD with instructional video. The NG60-SM Refractor Telescope comes disassembled in a compact box, but the instructional DVD video guides you through all the steps required for assembly. Go ahead and try it out in the daytime, that's the best time to align the red-dot finder scope while looking at a distant tree or telephone pole. The optics of Meade's NG60-SM produce an image that is right side up but the diagonal mirror reverses the image left-to-right. That's no problem most of the time, but an optional correct image diagonal is available. The low power 25mm eyepiece produces a magnification 28X which is just right for spotting the Moon or the planets, while the 9mm eyepiece (78X magnification) can be used to zoom in for more detail. The MH25 eyepiece at 28X shows a lovely view of the Lunar disk in a dark sky, while the MH9 eyepiece at 78X shows literally hundreds of craters on the Moon and begins to show the rings of Saturn and the cloud bands of Jupiter. For even better views it's easy to add better eyepieces. My best view of Saturn, for example, came with an optional 6.4mm Super Plossl eyepiece, about 110X magnification. The Altazimuth mount included with Meade's NG60-SM is lighter and easier to use than an Equatorial mount, yet the slow motion knobs make it easy to keep objects in view. The rotation of the Earth causes the Moon or planets to appear to drift out of the eyepiece, but the slow motion knobs make it easy to keep the telescope on target, even with a high power eyepiece. The telescope is sensitive to vibration, however, so a high power eyepiece can be difficult to focus.</p>

<p>So which 1 is best?????</p>

<p>I wanna see Saturn its rings,Jupiter and its moons,mars,venus, basically planets and their moons</p>

"Current limitations in radio-astronomical spectrometry analysis of local interstellar cloud's hyperfine structures","<p>I've been trying to wrap my head around capabilities of current radio-astronomical spectrometry technology to isolate not too distant tenuous sources, say, chemical composition and density of the the interstellar medium right in the neighborhood of our Solar system. In essence, what is our local interstellar cloud made out of and how much of it is there:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/LKxCg.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>We've had much success so far in isolating distant radio wave sources and analyzing their hyperfine, i.e. molecular level composition. Same goes even for interstellar medium composition down to molecular ions of diazenylium (N<sub>2</sub>H<sup>+</sup>) that is surrogate to the presence of unobservable, nonpolar N<sub>2</sub>.</p>

<p>For example, P. Caselli et al. from the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics <a href=""http://iopscience.iop.org/1538-4357/455/1/L77/pdf/1538-4357_455_1_L77.pdf"">presented a paper</a> (PDF) on J = 1 → 0 transition of N<sub>2</sub>H<sup>+</sup> at 93 GHz toward the quiescent low-mass cloud core L1512 in Taurus, back in 1995. That is 18 years ago!</p>

<p>What I don't understand is, what's preventing us, with current technology, from isolating local low-mass formations in the radio wave spectra from its background noise and analyzing its hyperfine structure through radio-astronomical spectrometry? Is the signal to noise ratio simply unworkable and the density of the local cloud too thin to filter it out from its background? Or have such observations actually already been done, and we already have molecular data on the local cloud that I'm not aware of?</p>

"Are there expanding-universe cosmological models that do not include inflation?","<p>I'm happy that the universe is expanding, because we have good scientific evidence in the form of galactic redshift. The Wikipedia <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble%27s_law"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Hubble's law</a> article gives what I think is a fair explanation of that. It redirects from cosmological redshift and maybe gives too much emphasis to Doppler shift, but no matter. Because like I said I'm happy that the universe is expanding. Even if there was no evidence, my understanding of general relativity would be telling me that the universe just <em>has</em> to expand. For the life of me, I still don't know why Einstein didn't predict it.   </p>

<p>But what I'm not happy about is inflation.

He says things like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""The whole point of inflation was to get rid of fine-tuning – to explain features of the original big bang model that must be fine-tuned to match observations. The fact that we had to introduce one fine-tuning to remove another was worrisome. This problem has never been resolved"". </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I empathize. I don't empathize with his cyclic universe, but I share his view that we have not explained any feature of the universe by introducing <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_(cosmology)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">inflation</a>. In fact, I would dispute the claims that inflation explains why the universe is isotropic, homogeneous, flat, and bereft of magnetic monopoles. I'd even say that I think inflation is a solution to a problem that doesn't exist. But as the Wikipedia article says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""The basic inflationary paradigm is accepted by most scientists, who believe a number of predictions have been confirmed by observation;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don't. I'm just some IT guy, but I'm like ""the substantial minority of scientists who dissent from this position"". Steinhardt is mentioned, as are John Earman and Jesus Mosterin.

"Why stars are not visible in photos of Planets from space","<p>The night sky from many parts of the Earth, away from any city lights and pollution, is full of starts, mostly the stars of the Milky Way Galaxy is what fills the night sky densely.</p>

<p>In many photos of outer space capturing the planets of the solar system there is always the black background, not even one single star to be found (I searched for photos of Saturn, Jupiter and even Earth, didn't find any peck of light around it which may be a star)</p>

<p>My question is, why this happens? I've told myself regularly that there can be three reasons for that</p>

<ol>
<li>The exposure of the camera is too low to capture the stars that might luckily be in the background of a planet's photo.</li>
<li>The stars are too spread out each other that in most of the photos there might not even be a star in the dark space behind the planet. </li>
<li>The telescopes taking the photos aren't powerful enough to take the photos of the stars clearly (very much related to the 1st point, but instead of the exposure of the camera I believe it is the telescope that's not capable or maybe made for that)</li>
</ol>

<p>All the other objects in our solar system that we've observed (aside from gas giants) are either speckled or virtually covered with craters, but I've never heard mention of actually seeing one of these impacts happen. At a basic level I'm curious if we've ever actually directly seen one, but what would be even better is if there's a publicly-available video of it happening.</p>

"Why do ""they"" portray colliding black holes like that?","<p>When I see an animation of two colliding black holes anywhere, it looks like two merging beads of water. But why would the event horizon form a bridge during collision? There is no material flowing in-between. Wouldn't the event horizons ""push"" each-other away as they merge?(the effect not the black hole itself) For what I understand the gravity would poorly, but surely, be canceled out. Wouldn't this ""push"" only disappear from view as they got significantly closer, where it still exists but is trapped in a much larger one?</p>

<p>Just to make sure, as I see the similar questions: I don't mean what happens as they collide, but rather why isn't this portrayed if it does this effect at all?</p>

"Can life survive on the equator of cooled and fast rotating white dwarf or neutron star?","<p>As I know, some stars produces carbon, nitrogen and oxygen when they are old and become white dwarfs or neutron stars. And even their surface gravity is strong, it may rotate very fast so that the surface gravity is diminished, hence materials such as rocks and water can present at the surface normally.</p>

<p>My question is, is it possible for life (eg:bacteria) to survive on the equator of white dwarf or neutron star if it is cooled and rotate very fast? Or is it even possible for the equator of white dwarfs or neutron stars become the origin of life?</p>

"Obtain tangent point (origin) of the Standard Coordinates system","<p>In a previous question (<a href=""https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/questions/14168/transform-pixel-coordinates-in-fits-file-to-equatorial"">Transform pixel coordinates (in FITS file) to equatorial</a>), <a href=""https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/users/2531/rob-jeffries"">Rob</a> supplied a <a href=""http://gtn.sonoma.edu/data_reduction/astrometry.php"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">great source</a> that describes the process of obtaining celestial coordinates for objects in an observed field.</p>

<p>The source mentions the <em>tangent point</em> in its description of the Standard Coordinates system:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>These are the projection of the RA and DEC of an object onto the tangent plane of the sky, i.e., the plane tangent to the sphere of the sky that intersects the sky at the tangent point (which is <strong>usually somewhat offset from the image center</strong>). The X coordinate is aligned with RA and the Y coordinate is aligned with DEC. The <strong>origin of the standard system is at the tangent point in the image</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would've assumed that the tangent point (ie: the origin of the standard coordinates system) would be located at the center of the observed field. Apparently this is not correct, hence the questions:</p>

<ol>
<li><del>Why is the tangent point usually offset from the image center?</del> (See Edit below)</li>
<li>How is the tangent point $(\alpha_0, \delta_0)$ obtained?</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>

<p>I've found the answer to the first question in <a href=""https://www.amazon.ca/The-Handbook-Astronomical-Image-Processing/dp/0943396824/191-9927439-8084045"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The Handbook of Astronomical Image Processing, Berry, R. &amp; Burnell, J. (Willmann-Bell, Second Edition 2005)</a>.</p>

<p>In Chapter 9 of this book, Astrometry is discussed. Standard coordinates are introduced in page 253 and the effects that disturb the tangent point $(\alpha_0, \delta_0)$ are discussed in page 254:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In real life, however, $(\alpha_0, \delta_0)$ is inevitably somewhat off the center of the image, and the x and y axes of the detector will be rotated through some angle. (...) In addition to displacement and rotation, the detector might be slightly tilted relative to the incoming light; the manufacturer's figures for the pixel dimensions might be slightly inaccurate at the CCD's operating temperature; and in the case of scanned photographs, the axes may not be perfectly orthogonal and equally scaled.</p>

<p>However, in page 258 (after explaining how to obtain X,Y from known positions of reference stars in the frame) the authors convert the X,Y coordinates to equatorial coordinates <strong>assuming that $(\alpha_0, \delta_0)$ are ""now known""</strong>.</p>

"How could a neutron star collapse into a black hole?","<p>White dwarfs usually do not collapse, as they have electron degeneracy pressure due to the Pauli exclusion principle. However, if one accretes mass beyond the Chandrasekhar limit, it is energetically favorable for the electrons to combine with protons and form neutrons. This gives us a neutron star.</p>

<p>However, neutron stars usually do not collapse into black holes due to neutron degeneracy pressure. How is it possible that beyond the LOV limit, the Pauli exclusion principle no longer prevents the collapse? Shouldn't it still prevent neutrons, which are fermions, from being compressed together any further?</p>

"Thought experiment about our location in the Universe","<p><sup>[I am sorry if this isn't the best place for this - it was either here or maybe on the <a href=""https://worldbuilding.stackexchange.com"">Worldbuilding SE</a>.]</sup></p>

<p>I recently re-read one of my favourite childhood sci-fi books (Chocky by John Wyndham), and in it a young boy is asked by an alien being, where in the Universe our planet is.</p>

<p>It occurred to me that this is almost impossible to describe.</p>

<p>Nowadays, with Wikipedia and the Internet, we can get some of the way by stating that we're in a galaxy that is approximately 10 billion years old, light takes approximately 100000 years to cross it, and which is part of a local group, itself part of a cluster, and that part of a super-cluster.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the alien might then ask a follow-up clarification question such as <code>what is a year</code>?</p>

<p>So we go to basics - in base 60 (as opposed to binary or base 10), our basic unit of time is called a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">second</a>, and there are 60 seconds in a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/minute"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">minute</a>, 60 minutes in an <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hour"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">hour</a> and 24 hours in a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/day"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">day</a> - which is the time our planet takes to rotate once completely. Our planet orbits a local star (that we call the sun) and each complete orbit takes approximately one <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/year"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">year</a>, and light takes around 8 minutes to get from our local star to our planet.</p>

<p>Unfortunately our alien might then ask, <em>but how long is a second?</em> - so we then get into atomic clocks, caesium 133 and phases of radiation, followed by the next inevitable question: what is caesium. So we have to get down to the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodic_table"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Periodic Table of the Elements</a> and decribe an atom, atomic weight, and how to define caesium in a way that a far off advance civilization could relate to - not to mention perhaps a tangent about Prime Numbers.</p>

<p>So if our alien was lucky enough to be in contact with someone like Professor Brian Cox, or a physyicist with astronomical leanings, how would such a description and conversation go?</p>

"Is Optical VLBI theoretically feasible? If not why not?","<p>There are plenty of optical interferometers in use with baselines of up to maybe 1km. As far as I can find out, they all work by directly collecting the light at all the telescopes, using mirrors to bring them together and then actually interfering them and observing the fringes with photodetectors. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, radio astronomers do interferometry over distances of thousands of km, but they do it quite differently. Essentially, they record the baseband electromagnetic waveform at each telescope, with an accurate timestamp, transport them all to a central location and combine them computationally. </p>

<p>So my question is whether <em>in principle</em> you could use the radio astronomers methods with an optical (or near IR) signal. Obviously the engineering and computational challenges would be formidable -- you would need to record data at speeds close to 1 Pb/s, timestamp it with femtosecond accuracy and do a ludicrously huge computation to recover an image, but that's not my question here.</p>

<p>On the one hand, it seems like the answer should be ""yes"" -- electromagnetic waves are electromagnetic waves. On the other hand, why should the phase of a photon observed in one telescope have anything to do with the phase of one observed in another? If you are digitising the data at each telescope, you are ruling out interference  fringes on a quantum level, just as happens if you find a way to measure which slit a photon went through in the double-slit interferometer. This suggests that the answer should be ""no"".</p>

<p>If the answer is ""no"" then what wavelength does the cutoff happen at? We have radio-style VLBI at 1mm now and optical-style interferometry at 1 <span class=""math-container"">$\mu m$</span>, what is possible in between?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Not all planetary transits can be detected by Kepler, since the planetary > orbit may be out of the line of sight to Earth. However, the hot Jupiters > orbit so close to the primary that the chance of a transit is about 10%. > If superflares were caused by close planets the 279 flare stars 
  discovered should have about 28 transiting companions; none of them 
  actually showed evidence of transits, effectively excluding this 
  explanation.</p>

"Does the Milky Way's movement through space have spacetime implications?","<p>The way I usually see spacetime explained, it says that if you just sit still, you are moving at 0kph and so you are moving at maximum speed through time (ie. time for you is flowing at maximum speed).

So for simplicity's sake, let's say the galaxy is actually moving through space at 1,000km/s.  Does this in fact mean that if I sit still on Earth, time for me is actually flowing 1/300th slower than if I were sitting still with respect to the universe?

"Could a contracting Universe create the redshift effect observed by Hubble?","<p>What if we just can’t see far enough and the redshift actually shows the galaxies speeding up towards a gigantic black hole to where everything is converging, repeating a cycle that took place countless times “before” the big bang?</p>

<p>Complete text in this link: <a href=""http://www.therealebook.com/Astronomy/Redshift_ContractingUniverse.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.therealebook.com/Astronomy/Redshift_ContractingUniverse.html</a></p>

<p>Even in a contracting Universe, there is a region around the observer where all the galaxies are moving away; the galaxies that are moving towards the observer could be too far to be seen. If we can demonstrate this, we could challenge the conclusion that the Universe is expanding, based on the redshift effect observed in the “nearby” galaxies.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/FqWZ2.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/FqWZ2.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Let’s start with a simpler representation: 1 dimension only (1D). Assume that all the galaxies move along a single line. We could represent an expanding and a contracting Universe as per the images below:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/lTZgL.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/lTZgL.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>In Situation 1, we have the currently accepted model, where galaxies move away from each other, at increasing speed, which creates the redshift observed by Hubble.</p>

<p>In Situation 2, we assume that in the contracting Universe the galaxies have a speed that is inversely proportional to the distance from the center (as in a sink flow where the particles accelerate towards the drain), galaxies 1 and 3 will display a red shift effect, because they are moving away from each other, while galaxies 4, 5 and 6 will appear with blueshift effect. However, in order to see the blue shifted galaxies it is necessary to see beyond the center of the Universe, which would be not possible either because of the distance or because of the gigantic black hole in the center traps light from galaxies 4, 5 and 6 preventing it from reaching us at galaxy 2.</p>

<p>In fact, assuming that from galaxy 2 we cannot see beyond galaxy 1, it is impossible to distinguish between situation 1 and 2.
With this we have demonstrated that for a 1D Universe it is impossible to determine if it is expanding or contracting, simple because we cannot see far enough. What about a 2D space?</p>

<p>Consider two galaxies (1 and 2); consider that they form a angle beta, relative to the center of the universe (assuming that there is one); Consider that galaxy 1 is at the distance r from the center; consider that galaxy 2 is at a fraction of r (say xr) from the center.</p>

<p>We can calculate the distance between galaxy 1 and 2 as follows:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/4VjO2.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/4VjO2.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>From the equation above we can calculate alfa and from <a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/F241q.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/F241q.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a> we can calculate d.</p>

<p>We also suppose that the speed along the radius can be calculated with the equation v = c / r, where c is constant.</p>

<p>Therefore we can calculate the position of the two galaxies after a period of time t, and measure the distance d between them to verify if d increases (redshift) of decreases (blueshift).</p>

<p>We can see that no matter what the fraction x is, there is always a minimum value for the angle beta, such that any galaxy within this angle will be moving away from the reference galaxy. Now assume that the universe is so big that we cannot see galaxies beyond beta. In this way, all that we can see is redshifted galaxies!</p>

<p>This means that even for a contracting universe, depending on how far we can see, it is possible to detect only redshifted galaxies. Does not this disprove the theory of expanding universe based on redshift?</p>

"How can tidal heating lower Io's orbit?","<p><a href=""https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/a/25055/7982"">This answer</a> to the question <a href=""https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/q/25054/7982"">Is Io a magic energy machine?</a> suggests that the energy from the internal heating of Io due to <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_heating_of_Io"" rel=""noreferrer"">tidal ""squishing""</a> as it moves cyclically closer and farther from Jupiter in its elliptical orbit will come from the energy of Io's orbit. A lower energy orbit is necessarily smaller, and that actually means that the velocity will be larger. (When you want to raise a satellite's orbit to a higher altitude, you actually use thrust <em>in the direction</em> of motion to slow it down.)</p>

<p>Given that tidal forces are a little complicated (cf. <a href=""https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/q/420/7982"">Why is the Moon receding from the Earth due to tides? Is this typical for other moons?</a>), is it <em>a priori</em> certain that the heating will lower Io's orbit, causing it to <em>speed up?</em> (Consider that Earth's Moon's receding is due in part to Earth's liquid ocean, and Jupiter is a gas giant.) Is it just the <a href=""https://space.stackexchange.com/q/25329/12102"">perijove</a> that will decrease, or the semi-major axis? </p>

<p>How can a (seemingly, naively, on average) radial force cause a tangential acceleration? <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Io_(moon)#Orbit_and_rotation"" rel=""noreferrer"">Io</a> is <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_locking"" rel=""noreferrer"">tidally locked</a> to Jupiter so its rotation around its own axis is synchronous to its rotation around Jupiter.</p>

<p><strong>edit:</strong> fwiw if the gravitational interactions between Io and Jupiter's other moons causes the problem to be too complex to answer easily, I'm more interested in the basic dynamics of tidal heating and effects on the orbit of a single moon, rather than specifically Io's situation.</p>

"Determining effect of small variable force on planetary perihelion precession","<p>Is there an analytical technique for determining the effect of a small variable transverse acceleration upon the rate of aspides precession (strictly not a precession but rotation of the line of aspides) of a planet orbitting around the Sun in a 2D plane according to Newtonian gravity law?  </p>

<p>I have modelled such effects in a reiterative computer model and would like to verify those measurements.  </p>

<p>The transverse acceleration formula is </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>$$At = (K/c^2)*Vr*Vt * Ar.$$</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Where:-</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>c</em> is speed of light, </p>
  
  <p>K is a constant of magnitude between 0 and +/-3, such that $K/(c^2) &lt;&lt; 1$. </p>
  
  <p>Ar is the acceleration of the planet towards the Sun due to Newtonian gravitational influence of the Sun, ($Ar = GM/r^2$).</p>
  
  <p>Vr is radial component of planet velocity relative to the Sun (+ = motion away from the Sun)</p>
  
  <p>Vt is transverse  component of planet velocity relative to the Sun (+ = direction of planet forward motion along its orbital path). Vectorially Vt = V - Vr where V is the total instantaneous velocity vector of the planet relative to the Sun. </p>
  
  <p>Assume planet mass is small relative to the Sun</p>
  
  <p>No other bodies are in the system</p>
  
  <p>All motions and accelerations are confined to the two-dimensional plane of the orbit.</p>

<p>UPDATE</p>

<p>The reason why this is interesting to me is that a value of K = +3 in my computer model produces anomalous (Non-Newtonian) periapse rotation rate values very close within about 1% of those predicted by General Relativity and within a few percent of those observed by astronomers (Le Verrier, updated by Newcomb).</p>

<p>Formula (Einstein, 1915) for GR-derived periapse rotation (radians per orbit)
from <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apsidal_precession"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apsidal_precession</a>
$$
\boldsymbol{\omega}=24.\pi^3.a^2.T^{-2}.c^{-2}.(1-e^2)^{-1}
$$</p>

<p>UPDATE 4</p>

<p>I have accepted Walter's answer.  Not only did he answer the original question (Is there a technique...?) but also his analysis produces a formula which not only confirms the computer-simulated effects of the transverse acceleration formula (for K = 3) but which also (unexpectedly to me) is essentially equivalent to the Einstein 1915 formula.</p>

<p>from Walter's Summary (in Walter's answer below):-</p>

<p>: (from first order peturbation analysis) semi-major axis and eccentricity are unchanged, but the direction of periapse rotates in the plane of the orbit at rate $$ \omega=\Omega \frac{v_c^2}{c^2} \frac{K}{1-e^2}, $$ where $\Omega$ is the orbital frequency and $v_c=\Omega a$ with $a$ the semi-major axis. Note that (for $K=3$) this agrees with the general relativity (GR) precession rate at order $v_c^2/c^2$ (given by Einstein 1915).</p>

Wasn't it pretty obvious to a careful astrologer a thousand years ago, that the Moon does not have a circular orbit and does not describe epi-cycles? It is the easiest celestial object to observe, visible both night and day. Moon calendars may have been designed tens of thousands of years ago, there's no lack of observational data. Kepler instead used a few oppositions of Mars which take place only once every two+ years. Since the Moon is the one object which does orbit Earth, in a geocentric world view it should've been the perfect test of circular and epi-cyclical theories about its orbit. Its nearness causes a daily parallax between moonrise and moonset, but that wouldn't be beyond a genius like Kepler or many mathematical astrologers before him.</p>

<p><strong>Is the following approach right to find the number density of hydrogen in universe?</strong></p>

<p>First we calculate density $\rho =\frac{3H^2}{8\pi G}$, then we have
$1+z = \sqrt{\frac{1+v/c}{1-v/c}}$. From that we get $v = H\times R$ and from this we calculate $R$, the radius of observable universe. With that, we calculate volume of universe $V = (4\pi/3)R^3$ and we get Mass $M=\rho V$. Then we calculate number of Hydrogen atoms with $N = M/m_{\mathrm{hydrogen}}$. Now we have number density of hydrogen $\rho = N/V$.</p>

"Time-frame regarding cosmic expansion and the bound state of the Virgo Cluster","<p>Due to accelerating cosmic inflation, other galaxies and galaxy clusters will eventually race toward the Hubble horizon apparently away from us, placing them effectively out of our sphere of influence. Due to Virgocentric flow, nearby galaxies, including our own, may become gravitationally bound to the Virgo Supercluster, resisting cosmic expansion (for at least some time).</p>

<p>My question is, <strong>Is there any hypothetical time-frame for when this event happens?</strong> That is, in what supposed number of billions or trillions of years will the Virgo Supercluster become the only region within the Hubble sphere with which we may interact with?</p>

<p>Edit: Is such an estimate currently impossible? I know I've read one in the past, I just don't remember it well. Somewhen in the ballpark of a trillion years. All I'm looking for is an educated guess.</p>

"Inflation cosmology: slow-roll inflation versus tunneling between two vacua","<p>In slow-roll inflation models, the early inflation of the universe is driven by the flat non-zero part of the inflaton potential, and it ends as the ball rolls down the cliff and the potential energy released leads then to the formation of matter.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ylJYx.gif"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>However, as I have heard such slow-roll models are no longer deemed realistic today in inflationary cosmology, instead other models where the end of the inflation is explained by quantum tunneling of the universe from a state with higher vacuum energy density to another state with lower vacuum energy density are considered for example.</p>

<p>Why (from a physical point of view) are slow-roll inflation models no longer considered to be realistic, what are their disadvantages?

"How do tadpole, horseshoe co-orbital states arise and how are they stable?","<p>A recent paper in Nature <em>""Planetary science: Reckless orbiting in the Solar System""</em> (Morais &amp; Namouni, 2017) presents the following series of four co-orbital states:</p>

<p><img src=""https://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v543/n7647/images_article/543635a-f1.jpg""></p>

<p>While I understand the development of the <em>quasi-satellite</em> and <em>trisectrix</em> states, I am unable to inuit the development of the <em>tadpole</em> and <em>horseshoe</em> co-orbital states.</p>

<p>From explanation provided in the article:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The tadpole and horseshoe shapes arise because the planet's
  gravitational attraction alters the body's orbital path — the body
  goes through a cycle of catching up with the planet and falling
  behind, seeming to change direction from the perspective of the
  planet.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How, when approaching the planet, does the body ""fall behind"" instead of continuing to accelerate toward the planet?</p>

<p>The only means that comes to mind is if the planet orbits faster than the body, but then I imagine it would</p>

<li>No longer be considered co-orbital (because it would have a different <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_period"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">orbital period</a>), and</li>

<p>From what I understand, the program had been running for four years before this happened, (1973–1995), and considering the amount of data that must have been generated and how bad humans are at doing boring repetitive tasks, it seems to me that the risk is very high that a similar event was overlooked.

"Can radioactive decay rates be confirmed by looking at supernova?","<p>Radiometric dating relies on accurate knowledge of the half-lives of radioactive elements. Skeptics have argued that since many elements' half-lives are too long for anyone to have observed them, we can't know what they were in the distant past.</p>

<p>There are various counterarguments based on terrestrial evidence, like agreement between elements in the same sample, and corroboration from varves, tree rings, and ice layers.</p>

<p>Another counterargument I've seen is by looking at supernova, we get a window ""back in time"" to when their light began its long journey to us, and that much of this light was generated by radioactive decay, confirming that decay rates were the same then as now.</p>

<p>I don't quite follow this explanation, and would like some help. Distant starlight doesn't give us a rock sample in which to analyze proportions of parent and daughter elements. Does it still somehow give evidence of specific radioactive decay rates? If so, how?</p>

"Calculation of Eccentricity of orbit from velocity and radius","<p>For a school project I am making a gravitational computer model. As I want to Milankovitch cycles, I need to calculate the eccentricity of an orbit after the model has completed its simulation.</p>

<p>I have thought about calculating the eccentricity using the aphelion and parohelion height, but these are not available as it is a simulation and as it therefore stores the data for one point on the ellipse.</p>

<p>The data I have after the model has completed:<br>
X,Y,Z coordinates of points that it has saved<br>
X,Y,Z velocities of points that it has saved  </p>

<p>I have been able to calculate the semi-major axis using the vis-viva equation. I have tried to get the value using the vis-viva equation but I got stuck as I think I need at least the Aphelion or Parohelion to calculate the eccentricity.</p>

<p><strong>My question: Does anyone know how  to calculate the eccentricity at any given point in the orbit using the velocity and coordinates (without simulating all points around it)?</strong> </p>

<p><strong>If not, does anyone maybe have a better idea/suggestion that I can try to gain the eccentricity values?</strong></p>

"How can you determine the initial volume of a planet's atmosphere?","<p>Since the surface pressure of a planet is determined by the mass of the column of gasses above it one would surmise that to determine the pressure you must know the volume and mass of the atmosphere.</p>

"Timescale of ignition of a protostar?","<p>What is the timescale of start of nuclear fusion as T Tauri type star transforms into a Main Sequence star?</p>

<p>Wikipedia article on <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_Tauri_type_stars"">T Tauri type stars</a> mentions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Their central temperatures are too low for hydrogen fusion. Instead, they are powered by gravitational energy released as the stars contract, while moving towards the main sequence, which they reach after about 100 million years.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The mentioned 100 million years is the period of the star being in its stable (well, as stable as the turbulent T Tauri type stars get) state without nuclear fusion. Then, once the fusion starts, we get <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File%3aRepresentative_lifetimes_of_stars_as_a_function_of_their_masses.jpg"">between 3 million and hundreds of billions years</a> of main sequence, depending on mass of the resulting star.</p>

<p>What I'm interested is how long is the period of transition between the two - ignition of the nuclear reaction - time between ""all energy produced by gravitational contraction"" and ""most of energy produced by nuclear fusion"".</p>

<p>I imagine this period could be quite short, and the effect quite rapid and turbulent as the initial fusion increases local temperature (and as result pressure) drastically, leading to conditions conductive for fusion spreading rapidly over the volume which is already on brink of entering the fusion everywhere within the protostar, essentially a nuclear wildfire encompassing the gathered gas, a chain reaction starting.</p>

<p>Am I right in my guess this process is rather rapid? Was it ever observed? Or contrary, does the intensity of the fusion reaction rise gradually and slowly from zero over many millions years of star formation? </p>

How hot? It can go from 10^5 to 10^7 K.</p>

"Need help on Springel model for galaxy simulation","<p>I am working on a code for galactic dynamics simulation. Initial conditions (positions and velocities) are based on a model with a massive dark halo and a thin exponential disk.</p>

<p>Now, from the following paper <a href=""https://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/9807320.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">""Tidal tails in CDM cosmologies""</a>, I am studying the response of the dark matter profile.</p>

<p>Here's a capture of the article part that confuses me :</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/8s2bY.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/8s2bY.png"" alt=""Response of dark matter profile""></a></p>

<p>Firstly, I don't understand how one gets equation (16) from the fact that angular momentum of individual dark matter orbits is
conserved, i.e :</p>

<p>\begin{equation}
r_{i}\,M(r_{i})=r_{f}\,M_{f}(r_{f})\quad\quad\text{(eq 16)}       
\end{equation}</p>

<p>"" where $r_{i}$ and $r_{f}$ are the initial and final radii of some dark matter mass shell, $M(r)$ gives the initial NFW mass
profile, and $M_{f}(r)$ is the final cumulative mass profile after the disk is formed.""</p>

<p><strong>Question 1) Is (equation 16) got by the momentum theorem ? ($\dfrac{\text{d}\vec{L}}{\text{d}t} = \vec{OM} \times \vec{F}$)</strong></p>

<p><strong>And how to prove it, i.e what's the demonstration to get (equation 16) ?</strong></p>

<p>I don't understand what's the difference between $M(r)$ and $M_{f}(r)$.</p>

<p>After, it is said that $M_{f}(r)$ is the sum of the cumulative mass of the disk and the dark mass inside the initial radius
and author writes (<strong>equation 17 on paper</strong>) :</p>

<p>\begin{equation}
M_{f}\,(r_{f})=M_{d}\,(r_{f})+(1 - m_{d})\,M(r_{i})\quad\quad\text{(eq 17)}
\end{equation}</p>

<p>I would like to connect this equation with the total mass of galaxy which could be written (according to me) as :</p>

<p>\begin{equation}
M_{total}\,(r) = M_{d}\,(r) + M_{DM}\,(r) = m_{d}\, M_{DM}\,(r) + M_{DM}\,(r) = (1+m_d)\, M_{DM}\,(r)
\end{equation}</p>

<p>with $m_{d}$ the ratio between disk mass and halo mass.</p>

<p><strong>Question 2) Could you help me to connect the total mass with this equation (17) ?</strong></p>

<p>After with equation (18), author of paper writes that the final profile $M_{h}(r)$ of the dark matter halo is then given by :</p>

<p>\begin{equation}
M_{h}\,(r) = M_{f}\,(r) - M_{d}\,(r)
\end{equation}</p>

<p><strong>Question 3) So should I conclude that $M_{f}\,(r)$ is the total mass of galaxy (disk + halo) as a function of $r$ ?</strong></p>

<p>Any help would be great,</p>

<p>Regards</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 1 :</strong></p>

<p>I have contacted the author of paper <a href=""https://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/9807320.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">""Tidal tails in CDM cosmologies""</a>, i.e Volker Springel and here are its comments :</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Question 1*) Answer: For simplicity, you can consider that all particles are on circular
  orbits. The initial circular velocity of a particle is $$v_i = \sqrt{(G M(r_i)/r_i)}$$, the final one is $$v_f = \sqrt{(G M(r_f)/r_f)}$$. The
  corresponding angular momenta are $$L_i = m r_i v_i$$ and $$L_f = m r_f v_f$$.
  Now, the angular momentum is an adiabatic invariant when the halo is
  slowly compressed, hence $$L_i = L_f$$. The latter equation then gives eqn
  (16) when one plugs in the velocities.</p>
  
  <p>Question 2*) ""I don't understand what's the difference between $M(r)$ and
  $M_f(r)$ ?"" </p>
  
  <p>Answer: </p>
  
  <p>$M_i(r)$ is the initial and $M_f(r)$ the final cumulative mass profile.</p>
  
  <p>Question 3*)</p>
  
  <p>I would like to connect this equation with the total mass of galaxy which could be written as :</p>
  
  <p>$$ M_{total}(r) = M_d(r) + M_DM(r) = m_d M_DM(r) + M_DM(r) = (1+m_d) M_DM(r)$$</p>
  
  <p>Answer : This can only be written for the initial distribution in
  this form, where the assumption is that the mass that will later make
  up the disk is distributed proportionally to the dark matter.</p>
  
  <p>Question 4*)
  Could you help me to connect the total mass with this equation (17) ?</p>
  
  <p>After with equation (18), you write that the final profile M_{h}(r)$ of the dark matter halo is then given by :</p>
  
  <p>$$M_h (r) = M_f(r) - M_d(r)$$.</p>
  
  <p>So should I conclude that M_f(r) is the total mass of galaxy (disk + halo) as a function of r ?
  &lt; Answer : ""Yes.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In conclusion, I can solve my question 1*) but not question 2*) nor question 3*)</p>

<p>Right now, my goal is to demonstrate how to get  :</p>

<p>$$\begin{equation}
M_{f}\,(r_{f})=M_{d}\,(r_{f})+(1 - m_{d})\,M(r_{i})\quad\quad\text{(eq 17)}
\end{equation}$$</p>

"Why don't Neutron Stars form event horizon?","<p>Trying to compare density of Black Holes and Neutron Stars I came up with the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A typical neutron star has a mass between about 1.4 and 3.2 solar masses<a href=""http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/question.php?number=219"">1</a>[3] (see Chandrasekhar Limit), with a corresponding radius of about 12 km. (...) Neutron stars have overall densities of 3.7×10^17 to 5.9×10^17 kg/m^3 <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_star"">[1]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You can use the Schwarzschild radius to calculate the ""density"" of the black hole - i.e., the mass divided by the volume enclosed within the Schwarzschild radius. This is roughly equal to (1.8x10^16 g/cm^3) x (Msun / M)^2 (...)</p>
  
  <p>The value of the Schwarzschild radius works out to be about (3x10^5 cm) x (M / Msun) <a href=""http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/question.php?number=219"">[2]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let's take a neutron star from the top of the spectrum (3.2 Msun) and same mass black hole.</p>

<p>Converting units: </p>

<ul>
<li>Neutron star: 5.9×10^17 kg/m^3 = 5.9 × 10^14 g/cm^3 </li>
<li>Black hole: 1.8x10^16 g/cm^3 x (1/5.9)^2 = 5.2 x10^14 g/cm^3 </li>
</ul>

<p>The radius of the black hole would be (3x10^5 cm) x ( 5.2 ) = 15.6km</p>

<p>The 3.2Msun Neutron Star of this density would have volume of 1.08 x 10^13 m^3 which gives radius of 13.7 kilometers</p>

<p>According to Shell Theorem, spherical objects' gravity field strength at given distance is the same for spheres as for point masses so at the same distance from center of same mass (point - black hole, sphere - neutron star) the gravity will be the same.</p>

<p>That would put the surface of the neutron star below the surface of event horizon of equivalent black hole. Yet I never heard about even horizon of neutron stars.</p>

"Two species of dark matter?","<p>At this point in time, evidence for the existence of dark matter has accumulated in many ways: </p>

<ul>
<li>it affects galactic rotation curves</li>
<li>plays a major role in cosmology, and the evolution of structure in the universe</li>
<li>is predicted in copious amounts by gravitational lensing on a wide range of scales</li>
<li>influences the dynamics of galaxy clusters</li>
</ul>

<p>to name a few.</p>

<p>There are many known candidates for dark matter particles: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weakly_interacting_massive_particles"">WIMPs</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axion"">axions</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisp"">WISPs</a>, neutrinos, etc (in fact, even bricks, though some other considerations would exclude them).</p>

<p><strong>The question then is</strong>: 
Why do we expect that only one type of dark matter particles is responsible for phenomenological dark matter? </p>

<p>For example, $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, the standard cosmological model, requires dark matter to be cold (slow, non-relativistic), which is used to constrain the possible properties of dark matter particles. However, this doesn't actually imply, that dark matter is cold for all the astrophysical systems. For example, galactic halos could be made of warm dark matter, and halos of dwarf galaxies could be made of cold dark matter.</p>

<p>One might of course say that one-species model is the simplest one. The counter-argument would be that in reality there well may be many species. This in turn might have profound implications for astrophysical models. </p>

"Where does energy at the beginning of a star's lifecycle (before any nuclear reactions) come from?","<p>David Christian's <a href=""http://www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520271449"" rel=""nofollow"">Maps of Time</a> has this to say about the period during which the first stars started to form from the diffuse clouds of hydrogen and helium that then made up the universe:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Under the pull of their own gravity, the clouds of hydrogen and helium began to collapse in on themselves...As gravity packed each cloud into ever smaller spaces, pressure built up in the center. Increasing pressure means increasing temperatures, and so, as they shrank, each gas cloud began to heat up (~Kindle location 1469).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The part I'm working on understanding is ""Increasing pressure means increasing temperatures."" Does the pressure itself cause the molecules to heat up? Or is it the kinetic energy that the particles pick up as gravity pulls them towards the center of the cloud? Or is the phenomenon here something other than increased energy per unit mass?</p>

<p>Of course, once the nuclear chain reaction gets started in the star it's not hard to figure out where the energy comes from. I'm talking about before that.</p>

<p>Of course this is personal video and not recorded for analysis, but the images - especially during the zoomed part - remind me of an annular eclipse, rather than a total eclipse. Below are some screenshots - the weak Fresnel reflections in the cabin window act a bit like attenuators (ND filters) and give less saturated, though distorted views. Basically they all look like donuts.</p>

<p>My first thinking was that if it was a total eclipse on the ground, it couldn't be annular at 35,000 feet closer to the moon. But thinking and looking again, the sun is near the horizon, and the plane at about 150 West longitude is not necessarily closer to the sun than observers on the ground were in Indonesia circa 120 East.</p>

<p>My question is - is that just corona, or is the plane farther away enough from the moon at this time and location to make the eclipse annular? </p>

<p>Light gets bent around high-gravity sources, such as a black-hole.

<p>Does gravitational lensing cause the amount of emissions (detected as coming from the (point/position/direction) of <strong>X</strong>) to far exceed anything else in that vicinity? </p>

<p>Does this then make the 'black-hole' by far the brightest, noisiest thing to be observed? (kind of like waving &amp; shouting in a quiet room)</p>

<p>[edit - based on astromax's answer]<br/>
I follow what is meant regarding super massive black-holes.<br/>
Consider the following scenario: A suitable massive sun on dying contracts into a (small) black-hole. This black-hole will now cause a lensing-effect, but since it is small the amount of emissions so 'lensed' around it is very small and maybe too small to detect? or, it is detected but erroneously ascribed to be a type of sun or other type of emission source?</p>

so heavier elements are created mostly in a supernova (but also possible in small quantities by special processes like neutron capture);
finally sun-like stars end up as white dwarfs, bigger stars as neutron stars, quark stars, black holes;
and black holes ultimately convert themselves into radiation, in the far distant future when the stable black hole mass limit goes up high enough that even the most massive black holes evaporate;</p>

"What discoveries have come from the DASCH project (Digital Access to a Sky Century @ Harvard)","<p>@astrosnapper's <a href=""https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/a/29034/7982"">answer</a> to the question <em>Could stellar occultations be used to survey Kuiper belt objects?</em> mentions the TAOS-II project and asteroid occultation measurements (which occur on the timescale of seconds) and that got me thinking about the term Time Domain Astronomy.</p>

<p>A quick search led me to an Astrobites post with a catchy title <a href=""https://astrobites.org/2012/11/12/a-big-step-backward-for-time-domain-astronomy/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">A Big Step Backward for Time Domain Astronomy</a> that (among other things) describes the DASCH project (Digital Access to a Sky Century @ Harvard).</p>

<p>The post is dated 2012 and says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The project is working to (1) digitally scan all of the plates, (2) detect sources on the plates, (3) assign physical coordinates to the plates, and (4) measure/calibrate the magnitudes of all sources.  The end product will be a publicly available database which can be queried to produce the 100 year light curve for individual objects.  As a part of the project the team had to develop a specialized scanner, as commercially available units would have been too slow to finish the project in anything resembling a reasonable amount of time. As it is, when operating at full efficiency, the project can now scan and analyze 400 plates a day.  As of the writing of this article, 38,346 plates have been scanned (~8% completion; see Figure 2 for a map of their current coverage) and over 2.7 billion magnitudes have already been measured.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The article ends with:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>...Given that we’re only 8% of the way through analyzing the plates, <strong>we can look forward to further interesting discoveries from this survey in the next few years.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is now six years later. Presumably the scan rate has accelerated a bit and a much larger fraction of the plates have been scanned, and techniques for reducing and analyzing the huge amounts of data have improved as well.</p>

<p>Since 2012, what new discoveries have been made from this effort? There may be too many to list, so a few highlights and a link to a summary might be the best way to answer.</p>

"Finding the lens diameter of a telescope by magnitude","<blockquote>
  <p>We have a telescope that can see stars with about +14 magnitude. how to find its lens (or mirror) diameter? (I mean the $D$ in formula $\theta = 1.22 \lambda / D $)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don't know whether I can assume that the temperature of star is equal to temperature of the sun or not. but if we think that they are equal we get this:</p>

<p>$m_{\mathrm{sun}} - m_{\mathrm{star}} = -2.5 \log_{10} (\frac{b_{\mathrm{sun}}}{b_{\mathrm{star}}}) = -2.5 \log (\frac{\sigma t^4 \times 4 \pi R_{\mathrm{sun}}^2 /(4 \pi r^2) }{\sigma t^4 \times 4\pi R_{\mathrm{star}}^2 / (4\pi r_{\mathrm{star}}^2)})$ if we solve this with what we know about magnitude of sun (-26.83 or something close to it between -25 to -27) and another things like radii we get:</p>

<p>($R/r = 3.16605 \times 10^{-11} \mathrm{rad} = \tan \theta/2 = \theta/2$ and from that and formula
$\theta = 1.22 \lambda / D $ and $\lambda = 550 nm$ we get something like D = $10596.8 \mathrm{m}$. which is very big for a telescope. what's the problem? how to solve this? Is this answer correct?</p>

"How Does Cosmology Constrain the Number of Neutrino Species?","<p>I've asked this <a href=""https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/81911/how-does-cosmology-constrain-the-number-of-neutrino-species"">question</a> already on the Physics SE, but I felt it would be worth posting here as well.</p>

<p>I know that based upon theories of structure formation cosmologists can constrain the <strong>sum</strong> of the masses of neutrinos - if neutrinos were too light or too heavy it would simply change the power spectrum of the universe. </p>

<p>My question is how exactly is the number of neutrino species constrained by cosmological measurements (i.e. - $N_{eff}$ as measured by WMAP or Planck)? The recent results from the Planck Satellite give us $3.3\pm0.3$, which is consistent with three neutrino species. How is this measured?</p>

Ideally would be interested in knowing how many stars are in the system but I'd be happy with just knowing if its (SBM) solo, binary or multi.  What I don't understand is which item in the line identifies its companionship (SBM), I believe it its 8-10 but the value for 32349 is 0 when its widely known that Sirius is a double star system so I think I'm wrong there.  I've deliberately excluded the names of the star.  I'm not expecting the answers to everyone, I just need the explanation of how to decipher one line and i'll do the rest because I can't understand what they mean.  Do the values under - d and -s refer to bitwise values of the value in 8-10?</p>

<p>I know 49669 has 4 stars in its system, 32349 has 2 and 79374 has an alleged 7.  The other descriptions of the other items in the list are about Parallax and Coordinates, nothing that appears related to the information what I'm after. </p>

<p>All the stars I looked up are all either binary or multiple stars, I couldn't find a solo star, apart from the Sun (debatable).  </p>

"How big do comets get?","<p>If my understanding is correct, Chury, the best explored comet so far is rather on the smallish side as comets go. Most comets observable with naked eye were so because they flew close to Earth, not because they were so big. I wonder, though, how big are the biggest ones. </p>

<p>Let's get it in two variants:</p>

<ul>
<li>How big is the biggest known comet? (mass, diameter)</li>
<li>Is there an estimate, or a theoretical limit on how big a comet can be? (for whatever reason, e.g. becoming a planet, breaking up due to tidal forces or whatever)</li>

"Photon Paradox?","<p>Imagine a photon reaching the Hubble Space Telescope today had originally been emitted from a star in the early universe 13 billion years ago. Einstein’s Special Relativity tells us, traveling at the speed of light, that from the photon’s frame of reference, no time will have passed for the photon between the moment it was emitted from the star and the instant it was recorded by the Hubble telescope. In addition, at the speed of light, the length contraction (or Lorentz contraction) is said to shrink the distance between these two objects (the ancient star and the Hubble telescope) to zero. But herein lies the apparent paradox in two parts: 1) In the early universe 13 billion years ago when the star first emitted the photon, there was no Hubble Telescope for the photon to instantaneously collide with from its frame of reference. In other words, how can the photon instantly collide with something which won't be invented for 13 billion years? 2) Given the complete length contraction of all points in space to zero at the speed of light, how can a single photon ever be absorbed at <em>any one</em> particular point when, if all distance between points in the universe is zero from the photon’s frame of reference, the photon will hit <em>each and every point</em> throughout the universe simultaneously, not just one? </p>

<p>The minimum units are seconds ( ″ ). I picture an angle of 1 second as being like a ""cone"" going out from Earth. It's really small at the beginning but as you go further its width increases.</p>

<p>How wide does this cone get as you get further into the universe? How big is an arcsecond on different astronomical bodies?</p>

"Musk's Roadster is now Russell's Teapot?","<p>Space Exploration Stack Exchange were not very fond of this question and closed it, so I think it might fit better here. </p>

<p><strong>Summary: Assuming no foreknowledge of its existence, can Elon Musk's Tesla Roadster be detected and categorised from Earth?</strong> </p>

<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell%27s_teapot"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Bertrand Russell</a> argued the following, an argument that is now known as <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell%27s_teapot"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Russell's Teapot</a> (emphasis mine): </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Many orthodox people speak as though it were the business of sceptics to disprove received dogmas rather than of dogmatists to prove them. This is, of course, a mistake. If I were to suggest that <strong>between the Earth and Mars there is a china teapot revolving about the sun in an elliptical orbit</strong>, nobody would be able to disprove my assertion provided I were careful to add that the teapot is too small to be revealed even by our most powerful telescopes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well now we have a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk%27s_Tesla_Roadster"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">midnight cherry red automobile</a>, between Earth and Mars, in an elliptical orbit around the Sun. </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/4b5r5.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/4b5r5.jpg"" alt=""""></a></p>

<p>Now assume that this civilisation we have falls. The knowledge of this automobile is lost. Then in some centuries/millennia later humanity has managed to work its way back to a level of technology comparable to what we have today. </p>

<p><strong>Could this automobile then be detected by ""our most powerful telescopes""?</strong></p>

<p>I guess that we could detect it as an orbiting object; it is large enough to be found. Can you confirm or refute this guess? </p>

<p>And if the automobile can be found as an orbiting object, <strong>could it then be determined that this is not an ordinary space rock, but that there is something very odd about it?</strong> That is to say: is it <strong>possible</strong> to do <strong>any</strong> kind of characterisation of the automobile that makes it stand out as an unusual space object. There is some uncertainty about the exact state of the automobile after such a long time, but there is no question that chemically and optically, this will be no space rock, even in several thousand years. The question is if we can detect that. </p>

<p>Digging some more I found about the (re)discovery of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J002E3"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">J002E3</a>, which turned out to (probably) be the Apollo 12 Saturn-IVB upper stage. I quote from <a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2003DPS....35.3602J"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this paper (emphasis mine)</a>: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Additional <strong>spectral observations</strong> were completed in May 2003 at the Air Force Maui Optical Supercomputing (AMOS) site. Through the modeling of common spacecraft materials, the observations of <strong>J002E3 show a strong correlation of absorption features to a combination of human-made materials including white paint, black paint, and aluminum</strong>. Absorption features in the near IR show a strong correlation with paint containing a titanium-oxide semiconductor. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, in short: <strong>could</strong> we do the same with this automobile and find that this is not a plain old space rock? How close would it have to be for this? </p>

<hr>

<p>This <a href=""https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/a/16305/7982"">excellent answer</a> from @MikeG shows exactly how to find a list of observations for a minor planet. But I'd like to ask about a list of observations of an artificial object.</p>

<p>Currently the NASA JPL's <a href=""https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/horizons.cgi"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Horizons</a> site is also providing predicted trajectory of an unusual spacecraft which is referred to as Roadster. It is the cherry-red Tesla Roadster attached to a roughly 3.6 x 8 meter white rocket body in heliocentric orbit, and it has been tracked by many different observatories because of its unique circumstances. (some GIFs in <a href=""https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/a/25002/7982"">this answer</a>) Roadster's 4.6 minute rotational period was also recently <a href=""https://twitter.com/jotajotahermes/status/962545252446932993"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">reported</a>.</p>

<p>Currently Horizons is reporting solution #7. They have been updating their solutions regularly as new observations are made and reported because as Roadster recedes from Earth it is rapidly dimming and will soon pass magnitude +20, so each new solution helps for the reacquisition of the object as it dims.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This trajectory is based on JPL solution #7, a fit to 269 ground-based optical astrometric measurements spanning 2018 Feb 8.2 to 13.4.</p>

<p>Would these observations still be catalogued in an astronomical database of observations? Since it's not a natural minor planet, it seems the <a href=""https://www.minorplanetcenter.net/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Minor Planet Center</a> would not be hosting this information, but it seems it should still be made available to astronomers for identification purposes.</p>

"How to calculate luminosity in g-band from absolute AB magnitude and luminosity distance?","<p>How can I calculate the (non-bolometric) luminosity $L$ of a galaxy (or a star for that matter) over a given band from its AB apparent magnitude $m_{AB}$ over that band and its luminosity distance $d_L$?</p>

<p>For instance, consider the g-band which typically has a $\lambda_{eff} = 467 \text{ nm}$ and a $\Delta \lambda = 100 \text{ nm}$. Given this galaxy has an apparent AB magnitude of $m_g = 22.5$ and luminosity distance of $1991 \text{ Mpc}$ (i.e. $z = 0.355$ if you are curious), what is its luminosity? I know I shold use the following equation, but I don't know what value to pick for $M_\odot$.</p>

<p>$$L/L_\odot = 10^{0.4(M_\odot - M)}$$</p>

<p>I tried 5.12 from <a href=""http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/~martini/usefuldata.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">a website</a> which is the value of $M_\odot$ in g-band but it gives me a different answer compared to when I calculate luminosity using flux:</p>

<p>$$L = 4 \pi d_{L}^2 f_\nu \Delta \nu$$</p>

<p>where $f_\nu$ is flux density and $\Delta \nu$ is the frequency width of the band (this is an approximation to the integration over frequency, assuming bands are step functions). So, how can I find luminosity using absolute magnitude?</p>

<p>which is similar to a simple linear model, except instead of <span class=""math-container"">$x_i$</span> being a known constant, it is instead a random integer. The prototypical example is von Mises's analysis of atomic weights in 1918, trying to assess the significance of the observation that they tended to be integer multiples of the mass of hydrogen. For more information on the subject see <a href=""https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/0471667196.ess2129.pub2"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">DG Kendall's overview</a>.</p>

<p>For example, perhaps the brightness of a spot has been measured, and the spot could represent any number of objects which are not distinguishable at the present resolution. This could be a problem of quantum inference... but only if if were for some reason known <em>a priori</em> that all objects had to have the same brightness.</p>

This being so, and Jupiter and Venus also being in the Ecliptic Plane, the observer can see Jupiter and Venus aligned ""vertically"" (same azimuth), separated by a couple of degrees in elevation. As the day progresses, that vertical alignment will evidently cease as the line connecting the planets rotates relative to the observer.</p>

"Central temperature of a stellar model with combination of gas and degeneracy","<p>If we have a stellar density model $\rho(r) = \rho_c(1-r/R)$, where the star is composed of ions behaving as perfect gas and electron with non-relativistic degeneracy. The central pressure is due to both gas and degeneracy pressure. My final goal is to find central temperature of this model.</p>

<p>Now for the linear density model, I calculated the central pressure only for gas to be $P_c = \frac{5GM^2}{4 \pi R^4}$. And central temperature for only gas is $T_c = \frac{5G \mu M_{H} M}{12KR}$</p>

<p>I know the Pressure for non-relativistic degeneracy $P_{nrd} = C \rho^{5/3}$. I was wondering to find central pressure for degeneracy, may I use the Lane-Emden equations for polytrops and simply find central pressure and temperature from there? Then add the two temperatures to find the maximum central temperature for a gas+degenerate star.</p>

<p>For Lane-Emden model, they also consider density dependence on radial distance, but they express the density function as $\rho = \rho_c \theta^n$. Is it equivalent to $\rho(r) = \rho_c(1-r/R)$ for gas model?</p>

And if not why does it only go one way?</p>

The backlog in the system stands at 5,000 light years (50,000 million million kilometers - the NASA space probe Voyager would do 90 million years to cover that distance.

"How does the size of a naked black hole effect its photon sphere?","<p>What effect does the size of a black hole have on the size or density of the photon sphere and it's proximity to the horizon? </p>

<p>For example: A person is in space looking at 2 black holes, one of them big and the other small. Could the bigger one appear smaller because of the way space bends around it? </p>

<p>If yes, can a large enough black hole be completely hidden behind the gravitational lensing? Could a dense photon sphere around a black hole look like a spherical distortion to distort the horizon or hide the black hole completely?</p>

"How strong is the gravitational stretch we experience from the edge of the universe?","<p>How much gravitational effect do we experience (e.g. maybe -.00001 G or smaller) from the edge of the visible universe?  By edge of the visible universe, I am talking about the region of the cosmic microwave background and beyond.  In the past, the universe was very hot and dense, and we are seeing the light from this time period as the Cosmic Microwave Background.  It took slightly less than the age of the universe for that light to reach us, and it has become extremely redshifted with the expansion of space.  Since gravity apparently travels at the speed of light, we should be experiencing a gravitational effect from this shell around us as well.  As I understand, the universe was extremely dense back then, and it is around us in every direction, which would intensify the gravity greatly.  However, it is extremely distant, which would weaken the gravity greatly.  I don't know if redshift would affect gravity as it has the light from the cosmic microwave background, but if so, this would weaken the effect greatly as well.  With all this in mind, I am curious, what would be the effect of gravity from the edge of the universe on us?</p>

<p>Often when distinguishing between collision-less vs collisional stellar systems, the virial theorem is invoked along with the equations for ""crossing time"" (also known as ""dynamical time"") and ""relaxation time."" A large galaxy is said to be collision-less because its relaxation time is many orders of magnitude higher than its age, whereas a dense stellar system (e.g., a globular cluster) is collisional because its relaxation time is less than its age. </p>

<p>But what is the relationship between this so-called ""relaxed"" state and virial, dynamical, and thermodynamic equilibrium? What do the three different kinds of equilibria intuitively mean? </p>

<p>For example, I have heard that large galaxies are assumed to be in virial equilibrium and then people derive ""dynamical masses"" (why not ""virial masses""?). What would it take and/or mean for a large elliptical galaxy to be not just in virial equilibrium, but also in dynamical or thermodynamic equilibrium?</p>

<p>In this case when the spacecraft uses for example the Earth's gravity to speed up, Earth will move towards the spacecraft.

"How would I measure that I'm at a pole?","<p>How would a person measure that he is at a planetary pole? My first inclination is to use a sextant to ensure that the Sun remains at a constant inclination. However, due to the orbit around the Sun and a possible planetary axial tilt, the Sun's inclination may vary over the course of the year and that could affect measurements if the length of the day is a significant portion of the length of the year.</p>

<p>A second inclination is to try to identify a pole star or at least the point about which distant stars rotate during the course of a planetary rotation. The observer could then (at least in theory) measure the inclination of this point assuming that planetary precession takes a long enough time (as on Earth). However, in the most likely chance that there is no bright star near the pole, I don't see how a sextant could measure reliably the inclination of a blank point.</p>

<p>Perhaps the first method could be used, but with other objects in the sky (stars) in place of the Sun. Thus, if a given star's inclination does not change as it (apparently) revolves around the horizon, we are at the pole.</p>

<p>Are there any better methods, assuming a completely self-contained system (i.e. no external satellites)?</p>

<p>VSOP87 exhibits the reason for my question: you can compute rectangular/spherical heliocentric positions either for the reference frame J2000 or the one of the given date. Clearly, if I want to observe some planets tonight, I'll compute the data for today's equinox. On the other hand, there is the possibility of a transformation between equinoxes of different dates.</p>

<p>My point... what if we measured Neptune's orbital period as a multiple of Mercury's orbital period?  It would make about as much sense.  Yes, let's have leap mercury orbits and leap milli-mercury orbits.  Outside of historical considerations and the tangible nature of the day I think this analogy is exact.

<p><strong>Edit Comment</strong>
How do you know what a year is without a calendar?  See, there you go again!  You measure a year in multiples of the smallest feasible, measurable unit.  In other words, you measure a year just like all the other durations in science.  Calendared time durations are the exception, not the rule... Uncoupling between two independent quantities is the rule, not the exception.  The intellectual exercise is how to make sense of falsely coupled time durations.</p>

Funnily, one could not only see the sunlit area of the Moon, but also the dark side<sup>*</sup> could be easily recognised throughout the whole evening from blue hour until dark night. I attached two photos of the Moon that should illustrate the effect. The pictures (sorry for the poor quality) needed to get a little overexposed to capture the illuminated dark side, but with plain eye the effect could be well seen.
We were speculating about the reasons why the non-sunlit area of the Moon could be seen.</p>

<ul>
<li>diffraction of sunlight through the atmosphere can be neglected as the Moon doesn't have an atmosphere. </li>
<li>reflection of light that in turn was reflected from earth (Sun -> Earth -> Moon -> observer) sounded a little unlikely to me</li>
<li>a psychological effect that kind of mentally completes the shape of the Moon, because we know it should be circular, sounded ok to me. But could be debunked as the dark side stays visible if one covers the bright side on the photo? </li>

"Is it possible to calculate the focal length of a refactor I built?","<p>I am trying to build a very low cost refractor telescope. It's for a project, so I need to be able to provide ""data"" about the telescope.

However, because I built it myself, I do not know what my focal length is. How can I find that out, or how can I calculate the magnification?</p>

"How was the time of equinox measured in ancient times?","<p>In the book ""The Crime of Claudius Ptolemy"" by Robert Newton, on page 81, it reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When we measure the time of a solstice, we measure the time when the
  meridian elevation angle of the sun has an extreme value, a maximum in
  the summer, and a minimum in the winter.... When we measure the time
  of an equinox, on the other hand, we measure the time when the
  meridian elevation takes on a specified value.</p>

<p>What does he mean by a ""specified value"". What specified value?</p>

<p>Also, how would the ancients have determined the time of the maximum, or the specified value? Time devices in ancient Greece, like water clocks, I suppose would have significant errors.

<li><p>Singularity at the center - The traditional view that there is a singularity at the center (e.g. all mass is concentrated in the center).</p></li>
<li><p>A structure where the black hole is filled throughout with matter inside the event horizon - My proposal, due to gravitational time dilation slowing / stopping time (e.g. a singularity will not form until an infinite amount of time has passed).  If the answer to my question on this subject here is correct, we should observe either possibility 2 or 3:  <a href=""https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/questions/2441/does-matter-accumulate-just-outside-the-event-horizon-of-a-black-hole"">Does matter accumulate just outside the event horizon of a black hole?</a></p></li>

"Time Dilation and Particle Decay","<p>I am teaching myself astronomy and I'm working on a basic problem regarding time dilation around black holes.</p>

<p>The question is basically this: if a neutron were ejected from a nucleus at a distance of 3km from a 1 solar mass black hole, how long would it appear to take for the neutron to decay (the assumption here is that the neutron would decay in 15 minutes... right on the half-life) to an outside observer?</p>

<p>My first thought was that we'd never see it decay, because 3km is the Schwarzschild radius of a BH of that mass, so the frequency would basically be <span class=""math-container"">$0$</span> and we'd never observe the decay event.</p>

<p>The text notes the time dilation </p>

<p><span class=""math-container"">$$
\frac{\Delta t'}{\Delta t_\text{obs}} = \frac{\nu_f}{\nu_i}$$</span>
where <span class=""math-container"">$\Delta t'$</span> is the the time difference between two events at the source and <span class=""math-container"">$\Delta t_{obs}$</span> at the observer.</p>

<p>We can use the relativistic red shift equation to get the wavelength difference (9.2 in my case using 1 solar mass and a radius of 3km) so that wouldn't be infinite, just big. For a 15 min <span class=""math-container"">$\Delta t'$</span> then, the <span class=""math-container"">$\Delta t_{obs}$</span> would be 15 min * 9.2, yeah?</p>

"Information speed and our view of the cosmos","<p>It is common knowledge that when we look at the stars we look back in time. And most stars are thousands of lightyears away from each other.

<p>Do astronomers take lightspeed into account when they map stars ? If so, how do they figure out the true position of a star.</p>

<p>With all that in mind do galaxies really look like what we see in our photographs? If a galaxy has a diameter of bilions of lightyears, what we see could be a really skewed and warped image of the real galaxy. Can we computationaly reverse the warping ?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>
Image 1 and 2 explain what I mean by ""Warping"". Stars closer to the core move faster and in combination with their distance from the viewer, information by light should give the impresion of a more ""spiraly"" galaxy as it whould take less time to reach the observer. Image 2 whould be the ""true"" shape of the galaxy if the effect could be reversed (I applied a counter clock-wise warp distortion)</p>

<p>An other factor of false position are gravitational lences. Although gravity from black holes do give the maximum distorsion, gravity from other stars could divert light reaching us. The diversion is negligent but can get big for astronomical distances (Image 3). Am I right ? If I am, do Astronomers even bother to make simulations to map the known sky as it whould be in real time ?</p>

"Why are distant objects observed in the near infrared?","<p>I was reading an article that explains why JWST is a successor to Hubble and not a replacement for Hubble. They explained that Hubble's science pushed astronomers to look at longer wavelength. And then they said:    </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In particular, more distant objects are more highly redshifted, and their light is pushed from the UV and optical into the near-infrared.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So basically to observe the first galaxies, astronomers have to observe in infrared. My question is why distant objects require observations in the infrared? </p>

<p>Is it because they are at a very large distance from us, so the light has lost a lot of energy on its way so it's detectable in the infrared? </p>

"How to trim CCD overscan and amplifier turn on/off regions","<p>I have begun reducing images I collected with a telescope and CCD detector. I read in the the ""Handbook of CCD Astronomy"" by Howell that I need to trim overscan regions (as well as possible amplifier turn on/off) regions before I can compute the gain of the detector. However, it is not thoroughly clear where this boundary is. </p>

<p>If we treat the CCD detector as a matrix of pixels, then I know that the overscan region is along the edge columns. To visualize this, I computed the average and standard deviation along each column of pixels to view the variation in intensity from column to column. Below I inserted the left side of two amplifier matrices on my CCD detector: </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/g5A4T.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/g5A4T.png"" alt=""Column-wise average and deviation""></a></p>

<p>The blue is the column-wise average and the green is the column-wise standard deviation. The y-axis is the (arbitrarily scaled) intensity and the x-axis is the pixel distance from the edge of the CCD array. </p>

<p>My question is essentially: <strong>how much of the blue and green curve should I cut-off?</strong></p>

<p>Edit: additionally, it should be noted that I am using the method outlined in ""CCD Data..."" by Massey &amp; Jacoby (1992) <a href=""http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?1992ASPC...23..240M&amp;data_type=PDF_HIGH&amp;whole_paper=YES&amp;type=PRINTER&amp;filetype=.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">link</a> to compute the gain. </p>

Or is it possible that the majority of them comes from one direction, and perhaps even has an influence on the earth's movement?</p>

<p>The further away a galaxy is from us, the faster it is moving away from us.  But the galaxies we see exist in the distant past because it takes a long time for their light to reach us. The closer galaxies are, the more recent their light is, and the slower they move away from us.

<blockquote>
  <p>Hubble observed that the distances to faraway galaxies were strongly correlated with their redshifts.

"How to calculate position of an unknown star knowing positions of some other stars from an image?","<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/kSVt6.png"" alt=""messier 44""></p>

<p>Suppose I know the coordinates (right ascension and declination) of the stars marked with red. How should I calculate the coordinates of an unknown star, marked with yellow?</p>

<p>Searching over the web, I found a technique called <em>least squares plate constants</em>. I guess <em>plate constants</em> dates back before CCD cameras. Unfortunately there was only little explanation. However, if I understood the matter correctly, I should assume the stars are on a surface of a sphere imaged to a plane? Please help :)</p>

<p>In all cases, the proportion of Earth's equivalent measurement is 0.273. If these figures are accurate, why aren't these numbers (0.273) different from each other at this scale? Obviously, if measured to enough decimal places, differences will appear.</p>

<p>The Moon has less gravity and rotates at a different speed from the Earth. Why don't these cause variability in the different radius measurements? Do they cancel out? It is a coincidence? Is there something about the Earth-Moon dynamics that means over millions of years these proportions gradually equalise?</p>

"Are there any ready-made machine-learning datasets of photometric data that are easy to use?","<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> I have a Machine Learning/Computer Vision background, <em>not</em> Astrophysics, so please be a bit patient with me. If you feel like this question is too far out there it would be great if you could direct me to meta or some bulletin board/mailing list that you think is a better fit. :)</p>

<p><strong>Important:</strong> I am talking about ""datasets"" in a machine learning / computer vision manner. I do <em>not</em> mean ""the entirety of SDSS data"" but rather a common set of inputs and (for supervised learning) associated outputs for a specific problem.</p>

<p>I have been looking for a while now to tinker with some problems in Astronomy/Astrophysics and I keep finding the same kind of advice when it comes to datasets:</p>

<p>Go to SDSS/GalaxyZoo, they provide downloads for their data.</p>

<p>Now, while that is true, none of these datasets are anywhere near as accessible as datasets in Computer Vision. ""Over here"" a dataset is mostly a bunch of (huge) tar files with jpeg images and some <code>.mat</code> or <code>.csv</code> for annotations. The process of getting started is pretty straigth-forward: unzip, load annotations into memory, start sciencing (or usually, applying wild heuristics). Obviously I simplify slightly, but you get the idea.</p>

<p>Now, to stay with the example of GalaxyZoo, the object coordinates, annotations and computed features are conveniently <a href=""https://data.galaxyzoo.org/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">presented</a> as a <code>csv</code>, <code>fits</code> or <code>voTable</code> file. But to get the actual visual data (if I understand this correctly) I have to, for each annotated galaxy...</p>

<ul>
<li>determine a bunch of <code>.fits</code> urls from the coordinates in the annotations (one per band and galaxy) and download them (~12MB/file)</li>
<li>download the containing ""tiles"" from the SDSS servers (in each of the bands I'd like to work with)</li>
<li>extract the patch containing the galaxies (with the aptly named sExtractor)</li>
<li>possibly apply some non-trivial corrections/transforms to the image patch</li>
</ul>

<p>I tried following along this procedure with a semi-randomly chosen paper from arXiv for which there is code available <a href=""https://github.com/EdwardJKim/dl4astro"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a> and without wanting to make any statement about said paper/code, this process is not comparable to the simple workflow I described above, and I would probably download some TB of data, were I to use the entire dataset, of which only a tiny fraction would actually be useful.</p>

<p>The resulting dataset only occupies a few GB of space, and has a very simple nature: <strong>ca 50000 images, with associated labels -1 or 1, for stars or galaxies</strong>. The data preparation pipeline, while one might also want to optimize it for this task, has next to nothing to do with the ""real"" work being done in the paper, and so having the reader go through those steps makes little sense to me.</p>

<p>So my questions are:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Did I understand the workflow correctly?</strong> Maybe I'm just following the wrong kind of paper, or I really just overlooked a big red ""Download Here!"" button? Otherwise:</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Did anyone go through these steps and make the resulting dataset available?</strong> Or are there good reasons not to do so? From the size of the sExtractor manual I gather that the choice of parameters in this processing step might significantly influence the outcome of any downstream method. So...</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Are there any sane/agreed-upon default settings for the preprocessing pipeline?</strong> While for any given method, applying extra ""magic"" in the preprocessing might make sense, having a default set of parameters would make dataset creation and a bunch of other things much easier, no?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I am sorry if this is a naive newcomer question. And for the long post. :P
As a meta, I would add tags ""dataset"" and ""programming"" or some such, but I lack the reputation.</p>

"Do falling bodies ever slow down?","<p>I've had some discussions recently about black holes, and the issue of infalling bodies taking forever to reach the event horizon. That's essentially what Einstein said in his 1939 paper <a href=""http://www.cscamm.umd.edu/tiglio/GR2012/Syllabus_files/EinsteinSchwarzschild.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">on a stationary system with spherical symmetry consisting of many gravitating masses</a>. He said <em>""it is easy to show that both light rays and material particles take an infinitely long time (measured in “coordinate time”) in order to reach the point r = μ/2 when originating from a point r > μ/2”.</em></p>

<p>Now, I'm a big fan of Einstein. But there seems to be two issues with this:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>One is that Einstein concluded that black holes cannot form, but we
have good evidence that there are black holes out there. The obvious
example is <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sagittarius_A*&amp;oldid=769794306#Observation_and_description"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Sagittarius A*</a>. That's where's there’s something
with a mass 4.28 million times the Sun, with a diameter of less than
44 million kilometres, and we can't see it. Surely it's just got to be a black hole.   </p></li>
<li><p>The other issue is that falling bodies don't slow down. Imagine you
drop a body at elevation A and it falls down to elevation B. The
""force"" of gravity relates to the first derivative of gravitational
potential. Hence the bigger the difference in gravitational time
dilation between elevations A and B, the faster the body falls past
B. Then if you drop a body at elevation B it falls down to elevation
C. Again the bigger the difference in gravitational time dilation
between elevations B and C, the faster the body falls past C. In a
typical gravitational field the force of gravity at B is greater than
at A. Hence as the body descends, the acceleration increases as well as the falling speed.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Imagine a gedanken spaceship from which we've suspended a cable. We have clocks at different elevations, so we can measure the gravitational time dilation at each elevation. We can also release test bodies at each elevation and record the  clock readings as they fall past other elevations:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/21xOq.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/21xOq.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a>  </p>

<p>At the end of the experiment we can reel in the cable and upload the recorded measurements to ascertain how our test bodies behaved. My understanding is that we will always find that time dilation always increases as we descend, that the falling body always accelerate downwards, and that both the acceleration and the falling speed always increases as the body descends. Is this correct? Or do falling bodies somehow stop accelerating? And do falling bodies ever slow down?   </p>

"Will biological process be disrupted under strong gravitational time dilation?","<p>This question is raised by someone I've discussed with, after watching the movie ""Interstellar"", in which a clip showing Cooper and Amelia landing on Miller's planet near a super-massive blackhole and they experienced quite amount of time dilation due to the gravitational effect. They spent like 20 minutes there and when they backed to the station they found out that 23 years have passed on station (where Romilly waited them for 23 years to return).</p>

<p>It's okay for this conception to be implemented here I believe most people will understand. We will just think that yeah 23 years has passed but they just feel normal, just like a 20-minutes park walking. BUT, no one has ever experienced such a strong time dilation, how could you be sure Cooper ""just feel normal""?</p>

<p>I remember reading a book which says if you are rushing directly to center of a blackhole, when you are very very close to the Schwartzchild radius, you may experience a whole lifespan of universe IN A SECOND, in other words, you are rushing to the real end of the world. I really doubt any life could 'feel' that second passing. Anyway, this is an extreme example.</p>

<p>So the question: will biological process behaves normal under certain gravitational condition? If it does, can we feel differently? Does our conscious get used to the normal time flow all life on earth are living with? more crudely, will we die due to the extreme time dilation caused by gravity (provided that gravity affect homogeneously upon us) and if so, how?</p>

<p>An interesting extra: If Romilly could observe Cooper from station and sees a near still 'slow-motion' picture of him, will Cooper conversely see a 'fast-motion Romilly' from the ground of Miller's planet?</p>

Recovering this light, emitted by the stars in these outer zones, was equivalent to recovering the light from a complete galaxy (“smeared out” over the whole field) and for some galaxies this missing light shows that they have diameters almost twice as big as previously measured.</p>

  <p><em>The spectral classes O through M, as well as other more specialized classes discussed later, are <strong>subdivided by Arabic numerals (0–9), where 0 denotes the hottest stars of a given class</strong>.

<p>So our Sun is a G2V yellow dwarf.</p>

<p>I'm a bit surprised that for amateur viewing on Earth that diffraction from a Newtonian or Cassegrain's secondary mirror and supports would really have any impact on resolution of small extended objects like Mars. The example in the article is a 16 inch telescope. I would have thought that <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_seeing"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">seeing</a> would be the limitation, but maybe for bright objects a smaller diameter (1/3 to 1/6 of the full aperture) is actually better? </p>

<p>Is it possible to explain the physics/optic behind the use of off-axis apertures to improve resolution as discussed in these links?</p>

<p>If possible, can a bit of math be used to demonstrate this quantitatively and convincingly?</p>

"How to find Greenwich Mean Sideral Time?","<p>I'm writing a program that converts position in the ECI (CIS, EPOCH JD2000.0) coordinate system to WGS 84 (CTS, ECEF) coordinates.

<p>My knowledge of astrophysics is very limited, so I find it hard to understand some terms. Especially, I can't seem to understand properly how the Greenwich Mean Sideral Time is computed, and why I always get different values. </p>

However, I can't really understand what the <strong>du</strong> truly stands for, or more specifically, why the document shows <code>du → ±0.5, 1.5, 2.5...</code>.

<p>In the app Star Walk for iOS it says that the ""n-Lyrids"" meteor shower peaks on May 9th. However, information I found online about this meteor shower says it already peaked back in April. (I did see a bright meteor a couple weeks ago.) </p>

<p>Hawking radiation is created when the vacuum state at the horizon looks as if it is transformed into a non-vacuum state for a distant observer, resulting in a negative energy 'input' to the black hole.

"Stars at near break-up rotation rates","<p>Accretion discs are ubiquitous in astrophisics. As a direct corollary, they are important for the following question.</p>

<p>Consider the following model, representing one of the most simple models for accretion discs. A central object is a star (pre-MS, WD or NS, but not a BH) of mass $M$, surrounded by a thin flat disc of material, which continuosly feeds the star at a rate $\dot{M}$, such that $M/\dot{M}$ is much larger than thermal and dynamical timescale of the star (i.e. accretion rate is slow).</p>

<p>Everywhere in the accretion disc its local motion is nearly circular and nearly Keplerian. Therefore, at the interface of the star and the disc the disc will always tend to make the star rotate at nearly-Keplerian velocities. From the other hand, if the stellar outer parts were to rotate at nearly-Keplerian velocities, these parts would become gravitationaly detached from the star, which would have significant consequences for the stellar shape and structure. Surely, though, the process is going to be slow and the acquired angular momentum will be redistributed within the star.</p>

<p>Now the question: <strong>What will be happening to the star if it approaches nearly break-up velocities due to such a spin-up?</strong> This involves a few subquestions: How close the rotation rate can actually get to the critical one? If it can get close enough, how would the whole process look like? That is, what would happen in the short term to the star when the effects of rotation will start to affect its structure? What would happen to the star in the long term?</p>

<p>I would like to keep this problem as a purely hydrodynamical one. That is, assume, that the only laws involved are hydrodynamical and gravitational ones, with some constant accretion rate supported. In reality magnetic fields would also play an important role for some stars, and stellar winds could also possibly be important.</p>

<p>Examples of the decribed systems are numerous. It might concern cataclysmic variables, millisecond pulsars, pre-main sequence star in a protoplanetary disc, and many more.</p>

on <a href=""http://www.the-colossus.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">SETI's Colossus telescope project</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Background</strong>:</p>

<p>He explains his theory that a civilization living somewhere the galaxy would want to hide, and thus would shortly learn to avoid broadcasting radio signals all over the galaxy, so as to avoid attracting attention (presumably to avoid inter-stellar predators).</p>

<p>Then he comes up with a great idea; due to the second law of thermodynamics, they would have to dissipate heat-energy, and thus, one can detect them <em>anyway</em>, because they have no way to hide this heat-energy. This, particularly when they are a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_II_civilization#Type_I"" rel=""nofollow"">Type I</a> civilization, and nearing <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_II_civilization#Type_II"" rel=""nofollow"">Type II</a>; in this case, to avoid global warming, they would capture and use almost all solar energy, and emit an equivalent amount heat-energy.</p>

<p>Thus he proposes a telescope to focus on single stars, which would be capable of detecting this heat-energy (by the distinctive infrared light emmited).</p>

<p><strong>My question</strong>:</p>

<p>If a civilization was smart enough to hide all of its radio signals, wouldn't they <em>know</em> that they cannot avoid emitting heat-energy? Thus their predators would be able to find them <em>anyway</em>, and thus, it is pointless to hide the radio signals?</p>

<p>Therefore, we should already be seeing their radio signals, and this telescope is being built for a theory with some holes.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: I am not suggesting that the telescope shouldn't be built; I think it could have other very valuable uses, and it would also be interesting to eliminate the theory if it is indeed incorrect (or prove it correct ... somehow). I am just asking if there might be justifications for the theory, in light of my point-in-question, which I am missing.</p>

"How well can we in principle determine $T_{\textrm{eff}}$ of a star?","<p>This is a question about the basics of astronomy, which I have never happened to see a good discussion for. It is about how well would we be able to measure effective temperature of a star, if we had any arbitrarily perfect measurement devices.</p>

<p>Here is some context. Canonical definition of $T_{\textrm{eff}}$ of a star is based on its bolometric luminosity $L$ (total electromagnetic energy radiated by the star per unit time) and its photospheric radius R (radius, at which the optical depth at a given wavelength is equal to unity). This way, the definition specifies  $T_{\textrm{eff}}$ through $L=4\pi \sigma R^2 T_{\textrm{eff}}^4$, where $\sigma$ is Stefan-Boltzmann constant. </p>

<p>The definition clearly alludes to black-body law. Many stars, including our own Sun, have a spectrum that does not follow it. For this reason, one often talks about another effective temperature, which is the temperature of stellar material at photospheric radius, and which can be determined by examining stellar spectrum. There are a few more complications to that, but let's put them aside.</p>

<p>Determining  $T_{\textrm{eff}}$ is extremely important in characterising stars, therefore there exists a variety of methods of measuring it, and naturally researchers strive for obtaining the best possible precision.</p>

<p>Hence, the question: <strong>How well can one in principle measure $T_{\textrm{eff}}$, if one could have arbitrarily perfect instruments?</strong> </p>

<p>Edit: <strong>I would like to see a quantitative estimate in your answer. Is the best possible precision for $T_{\textrm{eff}}$ of order $10\textrm{K}$, or is it $1\textrm{K}$, or some $10^{-4}\textrm{K}$, or can we measure it arbitrarily well?</strong></p>

<p>Here are just a few sources of uncertainty/arbitrariness: convection in stars, dependence of photospheric radius on wavelength, limb darkening, stellar variability, to name a few.</p>

<p>I would encourage the answers to be in the format ""Source of uncertainty"" - ""Simple derivation"" - ""Estimate of the effect"". If there are more than a few estimates, I will add a summary of them in the question or in a separate reply. Please, also feel free to edit the question if you might like to.</p>

"On analogies between gas and stellar systems","<p>Analogies between (typically) ideal gas and stellar systems are not only intuitively valid to some extent, but have been established and used in the studies of stellar clusters and galactic systems, most often as a simplification to collisionless Boltzmann equations.</p>

<p>The idea behind the analogy is that if a stellar system can be represented as a set of point masses, and if the number of point masses is large, then we can consider them from the point of view of kinetic theory of gases. One thing to remember here, though, is that stellar gas system is neither relaxed, nor can be relaxed.</p>

<p>I am curious here: <strong>How far can the described analogy be pushed?</strong></p>

"Mini black holes, a possible result of the LHC experiment at CERN","<p>A scientist at CERN LHC (Large Hadron Collider) was asked during an interview about the possible results and consequences of operating the LHC at full power of collision in the near future, one of the results he literally said :</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One of the theories that predicts the consequences of operating the LHC at full power collision is that mini black holes might form, but do not be afraid of those black holes, they will not start expanding and destroy the earth, they will instantaneously disappear.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I know that black holes create disturbance in space-time. And they actually appear when matter massively gets pressurized into a small size of volume in space which causes gravity to increase insanely which in turn initialize a black hole that even light its self can not escape away from.</p>

<p>So how can a mini black hole disappear anyway?
What in the world would cause a small size, a mini size, a tiny little black hole to vanish or disappear?</p>

"I saw a light moving fast what could it be?","<p>Today, at about 23:40 in Sungkyungwan University, South Korea, a friend and I spotted a bright light. </p>

<p>It was brighter than nearby stars. Since I was looking at South, and at that time, the brightest star in the Southern sky was Saturn, with an apparent magnitude of about 0.9, I'm safely assuming that its apparent magnitude was brighter than 0.9. The thing was even brighter than that (I think that it was as bright as a full moon).</p>

<p>Its initial altitude was about 60degrees then it fell below the horizon very quickly (in about 3~4 seconds). At first, I thought that it was a comet of some kind, but It wasn`t leaving any traces in the sky, and also it was moving in sort of a random way, going from left to right to left to right and so on. </p>

<p>It was a point, but it was so bright that it appeared larger than Vega(I'm not talking about absolute sizes, as stars don't have sizes. I'm just saying that, just as brighter stars seem larger, this moving thing was brighter and therefore, seemed larger.)</p>

<p>My friend and I saw it together, and wondered what it was. </p>

<p>Then, after about 10 minutes, it appeared again. But this time, it came from the place where it disappeared at its first sight. It moved up to about 10degrees (altitude). When it was going up, it was going up in a parabolic path. Then, it came down but along the way, its path changed from parabola to zig zag. Going from up to down took about 2 seconds. </p>

<p>What could this be? This cannot have been an optical illusion because both my friend and I witnessed it. Also, it could not have been a satellite as it was too bright(almost as bright as the moon) and moved in a non-linear path (also it moved very very fast). </p>

<p>What could this be? </p>

"Can protoplanetary disks form main-sequence stars?","<p>As has been pointed out by @Envite in the context of a more general discussion (see <a href=""https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/questions/987/generalised-planets"">Generalised planets?</a>), there seems to be a moderate possibility for protoplanetary discs forming main-sequence stars (MS stars).</p>

<p>Main argument here is that Jupiter has mass of about $10^{-3}M_\odot$, while in principle for an object to be a MS star, it would need the mass of at least about $0.07M_\odot$. Also, there is a handful of systems, such as <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HD_29587"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">HD 29587</a>, which contain a star and a brown dwarf, possibly forming from a protoplanetary disk.</p>

<p>Hence, a few questions. Can low-mass MS stars form in protoplanetary discs? If no, why? If yes, how often does it happen? If yes, which implications would it have for the subsequent dynamics of the planetary system, if one of the objects became a MS star, as opposed to it being a brown dwarf?</p>

"Can moon set after being up when due north? (pseudo circumpolarity)","<p>I'm in the northern hemisphere, facing north, and notice that the moon 
is due north (azimuth 0) and is still above the horizon, albeit barely. </p>

<p>Does this mean the moon is necessarily circumpolar (doesn't set), at 
least for the next few hours? </p>

<p>As the moon moves away from due north, it's altitude/elevation 
normally increases. However, it's possible that the moon's declination 
is decreasing so rapidly that the moon's elevation actually decreases, 
and the moon sets. </p>

<p>Is this possible? </p>

<p>This question is tangentially related to my question <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19862226/"">""libnova odd behavior for 89.5 degrees north latitude""</a> on Stack Overflow.</p>

<p>EDIT to answer questions: I am facing true north. I am referring to the Earth's true moon, but not necessarily in any given time frame. In other words, if something like this happens 10,000 years from now, that's fine.</p>

<p>EDIT: OK, I believe the moon CAN set even if it's up when due north. Example: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>You are at latitude 89.5N </p></li>
<li><p>The moon's declination when due north is +0.5N. This means the 
moon grazes the horizon when due north. </p></li>
<li><p>If the moon's declination were constant, it's highest elevation 
for the day would be 1 degree. </p></li>
<li><p>Since the moon's declination can change more than one degree per 
day (average of 1.5 degrees/day), it's quite possible for the moon's 
declination to go below -0.5N, at which point it would have set (it 
will actually set before this point unless it happens to reach due 
south). </p></li>
</ul>

<p>In theory, this could happen with any object whose declination 
changes, provide you're close enough to the North Pole. </p>

<p>I'll leave this update open for critiques. </p>

<p>EDIT: Actually, this whole question is just asking whether the midnight sun/moon can set at any position other than due north, which is fairly obviously true. Reasoning: once the moon/sun finally sets not due north, it was obviously still up the last time it was due north. </p>

"Does a White hole lies behind a Black hole?","<p>While reading about a White holes, I stumbled upon a question ""Where does the matter emitted by a White hole come from?"" There seems to be 2 possible candidates:  </p>

<li>It was the matter engulfed by a Black hole.  </li>
<li>Matter was created inside the White hole.  </li>
</ol>

<p>My search on wiki stated that:  </p>

<p>According to Penrose Diagram of Schwarzschild radius, objects first leave the White hole and then may enter into a Black hole. But, due to Hawking radiation, a Black hole can achieve thermal equilibrium with gas of radiation. This equilibrium state is reversal invariant, implying that time reversal of a Black hole is again a Black hole. This means that a Black hole and a White hole are same objects.</p>

<p>My 2nd candidate suggests that the big-bang was a white hole. I thought of ruling this out because it requires the existence of a white hole before the big-bang.  </p>

<p>This forced me to draw the conclusion that a white hole must either be inside a black hole or behind it. </p>

"How does one determine the effective temperature of a star from its spectrum?","<p>Determining effective temperature of a star is in general a non-trivial task. Simple reason for this is that we can only study the electromagnetic radiation from a star, but not the temperature directly. The complexity is due to the fact that the radiation is produced in stratified stellar atmospheres, which are only partially characterised by stellar temperature, but also by many other factors, such as stellar mass, elemental abundances, stellar rotation, etc. What is more, the temperature of atmospheres varies with depth, whereas effective temperature is just a number.</p>

<p>From the other hand, temperatures and magnitudes are the most important quantities, characterising stars.</p>

<p><strong>So, the question</strong>: How exactly does one use the spectrum to extract the information about the temperature of a star? By temperature here I mean effective temperature, or even the temperature profile of the atmosphere.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: This a rather textbook question.

<p>I've heard of a radiant of a meteor shower - it's an apparent position of the source of meteors referenced to the position of the Earth at the time of the shower. But I've= never heard the term applied to the <em>orbit</em> of a minor body unrelated to the Earth's position. What is the ""radiant"" of a minor body with a hyperbolic orbit in a simulation? Could it be the asymptotic incoming direction of the hyperbola?</p>

<p>But my main question is simply how ""statistically significant"" is this result in reference to the enhancement in the direction of Gemini? I can't see the data. Is it just a tiny fluctuation, or a fairly obvious and robust feature?</p>

<p>A screen shot of the data would be most welcomed!</p>

"How can absolute value of azimuth exceed distance from pole?","<p>I'm sure I'm just doing something dumb, but: </p>

degrees from the celestial north pole. </p></li>
<li><p>Per the snapshot below, Yildun's azimuth can be as high as 4.17

<li><p>Since the celestial north pole always has an azimuth of 0, 
wouldn't this put Yildun 4.17 degrees from the pole, contradicting

<p>EDIT: I thought I'd figured this out:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>On Earth, one degree of latitude is not the same as one degree of longitude (except at the equator). </p></li>
<li><p>Analogously, in the sky, one declination degree is not the same as one right ascension degree. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>I thought the situation for right ascension applied to azimuth, but it doesn't.</p>

<p>Both azimuth and declination are measured on ""great circles"" (declination is measured on a half circle, but same general idea), so degrees in azimuth should equal degrees in declination.</p>

"Does the Earth ever cross the Moon's path with respect to the CMB?","<p>Title says it, really.

"Motivation for using $\sigma_{8}$?","<p>Press-Schechter formalism allows one to universally quantify the number of massive dark matter halos in a given volume -- <strong>The Halo Mass Function</strong>.

<p>The halo count can be scaled via observations in a defined window region of <span class=""math-container"">$R = 8\ h^{-1}\rm Mpc$</span>. We can solve for this analytical/numerically and measure it from CMB fluctuations, given by the parameter <span class=""math-container"">$\sigma_{8}$</span>. The power spectrum, as well as the halo mass function, is then scaled through the normalization of the analytical variance and the observed variance.</p>

<p>My question is then, <em>why do we choose a smoothing radius of</em> <span class=""math-container"">$R = 8\ h^{-1}\rm Mpc$</span>? Is it arbitrarily chosen to compute the number variance in a cluster, or is their more too that? What prevents me from defining the window radius of <span class=""math-container"">$R = 6\ h^{-1}\rm Mpc$</span> (just ignore the fact that the  WMAP and PLANCK results give <span class=""math-container"">$\sigma_{8}$</span> in the radius of <span class=""math-container"">$8$</span>)?</p>

"Is sundial time entirely dependent on solar azimuth?","<p>I've visited several ""how sundials work"" sites and can't seem to get a 
clear answer to this: is ""sundial time"" just a linear function of 
solar azimuth? More specifically: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>When the sun is due south (northern hemisphere), it is sundial 
noon. All sites I've visited agree on this. </p></li>
<li><p>When the sun is due west (azimuth 270 degrees), I say the sundial 
time is 6pm, a quarter turn/day from noon. However, I can't find a 
site that actually says this, and some sites seem to disagree with 
this. Same for it being 6am sundial time when the sun is due east. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>I know there are different types of sundials, but had always assumed 
they would give the same sundial time. Is that not true? </p>

<p>As a note, the sundial I describe above can be fairly inaccurate at 
times, which makes me question whether I'm correct.</p>

<p>EDIT (to clarify question): Forgetting entirely about clock time for a 
moment, suppose I build a sundial. When the sun is due west, my 
sundial reads 6pm. When the sun is due east, my sundial reads 
6am. When the sun is due south, my sundial reads noon. My question: 
have I built my sundial correctly? The type of answer I'm hoping to 
get: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>No. When you build a sundial, it should read (something else) when 
the sun is due west. </p></li>
<li><p>There are many different types of sundials. Depending on type, 
your sundial may or may not read 6pm when the sun is due west. </p></li>
<li><p>It depends on your latitude: sundials are 
latitude-specific. There's no such thing as a global sundial. </p></li>
<li><p>Yes, your understanding of a sundial is correct. Sundials can be 
off by as much as (some number/formula) from mean solar time, 
depending on your latitude. They can be as much as (some 
number/formula) from clock time, depending on your longitude and

"How can Earth-Sun Lagrange points L1 & L2 even be semi stable considering the moon?","<p>I know that the Earth-Sun Lagrange L1, L2, and L3 points are not considered stable over longer periods, especially when compared to L4 and L5... But, with the moon orbiting the Earth in the general path of the ecliptic, it would seem that the first time the moon got in between the Earth and the object at the L1 or L2 points, it would be enough to perturb the object a good bit, and the next lunar month would be even worse, and so on.</p>

<p>It seems that if the moon was taken out of the equation, the L1 and L2 points would be much more stable. And, as a result of this line of thinking, I would think that the L3 point would be much more stable than L1 and L2, since the moon would be so much farther away and unimportant, so its effect could be ignored.</p>

<p>Am I wrong in thinking this? Is the moon's influence not large enough to be a major factor? And, just to clarify, I am talking specifically about L1 and L2 with respect to a large 3rd body, like the moon, instead of some idealized 2 body only system.</p>

"White Dwarf/Degenerate Gas Behaviour","<p>just want to try to clarify a few things about the nature of White Dwarfs and degenerate gases.</p>

<p>So if a white dwarf is help up by an electron degenerate gas, the electrons are unable to lose energy by emitting photons, correct? They basically are trapped at whatever energy level they occupy and that's that. The nuclei that make up the majority of the mass of the star are still constituents of a ""normal"" gas however, correct? This means that these nuclei and emit photons to lose kinetic energy? How does that work exactly? I understand that electron can emit photos inside an atom to drop to lower energy levels and that they can emit photons of any energy level if they are free (particularly if they're in a magnetic field, synchroton radiation, yeah?). To protons and neutrons do something similar? I ask because I never read anything about protons/nuclei emitting photons. If this basic picture is correct, is this the mechanism by which a white dwarf cools down over time?</p>

<p>Final bit, since most white dwarfs are quite hot, the peak wavelength is going to be in the UV. If I wanted to determine the percentage of such a star's luminosity that is given off in the optical, do I just need to integrate Planck's blackbody equation over the range of wavelengths I'm interested in and then compare that to the total luminosity given by <span class=""math-container"">$L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4$</span>?</p>

"Shouldn't we not be able to see some black holes?","<p>Whenever there is a picture of a black hole, (even though they are artist depictions, this is how they are described) most are shown kind of in a flat disk like this. <a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/gD6DQ.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/gD6DQ.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>My question is, why do we see the black hole itself? If it is sucking in material from all directions, then shouldn't the material be kind of covering the black hole, not just spinning around it to be sucked in from only the sides. Especially in the case that a star would be sucked in, then wouldn't all of its light &amp; matter in the accretion disk be encasing the black hole? 
In other words, why is the accretion disk flat, and not a sphere surrounding the black hole? So if this were true, we shouldn't be able to see some black holes, only their accretion disks around them. </p>

<p>(<strong>unrevised/old post:</strong> If a black hole is spherical and has infinite density, then it would be sucking in objects from all directions because the gravity would be the same all around. In other words, the event horizon should be all around it! </p>

<p>I understand everything would orbit the black hole a little before 'falling in', but since the amount of matter and light is so large, shouldn't it encase the black hole, thus making it covered in a ball of light? The event horizon would be a shell so we could not see some black holes, which would mean there could be billions more out there. </p>

<p>As for the other black holes which we have seen/proven, if the information above is true, then maybe they are the result of black holes with poles with low force/gravity/magnetivity/energy. Possibly they could be a disk of some sort or have an unequal distribution of density, either of which could lead to the flat event horizon, maybe even both. </p>

<p>Poles on a black hole would also help account for the quasars shooting out of some. Since the gravitational pull would not be as great from the poles of a black hole, then this would allow the quasars to beam out (otherwise they would have to be going faster than the escape velocity, which is the speed of light). </p>

<p>Maybe the quasars are even the black holes that I was talking about earlier, and this is why you would see no event horizon, only a shell of bright light. </p>

  standard. The distinction between UTC and UT is that UTC is based on
  an atomic clock and UT is based on astronomical observations, which
  for all practical purposes is an invisibly fine hair to split. Because
  <strong>the earth's rotation is not uniform (it slows down and speeds up in
  complicated ways)</strong>, UT does not always flow uniformly. Leap seconds are
  introduced as needed into UTC so as to keep UTC within 0.9 seconds of
  UT1, which is a version of UT with certain corrections applied. There
  are other time and date systems as well; for example, the time scale
  used by the satellite-based global positioning system (GPS) is

"Without using absolute magnitudes or isochrones, how might we tell a star's age and evolutionary status?","<p>Usual methods of estimating stellar ages involve <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_isochrone"">isochrone</a> approximations. It can also help to estimate a star's radius by correlating its absolute magnitude with effective temperature and apparent magnitude. In the absence of these measurements or observations of tell-tale variability, how might you guess a star's age and evolutionary status?</p>

<p>Given a single, high-resolution $(R\gtrsim 50000)$ spectrum as your only data point, how easy is it to accurately infer the age and evolutionary status of a star? For example, how would the spectrum differ between a red dwarf and red giant, both with of $T_{\mathrm{eff}} = 4000~\mathrm{K}$? Or between two red dwarfs of ages $2~\mathrm{Gyr}$ and $8~\mathrm{Gyr}$?</p>

"How was Io not torn apart by tidal forces during its formation?","<p>Jupiter's moon Io is arguably one of the most volcanically active bodies in the Solar System.  The reason, according to NASA's page <a href=""http://www.nasa.gov/topics/solarsystem/features/io-volcanoes-displaced.html"">Scientists to Io: Your Volcanoes Are in the Wrong Place</a> is believed to be caused by Io being</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>caught in a tug-of-war between Jupiter's massive gravity and the smaller but precisely timed pulls from two neighboring moons that orbit further from Jupiter – Europa and Ganymede. Io orbits faster than these other moons, completing two orbits every time Europa finishes one, and four orbits for each one Ganymede makes. This regular timing means that Io feels the strongest gravitational pull from its neighboring moons in the same orbital location, which distorts Io's orbit into an oval shape. This in turn causes Io to flex as it moves around Jupiter. </p>

<p>If you were in the ISS and orbiting the Earth roughly every 90 minutes, would it be possible for debris to be orbiting such that it passes you every 90 minutes?</p>

<p>While Neil DeGrass Tyson pointed out scientific <a href=""http://gawker.com/neil-degrasse-tyson-thinks-gravity-is-scientifically-i-1441842497"">flaws</a> in the movie on <a href=""https://twitter.com/neiltyson"">twitter</a>, he <a href=""http://www.theverge.com/2013/10/10/4823078/neil-degrasse-tyson-gravity-movie-high-quality"">praised</a> many things the movie got right in interviews, including ""The 90-minute orbital time for objects at that altitude.""  I think I recall an interview on a podcast that I can't remember where he specifically said that referring to the debris recurring every 90 minutes.</p>

<p>In reality wouldn't the debris <em>have</em> to be in a different orbit?  If the ISS orbits every 90 minutes (92.87 really but I'm saying 90) then after 90 minutes they would be in the same relative position.  The Earth would have rotated in the mean time so they wouldn't be over the same point on Earth, but they would be in the same position in orbit about the Earth.  Is there an orbit that would allow the same debris to cross the same spot in their orbit every 90 minutes?  Would it be nearly the same orbit, just inclined slightly?  Would that explain why the debris was moving so slowly relative to the ISS as well?</p>

<p>There are problems with the orbits and location in the movie, I simplified my question to ask about the particular orbit of the ISS.</p>

<p>What went wrong?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong>
As it turned out nothing was wrong, I can get to the second part: calculating the geographical point. (the title suggests it after all)</p>

<p>AFAIK for <strong>latitude</strong>, I can use <em>declination</em> as is and for <strong>longitude</strong>, I 
need to calculate <em>Greenwich Hour Angle(GHA)</em></p>

<p>After examining several articles, I found these equations:</p>

<pre><code>SHA[°] = 360 – 15 · RA[h] 
GHAAries[°] = 15 · GST[h] 
GHA = SHA + GHAAries 
</code></pre>

<p>For my case, I suppose I may use RA as is, without multiplying its hour component by 15. What keeps me a bit puzzled is GST:</p>

<ol>
<li>May I use Greenwich Mean Sidereal Time instead if I don't need the calculations to be super precise?</li>

Also, do we assume some error due to the light taking a non-linear path because of lensing? If so, is it possible to have an error of several hundred million years?</p>

"Detection of exo-planets","<p>One method used for detecting exo-planets is to look for a slight dip in the parent star's luminosity as the planet transits the stellar disc. Intuitively, it seems to me that if planetary systems in our galactic neighborhood are randomly oriented, there would have to be a very large proportion of them in which transits can never happen from Earth's viewpoint. Perhaps, however, the assumption of random orientation is incorrect, and there is some alignment of the axes of rotation of planetary systems, which would facilitate detection of planets in some preferred plane (the galactic plane?).</p>

<p>In popular presentations concerning the search for exo-planets, I have never seen this issue addressed. What observations and/or assumptions are used in arriving at a realistic estimate of the number of exo-planets in our region of the galaxy?</p>

<p>(There are related questions in this forum, but I haven't found one that asks about the possible alignment of the axes of rotation.)</p>

"Why did the distribution of asteroids discovered in 2010 have a radial modulation?","<p>This <a href=""https://space.stackexchange.com/a/26423/12102"">answer</a> links to one of Scott Manley's excellent asteroid videos <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKKg4lZ_o-Y"" rel=""noreferrer"">Asteroid Discovery - 1970-2015 - 8K resolution</a>. The animation highlights the positions of the meteors at the moment of their discovery, and by watching one can see the technology improve and notice patterns as instruments are pointed in different directions to avoid the light from the Sun and (at least sometimes) the Moon. (there is music, adjust volume accordingly)</p>

<p>There are often fan-shaped patterns showing the directions that more sensitive telescopes with modest fields of view are pointed.</p>

<p>However, I noticed that only during the year 2010, roughly between asteroid numbers <code>500,000</code> and <code>520,000</code> there are radial striations at certain distances from the Sun. I don't see this happen at any other time during the video.</p>

<p>Is this just a rendering artifact, or is it real? If real, what would cause the periodic radial modulation of sensitivity, and only in 2010?</p>

"Is albedo ever greater than unity? How is it calculated for various surface diffusivities and specular reflection?","<p>I'm trying to understand how albedo would be <em>calculated</em> for a body with well-characterized surface reflectance properties, so that it's absolute magnitude could be defined. One could argue that this is going backwards (one should measure apparent magnitude, correct for distances and phase angle to extract absolute magnitude, correct for radius to extract albedo) but consider if the body were not smooth and diffusely reflecting.</p>

<p>Imagine two identically sized spherical bodies; one diffuse or matte white and the other somehow covered in liquid mercury and exhibiting specular rather than diffuse reflectivity, with no wind or waves.</p>

"How can ionized emission line flux decrease as a function of increasing metallicity or abundance?","<p>The chemical evolution of galaxies is an important way to learn about their formation and stellar/gaseous constituents. Many galaxies show narrow emission lines at optical wavelengths (3500-9000 Angstroms) from ionized elements (e.g., [O II] at 3727 Angstroms) and recombination Balmer lines (e.g., H$\alpha$ at 6563 Angstroms). The origin of the ionized emission line flux can depend on the amount of the element present in the galaxy, and also on the nature of the ionizing source (i.e., the oft-mentioned ""shape of the ionizing spectrum"").</p>

<p>I have a few questions that I cannot seem to find clear answers to in textbooks, publications and review papers. My main reference for the following facts/questions is Kewley &amp; Dopita 2002, ApJS, 142. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>What is the difference between metallicity and abundance, and what impact would these two parameters have on the ionized emission line flux from a galaxy (assuming that the ionizing spectrum is kept constant)?</p></li>
<li><p>There are claims that some ionized lines (e.g., the auroral line [O III] at 4363 Angstroms) would become much weaker as the metallicity increases. Why? I would think that higher metallicity means more Oxygen and, assuming we keep the ionization spectrum fixed, more likely for more [O III] to exist. Should this not increase the [O III] 4363AA flux? </p></li>
<li><p>Similarly, some excitation line ratios (e.g., ([O II] 3727 + [O III] 5007)/H$\beta$, commonly known as $R_{23}$) are known to decrease with increasing abundance (measured via log(O/H)+12). Again, why? I would think if the metallicity or oxygen abundance is higher, then there is an increased chance of getting more [O II] and [O III] emission. Also, assuming that metallicity is higher, the amount of hydrogen should decrease, and this would decrease the $H\beta$ flux in the $R_{23}$ ratio above, thus increasing the ratio at high abundance. </p></li>

"Spacing (2422 days) between solar eclipses - unrelated saros numbers","<p>I just made an observation that is very puzzling.  The observation concerns total solar eclipses and their spacing in time.</p>

<p>There is another pair of eclipses that are upcoming (Aug 2, 2027 and Mar 20, 2034), and they are also spaced exactly 2422 days apart.  These are saros 136 and 130 respectively.  Again, they are unrelated eclipses from each other - OK expected.  The only thing that these two pairs of eclipses have in common is that their paths CROSS each other 2422 days apart. So, here is my question:</p>

<p>I understand the mathematics but have trouble in interpreting the meaning of the solar constant. The Intensity formula used above is generally depicted by authors as follows (as per my understanding): There is a sphere around the Sun of radius $d$ and if the power is radiated equally in all directions then each point on the Sphere receives an Intensity $I=\frac{P}{4\pi d^2}$. But the Earth is not a point object, so is this assumption valid? </p>

The 2007 images is from the WFPC2 while the one from 2015 is from WFC3.</p>

<p>I wondered why the WFPC2 image is substantially fuzzier than that from WFC3. I looked at the <a href=""http://documents.stsci.edu/hst/wfpc2/documents/handbooks/cycle17/wfpc2_ihb.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">WFPC2 manual for cycle 17</a> and found it has the ""L-shaped"" detector. Three quadrants have CCD elements with pixel spacing of 0.1 arcsec, the fourth ""planetary"" array has a pixel spacing of 0.046. However it seems more complicated because - if I understand correctly - there are different focal ratios used for the two.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The WFPC2 field-of-view is divided into four cameras by a four-faceted
  pyramid mirror near the HST focal plane. Each of the four cameras
  contains an 800x800 pixel Loral CCD detector. Three cameras operate at
  an image scale of 0.1″ per pixel (F/12.9) and comprise the Wide Field
  Camera (WFC) with an “L” shaped field-of-view. The fourth camera
  operates at 0.046″ per pixel (F/28.3) and is referred to as the Planetary
  Camera (PC). </p>

<p>However, while the <a href=""http://documents.stsci.edu/hst/wfc3/documents/handbooks/cycle23/wfc3_ihb.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">WFC3 manual for cycle 23</a> gives the pixel spacing as </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Table 5.1: WFC3 Detector Characteristics</strong> </p>
  
  <p>0.04″ per pixel </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I didn't find a focal ratio.</p>

<p>I'd like to understand why the 2007 image is so ""gaussian fuzzy"". If it were only because of larger pixel spacing it would look more blockish or pixellated. Does this mean it was using a different optical path with lower optical resolution? Is the 2007 image from the WFC part at F/12.9? Does the WFC3 use F/28.3? </p>

<p>I also don't understand the optical reason why different paths would have different optical resolutions. This would not come from different Airy disks from simple diffraction - the angular size would be unchanged. </p>

Would there be any effect on the atmosphere at the front of this direction of travel caused by additional collision / friction with space dust or solar wind? For example, if the South Pole was on the leading edge, could something like the ozone hole be exacerbated by interstellar particles, or could the auroras be more spectacular at the pole that points forwards? If so, is there evidence of seasonal variation in these effects as the tilt of the earth increases or decreases that pole’s angle towards the direction of the sun’s movement along the galactic plane?  </p>

<p>Also, would the plane of the planets be shifted slightly to the rear of the midline of the sun because the sun is, in effect, dragging them behind it?</p>

<p>Finally, is there any evidence of increase or decrease in the above postulated effect depending on whether the solar system is above or below the galactic plane during its 30 million year <a href=""https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/questions/10267/what-is-the-direction-of-the-movement-of-the-solar-system-in-relation-to-the-gal"">oscillation</a>?

"Helium in terrestrial planet atmospheres?","<p>When you look at effective temperature ranges and escape velocities of planets, there is a ""population"" where hydrogen escapes, but helium doesn't. Is it feasible that there may be planets less that about 10 Earth masses (not gas giants) with a predominantly helium atmosphere??</p>

<p>Another way of asking this question would be:
Do any models show terrestrial planets retaining a primordial atmosphere or is expected that most all will be secondary? I am guessing that very little helium is ""outgassed"", whereas hydrogen can be added to an atmosphere by photodissociation and other processes. I know that early star UV emissions, collisions, etc. will probably strip a ""close in"" planet's original atmospheres.</p>

"Is the Sun prograde or retrograde with respect to the rotation of the Milky Way?","<p>I recently learned about the terms <em>prograde</em> and <em>retrograde</em>. I've seen these terms used to describe the rotations and orbits of moons with respect to their planet, and planets with respect to their star. But I haven't been able to find what the relationship is between the rotation and orbit of the Sun with respect to the rotation of the Milky Way.</p>

<p>So, basically what I'm trying to do here is ask two questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Is the orbit of the Sun around the center of the Milky Way prograde or retrograde with respect to the rotation of the Milky Way?</li>
<li>Is the axial rotation of the Sun prograde or retrograde with respect to the rotation of the Milky Way?</li>
</ol>

<p>Regarding question #2, I know it might be considered a slightly weird question to ask, simply because the plane of the Solar System is significantly tilted relative to the plane of the Milky Way (by about 60°), and furthermore the Sun itself has its equatorial plane tilted by a few more degrees relative to the plane of the Solar System (about 7°). But if we mentally ""flatten out"" the Solar System such that the Sun's equatorial plane aligns with the plane of the Milky Way, then we can talk about whether its axial rotation is in the same direction as the rotation of the Milky Way, so I think this is a valid application of the concept.</p>

"What is the equation of state for a relativistic fluid/gas?","<p>Say we have a relativistic fluid/gas, as we have in some astrophyical systems.</p>

<p>Now let us write:</p>

<ul>

<li><p>$P$ - pressure in the fluid's rest frame.</p></li>
<li><p>$n$ - number density in the fluid's rest frame.</p></li>
<li><p>$m$ - mass of the particles.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I know that for the non-relativistic case we have:</p>

<p>$$e=nmc^2+\frac{1}{\hat{\gamma}-1}P$$</p>

<p>where $\hat{\gamma}$ is the adiabatic index. $\hat{\gamma}=1+\frac{2}{f}$ for a gas with $f$ degrees of freedom.</p>

<p>For the ultra-relativstic case we have:</p>

<p>$$e=3P$$</p>

<p>My question is what is $e(P,n)$ for a relativstic case (which is the general case of the 2 limits shown above)? I would also like to know how to derive it.</p>

<hr>

<p>Is the following way the correct way to do it ? :</p>

<p>The number density of particles is:
$$n=\int_{0}^{\infty} n_p(p) dp $$</p>

<p>The pressure is:
$$P=\int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{3} p v(p) n_p(p) dp $$</p>

<p>The energy density is:
$$e=\int_{0}^{\infty} \epsilon(p) n_p(p) dp $$</p>

<p>where:</p>

<p>$$n_p(p)= (2s+1)\frac{1}{ e^{({\epsilon(p)-\mu})/{k_B T}}+(-1)^{2s+1} } \frac{4\pi p^2}{h^3}$$</p>

<p>Here $s$ is the spin of the particles, for electrons $s=\frac{1}{2}$.</p>

<p>$$ \epsilon(p)=(m^2c^4+p^2c^2)^{\frac{1}{2}} $$</p>

<p>$$ v(p)= \frac{d\epsilon}{dp}=\frac{p}{m}\left(1+\left(\frac{p}{mc}\right)^2\right)^{-\frac{1}{2}} $$</p>

<p>From calculating the three integrals above we can finally obtain $e(P,n)$.</p>

<ul>

<p>I personally, could not just stand-by and just look at this event and not do something more. Knowing that failure, due to weather, equipment, and or other forces are stacked against me, I have to make an attempt because a chance like this will never present itself again in my lifetime.</p>

<ul>
<li>a 150 mm Celestron 6SE with an automatic GOTO mount, and an equatorial wedge. </li>
<li>The camera will be a Sony A 6000, with an adapter.</li>
</ul>

<p>TThe field of view is large because of the 1500 mm focal of the telescope. I chose device because of a trade-off that has to be made, Eddington used a 100 mm refractor scope when conducting his experiment. With any shift in the apparent position of the stars behind the sun as Einstein predicted, the 150 mm telescope should, in theory, coupled with a camera that has a 24-megapixel sensor, have the necessary resolution to image this shift like Eddington's image. If any shift to the stars is to be captured, they will appear within close proximity surrounding the eclipse.</p>

<p><strong>My problem is as follows, the telescope I will be using, will be the lens, and now the lens has only one f-stop. At f/10 and only having the ISO and shutter speed to work with, what exposure would I use ?</strong></p>

<p>Knowing that a long exposure would only manage to capture the outer corona, and possibly engulfing and obscuring any stars that shift. Likewise, a shorter exposure would capture the inner corona and thus not image any stars at all.</p>

<p>I do however plan to bracket 5 stops (shutter speeds) to better my odd of catching any shift.</p>

<p>Here are the calculations I did in hopes of getting the above result:</p>

"What supernova has created the iron currently found in Earth core?","<p>Iron is generated by stars in a certain part of their life cycle. Earth contains a lot of iron inside, however it is clear that this iron could have not been generated in a star in close proximity.
If we consider the current Earth position as reference, where would have lied 4.5 billions years ago the stars that generated the iron currently found in Earth core? Can we say that in the current Earth position there was a huge star 4.5 billions years ago? How did the iron formed in these old stars reach the primordial gas cloud that turned into the solar system? For how long did it travel? Can we say that it came from a set of stars that lived (again, 4.5 billions years ago) in the area that we now call the galaxy core, for example? Can we define the set of ""iron generating"" areas? Can we define something like the ""Earth core iron generator sphere""?</p>

I'm pretty sure these represent the same body, their trajectories differ by about a half-million kilometers only, and that difference is probably only because for one of them the trajectory is only based on a 118 day arc of it's ~100,000 day orbit at ~43 AU back in 2015.</p>

<p>Is it simply the kinetic energy of the merging objects (velocities of these objects before merger are huge, up to 60% of c if I recall correctly), so does it mean emitting gravitational waves makes them orbit slower, but retain their original masses? Or do the compact objects really lose ""real"" mass, meaning they become lighter and in case of BHs their radius changes accordingly? </p>

<p>As an example, let's assume two BHs, both with 50 solar masses, orbiting each other far enough (say 1 light year) so that GWs nor kinetic energy has no significance to these initial mass measurements. During the merge, they should radiate about 5 solar masses in GWs. Would the resulting black hole have mass of 95 or 100 solar masses?</p>

<p>I'm an amateur trying to understand what is really happening in the method. The data is time sampled at the Nyquist sampling frequency (2B) and the signal is measured at central frequency f and broadband B.</p>

<p>I studied the cross correlation between the two voltages V1 and V2 from essential radio astronomy, but didn't quite understand the method. Do we have to evaluate the cross correlation function of each reading and then plot it with time to get the pulse profile? Or do we have to take fourier transform of each pair of voltage(how?) and then plot it to get the pulse profile? We find period of a pulsar from its average pulse profile, right?</p>

<p>It is also written that to find pulsar timing, we've to fold data from many pulses modulo instantaneous pulse period (how can we do that if we don't know the pulse period in the first place?). This sentence is everywhere and I'm not able to understand it each time.</p>

<p>The equation is equation #23 in the paper. It's a model for the density of stars in the Milky Way's disk. It has an exponential dependence on both $R$ and $Z$. $R$ is the distance from the center of the galaxy, and $Z$ is the distance above/below the plane of the disk.</p>

<p>The relation is roughly this:</p>

<p>$$\varrho=\text{constant}\times e^{-\frac{R}{L}-\frac{Z+Z_0}{H}}$$</p>

<p>The problem I'm seeing is the $Z$-dependence of the formula. $R$ and $Z$ here are standard cylindrical coordinates. Thus, $Z$ can be positive or negative. The problem is that the formula blows up when $Z$ is negative. This is unphysical, since the number density must generally decrease going further away from the disk.</p>

"Tides with 3 Largish Moons","<p>As part of my worldbuilding for a book, I’d like to have a planet with extreme variance in its tides. I want lowest tide  reveal about 30 miles of floodplain, and occasional massive tidal waves. I understand that, in theory, this might be achieved by giving the planet several relatively large moons with different orbital periods, such that sometimes they are spaced out so they balance out the tides (a kind of medium tide), and sometimes they are all together on one side of the planet so that they create a highest / lowest tide.</p>

<p>How stable can such a system be? (The star and other solar system features can be whatever to improve stability, if that is a thing)</p>

"Rendering asteroid orientation as seen from Earth","<p>I am writing a program to render an asteroid as seen from various parts of the solar system.  My goal is to roughly reproduce the <a href=""http://astro.troja.mff.cuni.cz/projects/asteroids3D/php.php?script=db_sky_projection&amp;model_id=1863&amp;jd=2443568.0"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">image of Cacus</a> according to information on its DAMIT <a href=""http://astro.troja.mff.cuni.cz/projects/asteroids3D/web.php?page=db_asteroid_detail&amp;asteroid_id=1046"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">detail page</a>.  </p>

<ul>
<li><p>φ0=0 and t=JD0, so there is no initial Z axis rotation</p></li>

<li><p>Using ephemeris from the NASA/JPL Small Body Database, move Cacus to its position in orbit at JD0. (<a href=""https://i.imgur.com/ULb5NgH.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">image</a>)</p></li>

<blockquote>
  <p>A new telescope, the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP), has joined the search for energetic and elusive fast radio bursts. And in just a few days of looking, it’s already had success!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Later on, the article goes into some detail about ASKAP:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A new player is now on the scene, however, and it’s already had huge success. ASKAP is a wide-field radio telescope made up of an array of 12-meter antennas. Using phased-array-feed technology, ASKAP is able to instantaneously observe an effective area of 160 square degrees — an enormous field compared to Parkes’ 0.6 square degrees! This capability significantly increases our chances of being able to detect fast radio bursts.</p>

<p>This sounds really interesting! It is a phased array of dishes, but at the focal plane of each dish there is also a phased array of receivers.</p>

<p>This is different than just adding an array of feed horns and independent receivers as I've discussed in my surprisingly robustly unanswered question <a href=""https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/q/16237/7982"">What is the highest granularity focal-plane array on a dish radio telescope? Or is this the ONLY ONE?</a> where receivers measure intensity as pixels, in a similar way to a camera (thus the counterintuitively placed <code>astrophotography</code> tag there).</p>

<p>Here, each focal plane is equipped with a true phased array, where if I understand correctly, phase relationships between elements in the focal plane are maintained and recorded. </p>

<p>According to <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Square_Kilometre_Array_Pathfinder"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikipedia</a> and CSIRO's <a href=""http://www.ska.gov.au/multimedia/Documents/Publications/Factsheets/ASKAP_FastFacts.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Australian Square Kilometre Array
Pathfinder – Fast Facts</a> there are 36 separate 12-meter dishes in the entire array, and the focal plane of each dish is equipped with a 188 element focal-plane phased-array. 188 $\times$ 36 = 6768 channels, not counting polarizations because I don't know if they are separate channels in this case.</p>

<p>That would require quite a hefty correlater if the analysis was done flat, without any heierarchy in the calculation. This is a pathfinder for the SKA so pushing limits is important, but I'd like to know how this large number of signals is handled. Is there pre-processing?</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> How do the phased array feeds on each dish of the ASKAP interact with the entire array phasing?</p>

<p>I'm not sure of the ""focal plane array"" is located precisely at the focal plane or not. If it were, then a given source in the sky would produce signals in only one, or a small group of receivers, <em>and not the whole focal plane array!</em> One normally uses a phased array <em>instead of an imaging system</em> so there must be something more interesting going on here, perhaps only nearest and next-nearest neighbor correlations within the focal plane array but full correlation between the dishes?</p>

<p>How does this thing really work?</p>

<p>An answer was posted, then the question was put on hold. I would like to answer:<br>
If indeed someone asserted that the Sun was a star 2500 years ago, that is rather humbling. That it took until about 100 years ago for it to be proven is even more humbling!</p>

<p>People level a lot of claims against science and scientists. But if a field of knowledge <strong>takes over 100 generations to prove a true statement</strong>, perhaps they have a right to criticize. So, I think that science needs to do a better job of proving its theories. Either that, or people need to have more common sense, not to recognize something that has been staring billions of people in the face for all time. Perhaps, we should all be a bit more humble about the state of knowledge, even in obvious areas?</p>

<p>Maybe if we had taken the people who proposed this fact, and the concept of atoms, seriously at the time, we would be on our way to <em>other</em> stars by now instead of still having only visited that big white thing nearby (forgot the name just now) and that not for the past 40 years.</p>

"How old are Janus and Epimetheus?","<p>How old are Janus and Epimetheus, and are they believed to have formed out of a collision? (I think would explain their shared orbit).  </p>

<p>Not the age of their elements, which should be similar to the age of the solar system, but the age of their surface and formation.</p>

<p>Cassini told us that Saturn's rings <a href=""https://www.sciencenews.org/article/saturn-rings-age-young-moons"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">formed relatively recently</a>, 100 or 200 million years ago.  Are there similar aging techniques that can be applied to the surface of icy moons and as that been done?   (related, this type of aging technique should apply to Pluto and Charon too, because they are believed to have formed by collision).</p>

<p>Edit:  <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epimetheus_(moon)#Physical_characteristics"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">I came across this</a> which says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The extensive cratering indicates that Epimetheus must be quite old.
  Janus and Epimetheus may have formed from a disruption of a single
  parent to form co-orbital satellites, but if this is the case the
  disruption must have happened early in the history of the satellite
  system. From its very low density and relatively high albedo, it seems
  likely that Epimetheus is a very porous icy body.[4] There is a lot of
  uncertainty in these values, however, and so this remains to be
  confirmed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, significant uncertainty but probably quite old, early in the history of the satellite system, which would be fairly early in solar-system formation.  Much older than Saturn's rings.</p>

<p>I'll leave this question open in case anyone has better info, the above being from Wikipedia, though they reference a NASA article.</p>

"How to deal with shifting CCD bias (zero exposure) levels?","<p>The median values of the bias frames coming from our teaching telescope shift up or down with each capture. For example:</p>

data = np.zeros((10,255,765), dtype=np.int)
for i, f in enumerate(glob.glob('bias_*.fit')):
    data[i,:,:] = fio.getdata(f)

print(np.median(data, axis=(1,2)))
</code></pre>

<p><strong>[ 106.  106.  108.  108.  110.  108.  105.  106.  107.  107.]</strong></p>

<p>Now, during data reduction we average combine our bias frames. We also reject outliers (either minmax or sigmaclip). But if some of our frames are ""shifted"" higher than others, wouldn't this skew the averaging (and especially the outlier rejection) so that we might be introducing more noise during averaging?</p>

<p>To give you an idea of the nature of this fluctuation, I did a quick analysis: read 10 bias frames, then iterated through them, subtracting each frame from the median combination of all other frames. This gives me something like ""noise frames"", showing only how much each frame deviates from the median of the rest. Below is the code and the distributions of two of these noise frames.</p>

<pre><code>noiseframes = np.zeros((10,255,765), dtype=np.int)
otherframes = np.ones(10, dtype=np.bool) # just a mask
for i in xrange(10):
    otherframes[:] = True
    otherframes[i] = False # exclude current frame from mask
    median_of_others = np.median(data[otherframes,:,:], axis=0)
    noiseframes[i,:,:] = data[i,:,:] - median_of_others

def plotdist(i):
    frame = noiseframes[i].flatten()
    x = np.arange(np.min(frame),np.max(frame)+1)
    y = np.bincount(frame-np.min(frame))
    plt.step(x, y, label=str(np.median(data[i,:,:])))

plotdist(4)
plotdist(3)
plt.xlabel('Difference from median [ADU]')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
</code></pre>

<p><img src=""https://i.imgur.com/Q6e1Ms2.png?1"" alt=""Plot of 2 noise frame distributions""></p>

<p>All of the noise frames have near-perfect gaussian distributions with pretty much constant FWHM, it's just the central value that shifts around with each frame.</p>

<p>This leads me to a couple of conclusions: firstly, this shift truely is a shift in median value and not just a result of something like cosmic rays; secondly, the fluctuation is an additive effect and so not due to a change in gain due to a difference in voltage or something like that.</p>

<p>I also could not find any correlation with temperature or time since last readout, both of which I suspected for a moment.</p>

<p>Perhaps it's slight changes in readout time?</p>

<p>I couldn't find any mention of this kind of artefact in my own course notes. It's also not mentioned anywhere online that I can find.</p>

<p>Gaia has some kind of Orbital Maneuvering System (to borrow a Space Shuttle term) and some propellant on board, so has Planck, however I wonder how deterministic these orbits are and if both Planck and Gaia have automatic corrections and collision detection in their flight computers; L2 is ""only"" 1.5 million km (or about 5 light-seconds) away so surely there's time for manual correction.</p>

<p>Does anyone know a source which tells how different Gaia's and Planck's orbits are, if there are intersections between their orbital planes or even how likely the need for an unplanned orbital correction is? I know Lissajou-shapes from maths classes and I know how much the projected trail can differ depending on the precision of data types used in calculations (e.g. float vs. double). How does ESA/NASA handle this, now that SEL2 seems it will become a crowded place?</p>

Or maybe a technically very advanced civilization could keep its solar system inflated by the time of a deflation of the whole universe and thus survive, which leads to the interesting question, whether this solar system could <em>reenter</em> the space of the next universe after its new cosmolocical inflation and if yes, does somebody look out for stellar systems at places in space where you wouldn't expect them?</p>

<p>However: cosmological deflation? </p>

"How close are we to having the technology to measure planetary obliquity for exoplanets?","<p>As far as I can tell, we do not yet have the precision to even put reasonable bounds on an exoplanets obliquity, but wikipedia seems to indicate that this may be possible in the ""near future.""

"1:1 resonance of two planets around a star in close proximity - approximate perturbative mathematical treatments?","<p>This question is primarily about the mathematics of orbital mechanics.</p>

<p>The circular restricted 3 body problem (in 3 dimensions) assumes two massive bodies in circular orbits around their center of mass, and a third with zero mass. It is usually solved in a rotating frame and in reduced units with the separation equal to unity and the period of rotation of the frame of 2π. Five Lagrange points can be found from the pseudo-potential surface in 2 dimensions (as well as some periodic horizontal Lyapunov orbits), and things like halo, Lissajous, vertical  Lyapunov and other periodic orbits can be found when solving in 3 dimensions.</p>

<p>My question is about a relaxation of some of conditions of the problem, allowing for the third body to have a non-zero mass, at least so that the 2nd and 3rd body have some non-trivial center of mass relationship themselves.</p>

<p>I'm asking about orbits that would be periodic (or nearly-so). Mathematical stability is not necessary, small displacements can lead to exponential growth of errors, as long as there is at least one mathematically defined periodic orbit.</p>

<p>For visualization purposes, imagine moving Earth's Moon to somewhere in the region associated with the original Sun-Earth L1 point, but that's just to get the conversation going.</p>

<p>In this case, one could think of the ""Earth"" and ""Moon"" as both being in heliocentric orbits, but so close that they are in a 1:1 resonance. The ""Moon"" would orbit the Sun with an average velocity of about 1% slower than that of the Earth so that their heliocentric orbit period were the same.</p>

<p>Has this kind of configuration been explored mathematically? I don't care if it is 3D or only 2D, nor if all six 2-body interactions are considered explicitly or if there are some simplifications.</p>

<p>Basically, anything that considers some effect of the ""Moon's"" gravity on the ""Earth"" so that it is no longer treated as massless.</p>

<p>There is certainly a body of work on non-unity orbital resonances; 2:1, 3:2 etc. but has 1:1 ever been treated in some way?</p>

The current question is about the Moving-Cluster method, for which I quote from Wikipedia</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In astrometry, the moving cluster method and the closely related convergent point method are means, primarily of historical interest, for determining the distance to star clusters. They were used on several nearby clusters in the first half of the 1900s to determine distance. The method is now largely superseded by other, usually more accurate distance measures.*</p>

<p>One can find more here <a href=""http://pages.uoregon.edu/soper/Stars/movingcluster.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://pages.uoregon.edu/soper/Stars/movingcluster.html</a> . A brief description of the method is like that:</p>

<p>From photographs taken, say, 10 years apart, we can see that a star of the cluster has moved. (It has proper motion.) Let us suppose that the proper motion is an angle μ. Then the angle θ is the angle between the convergent point and the star or equally the angle between the radial and tangential speed of the moving star</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/IgIXf.gif"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/IgIXf.gif"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>If one knows the angle θ, he/she will be able to find the movement of the star and in the end, calculate it' s distance, through deduced relations beginning with $ v_t =v_r \tan θ.$</p>

<p><strong><em>Question</em></strong>
I know the <em>declination</em> and the <em>right ascension</em> of both the star and the convergent point.</p>

<p>My problem as is to find the angle θ. In the exercise I have it is requested to find the angle between the star and the convergent point, that is θ , using spherical trigonometry. My mind goes on to using the cosine relationship:</p>

<p>$$ \cos a = \cos b \cos c + \sin b \sin c \cos A ,$$ for the triangle</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Vz9RO.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Vz9RO.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>But, although it may be simple, I cannot understand where this triangle is to be implemented. What are it' s angles in my problem. Wherever I have looked, the angle θ is taken as granted.</p>

<p>So, should I use something like the triangle? If yes, what the triangle should be? Should the Sun be on one angle as the image above with the convergent point? Should I define another triangle? In the end, for whatever triangle I have thought, how will I calculate the needed sides? Note that I know the <em>right ascension</em> and the <em>declination</em> of both the convergent point and the star's.</p>

However, the echoes were imaged twice in 2004 through the Hubble Heritage program, in February and October. More happily, the HST Cycle 14 allocation committee did award our team observing time for an intensive HST imaging campaign from October 2005 to January 2006, and we also have two more epochs of observations scheduled in Cycle 15 for late 2006 and early 2007</em>"".</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Very long ""tubed"" telescopes</strong></p>
  
  <p>Telescopes built in the 17th and early 18th century used single element non-achromatic objective lenses that suffered from interfering rainbow halos (chromatic aberration) introduced by the non-uniform refractive properties of single glass lenses. This degraded the quality of the images they produced. Telescope makers from that era found that very long focal length objectives had no appreciable chromatic aberration (the uncorrected chromatic aberration fell within the large diffraction pattern at focus). They also realized that when they doubled the diameter of their objectives they had to make the objective's focal length 4 times as long (focal length had to be squared) to achieve the same amount of minimal chromatic aberration. As the objective diameter of these refracting telescopes was increased to gather more light and resolve finer detail they began to have focal lengths as long as 150 feet. Besides having very long tubes, these telescopes needed scaffolding or long masts and cranes to hold them up. Their value as research tools was minimal since the telescope's support frame and tube flexed and vibrated in the slightest breeze and sometimes collapsed altogether.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A refractor's primary lens produces an image because the angle it deflects is proportional to the distance <span class=""math-container"">$x$</span> from the center of the lens of focal length <span class=""math-container"">$f$</span> as </p>

<p><span class=""math-container"">$$\theta \approx x/f$$</span>.</p>

<p>For a dispersive material the deflection at a given point on the lens varies with wavelength, and therefore the focal length of the lens varies with wavelength. </p>

"Light patch in the night sky","<p>I am so sorry for being ambiguous. I'm not an astronomer and have have never actually even bothered to look at the sky before. I don't have a telescope nor camera. </p>

<p>Yet, I'm really really curious about what it is I saw in the sky tonight. </p>

<p>Towards, the east I first noticed a ""constellation"" the looked much like what is described to be the big dipper (It is possible that it could have been Andromeda and Pegasus). It was squarish and had somewhat of a ladle towards it's north eastern corner. The most distinguishable feature of the structure was that it had 3 stars in a straight line. It was the straightest line in the entire night sky.</p>

<p>About a hand's length to the west was another ""constellation"", my guts said it's name was Orion. Again, I have never seen, let alone distinguished, a constellation properly in my life. It was like a triangle with it's nose pointing towards the east. The sides that converged to the nose <em>seemed</em> to extend a bit backwards like antennas.</p>

<p>And to the west (a few inches north to the Orion was this strange glow. 
At first I thought it was my eyes playing tricks on me as sometimes whenever you stare into light bulb or some other light source, a faint glow in that area of your vision often persists. And as I looked directly at it, it slowly faded away into darkness and all that was distinguishable was an extremely tiny star or two. But whenever I looked to something near it (like a tree or constellation) , the patch reappeared. Then, I noticed that there was cluster of tiny little stars. I couldn't make out much. <strong>What caused that light patch?</strong> It seemed to glow in and out like it was breathing. I am sure that my eyes weren't playing tricks on me because even as I turned around and tilted my head and jumped up and down in the process, the patch remained in the same spot in the sky.</p>

<p>The location which I observed this is from Ernakulam, Kerala, India. The nearest current sky map I could find is the following from Chennai (which is really far away):<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/L7AGh.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>It seems that if there wasn't a dip at 3, and the graph would just continue, that the local max at K can be explained as being there <em>just because there is a dip at G</em>. If there wasn't a dip it wouldn't be a maximum and it'd just look like a bell-curve.</p>

"Why aren't ground-based observatories using adaptive optics for visible wavelengths?","<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_optics#In_astronomy"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Adaptive Optics</a> (AO) techniques allow ground based observatories to dramatically improve resolution by actively compensating for the effects of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_seeing"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Astronomical Seeing</a>.</p>

<p>The atmospheric effects are quite variable in both time and location. A parameter called <em>Isoplanatic Angle</em> (IPA) is used to express the angular extent over-which a given wavefront correction optimized for one point (usually a guide star, artificial or natural) will be effective. As an example, Table 9.1 in this <a href=""http://www.gmto.org/Resources/GMT-ID-01470-Chapter_9_AO.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Giant Magellan Telescope</a> resource shows values for IPA scaling almost linearly (actually: $\sim\lambda^{6/5}$)  from 176 arcseconds at a wavelength of 20 microns to only 4.2 arcseconds at 0.9 microns. </p>

<p>This suggests an IPA of 2 to 3 arcseconds for visible wavelengths, which taken by itself is not a killer limitation.</p>

<p>However, it seems almost all currently active AO work is done exclusively in various infrared wavelengths, <a href=""https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/a/14783/7982"">apparently down to 0.9 microns but no further</a>. (AO is also implemented computationally to <a href=""https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/a/13967/7982"">array data in radioastronomy</a>.)</p>

<p>Is this because the observed wavelength needs to be longer than the guide star monitoring wavelength? Because it is simply much harder and there is always Hubble above the atmosphere for visible work so it's not worth the extra effort, or is there another more fundamental reason?</p>

<li>1 convex lens    -   focal length 200 cm            aperture - 5.5 cm</li>
</ol>

<p>I can also buy lenses of range of Power(In Dioptres) from (-14D) - (+14D) of aperture range of 5.5 cm to 7 cm, if suggested.</p>

This telescope showed me a bright Mars, Jupiter and Saturn, but as dots. Upon seeing the Moon, I could just see it a little bigger than what would be seen with the naked eye.</p>

<p>I would like to know the way to make the telescope, which I would like to use to observe planets and DSOs if possible. I am ready to make separate telescopes also, if suggested.</p>

"Population of excited H levels in a Strömgren Sphere","<p>In chapter 2.2 of <em>Astrophysics of Gaseous Nebulae and AGN</em> Ostriker and Ferland claim that, as far as ionization is concerned, one can assume all atoms to be in the ground state in a Strömgren Sphere setting (static, homogeneous $n\approx 10/\mathrm{cm}^3$, isothermal $T\approx 10^4\,\mathrm{K}$ pure hydrogen cloud around a single star). While I do not doubt the validity of this assumption, I have some trouble with how they justify it.</p>

<p>They estimate the inverse ionization rate for ground state hydrogen at a typical distance from the star, which is of course the lifetime against ionization from the ground state $\tau_\mathrm{ion}^{1^2S}$. Then they say that the estimate also holds for ionizations from excited levels and they find</p>

<p>$$\tau_\mathrm{ion}\gg\tau$$</p>

<p>where $\tau_\mathrm{ion}$ and $\tau$ are the typical lifetime against excitation and the typical lifetime of excited states respectively.
So far so good. In the next step, however, they end their chain of argumentation by saying that consequently any atom in an excited state will have enough time to decay to the ground state before it can be ionized, so all ionizations are from ground state. That is my understanding at least.</p>

<p>My problem with this is the following: suppose I have some mechanism that keeps a good fraction of my atoms in an excited state. In that case, even if $\tau_\mathrm{ion}\gg\tau$, I will have ionizations from this excited level simply because it is always populated. So what one should really look at in my opinion is the lifetime of an atom against excitation.</p>

<p>My first question is: Am I missing something or did I get something wrong?</p>

<p>And secondly: If my argumentation makes sense, one has to compare the lifetime against excitation with $\tau$, right? Where can I find the corresponding cross sections for radiative and collisional excitation? I was only able to find ionization cross sections.</p>

"What's going on in this photo of Halley's comet's tail?","<p>When researching for <a href=""https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/a/29662/7982"">this answer</a> I was looking at Space.com's 2011 article <a href=""https://www.space.com/11552-photos-halleys-comet-images-astronomy.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Photos of Halley's Comet Through History</a></p>

  <p>Halley's Comet as photographed May 13, 1910, by a wide-angle camera at Lowell Observatory, Flagstaff, Ariz., during the comet's last appearance. A streak across the comet near the coma is a meteor trail, and not a scratch on the negative. Streaks at the bottom right are the city lights of Flagstaff Bright spot above the city lights is the planet Venus.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I know that 109 years ago astrophotography wasn't what is is today, but the combination of the overexposed venus, the coincident meteor trails, the non-uniform star trails blending in with the comet's tail breakup along with the unlikely looking ""smoke trail"" from the upper side of the comet's tail make this photo look quite unusual.</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> What's going on with that second tail thing above the main tail? The shape looks so unnatural, it seems to have a parallel extent rather than radiate from the coma. What caused this?</p>

"How well do planetary orbits fit with Johannes Kepler's in- & circumscribed Platonic solids?","<p>In <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mysterium_Cosmographicum#Shapes_and_the_planets"" rel=""nofollow"">Mysterium Cosmographicum (1596)</a> Johannes Kepler proposed that the relative distances between the orbits of the six ancient planets (six because heliocentrism had recently added Earth as one of the planet) correspond to the geometry of the five Platonic solids. Each planetary orbit was assumed to be the grand circle of a sphere. Each Platonic solid would circumscribe an inner planet's orbitally defined sphere, and in same position inscribe the next outer planet's ""orbital sphere"".</p>

"Detecting habitable planets","<p>From my understanding we detect planets by measuring dips in light intensity from the star the habitable planet is orbiting when it passes by it. 
There are 2 things I don’t understand about this method:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Planets in a solar system tend to orbit their star in one disc like plane. Can we only detect planets if this plane is in-alignment with our sensors here on earth/ space. I assume if someone looked at our sun from the ‘bottom’ they would never see a planet cross it. If so this would exclude a big portion of the stars we are looking at? </p></li>
<li><p>Our orbit is 1 year. I assume the orbits of habitable plants can vary and having a short/ close to 1 year orbit is not a criteria for habitability. Even so we have to measure 1 dip every year or 10. How can we tell that this a planet with a regular yearly orbit or just anything passing between the star and us. So maybe a better question to ask for number 2 is what can we find out from these dips? </p></li>

"Singularities/ringularities and their properties","<p>A black hole contains a singularity at its center. It is a zero-dimensional point, and  it's where all its mass is located. So, my first question is:</p>

<p><em>If a singularity contains all a black hole's mass, when a black hole absorbs matter, the matter should collect at the singularity. Then why does the black hole increase in size? The matter it absorbs is all in the singularity, not in the space around it...</em></p>

<p>Second, we know that spinning black holes can't have a singularity at the center as a point, because points can't spin, and when they do, they aren't a point. So there is such thing as a ringularity where it is a one-dimensional line bent in a circle that spins, and contains all the black hole's matter. </p>

<p><em>However, is a ringularity really a bent one-dimensional line in a circle, or an infinite collection of points that form a circle-looking figure?</em></p>

"Roche Zone of a black hole vs Roche Zone of Neutron Star","<p>Suppose a very unusually small back hole with the mass of about, lets say, 1.5 solar masses(hawking radiation should destroy a lot of mass let's assume). It thus would have a Roche limit smaller than larger black holes, and the Roche limit should be outside of the black hole instead of inside it, like some supermassive black holes. </p>

<p>Then, let's take a super massive neutron star, perhaps even with quark matter at its center. Even though this may not exist, let's say that is 3 solar masses by taking matter from a nearby red giant rather slowly. This would mean that it thus has a larger Roche limit.</p>

<p>Then, let's fit the two together in a binary system. Move the black hole inwards so that it is in the Roche limit of the neutron star, but its Roche limit is not affecting the neutron star. </p>

<p>My question is that, since a black hole can't physically be ripped apart by gravity due to it being a hole in space time itself, can it's structure be altered in any way by the gravitational pull of the neutron star? Like from a sphere to an oval or something like that? Can it separate into two smaller ones due to the gravity of the neutron star? In the system, who would win the gravity war? </p>

<p>Now assume that the black hole has angular momentum and change, giving it a magnetic field. Then make the neutron star a magnetar of the strongest kind, and place them in the same binary position as I described above.

"Vacuum of space","<p>Firstly I’m genuinely interesting in a working explanation for this question. It is for this reason that I am editing the question to fine tune the question. In essense the question has remained the same. </p>

<p>In order for me to check mark the best answer I’m going to ask for citations for the claims made in the answers because I’m getting lots of theory and responders are not in agreement, as far as I can tell. Also I cannot accept circular reasoning i.e. if we assume x then y, since y therefore x. That’s fallacious logical reasoning because x was never proven it was assumed and y might be independent of x. </p>

<p>The vacuum of space is incredibly powerful, 1 x 10<sup>-17</sup> torr, and the vacuum between the Earth and the Moon is 1 x 10<sup>-11</sup> torr. </p>

<h3>How can such a vacuum (very low pressure) in close proximity to the Earth’s atmosphere (high pressure) that goes to 8.5km elevation, coexist with the open system of the Earth’s atmosphere? How does this not defy the second law of thermodynamics and still remain true?</h3>

<p>Space is low pressure and the earth’s atmosphere is high pressure. In order to have any pressure the gas requires (demands) that it press upon something. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Pressure is a force exerted by the substance per unit area on another substance. <strong>The pressure of a gas is the force that the gas exerts on the walls of its container</strong>. When you blow air into a balloon, the balloon expands because the pressure of air molecules is greater on the inside of the balloon than the outside. Pressure is a property which determines the direction in which mass flows. If the balloon is released, the air moves from a region of high pressure to a region of low pressure and the balloon deflates. <a href=""https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Physical_and_Theoretical_Chemistry_Textbook_Maps/Supplemental_Modules_(Physical_and_Theoretical_Chemistry)/Physical_Properties_of_Matter/States_of_Matter/Properties_of_Gases/Gas_Pressure"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">1</a></p>

<p>Earth is an open system that presses against the vacuum of space, why therefore is the second law of thermodynamics suspended if indeed it is a law. 
Space is low pressure, therefore the atmosphere which is not in a container should disperse into the low pressure space. </p>

"Scattered Intensity of Light vs Angles of Incidence and Emission","<p>So I just derived an expression for the scattered intensity of light from an atmosphere with ideal isotopic scattering: $I/F=\frac{cos(i)}{4(cos(e)+cos(i))}$, where $I$ is intensity, $F$ is flux, $i$ is the angle off incidence, and $e$ is the angle of emission ($i,\ e=0$ are normal to atmosphere).</p>

<p>When I plot the scattered intensity as a function of $i$ with $e$ constant, it decreases while the angle increases. Why is this? My theory is that at a large incidence angle, the light encounters a larger surface area, so reflected light will have a higher variation of emission angle, meaning that scattered light at a given emission angle will be lower. Does this make sense? Or is there another reason for this?</p>

<p>Next, I plotted scattered intensity as a function of $e$ with $i$ constant. This time, the intensity increases with increases emission angle. I don't have a theory as to why this is the case, nor an intuition to back it up. Why would this be the case?</p>

<p>Could this be proven or disproven by looking at gravitational lensing of distant galaxies, by looking at Hubble Deep Field images?

It might take a computer analysis of images surrounding the ""ring"" effect to see if there is a ""radial effect"" around the ring.  Most images probably don't show enough of the surrounding area to where the radial effect as predicted in the paper <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1305.5037"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Izumi et al. (2013)</a> would be apparent.  If this is present, I would think it indicates negative mass surrounding the positive mass, and would be a huge discovery confirming negative mass!  If absent, it would likely show that there is at least not a significant amount of negative mass clustered around the galaxies (wouldn't be a total disproof of negative mass).  </p>

"How long can you be trapped orbiting around a black hole for?","<p>I have a story I wanna write but I want to be sure it's not completely scientifically irrelevant.</p>

<p>I know there is  <strong>black hole</strong> modelisation called the Kerr black holes, in which there is a limit around black holes called <strong>the event horizon</strong>. It's a spatial limit ; no light ray crossing this limit will ever be able to escape the gravity of the black hole. That's the definition of event horizon.</p>

<p>By extension, I guess any physical object (such as a spaceship) crossing the event horizon will be doomed to orbiting around the black hole until it gets destroyed. My question is about <strong>the time you can spend between the moment you cross the event horizon</strong> (= you are doomed) <strong>and the moment you actually die</strong> (for example by the tide effect, which basically destroys bodies because of the difference of attraction force between the feet and the head of a human body)? Could this moment last... 100 years ? 1000 years ?

"Age and relativity","<p>This is a question, where I start with some assertions:</p>

<p>Try to consider the universe as a four-coordinate system, x,y,z,t where t is time and where we view a change in t as a change in position, and as a velocity in the same way as any other change in either of the other components of the coordinate. Everything is then moving at the speed of c. The difference between a photon and another particle would be that a photon ""spends"" its velocity in any of the x, y or z dimensions - but not in the time dimension.</p>

<p>This implies that all photons are on the same coordinate in the t-dimension - only the x,y,z values change while t remains 0. It also implies that time would appear to stop for something travelling in only the other dimensions, while it would pass fastest for something completely stationary.</p>

<p>You can then also consider space-time as a function of acceleration. A physical objects' coordinate could be derived from its velocity, which would have to be derived from its acceleration. Acceleration would be a function of entropy, or ""age"" I believe.</p>

<p>Is this the basis of general relativity? Is it at least an initial starting point for general relativity, or is it completely wrong?</p>

<ul>
<li>When they are in front of the portal, they can see the other galaxy, which is not the case when Coop goes to the black hole at the end</li>
<li>When they go to that portal, they ""flow"" in a tube like channel. Again, that's not the case when Coop goes to the black hole at the end.</li>
<li>When Coop goes to that black hole, he goes through some sort of light dust that hits his ship, which is not the case when they go to the portal.</li>
<li>When the robot (I forgot his name) goes in the black hole, his purpose is to collect some quantic data. If the initial portal was also a black hole, he would have made that collection at that time.</li>
<li>When they goes to the portal, they seems ""confident"", but when Coop goes to that black hole, it's for killing himself. If the portal was a black hole, they would behave more identical.</li>

One of the white dwarfs ( $0.198$ solar masses) is very close to the pulsar and has an orbit period of $1.6$ d, whereas the other one ($0.410$ solar masses) is farther away and and needs about a year ($327$ d) to orbit the central pulsar.</p>

<p>Such a three-body system is in principle expected to show a chaotic behavior sooner or later, which means that collisions between these three celestial bodies can be expected and a finit life time of the system can be assumed.</p>

<p>Making some in my opinion way too hand-waving arguments, the blog post further explains that the collisions can not be expected too soon however, by taking into account that the distant white dwarf ""sees"" the inner white dwarf and the pulsar as a single central body and the relative motion of the inner white dwarf around the pulsar is rather stable and eliptic too. </p>

<p>Thinking about such multiple star systems as chaotic dynamical systems, another approach to estimate the liftime could be to make use of some chaos-theoretic methods which could for example involve the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyapunov_exponent"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Lyapunov Exponent</a> of the system, such that a large exponent would mean that the collisions happen soon and the stellar system has a rather short life time, whereas the converse would be true if the Lyapunov exponent is small (which is what I would expect for the system in my question).</p>

"What could possibly save an atmosphere other than a magnetic field? Why can't a magnetic field save the atmosphere in certain cases?","<p>Similar question <a href=""https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/questions/10189/why-did-venus-not-lose-its-atmosphere-without-magnetic-field"">here</a>.</p>

<p>We know as a fact that the magnetic field protects planets from Solar Wind, a damaging, continuous, atmosphere-stripping wind of charged ions. Thus, a magnetic field protected planet will have a stable atmosphere. Vice versa.</p>

<p>Now let's take a look at some examples that logically fit this theory.</p>

<p><strong>Earth</strong></p>

<p>Earth has a liquid iron outer core which conducts electricity generated by convection to form a huge electromagnet[technically].This magnetic field protects Earth from the Solar Wind stripping away its atmosphere. We can see its effect by looking at Earth currently, not nessesarily affected by the damaging effect of such wind on the atmosphere, only to have minor damage by direct hits of CMEs.</p>

<p><strong>Mars</strong></p>

<p>Mars used to have a magnetic field. In fact, some analyzations of the crustal fields recently made by robots sent to Mars have shown that Mars may have even had a stronger magnetic field than Earth. Sadly, about 4 bya[according to Wikipedia], either repeated bombardment from large celestrial objects that disrupted the interior, or the solidification of its outer core have caused the degration of such. Consequently, Mars' atmosphere is being constantly stripped away by the Solar Wind, and its atmosphere is drastically thinner that what is started with.</p>

<p>These are obviously some pretty straightforward examples that fit very well with the first statement.</p>

<p>Then, there are two rather contradictory planets.</p>

<p><strong>Venus</strong></p>

<p>Venus has no magnetic field. It has a very small and dilute magnetic tail according to Wikipedia, where reconnections and many different events happen. The Solar Wind carries the sun's magnetic field lines which wrap around Venus forming a not very protective induced magnetic field, and according to Wikipedia again the area magnetopause and ionopause is a strong[relatively saying] barrier which prevents the Solar Wind from penetrating deeper into the atmosphere. However, this offers in all little protection the Venus. Thus, naturally, we would expect Venus to act like Mars, with its atmosphere stripped away in a few million/billion years. Yet, this isn't the case. In face, what's more interesting is that Venus orbits closer the Sun than Mars, which means that it gets a higher ""dose"" of the Solar Wind, which should strip off the atmosphere rather quickly. Even more interesting is that Venus has a thicker atmosphere than Earth. </p>

<p>On the other question I linked, MacUserT said that </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>...the ionosphere of Venus direct interaction with the solar winds causes an externally induced magnetic field...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even if this is the case, Venus lacks a intrinsic magnetic field[self generated], which is the ""main"" protection. Even with this induced field, this protection is substantially not enough, as the Solar Wind [according to space.com] penetrates relatively deep into the planetary exosphere and causes substantial atmosphere loss. This loss, like Earth thru its poles and the tail, would mainly occur on the tail of the induced magnetosphere. The main losses would be hydrogen, helium ions, and according to Wikipedia, also oxygen ions. </p>

<p>So my question is that how is Venus exactly protected by this ""induced field"" and what is the power of the field? How much atmosphere does Venus lose in one day, and how is this induced field generated?</p>

<p>Now, let's look at another planet with opposite views.</p>

<p><strong>Mercury</strong></p>

<p>Mercury has a large core Mercury also mas a liquid outer core. It is also spinning substantially fast enough so that it can generate a magnetic field stronger that what Mars and Venus have now[It is 300 nT]. However, due to its close orbit, it faces 3 times more pressure from the Solar Wind than that of Venus. This doesn't mean nessesarily that it can't support an atmosphere. My teacher said that Mercury has a very thin atmosphere constantly being stripped away by the Sun made of gasses such as H, He, O, Na, Ca, K, and many other elements from the planetary crust. </p>

<p>However, since it has a relatively speaking, strong magnetic field, doesn't is mean that it should at least have more or less the atmosphere density of Mars? What protection does the magnetic field offer of this isn't the case? </p>

<p><strong>You may be confused so I will I guess put my questions below</strong>:</p>

<p><em>Since Mercury it has a relatively speaking, strong magnetic field, doesn't is mean that it should at least have more or less the atmosphere density of Mars? What protection does the magnetic field offer of this isn't the case?</em></p>

"How does light affect the universe?","<p>When light is emitted by for example a star, that star loses energy - which causes it to reduce its gravity. Then that energy begins a journey for potentially billions of years, until it reaches some other object.</p>

<p>When that light reaches a surface, such as another star or galaxy, it will give that energy to the destination star in the form of heat. This causes the receiver to increase its energy, in turn restoring a sort of balance. It also causes the receiver to emit a minute amount of more light again, almost like a reflection.</p>

<p>It will also excert pressure on the receiving surface once it reaches its destination, be it a star, a rock or anything else.</p>

<p>But while that light is travelling through space, its energy is ""unavailable"" to the rest of the universe. Naturally I ask the following question: </p>

<p><strong>Will light cause gravity, while it is traveling?</strong></p>

<p>Every single star emits light in every direction, and will eventually reach every other star in the universe. At any single point in the universe, there must be a continous ray of light coming from every single other star in the universe, that has a direct path to that point. Given that all stars on the sky is sending photons that reaches every square centimeter of the earth surface, the amount of pressure should sum up to be quite large.</p>

<p><strong>Is the amount of pressure really neglible, given that every single atom on any surface is receiving light from every single lightsource on the sky?</strong></p>

<p>Based on a calculation found at <a href=""http://solar-center.stanford.edu/FAQ/Qshrink.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://solar-center.stanford.edu/FAQ/Qshrink.html</a> the sun will during its lifetime emit 0.034 % of its total mass as energy. Assuming the sun is average, and that there are about 10^24 stars in the universe, and all of these stars on average are half way through their lifetime, there should be energy amounting to the gravity of about 1.7*10^22 suns distributed throughout the universe.</p>

"How did Meeus calculate equinox and solstice dates?","<p>In <em>Astronomical Algorithms</em> (2nd ed, ch. 27, 2009 corrected printing) Jean Meeus gives expressions to calculate the date and time (dynamical time, equivalent to Terrestrial Time) of equinoxes and solstices from the year -1000 to the year +3000. The expressions are accurate to 51 seconds or better for the years 1951-2050. First what Meeus calls the ""instant of the 'mean"" equinox or solstice"" is calculated using a fourth degree polynomial; there are 8 expressions. There are different expressions for each solstice or equinox, and different expressions for the year ranges -1000 to 1000 vs. 1000 to 3000. Then two corrections are applied; the corrections are calculated the same way no mater which time period or equinox or solstice is being corrected. The first step is to calculate:</p>

<p>$$T = \frac{(\text{mean JD of event} - 2451545.0)}{36525}$$</p>

<p>$$W = 35999.373°T - 2.47°$$</p>

<p>$$\Delta \lambda = 1 + 0.334 \cos W + 0.007 \cos 2 W$$</p>

<p>Next, an additional correction is computed involving 24 periodic terms with various periods.</p>

<p>Can anyone explain, in general terms, how Meeus derived these expressions? I'm especially interested in understanding what the ""mean"" value represents?</p>

<p>With the idea of being inside a black-hole, it is easier to represent this as being the matter entering the black-hole.

<li><p><strong>Dark matter</strong></p>

<p>On the contrary of matter entering the black-hole, dark matter is the matter already in front of us and we'll never be able to access it as its light (i.e. information) cannot go backward within the singularity.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Time/Gravitation</strong></p>

<p>Time is a dimension like any other and as we feel x,y,z dimensions as a field of view, we fell time as an irrepressible attraction toward the singularity. Gravity may be see also as a less irrepressible dimension (depending on mass around).</p></li>

<blockquote>
  <p>""<em>Einstein did not consider the cosmological constant to be part of the stress-energy term... a new constant of nature, 
  $\Lambda$, appears in the addition to Einstein’s original field equation. One can equally well put Einstein’s new term on the right hand side of the equation, and count [...] as part of the source term in the stress-energy tensor. The distinction becomes interesting when $\rho_\Lambda$ takes part in the dynamics, and the field equation is properly written with $\rho_\Lambda$, or its generalization, as part of the stress-energy tensor.</em>""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, Einstein treated $\Lambda$ term as a modification of GR with a ""new constant of nature"", while dark energy may potentially manifest itself in some other ways. Later they write about dark energy:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""<em>The idea that the universe contains close to homogeneous dark energy that approximates a time-variable cosmological “constant” arose in particle physics, ...in cosmology..., and on both sides by the thought that $\Lambda$ might be very small now because it has been rolling toward zero for a very long time. The idea that the dark energy is decaying by emission of matter or radiation is now strongly constrained by the condition that the decay energy must not significantly disturb the spectrum of the 3K cosmic microwave background radiation.</em>""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So if I understand this correctly the idea of a dynamical effect came from suspecting that $\Lambda$ may be time dependent, but so far that was not detected. And since ""one can equally well put Einstein’s new term"" on either side of the equation mathematically both interpretations are equivalent. Still, the dynamical interpretation seems to be overwhelmingly preferred.</p>

  <p>Are there empirical reasons for conjecturing dark energy, some spatial non-uniformity in expansion perhaps? If not, what are the theoretical reasons for preferring it to the cosmological constant of modified GR? </p>

<p>It makes sense to me that we could tell that a start has <em>some</em> planet(s) in orbit around it, based on how they affect the star's position.

"Metalicity and age of bulge stars vs halo","<p>From what I understand of current models, the bulge of the galaxy formed first, and thus, would contain older population II like stars. Currently, however, the halo has a higher population of stars with lower metalicity than the bulge. Is this because the density  of stars in the bulge is much higher? My thinking is that this is a densely populated region of massive hot stars that die quickly and create a newer region of next generation population I stars that are metal rich. The inverse would be true for the halo where stars are less densely packed. Is this correct?</p>

<p>Given this is the case, I am curious to know how it was formed in the first place? If I am not wrong planets are formed when the debris orbiting in the gravitational pull of a star stick together overtime gets in to the form of the planetary bodies. So, if WASP-18b was not always so close to its sun and it was formed far away in cold space, then could there be a possibility that, this exoplanet was formed in an orbit of another star and overtime it got away from its original orbit and trapped in the tug of its current sun? <em>(Its my imagination! just bare with it :))</em>  </p>

"Is there a mechanism that makes small moons more rounded than comets?","<p>67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko has a highly irregular dumbbell shape. But the sample of comet shapes observed is very small, so I wonder if irregular shape is the norm for comets and for small moons. Many known moons are no larger than this ~4 km diameter comet. The smallest moons imaged are modestly irregular, basically just elongated, at least they don't have a waist like 67/P. The most elongated moon is perhaps ~135/60 km Prometheus.</p>

<p>Is there reason to believe that moons which are too small for hydrostatic equilibrium get more rounded than comets of similar mass and composition? Moons differ from comets in several ways. AFAIK: Moons in general have a very different gravitational environment, a much more stable distance to the Sun, experience more frequent impacts, another formation history if not captured. Composition and density depends on the formation distance from the Sun, although even ~300 km Hyperion has a similar density as 67/P.</p>

<p>Should we expect the small moons in general, and the moons of Pluto especially, to be rounded or dumbbell shaped? If 67P is a merged binary, isn't it more likely for two objects to merge if they are moons instead of comets, since neighboring moons have low relative speed? ~100-200 km Janus and Epimetheus look as if they could merge fairly calmly. Does the lack of (observed) dumbbell shaped moons tell us something about 67P, that its shape is a rare outlier for example?</p>

"Calculating the Diameter of Jupiter through Image","<p>I was trying to calculate the diameter of Jupiter from a picture I took of it. Here's the information I was able to get that I needed to calculate the diameter:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Focal Length of Telescope: 1.2 m</p>
  
  <p>Multiplier for Barlow Lens: 2x</p>
  
  <p>Camera CCD (Sensor) dimensions: 14.8 x 22.2 (mm)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I found the diameter to be 135 pixels in my image. Here's what I did:</p>

<p>\begin{align}
f_e &amp;= \text{Focal Length $\cdot$ Barlow Multiplier}\\
 &amp;= 1.2 \cdot 2\\
 &amp;= 2.4
\end{align}</p>

<p>Then, to calculate the field of view:</p>

<p>$$\text{Field of View} = \frac{\text{Sensor Size}}{f_e} \cdot \frac{180}{\pi}$$</p>

<p>Where the sensor size is the length in millimetres of the size of the camera CCD (I used the horizontal axis, or the longer side, to get the 135 pixels, meaning that I'd use 22.2 mm), and the second fraction is there solely to convert radians into degrees. Substituting my values, I got:</p>

<p>\begin{align}
\text{Field of View} &amp;= \frac{0.0222}{2.4} \cdot \frac{180}{\pi}\\
&amp;= 0.53^\circ 
\end{align}</p>

<p>As my entire image is 4271.8 pixels wide, and I know the angular field of view, I used ratios to get the field of view of the 135-pixelled Jupiter to be $\theta = 0.017^\circ$.</p>

<p>Then, using basic trigonometry, I was able to calculate the radius of jupiter:</p>

<p>$$\tan \left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) = \frac{\text{Radius of Jupiter}}{\text{Distance to Jupiter}}$$</p>

<p>The photo was taken on March 22, 2016 - Wolfram Alpha gives 667.6 million as the distance to Jupiter on that day:</p>

<p>$$\tan \left(\frac{0.017^\circ}{2}\right) = \frac{\text{Radius of Jupiter}}{667.6 \cdot 10^6}$$</p>

<p>$$\therefore \text{Radius of Jupiter} = 97\ 577\ \mathrm{km}$$</p>

<p>Googling the radius of Jupiter gives $69\ 911\ \mathrm{km}$ as the result. Is there any reason why my value is so significantly off? Anything wrong with my procedure, anything I'm missing? I was not able to to upload this image I took as the file size was too large, however, the image does not lack clarity and I am completely stumped as to why my result is off by such a significant amount. </p>

"How can we explain high redshift numbers?","<p>I just finished an introductory astrophysics course$^1$ and I have a lingering question that I can't seem to resolve.</p>

<p>We learned that for the first few hundred million years, the universe was pretty boring and not much interesting$^2$ happened. We also learned, correctly or not, that the first stars started forming somewhere between 500 million and 600  million years after the Big Bang.</p>

<p>We also learned how to use redshift values to calculate age, and we talked about how the highest $z$-number we've discovered is some galaxy (GN-z11) at roughly $z=11$.</p>

<p>Using <a href=""http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~wright/CosmoCalc.html"" rel=""nofollow"">this calculator</a>, we calcultaed that this galaxy apparently formed about 410 million years after the Big Bang.</p>

<p>So, this galaxy seems to be older than when astrophysicists think star formation happened. How can this possibly be? Clearly one of my assumptions is wrong, so is it:</p>

<ul>
<li>Stars actually started forming <em>before</em> 500 million years post-Big Bang.</li>
<li>Using the UCLA calculator to calculate age is technically incorrect.</li>
<li>A galaxy doesn't need stars to be considered a galaxy.</li>
<li>Some other assumption I made is wrong which makes this post invalid.</li>
</ul>

<p>As a follow-up question, what happens if we keep finding galaxies at higher $z$-numbers? At what point do we need to reconsider our theory about what happened in the ""early"" universe?</p>

"Isn't the date of the Big Bang a bit bogus?","<p>If I understand correctly, the date of the Big Bang is an extrapolation of acceleration of the universe's expansion through time based on the erroneous assumption that the universe is approximately 13 billion years old. The age of the universe, as far as I can tell is based on the speed of light and the fact that the furthest we could possibly see into the depths of the universe is approximately 13 billion light-years. Isn't that sort of a cat chasing his tail?  It seems that there is no valid reason for believing that the universe is really of a radius of ~13 billion years. That is just as far as we can see. If this is wrong and there is a valid reason for believing that the universe is ~ 13 billion years old, then that fact makes for a very interesting possibility.  That the expansion rate of the universe is equal to the speed of light, which leads to a <strong><em>very</em></strong> interesting suggestion that I pursued for quite awhile (until it became apparent that the suggested size of the universe is not what it seems), that the expansion rate of the universe is equal to the speed of light.

"Angular diameter of the Sun's reflection from the ocean, seen from Sun-Earth L1?","<p>I'm trying to understand how smooth the reflecting ocean surface would need to be to produce such a small bright spot as seen from the DSCOVR satellite at Sun-Earth L1. It appears to be only about 8E-05 rad, or about 0.3 arcminutes. </p>

<p>My question is primarily about the geometrical optics involved in the reflection of light from the Sun off of the Earth. Interpretation of the apparent size and comparing to the image is secondary.</p>

<p>At a distance of 151.3 million km from Earth, the 1.391 million km diameter Sun has an angular width of 0.009196 radians. The <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Space_Climate_Observatory"" rel=""noreferrer"">DSCOVR</a> satellite is 1.586 million km from the Earth looking at the Sun's reflection from <em>somewhere around</em> the Sun-Earth L1 point. It's close to the Earth-Sun axis (the Sun-Earth-DSCOVR angle is about 7.6 degrees) so let's simplify and assume it sits on-axis.</p>

<p>The Earth's radius is 6378 km; as a convex mirror its focal length is <span class=""math-container"">$f=-r/2$</span> or -3189 km. </p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> What would be the angular size of the Sun seen from DSCOVR reflecting in a spherical mirror model for the Earth in this configuration?</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>What I'm looking at (for context):</strong></p>

<p>This <a href=""https://epic.gsfc.nasa.gov/?date=2017-08-21"" rel=""noreferrer"">sequence of images</a> taken by the EPIC camera on the DSCOVR satellite near the Sun-Earth L1 point is notable for showing the progress of the Moon's shadow across the Earth, but that's not the topic of my question.</p>

<p>The first image shows the back-reflection of the Sun from the Earth. It is likely to be from a particularly calm spot on the Ocean, but that's not for sure, there are some images that show reflections from horizontally oriented ice crystals as well. See <a href=""https://earthscience.stackexchange.com/q/10436/6031"">Are there measurements or calculations that suggest atmospheric ice plates would be horizontal to within 0.1 degrees?</a> and also <a href=""https://space.stackexchange.com/q/21587/12102"">How could the recently explained “glints” seen by DSCOVR appear so compact considering the finite size of the sun?</a> for some interesting images and more on that. </p>

<p>But that doesn't matter for the purposes of my question.</p>

<p>Width of Earth 6378 km x 2 / 1586000 km = 8.0428E-03 rad corresponds to ~1500 pixels. </p>

<p>Bright spot is about 15 pixels wide, or about 8E-05 rad.</p>

<p>Could such a small angular width be a geometrical reflection of the Sun from a very smooth ocean?</p>

"Is the angular resolution of a telescope irrespective of used eye-piece?","<p>Suppose a telescope has aperture $D = 20$ cm. The angular resolution of such telescope, according to the Rayleigh criterion (if I have understood it correctly), is given by </p>

<p>where $\lambda$ is the wavelength of light and $D$ is the aperture. Suppose $\lambda = 550$ nm (mid-point of visible light). Then </p>

<p>$$\theta = 1.22\cdot\frac{\lambda}{D} \text{ rad}

<p>In other words, the angular resolution of the telescope is $0.69$ seconds of arc for $\lambda=550$ nm.</p>

<p>Now, is it really so that the eye-piece of the telescope has no play in this at all? <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_resolution"" rel=""nofollow"">Wikipedia</a> says that</p>

And vice versa, if the angle between the stars is greater than $0.69''$ I will see them as separate stars with <em>any</em> eye-piece or magnification?</p>

Assume the star is travelling in a straight line at 5% the speed of light, and the black hole is stationary. The star would be swallowed by the black hole, and also swallowed intact. Now, the star goes supernova inside the black hole, but since its mass is very high, it too, creates a black hole. What would happen?</p>

<p>Would the supermassive black hole gain the mass of the star and things would go as normal for an outside viewer(everyday common things: black hole swallowing objects)? Would the black hole inside the larger one pull the larger one in? Or something else?</p>

"Trouble understanding speed-dispersion in (elliptical) galaxies","<p>I'm learning about LOSVDs (Line Of Sight Velocity Distributions) and I'm having a bit of trouble understanding the used terms.</p>

<p>As I understand, the LOSVD of a given (elliptical) galaxy is the density distribution of the LOS-velocities. The full LOSVD is difficult to find and it's easier to find 2 parameters of the distribution: $\bar v_{_{LOS}}$ and $\sigma_{_{LOS}}$ by fitting a (Gaussian) model to the spectrum of the galaxy.</p>

<p>I have a limited understanding of statistics, so I'm having trouble intuitively understanding what these 2 parameters mean later on.  </p>

<p>I think that $\bar v_{_{LOS}}$ is simply the average value of the LOS-velocity for the whole galaxy while $\sigma_{_{LOS}}$ is the equivalent of a standard deviation.</p>

<p>Now later on in my coursebook, there's an explanation of how to get a LOSVDs for every point (/pixel) in the (projection onto the celestial sphere of the) galaxy by using 3D spectrography.<br>
From this we can get a 3D dynamic model from our 2D kinematic model. In this newly found 3D distribution there's also 3 Sigmas, one for every dimension.</p>

The book is looking at the movement of stars in a spiral galaxy, the Milky way in particular.</p>

"Does Jupiter lose some atmosphere at all?","<p>I've hear of something like this: ""All planets lose their atmospheres eventually and they become a barren rock if given enough time.""</p>

<p>There are three types of atmospheric loss ways:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Jeans Escape: Temperature and escape velocity factors determine the gasses and the amount that's lost. Jupiter cannot lose atmosphere via Jeans escape because Jupiter has too high escape velocity and too high of a temperature.</p></li>
<li><p>Charge exchange: Solar radiation creates electrons and positively charged ions in upper atmospheres by tearing electrons off atoms or molecules. Subsequently, charge attraction and repulsion in collisions accelerates ions. Jupiter most likely cannot lose its atmosphere via charge exchange because its magnetic field is strong and extensive while no(little?) material escapes via polar wind.</p></li>
<li><p>Vertical atmospheric escape/impact erosion: Energetic objects that strike a planet erodes its atmosphere by creating a plume of heated gas. Jupiter does not lose its atmosphere via impact erosion because it has very high gravity and escape velocity. This pulls particles ejected by impact back into its atmosphere.</p></li>

<p>Since Jupiter doesn't lose atmosphere in the three types of atmospheric loss, how does it lose its atmosphere?</p>

So I started wondering what ultimately happens to the water and gas that gets blown off of planetary bodies. I would guess that given the outward pressure of solar wind and solar radiation, the direction of such material is generally outward, away from the sun. Well, where to? Media coverage of the departure of Voyager 1 from our solar system into the realm of interstellar space alerted me to the idea that there is an outer edge to solar influence, and I would guess that this is where the lighter molecules, like water and gases would tend to land. And indeed there is a collection of similar material out there at that solar radius.</p>

<p>Given these facts, is it accurate to view the Oort cloud as behaving similarly to a terrestrial cloudscape? Our clouds form at the altitude where water tends to deposit after it evaporates from the heated surface of the Earth. It gathers there and coalesces to a form which is then overcome by the opposing force of gravity. Then it returns from whence it came. Similarly, I imagine water and gases ultimately being driven from the heat of the sun to an “altitude above its surface”, where ultimately, over a much longer time scale, that material coalesces until other forces eventually drive them back toward the hot sun. Is this an accurate understanding? Is this comparison justified?</p>

"Is the Dwarf Planet class really necessary?","<p>Another way of asking this is, <strong>what is the difference between dwarf planets and asteroids? Aren't they the same things?</strong> It's just that some asteroids are spherical and others aren't...or is there something else?</p>

<p>I can understand why Pluto was demoted. Same thing happened to Ceres (after 50 years of being called a planet?) when we found out it was in an asteroid belt. It would be more helpful to laymen, I think, if the Kuiper Belt was renamed to the Second Asteroid Belt or maybe the Icy Asteroid Belt.</p>

<p>But why not stick to the original classes where we only had planet and asteroid? (and moon i guess.) Why add a new class called dwarf planets? Was it just to temper the protests?</p>

<p>EDIT: I forgot to add, we never needed a dwarf planet class before, despite knowing that Ceres was spherical for a long time. So where has this need, if it really exists, come from?</p>

"Other than relative temperatures, is there any difference between a red sun and a yellow sun?","<p>As time goes by, explanations for unusual things that exist in fiction get disproven. We know radiation probably isn't going to create a Giant ant that destroys everything, we're pretty sure we can't use ray guns, and the idea that falling into a black hole would put you face to face with Ming the Merciless is laughable.</p>

"calculating lunar phases","<p>Given a date, I'd like to return the lunar phase.</p>

<p>Jean Meeus's Astronomical Algorithms book and the many packages like PyEphem that make use its algorithms provide ways to calculate when a primary phase (New, First Quarter, Full, and Last Quarter).  The secondary phases (Waxing Crescent, First Quarter, Waxing Gibbous, Waning Gibbous, and Waning Crescent) can be easily calculated as falling in between the primary ones.</p>

<p>The percent illuminated the moon (or any other body between the observer and the Sun) can also be calculated for a given point in time. </p>

<p>We can also calculate the subsolar point.</p>

<p>The next new moon occurs 2017/7/23 09:45:34 UTC.  When should it no longer be considered new but waxing crescent?  </p>

<ul>
<li>When it is 1.0% illuminated? </li>
<li>When the subsolar point moves 5 degrees west of 180E?  10 degrees?</li>

"Is the Universe really expanding at an increasing rate?","<p>Here's what I just read from Wikipedia's page on the Hubble Space Telescope:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While Hubble helped to refine estimates of the age of the universe, it also cast doubt on theories about its future. Astronomers from the High-z Supernova Search Team and the Supernova Cosmology Project used ground-based telescopes and HST to observe distant supernovae and uncovered evidence that, far from decelerating under the influence of gravity, <strong>the expansion of the universe may in fact be accelerating</strong>. The cause of this acceleration remains poorly understood; the most common cause attributed is dark energy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don't take this at face value because we should expect more distant objects to have higher <strong>observed</strong> speeds and therefore higher <strong>observed</strong> red-shifts. Here's why.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Let's start with a model where the Universe expanded very fast early on, but has been slowing down ever since due to gravity, as one would normally expect.</p></li>
<li><p>Remember that, the farther away a cosmic object is, <strong>the farther back in the past</strong> we are observing it. An object 1,000 light years away, if it's light is reaching us now, is being observed in its state that existed 1,000 years ago. We are effectively looking through a time machine.</p></li>
<li><p>So if we observe a more distant object, we're observing an older state of that object. Therefore, we are observing it at a time when the Universe was expanding faster than it is now, so it has higher red-shifts.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>And isn't that what we observe today? The more distant the galaxy, the higher its red-shift? This is not inconsistent with a ""normal"" model where the expansion is slowing down due to gravity.</p>

<p>What am I missing? Why are scientists trying to explain such things with weird dark matter and dark energy that otherwise have never been detected or found evidence of and aren't needed for any other model, and in fact get in the way of our models of physics and quantum dynamics?</p>

"Does a planet's rotation speed and distance from its star influence the precession of its axis? And is the Earth's precession ""normal""?","<p>I guess first off, do all/most planets with a tilted axis experience precession? And if so, is it usually in the same direction (clockwise or anticlockwise)?   </p>

<p>What I'm really curious about is if a planet is tidally locked to its star, could it still experience precession which would in effect slowly shift the day-night line on the planet?   </p>

<p>I'm aware that most planets tidally locked to their stars are under more extreme gravitational forces whether it be a larger star than the sun or an orbital distance much smaller than 1AU. How would these gravitational forces affect the precession?   </p>

<p>And lastly, is there any theoretical ""limit"" to the speed of precession? I know for the Earth it takes the axis ~26,000 years to complete a full circuit. Is it typical that this process takes so much longer than for the Earth to complete a rotation or revolution or could a planet theoretically have a much shorter precession cycle and what kind of effects would such movement have on the planet itself?  And similarly, if the planet's rotation speed is much slower than the Earth due to tidal locking (let's just say ~2-3 months) would the precession eventually stop all together or not until an object stops rotating completely? </p>

<p>If anyone feels like being particularly helpful and doing some math that goes way over my head, perhaps you could give me a rough estimate of the speed of precession (i.e., length of time required for a complete circuit of the axis) for the following situations:</p>

<ol>
<li>An Earth-sized, moonless planet tidally locked in the goldilocks zone of an average red dwarf;</li>
<li>A Mars-sized, moonless planet with the same conditions. </li>
</ol>

<p>I've also read that other factors influence the precession such as the gravitational pull of large Jupiter-like planets. Is this minimal or considerable?</p>

"Why don't we see more supernovae in our galaxy?","<p>I found this on the Wikipedia page on <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernova"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">supernovae</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The total supernova rate in our galaxy is estimated to be about 4.6 per century, or one every 22 years, although <strong>we haven't actually observed one</strong> for several centuries.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That sounds like a freak occurrence to me.</p>

<p>It made me curious about the numbers so I refreshed my knowledge on the Poisson distribution. It is not specified how many centuries we have not seen a supernova, but let's assume it's only two.</p>

<p>If on average 9.2 supernovae happen per 2 centuries then the chance of having exactly 9 in any two century period can be calculated with:</p>

<p><span class=""math-container"">$$p(k) = {\lambda^k \times e^{-\lambda} \over k!}$$</span></p>

<p>Filling in <span class=""math-container"">$k=9$</span>,</p>

<p><span class=""math-container"">$$p(9) = {9.2^9 \times e^{-9.2} \over 9!}=0.1315$$</span></p>

<p>The chance that there is not a single supernova in a two century period is:</p>

<p><span class=""math-container"">$$p(0) = {9.2^0 \times e^{-9.2} \over 0!}=0.00010104$$</span></p>

<p>That's about a 1 in 10,000 chance. If ""several"" means 3 centuries, then the chance of not having any supernova is as little as 1 in 100,000.</p>

<p>So from this I can only come to the conclusion that supernovae did in fact happen in the Milky Way in the last two centuries, but that we didn't <em>see</em> any of them.</p>

<p>But now I'm confused. I read about supernovae that have happened in galaxies billions of light-years from here that lit up as the brightest source of light in the sky for days. Surely we would be able to see <em>all</em> of the supernovae that happen in our Milky Way (no more than 100,000 light years away) with the naked eye, let alone with telescopes?</p>

"Why is the core of a gas giant supported by electron degeneracy pressure instead of nuclear fusion?","<p>After a Sun-sized protostar forms, its core will become denser over time due to radiation. The core eventually gets dense and hot enough for hydrogen fusion to take place. In the late phases of the star's life, the core will continue fusing hydrogen until it runs out and outer layers begin fusion hydrogen, while dumping helium into the core. The core will get massive enough that it will begin to contract, and it will eventually become electron degenerate due to the high densities.</p>

<p>However, as the core became denser and denser, it reached temperatures at which fusion could take place, but it did <em>not</em> become dense enough for the matter to become electron degenerate, right? Only later in its life, when the star's hydrogen ran out, would it become dense enough for that.</p>

<p>So then why would gas giant cores be electron degenerate, but not become hot enough for nuclear fusion? Shouldn't they start fusing before they can become electron degenerate, as stars do? Am I misunderstanding this concept entirely, or is there more to it than what I described?</p>

"How to compare a reflector telescope to a refractor one?","<p>I already have a small 60mm Tasco refractor (with 300mm focal lenght) and a homemade 40mm refractor (with 1300mm focal lenght) and I want to buy a new telescope to have a better experience (I don't have an EQ mount yet)</p>

"Why is the moon that special? Is it really a well built coincidence?","<p>I find it funny that the moon is the only object in the solar system to almost perfectly fit the sun, resulting in the spectacular solar eclipses. No other object except maybe a few irregular moons like Pandora from Saturn would do that, and for them, they aren't round, and thus can't fully block out all light. The moon also has a perfect rotation that is almost exactly the same as Earth's rotational period, resulting in a tidal lock, which causes tides. </p>

"How large (that is, radius) could a planet be?","<p>I know that normal planets don't get any larger than Jupiter (or 2 Jupiter radii if hot), as adding more gas just increases density, not radius, until you reach the point of being a brown dwarf star.</p>

<p>That compressability, I suppose, is a property of the overall average material that forms star systems, as beyond a critical size it accretes the ambiant gas as well as dust in the cloud.  That is, it's mostly hydrogen and a quarter helium with a bit of other stuff.</p>

<p>But what about a body made of other stuff, such as rock or metal? Without worrying about planetary formation processes, just that atoms are piled together and feel self gravity. Perhaps it needs to be grown slowly so it has time to cool before adding more. Otherwise, no special techniques: just what would happen if material of suitable composition was heaped together?</p>

<p>I suspect that normal ideas of minerals would not exist under that kind of pressure, even if carefully allowed to cool. But can elements other than H and He still compress their volume in the same way, or would a rocky world be able to reach sizes of <em>millions</em> of miles?</p>

"Boötes Void numbers, 2016","<p>As a general science (hence Wikipedia!) reader, the latest information I have is that <strong>60</strong> galaxies ""have been found and counted"" inside the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bo%C3%B6tes_void"" rel=""noreferrer"">Boötes void</a>, this of 1997.</p>

<p>(1) What is the latest count of galaxies ""known"" inside the Boötes void?</p>

<p>The Boötes void is a ball 250 million light-years across. (Say, .002 of the width of the visible universe?)  It seems - unbelievable - it has only <em>60</em> galaxies.</p>

<p>The ""60"" value (or some new number since 1997), maybe I am misunderstanding it, or it is misreported, or has a different meaning?  Galaxies are counted in the thousands or tens of thousands, it seems hard to believe in a cosmological space, the number ""60"" would come up.</p>

<p>So, what is (2) the thinking on how <strong>many galaxies there likely are</strong> in the Boötes Void? An order of magnitude.  Is it ""about 100,"" or ""about a trillion,"" or what?</p>

<p>What do you (3) normally quote galaxy density in?  Galaxies per Gpc<sup>3</sup>, or?</p>

<p>Indeed, I am trying to get a (4) <strong>comparative sense of galactic density in the Boötes void versus elsewhere</strong>. What is the galaxy density in the Boötes void, versus the universe in general, or if it's more meaningful versus perhaps superclusters, walls, or?</p>

<p>Is it ""one tenth as dense""?  One zillionth?  One half?  Just how void is that sucker?</p>

<p><strong>Further...</strong></p>

<p>BruceS below has usefully pointed out that, indeed, the ""60"" galaxies are anyway <em>only in a small tube which apparently cuts through</em> the Boötes Void.</p>

<p>Does this mean that, incredibly, the actual main body of the Boötes Void - putting aside that tube - <strong><em>is literally empty, no galaxies at all</em></strong>??</p>

<p>That seems totally incredible.  I feel we really need a galaxy-counting astronomer to clarify the nature of the Boötes Void.</p>

<p><strong>My question: Can we measure the average temperature of the heliosphere? If so, then what is it?</strong> </p>

<p>This might be quite hard to define as how do you determine when our solar system ends? So for the purpose of this question the following assumptions should be made:</p>

<ul>
<li>The distance from the Sun to the edge of the heliosphere is <a href=""http://www.solarviews.com/eng/solarsys.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">approximately 100AU</a> (Roughly the size of the heliosphere as measured by <em>Voyager 1</em>).</li>

<li>Assume we are measuring the black body equivalent temperature (as this is what was measured to calculate the temperature of the universe).</li>

I have no chance of a high rank in this competition so I'm not hesitant to ask for help.</p>

<p>I used the R contourLines function to identify the isophotes of the galaxy and then fit ellipses to each isophote. This seemed to work well, the isophotes are almost always well fit by the ellipses and the ellipses are nearly concentric. Then letting <code>I</code> be the pixel intensity of an isophote and <code>R</code> be the length of the semi-major axis of the corresponding ellipse, I need to fit an equation of the form</p>

<pre><code>log I(R) = log I_0 - k * R^(1/n)
</code></pre>

<p>The simple approach seemed to be to take the log of both sides and use OLS regression, so I fit a linear model in R of the form</p>

<pre><code>log(log(I)) ~ log(R)
</code></pre>

<p>The resulting graphs showed a good fit but the resulting Sérsic indices n are almost always less than one and never as big as two. This doesn't seem right since indices of 4 or higher seem common in my reading. I don't get anywhere near 4 for an image of M87.</p>

<p>After watching the Thunderbolt Project on Youtube I have a very very very fresh perspective on the universe - the electric universe. From the electric comet theory that pretty much proves water forms at the comet, and comets are not frozen water. </p>

<p>In the solar wind all that hydrogen missing an electron and/or free electrons, fuse/react with oxygen-silicate elements of long orbit bodies that have been long long long holding opposite --- charges +++ inside and at the outside surfaces. When the rocky body nears a sun it gains plasma discharged from the sun, it arch's like a plasma torch, and water is formed, stealing the oxygen long held in the rock formation.  A comet is an asteroid that has just had a long long long time to build up a charge. </p>

<p>So with that and deep space showing dancing archs of electric plasma, ie space lightning, across the universe being as, or more influential as a force/energy, than gravity even, and with Einstein's admission that he was missing something in a unified theory, my question is: while neutrinos interact weekly with quote unquote solid matter, in a magnetic electrified universe are neutrinos subject to capture/interaction in Electro-magnetic currents or where voltage potential and capacitance is built up ? A?</p>

<p>I understand particle accelerators speed up sub atomic particles using electromagnetism but does it also translate that due to speed of atomic particles they are more likely to react with neutrinos than as a solid in out environment? B?</p>

<p>This contrasts with my understanding of atmospheric effects. Here on Earth, the Moon does appear more yellow (and when halfway or less above the horizon, even red) during Moonrise. The atmosphere tends to scatter blue light, leaving only yellow and red behind.</p>

"Explaining Dark Matter and Dark Energy to layman","<p>With my little knowledge, I know this:</p>

<p><strong>Dark Matter</strong></p>

<p>The center of a galaxy controls/attracts its objects (stars, planets, comets etc.) towards itself because of gravity. But the mass of the center of this galaxy appears to be less than what it should take to attract all objects of the galaxy. Hence Dark Matter is there, which makes this attraction or controlling possible.</p>

<p><strong>Dark Energy</strong></p>

<p><strong>Surprisingly, this information is nowhere to be found in one place as an overview.</strong></p>

<p>I appreciate that the largest chunk may be dark matter (is that right?); but I don't even have a <em>ballpark idea</em> for the rest. It's the sort of knowledge that is obvious to professionals, but surprisingly not outlined in any of the usual popular science sources.</p>

If two stars of different masses were travelling in a centripetal motion around the center of our galaxy, and they were pulled towards the center (which <em>i think</em> would result in two different accelerations completely) could a situation result where two stars collide or join into a system?

"Oscillation in tilt of the solar system","<p>I know that the solar system is tilted 62.6° to the plane of the galaxy.  I'm curious whether this angle changes over time, and what are the extents and time frame of any such oscillations if they exist?</p>

<p>Upon reflection, I'm assuming that since such an oscillation would require a change in the overall angular momentum of the entire solar system, and that would necessitate a collective re-orientation of the orbit of every planet, dwarf planet, SSSB, etc. related to the Sun that it's unlikely that any such mechanism exists?</p>
"
"Semimajor axis variations in co-orbital moons","<p>I've been playing with simulations of co-orbital bodies similar to Saturn's moons Janus &amp; Epimetheus- horseshoe orbits where the two bodies are of comparable mass- and I'm seeing some very odd patterns that I can't explain.</p>

<p>What ""should"" happen is that the body with the slightly smaller orbit will eventually overtake the outer body; when their mutual interaction becomes significant compared to their interactions with the primary, the lower body is accelerated forward into a higher orbit, while the higher body is accelerated backward into a lower orbit, they switch positions around their average orbital radius, and then separate again.</p>

<p>What I'm seeing in simulation, however, is a little more complicated. When I simulate the Saturn+Janus+Epimetheus system, the moons' semimajor axis very slowly migrate farther away from their average up until they swap; right around the swap, the difference in semimajor axes is maximized, and they drift closer together for half a cycle and then farther apart again before the next swap. This creates ""u"" and ""n"" shapes on the plot of semimajor axis over time, with the plots for each moon in opposite phases.</p>

<p>For Janus and Epimetheus, the effect is very small, but increasing the masses of the moons amplifies it, to the point that the maximum separation in orbital radii that occurs during the moons' closest approach to each other is ten or more times larger than the ""normal"" separation during the middle of a cycle.</p>

<p>There is of course the possibility that this an artifact of errors in my simulation software, but I think that is unlikely given the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>All other aspects of the Janus+Epimetheus system are reproduced perfectly- individual orbital periods are correct, average semimajor axes are correct, the frequency of the swaps is correct, and my simulation conserves energy to within less than 1 part in 1 trillion over a petasecond of simulation time (approx. 31,689 years).</li>
<li>The effect is perfectly regular, and simulated systems remain stable. If the effect was a result of simulation errors, I wouldn't expect them to behave so nicely.</li>
</ol>

<p>My first thought was that perhaps the semimajor axis of each moon was being affected by the added gravity of the other moon when they are on opposite sides of the primary from each other, and when they approach more closely they won't be pulling each towards the primary as strongly. That, however, should result in a uniform expansion and contraction of both moons' orbits as they get respectively closer and farther away from each other. What I actually see is that the inner moon's orbit gets <em>smaller</em> while the outer moons orbit gets <em>larger</em>, and vice-versa.</p>

<p>So, is this likely to just be a simulation error after all (if it helps, I am using the 4th-order Hermite integration algorithm)? If not, what is the explanation for it? Has such an effect been documented before, and if so, where?</p>

"Making sense of the lomb-scargle periodogram","<p>I am trying to use the periodogram to tell when a signal is periodic or not by following the tutorial for the astropy Lomb-scargle periodogram here.</p>

<p><a href=""http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/stats/lombscargle.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/stats/lombscargle.html</a></p>

<p>I simulated some data, one that is a sinusoid (period = 200) and one which is a skew gaussian (i.e, a single transient event). The hope was that periodogram would pick out the period for the periodic object and and give a  period for the transient that would imply a single event occured in the window. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, the results don't make sense at all. I have attached code at the end and the figures generated below. Due to random noise in my simulation, each result is different and I provide two examples of the results below. I use the same method outlined in the link above where we use the function <code>LombScargle.model()</code> on the best fit frequency from <code>frequency[argmax[power]]</code></p>

<p>The red line is the true function I simulated the data from. The green is the best fit from the periodogram. The right hand plots are the PSD from the periodogram.</p>

<p>Example 1
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/06Bmn.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/06Bmn.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Here we can see the best fit frequency for the sinusoid (top right plot) picked out is 0.105 (i.e. a period of 9-10 days) which is not near a frequency of 0.05 I'd expect for something with a period of 200 days, yet when I feed this best fit frequency of 0.105 to the lomb-scargle model fitter, a nicely matching periodic curve comes out with a period of 200 days? </p>

<p>This does not make sense.</p>

<p>Example 2</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/DJbvQ.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/DJbvQ.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Here I ran the code again and this time the results are switched around? It fit a very large period to the transient so that I can confidently say it is a single transient event yet the sinusoidal fit is terrible. The best frequency is still 0.105 (period=10) yet the lomb-scargle model fitter overlays something that appears to have a period of 60 days which is wrong?</p>

<p>Could I get clarification on if i'm doing something wrong? I've been told the periodogram is the de facto tool for unenvenly sampled data like this yet... the results seem awful half the time.</p>

<p>To clarify my questions</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Can it be explained how in the first plot the best-fit frequncy of 0.105 that I feed into the astropy lomb-scargle model fitter somehow creates a correctly matching sinusoid with frequency 0.05? What is the explanation?</p></li>
<li><p>Why are there 5 strong peaks in the top right plot for the periodogram in example 1 when I only expect 1? The middle two are close to the real value of 0.05 (at 0.045 and 0.055)</p></li>

<p>Are there any good studies out there on how many 24 hour days were in a year, 100, 300, 500, 800 million years ago?  or 1 or 2 billion years ago?  Either geological or orbital modeling?   Preferably something a layman can read, not something written by and for PHDs?</p>

<p>Or any good summaries, also encouraged.    Thanks.</p>

"When would we detect a tiny meter size natural satellit in a geostationary orbits?","<p>A natural, tiny (meters-size, maybe 10.000kg mass) natural satellite could be trapped in a geostationary orbit. I wondered for quite some time:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When and how are we able to detect these satellites?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I assume the distance of 35.700km of way too far for naked eye detection. So the next realistic opportunity would have been <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Galilei</a> who first used telescopes for scientific observations of the sky. Could he have detected such an object?</p>

<p>Now even if he had enough resolution, he certainly didn't systematically cover the whole <strong>4<span class=""math-container"">$\pi$</span> of the sky</strong> (especially as the satellite could be syncronous with the other side of the earth, and he could never see it).</p>

<p>Then, would it be at the times of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Hubble"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Hubble</a> (because of the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Wilson_Observatory"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Mount Wilson Observatory</a> and other similarly powerful telescopes)? Would it at the times when quality equipment for <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur_astronomy"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">hobby astronomers</a> became cheap and therefore widespread enough (to cover huge areas of the sky)? Or would we - until today - not be able to detect such objects?</p>

<p>To answer this question, one needs to consider both the technical ability as well as the area of the sky that is covered. </p>

"How Can I Interpolate Ephemerides?","<p>I have two ephemerides for <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_elements"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">orbital elements</a>—that is, each contains $a$ (semi-major axis), $e$ (ecc.), $i$ (incl.), $\Omega$ (long. asc. node), $\omega$ (arg. of peri.), $\tau$ (time of peri.), $T$ (period), and a timestamp $t$.</p>

<p>I want to compute a new ephemeris at a point somewhere between these two ephemerides.  For example, the timestamp ($t$) of the new ephemeris can be calculated by a linear interpolation of the start ($t_0$) and end ($t_1$) ephemerides' times as:$$
    t = \text{lerp}(t_0,t_1, x) = t_0 \cdot (1-x) + t_1 \cdot x
$$</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I can't seem to get an interpolation for the other parameters that doesn't have discontinuities in it.  <strong>My question: how <em>should</em> I be interpolating ephemerides?  Maybe I need to do this through some intermediate parameters, like $\varpi$, $\lambda$, or $\nu$?</strong></p>

<hr>

<blockquote>
  <p><sub><sup>For example, if I take $\tau$ from the first ephemeris and lerp everything else, I get a strong discontinuity when mean anomaly is calculated (as $M:=n (t-\tau)=(2 \pi/T) (t - \tau)$).  I suspect this is because the mean anomaly calculation is only valid at the ephemeris, and as e.g. $T$ changes due to interpolation, $M$ changes erroneously.</sup></sub></p>
  
  <p><sub><sup><a href=""https://pastebin.com/q934rL9K"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Here</a> is an example for Mercury.  The first three ephemerides come from NASA HORIZONS and are correct.  Interpolating the first two ephemerides produces $M=328^\circ$.  However, two seconds later, the interpolation (which is now interpolating from the last two ephemerides) produces $M=294^\circ$.</sup></sub></p>

"Why are radio telescopes shaped so differently than optical telescopes?","<p>Why are radio telescopes typically only a dish with a receiver above it, while optical telescopes have a primary, plus secondary and sometimes even a tertiary mirror?</p>

<p>In other words, why do radio telescopes have only one reflector, while optical telescopes have up to three or more?</p>

<p>The same wave phenomena, such as focusing, should apply in both cases. So I don't understand why the geometry would be radically different. You could just replace actual mirrors with a convenient solid, such as plastic, that reflects radio waves just as wells as mirrors reflect optical waves.</p>

"In an area with lots of light pollution, which clear sky clock parameter is most important?","<p>I live on the periphery of a large light dome, looking towards the West. I get about 1/3 of the sky towards mountains that is darker. According to ClearDarkSky.com I live in an area with artificial to night sky brightness ratio of about 9.00, Sky Brightness mags / arcsec<sup>2</sup> V Band of about 19.5, and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bortle_scale"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Bortle Scale</a> of about 5.</p>

<p>On the Clear Sky Clock (also at ClearDarkSky.com) I see the following sky values:</p>

<ul>
<li>Cloud Cover</li>
<li>Transparence</li>
<li>Seeing</li>
<li>Darkness</li>
</ul>

<p>Which of these values is most important in a light polluted area, especially when looking west in my case to the darker sky portion?  I'm thinking it is transparency as low transparency may result in more scattering of light pollution and thus more pollution?  But perhaps moon phase beyond a certain portion matters too, especially if the moon is in the west.</p>

<p><em><a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/q/163847/19561"">Why does Jet's old watch show 15 hours?</a></em></p>

"Why one cannot escape from a black hole","<p>The usual explanation is that escape velocity of a black hole is above speed of light, therefore nothing can escape because nothing can move faster than light.</p>

<p>This is however a fallacy, because escape velocity only pertains to bodies ""without propulsion"", or in other words without any force other than gravity acting on them. As an example I could theoretically escape Earth's gravity at a walking speed, just give me a staircase and I could walk all the way to the Moon. No need to accelerate to 11 km/s at any point.</p>

<p>How does this affect black holes? Why cannot I have a staircase and climb out?</p>

<p>I know the staircase idea must be wrong, but I would like to know why. My guess is that I am applying Newtonian mechanics to a problem which requires general relativity approach, because Newtonian mechanics approximation fails badly around such massive gravity fields?</p>

<p>Anyway, according to Newtonian mechanics one can easily escape a black hole, even if we assume that speed of light cannot be exceeded.</p>

"Does matter accelerate to the speed of light as it approaches the singularity?","<p><span class=""math-container"">$$v_\mathrm e=\sqrt{\frac{2GM}r}$$</span></p>

<p>If we understand the escape velocity to be the speed needed to escape from the 'surface' of a gravitational object described by the above equation.</p>

<p>It is equally true that the escape velocity is the speed an object pulled from rest will reach when it hits a certain point in the gravitational field.</p>

<p>Since the event horizon is defined as when the escape velocity reaches the speed of light for a black hole, would matter accelerate near the speed of light as it approaches the singularity? Accretion disks are known to move at relativistic speeds near the event horizon, but perhaps oddities occur beyond this point?</p>

<p>The event horizon can be derived from setting the escape velocity of an object to the speed of light, it is a point of no return. I understand there are better definitions, but this is not really germane to the question at hand. How about from the perspective of another in-falling observer?</p>

"If the earth stopped rotating, would we really fly inertially at 1000mph?","<p>I heard this on Prof. Neil Tyson's StarTalk podcast (<a href=""https://www.nerdist.com/2011/11/nerdist-podcast-139-neil-degrasse-tyson/"" rel=""nofollow"">this episode</a>) and had a question about it. In a Q&amp;A session, a listener had asked what would happen if Superman really did stop the earth from rotating and rotated it in the other direction. Prof. Tyson's response was that if the earth, which is rotating at approx. 1000mph about its axis, is stopped, everything that is not anchored on earth will move the opposite direction at 1000mph and we'd all go crashing into things at that speed.</p>

<p>I suppose that is just simple inertia: if a body moving at 1000mph is stopped abruptly, everything that was moving with it but not attached to it would indeed attempt to continue in the same direction at 1000mph. However, the earth is <em>rotating</em> rather than moving in a straight line. Essentially, gravity is strong enough to ensure that we are not thrown off into space by the centrifugal force from the earth's rotation (we aren't holding on to our dear lives as the earth turns at 1000mph). So in a sense, aren't we <em>anchored</em> to earth by gravity? And therefore, doesn't it mean that if the earth stopped abruptly, we'd just stop with it? (I'm thinking of say a centrifuge with test tubes attached to it. Though as I think about this, I feel that we'd sway at the point of attachment instead of stand still, were the earth to stop).</p>

"Why do planets and satellites in the Solar system look so wildly different if they came from more or less the same matter?","<p>First, the planets. We have Mercury, which is rocky, no atmosphere. But then we have Venus, which is completely different: thick atmosphere, very hot, geologically active. Then Earth - blue, full of water. Mars, the opposite: red like nothing else. Jupiter and Saturn are fairly similar. Then Uranus and Neptune, fairly similar but still differ in color between each other and also totally different in color than the two gas giants.  </p>

<p>On the other hand: satellites. Let's analyze satellites of Jupiter and Saturn.  </p>

<p>Ganymede and Callisto fairly similar, but then Europe, total opposite: completely icy. And then Io, again something completely different: strikingly yellow.</p>

<p>Saturn's moons: mostly rocky, but then, something completely different: Titan, with a thick atmosphere like no other satellite and oceans of liquid methane.</p>

<p>If during the formation of the Solar system there was a protoplanetary disk of matter, wouldn't it be pretty homogenous and therefore give rise to similarly looking planets? I understand that gas giants can't look the same as rocky planets, but why are there differences even between similarly sized rocky planets? Granted, there are wildly different temperatures throughout the Solar system, depending on the distance from the Sun, which probably explain some of the differences. </p>

<p>But then what I especially don't understand are the differences between the satellites. If say Jupiter had a disk of matter orbiting it, which eventually formed into satellites, wouldn't at least that ""local"" disk around a planet be fairly homogenous? But nevertheless it developed into wildly different satellites. For example, how did the ""yellowy"" thing get concentrated on Io, and not equally distributed on all the Jupiter's moons?</p>

"Understanding expected TESS data structure","<p>I'm interested in trying to use the data that will be returned by TESS to apply some machine learning/computer sciences concepts. I'm not sure yet what I want to try to do with it (though I have some ideas - see end comments). This because I don't really understand the data structure it will be using. </p>

<p><strong><em>So essentially I would like to first some help to get a high-level view of how the TESS data is structured. Then a bit of guidance as to how I could visualize it/get started with some basic example</em></strong> </p>

<h2>Additional info/what I know at this point</h2>

<p>I've checked out <a href=""https://archive.stsci.edu/tess/ete-6.html#ffi"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the MAST page</a>. It details what type of FITS documents will be returned.</p>

<p>I have downloaded samples of some of these data products and I see they all come in FITS format. On Ubuntu, you can open that in <a href=""http://aladin.u-strasbg.fr/AladinDesktop/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Aladin</a>. However Aladin in itself is a fairly involved piece of software. Do I need Aladin for this, or are there simple alternatives to just view the data quickly to help get a feel for what it means? In other words what kind of navigator do you use for FITS files?</p>

<p>I'm pretty new to astronomy - I'm coming at this rather from a computer science perspective. Some basic suggestions as to what kind of observation an amateur astronomer might want to look at would be welcomed if you have some.</p>

<p>The data linked above (MAST page) are <strong><em>simulated data</em></strong> (real data will only be available in a couple months). This is fine - mostly interested in being functional with the data when they arrive.</p>

<p>Data analysis ideas:</p>

"location of the sun on the celestial sphere","<p>The Sun, in its apparent motion along the ecliptic through the year, passes over the background of distant stars. However, given that we can't observe those stars due to the brightness of the Sun, how were the ancient astronomers able to identify which star the Sun appears to be over or near to?</p>

<p>The only possible explanation I can come up with is that they observed the morning sky just before dawn (while stars were still visible) or the night sky just after sunset and so they couldn't really identify the precise location of the Sun on the celestial sphere but they could describe its position in rather general terms, which is why they might say, e.g. that the Sun is in the constellation of the Capricorn. Am I missing something?</p>

"Various moon orbits","<p>Orbits can follow certain patterns, as I am aware.  Some include a circular orbit around the bulk of the planet, a polar orbit spinning about the pole...</p>

<p>What I'd like to know, for a planet with two moons (one large one in a circular orbit at the equator, more or less), could the smaller moon, at a larger range but higher velocity, be pulled into an orbit that looks like a polar orbit for part of it's cycle, then transition towards a circular one before ""flipping"" back towards a polar orbit on the opposing pole, dancing between the three states either in sequence or seemingly at random as the smaller moon approaches certain criteria, being tugged on by the planet, the larger moon, the sun, maybe other planets in the system.</p>

<p>Is this feasible, or does it break the laws of orbital dynamics to have such a situation occur?  This is for a story I am writing centered on a planet other than Earth, but is relatively Earth-like in it's properties.</p>

<p>Size and density the same as Earth.  Orbit a bit tighter and faster than Earth's in relation to it's sun.  The smaller moon is perhaps 200 square miles in surface area, tidally locked stone and ice.  The larger is perhaps 42 million square miles in surface area.</p>

<p>Any thoughts on this?  The basic idea is that this smaller moon, Eamor, is going to be seen in the night's sky almost like a star to the naked eye, racing across the skies as if scared of it's own shadow, sometimes disappearing under the horizon only to dart back up again.  Hence the name, which means, in the language of one culture on the planet, ""one who is terrified"".</p>

"Isn't it likely that most extra solar planets don't transit their star in line with the Earth?","<p>In which case, for every planet that we detect, there should be significantly more that we can't detect because they don't transit in line with the Earth and, thus, are invisible.  Now, I suppose that we can reasonably assume that most planets in a given solar system orbit in a fairly well defined plane, so if we detect one planet then there are probably others in the same plane.  But, if we have detected no planets in a system, isn't it simply more likely that the planets are orbiting in a plane that doesn't bisect the Earth?  If that is the case, since there is such a tiny degree of variation that would allow a transit to be observed, shouldn't there be a huge number of planets that are not visible because the inclination of their orbital plane is something other than 0 (with respect to the Earth)?</p>

<p>According to the story, this happens on May 11, 1984.</p>

<p>The story also mentions that the previous occurrence would have been in 1905, and the following one would be 100 years following this one, presumably in 2084.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The radio has just printed a message from Earth, reminding me the transit starts in two hours, as if I’m likely to forget, when four men have already died so that I can be the first human being to see it, and the only one, for exactly a hundred years.</p>
  
  <p>It isn’t often that Sun, Earth and Mars line up neatly like this. The last time was in 1905, when poor old Lowell was still writing his beautiful nonsense about the canals and the great dying civilization that built them.</p>

"Why is the speed of light 299,792,458 meters/sec?","<p>Ok, I am majoring in physics (4th year) and I never understood this fundamental (kinda) question. Maybe I haven't explored it enough.</p>

<p>For example, why does it take 8min20sec for the light from the sun to get to us?
I know the answer to this question on a 'surface' scale. The sun is 1AU away, c=3E8 m/s, and d=v/t to get approx 8 min 20 sec. </p>

<p>my question is on a deeper level. </p>

<p>Say you could ""ride a photon"" I KNOW THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE, but just say you could. Or a better question: what does a photon experience? The photon, as per my understanding, would leave the sun and (if it is on the right trajectory) hit the Earth instantaneously. A photon leaving Alpha Centauri would see the universe all at once, in a infinitesimal small unit of time (if directed out to space). </p>

<p>If a photon sees everything all at once, why do we perceive it to have a speed? I am sure this has something to do with frames of reference, special relatively, Lorentz transforms? but just seems strange. why is the speed of light finite to us... if it was infinite would this be problematic? </p>

<p>This destruction is portrayed as things (like a sword) suddenly getting lighter, and people and buildings starting to float up in the air, as the atmosphere of the planet is being sucked into the three aligned suns. This is explained as being a ""Trisolar Syzygy"".</p>

<p>However, I don't understand how that is possible. As I understand it, a syzygy happens in any sort of gravitational alignment of some astronomical bodies, and it's apparently <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syzygy_(astronomy)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">what generates the tidal variation on the earth from the moon's orbit</a>.

I'm doing all right, but have hit a roadblock: understanding the meaning of the stellar color value G<sub>BP</sub> - G<sub>RP</sub>.</p>

<p>G<sub>BP</sub> is the blue photometry value, and G<sub>RP</sub> is the red photometry value, so G<sub>BP</sub> - G<sub>RP</sub> is the difference between the two, giving a number broadly encoding the star's color. Here's a graph from the paper that uses this value:</p>

<p>It's a graph of white dwarf (""WD"") color versus absolute magnitude. On the left, the absolute magnitude M<sub>G</sub> increases (downwards) as the star grows dimmer, and across the bottom the color G<sub>BP</sub> - G<sub>RP</sub> increases (rightwards) as the star grows redder. Hence the slope of the curve; as a WD cools, it gets smoothly dimmer and redder.</p>

<p>But wait! as a star gets redder, the the ""blue"" brightness should become relatively smaller than the ""red"" brightness, right? So, the G<sub>BP</sub> - G<sub>RP</sub> value should get smaller and smaller, right? But that's the opposite of what this graph (and other graphs in the paper) apparently shows.</p>

<p>Okay, so I have a ratio.  How do I implement that together with the position angle to work out the direction of the illuminated limb and the amount illuminated?</p>

<p>I'm assuming that the ratio 1.0 is totally illuminated (i.e. Full Moon)
and 0.0 is nothing (i.e. New Moon).</p>

<p>and then there is the position angle, I'm assuming that the direction in degrees is starting at 0 pointing upwards.  Is that the crescent shape direction i.e. the horns are pointing away from the directional angle?</p>

<p>I would like to be able plot this so that I can show visually the moon's illuminated fraction and direction for any day in any given year.</p>

<p>As I said, I have the numbers, I'm trying to translate that into a more visually appealling and meaningful result.</p>

<p>Meeus says this is the selenocentric elongation of the Earth from the Sun (Phase Angle) - i.   </p>

<p>the formula for illuminated fraction k is:</p>

<p>k = ( 1 + cos i ) / 2</p>

<p>tan i = (R sin l) / (D - (R cos l))</p>

"Our Sun already a White dwarf?","<p>I watch the discovery science channel a lot &amp; enjoy the material about space, stars, planets, etc.  In one episode the narrator states our Sun will one day become a white dwarf star.  The size of our Sun will double and ultimately the Earth will be inside this enlarged Sun. This the end of all life on Earth.  Then I read a recent Snapple bottle cap that stated our Sun is really white.  I read it again and chuckled: is it already a White dwarf star at this point?  I take it that the original color of the star happens to be white.  How will we know when the Sun will become a White dwarf and increase in size the engulf the Earth?

"Can someone explain a Geostationary Orbit in a simpler way?","<p>According to Wikipedia (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">link</a>),  a geostationary orbit, geostationary Earth orbit or geosynchronous equatorial orbit (GEO), is a circular orbit 35,786 kilometres (22,236 mi) above the Earth's equator and following the direction of the Earth's rotation. An object in such an orbit has an orbital period equal to the Earth's rotational period (one sidereal day), and thus appears motionless, at a fixed position in the sky, to ground observers.</p>

<p>My question is then couldn't any orbit be a GEO? I mean, what about a satellite in an orbit that's say 70,000km, if the angular speed of the satellite was the same as the earth's rotation such that it always stayed in a fixed position when observed from the Earth, then isn't that a GEO orbit as well?</p>

"Why are distant galaxies not visible in the observable Universe?","<p>Assuming that the Universe is and has been expanding ever since its creation (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang"" rel=""nofollow"">Big Bang theory</a>), the galaxies that are now at the 'edge' (not visible theoretically) must have been (at some point in time) at a place around where the Earth is at now.</p>

<p>If it is assumed to be true, then the photons emitted by these galaxies from this point onwards should be around for us to see these galaxies (and even the first light emerged from the Big Bang must be visible).</p>

<p>Then why is the observable so small? It should depend upon the direction in which we look. That is, if we look in the direction of the center of the expanding sphere, it should be a small observable universe. If we train our telesopes in 'exactly' opposite direction of the center, it should be 'fully' observable.</p>

So, imagine, we are getting really good at off-earth mining at a larger scale and in a larger timespan, we continue to mine thousands and thousands of asteroids. Wouldn't that affect the gravitational balance of our star system at some point, or is the gravitational influence of an asteroid belt negligible? I am talking about extreme examples, like removing nearly the whole asteroid belt beyond Mars. Also, what would happen to all the stuff we don't need from an asteroid?</p>

<p>The above text reads </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>... but due to its proximity to the NCP it has taken on the popular name of Polaris. The star itself is actually rather interesting; it's really a multiple star consisting of at least six stars in orbit around each other.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While in his <code>Crash Course Astronomy Series</code> <a href=""https://youtu.be/pIFiCLhJmig?t=4m16s"" rel=""noreferrer"">He said <code>Polaris</code> was a Pentuple star system</a>.</p>

<p>Now, I am not saying <code>Phil</code> is doing anything wrong. I am actually a fan of him, enjoyed reading the books he authored. He may have said one or the other by mistake. I tried asking him this question, it does not look like there is an effective way to submit him an Errata or ask him questions like these.</p>

<p>So my question is, how many stars are <code>Polaris</code> and are they all gravitationally bound to each other or some of them are just <code>Optically</code> grouped?</p>

"What's the origin and culture of funny astronomical terminology?","<p>I'm not in the industry myself, but as an interested member of the public the terminology of astronomy seems a bit funny. Astronomers who today talk publicly about the interstellar medium say that the solar system is in the ""local fluff"" inside the ""local bubble"" near a ""local chimney"". Cosmology uses a term like ""the dark ages"" to describe an era in the history of the phenomena they study. But geologists instead prefer to use terms like ""cenozoic"" to name a period. Early on, astronomers also used pompous words and names from antique languages. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Was ""Big Bang"" (coined in 1949, I think) the term which started off this fluffy bubble blob bang type of terminology? Or were there precursors?</p></li>
<li><p>Is there a connection to sci-fi literature?</p></li>

<p>Because, so far, we were unable to get a clear and nice view of a planet of the solar system planet which is not that big, but still bigger than an asteroid. So how can they tell that nothing from the immensity of the Galaxy and Universe, bigger than a few yards, will cross our path and hit us within the next 100 years? </p>

"Could this three moons system be stable?","<p>In my fictional world I have selected all parameters to maximize the Hills Sphere of my planet. The planet has three times Earth's mass and it is located in 2 AU from its star that's 1.4 times more massive than our Sun. <br/>I assume that there are more planets on the system but in such way to have minimum interaction with my planet.</p>

<p>I want to have three  moons on a 1:2:4 resonance. I also want:</p>

<ul>
<li>the first one to be as large as our moon to the sky</li>
<li>the second 1.5 times larger</li>
<li>and the third, half our moon's size.</li>
</ul>

<p>To achieve this I have assumed:</p>

<ul>
<li>the first moon having 1.1 lunar radius,</li>
<li>the second 2.3</li>
<li>and the third 1.1.</li>
</ul>

<p>Their orbits are 18, 36, 72 days.</p>

<p>I don't really care about their density and I assumed that their masses are</p>

<ul>
<li>1 lunar mass (probably rocky)</li>
<li>3 lunar mass (water or ice world)</li>
<li>0.3 lunar mass (probably ice world)</li>
</ul>

<p><br/> I guess that to be more stable i should have eccentricities smaller than 0.05 and inclination equal to zero.
<br/> I am not sure about the spin of my moons, is there a chance being tidal locked?
<br/><br/>This is my effort to achieve maximum stability of the system, what parameters should I reconsider to make it more stable? I am willing to change almost everything even the resonance, but I want them to be visible from my planet in similar way moon is to Earth.
<br/><br/>Have in mind this question is about a fictional world for a fantasy story so even the minimum possibilities for that senario to happen is enough for me.
So any ideas?</p>

"Can't pulsars and stars be used for gravitational wave measurement?","<p>Suppose that we collected photons from a distant star, and they arrive regularly at 15 photons every microsecond onto a CCD, when a gravity wave bends space time, wouldn't the regular 15 photons graph wobble as a result of the gravitational wave?</p>

<p>Why does the LISA observatory have to compare laser timings, if pulsars can be as precise as atomic clocks, can't it just compare a bunch of pulsar signals?

"Could an ejected ""extra ice-giant"" still be lurking in distant solar orbit?","<p>BACKGROUND</p>

<p>Hot Jupiters are thought to have migrated inwards, implying that another giant planet has been ejected in order to conserve the orbital momentum of those planetary systems. The number of interstellar ""vagabond planets"" has been estimated to be as many as the number of stars. And <a href=""http://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1507/1507.04654.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">simulations show</a> that if the Solar System started out with an extra gas giant next to Jupiter which was ejected, then one can end up with a very good fit with today's Solar System. </p>

<p>QUESTIONS</p>

<p><strong>Where would such a hypothetical ejected ice giant be today?</strong> Should it be closer or further away than hot Jupiter-ejected planets because it is much smaller? Could it stay in an Oort cloud type orbit during several billion years (maybe ~15 orbits around the Milky Way) without being pulled off by passing stars? At what distance could we today observe a Uranus sized planet? Should it stay in the ecliptical plane or could its orbit have become greatly inclined when it was ejected?</p>

"How could a supernova seed solar nebula?","<p>If the heavier elements such as Uranium came from a supernova, then this supernova had to sit somewhere right in the middle of the original solar nebula, because although the ejected matter traveled extremely fast by star or planet standard, it was still not fast enough to truly get across the empty space between clusters of stars. Does this mean the supernova was actually birthed and died in the same nebula or at least in the immediate vicinity in a region that is rich in hydrogen? Could the solar system be still in this nebula? What could endow the solar system as a whole with so much momentum that it acquired a different trajectory around the galaxy than its mother nebula, if the solar nebula is in effect no where to be found?</p>

"How close would merging black holes have to be to feel gravitational waves?","<p>Recently LIGO discovered gravitational waves caused by two black holes that were orbiting each other, and then collapsed into one black hole.

So my question is, <strong>how close would a black hole collision have to be for us to feel the gravitational waves pass through Earth?</strong></p>

<p>Secondly, is this even possible? As in, would the distance have to be so short that we'd get swallowed up before the black holes collided? And, if we were to feel such gravitational waves, what would they feel like?</p>

"Why is the CMB not simply travelling parallel to us?","<p>When we look to the distant farthest reaches of the universe we see light that was emitted at the big bang 14 billion years ago.  But the universe was tiny back then so that light, which is only reaching us now, was emitted pretty much right next to us (in galactic terms).</p>

<p>So it's been traveling for 14 billion years at the speed of light and is only reaching us right now, despite only having set off from right next door.</p>

<p>The standard explanation of how it's covered such a tiny distance begins with ""expansion"", which means the light has been swimming against the tide effectively and since that doesn't fit properly, it's augmented by inventing inflation which is basically a huge rush of Hubbly expansion at the outset, to increase the distance away from us before it began swimming towards us in accordance with Hubble's law which we now observe.</p>

<p>If we instead explain how it's covered such a tiny distance by saying that we are all departing the big bang at or near the speed of light because we are actually for example something like Hawking Radiation, then we don't need ""Expansion"" do we?  Because the CMB is just the light that was emitted near parallel to us and has been traveling through space next to us all this time.  So it's quite natural that it is only now reaching us.  And then we don't need to invent inflation, do we, to make Hubble's law and the Big Bang fit?</p>

<p>And since it's been traveling so close to parallel all this time it seems natural that it should have such a low level of energy - unlike light emitted right next to us recently.</p>

<p>And then we have a natural reason for mass-energy equivalence don't we, because everything's moving at the speed of light anyway.</p>

<p>And then we have a natural reason for quantum theory don't we because if everything around us is moving nearly parallel at the speed of light then only its direction can change, not its speed so we would expect to find that if we impose a speed vector on objects which only have direction, their degrees of freedom will be over-specified and we won't be able to define their parameters all at once because they don't really exist.</p>

<p>And then it becomes obvious that ""perceived speed"" is simply an aggregation of how parallel the component parts of something are, so simple objects containing minimal component parts must travel at the speed light while compound things can move more slowly because they have component parts moving in different, changing directions around each other and their overall motion is the combination of the parts.</p>

<p>And then that would predict that a photon can't age.</p>

<p>And then everything seems to make a lot more sense because when we look out at the ""Big Bang"" in distant space and see it receding at the speed of light, well that's what we know it to be doing anyway so whoopdedoo who cares.</p>

<p>And because the universe is now just a set of paths in 4-dimensional space with no ""speed"", it should be described by a rotation group SO(3,1) and oh hang on haven't I seen that somewhere before, like the set of transformations in relativity?</p>

<p>But then we would all have to be made of light.  So how do we design an experiment in which we bounce beams of appropriately formed light off each other itself at exceptionally low angles of incidence in order to prove that they do, to the surprise of almost the entire physics community, bounce off each other?</p>

<p>And how did we get in such a pickle inventing all this inflation and dark matter?</p>

"If objects don't move when the universe expands, how can the expansion result in redshift?","<p>I am approaching this topic from a layman's perspective and view this as a logic puzzle, but when someone tries to get me to accept the logic, I'm never convinced by their arguments. </p>

<p>According to the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expansion_of_the_universe"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">wiki page on the expanding universe</a>, the universe is expanding (which is how we see redshifted light from distant galaxies), however this expansion does not result in the movement of objects across space away from each other. Instead, this expansion is the formation of new space such that all of the objects in space maintain a static relationship with space. </p>

<p>This should mean, that as light produced by a distant light source that is expanding away from us, it is not moving away from the photon. The photon then travels across space, and this trip takes longer as a result of the expansion, but once the photon is in space near to Earth, the earth is not moving away from the light. By the time the light is at the same distance from the telescope as a flashlight held in front of the telescope, the telescope is not moving away from the photon any more than it is moving away from the photon produced by the flashlight. </p>

<p>So, IF the expansion is not the result of motion across space, HOW do we show redshift?????? </p>

<p>Another comment, laymans perspective<br>
The whole reason it can make sense that objects far enough away can expand away from us FASTER than the speed of light (which is the reason why telescopes can't see further) is that these objects are not moving across space to achieve this expansion. </p>

<p>Another comment in reference to the Raisin Cake. 
understanding the expanding universe as a raisin cake swelling, therefore the actual cake that is in contact with any raisin stays in contact with that raisin,, the raisins do not move through the cake,,, <em>APART</em>. BUT, in space, the raisins actually ARE moving through the cake. Also, the PHOTON that travels across space from the distant light source to the telescope, travels across space. additionally, it's NOT useful to think of this transaction of energy in a raisin cake, because the raisins DO travel across space away from each-other as the cake swells, but this is NOT how we can possibly understand objects in space expanding away from us on Earth faster than the speed of light. </p>

"What is the shape (along the plane, not up-down) of stellar orbits in flat spiral galaxies","<p>What I mean is, with a central mass orbits are relatively simple, but orbits around the galaxy are different, in essence as the star orbits through the dark matter halo, the further it moves away from the center of the galaxy the greater the gravitational field, so while orbits tend to slow down as kinetic energy is turned into potential energy, stars are effectively orbiting around more mass the further they are from the center of the galaxy, which might speed them up. The equal areas over equal time rule would seem to no longer apply.</p>

<p>So, ignoring up and down motion relative to the plane of the galaxy, is there a common shape for galactic orbits? Is there a formula? I think eccentricity would still apply, but I don't think the orbits would be ellipses, so it would be a different kind of eccentricity. Would these orbits tend to circularize (in an ideal dark matter cloud, ignoring perturbations. Obviously perturbations would lead to, in a practical sense, unpredictable orbits, not neat and tidy formulas. I gather from a show I caught on the science channel that the Milky Way's magnetic field also plays a role in forming its spiral arms, but I'm asking in an ideal, mathematical sense, what shape would orbits be through a galaxy, from a 2D point of view, ignoring up and down motion.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>It occurred to me that the question might be more simply asked by a black hole in effect ""orbiting"" through a planet or even a low-velocity neutrino (if there are any low-velocity neutrinos). The inside a planet orbit is quite different than the Kepler orbit, because gravity increases as the object moves further away from the center. The overall orbit might still be somewhat like an ellipse but the laws for such an orbit would be different, you would see the highest acceleration at the furthest points from the center though you'd probably still see the highest velocity at the closest point to the center.</p>

<p>Anyway, I'm mostly just curious if those shape has been worked out and what it looks like.</p>

"Is time taken into account by astronomers when creating and using maps of the universe?","<p>There's really two questions I'm asking.</p>

<p>Firstly, when maps are produced of stars and galaxies, are they just produced as we see them now from our viewpoint? Or are they based on the motion of those bodies? Eg Galaxy X is 1 million light years away and we know it's moving at Y speed, so it's real position now is actually 1 million years worth of movement along that trajectory.</p>

<p>Secondly, are those things taken into account when doing other studies of things like dark matter? Ie things are actually further apart than what we see because we're seeing them as they were Z million years ago. I would expect that would affect calculations for things like how much 'missing' matter there was.</p>

<p>To try to further clarify this second question, simplifying things to 3 points on a triangle... if we're at A and we observe points B and C which are X billion light years apart, then the effect of gravity on the speed of B and C moving apart would have been greater in the past when they were closer together and furthermore the effects of the current gravitational force will take more than X billion years to reach the other object. As far as I understand, dark matter is a way to account for observed gravitational effects that can't be accounted for in other ways. When astronomers do these calculations, can I assume that they have taken into account the time delay in the effects of gravity between galaxies? Or have I in my naivety, stumbled on some profound insight! (I doubt it.)</p>

<p>Early radio telescopes were actually not much more than a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directional_antenna"" rel=""nofollow"">Directional Antenna</a> pointing up, connected to a sensitive receiver with various filters, maybe an <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate_frequency"" rel=""nofollow"">IF stage</a> or two, but no demodulation. You measured the ""noise"" signal strength as a function of time on a chart recorder - pen and ink. </p>

<p>I think there were radio images generated and published <em>well before</em> there were high granularity interferometers and computational correlators. The early ones were contour plots, on 2D plotters - again pen and ink.</p>

<p><em>How was this done? How did, say, a single dish antenna with a single feed generate radio maps</em>?</p>

<p><strong>edit:</strong> It doesn't necessarily have to be a dish antenna - it's the <em>single receiver</em> part I'm interested in.</p>

"Why would atmospheric absorption increase rather than decrease the antenna temperature in Penzias and Wilson's famous CMB observation?","<p>The classic paper <a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1965ApJ...142..419P"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">A MEASUREMENT OF EXCESS ANTENNA TEMPERATURE AT 4080 Mc/s</a> begins:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Measurements of the effective zenith noise temperature of the 20-foot horn-reflector antenna (Crawford, Hogg, and Hunt 1961) at the Crawford Hill Laboratory, Holmdel, New Jersey, at 4080 Mc/s have yielded a value about 3.5° K higher than expected. This excess temperature is, within the limits of our observations, isotropic, unpolarized, and free from seasonal variations (July, 1964-April, 1965). A possible explanation for the observed excess noise temperature is the one given by Dicke, Peebles, Roll, and Wilkinson (1965) in a companion letter in this issue. </p>
  
  <p><strong>The total antenna temperature measured at the zenith is 6.7° K of which 2.3° K is due to atmospheric absorption.</strong> The calculated contribution due to ohmic losses in the antenna and back-lobe response is 0.9° K.</p>

"What is a radio ""homology telescope"" and is the 500m dish in China one?","<p>This question is about design aspects of large radio telescope dishes which allow them to flex under the influence of gravity as they change elevation angle, and still maintain good optical performance at short wavelengths - on the order of a centimeter or less.</p>

<p><em>What is a radio ""homology telescope"" and is the 500m dish in China one?</em></p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>

<p>I was reading about radio astronomy for background on <a href=""https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/q/16238/7982"">this</a> and <a href=""https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/q/16237/7982"">this</a> question. In this <a href=""http://www.cv.nrao.edu/course/astr534/RadioTelescopes.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">informative and entertaining</a> NRAO page I saw the term <em>homology telescope</em> for the first time, so I immediately select-right-click-serched it. At first I was confused by these Mathematics Stackexchange and Stanford Bio-X links:</p>

<p>until I realizes that these quit different <em>usages</em> of homology and/or telescope :)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>7.5 The Practical Design of Parabolic Reflectors</p>
  
  <p>7.5.1 General Considerations</p>
  
  <p>Measurements of the mechanical properties of an antenna are of importance for its performance. This is especially true if the antenna deforms homologously. By <em>Homology</em> it is meant that, at various elevations, the main reflector deforms from one paraboloid into another. Today, homology is an intrinsic part of the design of all symmetric reflectors.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Later in the same subsection:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The design of an offset paraboloid has, however, complications. Since the design has less symmetry homology is more difficult to achieve and therefore active, real time adjustments of the surface are needed if the design limit of 7 mm or perhaps 3mm wavelength is to be reached. This will be accomplished by an actuator system controlled in real time by a laser measuring system. But for longer wavelengths, the GBT will not require active surface adjustment (Fig. 7.10).</p>

<p>Here is a screen capture of Figure 7.10 from <a href=""https://books.google.com.tw/books?id=DoDBBAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA191&amp;ots=vRxGPaU7AH&amp;dq=homology%20telescope&amp;pg=PA188#v=onepage&amp;q=homology&amp;f=false"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">google</a></p>

<p><strong>note:</strong> There are a number of nice photos and some discussion of the Green Bank Telescope and discussion of it's homology (homologusness?) on the <a href=""http://www.cv.nrao.edu/course/astr534/RadioTelescopes.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">NRAO page</a> where I started, as well.</p>

<p><strong>So here is the question-cluster</strong> that I'm currently stuck on.</p>

<p>1) If off-axis telescopes require active mechanical adjustments to maintain a homologous paraboloid figure, do the on-axis telescopes mentioned do it passively - <em>by mechanical design</em> alone? They naturally droop - <em>by design</em> - differently at different elevations (different angles above the horizon) in order to retain a paraboloid figure?</p>

<p>2) For the passive design, is it a) <em>the same</em> paraboloid but just a different section, b) or another paraboloid with the same focal point, or c) has a different focal point and therefore requires axial movement of the secondary mirror or feeds?</p>

<p>3) is the nearly-completed 500m dish in China (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_hundred_meter_Aperture_Spherical_Telescope"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">FAST</a>) a <em>homology telescope</em>? I know it has a lot of articulation and works off axis, but the word <em>spherical</em> is in the name and the receiver/feed translates laterally. <em>Is it still using the principle of homology</em>, but in a different way?   </p>

<p>I wanted to measure the pixel diameter of Jupiter. As evident, the image is quite blurry, and thus, many value of equally justified pixel diameters can be obtained. To eliminate this I posterised the image (which is technically, quote from Gimp, ""designed to intelligently weigh the pixel colors of the selection or active layer and reduce the number of colors while maintaining a semblance of the original image characteristics""):</p>

<p>With the above result, I obtained three pixel diameters of Jupiter (one from each of the coloured circles), and with a little bit of calculation, realised that the yellow circle gave rise to the most accurate value of Jupiter's diameter (which was surprisingly off by less than one percent!). </p>

<p><strong>My questions are:</strong></p>

<p><strong>1)</strong> Why is my original image like that? Is it due to some form of light scattering?</p>

<p><strong>2)</strong> Is there a better method of obtaining an accurate pixel diameter than posterising the image</p>

<p><strong>3)</strong> Is the posterised result expected? Are there names that can be given to the three distinct spherical objects (which seem to resemble shadows, like the umbra, prenunbra, antumbra, etc.)? Is there a reason why the middle posterised object gives the most accurate value?</p>

Here's what I've been able to deduce so far:</p>

<p>$$
pitch_{CMB} = 160.4\,GHz \approx D_{33} = 157.7\,GHz
\\
pitch_{CMB}\,lowered\,by\,30\,octaves = {160.4\, GHz \over 2^{30}} = 149.38\, Hz \approx D_3 = 146.83\,Hz
$$</p>

<p>Building on this result:</p>

<ul><li>How much time will need to elapse before the CMB redshift will cause this pitch to drop by an octave (or even by a semitone)?</li>
<li>How much variability would this pitch have depending on the dipole anisotropy of the CMB from our perspective as well as due to more generalized anisotropies in the CMB?</li>
<li>What pitch would the peak value of this blackbody have had at earlier points in the history of the Universe?</li>

<p><strong>Assuming no cost to placing such an observatory wherever we want around the sun, what would be the optimal orbit for optimal rate of science gains?</strong></p>

<p>I apologise if this seems a big vague, let me elaborate.</p>

<p>If you imagine placing it in a smaller orbit, the parallax of distant stars (already very small) will be made even smaller. But information about the parallax will be returned quicker. </p>

<p>If you place the observatory in the orbit of Uranus, you'll have a much greater parallax and will be able to measure the distances of distant stars with much greater precision. However, it will take 80 years to complete an orbit, and the rate of distance measuring would be intolerably slow.</p>

<p>Intuitively, I feel like there is some obvious sweet spot that would produce measurements at an acceptable rate, though I also feel like my objective function here is ill-defined.</p>

<p>Would a highly eccentric orbit be preferred to a circular one? Would a particular orbit optimise the 'science gains' for one particular aspect at the expense of others (such as accuracy of nearby stars traded for accuracy of distant stars, or accuracy of stellar proper motion)? If there are multiple objectives to optimise, what would  the tradeoffs be?</p>

"How massive can a cold solid object be?","<p>I understand that a neutron star is dense enough that adding more matter will increase the amount of degenerate matter directly, and the limit to its size is about 1.4 solar masses.</p>

"How do tip tilt mirrors correct distortion in adaptive optics?","<p>I'm currently trying to learn about how adaptive optics correct the blurriness caused by atmospherical seeing effects. This is my current understanding of how adaptive optics works (trying to offer some context, I have a very limited understanding at the moment). </p>

<p>Wavefronts from celestial bodies become distorted as they pass through the Earth's atmosphere due to variations in refraction indices as they pass through different density air, temperature variations and so on. This distortion as far as I know, causes the wavefront to look squiggly instead of being straight parallel lines. Once the light reaches the telescope, it is reflected off a tip tilt mirror, then reflected off a deformable mirror, then a beam splitter splits the light rays and one half is passed through a computer sampling device which detects distortions in the wavefront. This is done up to a 1000 times per second, and somehow the computer causes actuators fitted at the back of the deformable mirror to move such that the reflected light off the deformable mirror is now undistorted (i.e. the wavefronts are a straight line, not squiggly). Thus adaptive optics fixes the distortion issue. </p>

<p>I have a few questions arising from my current understanding:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>What exactly does the tip tilt mirror do to help fix the distortion problem? Wiki simply says that it fixes the problem of aberration but doesn't offer a specific explanation of how. </p></li>
<li><p>Why are straight wavefronts ideal when viewing celestial bodies? As in, how does the squiggliness of the wavefronts actually make the images look blurry?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I believe I am asking too many different types of questions in one post, so I'll make a separate post for this last question, but for anyone reading this:</p>

<p>I keep reading that increasing the size of the primary mirror will improve resolution. I have seen justification of this using Dawe's limit such as</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>By considering the formula R= 2.1*10^5*wavelength/ D, where R is the minimum angular separation required by two point sources for them to be resolved, so as primary mirror diameter increases, D increases, so R decreases meaning that resolution of the telescope is improved.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don't really see how they can apply the R=... formula to primary mirrors because I have only seen it derived in the context of light diffracting when it passes through a small slit, and not mirrors (which don't allow light to pass through, but rather reflects it). Can someone explain to me why we can apply this formula to mirrors as well? </p>

For some reason, when I try to use Transform3DGroup to do my rotations in order to basically draw out where the satellite is supposed to go in ECI (using the orbit elements I gave above) my result is not matching up with the ECI coordinates that the original algorithm is spitting out.</p>

<p>That original algorithm is my truth data. But I don't want to use those coordinates, I want to draw the orbit myself with the Keplarian elements using Transform3DGroup.</p>

<p>Here is my code:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>public Point3D calculatePosition(double trueAnomaly)
{
    double angle = trueAnomaly;
    double a = semiMajorAxis;
    double e = eccentricity;
    double b = (a * (1 - e * e)) / (1 + e * Math.Cos(angle));
    double SA = Math.Sin(angle);
    double X = b * CA;//(CA * CR + SA * CI * SR); 
    double Y = b * SA; //(CA * SR + SA * CI);
    double Z = 0; //b * SA * SI;
    Point3D p = new Point3D(X, Y, Z);//new Point3D(Math.Cos(angle) * b, 
    Math.Sin(angle) * b, 0);
    return p;
}
public void orient2OrbitalElements(double _time)
{
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>    orbitNorm = new Vector3D(0, 0, 1);
    positionPoint = calculatePosition(trueAnomaly);//Position of Orbiter
    Transform3DGroup tg = new Transform3DGroup();
    tg.Children.Add(new TranslateTransform3D(positionVec));//Translates to Orbit Position (relative to Parent)
    tg.Children.Add(new RotateTransform3D(new AxisAngleRotation3D(new Vector3D(1, 0, 0), inclinationDeg)));//Rotates Orbit to the set Inclination
    tg.Children.Add(new RotateTransform3D(new AxisAngleRotation3D(new Vector3D(0, 0, 1), RAAN)));//Rotates Orbiter's model RAAN
    orbitNorm = tgNoTranslation(tg).Transform(orbitNorm);
    tg.Children.Add(new RotateTransform3D(new AxisAngleRotation3D(orbitNorm, argOfPerigee)));//Rotates Orbiter's model to the Arg of Perigee
    Transform = tg;
    if (HasEphem)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(ObjectName + "": "" + Transform.Value.OffsetX + "", "" + Transform.Value.OffsetY + "", "" + Transform.Value.OffsetZ);
        Console.WriteLine(ObjectName + "": "" + cartesElems.xPos[ephemIndex] + "", "" + cartesElems.yPos[ephemIndex] + "", "" + cartesElems.zPos[ephemIndex]);
    }
}
public Transform3DGroup tgNoTranslation(Transform3DGroup tgWithTranslations)
{
    Transform3DGroup tempTg = tgWithTranslations.Clone();
    tempTg.Children.RemoveAt(0);
    return tempTg;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Basically I calculate an x,y position on the orbital plane w.r.t the Earth position using the basic eccentricity, semi-major axis, true anomaly formula as you'll see. Then I put the resulting coordinates into my Transform3DGroup as a TranslateTransform3D. This is the first object I put in. </p>

<p>Then I perform the rotations:
 --- a rotation is added for the inclination, rotating the position Vec about 
     the unit x axis (1,0,0)
 --- a rotation for the RAAN, about the unit z-axis(0,0,1)
 --- then I create the orbit normal from that and perform a argPer rotation 
     about that new axis</p>

<p>My understanding of how Transform3DGroup works is that it will apply the first one, then the second, and so on. Which means that the positionVec (which is just x, y coordinates in the reference frame of the 2d orbital plane) gets performed, then the rotations will all be performed as a rotation matrix on was is left after what was done before it. </p>

<p>Am I performing the argPer rotation incorrectly? RAAN or inc? Perhaps there is a more exact way to calculate my position in my orbital plane or a particular order of operations I must adhere to? </p>

<p>The more I think about it, the more I keep arriving at the thought that everything seems to be very simple if I use the Transform3DGroup and that I should be doing it right at this point, yet the ECI results don't line up.</p>

<p>But lo and behold, the Transform.Value.OffsetX/Y/Z does want to come close to agreeing with the truth data. Perhaps Transform.Value.Offset is not the X,Y,Z as I am thinking of it?</p>

"When did the Moon stop?","<p>According to various theories the Moon was created around 4.5 billion years ago. About all of these theories suggest that it was rotating around its axis at that time though. Currently, Moon is at tidal lock with Earth, despite some monthly ""wiggling"" a flat zero on the long-term rotation speed relative to it.</p>

<p>I wanted to ask when did that stop occur - relative to Moon's age, how long was the period of rotating Moon?</p>

<p>The answer would shed some light on my other question - <a href=""https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/questions/1850/why-are-most-lunar-maria-on-the-visible-side"">Why are most lunar maria on the visible side?</a> as Earth tends to catch or deflect many bodies heading for Moon surface from ""our"" direction - still, there is no erosion on the Moon, so craters once formed are extremely slow to vanish - if that period was relatively long, Earth's ""protection"" wouldn't explain the maria, as rotating Moon would get 'cratered' uniformly all over its surface.</p>

"Do white dwarfs lose mass as they fade to black dwarfs? Is there a correlation between temperature, mass, and radius?","<p>I'm having a difficult time understanding certain behaviors of white dwarfs.</p>

<p>I understand how mass is lost in the red giant to white dwarf transition process. I understand that white dwarfs can accumulate mass from a partner binary or some other source and I'm aware of the 1.4 M☉ Chandrasekhar limit. I get that they're not losing all their mass; in general they're just cooling and in the end there will be a lone black chunk of crystallized material floating forever in the void. I know they are really insanely hot when formed and very cold after an unfathomable amount of time. But is it that same, initial mass, or does it somehow diminish?</p>

<p>But is that initial mass the mass the remnant has after its cooled to a black dwarf? I guess what I'm asking is that <strong>I'm trying to figure out if there is a correlation between temperature, mass and radius.</strong> Some sort of equation?</p>

"Do meteorites streak across the sky in the same direction?","<p>Once while camping with my family as a child we all watched a meteor shower in the summer (in the month of August).</p>

<p>All the meteorites streaked across the sky in the same direction.</p>

<p>Obviously, this was the result of the Earth passing thru a group of meteors but I've always wondered.</p>

<p>Do meteorites always streak in the same direction? While I know it's not likely to be exactly the same direction, but generally speaking. Would one say meteorites always travel for example: <code>east to west</code>?</p>

<p>I thought this was a plausible fact since the Earth is travelling around the Sun in a constant direction, and additionally it's always rotating in the same direction.</p>

<p>While meteorites can travel in all directions. Does the Earth's gravity pull them straight down towards the surface resulting in the streak to be always in the same direction.</p>

<p>In this part of the image, without knowing a lot about meteorite taxonomy but a little bit about error bars, the image alone doesn't convince me of much at all by itself. There are good mathematical techniques to try to find clustering in data, and probably some methodologies to apply to calculate the probability that the clustering is likely to arise by random chance or is likely to be ""real"" (which is just another way to say - albeit loosely - not likely to arise by random chance).</p>

"What does a black dwarf look like?","<p>A black dwarf is a hypothetical object that is the end result of the cooling of a white dwarf. None yet exist, because there hasn't been enough time in the age of the universe for them to cool down sufficiently. The oldest known white dwarfs are at ~3800 K and would glow orange. It will take many billions of years before any are cool enough (~750 K I believe) to not emit light visible to the naked eye.</p>

<p>So, what would a black dwarf look like? I'm assuming it is illuminated by some other source of light such as a star. </p>

<p>The question could be rephrased: What is the visible absorption (and emission) spectrum of electron degenerate matter?</p>

<p><strong>This is my attempt at an answer</strong>: Probably not black. A lot would depend on whether electron-degenerate matter behaves as metallic or dielectric, based on its band-structure. My guess would be metallic, considering the electrons are dissociated from their parent nuclei in electron-degenerate matter.</p>

<p>Because the surface gravity of a black dwarf would be so strong, I'd expect the surface to be very smooth and relatively free of Lambertian scattering. </p>

<p>From these two features, I'd make a tentative prediction that a black dwarf would appear as a mirror-like sphere. </p>

"Is Earth's 1g solid surface gravity unusually high for exoplanets?","<p>The surface gravities of the Sun’s planets are all close to 1g, 0.38-2.53 (about a factor of e, by chance). The cloud-top gravity of the gas giants is not too interesting here, but I suppose that the gravity on their solid surfaces (if any) does not tend to be higher. So called super-Earth exoplanets seem likely to generally accumulate light gas atmospheres, which decreases their expected solid surface gravity relative to their size as measured during for example transits (I suppose so anyway).</p>

"Question from Introduction to Modern Cosmology by Andrew Liddle","<p>The exact question goes like this:
In the real Universe the expansion is not completely uniform. Rather, galaxies exhibit
some random motion relative to the overall Hubble expansion, known as their
peculiar velocity and caused by the gravitational pull of their near neighbours. Supposing
that a typical (e.g. root mean square) galaxy peculiar velocity is 600 km s-1,
how far away would a galaxy have to be before it could be used to determine the
Hubble constant to ten per cent accuracy, supposing</p>

<p>(a) The true value of the Hubble constant is 100 km s-1 Mpc-1?</p>

<p>(b) The true value of the Hubble constant is 50 km s-1 Mpc-1</p>

<p>Assume in your calculation that the galaxy distance and redshift could be measured
exactly. Unfortunately, that is not true of real observations.</p>

<p>I started off by writing the hubbles equation and as they mentioned it should be accurate to 10% so its peculiar velocity (given as about 600 km/s) is less than or equal to 10% of its expansion velocity. But this gives me different answer.</p>

<p>The actual answer to the problem as stated in the book is
<em>Slightly different answers are possible depending how you deal with the rms velocity.
You should get something like r > 35 Mpc for H0 = 100km s-1 and r > 70Mpc
for Ho = 50kms-1</em></p>

<p>However, for a long time, I was curious about <strong>why</strong> stars below the supernova threshold—like our own Sun—become Red Giants.</p>

<hr>

<p>From documentaries, I have been instructed that (for stars below the supernova threshold), when the star’s core’s fusion cannot continue…fusion ceases, and the star begins to collapse under gravity.  </p>

<p>As gravity crushes the star, I understand that the star heats up as gravity crushes it.  As a result, although the stellar core remains “dead” (no fusion occurs), a “shell” of gas around the stellar core becomes hot enough to begin fusing helium.  Since the fusion occurs as a “shell” around the stellar core, the outward-push from the fusion is what pushes the star’s outer layers further.  The result is that the star grows into a Red Giant.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>My question is this:</strong>  Why does fusion cease in the core?!  It seems to me that as gravity crushes the star, stellar fusion would reignite in the core itself—not in a sphere around the core.  Why does the stellar core remain “dead” while its “shell” begins fusion???</p>

"Black dwarf binary systems","<p>I know black dwarf stars do not exist yet, and that they are what white dwarfs end up after a long time. The question is really simple: would it be possible to have a binary system in which one of the two is a black dwarf, and the other companion star is dumping mass on the black dwarf, causing the black dwarf to supernova? I guess based on the timescales, the maximal initial mass of the second object could be calculated to see if it is possible that one object is at the black dwarf stage and the other still a giant. Or is the timescale on which the star goes from white dwarf to black dwarf big enough that it will never reach the black dwarf stage while the other one is still an AGB star? </p>

<p>Second part: If not possible that one is black dwarf and the other AGB star, is it possible if the companion is a brown dwarf, that they are close binary, and that a brown dwarf would dump mass on a black dwarf? This would need the binary system to be a very close binary system at this stage of the system. </p>

<p>Third part of the question: would the spectrum of the supernova be any different from the normal one with a white dwarf and a companion AGB star? I guess the spectral lines would be different, since the companion would have to be a very low-mass AGB star, since that companion would be about 20billion years or so, when the black dwarf star becomes a black dwarf.</p>

"Do narrow lines in the spectra of O- and B- type stars always indicate magnetic fields?","<p>I was reading <a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2005ApJ...627..953W"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">a paper</a> on the differential emission measures of a set of hot O- and B- type stars. As the authors discuss in Section 3 (page 959), two stars, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tau_Scorpii"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">$\tau$ Sco</a> and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theta1_Orionis_C"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">$\theta^1$ Ori C</a>, have narrow emission lines compared to other stars of the same spectral type. There is a good amount of evidence that both stars are young and have magnetic fields; the stellar winds travel along the field lines and collide at the magnetic equator, producing shocks and, indirectly, X-ray emission. This is in contrast to the mechanism behind shock formation in other O- and B- type stars, where shocks come from the line instability transition.</p>

<p>Now, the plasma at the magnetic equator is roughly stationary because of the collision; this means - if I'm interpreting things correctly - that there is little to no broadening of the lines, and so they are comparatively narrow. Other spectral characteristics and observations support this model.</p>

<p>I'm wondering two things:</p>

<ul>
<li>Has the presence of such comparatively narrow lines in the spectra of O- and B- type stars been observed in cases where there is no magnetic field present? Very few O-type stars have significant magnetic fields, and theory predicts that none should, so these stars are the few exceptions to the rule.</li>
<li>If so, are there other mechanisms that could be responsible for this in cases without magnetic fields? I'm grasping at straws for ideas, like low collisional broadening.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>I talked with my advisor, and we briefly discussed colliding wind shocks (CWS), which form at the interface between the stellar winds in a binary system. It's thought that these shocks contribute only a small amount to the total X-ray production of the system (see <a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011ApJS..194....5G"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Gagné et al. (2011)</a>), though, so any narrow lines produced in that plasma - if any exist - wouldn't have much influence over the measured spectra. So that seems to be ruled out.</p>

"need data-point: actual counts per second with APD (avalanche photodiode) detector","<p>I'm designing a sensor system to perform specialized [astronomy and space-sciences] experiments, and need a ""reality check"" to support or adjust my theoretical calculations.</p>

<p>What I need is the ""counts per second"" produced by any modern APD (avalanche photo-diode) sensor through a telescope of any specific ""aperture"" of a star of any ""visual magnitude"".  I also need the number of ""counts per second"" of ""nothing"" (the ""dark count"") to subtract that from the ""counts per second"" when illuminated by the star (to determine the ""counts per second"" generated by the star alone).</p>

<p>This ""reality check"" will help me assure various ""inefficiency allowances"" I made are realistic.  Examples:</p>

<pre><code>#1: overall detector QE over relevant visual [and near IR] wavelengths.
#2: loss of light in atmosphere before entering telescope.
#3: loss of light in telescope optics.
#4: loss of light in fiber (if any).
#5: anything/everything else.
</code></pre>

<p>As implied, I am only interested in the APD operating in ""photon counting mode"" (not analog).</p>

<p>I've read about 5 dozen articles that discuss APDs for astronomy, but none give a straightforward value.  The closest I found was a vague statement that the limited magnitude was 22nd magnitude on a 6-meter telescope based upon observations of the crab nebula pulsar.  But this is not specific and the object is highly variable (on a short time frame).  They did not say, for example, whether they consider their ""limiting magnitude"" is where the count rate rises from 200 per second (dark count) to 220 per second (measurement), or 200cps to 400cps, or over what time period, or any other indication of their definition.</p>

<p>All I need is ONE clear statement of cps for any aperture and visual magnitude star.  You'd think I could find that in dozens if not hundreds of articles, but... no.  Probably a clear statement like I need exists in some article somewhere, but I haven't seen one.  Have you?  Or better yet, have you made such an observation yourself?</p>

<p>The following detail is not very important (but just to be complete), my primary applications perform fairly high time-resolution measures on fairly bright stars.  In other words, the experiments generally need to measure in the range of ""counts per microsecond"" to ""counts per millisecond"".  Typically APDs max out at around 15 to 50 million counts per second, and most of my experiments will be working at 10K to 10M counts per second to observe the short time-period phenomenon I need to measure.</p>

"What's the profound reason(s) why the star formation rate drives the scatter of the mass-metallicity relation in galaxies?","<p>Since decades it's well known that a correlation between stellar mass and metallicity (Z; both stellar and gas-phase Z, but here I focus on the gas-phase Z) exists (e.g., Tremonti+04; analysis of >53000 galaxies from SDSS).
More recent results have shown that the scatter of this ""mass-Z"" relation is mainly driven by the star formation rate (SFR; e.g., Mannucci+10), i.e., at a fixed stellar mass, galaxies with higher SFRs have lower Z. This happen systematically over a wide range of stellar masses.<br>
What's the physical mechanism(s) responsible for that?</p>

<p>Also, even more recently (e.g., Bothwell+16) it has been shown that the ""real"" driver of the ""mass-Z"" relation's scatter is the molecular gas mass (the previously found dependence on SFR may be only a by-product of the Schmidt-Kennicutt relation between gas and SFR).

"Why Earthian atmosphere is so thin?","<p>Venus is somewhat lighter then Earth, yet has a much thicker atmosphere. One would imagine that the following should be true:</p>

<li>During the formation phase, all inner planets had captured as much gas as they could hold per gravitational/thermodynamic equilibrium. After all, even puny Mars managed to capture a sizable atmosphere.</li>
<li>The rate of atmospheric escape should be much higher for Venus:

<li>Venus receives more heat from the sun, thus higher Jeans escape rate</li>
<li>Venus has negligible magnetic field, so some of its atmosphere must be lost to direct ""blow-off"" by solar wind</li>

<p>I was doing this last night because it was cloudless and ok seeing, and whenever I point the scope at a given patch of sky I always see a much larger amount of objects (obviously) but how many of these additional dots are galaxies and how many are just nearby red dwarfs or average but more distant stars in the milky way?</p>

<p>Do galaxies ever appear as points of light similar to faint stars, or are they always more diffuse like Andromeda is through binoculars or my telescope? To be clear here, I'm not talking about the galaxies in our local group that are close enough to be discernable as actually fuzzy objects, but rather more distant galaxies that might be very bright (i.e. large elliptical galaxies). I feel as though I'm answering my own question here and that galaxies are only seen as diffuse objects and not points of light, but I can't think of a good way to test this hypothesis with my equipment.</p>

<p>Assume ideal conditions (low light pollution, perfect seeing, etc.) although I am also curious to know how much this changes if the light pollution conditions worsen, particularly in my backyard. For reference, I can somewhat make out the milky way on a cloudless, moonless night. Andromeda is not visible without small binoculars on any night here (or it is and my eyes just aren't trained enough to find it without them).</p>

"What exactly is the ""paradox"" in Olber's Paradox?","<p>To the extent of my understanding, Olber’s paradox states that if the universe was static and homogeneous, we should see a star at every point in the night sky and therefore the night sky should be equally as bright as day.</p>

<p>However, since the night sky is dark and non-uniform, it can be said that the universe is <em>not</em> static and <em>not</em> homogeneous. However, if this was already known, what exactly is the “paradox”? Why isn’t it called Olber’s Observation or something else?</p>

"What mechanism causes oscillations of the solar system's orbit about the galactic plane?","<p>In a <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.0576"" rel=""noreferrer"">recent paper</a> (<a href=""http://www.nature.com/news/did-dark-matter-kill-the-dinosaurs-1.14839"" rel=""noreferrer"">news release here</a>) Lisa Randall and Matthew Reece propose that a dark matter disk coinciding with the galactic plane together with the solar system's oscillations through the galactic plane could explain the 35 million year periodicity in mass extinctions.  They propose that the solar system passes through this dark matter disk in the galactic plane every 35 million years, disrupting bodies in the Oort cloud and causing some of them to collide with Earth.  An image of the proposed cycles from the news release is below.</p>

<p>My question is: What mechanism is responsible for this 35 million year oscillation about the galactic plane?  Is there a companion body to the sun? Are we orbiting around one of the arms of our galaxy?  Is this a well known phenomenon or are they proposing the 35 million year oscillation as well as the dark matter disk?</p>

Surely the black hole is not a 2D thing so we can ""look into it from above"" (I use that term loosely as obviously there are no directions in space!), so why are we able to actually see the blackness?</p>

<p>The only thing I can think of is that a black hole, much like our solar system has some sort of ecliptic, that the vast majority of matter is orbiting, and everywhere else just doesn't have enough matter for the light to be visible, kind of like why we are unable to see the Oort cloud. </p>

<p>I hope that made sense, and I could be way off, but it is the only thing I could think of to explain it. If it is the case, then would we be able to get a similar image of Sagittarius A, seeing as we could be in this ""ecliptic"" of it, so surely we would only be able to see the heated matter around the event horizon and not the blackness?</p>

"Why does the axial tilt & the rotation speed of Saturn & Jupiter vary so much?","<p>I have seen Jupiter and its 4 largest moons in a telescope, several times. The moons are always aligned in a line. This is fine. Very interesting. But.. in case of Saturn, not only that we can see its ring, moons are not aligned in a line.

I have visited english wikipedia and found out that it is true - and that the difference is about 23°.</p>

<p>Why is it so?</p>

<p>I am not a physicist. I do not even study astrophysics, but I wonder why the difference is so big. I came to another conclusion that the rotation speed may play a huge role here. The faster an object is spinning, the smaller axial tilt. And according to wikipedia, there is a difference and it seems that it fits in my theory.</p>

<p>So. I did my research, but now I am not sure if that´s all and if it´s right. I mean, maybe there is another factor that I forgot to count-in. I know that, according to scientists, Jupiter formed before Saturn. Does it mean that the difference in formation answer my question to why the axial tilt &amp; the rotation speed vary so much?

<p>The answer is generally no, different ""images"" are associated with substantially different time delays.</p>

"Why not us interferometry to take a picture of Pluto?","<p>Interferometry is among the best ways (if not, the best way!) to have an image of a very distant object.</p>

It is the result of several data collected by the Event Horizon Telescope, a series of arrays all across our world, working as one like a giant Earth sized telescope. The picture is not really cutting edge and high definition however it is still very surprising and in a way detailed enough, considering the fact that M87 is 53.49 million light years away... and this is where I arrive to Pluto which is just around 6 to 7 billion kilometers from us.</p>

<p>If we used an interferometer, perhaps the same size as the EHT (or just a smaller one, the size of an entire continent), and point all the arrays at Pluto, then we should have a picture with a resolution that is at least higher as the Hubble Space Telescope, but likely not as high as the pictures from the New Horizons spacecraft which directly made a fly by of Pluto... right?</p>

"Equations of motion for Earth and Moon","<p>One of the simplest versions of Newton's equations of motion for the Sun, Earth and Moon can be obtained by making the approximation that the three bodies are perfect spheres. In this approximation, the pair potential between body i and j is  $$\frac{-G m_i m_j}{ r_{ij}},$$ where $r_{ij}$ is the distance between the bodies: one can solve the equations numerically and get the orbits. </p>

<p>This simple model does not include multiple, additional factors, such as </p>

<ul>
<li>the fact that the Earth is not perfectly spherical (equatorial bulge),</li>
<li>Earth's tides,</li>
<li>the influence of other celestial bodies,</li>
</ul>

<p>and others.</p>

<p>Amongst all these factors, what is the dominant one as for predicting the orbit of the Earth? In other words, what is the leading factor that should be included in the simple model above in order make its predictions for the Earth's orbit closer to the observations? </p>

<p>It will be impossible to find it against the dark sky if not for the companion bright slice. What I see basically fills the round, just is smaller as compared to the bright part.</p>

"Might someone see changes to the corona during a solar eclipse?","<p>I've seen many pictures of the corona during a solar eclipse, and the structure and delicacy is amazing. Clearly, the appearance would change over time, depending on the fine details of the solar wind and the structure of the mass shed from the solar surface. I wonder, though: might the appearance, to the unaided eye, change during a single eclipse?</p>

<p>This could actually be treated as two questions (all example durations and times taken from the August 2017 eclipse):</p>

<p>a) Might the corona's appearance visibly change during totality at a single location (a maximum of 2 minutes 40 seconds)?</p>

<p>b) Might the corona's appearance visibly change between the first Earth-wide totality (16:48 UTC, when the Moon's shadow touches down in the Pacific) and the last Earth-wide totality (20:02 UTC, when the Moon's shadow last leaves the Atlantic)?</p>

<p>Searching for solar wind velocities yields a broad range of values, but $400km/s$ seems to be a common value. With the solar diameter being about $1{,}400{,}000km$, that's about a solar diameter per hour, which suggests there will be no visible change at a single location, but there certainly could be changes when viewed across the entire 3+ hours of totality.</p>

"Why does the darkening of the Moon go from left-to-right during an eclipse?","<p>In anticipation of the upcoming <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_2014_lunar_eclipse"">April 2014 lunar eclipse</a>, I decided to use the 3D virtual planetarium software <a href=""http://www.stellarium.org/"">Stellarium</a> to simulate what it is supposed look like where I live, since I've never actually witnessed an actual eclipse before. I set the clock to begin at the moonrise before the beginning of the event and to tick at a rate of a few virtual-minutes per real-second, pressed play, and waited for the eclipse to begin. When it did, I saw something I did not expect. To be honest, I realized my expectations were embarrassingly naïve.</p>

<p>I watched the Moon rise in the east and begin its upward left-to-right path across the night sky, towards its zenith in the south. My expectation was that the moment the Moon enters Earth's shadow which marks the beginning of the eclipse would be visually apparent by the darkening of the full moon's outer limb on the right side, and the darkening would progress from right to left from there. When I saw that the darkening actually progresses in the opposite direction, I immediately realized that my understanding of the geometry and kinematics of the Earth-Moon-Sun system must be much shallower than I would have thought.</p>

<p>My main question is must lunar eclipses happen this way every time, and if so why? My gut is now telling me that it does, so I'm mostly interested in an answer of reasonable depth to the 'why' part of the question.</p>

<p>Additionally, it occurs to me that the observation of left-to-right progression of darkening of the Moon's face during a lunar eclipse is especially counter-intuitive from the point of views of ancient geocentric cosmologies based on a stationary Earth that doesn't rotate. Can this observation be taken as empirical evidence that the Earth rotates? (I could be completely off base here. If so, please correct me.)</p>

<p>In order to replicate (or even peer review) a paper, obviously one must have access to specifics such as the actual calculations, the raw data, the software, the blue prints of the measurement equipment and logs of how it has been operated.</p>

<p><strong>What data do peer reviewers and replicating scientists (and the public) have access to beyond a paper making some claims?</strong></p>

<p>Two examples: The results of the infamous cold fusion press conference of 1990 could never be satisfactorly replicated. But were the attempts based only on the paper they then published, or did they publish on the side also a wealth of data about their procedures? And the more recent ""neutrinos travel faster than light"" media debacle was, as far as I know, all about the details of equipment, was all relevant information about it made public (for the science community)?</p>

"What is the extent of the ""worldwide campaign"" to observe near-earth object 2012 TC4?","<p>This <a href=""https://space.stackexchange.com/a/22601/12102"">nifty answer</a> describes and provides links to the data of the recovery of near earth object 2012 TC4, and the answer also shows the first actual image of the body for this pass. At apparent magnitude +27 (at about 52 million km) it may be the faintest asteroid to have been imaged to date. It's worth visiting that answer first before reading on here.</p>

<p><a href=""https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/22596/#comment64062_22601"">This comment</a> points out that 2012 TC4 appears on the <a href=""https://echo.jpl.nasa.gov/asteroids/goldstone_asteroid_schedule.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Goldstone Asteroid Schedule</a>, a list of upcoming planned observations of asteroids by antennas at the <a href=""https://deepspace.jpl.nasa.gov/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Deep Space Network</a>. Here are the entries for 2012 TC4 in the <code>Upcoming Observations</code> and <code>Past Observations</code> tables:</p>

</code></pre>

<p>I noticed at the top of the page there is a link to the <a href=""http://www.naic.edu/~pradar/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The Arecibo asteroid radar schedule</a>, and in the fifth line of the list shown in the screen shot below, I see that for 2012 TC4 there will be what is labeled there as a ""WORLDWIDE CAMPAIGN!"" of observations. The all-caps and exclamation point are a direct quote from Arecibo's table.</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> What is the extent of the worldwide campaign to observe 2012 TC4? How many facilities? Is it coordinated? Perhaps simultaneous reception of reflected signals by multiple sites? Will it be coordinated with other observations such as infrared or optical wavelengths?</p>

<p>The plot below the Arecibo table is made from JPL Horizons data in the Earth-Moon barycenter frame. It shows +/- 24 hours from closest approach.
The hyperbola (red) is the calculated trajectory of 2012 TC4 with dots every 2 hours and the short, (roughly) circular arc is the Moon, as descried in <a href=""https://space.stackexchange.com/q/22596/12102"">this question</a>. The closest approach to Earth's center is projected to be about 51,000 km. These are preliminary calculations based on the first observation and may be refined a bit as the time of closest approach nears.</p>

"Will Gaia detect inactive neutron stars?","<p>Will the astrometric precision of the Gaia space telescope be able to detect the gravitational influence of cold old <em>solitary</em> neutron stars on the movements of stars? At least in a statistical sense to estimate how common they are around here, which could say something about how large the population III stars were.</p>

<p>And if an inactive neutron star could be precisely located thanks to its gravitational influence, would it be possible to observe it directly?</p>

"Are we moving away or towards each other?","<p>There are numerous theories about the shape of the Universe. I've read somewhere most probably in 'A Brief History of Time' that there is a possibility that the Universe is spherical. So is it possible that all galaxies are moving towards each other? Imagine the Universe as a sphere. Now, imagine a diameter AB. The Big Bang took place at A and the galaxies started drifting away and as they moved away further they stared attracting each other on the other side i.e.Gravitational attraction. So we feel that the farther galaxies are the faster they are moving away(Hubble's Law) but actually they are moving towards each other and will eventually meet at point B. Also, space-time is spherical and so light travels along the sphere.</p>

<p><strong>So, my question is: Is it possible for the universe to be spherical with galaxies apparently moving away but actually moving closer?</strong></p>

"Sidereal time calculation","<p>I am creating program in C which is derived from Javascript Solar Radiation calculator based on a book <em>Guide to HTML, JavaScript and PHP: For Scientists and Engineers</em> By David R. Brooks. The original program calculates Sidereal time like this:</p>

<pre><code>  // Sidereal time (Theta0)
  double GMST = 280.46061837+360.98564736629*( i-&gt;JulianDate-2451545.);
  // Sidereal_time = GMST + 0.000387933*T2 - T3/38710000
  double Sidereal_time = GMST+0.000387933*T*T
       -T*T*T/38710000.;
  // Performance optimalizatuion of code for Sidereal=fmod(Sidereal,360.) or Sidereal%360
  double S_save=Sidereal_time/360.;
  if (S_save &lt; 0.) Sidereal_time = Sidereal_time-ceil(S_save)*360.;
  else Sidereal_time = Sidereal_time-floor(S_save)*360.;
  if (Sidereal_time &lt; 0.) Sidereal_time+=360.;
</code></pre>

<p>Where i->JulianDate is date/time specified by user which is converted to Julian date. As you can see this approach is based on 2451545.0 which is the equivalent of <code>January 1, 2000, at 12:00:00 UT</code> and <code>36525.0</code> is Julian Year. I am not sure why there is 36525 instead <code>365.25</code> (days of Julian Year). Can you explain this?</p>

<p>Once more the same code without comments:</p>

<pre><code>  double GMST = 280.46061837+360.98564736629*( i-&gt;JulianDate-2451545.);
  double Sidereal_time = GMST+0.000387933*T*T-T*T*T/38710000.;
  double S_save=Sidereal_time/360.;
  if (S_save &lt; 0.) 
     Sidereal_time = Sidereal_time-ceil(S_save)*360.;
  else 
     Sidereal_time = Sidereal_time-floor(S_save)*360.;
  if (Sidereal_time &lt; 0.) 
     Sidereal_time+=360.;
</code></pre>

<p>Another question:</p>

<p>If I enter date older than January 1, 2000, at 12:00:00 UT, e.g. <strong>1945</strong>, will the sidereal time be correct? Or do I need to change the number <code>36525.0</code> to extend the range?</p>

<p>Yet, before the Sidereal time is calculated in the program there is this:
<code>double T=( i-&gt;JulianDate-2451545.0)/36525.0;</code> Which is similar thing.</p>

<p>Sidereal_time is used to calculate hour_angle which is used to calculate Sun's elevation and Solar Zenit Angle Z. Will this variables be affected when I type 1945 or older date in the program?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong>
I have added log to my program which printed values into file. I have tested the program for range 1990-2010. You can see that the SideReal time same as L0 (Geometric mean longitude) is negative number when the date is older than 2000/01/01 as defined in the program to calculate T. The difference of 10 years is cca 0.09999 of Julian century. </p>

"How large does refraction become in radioastronomy?","<p>For atmospheric refraction of visible light, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_refraction#Values"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikipedia gives</a> the order of 1 arc minute at 45° altitude above the horizon, and 5.3 arc minutes at 10°. This is caused by the dielectric polarizability of all of the bound electrons in all the atoms of the atmosphere.</p>

<p>At the much lower HF frequencies of radio, the free electrons and ions will contribute, and some forms of radio communication have relied on refraction at large incident angles to deflect terrestrial signals back to the Earth at a distant ground station.</p>

<p>So I expect that at the lower frequencies used in radio astronomy, corrections to the observed location of radio sources due to ionospheric refraction could be much larger than those at visible wavelengths, but I am not sure.</p>

<p>How large does can this effect ever get? At what frequency? Are there ever corrections as large as 1 degree? </p>

"If Venus and Mars changed places, would we then have 3 habitable planets?","<p>This is the supposition:
Venus is too hot, Mars is too cold. If they switched places then Solar energy would change to make both more Earth like. We might as well have had three instead of just one ""Earth"" in the Solar system, if the roulette of early planet formation had played out just a little bit different.</p>

<p>That's of course too simple. But wouldn't it help alot if it were the case from the beginning that Venus had had Mars' mass, and Mars had had Venus' mass? Or do other factors dominate mass and distance from the Sun?</p>

<p>Would Venus still have had a thick, but not too thick, atmosphere if it were at 1.5 AU, because it has mass enough to keep one, and wouldn't that have kept it warmer than Mars is today? Including flowing water on its surface under its atmospheric pressure?</p>

<p>Would a Mars at 0.7 AU have been warmer and maybe have had a passing atmosphere created from melting volatiles during a longer era in its history?</p>

"When did ""resilvering"" large telescope mirrors actually refer to aluminization, and why was it necessary?","<p><a href=""https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/a/16548/7982"">This answer</a> nicely summarizes the general picture of historical use of silver for mid to large size telescope mirrors, and the shift to aluminum once good quality vacuum pumps and chambers suitable for this process were available. A freshly evaporated, atomically clean aluminum surface will can sometimes violently react with oxygen, so this has to be done under high vacuum, and vented carefully with inert gas first.</p>

<p>When did the term ""resilvering"" generally start to actually refer to aluminum coating, and not silver? Was that actually the case by the 1960's or 1970's? </p>

<p>From what I remember, evaporated aluminum will form a protective oxide layer (""native oxide"") of the order of 10A thick within seconds or minutes that is self limiting - no further oxygen can penetrate this layer. </p>

<p>If this is so, why was re-silvering actually necessary? The cost, risk, and downtime associated with removing the primary and other mirrors every few years sounds like something you wouldn't do unless absolutely necessary.</p>

"How exactly does inflation convert random gravity fluctuations into coherent gravitational waves?","<p>In the course of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iasqtm1prlI"">this</a> very enjoyable press announcement, it is mentioned that inflation can create gravity waves by amplifying gravity fluctuations.</p>

<p>I do not properly understand this statement. I always thought that quantum fluctuations (fluctuation of the metric in this case?) should occur pretty randomly whereas waves are rather coherent motions.</p>

<p>So I understand somehow that inflation can amplify quantum fluctuations, but I don't see how it can convert these random ""microscopic"" processes into ""macroscopically"" observable coherent phenomena called gravitational waves.
For example, how are the sources of these gravitational waves distributed? Does each point in space-time behave as some kind of a point source? And what is observed at a specific point as the superposition of all these excitations?</p>

<p>In addition, in the same video it is said that not all inflation models produce gravitational waves, the ones that have them are favoured by the data now, etc.</p>

Due to dark matter the stars have velocities which are nearly the same unregardless their radius of orbit around the centre of the Milky Way. Also, it takes about 200 million years to orbit this centre. But nevertheless the angle from which we look at those stars could change a bit during this orbit.
Regarding all these effects, could you say that constellations don't change at all or does it just take a long while?  And of course stars could run out of energy and explode and vanish, so that we don't see them anymore. But is this the only way the constellations could change?</p>

"Retrofitting a DSLR camera to a super-cheap Tasco reflector telescope","<p>I was given a 1995 vintage Tasco ""302003"" <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newtonian_telescope"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Newtonian</a> telescope recently and have had some exciting success with it.  I have managed to view the Moon in beautiful detail and also had my first glimpse of Jupiter (with <s>Enceladus</s> Ganymede &amp; Europa in the same shot!).</p>

<p>I was able (with very considerable difficulty) to photograph both Moon and Jupiter scenes by holding my camera up to the eyepiece.  Far from ideal but it has really fired my imagination about doing more astronomical photography.</p>

<p>Here's a picture of my telescope and it's accessories.  Despite spending the last 15 years in the back room of a charity shop, it's in brand new condition and all the parts are present including the tripod and all fixings!...</p>

(Blue arrows indicate places where eyepiece lenses can be inserted).</p>

<p>My camera is a Nikon D40 (APS-C format, DX lens ring system).</p>

<p>Is it possible to modify this telescope's eyepiece (a rack-and-pinion tube-length adjustable type) so that I can attach my camera in order to take photographs of astronomical subjects?  Photographs of the Moon would be my primary goal.</p>

<p>I am happy to make severe modifications to the telescope if necessary.  But I realise that certain measurements would be absolutely critical to making good photographs possible.  I think I can make an adaptor that goes between the eyepiece socket and the camera.  But I don't know all of the parameters I will have to know to design such an adaptor.</p>

<p>Problems I believe I need to solve...</p>

<ul>
<li>I think that holding the camera's central axis perfectly concentric with the eyepiece's axis is critical.</li>
<li>I need some sort of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relay_lens"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Relay Lens</a> between the secondary mirror and the camera body.</li>
<li>Keeping the rack-and-pinion tube adjustment (actually a fairly sturdy mechanism) is important and would allow better focusing of the picture as the camera is not likely to have enough auto-focus range to cope with the 700mm F length.</li>
</ul>

<p>I do have a small Milling machine and most of the basic machine tools.  I have a ready supply of aluminium stock and industrial plastic stock (RG1000) that I can build an adaptor from.</p>

<h2>Is this project feasible?</h2>

<p>I'm not looking for perfect photos, but rather something that is better and more convenient than holding my cellphone camera close to the eyepiece and holding my breath! :)</p>

<p>My astronomy/optics knowledge is practically zero but I'm a fairly savvy mechanical engineer and can build things to a specification.</p>

"Rule of Exception in All Nearest Objects","<p>I once heard of a strange phenomenon, but now cannot find anything about it on the Internet.  I might be looking for the wrong keywords or misremember some relevant aspect.  So maybe someone here can help me out and point me in the right direction.</p>

<p>The described phenomenon goes like this, as I remember it:</p>

<p>During the course of the scientific research, people found out more and more about the objects surrounding us.  Moon, Sun, planets, other stars, other galaxies, etc.  But each time (more or less) a little later (after a new discovery was getting an established fact) it showed that the closest object of this kind to Earth was rather an exception among its peers.  For instance, the closest other galaxy is blue-shifted.  Or that the closest Pulsar is somehow an exception among its peers.</p>

<p>It might be that the rule was not about the <em>closest</em> but about the <em>first found</em> object of a kind.</p>

<p>I think I remember Prof Harald Lesch (a German physicist lecturing on TV in a popular format called ""Alpha Centauri"") mentioning this peculiar phenomenon and fleshing it out with some examples, but now I'm not able to find the clip.</p>

<p>I understand the point about closing this question, but maybe leave it open for some weeks (or months), just in case somebody drops by who has something to contribute.  After a grace period the non-reaction can be counted as a vote for ""isn't common knowledge"".  Without such a grace period closing the question can only be based on ""I don't know such a thing"" (which should not be enough).</p>

Then I thought of the earth: Surely there are some years when we are aligned with Jupiter so much so that it would exert some sort of perceptible influence on the planet, thus lengthening the year, even if only by some hours or days, considering that the sun is much more massive. And what would happen every few thousand (?) million (?) years when all the planets and even some of the larger asteroids, Kuiper Belt Objects - everything but the kitchen sink - come into alignment? Wouldn't the earth be drawn outwards to some extent, thus making a year perhaps 370 days long (or whatever)? And maybe temperatures would drop with the planet a fraction of an AU farther from the sun?

"Do primary mirrors in large observatories undergo regular removal and re-coating of the aluminum? Why?","<p>Performance of astronomical mirrors that are exposed to the environment for long periods of time can experience a slow degradation of performance. They usually need to receive some kind of regular maintenance, which may involve cleaning and/or re-coating. </p>

<p>While <a href=""https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/q/16583/7982"">I'm told that</a> the aluminum degrades and must be replaced from time to time, this is not consistent with my understanding of the behavior of aluminum in air. I'm pretty sure that a freshly evaporated layer of pure aluminum will quickly develop a native oxide layer of perhaps 20Å of aluminum oxide as amorphous $\text{Al}_2 \text{O}_3$ (alumina) which is then pretty much impermeable to diffusion of anything else the atmosphere might expose it to, including various pollutants.</p>

<p>I can understand that it might in some cases ultimately be simpler to strip and replace the aluminum after a number of cleanings <em>due to accumulated damage from the cleaning</em>, but is there any evidence that the aluminum must be replaced due to chemical degradation of the aluminum itself?</p>

<p>I found this article, <a href=""http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu//full/1997PASP..109..303M/0000303.000.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>Reflectivity Degradation Rates of Aluminum Coatings at the CFHT</em>, Magrath, B. 1997, Pub. Ast. Soc. Pac. <strong>109</strong>, 303</a> that seems to show that - at least at one observatory location - a representative test mirror exposed to the observing environment (in the dome) that was washed once a month showed no significant degradation in reflectivity over 32 months, similarly to a mirror that remained protected but not cleaned.</p>

<p>However, the test mirror that was exposed and not washed showed a continuous loss in reflectivity, dropping by about 10% over the same period. A fourth test mirror undergoing regular $\text{CO}_2$ cleaning lost about 5% reflectivity.</p>

<p>This is a small, limited test of course, less than three years, only one location, one wavelength, and only one parameter (reflectivity). But it gives a bit of support to the idea that <em>while mirrors get dirty and require regular cleaning, the aluminum itself may not actually deteriorate.</em></p>

<p><strong>So I'm asking:</strong> <em>Do primary mirrors in large observatories undergo regular removal and re-coating of the aluminum? Why?</em>, where ""why"" addresses the specific need for the removal and replacement. If these primaries actually do receive regular re-coatings of aluminum, is it because the aluminum actually degrades?</p>

<p>I'm looking for an answer that carries some backup references. If just for example, your answer is of the form <em>You silly goose, everybody knows aluminum tarnishes like the Dickens!</em>, please back it up with a reference to measurements of aluminum tarnishing. Thanks! </p>

"Layout of the universe","<p>I've been working on a space game in my spare time, and lately I've been thinking on how to lay out the universe.

I did find a lot of good sources, though I'm a very visual learner and found it hard to get a good picture of the universe with what I found. I also don't know what the good, reliable, accurate and up-to-date sources were.</p>

<p>So, are there any good visual sources to get a picture of the universe? Preferably a TV-series or a very well illustrated book, or perhaps even computer program.</p>

<p>Edit: I'm looking for a more general view of the universe. Like what do galaxies look like, and what is their scale. As I understand they contain a combination of planets, solar systems, star clusters, ... Though I couldn't get a good picture of how dense they are. Is there a lot of space (relatively) between these solar systems and star-clusters. I found that our solar system is about 4 light-hours big, though are the neighbouring ones average light years or thousands of light-years away? And in the space between them, is it mostly empty or is there space dust?
The same question for whatever our galaxy circles around (if it does) and what is between different galaxies. (And perhaps what else is there of galaxy-size out there?)</p>

<p>I got a vague view of all of this from reading texts, though I feel like I'm missing a whole lot.</p>

"Icy moons: why hasn't the ice sublimated away?","<p>Let's take <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europa_(moon)"" rel=""noreferrer"">Europa</a> for example:<br />
The predominant model suggests that heat from tidal flexing causes the ocean to remain liquid and drives ice movement similar to plate tectonics.</p>

<p>The heat generated from the tidal flexing has to go somewhere. Is it all carried away by the water vapor plumes we recently detected? Is more water from the ice cover melting away? Is it just radiated away?</p>

<p><strong>I would expect it to cause sublimation as well</strong>: There is hardly an atmosphere (<a href=""https://phys.org/news/2015-09-jupiter-moon-europa.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">molecular oxygen at 0.1 micro Pascals, or 10<sup>-12</sup> times that of the Earth</a>), and a tenuous ionosphere.<br />
And that same article suggest that the surface ice is <em>also</em> broken down by radiation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>the oxygen [...] is formed through the process of radiolysis, where ultraviolet radiation from the Jovian magnetosphere collides with the icy surface, splitting water into oxygen and hydrogen. The same radiation also creates collisional ejections of these products from the surface, and the balance of these two processes forms an atmosphere.</p>
  
  <p>The hydrogen, meanwhile, lack the mass needed to be retained as part of the atmosphere and most is lost to space. This escaped hydrogen, along with portions of atomic and molecular oxygen that are ejected, forms a gas torus in the vicinity of Europa's orbit around Jupiter.</p>

"Is there some upper limit in the moon size distribution?","<p>The planets range hugely in sizes, Jupiter is more than 300 times as massive as Earth. But the sizes of the large moons seem to be uncorrelated with the sizes of the planets they orbit. Why doesn't Jupiter have a giant moon with a mass hundreds times larger than the Earth's Moon's?</p>

<p>Among gas giants, Saturn at a third of Jupiter's mass has the largest of all moons and Triton way out at 30 AU Neptune is the 7th largest of all moons. The theories of the origin of the moons seem to vary much too, without explaining any upper size limit. The Moon was formed by an impact. Triton and maybe Titan were captured.

  <p>Astronomers believe that a shower this visible won't grace the sky for another 96 years. The Perseid meteor shower, one of the brighter light shows of the year, occurs annually between July 17 and August 24. The shower tends to peak around August 9-13.</p>

<p>To give you an example, on the second episode they state that there are massive black holes at the center of galaxies. From my perspective (i.e. of someone which is not an astronomer) if they say so it's because it's probably true. However, in the real world <em>maybe</em> this is a highly disputed theory and a lot of astronomers disagree with this stance, and they're note telling the audience about it. Why would they do that?

"Did the Moon ever approximate a geosynchronous orbit above the early Earth?","<p>Simulations suggest the early Moon formed about 20,000 to 30,000 km away from Earth which is less than the current geosynchronous orbit of 42,164 km.  The Moon is now 384,000 km away from Earth.  Does that mean the moon approximated a geosynchronous orbit for a time on its journey outward to its current orbit?

"How can I tell if my solar glasses are up to ISO standards?","<p>Like many, we bought solar glasses to view the eclipse, and are now in a strange place where we can't tell if they're safe or not.  The big fuss seems to be about ISO 12312-2 compliance.  Apparently there are some glasses which are claiming to be certified and putting the logo in the glasses when they are, in fact, not up to spec.</p>

<p>Now the only ""solution"" that has been given is to buy from one of the ""reputable"" vendors <a href=""https://eclipse.aas.org/resources/solar-filters"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">documented by the AAS</a>.  Many smaller vendors are crying foul, saying the big guys are just trying to push out competition.</p>

<p>So my question is this: if I had a pair of glasses, what would be the <em>proper</em> way of determining if they met ISO 12312-2 standards?  Is there supposed to be a way for a customer to trace their purchase back and verify that the company that made them at least has their paperwork in order? (A company that has their paperwork and is still counterfeiting anyway is a different challenge).</p>

<p>Obviously the astronomy community is interested in ensuring their products are safe.  How were they supposed to do that in the ideal circumstances?  If I can't confirm their certification as a small-time buyer, how would a large-scale buyer of, say, 100,000 glasses or viewers determine that the product they are buying is genuine <em>before</em> someone burns their eyeballs?  Surely when there are hundreds of thousands of dollars on the line, there would be a process to demonstrate compliance.</p>

<p>EDIT: I am specifically looking for how one is supposed to verify these glasses without relying on a whitelist provided by a single group such as the AAS (other than perhaps the ISO community itself).  Surely there is a way to verify claims of ISO compliance without relying on the good intentions of a professional society.  Otherwise, what is the point of having certifications in the first place?</p>

"attractors of Mercury's spin-orbit relation","<p>Mercury rotates at such a rate that the Sun appears to stand nearly still at perihelion, when the tide is strongest.</p>

<p>Is there a mechanism that tends to adjust the orbital eccentricity to improve the match – minimize the tidal torque (integrated over time), or some such?</p>

<p>If so, might there be other stable combinations of eccentricity and rotation coupling, other than the obvious 1:1?</p>

<p>EDIT: I'll rephrase, since most of you seem to think my question was something elementary like “how does Mercury rotate?” or “what the heck is tidal locking anyway?”.  I suppose it's not a bad heuristic to assume that the newcomer is completely ignorant, but I wish that assumption didn't override a literal reading of the question.</p>

<p>Each planet's orbital eccentricity varies over time.  Mercury's is now suspiciously near to what it would need to be for the sun to stand exactly still at perihelion.</p>

<p>So it's conceivable that in the dawn of time Mercury orbited at some arbitrary eccentricity and rotated at roughly 3/2, then resonance brought the rotation rate to exactly 3/2, and then something adjusted the eccentricity so that Mercury's long axis – the line of the lumps on which the tidal torque acts – tracks the sun more closely around perihelion.  (I wouldn't expect a perfect match at perihelion, because though tide is strongest then it doesn't vanish at other times!)</p>

<p>If that adjustment effect does happen, how does it work?</p>

<p>And if that happened for 3/2, could it also happen for other resonances, say 2/1 or 5/4?  For an odd denominator (other than 1) does the effect, whatever it is, behave differently (unless Mercury has a weird shape)?</p>

"Do the ""schwarzschild metric"" or the ""isotropic metric"" fit the Event Horizon telescope data on Messier 87 better?","<p>The ""Schwarzschild solution"" in ""Schwarzschild metric"" looks like:</p>

<p>Using this metric you get certain values for the radius of the ""Schwarzschild radius"", the ""photon sphere"" and the ""least stable circular orbit"", among other things. When the Jet Propulsion Laboratory or other institutions are dealing with orbital dynamics in the solar system, they instead use the ""isotropic metric"" or at least a first order expansion of the isotropic metric to calculate relativistic effects on the orbits. Now the Schwarzschild solution in isotropic coordinates looks like:</p>

<p><span class=""math-container"">$$ -c^2d\tau^2 = -\left(\frac{1-GM/2rc^2}{1+GM/2rc^2}\right)^2c^2dt^2 +(1+GM/2rc^2)^4[dr^2 +r^2( d\theta^2 +\sin^2\theta d\phi^2)]$$</span></p>

<p>Now in isotropic coordinates the ""Schwarzschild radius"", the ""photon sphere"", the ""least stable circular orbit"" among other things take other values. </p>

<p><strong>Question 1</strong>: Now that we have the measurements from the ""Event Horizon Telescope"" on the black hole, can something be said about what coordinates that fits the data better?</p>

<p><strong>Question 2</strong>: It might be that both metrics fit the data equally well if we change the mass of the central black hole. Do we get different values on the mass of the central black hole if we fit the data using the isotropic coordinates instead of the Schwarzschild coordinates?</p>

<hr>

<p>According to the Schwarzschild solution in Schwarzschild coordinates the photon sphere is located at an ""r-parameter"" of <span class=""math-container"">$3GM/c^2$</span>. According to <a href=""https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/a/30409/26403"">this post</a> when using the Schwarzschild solution in Schwarzschild coordinates the apparent radius (<span class=""math-container"">$r_{obs}$</span>) of something residing in a spherically symmetric gravitational potential when viewed from infinity is: <span class=""math-container"">$$r_{obs}=r(1-\frac{2GM}{rc^2})^{-0.5} $$</span>
According to this formula we will observe the photon sphere at a radial distance of <span class=""math-container"">$r_{obs}=3\sqrt{3}GM/c^2$</span>. Now I assume astronomers estimate the  ""observed radial distance"", ""<span class=""math-container"">$r_{obs}$</span>"" from the center of the M87 black hole to the photon sphere around the M87 black hole by measuring the angular size of the observed ring together with some estimate of the distance from earth to M87. If you use the formula for the photon sphere radius in Schwarzschild coordinates together with the formula for gravitational lensing enlargement you end up with a formula for the central mass of M87 as: <span class=""math-container"">$M=\frac{r_{obs}c^2}{{G3\sqrt{3}}}$</span>.</p>

<p>Now if isotropic coordinates are used instead you will get another expression for the ""r-parameter"" of the photon sphere (I do not know what that expression looks like) and another expression for the ""gravitational lensing enlargement effect"" that makes objects in a spherically symmetric gravitational field look larger when observed from infinity.</p>

<p>What i specifically would like to know in the second question above is how much the mass of the central body will ""change"" if you keep <span class=""math-container"">$r_{obs}$</span> constant but you use isotropic coordinates instead of Schwarzschild coordinates and in both cases equate the ""r-coordinate"" with radial distance.</p>

<hr>

"If a black hole does not emit light, how can one take a picture of the black hole itself?","<p>There's some discussion that the image composed by the Event Horizons Telescope is <em>really</em> just an accretion disk. To ""take an image"" of something, you need the light reflecting off of the surface of the object within frame. The ""light"" in the image is really just color-mapped gases within the accretion disc. Since black holes do not allow light to escape, is this actually an image of a black hole?</p>

<p>The analogy I've heard is that it would be like taking a picture of an object in a completely dark room, showing someone the photograph taken, and saying, ""Hey look at this picture I took of this object."" The other person could ask, ""Where is the object in this entirely black photo?"" to which the other person might respond, ""It's somewhere in the picture."" </p>

<p>Was a picture of the object really taken if you can't even see it? If you photograph the sky, have you ""captured an image of air molecules?""</p>

"Telescope in Sun's gravity lens focus - pointing, gain, distortions","<p>A telescope located in the gravitational focus of the Sun can use the Sun as a magnifying lens. The focus begins 550 AU away, but maybe a 700 or 1000 AU distance is needed to get rid of disturbances from the Corona, and the focus extends practically indefinately. Here are some slides by Dr. Maccone who has promoted this idea he calls FOCAL:
<a href=""http://www.spaceroutes.com/astrocon/AstroconVTalks/Maccone-AstroconV.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://www.spaceroutes.com/astrocon/AstroconVTalks/Maccone-AstroconV.pdf</a></p>

<p>I intend to ask about the technical design and feasibility of such a project in the Space Exploration SE. Here I rather ask about the scientific value and challenges.</p>

<p>POINTING: The magnification would occur only in the exact direction of the Sun. But since the Sun moves and the background objects magnified move, I suppose that the observed targets would change continuously. Would it even be practically possible to give the telescope a trajectory which keeps it aiming at for example Alpha Centauri? Would there most of the time be nothing in the right direction as the line between the telescope and the Sun sweeps across space, or would there alway be some star or galaxy in sight? Like CMB if nothing else.</p>

<p>GAIN: In the slides linked above, Maccone has calculated the expected gain to 114 dB for infrared wavelengths. How many times ""magnification"" does this mean? I don't think I understand the units here, I get a ridiculously large number. Can it be explained somewhat intuitively? Would a FOCAL mission be a unique revolution in astronomy, or could similar results be achieved by building an interferometer with interplanetary sized baselines here nearer to the Sun? How does the science value of a gravity lens compare to that of a wide baseline? Are they good for different tasks?</p>

<p>DISTORTIONS: Could the lensed signals be reconstructed thanks to our knowledge of the Sun and measurements of corona activity? If pointed towards a central part of the Milky Way, wouldn't signals come from multiple objects at the same time, some much further away than others? Would the gravity lens of the Sun have bigger problems with distortion than the intergalactic gravity lenses we know of today?</p>

<p>And finally, can any natural strong lensing inside the Milky Way be used today, for example using a globular cluster as a lens?</p>

I understand the general design &amp; use of reflectors &amp; refractors, but I don't know enough to decipher focal length, etc. So, I don't feel comfortable trying to DIY my own contraption, that won't be nearly as good, assuming it works at all.</p>

<p>I'm looking to buy a minor telescope (a few hundred dollars [US] or less) to view the American Total Solar eclipse on Aug. 21, 2017; and possibly reuse for the Mercury transit in 2019. I'm a decently well off computer programmer, so blowing $200 (&amp; some gas to drive up-state) for a one off just to experience the Solar eclipse is worth it to me, even if I don't use it again.</p>

It has a built-in (i.e. non-removable) solar filter, &amp; a collapsible tripod.

"Does the Giant Impact Hypothesis explain how the Moon circularized its orbit?","<p>I just read most of Wikipedia's <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant-impact_hypothesis"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">article on the Giant Impact Hypothesis</a>. Basically a large object impacts Earth and creates debris that soon coalesces into the Moon.</p>

<p>But there is something I did not find mentioned: <strong>How would the Moon get its circular orbit?</strong></p>

<p>A debris field from any impact would at first follow a very elliptical orbit, with a perigee very close to the surface of the Earth and an apogee much farther away. In orbital mechanics, where you start is where you end up. In fact it doesn't even have to be where you start. Pick any point in the orbit and you will return there again. In other words, the original elliptical orbit doesn't change its shape.</p>

<p>...Unless there are pertubations or impacts that change your velocity. How exactly did that happen? Does the GIH just assume something else did that fortuitously?</p>

<p>I've also seen youtube video simulations like <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn5vh7hZ2o0"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this</a>. It's hard to tell if the camera angle is changing or if the orbital plane is unstable (how?), but you can clearly see the debris goes around and impacts the surface again and again. I.e., <strong>the orbit remains highly elliptical. I've never seen a simulation that shows the debris circularizing.</strong></p>

<p>I also want to note that this question is highly relavent not just to the Moon, but many other things like orbital capture as well. I've never understood orbital capture theories as they all seem to leave out how the initial elliptical orbit later becomes circular, e.g., Triton.</p>

While looking to see if anyone has confirmed our universe having a 4th spatial dimension (or some non temporal or spatial dimension) due to the fact that space curves, for me curvature requires a higher dimension (paper bending or a stick bending, always +1 to its dimension), I was met with the explanation that this ""curvature"" was intrinsic and not extrinsic (requiring another dimension). That was fine and all until I realized that wormholes would be exclusively extrinsic, how could you make a wormhole if bending space is intrinsic? Obviously you can't. But Einstein  put a lot of time into something that apparently wouldn't work, so personally I am siding with Einstein here. But that still leaves the question; Are wormholes possible thus making our universe a 3+1+1 dimensional universe (I wouldn't group it up with the 3 because that would say that matter could move like that, it can't) or are wormholes impossible and so our universe remains 3+1 dimensional?</p>

<li><p>Are there any other factors besides mass and possibly metal abundance (composition) that would determine this ""turn on"" point ?</p></li>
<li><p>If the ""brown dwarf"" was detected indirectly and no spectroscopic information was available, could we assume that metalicity would be the same as the larger star ?</p></li>

I also wanted to know if I could assume that both ""stars"" in a binary system should have the same metallicity.</p>

"Generating random galaxy catalogs for correlation functions","<p>The galaxy correlation function, when computed directly from a galaxy catalog, relies on computing a randomly generated counterpart catalog.</p>

<p>When dealing with a simulated galaxy mock-catalog, where the sample of galaxies is roughly uniform over a large box (e.g. the galaxy mocks created from Millennium/Millennium II), the random catalog can be just be a uniform distribution of points in the same volume as the real data.</p>

<p>However, real-world galaxy catalogs are not homogenous boxes, and have very irregular shapes and observationally induced redshift and angular distributions. Even some mock-catalogs are endowed with these properties to better represent real data. In these cases, how is a random catalog best produced? With some sort of probability distribution in coordinates which attempts to mimic the ""non-physical"" (i.e. not due to observational constraints) part of the distribution? Or a simple binary mask which filters out empty regions, but otherwise leaves the random catalog uniform.</p>

<p>If the answer is that some nonuniform distribution should be used, is there a usual method for doing so? The literature I have found (e.g. for the SDSS published data, and for galaxy mocks mimicking SDSS's constraints) does not discuss this in any way. Note, if this is a highly involved process beyond a brief summary and a source or two, I do not expect a full answer here.

If it was infinite then it would not be expanding because it would already reach out to infinity. I hope it is clear what it is that I am trying to say ?</p>

"What is the condition for the number density of a gas to be ultra-relativistic or non-relativistic and degenerate or ideal","<p>What is the condition for the number density ($n$) of a gas to be <strong>ultra-relativistic or non-relativistic</strong> and <strong>degenerate or ideal</strong>?</p>

<p>I found problems in this subject when I was reading about White-Dwarfs. </p>

<p>A book said $n \gg n_{QUR}$ or $n \ll n_{QUR}$ is the condition for being degenerate or ideal (classical), respectively. And $n_{QUR} = 8 \pi (kT/hc)^3$. Is this condition right? I know where $n_{QUR}$ comes from but I don't know what it really shows.</p>

<p>In that book it is said that $n \ll (mc/h)^3$ is the condition for being ultra-relativistic for a degenerate gas and $kT\gg mc^2$ is the condition for being ultra-relativistic for an ideal gas. Where do these equations come from? What is $mc/h$ ?</p>

<p>In another way, my question is mainly about this diagram and about how we can get the lines in this diagram.

<p>Although photons could be scattered, photons at other places could be scattered to our line our sight. Surely the total number of photons does not drop the further out you go? So while photons originally headed in the direction of an observer are possibly absorbed and re-emitted in a direction away from the observer, surely this will be made up for by a photon being emitted from another location in the direction of the observer? Otherwise wouldn't there be a location somewhere else where a bunch of extra scattered photons can be observed? </p>

<p>If we integrate all the photons at the lower surface of the photosphere A and integrated all the photons at the upper surface of the chromosphere C, surely there are the same number of photons? Otherwise, where have they gone? Where is the lost energy?</p>

<p>Are there less photons emitted from the surface C because some have been emitted back down into the Sun? But that has to reach an equilibrium, or there would be a cascading increase in the number of photons inside the sun.</p>

"Angular Diameter Distance","<p>The definition of the angular diameter distance is the ratio of an object's physical transverse size to its angular size. However when I was reading my textbook, <em>Astrophysics in a Nutshell by Dan Maoz pp.220-221</em>, I am having some trouble trying to understand the notion of <strong>angular diameter distance to the last scattering surface</strong>. The text calculates the angular diameter distance to the last scattering surface $D_A$:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Consider flat cosmology (k=0) with no cosmological constant. We wish to calculate the angular size on the sky, as it appears today of a region of physical size
  $$D_s=\frac{2ct_{rec}}{\sqrt{3}}=140 kpc$$ from which light was emitted at time $t_{rec}$. Between recombination and the present time, the Universal expansion is matter-dominated, with $R\propto t^{2/3}$ for this model
  $$\frac{R}{R_0}=\left( \frac{t}{t_0} \right)^{2/3} = \frac{1}{1+z}$$
  and hence we can write
  $$D_s=\frac{2ct_0}{\sqrt{3}}(1+z_{rec})^{-3/2}$$
  The angle subtended by the region equals its size, divided by its distance to us at the
  <strong>time of emission</strong> (since that is when the angle between rays emanating from two
  sides of the region was set).  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm not sure what does the last line actually mean..Can someone please elaborate more on this? I just simply take the $D_s$ as the ""physical transverse size"".</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As we are concerned with observed angles, the type
  of distance we are interested in is the distance which, when squared and multiplied
  by 4π, will give the area of the sphere centered on us and passing through the
  said region. If the comoving radial coordinate of the surface of last scattering is r, the required distance is <strong>currently</strong> just $r\times R_0$ and is called the proper motion distance. The proper motion distance can be solved using null geodesic in the FRW metric
  $$\int_{t_{rec}}^{t_0} \frac{c dt}{R(t)} = \int_{0}^{r}\frac{dr}{\sqrt{1-kr^2}}$$
  Setting k = 0, and substituting
  $$R(t)=R_0 \left( \frac{t}{t_0} \right)^{2/3}$$ and integrate
  $$rR_0=3ct_0[1-(1+z_{rec})^{-1/2}]$$   </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So I take this as the physical distance of the region from us. The next part is what confuse me:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>However, at the time of emission, the scale factor of the Universe was 1 + z times smaller. The so-called <strong>angular diameter distance</strong> to the last scattering surface is therefore
  $$D_A=\frac{rR_0}{1+z}=3ct_0[(1+z_{rec})^{-1}-(1+z_{rec})^{-3/2}]$$  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>How does a physical distance $rR_0$ comes into play in the angular diameter distance, because from its definition it is just $$D_A=\frac{\text{physical transverse size}}{\text{angular size}}$$??</p>

"Does Doppler shift affect apparent pulsar frequency?","<p>We know that redshift and blueshift is the result of the frequency of light waves reflected or emitted by an object lengthening or shortening due to the relative velocity of the observer moving away or toward the object.

<p>However, it was stated in response to <a href=""https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/4365/how-quickly-could-a-craft-find-its-location-using-only-pulsars"">a question I asked on a sister site</a> that the Doppler effect would <em>also</em> result in the apparent frequency of a pulsar's pulses being longer or shorter due to the relative velocity of the star. Given that the speed of light is constant regardless of the frame of reference (a concept I have a really hard time understanding by the way), is this correct?</p>

<p>My thinking is that it is incorrect. Using the analogy of a launcher lobbing medicine balls at me at a fixed rate, I can ""see"" the rate of launch by the frequency of when I get hit. However, if the launcher is moving away from me, the velocity of the balls lobbed at me will be slower (relative to my frame of reference), and thus will hit me with less frequency. However, if the launcher were to adjust its firing speed (i.e. speed of the ball relative to itself; frequency remains constant in this analogy) so that the balls always hit me at the same speed (thereby simulating the concept of the always-fixed speed of light), the time between them would not change.</p>

How likely is it that we have a yet undetected compact star remnant nearby, as in as close as our nearest active star? What are the odds of spotting one of them nearby?</p>

<p>How could a yet undetected one be discovered? Could one of the upcoming sky surveying telescopes catch it or would one have to rely on a rare microlensing event? How would it then be observed? Would such an exotic object, say, just one parsec away, give important insights in physics given its relativistic effects and strange composition?</p>

"Efficiently calculating power spectra from galaxy catalogs","<p>I am dealing with a problem which requires calculating either the correlation function or the power spectrum. At times, the 2-point-correlator seems the better route, at others, the PS. Right now I am having some questions about how to practically calculate a PS.</p>

<p>Here is the basic setup: I have a mock galaxy catalog. Let's say I want the PS. I could Fourier transform the 2PC, but let's say I want to avoid working with a 2PC code. So instead, I make the assumption that the galaxies trace the density field (it helps that I have the DM halo masses from the underlying simulation which produced the mock).</p>

<p>I bin the galaxy catalog, giving me a coarse-grained list of masses for each bin, $\{m_{ijk}\}$. It is trivial to turn this into a density contrast list $\{\delta_{ijk}\}$.</p>

<p>There are a couple of options now to proceed to calculating the PS. Formally, the PS is given by
$$
P(k) \sim \langle \, |\tilde \delta(\vec{k})|^2 \,\rangle
$$</p>

<p>up to some normalization, with $\tilde \delta$ being the fourier transform of $\delta(\vec{x})$, the full density contrast <em>field</em>, and the angle brackets denoting volume averaging. The seemingly natural thing to do would then be</p>

<ul>
<li>FFT my binned list $\{\delta_{ijk}\}$</li>
<li>get list of values $\{ P_{ijk} \}$</li>
<li>average this list to get the PS $\{ P_k \}$, now just a function of $k$ instead of $k$-space position.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is potentially problematic for me, as unless I bin over large scales, the memory required to store the zeros present in the array of binned values is too large. With the data I have, binning at $
\sim 10$ Mpc$/h$ spaces or greater is needed to get a managable array.</p>

<p>My solution for calculating the 2PC was to avoid calculating an array entirely, and instead performing a regrouping operation to bin the catalog. This keeps the memory usage proportional to the catalog length instead of to the binning resolution cubed. However, it effectively means I am dealing with a sparse density array, which AFAIK cannot be used directly in most existing FFT codes.</p>

<p>This leaves me with a dilemma. I can either coarse-grain my density array $\{ \delta_{ijk} \}$ even more, losing information at $\sim 1$ Mpc scales, or else I suppose I could interpolate the density, giving me a full function $\delta(\vec{x})$ that I could pass some coarser mesh into, and then pass into an FFT. The problem with interpolating is that this operation requires the (now implicit) knowledge of the empty cells in the sparse array.</p>

<p>On the other hand, one <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37127765/ifft-and-fft-for-sparse-vectors"">SO post</a> has a comment suggesting to merely calculate the Fourier integral instead of using FFT methods. I fear this would still present a problem, as this takes the time complexity from $O(n\log(n))$ to $O(n^2)$, and $n$ for me is $\sim 10^6$ or higher (becoming as high as $10^8$).</p>

<p>Am I missing something? I feel like people calculate PS and 2PC's all the time for catalogs this large, and like my attempts at solving this issue could be flawed. My precise question is, are my options just as I have laid out, or is there another way of handling this calculation I have not described?</p>

<p>So it is possible that a star (maybe not Sirius, I don't know, it's just an example) somehow explodes and creates a supernova, and if this is the case, we will see this event 8.6 years later (I assume everything is right up to this point).</p>

<p>So my question is, is it possible for me while looking at the sky on a lucky day, suddenly see the explosion of a star that happened x years ago and be the first eye witness of this event?

"Can things move faster than light inside the event horizon of a black hole?","<p>Black Holes are regions of space where things get weird <sup>[Citation Needed]</sup>. Past the event horizon of a black hole, any moving particle instantaneously experiences a gravitational acceleration towards the black hole that will cancel out it's current velocity, even light. That means that the gravity well of the black hole must be able to accelerate from -C¹ to 0 instantly². Given that fact, we can assume the gravitational acceleration of black holes is C/instant³. Given this, it stands to reason that in successive instants, the particle will be moving at speeds greater than C, because it is experiencing greater gravitational forces and continuous gravitational acceleration.</p>

<p>Does this actually make sense? Is there something I'm missing here? By this logic, it seems like anything inside of the event horizon of a black hole could and should move faster than C due to gravitational acceleration. </p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I showed this question to a friend and he questioned if the hypothetical particles that were radiating from the singularity (The photon traveling exactly away from the black hole) might be hawking radiation; that is, the gravitation acceleration of a black hole is only strong enough to curve the path of light around a non-zero radius (thus not actually stopping it, but altering it's course), and not powerful enough to decelerate light. Is this actually what hawking radiation is, or is he as confused as I am?</p>

<hr>

<p>¹ Where movement towards the singularity would be considered a positive value, movement away from the singularity is a negative value, that is, anything moving at the speed of light away from the singularity would be moving with a velocity of -C relative to the singularity.</p>

<p>² If it couldn't accelerate from -C to 0 instantly, any photon traveling exactly away from the black hole would be able to escape the event horizon.</p>

"Is a swimming pool analogy to building of black holes in the centers of galaxies valid?","<p>In our garden, we have a little pool to enjoy our 2 children. It is 3 meters in diameter and contains some 4 m³ of water.</p>

<p>For cleaning-convenience every evening I go walking some 5 or 10 rounds in the pool all in the same direction, to set up a relatively fast rotating current in the pool. As a result, all of the remaining dirt (leaves, insects and seeds) are gathered together in the middle of the pool, where they can be easily removed.</p>

<p>So the analogy to galaxies is as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>The pool represents the galaxy.     </li>
<li>The water represents the space-time? (or all we cannot see in a galaxy? Or the galaxy as a whole?)</li>

hole.</li>

As I understand, the upper (nondegenerate) layers of the star absorb the energy as they quickly expand, which leads to the stabilization of the core as thermal pressure takes over, leading to the period of helium burning.</p>

<p>I was curious as to whether this could be generalized to the onset of fusion of heavier elements later in a more massive star's life, and I came across a reference to a hypothetical silicon flash in <a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015ApJ...810...34W"" rel=""noreferrer"">Woosley &amp; Heger (2015)</a>.

<blockquote>
  <p>In stars with masses around 10 $M_\odot$ either carbon or oxygen may be ignited explosively just like helium in relatively low-mass stars; there is a <em>carbon</em> or <em>oxygen flash</em>. This is much more powerful than the helium flash, and may make the star explode as a supernova.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let's say that a star undergoes a relatively low-power carbon, oxygen, or silicon flash, and enough energy is absorbed by the outer layers such that the star does <em>not</em> undergo a supernova. Would enough energy escape the outer layers of the star so that we be able to detect the flash using optical or neutrino telescopes? Obviously, this is distance-dependent, so I'll say that the hypothetical star is within five parsecs of Earth.</p>

Of these, 24 stars have [Fe/H}>0.2 and 40 have -0.1&lt;[Fe/H]&lt;+0.2. This is a much higher percentage than the sample as a whole.

"Can mechanical angular momentum be transferred by gravity?","<p>At PSE there are a few <a href=""https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/129089/how-does-angular-momentum-transfer-between-a-planet-and-its-moon"">answers</a> that explain that since the moon is responsible for tides and tides slow down spinning, L must be transferred to the moon.</p>

<p>This implies that if earth's L were reduced by an asteroid, this would not influence the moon's orbit.</p>

<p>Can you  clarify:</p>

<ul>
<li>does the change of $\omega$ of the Earth alter the orbit of moon only when that change is attributable to the moon or in any case?</li>
<li>would there be tides if there were no moon?</li>
<li>what is the mechanism through which angular momenta can exchange magnitude? This is apparently impossible since there is no connection or, we we consider the obsolete Netwonian gravity, the connection is radial and never tangential?</li>

"How do scientists determine if a star's color is due to Doppler shift vs the star's composition vs temperature?","<p>When looking at visible light coming from, say a star, scientists can determine by the shifting of the light towards the red or the blue end of the spectrum to determine if it is moving towards or away from earth. But they can also look at the light as it falls on the visible spectrum to determine the composition of said star. How do they determine if the light landing on the red end of the spectrum, for example, means it's moving away vs the composition of the star? How do they tell the difference? </p>

<p>In addition, how is all this reconciled with the fact that a star's color is also based on it's temperature?</p>

"Could celestial coordinates be encoded into three-word combinations?","<p>I came across this cool tool which encodes geographic coordinates into 3 dictionary words - table.lamp.chair - for example. You can see their map here <a href=""https://map.what3words.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://map.what3words.com/</a>. It divides the world into a grid of 57 trillion 3mx3m squares and each one is assigned with one of these three-word addresses.
It made me curious as to whether this sort of thing could work for communicating the locations of stars.</p>

<p>It would be pretty simple to assign unique three-word addresses to stars in stellar databases. What would be even more powerful is if we could encode celestial coordinates into three-word addresses, and create an interactive ""what3words"" space map. But would this be at all useful?</p>

"The Moon drifting away from the Earth","<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_distance_(astronomy)"" rel=""nofollow"">wiki</a> says that average distance from earth increases 3.8 cm per year, can you tell how much of that is due to the <em>expansion of the universe</em>?</p>

<p>wiki also says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Through the action of tidal forces, angular momentum is slowly being
  <strong>transferred from Earth's rotation to the Moon's orbit</strong>. The result is
  that Earth's rate of spin is imperceptibly decreasing (at a rate of
  2.3 milliseconds/century),[20] and the <em>lunar orbit is gradually expanding</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Can you give some details about this process, is the orbit changing shape, eccentricity? is the average orbital speed decreasing, by what value? is the spin angular velocity increasing, by what value?</p>

<p>If I did not misunderstand it, the current view on tides says that tidal bulges exert a torque on the moon, <em>and L is tranferred to it</em>, if that is correct, that L being transferred to its spin is increasing or decreasing it? Can you clarify also how a torque on the spin can produce a change of the orbit, which only implies a change (<em>a decrease</em>, in fact) of its <em>orbital speed</em> and not of the spinning speed? Can the spin (L) influence the orbital L, and how?</p>

<p><strong>edit</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I asked specific questions, which are not asked or answered there. In particular I am asking: if as they say the tidal/equatorial bulge increases spin angular momentum, how is this transferresin its turn to the orbital angulat momentum? Or, alternatively </li>
<li>can gravity directly increase the orbital momentum of a satellite?</li>
<li>Actually the answer, besides being incomplete, may be wrong because momentum/KE is not added , but <strong>subtracted</strong> to the moon, since its orbit gets larger. There can be <strong>no transfer, since both earth and moon are slowing down</strong></li>
<li>torque is not correctly explained</li>

"Correlation of planet sizes with star sizes?","<p>I did my own amateur Kepler data analysis in May of this year of data from Kepler.nasa.gov/Mission/ discoveries. I found a strong correlation between star size and planet size (percentages). 37 of the 44 planets confirmed (84.1%) orbiting M dwarfs were less than 2.0 R(Earth) with only one hot Jupiter. 129 of 241 (53.6%) orbiting K dwarfs were less than 2.0 R(Earth) with 9 hot Jupiters (3.7%). 196 of 517 (37.9%) orbiting G dwarfs were less than 2.0 R(Earth) with 49 hot Jupiters (9.5%). 92 of 213 (43.2%) orbiting F dwarfs were less than 2.0 R(Earth) with 23 hot Jupiters (10.8%). I would like to know how much of this correlation is probably real and how much is biased by the limits of the study? Biases I am aware of are the fact that the Kepler study is primarily of systems with ""close in"" planets, (only 90 of 1015 confirmed as of 4/1/15 are over 0.3 AU) and that only 4.3% of the ""Kepler stars"" are M dwarfs. I also see biases that might arise from the methods of confirming the planets (Kepler stars from 110 to 405 had planets confirmed by the ""multiple candidate"" method). It also appears that there may be a greater difference between K and G star systems than between G and F. Where can I find a more professional analysis of this type?</p>

"First night on a telescope questions","<p>So I recently got into astronomy and I am using my fathers old Meade EQ1-B reflector telescope. This is my first night using it and I have come across a few questions. To begin, the telescope was left alone for several years (the scope is a fairly old model) and may have become damaged over time, yet nothing too severe. We were cleaning it and got to the mirror to find that over the years the ""mirror"" cover on top of the glass had chipped away all over, giving the result of a patchy look. </p>

<p>We were testing the scope out during the day and the image was fine - the mirror didn't affect it. Now, I am looking upon stars and have noticed a couple of things. When viewing these stars the image sort of moves, not the scope, the image. As if it were an animation, the star isn't just a white blob, it looks like the sun, where the blob is moving - as if it were a liquid. No I am not stupid enough to point the scope at the sun... during night time. The stars just move like a liquid in the center, is this an effect of the mirror? I can't see why it would be as the image was fine during daylight. Is this how all stars work? I haven't had a chance to point it at the moon or any other planets so I can't test it on an object that isn't a star.</p>

<p>Also, as the scope is a reflector it has the ""three lines"" on the front, however this interferes with the object I am looking at as i can see the lines on the star. Is there any way to stop this, or is it just the result of using a reflector?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

"How do isolated binary compact systems survive their formational supernovae?","<p>In a broad sense I'm trying to understand how a binary black hole or neutron star systems can form from isolated binary massive star systems (i.e., other than from migration within rich BH/NS clusters), and especially, how these can form within the constraints that allow for observed merger rates. I was hoping that <a href=""https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/questions/13681/the-black-hole-binary-that-was-detected-by-advanced-ligo-how-do-such-hypergian"">this question</a> would answer me, but it doesn't, because I realised I've never seen an explanation of how a binary system could survive a SN of one of its stars in the first place.</p>

<p>As far as I understand, we think one route to observed BH/NS mergers is a binary system of massive stars. This gives a scenario of 2 massive stars in an isolated binary system, one of which undergoes core collapse and type 2 SN. The two stars must be quite close (or later perturbed) and not greatly ""kicked"" on formation of either compact object, otherwise they couldn't later merge in the observed time. They probably also have similar ages (formed in the same cloud).</p>

<p>But in this scenario</p>

<ul>
<li><p>How does the second-to-collapse star, survive being ripped apart by a nearby SN at such short distance, and remain in a small enough orbit, which we know happens since we later observe the merger of two compact objects? How does it survive structurally and regain stability in a form capable of future SN, given the intense flood of neutrinos and other energy/particles, some of which can penetrate to its core? Or does the first SN directly trigger the second SN?</p></li>
<li><p>Even assuming the second star survives with enough mass and undisrupted structure for SN (or is triggered directly into SN), wouldn't the transferred momentum from the first SN ejecta ""on its doorstep"" be sufficient to simultaneously unbind the binary system, or the momentum transferred from the second SN be enough to eject the first NS/BH, so that the two resulting compact objects no longer form a binary system?</p></li>

It has been estimated to be about 6.6 to 6.9 Ga with a luminosity of 1.22 L(Sun). This all makes sense if you put it on the main sequence where we will be in a couple of billion years (after T(max) in about a billion years). The problem is that the surface temperature is only 5550K (spectral) and for this reason is thought to be in subgiant phase which isn't supposed to happen to us for about another 5.5 billion years.

<p>but says that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>The average tidal bulge is synchronized with the Moon's orbit,</strong> and
  Earth rotates under this tidal bulge in just over a day. However,
  Earth's rotation drags the position of the tidal bulge ahead of the
  position directly under the Moon. As a consequence, there exists a
  substantial amount of mass in the bulge that is offset from the line</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On the other hand, this academical <a href=""http://www.lhup.edu/%7Edsimanek/scenario/tides.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">article</a>
states the opposite:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>as we move with respect to both tidal bulge and moon, <strong>the moon
  crosses our meridian before we experience the highest tide.</strong>] How
  early? Some books show misleading diagrams with the symmetry axis of
  the tidal bulges making an angle of 30° or more with the moon. In
  fact, the angle is only 3°, so the tides are late by about 24(3/360)60
  = 12 minutes</p>
  
  <blockquote>

<p>Can you say what is the real position of the bulge? it is surely a hard fact not open to interpretations. Do you have access to sites that say where is now the moon and where is the tidal bulge?</p>

<p>According to the basic laws of conservation of momentum and energy, a mass moving to a greater radius should be slowed downm and if we add friction the lag of 12 minutes or more makes sense. If the highest point of the bulge is forward wrt to the vertical of the moon, can you explain what stronger force pushes the water in the direction of the spin?</p>

<h2>A) Projection of life</h2>

<p><strong>Premises:</strong></p>

<p>As Carl Sagan explained in his ""flatlanders"" story, we can imagine high-dimension space by making projections into space with lower dimension. 
As we learned at elementary school time is the fourth dimension.</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong></p>

<p>Is it right that what we see/feel in every moment is projection of some 4D reality into our 3D world noticed by our senses. 
For example, If my eyes were able to ""somehow"" see in 4D and I pointed my eyes to a person, would I see that person in all stages of his/her life from birth to death as a single ""entity""? In every second we are only a projection of our 4D representation to our 3D world? </p>

<h2>B) Parallel realities</h2>

<p><strong>Premises:</strong>   </p>

<p>If we imagine 1D space as a line without ends, 2D space as an unbounded plane and 3D space as an unbounded space, then I could put infinity number of parallel lines into 2D space and infinity number of parallel planes to the 3D space.</p>

<p>I have read that there are at least 10 dimensions.</p>

<p><strong>Questions:</strong></p>

<p>Can I put infinite number of 3D spaces into a single 4D space? If yes, then if we for example chose geographic coordinates of Earth-Italy-Caesena as place and 49 B.C. as time coordinate, we would be probably close to event when Caesar screamed his famous: ""alea iacta est"". </p>

<p>If we considered that 5th dimension exists and that we could put infinite number of 4D spaces into 5D space, then we would end up with infinite number of parallel realities, in which Caesar did not crossed Rubicon, or did not even exist. Is it right or complete nonsense? Can be somehow proved that this is right/nonsense?</p>

<li><p>Additionally: Why is part of the matter which is pulled into the black hole flung (i.e. <strong>accelerated</strong>) into the universe? I understand why this matter is maybe divided - the acceleration increases as far as i know quadratic, i.e. the differences in terms of the actual acceleration, in dependence of the location may be so huge that the matter can't be held together. But i don't understand why a part of the matter is accelerated in the exact <strong>opposite</strong> direction, as a force <strong>bigger</strong> as the gravity of the supermassive black hole would be needed. Therefore: Why is a part of the matter accelerated in the opposite direction (i.e. out of the black hole's gravity) than the other part?</p></li>

"Black Hole / Hawking Radiation: Why only capture anti-particle?","<p>I may have some specifics wrong here.  If so, don't focus on those.  Just focus on the general thrust of my question.</p>

<p>I ""understand"" (cough) that particle/anti-particle pairs form spontaneously in space.  I understand that they can form near the event horizon of a black hole, and that one particle can fall in, where as the other particle can barely escape.  I understand that an anti-particle will annihilate with a particle.  What I don't understand is why only the anti-particles of these virtual particle pairs fall into the black hole, while the other ones just manage to escape.  Shouldn't both particle and anti-particle have equal chance to be the one to fall in, or just manage to escape?</p>

<p>It seems that there should be an equal chance of either the particle, or the anti-particle, would be captured while the other ""ejected.""  So it seems that the black hole should be somewhat steady-state as far as mass change with respect to virtual particles.</p>

"Does Eddington's variable polytropic index better fit data from the Standard Solar Model?","<p>I came across <a href=""http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?1938MNRAS..99....4E&amp;defaultprint=YES&amp;filetype=.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">a 1938 paper by Arthur Eddington</a><sup>1</sup> in which he discusses stellar polytropic models where the polytropic index <span class=""math-container"">$n$</span> varies inside the star, decreasing from a value <span class=""math-container"">$n_2$</span> at the surface to a value <span class=""math-container"">$n_1$</span> at the center. He specifically mentions that the case of <span class=""math-container"">$n_1=1.5$</span> and <span class=""math-container"">$n_2=3.5$</span> should represent ""ordinary gaseous stars"" quite well.</p>

<p>In his conclusion, he states</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We have seen that actual stars are likely to be represented by a model with <span class=""math-container"">$n$</span> continually increasing outwards.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>78 years later, we have better data about the structure of the Sun, thanks in part to helioseismology. So I have two questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Do researchers use Eddington's variable index treatment in theoretical models?</li>
<li>Does Eddington's model better fit current data from the Sun than the standard polytropic model with <span class=""math-container"">$n$</span> constant throughout the star?</li>
</ol>

<p>I ask partly because I know that the standard polytropic model (with <span class=""math-container"">$n=3$</span>) begins to fail in the outer regions of a star, thanks in part to convection, as shown below, and I wondered if even a simple two-phase model could suitably describe a convective envelope.</p>

"Roll, Pitch and Yaw of Orbital Planes","<p>I have been reading about celestial mechanics and particularly about planetary orbits. I understand that a planet's orbit can be tilted (pitched) with respect to the Earth's ecliptic and that it might precess (yaw) over time. But I have not come across any indication that another planet's orbital plane might be rolled with respect to the Earth's.</p>

<p>Say you’re up in space and you’re far enough way that you can see the planet earth. Whilst looking down, you can see  blue sky, blue water and green land and white clouds and darker shades of different colors. This is because our sun is reflecting light off our planet that we can see these colors. </p>

<p>Now you’re up in space and you’re far enough way that you can see the planet Jupiter. If you looked, would you be able to see colors in the same way we’ve seen from Juno’s pictures. I see red, white, orange… The sun is so much further away, how can the colors we see be just as bright/visible to us? The same question holds true for planets outside our solar system. They’re so far way from there light source, yet I can see colors on them. How come the distance of the light source doesn’t affect the brightness of the colors I see on these planets? </p>

<p>Like if I was to turn on a light bulb in a huge dark room and shine that light in the middle, the surrounding areas would be much brighter than the furthest point of that room/and at some point there would be no light reaching an even further point. </p>

"Maximum Amplitude of a Lissajous Orbiting Object in a L4 or L5 Position","<p>I stumbled on The <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_point#L4_and_L5"" rel=""nofollow"">Lagrangian points</a> during some wikipedia reading.  After looking at the gravity contours, I naturally come to the conclusion that the L4 &amp; L5 should have a wave pattern and then found the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lissajous_orbit"" rel=""nofollow"">Lissajous orbit</a> page.  It states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Orbits about Lagrangian points L4 and L5 are dynamically stable in theory so long as the ratio of the masses of the two main objects is greater than about 25, meaning the natural dynamics keep the [third object] in the vicinity of the Lagrangian point even when slightly perturbed from equilibrium.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After reading it I started to wonder if there is a maximum possible amplitude (height of the peaks and troughs relative to the orbital plane of the second object) of the pattern?</p>

<p>Also, if there theoretically is none, for cases where it is extremely large, say larger than the 2 times the radius of the second orbiting object, what would the respective object weight ratios have to be to keep such a perturbed orbit stable for any realistic period of time?</p>

However, I am curious whether it would be possible for this event to only occur once annually on a specific date (and preferably on the same face of the planet) if the moon's angular orbit around Earth were to be altered from 5°.</p>

<p>To put it bluntly:
How would the components causing a lunar eclipse need to be altered for a singular 'blood moon' to be able to appear reliably every year on say the 25th of September? If it is at all possible.

"Why is Mars considered the outer edge of the ""goldilocks zone""?","<p>In both books and documentaries I often see the Goldilocks Zone as described between Venus and Mars with the Earth ""just right."" This seems sort of ill thought out to me, because it assumes that Venus' atmosphere comes from its distance from the sun and the same with Mars. I'm not too familiar with current ideas about how Venus' atmosphere formed, but with Mars I'm fairly sure it's widely understood the reason the atmosphere is so small is because the gravity is so weak. Even some discussions about terra forming Mars mention that within a few million years, perhaps, the atmosphere would drift off into space.</p>

<p>So how can we be so certain that's the limits of the zones, especially with Mars? If Mars was as large as Earth/Venus and could hold on to a thicker atmosphere and thus retain more heat, then wouldn't that automatically push out the Goldilocks Zone? It seems like the edges have been places arbitrarily without consideration as to <em>why</em> they're the edges instead of ""they just are."" This comes up especially because even with its weak atmosphere, at the equator, it can reach up to 20 degrees which is well within the realm of liquid water.</p>

"What produces gravitational waves with ""periods between about 100 - 8000 seconds""?","<p>The <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulysses_(spacecraft)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Ulysses mission</a> has a compelling story. I was sent to Jupiter to perform a gravitational assist shooting it out of the plane of the ecliptic in order to fly over the Sun's north and south poles to perform ""fast latitude scans"". Because of its design it was used for several important lines of scientific study.</p>

<p>Ulysses contained a pair of coherent transponders which received signals from Earth, shifted them in frequency in a coherent way using phase-locked loops and beamed them immediately back to Earth at two different frequencies.</p>

<p>From ESA's write up of the <a href=""http://sci.esa.int/ulysses/40406-instruments/?fbodylongid=1940"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Ulysses Gravitational Wave Experiment</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the spacecraft Doppler tracking method, the Earth and spacecraft constitute the two objects whose time-varying separation is monitored to detect a passing gravitational wave. The monitoring is accomplished with high-precision Doppler tracking in which a constant frequency microwave radio signal (S-band) is transmitted from the Earth to the spacecraft (uplink); the signal is transponded (received and coherently amplified) at the spacecraft; and then transmitted back to Earth (downlink) in both S- and X-band signals. This Dual frequency downlink is required in order to calibrate the interplanetary media which affects the two frequency bands differently. The downlink signal is recorded at Earth and its frequency is compared to the constant uplink frequency f0 to extract the Doppler signal, δf / f0.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The article goes on to say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Since the optimum size of a gravitational wave detector is the wave length, interplanetary dimensions are needed for detecting gravitational waves in the mHz range. Doppler tracking of Ulysses provides sensitive detections of gravitational waves in this low frequency band. The driving noise source is the fluctuations in the refractive index of interplanetary plasma. This dictates the timing of the experiment to be near solar opposition and sets the target accuracy for the fractional frequency change at 3.0 × 10-14 for integration times of the order of 1000 seconds.</p>
  
  <p>SUMMARY OF OBJECTIVES</p>
  
  <p>The objective of the gravitational wave investigation on Ulysses is to search for low frequency gravitational waves crossing the Solar System. Because of the great distance to the spacecraft, <strong>this method is most sensitive to wave periods between about 100 - 8000 seconds, a band which is not accessible to ground-based experiments which are superior for periods below 1 second.</strong></p>

"What telescopes have observed anomalies in the light curve of Tabby's star, KIC 8462852?","<p>KIC 8462852, the F-star that inexplicably dims by up to 20% for short periods, is still getting alot of attention. A slow continuous dimming by about 0.3% a year has been identified <a href=""https://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.01316v1.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">recently</a>. But all anomalies I know of come from the Kepler space telescope. It is an F3-star at 1500 ly distance.

"Radiative Flux, Irradiance and Luminosity confusion","<p>First of all I know there is a similar question <a href=""https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/questions/20032/difference-between-luminosity-luminous-flux-and-radiant-flux"">here</a>, but I feel is wasn't answered at all.</p>

<p>My question is that I have seen many texts which says that Radiative Flux is equal to the Irradiance of a star. In Carroll &amp; Ostlie book ""An Introduction to Modern Astrophysics"" even say that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/s6AjB.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/s6AjB.png"" alt=""Screenshot from the book""></a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And Wikipedia's <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_irradiance#Irradiance_on_Earth&#39;s_surface"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Irradiance on Earth's surface</a> says this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Average annual solar radiation arriving at the top of the Earth's atmosphere is roughly 1361 W/m².</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Following this I first I assume that Irradiance and Radiative Flux are the same thing, but when searching for <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irradiance"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Irradiance</a> on Wikipedia says that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In radiometry, irradiance is the radiant flux (power) received by a surface per unit area.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which means that Irradiance is Flux divided by Area, so Radiant Flux has units of J/s and Irradiance has units of W m^-2 which I remember from my Optics class, then again Carroll &amp; Ostlie say that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/yV6GG.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/yV6GG.png"" alt=""S and O screenshot""></a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>That doesn't mean if Irradiance is equal to Radiant Flux divided by Area, so F = I*A that would make Irradiance equal Luminosity / Area^2 ?
In that case the bolometric magnitude should be calculated with the integral of Irradiance, not Luminosity nor Flux right?</p>

<p>Probably I'm making it complicated for myself and it's not that hard to understand. I'm just sharing my confusion with you guys, please help me with that question.</p>

"Basis of color index","<p>As an amateur astronomer for 60 years and always as interested in the science as in the observing, I thought I had a pretty good understanding of the fundamentals. But I'm distance-auditing a third-year course in the fundamentals of applied astronomy, and I found that I had a misconception about the color index. </p>

<p>I had assumed the CI was derived by measuring the star's own magnitude in each of, say, the <em>B</em> and <em>V</em> passbands, then subtracting to get the CI (e.g., by taking the ratio of flux intensities, expressed as a magnitude).</p>

<p>Not so! It's derived by measuring the star's magnitude <em>relative to standard zero points</em> (the magnitude of Vega at each of those wavelengths) that are <em>defined to be</em> magnitude 0 <em>for those wavelength</em>, then subtracting to get the CI.</p>

<p>My question is: Why measure two fluxes relative to a standard and then compare those two values, rather than simply measuring them relative to each other? Why <em>not</em> just measure the flux at each wavelength, take the ratio, express this as a magnitude, and use that as the CI? The relationships are the same either way, just with a different zero point (think 0K and -273°C). It seems like finding how far apart Cleveland and Chicago are by measuring the distance of each from NYC and subtracting, rather than just measuring the distance between them. I don't see that the convention accomplishes anything other than assigning a CI of 0 to ""neutral"" white stars. Or am I missing something?</p>

"Weird Blob near Polaris?","<p>I need help identifying a blob. </p>

<p>Last night I took a picture of Polaris, and there is a weird blob in it that I can't identify.  Star charts and other pictures on the 'net do not show this blob.  I took three pictures (with slightly different positions) and the blob has the same shape and position (relative to Polaris) in each.  The blob does not exist in other pictures that I took (pointing in completely different directions).</p>

<p>Taken with a Canon t5i, 300mm lens, 3 minute exposure on a motorized equitorial mount.  Viewing conditions were terrible, with lots-o-moon and smoke from forest fires.  From Colorado.</p>

<p>Polaris is the brightest star, slightly left and down from center.  Yildun, the next star in the handle of the little dipper, is near the upper left corner.  The blob in question is very near, and slightly up and to the left of Polaris.</p>

<p>Thoughts?  Speculations?</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>Simple Lens Flare:  I don't think it's lens flare (LF).  With LF, you can draw a straight line through the photo where the flare, the bright object, and the center of the photo all line up. Also, the LF tends to match the shape of the bright object.  I don't think it's LF because the blob doesn't line up with the center of the photo and a bright object, and there are no bright objects that have the same shape as the blob (with that weird tail to it).  Also, I have three photos with the same blob. In each case, Polaris (the brightest point in the photo) moves slightly because the camera moved slightly but the blob moves exactly with Polaris and not somehow relative with the center of the frame.  </p>

<p>Under careful analysis, there <em>IS</em> lens flare, but it is where you'd expect it and not where the blob is. If you draw a line though Polaris and the center of the frame, there is a flare on the opposite side of the center and the same distance away from the center as Polaris is.</p>

<p>Schmutz in the camera:  I don't think it's dust/dirt in the camera/sensor.  If that were the case then I would have seen it in other photos from the night, and I didn't.  Also, the blob would have stayed in the same position in the frame and not moved with Polaris as it did in the 3 different photos that I have of it.</p>

<p>Not-So-Simple Lens Flare:  Maybe.  Although I cant imagine how this would happen unless some lens elements were not radially-symmetric and/or elements were not lined up on a common axis.  But I don't know everything about camera design so maybe this is possible?</p>

<p>There's a new blob in the sky:  Possible.  Although I think the odds of ""user error"" are much higher.  Maybe someone else wants to take a new photo of Polaris?  (wishful thinking)</p>

<p>When I read some more about Earth's day length, I learned that the length of Earth's day is believed to have been shorter in the past and getting longer over time. Here's an example from this site:</p>

<p><a href=""https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/questions/27966/what-was-the-length-of-the-solar-day-73-million-years-ago"">What was the length of the solar day 73 million years ago?</a></p>

<p>As some may know from an introductory psychology course, humans tend to settle into a day that is longer than 24 hours when placed in an environment with no external time or light cues. For most people, their circadian system is able to adjust their day to the 24-hour Earth day. Some blind people lose this ability, as seen from commercials about medication to help them gain a 24-hour rhythm. Here is some background about that:</p>

<p>At the risk of asking an unacceptable ""opinion"" question, how convincing is the evidence of historical Earth day lengths? Is the evidence at a point where shorter Earth days in the past are an accepted certainty? Or are things still at a point of being a best guess without really knowing? It would seem rather odd for our nervous systems to have evolved with a preference for days longer than 24 hours. It is certainly possible, but I would appreciate some input here before spending time contemplating why evolution might have worked that way. I'm only a hobbyist, so there would be no need to go into too much depth for me specifically. Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Edit: The current answers and comments are interesting and appreciated, but to clarify, the intended focus is the extent and quality of the astronomical evidence that could be used in a discussion (elsewhere) about circadian issues.</p>

It doesn't seem possible to me that the attenuated ripple in space time from an event so far away could pass right through the gravity well of a closer local black hole like a galactic supermassive black hole.</p>

"Could an asteroid impact cause radioactive fallout?","<p>Could a (regional or global) fallout of radioactive material be a ""bonus"" disaster effect of an asteroid impact? My reasoning for how such a scenario maybe could be possible:</p>

<p>A) Some asteroids maybe consist of lots of radioactive heavy metals because they were initially formed by ejecta from the cores of planets during planetary collisions. Maybe even an airburst of a rather small such an asteroid could cause widespread dangerous radiak fallout?</p>

<p>As I understand it, Earth's initial uranium has fallen into the core. The uranium mines dig into concentrated deposits of uranium in the crust which came from uranium rich asteroids.</p>

<p>B) If any kind of asteroid large enough hits a uranium rich part of the Earth crust (making it the second one on the same spot), it could maybe eject much of Earth's own uranium and thus cause a dangerous fallout?</p>

<p>For example, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaia_(spacecraft)#Objectives"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">GAIA's design targets for precision were roughly 7, 20, and 200 micro-arcseconds for visual magnitudes 10, 15, and 20, respectively</a> whereas <span class=""math-container"">$\lambda/D$</span>  gives 70,000 x 200,000 micro-arcseconds for its rectangular mirror.</p>

<p>The limitations are both <em>instrumental</em> beyond just the aperture or baseline, and connected to the nature of the signal, and that's were determining the direction of a gravitational wave source is very different than determining the direction of a star's light.</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> For gravitational waves then, what actually determines the angular uncertainty of the source direction? Does it turn out to be baseline-limited (e.g. <span class=""math-container"">$\lambda/D$</span>) or instrument-limited, or limited by the very short-lived and chirped nature of the signal?

<p>I am re-creating the solar system in an n-body simulation that i programmed before. And I've a problem with scaling down the solar data. So even if I use kg and km for the metric units, the values are far bigger than the variables can hold in programming. Also as some of you know, bigger the value is, bigger the floating point error it makes. (error noise in data) Also it makes it slower to process.</p>

<p>I decided to scale down the data with a reference point, and for that, I took the earth's radius as 1 unit. And scaled down every other distance and radius according to it. (So a unit is 6371 km just to be clear)</p>

<p>But I am not sure whether if I should scale down the mass or not. My common sense says that I should scale down the mass so density of each body should remain same. So I took the density, and calculated a new mass value for each body, with the new scaled down radius.
But I am somehow couldn't conviced myself about If it's true or not. So here I am, asking to you :) Should I also scale down the mass?</p>

<p>PS.1: I used using F = GMm/r^2 equation for the calculactions as usual. (Iterating it through each body pairs)</p>

"Is the expected time for a star in an elliptical galaxy to collide with another star less than the average age of elliptical galaxies?","<p>According to the Wikipedia article <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptical_galaxy"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Elliptical galaxy</a>, elliptical galaxies have a much lower concentration of gas between the stars than spiral galaxies. I know that until the gas is below a certain concentration, its atoms don't travel very far between collisions and it follows the normal gas laws and the gas actually flows into the stars when they pass by. I know that when the interstellar gas is at such a low concentration that atoms on average travel a much larger distance than the average diameter of a star in the elliptical galaxy it's in, the gas doesn't follow the normal gas laws and gas gets mainly absorbed into stars by happening to be headed towards one and colliding with it rather than by flowing towards one and the ratio of the rate of absorption of gas into stars to the concentration of interstellar gas is lower, and a star has about the same expected time before colliding with another star as an interstellar gas atom has before colliding with a star. I also know that when the interstellar medium is at the equilibrium concentration, there are 3 possible driving forces for the reduction of interstellar gas; star formation, flow of interstellar gas into stars, and random collisions of interstellar gas atoms with a star which can only occur at very low concentration; and 2 driving forces for the increase in interstellar gas, the slow escape of gas molecules from stars and collisions between stars because collisions occur at a high enough speed to produce an explosion instead of combining into a larger star. Which driving force for the reduction of interstellar gas is the largest? Also, which driving force for the increase in interstellar gas is larger? If it's star formation, that means the interstellar gas is at a high enough concentration to follow the normal gas laws but since the amount of interstallar gas is at equilibrium, the main driving force for the increase in interstellar gas is collisions between stars. If it's the slow escape of gas from stars, the main driving force for the decrease in interstellar gas could be the flow of gas into stars or the random collisions of gas molecules with stars but not star formation. If the main driving force for the reduction in interstallr gas concentration is collisions of gas molecules with stars, then a star has about the same expected time beofre a collision with another star as an intersteller gas atom has before colliding with another star so the expected time before a star collides with another star is less than the age of the galaxy and if it's flow of gas into stars, the main driving force for the increase in interstellar gas could be either of the two driving forces but if the driving force for the increase is collisions between stars, the expected time before a star collides with another star is less than the age of the galaxy, </p>

<p>On the other hand, if the interstellar gas concentration has not yet reached equilibrium, it could be that not enough time has gone by for the interstellar gas to not follow the normal gas laws and star formation occurs mainly by the gas coalescing into stars. It could also be that the interstellar gas started diving exponentially until it stopped following the normal gas laws then the rate at which it divides exponentially greatly reduced so it has not yet had time to reach the equilibrium concentration.</p>

"A ""tidally locked"" double planet?","<p>First, I'd like to take the definition of a ""double-planet"" as two bodies orbiting each other where the center of gravity is not inside the larger body. Also, the system would have to fill other planet requirements (like emptying it's own orbital area around the star).</p>

<p>Now, let's say that the ""binary system"" is in an orbit close enough to a star to be tidally locked to the star. How would the tidal effects of the star's gravity effect the orbit of the planets around each other??</p>

<p>Let's take an example of a ""double-planet"" (of $0.075$ and $0.030\:\mathrm{M_{Earth}}$ with a separation of $1.17 \times 10^6\:\mathrm{km}$ orbiting their CM in about $450\:\mathrm{days}$. They are $0.085\:\mathrm{AU}$ from a star of mass $0.35\:\mathrm{M_{Sun}}$ and thus orbit the star in $15.3\:\mathrm{days}$. The planetary rotation/co-orbital period is much longer than the orbital period around the star, so I would think that the planets would have characteristics of a lone TL planet.</p>

<p>I am wondering how such a system would evolve over time. Would someone on the surface of one of the planets experience experience night and day in 15.3 day cycles? Would the difference in tidal effects of the star on the different sized planets cause the orbit to ""precess"" or have some other effect?</p>

"Is there any cosmological evidence that neutrinos travel at a speed other than c?","<p>I've been looking into neutrinos. One thing I'm puzzled about is how fast they travel. </p>

<p>See the Wikipedia <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SN_1987A#Neutrino_emissions"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">SN1987A</a> article where you can read this: <em>“approximately two to three hours before the visible light from SN1987A reached Earth, a burst of neutrinos was observed at three separate neutrino observatories”</em>. Some <a href=""https://www.google.co.uk/#q=sn1987a+7.7hours"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">reports</a> describe an initial burst of neutrinos which arrived 7.7 hours before the light. It's thought that the neutrinos were emitted before the light because of the way stars collapse, wherein photons take longer to get out. I don't have much of an issue with that. But what's interesting is that in 168,000 years travelling through space, the photons didn’t overtake the neutrinos. That suggests to me that neutrinos are massless, which ties in with what Fermi said in section VII of his <a href=""http://microboone-docdb.fnal.gov/cgi-bin/RetrieveFile?docid=953;filename=FermiBetaDecay1934.pdf;version=1"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">1934 paper</a>. He plotted three curves and noted that the μ=0 curve matched the empirical curves. He concluded that <em>“the rest mass of the neutrino is either zero, or, in any case, very small in comparison to the mass of the electron”</em>.</p>

<p>The thing is that if neutrinos travel at exactly c they have no mass at all. And I can't find any evidence that they don't. I can find plenty of evidence for electrons travelling at speeds less than c. The neutrino is said to be a fermion like an electron. But I can't find any evidence of neutrinos travelling at speeds less than c. </p>

<p>Can anybody give me a reference to any cosmological evidence that neutrinos travel at less than c? Or any other hard scientific evidence? By evidence I don't mean an inference such as <em>""neutrinos go missing so they must oscillate therefore they must have mass therefore they must travel at less than c""</em>. I mean evidence. </p>

Does the process of entering the black hole strip out all the nuclear energy contained in mass/matter?

"Could an impact have resurfaced Venus 300 million years ago?","<p>Venus surface isn't older than about 300 million years. The only explanation I've come across is that some kind of global volcanism resurfaced the planet. But couldn't it have been an impact event? A huge comet hitting it by chance, maybe making Venus tip over and stop spinning too.</p>

<p>Or could Venus have had a moon like Phobos which spiraled inwards, disintegrated and rained down during a few million years? Phobos will do so in only 50 million years, maybe it is a common feature for terrestrial planets to form with such moons that hit them billions of years later. Maybe Earth is an exception because of the large Moon and how it formed.</p>

<p>Would an impact event leave visible traces like impact basins, or could the entire surface melt and reform as it is today, as I suppose Earth did when the Moon formed? Could Venus have been a very different planet up until 0.3 billion years ago? How could one find out, what kind of investigation would be needed?</p>

<p>Pluto's mass is about 1/50th of Mars (and Theia), so I suppose that it would be enough for a Pluto sized comet to have had about 7 times the impact speed compared to the pre-Earth/Theia collision. Comets could have up to 70+35 km/s speed relative to Venus. Someone maybe can make a rough estimate of what's needed to resurface Venus and how likely such an impact event would be?</p>

<p>And could reformation and redifferentiation after an impact have eliminated a previous magnetic field?</p>

<p>The diversity of the planets and moons, I suggest, depend more on their vast history of random events, than on where and how they once formed. I suspect that planetary scientists generally want to discount a unique planet reforming event only 0.3 billion years ago, just to make their job a bit easier ;-)</p>

"What kind of a visual trajectory would an asteroid have if it were to hit Earth?","<p>Let's say that Peter has a set of superb telescopes and he's watching the sky every night, for 3-4 months.

Would the change slow down or accelerate? Would it be a small piece of a spiral (I don't mean complete spirals, just the fact that it wouldn't be a parabola or a circle)? What do you think Peter would see if he animated its movement during the course of months on a virtual sky sphere?</p>

<p>Now if we evaluate this for photons which have $\mu =0$ we get
$u = aT^4$ where $ a= 4 \sigma /c$ is radiation constant.</p>

<p>More (possibly) relevant information:
I understand the Hour Angle HR is the measure of how far Aries is from the local meridian (RA of current meridian of longitude).

Or in other words any object in space depending on its position in the galaxy will slow or increase to an ideal rotation?</p>

<p>So I understand that this is a false color image, and the image at 4.6-micron is overlaid using red. <strong>So I should really ask:</strong> why is <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C/2014_Q2_(Lovejoy)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Comet C/2014 Q2 (Lovejoy)</a> (and probably many) comet actually bright at 4.6 microns ""...owing to a combination of gas and dust in the comet's coma.""

"Which came first: Galaxies <=> Stars <=> Planets?","<p>If a galaxy is <strong>defined</strong> as a collection of planetary systems (and all matter in between), and a planetary system is defined as a collection of planets circling a star (and all matter in between), and a planet (and other smaller bodies, like asteroids, moonlets, moons, etc) is basically just a very very, very large collection of minerals, stardust and gases (which make up the entire universe), <strong>which came first: The planets, planetary systems or galaxies?</strong> <em>I've been given to understand the universe came first...but after that?</em></p>

<p>I thought I understood, at least the layman's basics, of the universe formation. However, today, I’m having trouble <strong>conceptualising the order</strong> in which they would have been formed, <strong>IF</strong> they are <em>defined</em> by the smaller unit.  </p>

<p><strong>Is this just me getting the semantics of classification and the actual chronology of each feature forming, mixed up?</strong> </p>

<hr>

<hr>

<p>VERY Basically,</p>

<ul>
<li>The universe is made up of a complex mix of everything (matter, antimatter, darkmatter, to name just a few), and expanding 'space'.</li>
<li>A very, very, large area of 'space' is covered in very, very, tiny particles: made up of at first gases and later 'stardust'.</li>
<li>A galaxy is formed of gravity-attracted gases, and after the very first stars went supernova and exploded there was also 'stardust', which combines to create 'clumps' of interstellar clouds (cloud nebulae).</li>
<li>The cloud nebulae are the 'nursery' areas for star formation (both initial stars and later generation stars). </li>
<li>The newly created star uses remnants of 'stardust' in the cloud nebulae to form planetary systems and then, a 'short' time later the orbiting planets (and other sized objects). </li>
</ul>

<p>So then the chronological order would be: </p>

<p>Universe (Largest scale) => gases (very small scale) => galaxy => interstellar clouds => <strong>stars => planets (combined to form planetary systems)</strong>. And the tiny particles of gases and 'stardust', are involved in <em>nearly</em> all scales.</p>

A footnote explains that the luminosity of the sun is proportional to the seventh power of G, which seems incredible to me. I know that this has to be a simplification, since stellar dynamics are annoyingly complex, but if we put that aside, is this essentially correct, or is it a typo? What would be the theoretical justification for this in broad terms? (eg, ""Gravitational pressure is proportional to this exponent of G, but since that also shrinks the size of the star, which increases the pressure, it's actually this exponent of G, and the rate of fusion is proportional to the gravitational pressure squared, so you end up with 7"").</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>This previous <a href=""https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/questions/1299/what-is-the-physical-geometric-shape-of-the-universe"">related question</a> did ask the same thing. However the OP was also asking about if the universe had a centre and if everything (galaxies, dust, stuff etc...) was evenly spread out only along the outer edges. </p>

<p><em>As far as I understand it, the Big Bang that started everything off isn't a typical 'explosion' with a central point. Shapley noted that it appeared as if galaxies are moving away from the Milky Way. We now realise that it is the space between galaxies that is expanding (and that we are not the centre of the universe). in 1998, Hubble then found that the far distant galaxies appear to be moving faster than closer galaxies. This means that the rate of expansion is accelerating. This acceleration rate is known as the Hubble constant.</em></p>

<p><strong>Can I assume that the answer is still as summarized in the related questions comments?</strong></p>

<p><strong><em>'We don't know?'</em></strong></p>

<p>Astromax commented on the question,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Well, it is indeed flat, meaning Euclidean geometry can be used. Since light travels at a finite rate and the universe is not infinitely old, our 'bubble' of observable stuff within the universe would be in the shape of a sphere centered on us. However, the center of the sphere would change if you decided to move to a different part of the universe. Is the universe infinite? This is not known, since we cannot see passed our observational horizon</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<hr>

<p>Accepted Answer</p>

<p>To be honest I didn't understand the first half of the accepted answer, and having attempted to read through the <a href=""http://arxiv.org/pdf/1303.5086v2.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Planck paper</a> that was linked, I can tell you that I don't know much about astronomy! I kept getting lost in all the new (to me) astonomical terms being thrown about. </p>

<p>I read the second half of the accepted answer to be explaining that the universe has no centre.</p>

<p>Gerald commented on the OP's question about the shape 'shortly' after the big bang,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Something else: Roughly resembling the 3-dimensional surface of 4-dimensional sphere, but not quite symmetrical. The precise shape is not exactly known, but probably not too much distorted, like a torus, a cube or a dodecahedron. This is still under investigation; more precise results are expected within a few years, when polarization of the CMB will be analysed</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and went further to clarify the linked Planck paper</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Neither the circles-in-the-sky search nor the likelihood method ﬁnd evidence for a multiply-connected topology"" of the Planck paper, section 6.1 means it's not a torus-like or more complex object with holes.  </p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p>Second Answer</p>

<p>The more popular second answer, definitely focussed more on answering the 'does the universe have a centre?' question. </p>

<p>Helpful comments to my focus, Astromax commented </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Also, that the universe is ""infinite"" is not something anyone can prove. The expansion of space-time seems to occur everywhere, but that does not mean that the universe is infinite.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Stan Lou commented </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Being infinite doesn't imply having no boundary (not by itself, at least). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>and ended with </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Yes, a flat 3-torus is a possible geometry, but the geometry does not have to be ""repetitive"" in the sense of wrapping around on itself. It doesn't have to be a torus. Beyond the horizon could be a Euclidean space instead of a flat torus. Or there could be pink unicorns. Or anything else. The point of the horizon is that we don't know what's beyond it. (But if one assumes that the universe is globally isotropic, then it can't be a torus.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And the OP summarised it by saying </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So it seems like it boils down to this: It's probably flat, probably 3D. It might be edge-less, or not, we don't know. If yes, might be hypertorus and we could eventually do a round trip and came to starting point. If not, might be a ball, or anything else. We don't know, and can't imagine because of our limited scope. Is this at least remotely aligned with today's theories or are there still some gapping holes?</p>

"Why is twilight longer in summer than winter and shortest at the equinox","<p>I recently decided to set my alarm clock to wake me up when it is ""dark"" out.  In the end, I decided to set my clock to the earliest time that nautical sunrise is in my state (Illinois) and stick with that all year.</p>

<p>While doing some research for this, I noticed something that surprised me.  Check out this disparity between astronomical sunrise to civil sunrise for the solstices and equinox (the latter two adjusted for daylight saving time):</p>

<p>Date/Astronomical/Civil/Disparity</p>

<ul>
<li>Dec 20: 0533 - 0640 (67 minutes)</li>
<li>Mar 20: 0526 - 0630 (64 minutes)</li>
<li>Jun 20: 0320 - 0451 (91 minutes)</li>
</ul>

<p>To be honest, these sets of ranges surprise me for multiple reasons.  I clearly don't know what I don't know, but here are some questions I can formulate:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Why would twilight be longer in summer than winter?</strong>  Before seeing this data, I had assumed that since the sun makes a more perpendicular path through the horizon in summer that twilight would be shorter in summer than in winter.  After all, in winter the sun takes a ""slanted"" path across the horizon.  Wouldn't the summer's path be more direct and therefore quicker?</li>
<li>OK: seeing this empirical evidence I conclude that something is wrong with my premise that forms my first question.  Summer twilight is longer in summer than winter.  However, I still would have assumed that March 20 would have had a twilight length in between the two solstices.  But it's not!  <strong>Why does the equinox have the shortest twilight?</strong> </li>
</ol>

<hr>

<p>Appended 5/13/2014:</p>

<p>I didn't want to leave my original incorrect statement in here without flagging it. As Cheekhu points out below, the sun does <strong>not</strong> follow a more perpendicular path in summer than winter, as I had erroneously assumed and stated above.  See his post for more details.</p>

"Explosions of black holes","<p>I was bopping around YouTube and observed this <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nHBGFKLHZQ"">enjoyably produced video</a>.

<p>Of all the fun things illustrated there, that was the one whose pretense I didn't understand. Do black holes explode after they've radiated away all of their mass? Or would the ""explosion"" just come from the rapid pace at which the black hole would consume nearby matter?</p>

<p>The Googling I've done thus far has provided no firm answer. The closest I've come is from the Wikipedia page on <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawking_radiation"">Hawking Radiation</a>, which states, ""For a black hole of one solar mass, we get an evaporation time of 2.098 × 10^67 years—much longer than the current age of the universe at 13.799 ± 0.021 x 10^9 years. But for a black hole of 10^11 kg, the evaporation time is 2.667 billion years. This is why some astronomers are searching for signs of exploding primordial black holes.""</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Astronomers have been using Cepheid variables as cosmic yardsticks to gauge nearby intergalactic distances for more than a century. But trying to harvest a bunch of these stars was so time-consuming as to be nearly unachievable. <strong>So, the team employed a clever new method, called DASH (Drift And Shift), using Hubble as a ""point-and-shoot"" camera to snap quick images of the extremely bright pulsating stars, which eliminates the time-consuming need for precise pointing.</strong></p>
  
  <p>""When Hubble uses precise pointing by locking onto guide stars, it can only observe one Cepheid per each 90-minute Hubble orbit around Earth. So, it would be very costly for the telescope to observe each Cepheid,"" explained team member Stefano Casertano, also of STScI and Johns Hopkins. <strong>""Instead, we searched for groups of Cepheids close enough to each other that we could move between them without recalibrating the telescope pointing.</strong> These Cepheids are so bright, we only need to observe them for two seconds. This technique is allowing us to observe a dozen Cepheids for the duration of one orbit. So, we stay on gyroscope control and keep 'DASHing' around very fast.""</p>

<p>I understand that the technique skips the use of guide stars, but I'm wondering exactly what does happen. What does the word <em>recalibrating</em> mean in ""..move between them without recalibrating the telescope pointing..."" </p>

<p>The late 1700's saw a couple of revolutions in astronomy such as the discovery of Uranus as the first non-antique planet and the measurement of solar system distances thanks to the transits of Venus.

"where to obtain ephemeris data for geodesy satellites?","<p>Is anyone aware of where one can obtain <strong>ephemeris data in Geocentric Celestial Reference Systems (GCRS) coordinates</strong> for a geodesy satellite such as LAGEOS (It doesn't really matter which mission)? Or, alternatively, simulated data in <strong>GCRS coordinates</strong>. Specifically, Cartesian position and velocity coordinates. I can't seem to find them anywhere. </p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> My confusion has increased. I will try and rephrase my question.</p>

<p>Is it possible to obtain an ephemeris file and perform a transformation such that the ephemeris data can be expressed in GCRS coordinates? And if so, what is the process?</p>

<p><strong>Purpose of question:</strong>
What I am interested in is ephemeris data for a satellite (doesn't really matter which mission) that is subject to classical Newtonian acceleration plus relativistic corrections as recommended by the IERS such as Schwarzschild, Lense-Thirring and Geodetic accelerations.</p>

"Is a wavy path possible for a shooting star?","<p>I was camping recently (May 2014), and observed several shooting stars (very fast, short lived), a few satellites (very slow, long lived) and lots of aircraft (flashing lights) in the night sky.</p>

<p>All of the shooting stars appeared normal, as very fast streaks across the sky, which disappeared within a fraction of a second. All except one. One started fairly straight as normal, then took a completely unexpected wavy path (like releasing a balloon to fly around the room) towards the end of its flight. Then it winked out. What caused this?</p>

<p>Note, I was completely sober at the time, the sky was clear, and I believe this could not have been an aircraft or satellite because of its tremendous speed. Apart from this 'meteor', there was nothing else in the sky which could be interpreted as a firework.</p>

"Is the age of the universe relative to an observer's location in that universe?","<p>According to Wiki the age of the universe is 13 billion years old, and I was taught that background radiation made the universe uniform in all directions.</p>

<p>Doesn't this define a sphere of space in the universe with Earth at the center? This sphere would have a radius of 13 billion light years.</p>

<p>We (on Earth) could not see anything outside this sphere. As light did not exist more than 13 billion years ago. So for us this defines some kind of edge for the universe.</p>

<p>But what happens when an alien in another galaxy 5 billion light years away from Earth also looks towards the stars. Don't they see a uniform background radiation and measure the same age of the universe?</p>

<p>That alien would also have a sphere of 13 billion years.</p>

<p>So we have two spheres, one for Earth and one for our alien friend.</p>

<p>These two spheres would overlap each other by 5 billion years. Which means, if we look in the opposite direction from that alien's galaxy. We can see an additional 5 billion years further than they can.</p>

<p>If we measure the total width of the two overlapping spheres we get a distance of 18 billion light years.</p>

<p>I now grasp my hair in confusion. Is this possible that two visible spheres could overlap to create a distance longer than the oldest ray of light? And from there I fall into more questions. Can two people measure the same universe age from different spots in the universe.</p>

"Does matter accumulate just outside the event horizon of a black hole?","<p>My understanding is that time slows and approaches stopping when approaching the event horizon of a black hole.  I have seen this explained several places, including a brief explanation in the last paragraph under: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole#General_relativity"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole#General_relativity</a>, quoted below:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Oppenheimer and his co-authors interpreted the singularity at the boundary of the Schwarzschild radius as indicating that this was the boundary of a bubble in which time stopped. This is a valid point of view for external observers, but not for infalling observers. Because of this property, the collapsed stars were called ""frozen stars"",[17] because an outside observer  would see the surface of the star frozen in time at the instant where its collapse takes it inside the Schwarzschild radius.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Does this mean then that no matter actually falls into a black hole (except possibly what was there at its formation)?  Would this also mean matter is accumulating just outside its event horizon?  As I understand it, this would be the perspective from outside the black hole.  If this is the case, I wonder if we would observe a tremendous amount of matter surrounding the event horizon, but it would be extremely red shifted?</p>

"How to calculate the integrated source flux density of a continuous source?","<p>I'm working with data from radio surveys. My images are .fits files with BUNIT Jy/beam. I want to calculate the net flux from a continuous source (not point source). When I simply added all the intensity values and converted it into Jy using the beam parameters, my professor said that it is not enough. He said, ""You have to account for noise by taking 3 or 4-sigma level depending on the distribution of the noise"". The distribution of noise (at places other than the source) is nearly Gaussian as I can see from a fits viewer.</p>

<p>By ""take 3-sigma level"", does he mean that I should fit a Gaussian to the noise, find sigma and then choose the pixels with intensity values greater than 3*sigma? If I do this, obviously I lose a lot of pixels. Also, if this is correct, should I subtract the mean of intensity of ""noise"" pixels from my source intensity?</p>

"Does Absolute Velocity Exist?","<p>It seems everyone is on the same page about there being no ""absolute velocity"" due to the fact that everything is relativistic. However, this leaves me confused.

But yet, the speed of light is a calculable constant that never changes. How then, can we say, there is no such thing as absolute speed?</p>

Am I doing things wrong or is this fine?</p>

"If you lived on the far side of the Moon, how could you infer the existence of Earth?","<p>Suppose that you deposit an astronomer, armed with our current knowledge of orbital mechanics, on a dome on the far side of the Moon, so that the Earth is perpetually hidden from them. </p>

<p>(And, of course, assume that this person has no specific knowledge about the system they're in beyond what they can glean from observations. If you will, imagine that they learned all our modern orbital mechanics and related physics in alpha centauri, and then got teleported to our Moon.)</p>

<p>Now, it is reasonable to expect that this person should be able to deduce from observations of the sky that the body they are on is one half of a binary system, and they should be able to measure the orbital characteristics (semi-major axis, ellipticity, inclination) as well as the  position of the barycentre (much closer to the other body, corresponding to a much more massive partner). What observations are needed to deduce this? What level of observational accuracy is needed for those observations, and to what historical epoch does it correspond to? (I.e. would Tycho Brahe's kit have been sufficient? Would Galileo's? Would the ancient Greeks'? Or would this require a late-19th-century (or even later) observatory?)</p>

<hr>

<p>(As pointed out in MartinV's answer, our astronomer might find it hard to distinguish between situations with an orbiting pair vs one single huge body. Thus, if convenient, you can assume that, via short ~100km forays from the dome, our astronomer is able to measure the lunar radius by measuring solar inclinations at different points with known distances between them, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_Earth#Hellenistic_astronomy"" rel=""noreferrer"">à la Erathostenes</a>.)</p>

"Should we not accommodate Ophiuchus also in Our Calendar?","<p>We have only 12 months in our calendar and only as many Zodiac signs as the number of months in a year. Now that we know there are 13 constellations should we not have 13 months in the calendar instead of 12 months and have 13 Zodiac Signs by adding a sign for Ophiuchus as well in the following manner? </p>

<p>If we have 13 months in a year, each month consisting of 28 days, we would have neat 4 weeks a month round the year which would obviously make life much easier. </p>

<p>But 13 months multiplied with 28 makes it only 364 days a year. So we would have to have one extra day besides 13 months each year. We may call it by any name. It could be even Xmas day or just any other day for a non-leap year. During leap years we would have to have two extra days instead of one day. </p>

<p>At present the period of Capricorn starts on Dec 22 and ends on Jan 19. Likewise other Zodiac periods also start from such staggered dates of various months and end on odd dates only. If we may have 13 months and may allow a year to start from Dec 22 instead of Jan 1 we would be able to resolve this anomaly also because then each Zodiac sign would begin on the 1st of each month and would end on the last day of each month only. </p>

<p>The way we switched over from the British system of miles, fathoms, yards,feet and inches to the metric system all over the world this reform would also obviously facilitate everybody's life enormously.  </p>

<p>So should we not set the ball rolling to reform our calendar as conceived by me?   </p>

<p>Deborah Houlding in her post “Understanding the Zodiac: and why there really are 12 zodiac signs” at <a href=""https://www.skyscript.co.uk/zodiac.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.skyscript.co.uk/zodiac.html</a> has mentioned:</p>

<p>""Ophiuchus is not a new constellation, it was catalogued with many others in Ptolemy's 2nd-century treatise, Almagest, (an astronomical text of huge historical standing), where it is referred to as Septentarius, ""the serpent holder"". It was always realised that the ecliptic cuts through a small part of this constellation, but it is a very large constellation, the majority of which the zodiac fails to embrace, so it was not considered a ""zodiac constellation""."" </p>

<p>They knew that there were as many as 17 constellations including Ophiuchus but had deliberately chosen only twelve of them because 360 degrees could have not been equally divided into `13 sections. It indirectly implies had there been 390 degrees in a circle they would have perhaps included Ophiuchus also. Why was it necessary to divide the circle into equal widths at all? Some Zodiacs were known to cover smaller sections than the others. They could have as well accommodated even all the 17 constellations by allotting them actual widths instead of equal widths as has been done now for 13 constellations. So we may say the fact that they thought of allotting equal widths to all Zodiacs was the main culprit. </p>

<p>Just have a look at the current distribution, shown below.</p>

<p>1 ARIES = APRIL 19 – MAY 13    … 25 days
2 TAURUS = MAY 14 – JUNE 19   …  37 days
3 GEMINI = JUNE 20 – JULY 20     … 31 days
4 CANCER = JULY 21 – AUG 9    …. 21 days
5 LEO = AUGUST 10 – SEPTEMBER 15   …  37 days<br>
6 VIRGO = SEPTEMBER 16 – OCTOBER 30    … 45 days
7 LIBRA = OCTOBER 31 – NOVEMBER 22   …  23 days 
8 SCORPIO = NOVEMBER 23 – NOVEMBER 29  … 7 days 
9 OPHIUCHUS = NOVEMBER 30 – DECEMBER 17  … 18 days 
10 SAGITTARIUS = DECEMBER 18 – JANUARY 18  … 31 days
11 CAPRICORN = JANUARY 19 – FEBRUARY 15   … 28 days
12 AQUARIUS = FEBRUARY 16 – MARCH 11    …  24 days (in non-leap years) and 25  days (in the leap years) 
13 PISCES = MARCH 12 – APRIL 18  ..  38 days</p>

<p>(Source: www.cool-story.com)</p>

<p>How nicely 365 days of the non-leap years and 366 days of the leap years have been assigned to the 13 Zodiacs? </p>

<p>However, as of now even if we had 13 sidereal months a year, each month of 28 days, each Zodiac would obviously not stretch over full month any way. So by having 28 days’ months and 13 months a year we would be benefited only to the extent that each month would have precisely 4 weeks while it is not so under the Gregorian calendar of 12 synodic months.   </p>

It has gotten a lot of press, but I haven't seen anything, even in the scientific paper that accompanied its release, that answers the first question that came to mind when I saw it : is this a view into the inside of Jupiter? I seem to recall seeing IR images of Jupiter where the poles appear quite hot, which would be consistent with a ""clear sky"" providing a view of deeper, hotter layers. But how deep can see in this picture?</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/MEfUb.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/MEfUb.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Edit: I am aware that this is a visible light image, and that visible light does not penetrate the cloud layer of Jupiter.</p>

<p>My question is whether part of the south pole of Jupiter is cloud-free, at least to a depth where atmospheric extinction limits our ability to see the clouds. This interpretation of the picture would assume that blue light penetrates deeper than red light into the atmosphere (clouds not included) of Jupiter, and that this is the reason that some of the clouds, presumed to be deeper, look blue, while some areas between them are essentially black.</p>

<p>Here is an example of a picture of Jupiter in IR, which shows the poles as being relatively hot. The troposphere of Jupiter (or any planet) is generally hotter the deeper you go, so the poles appearing hotter is consistent with less cloud cover at the poles. [<img src=""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2c/Thermal_emission_of_Jupiter.jpg"" alt=""description]""></p>

<p>I'm aware that perhaps no-one, including the Juno team, knows the answer to my question. Some useful partial answers would include an estimate of the depth to which visible light could penetrate Jupiter's atmosphere in the absence of clouds, and whether blue light would penetrate deeper than red.</p>

"Ideas about the origin of the ""black hole - galaxy mass"" relation?","<p>It has been extensively shown that the mass of black-holes located at the center of galaxies scales with several galaxy properties, most notably the stellar velocity dispersion of the stellar bulge, which is an indicator of stellar mass.
The origin of this relation remains controversial, and a leading candidate is AGN feedback. 
However, new studies (e.g., Woo et al. 2019; <a href=""https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.00145.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.00145.pdf</a>) show that the relation still exists on low-masses ranges (dwarf galaxies) where we do not expect AGN-feedback to be much significant.

"Could dark energy be negative gravity?","<p><strong>Main question:</strong> Could dark energy (the mysterious accelerating expansion of the universe) be explained by ""negative gravity""?  </p>

<p><strong>""Spin off"" questions:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Does antimatter have negative gravity?  </li>
<li>If antimatter has negative gravity, and is present in the universe with equal amounts of matter and antimatter, would it produce the observed amount of dark energy in the universe?</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>My theory that I am trying to validate:</strong></p>

<p>Gravity is the flow of space into matter, and it flows out of antimatter.  If this is true, antimatter should have ""negative gravity"", I would expect it to have a repelling effect, while matter has an attracting effect.  For example, if antimatter were on earth (somehow without annihilating), it would fall to the planet.  However, if there were an antimatter planet, objects would ""fall up"" off it.  In fact, I believe the antimatter planet would break apart because of this quality.  Furthermore, I don't believe antimatter planets or stars would form because of this quality (e.g. it would remain anti-hydrogen).  I also theorize that it would be in parts of the universe where matter isn't (e.g. in the voids outside the galactic clusters), and would be very diffuse (because it would repel itself).  I believe the theorized repelling effect of antimatter could be what we are observing as dark energy (hence why I am asking these questions).  I just searched for this online to see if anyone else has this theory, and yes, someone has something very similar here: <a href=""http://www.universetoday.com/84934/antigravity-could-replace-dark-energy-as-cause-of-universes-expansion/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.universetoday.com/84934/antigravity-could-replace-dark-energy-as-cause-of-universes-expansion/</a></p>

<p>** Edit **</p>

<p>It seems others have caught on and simulated the idea of negative mass as dark energy in the universe.  They have run simulations with equal mass and negative mass and ended up with a result that resembles the current universe!  They say negative mass might also explain dark matter!

"The laws of physics through out the universe","<p>How do we know laws of physics are the same throughout the universe? Intuitively I would say they would vary in two natural ways: the constants in the equations may vary or the math in the equations may vary. As a guess they could change over a long time. What is the furthest radius we can prove from earth, with absolute certainty, that the laws of physics do not vary? I am aware this may not be a radius but a more complex shape that cannot be simply described by a radius.</p>

<p>The nearest answer I can think of for a radius is a guess. And that guess is based on the furthest physics experiment we have done from earth. Which I think is an experiment with mirrors on the moon. Therefore if we assume (I don't know if this assumption is totally 100% reasonable) all physics laws hold because this experiment works. Then the radius is to the moon. This doesn't give an concrete answer for the radius, merely an educated guess.</p>

"Realistic space environments","<p>You've seen it in all kinds of science fiction, be it books, games, movies, and such. Space is depicted all sorts of ways, with asteroids far too close together, nebula thick enough to hide in and much more. Yet for a writer that want's to describe space accurately, this is a problem. </p>

<h2>So I need stellar features and reasons why they would form/exist</h2>

<p>Here's a rough list of what I'm talking about:</p>

<ul>
<li>Thick asteroid style fields, averaging around 100 meters apart</li>
<li>Nebula regions that are actually thick enough to obscure light, like clouds</li>
<li>Dust cloud regions thick enough to obscure light</li>
<li>Any other kind of cloud of material that's similar to the two above</li>
<li>Naturally occurring fields of explosive gas or a physical material that does the same</li>
<li>Radiation levels high enough to eat through ship plating</li>
<li>Naturally occurring anomalies of any sort, such as black holes, rogue planets and stars</li>
</ul>

<p>An example would be a protoplanetary disc. Could this allow for material in close proximity so you have rocks in orbit that are close together? What about clouds of material? Would a forming star would have a thick cloud of material around it?</p>

<p><strong>Anything naturally occurring or even unnaturally occurring is fine, so long as space magic or whatever isn't involved.</strong></p>

<p><strong>If I missed anything you can think of, please elaborate. This topic has been difficult for me to find information on.</strong></p>

"Dark Energy Expansion","<p>The new Cosmos extra features mentions that at about 6,771,500,000 years ago the universe began an accelerated expansion. How do we know this? What evidence do we have for this renewed and accelerated expansion?</p>

<p>From the interactive cosmic calendar on the new Cosmos bluray, dates above taken from the heading</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Until [now], gravity has been slowing the expansion of the universe,
  but suddenly a mysterious, unknown force that we call dark energy
  takes over, the expansion of the universe begins to accelerate</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How do we know it was dark energy? Given we can't define or detect dark energy, why do we believe this is the cause? How do we even know this new acceleration happened? Something in the red shift? Is there a gap in the red shift in things we can see that would imply a slow expansion and then a fast expansion? If there is a gap, why is dark energy the only explanation? Or are there other theories?</p>

<p>Yes that is a lot of questions, but the main question is <strong>how do we know an accelerated expansion happened at that time?</strong> the rest of the questions stem from that, mainly in asking for data to back up claims, for or against</p>

<p>Then I think a litle bit more. There is no exact boundry between large brown dwarf and small red dwarf stars. So, if we include them too, what is the most mass that matter likely to form ?</p>

<p>If it is inverse-square law, so graph between accumulate mass (y-axis) and mass (x-axis) will be y=c/x where c is constant.</p>

<p>And make the maximum is zero or mean that most of matter aren't form star. At this point, I think I should limit the minimum mass of forming object at some point. But is it inverse-square law for all type of forming object?</p>

<p>Given that Betelgeuse is only 640 light-years away from Earth, the question of whether we're talking about Betelgeuse going supernova in the next million years, or about <em>news of the supernova reaching us</em> in the next million years, is irrelevant, since 640 years is hardly noticeable when you're talking about ten thousand centuries. </p>

<p>We detected a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_pulsar"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">pulsar-pulsar binary</a> several decades ago. But if one of the pulsar does not radiate towards us, we may be not able to tell it is a pulsar or a black hole. If the companion is not a main sequence star, how do we know the nature of the companion in a neutron star binary?</p>

"Formation of stars","<p>How are stars formed?

"How early could life supporting planets been formed?","<p>In thinking about exclusion options for where its not worth to look for habitable planets, the past came to my mind.</p>

<p>Right at the beginning of the universe, there was no possibility for (carbon based) life supporting planets to form, simply because there was not enough material to do so.</p>

<p>Population III stars burnt out within millions of years to leave some of these elements, but was it enough to form planets? I have some problem getting things into perspective, considering that</p>

<ul>
<li>there are so many processes that produce different kinds and amounts of isotopes</li>
<li>these isotopes are spread out in various different ways (and thus also different concentrations from how they were created) throughout the interstellar medium</li>
<li>it takes probably a lot of time to gravitationally condense enough metals into a planet once it was spewed out from e.g. a super nova</li>
<li>the majority of stars are smaller so it would probably take a clustering of heavier stars to provide the conditions earlier in the universe.</li>
</ul>

<p>I would consider a similar distribution of metals like in earth as sufficient for life, and would concentrate only on those found in DNA (N,H,C,P,O), fats (C,H,O) and proteins (C,O,H,N) as well as most of the essential minerals (Ca,Cl,K,Na,Mg,P,S) and maybe at least a bunch of (possibly essential) trace elements (Co,Fe,I,Cu,Mn,Mo,Se,Zn,As,B,Cr,F,Rb,Te,V,Sn,Ni).</p>

<p>So what is the best approximation that we can currently give on when these elements were abundant enough to condense into earth like rocks with earth like elemental distribution?</p>

"Meaningful theories of the shape of the universe","<p>Normally, when people say <em>""the universe is infinite""</em> they generally mean something like ""the <em>observable universe is locally flat</em>, it is easy to assume that it is flat way beyond the observable universe, I don't know what lies beyond that, I won't talk about that, that is enough for practical purposes"" (or any other proposition implying infinity in any direction and assumed for simplicity's sake while actually focussing on a small region of the space, the observable universe). So, ""the universe is infinite"" does not seriously mean that physical space goes on forever because this simply makes no sense at all, ""infinite"" is not a number, it is not a magnitude, it is not a property of real things (if you disagree with this premise please explain how the notion of infinity can be seriously applied to any direction of physical space, i.e. how you can seriously think to extend, sic et simpliciter, such a property of your mathematical model to the real world). (Personally I don't think this should be counted as a theory of the shape of the universe at all).</p>

<p>On the contrary, <em>""the universe is finite and unbounded, compact, closed in all directions""</em> is indeed a meaningful and in principle acceptable theory because it can be thought, described, discussed for what it actually implies. Of course, we don't know what lies beyond the observable universe but the idea of a compact universe makes sense and it seems to me this is the only meaningful explanation currently available of what ""could"" be (it is not necessarily the <em>right, true</em> explanation, of course).</p>

"Extracting kinematics from stellar spectra. Why are template stellar spectra necessary?","<p>I am trying to understand how to extract stellar velocity and velocity dispersion maps from spectral cubes, but with no success so far. To be more precise, I do not understand why people use stellar spectra templates to do so.</p>

<p>For gas kinematics (e.g., Ha emission), the usual approach is to fit a Gaussian function to each spectrum. Then, the means and sigmas correspond to the line-of-sight velocities and velocity dispersions.</p>

<p>For stellar kinematics, most people use <code>pPXF</code>. To my understanding, in the simplest case, <code>pPFX</code> fits a parametric function (e.g., Gaussian) convolved with a template stellar spectrum to the data. Why is that? I tried to read the <code>pPFX</code> papers but there is no explanation for this. It assumes that the use of a template stellar spectrum is obvious and there is no justification for this. Actually the majority of papers that use <code>pPFX</code> assume that the use of a template is a de facto thing and provide no explanation.</p>

<ul>
<li>What is the rationale behind using a template stellar spectrum?</li>
<li>Why can't we just use an inverted Gaussian and fit that to the absorption line of each spectrum?</li>
</ul>

<p>After some more reading, some papers imply (but do not explicitly say it) that the absorption lines of stellar spectra have complex shapes that can't be modeled with a simple Gaussian. But that is also the case for emission lines! Emission lines can be asymmetric due to multiple kinematic components or beam smearing. Yet, nobody uses templates when extracting kinematic maps from them. I do understand that fitting a single Gaussian to an asymmetric emission line can result in loss of information. But why is this acceptable for emission lines and not acceptable for absorption lines?</p>

"Is there a flaw with the newer purposes and correlations attributed to the HR diagram? (And would a third axis of mass correct the enclosed flaw?)","<p>When I was younger, I was looking at HR diagrams, and began to experiment with the HR diagram. </p>

<p>I was looking at plotting different groups of stars on the HR diagram when I found RV Tauri stars.</p>

<p>These are stars between 0.4 and 9 solar masses; they have reached the end of their ""life"" and the fusion shell of such a swollen star is advancing towards its surface (when it hits, the planetary nebula starts to form), thus its heats up and swells further. This phase occurs after the Asymptotic Giant Branch/Red Clump phases (AGB for high-metallicity stars, RC for low-metallicity stars).</p>

<p>Taking into account the above information, RV Tauri stars are BOTH more luminous and hotter at the surface than red giants (and AGB/RC stars), they should appear to the upper-left of the latter of the aforementioned groups (given the inversion of the temperature axis). All seemed well.</p>

<p>But then I saw this:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/AsJVE.jpg"" alt=""Additional correlations""></p>

<p>My knowledge of astrophysics tells me that due to stellar winds and the equation E=MC^2, a star's mass (after ""birth"") will usually decrease over time (unless receiving matter from another star). But if RV Tauri stars are above and to the left of red giants, it means that according to the graph, an increase in mass occurs every time a star migrates to the RV Tauri stage.</p>

<p>I know that all graphs have their limitations, but in my mind it was wrong to claim that these correlations were set in stone. Only axes could ever display data in a perfect way (they treat different units of data as separate simple measures, not ""more unstable"" compound measures). So I added a third axis of mass (as this is whole problem is to do with plotting the evolutionary ""tracks"" of stars); this is what is known to affect stellar evolution to the greatest extent. Here is what I came up with:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/GSrH1.png"" alt=""3DHRD""></p>

<p>I did this in order to show that the HR diagram shows general trends of stars (not the evolutionary ones that scientists claim).</p>

<p><strong>My question:</strong></p>

<p>Was this a valid flaw with the HR diagram - and if so, is mass the best axis to add to it?</p>

<p>--EDIT--</p>

<p>The HR diagram is not flawed, I respect that. I also know that there will always be outliers. But the extra correlation of mass seems to be too flawed for that (as detailed above). My new question: is the attribution of these extra correlations wrong?</p>

"Are Saros series separated by ""40"" in numbering related in any way?","<p>Can anyone help with this question? My question arose from an eclipse related observation that I made while looking into lunar Saros series 129. It is the Saros series number for the lunar eclipse that occurred on this past July 27, 2018. </p>

<p>First I saw that this Saros 129 series was ""born"" June 10, 1351 and the series will end June 24, 2613 (70 saros cycles of 18 years = roughly 1260 years). So, I became curious to see if another Saros series had ended just before Saros 129 began. I saw that Saros 89 (less by 40 in series numbering) had ended just four years earlier on July 23, 1347. Investigating further, I learned that there are roughly 40 different Saros series that are ""active"" at any one given time. So then I looked back further to lunar Saros 49 and observed that there does indeed seem to be a pattern involving roughly ""40"" less in the numbering (i.e. yes indeed, series 49 also ended just as series 89 began). These observations do seem to me as more than mere coincidences.</p>

<p><strong>So, my question now is - Are these particular lunar Saros series (<em>separated by ""40"" in numbering</em>) related in any way? - series 49, 89, and 129. Is there another cycle or a ""greater"" cycle also at work here that I am unaware of?</strong> </p>

<p>Please see the comments below if what I am asking seems unclear - my comments might rephrase the question for clarity.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Edit</strong> - I checked several other Saros series numbers separated by 40. I am adding additional information below - hoping that it might help find an answer to this question about relatedness of the ""40
  apart"" series.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Checking other series spaced by 40 numbering, these Saros series (that are numbered 40 apart – i.e. 40, 80, 120 etc.) always contain eclipses that are separated by <strong>~1418 days</strong> between eclipses in each respective series (i.e. exactly 4 lunar years/48 lunar months).</p>

<p><strong>Small Saros series</strong> (those containing fewer cycles - i.e. 70-74 saros cycles in the series) contain saros cycles that <strong>overlap minimally</strong> (Saros 129 which is only <strong>70 eclipse cycles in length has no overlap</strong> and began just after Saros 89 came to an end <strong>1418 days earlier</strong>). Note - zero eclipse cycles between them overlap.</p>

<p><strong>Large Saros series</strong> (those containing more cycles – i.e. 80-84 saros cycles in the series) contain saros cycles that <strong>overlap accordingly</strong> (Saros 120 which is 83 cycles long thus began 13 cycles before Saros 80 came to an end with the overlapping eclipses each gapped <strong>by 1418 days</strong>). Note - 13 eclipse cycles overlap accordingly - again about <strong>70 eclipse cycles with no overlap</strong> between these series.</p>

<p>It seems like about 70 eclipse cycles (constituting ~1262 solar years or ~1300 lunar years) is the standard length of each adjacent Saros series – considering the <strong>non-overlapping portion only</strong> – each non-overlapping portion separated by 4 lunar years.</p>

"What causes the raise of temperature in the outer layer of a red giant when the core gets contracted?","<p>A star emits energy through the fusion of hydrogen to helium in the core through the proton proton cycle or the carbon nitrogen cycle. Over time, hydrogen in the core is increasingly burned, which causes the fusion process to decrease over time. As a result, the star cools down and decreases the radiation pressure in the core. As a result, the core draws a little more together under the influence of its own weight, which increases the temperature. This temperature rise leads to a hydrogen fusion in a shell outside the core.</p>

"How does gradual crossing over of the Roche limit transform a planet or moon?","<p>Some cartoon simulations (<a href=""https://youtu.be/r_m7VgVSBoM?t=1863"">an example</a>) of an object (assume here a large moon with Earth-like density) which crosses the Roche limit of a much more massive giant planet, illustrate a circle suddenly disintegrating and forming a ring. But such a process occurs gradually over geological time scales. I doubt that there would be a single bad day when the whole moon disintegrates (as in <em>-Oh, there Mt. Everest broke off and flew away!</em>)</p>

<p>Wouldn't the tidal tugging cause volcanism and gradually melt the moon as its (somewhat eccentric) orbit spirals inwards across the limit during millions of years?</p>

<p>How would the melting moon deform? Would it really assume an oval shape, elongated towards the primary planet? Since the near side wants to orbit faster than the far side, wouldn't that cause the moon to spin at an accelerated rate, even if it initially was tidally locked? Would the melting, deforming and spinning save it from disintegrating further to within the Roche limit?</p>

<p>Some examples of Roche limit crossings I know of:</p>

<ul>
<li>Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 may have broken up suddenly because it had
such a high velocity relative to Jupiter.</li>
<li>Phobos will cross its Roche limit to Mars in ~50 million years. It
will hardly be a sudden process. I suppose its very low density and
mass won't allow any volcanism and melting, though.</li>
<li><a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.4080"">KOI1843.03</a>, an exoplanet candidate with a density of ~7 g/cm³,
is already inside the Roche limits for its less dense compounds which
it has shed (as I interpret it).</li>

"When the Moon formed and early on, did it orbit over the Earth's equator?","<p>Or was it always at about 5.14 degrees inclination or has the inclination changed over time?</p>

<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit_of_the_Moon#/media/File:Earth-Moon.PNG"" rel=""noreferrer"">See diagram</a>.</p>

<p>James K's answer to <a href=""https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/questions/22830/view-of-moon-from-south-pole"">this question</a> got me thinking about this, and I don't mean to call him out, but this part of his answer doesn't seem quite right when he wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our moon is unique in being close to the plane of the ecliptic, and
  not in the plane of the equator, which suggests its formation was not
  like that of other moons in the solar system.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For starters, I imagine the physics of the initial orbit of an impact moon would be somewhat complicated, but it seems likely, given an angled impact like the one that's believed to have formed our moon (and hitting at an angle is statistically more common than a direct impact anyway), </p>

<p>So, in this scenario, the planet gets significant angular momentum and this angular momentum should dictate the planet's new equator and axial tilt relative to it's orbit.  I would think the moon should form roughly along that same equatorial plane, but I'm just guessing.   Perhaps it could form several degrees off - not sure.</p>

<p>The 2nd point, is, a rapidly rotating planet with a large equatorial bulge and a close moon, if the Moon formed off the equator, would it's orbit migrate over the equator where the gravitation was greatest and would that happen relatively quickly or not at all?</p>

<p>That's basically the question.   Was the Moon always at roughly 6 degrees off the Earth's equator or has it only moved off an orbit over Earth's equator more recently, perhaps due to the gravitational effect of the Sun?    </p>

<p>Or are there other factors.   Mars' axis is thought to have changed rather significantly due to Jupiter's gravitational effects perhaps 100,000 years agao and it's Moons orbit over Mars' equator which suggests that Mars' equatorial bulge dragged the Moons with it? - or is my thinking way off on that?</p>

<p>My thinking is that a planet's equatorial bulge would drive moons towards a 0 degree inclination around it's equatorial bulge and our Moon is different because of proximity to the sun which also has a strong gravitational effect.   The 5.14 degrees of inclination is a balance between the Earth's equator and the solar gravity.</p>

"Instrument aperture sizes on Hubble Telescope","<p>When looking at the diagram of the focal plane of the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_Space_Telescope"" rel=""noreferrer"">Hubble Space Telescope</a> I noticed that the aperture sizes of most of the scientific instruments are very small. They occupy a very tiny fraction of the focal plane.</p>

<p>I understand that for a spectrograph (like the <a href=""http://www.spacetelescope.org/about/general/instruments/cos/"" rel=""noreferrer"">COS</a>) you need a very small aperture to look at point sources. But why the <a href=""http://www.spacetelescope.org/about/general/instruments/acs/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Advanced Cmaera for Surveys</a> or <a href=""http://www.spacetelescope.org/about/general/instruments/wfc3/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Wide Field Camera 3</a> also have so small apertures? Most of the focal plane is not used and it must be very tedious for the guidance system to move the target object exactly into the small aperture of the selected instrument. Even though the WFC3 is called ""wide field"", its field of view is <a href=""http://www.stsci.edu/hst/wfc3/documents/handbooks/currentIHB/c03_optimum_instr4.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">less than 3 arc minutes</a>.</p>

<p>What were the reasons behind selecting these aperture sizes? Is HST designed to observe details of small targets? Are the sizes optimized for majority of observations?</p>

<p>On the other hand the HST is taking images of large objects like nebulae and usually it is necessary to stitch a number of individual frames to create the whole image of a bigger object.

I mean, 100 years ago, one could assume that life originating on Mars and then being sent this was was ridiculous and impossible but now it's a rational, viable theory.</p>

<p>Considering such a scenario, how would scientist verify that these life-forms didn't originate from Earth, rather than Mars?  It seems to me that this question is the first question that would need to be asked and answered after the fossil-records were found and verified.</p>

"Cause of ~10 minute Oscillations in Low Energy Electron Flux in Earth's Magnetosphere","<p>I am analyzing data from an instrument that measures low energy electron flux at Geo-Stationary orbit.  There are sharp oscillations in the particle flux of 30 eV electrons occurring from about noon to 8 pm (space-craft local).

However, due to different optical phenomenon, the size of Sun seen on surface of Pluto could be larger. Can it can be estimated from the annular eclipse <a href=""http://www.slate.com/blogs/bad_astronomy/2015/07/24/pluto_ice_flows_and_a_ring_of_light.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Sun-Pluto eclipse</a> picture or other pictures taken by New Horizons probe ?

<p>Edit: From the answer given by @Conrad Turner below, Sun should be just pin point at that distance. However, when seen by New Horizons probe from behind Pluto, its size is seen to be almost as large as Pluto. The atmosphere of Pluto must be bending the light so much to make this happen. </p>

<p>Update: This picture was taken from a distance of <a href=""http://www.slate.com/blogs/bad_astronomy/2015/07/24/pluto_ice_flows_and_a_ring_of_light.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">2 million km</a> from Pluto. At this distance Sun will have an angular size of 0'49"" (distance 5804550000 km, diameter 1392000 km), while Pluto has the angular size of 4'5"" (distance 2000000 km, diameter 2372 km). However, the picture is showing Sun to have an angular size slightly larger than Pluto (or nearly the same size). Hence, high refraction or scattering or some other phenomenon are at work here. </p>

<p>Considering sizes and distances, if atmosphere of Pluto does nothing to light, the ring of Sun should have been visible around Pluto once probe was 10 million km beyond Pluto. However, the ring of Sun is seen in this picture when probe is  only 2 million km beyond Pluto. The scientists must have known the optical characteristics of Pluto's atmosphere and hence they got the probe early in proper position to take this picture. </p>

<p>Second premise: I'm Italian so please excuse any mistake</p>

<p>So, I'm writing a story about a fast and cataclysmic climate change. Obviously there are some artistic licenses but I would like nothing in my story to be completely impossible, only (at most) very unlikely. </p>

<p>The climate change that I would like to include in my story is very extreme, so I had to discard any terrestrial forcing to cause it (no change of ocean currents, supervolcanoes and methane eruptions) because they could not act fast enough and would not be so catastrophic (compared to what I imagine). So I focused on astronomical forcing. I excluded the impossibly forcing (for example, a magical and radical reduction in solar luminosity) and those that would be more catastrophic than the climate change itself (i.e. a planetary impact).</p>

<p>The last possible (though very very unlikely) option I have left is a dramatic change in the Earth's orbit. I have some knowledge in physics and astronomy so I did a personal search to figure out what could cause such an orbital change.The most plausible option would be to pass a rogue planet (or star) into the solar system, but since I want to complicate my life, I would like the orbital change to happen without any notice, which is quite impossible if it is the passage of a planet or a star in the solar system to cause it. </p>

<p>The only plausible explanations I have found to fully satisfy my scenario are either the passage of a primordial black hole in the solar system (a black hole with Jupiter's mass would have a schwarzschild radius of 2.8 meters and, if it did not come in direct contact with some celestial body, it may take in the solar system without notice) or passing a high-density cluster of dark matter (assuming an self-interacting form of dark matter) near or inside the solar system. Both are immensely unlikely options and very speculative (primordial black holes are hypothetical objects and we still have no idea what the dark matter really is and how it behaves) but I do not think they are impossible in the beginning, or is it wrong?</p>

<p>Assuming I want to move the Earth 2x10^7 km (if I do not mistake at this distance the average temperature of the planet would be between 15 and 18 ° C lower than now) farther from the sun, could this change take place in less than a decade and the earth's orbit would remain stable or simply the planet would be expelled from the solar system?</p>

Theoretically, what size of the primary mirror (single/multiple/segmented) can have a telescope on Earth for observing at optical wavelengths? And why? I mean what are physical limitations exists?</p>

<p>And the same question about space (not on Earth)?</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>On the advice of @TildalWave, to make this question answerable let's make a few adjustments:</p>

<ol>
<li>Primary mirror should be segmented (or it variations) like on E-ELT.</li>
<li>Suppose we have a large (several square kilometers), flat surface high above sea level.</li>
<li>We have to build telescope for observing at optical wavelengths.</li>
</ol>

<p>I know that, there is concept of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overwhelmingly_Large_Telescope"">OWL</a> with 100 metre-diameter segmented primary mirror.</p>

<p>But what about 500 metre-diameter or 1000? Is it possible in theory?</p>

"pp-Chain reactions involving $^{3}_{2}He$ - differences in S-factor","<p>So I was looking at the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton%E2%80%93proton_chain_reaction"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">pp-chain</a> reactions that take place inside stars in a bit more detail.<br>
I got confused about the massive differences in reaction efficiencies concerning two reactions $^{3}_{2}He$.<br>
In the lecture notes I've googled (the ones that I've understood best so far), the reaction<br>
$$^{3}_{2}He + ^{3}_{2}He \rightarrow p + p + ^{4}_{2}He$$
has an efficiency factor $S_1 \approx 6MeV-barn$ and being quoted as 'strong reaction'.</p>

<p>While the other reaction I'm confused about in contrast is 
$$^{3}_{2}He + ^{4}_{2}He \rightarrow ^{7}_{4}Be + \gamma$$
with a way lower reaction probability of $S_2 \approx 4\cdot 10^{-4} Mev-barn$ and being quoted as 'electromagnetic interaction'.</p>

<p><strong>So my question</strong>: How can we understand the huge discrepancy between $S_1$ and $S_2$? Particularly, when is a reaction a 'strong' interaction?<br>
Isn't the strong force necessarily always involved, else there wouldn't be a potential minimum in the nucleus to tunnel to...</p>

<p>Note: The S-Factor is just a part of the velocity dependent reaction cross-section $\sigma(v)$ so that $\sigma(E) = \frac{exp(-\tau)}{E} S(E)$. Here $\tau$ is the tunneling probability from Quantum theory.</p>

<p>I would also appreciate any good textbook reference, as so far I'm working with google and random lecture notes I'm finding.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong><br>
Thoughts on this:<br>
In both cases particles must tunnel towards each other first. Also we know that $^{4}_{2}He$ is a bound state for the nuclear force.<br>
So what might be happening is that in $^{3}_{2}He + ^{3}_{2}He$ the nuclei rearrange themselves into the energetically favoured bound state, kicking out the surplus protons.<br>
In the case of $^{3}_{2}He + ^{4}_{2}He$ the bound state already exists, and thus in most cases the reaction will be reversed. Only a few of those reactions (why?) allow the spontaneous formation of a higher-shell object like $ ^{7}_{4}Be$, thus the much lower reaction rate.<br>
If this story so far makes sense, then I still don't understand when and why  $^{7}_{4}Be$ is formed, I'd be grateful for explanation.</p>

<p>The Hubble telescope is probably a reasonable comparison for my purposes. I found images Hubble took of Mars during a close approach, but I don't know if those represent the best resolution possible or simply the resolution that was selected or available at the time, or indeed, if the whole planet was imaged at a higher resolution than the photo published in popular media outlets.</p>

"Is an expanding universe equivalent to a universe in which everything is shrinking?","<p>Why do we always think of the universe as expanding? </p>

<p>Surely, from our perspective an expanding universe would look exactly the same as a universe in which everything is shrinking away from everything else? <em>""Oh, but the red shift!""</em> I hear people exclaim. Well how about this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The speed of light is simply slowing down.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hear me out. If the speed of light is a measuring stick against which all things are measured, and if the speed of light is slowing down, then it means everything shrinks and high frequency waves generated in the past are observed with a lower frequency today, which causes us to make observations that the universe is expanding.</p>

<p>What is wrong with my alternative?</p>

<p>Given this, if the speed of light were experiencing, say, exponential decay, wouldn't we <strong>expect</strong> to see the universe's 'expansion' accelerating? (which I thought was a relatively new and profound discovery)</p>

"Where did the Sun get hydrogen to work with if it is in the 3rd generation of stars?","<p>As I see <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_population#Population_I_stars"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>, the Sun belongs to the Population I group of stars, which is the 3rd generation of the stars in our universe. 1st generation stars are Population III, 2nd generation are Population II, and 3rd generation are Population I.</p>

<p>When the 1st generation (Population III) of stars died, that means most of the hydrogen was burned to helium. Stars die when there is no hydrogen left. Later, the 2nd generation of stars (Population II) appeared and they fuse another portion of hydrogen into heavier elements.</p>

<p>If 1st and 2nd star generations burned hydrogen to helium and more heavier elements, then shouldn't like 90% of all universe hydrogen already be converted to helium and something else? If yes, then there should not be enough hydrogen to make the Sun.</p>

<h2>UPDATE 1</h2>

<p>Thanks for all your answers. They are very useful. Now a new subquestion appeared.
When the star dies, like our Sun, it sends out external layers and core becomes white/other dwarf. In this case, new star can be formed only from the hydrogen from the external layer. The questions what is the percentage of initial star hydrogen after burning it to helium goes from this external layer to outer space?</p>

"How to deal with the celestial meridian?","<p>The book “Foundations of Astrophysics” by Ryden and Peterson states that one measures azimuth in the horizontal coordinate system eastwards starting on the northernmost point of the horizon circle. Thus, east becomes 90 degrees, et cetera. Wikipedia and other sites back this up.</p>

<p>However, it seems as if the position of the vernal equinox is always given relative to the southern part of an observer’s celestial meridian. During the vernal equinox, the sun culminates in the south, setting the siderial time to 0h0min. Knowing the difference between the local siderial time and a star’s right ascension gives you the current position of a star, relative to the southern half of the celestial meridian.</p>

I’m not complaining: stars culminate in the south, so this makes it easier. But where did we switch? And when must I switch? Did I make a mistake somewhere?</p>

"Reshaping black holes to ""push"" the event horizon","<p>I watched this simulation made by LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory) where 2 black holes merge into one.</p>

<p>I was therefore thinking that theoretically nothing can escape a black hole given the features of the space and the black hole remain the same due to the strong gravity.</p>

<p>However, I was thinking if 2 black holes stay together close enough, the ""event horizon"" would reshape as well.</p>

<p>We all know the gravity force is F=G(Mm/r^2).</p>

<p>Given a point next to the event horizon but ""inside"" the black hole the gravity there will be so strong that the Escape velocity will be higher than C (speed of light).</p>

<p>If we place another massive object (like another blackhole in the proximities of this point, but far enough, the gravity there will be counteracted and therefore this point will be able to escape its black hole, reshaping the event horizon and making it smaller. (We will have created a ""concavity"" in the event horizon)</p>

<p>My question is:</p>

<p>Given a hypothetical scenario where we create thousands of micro blacholes orbiting the main blackhole, in a gravitational equlibrium. Would we be able to reshape and ""push"" the event horizon strong enough that objects inside could now use the chance and escape?</p>

"What can the total stellar mass of galaxies tell us?","<p>The total stellar mass of a galaxy cannot be measured directly. Astronomers can infer it from the galaxy spectrum by stellar population synthesis. However, since high-mass stars dominate the spectrum but contribute little to the total stellar mass, the inferred total stellar mass is sensitive to initial mass function (IMF) which is usually assumed a priori. One can also measure the total stellar mass by kinematics, but it is the total mass of stars, dark matter and gas enclosed that is measured in this way, and we still need some assumptions (say, on the dark matter profile) to obtain the total STELLAR mass. In a word, it's very difficult to measure the total stellar mass of a galaxy precisely. </p>

<p>So I wonder why people are still interested in this parameter. What can it tell us about the formation and evolution of galaxies? </p>

<p>It seems that what can be measured relatively more accurately is the properties of high-mass stars which are also the main sources of stellar feedback and metal enrichment.

"Can the period of the planet transit across the sun be calculated in the same way the eclipse year is?","<p>I read from <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eclipse_cycle"" rel=""noreferrer"">Wikipedia$-$Eclipse cycle</a> that the eclipse year, which is the period of Earth's hitting a certain node of its orbit around the sun, that is, the ecliptic, and the moon's orbit around Earth, can be calculated as the beat period of the synodic month and draconic month. The recent occurrence of planet transits across the sun lets me wonder if this principle can be applied to the case of a planet's transit across the sun as seen by an observer on another planet in an outer orbit.</p>

<p>When Venus transited across the sun on June 6, 2012, I read it takes place in pattern of the 8-year-interval pairs with each pair at the interval of 105.5 years and 121.5 years alternately, with one in each pair being when Venus crosses the ecliptic plane at its ascending node and the other being when Venus crosses the ecliptic plane at its descending node. This made me contemplate whether the period of the Venus transit across the sun when it crosses the ecliptic plane at its certain node can be calculated in the way the eclipse year is, that is, whether the following holds: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The period of the Venus transit across the sun as it crosses the
  ecliptic plane at its certain node = The beat period of the period of Venus'
  being in inferior conjunction with the sun and the period of Venus'
  hitting that node.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Early this July I read from <a href=""http://earthsky.org/astronomy-essentials/earth-transit-from-pluto-july-12-2018"" rel=""noreferrer"">EarthSky</a> an observer on Pluto may, through some optical aid, be able to see Earth transiting the sun on July 12, when Pluto was at opposition, which, together with the upcoming event, that on October 24, 2018 Pluto will cross the ecliptic plane at its descending node, is responsible for the Earth transit as seen from Pluto. Last time this kind of transit occurred on January 11, 1931 on account of both that Pluto was at opposition that day and that Pluto crossed the ecliptic plane at its ascending node on September 9, 1930. And next time this kind of transit will occur when Pluto is at opposition 161 years later, around when Pluto will cross the ecliptic plane at the same node it crossed in 1930. This makes me again contemplate whether what follows holds: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The period of the Earth transit across the sun as seen from Pluto as
  Pluto crosses the ecliptic plane at its certain node = The beat period of the
  period of Pluto's being at opposition and the period of Earth's
  hitting that node.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think the principal difference between the eclipse year and planet transit across the sun is that in the former case both the moon and the sun are in a closed orbit around Earth while in the latter case only the sun is in a closed orbit around the observer-sited planet (the transiting planet is in a tortuous path from the perspective of the observer). I don't know if this feature would affect the applicability of the beat-period principle. If the principle of beat period as it used to calculate the eclipse year can be applied to the above two examples, I think it should be able to be generally applied to calculate the period of any planet's transit across the sun as seen by an observer on an outer planet, right? That is, should what follows generally hold? </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The period of a planet's transit across the sun as seen from an outer
  planet as it crosses the outer planet's orbit plane at its certain node =
  The beat period of the period of the transiting planet's being in
  inferior conjunction with the sun from the outer planet's perspective
  and the period of the transiting planet’s hitting that node</p>

For example, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observable_universe"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">observable universe</a> according to wikipedia has diameter 93 billion light-years. What will happen with photon after 93 billion years if I generate it now? Will it return back to me? Or it will never reach the ""edge"" of the universe because the universe is expanding faster?</p>

<h2>UPDATE 1</h2>

<p>Of course, I assume that photon will no be absorbed :) because it is just a theoretical thinking. And return back I mean not exactly to the same point, but approximately within some range (let say 5% of the universe size).</p>

<p>Do I correctly understand that there are a few options for the case when the universe is finite (means ""closed geometry""): </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Photon will never return back because the universe will collapse before it (in case if there are no dark energy).</p></li>
<li><p>Photon will never return back because universe expanding faster than light speed.</p></li>
<li><p>Photon will come back because universe expanding slower than light. And what 
of these 3 options is most probable from a current scientists point of view?</p></li>

"Why do our clocks not go out of sync with the day over a year?","<p>Ok, so our clocks time 24 hours, our planet takes 24 hours to rotate completely and our planet revolves around the sun in 365 days. </p>

<p>Imagine at the start of the year, the side of Earth facing Sol is 'Side A' and the dark side is 'Side B'. The side of the sun that Earth sees is 'Side A' and the opposite side is 'Side B'.</p>

<p>After half a year, wouldn't 'Side B' of Earth be facing 'Side B' of Sol, and thus the day/night cycle would be out of sync by 12 hours?</p>

<p>I've been trying to get my head around this problem for ages and I can't seem to figure it out. It seems like the angle that the sun hits the Earth must change by about a degree per day until it's gone around 360 degrees. Would that not mean the clocks offset by 1/365th of 24 hours every day over a year?</p>

"How often do stars pass close (~1ly) to the Sun?","<p>Interstellar exchange of massive objects is difficult across several light years.

Presumably binaries are <em>formed</em> as pairs, or team up while still in the birth cluster.</p>

<p>It seems quite plausible that an aged star (or stellar reminant) can be paired with a main sequence star in its prime, having paired up well <em>after</em> the old supernova was completed.</p>

<p><strong>Is this mechanism of multi-body reassortment known to occur, presumed, or thought to not occur?</strong></p>

<p>Another mechanism <em>implied</em> but not detailed in popular works is the possible situation with Proxima Centauri: a star going with the flow in the galaxy may find itself loosly attached to another star (or system), and this bond is so tenuous that it can easily be broken by <em>another</em> passing star, so the distant star <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do-si-do"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">do-si-do</a>s to different partners over the course of billions of years.  <strong>Is this an accurate depiction of the real situation?</strong>  This loose attachment out of the general flow can occur with stars of any mass, right?</p>

<p>In any case, a star can be captured <em>with planets</em>, right?  Naturally a close-enough encounter between stars (and reminants) could seriously disrupt a planetary system, but I want to check on the possibility that capture with planets is also a possibility.  I think that’s not a problem for the “loose attachment” case, and Proxima Cen may indeed have a planet.  How about the necessary mechanics of binary reassortment?  Is that necessarily so close and tight thatbplanets would be seriously disrupted, or is it plausible that planets would simply go along for the ride?</p>

Several all-sky cameras recorded it as well as a special radio beacon set up to capture radio signatures of meteors - the BRAMS beacon at Dourbes, Belgium.</p>

<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZA02d.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZA02d.png"" alt=""BRAMS radio spectrogram from Ophain""></a>
The orange blob in the center is the radio signature of this fireball.
The horizontal line is the beacon signal (0 Hz), time runs horizontally, frequency runs vertically, positive above and negative below the beacon line.
What is displayed are Doppler shifts.</p>

<p>The track for this fireball has been computed since and relative to the radio receiver at Ophain and radio beacon at Dourbes it is receding from both.
However, the Doppler blob is above the beacon line which is only possible when the fireball recedes from Ophain but approaches the beacon, approaches both, or approaches Ophain but recedes from the beacon - NOT when it recedes from both!</p>

<p>The only way I can make sense out of this is to assume that the ionized
gas trail from the fireball reflecting the radiowaves was NOT receding from the receiver and transmitter beacon - only the fireball was?!</p>

<p><span class=""math-container"">$$\frac{dr}{dt} = -\left(1 - \frac{r_s}{r}\right)\left(\frac{r_s}{r}\right)^{1/2}c $$</span></p>

<p>If we assume ”<span class=""math-container"">$r$</span>” to be the real radial distance and not just the ”r-parameter of Schwarzschild coordinates” this is the velocity <span class=""math-container"">$v$</span>. I want to know the expression for the acceleration as a function of ”<span class=""math-container"">$r$</span>” and ”<span class=""math-container"">$v$</span>” for a small object of mass <span class=""math-container"">$m&lt;&lt;M$</span> moving purely radially inwards or outwards from a compact spherically symmetric mass distribution in the general case.</p>

<p>By taking the derivative with respect to ""r"" of the expression above I get:
<span class=""math-container"">$$\frac{dv}{dr}=\frac{0.5}{r}{\sqrt{\frac{r_s}{r}}(1-\frac{3r_s}{r})}c$$</span></p>

<p>From these two expressions we see that the maximum velocity is <span class=""math-container"">$v=\frac{2}{3\sqrt{3}}c$</span> at <span class=""math-container"">$r=3r_s$</span>. From this finding, <span class=""math-container"">$\frac{dv}{dt}$</span> should not be so hard but this will not be a general expression but only the acceleration of something dropped from rest at infinity. In Schwarzschild coordinates the radial velocity of light goes as <span class=""math-container"">$v_{light}=c(1-r_s/r)$</span>. At <span class=""math-container"">$r=3r_s$</span> this becomes <span class=""math-container"">$v_{light}=2c/3$</span> so when falling in from being at rest at infinity you reach maximal velocity when <span class=""math-container"">$v/v_{light}=1/\sqrt{3}$</span>. Maybe you can say that gravitation becomes repulsive whenever you are travelling towards the center of the gravitational field faster than <span class=""math-container"">$1/\sqrt{3}$</span> times the local speed of light?</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>: What does the general expression for the acceleration of an object in coordinate time look like for an object moving purely radially inwards/outwards from the center of the gravitational field assuming a spherically symmetric non-spinning mass distribution and that the r-parameter of the Schwarzschild coordinates is the real physical distance?</p>

<p>I am looking for an expression for the instantaneous acceleration as a function of ""r"" and ""v"". </p>

<p>This is based upon a first order expansion of the Schwarzshild solution in isotropic coordinates. For pure radial infall you get:</p>

<p><span class=""math-container"">$$\frac{d\bar{v}}{dt}=-\frac{GM}{r^2}\left(1-\frac{4GM}{rc^2}-3\frac{v^2}{c^2}\right)\hat{r} $$</span> which becomes repulsive whenever you are approaching the central mass faster than: </p>

<p><span class=""math-container"">$$v=\frac{c}{\sqrt{3}}\sqrt{1-\frac{4GM}{rc^2}}$$</span></p>

<p>I am hoping for an exact solution for pure radial acceleration in ""Schwarzschild coordinate space"" and coordinate time similar to the approximate solution for pure radial acceleration you can get from the Nasa equation.</p>

<hr>

<p>As per the answer by amateurAstro down below the expression should be:</p>

<p><span class=""math-container"">$$\frac{dv}{dt}=-\frac{GM}{r^2}\left(1-2\frac{v^2}{c^2(1-\frac{2GM}{rc^2})}-\frac{v^2}{c^2(1-\frac{2GM}{rc^2})^2}\right)$$</span></p>

<p>This is consistent with stuffing:</p>

<p><span class=""math-container"">$$\gamma=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{2GM}{rc^2}-\frac{v^2}{c^2\left((1-\frac{2GM}{rc^2})(\hat{r}\cdot\hat{v})^2+|\hat{r}\times\hat{v}|^2\right)}}}\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{2GM}{rc^2}}}$$</span></p>

<p>into</p>

<p><span class=""math-container"">$$\frac{d(m\gamma\bar{v})}{dt}=-\frac{GMm\gamma}{r^2}$$</span></p>

<p>to get (at least this is true for pure radial and pure non-radial motion):</p>

<p><span class=""math-container"">$$\frac{d\bar{v}}{dt}=-\frac{GM}{r^2}\left(\hat{r}-2\frac{v^2(\hat{r}\cdot\hat{v})\hat{v}}{c^2(1-\frac{2GM}{rc^2})} -\frac{v^2(\hat{r}\cdot\hat{v})\hat{v}}{c^2(1-\frac{2GM}{rc^2})^2}\left((\hat{v}\cdot\hat{r})^2+(1-\frac{2GM}{rc^2}-\frac{v^2}{c^2})|\hat{v}\times\hat{r}|^2\right)\right)$$</span>.</p>

"What point does Earth actually orbit?","<p>If we consider the two largest masses in our solar system - the Sun and Jupiter, by themselves, they will orbit a common barycenter which is somewhere offset from the Sun's center in the direction of Jupiter (just above the Sun's surface). If we add Saturn, things get more complicated, but there is still a barycenter, even if it follows a complex path with respect to the Sun's center (or the Sun has a complex wobble around the barycenter). Add Neptune and all the other masses in the solar system, and things get even more complicated. Neverthess, there is still a barycenter (often outside the limb of the Sun) about which the Sun does a complex dance.</p>

<p>Now, what is Earth actually orbiting? The Earth's orbit is described to be an ellipse; the ""center"" of an elliptical orbit occurs at one of the focal points of the ellipse. What is at the focal point of the elliptical path the Earth follows? Is it the solar system barycenter or is it the Sun's (wobbling) center of mass? In other words, is the Earth's orbit shifting as the Sun is tugged around, our distance from the Sun never varying by more than the eccentricity of the ellipse, or do we orbit the solar system barycenter, and our distance from the Sun varies by the sum of our orbital eccentricity plus the amount the Sun wobbles in its own orbit around the barycenter?</p>

Those galaxies would surely have long gone so why can we still see the light from so long ago? How can we see further and further back to the beginning of the universe because surely the light from the moment of the big bang and subsequent eons would have past by us long ago?</p>

"Why are some universal entities round and others are flat?","<p>I've been wondering for a while now why some objects in the universe (such as stars, planets, etc.) are round, while others are flat (galaxies, planetary rings and protoplanetary disks).</p>

<p>I know these shapes come to be because of gravity. In planets, the gravity from the core pulls everything to the centre, thus, rounding the planet (same with stars). But with Saturn, for example, why have its rings formed as rings and not as a spherical layer of ice surrounding the planet?</p>

<p>The same with the Kuiper belt and asteroid belt, I would presume the mechanics there are the same as with a planetary orbit, hence, why they are belts and not clouds. But then what about the oort cloud? Why is that a huge cloud in the outermost solar system and not a huge ring of ice.</p>

<p>As for the solar system itself, I've read that the solar system is kind of egg-shaped, but shouldn't it be just like the galaxy (or the other way round)?</p>

"Total angular momentum in system of binary brown dwarfs on wide orbit from primary star","<p>I want to calculate the total angular momentum of a system in which two brown dwarfs are orbiting one another (P ~ 10 years), and this system is stably orbiting a third primary ZAMS star (P ~ $10^4$ years). I was thinking of approaching this question from a Hamiltonian mechanics perspective, but the problem doesn't become easier in the rotating reference frame. </p>

<p>Let A denote the primary star, and B,C denote the two components of the binary. I was thinking the angular momentum would simply be the sum of rotational (S) and orbital angular (L) momentums:
$$
L_{tot} = S_{A} + S_{B} + S_{C} + L_{BC} + L_{A+BC}
$$</p>

<p>However, I am both worried that I am partially ""double counting"" with the last term and I don't really know how to treat the last term. Do I treat BC like a single mass at their barycenter? </p>

<p>If there is a Hamiltonian method to approach this problem, I am all ears.</p>

<p>The question I am actually concerned with is what would the rotation rate of the primary star be if the total angular momentum of the system was in the primary star? But I would really just like an accurate description of the angular momentum of the system to do this.</p>

"Supermassive black holes at the center of galaxies","<p>The fact is, many, if not most large galaxies have a supermassive black hole at their center. My question is why? Is it because when these galaxies were first formed supermassive black holes were created out of super-dense clouds of matter, which then attracted the rest of the galaxy? Or is the black hole attracted to the center of the galaxy in such a way that due to its large mass and ability to perturb everything around it, the interactions with the galaxy tend to move the center to where the black hole is located?</p>

<p>It seems interesting that Sagittarius A* is at the precise center of the galaxy, when it has so much less mass than the rest of the galaxy put together. The sun being at the center of the solar system makes a lot of sense - it accounts for 99.8% of the mass of the solar system. But the mass of Sagittarius A* is on the order of one millionth the mass of the galaxy.</p>

<p>So, to phrase it like a chicken and egg problem – what came first, the super-massive black holes, or the galaxies surrounding them?</p>

"Is the expansion accelerating or Decelerating?","<p>According to Hubble's Law, the farther a galaxy is, the farther it is moving away. But do we take into account the fact that we are actually looking in the past?</p>

<p>For example, there are two galaxies A and B at distance of 5 and 10 billion years respectively. Now, when we observe A we are looking at how it was moving 5 billion years ago. The same applies for B. So, now we conclude that 5 billion years ago space was expanding at a slower rate while it was expanding comparatively faster 10 billion years ago. What's wrong with this conclusion?</p>

"The formation of new stars as depicted in Feynman's lectures","<p>I've stumbled upon this curious passage addressing the formation of stars in Feynman's lectures on physics:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Whether we have ever seen a star form or not is still debatable.
  Figure 7–12 shows the one piece of evidence which suggests that we
  have. At the left is a picture of a region of gas with some stars in
  it taken in 1947, and at the right is another picture, taken only 7
  years later, which shows two new bright spots.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While I fully agree with Feynman's later note† that it's extremely unlikely that this picture shows stars forming, <em>what does it actually show</em>?</p>

<p>There is no reference to it, and no mention of filter used, the physical scale or even of the celestial object shown, and I've gotten rather curious as to what the seven-year change represents. Variable stars? Or is the displacement due to proper motions? Film artifact? Something else entirely?</p>

<p>† Feynman concludes the paragraph with ""[has the star formation somehow occurred?] <em>Perhaps, and perhaps not. It is unreasonable that in only seven years we should be so lucky as to see a star change itself into visible form; it is much less probable that we should see two!""</em> - indeed, the star formation rate of the whole Galaxy would be of this order!</p>

This means the early solar system was enriched with ""fresh"" r-process elements, as compared to the ""stale"" r-process elements that would be typical. For instance the early solar system is conjectured to have been rich in uranium and thorium compared to a ""typical"" system.</p>

<p>I'm curious about whether there is a reason we shouldn't align it like this?

<hr>

<p>The other part of my question is less ""real"" and more of a ""I would like to know if there are any problems with doing this that I am unaware of"" thing...</p>

<p>There are 3 question areas...</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>1</strong><br>
I use a unit I call a Lida, It is 24 terameters long and roughly equivalent to a Light Day.
On this map distances will be measured in Lida, more specifically, KiloLida.
<br>1 Sector = <span class=""math-container"">$20 kL^3$</span><br>
1 Block = <span class=""math-container"">$200 kL^3$</span><br>
1 Grid = <span class=""math-container"">$2,000 kL^3$</span><br>
1 Octant = <span class=""math-container"">$20,000 kL^3$</span></p>

<p>Each of the bigger areas contains 1000 of the next smaller unit down and can easily be referenced by 3 digits. So if I said Grid 346 that would reference the Grid in that Octant where each of those digits are xyz starting from the Galactic Center. Lower numbers are always closer, higher are always further from the Galactic Center.</p>

<p>Why not use parsecs and light years? They're really not practical to use. Likewise, AU are weird, and other units you either end up with very long numbers or poor conversions. Also with this unit, I find it very easy to work out distance and time in my head. The answer is 1.07% off, but that's not really an issue when you're not trying to be 100% precise.</p>

<p>Why use 20kL rather than 10kL or 1kL not many stars in that volume from what I looked at before so it makes sense to use that as division and it also divides up nice to the higher divisions.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>2</strong><br>
I use another unit. </p>

<p>1 brut = <span class=""math-container"">$1*10^{19} kg$</span></p>

<p>The largest reason I'm using this is that scientific notation doesn't work in emergencies or common parlance so it makes sense to me to have a larger base unit when dealing with these larger scales. <span class=""math-container"">$1*10^{19} kg$</span>, if I remember right (cuz I came up with this a few years ago and haven't used it since), comes from when the reference point numbers on the wiki for scale started getting fishy looking to me. Not a hard science thing, but seemed like a good place to have something like this.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>3</strong><br>
This is the way I label Stars, planets, moons, etc... because it makes sense. I keep saying that, but you know, it's true ^.^</p>

<p>SO I - Star (or black hole)<br>
SO II - Spheroid<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Brown Dwarf (Star?)<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Gaseous Spheroid - 12,000+ km radius and above (Most of its size is from gases)<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Terrestrial Spheroid - 1,500 to 12,000 km radius (Has a rocky mantle)<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Icey Spheroid - 200m to 1,500 km radius (Has an ice-water mantle)<br>
SO III - Debris<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Asteroid - Comprised mainly of rock<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Comet - comprised mainly of ice-water  </p>

<p>Child Star (?) - SO I that orbits a SO I<br>
Planet - SO II that orbits a SO I<br>
Moon - SO II that orbits a SO II<br>
?? (currently also called a moon it seems) - SO III that orbits a SO II</p>

<p>SO means Stellar Object.
both SO and Spheroid are kinda bad names considering nothing but stars are Stellar and stars are Spheroids, but whatever, I think it gets the point across. Though I wish I could think up something better.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I kind of like the idea that length scales changes over time so that the universe appears to expand even if there is no movement, if this is how it is supposed to be interpreted.</p>

<p>Now in general relativity we have that time, energy and velocity of light basically co-variates within a gravitational field in a special way that makes the laws of physics appear the same even if different observers at different spatial locations and sometimes at different velocities will sometimes disagree.</p>

<p><strong>Questions:</strong></p>

<p>1.Can we say that what we perceive as one meter today was perceived as less then one meter at earlier epochs and this is why we a little bit sloppy says that ""space is expanding""?</p>

<p>2.If the answer to question 1 is ""yes"",are there any variables co-variating with the change of length scales?

"How would a Fast Fourier Transform Telescope work without a mirror, dish or lenses?","<p>I recently came across a short <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_Transform_Telescope"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">article</a> mentioning the idea for a telescope built without mirrors or lenses that instead uses an array of antennas and massive computing power to resolve an image. Such a thing will apparently become possible if ""Moore's law continues to hold"", but doesn't explain how it will work.</p>

<p>Here's a link to the original paper: <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/0805.4414"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Tegmark and Zaldarriaga 2009</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We will show that it acts much like a single dish telescope with a
  dramatically larger field of view, yet is potentially much cheaper
  than a standard interferometer with comparable area. If a modern
  all-digital interferometer such as the MWA <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spUNpyF58BY"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">1</a> is scaled up to a very
  large number of antennas N , its price becomes completely dominated by
  the computing hardware cost for performing of order N<sup>2</sup> correlations
  between all its antenna pairs. The key idea behind the FFT Telescope
  is that, if the antennas are arranged on a rectangular grid, this cost
  can be cut to scale merely as N log<sub>2</sub> N using Fast Fourier Transforms.
  As we will see, this design also eliminates the need for individual
  antennas that are pointable (mechanically or electronically),</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unlike a traditional interferometer, which consists of individual telescopes that focus light (or radio waves) to a point before ultimately combining their images, the antennas don't have a dish that focuses the radio waves from a certain point in the sky. Instead it's just an array of antennas that images the entire sky at once:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The results above also show that the FFTT can be thought of as a cheap
  maximally compact interferometer with a full-sky primary beam.  To
  convert a state-of- the-art interferometers such as MWA <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spUNpyF58BY"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">1</a>, LOFAR
  [2], 12 PAPER[4], 21CMA [3] into an FFTT, one would need to do three
  things:</p>
  
  <ol>
  <li>Move all antenna tiles together so that they nearly touch.</li>
  <li>Get rid of any beamformer that “points” tiles to- wards a specific sky direction by adding relative phases to its component antennas, and
  treat each antenna as independent instead, thus allowing the array to
  image all sky directions simultaneously.</li>
  <li>Move the antennas onto a rectangular grid to cut the correlator cost from N<sup>2</sup> to N log<sub>2</sub> N .</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Can someone explain how a computer can resolve an image without a lens, dish or mirror to make parallel rays of light converge on a sensor? I thought that a sensor without a lens, dish or mirror will just produce a blurry mess.</p>

<p>Edit: I think I understand it now. Watching <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spUNpyF58BY"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this video</a> was massively helpful for me in understanding how Fourier transformations allow you to isolate individual waveforms from a signal containing many different waveforms.</p>

"Help in determining the features of an unusual, fictional star system","<p>(Hope this is the right Stack-exchange site for this question)<br/>
I'm working on a sci-fi RPG campaign, set on a very atypical location. Since this is a work of fiction, there's enough room for speculation and artistic license. But I'd still like to start from a more astronomically sound perspective.<br/>
<br/></p>

<h3>Background</h3>

<p>Consider the following system:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>A single <strong>moon</strong>, with properties roughly comparable to Earth's so that it can support human life (1G gravity, Nitrogen-Oxygen-Carbon atmosphere, soil and liquid water etc.). This moon is tidally locked with it's planet.</p></li>
<li><p>A single gas-giant <strong>planet</strong>, with a size roughly comparable to Saturn. Orbiting it's star so that it completes a cycle about every 12 earth years.</p></li>
<li><p>A <strong>Star</strong>, larger than Sol and emitting enough energy to keep the moon in a comfortably warm temperature.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The features above may be altered to ensure possibility of human survival on the moon, and if possible, to keep the moon tidally locked with a large planet.</p>

<p>Now, the complications (inspired by a short story by Larry Niven):</p>

<ol>
<li>The whole system (star, planet and moon) are <strong>traveling at a relativistic speed</strong> across the galaxy.</li>
<li>(Based on the theory that some parts of the universe might be made from anti-matter) The whole system is <strong>made from anti-matter</strong>, but is currently traveling through a normal-matter area of space.
Note: the ""human life"" on the moon are also based on anti-matter...</li>
</ol>

<p>Finally, the story will begin with a small community of primitive ""anti-matter humans"", living on the moon in a place from which the planet fully visible, and at the zenith. </p>

<h3>The Questions</h3>

<p>I'd appreciate ideas, insights and comments on the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>From the moon, how will the sky look like?</li>
<li>What will the equivalent of a ""day and night cycle"" (sun-up to sun-up) look like?</li>
<li>Will the winds on the moon have any ""non-earthlike"" patterns?</li>
<li>Considering that at relativistic speeds, the odds of the bodies in the system hitting hydrogen particles in the vacuum of interstellar space are significant (is that even correct?), will that create any special aura or energy streams from the sun or planet?</li>

"Are there large underground caverns on Mars?","<p>Scientists talk about the possibility of life underground on Mars, and I assume they are talking about microscopic life that can live in small gaps in the soil or rock.  But is there any evidence that there might be large caverns under the surface of Mars relative to the human scale or even larger?</p>

<p>Then I wonder how could we even detect or map such subsurface features on Mars or other rocky bodies in the solar system such as Titan, Venus, or even the Moon.  Could we use radar or maybe sonar for bodies with substantial atmospheres from an orbiting spacecraft?  Are there other methods for detecting sub-surface cavities? </p>

"How did the lighter elements end up in the center of the solar system? Solar System Formation","<p>The previous generation of stars famously are the origin of all the heavier elements (up until iron?) in the solar system. So a big portion of the solar system mass actually is made up of Carbon, Silicon, Iron and the like because of that. But in the center, and only in the center, there is a star with presumably almost no heavy elements inside. How can that be? Am I wrong about the actual mass concentrations or is there really an imbalance, i.e. is the element distribution really lighter towards the center of the solar system? I would presume that the previous generation of stars just ended in a more or less uniform cloud of debris, from which the solar system formed. But if so, why aren’t there star systems where the star has a very different composition and is kind of a spluttering, dirty fusion machine (metaphorically, I mean)?</p>

"A good definition of specific intensity?","<p>I’m studying specific intensity for a course on astronomical instrumentation. I can’t quite get my head around the proper definition of the term.</p>

<p>One definition I’ve found in various lecture notes / books / powerpoint slides online is that specific intensity is the power per unit frequency INCIDENT upon a unit area INCIDENT from a unit solid angle. An often given example, for instance in the book of Lena, is that if a telescope records a power P from a star, incident from a solid angle S onto a pixel of area A, then the specific intensity of the source would be P/SA per unit frequency.</p>

<p>Now the second definition I keep finding is that the specific intensity is the power per unit frequency, this time passing through a unit area falling into a unit solid angle.</p>

<p>My question is, are these two equivalent? From the 2D geometry equivalent , I know that an incident pencil of rays through a point causes the same pencil to come out again on the other side. But this feels wrong to appeal to, since the physical interpretations feel so different: incident light is very different from emergent light. </p>

<p>If my above interpretation is true, shouldnt there at least be a sign difference between the emergent and incident definitions such that the integral of the specific intensity over all solid angles yields 0 if no absorption/emission takes place?</p>

"What maintains the high orbital eccentricity of many exo-planets near their sun?","<p>Over the last decade we've discovered that <em>many</em> exoplanets not only have highly eccentric orbits, but also orbit very close to their sun. This is true of many classes of stars.</p>

<p>I definitely have a gap in my understanding, because I'm perplexed as to why the orbits don't circularize when the planets are so close to their star. The tidal forces can be immense, yet the proportionally large number of eccentric planets indicates that many are likely not circularizing (at least over time periods of a handful of giga years). </p>

<p>Why? </p>

<p>I don't understand the physics of this well enough to say. Could it have something to do with with spin-orbital resonance of the planet? A paper I found from Anthony R. Dobrovolskis titled <em>Spin states and climates of eccentric exoplanets</em> indicates that highly eccentric planets in the tidal-lock zone would likely lock into spin states other than 1:1. This could be 2:1, 3:2, etc. Much like mercury. Does the achievement of this spin-orbital resonance do something to preserve the eccentricity? </p>

<p>I'd appreciate any help that could be provided! </p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> </p>

<p>Because it was asked for, I've included a list of some exoplanets that have both short orbital periods as well as highly eccentric orbits (varying from ≈0.15 all the way up to around 0.5). Ages of systems vary widely or is not known, from possibly as low as about 2gy up to over 10gy. </p>

Very high eccentricities are also possible close-in. </p>

"Complex life in binary black hole - Sun(s) system","<p>I was wondering if there could theoretically exist systems in which an Earth-like planet was in the habitable zone of one (or two) Sun-like star(s), while actually not orbiting around any star.
To be more precise, I started asking myself whether a planet like earth could be placed in the inner orbit of a black hole, while one or a pair of Suns would be revolving around the black hole too, on an outer orbit.</p>

<p>My question is not whether such a system could actually exist somewhere, but only if it could <em>theoretically</em> exist, even if it is probabilistically not likely to exist.</p>

<p>So I found this sets of issues:</p>

<ol>
<li>Planet must be far enough from the black hole ( > Roche Limit )</li>
<li>Harmful radiations from black hole's accretion disk</li>
<li>Planet-Star relative distance must not vary too much...which I guess in turn means that the planet-blackhole distance must be small compared to the average blackhole-star distance</li>
</ol>

<p>Given these limitations, how would you choose the stars and blackhole masses and their relative distances to the planet, in order to have it suitable for complex, perhaps intelligent forms of life? Do you see other issues to this purpose?</p>

<p>Below I add what I've been able to collect so far (more like a collection of unsolved questions..)</p>

<p>So, about the issue #1, I thought about a rather lightweight blackhole, with M &lt; 10 Solar masses. I once read in a thread that when considering a central body = 10 solar masses, and a satellite with a density of 5000 kg/m^3 (Earth's average density), then the Roche Limit would be as little as 0.8% of an AU. That would be conveniently small, though I guessed that using Earth's average density may not guarantee that the whole planet is kept together (it may lose its atmosphere...). So, just to be sure, would you rather increase this distance to 1/20 of an AU, perhaps less, perhaps more? I'm asking here because I'm not able to conduct these calculation myself. </p>

<p>Then again, I'm not an expert and I don't know if staying out of the Roche Limit is a sufficient condition for orbiting around a blackhole of this small size without things becoming nasty. I know of issue #2 though,and about that I read someone suggesting that If the planet were subjected to tidal lock, then at least the face looking away from the blackhole would be spared from the harming X rays. But how close a planet should get to a blackhole in order to experience a tidal lock within a reasonable amount of time? Would it likely be tidally locked if it stayed at 0.05 AU away from a 10 solar masses black hole? I guess the answer to be yes, but I wanted some validations from the experts here.</p>

<p>Then about issue #3 again, I thought that If there were two Suns (making another binary system of their own), then there would be also a larger insulating flux, perhaps allowing us to keep the Suns more far away (by a quick calculation I think I found that two Suns at 1.4 AU would give the same flux as one Sun at 1 AU). Another possibility is to have a brighter Star class, at expense of its life-time. So for simplicity let's say we can go up to 2 AU (maybe even more) without the Planet getting too cold, or the Stars too short-lived.</p>

<p>Summarizing, I now have a 10 Solar Masses black hole and a (likely) tidally locked earth-like planet orbiting at 0.05 AU from it. Tidal forces should still be small enough not to suck the planet's atmosphere. Perhaps having a planet slightly bigger than the Earth would also help in this account. Then we have a couple of Stars orbiting together around the black hole, at a distance of 2 AU. Relative distance from the twin Stars to the Planet is 2 +/- 0.05 AU. I guess that would be within the limits of the habitable zone, right?</p>

<p>One last curiosity: assuming the black hole has an ""average"" spin, would it be realistic if the two Stars had a tilted orbit with respect to the black hole spinning axis?</p>

<p>I'm sorry for the many questions, by any means please don't assume I'm expecting a single person to answer all of them.</p>

"Are astronomers continuously monitoring exoplanetary systems?","<p>I'm reading many of the Wikipedia pages about exoplanets and the different methods they are using to detect them.  But I wonder, it seems that the emphasis is on detecting and finding new exoplanets, but are astronomers continuously monitoring the exoplanets that have already been discovered?  For instance, if there is a collision between a detected exoplanet and a previously unknown planet, this could cause a change in some of the orbital parameters, and could be potentially detected.  If this happens, would we learn of this change, or will it have to wait until astronomers again take another look at the system?</p>

"A [very basic?] question about light scattering and colors","<p>Since the night two days ago, the moon here in Israel appears to be orange as it rises, and then gradually becomes white as it continues travelling across the sky.   </p>

<p>This phenomenon comes in a great timing as I am starting to become interested in astronomy (I have <strong>no</strong> special knowledge in astronomy, just to make it clear).
So I googled up and came across <a href=""https://wonderopolis.org/wonder/what-makes-the-moon-look-orange"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this</a> explanation.<br>
I'll try to summarize: it says that it happens because of Earth's atmosphere, that tends to scatter short wave-lengths (such as blue and green) and let long wave-lengths (such as red and orange) pass through. When the moon rises, it's in the position where the light coming from it to our eyes goes through the thickest layer of atmosphere (as opposed to when it's high up in the night skies) and that gives the orange effect. 
I totally get this explanation, but it raises a couple of questions for me, whose answers I couldn't find. Maybe you could help me out. </p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Why doesn't the orange moon phenomenon occur all the time?</strong><br>
It does not happen quite often. What's so special about the past three nights? I mean, the rising moon's light always has to go through a thick atmosphere layer, doesn't it?</li>
<li>Maybe that's not entirely astronomic, but, to complete the big picture - <strong>why does our atmosphere scatter short wave-lengths?</strong></li>
<li>This explanation suggests that all light coming to us from the sun is (at least) slightly reddish. Is this measurable (if true)? Because to the naked eye, sunlight refrected through a prism shows no tendency towards red. </li>
</ol>

<p>Thank you for your time reading the question, I hope you could rescue me from my ignorance... </p>

"Effects of the solar tide on planets","<p>It’s well known that (lunar) tides on Earth result in a transfer of angular momentum from Earth proper to the Earth–Moon <em>orbital</em> motion. That’s why the Moon resides now in a high Earth orbit, and Earth’s axial rotation is nowadays much slower than in the past (Hadean, Archean etc.).</p>

<p>What about effects of <strong>solar</strong> tides, indeed? The angular momentum certainly must be transferred from Earth proper to the Earth–Sun orbital motion. Does it result in a tiny increase of (Earth+Moon)’s heliocentric orbital angular momentum over millenia? What about Mars and Ceres: does the solar tide brake their axial rotation and change slightly their orbits? And what about Venus: does <a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0273117787902377"" rel=""nofollow"">its solar tidal</a> braking explain the slowness of rotation completely?</p>

<p>Addendum. The solar tide may not be confused with “dual” effect: planetary tide on the central star. It exists as well and has much significance for (extrasolar) planets on near orbits — but this question is not about tides on Sun. Ī̲’d accept an answer assuming gravity of the Sun to be spherically symmetric, neglecting Sun’s deviation from spherical symmetry, as well as rotation (even going to account for General Relativity). The solar tide is <strong>interaction between this gravity and the orbiting object.</strong> By Newton’s laws, gravitation affects Sun’s momentum reciprocally (and, hence, velocity), and we may ignore here any effect on Sun beyond its translational motion (momentum/velocity/position).</p>

<p>Is it just a coincidence that this gigantic, bright rock is sitting dead center of the peak complex or is it a known piece of the original impactor that caused the wider crater? Does this remarkable rock have a name?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On 10 June 2011 the LRO spacecraft slewed 65° to the west, allowing the LROC NACs to capture this dramatic sunrise view of Tycho crater. A very popular target with amateur astronomers, Tycho is located at 43.37°S, 348.68°E, and is ~82 km (51 miles) in diameter. The summit of the central peak is 2 km (6562 ft) above the crater floor, and the crater floor is about 4700 m (15,420 ft) below the rim. Many ""clasts"" ranging in size from 10 meters to 100s of meters are exposed in the central peak slopes. Were these distinctive outcrops formed as a result of crushing and deformation of the target rock as the peak grew? Or do they represent preexisting rock layers that were brought intact to the surface? Imagine future geologists carefully making their way across these steep slopes, sampling a diversity of rocks brought up from depth. Tycho's features are so steep and sharp because the crater is young by lunar standards, only about 110 million years old. Over time, micrometeorites, and not so micro meteorites, will grind and erode these steep slopes into smooth mountains. For a preview of what Tycho's central peak may look like in a few billion years, visit Bhabha crater.</p>

"How can cosmological bubble universes ""collide"" with each other?","<p>In <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_inflation"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Eternal Inflation Theory</a>, there exists the idea of multiple ""bubble"" Universes that grow and according to this <a href=""https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1475-7516/2009/04/025/pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">theory</a>, can ""collide"" with each other. The paper suggests that you can search for evidence that our Universe collided with other ""bubble"" Universes, by looking for an imprint on the CMB radiation. </p>

<p>However, the concept of a Universe existing as a bubble that moves relative to other universes makes no sense:</p>

<ul>
<li>How can you have a space ""outside"" of ours that allows the Universes to
move relative to each other?</li>
<li>In what dimension are the other ""Universes"" moving relative to ours?</li>
<li>If time started in our Universe at the Big Bang, then in what time dimension (outside of ours) do collisions between Universes occur?</li>

"Using a telescope to look at the Earth History in Some Detail","<p>The following paragraph is a scientific fact.</p>

<p>When we look distantly into the universe (with telescopes) we see galaxies 
(or whatever else you see) as they were millions years 
ago- in other words it is how they looked in the past (this is because of the speed of light).</p>

<p>So my question is could we build a technology (using current science or more speculative/theoretical science) using this scientific fact too see the earth history or past to such a level of detail that we could see historical events (e.g. individual dinosaurs) and the famous people's faces (in history books) - as if we were standing face to face with them- of the long ago past? What's the best level of detail could we theoretically see?</p>

"Could light be dark matter?","<p>Is it possible that light itself is dark matter?  I am speaking of photons (e.g. visible light, infrared, ultraviolet, etc...).  I realize light is understood to be massless, but it is obvious it at least contains energy because we can see with it (e.g. it energizes the cells in our retinas).  I wonder if light has a very tiny ""net mass"" (e.g. 0 mass * relativistically infinite speed).  I would think that light at least has a little mass, in proportion to its energy.  For example, take E=mc^2, then m = E/c^2 would describe how much mass it has.  If this is true, light should have a very little gravity too.  Although the effect would seem minimal, light is practically everywhere. Gravity from light would be more concentrated inside galaxies, and even more concentrated in the center of galaxies where there are many stars (like dark matter is).  It would be interesting to run the calculations, assuming light does have gravity, and see if this matches the gravitational observations of dark matter in the universe.  It would be funny and ironic if dark matter really is light.</p>

<p>Edit: Note that it appears light does have gravity as per the discussions here: <a href=""https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/questions/1333/how-does-light-affect-the-universe?rq=1"">How does light affect the universe?</a>  If that much is true, I wonder if this is significant enough to account for dark matter?</p>

"Four Lights (star like) Moving in a Line Together","<p>About 20 minutes ago, we saw four lights lined up and moving relatively quickly across the sky. These lights looked exactly like the stars around them - not red or blue or flashing or anything, just four stars at first glance. The spacing between them remained constant as they traveled in a straight line together (moving from West to East). The two in the middle were slightly closer to one another than the two in the front and back of the line, but the spacing was otherwise equal and constant - as if they'd been strung together on a line that was begging pulled forward. </p>

<p>They moved as quickly as a plane might when making a final approach to land, but there were no other lights visible around them and no sound. After watching for a minute, I called a friend out to reassure me I wasn't just seeing things, but they saw the same and described them as resembling stars more than anything else as well.</p>

<p>Do satalites travel in groups? Would they form a consistent line like this? That's the next closest thing I can think of, but I've never seen satalites quite that bright/large or traveling in locked step with others.</p>

<p>Could these have been military planes flying high enough to only appear as one whitish, twinkling light but still as fast as a lower flying plane? There is a naval Base not to far from us; that's the only other thing I can think of. </p>

"""If earth had rings like Saturn"": A few further thoughts on the consequences","<p>I came across this video recently where artists depicted what it would look like if Earth had rings like Saturn. <a href=""http://www.wimp.com/earthrings/"">http://www.wimp.com/earthrings/</a></p>

<p>Please note: The video contains already some information on what I ask here, but I can't assess its reliability, therefore I'd appreciate any scientific thoughts on it :)</p>

<p>1) Earth has roughly a distance of 1 AU to the sun, Saturn between 9 and 10. Sun's gravity would therefore have a much stronger influence on these rings. Would it already be enough to distort the rings (e.g. even leading to the sun ""stealing"" parts of it) or would the rings still have a ring shape?</p>

<p>2) How well would the objects in such rings be visible from earth? The Saturn rings are mostly dust and ice as far as I know, but there are surely some larger objects. Depending on material and size some object would probably be visible to the naked eye, right? Is there (probably yes) a formula to calculate what materials and sizes are required to achieve this?</p>

<p>3) Would those rings not be constantly raining particles down on earth? Would there be a much higher risk of dangerous impacts for the earth's population?</p>

<p>4) Are the colours used in the video precise? Don't they depend on the angle? What influence would our atmosphere have onto them?</p>

<p>5) Would those rings have the same orbital inclination or would theirs differ from earth's to an extent where the difference becomes visible?</p>

<p>6) What shadow would these rings cause on earth? Would they be dense enough to ""shade out"" complete stretchs of land?</p>

Neptune is the farthest planet from the Sun, yet its internal energy is sufficient to drive the fastest planetary winds seen in the Solar System.

<p>This doesn't cut it for me. Neither does wikipedia's similar entry.</p>

<p>It pertains to the sun, even though comets are present in other parts of the galaxy other than the solar system and probably other galaxies.</p>

<pre><code> * orbits a host star
 * rounded by its own gravity
 * not massive enough to induce thermonuclear fusion
 * not massive enough to clear its region of debris
</code></pre>

<p>Which pretty much fits the bill of a comet.</p>

<p>Do you think the following is a fair / recognised classification of a comet:</p>

<pre><code>Comet:
* not rounded by its own gravity
* not massive enough to induce thermonuclear fusion
* not massive enough to clear its region of debris
* composition of ice and dust

<p>But then that's pretty similar to an asteroid:</p>

* not rounded by its own gravity
* not massive enough to induce thermonuclear fusion
* not massive enough to clear its region of debris

<p>I can imagine several sources of instrumental and experimental errors due to variations in <em>field distortion</em> and <em>magnification</em>, presumably the measurement was done by comparing the eclipse images with similar images taken by the same instruments of the same field of stars in the same position in the field of view a few months later, at night, in the dark, in order to show that the tiny deflections were not due to variation from one instrument to another.</p>

<p>Is that actually how it was done? Was the experimental set-up left in-place between day and night measurements, or was it packed up and moved?</p>

<p>Was the flatness of the coelostat mirrors independently confirmed somehow?</p>

"How much of the Universe is invisible to us, and how does it affect our theories?","<p>I watched an <a href=""https://youtu.be/TgA2y-Bgi3c?t=435"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">interview with Neil deGrasse Tyson on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert</a> where he briefly mentioned a disturbing thought. It is something that I have never thought of before, and the idea borders on the eerie.</p>

<p>The idea is this (and here comes a mouthful): If all our knowledge of the Universe is based on observations of distant galaxies (and Milkyway stars), and we accept that the Universe is expanding at such an accelerating rate that at some point in the future only our nearest stars will be visible to whoever inhabits Earth, and that then those future inhabitants will need to explain the Universe based only on what they can observe, then it is possible that we are today trying to explain the Universe based on largely incomplete data.</p>

<p>Like, imagine that there is much more stuff out there, stuff that could help us explain some of the scientific ""mysteries"" such as dark energy/matter, but it is beyond our horizon. We don't know what is missing from our view.</p>

<p>And so I guess the question is this: <strong>How does this affect the validity of our current models of the Universe?</strong> </p>

"Why does Gaia use only calcium NIR lines for stellar radial velocity measurements?","<p>I was reading <a href=""http://spaceflight101.com/gaia/gaia-instrument-information/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this overview article</a> about the Gaia spacecraft and I saw the following statement:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>These spectra provide radial velocity information that are used to study the kinematic and dynamic evolution of the Milky Way. Radial velocities are derived from three isolated Calcium lines at 849.8, 854.2 and 855.2nm. Other lines in the 847 to 874nm range can provide data on star composition, surface gravity, and metal abundance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>note:</strong> as pointed out in the comments below, the third line is at <em>866.2nm, not 855.2nm</em> - this is suggested to be a typo - the '855' number also shows up on <a href=""http://sci.esa.int/gaia/40129-payload-module/?fbodylongid=1916"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this ESA page</a>.</p>

<p>The high resolution spectroscopy only seems to operate between 847 and 874nm, and ""three isolated Calcium lines"" are used to measure radial velocity. </p>

<p>Do all stars have enough calcium in their atmosphere to produce strong enough features to measure the radial velocity so accurately? I had thought that there are some stellar populations have very little besides hydrogen and helium in their atmosphere. </p>

<p>Are these always emission lines or absorption lines, or will there be some stars with one and some of the other? What fraction of stars simply won't have significant amounts of calcium?</p>

Most accounts deny the existence of anything other than electrons, protons, and some alpha particles; but it seems to me that if we can identify most of the known elements in the Sun's photosphere, then they are likely to exist in the Solar Wind at some concentration. If not, what is the detection limit (ppm? ppb? ppt?) we have so far established? Have any limits been established for atom clusters (dust?)? As a secondary question, I guess that (neutral) hydrogen and (negative hydride) H(-) do not exist in the solar wind due to its temperature being too high. Is this correct, and if so, is it true throughout the heliosphere or does the solar wind cool enough for the formation of bound species?</p>

</code></pre>

<p>At this point, I want to add several of the Jovian moons, however the same site doesn't seem to provide the same type of data for these moons, perhaps because the moons behave differently.  Unfortunately, my math is not great; I can usually implement something that's written down, but I don't have the wherewithal to work it out myself.</p>

<p>For the Jovian moons, the data is listed at: <a href=""https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/?sat_elem#jupiter"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/?sat_elem#jupiter</a>  Here is an example for Ganymede:</p>

</code></pre>

<p>Here they state that the data is ""<em>Mean orbital elements referred to the local <strong>Laplace planes</em></strong>"", as opposed to ""<strong><em>Keplerian Elements</strong> for Approximate Positions of the Major Planets</em>"".</p>

<p>Whilst the first 6 parameters appear to be the same (a, e, w, M, i, node), the Keplerian elements also have ""rates"", or <em>time derivatives</em> (according to this post: <a href=""https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/8911/determining-orbital-position-at-a-future-point-in-time"">https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/8911/determining-orbital-position-at-a-future-point-in-time</a>).  The forumlae kindly provided by NASA for the Keplerian elements relies on these rates.</p>

<p>If I could understand how to determine the ""rates"" for the Jovian moons, then I might be able to use the same formula (is this the right thing to do?)  It looks to me like those rates are something I should be able to compute from the other data provided for the moons, however I haven't been able to determine how.</p>

<p>My suspicion is that I either need a different formula for the computation using the Laplace Planes, or I need to compute those 'rate' values and use the same formula I already have.</p>

<p>I'm trying to generate cartesian (x, y, z) coordinates for each Moon where (0,0,0) is the centre of Jupiter itself, for a given date/time (typically ""now"").</p>

The first three are gravitational wave detectors and the last two are gamma-ray telescopes in Earth orbit. Figure 2 of the paper (part of which is shown below) provides a densely packed infographic of the early observations. In the top left one can see an inset that spans from twelve seconds before the merger during the gravitational wave (GW) ramp in frequency, to six seconds after, where the majority of the gamma ray burst (GRB) is detected.</p>

<p>Somehow the combination of the GW and GRB set in motion a sequence of events that triggered a world-wide observation campaign to look for the event in all the remaining electromagnetic spectrum from radio through visible and UV to X-rays. Neutrino data streams were checked as well.</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> I'd like to ask about the sequence of events, the alerts, and the rapid automatic and manual analysis of the GW and GRB data which triggered the alerts. Which detector or combination first ""saw"" the event as some kind of flagged event? Did one trigger a rapid analysis of the other?

<p>Suppose the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>A system of planets orbiting a star, similar in size to our own.</li>
<li>A cloud of debris (Asteroids, technological refuse, and dust) surrounds the entire system, similar to the description of a Dyson swarm.</li>
<li>The outermost planet orbiting on a path that intersects the cloud during a small portion of it's year, but is within the cloud for the majority of it's year.</li>
</ul>

<p>Is this configuration possible within our understanding of physics, or would gravity cause the objects of the cloud and the outermost planet to 'snap' to an orbit that does not intersect? Would the planet 'capture' objects within the swarm in it's own orbit?</p>

<p>My story takes place on the inside of a Dyson swarm or bubble, where interplanetary travel has developed to a reasonable degree, but cannot escape the swarm. An area of intrigue might be the outermost planet. If it can be landed upon while it's orbit is within the swarm, people could 'ride' the planet through to the other side if they stayed there for a number of years or went into stasis there.</p>

Even so, I'm curious how the large difference in density would affect things.

The second one is the ""photon sphere"", here referred to as the zone at the ""innermost bound circular orbit"", at <span class=""math-container"">$1.5\ r_S$</span>, at which a photon (particle of light) traveling at right angles (i.e. constant <span class=""math-container"">$r$</span>-coordinate) can complete one circuit around the hole and within which only <em>impossibly</em> powerful rockets could get you out. Orbits above this point but below the ""innermost <em>stable</em> circular orbit"", out to <span class=""math-container"">$3\ r_S$</span>, are possible but require a continuous application of (likely ungodly large) engine propulsion. Above this, more-or-less normal orbits are possible, though they precess more and more rapidly as the general-relativistic effect that is incipient with the orbits of the planets becomes fully mature in these environs.</p>

<p>Now, the trick, of course, is the qualifiers regarding propulsion: ""impossibly powerful"", ""ungodly large"" which basically are likely words for ""it can't be done with realistic technology"". Which, then, of course, is what begs this question - what <em>can</em> be done with such?</p>

<p>For my ""realistic"" scenario, a generous interpretation will be used which is ""a matter-antimatter fueled spacecraft with a wet mass 100x its dry mass"". The goal is for the craft to execute one of two manoeuvres:</p>

<ol>
<li>lower itself into an orbit around the hole, orbit a few times, and then take off again (so it must have fuel for both trips) and return to where it launched from, and</li>
<li>establish a ""slingshot"" trajectory around the hole that takes it as close as possible before shooting it back out into space (this may be easier?).</li>
</ol>

<p>I consider this ""reasonable"" because any travel to a black hole will already be an extreme problem in interstellar travel, much less the kinds of targets that will already be in use for this kind of proposal which will almost surely have to be supermassive black holes to be interesting and thus requiring travel at least to the center of the Galaxy (~200 000 Pm) if not intergalactically (distances of many Zm), with tera- or petaseconds of travel time (thousands to millions of years) at least, or something like wormholes if they are possible. Hence I presume the technology to make such a craft will be readily available to any civilization that is capable of pulling this feat off to begin with.</p>

<p>The reason we need supermassive black holes is tidal forces and ideally we want to get as close to the horizon as possible. Possible targets may be Sagittarius A* and M87* (the black hole that the picture was taken of), both supermassive black holes, the latter much more so still, at the centers of galaxies. However, M87* presents the additional challenge of an extremely active matter environment around it, which may foreclose that possibility even further, though even Sgr A* might be too much. Hence, failing that, we can just consider a hypothetical black hole of mass equal to either, that is suitably ""quiet"", if nothing else is possible. (or perhaps imagine that with M87*, it has entered a quiescent period by the time the ships arrive as compared to the time when it sent the images we saw)</p>

<p>What would be the closest approach possible, in both scenarios, while still having enough fuel to get away (or not being destroyed by other effects)? We should also assume that the craft starts out at great distance where gravity is hopefully unremarkable, but do not budget for more than 250 Ms shipboard total mission time (a bit less than 2893 days of 86.4 ks each), measured from time of release from mission departure station to time of return.</p>

"Water vapour in space","<p>This question is inspired by, but different from, <a href=""https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/questions/2357/what-would-happen-if-an-ice-cube-is-left-in-space"">What happens if an ice cube is left in space?</a></p>

<p>Mark's accepted answer says ""…if you stick your ice cube out in the Oort Cloud, it'll grow: the mean surface temperature is 40K or below,…"".</p>

<p>To which the obvious response is <em>Everything has a vapour pressure, so everything in the vacuum of space will evaporate eventually</em>. Accordingly I thought it might be worth investigating why ice grains <em>do</em> exist. For which we need some numbers.</p>

<p><strong>Vapour pressure of water at 40K</strong></p>

<p>Most charts do not go that low. The best figure I have come up with was by looking at the pictures in <a href=""https://trace.tennessee.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=2364&amp;context=utk_graddiss"" rel=""noreferrer"">Water Ice Films in Cryogenic Vacuum Chambers</a>, a doctoral thesis by Jesse Michael Labello. Figure 4 on page 4 has graphs which, extrapolated by guesswork, suggest that the vapour pressure of water at 40K is less than <span class=""math-container"">$10^{-26}$</span> torr.</p>

<p><strong>Atmospheric pressure in space</strong></p>

<p>The Moon's atmospheric pressure is said to be <span class=""math-container"">$10^{-11}$</span> torr, and the New World Encyclopedia says interstellar space is <span class=""math-container"">$10^{-16}$</span> torr, and some answers on Physics Stack Exchange suggest about <span class=""math-container"">$10^{-25}$</span> for intergalactic space.</p>

<hr>

<p>It appears, therefore, that ice grains at 40K do not evaporate because their vapour pressure is not high enough. Does it follow, therefore:</p>

<ol>
<li>That ice grains would evaporate, even at 40K, if they were in a vacuum?</li>
<li>That, if the ice is at equilibrium with its vapour, the relative humidity of interstellar space is 100%? Or is the process of evaporation/condensation <em>kinetically</em> so slow that the universe is too young for it to have reached equilibrium?</li>

"Does a kilonova leave a high mass remnant?","<p>My understanding of <A HREF=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_Ia_supernova"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Type Ia supernovae</A> is that they are expected, in most cases, to destroy the white dwarf(s) that went in to them, leaving behind no high density remnants (i.e. no white dwarf, neutron star, or black hole). Black hole/black hole collisions are expected to leave behind a black hole, of course, with <A HREF=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_black_hole#Observation"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">less mass than the sum of the masses of the black holes that went in to the collision</A>. Do we expect a kilonova to leave behind nothing but gas and radiation or some kind of stellar remnant? If it leaves behind a remnant, what class to we expect it to be (white dwarf, neutron star, or black hole) and what mass? The addition of mass seems redundant, but the dividing lines between the masses of these objects are based on upper limits on the mass of the less dense class (<A HREF=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandrasekhar_limit"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Chandrasekhar limit</A> for white dwarfs, <A HREF=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tolman%E2%80%93Oppenheimer%E2%80%93Volkoff_limit"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff limit</A> for neutron stars), and don't actually apply as lower limits for the mass of the high density class. For example, neutron stars are sometimes referred to as <A HREF=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_star#Giant_nucleus"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">giant nuclei</A>, which would put the lower limit of their mass at $1$ or $2$ atomic mass units, depending on whether the presence of a neutron and stability to radioactive decay are requirements. Yes, those times people are being poetic due to the difference in stabilization mechanisms (gravity vs nuclear forces), but the point remains that it may be possible for a neutron star to be theoretically stable at less than $1.4M_\odot$. The only lower limit to black hole mass I know of would be the lifetime limit from <A HREF=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawking_radiation"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">black hole evaporation</A>.</p>

<p>Put another way, do we think the density at any point in either of the inspiraling neutron stars gets high enough to form an event horizon?

"How is the expansion rate of the universe obtained from Baryon Acoustic Oscillations?","<p>I understand that we can measure the sound horizon from the anisotropies in the CMB. Large galaxy surveys today can construct two-point correlation functions, which reveal peaks at distances equal to today's sound horizon, I think because the BAOs at decoupling essentially created dark matter gravitational wells for structure to begin forming in (correct me if I'm wrong). I'm under the impression that the sound horizon is a fixed physical distance, so its measured comoving distance at any redshift should always be the same. Am I right or wrong in this assumption?</p>

<p>I read some information from a few different sources on this topic which confused me. On <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerating_expansion_of_the_universe#Supernova_observation"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikipedia</a>: ""Peaks have been found in the correlation function (the probability that two galaxies will be a certain distance apart) at 100 h−1 Mpc, indicating that this is the size of the sound horizon today, and by comparing this to the sound horizon at the time of decoupling (using the CMB), we can confirm the accelerated expansion of the universe.""</p>

<p>But if the sound horizon is always at the same physical scale, how can we use measurements today to determine the rate of expansion? Do the correlation functions give you <em>proper</em> separations, and from that with different cosmological models we can determine what <span class=""math-container"">$H_0$</span> or <span class=""math-container"">$H(z)$</span> value gives a <em>comoving</em> separation equal to the sound horizon?

"How massive does a main sequence star need to be to go type 1 supernova?","<p>We know the mass a white dwarf needs to be. That's well defined by the Chandrasekhar limit, but before a main sequence star turns into a white dwarf it tends to lose a fair bit of its matter in a stellar nebula.   </p>

  <p><a href=""https://public.nrao.edu/news/planetary-mass-powerhouse/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Astronomers using the National Science Foundation’s Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) have made the first radio-telescope detection of a planetary-mass object beyond our Solar System.</a> They found a rogue planet 12.7 times the mass of Jupiter twenty light years from earth.</p>
  
  <p>It is at the boundary of Jovian objects and Brown dwarf stars.</p>
  
  <p>[...]</p>
  
  <p>Last year, an independent team of scientists discovered that SIMP J01365663+0933473 was part of a very young group of stars. Its young age meant that it was in fact so much less massive that it could be a free-floating planet — only 12.7 times more massive than Jupiter, with a radius 1.22 times that of Jupiter. At 200 million years old and 20 light-years from Earth, the object has a surface temperature of about 825 degrees Celsius, or more than 1500 degrees Fahrenheit. By comparison, the Sun’s surface temperature is about 5,500 degrees Celsius.</p>
  
  <p><strong>The difference between a gas giant planet and a brown dwarf remains hotly debated among astronomers</strong>, but one rule of thumb that astronomers use is the mass below which deuterium fusion ceases, known as the “deuterium-burning limit”, around 13 Jupiter masses.</p>

"Solar visible light spectrum","<p>So the visible light from stars can be used to identify the elements in that star by looking at the spectral emission lines and comparing those lines to emission lines of various elements (and their isotopes) here on earth.  These well-known line wavelengths can also be used to determine the relative motion of that star to the earth by looking at the red (or blue) shift of wavelengths of those spectral lines.  It would then be reasonable to assume that our own sun emits those same well-defined spectral lines, which should show up at specific wavelengths (based on the elements in the sun).  </p>

<p>However, sunlight appears (mostly) white, and using a prism shows a rather consistent rainbow of color across the visible spectrum, rather than what one would expect to see (based on analysis of emission spectrum from other stars) of spikes at specific wavelengths.  So, what is causing the full-spectrum light from the sun to appear at the surface of the earth if what I'm assuming is specific spectral lines being generated from fusion on the sun itself?   </p>

<p>As for the first case, which force is it? As for the second case, that should break our physical laws, because there would be one force, applied a very long time ago which is still in effect and not about to slow down and with a very very long lasting effect. Because thousands or millions of years for rotation is a very long time, isn't it. Or is it slowing down? </p>

One of the plot points is the star becoming supernova in several hours, so the characters have to fix their ship before that happens.</p>

<p>I have basic knowledge of how it works: Iron generated from nuclear fusion gets accumulated in the core, until it reaches a point when iron fusion starts. As iron fusion is an endothermic reaction, the core is no longer able to generate enough energy to hold against its own gravity and external layers pressure, so it collapses, and explode.</p>

<p>I have read that once the iron fusion starts inside the core, the collapse occurs within minutes, that the collapse itself lasts a few seconds (even less than a second), and that the shockwave takes several hours to reach the surface. Is all that correct?</p>

<p>The thing is that I need the characters to bee able to predict the explosion in a short term. A few hours or even minutes. It would be great if they could be aware of the core collapse and start a countdown.</p>

<p>So, are there any external cue of these events, like changes in luminosity or color? Does the star spectrum change when iron fusion starts, or when the core collapses? I know that the core collapse generates a huge amount of neutrinos. Is this amount so intense that it can be easily detectable? (that is, without a huge detector in an underground facility). Can the amount of iron in the core be estimated from tha star spectrum and size, so the aproximate time of the collapse could be predicted?</p>

<p>For example a ""temple"" in Peru has been dated as being aligned with the summer SOLSTICE(es)[edited] as of 6000 years ago by unnamed experts in the field. Other unnamed experts date it at 28000 years old - to which the first set of ""experts"" grudgingly concede is ""remotely"" possible - with an absolute qualification that there was no one here to build it that far back.(Statements of absolute certainty like this and, without proof make me itchy)</p>

<p>First part of question is: Why the huge discrepancy in the dating? Isn't the concept of precession a proven, quantifiable fact? (OK, that was two questions.)</p>

<p>Second part of question is: How do the first set of experts find themselves entrenched in their dating if they must also grudgingly agree that the second dating is remotely possible? (Both groups agree that neither the Inca nor any known predecessors actually built it.)</p>

<p>Anything which can help me to come to grips with this dating rationale would be great.</p>

<p>I am not versed in astronomy whatsoever. I can barely find Sirius on a clear night. And, math is also a foreign concept as well. 
What I DO understand is Ancient Civilizations. 
So, I would like to understand this topic more so that I can discuss it with others in the field - without sounding like a complete idiot.</p>

<p>[Edit to clarify before more protests stack up] I acknowledge that I did not recall and therefore omitted the fact that non-solar stellar alignments AT THE TIME of summer solstice are the basis for this alignment-dating. At least that is the theory I am discussing. (There are others) One window frames the Sun at sunrise while another frames some star. The third window... I cannot locate a theory of what it was supposed to be for. I just wanted to understand the basis for DRIFT over time. And, the accepted answer does that very nicely. Thank you everyone</p>

<p>The mirror already has a donut, but I wonder if it is accurately placed as to my eye it appears slightly off center, but perhaps the optical center is not the physical center?</p>

<p>I've seen a <a href=""http://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-resources/how-to-align-your-newtonian-reflector-telescope/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">recommendation in Sky &amp; Telescope</a> to get two clear plastic rulers that bend and place them at exact right angles to each other with the donut upside down lightly stuck to the bottom center cross point and then positioning the rulers evenly and pressing down to bend them toward the mirror and affix the donut.  However, I don't think this method is well suited for an 18"" mirror, perhaps I am mistaken?</p>

This method is also <a href=""http://www.alcoat.net/pap_dot.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">mentioned here</a> in some detail, but they specifically state not for use with a laser collimator.</p>

"Illusion of a lunar eclipse","<p>A little over half a year ago, I think it was mid March 2015, I glanced out of my window at about 4 am, to see what appeared to be a very bright total lunar eclipse, as in, the moon was full and bright orange-red. As I watched, it disappeared before my eyes, looking as if someone slid a paper down in front of it. The moon was not full that night (and by extension that means that there couldn't have been an eclipse that night) and the next few nights, the moon was on the other side of the sky at 4 am.</p>

<p>The room I was in was dark, so it couldn't have been a reflection on the window of something inside the house. It might have been a reflection on the window of something outside the house, but that's not very likely, because it was very bright and opaque (something would have to be really bright to look so bright and opaque when reflected off a window, and I can't think of anything that would have been so bright. Plus, I probably would have noticed something something so bright), it didn't move when I moved my head around, and it looked exactly like the moon – it had the same dark and light spots. I would have taken a picture of it, it would be a lot easier to understand what I mean if you would see it, but it disappeared really fast.</p>

<p>It might have been a reflection on the clouds. I don't recall if there were clouds in the sky, I wasn't paying that much attention to the sky around it, because while it was happening I just thought it was an eclipse. But if it was a reflection on the clouds, there's still the question of what was being reflected.</p>

<p>I asked someone who knows a lot about a bunch of topics, but is not good at explaining what he means, what it could have been, and he said something about solar flares, I didn't really get what he was saying. I would ask him again, but I don't know him personally and I don't know how to contact him, and in any case, I don't think he would explain it any better the second time.</p>

<p>I searched everywhere I could possibly think of (on the web, on Q&amp;A sites, on SE) for a cause for this, but couldn't find anything like it.</p>

<p>What I'm asking is this: Could it have been a reflection on the clouds, and if so, what could it have been of? Could it have been caused by a solar flare or something like it, and if so, how? Is there an astronomical event that occurred around that time that could have caused something like that, and if so, what and how?</p>

<p>This question was put on hold as unclear what you're asking, so if anyone has any suggestions that can make the question more clear, I would love to hear it. I wish I could be more precise about when it happened, or what exactly it looked like, but I didn't write it down or note it in any way at the time, so this is pretty much all I remember.</p>

"Do boulders erode differently on asteroids than on the Moon?","<p>If I understand it correctly, boulders on the Moon are only found near fresh craters, because micrometeorites erode them over time.

And NASA is planning the ARM mission to go pick up a boulder from an asteroid.</p>

<p>Are boulders more frequent on asteroids than on the Moon, and if so, by what kind of mechanism? For example, it is not primarily micrometeorites, but temperature changes that erodes them on the Moon. Or don't microgravity objects attract as many micrometeorites as the Moon does?</p>

  <p>People tend to focus on the peak mornings of the shower and that’s entirely appropriate. But meteors in annual showers – which come from streams of debris left behind in space by comets – typically last weeks, not days. Perseid meteors have been streaking across our skies since around July 17. We’ll see Perseids for 10 days or so after the peak mornings on August 11, 12 and 13. <strong>What’s more, the Perseids tend to build up gradually, yet fall off rapidly</strong>.

<blockquote>
  <p>Additionally, you could always purchase a SQM (Sky quality meter) which is a small, portable battery powered device that you take out to your dark sky site, point it at the zenith, and the screen will display the darkness of the sky. Do beware that the SQM measures in 'magnitudes per square arcsecond' which means the higher the number, the darker the sky.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If I wanted to try to make a diy SQM, I'd need to understand if there was some established standards or practices associated with a sky quality measurement.</p>

<p>I might try to use a low dark current <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photodiode"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">silicon photodiode</a> in photoconductive or photovoltaic mode, low frequency couple it to a low noise op-amp, then do a cover-on measurement to zero out the leakage then do a over-off measurement to quantify the sky brightness.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>What solid angle should it integrate over? Certainly more than one arcsecond, but would it be one square degree, or a 10 degree wide circle for example?</p></li>
<li><p>Silicon covers the visual spectrum and some near infrared as well. Depending on the protective materials over it, it might measure all the way out to a micron. Is that a problem, or is light pollution pretty much in the visible part of the spectrum (for obvious reasons) and I wouldn't need to hunt for an IR-blocking filter like the ones found on imagers for cameras.</p></li>
<li><p>With a single broadband (rather than spectrally resolved) measurement of photocurrent, I could choose a representative wavelength, or assume a flat 400-700 nm emission spectrum, or even make an educated guess about what the spectrum of noise pollution looks like, then use that along with an estimate of say 0.8 e-h pair per photon (roughly the shape of the sensitivity curve below) I could make some estimate on how much light was reaching the photodetector. But how might I convert that to magnitude? I understand the logarithmic scale, but right now I just start with 1300 W/m^2 is magnitude -27 (roughly the Sun's characteristic) as a reference.

<p>For instance by interpreting the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan%E2%80%93Boltzmann_law"" rel=""noreferrer"">Stefan-Boltzmann law</a> I can derive the star's luminosity based on the surface temperature and the star's radius:</p>

According to the <a href=""https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Phases_Venus.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer"">Wikimedia Commons</a> link these are <a href=""http://www.eso.org/public/about-eso/esoglance/"" rel=""noreferrer"">ESO</a> images from the Venus transit 2004 <a href=""http://www.eso.org/public/outreach/eduoff/vt-2004/"" rel=""noreferrer"">VT-2004</a> observing campaign. </p>

<p>The ESO, or <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Southern_Observatory"" rel=""noreferrer"">European Southern Observatory</a>:</p>

</blockquote>

<p>These images are very high quality, and the last one, dated <code>8/6/04</code> (08-June-2004) appears to be taken at/near inferior conjunction, when Venus is almost directly between the observer and the Sun.</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> I'd like to understand with what instrument this image was taken, and how the technical challenges imaging Venus with such a small angular separation between it and the Sun <em>were overcome</em>! I did a quick check and during the UTC day of June 8th, 2004, Venus moved from about 0.6 to 1.1 degrees from the Sun as viewed by Earth. How was Venus imaged so nicely? Was this really imaged from the ground through Earth's daytime atmosphere, or from space? In either case, how was a high quality telescope pointed so close to the Sun and shielded from stray light and protected from damage?</p>

<blockquote>The heliopause is the theoretical boundary where the Sun's solar wind is stopped by the interstellar medium; where the solar wind's strength is no longer great enough to push back the stellar winds of the surrounding stars. This is the boundary where the interstellar medium and solar wind pressures balance.</blockquote>

If so, would the orbital inclinations of the planets currently in the ecliptic change independently or in unison? We know the ecliptic is inclined with respect to the galactic plane. Would that have been a consequence of ""residual"" angular momentum when the solar system formed, or did it gradually take up its present orientation?</p>

<p>My big question is: <strong>""Do we know it's instant?""</strong> We can't possibly move an object large enough to have a noticeable gravitational influence fast enough to measure if it creates (or doesn't create) a doppler-like phenomenon.</p>

<p>Because the Sun has a complex atmosphere and a net solar wind, I there may be some subtleties related to what sphere is used to establish the net charge Q inside, so rather than me define a radius it may be better to see what evidence is available. </p>

<p>Since there is an ionized component of the solar wind and protons are 2,000 times heavier than electrons, I'm thinking that an initially neutral Sun would loose electrons more rapidly than protons, until a strong enough static field was produced that would add the extra ""push"" for the protons to leave at the same rate, but that's an extremely simplistic model.</p>

<p>I'm asking primarily for some kind of <strong>measurement or experimental data rather than purely rationalization or hand-waving</strong>. Has there ever been an attempted measurement of the static residual charge of the Sun?</p>

<p><strong>Can there be an infinity of stars in the Universe ?</strong></p>

<p>I have 2 opposed reasonings, yet I don’t find any flaw in them. Can you help me here ?</p>

<p><strong>Answer A : No, the number of stars cannot be infinite.</strong></p>

<p>In the whole Universe, at an instant <em>t</em>, there are W molecules of water. This number may be very big, but it has a definite value. The same goes for stars. Each of all the stars at the instant <em>t</em> has her own size, and we can give her a name. We can list all of them, and we can sort them from nearest to farthest — if we are omniscient, of course.</p>

<p><strong>Answer B : Yes, the number of stars can be infinite.</strong></p>

<p>Space has no finite volume. Space has no ending wall. If I advance into space, I can always go further. Wherever I go, space is <em>by default</em> filled with… vacuum. But it could be otherwise. [I am not sure of this point.] Space could be <em>by default</em> filled with… air. So there would be +∞ molecules of air in the Universe. We can apply this reasoning to stars. Let’s say there is, in average, 1 star / 10<sup>60</sup> m<sup>3</sup>. So, in the total infinite volume of space, there would be +∞ stars. When I advance into space, I would keep meeting new stars, without end. Like in these video games in which mountains keep appearing as far as you walk.</p>

Now, if those coordinates are referred to the mean equator and equinox that epoch, then is the mean equator/equinox of the specific epoch considered the reference frame for those coordinates? </p>

<p>…and then how would you go about converting those coordinates to another reference frame like say the IRCF or FK5? I assume that I would need to precess them to J2000 accounting for any applicable proper motion (and if they referred to the true equator nutation). What else do you need to put them in either the ICRF or FK5 frames?</p>

<p>Also, something else I'm confused about is the epoch of a reference frame. So, let's say I have the IRCF astrometric coordinates of a planet at JD 2456963.5 TDB (or any other arbitrary date). Since they're IRCF coordinates, then the epoch of the reference frame is still J2000, but the coordinates refer to the instant of 2456963.5 TDB correct? </p>

Then $nKT \times 4\pi r^2=F_G$. The mass of the part of the star contained within radius $r$ from the center is $\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3\times m_sn$ where $m_s$ is the mass of each particle and $n$ is the number of particles per volume.<br>
Then we can rewrite $nKT \times 4\pi r^2=m(\frac{G\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3\times m_snF}{r^2})$ and simplify to $KTr=\frac{m}{3}Gm_s$. Isolating $T$ we get that $T=\frac{mGm_s}{3Kr}$.<br>
This seems to imply that the temperature decreases the further we are from the core, however I am not sure what $m$ should stand for in $F_g=mg$, should $m=m_s$, i.e be the mass of a single particle? Or does $m$ itself depend on the radius in which case the answer I got is invalid.<br>
Can someone verify that the answer I got is right? Thanks</p>

"What happens to oxygen produced on the Sun (or other stars)?","<p>Through nuclear fusion, the Sun can (or at the very least, someday will) <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple-alpha_process"">produce atoms of all elements up to and including oxygen</a>.  And in terrestrial chemistry at least, when you combine oxygen, hydrogen, and a small amount of heat you get water.  Or lithium and oxygen and heat will produce lithium oxide.  Those individual components are all readily available in a star like the Sun.</p>

<p>So my questions is, does the oxygen produced by the Sun (or any other star, now, in the future, or in the past) react chemically (for instance, through oxidation or combustion processes) with the other elements present in the star's atmosphere?  </p>

<p>Or I suppose more generally, do the elements formed through nuclear fusion in a star chemically interact to produce more complex molecules (and if not, then why not)?</p>

"Can we compress any object to create black Holes?","<p>In general, when a star runs out of nuclear fuel, gravity gets the upper hand and the material in the core is compressed even further and creates black holes. I am clear till  here. </p>

<p>Now the question is, Is it depends on the mass of the star (or Object)?</p>

<p>Naturally, the more massive the core of the star, the greater the force of gravity that compresses the material and easy to create Black Hole. </p>

<p>For smaller stars, when the nuclear fuel is exhausted and there are no more nuclear reactions to fight gravity, the repulsive forces among electrons within the star eventually create enough pressure to halt further gravitational collapse. The star then cools and dies PEACEFULLY. </p>

<p>If you accept till here, my question is, in the science videos and discussions, they say that, we can create Black hole from any object, i mean for example, if we are able to compress EARTH to the size of the Tennis Ball, then we can create Black Hole, Is it True? </p>

<p>Doesn't the Nuclear Fusion / Reaction is necessary to create Black Hole. Of course to fight against gravity we may require some kind of energy in this case, Nuclear reactions. But i am generally concerned like, does Nuclear Reaction is only to fight gravity, it does not play any other role in creating Black Hole.</p>

"Is it possible that a satellite creates a forever eclipse?","<p>So, to add a bit of context, I’m doing the NaNoWriMo challenge, which consists of writing a novel of 50k words in one month. My whole idea is based around the following question: What would happen if the sun were to suddenly disappear?</p>

<p>To make it short, the story is about a colony on a faraway planet, which is settled for few generations already. And one day or let’s say, in less than a month, the sun disappear. So far, so good. Except I need a valid reason as to why the sun disappear… I have found some ideas (dust from volcanic eruption, change of orbit, dying sun, etc…) but none of them looked good enough. (I’m open for suggestion if any.)</p>

This <a href=""https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/questions/6188/can-a-natural-satellite-exist-in-a-geostationary-orbit"">topic</a> lead me to think that if the satellite is in geostationary orbit, it is possible. <strike>But there is still some questions I can’t get my head around.</p>

<li>How fast a new satellite can “appear”?</li>
<li>Is it possible that a bigger but “lighter” (with less gravitational force) satellite can orbit around a smaller but “heavier” planet?</li>
<li>This <a href=""https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/questions/22265/long-term-temperature-effects-of-an-eclipse"">topic</a> reminded me that no sun means no heat. Can the geothermic activity of a planet be enough to prevent the surface from being impossible to live on?</strike> (Off topic.)</li>

"How bright can white dwarf stars glow as they accrue matter?","<p>I realize this is kind of general as it would depend on the size of the white dwarf and the rate of accrual.    The general idea I got thinking about is what would happen if a white dwarf star - lets say 0.8 solar mass, well below Chandrasekhar was to accrue a bunch of hydrogen rather quickly.  I thought it might be get very hot and bright, perhaps similar to a red giant for a relatively brief period of time.</p>

<p>Mostly White dwarfs add mass by siphoning from the outer layer from a near by co-orbiting star, but I imagine, that mostly happens quite slowly, not fast enough to make the white dwarf shine like a main sequence star.  </p>

<p>Are there studies on how quickly mass can be added in this way and how bright it makes the white dwarf?  Does Hydrogen quickly fuse on the surface of a white dwarf or does it need to build up to a certain thickness first, perhaps creating a mini flash? or does the fusion happen rather quickly.</p>

<p>A very rough calculation, the escape velocity of a white dwarf, which would be similar to the terminal velocity of matter (mostly hydrogen) falling into it is about 5,500,000 meters/second for a 1 solar mass white dwarf.  <a href=""http://www.astronomynotes.com/evolutn/s13.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">Source</a>. </p>

<p>The velocity needed for hydrogen fusion is about 20,000,000 meters per second.  <a href=""http://physics.ucsd.edu/do-the-math/2012/01/nuclear-fusion/"" rel=""nofollow"">Source</a> (under the what makes fusion hard section).   So, white dwarf's aren't massive enough to create fusion upon impact, but the high density and high heat of impact seems like it could create fusion relatively quickly as matter builds up around them, perhaps creating something that perhaps glows like a star and expands rather rapidly - assuming there's a sustained burn and not a kind of very quick explosion of sorts.   I think it could glow very hot and perhaps expand rather large, but I'm just kind of guessing.</p>

<p>If a white dwarf was to crash into, say, a brown dwarf or very low mass star, hydrogen rich, say about .1 solar mass?   Such a brown dwarf would be much larger than the white dwarf but also quite a bit lighter, probably light enough to get penetrated completely though the impact would also likely create fusion and it's difficult for me to imagine what would happen with so violent a crash.   It seems to me that the density of the white dwarf, if it could retain most of the matter from the brown dwarf would be sufficient that you'd be left with a fast burning light weight fusion star, with a very dense core.   This might be an impossible question, but how quickly would a .8 solar mass white dwarf consume the hydrogen from a .1 solar mass brown dwarf, should this rare kind of collision happen.   Would it actually form a star-like object for a period of time, say a million years or so, or would the enormous energy of impact basically blow it apart no new star?  Perhaps a near miss and an inside the Roche limit approach would be better than a direct impact for new star formation.</p>

And when universe will accelerate to the speed of light, then time should stop.</p>

<p>Does time slow down because universe is expanding at an accelerating rate?
Can any physicist explains if this is true or not?</p>

"Visibility of human activity on the moon","<p>In <a href=""http://youtu.be/UHU226kWZIA"">this video</a> the host of Test Tube Plus states that</p>

<ul>
<li>you can go out a buy a laser, point it at the moon, and see the retroreflector left by the astronauts.  When you point at the right spot you'll see a reflection, elsewhere not.  He reiterates that this is not just a hypothetical use of 2nd person for effect, but that <em>you</em> the viewer can go out and try this yourself, and anyone paying any attention to moonlanding conspiracy theories ought to try it</li>
<li>tracks and artefacts at the landing site can be seen with amateur telescopes, and again this is approachable to anyone who cares to look</li>
</ul>

<p>Neither of these seem correct to me.  Could someone with real numbers weigh in on this?</p>

<p>I seem to recall that seeing artefacts is only possible in the latest high-res images taken from lunar orbit, and the telescope that uses the reflector gets back single photons on some trials and is a much more powerful laser than you could buy!  But, a continuous beam may be different? How big of a laser would you need to see a reflection with a viewing instrument that doesn't cost more than the laser?</p>

"Trying to categorize moon phase using fraction illuminated","<p>I have a dataset with events that are occurring over a period of 5 years. I am trying to determine whether these events are related to moon phase. I downloaded the ""fraction of moon illuminated"" for the time period, but am struggling to define the cutpoints for crescent, quarter, and gibbous. These are defined by the USNO as 0.25, 0.5, and 0.75 (<a href=""http://aa.usno.navy.mil/data/docs/MoonFraction.php"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://aa.usno.navy.mil/data/docs/MoonFraction.php</a>) but I am seeking to divide the period into 8 bins of equal time. I think it is a sine function, where the period is 29.53059 days. If I divide this by 8, I get: 3.69132375 days.</p>

<p>Can anyone help me determine the fraction illuminated (y) that corresponds to these outpoints?</p>

<p>0 days</p>

<p>3.69132375 days</p>

<p>7.3826475 days</p>

"Has the Big Crunch been ruled out?","<p>If the dark energy equation of state <span class=""math-container"">$\omega$</span> evolves with time, and becomes larger, this would result in decelerated expansion and eventually a Big Crunch. If <span class=""math-container"">$\omega$</span> decreases with time, becoming more negative, then a Big Rip would occur. I understand that the Big Rip has not yet been ruled out by current observations, but I often hear that the Big Crunch has been ruled out since we know the universe is expanding (and accelerating).</p>

<p>If the Big Rip can't currently be ruled out, then how can the Big Crunch be ruled out? Shouldn't they both still be on the table, unless we can somehow infer which direction <span class=""math-container"">$\omega$</span> evolves in under a quintessence model?</p>

"What happens to the momentum of a star as its mass is converted to energy?","<p>Stars move relative to many frames of reference.  We can use the CBR for this question, I suppose, but it may not matter.  Their momentum p=mass x velocity.</p>

<p>Stars lose mass as it is converted to energy. Percentage-wise it isn't much, but it is tons per second, so it isn't negligible.
What happens to the momentum of the star as it loses mass? Presumably it is conserved, so does the velocity of the star increase?  Or does the overall system carry off some momentum with the energy, leaving the stellar velocity constant?</p>

<p>I honestly don't even know what kind of telescope to purchase. I live in a capital city, so there is a lot of light around here. My apartment is high with a balcony, which is where I would place it and there is nothing in front of me from there.</p>

"Would this effect occur if an ice planet was put into orbit or trajectory?","<p>Imagine an earth getting warmer. Humans decide to make their homes ready for a voluntary ice age. All the space agencies work together to get an icy planet/moon into our orbit between us and the sun.</p>

<p>My theory is that because the sun is heating up the ice and blowing it in the direction of earth, it'll make the Earth colder.</p>

<p>That final part is my question: Could ice molten in space eventually reach earth and perhaps be pushed in that direction by its heat?? Not taking into account whether or not it would benefit the earth.</p>

<p>I am fascinated by his explanation, I cant wait for the astronomy community to tell me the answers this guy is asking.</p>

<p>Ok this is the question I am pasting it here after being requested by a member on the comment section-</p>

<p>His tite is - 
How can i convince my atheist friend that God exists???</p>

<p>Apparently he seems to be religious person, who has some points to make.
This is the description of his question-</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is this friend that I have who believes in science and doesnt believe in religion. We have had many arguements, and it raises many interesting questions. I am posting this to see Answercup users opinion on it. If scientists say that Big bang is proven I have some simple questions . What happened before the big bang according to these scientists? And this big bang theory came from scientists thinking that the universe expands so if we reverse the time, it will do the opposite and come to one single point....but then if it did come from a point, I found that the expansion is INCREASING which is weird. How on earth can it be a blast , because obv like any blast it should decreases and come to a hault , here instead of the universe expansion decelerating its actually accelerating. How can these so called scientists tell something is right when common sense which can be understood by primary school children shows clearly that they are wrong ??? Plus how can you seriously get a blast from empty space ? If scientist says thats the beginning of time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With his question, I remembered watching the vedio ""Does god exist"" on Discovery channel by stephen hawking. His explanations wasnt complete and he bragged about how there is no need for god, but his explanation never explained many parts. And then there are scientists who gives the excuse laws of physics break at the point of the big bang so we can't explain. So this brought my mind a new question, if scientists still cant understand what has happens in the big bang , how can they tell that God doesnt exist, and stuff like that and make them appear as facts, if they knew the physics at the big bang and talked then its fine, but here they are talking without even knowing those.</p>

"Average number and type of planets orbiting given star types","<p>I don't need ""exact"" numbers, but I'm trying to create an auto-generator for a stellar map to crate stars that are ""somewhat"" accurate.</p>

<p>I'm looking for numbers on the average number and type of planets around each type of Star, and whether they could be a good source for mining or are they good places for life?</p>

<p>So, like, I need an idea of how what is the average number of planets that are expected around a G class star, how many are expected to be Gas giants or terrestrial and what is the likelihood of them being in the habitable zone and containing life. </p>

<p>If I base it on Sol I would suspect about 10 planets, 50% terrestrial and 50% gas giants, with 1 to 3 in the habitable zone and a 30% chance of life developing. I'm looking for something similar to this type of information.</p>

<p>I assume this wouldn't be good for across the board or even for G class stars in general.</p>

<p>So I guess I'm looking for estimated planetary statistics based on spectral type? I don't want a list of exoplanet and stars that I have to look through and then make a bad guess at, but a good estimation of these numbers based on known facts.</p>

"What is the escape velocity of our Galaxy relative to?","<p>I've been thinking that everything has a relative escape velocity, if it has Mass, seemingly. You can escape orbit around the earth by accelerating enough. You can escape the orbit of the sun by accelerating enough. Heck, this is kind of a stretch, but even electrons can escape an atom relative to how much electric charge the nucleus holds. What would it be like to escape the orbital velocity of our Galaxy-- and what exactly would it be relative to-- a black hole at the center of the Galaxy? </p>

<p>The quote was:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Solar system's orbital velocity is estimated at roughly 220 km/s, and galactic escape velocity for our vicinity at about 537 km/s. So in the direction of Solar system's velocity vector, velocity required to escape Milky Way is ~ 317 km/s. And much more, if this Solar system's own orbital momentum cannot be used to full extent and a launch in other directions is required. This is of course assuming you can launch on a trajectory that avoids getting too close to gravitational influence of other solar systems.</p>

<p>You'll notice there are quite a lot of dates where H (the hour angle) is undefined. I understand from a trigonometric standpoint why it is incalculable, but is there a scientific reason for this? Also, how do they calculate when the sun will set and when the sun will rise on those days? Is it an average of the last known date and the next known date?</p>

<p>What is the hour angle, exactly, and how do you calculate the sunrise/sunset if you can't calculate it?</p>
"
"Do all stars of a given age and mass have relatively the same emission spectrum?","<p>My understanding is that much of the visible light that we see during the day is given off from the Sun, and that means that most of the colors that we see are dictated by (with the exception of atmospheric effects) the particular wavelengths of color that the Sun emits, which does not include the entire continuous color spectrum.</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.noao.edu/image_gallery/images/d5/sun.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Here is an image of the wavelengths emitted by the Sun</a></p>

<p>My understanding is also that, at least during a particular part of the life cycle of a star, all stars are burning balls of hydrogen and helium. If that is the case, then do all stars at that point in their life give off emission spectra of visible light that is similar to our own? Is it possible that an observer on a planet with an atmosphere similar to that of Earth might see different ranges of color than we do, simply due to, perhaps, the composition of their star? Could there be planets similar to Earth where the sky would appear purple rather than blue?</p>

<p>Let me know if any of my assumptions are incorrect.</p>
"
"Gallery of 'actual images' from space?","<p>Where can a gallery of actual unaltered photographic images taken in (or of) space be found? Specifically ones that are untouched, not colorized (not necessarily black and white, but they usually are), and taken by natural light photography? Pictures and videos claiming ""actual image"" are few and far between.</p>

<p>E.g., this:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/LlCt7.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/LlCt7.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Not false color:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/vFuPa.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/vFuPa.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Both of these pictures are from NASA's (Voyager) <a href=""http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/image/saturn.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Saturn Images</a> gallery. Some of the other ones there are listed as false color, some aren't (but obviously they are). Or maybe not so obviously, hence the question: <em>what does it really look like out there?</em></p>

<p>I've a pretty good idea of what Saturn looks like IRL, because I've seen it in a telescope (exactly like the first picture, except it's more colorful - absolutely nothing like the second). For most other celestial objects, I have no such baseline.</p>

<p>The title of the website I'm looking for would be along the lines of: <em>View of our solar system through the eyes of a human.</em> Decidedly, <em>not</em> containing any pictures from the HST, as all of them are photoshopped.</p>

"How to choose portable, yet powerful telescope","<p>Due to the nature of my job, I have to spend log periods of time (4 - 6 months each), at different countries across Europe, Middle East and Far East. I have a 12 Inch Dobsonian at home, but I rarely spend 1 month a year, at home. Travelling with the Dob is out of question due to its weight and I don't always have access to low lying windows or a rooftop when abroad, making a dob pretty useless. I really want to have at one, at least 8"", portable option while I'm travelling. Celestron NexStar 8 SE is looking good to me at the moment. It seems to have half the weight of an 8"" scope with equatorial mount and from what I've heard, it can be used table-top, without tripod. I can also carry the OTA in hand luggage, to avoid damage to optical components. Can someone confirm if</p>

<ul>

<p>I was wondering, do we in fact know <strong>if our Sun</strong> in particular was created as part of a star-forming-cluster, or, was it more of a solo creation?</p>

<p>(Or, are all stars created as part of star-forming-clusters, is that the norm and how all stars come to be?)</p>

"How are constraints on dark energy improved the most?","<p>Today we have various data available from independent probes to constrain dark energy, i.e. its equation of state <span class=""math-container"">$w$</span>. These include Type 1a supernovae, BAO, CMB, large-scale galaxy surveys, etc. Are any of these probes better/more powerful at constraining dark energy than the others? Why or why not? </p>

<p>For example, I assume that if a galaxy survey includes 1000 galaxies in a redshift range <span class=""math-container"">$0.1&lt;z&lt;1.2$</span>, that would result in higher constraints on <span class=""math-container"">$w$</span> than just using 500 Type 1a supernovae in a range <span class=""math-container"">$0.1&lt;z&lt;0.8$</span>. But how much of a difference does this, among other factors I'm unaware of, make? Quantitatively, how do the errors/uncertainties scale with larger samples and larger redshift intervals (I think for a larger sample the uncertainty decreases as <span class=""math-container"">$1/\sqrt N$</span>)?</p>

<p>It also makes sense that dark energy models with more free parameters would come with a larger uncertainity (for example, <span class=""math-container"">$wCDM$</span> has 1 more free parameter, <span class=""math-container"">$w$</span>, than <span class=""math-container"">$\Lambda CDM$</span>). But how much is the constraining power diminished for each new degree of freedom? See plots (Figure 9, <a href=""https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.01091.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.01091.pdf</a>):</p>

<p>In the plot on the right, clearly the constraints are much looser because more free parameters were introduced in fitting the data to this time-dependent dark energy model. We can also see that the SN1a data, for example, seems to constrain dark energy less than CMB or BAO data. Why is this? Is it because SN1a have only been observable at lower redshifts so far?</p>

"How did the reionization epoch make the universe ""transparent""?","<p>I've been reading about the reionization epoch of the universe, and it isn't entirely clear to me.  </p>

<p>As I understand it, very shortly after the big bang the universe was ionized, with the electrons stripped from the protons of hydrogen. The way that it's described is that the universe was ""opaque"" (since it was filled with ionized gas). Then the universe cooled enough for neutral hydrogen to form again, and the universe became ""transparent"". When the first stars and galaxies began to form they reionized the universe.  </p>

<p>What I don't understand is that in illustrations of this reionization, during the reionization epoch, it seems that the universe isn't transparent, but filled with unionized IGM (neutral hydrogen). Then the ionizing radiation from the newly formed stars ionizes the medium and ... these bubbles of ionized regions grow and merge until the entire universe is ionized again (and is therefore transparent).   </p>

<p>Have I misunderstood when the universe is transparent? Or the definition of transparent? Would it be accurate to say that the present day universe is completely ionized? (Does this just mean that most matter is in the form of stars which can be considered ionized? Since it doesn't really seem immediately evident in everyday life that ""everything is ionized"")</p>

"Dynamical modelling of galaxies with counter-rotating components using the Schwarzschild method","<p>I am currently trying to understand dynamical modelling using Schwarzschild's method. I have been doing some reading the past days, but I suspect that I am getting something really wrong. According to my current understanding, the Schwarzschild method for dynamical modelling using spatially-resolved kinematic data works like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Fit one or more 2D profiles (e.g., Gaussian) to the image or zeroth moment of the observation.</li>
<li>De-project the above fitted model to 3D space and create a 3D luminosity distribution.</li>
<li>Convert the 3D luminosity distribution to mass using a bunch of mass particles.</li>
<li>Create a series of possible orbits for the above mass particles and calculate the resulting velocity vectors.</li>
<li>From the above velocity vectors create velocity and velocity dispersion maps and calculate the chi-squared between them and the observed velocity and velocity dispersion maps. </li>
</ul>

<p>The last step is what troubles me. To my understanding, the orbits of the particles in a Schwarzschild model can be counter-rotating. Right? In a galaxy observation, when we have two collisionless components (e.g., stellar components) that counter-rotate, it is possible that we will observe double-peaked spectral lines. Right? This information is impossible to be stored using a velocity and a velocity dispersion map, but it can be stored in a spectral cube. Yet, all papers on dynamical modelling using the Schwarzschild method fit models to velocity and velocity dispersion maps instead of a spectral cube.</p>

<p>So, from the above I have concluded that my understanding of the Schwarzschild method is not correct. I would really appreciate if someone could help me to understand what I am getting wrong. </p>

<p>The plan sees me getting a telescope, tripod and mount of some sort (equatorial I believe I need?), and periodically putting that carefully into my car, driving into a rural area with dark skies and clear horizons, and pointing it at interesting things - my urban gardenless flat really isn't a good location for this.</p>

<h1>Sure. Aberration is always the same. Parallax depends on the distance, and the phase is different.</h1>

<p>Why is their phase different? They all have a one year period.</p>

<p>Generally we should not worry about the light aberration, right? Even space telescopes have reference stars. The position of the reference stars are fixed. So although there are detectable wobble(20"") in one year , because we use reference stars, this kind of effect is removed every day immediately.

"Is the Milankovitch calendar provably better than the Gregorian one considering a non-constant tropical year?","<p>It's somewhat of a no-brainer the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revised_Julian_calendar"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">revised Julian calendar</a> (attibuted to Milankovitch) is more accurate than the Gregorian one just because it started with a more accurate estimate of the duration of the tropical year. From (the English translation) of <a href=""http://myweb.ecu.edu/mccartyr/orthodox-reform.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Milankovitch's 1923 paper</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A complete adoption of the Gregorian calendar was, however, not advisable either from a religious or scientific standpoint because the astronomical data concerning the length of the tropical year which lay at the base of the Gregorian reform are now replaced by others.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In fact one (unpublished?) <a href=""http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.527.7023&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">paper by Lichtenberg and Richter (1998)</a> explains the difference between the two calendars as a better continued fraction approximation of the number 0.781 = (36 525 − 36 524.219), i.e. the of difference between the Julian year and the tropical year (as approximately measured more recently), with the Gregorian rational approximation of that 0.781 being 3/4 and the Milankovitch one being 7/9. (It's actually a bit more complicated as there's a second parameter to approximate, but I don't care to elaborate on the other one here.)</p>

<p>But what I want to ask: <strong>is this superiority of the Milankovitch calendar still true considering (more realistic) models in which the tropical year is not constant?</strong> I actually break this down into two sub-questions...</p>

<p>I could easily find <a href=""https://www.jstor.org/stable/24966597"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">a comparison (Moyer, 1982)</a> of the Julian and Gregorian calendars using the Newcomb model for the tropical year:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/G6ZVR.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/G6ZVR.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p><strong>What would the Milankovitch calendar look like on that graph?</strong> (Or e.g. using a more sophisticated <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_year#Mean_tropical_year_current_value"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">cubic model of the tropical year</a>, what would they look like).</p>

<p>And further, considering what we don't know about the uncertainties of the tropical year, e.g. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_year#Calendar_year"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">according to Wikipedia</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If society in the future still attaches importance to the synchronization between the civil calendar and the seasons, another reform of the calendar will eventually be necessary. According to Blackburn and Holford-Strevens (who used Newcomb's value for the tropical year) if the tropical year remained at its 1900 value of 365.24219878125 days the Gregorian calendar would be 3 days, 17 min, 33 s behind the Sun after 10,000 years. Aggravating this error, the length of the tropical year (measured in Terrestrial Time) is decreasing at a rate of approximately 0.53 s per century. Also, the mean solar day is getting longer at a rate of about 1.5 ms per century. These effects will cause the calendar to be nearly a day behind in 3200. The number of solar days in a ""tropical millennium"" is decreasing by about 0.06 per millennium (neglecting the oscillatory changes in the real length of the tropical year).[3] This means there should be fewer and fewer leap days as time goes on. A possible reform would be to omit the leap day in 3200, keep 3600 and 4000 as leap years, and thereafter make all centennial years common except 4500, 5000, 5500, 6000, etc. But the quantity <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%94T"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ΔT</a> is not sufficiently predictable to form more precise proposals (Blackburn &amp; Holford-Strevens 2003, p. 692).</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Is the error with which we can estimate the duration of future tropical years <em>greater</em> than the difference between the Milankovitch and Gregorian calendars?</strong> The year 2800 is leap in Gregorian but not in Milankovitch's calendar. That's ""pretty close"" to the suggestion in the last quote to make 3200 not leap, which suggests that the difference between the two calendars is greater than the error currently incurred in estimating tropical year duration. So it looks like one could still answer the question whether Milankovitch's calendar is provably better than the (unmodified) Gregorian one even considering estimation errors for the tropical year duration. Is that a correct assessment though?</p>

<p>In contrast to that model cited in Wikipedia, <a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1991JRASC..85..121B"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Borkowski (1991)</a> (using a quadratic model for the tropical year, which he finds is a good approximation of the VSOP92 cubic model for the next 4000 years) concludes that </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>our Gregorian calendar will not deviate from the exact solar calendar by significantly more than 1 day for some 2000 years to come.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So it looks like that would make the year 2800 (non-leap in Milankovitch's) a rather premature correction...</p>

<p>Moyer also contains this passage:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In 1582 the
  length of the tropical year was nearly
  365.24222 days, which differed from the
  Gregorian year by only a little more
  than 24 seconds. If the length of the year
  itself were not gradually diminishing,
  the calendar under the plan devised by
  Lilius would retain the date of the vernal
  equinox at or about March 21 for
  more than 3,550 years.</p>
  
  <p>Clavius himself estimated that the
  calendar would deviate by one day in
  the year 5084. Considering the decline
  in the length of the year, which was quite
  unknown to 16th-century astronomers,
  the calendar will remain accurate to
  within one mean solar day for a much
  shorter time, some 2,417 years, or until
  about the year 4317. (Extrapolations are
  based on the determination of the tropical
  year at epoch 1900 by the American
  astronomer Simon Newcomb; his figure
  was 365.24219879 mean solar days.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which again is concluding (using the linear model of Newcomb) that Gregorian  calendar is better than  Milankovitch claims.</p>

"Could a habitable satellite of a gas giant have a stable subsatellite?","<p>I have set a science fiction story on a moon, orbiting a gas giant (which orbits its star at approximately the same orbit as the Earth around the Sun), and given this moon its own satellites.  The moon is Earth-sized, and the moon’s satellites are on the order of a large asteroid each (perhaps up to half the size of the Moon … Luna if there was any confusion with the number of times I said ‘moon’ in this post.)</p>

<p>I am a computer nerd, not an astronomer, so I’m wondering if this is something that is at least possible?

Could the moon be habitable?</p>

"What's a good model for the vernal equinox year? Can it increase forever?","<p><a href=""http://astrogeo.oxfordjournals.org/content/43/2/2.9.1.full.pdf+html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Duncan Steel (2002)</a> makes an interesting argument that the notion of year is (1) somewhat arbitrary and, more interestingly (2) one notion of year can increase while another decreases.</p>

<p>His examples are <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_year#18th_and_19th_century"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">tropical year</a> (which decreases over time, at least in the linear Newcomb model) and the vernal equinox year which seems to be currently increasing.</p>

<p>Actually looking at the data that his point is based on, namely <a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1992JBAA..102...40M"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Meeus and Savoie (1992)</a>, we can find another measure that is decreasing, namely the solstice year(s), either June or December; the autumnal equinox year is also decreasing:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/sVbrf.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/sVbrf.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Steel actually uses the fact that the  vernal equinox year is increasing as an argument that the Gregorian calendar is ""getting better"" in a sense that it's closer to hitting its target year length. (The opposite is the case if one consider say either of the solstice years... or the tropical year, which is the point that a lot of other people make, e.g. <a href=""https://www.jstor.org/stable/24966597?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Moyer (1982)</a>.)</p>

<p>What I really want to ask here: assuming a simple linear decrease model for the tropical year (e.g. Newcomb), will the trends of the equinox and solstice years reverse at some point in the future?</p>

<p>(And if it's not too much extra to ask:) What are the implications of the more complex models for the tropical year (e.g. cubic VSOP) on the evolution of the equinox and solstice years?</p>

"Solar and lunar eclipses -- how rare","<p>I was fortunate enough to see the solar eclipse in southern Illinois last year.

It is an eerie sensation, and I cannot imagine how utterly terrifying it must have been for our ancient ancestors to see the moon eating the Sun.</p>

<p>However, it got me wondering. A solar eclipse can occur in the spectacular fashion it does because the angular dimension on the moon and the Sun are almost exactly the same -- this despite the fact that they are dramatically different in actual dimension. This seems a remarkable coincidence to me -- the ratio of the distances being almost exactly the same as the ratio of their diameters. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>V471 Tau, a white dwarf-red dwarf eclipsing binary (EB) in the Hyades with orbit period $0^d.52118$, is primarily known for its unique historical role as a stimulus to common envelope evolution theory (Chau et al. 1974; Refsdal 1974; Sparks &amp; Stecher 1974; Ostriker 1976; Paczynski 1976; Alexander et al. 1976; Taam et al. 1978). Other properties include a likely brown dwarf companion to the EB, measured white dwarf spin, mass loss and exchange in a detached binary, differential rotation measured via magnetic spots, spot distributions, accurate white dwarf parameters, and photometric-spectroscopic distance measures that help to pin down the binary’s location within the Hyades.</p>

This is a task I read from a book, and the solution states that the Moon covers a ""ribbon"" of width $\alpha$ where $\alpha = 0.5 ^{\circ} + 2*1^{\circ} + 2*5.3 ^ {\circ} = $ angular diameter of the Moon + 2*the Moon's daily parallax + 2*the inclination of the Moon's orbit to the ecliptic; and length $360 ^{\circ}$.<br>
Why is this like this, I understand the diameter and parallax part, but I couldn't visualize the problem very well. Why is the third number the inclination to the ecliptic and not to the equator?</p>

"Exactly what in Saturn has been located to within 4 km precision?","<p><a href=""http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=4434"" rel=""noreferrer"">Saturn has been located</a> with fantastic precision thanks to Cassini and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Very-long-baseline_interferometry"" rel=""noreferrer"">VLBI</a>. The location of the 120,000 km diameter giant planet (when defining the 1 bar pressure level as its surface) is known to within 4 kilometers. This has already been helpful in the (preliminary) discovery and characterization of ""planet nine"".</p>

<p>I suppose it is the Saturn system's barycenter which has been located gravitationally. At this level of precision I suppose that the moons', especially Titan's tidal effects must be considered. But also Saturn's flattened shape and maybe even weather systems. Saturn is known to be lumpy inside, this has been discovered by the effects it has on the inner rings. Such lumps have similar effects as a moon, so I wonder if these too are being considered at the 4 km precision level, and overall exactly how the point located is defined?</p>

"Did Gaia actually generate complete light curves for 212 Cepheids in other galaxies?","<p>The recent BBC news item <a href=""http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-37438458"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Gaia clocks speedy cosmic expansion</a> says that a recent Gaia measurement of 212 Cepheid variables in other galaxies within the local group yields a Hubble constant of ~73 km/s/Mpc which is in agreement with a previous measurement using the Hubble telescope.</p>

<p>The results are reported in: <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.05175"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">A test of Gaia Data Release 1 parallaxes: implications for the local distance scale</a>. I have included Figure 1 at the end here. If I understand correctly, the x-axis or ""Photometric Parallax"" represents photometric data which is compared to a model to yield a distance, which is then expressed as an equivalent parallax. </p>

<p>Gaia is not a ""point and shoot"" instrument like the Hubble telescope. It has a slow, extremely steady rotation in order to scan at least 1.5 full revolutions - enough for every start in the scan to pass <a href=""https://space.stackexchange.com/a/18237/12102"">completely across the CCD array through both telescopes</a>.</p>

<p>But this isn't an optimal observing plan for collecting data on a group of Cepheids. Although there are similarities, the light curves of different stars will be distinct. <em>Am I naive to think that it is necessary to build up a nice, complete light curve with dense points in time in order to use the photometry for precision distance calculations?</em> Was this actually done within Gaia's survey observing program, or was there a special observing plan for the Cepheid measurements?</p>

<p>The data also needs to be good enough to calculate the periods of each star with sufficient precision. The curve of absolute magnitude vs period is quite steep at low periods, meaning the error in the calculated distance is strongly affected by an error in the period.</p>

<p>And could someone help me understand - what is a TGAS parallax?</p>

"Does the Sun orbit the Milky way in a (kind of) flat or inclined orbit or more of a sine wave?","<p>I know it can't be a perfect ellipse or smooth orbit due to all the matter in every direction, and our Sun could be affected by a gravity assist of sorts if it passes close enough to another massive star. I also know that galaxy orbits are different than Solar System orbits because most of the mass is in the dark matter halo and as a result, the outer stars orbit faster than in a standard orbit, so there's a number of variables.</p>

<p>But, if we ignore gravity assists, is the sun mostly in a standard, or lightly inclined orbit around the center of the Milky way or more sinusoidal?</p>

<p>Reason I'm asking - see (attached and in my opinion, bad) <a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/news/leading-harvard-physicist-radical-theory-160000092.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">article</a>, and picture included.</p>

<p>I've seen pictures like this before that suggests that the Solar System moves in a kind of sine wave motion. I've seen estimates between 26 and 32 million years with the solar-system, rising above then below the plane of the Milky way with consistency (and perhaps, mass extinctions tied to this movement).   </p>

<p>I can kind of see that happening, as the sun rises above it might have more gravitational pull below it drawing it back down and you kind of have a horizontal velocity to displacement cycle creating a sine wave in the orbit. That makes logical sense, but I'm wondering if that 26-32 million year sine wave type of movement is generally accepted or more somebody's imagination. Is anything definitive known about stars' orbits within galaxies?</p>

"Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) HDU `or_mask` - what does it mean exactly?","<p>I'm looking at the Sloan Digital Sky Survey data.

<p>There's been a lot of confusion here about what the <code>or_mask</code> is doing exactly, and the documentation hasn't been extremely clear.</p>

<p>My understanding so far is that the <code>or_mask</code> tells me when a particular pixel was flagged in one of many ways possible. I've understood from various random sources that this means the pixel is ""bad"" somehow. I haven't yet figured out how to know exactly ""why"" it is bad, my working assumption is that the possibilities are numerous, that there are many fields that have flags that might answer that question.</p>

<p>My primary question: Is every flux value with a non-zero <code>or_mask</code> inherently untrustworthy?</p>

<p>About 80% of pixels have a non-zero <code>or_mask</code> value, particularly on the bluer end of the spectrum.</p>

<p>Or is the <code>or_mask</code> telling me more broadly that there's a flag somewhere, not necessarily even with the flux data, that I might want to consider?</p>

 and perceived as fast (it took 3-4 seconds to disappear in the horizon) - so total exposure if I had seen it from start to end would have been less than 10-12 seconds.</p>

<p>One could barely notice it, it had some texture like a rock but blurry. It had almost no light reflection and it wasn't rotating or anything. It wasn't spherical and it was somewhat elongated along the axis of movement. I was barely able to detect it above me with naked eyes, as it was passing from left to right. I only did when I saw it was hiding a small region of the night sky stars. This way I perceived its irregular shape.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I cannot tell it's actual size or how fast it was going. Is it an object of a kind known to astronomers?

<h3>2 - Location dependent calculus</h3>

<p>Initially I'm using <code>ro=1.0</code> and following the below sequence to obtain an approximation of <code>phi</code>, which is the Latitude.</p>

<pre><code>ro = 1.0
e = 0.0818192 // earth eccentricity 
sin_d = sin(d * pi / 180.0)
cos_d = cos(d * pi / 180.0)
zeta = sqrt(ro^2 + x^2 + y^2)
cos_theta = (-y * sin_d + zeta * cos_d) / ro
sin_phi_1 = (y * cos_d + zeta * sen_d) / ro
cos_phi_1 = sqrt( (x/ro)^2 + cos_theta^2 )
phi_1 = asin(sin_phi_1) / pi * 180.0
phi = atan(sin_phi_1 / cos_phi_1 / sqrt(1 - e^2)) / pi * 180.0
</code></pre>

<p>At this point <code>phi = 58.1224</code> for 18:00 hs UTC. </p>

<p>Once <code>phi</code> was calculated, we recalculate <code>ro</code> as follow to get a better approximation of <code>phi</code> and <code>varpi</code> (not yet calculated)</p>

<pre><code>sin_phi = sin(phi * pi / 180.0)
ro1 = sqrt( (1 - 2e^2 * sin_phi^2 + e^4 * sin_phi^2) / (1 - e^2 * sin_phi^2) )
</code></pre>

<p>Applying the updated <code>ro</code> (now <code>ro1</code>), we update <code>sin_d</code> and <code>cos_d</code> as follow:</p>

<pre><code>sin_d1 = sin_d / ro1;
cos_d1 = sqrt(1-e^2) * (cos_d / ro1)
</code></pre>

<p>And update <code>zeta</code> and <code>cos_theta</code></p>

<pre><code>zeta1 = sqrt(ro1^2 + x^2 + y^2)
cos_theta1 = (-y * sin_d1 + zeta1 * cos_d1) / ro1
</code></pre>

<p>Finally we calculate <code>vapri</code> (the Longitud) as follows:</p>

<pre><code>tan_theta = x / cos_theta1
theta = atan( tan_theta ) / Math.PI * 180.0
vapri = u - theta * ro1
</code></pre>

<p>and recalculate <code>phi</code> by doing:</p>

<pre><code>cos_phi2 =  cos_theta1 / cos(theta / 180.0 * pi)
phi1 = acos(cos_phi2) / pi * 180.0 
phi = atan(tan(phi1 / 180.0 * pi) / sqrt(1 - e^2)) / pi * 180.0
</code></pre>

<p>At this point <code>phi = 58.2795 , vapri = 21.7901</code> for 18:00 hs UTC (both values MUST be properly signed but I omitted that trivial part) a significant difference compared with the NASA prediction: 58.2683, 21.5733 (13 km or 8 mile)</p>

<p>My feeling is that <code>ro1</code> in not good enough precise, so the final results get shifted, but I have no idea at all about how to getting unblocked. </p>

<p>I'm using 64 bit floating point calculator; It is ok for this kind of calculus?</p>

<p>Is this method good enough to get an error range near to 500m? if not, could you provide a method/fix to achieve that aim. </p>

<p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>

"Conversion of magnitudes to Jansky and MAGPHYS?","<p>I'm a bit puzzled and not an observer, so please bear with me if I'm being stupid here. </p>

<p>The code <a href=""http://www.iap.fr/magphys/magphys/MAGPHYS.html"" rel=""nofollow"">MAGPHYS</a> specifies Jansky (<code>Jy</code>) as the input unit for flux through a filter (see <code>Section 3.2.3</code> in the <a href=""http://www.iap.fr/magphys/magphys/MAGPHYS_files/readme.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">documentation</a>). Meaning MAGPHYS wants me to use <code>Jy</code> as unit, when specify the total light of a whole galaxy in e.g. the SDSS-g band. But <code>Jy</code> is a unit of spectral <em>density</em>, i.e. <code>W/m²/Hz</code>. I would expect a flux as input unit when talking about the amont of light coming through a filter, i.e. in <code>W/m²</code> or in $L_\odot$ (solar luminosity), so integrated over all frequencies that go through the filter and weighted by the filter response function.</p>

<p>If I have the absolute AB magnitude of a galaxy in the SDSS-g band, how do I convert it to <code>Jy</code> so that MAGPHYS will be happy?</p>

<p>I'm aware of:</p>

<p>$m_{\text{AB}\nu} = -2.5 \log_{10} \left(\frac{f_{\nu}}{3631\text{Jy}}\right) \qquad \text{or} \qquad \left(\frac{f_{\nu}}{\text{Jy}}\right) = 10^{-0.4\  (m_{\text{AB}\nu} - 8.9)}$</p>

<p>But that is in one frequency, not a whole band. </p>

<p>Additionally, I have found the formula below in <a href=""http://www.star.bris.ac.uk/~mbt/topcat/"" rel=""nofollow"">TOPCAT</a>:</p>

<p>$\left(\frac{F}{\text{Jy}}\right) = 10^{\left(23-0.4 \ (m_\text{AB}+48.6)\right)}$</p>

<p>Where does the <code>23</code> in the exponent come from?</p>

"Using emission lines to determine redshift of a quasar","<p>I am attempting this past paper question and am not sure how to tackle this, this is not homework! :)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The spectrum of a distant quasar shows two broad emission lines with observed
  wavelengths of 317.7nm and 404.7nm. The strongest lines are most likely to be either Lyman-α with a rest wavelength 121.6nm, CIV with a rest wavelength of 154.9nm or MgII with a rest wavelength of 280.0nm.</p>
  
  <p>(a) What is the redshift of the quasar? Please show your working.</p>
  
  <p>(b) What two lines have been detected?</p>
  
  <p>(c) The two lines have widths of 10nm and 20nm respectively. If I have measured
  the mass of the black hole in the quasar to be 10^9Msun, how far from the centre of the quasar are the regions of ionised gas responsible for the emission lines?
  Please specify any assumptions that you make to obtain your result.</p>

<p>I am assuming I must find z to be the ratio of the change in wavelength to the rest wavelength. However I'm unsure of how to identify these in the question.</p>

"Can Earth host another natural satellite than the Moon?","<p>Are there orbits with long-term stability (astronomical time scales) around Earth? Low altitude orbits will decay due to friction with Earth's atmosphere. Inside Earth's Roche limit, a Moon could not form anyway due tidal forces. At altitudes closer to that of the Moon, the Moon would presumably destabilize an orbit such that the object would either collide with Earth or the Moon or be ejected. </p>

<p>Many of the other planets in our solar system have multiple natural satellites; where this occurs, they are always vastly smaller than the primary - think of Jupiter, Saturn, and even Mars. On the other hand Earth, and apparently Pluto, each has only one natural satellite, relatively large in comparison to the primary. Is this because a large satellite will tend to clear the entire ""sphere of influence"" around its primary of any other material?</p>

<p>So my question is: does the existence of our Moon effectively prevent the formation or capture of any other natural satellite around Earth? (Considering only true satellites, not ""companion"" objects or quasi-satellites)</p>

"How small a star can provide Sun-level illumination to its planets?","<p>...or how small can a solar system be, to sustain an Earth-like planet?</p>

<p>I guess a Brown Dwarf wouldn't be enough to give that much within its Roche Limit, meaning any planet receiving enough light would be torn apart by tidal forces, and likely stepping up to smallest Main Sequence stars would step up the energy output enough that a planet at the Roche Limit would be scorched like Mercury, so its orbit would need to be considerably larger... but I don't quite know how to perform the needed calculations.</p>

"If two black hole event horizons overlap (touch) can they ever separate again?","<p>Hypothetical question based on my understanding that two event horizons that overlap (touch) can't ever separate again:</p>

<p>Imagine a 1 billion solar mass black hole (so the event horizon is massive and very gravitationally weak) is travelling at a velocity of 0.9c through empty flat intergalactic space; now imagine an identical 1 billion solar mass black hole travelling at 0.9c but in exactly the opposite direction so the two are heading roughly towards each other. The black holes' paths, once all the space time warping is taken into account, aren't on a direct collision but the outermost edges of the event horizons will just 'clip' each other, ordinarily only overlap for a fraction of a nanosecond as these two bodies are travelling at such incredibly fast velocities and in opposite directions to each other.</p>

<p>So firstly, am I right in thinking that if two event horizons overlap they can never 'unlap'?</p>

<p>Secondly, what would happen to this incredible amount of momentum of each other the black holes? Would it just get instantly turned into gravitational energy? Bearing in mind when black holes normally merge, it happens very slowly as black holes slowly move closer and closer together over millions of years giving off gravitational energy as that happens, so not in a fraction of a nanosecond as in this case.</p>

<p>And thirdly, what would this look like? Would the event horizons remain fairly spherical and the radiated energy just insane or would they stretch and warp into a kind of long thin elastic event horizon as they shoot past each other and then over time slow down and snap back to each other?</p>

The gravitational lensing effect from the clusters multiplies the images of the galaxies, producing up to 4 images of the same source.</p>

<p>Trying to parse the caption, I think that the two objects in the center are magnified images of the galaxies in the background, and so should be related to the source of the light in the Einstein ring. But they are yellow and the ring is pink.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The MUSE instrument on the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope has identified halos around distant galaxies. Previously, images of these glowing rings lacked detail, but astronomers were able to use a gravitational lensing effect of galaxy clusters to see detail and structure.</p>
  
  <p>Gravitational lensing occurs as an effect of Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity: mass bends light. So the gravitational fields of galaxy clusters bend light, acting like a magnifier of the galaxies behind them.</p>
  
  <p>The best observations of the halos by MUSE were released Monday, presented by Adélaïde Claeyssens during the annual meeting of the European Astronomical Society in Lyon, France. Claeyssens is a Ph.D. student at the Centre de Recherche Astrophysique de Lyon.</p>

  <p>Some astronomers believe that one reason Earth is habitable is that the gravity of Jupiter does help protect us from some comets. Long-period comets, in particular, enter the solar system from its outer reaches. Jupiter’s gravity is thought to sling most of these fast-moving ice balls out of the solar system before they can get close to Earth. So long-period comets are thought to strike Earth only on very long timescales of millions or tens of millions of years. Without Jupiter nearby, long-period comets would collide with our planet much more frequently.</p>

"What defines stationary vs spinning in space?","<p>To produce artificial gravity on a space station, we simply spin it around some central point, and the acceleration makes objects ""fall"" outwards.

"How can the oblateness of Earth impart torque to change the longitude of ascending node of a satellite?","<p>I've read that you can change the longitude of ascending node of a satellite (i.e. changing the orbital plane without changing the inclination) to change its orbital plane by using the torque imparted by the oblateness of Earth.

<p>PS. I think I don't understand how torque induced precession works and that's why I am not able to understand this. So if any of you kind gentlefolk are willing to explain, I thank you in advance.</p>

<p>EDIT: I just came across <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nodal_precession"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Nodal Precession</a>.

I can visualize how the longitude of ascending node will change, but can't visualise how will the change in the torque caused by slightly offset gravitational force vector will cause it.</p>

  <p>A couple years ago, the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope was observing very distant galaxies, some of them billions of light years away.

  <p>This image is a couple years old now, and it shows what's called the parallel field for the Abell 370 galaxy cluster, about 4 billion light years away. It's called a parallel field because of the technique used to capture it.</p>

  <p>""While observing each cluster with one of the cameras on Hubble, the team also used a different camera, pointing in a slightly different direction, to photograph six so-called 'parallel fields.""

But if there's an infinite amount of matter, won't there always be more gas clouds that haven't formed stars, more stars that have yet to become black holes, etc.?

"Why is the cloud around Eta Carinae shaped the way it is?","<p>According to (german) wikipedia, Eta Carinae has a cloud shaped like two cones with the points at the poles of the star as well as a disk around the equator. These matter clouds are mostly or only condensed stellar wind from Eta Carinae.</p>

<p>In my understanding, to create the dual-cone chape, the stellar wind provding the matter originates at the poles and this gives the dual cone shape (Ok?).</p>

<p>Why the poles? Stellar wind would, I guess, be mostly stellar matter so hot it reaches escape velocity, further pushed by the radiation. This should be isotropic. I can only guess that maybe Eta Carina has a magnetic field shaped similarly to earth with a north and south pole, nearer the equator the stellar wind is perpendicular to the field lines so the flightpaths of the charged particles are bent back inward. Near the poles the flightpaths and field lines are mostly paralell, so the magnetic field does not really act on the stellar wind. I included this guesswork on my part so you know where to start.</p>

<p><strong>ETA:</strong> Turns out my guessing about stellar wind was wrong or mostly wrong, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eta_Carinae#Homunculus"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the cloud appears to be mostly shaped by eruptions</a> in recentish history.

"Is it possible to see Saturn from Titan's surface, day and night?","<p>Titan is the only moon in our solar system with a thick atmosphere, similar to what our Earth's atmosphere was before life ""appeared"". It also orbits Saturn close enough to actually see it beautifully in the sky... or can it?</p>

<p>Titan has a very thick and hazy atmosphere. Tholin seems to be the main factor of this ""haziness"". Also we can't see Titan's surface from space without infrared instruments. So in visible light, Titan looks like an almost uniform ball of beige, yellowish, golden brown because of its atmosphere, hiding the surface below.</p>

<p>So this should probably be the same case the other way around, right? Can we see Saturn from the surface of Titan, or does the haziness hide the parent planet from view during day time and night time (since I believe the atmosphere's opacity changes in day time and night time)?</p>

"Studies on planets without parent star","<p>I am interested in studies and/or publications about planets that wander in space and are not orbiting around a star or its remnants. These dark and frozen worlds should've got ripped away from their respective system by a large passing body (another star? passing black hole) or any other astronomical event (which one?).</p>

<p>I am curious, whether there exist statistical estimates on the number of such planets and the rate at which they are produced. I am also interested in reading about the statistical models that can produce those estimates and encode researchers' beliefs. If there are no such models, why?</p>

<p>A provoking thought: According to Greek, such planets are really fitting their name πλάνητες ἀστέρες (planētes asteres, ""wandering stars"") or simply πλανῆται (planētai, ""wanderers""). It is frightening to imagine such world that drifts deeper and deeper into empty space. Forever.</p>

But it was noted that there is still the possibility of star birth, coming from the collision of two stellar remnants, such as brown dwarfs (although white dwarfs also have the potential for such a collision). When two brown dwarfs collide, if they have <em>enough combined mass</em>, fusion can begin.</p>

<p>This is much different from how normal stars form today, and how they fuse hydrogen and other elements. So my question is this: </p>

"Is the point of this paper to say that Pluto's status as a planet should have been handled scientifically, rather than by a vote?","<p>The abstract of a paper currently in-press in Icarus: <a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019103518303063"" rel=""noreferrer"">The Reclassification of Asteroids from Planets to Non-Planets</a> (Metzger et al. 2018, <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1016/j.icarus.2018.08.026"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.icarus.2018.08.026</a>) says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is often claimed that asteroids‘ sharing of orbits is the reason they were re-classified from planets to non-planets. A critical review of the literature from the 19th Century to the present shows this is factually incorrect. The literature shows the term asteroid was broadly recognized as a subset of planet for 150 years. On-going discovery of asteroids resulted in a de facto stretching of the concept of planet to include the ever-smaller bodies. Scientists found utility in this taxonomic identification as it provided categories needed to argue for the leading hypothesis of planet formation, Laplace‘s nebular hypothesis. In the 1950s, developments in planet formation theory found it no longer useful to maintain taxonomic identification between asteroids and planets, Ceres being the primary exception. At approximately the same time, there was a flood of publications on the geophysical nature of asteroids showing them to be geophysically different than the large planets. This is when the terminology in asteroid publications calling them planets abruptly plunged from a high level of usage where it had hovered during the period 1801 – 1957 to a low level that held constant thereafter. This marks the point where the community effectively formed consensus that asteroids should be taxonomically distinct from planets. The evidence demonstrates this consensus formed on the basis of geophysical differences between asteroids and planets, not the sharing of orbits. <strong>We suggest attempts to build consensus around planetary taxonomy not rely on the non-scientific process of voting, but rather through precedent set in scientific literature and discourse</strong>, by which perspectives evolve with additional observations and information, just as they did in the case of asteroids. (emphasis added)</p>

<p>On the website there is also:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Highlights</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>The literature on asteroid classification is reviewed from 1801 to the present.</li>
  <li>Scientists considered asteroids to be planets until the 1950s.</li>
  <li>Thousands of asteroids sharing orbits was not debarring from planet status.</li>
  <li>They were reclassified as non-planets on the basis of geophysical characteristics.</li>
  <li><strong>Taxonomical terms like planet are determined by the scientific process, not voting</strong>. (emphasis added)</li>

<p>It sounds like they are saying that Pluto's status as a planet was removed by a vote, more than by scientific consensus, and that while the title suggests that the paper is about ""Asteroids"" it seems the scenario might actually be proxy for Pluto's demotion.</p>

"Does the mass of the Earth change?","<p>Every day, babies are born and people grow, which makes their respective masses greater. However, this change in mass (should) come out of the food that they consume - it is used as energy and thus converted into this growth. Likewise, building new structures is just a redistribution of mass already on Earth.</p>

<p>Thus, the only way I can see the actual mass of the Earth changing is by meteors that have landed here (increase in mass) and things that leave Earth such as space shuttles and rockets which would be  a decrease in mass.</p>

<p>But have I missed anything out? If no meteors crashed into Earth, and we had not yet figured out how to make machines that could fly, would the mass of the Earth remain constant? Or is it somehow loosing or gaining mass? Am I wrong in assuming that the growth of animals doesn't affect the mass?</p>

"Stellar core mass as a function of metallicity","<p>Using Hurley's <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0001295"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">2000</a> paper on Single Stellar Evolution, I have graphed the core mass of a star at three stages as a function of metallicity, Z, for a chosen ZAMS mass: at the beginning of the HG (MS), at the end of the Hertzprung-Gap (HG), and at the Base of the Asymptotic Giant Branch (BAGB). </p>

<p>All three functions have a cusp at Z = 0.0005 which I 1) do not understand physically and 2) wonder if it is incorrect? Is this expected?

<p>Core mass at beginning of HG:
$Mc_{MS}$ is the product of equation 29 and the core mass at the end of the HG described below ($\rho$ is always $&lt; 1$).</p>

<p>Core mass at end of HG:
$Mc_{HG}$ is, using equation 28 over the relevant mass range the HG ends at Helium Ignition, given by equation 44, where I solved for the time, $t$, in equation 35 and substituted that into equation 34 to find that $M_{c} = \Big(\frac{L}{D}\Big)^{1/5}$, and following the procedure given in the paragraph below equation 65 (where it references equation 44).

"Objects entering or leaving the observable universe","<p>Have there been any observations of objects entering or leaving the observable universe?</p>

<p>When looking at the physical limit of observing something like this I will to assume that the ""object"" would be an galaxy. I think it would be a good assumption to choose the size of such an galaxy, $G$, to be in the order of $10^{5}$ light years and the radius of the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observable_universe#Size"">observable universe</a>, $OU$, is $46 \times 10^{9}$ light years. Using the limit of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_resolution"">angular resolution</a> and the fact that the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extremely_large_telescope"">current biggest telescope</a> has a diameter of 22.8 meters, then the longest wave length which would still yield would be about $40 \mu m$. When reversing the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redshift"">redshift</a>, assuming this would be around $z=9$, then the longest emitted wave length which would be detected would be $4 \mu m$.</p>

<p>So observing such an event would technically be possible, however relative to the astronomical timescale we have only been able to observe with such a high resolution for a very short time, so the probability will not be very high.</p>

<p>And if such an event would be observed, would such an object suddenly appear/disappear. It will take along time for an entire galaxy due it size, so this would translate to more of a fade. Or will something else happen?</p>

<p>Original Text:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Extrapolating further, I've heard that the actual density of a black hole (within the volume of the event horizon) is pretty low, on the order of thin atmosphere - does that mean that any sufficiently large volume of mass over that density is also a black hole? Or does the actual concentration within the event horizon matter?</p>

"If any object could become a black hole, could any object become a neutron star?","<p>A black hole doesn't necessarily need to form from a star; theoretically, it could form from any extremely dense object. In fact, many astronomers differentiate certain black holes, like <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.com/wiki/Supermassive_black_hole"" rel=""nofollow"">supermassive ones</a>, from <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.com/wiki/Stellar_black_hole"" rel=""nofollow"">stellar ones</a> (ones that form from stars).</p>

<p>However, could the same apply for neutron stars? Neutron stars only form because of the intense gravity during a star's collapse: electron capture is forced to happen, and the majority of the star becomes neutrons. Could this potentially happen to non-stellar objects, if the gravity forces electron capture?</p>

<p>If so, why don't we see as many of these ""neutron objects"" as we do non-stellar black holes?</p>

"Low mass cut-off for the Dharma Planet Survey's detection of habitable planets around 40 Eridani A?","<p>News of the discovery of a <em>potentially</em> habitable planet around the star 40 Eridani A (about 16 light-years away) is interesting for reasons including a 1991 letter described below in Sky &amp; Telescope's recent article <a href=""https://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-news/super-earth-vulcan/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Super-Earth Discovered in (Fictional) Vulcan System</a>, part of which is shown below.</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> Is there any way to estimate a low mass cut-off for the Dharma survey for this particular star? Could there also be a 1 or 2 Earth mass planet there as well, within a habitable zone, as-yet undetected? Or does data there exclude this possibility?</p>

<p>The paper about the recent discovery: <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.07098"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.07098</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Almost three decades ago, Gene Roddenberry (producer of the Star Trek universe) wrote a letter to Sky &amp; Telescope, <strong>along with Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics astronomers Sallie Baliunas, Robert Donahue, and George Nassiopoulos</strong>. In their Letter to the Editor, they argued that 40 Eridani A — an orange-ish star 16 light-years away — would make the ideal home for Vulcan, the home planet of Science Officer Mr. Spock.</p>
  
  <p>Now, a new discovery puts a little more science into that science fiction assertion.</p>
  
  <p>A Long-ago Letter</p>
  
  <p>In the July 1991 issue, the three astronomers and one movie-maker made the case for what star should be considered Vulcan's home:</p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>The star around which Vulcan orbits was never identified in the original series or in any of the feature films based on it and so has never been officially established. But two candidates have been suggested in related literature.</p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>Two Star Trek books named the star 40 Eridani A as Vulcan's sun, while another publication named Epsilon Eridani instead. However, Roddenberry and the astronomers made an argument for 40 Eridani A:</p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>We prefer the identification of 40 Eridani as Vulcan's Sun because of what we have learned about both stars at Mount Wilson. . . . The HK [Project] observations suggest that 40 Eridani is 4 billion years old, about the same age as the Sun. In contrast Epsilon Eridani is barely 1 billion years old.</p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>Based on the history of life on Earth, life on any planet around Epsilon Eridani would not have had time to evolve beyond the level of bacteria. On the other hand, an intelligent civilization could have evolved over the aeons on a planet circling 40 Eridani. So the latter is the more likely Vulcan sun. . . . Presumably Vulcan orbits the primary star, an orange main-sequence dwarf of spectral type K1. . . . Two companion stars — a 9th magnitude white dwarf and an 11th magnitude red dwarf — orbit each other about 400 astronomical units from the primary. They would gleam brilliantly in the Vulcan sky.</p>

"Is time itself speeding up universally?","<p>Time moves more slowly near a mass than in relatively empty space.  For example, I get that an observer would see someone falling into a black hole to appear to move more slowly and get ""stuck"" on the event horizon, while the falling body would see the observer as aging more rapidly.</p>

<p>Additionally, an observer watching a passenger craft moving near the speed of light (high mass equivalent) might see a passenger who tripped falling in slow motion, because the forward momentum of the passenger + the speed of the craft must never exceed the speed of light, while the passenger would experience no effect of this time dilation, and would simply trip and fall.</p>

<p>Which brings me to my question...</p>

<p>Black holes, even supermassive black holes, are nowhere near the mass of the universe as a whole; so when the universe itself was much smaller and far more dense, then at a universal scale time itself would have progressed more ""slowly"" than it does today, and since the expansion of the universe is accelerating, doesn't it mean that time is also accelerating?</p>

<p>(Assuming, of course, there was some ""outside"" to observe this from).</p>

<p>This is not a duplicate of <a href=""https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/questions/12401/does-time-slow-down-because-the-universe-is-expanding-at-an-accelerating-rate"">Does time slow down because the universe is expanding at an accelerating rate?</a>.  That question and its answers seem more concerned with local, relativistic time (which is as malleable as space itself).  My question asks more about the effect across a universal scale as it relates to density of mass across that same universal scale.</p>

"Is a spotting scope or binoculars a better choice for astronomy?","<p>I'm interested in observing the moon and planets, and maybe some nebulae and star clusters.</p>

<ul>
<li>Nikon OceanPro 7x50 binoculars (around \$300)</li>
<li>Celestron 20x80 binoculars (around $100)</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm looking at a step up, to 100mm. Specifically, I'm trying to choose between  25x100 binoculars (either a <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B00008Y0VU"" rel=""nofollow"">Celestron</a> or an <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B00066ELB2"" rel=""nofollow"">Orion</a>) and a 100mm <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B0002862UW"" rel=""nofollow"">spotting scope</a>.</p>

<p>The only reason I'm considering a spotting scope is that it has a magnification of 22-66x, compared to the binoculars' 25x. But I want to check if such high magnifications really work for astronomy.</p>

<p>Let's say I'm observing the full moon. What's the highest usable magnification, without resulting in too dim an image?</p>

<p>An Amazon <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/review/R906C4U1258CK/ref=cm_cr_pr_perm?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=B0002862UW"" rel=""nofollow"">review</a> says that:</p>

  <p>I have found that while the readability improves from 22x to about 38x
  the resolution actually decreases after that and I never use it from
  40-66x, there is no point. Maybe it would have been better to have
  optimised it for 22-40x.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If the scope is limited to 40x in daytime use, I expect it to be worse at night, even observing the full moon.</p>

<p><strong>Part Two</strong></p>

<p>[deleted]</p>

<p><strong>Part Three</strong></p>

<p>So, <em>&alpha;</em> (right ascension), <em>&delta;</em> (declination) and <em>W</em> are Euler rotation angles. But what are the starting conditions before applying these rotations? Should the North Pole of the planet be aligned with the z-axis? Should the plane formed by the prime meridian be perpendicular to the y-axis?</p>

<p>Also, which axes do I rotate around, and in what order? I am guessing <em>&delta;</em> should be rotated first around the y-axis, then <em>&alpha;</em> around the z-axis. But <em>W</em> also looks like it should go around the z-axis. I am confused.</p>

<p><strong>Part Four</strong></p>

<p>I found another PDF document which on page 27 gives an equation for <em>&delta;</em>, <em>&alpha;</em> and <em>W</em>. (Not sure how to reproduce it here.)</p>

<p><a href=""https://depositonce.tu-berlin.de/bitstream/11303/6237/4/burmeister_steffi.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://depositonce.tu-berlin.de/bitstream/11303/6237/4/burmeister_steffi.pdf</a></p>

<p>I <em>think</em> that according to that PDF file I need to rotate around the z-axis by W, around the x-axis by (90-&delta;), and around the z-axis again by (90+&alpha;), in that order. Lastly, an additional rotation (around the x-axis?) by 23.43928 degrees must be done to get the body out of the ICRF frame and into the ecliptic frame.</p>

<p>But I still don't know the starting conditions. I.e. before applying the transformations, should the globe's North Pole point upward? Should the intersection of the Prime Meridian and Equator lie along the x-axis? Or, am I totally wrong, and should I perform the inverse matrix calculations instead? So far I have not gotten results that match what I see in Celestia for the same Julian Date.</p>

<p><strong>Part Five</strong></p>

<p>In some instances I am able to get ""close"" results using the above method. In others not. For instance, Mars, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune are ""close"" to correct. (At least, the poles - the blue arrows - are pointing in the same directions.) The Earth is not.</p>

"Infinite universe? How?","<p>So it seems the overall thought is that the universe is infinite. I don't get how.</p>

<p>Most depictions I read mention something to the effect of ""at 1^-20 seconds the universe was the size of <strong>_</strong>"". (Essentially mentioning a finite size at a very small length of time). So it came from a singularity, and had a finite size at some point. No matter how fast inflation went, any multiple of that finite size is NOT infinity though. If it was finite once, it is still finite.</p>

<p>If it's infinite then it was always infinite which means it was infinite density, infinitely large, etc. That's too crazy to swallow.</p>

<p>Isn't it more likely that the universe is really really big but not infinite? And we are at the center of the observable universe (to us), however we are off center in some grander universe that's maybe 1 trillion light years across? And nothing is past that because space and time are the same thing. Therefore if there is no light/matter/events, there is no time and hence no space.</p>

<p>I used their cmodel magnitude that they advise for galaxies' photometry. For example, I have the r magnitude of this galaxy that is 14.68, and I am trying to find its luminosity. They say that to convert to flux density, one must follow the following equation: </p>

<p>S = 3631 Jy * f/f0, where for the r band the AB conversion and shift is minimal.</p>

<p>However, when I plug the numbers into the equation: </p>

<p>The distance of the galaxy is 63.3 Mpc
But it seems that when I plug the numbers, the final value does not match, how is that? And yes, I converted to the units including the Jansky to 10^-26 W m^-2 Hz^-1 and the Mpc to m. </p>

<p>I wish to find the luminosity of the galaxy in terms of solar luminosity and I know that one solar luminosity unit is the same as 3.827e+26 W. </p>

"How can we map masses orbiting the outer Solar System by determining the orbits of planets and smaller objects?","<p>Neptune was discovered 170 years ago with the help of observations of Uranus' orbit. A great demonstration of the scientific principle for its time. Recently, Earth and cis-Lunar based radio interferometry together with the Cassini orbiter have measured Saturn's orbit, 10 AU from the Sun, with very great precision. This has already helped determine some characteristics of a possible planet Nein 200-700 AU from here.</p>

<p>What would be the best way to gravitationally measure the yet unobserved mass concentrations in the Kuiper Belt and beyond, by observing orbits of objects among the known planets?</p>

<p>It takes alot to move Saturn to a measurable degree. What about a space probe with the sole purpose of being easy to locate at high precision, maybe in a highly inclined orbit? Or a family of them in different directions. Would its deplacement from the very weak gravity well of a planet Nine be detectable? If it is the history of Saturn that contributes crucially to the precision, what about an asteroid like Ceres which is known since 200+ years? Is there any special property of Saturn that makes it especially useful? Would a second object as well measured as Saturn be extra helpful by some kind of triangulation of distant gravitational influences?</p>

<p>So my question is also based on the fact that larger stars also burn more energetically, I assume blowing away more of the the lighter elements from the surrounding cloud after formation and gathering more heavy elements,... do larger stars have a significantly different composition from smaller stars? --- or is the simple description of star formation misleading?</p>

"Fitting PSF to an image to get total flux (Python)","<p>I have an image of a single unsaturated source (asteroid) that I'd like to fit guesses for various model PSFs to, so that I can then compare the total flux in each case. I've only recently begun studying PSFs, so I am a bit confused. </p>

<p>I know that astropy offers a package called <code>photutils.psf</code> which does the PSF fitting for you, but I would like to better understand what's going on behind the fitting, and how the flux of the source is resolved from it. Furthermore, when I tried using this package, I wasn't getting any outputs anyway (it said a source was found, but that it didn't meet the sharpness or roundness criteria, despite me changing those parameters around quite a bit). I have tried something simpler below (where <code>model_data</code> is the 2d numpy array representation of the PSF, and <code>img</code> is the asteroid image data):</p>

<pre><code>import numpy as np
from astropy.modeling import fitting
from photutils import FittableImageModel

y, x = np.mgrid[:np.shape(img)[0], :np.shape(img)[1]]

fitter = fitting.LevMarLSQFitter()
model2d = FittableImageModel(model_data)
result = fitter(model2d, x, y, img)
print(result)
print(np.median(img), np.max(img), np.sum(img))
</code></pre>

<p>The output I get is then:</p>

<pre><code>flux       x_0       y_0

-----     -----     -----

9282.784  466.44    531.69
</code></pre>

<p><code>2705.82 25301.56 980812434.98</code></p>

<p>However, these are not the correct centroid coordinates of the source in the image. The correct coordinates are around (300, 300). Also, to get this result, the PSF data was normalized so that the max intensity point is 1. But when I change this normalization so that the total flux (sum of all the pixels) is 1, the result for the flux after fitting I get is way higher.</p>

<p>I'm not sure what's happening behind the scenes here (I got lost in the documentation), and I'm not sure if I can trust any of these flux values, considering the <code>x_0</code> and <code>y_0</code> are always off. So I'd like to better understand -- how exactly does one find the flux of an object by fitting it to a PSF? And how should that PSF be normalized?</p>

<p>This PAF has markings on the lens for aligning with Big Dipper or Cassiopeia, which looks like this:

<p>I have aligned the PAF to the mount during the day, and I am now attempting to use it at night. My understanding is that I need to rotate the mount in RA to match the image in the PAF to the actual stars in either Big Dipper or Cassiopeia. This will give me the correct position to then re-target at Polaris to find NCP.</p>

<p>I have been trying for 2 nights, and still no luck! The Big Dipper and Cassiopeia are in front of me - I can see them very clearly with the naked eye. Yet when I look through the PAF, I cannot see any star patterns resembling either of my targets. There are stars, but it's like the magnification is too high, maybe? No stars forms the pattern I am looking for, in any orientation. I cannot derive the connection between what I see with the naked eye right in front of me, and what I see through the PAF. I understand that the image in the PAF will be mirrored vertically and horizontally - still no luck. I can easily find my target through the Finder Scope on my main tube, but not through the PAF.</p>

<p>I have devised an experiment. I have positioned my tripod under a power line running high above me. I have aligned my view at Alkaid (western tip of the Big Dipper handle) with the wire, so I can see it in the PAF. Good news - I can see it in the PAF, and I can see Alkaid (it's the brightest in the area, so I am fairly sure that I can use it as a reference point between what I see with the naked eye and what I see through the PAF). </p>

"Why do galaxies have arms?","<p>A couple of years ago I started playing a game called Kerbal Space Program (KSP) and my understanding about how orbits actually work increased dramatically. Because of KSP I was looking at a picture of a galaxy with its spiral arms and something struck me as very odd. The stars closer in should orbit the galaxy center faster than the stars farther out and that would smear out these lanes of stars until they were no longer recognizable. Something weird is going on here!</p>

<p><strong>So why do galaxies have arms? What's bunching these stars together like that?</strong></p>

<p>I noticed that the center of galaxies are all smeared out and bulbous like I think that the rest should look like.

"What is the scale of things you can see with gravitational lensing?","<p>I'm trying to understand the examples of gravity lensing (using the general relativity property of large masses to bend light like a lens). </p>

<p>Most of the examples I see are of some galaxy (presumably a large mass) between us and a star (or are at least vague enough to not specify.</p>

<p>Yet my intuitive understanding of the sky is that all the stars we see are relatively close, all entirely within the Milky Way galaxy (and many of the stars in our galaxy provide a general glow), and that other galaxies are far enough away that it is difficult to image individual stars. The only single objects large enough comparable to a galaxy would be a quasar. Is that right?</p>

<p>So what then is going on usually with examples of gravity lensing? I find it hard to believe the captions that say a galaxy is enabling seeing more distant stars. I would think one could only apply that concept to a star or galaxy to see something much further away and as big or much bigger. Could one really use a galaxy as a lens to see a star? I wouldn't expect a star to be <em>behind</em> a galaxy from us.</p>

<p>Also, whatever the objects themselves, what is the scale? If the lensing is of a galaxy done by a star, I'd expect the star to galaxy distance ratio to be well below 1:1000 (~width of Milky Way to distance to Andromeda).

But I was wondering if they are so totally unstable that they can't temporarily ""capture"" a passing natural object (let's say an asteroid or a cloud of cosmic dust, in a stationary way or entering some kind of not-very-stable orbit around them)? Or could they?</p>

<p>And if they were able to, how much time would (approximately) be required for this/these object(s) to go ""off-orbit"" and abandon the L(1,2,3) area? In the case of the cloud of cosmic dust, would it just slowly (or quickly) drift away, or would they be ""launched"" towards another direction or orbit?</p>

"What type of energy is escaping from black-hole's poles?","<p>Following <a href=""http://www.space.com/26874-supermassive-black-hole-star-death.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this article</a>, it is stated that: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As a star drifts too close to a supermassive black hole, intense tidal
  stresses rip the star to shreds. As this happens, the shredded
  material will be dragged into the black hole’s accretion disk — a hot
  disk of gas that is gradually pulled into the black hole’s event
  horizon, bulking up the black hole’s mass or blasted as energetic
  jets from its poles.</p>

<p>Questions are, </p>

<ol>
<li>What is the energy type that escapes from the poles? </li>
<li>What is the magnitude of the power? </li>
<li>Can this energy be potentially harnessed? </li>
<li>How far into space do these energy jets blow?</li>
</ol>

<p>Also, if you feel like discussing this: if mass <strong>m</strong> goes into the black hole and comes out as energy <strong>E</strong> from the poles, assuming the speed of light <strong>c</strong> has no play in this transaction of going in or out, what happened to <span class=""math-container"">$c^2$</span> from <img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/lnMm7.png"" alt=""E=m*c^2"">? Could a black hole be hypothetically faster than light? Or maybe the reverse direction of light? (I even got confused from this thought...)</p>

<p>So, if those jets are not pure energy, but are energized matter, </p>

<ol>
<li>What type/kind of matter it would be? (gas? solid? liquid?)</li>
<li>Is all the matter that comes in, also goes out? I am thinking if the black hole works like a car's engine - does it have conversion efficiency? </li>
<li>Can this matter be cultivated, harnessed, or converted back to what it was or something new all together?</li>

"Validity of ephemeris time","<p>In the wikipedia article for epmeris time as first adopted in 1952, it does not explain clearly how or why it was supersed
ed. For example, it reads:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In 1976 the IAU resolved that the theoretical basis for its current
  (1952) standard of Ephemeris Time was non-relativistic, and that
  therefore, beginning in 1984, Ephemeris Time would be replaced by two
  relativistic timescales intended to constitute dynamical timescales:
  Terrestrial Dynamical Time (TDT) and Barycentric Dynamical Time
  (TDB).[28] Difficulties were recognized, which led to these being in
  turn superseded in the 1990s by time scales Terrestrial Time (TT),
  Geocentric Coordinate Time GCT(TCG) and Barycentric Coordinate Time
  BCT(TCB).[16]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, from this it appears that ephemeris time was never superceded and it continues to be evolved with a different theoretical basis?</p>

<p>From reading Robert Newton's books such as ""Ancient planetary observations and the validity of ephemeris time"", it would seem that ephemeris time is invalid because of non-secular accelerations in the motion of Mercury and Venus.</p>

<p>So, I guess my question is: does current astronomical theory consider ephemeris time to be invalid or valid, and if it considers it to be valid, then what is current evaluation of Newton's calculations and their implications for the validity of ephemeris time?</p>

"Multiple apparent lunar eclipses last night","<p>I saw something very strange last night that I'm hoping someone can help me explain.
I was sitting on my roof with a night-cap at about 3am last night. The moon, about the last quarter, was low in the sky in the east. Something truly strange happened. The moon started to disappear. There were clouds in the sky, but it wasn't this, I'm quite sure. The moon was being eclipsed. The dark part (at the top of the moon, as the moon was lying on its back - a sailor moon? That's what it looked like, like you could sit in it.) grew, the crescent closed, until it was just a spot of cream colored light and then winked out entirely.</p>

<p>I was a bit amazed - I'd stumbled onto my roof in the dead of the night and by complete chance witnessed a total lunar eclipse? I sat there in awe, staring. That's when the moon started to reappear, in the reverse procedure as its disappearance. Becoming a gleaming point of light, then a thin crescent, then the quarter moon which I suppose is what it is ""supposed to look like.""</p>

<p>AND THEN IT HAPPENED AGAIN. The moon was eclipsed and revealed again.</p>

<p>Both times the whole process took about 6-10 minutes. I'm not sure if this cycling continued, it was late and I had to sleep. I checked the NASA site for eclipses for my time and location, but no.</p>

"How could lithium burning take place in a quasi-star?","<p>According to <a href=""http://mnras.oxfordjournals.org/content/387/4/1649.full.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">Begelman et al. (2008)</a>, one of the most distinguishing features of the hypothetical quasi-star is that it's supported by radiation pressure from the accretion disk of the black hole in its core. The paper suggests that these stars form from Population III stars.</p>

<p>What's more, while almost all of the star's luminosity is from the accretion disk (which is far more luminous than thermonuclear reactions), temperatures around the central black hole are hot enough for fusion:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Although we do not model the non-hydrostatic region of quasi-stars in any detail, in our case high temperatures <em>are</em> attained in the immediate vicinity of the black hole. However, even in this region the neglect of nuclear reactions is justified, first because black hole accretion is energetically much more efficient than fusion, and secondly because on-going accretion limits the time-scale over which inflowing gas is exposed to high $T$.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That's all fine, but what surprised me is the footnote on the third page:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the most massive quasi-stars, the central temperature may be high enough (a few million K) to initiate lithium burning. This is energetically negligible, and although the presence or absence of lithium does affect the opacity, the effect is small for the photospheric temperatures and densities of interest here.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even though this part dismisses lithium burning as an important factor, since it's energy output doesn't compare to that of the accretion disk's, it still mentions that lithium burning can take place. Considering that these form from Population III stars, how is it that much lithium burning can happen in the first place?</p>

<p>Although lithium is a relatively light atom, it is considered a metal and lithium burning depletes the amount of lithium in a star. Since Population III stars are supposed to be nearly metal-free, shouldn't only hydrogen or helium fusion be a factor here, even if they only have a small effect?</p>

"Is a Gas Giant a Perpetual Motion Machine?","<p>I know there's no such thing like a perpetual motion machine but I missing something in my reasoning.</p>

<p>Assume there's a gas giant planet where the immense pressure of the core causes it to heat and create a convection current of its gases.
If there's no atmosphere gases losses to space that means we have a perpetual motion machine?</p>

<p>Is work being done to move all that gas (or not?). The energy to compress gases is coming from gravity but the total energy of the system remains the same?</p>

<p>Now assume some heat is being dissipated in space, that means the system is losing energy.</p>

<p>Can this possible go forever or will the planet reach a equilibrium where all gases and heat will be distributed in a way the convection cease?
Or even can possible it loss energy enough to loss mass (and cease the heavy gravity effects)?</p>

<p>Bonus:
Consider we got two kinds of life forms: one breathing XY and exhaling X+Y and another doing the inverse and using the heat from some (goldilock zone) atmosphere layer (some kind of XY + Energy => X + Y, X + Y + Energy => XY cycle). Will life perse consume the energy and cooldown the planet (eventually in billions years)?</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>

<p>There's a bit of confusing about this question due to my difficult in express my doubts. Sure it's impossible to achieve total ""isolation"". I'm just pondering about an hypothetical scenario.
I see now the forever convection is just equivalent to a frictionless object spinning foerever in the void.</p>

<p>Any energy removed from the system will ""slow down"" it.</p>

"Why do certain massive stars leave no remnants?","<p>Mass and metallicity are the two main determinants for a star's fate. This is simple enough.

<p>Then I stopped and thought. For large gas giants, such as Jupiter, having moons too close to the planet can be fatal (for the moon). If it ventures inside the planet's Roche limit, it's toast. But there is good news: the Roche limit depends on both the masses and densities of the primary body and the satellite. So perhaps this reason is non-applicable, as a high-mass natural satellite might be able to survive. So the question changes:</p>

<p><strong>Could a sufficiently high-mass, high-density natural satellite occupy geostationary orbit over its primary body?</strong></p>

"Why does Kepler's ""Big Picture"" of comet 67P look so strange? And what is the significance?","<p>The observation of comet 67P by the Kepler space telescope has been reported in various science news outlets recently. For example, the image below appeared in the recent NASA news article <a href=""http://www.nasa.gov/image-feature/ames/kepler/nasas-kepler-gets-the-big-picture-of-comet-67p"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">NASA's Kepler Gets the 'Big Picture' of Comet 67P</a> and the same or similar images can be seen elsewhere. The article says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>From Sept. 7 through Sept. 20, the Kepler spacecraft, operating in its K2 mission, fixed its gaze on comet 67P. From the distant vantage point of Kepler, the spacecraft could observe the comet's core and tail. The long-range global view of Kepler complements the close-in view of the Rosetta spacecraft, providing context for the high-resolution investigation Rosetta performed as it descended closer and closer to the comet.</p>
  
  <p>During the two-week period of study, Kepler took a picture of the comet every 30 minutes. The animation shows a period of 29.5 hours of observation from Sept. 17 through Sept. 18. The comet is seen passing through Kepler's field of view from top right to bottom left, as outlined by the diagonal strip. The white dots represent stars and other regions in space studied during K2's tenth observing campaign.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don't really understand this image. It is a GIF assembled from several exposures, but in each frame, individual stars appear as tight clusters of dots for some reason, and the comet moves within a bright, narrow band that crosses the entire image in all frames. Why does this looks so strange?</p>

<p>Also, what is the importance of Kepler deviating from it's observations to concentrate on 67P during this period? What is the scientific importance of this series of observations?</p>

<p>For example, could one and the same big space radio telescope <em>in the Asteroid Belt</em> be used for any, some or all of the below, what would the synergies and contradictions be:</p>

<p><strong>a)</strong> Radio astronomy on its own.</p>

<p><strong>b)</strong> Interferometry together with a telescope on Earth to create an interplanetary baseline for huge resolution, like the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spektr-R"">spektr-R</a> does cis-lunar today, AFAIK.</p>

<p><strong>c)</strong> Radar characterization of the orbit, shape, size et cetera of any large enough asteroid in its current section of the asteroid belt.</p>

<p><strong>d)</strong> Ground penetrating radar to characterize the interior composition of near flyby asteroids.</p>

<p><strong>e)</strong> Communication with Earth so powerful that it need not engage the Deep Space Network (DSN), but can work with smaller Earth based radio antenna.</p>

<li>If the jovian planets form outside of this line; why have so many been found within this line in other star systems from our own? Is this only selection bias or is it more likely that our models are incorrect at this point?</li>
<li>How does the creation of the gas giants differ from the creation of the ice giants? Is it simply like a second ""frost line"" where there wasn't enough gaseous material to form a large jovian planet but plenty of ices to form ice giants? If so, how is the creation of the ice giants different to Dwarf planets?</li>

"Cosmology : Formula for the bias of galaxies","<p>first I have posted originally on the physics stackexchange but I have not had answers about my question, so I try my luck on this specific forum (if forums leaders want to delete the original post on physics exchange, they can do it without problems, I don't want to make duplicates).</p>

<p>From this article : <a href=""https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.09787.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.09787.pdf</a> , I try to deduce the equation that my teacher told me which links 2 quantities :</p>

<p>1) the global number density of galaxies</p>

<p>2) the local number density of galaxies</p>

<p>3) the contrast of Dark matter density</p>

<p>The relation that I would like to find (the relation given by my teacher) is very simple :</p>

<p><span class=""math-container"">$$N_{1} = n_{1} b_{1}\,\delta_{\text{DM}}\quad\quad(1)$$</span></p>

<p>where <span class=""math-container"">$$N_{1}$$</span> is the local number density of galaxies in Universe, <span class=""math-container"">$$n_{1}$$</span> is the global number density, <span class=""math-container"">$$b_{1}$$</span> is the bias (cosmological bias of galaxies) and <span class=""math-container"">$$\delta_{\text{DM}}$$</span> the contrast in dark matter density. When I say ""local"", I mean in the volume of scale that I consider (in a cluster of galaxies for example, doesn't it ?)</p>

<p>for the moment, I can't find this equation.</p>

<p>Into the article above, they define the bias by doing the relation <span class=""math-container"">$(1.1)$</span> (equation reference on the article) :</p>

<p><span class=""math-container"">$$\delta_{g}(\vec{x}) = \dfrac{n_{g(\vec{x})}}{\overline{n_{g}}}-1 = b_{1}\,\delta_{\text{DM}}(\vec{x}) = b_{1}\big(\dfrac{\rho_{m}(\vec{x})}{\overline{\rho_{m}}}-1\big)\quad\quad(2)$$</span></p>

<p>with <span class=""math-container"">$b_{1}$</span> the bias.</p>

<p>As you can see, in this article, authors are reasoning with the contrast of density number of galaxies (<span class=""math-container"">$\delta_{g}(\vec{x}))$</span> and the contrast of matter density of Dark matter (<span class=""math-container"">$\delta_{\text{DM}}(\vec{x})$</span>).</p>

<p>I tried to modify this equation <span class=""math-container"">$(2)$</span> to get <span class=""math-container"">$(1)$</span> but I am stuck by the following difference : on one side, one takes number densities and on the other one, they take contrasts of density (with contrast density number and Dark matter contrast).</p>

<p>Multiplying the both by the volume <span class=""math-container"">$V$</span> is not enough since there is the value ""-1"" in the definition of contrast : I don't know if I have to write :</p>

<p><span class=""math-container"">$$\text{Global Number of galaxies} = \overline{n_{g}}\quad V$$</span></p>

<p>or </p>

<p><span class=""math-container"">$$\text{Local Number of galaxies} = \overline{n_{g}}\quad V$$</span></p>

<p>???</p>

<p>I think that I have to use the following relations : <span class=""math-container"">$N_{g}\equiv N_{1}$</span> and <span class=""math-container"">$\overline{n_{g}}=n_{1}$</span> in the relation of my teacher but I am not sure.</p>

<p>Anyone could help me to find the equation (1) from the equation (2) of article cited ?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 1:</strong></p>

<p>If I take the relation eq<span class=""math-container"">$(2)$</span>, I can write :</p>

<p><span class=""math-container"">$$n_{g(\vec{x})} = \overline{n_{g}}\,b_{1}\,\delta_{\text{DM}}+\overline{n_{g}}\quad\quad(3)$$</span></p>

<p>As you can see, <span class=""math-container"">$(3)$</span> is not equal to the equation <span class=""math-container"">$(1)$</span> that I would like to get (since a second term <span class=""math-container"">$\overline{n_{g}}$</span>)</p>

<p>With the notations of the equation<span class=""math-container"">$(1)$</span>, in order to be coherent, I think that I have to assimilate <span class=""math-container"">$N_{1}$</span> to <span class=""math-container"">$n_{g}(\vec{x})$</span> (local density) and <span class=""math-container"">$n_{1}$</span> to <span class=""math-container"">$\overline{n_{g}}$</span> (global or mean density).</p>

<p>How can I circumvent this issue about the presence of this second term into eq<span class=""math-container"">$(3)$</span> compared to eq<span class=""math-container"">$(1)$</span> ?</p>

<p>I am near from the equality between both, this is frustrating . Maybe it is a problem of convention about the factor <span class=""math-container"">$b_{1}$</span> called ""bias"" ?</p>

<p>I thought it could be because when ionization, the heat is used to ionize atoms instead of increasing the temperature and, therefore, the heat capacity would be larger in those regions. But, because the <span class=""math-container"">$\gamma$</span> is the ratio between the heat capacities, the argument does not work.</p>

"Question about Telescopes , observations and explanations of the observations","<p>Though I am active on Physics, I am new to Astronomy. I am an amateur astronomer, actually even worse than amateur. I have just started it.
I have a 60 mm objective 700mm focal length refractor which I mainly use with a 20 mm eyepiece.</p>

<p>I have a couple of questions regarding the telescope, observations and explanations behind observations. Since they are all interlinked I decided to ask them together.</p>

<p>1) So, firstly the basics. Regarding the resolution power of a telescope, we know from the Rayleigh criterion that diffraction does happen at the objective. But Diffraction happens when light passes through a narrow slit or bends around a corner (whose dimensions are of the order of the wavelength of light). But there is no slit and probably no bending of light. <strong><em>How come then do we assume a diffraction pattern to have formed when considering the derivation of the resolution of a telescope?</em></strong></p>

<p>2) <strong>How are exit pupil and entry pupil different from the diameter of the eyepiece and objective?</strong></p>

<p>3) <em>Why on increasing the magnification does the brightness of the object reduce</em> (the physics behind it)? <strong>I mean that if I use 4mm eyepiece then, first of all, it becomes very difficult to find the object and secondly its brightness gets reduced when compared to the brightness that I had got using a 20mm eyepiece?</strong></p>

<p>4) <em>Secondly why do the Barlow lenses reduce the brightness a lot.</em> And why on using  Barlow lenses the field of view get smaller and the object passes twice as quickly as without the Barlow?</p>

<p>5) Now the biggest question. <em>How is it possible that every time I point my telescope towards a visible planet or a star (I know it's a star because of the sky map), I see almost the same size, when stars are visible only as small dots.</em> <strong>The stars appear to be bluish and the planets which I have seen (Mars and Jupiter) appear reddish. That's ok but a star can not be visible as a sphere. Stars appear as dots, don't they?</strong></p>

<p>6)How can I make the telescope give the best results i.e which eyepiece should I use and whether I should use Barlow lenses or not?</p>

"What is the illuminance of Tau Ceti?","<p>As part of my physics project, I investigated the relationship between a light bulb's illuminance and the distance from the measuring device to it.</p>

<p>Illuminance was measured in flux, and distance in metres.</p>

<p>I derived an inverse relationship. First of all, can I check if this is the relationship I was supposed to get? (I understand that there is an inverse square relationship between luminosity and distance, but since illuminance is measured in lumens/sq metre, then I think an inverse relationship is correct...)</p>

<p>Next, using this relationship, I need to extend my project so that I can find distances to stars using this relationship.</p>

<p>As long as 2 stars have a similar mass/size/density, then I can use this relationship to find the distance to the 2nd star as long as the illuminance of the stars are known, and the distance to the 1st star is known.</p>

<p>So I tried to do this with an example - the Sun and Tau Ceti, as they are reasonably similar.</p>

<p>I have values for the Sun's distance/illuminance - $1.5\!\times\!10^8 $km, $1.2\!\times\!10^5$lux.
I now am trying to calculate the distance to Tau Ceti using this method.... But nowhere can I find a value for its illuminance.</p>

<p>Please can someone help me with this? Is there a way to convert from apparent magnitude or luminosity to illuminance?</p>

<p>Thank you</p>

<p>EDIT: The method I want to use from the inverse relationship is:</p>

<p>$$d_2=d_1l_1/l_2$$</p>

<p>where $d_1$ and $l_1$ are the known distance and illuminance of the 1st star, whilst $d_2$ and $l_2$ is that of the second, and $d_2$ is unknown.</p>

<p>Since orbital velocity is greater on small orbits, and smaller on large orbits, why don't planets spin retrograde around their own axis? </p>

<p>One portion of planet's mass is closer to its star, and should move prograde relative to center of mass. </p>

<p>Part of the planet's mass far from the star orbits higher and should move retrograde relative to center of mass, </p>

<p>which should create a resulting retrograde spin, with rotation speed depending on planet's diameter.</p>

This is about to be a bad example, but please bear with me.  </p>

<p>If you were a bird floating in the ocean, among a myriad of other birds, and you let time pass such that every bird floated away from the other birds in some random fashion. Would you, at some later time when everybirdy was roughly separated from one another, say that based upon your observations of the present conditions, and some evidence that at one point all of the birds were together, that the ocean is centerless? Or could you assume that because of your position in the flock, that from your perspective you can't tell where the center is, nor do you think that from a different birds position would you be able to tell? Creating the illusion of a centerless ocean.</p>

<p>Obviously this requires you not be at or close to the very edge of the flock.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Evidence that there is a constant rain of small comets, each a loose snowball held together by a carbon shell, first came in the 1980s from satellites that looked down on Earth and observed “atmospheric holes”- dark spots 50 to 100 kilometres across- that were appearing in the dayglow of the atmosphere. The dayglow is ultraviolet light emitted when sunlight interacts with the oxygen in the upper atmosphere. Water is the only common substance that could create such holes, and each could be made by a small comet containing between 20 and 40 tonnes of water that broke up into a cloud of vapour as it hit the atmosphere. The case for a cometary origin for the atmospheric holes grew in the 1990s when the trail of a cosmic snowball was picked up as it vaporised over the Atlantic by the visible imaging cameras on polar satellites.</p>
  
  <p>From the number of atmospheric holes, <strong>it’s possible to calculate that the atmosphere is being hit by a 20 to 40-tonne snowball comet every 3 seconds</strong>. According to Frank, this is enough to add an inch of water to the Earth’s surface every 20,000 years. Over the 4.5-billion-year lifetime of the Earth they could have provided all the water in the oceans. (emphasis added)</p>

"How could a 20 inch space telescope ""be able to make out Earth-size planets"" orbiting alpha Centari?","<p>The NY Times article <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/11/science/telescope-earthlike-planet-alpha-centauri-boldlygo-nasa.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Telescope to Seek Earthlike Planet in Alpha Centauri System</a> describes a proposed effort to put a telescope into orbit fairly quickly with a narrowly defined purpose - to look for planets in the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_Centauri"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">alpha Centari</a> system, which is about 4.37 lightyears away from Earth.</p>

<p>The funding, design, assembly and space deployment fairly quickly is made possible in part by the narrowly defined purpose and the compelling public interest in this particular question. </p>

<p>I got out my box of envelope-backs and did the following. Since there is no air, <s>there's no need for adaptive optics so </s> the standard diffraction limit applies. For an <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airy_disk"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Airy disk</a>:</p>

<p>$$ \theta \approx 1.22 \frac{\lambda}{d} $$</p>

<p>The article describes the telescope as washing machine-sized, with an aperture of 20 inches, or about 50 cm.  If I choose a visible wavelength of 500nm, I get a resolution of about 1.22 microradians ($\mu$R). 4.37 lightyears is about 4.13E+13 km or 2.76E+05 AU. </p>

<p>That makes the airy disk about 0.34 AU at alpha Centari. The actual point spread function of a telescope depends not only on the theoretical diffraction of the aperture, but diffraction from secondaries and supports within the aperture, on aberrations due to imperfectly shaped optical surfaces and scatter and haze due to nano-roughness of mirror surfaces. (see below)</p>

<p>Could a 20 inch telescope and associated experiment package be put together quickly that could actually resolve (or ""make out"" as the article says) an Earth-like planet in the alpha Centari system from space? If so, what is it exactly that it could do that can't be done from any existing telescope in orbit or on Earth?</p>

<p>It jumps out that the secondary is mounted off-axis, which can have mechanical and optical advantages (e.g. diffraction) but would probably limit the image quality to a narrow field of view, which might be OK for a single-target telescope if there are suitable calibration targets nearby.</p>

"Eventual outcome of tidal acceleration and deceleration","<p>So, I know the Moon experiences tidal acceleration from the Earth. And, from what I've read, if not for the fact that the sun would boil away the oceans and engulf both of them first, about 50 billion years from now the Moon would be geosynchronous.</p>

<p>I was curious whether tidal acceleration could ever cause a satellite to escape, and short answer seems to be, yes, it's possible. Is that accurate? And if so, which factors add to it?</p>

<ol>
<li>A faster rotating planet also results in tides farther ahead, and has more energy to lose before being totally locked. Very closely related, a farther satellite orbits more slowly, resulting in tides farther ahead, and requires less energy to escape. This one seems obvious: the faster the planet is still rotating while the satellite is farther away, the more likely it escapes.</li>
<li>A more fluid planet would experience stronger tides, which would again slow it down faster, but definitely accelerate the satellite faster. A more viscous fluid than water would experience weaker tides, but I think they'd be farther ahead. I think more fluid is definitely more effective, but it seems less obvious than the first point.</li>
<li>A larger planet would have its orbit slowed less by tidal acceleration, but have a stronger pull to escape. A larger satellite would cause stronger tides and more tidal force, but would require more force to accelerate, and would slow the planet down more quickly. I really can't tell which has the stronger effect...</li>
</ol>

<p>So that's question 1: 
Is it really possible for tidal acceleration to throw a satellite into space before the planet is tidally locked, and if so, does either objects' size impact it, or just fluidity and relative periods?</p>

<p>Then, I wondered about tidal deceleration, and crashing into the planet. It seems obvious that any satellite orbiting retrograde would never stop decelerating, so all would eventually get torn apart and crash onto their planet. For non-retrogade satellites, an article I read implied that all of them will have the same fate... Which implies that the planet's rotation will always speed up more slowly than the satellite's falling orbit. Is that true? If not, then it seems there must be cases where the planet's rotation catches up, and they again end up tidally locked.</p>

<p>So that's question 2:
Will all non-retrogade tidally decelerating satellites eventually crash into their planet, or is it possible for the planet to catch up given the right starting conditions?</p>

<p>Edit: Haven't really found any more information on this. Is there someone familiar with relevant equations, who knows the answer?</p>

"Which measurements have shown that 2014 MU69 is red? (New Horizons' next target)","<p>The recent NASA feature article <a href=""http://www.nasa.gov/feature/new-horizons-possible-clouds-on-pluto-next-target-is-reddish"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">New Horizons: Possible Clouds on Pluto, Next Target is Reddish</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>MU69 is actually the smallest KBO to have its color measured – and scientists have used that data to confirm the object is part of the so-called cold classical region of the Kuiper Belt, which is believed to contain some of the oldest, most prehistoric material in the solar system.</p>
  
  <p>“The reddish color tells us the type of Kuiper Belt object 2014 MU69 is,” said Amanda Zangari, a New Horizons post-doctoral researcher from Southwest Research Institute. “The data confirms that on New Year’s Day 2019, New Horizons will be looking at one of the ancient building blocks of the planets.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href=""http://gizmodo.com/new-horizons-spacecraft-is-approaching-a-mysterious-red-1787938286"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Gizmodo</a> elaborates on the significance of the red color:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Speaking today at the the American Astronomical Society Division for Planetary Sciences (DPS), mission scientists talked about the Pluto flyby, but they also looked ahead to the Kuiper Belt encounter. Recent observations made by the Hubble Space Telescope suggests MU69 is red—if not redder—than Pluto. MU69 is now the smallest KBO to have its color measured, and it’s our first sense of what this mysterious object actually looks like.</p>
  
  <p>The reddish color of MU69, like the iconic red splotches on Pluto and its moon Charon, suggest the presence of tholin, a class of molecules that’s formed through the ultraviolet irradiation of simple organic compounds such as methane and ethane. Tholin doesn’t form naturally on Earth, but it’s abundant on the surface of icy bodies in the outer solar system. Using Hubble, scientists have confirmed that MU69 is part of the “cold classical” region of the Kuiper belt, which contains some of the oldest objects in the Solar System.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How was the ""redness"" of 2014 MU69 detected? The second link mentions that it is Hubble data - is it just photometric (images through different filters) or is there also spectroscopy?</p>

<p>I'm curious, just how red is it? What exactly are the numerical data that are being interpreted as ""redness""? Is this exclusively the assumed visual appearance, or is there excess infrared as well? </p>

"Can we measure comets in a similar way to exoplanets?","<p>A 2km comet at 40AU's can dim a sun sized star at 100 light years by 3%, and a 10km comet can cause an eclipse (is that right?) So would 2,3,10 km objects be easy to measure via star dimming if we had enough telescopic data from space? </p>

<p>Can we measure lines of stars that are eclipsed/dimmed in sequence by transiting comets? </p>

<p>Given 1000 frames of a small patch of space, where all the images are recorded into a 3D image stack (a 3D array, a voxel) X,Y and Time as dimensions, then an Intel processor can compare 20 million voxels per second of that collection of images to search for vector information of aligned patterns of star dimming, i.e. searching for vectors of comets.</p>

<p>If that process is repeated for many patches of space, perhaps we can detect many comets, and I don't know the real maths involved, if a satellite of that design would realistically only find 1 comet, or 5000?</p>

<p>It's for a theoretical comet apprehension system which uses 2/3 identical satellites  each comprised 100Tb of SSD and a 20Mflops processors to search for vector information in the images.</p>

<p>Some kind of fairy idea going around in my head, because of Oumuamua and because I work on voxels and I know that image collections from space can be stacked into 3D arrays and be searched for vector patterns at 2million voxels per second on a 200W PC, an idea that I am confusedly astrally-projecting as a basis to find comets.</p>

<p>edit- A quantitative answer would be cool, say if the voids between stars on the milky way arm are 8 times the width of the comet, the comet would on average hit 2 stars every 8x8 frames.</p>

"Will the Earth ever be tidally locked to the Moon?","<p>From my basic understating, </p>

<p>Momentum is being transfered from the Earth's rotation to the Moon's orbit by tidal friction. The Earth's rotation slows down and the Moon receedes from the Earth as it moves into a higher orbit. This will continue until the Earth's rotational period is equal to the orbital period of the Moon, i.e the Earth is tidally locked to the Moon.</p>

<p>Assuming I have the above correct - and please correct me if I don't - will there, realistically, be enough time for tidal locking to  occur before the sun expands and engulfs the Earth? Or is there another reason the Earth will never be locked towards the Moon?</p>

"Understanding gravity","<p>Forgive me if my question has an obvious answer, but I need to know the answer.

<p>Upon looking into Newton's law of universal gravitation, I began to wonder whether I misunderstood this. Does the gravity between the Sun and Earth have an equal force on both? As in, does the Earth pull the Sun with as much force as the Sun does on Earth? If so, would the Sun just resist accelerating to Earth because it is extremely massive?

  <p>Kepler-90i wasn't the only jewel this neural network sifted out. In the Kepler-80 system, they found a sixth planet. This one, the Earth-size Kepler-80g, and four of its neighboring planets form what is called a ""resonant chain,"" where the planets are locked by their mutual gravity in a rhythmic orbital dance. The result is an extremely stable system, similar to the seven planets in the TRAPPIST-1 system, so precisely balanced that the length of Kepler-80g's year could be predicted with mathematics.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My question is about these ""resonant-chains"" of planets. If I understand correctly this would be a group of planets where due to mutual perturbative effects they are in orbits who's periods are in mutual rational number ratios, e.g. 3:2 or 7:9.</p>

<p>Is it known yet how long-lived (time domain) or narrow (frequency) domain these resonances are, or are likely to be? In other words, are they thought to be really ""locked"" into these fixed ratios for say tens or even hundreds of millions of orbits, or are the orbits just really close, but with occasional, irregular ""slippage"" events?</p>

<p>Since the span of data and its precision is limited, I would expect that one can not conclude from the data alone, and it's likely some modeling has been done on resonant-chains of planets to improve the understanding of the phenomenon, so I'm asking to understand what's known and believed, rather than a precise answer about a given system. Since the problem is mostly orbital mechanics it lends itself more easily to simulation than most problems.</p>

<p>As background, Wikipedia addresses ""locked"" orbital resonances:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Under some circumstances, a resonant system <strong>can be stable and self-correcting</strong>, so that the bodies remain in resonance. Examples are the 1:2:4 resonance of Jupiter's moons Ganymede, Europa and Io, and the 2:3 resonance between Pluto and Neptune. (emphasis added)</p>

If we know the PSF of a system, and use this to deconvolve the raw image (purpose 1 from the quote above), why would we <em>convolve</em> a model with the PSF to compare it to an image (purpose 2 from the quote)? That is, can't we just compare the original, unconvolved model, with the <strong>de</strong>convolved image? In terms of maximizing the information that seems like the way to go.</p>

"Does gravity bend light, and how much time does it take for light to cross gravity of a Black Hole?","<p>This is very confusing to me, so the question might be same. Please go through it, if required i will add more text.</p>

<p>According to Einstein's theory of general relativity, photons are not technically affected by large gravitational fields; instead space and time become distorted around massive objects and the light simply follows this distorted curvature of space.</p>

<p>My questions are:
1) For example: 1 hour near a black hole, is equivalent to 100 Years on Earth. If the light travels through this distorted space and time around a black hole, how much earth time does it take for light to cross the black hole's gravity?</p>

<p>2) We say the Universe is 14 Billion Years old, and its diameter is 91 Billion Light Years approximatly. My assumption is, these age and diameter of universe is based on the measurement of the light travel (Light is one of the factor in many).</p>

<p>3) So, if first (1) and second (2) points are right, how can we say the Universe is created 14 Billion Years ago (if light takes 100 Earth Years to cross over the black hole's gravity)?</p>

"How often do comet occultations of stars happen?","<p>By travelling to specific places, <a href=""http://www.asteroidoccultation.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">astronomers can see three thousand star comet transition events every year</a> at m15 for the major (50km+) comets and asteroids averaging about 20 seconds, perhaps that's 25k transitions if they listed 2 seconds occultations by the same 50km comets, perhaps that's not an exhaustive survey, it may be 5/10/20k?</p>

<p>Some easy and fun maths:</p>

<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroid#/media/File:Asteroids_by_size_and_number.svg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">There are about 500 >50km comets, and 100k >5km</a> which would transition visibly at 40AU's, so that's 600,000 total eclipses of 

<p>There are 1000,000 >1km comets that cause eclipses of average m20 stars, and there are 100 times more m20 stars than the m15 ones, that's 60mn star dimming events at m20.</p>

<p>Conversely, We can perhaps divide that number by 100 (difficult figure to know) for a static view, but you would have to run very fast with your telescope to see 60 million star dimming positions every year, Can we keep the figure at 60mn or is it logical to change that to 0.6?</p>

<p>I must have misjudged it by 1-2 orders of magnitude, multiple times less for velocity or something. Can we surmise if it is 60k or 60million at m15 and m20? </p>

<p>If a comet of 11km at 40AU's travels through the disk of the galaxy, it can hide stars for at least 0.5 seconds. If the stars are N times distanced than the comet's diameter from a perspective, the comet would hide two stars every NxN frames, so for N = 5, a different star would dim every 25 frames. What is the real maths to say what the figure N is at the disk of the galaxy for something like Halley's Comet at m15 and m20? </p>

"Does spacetime return to being flat?","<p>I wrote an experiment in HTML5 and Javascript to try to show what is happening to the curvature of spacetime as a body moves through a region.</p>

<p>As time progresses, I'm using the <code>g=Gm/r2</code> equation to move the spacetime grid toward the object. When a grid point is within the body, I use <code>g(1-h/R)</code> to modify the bending according to the acceleration at the surface. This assumes uniform density.</p>

<p>The result is that it takes a very large mass and very long time for any sort of noticeable curvature to occur (as you'd expect). By decreasing the Earth's radius by a factor of 3, I was able to see the curvature very well as in the screenshot below.</p>

<p>What occurred to me then is that the the warping of space would remain long after the body of mass had moved on.</p>

<p>Does this warping in space ever return to truly ""flat"" or is the fact that we almost never orbit through the same absolute region of space mean we never experience this existing warping?</p>

<p>If light went through this ""wake"" would it bend according to the spacetime curvature created by the long distant planet? Or have I gone wrong in my model?</p>

leads to the following, in the U band:
$$\implies m_U = -2.5\cdot log_{10}\left(F_U\right) + C_U$$</p>

<p>and the relationship involving taking the sum of the fraction of the flux that a star outputs at each wavelength rather than the ratio between the fluxes of two stars, here in the UV band for example: </p>

<p>$$ m_U = -2.5\cdot log_{10} \left(\displaystyle\int_0^\infty F_{\lambda}S_U \,\, d\lambda\right) + C_U$$</p>

<p>*$S(\lambda)$ = the fraction of the star's flux detected at wavelength lambda.</p>

<p>Succinctly, what is the difference between the above two equations? </p>

<p>More specifically, how would this be used in a real-world situation to find the apparent magnitude of an object? My deduction is that apparent magnitude isn't as simple as taking the flux in a certain filter to find the apparent magnitude, and that each individual wavelength must be accounted for. However, with that notion, why can't we just remove the sensitivity function and change the bounds to those wavelengths within the U band? </p>

<p>The other option would be that this is just more accurate than taking the flux within the U band (referring to the above example), because you would take smaller intervals, possibly over 1 $\buildrel _\circ \over {\mathrm{A}}$ intervals since infinitesimal ones would be impossible.</p>

<p>Here are the key ideas I've gleamed from my reading that I'm using to build this. I consider most of them tentatively held, and am very open to input:</p>

<ul>
<li>Earth-like atmospheres would tend to be light to dark blue at the zenith, due to the scattering of low-wavelength blue light. If the planet's sun was very hot, the sky would look a deeper blue, while cooler stars would give the sky a lighter blue to almost white look. When the sun gets to 3000k and below, the sky starts to take on an orange/brown tinge.</li>
<li>Like on earth, the horizon is the lightest in color and the zenith the deepest.</li>
<li>Denser atmospheres would appear brighter (more washed out) and the primary color in the spectrum more ""pure"" (I'm unsure what the term ""pure"" means exactly when it comes to optical perception...would it look whiter?). Likewise, thinner atmospheres would be less bright than earth's and the colors more ""pure.""</li>
<li>With increasing pressure the sky color at the zenith becomes increasingly yellow. In my image this means that an earth-like sky at 10x earth pressure would appear blueish/green near the zenith.</li>
<li>At lower temperatures I'm assuming the sun would appear tinged by the color listed under ""star temperature."" Otherwise you'll probably only see the star's color when it's near the horizon. </li>
<li>I'm assuming when you get down into K and M class suns, the surroundings on the planet would take on a progressively redder tinge due to the decreasing prevalence of blue wavelength light.</li>
<li>I suspect the gradient of color from horizon to zenith will be steeper/gentler in some atmospheres. I've guessed that the gradient would be more apparent on a high G world (on the right).</li>
</ul>

<p>Part of this was several scientists talking about an experiment with a rock set in orbit (forgive me that I don't have a link to this).

"Why can't the surfaces of stars be observed?","<p>If I'm correctly informed, only three stars: Sol, Betelgeuse and Altair have surfaces which have been resolved by telescopes. All other stars are only point sources of light, even in the greatest of telescopes. Is it just the huge distance to the stars which reduce them to dots? Or is there some other optical explanation? I mean, the Sun is about as large as the Moon on the sky, but I cannot see any details on its surface because it blinds me. However, the next nearest star is invisible to the naked eye.</p>

<p>Some exoplanets have been directly imaged by removing the light from their star. It seems funny that we cannot detect any features on the photosphere of such a star, such as spots or flares or its shape. Plenty of photons are available.</p>

"How would water-ammonia oceans behave?","<p>Scientists strongly suspect that several moons in our solar system have frozen-over oceans of water-ammonia mixture. I've also read speculations on the possibility of surface water-ammonia oceans on exoplanets and exomoons. What I haven't seen a lot of is a discussion on how those oceans might behave differently than the water oceans of Earth.</p>

<p>More specifically, <strong>how would the surface water-ammonia ocean behavior differ from our water ocean behavior</strong> in terms of: </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Ice(s) formation</strong></li>
<li><strong>Evaporation</strong></li>
<li><strong>Surface and underwater currents</strong></li>
<li><strong>Varying ratios of water-ammonia based on temperature or other
factors</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>I'd like to know if this has been studied and if these behaviors have been described in papers, books, or in-depth articles on this topic.</strong> Especially anyting that goes into the specifics of the water/ammonia ratios.</p>

<hr>

<p>I'll add some personal speculation here. <strong>While it is not part of the primary question stated above</strong>, it helps to explain the type of problem I'm trying to understand, so may be helpful to narrow down which resources may be most useful.</p>

<ul>
<li>When subject to increasing levels of heat would the ammonia molecules
in the ocean evaporate before the water molecules, causing warmer
areas of the ocean to have an increased amount of H2O relative to
NH3? (And the cooler areas like the poles having an increasing ratio
of NH3 to H2O).</li>
<li>If the above was true, might the equatorial waters that have less NH3
facilitate the formation of water-ice? If so I could imagine
exoplanets having water-ice-covered equators <em>because</em> they were
warmer, and the cooler poles might be ice-free thanks to the greater
amount of NH3 in the ocean.</li>
<li>Would the ice formed on the ocean be composed of a molecular mix
matching that of the ocean (with H2O and NH3 in the same ratio as the
ocean), or would some molecules freeze-out first, possibly causing
different layers or areas of varying types of ices?</li>
<li>Might the poles of some water-ammonia planets have ""continents"" of
water-ammonia ices that are frozen from ocean bed up to the surface
(thanks to the fact that frozen ammonia is more dense than liquid,
allowing for entire sections of ocean to freeze solid)?</li>
</ul>

<p>If my speculation is correct (and I could be wildly wrong since I don't yet understand how a mix of water-ammonia actually behaves) then an exoplanet with an equatorial band of water-ice, mid-latitudes of liquid ocean, and solid polar-caps/continents of water/ammonia ices could be possible. The ammonia in the ocean would evaporate more quickly near the warmer equator, causing that area of a global ocean to have a greater ratio of H2O, and the ammonia precipitation and ocean might freeze at the poles, causing the build up of vast polar continents of ammonia/water ices. I would imagine the currents would function very differently than on earth, with surface and deep-level currents of varying ammonia-water ratios and temperatures. I I also see the possibility of frozen ocean beds in the more ammonia-heavy parts of an ocean, with the surface unfrozen. </p>

<p>Of course the ratio of ammonia to water will be very important. I'd love to see specific information on that!  </p>

<p>Any informed clarification appreciated!</p>

<p>For example like this: Fixed star A is defined as (0°, 0°), fixed star B is defined as (0°, X). That would constrain the 3 degrees of freedom of a spherical coordinate system.</p>

<p>Just to be clear, by fixed stars I mean stars that do not change their apparent relative position over long time scales, say a million years. So stars in the Milky Way would likely be excluded.</p>

<p>When making a new observation, these two reference stars may not be visible, which would make calibration difficult. But there could be a reference catalog of fixed stars with precisely known coordinates. Any new observation could be made relative to a visible subset of that catalog. This would be similar in principle to the International Temperature Scale of 1990, which defines temperature relative to a set of reference materials and states.</p>

"How big is the Andromeda galaxy in the night sky?","<p>If divide the distance to the sun by its diameter, I get the number <strong>107.517</strong><br>
Likewise, if divide the distance to the moon by its diameter, I get the number <strong>110.650</strong></p>

<p>Both numbers are quite similar which means both objects look roughly the same size in the sky.</p>

<p>Now, I'll do the same calculation for the Andromeda galaxy.<br>
Distance: 2,537,000 light years<br>
Diameter: 220,000 light years</p>

<p>Abstract:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Exomoons are the natural satellites of planets orbiting stars outside our solar system, of which there are currently no confirmed examples. We present new observations of a candidate exomoon associated with Kepler-1625b using the Hubble Space Telescope to validate or refute the moon’s presence. We find evidence in favor of the moon hypothesis, based on timing deviations and a flux decrement from the star consistent with a large transiting exomoon. Self-consistent photodynamical modeling suggests that the planet is likely several Jupiter masses, while the exomoon has a mass and radius similar to Neptune. Since our inference is dominated by a single but highly precise Hubble epoch, we advocate for future monitoring of the system to check model predictions and confirm repetition of the moon-like signal. </p>

"What is the largest (angular) dark area in the sky?","<h2>Question</h2>

<p>Within our current knowledge, what is the largest (circular, say) area in the sky which is empty/dark? I'm thinking in terms of angular size.</p>

<h2>Motivation</h2>

<p>I was wondering what was the largest star as seen from the Earth, other than the Sun of course, in terms of milliarcseconds, say. A search quickly turned up <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_Doradus"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">R Doradus</a> which is <em>huge</em> (57 mas as seen from the Earth). But I wondered if it was possible to rule out any (angularly) larger dark objects by finding stars whose light would be blocked if there was such an object.</p>

<p>Of course we should eventually be able to rule out each such area -- as Hubble Deep Field showed, if you look long enough there's a lot to find everywhere -- but relative to our current knowledge, what are the largest gaps?</p>

<p>I expect that the answer would be in a region which has been missed by a sky survey and which coincidentally doesn't have anything we can see.</p>

"Is there a limit to how fast spacetime can bend/warp around an accelerating object?","<p>If in the future a spaceship can accelerate to nearly the speed of light, will it encounter any kind of resistance/drag from the spacetime in front of it not being able to bend/warp fast enough around it?</p>

<p>It is my understanding that as an object accelerates, its mass will increase and this increase in mass should result in the object having more gravity, and this gravity will continue to increase as the object's speed increases. The creation of more and more gravity should result in an increased area of spacetime surrounding the object being bent/warped.</p>

<p>So, if there is a limit to how fast spacetime can bend/warp around an accelerating object, along with an increased area of spacetime being affected by an accelerating object's increased gravity, will this spaceship start to heat up and begin to melt the faster it accelerates? </p>

"How Would a Neutron Star Actually Appear?","<p>Having seen many pictures produced by artists of neutron stars and planets that orbit some of them, I was wondering how a pulsar would appear to a human being, in visible light (assuming the intense radiation etc. doesn't kill us in the process).</p>

<p>As I understand, the pulsar's beam is projected from the star's magnetic poles rather than rotational poles, which are not necessarily in line with each other. Given that pulsars rotate extremely quickly and the beam could be visible across vast distances - such as if it were shining through the pulsar's nebula - would it appear as a straight line, curved line or perhaps a cone? This is assuming the beam can be seen in visible light.</p>

<p>Given the incredible density of neutron stars and their small physical sizes, would the night sky be visibly distorted to the point where (for example) just after sunset on a hypothetical planet, one could possibly observe other planets near or behind the star that would otherwise be blocked by it?</p>

<p>Given their small surface areas, would a neutron star still appear as luminous as say, the Sun, at a similar distance? How close would you have to get to a neutron star for its apparent magnitude to match the Sun's from Earth?</p>

Even when playing Kerbal space program I came up on Vall expecting to be slowed due to its huge size. Big mistake, slammed into the surface. So, if size isn't the end-all-be-all of why a planet would have an atmosphere, what really causes it? Why wouldn't something like Ganymede, doubly protected by it's own magnetic field and Jupiter's field not have an atmosphere? What causes the planet to lose it once an atmosphere is created? </p>

How nature builds these complex carbon molecules from simpler carbon molecules has been a mystery for many years.</p>
  
  <p>Buseck explained, ""<strong>Longer carbon chains are stablized by the addition of iron clusters.</strong>"" This opens a new pathway for building more complex molecules in space, such as polyaromatic hydrocarbons, of which naphthalene is a familiar example, being the main ingredient in mothballs.</p>

"Do all planets rotate in the same direction in relation to each other?","<p>In other words, does everything spin counterclockwise according to their axes (in relation to each other)? I suppose my question goes for stars, moons and other objects too. </p>

"How to identify component of velocity of a star from its red shift?","<p>When a telescope observes a distant star, all it sees is the light being emitted by the star.

<p>But how do we know that the wavelength that we see is not the red shifted wavelength but the original wavelength emitted by the star? Do we already know what wavelength of light the star is supposed to emit (if yes, how?)</p>

<p>Also, using this method we should be able to identify only the radial component of velocity.

"Why do we believe that the super massive black holes at the centers of two merging galaxies would themselves merge?","<p>When listening to podcasts or watching youtube videos of astronomers discussing galaxy mergers, I often hear talk about how the super massive black holes at their centers will themselves merge during or shortly after the collision. Why do we believe this to be the case?</p>

<p>A priori, I would expect SMBH's to behave the same as all other galactic objects. They might be extraordinarily massive, but physically they are still minuscule compared to the vast empty space between stars in a galaxy. Collisions between objects (not counting gigantic clouds of gas and dust) would be extraordinarily rare, so why do we make an exception for the SMBH's?</p>

<p>I could see a case for them merging in the (rare?) instance where the host galaxies hit each other in such a way that the mutual center of mass happens to coincide with their individual centers of mass. In that case, the SMBH's could be close enough to orbit about one another, losing energy to gravitational waves and eventually merging. I would think that this scenario is rather rare, however. I find it more plausible that an average galaxy merger would leave the SMBH's independently orbiting the center of the combined galaxy, too far apart to lose any significant kinetic energy to gravitational waves.</p>

<p>The astronomers who talk about galactic mergers know a heck of a lot more than I do about the subject, so I presume there are flaws in my assumptions or my understanding of the physics. What am I missing?</p>

<p>From the article:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But the mirror's biggest impact was on the Wide Field Planetary Camera, the instrument expected to provide the dazzling visible and near-infrared images most easily understandable by the public and of tremendous value to astronomers.</p>
  
  <p>""The real killer was Jim Westphal (the WFPC principal investigator at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California), who tended to be very negative,"" Weiler recalled. ""Basically, he said he couldn't do anything. So that's what I was preparing to walk into the press conference with.""</p>
  
  <p>But as it turned out, Weiler had two aces up his sleeve. One he knew about, one he didn't.</p>
  
  <p>The ace he knew about was drawn seven years earlier, when Weiler kicked off work to build a backup camera, the Wide Field Planetary Camera 2, a carbon copy of the original. John Trauger was the principal investigator, the man in charge of the instrument at JPL.</p>
  
  <p>The ace Weiler didn't yet realize was built into the design of Trauger's camera.</p>
  
  <p>Shortly after the first light image came down, ""one of the grand old men of optics here at JPL, Aden Meinel, he and his wife Marjorie wanted to see what the image looked like,"" Trauger said in an interview. ""We brought it up on the screen. ... And he looked at that for five minutes and he said 'that looks like spherical aberration.'</p>
  
  <p>""That was the first time I heard spherical aberration,"" Trauger recalled. ""The thing was, he also said 'well, if it is spherical aberration, you could fix it with Wide Field Planetary Camera 2.' He knew that we had these nickel-sized mirrors in our optical system, which received a sharp image of the primary mirror itself. ... The very last mirror before the image is created on our CCD was an opportunity to straighten the wavefront out. He recognized that, too.""</p>
  
  <p>By giving that mirror a prescription that exactly countered the spherical aberration in the primary mirror, the WFPC 2 would be able to achieve a perfect focus and do all of the science that was intended.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> Where exactly is the modification that first corrected the spherical aberration in Hubble's primary mirror?

"How feasible is it that we could see the Central Black Hole Sgr A* occlude one of it's closely orbiting stars?","<p>I'm thinking about the recent famous photo of a black hole, some months ago. It got me wondering if there isn't a way to more easily make a direct observation of these. </p>

<p>We detect exoplanets in part by phenomenae that occur when they transit their star.</p>

<p>We also have excellent time lapse photography of numerous stars orbiting the Milky Way's central Black Hole (Sgr A*), with timescales quite amenable to human timescales.</p>

<p>Could we observe Sgr A* directly by observing one of these stars passing behind, or almost behind it?</p>

<p>The diameter of the BH is estimated at 60m km, more than 40x the diameter of our sun (1.4m km). At that distance, parallax related effects and relative sizes wouldn't be an issue, as the star and BH are virtually at the same distance both very far from earth. A star also wouldn't have to be occluded, just pass close enough behind, for gravitational lensing to be detected on that fraction of its orbit (but not other places).  </p>

<p>Additionally, a star could also be occluded by an accretion disk (if any), and its light affected in a way that would presumably show something of the nature of what it was passing behind. Admittedly Sgr A* may have little or no disk, but we might detect a disk of low enough density/size/activity not to be active, if a residual disk did in fact exist.</p>

<p>Are we likely to be able to see in time lapse photography, stars vanishing and reappearing behind an apparently empty patch of space, in this way? Has it been done?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Lower frequency GWs can only be seen with LISA. This would include stellar binary systems with orbital periods longer than about 10 seconds, merging supermassive black holes and maybe GWs from the big bang</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This can might include ""event-like"" signals, for example (possibly) a merger of two supermassive black holes that are so large in diameter that even during the merger their orbital frequency is below 1 Hz, but it can also include signals from the rotation of bodies not yet in contact but are slowly losing angular momentum though continuous GW radiation. While these would be much weaker, they would provide a very stable and very narrow peak in a spectrogram with an extremely slow drift, so you could accumulate data for years in order to bring them up out of the noise.</p>

<p>While LIGO's detected events have lasted of the order of 1 second or less, it sounds like it is possible that LISA could potentially record continuous GW radiation from a large number of pairs at the same time since the ""lifetimes"" might be years or millennia rather than seconds, provided that the sensitivity to these weaker signals is sufficient.</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> What is the expected nature of LISA's data; will it be more like a forest of fairly static or slowly moving peaks in frequency space, or a series of individual events? Presumably this has been modeled based on some predictions of the number of different kinds of pairs at various separations expected to be found nearby.</p>

"If the Sun got larger, but maintained its luminosity, would the Earth get hotter or colder?","<p>A recent question <a href=""https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/questions/12921/if-the-sun-were-bigger-but-colder-earth-would-be-hotter-or-colder/12928#12928"">If the Sun were bigger but colder, Earth would be hotter or colder?</a> asked - if the Sun got bigger and cooler, would the Earth heat up or cool down.

  <p><strong>Ari Shapiro, Host:</strong> Sarah Stewart likes to think about what happens when planets collide. She uses two actual cannons to simulate those massive impacts. Here's one firing in her lab at UC Davis.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Unidentified Person:</strong>  Firing in three, two, one.</p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>Soundbite of Cannon FIring</p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p><strong>Ari Shapiro, Host:</strong> Her work earned her a spot in this year's class of MacArthur Fellows. Many of us call it the genius grant. For years, experts have thought that Earth's moon formed after a large collision knocked off a bunch of rock. Stewart told me her research suggests a different story.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Planetary Scientist Sarah Stewart:</strong> During planet formation, when two bodies collide, there's so much energy released that most of these bodies are vaporized. That means that a rocky planet like Earth is mostly rock vapor.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Shapiro:</strong> What is rock vapor, and what does that have to do with our moon?</p>
  
  <p><strong>Stewart:</strong> Rock vapor is taking the rocks that we stand on and heating it up to the point where it becomes a gas. And when that occurs, the Earth becomes much larger because vapor is much less dense. And it extends out into this enormous object hundreds of times larger than the Earth today. And we proposed that our moon grows within the rock vapor of the Earth after a giant impact.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Shapiro:</strong> So the moon actually came from the Earth.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Stewart:</strong> The moon grows within the rock vapor of the Earth. And that gives the moon the same chemistry as the Earth.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We don't learn about ""rock vapor"" in Earth Science class, but I know it's got to be a lot hotter than the lava we see in the news. A significant fraction of Earth's crust is SiO₂ based and it's boiling point is roughly 3,000°C, and I have a hunch the temperatures involved here are much much higher than that. The kinetic energy associated with say a relative velocity of 40 km/s is roughly 8 eV per AMU, over 130 eV for every oxygen atom for example.</p>

<p>So does ""rock vapor"" start out as a highly ionized ""rock plasma"" with almost no covalent bonds remaining, or does most of the energy of the original impactor get transferred to a much greater mass of Earth?</p>

<p>Is there a good place to read about her and her students' MacArthur grant-getting research described in the podcast?</p>

"Why aren't new stars in Earth's relative proximity constantly discovered?","<p>Okay, bear with me. In layman's terms:</p>

<p>The estimates vary, but on a clear night, away from big cities, one can see up to 5000 stars in the sky. All those are in the Milky Way, but they're hardly equidistant from Earth, which would mean that they revolve around the galactic center at different orbits. According to some sources, some are positioned very closely to us while others hang out as far as 1000 light year away.</p>

<p>Now by astronomical standards, 5000 stars is not a great number. It's still pretty impressive, though.</p>

<p>Some stars are larger, and others are smaller. It stands to reason that some of them might be ""hiding"" behind others. Because they all orbit the galactic center at different speeds, using different orbits, wouldn't it follow that from time to time, over the centuries, decades, or even years (months?) a ""new"" star would emerge from behind another one? Shouldn't this be happening often; or are they so sparsely distributed around the galaxy that no ""new"" stars have appeared out there over the past three thousand years or so?</p>

<p>The closest planet to us is Mars, both in terms of its aphelion and its perihelion distances</p>

<p>The Earth-Mars distance varies between 2.66 AU and .38 AU</p>

<p>Mercury is almost always blinded by the sun, so we rarely see it in the sky</p>

<p>Venus is frequently viewed as a crescent, and thus its apparent brightness also dimishes</p>

"How do two supermassive black holes reach ""the last parsec"" in merging galaxies?","<p><a href=""https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/a/32623/7982"">This answer</a> to <em>Why can't supermassive black holes merge? (or can they?)</em> describes the barrier to merging that two supermassive black holes face when two galaxies are in the process of merging or have ""successfully"" merged.</p>

<p>Here is a bit of the answer, but its worth taking a moment to <a href=""https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/a/32623/7982"">go there</a> and read the whole thing:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When two galaxies merge, their supermassive black holes both have angular momentum. Through a phenomenon known as ""dynamical friction,"" gravitational interactions with other stars sap the black holes of much of their angular momentum, until they are brought within a few parsecs or so of each other. At this point, the black holes have flung out all of the stars that were in the region and there is (presumably) nothing left for dynamical friction to sap their angular momentum.</p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
<li>What kind of timescale are we talking about to reach ""the last (few) parsec(s)? Is it similar to the time it takes for the merged galaxy to reach some kind of centralized shape (things rotating around a common center rather than having two identifiable centers of rotation)? Much longer or shorter?</li>
<li>What kinds of processes are involved that allow the two black holes to reach the last few parsecs of separation? What is ""dynamical friction"" and ""star-flinging""?</li>

"How to calculate planetary aspects at a stationary point?","<p>I am using Jean Meeus book Astronomical Algorithms and the C software that comes with the book to calculate planetary data. I am comparing two planet's longitude to calculate the time when they are a fixed amount of longitude apart such as 45, 60, 90 degrees apart. These are the standard planetary aspects used in astrology.  I can not calculate the correct time when one or both of the planets is approaching its stationary retrograde motion point. At this point the planets velocity approaches zero and the longitude does not have the decimal point accuracy to make a comparison. The time will be off by anywhere from a few minutes to eleven hours when compared to a commercial ephemeris. </p>

<p>Q.) Does anyone know a different method other than simple longitude comparison that can calculate the correct planetary aspect time when planets are near their retrograde motion stationary point?  </p>

<p>-- Edit is Below --</p>

<p>Here is an example of my problem. My calculations below are made with Astronomical Algorithms software at 1 minute increments for August 1, 2016 at midnight. The calculations show Venus longitude which is moving Direct Motion and Uranus which is moving Retrograde Motion. The American Ephemeris at midnight lists the Venus 120(Trine) Uranus as occurring at 4:10 AM. The Astronomical Algorithms calculations below identify Venus 120 Uranus at 3:56AM which is 16 minutes early. Every time a slow outer planet like Uranus is near a station point and moving very slow my aspect time is always off.</p>

<p>Q) Is there a different way to calculate the aspect rather than longitude comparison? Maybe use some king of time correction function?</p>

"Planetary Declination and Axial Tilt","<p>Is it a coincidence that Earth's axial tilt and maximum declination are both approximately 23 degrees? </p>

<p>Mechanically speaking, do planets physically cross the Solar equator, or is declination due to the axial tilt angle? The later is difficult to visualize given variety of planetary axial tilts i.e Mercury 0, Jupiter 4, Earth and Saturn 23 degrees approximately. </p>

<p>I'll try and give a concise example. At JPL's Horizons you can download data of RA and DEC for all planets and objects placing either Earth or the Sun at the center. This will calculate the Declination of a planet geocentrically or heliocentrically.</p>

<p>The calculations suggest all planets will obtain a maximum declination North and South between 23&deg; and 28&deg; (i.e Mercury reaches 28&deg; when viewed from the Earth). Earth's axial tilt (obliquity) at 23.45&deg; matches its maximum declination N/S.</p>

<p>However, Mercury's Axial tilt is 0&deg; and Jupiter 3.13&deg; so if declination is the angle between the ecliptic plane and the celestial equator how do Mercury and Jupiter obtain maximum declination of 23&deg; and 28&deg; N/S?</p>

<p>I'll appreciate any help clarifying this.</p>

"How is the term ""solar system"" defined? Could confirmation of a new planet lead to a change in this definition?","<p>Voyager 1 (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_1"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_1</a>) is approximately 140 AU away, and is considered to have left the solar system. Now, the layman's definition of solar system provided by Google is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>...the collection of eight planets and their moons in orbit around the
  sun, together with smaller bodies in the form of asteroids,
  meteoroids, and comets.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And from Wikipedia:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Solar System[a] is the gravitationally bound system of the Sun and
  the objects that orbit it, either directly or indirectly,[b] including
  the eight planets and five dwarf planets as defined by the
  International Astronomical Union (IAU).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At this point, Voyager 1 is well beyond the aphelion of all known planets, so according to the definitions above, so at least colloquially, saying that it has left the Solar System seems to make sense. However, according to Wikipedia, it was only officially considered to have left the Solar System once it left the heliopause. This is not really in conflict with the above definitions, as, to my knowledge, the heliopause extends beyond the orbit of all the original 8/9 planets at all times. The Encyclopedia Britannica (<a href=""https://www.britannica.com/science/heliopause"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.britannica.com/science/heliopause</a>) states that the heliopause
extends for 123AU.</p>

<p>However, the hypothesised Planet 9/X is conjectured to have an aphelion of approximately 1,200 AU and a Perihelion of 200 AU (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet_Nine"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet_Nine</a>). This would seem to bring the two competing definitions of ""solar system"" discussed here into sharp conflict.</p>

<p>Which definition would likely win out? Could the confirmation of such a planet force a reckoning on whether Voyager 1 has truly left the solar system?</p>

<p>Edit:
I wanted to add a more authoritative source that says Voyager 1 has indeed left the solar system.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Voyager 1 is the first man-made object to leave our solar system and pass into interstellar space. Scientists confirmed this finding a year later after studying Voyager’s data, which showed clear changes in the plasma or ionized gas right outside of the solar bubble.</p>

The resolution of wavelengths shorter than what the Very Large Telescope Interferometer or the European Extremely Large Telescope detect, in the near UV, suddenly cuts off to a factor of a thousand.</p>

<p>This is obviously because of the properties of Earth's atmosphere. But major space telescopes like the JWST and WFIRST will fill in the far infrared gap. Why aren't there any as ambitious space telescopes planned for UV and shorter wavelengths? (Or is the sudden cut off in that diagram misleading?)</p>

"What would be the scientific impact of locating the Thirty Meter Telescope at its alternate site?","<p>The NPR.org article <a href=""https://www.npr.org/2019/07/15/741990200/hawaii-protesters-block-access-road-to-stop-construction-of-massive-telescope"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Hawaii Protesters Block Access Road To Stop Construction Of Massive Telescope</a> briefly summarizes the situation, one paragraph says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The TMT, as it is called, has been the object of intense opposition for nearly a decade and the building project has faced numerous delays, protests and lawsuits. But a decision by the state's Supreme Court in October cleared the way for construction to begin after reinstating a building permit that was revoked years earlier. And last week, Gov. David Ige announced several roads would be closed beginning Monday to allow for the movement of large equipment onto the mountain.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and another says</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Hawaii is a unique place,"" Meisenzahl said, noting that protesters gathered on the mountain were engaging in a peaceful, nonviolent form of protest called Kapu Aloha. ""It's a small island and everybody knows each other so law enforcement and opponents are working together. Despite what is happening today it's a positive environment,"" he added. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> What would be the scientific impact of locating the Thirty Meter Telescope at its alternate site? Is it a loss of resolution, or infrared spectrum, or both, or something else?</p>

<p>I think the Canary Island site would be the alternate to Mauna Kea, since the E-ELT would be located in Chile and putting both (extremely) large telescopes in the same hemisphere is undesirable. </p>

"Why does iron consume more energy in the fusion process than it produces?","<p>I understand that once a star starts fusing iron, it's doomed to collapse because iron fusion requires more energy than it releases in the process, allowing the opposing gravity of the star to cause it to collapse.</p>

<p>But why?  What makes iron special in this way?  It seems to occupy a pretty inconsequential spot in the middle of the period table among the transition metals.  So, why is it that iron breaks the rule in play for all the elements before it when it comes to fusion?</p>

<p>I noticed that on another question someone said that it wasn't iron, but nickel that was the first element that required more energy to fuse than it released- but every documentary and book I've read claims that it's iron.  So, if you're answer is ""iron isn't the first element that requires more energy..."" please explain why every other source I've ever heard is wrong!</p>

"The specifics of two Earth-like worlds orbiting each other?","<p>I'm currently looking into writing a story or two set on twin worlds, which I came to find out in my research is apparently not a new idea (Double planets? 
 Rocheworlds?  Am I close?).  But I want it to be as scientifically plausible as possible, so I'm here fact-checking.  I guess my main question going forward is: <strong>is the description of my worlds, as they are, scientifically plausible, and if not, what should I change?</strong></p>

<p>Specifically, these two worlds are very similar to our own Earth.  To simplify things, let's say they have the exact same or relatively similar atmosphere and living conditions, so that humans and Earth-based life can live on it without much or noticeable acclimation.  If you were to hop a ship from Earth and landed on one or the other, getting off the ship you would notice little to no difference than you would on Earth.  Similarly, the short trip between each world shows little to no difference, although one has slightly more gravity than the other.</p>

<p>The only real difference between the two worlds themselves is that one is slightly smaller than the other, but by an almost negligible amount (a few thousand miles); the difference isn't as dramatic as, say, Earth and Mars orbiting each other, maybe Earth and Venus being the better comparison.<br>
Let's also suppose that they are also far enough away from one another that they aren't dramatically effecting one another's gravity or tides, etc., but are still visible in one another's skies, prominent enough to be important to the culture of the other.  I initially wanted them to be very prominent in one another's skies, but I suppose being as close as the moon is to our world would be too close: I'm curious as to how far away one would have to be and still be caught in the other's gravity (I suppose the smaller of the two would have to be the one caught in the bigger one's gravity?  I plead ignorance on that one).  </p>

<p>I'm in love with the idea that they broke off from one another in the same way the Earth and the moon supposedly did billions of years ago, in an impact event, and they slowly came to orbit one another (although this idea has recently been challenged, is my understanding).  From what I've read, though, it might be more plausible that one formed naturally in the disk formation of that planet's solar system, and a rogue planet got caught in its gravitational pull.  I like that idea less, but I'm not so proud I can't just get over it.</p>

<p>In my head, they have their own day and night cycles, just like Earth.  They may not have identical hours in a day or days in a year, etc., but its similar.  They same face of the planet is never quite facing the face of the other: it's not like the moon, which is locked to one side always facing us and the other always away.  From what I've researched, though, it's probably more likely that the planets would be facing one another on one side constantly, and their day-night systems would be greatly affected by that.  Again, not in love with that idea, but if it has to go, it has to go.</p>

<p>That's all I have for now.  I would try to explain how they rotate one another better, but I can't: I'm terrible in that area, and I've forgotten a lot of the terms you use in describing this.  Please let me know what your thoughts are.</p>

"Composition and Proton Flux from the Solar Wind","<p>I am taking a class on the space environment and I have a few questions about the solar wind.  A number of sources list the composition as (approximately) 4% He$^{++}$ and 96% H$^{+}$.  What <em>exactly</em> does this mean?  Does it mean by mass or by number of ions?</p>

<p>Also, when discussing proton flux due to the solar wind at Earth:  What exactly is included in the flux numbers quoted (e.g., one source I have says 2e12 m$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$).  Is that the flux due to only the H$^{+}$ and excluding the He$^{++}$ and other minor constituents?  Or, are they including all the protons from the other ions as well?</p>

"Telescope focal point and inversion","<p>When looking at a diagram of the optical path through a newtonian reflector, the lines always cross before the eyepiece. I understand that the eyepiece is used to focus this diverging light cone so that your eye can observe an image. </p>

<p>If you use a camera in ""prime focus"" i.e. Without an eyepiece to rectify this diverging light cone, it can discern an image anyway? Would this mean that the focus adjustment (distance from the focal point) merely determines the size of the image on the sensor? Or is there still a point where the image is in focus? </p>

<p>How do we ensure that this occurs while the light cone is still smaller than the sensor? Or is the whole image always varied in focus across the cone, just that the depth of field allows all of it to be in focus enough for a good image?</p>

"Array of telescopes with single orbiting collector?","<p>Might such a thing give better images than we could get from other virtual telescopes with multiple collectors? Or is having multiple collectors not a limiting factor? Could a single collector compensate for atmospheric distortion in a way multiple collectors cannot?</p>

<p>We sometimes use arrays of radio telescopes spread over a wide distance to increase the effective aperture. I think that array is called a virtual telescope, but I might be wrong. A normal radio telescope has a collector in the same way that a satellite dish has a collector. The reflector of a radio telescope is parabolic so as to focus parallel waves to a single point. That works because dish and collector are in a fixed geometry. The reflectors of my imagined telescope would need to turn so that they reflected waves from whichever part of the sky was being observed onto the collector. That turning would change the required curvature for perfect parabolic-ness. </p>

<p>The telescope I'm imaging would have a (perhaps geostationary) satellite as the collector and an array of flat-ish reflectors spread over hundreds of kilometers working together to collect waves from the same part of the sky. Being non-parabolic, the reflectors wouldn't be very efficient, but they could compensate by being numerous.</p>

<p>The collector wouldn't <em>have</em> to be geostationary, because the reflectors already need to compensate for the earth turning; adding the satellite's movement into the equation wouldn't be terribly complicated.</p>

"How much radiation would something need to output to sufficiently affect the CMB?","<p>Let’s say that I had some device capable of outputting insane amounts of radiation, across the entire EM spectrum. If I wanted to affect the CMB to the point that, were Earth-based scientists to know that the device existed, they would be unable to gather any useful data from the CMB regarding the early universe, how much radiation would this theoretical device have to output? Peaking in what frequency? Where would be the optimal place to put it? Or multiple copies of it?</p>

<p>If someone who actually knows stuff about the CMB is scratching their head thinking I’m nuts, I probably am. I don’t know much about the CMB, except that it’s random EM waves that are leftovers from the Big Bang, peaking in the microwave frequency range. So if what I’m describing is absolutely implausible across all frequencies and amplitudes, I would appreciate if you could explain why, given my low level of knowledge on the topic. </p>

<p>In the event that for certain waves what I’m describing is possible, I would be curious to know if there’s actually anything in the known universe that could do it.</p>

"What is the main source of opacity in sunspots?","<p>In the first version of my answer to <a href=""https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/q/19001/2153"">Are sunspots vertically displaced from the surrounding photospheric plasma?</a>, I naively used <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kramers%27_opacity_law"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Kramer's law</a> to attempt to show an inverse relationship between opacity $\kappa$ and temperature $T$ due to bound-free or free-free absorption in a region with density $\rho$:
$$\kappa\propto\rho T^{-7/2}$$
Rob Jeffries pointed out that this might not be accurate in the photosphere, even though it works well deeper inside most stars (though for high-mass stars, Thomson scattering dominates and $\kappa$ is approximately constant). After some more reading, I concluded that this was right. At lower temperatures, interactions with ionized hydrogen mean that $H^-$ is the major contributor to opacity, and it follows a law
$$\kappa\propto\rho^{1/2}T^9$$
I believe the transition of dominance happens around $\sim10^4\text{ K}$, meaning that $H^-$ opacity should be the major contribution in the stellar photosphere.</p>

<p>At even lower temperatures, however ($\sim4000\text{ K}$), molecular scattering can be important (see <a href=""http://www.ucl.ac.uk/phys/amopp/people/jonathan_tennyson/papers/407.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Tennyson et al. (2007)</a>). While this is not necessarily important at all points in the stellar photosphere, I think that it should be important in sunspots, which can have temperatures in this range.</p>

<p>What is/are the major source(s) of opacity in sunspots? Does molecular scattering dominate, or is $H^-$ still important? If both are important, to varying degrees, how can the mean opacity be calculated?</p>

"length of Star lifetime","<p>In a star, the fact that not all the hydrogen is used up, not all the helium is used up etc. is a little counterintuitive.</p>

<p>Shouldn't it be that a star looses the hydrogen layer passively, in other words all the hydrogen eventually fuses into helium forming a helium star which then fuses all its helium into carbon forming a carbon star etc. all the way to iron?

"
"Is there a lower limit for the altitude of orbiting objects?","<p>As I understand it, one object can orbit another at a variety of altitudes, and the stability of the orbit is determined by (among other things) the speed of the orbiting object.  Go too slowly and you'll fall into the larger object, go too quickly and you'll fly off into space, but go at just the right speed and you'll orbit indefinitely.  And while an object could be in a stable orbit at Altitude X by going Speed A, it could also be in an equally stable orbit at Altitude Y by going Speed B.</p>

<p>If that's true (and given my limited understanding, feel free to say it simply isn't), is there a lower limit?  An atmosphere would obviously cause drag, but given a lack of atmosphere, could you theoretically have an asteroid stably orbiting an Earth-sized planet at an altitude of 50 feet, if it were going fast enough?</p>

<p>If not, why not?  What forces limit the closeness of an orbiting object?  Also, simple explanations would be most appreciated: I've heard of things like Lagrange points and such, but I don't have a good understanding of them.</p>

"What complementary observation campaigns have looked at Kepler's field of view?","<p>It seems to be common practice to double up observations. For example, shortly before New Horizons flew by Pluto, several of its moons were discovered by telescopes as a concerted effort was put in because of the occasion.</p>

<p>Have other telescopes made systematic and dedicated observations of the field of view of the Kepler telescope? I imagine speculatively in this paragraph that such observations could've been part of a survey process to determine where to point Kepler out of a set of candidate FOVs to begin with. And once decided upon, that field more closely examined. Then during the Kepler mission persistently observed in order to help rule out noise from passing asteroids and binary and variable stars and to gather complementary data. To characterize transiting planets, it is important to characterize the stars they are orbiting, something which telescopes with other kinds of instruments can be helpful with. Those are just my speculations about why I would think that Kepler's primary mission was ""doubled up"" by other kinds of telescopes.</p>

<p>What are some of the preparatory, complementary or follow up observation campaigns that have been made of the Kepler field of view? Is Kepler's FOV now one of the most and best observed parts of the sky?</p>

"Question about space-time","<p>In the Big Bang model of the Universe, every observable thing is thought to have expanded very abruptly from a point of infinite density and zero volume.

How can scientists believe that ""everything"" was condensed and then suddenly expanded, since such is automatically an oxymoron?</p>

<p>Expansion is a physical property of the universe and yet if ""everything"" had no where to expand, how could it have expanded? There was ""nothing,"" was there not? Even if we drop the big bang model and talk about ""everything's"" being in a singularity point, the question still stands.</p>

<p>Where was the singularity point? Asked differently, into what is everything expanding (which is a rhetorical question I ask to implicate space-time as necessarily existing irrespective of any theoretical expansion and likely so vastly that one might as well assume that space-time is infinitely large).   </p>

<p>As well, it seems counter-intuitive, as little impressive a word as that is given its context here, that something like... well, ""everything"" could be condensed in the first place, let alone infinitely condensed and with zero volume. When thinking about the big-bang model, I can't help but conclude that a mere analogy was originally used for stellar birth, evolution and finally explosion. The issue though is still extension.</p>

<p>As far as I understood it, the big bang model states that space itself was also condensed along with everything else in the observable universe to a point of singularity. So, if that's the case, then [where] was the singularity point?</p>

<p>It ends up becoming an infinite regress, of course. Or, if you don't like the issue of ""time"" presupposed by my question, then look at the question after the universe started expanding. All the matter had to expand somewhere and ""somewhere"" is not ""nothing."" - It just seems that the model is somehow overlooking said feature of the actual universe and trying to account for it by mere assertion.</p>

<p>If you want to call it space-time, extension, space, where everything supposedly expanded to and is and is still expanding to, then that's my question. How does the theory allege where everything is yet at the same time assert that prior to the singularity point, there was literally nothing.</p>

"What is the correct ratio of Newtonian to General Relativistic gravitational effects for Sun + single planet orbital system","<p>For a hypothetical orbital system (Sun + single planet) the Newtonian model and the General Relativity (GR) model produce different expressions for the gravitational effect of the Sun on the planet. This is well known.</p>

<p>The ratio between the Newtonian and GR effects is expressed in different ways by different writers.</p>

<p>I am having trouble reconciling two such expressions of the Newtonian:GR ratio.</p>

<p>Firstly <a href=""http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=V4_s91-Vun4C&amp;pg=PA482&amp;lpg=PA482&amp;dq=we+recall+from+section+7.6.1&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=RyU1Adp8h7&amp;sig=qQ5_KyjoDhaSaOadgP8zyy8ubIc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Hlc-VJDJK9TzaoHlgKgL&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=we%20recall%20from%20section%207.6.1&amp;f=false"" rel=""nofollow"">Walter (2008)</a> (equation 12.7.6, page 482) presents  the following expression for the equation of motion produced from the GR model</p>

<p>$$\frac{d^2\,u}{d\theta^2} + u = \frac{GM}{h^2} + \frac{3GM}{c^2}u^2$$
where $u= (1/r)$, $h=vr$, $G$ is the universal constant of gravitation, $M$ is mass of the Sun, $c$ is speed of light.  Here the term $GM/h^2$ is the ordinary Newtonian term and the term $3GMu^2/c^2$ is the additional term introduced by GR.
<p>From this Walter derives the approximate ratio between Newtonian and GR effects as
$(1)$ to $(1 + 3v^2/c^2)$ where $v = \sqrt{GM/r}$ is the orbital speed of the planet in a circular orbit (with distance $r$ = $a$, the semi-major axis).</p>

<p>Secondly, an alternative presentation (referring to the so-called Schwartzchild solution) is given by Goldstein in <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0201657023"" rel=""nofollow"">Classical Mechanics (3rd Edition)</a> pages 536-538.  The GR potential $V_{GR}$ is given by
$$V = -\frac{GMm}{r} -\frac{b}{r^3}$$
where $m$ is the target body mass and $b$ is a constant (Goldstein uses $h$ instead of $b$, see below, but I have already used $h$ to mean something different in Walter above,)
<p> differentiating the potential with respect to distance $r$ to give force we derive
$$F_{GR} = \frac{GMm}{r^2} + \frac{3b}{r^4}$$
<p>Now Goldstein defines the constant $b$ thus :-
$$
b = \frac{k\,l^2}{m^2c^2} \qquad\text{ Goldstein eqtn [12.48]} 
$$
where
$$
k=GMm 
$$
and 
$$
l^2 = mka(1-e^2) \qquad\text{ Goldstein eqtn[12.50]}
$$</p>

<p>So</p>

<p>$$b = \frac{GMm\, m\, GMm\, a(1-e^2)}{m^2c^2}
= \frac{GMm \, L^2}{c^2}
= \frac{GMm \,m^2 v_c^2 a^2}{c^2}
$$</p>

<p>So the GR force equation becomes
$$
F_{GR} = \frac{GMm}{r^2} + \frac{3GMm m^2 v_c^2 a^2}{r^4c^2}
$$
substituting $a$ by $r$ we get
$$
F_{GR} = \frac{GMm}{r^2} + \frac{3GMm m^2 v_c^2}{r^2c^2}
= \frac{GMm}{r^2} \left( 1 + \frac{3 v_c^2 \, m^2}{c^2} \right)
$$</p>

<p>So the Newtonian:GR ratio derived from Goldstein is the same as the ratio derived by Walter except that the former has the additional term of $m^2$ in the numerator.
Even if we tried to fudge this numerically by invoking a unit mass target, it would still be dimensionally incorrect.
<p> So what is the correct ratio?
$$$$
<p>UPDATE ---------------------------------------------------------------------
<p>In the refactoring of $b$ I used angular momentum $L$ when I should have used specific angular momentum $\mathfrak{l}$. After correction the extra $m^2$ disappears. Goldstein agrees with Walter. My thanks to Stan Liou for illumination.
<p>Corrected analysis:-
$$b = \frac{GMm\, m\, GMm\, a(1-e^2)}{m^2c^2}
= \frac{GMm \, \mathfrak{l}^2}{c^2}
= \frac{GMm \,v_c^2 a^2}{c^2}
$$</p>

<p>So the GR force equation becomes
$$
F_{GR} = \frac{GMm}{r^2} + \frac{3GMm v_c^2 a^2}{r^4c^2}
$$
substituting $a$ by $r$ we get
$$
F_{GR} = \frac{GMm}{r^2} + \frac{3GMm v_c^2}{r^2c^2}
= \frac{GMm}{r^2} \left( 1 + \frac{3 v_c^2}{c^2} \right)
$$</p>

<p>So the correct ratio of Newtonian to GR gravitational force is:-
$$
F_{Newtonian}:F_{GR}
\approx  1: \left( 1 + \frac{3 v_c^2}{c^2} \right)
$$</p>

<p>NOTES</p>

<p>This ratio is approximate and only applies in the ""low velocity, weak field"" sub-domain of the GR model.  </p>

<p>Goldstein also emphasises that the GR effect is not a velocity effect (presumably as in the velocity of the target body through any kind of aether or flux).</p>

<p>Coincidentally (in the same sub-domain e.g. Mercury orbitting the Sun) a modified Newtonian radial force of magnitude $f=GMm/r^2 * [1 + 3v_t^2/c^2]$, where $v_t$ is the instantaneous transverse velocity of a small target planet, produces non-Newtonian apsidal rotation (""perihelion precession"") of the same magnitude (within 1%) as GR.  </p>

<p>Goldstein needs to be read with care. Here he uses $l$ to denote angular momentum elsewhere (e.g. eqtn [1.7]) he uses $L$. He often refers to $V$ as ""potential"" when he is clearly referring to ""potential energy"" (e.g. eqtn [3.49]).</p>

"Buying a telescope for the first time. How important is the focal ratio and is a computerised telescope worth it?","<p>I'm wanting to purchase a telescope for the first time.

The Celestron 114LCM has a 1000mm focal length but the aperture is only 114mm where the Orion 130 has a 900mm focal length but a 130mm aperture. Am I right in thinking that the Orion telescope would be better for me?

<p>One reason I'd call it into question is that I'd imagine the properties of boldly blue gasses are different than those of red gasses.

"How unusual is the solar system?","<p>In <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Asimov"">Isaac Asimov</a>'s <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Foundation_Series""><em>Foundation</em></a> series, the main characters are looking for the long-lost Earth. There are two major features of the solar system that seem to make it unusual among the millions of inhabited systems: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rings_of_Saturn"">the rings of Saturn</a> and the size of the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon"">Moon</a>.</p>

<p>The conversations below are mostly between <em>Golan Trevize</em>, ex-military, well-versed in astronomy, and <em>Janov Pelorat</em>, a naïve and recluse history teacher.</p>

<h2>The rings of Saturn</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>""That's what the poem was speaking of. Three wide rings, concentric, wider than the planet itself.""</p>
  
  <p>Trevize said, ""I never heard of such a thing. I don't think rings can be that wide. Compared to the planet they circle, they are always very narrow.""</p>
  
  <hr>
  
  <p>""Is that sort of thing common?"" asked Bliss, awed.</p>
  
  <p>""No,"" said Trevize. ""Almost every gas giant has rings of debris, but they tend to be faint and narrow. I once saw one in which the rings were narrow, but quite bright. But I never saw anything like this; or heard of it, either.""</p>
  
  <p>Pelorat said, ""That's clearly the ringed giant the legends speak of. If this is really unique-""</p>
  
  <p>""Really unique, as far as I know, or as far as the computer knows,"" said Trevize.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>The Moon</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>""A giant satellite is more difficult to accept. No other inhabited world in the Galaxy has such a satellite. Large satellites are invariably associated with the uninhabited and uninhabitable gas-giants. As a Skeptic, then, I prefer not to accept the existence of the moon.""</p>
  
  <hr>
  
  <p>""Yes. It's rather farther from the planet than one might expect but it's definitely revolving about it. It's only the size of a small planet; in fact, it's smaller than any of the four inner planets circling the sun. Still, it's large for a satellite. It's at least two thousand kilometers in diameter, which makes it in the size range of the large satellites that revolve about gas giants.""</p>
  
  <p>""No larger?"" Pelorat seemed disappointed. ""Then it's not a giant satellite?""</p>
  
  <p>""Yes, it is. A satellite with a diameter of two to three thousand kilometers that is circling an enormous gas giant is one thing. That same satellite circling a small, rocky habitable planet is quite another. That satellite has a diameter over a quarter that of Earth. Where have you heard of such near-parity involving a habitable planet?""</p>
  
  <p>Pelorat said timidly, ""I know very little of such things.""</p>
  
  <p>Trevize said, ""Then take my word for it, Janov. It's unique. We're looking at something that is practically a double planet, and there are few habitable planets that have anything more than pebbles orbiting them. Janov, if you consider that gas giant with its enormous ring system in sixth place, and this planet with its enormous satellite in third—both of which your legends told you about, against all credibility, before you ever saw them-then that world you're looking at must be Earth. It cannot conceivably be anything else. We've found it, Janov; we've found it.""</p>

"Why is the Sun so bright, but you can feel it far away?","<p>First of all, the Sun's surface temperature is only about 6000 K. Years ago I was working at at a melt work with furnace temperatures 0f about 2-3000 K; of course you could not be near a furnace without protection, when it was open, but you could still stay some 20-30 metres away from it. Likewise, a light bulb has no long reach, till it fades away. But how about the Sun? Why can experience it at 150 000 000 km away? </p>

<p>Besides, I wonder why space is not heated up, because the heat radiating from all the stars and galaxies is so enormous, and actually the matter density in space is so low. How, actually, can heat be absorbed in space? What temperature is measured in space - is it just the wavelengths of radiations, from which temperature is calculated?</p>

"Could Tabby's star be beamed by a neutron star's jet causing irregular star spots?","<p>There have been some other questions here about what might cause the light curve dips of star KIC 8462852 as observed by Kepler Space Telescope. Here's one I haven't heard before:</p>

<p>Could it be that a neutron star, from Earth yet unobserved, or another supernova remnant in the relative vicinity of Tabby's star, hits it with its polar jet stream? Being in the focus of an irregular jet of charged particles would disturb the star's magnetic field, somehow causing star spot patterns, and upsetting its photosphere perhaps otherwise too.</p>

<p>Can this be excluded?</p>

"Revolution of Planets","<p>Why do planets revolve around the sun? I understand that gravity plays a huge role in allowing it to move around. But what caused it to revolve in the first place?

<p>So is there any possibility in which those two football-size solid objects can collide with each other, or will they will float parallel for an infinite amount of time in the universe?</p>

<p>I'm considering gravity also, and I find that other stars's and planets's
gravitational pull can pull them into their gravitational fields and change their direction.</p>

<p>But what if those two objects will never get destroyed by luck? Could those will collide each other?</p>

"Calculating right ascension for two planets and their separation using python","<p>I am experimenting with the Python library PyEphem for astronomy, and I am trying to recreate/understand some of the basic calculations there.</p>

<p>There is a function called separation that, given two planets and a date/time, it calculates the separation (angle) between those 2 planets with respect to their ""x"" projection in a plane.</p>

<p>So for 2018/1/1 for planets Mercury and Mars, we have:</p>

<pre><code>import ephem
import math

mercury = ephem.Mercury('2018/1/1')
mars = ephem.Mars('2018/1/1')

s1 = ephem.separation(mercury, mars)
print(math.degrees(s1))
</code></pre>

<p>Which returns</p>

<pre><code>33.792384499568264
</code></pre>

<p>But if I wanted to calculate this without the separation function, then I think that the calculation would be as simple as the ""right ascension"" of 1 minus the ""right ascension"" of the other:</p>

<pre><code>math.degrees(mercury.ra) - math.degrees(mars.ra)
</code></pre>

<p>Which returns</p>

<pre><code>35.114532008671574
</code></pre>

<p>Why are the angles different? Since I am not including a latitude and longitude of the observer, all the calculations are supposed to be geo-centric, according to PyEphem.</p>

<p>Is anybody familiar with the calculations going on behind PyEphem, or another library with built-in ephemeris that can produce consistent results for separation?</p>

"Length of a tidal day or by how much is the Moon late each day?","<p>A tidal day is the MEAN time between successive meridian transits of the Moon. (This is sometimes called called a lunar day, a term that should be deprecated for use in this sense, because it is also used for the length of a day on the Moon and should be reserved for the latter meaning to avoid ambiguity.) Its length exceeds a mean solar day of 24 hours by X minutes, which is also the (mean) time-length by which moonrise (or its meridian transit) is later each day than it was yesterday. (<a href=""https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__oceanservice.noaa.gov_education_kits_tides_media_supp-5Ftide05.html&amp;d=AwMFaQ&amp;c=2X_btuPRWkGwRX26NHIotw&amp;r=uOwu8neHJUHgad2beBfZ56ZZjypo5ad7MWWuBxjkUfQ&amp;m=d_8Uoce1JnY95qK1NFicSrftfWFNbTC-imykJ52c384&amp;s=7TwwObW7gwrUwviHeMjRJVa_7PNTD3qBVVu7_oASD9c&amp;e="" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Here</a> is an animation by NOAA demonstrating this principle.)</p>

<p>The exact value of X is variously given in different places, ranging from about 48 to 52. However, I cannot find anywhere an authoritative source detailing the ""correct"" way to calculate X.</p>

<p>Does anyone know of an authoritative method of calculating X, and/or can anyone comment on the three methods given below.</p>

<p>(1) I have a personal theory that puts X at about 48.763 minutes, but I am uneasy about how correct the underlying logic of it is, which is this:</p>

<p>Consider two successive conjunctions (C1 and C2) of the MEAN sun and MEAN moon. At C1, the Sun's azimuth and the Moon's azimuth will, at ALL places on Earth, be the same, and, although this is no longer true for the rest of the lunation, it will once again be true at C2. This is analogous to two clocks: Clock 1 (the MEAN sun) keeps correct time, while clock 2 (the MEAN moon) loses a constant amount of time (X minutes) each day. Since the two clocks agree at C1 and at C2, clock 2 must have lost exactly 24 hours (1440 minutes) during the intervening synodic lunation, whose length (Ln) is 29.5305891203704 days. This suggests that X (the number of minutes that clock 2 loses per day) = (1440 / Ln) = 48.763.</p>

<p>However, I feel uneasy about this logic for this reason: If C1 occurs on April 1 at 06:00:00, UTC, and it is then sunrise at Tema, Ghana (on the prime meridian, near the equator), C2 will be on April 30 at 18:44:03, UTC, and that will not be sunrise at Tema; it will be dusk there, and it will be sunrise at east longitude 169°.</p>

<p>Does this negate the above logic suggesting that X = 24 hours / Ln?</p>

<p>(2) Another method for calculating X suggested to me is this:</p>

<p>It is based on the Moon's sidereal period (Ld), 27.321661 days. The MEAN angular distance along its orbit travelled by the Moon each day is (360° / Ld) = 13.17636° (which equates to a mean orbital speed of about 0.55° per hour.) So, each day, the Earth must rotate 360° plus an extra 13.17636° to point the same meridian back at the Moon again. The Earth's rotational speed is (360° / 24 hrs) = 15° per hour. At that rate, the extra time needed by the Earth to rotate those extra 13.17636° is [(13.17636/360) * 24] = 0.878424 hour = 52.7 minutes.</p>

<p>(3) I argue that even if method (2) is right in principle, it requires two amendments, because:</p>

<p>(a) The Earth rotates 360° in a sidereal day, which is nearly 4 minutes shorter than 24 hours, in which time the Earth rotates nearly 361°, or, more precisely, 360.98565°. (The fraction in the latter value is obtained from the average daily portion of the Earth's orbit: 360°/365.2422 days = 0.985647° per day.) (An animation demonstrating why this is so is <a href=""http://moongazer.x10.mx/website/astronomy/downloads.htm#solarVsidereal"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>.) So, the extra time needed by the Earth to rotate those extra 13.17636° is:</p>

<p>[(13.17636/360.98565)*24] = 0.8760 hours = 52.56 minutes.</p>

<p>(b) Furthermore, in those extra 52.56 minutes, the Moon has moved on in its orbit by nearly another half a degree. More precisely, it is (360/27.321661)*(52.56/1440) = 0.48094°. So the calculation should be:</p>

<p>[(13.17636+0.48094)/360.98565)*24] = 0.90800 hours = 54.48 minutes. </p>

<p>So we have three different methods of calculating X, yielding values of 48.763, 52.56 or 54.48 minutes.</p>

<p>Comments anyone? Either endorsements or criticisms of any of these three methods will be gratefully accepted.</p>

<p>The sentence that particularly intrigued me is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It turns out that there are two possible solutions, as the spin rate increases. You can get an oblate spheroid, or a triaxial ellipsoid - the solution ""bifurcates"". But the triaxial ellipsoid is the most stable of the two as Jacobi found out in his paper published in 1834.  Figures of Equilibrium - Historical Account* - Chandrasekar</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It seems to refer both to an 1834 paper by Jacobi and it's reference in the 1964 paper <em>Ellipsoidal figures of equilibrium—an historical account</em> by S. Chandrasekhar, Communications on Pure and Applied Mathematics, 20 (2), May 1967, 251–265. While the latter is paywalled, there seems to be a readable version <a href=""https://books.google.com.tw/books?id=h_9pDQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA1145&amp;ots=w9oKES1OYs&amp;dq=Figures%20of%20Equilibrium%20-%20Historical%20Account&amp;pg=PA1138#v=onepage&amp;q=Figures%20of%20Equilibrium%20-%20Historical%20Account&amp;f=false"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here in google</a> in the book <em>A Quest for Perspectives: Selected Works of S.

<p>Mathematical bifurcation is a fascinating topic and there is even an <a href=""http://www.worldscientific.com/worldscinet/ijbc"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">entire mathematics journal</a> dedicated to the subject.</p>

<p>In this case, <em>where exactly in the calculation of hydrostatic equillibrium of rotating bodies does this bifurcation</em> (mentioned in the Quora answer) <em>occur?</em> I'm wondering if it simply means that for a given volume and density, below a certain rotation rate the hydrostatic equilibrium shape is an oblate sphere, but above it, the hydrostatic equilibrium shape will be a triaxial ellipsoid? Or is the bifurcation part of the evolution of the shape over time, involving viscocity or external effects?</p>

<p>If the triaxial ellipsoide is always(?) the most stable, then is a oblate spheroid actually an intermediate shape, and not really the shape of hydrostatic equillibrium?</p>

"How did they measure the distance to the center of our galaxy to 0.3% accuracy?","<p>The abstract of <a href=""https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2019/05/aa35656-19/aa35656-19.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">A geometric distance measurement to the Galactic center black hole with 0.3% uncertainty</a> (Open Access) says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We present <strong>a 0.16% precise and 0.27% accurate determination of R₀, the distance to the Galactic center.</strong> Our measurement uses the star S2 on its 16-year orbit around the massive black hole Sgr A* that we followed astrometrically and spectroscopically for 27 years. Since 2017, we added near-infrared interferometry with the VLTI beam combiner GRAVITY, yielding a direct measurement of the separation vector between S2 and Sgr A* with an accuracy as good as 20 μas in the best cases. S2 passed the pericenter of its highly eccentric orbit in May 2018, and we followed the passage with dense sampling throughout the year. Together with our spectroscopy, in the best cases with an error of 7 km s−1, this yields a geometric distance estimate of R₀ = 8178 ± 13stat. ± 22sys. pc. This work updates our previous publication, in which we reported the first detection of the gravitational redshift in the S2 data. The redshift term is now detected with a significance level of 20σ with fredshift = 1.04 ± 0.05.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and figure 2 shown below provides an example of the error analysis post fitting.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>If you have the <em>angular size</em> of an orbit and a set of radial velocity measurements, even if it was viewed edge-on and the inclination was known, wouldn't this give only a parametric relationship between R₀ and the mass of the central object?</p>

<p>I don't understand how they were able to state a specific value for R₀, I'm probably missing something obvious but I can't figure it out. According to <a href=""https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/a/28241/7982"">this answer</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>We have reasonably good measurements of the mass of Sagittarius A*, thanks to measurements of the movements of stars like S0-2 over several decades.</strong> It's been well-established that the mass of the central object is <span class=""math-container"">$M\approx4\times10^6M_{\odot}$</span>;</p>

<p>so to me the whole situation appears on the surface to be circular referencing. I'm sure it isn't of course, I'm just missing something.</p></li>

"Reflector vs refractor in terms of magnification, which one wins?","<p>I'm thinking about getting a telescope and i'm debating between these 2 telescopes: <a href=""https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B00LY8JWAQ"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">meade</a> and <a href=""https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B00D12U1IK"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">orion</a>. Theyre both the same price so this question is not about the money, but about getting the most out of your money. I like the Meade 102 mm (or 4 inches) because it is a refractor, which means it is more lightweight and compact. The orion starblast 4.5 on the other hand is a reflector and therefore more clumsy.  </p>

<p>My question is, is a reflector necessarily better than a refractor in terms of magnification and sharpness of image? The orion does have a slightly bigger aperture (half inch bigger) but I don't think that makes a huge difference. The question really is, a reflector vs a refractor, which one is more desirable in terms of magnification, and how much of a difference does it make? </p>

<p>Just judging from the reviews it would seem like the reflector (orion) wins the fight. For example, Saturn's rings according to some reviewers are ""clearly visible"" in the reflector, but not so with the refractor which most reviewers agree, Saturn will be very tiny and the rings barely visible.  </p>

<p>So will I settle for magnification if I get the refractor instead of the reflector, or are they basically the same and in that case I would choose the refractor (meade) over the reflector since it is more compact, and is also easier for beginners like me?</p>

"The relation between the energy of star and heating effect","<p>Because a star's temperature is an indication of the energy passing through each unit of its surface, it follows that for cool red and hot blue stars of identical luminosities, the cooler red star must be considerably smaller so that the energy escapes through a reduced surface area and has a far greater <strong><em>heating effect</strong>.</em> Hence, knowledge of a star's colour and luminosity can reveal its size.</p>

<p>In particular, I can't understand the relation between energy and the heating effect. Of course, I searched for the word ""the heating effect"" in my own language. Also, I Googled in English. </p>

<p>In this context, what is the heating effect? Could you explain to me? If you give me any help, it will be very useful to me.  </p>

"Time dilation at the Big Bang","<p>At the time the Big Bang happened the matter had enormous density. According the GR (I may be wrong here) such density dilates time.</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> How far have stars been seen beyond the center of the Milky Way? Though this area is opaque in visible wavelengths, infrared imaging and interferometry has led to sharp images near Sgr A*.

<p>= I understand that one of the reasons the arms ""appear real"" is just that there are more bright young stars forming in the arms (due to the higher pressure). Perhaps the actual density difference is very low?</p>

I assume this would be enough to make the moon look ""different"" to the naked eye so I'll go with that concrete figure.</p>

<p>...or is the moon in either a state of near-equilibrium or is it ""wobbling"" due to other forces outside the gravitational pull of the earth (e.g. pull of the sun, asteroid bombardment, comets passing by, etc.) having minor effects on its rotational state and thus making it's rotation inconsistent and unobservable?</p>

<p>Without a scale for reference, it's hard to get an angular frequency and compare to an Airy-like diffraction pattern to get a diameter, and that's where it gets more puzzling, because you need a narrow wavelength range to get a coherent oscillation for so many cycles (I think I can see perhaps 15 or more sharp, distinct rings), and to zeroth order stars are mostly black-body.</p>

"How can gravity lead to the Big Crunch scenario?","<p>According to modern cosmology, space is expanding, causing proper distances (but not comoving distances) to increase between galaxies. In the Big Crunch hypothesis, gravity halts and reverses the expansion of the Universe, causing all matter to collide and eventually form a single black hole. This gives way to other oscillating universe hypotheses, which generally propose that the conditions in a compressed Universe would be the same as those during the Big Bang, leading a cycle of expanding and contracting universes.</p>

<p>Ignoring the <a href=""https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/questions/13615/are-there-any-studies-that-prove-disprove-the-oscillating-universe-theory/18569#18569"">problems with entropy</a> in reverting the Universe to Big Bang conditions, how can gravity be the cause of a Big Crunch in the first place? Specifically, gravity (to my knowledge) only curves space; the idea that it can revert the Universe to the conditions of the Big Bang seems to imply that gravity actually can contract space. Is this actually the case?</p>

<p>If not, the gravitating objects should be moving through a comoving coordinate system, so space itself would not actually be contracting. As far as I can tell, we would have all the Universe's matter compressed within a single point in space, instead of space itself contracting. This should be completely unlike the Big Bang, when space was far less dilated than it is now. If this is in fact what the Big Crunch hypothesis describes, than I'm utterly confused as to how an oscillating universe could work in such a situation.</p>

<p>Am I mistaken, or do the Big Crunch and oscillating universe hypotheses imply that gravity actually contracts space (as in, the comoving distances of gravitationally attracting objects would not change)? If not, how could gravity possibly lead to these scenarios?</p>

"How did the Mars satellites ""take cover"" from the recent comet flyby?","<p>After comet Sliding Spring's Oct. 19, 2014 close flyby of Mars, <a href=""http://www.nasa.gov/jpl/comet-siding-spring/#.VEVDVkQRhtg"" rel=""nofollow"">NASA</a> reports that </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>All three NASA orbiters around Mars confirmed their healthy status Sunday after each took shelter behind Mars during a period of risk from dust [from the comet's tail].</p>
</blockquote>

<p>""Took shelter behind Mars""?  These spacecraft are in orbit around Mars, constantly in motion, so they can't very well just pack up and move to the other side of Mars to avoid getting hit with the dust.</p>

<p>So my questions are: What exactly qualifies as taking shelter behind Mars?  Does it simply mean being on the other side of the planet from the tail of the comet as dust from the tail passed Mars?</p>

<p>How did NASA get the (constantly in motion) spacecraft to hide behind Mars?  I assume that the orbits had to be modified in advance of the comet's arrival. I picture some orbital modifications that changed the phase of the orbits of the satellites so that they would be on the other side of Mars as the dust flew by, perhaps also making the orbits more elliptical with the apsis behind Mars, allowing the satellites to spend additional time in Mars' protection.</p>

<p>Will these orbital modifications affect the ability of the spacecraft to fulfil their primary missions as they relate to Mars?  I am not asking whether dust from the comet will affect the quality of the instruments on the spacecraft (indeed, this whole question focuses on steps NASA is taking to prevent that from happening) but whether the altered orbits the spacecraft have after their orbital modifications will affect their ability to pursue their primary missions (such as flying over different parts of Mars than was originally intended, which may or may not be beneficial to answering the questions the spacecraft were originally launched to answer.  Although scientists are nothing if not resourceful and I'm sure any data that come from the spacecraft, whether intended or not, will lead to important discoveries).</p>

"What is a ""semester series"" for eclipse prediction? - Solar saros series 147 and 152","<p>Yet again, I just stumbled across another baffling eclipse question (actually, two now). I was interested in two eclipses (Saros series 147 and 152) that will both be occurring in 2021. Each of these eclipses will occur relatively near the opposite poles of the earth. <strong>The Wikipedia link for saros 147 provided the following additional information:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Solar eclipses of 1964-1967[edit]</p>
  
  <p><strong>This eclipse is a member of a semester series</strong>. <em>An eclipse in a
  semester series of solar eclipses repeats approximately every 177 days
  and 4 hours (a semester)</em> at alternating nodes of the Moon's orbit.[1]
  ""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These are both fairly young saros series. Saros 152 is comprised of 70 eclipses, while saros 147 contains a total of 80 eclipses. <strong>Observations:</strong> <strong>They are 10 eclipses difference in length - They each began 180 years apart.</strong> So, following on from that, I checked out their ending dates and found, much to my amazement, that <strong><em>both series end during the exact same year</em></strong> - <strong>exactly 177 day apart - in the year 3049</strong> !!!</p>

<p>So, since this additional information, my new questions concerning these eclipses have become: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>1) <strong>What exactly is a ""semester series"" for eclipses (any detail)?</strong> <em>The day spacing definition is obvious but doesn't explain much else.</em> </p>
  
  <p>2) <strong>Does this mean that <em>some or all</em></strong> eclipses in series 147 and 152 are in
  the same semester series?</p>

"How can a gas planet become tidally locked with a star?","<p>Supposing a planet is made entirely of gas, is it possible for the planet to become tidally locked with the star it orbits? </p>

<p>I know when a terrestrial planet orbits a star in a different amount of time than the length of its day, the planet warps continuously, resulting in tidal heating. This heating takes energy from the planet's rotation until it stabilizes in a tide-locked formation. </p>

<p>I believe a purely gaseous planet would also have some sort of internal heating for the same reason. But because the ""surface"" of a gas planet is fluid, it must also obey thermodynamic principles.</p>

<p>As a basic example, the side of the planet facing a star gets hot, and the side facing away gets cold. The hot gas expands and the cold gas contracts and you get convection, Hadley cycles, prevailing winds, and chaotic weather patterns.</p>

<p>So it seems like there's a battle between gravity, which wants the gas to stop moving and become tide-locked, and thermodynamics, which wants the surface to roil with convection.</p>

<p>Does one process dominate over the other? Does one process slowly take over as the other fades away? Can it go either way?</p>

<p><strong>Is this the correct way to calculate the relative abundances?</strong>  This equation gives a value of 0.343 for the helium abundance relative to hydrogen, which seems to be the correct value for the sun (the sun is usually quotes as being about 70% H and about 25% He, which gives a relative abundance of 0.357).

  <p><strong>This question was left over from the last question I had, so I am asking it separately here:</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have been looking into two solar eclipses <strong>(Saros series 147 and 152) that will both be occurring in 2021</strong>. Each of these eclipses will be happening near the opposite poles of the earth.  Both are part of young saros series. Saros 152 is comprised of 70 eclipses, while saros 147 contains a total of 80 eclipses. These series are 10 eclipses difference in length and began 180 years apart. So, I happened to check out their ending dates and found that both series are projected to end during the exact same year - 177 day apart – together in the year 3049. <strong>I thought that both of these series ending together one semester apart in the very same year was a pretty amazing coincidence.</strong></p>

<p>So, checking further – it seems new saros series start from as few as 7 years apart to as many as 100 years apart (this is extremely variable spacing, but it averages to about 31 years apart over the usual 1260+ year active series lifespan). <strong>I wanted to know why series 147 and 152 would both be ENDING at the same time.</strong>  I went back to the NASA website, and checked the 5000 year listing of all solar saros series numbering 0 through 180. I only found one other such instance of two solar saros series ENDING in the same year – series 49 and 54 both ENDED together in 32 CE – so it seems like a pretty rare event.</p>

<p><strong>But then, I checked to see if there were any occasions of two saros series BEGINNING together in the same year.</strong> Going back to the NASA website again with this question, I checked the 5000 year listing of all solar saros series numbering 0 through 180. I only found one single example of two saros series both BEGINNING in the same year. This time series 142 and 147 both BEGAN together in the year 1624 CE.</p>

<p><strong><em>Not only is solar saros 147 involved in BOTH of these ""same year"" cases, but all three series eclipses will be presenting themselves during a single upcoming semester series in 2021 – solar series 142</em></strong> (Dec 14, 2020), <strong><em>147</em></strong> (June 10, 2021),
<strong><em>and 152</em></strong> (Dec 4, 2021). </p>

The driver of the train sees the ball approaching at 80 km/h and then departing at 80 km/h after the ball bounces elastically off the front of the train. Because of the train's motion, however, that departure is at 130 km/h relative to the train platform; the ball has added twice the train's velocity to its own.</p>

<p>I have two problems with this:</p>

<ol>
<li>The train's speed relative to the platform is 50 km/h. The ball, traveling in the opposite direction, is going at 30 km/h. Thus, the train operator will indeed see the ball at </li>
</ol>

<p>50 + 30 = 80 km/h. </p>

<p>So far, so good. However, once the ball has hit the front of the train (let's assume that no speed at all is lost in the process), it'll have the train's velocity (50 km/h) added to its own (30 km/h): </p>

<p>50 + 30 = 80 km/h. </p>

<p>Because the train's velocity relative to the platform is 50 km/h, and the ball's now 80 km/h, the operator will see it departing from him at</p>

<p>80 - 50 = 30 km/h.</p>

<ol start=""2"">
<li>As already mentioned above, the ball's velocity relative to the platform after the bounce will be</li>
</ol>

<p>The train's velocity (50 km/h) + the ball's initial velocity (30 km/h) = 80 km/h, and <em>not</em> twice the train's velocity. </p>

<p>What am I missing?</p>

<p><strong>Addendum:</strong></p>

<p>This is kind of comical:</p>

<p>You're watching a tennis match. Player A serves the ball at 200 km/h. Player B returns the serve, the speed of his racket added to DOUBLE the speed of the ball. Player A then puts in a ground stroke, and the speed of the ball doubles again. If they keep this up, then, according to the above logic, the speed of the ball relative to the court will be approaching the speed of light before they know it.</p>

<p>Again: what am I missing?</p>

"Viewing a solar eclipse through a leafy tree","<p>Viewing my Facebook feed today, my local news station posted regarding a solar eclipse taking place today:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/At6y5.png"" alt=""Facebook post - Solar Eclipse""></p>

<p>Note the line about using a leafy tree as a filter:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Scientists say NOT to directly look at the sun (if skies are clearing where you are), but looking at the eclipse through a leafy tree creates a natural filter!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I've heard a lot of people recommend viewing a solar eclipse by looking at the projection of the eclipse caused by light passing between leaves in a tree, in this case looking at the ground or a wall, where ever the light hits after passing through the tree.  However, the Facebook posting here seems to recommend looking up at the solar eclipse <em>through</em> the tree.</p>

<p>I suspect that they have misunderstood the projection method (or inadequately explained), and their advice is not only wrong, but potentially dangerous.</p>

<p>Is this method recommendable? Should it be considered dangerous?</p>

<h2>Follow-up</h2>

<p>Almost immediately upon having seen the posting I had commented on it noting my belief that such advice could be dangerous, including a more clear explanation of how viewing using trees should be done. The staff member who originally posted the status later took note of this and edited the status to less ambiguously explain viewing the projection. Unfortunately, this was done <em>after</em> the solar eclipse had concluded. Hopefully no damage was done.</p>

Is it possible to observe changes in it over a period of 10 years or 100 years, as it ages and cools, as the Hubble Bubble expands?</p>

<p>And how is the landscape of the CMB-map expected to change? Are relatively cool and hot areas permanent over time scale much larger than 380 000 years, or would our CMB-map be unrecognizable if we had lived, say, a billion years earlier or later?</p>

But how and why do blue stars of about 8-10 or more Solar masses which turn into black holes, change how frequently and observably they accrete material from their environment when they transform into BH? Maybe because the supernova ejects material, some of which doesn't get far and is re-accreted when the stellar wind ceases?</p>

<p>The answers given are good and answer my question; I'll just clarify some one thing (based on the comments) for posterity.</p>

<p>I would define ""broken"" as when any significant amount of mass is removed from the neutron star, as in mass shedding, as <a href=""https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/questions/7778/is-it-possible-to-break-apart-a-neutron-star/7802#7802"">Mitch Goshorn wrote</a>.

<p>Now if we assume the Earth moves in a circular orbit around the Sun, then the Sun's orbit around the Earth will also be circular. (Just use geometric the definition of a circle - the set of all points a fixed distance from a given point.). Specifically it's the great circle formed by the intersection of the ecliptic plane with the celestial sphere.</p>

<p>But the Earth does not move in a circular orbit - Kepler's first law states that the Earth moves in an ellipse around the Sun, with the Sun at one of the foci of the ellipse.  So if we consider the Earth's elliptical orbit around the Sun, what is the shape of the Sun's orbit around the Earth.  I doubt it's an ellipse, so would be it a more complicated-looking curve.</p>

<p>I wanted to take a close look at the three depiction of the solar system models (left to right):</p>

<p>I cant figure out what some of the symbols and circles are supposed to mean. I have marked everything im unsure about <em>partially or completly</em> in red.</p>

The ptolemaic system is a geocentric system, meaning it has the Earth as its center. I have identified most of the symbols that mark the orbits, although I'm missing two. Furthermore, the 5 outer most orbits(?) are what I'm unsure about. As far as I understand it, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Claudius Ptolemy</a> believed not only that the Earth was the center of the universe (making this a model of the universe and not the solar system) but also, that the stars were laying on the inside of the universesphere. Therefore I can imagine that the innermost ring is just to close of the sphere. But there are still 4 rings left.</p>

<p>In addition to the rings, I cant identify the third (anchorlike) and the fifth symbol.</p>

<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tychonic_system"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><strong>Tychonic System:</strong></a></p>

<p>Here again I'm unsure about the two outer rings, and the third, not dotted, orbit around the Sun. 
The two innermost orbits are Venus and ?</p>

<p>If the (red)dotted orbit is supposed to be the Earth's orbit around the Sun, then why does the earth have <em>two</em> orbits? </p>

<p>Also, what are the two stars under the Moon?</p>

<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copernican_heliocentrism"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><strong>Copernican System:</strong></a></p>

This one is rather straight forward. I'd like to know which of Saturn's moon's orbits this illustration depicts and if my guesses on Jupiters moons are correct.</p>

<p>And at last, what are the 4 marks, <em>A, B, C and D</em> for?</p>

<p>I hope you can help me! Thanks</p>

"Stability of orbital resonance","<p>Recently I've become more interested in the topic of the stability of planetary systems. I have been reading about it and it seems that orbital resonances play an important role in the stability of Solar System (as well as in the moons of Jupiter and other planets).</p>

<p>I first thought that the orbital resonance is somehow more stable and thus we have several cases in the Solar System.</p>

<p>But as I kept reading, I found out that in the asteroid belt there were some gaps precisely where the resonances happen, so the resonances are actually instable for asteroids.</p>

<p>I then thought that some resonances are stable while others are instable, but some of the resonances that makes gaps in the asteroid belt are actually present in the Solar System between planets, so I am completely lost.</p>

<p>Why resonances are sometimes stable and sometimes instable? What am I missing?
Maybe I am misunderstanding something because it doesn't make sense to me. Any help will be welcome.</p>

"Relative black hole?","<p>When some object is moving, it appears smaller and more massive. What if it's moving so fast it should become a black hole? Some calculations:</p>

"Sun as our Supergiant","<p>Let's talk about the time when our sun becomes a supergiant. We know that our solar system may get destroyed or it may get affected due the large mass of the supergiant and also due to the large temperature. But somehow let us consider nothing happened to our solar system by luck. It's obvious that life won't be possible on earth anymore(due to the extreme heat), but is there a possibility that, the events that took place during the formation of Earth, may take place in the far off planets? Can life formation take place in some other planet just like it happened in Earth??</p>

"Accuracy of Laplace Method for determining orbital elements","<p>Recently I had to implement Laplace method and apply it to 3 observations of Mars (10 days in between two observations). The results were pretty good, with discrepancies with real data well below 5% in most of the orbital elements.</p>

<p>I supposed that Laplace method was very accurate, so I tried to apply it to an asteroid (CASLEO, 5387). The 3 observations were also 10-days spaced but now the results widely diverge from the real orbital elements.</p>

<p>I expected it to be less accurate than in the Mars case since the observations covered less fraction of the orbit, but some of the elements were quite far from expected.</p>

<p>So my question is: What is the accuracy of the Laplace Method? Is it really that sensitive to the distance?</p>

"Has star KIC 8462852's 3 year long Kepler-fading continued after the primary Kepler mission ended?","<p>BACKGROUND</p>

<p>May 11, 2013 the Kepler space telescope ended its primary mission. Data captured until then showed that the now famous ""Tabby's star"" or ""Boyajian's star"" (KIC 8462852) had been <a href=""https://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.01316v2.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">fading throughout</a> the Kepler mission by about 3% cumulatively. <em>(This independently of other reports of brief very deep dimmings and restorations during the mission.)</em></p>

<p>QUESTION</p>

<p>Today when I post this question, about as much time has passed by since the primary Kepler mission ended, as that mission lasted. So this makes me wonder if other telescopes have observed, or should've been sensitive enough to have observed, a continuation of such a fading trend for that star? Another 3%.</p>

<p>DISCUSSION</p>

<p>If not, what could the explanation be for why this 3+ year fading trend was suddenly interrupted when the primary Kepler telescope mission was terminated? And how long would it take to determine from ground based observatories whether this particular dimming trend continues or not?</p>

"Apparent Magnitude / Apparent Brightness relationship help","<p>I'm a high-school student that is currently working on a project that describes, using mathematical notation and explanation, how scientists can find the values of each of the properties of stars, such as Luminosity, Temperature and Mass. Currently, I'm struggling with finding the equation for the apparent brightness and apparent magnitude of a star. I have stumbled across something called the ""Pogson relation"", but need help it a couple of things.  </p>

<p>I found the description of how to use it in <a href=""https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/a/414"">another post</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The easiest way to determine the magnitude of a given star is probably to use the Pogson relation. The idea is to determine the magnitude of a star knowing the magnitude of a reference star; it is thus quite easy, using a well-known reference as Vega or Sirius.</p>
  
  <p>The Pogson relation is given by:</p>
  
  <p><span class=""math-container"">$$m_1-m_2=-2.5\ log\ \left({\frac{E_1}{E_2}}\right)$$</span></p>
  
  <p>where <span class=""math-container"">$m_1$</span> and <span class=""math-container"">$m_2$</span> are the magnitudes of star 1 and star 2 (your reference star), and <span class=""math-container"">$E_1$</span> and <span class=""math-container"">$E_2$</span> brightness</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Firstly, is there any version of this equation which doesn't have a comparison between two stars, but rather a direct relation so that given <span class=""math-container"">$M_{\text{Apparent}}$</span>, I can find <span class=""math-container"">$E$</span> of the star?</p>

<p>Secondly, if not, then what I had trouble with was the 'well-known reference' part of the explanation. It said that I use a value for <span class=""math-container"">$E_2$</span> that is known. However, after researching for the value of the apparent brightness, or its other name flux, for both Sirius and Vega, I have come up empty-handed. Is there a place that I can find this? I've looked at Wikipedia, even consulted the Gaia database, but in the field, there was nothing, just the apparent magnitude.</p>

<p>Lastly, is there any way to directly measure the apparent magnitude of a star with a scientific instrument, like how a CCD camera is used to measure the apparent brightness?</p>

<p>You are all free to pick this project up at any point and have fun experimenting!</p>

<p><strong>update!!! (Nov10)</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>velocity is now proper deltaV and giving additional motion now calculates
sum vector of velocity </li>
<li>you can place as many static objects as you
like, on every time unit object in motion checks for gravity vectors
from all sources (and checks for collision)</li>
<li>greatly improved the performance of calculations</li>
<li>a fix to account for interactive mod in matplotlib. Looks like that this is default option only for ipython. Regular python3 requires that statement explicitly. </li>
</ul>

<p>Basically it is now possible to ""launch"" a spacecraft from the surface of the Earth and plot a mission to the Moon by making deltaV vector corrections via giveMotion(). Next in line is trying to implement global time variable to enable simultaneous motion e.g. Moon orbits Earth while spacecraft tries out a gravity assist maneuver.</p>

</code></pre>

<p><strong>How it works</strong></p>

<p>It all boils down to two things:</p>

<ol>
<li>Creating object like <code>Earth = Object(name=""Earth"", position=(50.0, 50.0), radius=6.371, mass=5.972e24)</code> with parameters of position on grid (1 unit of grid is 1000km by default but this can be changed too), radius in grid units and mass in kg.</li>
<li>Giving object some deltaV such as <code>Craft.giveMotion(deltaV=8500.0, motionDirection=100, time=130000)</code> obviously it requires <code>Craft = Object(...)</code> to be created in the first place as mentioned in previous point. Parameters here are <code>deltaV</code> in m/s (note that for now acceleration is instantaneous), <code>motionDirection</code> is direction of deltaV in degrees (from current position imagine 360 degree circle around object, so direction is a point on that circle) and finally parameter <code>time</code> is how many seconds after the deltaV push trajectory of the object will be monitored. Subsequent <code>giveMotion()</code> start off from last position of previous <code>giveMotion()</code>. </li>
</ol>

<p>Questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Is this a valid algorithm to calculate orbits?</li>
<li>What are the obvious improvements to be made?</li>
<li>I have been considering ""timeScale"" variable that will optimize calculations, as it might not be necessary to recalculate vectors and positions for every second. Any thoughts on how it should be implemented or is it generally a good idea? (loss of accuracy vs improved performance)</li>
</ol>

<p>Basically my aim is to start a discussion on the topic and see where it leads. And, if possible, learn (or even better - teach) something new and interesting.</p>

<p><strong>Feel free to experiment!</strong></p>

<p>Try using:</p>

<pre><code>Earth = Object(name=""Earth"", position=(50.0, 100.0), radius=6.371, mass=5.972e24)
Moon = Object(name=""Moon"", position=(434.0, 100.0), radius=1.737, mass = 7.347e22)
Craft = Object(name=""SpaceCraft"", position=(43.0, 100.0), radius=1, mass=1.0e4)

Craft.giveMotion(deltaV=10575.0, motionDirection=180, time=322000)
Craft.giveMotion(deltaV=400.0, motionDirection=180, time=50000)
</code></pre>

<p>With two burns - one prograde at Earth orbit and one retrograde at Moon orbit I achieved stable Moon orbit. Are these close to theoreticaly expected values?</p>

<p>Suggested exercise: Try it in 3 burns - stable Earth orbit from Earth surface, prograde burn to reach Moon, retrograde burn to stabilize orbit around Moon. Then try to minimize deltaV. </p>

<p>Note: I plan to update the code with extensive comments for those not familiar with python3 syntax. </p>

"View from inside the black hole","<p>If an observer is falling toward a black hole with its face away from singularity then what will he observe after crossing the event horizon? The reason that why I am asking this question because as far as I know for an outside observer, the falling observer appear to freeze at event horizon i.e. time appear to stop for falling observer. So if the falling observer is able to look outward after crossing event horizon then he will be able to see an infinite amount of time which is impossible. So what will the observer see after crossing the event horizon?</p>

"Is it possible to tell the time of day by shadows on the photo","<p>I have a photo where objects and their shadows (e.g. trees, people) are visible, the Sun is not visible directly, but it is clearly neither dusk nor dawn.</p>

<p>Let's assume that coordinates of this place are known more or less precisely so that I can find it on google maps.</p>

<p>I also know the date when this photo was taken but don't know <em>the time of day</em>. Is it possible to estimate it from the photo?</p>

<p>I have a debate with a friend of mine about this.
My friend states that a reasonable enough estimate is to calculate the Sun's elevation above the horizon by</p>

<p>$$
\text{elevation} = \arctan \frac{\text{object's height}}{\text{shadow's length}}
$$</p>

<p>and then use one the myriad websites on the internets to look up the time for that date and location.</p>

<p>I doubt it because</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The length of a shadow on the photograph depends on the relative position of the Sun, the object <em>and the camera</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Most importantly, the slope of the ground can't be estimated neither from the photo, nor from google maps. <a href=""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/04/Apollo14Shadows.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">This picture</a> is a good example.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Who's right? Am I missing something?</p>

<p>Also, it would be interesting to understand the role of uncertainties in this calculation. Assuming that the surface is reasonably smooth and the slope is close to zero, what uncertainties (location, object's height, shadow's length, the slope, camera position) would play the major role? Does it depend on the time of year?</p>

<p>Howdy, this might be an odd question, but I'm using whatever information I gather here to help write an alternate universe version of the 1950s through 1980s. Due to some convoluted plot contrivance involving several delays to the moon landing, the very last pass behind the moon the Apollo crew takes place during a lunar eclipse. Now, I unfortunately don't have access to any simulation software, so I'm not sure what that would look like to them! How much of the lunar surface would the crew be able to see in passes that occur beforehand, and what does the phenomenon look like from space? Do we know what it might look like?
Time is not of the essence, but I still need to know these details before writing this particular section of the story.</p>

"Could the Earth be used to cast an arago/poisson spot on something","<p>There's a <a href=""http://www.gizmag.com/aragoscope-lensless-telescope/35761/"" rel=""nofollow"">potential design for a space-based telescope</a> that uses a large opaque circular disk in place of a transparent lens to focus light for analysis. It uses the light that bends around the disk that focuses on the Poisson or Arago spot, but requires a circular object. It could theoretically produce much clearer images (1000x) than telescopes we have today, albeit with a narrower field of vision.</p>

<p>I understand that the Earth is not perfectly round, but I believe I've also heard it's very ""smooth"" despite mountains and such, so I wonder if instead of a spot (very small circle) on some point behind it, it might cast an oval or other oblong shape of some size that, using lenses or computer reconstruction, might produce an image that is usable, and presumably even higher resolution (millions, billions, trillions, or even more times as detailed?).</p>

<p>If that's not possible, what are the issues? Does the atmosphere get in the way? If we could imagine a sufficiently circular disk roughly the size of Earth, about how far would the image processing receiver have to be from the disk opposite the studied object in order to capture the convergence of bent light? Would the gravity of the Earth affect the distance at all, due to gravitational lensing?</p>

"Why is Saturn invisible in this radar image of its rings?","<p>The image below is from <a href=""http://sun3.oulu.fi/~hsalo/HTML/nicholson2005_radar.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Radar imaging of Saturn’s rings</a> Nicholson, P. D. et al., Icarus 177 (2005) 32–62, doi:10.1016/j.icarus.2005.03.023 and discussed further in <a href=""https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/a/33028/7982"">this answer</a> to <em>How did Arecibo detect methane lakes on Titan, and image Saturn's rings?</em></p>

<p>I believe I can see Saturn's radar ""shadow"" blocking the furthest parts of the ring near the top of the images, but I can not see any reflections from Saturn itself.</p>

<p>The paper addresses a possible signal from the planet itself in Section 3.2. <em>Ring images</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Echoes at low Doppler shifts might be expected to arise either from near the subradar point on the planet itself</strong> or from ring material far outside the main rings. Our images show no evidence for any echo from the subradar point on Saturn, which would appear near ν = 0 and τ = −2RS/c = −402 ms. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The same answer describes radar measurements of Saturn's moon Titan as well.</p>

<p>It might be possible to make a hand-waving argument that Saturn itself is invisible because it's ""just gas"" but according to ESA's <a href=""https://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/Cassini-Huygens/Saturn_s_atmosphere"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Saturn's atmosphere</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The top visible cloud deck, made of ammonia clouds, is found at about 100 kilometres below the top of the troposhere (tropopause), where the temperature is about -250°C.</p>
  
  <p>The second cloud deck, made of ammonium hydrosulphide clouds, is found at about 170 kilometres below the tropopause, where the temperature is -70°C.</p>
  
  <p>The lowest cloud deck, made of water clouds, is found at about 130 kilometres below the tropopause, where the temperature is about 0°C (freezing point of water).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So I'm thinking that the various clouds of different colors and compositions will contain droplets or particles, rather than just be regions of different gas composition.</p>

"What type of planetary-mass object would Planet Nine be?","<p>Given that Planet Nine is hypothesized to be 10-20 times the mass of the Earth orbiting the sun some 200-2500 AU out, what kind of planetary-mass object would it be?</p>

<p>Even given that it has apparently ""influenced"" several Trans-Neptunian objects, since its orbit is so large and so slow (approximately 25,000 years) it would take an awful long time to clear out its own orbit (especially given that we do not know how long it has been in that orbit), so it seems like it would not qualify as an actual planet under the rules that re-classified Pluto.</p>

<p>Since it orbits our sun, it wouldn't be an exoplanet nor a rogue planet.  And it sure seems too big to be called a dwarf planet.</p>

"How does time ""add up"" for observers outside of and travelers inside of a Krasnikov tube?","<p>A ship travels 99% of c from Earth (leaving at Time A, say 2016) to Destination Star (arriving at Time B, say 2020, accounting for relativistic effects) to stretch the tube, leaves a buoy at Destination Star, then uses the tube's topology to return to Earth, effectively faster-than-light, moments after it left, according to how the Krasnikov tube is supposed to work (Time A plus a few minutes). Can the ship now return to Time B (2020) from ""Time A (2016) plus a few minutes"" using the tube just as quickly? If so, would its return to Time B mean ""Destination Star in the ship's year 2020, the moment when it arrived / first stretched the tube to this destination?"" And if so, would it mean returning to the system ""before"" the ship dropped the buoy?
My understanding of a Krasnikov tube is that it's a theoretical means for FTL travel that doesn't violate causality, because a ship traveling along the return path of a tube ""rolls back"" time to just moments before the ship originally left.</p>

<p>Now, I understand that there is a way to construct a return tube that would violate causality (<a href=""http://arxiv.org/pdf/gr-qc/9702049.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/pdf/gr-qc/9702049.pdf</a>), but let's assume for a moment there's some ""chronology protection"" in place that doesn't allow that to happen (the tube implodes when you try to do that), and that the question of the exotic matter needed to create such a tube isn't an issue for the ship's makers.
The questions I have then are:</p>

<p>A) Am I even thinking about this correctly? Where have I messed up?</p>

<p>B) I don't understand how a system of Krasnikov tubes, as some sources suggest, could be used to create an interstellar network for FTL travel. It seems to me that the traveler in the ship can never actually have an impact on his exit or return points, since he will always be returning to Time A (2016) moments after he left, or Time B (2020), the moment he arrives?</p>

"Why would discovering life on another planet be important/matter to us?","<p>I had a funny thought, and would like to pose it to you:</p>

<p>When I was a kid, reading any kind of astronomy or similar books would all say that there was no other life in the universe, and made it pretty clear that anyone thinking there could be was probably off his rocker. </p>

<p>Nowadays, it seems this has become a very important question for astronomers and other scientists, a new deep-seated belief that must now be proven. Some seem to think it would be the most important discovery of all time. </p>

<p>I'm wondering why?</p>

<p>My guess is, if we did 'discover' life on another planet, it'll make the news for a bit, and then the average person will go back to their every day life without much more thought about it. </p>

<p>For me, I would think this is great, only insofar as it means a possible new source of food (i.e., some delicious exotic cuisine assuming it's edible, and possibly even some place to go conquer and colonize if there was any profitability/money in doing so). </p>

<p>For some scientists, though, I get the sense it's more of an axe to grind with the long-dreary he-said she-said argument of science vs. religion. </p>

<p>Why do you think it would matter?</p>

<p>My question assumes any life discovered is probably not going to be very 'interesting' life, at least nothing we're going to have a conversation with.</p>

<p>Below is the example of the neutron star radius I'm trying to get:</p>

<p>I know that I'm using iron as the element and I should split it up and convert the protons to neutrons, but that would only increase the degeneracy pressure and result in an even bigger radius, if I'm not mistaken.</p>

<p>Number of electrons per atom: $26 \times \text{number of atoms}$</p>

<p>Total number of particles: $\text{number of atoms} + \text{number of electrons}$</p>

<p>Mass: $\text{atomic mass} \times \text{number of atoms} = 4.4400513610370694 \times 10^{30} \mathrm{\ kg} \approx 2.3M_☉$</p>

<p>Radius: $2,228,588 \mathrm{\ m}$</p>

<p>Temperature: $9.452 \times 10^{-7}° K$</p>

<p>Force of gravity: $\frac{GM^2}{r}$</p>

<p>Volume: $\frac{4\pi r^3}{3}$</p>

<p>Particle density: $\frac{\text{number of particles}}{\text{volume}}$</p>

<p>a: $\frac{4\sigma}{c}$</p>

<p>Radiation pressure: $\frac{a T^4}{3}$</p>

<p>Gas pressure: $\text{particle density} \times k_B T$</p>

<p>Electron degeneracy pressure: $\frac{\pi^3 \hbar^2} {15 M_e} \times \frac{3 \times \text{number of electrons}} {V \pi}^{\frac{5}{3}}$</p>

<p>Electron degeneracy pressure 2: $\frac{\pi^2 \hbar^2} {5 M_e \times M_h^{\frac{5}{3}}} \times \frac{3}{\pi}^{\frac{2}{3}} \times \frac{\frac{M}{V}}{1}^ {\frac{5}{3}}$</p>

<p>Neutron degeneracy pressure: $\frac{\pi^3 \hbar^2 }{15 M_e} \times \frac{3 \times \text{number of neutrons}}{V \pi}^{\frac{5}{3}}$     </p>

<p>Neutron degeneracy pressure 2: $\frac{3^{\frac{10}{3}} \hbar^2 }{ 15 \pi^{\frac{1}{3}} \times M_n^{\frac{8}{3}} \times r^5} \times \frac{M}{4}^{\frac{5} {3}}$</p>

"Is gravity a source of infinite energy at a cosmological scale","<p>As I understand it, gravity cannot be attenuated by any medium (in the way that EM radiation can be, for instance).</p>

<p>Does this, then, not make it a source (theoretically, I am not talking of practicalities) of infinite energy - if we assume the universe itself is infinite and looks the same everywhere (ie there are objects with mass everywhere)?</p>

"Problems with computing X,Y,Z positions of planets at a certain time in Unity3D (C#)","<p>I'm trying to create a little program in Unity3D that positions the planets in 3D space at a given time. I've followed this document: <a href=""http://stjarnhimlen.se/comp/ppcomp.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://stjarnhimlen.se/comp/ppcomp.html</a>.</p>

<p>Using the data from section 4 and the code from section 6 and 7 I should have the correct algorithm right? I did skip on the changes in the orbital attributes (eg + 4.70935E-5 * d) because I just need to have them move in a set orbit. I don;t really need them to change over time. For now I'm just increasing the mean anomaly over time without taking the period in account.</p>

<p>The problem is that the planets do not seem to get the correct offset to the ecliptic, and their movement is really weird: they speed up, then slow down and reverse in their paths. Here is a video of their movement: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHOBChFpan0"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHOBChFpan0</a></p>

<p>It looks like the eccentricity is correct on their ellipses and the distances to the sun are also correct, but the rest is just wrong. I'm not that great at math or astronomy to fully understand what's going on in this algorithm, but I'm hoping someone here might spot the error.</p>

"What good evidence exists for the 9th planet as spoken of by Caltech?","<p>I'm sure Caltech has answered this in some way, but I think it's a good question have on this site.</p>

<p><strong>What good evidence exists</strong> for the 9th planet as spoken of by Caltech?</p>

<p>As I see it, Caltech has apparently looked at the orbital parameters of many Trans-Neptunian-Objects (TNOs) and noticed that the lines between their perihilion and aphelion (i don't know what the technical term might be) all run more or less in the same direction. This is evidence that some large body has gravitationally ""synced"" these planets over millions of years.</p>

<p>Except <strong>that alone isn't good evidence.</strong> Here are two stats first:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Known TNOs: about 1,750 according to <a href=""http://www.minorplanetcenter.org/iau/lists/TNOs.html"">the Minor Planet Center's list</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Estimated existing Kuiper-Belt Objects: 120,000+ according to <a href=""http://www.britannica.com/place/Kuiper-belt"">Britannica</a>. (That number is only estimating objects of 100-km diameter or more, but that's fine for our purposes.) Note: 120,000 is only for KBOs. There are other TNO sets such as the oort cloud (and the scattered disc if you define it separately), so I expect the number to be much much bigger than 120,000.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Given that we've only measured about 1% or less of TNO orbits, how can we be sure we have a good random sample to say that a massive body must have aligned these orbits? In other words, all the other orbits might be randomly distributed, which would be compelling evidence that some giant body is <strong>not</strong> ""syncing"" orbits or else way more than 1% of them would be ""synced"".</p>

<p>If I recall my statistics class correctly, 1% is not good enough for a random sample. The border-line good enough area starts at 3%, but there's still a catch: <strong>It has to be a random sample.</strong> There are still observation-bias questions here because obviously we've only mostly discovered the ""nearby"" TNOs, because they are easier to discover when they're ""nearby"". That certainly would not be a random sample even if we had 3% of them.</p>

<p><strong>TLDR:</strong> There are at least 100,000 distant objects, of which less than 1% of them have some kind of aligned orbit as far as we know today. Is this actually good evidence that something has aligned them?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Another analogy that might help. You have a bag of 100 marbles. You reach in and pull out 5 from the top of the bag (notice I didn't say any random 5!). They turn out to be 4 red ones and 1 black one. Is this actually good evidence that about 80% <strong>of the whole bag</strong> is red?</p>

"Black hole's gravity","<p>Is gravity relative to volume, or size of an object? </p>

<p>Since a black hole is a massive star that collapses on its weight, how comes the same sun's mass, when it becomes a black hole, provides gravity that disallows even light to come out of the black hole? Before it was a black hole, the sun had a similar weight to the black hole, since no mass was lost or gained (and particles, including photons, come out of the star). Once it collapses under its weight, does the gravity become more in relation to the size of the object in question (reduction from the huge surface area of a massive star, to a compact/compressed, low surface area black hole), now that the same non-increased or subtracted gravity is bound to a much smaller surface? </p>

"Slow moving star like objects in the night sky","<p>So yesterday at about 2am I was watching the sky when I saw a small star like object moving very slowly across the sky. My initial thought was that it was a satellite due to the fact it was moving so slowly and wasn’t flashing. However  then I saw another one moving in the same direction about 10 minutes later. I had to keep letting my eyes adjust to the darkness to see it as it was so small but in total, I saw 4 of them moving in very similar directions, almost like they were following a path. There was about a 5-10min gap between each one and I could see it the entire time until it dipped over the tree line. I live in a very rural area so there was no light pollution or anything to interfere with the view. Now I know that around about now we are able to observe the Perseid meteor shower from the comet Swift-Tuttle but these object were very slow moving and I don’t really know how slow a meteor can move, but isn’t it strange that all of them were moving in the same direction? I also did see some normal meteors but as you’d expect, they only lasted for a second or under. Anyone have a clue what’s going on? Thanks.</p>

"Could space time curve from the vantage point of earth and out into the universe, and would d = 1 / P in that case give false estimates?","<p>The seventeenth century saw a revolution in astronomy. The invention of the telescope and the acknowledgement of the heliocentric system triggered a race amongst astronomers to measure the parallax of stars - the annual displacement of stellar positions due to Earth's motion around the Sun. In the late 1830s these measurements enabled astronomers to determine the distances to a handful of stars for the first time. From the 1850s onwards, the application of photography to astronomical observations transformed the practice of charting the sky, allowing the compilation of larger and larger catalogues of stellar positions and distances.</p>

<p>That robust marvel of trigonometry applied to observations of other stars, lets me look up into the sky for 6 months, measure the apparent motion, then divide 1 by that, and voila, the distance to the star. </p>

"Orbiting supermassive black hole or galactic center of mass?","<p>One of the ways they measure the (supposed?) supermassive black hole at the galactic center of the milky way is to measure those tens of stars right at the galactic center that are orbiting what appears to be nothing, but what is said to be a supermassive black hole.</p>

<p>My question is why there is a distinction between all other stars in the galaxy orbiting (for instance, our own sun) and those few right near the galactic center orbiting.  My point is, if you ask what our solar system orbits, an astronomer wouldn't say ""the supermassive black hole at the center,"" he would say ""the galactic center of mass.""  My assumption is that you couldn't even calculate the mass of the supermassive black hole by knowing our sun's mass and orbit - people would probably say we are too far out, or we are orbiting the galactic center of mass rather than the black hole, yadda yadda.</p>

<p>Questions:</p>

<p>1) Why the distinction?  How do we know that the stars right at the galactic center aren't also orbiting the galactic center of mass vs. the supermassive black hole?</p>

<p>2) What would happen if you magically removed the supermassive black hole in an instant?  Would the stars right at the center continue to orbit the center?  If so, how is that different than what they were originally doing?</p>

<p>Note that I know that center of mass of the galaxy and the supermassive black hole are two different things.  I also know that the center of mass of the galaxy is either superimposed on the supermassive black hole, or quite close to it.  I just want to know how or why some objects feel the center of mass of the galaxy and respond to it, while others feel the pull of the supermassive black hole and respond to it.  How far away do you have to be to be considered ""orbiting the center of mass"" rather than ""orbiting the supermassive black hole?""</p>

This is slightly at odds with the fact that most protoplanetary clouds and their derivative objects - planets, asteroids, comets and dust - will collapse to a fairly well-defined plane relatively early in a stellar system's evolution.</p>

"What is wrong with this measurement of the synodic period of Mercury?","<p>I'm measuring the synodic period of Mercury using Stellarium.

"Seconds of Arc and the Unaided Eye","<p>I've been presented with this problem:    </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Say that Jupiter, with its diameter of 142,000 km, was located where Mars now orbits.  What would be the angular size of (the newly-relocated) Jupiter during a close approach, when its distance would be 79,300,000 km?  Would we be able to see Jupiter as a round object with our unaided eye, or only as a point of light?      </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The angular size is easy enough to calculate given $ \frac{Angular \space Size}{206,000} = \frac{Linear \space Size}{Distance} $.<br>
So $\frac{Angular \space Size}{206,000} = \frac{142000}{79300000}$ meaning Angular Size = 369 seconds of arc.     </p>

<p>However, would the unaided eye be able to see this? Knowing that the eye can detect 1 minute of arc across, surely  it can detect 6.15? Any help appreciated, thanks!</p>

"Will intergalactic travel be impossible in roughly 15 billion years?","<p>Even if we (or aliens somewhere in the universe living at that time) somehow invent something that can go just short of the speed of light, will intergalactic travel still be impossible in roughly 15 billion years?  Another way to put it, will even the nearest galaxy be receding from us faster than the speed of light in roughly 15 billion years?  To me, that would seem to require dark energy to increase dramatically, but seems to be the conclusion after thinking on the following points (although the expansion of space itself probably alters this estimate significantly):</p>

<p>In some further thought on the premises I posed in this linked question, I came to the realization that the universe may be ""rapidly"" changing:
<a href=""https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/questions/24107/is-there-a-physical-limit-to-how-far-we-can-go"">Is there a physical limit to how far we can go?</a></p>

<p>Edit: This is different than that question in that I am focused now on the future state of our universe (when - the focus of this question) vs. the location (where - which was the focus of the prior question). </p>

<p>Known facts:</p>

<ul>
<li>There is a part of the universe, about 15 billion years away, that is receding beyond the speed of light, and hence we can never reach.</li>
<li>If we were to pick a direction, there are a finite number of galaxies between here and that 15 billion light year position, (and I therefore deduce at some point, we would not be able to reach the next galaxy.)</li>
<li>Space is fairly uniform, so similar conditions should be present on a large scale</li>
<li>It would take at least 15 billion years to reach that edge, not accounting for space expansion.</li>
</ul>

<p>My thought / question with the above in mind, does this mean that if we were to keep traveling, it is inevitable that we will eventually pass the last galaxy we can reach, and then all galaxies would be out of reach (except possibly the last one)?  Does this mean that in 15 billion years (then adjust for the expansion of space) that we won't even be able to reach the nearest galaxies, even if we find a way to travel at the speed of light?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In 1821, Alexis Bouvard published astronomical tables of the orbit of Neptune's neighbour Uranus.[22] Subsequent observations revealed substantial deviations from the tables, leading Bouvard to hypothesise that an unknown body was perturbing the orbit through gravitational interaction.[23] In 1843, John Couch Adams began work on the orbit of Uranus using the data he had. Via Cambridge Observatory director James Challis, he requested extra data from Sir George Airy, the Astronomer Royal, who supplied it in February 1844. Adams continued to work in 1845–46 and produced several different estimates of a new planet.</p>
  
  <p>In the 1840s, Urbain Le Verrier used Newtonian mechanics to predict the position of the then-undiscovered planet Neptune after analysing perturbations in the orbit of Uranus.[26] Subsequent observations of Neptune in the late 19th century led astronomers to speculate that Uranus's orbit was being disturbed by another planet besides Neptune.</p>

"Do gravitationally bound (e.g. orbiting) objects really resist the expansion of space?","<p>Thinking about the expansion of space, it is commonly explained that gravitationally bound objects (like galaxies and galaxy clusters) will not be affected by the expansion of space (dark energy).  I personally don't get why this would be, I would think galaxies, and things orbiting one another (e.g. solar systems) would be impacted.  If space doubled, the orbit distance should double.  I do get that things bound together gravitationally (perhaps a second definition / originally meant definition of ""gravitationally bound"") (e.g. planets, stars, asteroids, etc...) would not get ripped apart as space gradually doubles.  They would just pull themselves back together, and resist the very weak force of the expansion of space.  Is my understanding correct that things held together by gravity (like stars and planets) will hold together as space continues to expand, but things in orbit (e.g. stars orbiting within the galaxy, and planets orbiting stars) will be moved further out with the expansion of space?  It seems this could be fairly easily verified or refuted by seeing if ancient galaxies (those really far away) are denser than closer galaxies.  If they are denser, then this is strong support for the idea, and if not, then it largely refutes it.  </p>

<p>I have a feeling this might be why quasars stopped happening at some point, and are now just observable in great distances (where we are seeing them in the past).  My understanding is that a quasar is the supermassive black hole at the center of a galaxy feeding on large amounts of material.  Back to my main question though, does the expansion of space thin out galaxies / solar systems?</p>

"Change of orbit with change of mass?","<p>In the science fiction book 2010, monoliths increase the mass of Jupiter until it becomes a star.</p>

  <p>The Leonov crew flees Jupiter as a mysterious dark spot appears on
  Jupiter and begins to grow. HAL's telescope observations reveal that
  the ""Great Black Spot"" is, in fact, a vast population of monoliths,
  increasing at an exponential rate, which appear to be eating the
  planet. By acting as self-replicating machines, these monoliths
  increase Jupiter's density until the planet achieves nuclear fusion,
  becoming a small star.</p>

<p>Obviously fiction.  But my question is about orbits and the mass of orbiting bodies.  For planets, whose mass is negligible compared to their star, I understand one can ignore mass for purposes of calculating orbits.  </p>

<p>But if Jupiter were by scifi magic made as massive as a star, would its orbit remain the same regardless?  Or if it were made to stay on its same orbital path, would it have to move more quickly, completing its orbit of Sol in a shorter time?</p>

"What will New Horizons be able to say about a magnetic field at Pluto?","<p>Does NASA's New Horizons flyby probe to Pluto have instruments to measure Pluto's (or Charon's) magnetic field, if any?</p>

<p>I'm a bit confused by the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Horizons"" rel=""nofollow"">Wikipedia article</a> which says that New Horizons, during its flyby of Jupiter, on one hand:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Travelling through the planet's magnetosphere New Horizons collected
  valuable particle readings.[45] ""Bubbles"" of plasma which are believed
  to be formed from material ejected by the moon Io were noticed in the
  magnetotail.[47]</p>

<p>But then on the other hand:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An objective to measure any magnetic field of Pluto was dropped. A
  magnetometer instrument could not be implemented within a reasonable
  mass budget and schedule, and SWAP and PEPSSI could do an indirect job
  detecting some magnetic field around Pluto.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And how true is this story which I read or heard somewhere? That when New Horizons was being built and launched, no one really believed that Pluto could have a magnetic field. But since then planetary science has advanced and it is now plausible that it might have a magnetic field, because of tidal forces between Pluto and Charon which might make both objects somewhat fluid and possibly generating magnetic fields.</p>

<p><strong>BACKGROUD</strong></p>

<p><a href=""http://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/0407149v1.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Weisberg &amp; Taylor, 2004</a> present a graph showing the change in ""Cumulative Periastron Time Shift"" over a 30 year period.  Here is a later version of that graph
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/992mC.gif"" alt=""orbit period decay""></p>

<p>The graph indicates excellent agreement between the observed data points and the theoretical curve predicted by the General Theory of Relativity (GTR).  </p>

<p>The authors determined the theoretical change in orbit period <span class=""math-container"">$P$</span> over time (due to orbital energy loss from emission of gravitational waves) from a formula (Peters
&amp; Matthews (1963)) of the form:-
<span class=""math-container"">$$ dP/dt = K/P^{(5/3)}$$</span> 
where K is an (effectively constant) function of the masses of the two stars and the orbit eccentricity. For the Hulse-Taylor Binary, the period <span class=""math-container"">$P$</span> is approximately 7.75 hours and the value of K is approximately <span class=""math-container"">$(-6 * 10^{-5})$</span>, giving an approximate value of <span class=""math-container"">$$ dP/dt = 2.34 × 10^{−12} s/s. $$</span></p>

<p>If <span class=""math-container"">$dP/dt$</span> is constant then obviously we can determine the period <span class=""math-container"">$P$</span> at a future time by applying the formula
<span class=""math-container"">$$P_t = P_0 + t\,(dP/dt).$$</span>
As a rough initial estimate over one year the approximate change in period is: 365.25 x 24 x 3600 x -2.34 x 10^{-12} = 0.074 ms. (Wikipedia article indicates 0.076 ms.)</p>

<p>But <span class=""math-container"">$dP/dT$</span> is not constant because it depends on the value of <span class=""math-container"">$P$</span> which obviously changes.  So we would expect the period to decay over time and the rate of decay to increase with time. However, the change in P is currently so very small that over the period of 30 years the change in dP/dt (which is a function of <span class=""math-container"">$P$</span>) is extremely small also. (It is important to appreciate that the graph shown above does <strong>not</strong> plot <span class=""math-container"">$dP/dt$</span> against time).</p>

<p><strong>zibadawa timmy</strong> (thanks) provided the formula <span class=""math-container"">$P=(8/3 \int K dt)^{3/8}$</span> giving:- </p>

<p><span class=""math-container"">$$
P_t = \left( \frac{8}{3} (Kt+C)\right)^{3/8} \qquad \mathrm{with}\qquad C=\frac{3}{8} P_o^{8/3}
$$</span></p>

<p>hence</p>

<p><span class=""math-container"">$$
P_t = 
 \left( \frac{8}{3} Kt+ P_o^{8/3})\right)^{3/8} 
=
 \left(  \frac{-1.6\,t}{10^4}+ P_o^{8/3}\right)^{3/8} 
=
 \left(  \frac{-1.6\,t}{10^4}+ 27900^{8/3}\right)^{3/8} 
$$</span>
for 1 year , t = 31,557,600 s., so -1.6 t/10^4 = -5,049.12 = c. 5e3</p>

<p>for 10 years t = 310,557,600 s., so -1.6 t/10^4 = -50,491.2 = c. 5e4</p>

<p>while 27900^{8/3} = 716,051,966,959.181 = c. 7e11.</p>

<p>So 
<span class=""math-container"">$$
P_{1 year} = (-5049.12 + 716,051,966,959.181)^{3/8} = 27,899.999 926 s,\qquad deltaP_{1 year} = -0.0000738 s.
$$</span>
<span class=""math-container"">$$
P_{10 years} = (-50491.2 + 716,051,966,959.181)^{3/8} =  27,899.999 262 s,\qquad deltaP_{10 years} = -0.000738 s.
$$</span>
These <span class=""math-container"">$deltaP$</span> values indicate that the value of <span class=""math-container"">$dP/dt$</span> is effectively constant ($=-0.000 073 8 s/s) over 10years.</p>

<p><strong>QUESTION 1 - What is plotted on the graph? (<span class=""math-container"">$\equiv$</span> What is Cumulative Perihelion Time Shift?) (ANSWERED).</strong> </p>

<p>Initially I was confused about what the Weisberg &amp; Taylor graph was actually plotting.  The 2004 paper has ""The observed and theoretical decays are compared graphically in Figure 1"".  The wikipedia article labels the y-axis ""Cumulative Period Shift"" but the caption reads ""observed change in the epoch of periastron with date"".</p>

<p>An earlier <a href=""http://www.nature.com/scientificamerican/journal/v245/n4/pdf/scientificamerican1081-74.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">1981 Scientific American article</a> indicates that
the vertical axis of the graph indicates the difference (round data points) between (A) the calculated epoch of a periastron event in a hypothetical ""steady"" system whose orbital period remains constant and (B) the observed epoch of the corresponding actual periastron event in the ""decaying""-period system. Also shown is the continuous curve showing the difference between (A) steady system periastron epochs and (C) theoretical predictions of decayed periastron epochs.   The periastron's of the actual and hypothetical orbits are synchronized at <span class=""math-container"">$t=0$</span> (in late 1974).</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>QUESTION 2 - How are the theoretical values of CPTS Calculated? (ANSWERED).</strong></p>

<p>Several (similar) methods have now been identified.</p>

<p>Method 1 The method(s) used by Weisberg &amp; Taylor to calculate theoretical values of CPTS have not been identified. These following methods seem reasonable candidates, based on the agreement with their results.</p>

<p>Method 2 (see Stan Liou's answer)
<strong>Stan Liou</strong> has provided a formula <span class=""math-container"">$\Delta t = 0.5(\dot P/P_0)t^2$</span> that produces values which closely match the Weisberg &amp; Taylor graph.  </p>

<p>Method 3 (see my answer Method 3)
I have derived a formula identical to Stan Liou's but derived using phase instead of mean anomaly.  Another formula is derived from the same trunk expressing <span class=""math-container"">$\Delta t$</span> in terms of <span class=""math-container"">$\dot P, P and N$</span> <span class=""math-container"">$\Delta t = -0.5 P_o \dot P N^2$</span>.</p>

<p>Method 4 (see my answer Method 4)
I have derived a formula derived using a coarsely approximated  binomial series which gives similar results 
<span class=""math-container"">$ \Delta t_{N} = P_0{\dot P} \frac{N^2+N}{2}  $</span>.  </p>

<p>Method 5 (not shown)
A finely approximated series expansion approach has been assessed. For the given binary system it produces a formula that is effectively indistinguishable from that of the other methods for the given time range.</p>

"SPICE Alt Az example","<p><strong>Original question below, but my question is now about how can I supply lat/lon coordinates for other locations other than the one in the example below?</strong></p>

<p>It is possible to use NASA's <a href=""https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">SPICE</a> toolkit to produce Alt/Az coordinates?  I haven't been able to find any examples.</p>

<p><strong>Update:2</strong>
The code below doesn't appear to be along the right lines.  I've posted an answer with the ""most"" correct code I could come up with.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>I think I partly figured it out.  Apparently most people call it Elevation and Azimuth, not AltAz, which is why I couldn't find anything.  I found a <a href=""https://spiceypy.readthedocs.io/en/master/binary_pck.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">SpiceyPy example</a> which generates the Az, El for DSS-13.  <strong>But I'm at a loss as to how to specify the Lat,Lon for general locations.</strong>  Looking through the kernel file, the closest thing I see that could be a lat/lon for DSS-13 are the ""TOPO_ANGLES"" which are -243.2055404763616,-54.7528357325366, which is a pretty odd format if its supposed to be lat,lon.  I was unable to find the real lat/lon for DSS-13, but I was able to find it for DSS-14 which appears in the same file (FYI those coords are 116.89W, 35.426666666666N).  I verified the results with Horizons and they match exactly.  </p>

<p>Below I provide a stripped down version of the example to only print out the el/az coordinates.  It requires a file ""erotat.tm"" which I also provide below.  I was able to filed all of the required kernel files by searching for the name (apparently some of them are quite old).

<blockquote>
  <p>The orbit of 55P/Tempel–Tuttle intersects that of Earth near exactly,
  hence streams of material ejected from the comet during perihelion
  passes do not have to spread out over time to encounter Earth. This
  coincidence means that streams from the comet at perihelion are still
  dense when they encounter Earth, resulting in the 33 year cycle of
  Leonid meteor storms. For example, in November 2009, the earth passed
  through meteors left behind mainly from the 1466 and 1533 orbit.</p>

This was based on texts in <a href=""http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=V4_s91-Vun4C&amp;pg=PA482&amp;lpg=PA482&amp;dq=we+recall+from+section+7.6.1&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=RyU1Adp8h7&amp;sig=qQ5_KyjoDhaSaOadgP8zyy8ubIc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Hlc-VJDJK9TzaoHlgKgL&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=we%20recall%20from%20section%207.6.1&amp;f=false"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Walter 2008</a> and <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0201657023"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Goldstein et al 2001</a>.</p>

<p>Walter derived an approximate relationship assuming a circular orbit.  Goldstein focussed on deriving an orbit-average expression for perihelion precession.</p>

<p>On re-examining these texts it seems to me that GTR (General Theory of Relativity) provides more than just an orbit-averaged approximation.  Rather it provides a phase-specific formula for total acceleration (in Scwharzschild space-time).</p>

<p>The equation of motion for a Newtonian orbit is
$$u''_\theta + u_\theta =\frac{\mu}{h^2}$$
where $u_\theta = 1/r_\theta$ and $u'_\theta =$ d$(u_\theta)/$d$\theta$ and $h$ is specific angular momentum which is constant, $\mu = GM$ the gravitational parameter, $G$ is Newton's Universal gravitational constant, $M$ is mass of the star, $r$ is distance from star to planet, $\theta$ is the True anomaly.</p>

<p>Using $h^2 = Vt_\theta^2 \,r_\theta^2$ where $Vt$ is the instantaneous transverse component of velocity (in vector terms = full velocity minus radial velocity) we can  obtain
$$u''_\theta + u_\theta = \frac{1}{Vt_\theta^2} \left( \frac{\mu}{r_\theta^2} \right)$$ where the term in brackets is the Newtonian acceleration.</p>

<p>Walter presents the following equation for a GTR orbit (Schwarzschild model)</p>

<p>$$u''_\theta + u_\theta =\frac{\mu}{h^2} + \frac{3\mu}{c^2}\,u_\theta^2$$ </p>

<p>Now, using $h^2 = Vt_\theta^2 \,r_\theta^2$ and $u_\theta^2 = 1/r_\theta^2$ we get</p>

<p>$$u''_\theta + u_\theta 
=\frac{\mu}{Vt_\theta^2 \,r_\theta^2} + \frac{3\mu}{c^2 \,r_\theta^2}
=\frac{1}{Vt_\theta^2 } 
\left( \frac{\mu}{r_\theta^2} \,+ \frac{\mu}{r_\theta^2} \,\frac{3\,Vt_\theta^2}{c^2 } \right)$$ 
where the terms in brackets are the Newtonian acceleration and the extra acceleration according to GTR.  And so the ratio of Newtonian acceleration to GTR-specific acceleration, at any angle $\theta$ is 
$$1 \, \mathrm{to} \, \frac {3 Vt_\theta^2}{c^2}$$.
Goldstein emphasises that the GR acceleration does not indicate a velocity-dependence, so an alternative, more palatable, distance-dependent form of the ratio of accelerations, at any angle $\theta$, would be:-
$$1 \, \mathrm{to} \, \frac {3 h^2}{c^2 \, r_\theta^2} \equiv 
1 \, \mathrm{to} \, \frac {3 GM.P}{c^2 \, r_\theta^2}
$$
where $h$ (specific angular momentum) and $P$ (semi-latus rectum) are the values for the orbit of the particular subject planet. </p>

<p>And so (ignoring other massive perturbing bodies) the magnitude of the total instantaneous radial force on the planet (of mass $m$) towards the Sun is given by:-
$$ \mathrm{F/m} \,=  \, \frac {GM}{r_\theta^2} + \frac {3 GM.GM.P}{c^2 \, r_\theta^4}
$$</p>

<p>N.B. The GTR/Schwarzschild equations relate to proper time and Schwarzschild radial distance, not their Newtonian equivalents so strictly the ratio of accelerations is still an approximation.</p>

<p>Is this analysis valid, or have I missed something?</p>

<h2>Update</h2>

<p>I have accepted Stan Liou's answer as being very helpful in (a) providing a derivation from GTR/Schwarzschild of the formulae presented by Walter and Goldstein et al. and (b) indicating the imperfect correspondence between GTR terms/concepts and Newtonian terms/concepts.</p>

<p>My understanding is as follows. In a Newtonian central-force elliptical-orbit model the addition of an extra centre-directed acceleration ($dV/dt$), which varies through the orbit as $(+3 V_t^2/c^2\,\equiv \, +3 h^2/r^2c^2)$ times the co-temporal standard Newtonian centre-directed gravitational acceleration, can be shown (by first order perturbation analysis or numerical modelling) to produce apsidal precession at a rate (radians per orbit) defined by a Newtonian formula $$\epsilon = 24 \pi^3 \frac{a^2}{T^2 c^2(1-e^2)}$$ .  This formula is well-known (see for example <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apsidal_precession"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikipedia Apsidal precession</a>). According to, but not clearly referenced by, <a href=""http://www.mathpages.com/home/kmath527/kmath527.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this article</a>, the formula (or an algebraic equivalent using other terms) was well known c. 1895 (i.e. <em>before</em> the publications of Gerber 1898 and Einstein 1915).  The formula predicts very well the long-term values of apsidal precession determined using Newtonian models from observations of solar planets. </p>

<p>Various writers (<a href=""http://www.gsjournal.net/old/eeuro/vankov.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Einstein</a>, Goldstein, Walter, presumably many others) present mathematical arguments indicating how an identical formula can be derived from Einstein's GTR.  The presented arguments may involve approximations (e.g. Walter's use of near-circular orbits, Goldstein's use of orbit-averaged precession) and non-mathematical ""correspondences"" between the concepts/terms of the GTR model and the concepts/terms of the Newtonian model.</p>

"How does the Earth move in the sky as seen from the Moon?","<p>I just want to be sure I am visualizing this correctly, because it seems odd. The Moon is tidally locked to the Earth but there are wobbles to its motion due to libration. So from a point on the surface of the near side of the Moon, the Earth would always be near the same place in the sky? It would describe a small circle or a side-to-side wobble over the course of a month, but never move far from that point?</p>

<p>That would seem very strange, like it was a gigantic stage prop or something. We are so conditioned that everything rises and sets (except for a few stars near the poles). </p>

"Searches for dipole form of anisotropies (on luminosity distances) in the universe with type Ia supernovae","<p>There are many articles like this one <a href=""https://arxiv.org/pdf/1504.03428.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Testing the isotropy of the Universe by using the JLA compilation of type-Ia supernovae</a> (PDF, arxiv.org) trying to search for a dipole effect in cosmology with type Ia supernovae (used as standard candles). The idea of this kind of search is to do a test of the cosmological principle on a phenomenological approach independantly of some given models (e.g. Tolman-Bondi anistropic model). </p>

<p>They consider a dipole effect on the distance modulus <span class=""math-container"">$ \mu $</span>: <span class=""math-container"">$$ \mu \leftarrow \mu \times \left(1+A_D (\hat{\textbf{n}}\cdot \hat{\textbf{p}})\right)$$</span> where <span class=""math-container"">$\hat{\textbf{n}}$</span> is unitary vector pointing in the direction <span class=""math-container"">$(l,b)$</span> of the dipole with an amplitude of <span class=""math-container"">$A_D$</span> and <span class=""math-container"">$\hat{\textbf{p}}$</span> points the direction of each Type Ia supernova.
The distance modulus is related to luminosity distance <span class=""math-container"">$d_l$</span> as <span class=""math-container"">$ \mu =5 \log \left(\frac{d_l}{10 pc}\right)$</span>.</p>

<p>There is something that bothers me a bit:</p>

<p>Our peculiar velocity to the universe is usually estimated with the CMB dipole measuments, right? And so the reshifts of SNIa are computed in the CMB frame using this correction. </p>

<p>So, supposing we have that kind of cosmological ansisotropy, how it is not mistakenly corrected with the dipole anisotropy of the CMB (and could also be why all searches of this kind give us an amplitude of anisotropy compatible to 0)?</p>

<p>I mean, the CMB dipole implies a velocity of <span class=""math-container"">$369.5\pm3.0$</span> km/s in the direction of <span class=""math-container"">$l=264.4^{\circ}\pm0.3^{\circ}$</span> and <span class=""math-container"">$b= 48.4^{\circ}\pm0,5^{\circ}$</span> according to <a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1993ApJ...419....1K"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">COBE measurments</a>. But what if the CMB dipole is not just due to our peculiar velocity but also to an unknown ""cosmological effect""?

"Why would a tidally-locked rocky planet have a first-order spherical harmonic surface temperature distribution?","<p>The new Letter to Nature <a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1497-4"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Absence of a thick atmosphere on the terrestrial exoplanet LHS 3844b</a> (also <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.06834"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ArXiv</a>) analyzes the thermal infrared light curve from the system (about 4.5 to 5.5 um). The planet is assumed to be tidally locked, so lack of asymmetry in the curve is cited as evidence that there is not thermal inertia due to a thick atmosphere, which is what one would expect for this planet.</p>

<p>In the beginning of the paper the authors say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We fit the extracted light curve with a simultaneous model of the astrophysical signal and the instrument behavior. The astrophysical signal consisted of a transit model <strong>and a first-degree spherical harmonics temperature map to represent the planet’s thermal phase variation.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>and later:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In addition to the spherical harmonics model, we also tested a sinusoid model, which has been commonly used to fit other phase curve data. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am thinking that the incident flux at a given point on the tidally-locked planet would be </p>

<p><span class=""math-container"">$$I \sim \max (0, \cos(\theta))$$</span></p>

<p>where <span class=""math-container"">$\theta$</span> is the static zenith angle at a given point, and so the temperature would be something like</p>

"Humans surviving in space","<p>To my (admittedly limited) understanding a human being in outer space wouldn't last very long, mainly due to three factors:</p>

<li>the extreme cold</li>
<li>the intense radiation</li>

<p>So if my understanding is correct, humans would die within seconds (if anyone could put an approximate number on this that would be great!).</p>

<p>What I want to know is that if a human being was exposed to space for half that time, would they suffer lasting and life threatening after effects?</p>

<p>In other words, is there any amount of exposure to space that wouldn't result in your imminent or eventual death?</p>

<p>Would exposure of just a hand kill you, or would you just lose that hand?</p>

"Is there a way to calculate how much damage black hole merger shockwaves inflict on nearby objects?","<p>Black hole mergers lose respective rotational energy during a merger. I understand that the energy 'emitted' is scattered as gravitational 'energy' that can henceforth be detected by gravitational detectors billions of light years away. I understand that the amount of shockwave energy in stellar mass black hole mergers can be equivalent to the mass of a star such as the sun. So if two rapidly rotating SMBHs on the scale of SagA* merge, the emergy emitted is in the range of hundred thousands of solar masses...?</p>

"What are realistic and unrealistic values for the high energy gamma ray spectral indices of pulsar wind nebulae?","<p>This summer, I was working on a project fitting very high energy gamma ray spectra of the Crab Nebula, a pulsar wind nebula. At energies about <span class=""math-container"">$\sim$</span>1 TeV, a simple power law suffices, i.e. <span class=""math-container"">$\phi(E)\propto E^{\alpha}$</span>. Most power law models of the Crab find a spectral index of <span class=""math-container"">$\alpha\simeq-2.47$</span> (e.g. <a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1998ApJ...503..744H"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Hillas 1998</a>, <span class=""math-container"">$\alpha=-2.49\pm0.06$</span>). Using a normal analysis method on one dataset, I found <span class=""math-container"">$\alpha=-2.469\pm0.02248$</span>, which matches the literature values quite well.</p>

<p>Using the modified analysis method I was testing, however, I found <span class=""math-container"">$\alpha=-2.316\pm0.02040$</span>. We believe that method is a poor choice because I showed the calculated flux values were incompatible with previous observations. The spectral index also cast doubts on its viability. However, I was wondering if, for a random pulsar wind nebula, a slightly harder spectral index like <span class=""math-container"">$\alpha=-2.316$</span> is unphysical, or reasonable.</p>

<p>Therefore, I'm wondering: What is the distribution of spectral indices for power-law models of very high energy spectra of pulsar wind nebulae? Do we have a large enough population of pulsar wind nebulae that we can determine what a typical value for <span class=""math-container"">$\alpha$</span> is, and what range we would expect a spectral index to fall into? In other words, could if I had obtained a certain value for <span class=""math-container"">$\alpha$</span>, what value would it need to have for me to reject the result as unphysical?</p>

"Estimates for ""undetectable"" planets in extra-solar systems","<p>As far as I've been able to determine, it appears there are some significant  limitations on our ability to detect exo-planets that are below certain sizes or beyond certain distances from their stars.  </p>

<p>It seems that Uranus and Neptune are about as small as we can detect unless the planet is relatively close to its star, and Earth is near the lower size limit we can detect, regardless of proximity to the star.   </p>

<p>In other words, our bias toward detecting large planets, and planets close to their stars, means I have been able to find reasonably good data regarding how many of those kinds of planets are generally present in a system.  But since we can't seem to tell (by direct observation) how many small planets are generally present in a system, or how many planets are present that are just too far from their star for us to detect, I'm struggling to find data regarding how many plants of those types are common in planetary systems.  </p>

<p>For example: our system has 8 planets, 4 rocky, 2 gas giants, 2 ice giants.  But chances are that if we were observing (with current technology) our own Solar system from some other solar system, we'd probably only see 2 to 6 of them.  We'd almost certainly see Jupiter and Saturn, and we'd almost certainly NOT see Mercury or Mars (they're just too small), Venus and Earth ""might be"" close enough to the sun for us to see them even though they are on the small end of what we can detect, and Uranus and Neptune also ""might be"" detectable, even though they are small-ish for their distance from the sun.  </p>

<p>My specific question:  <strong>How many planets are in a 'normal' or 'average' planetary system, according to humanity's best scientific theories available so far?</strong>(beyond what we can simply detect.)  In other words, where can I find <strong>reasonable scientific research data sets, models, estimates, theories, evidence, etc.</strong>, that describe the likelihood of ""undetectable"" (or very hard to detect) planets being present in a planetary system?</p>

"How much iron does a star fuse before going supernova?","<p>I understand stars fuse atoms into heavier and heavier elements. When the star starts to fuse iron, the amount of energy released is less than the amount of energy it to takes to fuse the atoms. This creates an energy deficiency and the core is unable to maintain its outward pressure against gravity's inward collapse. The star collapses, rebounds against electron degeneracy pressure (I believe?) and goes BOOM. But how much iron is actually fused? And, for how long is the star fusing iron before the collapse? </p>

<p>Also, as a little bonus, I read somewhere recently that the presence of nickel is possible prior to going supernova. I can't find where though. Was that person wrong? </p>

"Why does ""longitude by chronometer"" require first calculating latitude?","<p>I'm studying the history of longitude and Greenwich Time, and I'm currently confused about the ""longitude by chronometer"" technique.</p>

<p>Conceptually, the method seems extremely simple.  With a chronometer (ie. an accurate clock) set to the time of your home port, compare to your local time.  Multiply the difference by <span class=""math-container"">$\frac{15°}{hour}$</span> and that will give you the degrees of longitude you have traveled.</p>

<p>According to Derek Howse's <em>Greenwich Time and the Longitude</em> and Dava Sobel's <em>Longitude</em>, this method was first published by Gemma Frisius in 1530, then described again by Richard Eden in 1555.  Both of these authors say that you must first find your latitude.  Here is Frisius in 1530 (emphasis mine):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We must wait until the hand of our clock exactly touches the point of an hour and at the same moment by means of an astrolabe or by means of our globe, we must find out the time of the place at which we now find ourselves.  If this time agrees to the minute with the time shown on our watch, it is certain that we are still on the same meridian or in the same longitude, and our journey has been made towards the south.  But if it differs by one hour or by a number of minutes, then these should be turned into degrees, or minutes of degrees, by the method I set out in the previous chapter, and in this way the longitude is discovered.  In this way I would be able to find the longitude of places, even if I was dragged off unawares across a thousand miles, and even though the distance of my journey was unknown. <strong>But then first of all, as always, the latitude must be learnt.  I have already explained this before and also that it can be found out by various methods of finding out the tirne.</strong></p>

<p>Here is <a href=""https://books.google.com/books?id=VHoKAQAAIAAJ&amp;lpg=PA390&amp;ots=DzQNZhRtmk&amp;dq=and%20so%20shall%20the%20longitude%20bee%20founde.%20And%20by%20this%20arte%20can%20I%20fynde%20the%20longitude%20of%20regions&amp;pg=PA390#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Eden in 1555</a>:</p>

<pre><code>And so shall the longitude bee found.  And by

        sand myles owt of my attempt-

</code></pre>

<p>I can't figure out why knowing the latitude would be necessary for calculating longitude by chronometer, unless you need it to calculate the local time.  But it seems to be well established that local time can be easily calculated with a noon sighting of the Sun, corrected for the equation of time.  This method is described <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitude_by_chronometer#Noon_sight_for_Longitude"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>.</p>

<p>Most of the Wikipedia page for <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitude_by_chronometer"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Longitude by Chronometer</a> seems to describe a more complicated method that involves finding the intersection of a position line with an assumed latitude.  It also describes solving the navigational triangle.  I'm having trouble following the method described there.  I can't tell whether this is the same method described by Frisius or something else entirely.</p>

<p>So overall my questions are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Why do Frisius and Eden say that you need to calculate latitude before you can do longitude by chronometer?  Is it just a step in calculating the local time?</li>
<li>What is the method described in the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitude_by_chronometer"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">""Longitude by Chronometer"" Wikipedia page</a>, and the navigational triangle stuff?  How does it work, and what benefit does it have over the simple <span class=""math-container"">$(t_{home} - t_{local})\frac{15°}{hour}$</span> method?</li>

"How is the maximum density in a circumstellar disk determined?","<p>I'm working with some equations to model the evolution of a circumstellar disk. One of the equations is
$$\rho(r)=Ce^{-\frac{(r-r_{peak})^2}{2 \sigma ^2}}$$
where $\rho$ is density, $r$ is the distance from the center, $C$ is a constant, $\sigma$ is one standard deviation, and $r_{peak}$ is the radius at which the density is at a maximum.</p>

<p>If the function was of the form
$$\rho(r)=Ce^{f(r)}$$
where $f(r)$ is a function of $r$, I could find the maximum easily by finding
$$\rho'(r)=Cf'(r)e^{f(r)}=0$$
and solving for $r$. However, this appears to be impossible in the current case because $\rho(r)_{peak}$ is already in the equation, at $r_{peak}$.</p>

<p>How is $r_{peak}$ determined in a given scenario? Is it determined experimentally?</p>

"Where did this famous Planetary Precession Formula come from?","<p>The following equation (which I shall term the Planetary Precession Formula, PPF for short) famously appeared in a 1915  <a href=""http://www.gsjournal.net/old/eeuro/vankov.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">publication</a> by Einstein where he indicated how it could be derived from his General Theory of Relativity (GTR).</p>

<p>$$\epsilon = \frac{24 \, \pi^3a^2}{c^2 T^2(1-e^2)}$$</p>

<p>where $\epsilon$ is the (anomalous, non-Newtonian) angular precession per orbit, $a$ is the orbit semi-major axis, $c$ is the speed of light, $T$ is the orbital period, $e$ is the orbit ellipticity.</p>

<p>The PPF formula accurately predicts the (anomalous, non-Newtonian) precession of Mercury and other Solar planets.</p>

<p>The formula was known in scientific circles well before 1915.  For example Gerber (1898) derived it from his own (widely-derided) model of gravity.  In the internet article <a href=""http://www.mathpages.com/home/kmath527/kmath527.htm"" rel=""noreferrer"">Gerber's Gravity</a> it is written that </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It became a fairly popular activity in the 1890s for physicists to propose various gravitational potentials based on finite propagation speed in order to account for some or all of Mercury's orbital precession.  Oppenheim published a review of these proposals in 1895.  The typical result of such proposals is a predicted non-Newtonian advance of orbital perihelia per revolution of... ></p>
</blockquote>

<p>$$k\,\frac {\pi\,m}{L \,c^2} =  k \frac{4 \, \pi^3a^2}{c^2 T^2(1-e^2)}.$$</p>

<p>where $L = a(1 - e^2)$  is the semi-latus rectum of an ellipse, $m$ is a function of the angular speed $\omega$ of an orbiting planet: $m = a^3 \omega^2$ with $\omega = 2\pi/T$ and $k$ is a constant which might be derived from theory.</p>

<p>Clearly with $k = 6$ we get the PPF formula given above. </p>

<p>I wish to know where the $k\pi m/Lc^2$ expression comes from. From the article it would appear to come from the 28-page review paper by Oppenheim, 1895 which is scanned <a href=""http://daten.digitale-sammlungen.de/~db/0007/bsb00075099/images/index.html?id=00075099&amp;fip=193.174.98.30&amp;no=&amp;seite=1"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a>. I have been through the scans of this paper but without finding that equation explicitly (the paper is in German which I know very poorly, Google Translate helps a bit but leaves a lot of ambiguity). It might be that the anonymous author of the article extracted the expression from a review of Oppenheim's paper or even the original (French &amp; German) papers themselves, but he is not contactable.  Maybe someone here is familiar with this era of astrophysical history and can point me in the right direction?</p>

"Can the patterns in the CMB be detected by off-the-shelf antennas/sensors?","<p>I recently wrote a paper (will attach soon if feasible) for an astronomy class that analyzed the usefulness of the Cosmic Microwave Background as a static reference for attitude determination.

There is some variation over time, but it’s on the order of 1000+ years.</p>

<p>I was able to apply common computer vision algorithms to match randomly rotated rendered images of the CMB to their respective RA, Dec, Roll coordinates. These (completely unoptimized) algorithms tended to require a field of view of (Will find this in a moment) and a resolution of (Will find this in a moment) to be reasonably accurate.</p>

<p>One of my main assumptions is that it would be feasible to make a detector with sufficient resolution and signal-to-noise to be able to spot the CMB variation patterns within a few hours of observation.

"Could population III stars develop directly into population I stars?","<p>Hundreds of millions of years after the Big Bang, the very first stars began to form consisting of mostly hydrogen, a bit of helium, and maybe some lithium. These stars lacked any ""metals"" (elements heavier than helium) and are categorized as Population III stars. We have yet to observe any of these Pop III stars, and observation remains unlikely. The reason for this is because Pop III stars are thought to have been incredibly massive, so they died out so long ago that we can no longer see their light. Pop I stars are metal-rich; their metallicity is 1/10 to 3 times that of our Sun's. In my research, everyone seems to agree that that the first generation of stars had no metal, second generation stars had very little, and third generation stars have some metal.But, no one ever addresses the possibilities. So, is it possible that some Pop III stars were so massive that they were able to skip Pop II and go straight to Pop I? Maybe if several are close by when they go supernova?   </p>

<p>Would the outer-most debris cool too quickly and block a lot of the visibility?</p>

<p>My guess is, events like this would be too infrequent to happen within our view, so we shouldn't expect to observe it until we have much better telescopes, but other events weren't expected to be observed, like the gravitational waves from two colliding black holes and that was detected.  </p>

<p>We have already sent probes towards the border of the Solar system. And even landed human beings on another celestial body and brought them home alive and well. If we extrapolate the 50 years of space travel, the 100 years of electronics (radio), the 400 years of physical science, to just a fraction of the biological age of humankind into the future (like a few thousands of years), interstellar travel is not out of the question for us or at least our artefacts. So I imagine two possible alternatives:</p>

<p>1) The Milky Way is cluttered by lots of space travelling civilizations like us and our future. Once one of them/us gets going, they'll soon be everywhere. The Sun orbits the Milky Way every 250 million years, about 2% of the age of the galaxy. Going to the nearest stars is enough to soon be everywhere. But if they are everywhere since almost always, they should be here, we should be their seed.</p>

<p>2) We are the only space travelling civilization in the entire galaxy, ever. But then what makes us unique? We consist of the most common elements and volatiles of the universe and our planet and star and galactic location all seem to be very typical. There's no known trace of any uniqueness here. Whatever could it be?</p>

"Hulse-Taylor binary pulsar - what is the rate of mass/energy loss from the source?","<p>Following on from <a href=""https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/questions/6051/how-did-the-hulse-taylor-pulsar-provide-confirming-evidence-of-general-relativit"">an earlier question</a> about the very interesting <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulse%E2%80%93Taylor_binary"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Hulse-Taylor binary pulsar</a>.  The high-frequency (radio) beam from the spinning pulsar sweeps across Earth about 17 times per second.  The total power of the gravitational radiation (waves) emitted by the binary system is calculated from GTR to be $7.35 × 10^{24}$ watts at present (declining as the orbital period and radius diminish).</p>

<p><a href=""http://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/0407149v1.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Weisberg &amp; Taylor, 2004</a> report that the beam has ""a flux density of about 1 mJy at 1400 MHz.""  (mJy = milliJansky, thanks Stan Liou). Assuming that this flux is uniform across a conical beam with cross-sectional radius 5 arc degrees  and assuming that the source is 21,000 light years from Earth and has mass = 1.44 Solar Masses:-  How much energy is emitted (per second) from the source in the beam? Also (if it is possible to estimate a reasonable range of values) what might be the rate of steady mass loss from such a source?  </p>

"How do astronomers know if a planet is orbiting a star, or it's simply another star in the background?","<p>For example, if astronomers photograph a ""planet"", which is in close proximity to a given star, then this ""planet"", could actually just be another ""star"" in the background, many light years away.</p>

<p>It might just be in the photograph by chance.</p>

<p>How can astronomers determine if this is, in fact, a planet orbiting that star or just another star many light years away?</p>

<hr>

<p>For example, a common method to find planets orbiting stars is the transit method. ie, we can observe how the star appears to slowly decrease brightness, then increase back to normal again. This basically tells astronomers that this must be a planet.</p>

<p>But how do astronomers know that this isn't just the ""front star"" transitting a star ""in the background""?</p>

"Does blackhole merging break their event horizon segregation?","<p>So far as I know, if we have 2 blackholes A and B, both having their own event horizons, then what's inside the event horizon of A remains completely unknown to us, and same for what's inside the event horizon of B.</p>

<p>Now, suppose A and B coalesce (merge). So we now have a single blackhole C, with its own new event horizon.</p>

<p>This would mean that what was inside the event horizon of A now ""knows"" what is inside the event horizon of B.  Would this mean that all event horizons of all blackholes are actually ""linkable"" together since they might all merge at some point?</p>

<hr>

<p>Edit: After watching the suggested video, I can try rewording the question:</p>

<p>Suppose Alice and Bob are outside blackholes A and B.</p>

<p>Alice jumps into blackhole A, and Bob jumps into blackhole B.</p>

<p>Bob never sees Alice crossing the event horizon (according to the video below; it's the same Bob than in the video: he cannot see Alice crossing the event horizon until ""t=infinity""), but Bob crosses the event horizon of blackhole B (not part of the video).</p>

<p>Let's say that the two blackholes are also falling to one another so let's say they are ""now"" (that concept is probably misplaced) merging. So the two event horizons now become one.</p>

<p>Are Alice and Bob reunited despite Bob never seeing Alice cross the event horizon of A? How would such situation (2 blackholes) be drawn using the diagram in the video in answer below?</p>

"Is the eventual heat death of the universe due to the expansion of the universe?","<p>I am reading about the accelerating expansion of the universe and something struck me. The observation that things further away were accelerating away faster and that early observations made it look as though we were situated at the center of the universe.</p>

<p>Specifically, it seems as though the universe itself is expanding and not that the things within the universe were moving away from each other. Instead it seems as though the expansion itself is creating more space between the contents.</p>

<p>Recently I also saw an amazing video on the eventual death of everything in the universe. This seems weird to me because as I understand it energy and matter don't go away they just change.</p>

<p>And it got me thinking, what if this eventual heat death of the universe is simply this expansion eventually ripping everything apart until every particle simply is to far apart to interact.</p>

<p>Basically, as things progress the expansion will affect the contents of the universe even down to the particle level.</p>

<p>Is this the case? Or am I misunderstanding this subject?</p>

"wavelength-based IFU data cubes VS velocity-based IFU data cubes","<p>I have 2 simulated IFU data cubes of the same observation, let's say A and B. The 3rd dimension of cube A is in wavelengths. In order to create cube B I just rebinned cube A in log-wavelengths and then converted that to velocity (km/s). The rebinning to log-wavelength was necessary in order to convert the 3rd dimension of cube B in km/s. For an explanation see this: </p>

In order to do that, for each cube, I have to create a Gaussian profile with FWHM equal to the resolution of the instrument (or Line Spread Function, or LSF) and then convolve that with every spectrum of the cube. Of course the LSF of cube A will be in wavelengths while the LSF of cube B in km/s. Here is my question now:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Since all pixel shifts in cube A do not correspond to the same km/s value, one of the two LSFs won't be a perfect Gaussian, right? Shall I assume that would be the velocity LSF?</p></li>
<li><p>What is the correct way of creating the velocity LSF? Do I just create a wavelength LSF and then rebin it to km/s, the same way I rebinned cube A to cube B?</p></li>

"Good textbooks for a descriptive astronomy course","<h2>Brief tale of woe</h2>

<p>My department at a small public university in the US has decided to begin offering a descriptive astronomy general education course for the first time in a couple of decades and we have no institutional memory of how it was done before nor anyone on staff who's taught such a beast.</p>

<p>And I've been tapped to teach it.</p>

<h1>Requirements</h1>

<p>It's to be a one-semester course with three hours a week of classroom instruction and a three hour lab scheduled late enough that we'll have some dark sky early in the semester and more as the year goes on (schedule has it in Fall Semester). Expected enrollment in the neighborhood of 20 to 30. I won't have a teaching assistant unless I can rope a physics major into doing it somehow (we're an all undergrad department).</p>

<p>As a ""general education"" course mine will mostly attract students majoring in non-science subjects, biological science or human science. The students will have had enough math to know (in principle) how to isolate any variable in, say, the law of universal gravitation but many won't remember at first and some will resist; many will have chosen this class in an effort to avoid 'hard' classes like our gen ed chemistry, physics, or geology courses.</p>

<p>I'm looking of a textbook that touches on things like</p>

<ul>
<li>Observational coordinate systems, familiarization with the night sky (constellations, I suppose), finding things</li>
<li>The Earth moon system, phases, eclipses, maybe even tides</li>

<li>The sun in particular and stars in general; including the birth, evolution and death of stars in a low math way</li>
<li>Some observational stuff; parallax, standard candles, HR diagram ...</li>

"A few questions regarding the transit of planets","<p>Here we will be concerning ourselves with the transit of a planet with it's parent sun.</p>

<p>I have a few questions that I am not sure about:</p>

<p>1) <strong>Do all planets transit their parent sun?</strong> It would seem to me that if all planets ""cross"" their parent star in some form, then depending on our point of view, we should be able to see the transits. For example, we never see a Mars transit, but if we alter our point of view to be farther then mars, then we would.</p>

<p>2) <strong>If all the planets are in the same orbital plane, would the transit of one, imply the transit of all the others</strong>? For example, our solar system is relevatily in the same plane, and it seems like Mercury/Venus transit, would also imply earth and beyond transits. We just have to be in right <strong>perspective</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>3) If a planet transits its star, does the probability of a transit increase/decrease/same if planet semi major axis changes</strong>? I am not sure about this one. I still think that it would be 100% <strong>the fact</strong> that a <strong>transit</strong> will occur, but its more unlikely that we would ever see it, because we need our angle to be just right.</p>

<p>4) <strong>If a planetary system has multiple planets, would we detect transits from several planets if they are all in the same orbital plane, or if they have different orbital planes</strong>? This kind of builds off of #2, and I think the answer is the same orbital plane, because the ""different"" orbital planes could be such that are 90 degrees from our point of view, meaning we would never see the transit.</p>

<p>I want to know if my understanding of transits is correct by these questions. Thanks!</p>

"DIY tracking motor - gear mating","<p>I have a Skywatcher 130/900 and I found that if I do an accurate polar alignment I'll need only one motor to track a celestial body, so I decided to build my motor. Right now I'm facing a problem with the mating of the spur gear that drive the worm gear</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/YvhQf.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/YvhQf.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Using a caliper I found that the gear has the outer diameter of 50mm, and a tooth is 1mm in height, so the reference diameter is 49mm; the gear has 140 teeth, and so the module (reference_diameter / n_of_teeth) is 0.35.</p>

<p>After this I used Solidworks to model a spur gear that could match it, and printed this</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/FNcju.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/FNcju.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>When I tried to check the mating, I found this</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/KBH17.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/KBH17.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>The teeth seems right, but they're too short and can't mate.</p>

<p>I used a caliper and counted the teeth to obtain the gear specs, and I think is kinda stupid as approach, but I could not think of something better to mate my gear. Is there a better approach to this?</p>

<p>Then, the idea was to try and remove the gear (removing the screw) and replace it with a 3d printed gear, but it does not seems to work (and I think it could break the telescope mount). Did someone try to do it?</p>

<p>Searching online I found that (obviously) there are some tracking motors and another question came to my mind: how can they mate the gear? Is there some kind of standard? Does it mean that every telescope's mount has some kind of standard gear? If yes, where can I found them?</p>

<p>EDIT: That's the situation: on the right there is the spur gear that I'm trying to mate (or eventually remove, if possible) and in the center there is the worm gear that move the telescope on the RA</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/UC9sK.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/UC9sK.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

"What accounts into calculating the Hubble constant?","<p>From my understanding, the Hubble constant $H_0$ calculates from observed redshifts $z$ of distant galaxys against their proper distance $D$. The current value appears to be <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble%27s_law#Observed_values"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"" title=""test"">67.80(77) $\frac{km}{s}Mpc^{-1}$</a></p>

<p>Calculating the Hubble constant via the redshift, I assume one only wants those velocity contributions due to the expansion of the universe, and not those from the real movement of the galaxies within in cluster (<em>peculiar motion</em>) or so. This, I also read in various online resources (which I can't recall right now).</p>

<p>On the other Hand, if your galaxy cluster is far enough away (eq. ~ 1 Gpc), one can neglect peculiar motion, which is in the order of 1000 $\frac{km}{s}$ (1000 $\frac{km}{s}$ / (1 Gpc $\times$ 67.80(77) $\frac{km}{s}Mpc^{-1}$) $\approx$ 1.4%)</p>

<p>Nonetheless, how would you try to correct for the peculiar motion, or is it really just neglected? Calculating all the gravitational components in each cluster? Another idea could be to assume that the galaxies within the cluster move randomly in respect to each other and the peculiar motion cancels out over the average? Any other possibilities?</p>

<p>The main Problem is the Mean Anomaly at J2000.0. The two Ellipses are equal, besides of the Size. Thus, the True Anomaly at a given time should be the same for Each Coordinate System.

"Why argon instead of another noble gas?","<p>I noticed that the atmospheres of Earth and Mars have a little bit of argon in them (1% to 2%). I checked Venus, too, which has 0.007% argon, but that's still more than any other noble gas in the Venusian atmosphere.</p>

<p>I checked the 4 outer gas planets, plus the moon Titan, and for the most part could not find Argon listed in their atmospheric composition. Jupiter is listed as having <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Jupiter#Chemical_composition"">a very tiny trace amount</a> of Argon that is hard to interpret because it's listing it as relative to helium and then relative to Jupiter/Sun, whatever that means. The moon Titan is listed as having <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Titan"">trace argon</a> without specifying any numbers. The others did not mention Argon.</p>

<p><strong>So why do the rocky planets tend to have argon, but the gaseous planets don't?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Why argon specifically?</strong> Presumably helium is too light and will float to the top and get knocked away by the solar wind. However, there is one noble gas between helium and argon, namely, neon. So why don't we have neon in our atmosphere instead of argon?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Maybe the outer planets <strong>do</strong> have Argon, but it all sank to the bottom and thus we don't detect it? I'm also curious about where Argon lies in the ""food chain"" of nuclear fusion for an average star like our Sun. I have a hard time seeing how Argon-40 would be more populous than Neon-20 though.</p>

"Why can I see the Andromeda Galaxy despite Milky Way's rotation?","<p>Okay ... so, I woke up from a dream last night wherein I was (apparently) attempting to devise a time-keeping system for interstellar travel (similar to the stardate system used in Star Trek). In the dream, I was attempting to correlate our current calendar, based on Earth's movements relative to the sun, with this fictitious calendar using the positions of intergalactic stellar bodies in comparison to Milky Way. (i.e., What if we could tell time based on the way other galaxies moved in relation to our own galaxy?)</p>

<p>So, in the dream, I was understanding that Milky Way is a spiral galaxy which rotates around a galactic center. That Earth is toward the middle-end of one arm of Milky Way's spirals. That almost every star we see in the night sky is <em>inside</em> Milky Way with us, and that the galaxy Andromeda is a great distance beyond Milky Way and can be seen in the night sky over Earth in the same location (between constellations Cassiopeia and Pegasus) every night since (at least) 10th century C.E.  </p>

<p>Assuming Milky Way was graphed on a flat sheet of paper with the Galactic Center plotted at X=0,Y=0, and the arm which contains Earth was located at X=0,Y=-δ, and also assuming the galaxy Andromeda can be seen in earth's sky from this position ... why then, when Milky Way rotates around it's galactic center so that the arm which contains Earth is located at X=+δ,Y=0 (a rotation of 90°), or even X=0,Y=+δ (a rotation of 180°) is the galaxy Andromeda still visible in the same location in the sky?</p>

<p>Unless the galaxy Andromeda is in some sort of galactic-synchronous orbit with Milky Way (which seems unlikely since most of the posts referencing Andromeda here deal with the collision of the two galaxies), then, in the in either of the second rotational positions listed above, Andromeda should no longer be visible.</p>

<p>What am I missing? Why does Andromeda, which is not a part of Milky Way, only move in the night sky in relation to Earth's seasons and not in relation to any other galactic movement?</p>

<li><em>estimated its mass based on the motions of galaxies near its edge</em> (doesn't quite talk about comparative rotational velocity)</li>

"Why do planets tend to rotate in the same direction although they have formed from tumbling asteroids?","<p>The axial tilts of asteroids seem to vary randomly (let me know if this premise is wrong), while the planets have a strong tendency to rotate in the same way. If planets were formed by colliding asteroids, shouldn't the sum of random tilts result in random planetary rotation? Of course other factors are important, like angle and velocity of impacts, YORP-effect, centrifugal breakup and whatnot, but how could that taken together have any systematic effect on rotation?</p>

<p>Ceres does behave with 4° tilt, but the other of the first discovered asteroids have tilts like 84°, 50°, 42°. Dust particles (and gas molecules if applicable) surely rotate randomly. The Solar nebula had a net spin which gravity and friction has manifested in the orbits of the planets. But shouldn't the netting of rotation be individual for each planet, with uncorrelated tilts, as orbital orientation is for each star?</p>

"What parameters cause sunburn?","<p>I am new to this site so if the question doesn't fit in this forum feel free to remove it.</p>

<p>I have read here <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunburn"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunburn</a> of all the causes of sunburn and I was mostly aware of all of them. I will list them here:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(<span class=""math-container"">$1$</span>) The time of day. In most locations, the sun's rays are strongest between approximately 10am and 4pm daylight saving time.</p>
  
  <p>(<span class=""math-container"">$2$</span>) Cloud cover. UV is partially blocked by clouds; but even on an overcast day, a significant percentage of the sun's damaging UV radiation can pass through clouds.</p>
  
  <p>(<span class=""math-container"">$3$</span>) Proximity to reflective surfaces, such as water, sand, concrete, snow, and ice. All of these reflect the sun's rays and can cause sunburns.</p>
  
  <p>(<span class=""math-container"">$4$</span>) The season of the year. The position of the sun in late spring and early summer can cause a more-severe sunburn.</p>
  
  <p>(<span class=""math-container"">$5$</span>) Altitude. At a higher altitude it is easier to become burnt, because there is less of the earth's atmosphere to block the sunlight. UV exposure increases about 4% for every 1000 ft (305 m) gain in elevation.</p>
  
  <p>(<span class=""math-container"">$6$</span>) Proximity to the equator (latitude). Between the polar and tropical regions, the closer to the equator, the more direct sunlight passes through the atmosphere over the course of a year. For example, the southern United States gets fifty percent more sunlight than the northern United States.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My question is, can we compose (<span class=""math-container"">$1$</span>), (<span class=""math-container"">$4$</span>) and (<span class=""math-container"">$6$</span>) into one statement: ""Height of sun over the horizon""? </p>

<p>Wikipedia seems to hint that we can since it says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Regardless of one's latitude (assuming no other variables), equal shadow lengths mean equal amounts of UV radiation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, the statement is kind of vague and I would like confirmation.</p>

<p>Another doubt I have regarding this is experience. I live in Europe where solar noon is at 1pm during summer and the day is longest on June 21 (or 22, whatever). But, people seem to get way more sunburn in, say, August 21 than in April 21, and also more at 4pm than at 10am (regardless of the month). It is also hotter in August than in April and at 4pm than at 10am. So it might be that people simply spend more time out because it's hotter and therefore get more sunburn, but it also might be that the temperature affects our skin somehow and we do get more sunburn when it's hotter.</p>

<p>So, taking clouds, reflective surfaces and altitude out of equation, is it true that sunburn is caused just by the height of the sun above horizon? If I spend 5 minutes at some place on a sunny day at noon in April, will I get the same amount of sunburn as I would at 3pm in June? (given that the sun is at the same height over the horizon at that times, and that 5 minute span is short enough to approximate that sun stays ""fixed"" in the sky)</p>

<p>My intuition says it should be true that height over horizon is the only parameter that should matter, but my experience shows different. Moreover, if I am correct, is there some graph/table showing how much intensity (or some other unit?) of sunburn I get with respect to height of sun? (say at zero altitude on a sunny day without reflective surfaces, or at some other, fixed, reference configuration).</p>

"Black hole, escape velocity, going up?","<p>I do know nothing can escape a black hole, and I understand popsci explanation of geodesics of space-time around and inside the event horizon. </p>

<p>I am at gym - a regular one, on Earth. Escape velocity of Earth is around 11.2 km/s. Yet I can lift weights up say one meter even at slower speed, say one meter per second. </p>

<p>Next, consider me hovering one meter above event horizon. As far as I know, for non-rotating BH this is totally possible. Similar to earth, I could lift weight up one meter at speed less than escape velocity (which at this point is speed of light <em>minus</em> x). </p>

<p>Now, I’m hovering one meter below the event horizon. Would I not be able to lift the weight up one meter at speed less than escape velocity (which at this point is speed of light <em>plus</em> y; not sure if x and y are equal), or would I not be able to hover at this position?</p>

"If earth changed its orbit, what would happen to the moon?","<p>Let there be an accelerating force acting on earth over an arbitrarily long time to change its orbit around the sun (e.g. by <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2001/jun/10/globalwarming.climatechange"" rel=""noreferrer"">asteroids repeatedly passing by close to earth (intentional or not)</a> or whatever). For this question consider only the effect of earth's gravity on the moon (and vice versa), not other influences (e.g. not the immediate effect the asteroids passing by have on the moon's orbit).</p>

<p>If such perturbations are weak enough yet of sufficient duration to change earth's orbit around the sun, how does it change the moon's orbit around earth? My considerations:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/4Fqvh.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/4Fqvh.png"" alt=""Sketch of effects of a force on earth on the moon&#39;s orbit""></a></p>

<p>Since the moon remains in orbit around earth even as the earth goes around the sun there obviously is some lower limit to how fast earth can accelerate. However, that force wanders around earth once a year, hence its effect on the moon's orbit is evening out - and the effects from the sun are supposed to be ignored here, anyway, so let's have the force go in a constant direction.</p>

<p>The force acting on earth can be decomposed into $F_\perp$ perpendicular to and $F_=$ coplanar with the moon's orbital plane. $F_\perp$ moves earth out of the plane of the moon's current orbit, so the moon's orbit will adjust to find a new plane: if the force is continuously applied in the same direction the moon's orbit will change until $F_\perp = 0$, so this factor can be neglected.</p>

<p>$F_=$ will cause the moon's orbit to become very elliptical, the moon passing closer on the side toward which earth is accelerated and being further away on the other side. If the force is indefinitely sustained something will happen to the moon, but under which circumstances will which scenario happen?</p>

<ol>
<li>the moon remains in orbit,</li>
<li>the moon gets tidally torn apart,</li>

"Moon is a planet by ""Clearing the neighborhood"" condition?","<p>Whether the Moon (Earth's natural satellite) is a planet is an old debate in planetary science.<br />
Though I do not agree that Moon is a planet, I found something difficult to clearly understand.</p>

<p>According to the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IAU_definition_of_planet"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">2006 IAU definition of planet</a>, a planet must satisfy <em>Clearing the neighbourhood</em> condition.
And some criteria for the condition are introduced in the Wikipedia article about <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearing_the_neighbourhood"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Clearing the neighbourhood</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Stern–Levison's <span class=""math-container"">$\Lambda$</span></li>
</ul>

<p><span class=""math-container"">$$\Lambda = \frac {m^2}{a^{\frac 3 2}} k$$</span></p>

<ul>
<li>Margot's <span class=""math-container"">$\Pi$</span></li>
</ul>

<p><span class=""math-container"">$$\Pi=\frac {m}{m^{\frac 5 2}a^{\frac 9 8}} k $$</span></p>

<p>In the above equations, <span class=""math-container"">$m$</span> is the mass of the body, <span class=""math-container"">$a$</span> is the body's semi-major axis, and other factors are described in the Wikipedia article. Both criteria are said to be satisfied if the calculated value is greater than 1.</p>

<p>My calculations are simple. Let <span class=""math-container"">$m_{Moon} = 0.0123 \times m_{Earth}$</span> and Moon's other factors (such as <span class=""math-container"">$a$</span>, <span class=""math-container"">$k$</span> and <span class=""math-container"">$M$</span>) have the same values as Earth's. Then I can get...</p>

<p><span class=""math-container"">$$\Lambda_{Moon} = 0.0123^2 \times \Lambda_{Earth} = 23.147$$</span></p>

<p><span class=""math-container"">$$\Pi_{Moon} = 0.0123 \times \Pi_{Earth} = 9.963$$</span></p>

<p>Both <span class=""math-container"">$\Lambda_{Moon}$</span> and <span class=""math-container"">$\Pi_{Moon}$</span> thus satisfy the <em>Clearing the neighbourhood</em> condition. Though I do not calculate the Soter's <span class=""math-container"">$\mu$</span>, it will not change my results.</p>

<p>What is wrong with my calculations and results? Do I miss something about the condition and the criteria? Or is there something wrong with the <em>Clearing the neighbourhood</em> condition?</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Edit</strong> in response to comments:</p>

<p>This question can be related to the idea that the <em>Clearing the neighborhood</em> condition is inadequate and ambiguous for the planet definition.
More deeply, this question can be related to the idea that 2006 IAU definition of planet is logically ambiguous and clumsy.<br />
For example, the 2006 definition of planet defines the Moon as a satellite and not a planet.
If one celestial body can be defined as a planet or not without rules and conditions, why other conditions are needed? All we need is just a planet list, not other planet conditions.</p>

<p>And...</p>

<p>Frankly speaking, the <em>Clearing the neighborhood</em> condition is like comedy. 
The condition says ""Planet must sweep out other bodies"" ...
Then says ""Except satellites"" ...
Then again says ""Except bodies having no significant size"" ...
Then again ""Except bodies having resonant orbit"" ...
Then again ""It may take billions of years"" ...
Then again ""Sweep-out process and time are influenced by other planets and bodies, actually"" .......</p>

<p>It is obvious that sometimes the <em>Clearing the neighborhood</em> theory is useful. But it is inappropriate for the rule and definition requiring strictness.</p>

<p>Edit:
I realize that the question wasn't clear enough based on the comment. So, what I am trying to do is to numerically solve the two body problem equation in the inertial frame. In the classic two-body problem 2nd order ODE, in my case, the position vector is defined from the centre of the asteroid to the sun, which is absolutely valid and upon integration gives me the position an velocity for the sun with respect to an inertial frame centred at the asteroid. My question is concerned with the initial conditions to begin the numerical integration. As of now I determine the initial state vector for the Sun from some random orbital elements. But to perform a more realistic simulation, Is it possible to determine the real orbital elements for the asteroid-centric motion of the Sun from a given set of orbital elements of a heliocentric-motion of the asteroid?

Even if a pulsar fails to escape the galaxy, it can be launched into unusual orbits. Assuming that the velocity distribution is isotropic, a decent fraction of such pulsars should have large orbital inclinations after the kicks, such that they rise above the galactic plane.</p>

<p>I have two questions regarding this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Is there a large - i.e. noticeable - population of such neutron stars, distinguishable by modern telescopes, or is the fraction of total neutron stars relatively small?</li>

"How accurate and complete is the Hubble sequence diagram?","<p>The <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_sequence"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Hubble sequence</a> sorts and characterizes or classifies galaxies by their shape. It was suggested by Edwin Hubble back in 1926.</p>

<p>One drawback, or criticism, of this scheme is that Hubble had a limited data set of galaxies at hand, compared to today's data. He ""only"" had a few hundred galaxies in visible light from which he could build the sequence.</p>

<p>So, adding today's knowledge of way more galaxies imaged in all different kinds of spectra how correct is Hubble's scheme? Is it skewed because of this originally limited selection of data? Are there other shapes missing in the sequence?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Some signs of water on Mars may have just dried up.</p>
  
  <p>Thanks to the way data from NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter are handled, <strong>the spacecraft may be seeing <a href=""https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2018GL080077"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">signs of hydrated salts that aren’t really there</a></strong>, planetary scientists report online November 9 in Geophysical Research Letters.</p>
  
  <p>That lack of salts could mean that certain sites proposed as places where life could exist on Mars today, including purported streaks of liquid water on the walls of Martian craters, are probably dry and lifeless.</p>
  
  <p>“People think these environments might be inhabitable by microbes,” says planetary scientist Ellen Leask of Caltech. But “there might not actually be any real evidence for it,” at least not from orbit.</p>
  
  <p>Leask and her colleagues found the problem while searching for hydrated salts called perchlorates in maps of Mars taken by the orbiter’s <a href=""http://crism.jhuapl.edu/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars</a>, or CRISM. Perchlorates can lower the freezing point of water by up to 80 degrees Celsius, which could be enough to melt ice in the frigid Martian climate.</p>

<p>If I understand correctly, during later image analysis and , some of the corrections to the data meant to compensate for ""spikes"" <em>in some observables</em> (<strong>despiking</strong>) occurring during large changes in brightness resulted in spectral features that suggested presence of hydrated minerals that didn't exist.</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> But I find the description of the step in the analysis responsible for the error a little bit complicated. Is it something simple like division by very small values leading to the spike in a derived quantity, followed by heavy-handed interpolation to smooth it over? What exactly does it mean when they talk about a few pixels, are there some physical locations on the detector that behave differently, or a spectral hot spot from artifacts in the grating? (e.g. Woods anlomalies)? “But for 0.05 percent of the pixels, it smooths out in a way that looks like perchlorate.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>CRISM’s camera doesn’t work perfectly, though. It can be thrown off by boundaries between light and dark, like a shadowed region at the edge of a cliff. <strong>Some pixels in the orbiter’s camera take a fraction of a millisecond to realize the surface color changed, so they record an extra spot of light or dark where it shouldn’t be. Planetary scientists have software to correct for these “spikes” in the spectra and make the data more reliable and easier to read.</strong></p>
  
  <p>But the correction sometimes introduces dips in the spectra at the same wavelengths as perchlorates, Leask and Ehlmann and their colleagues found. “We cleverly created a way to get rid of the spiky noise,” Ehlmann says. “But for 0.05 percent of the pixels, it smooths out in a way that looks like perchlorate.”</p>
  
  <p>The researchers found the glitch while looking for small signs of the salts in CRISM images. Assuming that the orbiter would have already spotted large deposits of perchlorates if they existed, the team wrote an algorithm to find smaller traces that covered fewer than 10 pixels in a CRISM image. And the scientists started seeing perchlorates everywhere, including Jezero crater, which NASA announced was selected as the landing site for the Mars 2020 rover on November 19 (SN Online: 11/19/18).</p>

"Is cosmic shear generally agreed to have been observed?","<p>A <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.0115"">review by Martin Kilbinger, 2015</a> says:</p>

  <p>Cosmic shear is the distortion of images of distant galaxies due to weak gravitational lensing by the large-scale structure in the Universe. Such images are coherently deformed by the tidal field of matter inhomogeneities along the line of sight.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>As a rough analogy</em>: imagine looking at an image full of galaxies through a rippled piece of glass. While a circular lens might make a galaxy look smaller or larger, a ridge would have a preferential direction of magnification, and the galaxies under that ridge would have a statistical tendency to have slightly different sizes on average parallel vs perpendicular to the ridge.</p>

<p>Is such a phenomenon generally agreed to have been observed yet? Are there any plots (of any kind) that show such experimental data?</p>

<hr>

<p>If I take this <em>rough analogy</em> one step further, while the peaks and troughs of the ripple magnify and demagnify, the midpoints between would be more prismatic - they would tend to deflect the centers, or locations of objects systematically, rather than affect the shapes. Applying this to cosmic shear, wouldn't the existence of shear essentially suggest that - to put it simply - stuff is, in fact, ""not quite"" where it appears to be?</p>

"Enceladus; why use the words ""geysers"", ""jets"", and ""plumes"" interchangeably?","<p><strong>Background, Europa:</strong></p>

<p>In an earlier question <a href=""https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/q/18496/7982"">How can “Geysers” on Europa reach heights of 100km?</a> I brought up the use of the word ""geyser"" in association with the reported confirming observations of water vapor plumes on Europa. Europa size and surface gravity are nearly as large as those of Earth's moon. With an escape velocity of about <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europa_(moon)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">2,025 m/s</a> it was hard for me to understand how an <em>actual geyser</em> could exist within the ice, a geyser so powerful that it could be shooting liquid water from the surface at 2 kilometers per second. </p>

<p>Part of the problem here is that I still can't be absolutely sure there is a clear definition of what is or isn't an <em>actual geyser</em> on solar system bodies other than Earth. On Earth, while a geyser is usually powered by geothermal conversion of water into steam, it pushes additional liquid water up to and above the surface as liquid. I believe that other sources of pressure may still result in proper Earth geysers.</p>

<p>Most scientific references I found referred to the vapor as plumes or jets, the word geyser was used in more popular and general interested articles.</p>

<p>It seems one likely explanation is a venting of water vapor (gas) from a particularly shaped vent can accelerate the molecules to an average velocity that is several times the speed of sound by converting random thermal motion to directed vertical motion, as described in a <a href=""https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/handle/2152/34041"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">U.T. Austin thesis by Jared James Berg</a>. Simulations there showed that this jet phenomenon can result in some water vapor reaching a substantial fraction of escape velocity, and rise to 100 to 200km altitudes. The model also addresses the formation of solids as ice crystals within the plume.</p>

<p><strong>About Enceladus:</strong></p>

<p>I have just come across the paper <a href=""http://ciclops.org/media/sp/2014/7927_18911_0.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">How the Geysers, Tidal Stresses, and Thermal Emission Across the South Polar Terrain of Enceladus are Related</a>, (Porco, DiNino and Nimmo (2014), Ast. J. 148 (3), 45), an in depth study of sources of water vapor from Enceladus. I saw that both geysers and jets were mentioned in the abstract, but at the end of the second paragraph in the introduction I ran into the very interesting sentence:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(Throughout this paper, we use the terms “jets” and “geysers” interchangeably.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The escape velocity on Enceladus is only about <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enceladus"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">240 m/s</a>, <em>nearly an order of magnitude lower</em> than that on Europa, which means much less sub-surface pressure would be required to push liquid water high above the surface into near space. So I can understand that the term geyser might be more likely to be appropriate for these plumes than it would be for the plumes on higher surface gravity Europa.</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong></p>

<p>I would know why the words ""geysers"" and ""jets""/""plumes"" would be used interchangeably. Is this because it hasn't been confirmed yet what they are, and the authors don't wish to show favoritism by choosing one or the other, or are they synonymous and can always be used interchangeably, or si there some other reason?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One thing I find when I’m out here imaging, by pointing the telescope at that part of the sky sort of south east at this time of night (early evening) there does seem to be a lot of satellites picked up by these images, and even on this 60 second exposure you can see we’ve got another satellite image there. </p>
  
  <p>Well I mean satellites can be a problem for a deep sky imager in that <strong>if you’re using a telescope that has quite a wide field of view and you’re taking fairly long exposures, like five minutes or ten minutes, then at some point during that exposure it’s quite likely a satellite will be recorded passing in front of the image.</strong></p>
  
  <p>In fact a recent image that I’ve taken of the Andromeda galaxy with a refracting telescope actually recorded five satellite trails in a five minute exposure, so that gives you a good idea just how crowded the skies are with all these satellites are in orbit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To me ""using a telescope that has quite a wide field of view... taking fairly long exposures like five or ten minutes..."" is a good description of how the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_Synoptic_Survey_Telescope"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Large Synoptic Survey Telescope</a> (main <a href=""https://www.lsst.org/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">site</a>) will operate. Granted the exposures may be closer to 15 seconds than 5-10 minutes, but on clear nights it will be imaging almost continuously for high throughput. The FOV is about 3.2 degrees, so ""wide field"" applies.</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> Has a plan or strategy been outlined or established to reduce the number of bright satellite trails that appear in LSST perpetual sky surveys, and/or to process images to remove the trails or at least flag pixel regions that contain likely trails?</p>

<p>Nearly every satellite and other large object in low Earth orbit is catalogued and it's position versus time can be predicted to a few kilometer accuracy (7km/400km is about 1 degree for example) and the object being in sunlight or dark can be likewise calculated, so one could conceivably adjust the exposure sequence to avoid some of the brighter ones and predict where they are likely to appear in data. So I'd be surprised if nobody has addressed this in a formal way yet.</p>

<p>Because the galaxies are gravitating, dark energy between them expands space less, while ""behind"" the galaxies, where their mutual gravities don't overlap as much, dark energy exhibits a greater effect. The arrows above the galaxies compare force vectors. The black arrows are forces of gravitational attraction, the violet arrows are forces of expansion. Eyeballing the vectors' sum for each respective galaxy, it seems that the galaxies get an extra kick of acceleration from the regions of greater expansion behind them.</p>

<p>If we play the movie in our heads with these assumptions: the galaxies start off by accelerating toward one another under their own mutual gravitational attraction (each observes a blueshift), then dark energy kicks in and the galaxies accelerate with more energy than can be accounted for by acceleration due to their own gravities alone (blueshift observed much greater than it should be).</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>The first group of Starlink satellites are sufficiently bright during dawn and dusk (when LSST would be surveying) that the trail would exceed sensor saturation, generating uncorrectable artifacts in the data. If instead these satellites were painted flat black making them a factor of 25 fainter, satellite trails should be less of a challenge for LSST due to its specific design.In that case LSST's frequent imaging of the same region of sky will provide enough data to correct for unsaturated satellite trails or other anomalies.</p>

<p>But now I'm wondering about something a little different. How do large telescopes doing surveys avoid saturation-induced artifacts caused by the brightest stars and planets? Their positions are of course absolutely predictable, so I suppose it's possible to keep their images slightly off of the silicon, and ""walk around"" them with a series of exposures, is that what the LSST will do?</p>

<p>There are other possibilities, for example a small, mechanical obscuring disk that can be introduced ahead of the CCD to cast a small slightly diffuse shadow, or in the case of multiple CCDs one could put the object between two sensors.</p>

<p>How is this done in practice, and how is the LSST planned to avoid this problem?</p>

"Lunar terminator illusion","<p>Sometimes, you can see the Moon high in the night sky, which is illuminated from the side where Sun goes down but slightly from above.

"Is it possible to steer the sight of a Liquid Mirror Telescope using a plain mirror scheme? If yes, why hasn't it been done?","<p>I have read about <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_mirror_telescope"" rel=""nofollow"">Liquid Mirror Telescopes</a> in a number of places, and according to these sources, a major disadvantage of these telescopes is that they can only ""see"" straight up.</p>

<p>In a nutshell, the usually very expensive primary mirror is replaced with a rotating mercury container. The mercury surface will become parabolic with the rotation and earth's gravity, and a camera is placed in the focal point of the parabola (straight above the container). Since the parabolic shape depends on gravity, the primary cannot be tilted and the telescope can only point straight up.</p>

<p>My question is: couldn't one use a mirror scheme to steer the sight of this telescope? For example a pair of big plain mirrors a bit above the focal point, working similarly to a periscope. Then one could change the angles of these two plain mirrors and point to different directions in the sky.</p>

<p>I am assuming a large plain mirror is much cheaper than a parabolic mirror of the same size.</p>

"Can cosmic rays alone produce noticeable aurorae in bodies far away from the Sun?","<p>Aurorae are caused by energetic particles interacting with planetary atmospheres. Part of this flux comes from the Sun (solar wind) while the rest is cosmic radiation.

"Day/Night Cycles and Seasons if the Earth's Rotational Axis and Orbit Changed","<p>I just enrolled in an introductory Astronomy course, and today in lecture the professor asked this question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Give 4 ways in which the day/night cycle and the seasons would behave on Earth if our rotational axis was in our orbital plane (Uranus is close to this). What about if the rotational axis was perpendicular to the orbital plane (so the ecliptic and Celestial Equator lay on top of each other), but the Earth's orbit was quite eccentric instead of almost circular?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For the first part, it means the Earth is rotating by North/South, right? Would this mean that the day/nights would be ""flipped around,"" i.e. it would be night in a city when it would normally be day. I don't think the seasons would change, since the orbit remains the same.</p>

<p>I don't really know what the 2nd part is saying. Is it simply asking what would change if the orbit was eccentric rather than what it is now?</p>

"Why do scientists think life requires water?","<p>As far as I know, scientists seeking extraterrestial life are simply looking for plantets containing water in liquid state. To be honest, I find this weird.</p>

<p>It is true that life - in the form we know on Earth - cannot exists without water. But how can one proof that such life isn't but a special case out of a bunch of other different types of life?</p>

<p>Actually, I think we can come out with at least one example of a ""organism-like thingy"" that would not require liquid water. Well, we could build a simple robot, whose ""natural ecosystem"" would be a junkyard (for mechanical, electric and electronic garbage). That robot would would fuel itself with solar energy, and reproduce by seeking out appropiate parts in the junkyard and building a copy of itself from them. Of course, that's just a theoretical example, I know it has many faoults, but I still hope the idea is clear - it should be indeed possible for life to exists without water.</p>

<p>I have also heard (sorry, I can't remember the source) that theoretically, there could be an organism whose metabolism would rely on sulphur.</p>

<p>So, unless scientists can proove that no life can exists without water (any life; not just Earth-like life), why do they keep looking just for water?</p>

<p>Unless, of course, we define ""life"" as ""any organism functioning like Earth organisms; therefore, metabolising organic structures with enzymes, built of protein, requiring water, etc"" </p>

"Method to determine the amount of reflected starlight necessary for an exoplanet to be visible from a given distance/angle?","<p>What is the method to determine the amount of reflected starlight necessary for an exoplanet to be visible from a given distance/angle? (Not from occlusion but actually visible on its own.) Further, how can you quantify this and calculate/predict/measure natural and artificial variations in the amount of reflected light?</p>

<p>I would like to see equations that take into account/assume the following things:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>the properties of the detection equipment, such as telescope mirror diameter, optical resolving power, digital resolution and sensitivity (I'm a newbie to astronomy so I don't know the proper terms or units for these things; I come from the world of photography with ISO, pixel count, noise levels, etc.). </p></li>
<li><p>the properties of the exoplanet such as diameter, distance from host star, surface reflectance coefficient on a hypothetical maximally ""clear day"", atmospheric thickness and reflected light absorption due to gasses, angles of a triangle drawn between the host star, exoplanet, and Earth.</p></li>
<li><p>assume a space-based telescope on Earth and assume no interstellar dust of significance.</p></li>
<li><p>assume no significant warping of spacetime by intense gravitational fields (i.e. we are looking at something in our stellar neighborhood, no further than, say, 50-100 LY)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Based on my nooblet research so far this equation should result in a figure expressed in Janksy units, I think? But I should like to know the average (RMS) photons per second that come from the exoplanet into the telescope, along with the peak value, during the periods of maximum and minimum intensity (i.e. when the planet is brightest and dimmest).</p>

<p>Please give an example using figures for the best equipment we currently have available for this purpose and provide links if you can to the website for that project. Please in the example, just for the sake of argument, use a planet and star exactly like Earth and the Sun. If a planet like Earth would not be detectable at these parameters, assume more powerful detection equipment (just scale up the telescope's properties until it would work at a 10 LY distance and say how much you had to scale it up, and feel free to opine on how unrealistic such a device is).</p>

<p>Lastly, and here's the kicker: now assume an artificial object with a perfectly flat reflecting surface exists upon one side of this exoplanet. How would you incorporate the precise amount of extra light added by such a surface to the above equation as a separate part of the equation? Assume that you know the following properties of the reflecting surface in advance:</p>

<ul>
<li>area of the flat reflecting surface</li>
<li>reflectance coefficient of the material used for constructing the surface </li>
<li>geometric shape (assume a contiguous primitive geometric shape like a disc or square or triangle, or disregard if this property is irrelevant. If it's not irrelevant, then why is it not? What difference would the shape make on what gets detected?)</li>
<li>angle between the reflecting surface plane and a plane tangent to the average sphere of the planet.</li>
</ul>

<p>For an example lets assume a disc of polished white stone (0.8 reflectance) 20,000 sq. m. in size, positioned on at the part of the planet with the brightest insolation, at a 45-degree angle from the tangent plane. It's polished to a degree, but not a mirror. When the planet rotates, at some point, this surface reflects the host star's light directly towards Earth and would cause a glint of light for a small amount of time. How do we calculate the glint's duration? How would we mathematically distinguish such a glint? How could you tell if such a glint was reflected starlight as opposed to a laser pulse or other artificial light source?</p>

<p>What size would such an artificial reflecting surface (0.8 reflectance) need to be in order to make a planet visible with today's best telescopes from various distances up to 10 LY, where under current technology, the planet is not visible? </p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p>

<p>I realized that in the case of flat reflecting surfaces then the inverse square law would not apply from the distance of the exoplanet to Earth, due to <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specular_reflection"" rel=""nofollow"">Hero's rule</a> (aka the <strong>law of reflection</strong> aka <strong>specular reflection</strong>). That means a totally still, large, flat body of water reflecting starlight, or a highly polished surface (like that of the Great Pyramid after its construction) would reflect a signal into space from the host star that would be detectable from a much greater distance away than the diffuse, incident light being reflected off of the planetary surface (which light would be subject to the inverse square law from the point of incidence).</p>

<p>Variables that would come into play would be the reflectance of the surface, the absorption of the atmosphere, flatness of the surface, and the level of insolation provided by the star. </p>

<p>By my preliminary calculations the reflections off of the Great Pyramid would be visible from 20 LY. </p>

I'm also posting the result I expect (fig 1) and the result I'm getting (fig 2). The problem here that I've understood till now is that if I copy and paste every contour block of coordinates separately into the .con file the result is as expected but I want the whole process of writing the contours from Matlab into the file such that it gives me the expected result in ds9 to be automated (basically I don't want to copy and paste every block). Can somebody help with this?</p>

<p>This is what I expect:</p>

"How does the number in stellar classification indicate properties within the range of that class?","<p>I am doing some research for a video game and I wanted to store stellar data on a star, such as its Stellar Classification, and then from that derive a physical appearance in the game.  These are fictional stars.</p>

<p>My original thought had been to store the star's classification, For example G2V and then at runtime I could use that data to determine things like surface temperature, brightness, radius, and mass.  From temperature I can also derive color.</p>

<p>However when I sat down to start coding a first pass on this I noticed something that confused me.</p>

<p>According to Wikipedia, our Sun, Sol, is a G2V star.  The number is supposed to indicate a ""sub"" classification.  A G2 star would be 20% between a G star and a K star.  A table there lists a G type star as having a surface temperature between 5,200 K and 6,000 K.  Therefore I figured a G2 star would have a temperature of about (I know nothing here is EXACT) 5,360 K (20% of the way between 5,200 and 6,000) but apparently it actually has a temperature of 5,800 K which is about 75% between the given range.  So why is Sol not a G7 of G8 star?</p>

<p>And then once I hit that irregularity, I had to assume that things like Radius and Mass are probably also not linearly interpolated along the range.</p>

<p>Is there a feasible way to derive properties such as I am looking at based on the Stellar Classification?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On the equator, the sun will be straight overhead and a vertical stick will cast no shadow at solar noon on the equinoxes. On the vernal equinox, north of the subsolar point (on the equator) the vertical stick's shadow will point a little westwards of true north (NNW) reading 336.5° from true north and little eastwards of true south (SSE) reading 156.5° from true north. On the autumnal equinox, north of the subsolar point (on the equator), the shadow will point a little eastwards of true north (NNE) reading 23.5° from true north (and south of the subsolar, the shadow will point a little westward of true south (SSW) reading 203.5° from true north).</p>

"Is the centre of axial precession perfectly perpendicular to the ecliptic?","<p>It is my understanding that the Earth's axial precession is such that the direction of the North pole pointing to the celestial sphere traces out a circle with a period of roughly 26,000 years.

I had assumed this would be somewhat arbitrary but have since learned that it points towards the north ecliptic pole.

"Adaptive Optics observations worse than natural seeing observations for faint structures?","<p>I have read that one drawback of Adaptive Optics (AO) IFU observations is that they have lower SNR (compared natural seeing observations) and as a result it is harder to observe faint structures. For example, in a galaxy observation, while AO can give great resolution in the inner parts of the galaxy, the faint outskirts or the disk are more visible with natural seeing observations. Is that true? Why AO are not good with faint structures? I assume there is some loss of light during the whole process involved with AO which results in lower SNR? Can someone give me more details please?</p>

  extended sources given the higher surface brightness detection
  threshold.</p>

"To which extent is optically thick photon transport related to conduction?","<p>When speaking about energy transport, the textbook, physics-101 always lists three possibilities:</p>

<ul>
<li>radiation</li>
<li>convection</li>
<li>conduction</li>
</ul>

<p>Now when studying radiation transport in (stellar) atmospheres and of course astronomy &amp; astrophysics in general, we are always concerned about the photon mean-free path $\lambda_{mfp}$. When $\lambda_{mfp}$ becomes too small compared to a scattering or absorption mean-free path, the equations of radiation transport turn into a diffusion equation for the photon intensity $I_{\nu}$ at frequency $\nu$, so that we get
$$ \partial_t I_{\nu} \sim \nabla (D \nabla I_{\nu})$$
where the diffusion coefficient $D$ in the optically thick limit is proportional to density $\rho$ and opacity $\kappa_{\nu}$, $D \sim (\rho \kappa_{\nu})^{-1}$.  </p>

<p>Now I want to understand differences of this process to conduction, which is similarly modeled with a diffusion equation, but different underlying transport physics. In solid state physics lectures one often derives the heat and transport of crystals, which then is given by the properties of how well phonons can transport momentum inside the crystal.</p>

<p>So finally, my question:
As we go deep into a star, a white dwarf or a Jupiter-like planet, the efficiency of optically thick photon transport becomes less and less.<br>
So in our transport equations, do we need to replace photon transport terms at some point brute-force by phonon/sound wave energy transport terms, or do they arise naturally when photons are scattered off phonons?</p>

Is optically thick phonon transport and conduction like in solid state physics sometimes the same?</p>

"Why do different instrumental filters use different magnitude systems (Vega vs AB)?","<p>Suppose I wanted to construct the spectral energy distribution (SED) of an object. Further suppose I observe this object through the 9 broad-band filters using the Subaru Suprimecam (just for an example) here: <a href=""http://www.naoj.org/Observing/Instruments/SCam/sensitivity.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.naoj.org/Observing/Instruments/SCam/sensitivity.html</a></p>

<p>As the statement below the table of broad-band filters says, the Johnson-Cousins filters (capital letters) are on the Vega magnitude system whereas the SDSS filters (lowercase letters) are on the AB magnitude system. I understand what these two magnitude systems are and how to convert between them.</p>

<p>My question is: what is the point of the two sets of filters being on different magnitude systems, one Vega and the other AB? It's not as if the Johnson-Cousins filter <em>hardware</em> physically has the Vega spectrum built into it, right...? </p>

<p>If I do aperture photometry on an I-band image and an i'-band image, will the first one return Vega magnitude of the object and the second return AB magnitude of the object, by default? And if I wanted to do SED fitting, then I need to be consistent such that all of my data points (even from other telescopes) need to be on the same magnitude system (e.g., convert the I-band Vega magnitude into an I-band AB magnitude)? (Or do that conversion first, and only <em>then</em> convert to flux units via $\nu F_{\nu}$ or $\lambda F_{\lambda}$).</p>

"How will microshutter arrays be used in the James Webb and future space telescopes?","<p><strong>Question:</strong> How will microshutter arrays be used in the James Webb and future space telescopes?

<p>The NASA Goddard news item <a href=""https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2019/nasa-to-demonstrate-new-star-watching-technology-with-thousands-of-tiny-shutters"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">NASA to Demonstrate New Star-Watching Technology with Thousands of Tiny Shutters</a> says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The technology, called the <strong>Next-Generation Microshutter Array (NGMSA), will fly for the first time on the Far-ultraviolet Off Rowland-circle Telescope for Imaging and Spectroscopy, or FORTIS</strong>, mission on October 27. The array includes 8,125 <strong>tiny shutters</strong>, each about the width of a human hair, <strong>that open and close as needed to focus on specific celestial objects.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>and </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The microshutter technology gives scientists the ability to produce multiple spectra at once. This capability improves productivity on both sounding rocket missions, which offer only six minutes of observing time, or large space-based observatories, which can take up to a week to observe faint, far-away objects and gather enough light to obtain good spectra. With observing time at a premium, the ability to gather light from multiple objects at once is paramount. </p>
  
  <p>Webb, scheduled to launch in 2021, will carry NASA's first-generation microshutter technology — four 365-by-172 microshutter arrays that together total 250,000 shutters. They will allow Webb to obtain spectra of hundreds of objects simultaneously.  </p>
  
  <p>What distinguishes the next-generation array on FORTIS from the one flying on Webb is how the shutters are opened and closed. Webb’s arrays employ a large magnet that sweeps over the shutters to activate them. However, as with all mechanical parts, the magnet takes up space and adds weight. Furthermore, magnetically activated arrays can’t be easily scaled up in size. As a result, this older technology is at a disadvantage for supporting future space telescopes larger than Webb.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Magnet Eliminated</strong></p>
  
  <p>To accommodate future missions, Goddard’s microshutter-development team eliminated the magnet. The shutters in the pilot 128-by-64 array that will fly on FORTIS open and close through electrostatic interactions. By applying an alternating-current voltage to electrodes placed on the frontside of the microshutters, the shutters swing open. To latch the desired shutters, a direct current voltage is applied to electrodes on the backside.</p>
  
  <p>Without a magnet, the next-generation array can be dramatically scaled up in size — and that’s precisely what the team is attempting to accomplish. Particularly, Greenhouse and Li are using advanced manufacturing techniques to create a much larger, 840-by-420 array equipped with 352,800 microshutters, dramatically increasing an instrument’s field of view.</p>
  
  <p>“The array that is flying on FORTIS is a technology development prototype for the big one,” Greenhouse said.</p>

"Can matter fly directly into a black hole and avoid the accretion disc?","<p>From what my non-scientifically-trained mind understands, matter typically enters a black hole via getting caught up in the accretion disc going faster and closer to the black hole until it passes the event horizon, the point of no return. Using Earth as an analogy for a black hole, I assume the accretion disc would orbit around the equator, similar to Saturn's rings, and the matter might eventually crash into Brazil or somewhere along the equator?</p>

<p>My main question is, can matter simply do a straight shot into the black hole at a higher latitude, say straight into New York City, avoiding the disc altogether?</p>

Instead of the metric expansion of space, why not ""cosmic time dilation""?  </p>

<p>As far as I know, there is no physical mechanism in physics to explain how the metric expansion can cause red shift.  It appears that we assume metric expansion can cause red shift with no underlying physics or testing.   </p>

<p>Alternatively, red shift caused by time dilation is well tested, proven, and understood.  It is something we can play with here on Earth.  </p>

<p>Wouldn't assuming cosmological redshift is caused by the observer moving faster in time than the emission source in the past makes more sense than the metric expansion of space causing cosmological redshift?</p>

See also Keck's <a href=""https://www2.keck.hawaii.edu/inst/hires/"">HIRES home page</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For two decades, these scientists have pointed HIRES at more than 1,600 ""neighborhood"" stars, all within a relatively close 100 parsecs, or 325 light years, from Earth. The instrument has recorded almost 61,000 observations, each lasting anywhere from 30 seconds to 20 minutes, depending on how precise the measurements needed to be. With all these data compiled, any given star in the dataset can have several days', years', ore even more than a decade's worth of observations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This part caught my interest especially:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""<strong>We recently discovered a six-planet system orbiting a star</strong>, which is a big number,"" Burt says. ""We don't often detect systems with more than three to four planets, but we could successfully map out all six in this system because we had over 18 years of data on the host star."" (emphasis added)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For very simple cases of one, or maybe two planets with minimal interplanetary gravitational interaction, a Fourier transform of a nice, long, continuous radial velocity measurement would show two main peaks, and possibly other artifacts. If the stellar motion induced by each planet were similar magnitude, the analysis might be fairly simple.</p>

<p>But for the six planet case mentioned in the quote (I don't know which one it is), and patchy time coverage (it's a survey) how was this analysis done? Peaks alone? Or just throw it to a supercomputer simulation of every possible combination and let simulated annealing run for a month?</p>

<p>Or was there some 'detective work' involved as well - assumptions, limitations of the fitting space, or even inclusion of other data from outside the study?</p>

"How can the observable universe shrink in a Big Rip?","<p>As far as I know, the Big Rip occurs when the scale factor reaches infinity in a finite time. This will only happen in a universe dominated by phantom energy (i.e. a universe with an equation of state of $&lt; -1$). However, according to <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Rip#Expansion"" rel=""noreferrer"">Wikipedia</a>,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A universe dominated by phantom energy is an accelerating universe, expanding at an ever-increasing rate. However, this implies that the size of the observable universe is continually shrinking; the distance to the edge of the observable universe which is moving away at the speed of light from any point moves ever closer. When the size of the observable universe becomes smaller than any particular structure, no interaction by any of the fundamental forces can occur between the most remote parts of the structure. When these interactions become impossible, the structure is ""ripped apart"".</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On Wikipedia, there is a ""[why]"" tag, indicating that this wasn't explained very well.</p>

<p>This raises two questions. In a universe dominated by phantom energy, why would the observable universe not continue growing and approaching the cosmic event horizon? After all, its comoving distance is just $\int_0^t \frac{\mathrm{d}t}{a(t)}$, so shouldn't it just monotonically increase?</p>

<p>More confusingly, Wikipedia implied that the Big Rip occurs when the observable universe's radius becomes incredibly small and the fundamental forces can no longer hold any structure together, rather than when the scale factor reaches infinity.

<ul>
<li>we receive photons from <em>FAO</em> that were emitted long long ago</li>

<ul>
<li>at t=-11 billion years(By), photons are emitted in a slow expanding universe, and today we can view the object as it was</li>
<li>at t=-2 By, the object moves faster than speed of light, so photon emitted at that time will never reach us, even if we wait the 9 by + ""expansion correction"" needed...</li>

<p>I've read that for empirical methods it is crucial that the training data (i.e. the data from which the mapping of the photometry to the redshift is inferred) represents the galaxies for which estimated redshifts are desired in the future.

How do I know if a galaxy is well represented by the training data so that I can estimate a redshift for the galaxy?</p>

"Where can I find permissibly licensed database of stars and constellations?","<p>I'm working on a game engine of sorts, and one thing I did for a previous game which was under the GPL was I had a night sky with the constellations visibly connected and I'd like to do that again.  I don't know where my data set originally came from but I do have a note that it was GPL, so it likely came from Stellarium, which is GPL licensed.  For this I need the dataset to come from the public domain, us government, permissively licensed, etc.</p>

<p>If possible I'm after the coordinates in the sky, brightness, maybe class and name, but also some mechanism to know which stars would be connected in classic constellations.  </p>

<p>I've found some data sets which contain the star data I'm after, though they would take some effort to parse and pull out the data I'm after, but I can't seem to find anywhere online, except stellarium, which provides star constellation connectivity. Any ideas?</p>

<p>I've gotten this list so far from what I can tell:</p>

GPL (Really restrictive) But has things like a constellationship file, i.e. <a href=""https://github.com/Stellarium/stellarium/blob/master/skycultures/western/constellationship.fab"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://github.com/Stellarium/stellarium/blob/master/skycultures/western/constellationship.fab</a></li>

<p>Are there any standards of what stars make up the primary connections in constellations?  Or does it just happen to be whoever puts it together?</p>

"Are all planets/galaxies moving away from *us*?","<p>From what I can see in a physics textbook page (on redshift), it seems to imply that all planets/galaxies emit red, rather than blue waves (for red-shift).</p>

<p>On a similar note, does everything move at the same speed away from the centre of the Universe? - If not, then wouldn't that mean that we'd see a few planets/galaxies that emit blue, as they are traveling with a greater velocity from the centre than we are (with it being closer to the centre) and that they are 'catching up' with us?</p>

"Does it make more sense to upgrade our existing telescope or to buy a new one?","<p>We're at a bit of a crossroads here, since we're faced with what appears to be a tough choice. </p>

<p>We've got a Celestron 11"" SCT tube with a Losmandy G11 equatorial mount, all bought in 1996. The mount has motors, but they're only capable of 5 tracking programs (Moon, deep space, etc). The tracking also doesn't appear to work quite well at the moment, but we may be able to fix that on our own.</p>

<p>We may, however, have an opportunity to acquire funding for an upgrade. We could upgrade the mount (or buy a new one), so that it is completely computerised and is capable of finding and tracking objects with ease. For that upgrade we've been given a ballpark of 2000$. I don't know where the number comes from, but let's assume we can have the desired upgrade with that sum. </p>

<p>Now, here's the question - wouldn't that money be better spent on buying another telescope, e.g. a Celestron Evolution 8 (same price range), which is already computerised, and is overall much easier to use? I realise there's a difference between 11"" and 8"", but I've had the opportunity to compare them in field and for our purposes, I couldn't find it.</p>

<p>We are a small astronomy club. Our activities with the telescope hardly go outside the scope of amateur astronomy - we look at the Moon, Saturn, Jupiter, sometimes Mars. We do sometimes look at, e.g. the Orion nebula, but so far that's the extent of our endeavours. We do not expect to transition to astrophotography, beyond what can be achieved with DIY solutions, nor do we use the telescope for research or data acquisition.</p>

"Right Ascension for epoch 2000 - physical location?","<p>I understand that Right Ascension is a longitude-like celestial coordinate that varies from 0-24hrs, taken from a reference point of the vernal equinox. More specifically, for star maps that are based on the epoch 2000.0, this specifically means when the vernal equinox occurred in the year 2000. Even more specifically, the vernal equinox is a specific time and date, and location of the exact point in time, when sunrise occurred, of when the day and night were exactly equal in length. Here are my questions:</p>

<p>1) If the Right Ascension is referenced from “Vernal Equinox” position “0hr”, in the year 2000, then why does nobody ever talk about the equivalent physical location? ie: if the right ascension (sunrise of the vernal equinox) occurred in the year 2000 in a particular city, or longitude, why doesn’t anyone ever mention that. ie: (just an example) Right Ascension is always measured from longitude -80deg (close to Miami, Florida, USA), as this was a city the vernal equinox occurred in the year 2000?</p>

<p>2) If the star maps do not change much within a period of a few decades, (eg: take for example, the right ascension and declination of the sirius star is pretty much the same in 2019 as it was in the epoch 2000, or 1990 for that matter), then these RA and dec values should not change much within a decade or so. Ipso facto, we can deduce that the sunrise time for the vernal equinox should not change very much from year to year. ie: Since RA is measured from a reference based on the sunrise of the vernal equinox in the year 2000, then the sunrise of the vernal equinox in the year 2019 should not be very much different (assuming RA is the same today as it was in 2000). But it isn’t!!! If you track the sunrise of the vernal equinox from year to year, it varies a lot! I am obviously missing something… it’s driving me nuts.</p>

<p><strong>Update below:</strong></p>

<p>From Norton’s 2000.0 star atlas, please see the following definitions:</p>

<p>In the last link, It says the 0 line of right ascension is equivalent to the Greenwich meridian on Earth.  In a sense, this is the ultimate answer to my question #1, although it begs more details.  In Astronomy, why is this rarely mentioned?  If it was, star maps would be much easier to comprehend by anyone.  (Ie: RA of any star is simply referenced from the Earth equivalent of longitude 0…).  </p>

<p>Does this also mean, that during the vernal equinox, the point in time where the sun crosses from the Southern Hemisphere to the Northern hemisphere, longitude 0 meridian on Earth is directly at that intersecting point too?  So, as Mike G said, “sunrise"" is irrelevant on the day of the vernal equinox.   I understand this part.  But the exact moment of the vernal equinox does matter… because from any point on Earth, the stars all move in the sky as time progresses, hour by hour.  If you’re going to base a map of where the stars are, it has to be referenced from one moment in time, and from once longitudinal reference (and one declination reference).</p>

<p>Now, bringing it all back to star maps:  @Mike G: Would you say that simply, any star map based on J2000 epoch is basically where all the stars were on Jan 1, 2000 (at 12 noon greenwich time)?  However, you also mentioned the J2000 epoch does NOT depend on the equinox.  This is where I go fuzzy.  From reading the reference links above, it seems like it does depend on the equinox.  If the J2000 epoch star maps are indeed referenced from 12 noon, then in the year 2000, at the time of vernal equinox, the greenwich meridian intersection occurred  at 12 noon?  </p>

<p><strong>Update 2</strong>
<br> <br>
OK, I think I have some of my basic misconceptions cleared.  RA 0hr simply cannot be measured relative to any point on Earth.  It is measured against the first point of Pisces (It used to be Aries a long time ago).  Specifically, for J2000 star maps, the RAs would be calculated based on relative positions from Pisces in the year 2000 around March 21 (vernal equinox). (Norton's Atlas -2nd link above- describes RA as around this date.   I found no reference for January 1 -please correct me if this is not the case). </p>

<p>So to summarize what I understand, if you're only given an RA and declination for a particular star and you wanted to find it in the sky, you would need to innately know where Pisces is.  From there, you can roughly work out approximately how many degrees of ""longitude"" away from Pisces your star is.  (So, you would also need to know where due North and due South are).  You would also have to know what latitude you are at on Earth, so you can work out roughly where your star's declination places it on it's meridian in the sky.  For example, if you knew you lived at +40deg latitude on Earth, and you looked straight up at the zenith, you could estimate that the horizons are at about +90deg and -90deg away from that +40deg position. For there, you could interpolate where on the meridian (declination) your star lies.</p>

<p><strong>Update 3</strong>
<br> <br>
Thanks Mike G for the wiki reference to Celestial Coordinates.  This shows that the star atlas J2000 is NOT referenced to the vernal equinox, but simply references to a snapshot in time of the stars on January 1, 2000, noon terrestrial time (or 2000 January 1, 11:58:55.816 UTC, which was the old greenwich mean time).  The RAs and Decs in the atlas are referenced to Pisces at that moment in time. </p>

The last time a second was added, in 2012, problems were caused in some systems. Why do we need to do it?</p>

"Why does the Solar Wind consist of charged particles?","<p>The Wikipedia article on <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_wind"" rel=""noreferrer"">Solar Wind</a> gives the following explanation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The solar wind is a stream of charged particles released from the upper atmosphere of the Sun, called the corona. This plasma mostly consists of electrons, protons and alpha particles with kinetic energy between 0.5 and 10 keV.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If the solar wind consists of both electrons and protons, why don't they combine and give Hydrogen or any other elements? Then, why would Solar Wind be charged? Is that because of the high kinetic energy of the ejected particles? If yes, let us consider a proton and an electon. They must be of almost the same energy if so there will be no relative kinetic energy, so I think they must combine in the same way as if they were at rest or in motion at small velocities.</p>

"Why do J2000 coordinates change with time in Stellarium?","<p>I'm new to the field so I'm sure this is a basic misunderstanding.
As I currently understand it, J2000 equatorial coordinates describe the position of objects by referencing a specific point in time (12:00 Jan 1st 2000) to account for the effect of the precessional cycle in the reference point for RA. Presumably this means that the same object measured on different dates should still have the same J2000 coordinates?</p>

<p>In Stellarium, if I look at the RA/Dec (J2000) of a star on one date, then compare to the previous year the J2000 coordinates don't match:</p>

"Questions about a fictional binary system, and habitability","<p><strong>Note:</strong> Questions are at the bottom. The rest had simply been written in a format to better organize my thoughts. The formulas used to construct this fictional solar system, had been borrowed from <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeh-pJYRZTBJDXMNZeWSUVA"">Artefxian</a> and are presented in several of his videos. </p>

<p><strong>Theoretical:</strong><br>
A P-Type binary star system featuring a gas giant on or near the habitable zone, with a habitable moon.</p>

<p><strong>Considerations:</strong>   </p>

<ul>
<li>Gas giant would need a stable magnetosphere. Jupiter and Saturn may be useful examples. </li>
<li>The moon's mass must be great enough to sustain an atmosphere. In this instance, a nitrogen/oxygen atmosphere. It is estimated that a moon with a mars-like density, would need at least 7% of Earth's mass in order to support such an atmosphere for several billion years.</li>
<li>Both gas giant and the habitable moon must maintain stable orbit. Simulations would suggest that, to maintain a stable orbit to a gas giant, or a brown dwarf that orbits 1 AU from a sun-like star, would require a moon orbital period of less than 45 - 60 days.   </li>
<li>The moon itself must be capable of generating it's own magnetosphere in order to deflect stellar wind and the gas giants' naturally generated radiation belts.  </li>
<li>There is a high likelihood that the moon would be tidally locked with it's parent world. Monoj Joshi, Robert Haberle, and their colleagues suggest that the effect of tidal heating could support conditions amenable to habitability. Additionally, tidal effects may allow for plate tectonics, causing volcanic activity and a regulation of the moon's surface temperature. The potential, resulting geodynamo effect would allow for a strong magnetic field.  </li>
<li>Balance: The moon should be large enough to support tectonic activity, dense enough to support a strong protective magnetosphere, close enough to the gas giant to maintain stable orbit, and be far enough away that it's own magnetosphere may better protect from sputtering caused by it's parent worlds' radiation belts.  </li>
<li>It is suggested that the larger and more dense a terrestrial, water-rich world, the further out it's habitable zone extends.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Fictional Data:</strong><br>
Star A: Mass = 1.1; Luminosity = 1.39; Diameter = 1.07; Surface Temperature = 1.04<br>
Star B: Mass = 0.9; Luminosity = 0.69; Diameter = 0.92; Surface Temperature = 0.94<br>
Separation: 0.3 AU<br>
Barycenter: 0.45/0.225 AU<br>
Eccentricity: 0.4/0.5<br>
Separation Minimum: 0.27/0.1125<br>
Separation Maximum: 0.63/0.3375<br>
Separation Overall: 0.9/0.45<br>
Inner Boundary: 0.2 AU<br>
Outer Boundary: 80 AU<br>
Frostline: 6.984 AU<br>
Inner Habitable Zone: 1.976 AU<br>
Outer Habitable Zone: 2.808 AU<br>
Ideal Position: 1.8 AU<br>
Inner Forbidden ""Hell"" Zone: 0.3 AU<br>
Outer Forbidden ""Hell"" Zone: 1.35 AU  </p>

<p><strong>Goal:</strong> Create a fictional, theoretical system which can be demonstrated as stable, in which an earth analog may safely orbit a gas giant.</p>

<p><strong>Further Considerations:</strong>   </p>

<ul>
<li>The moon does not necessarily need to be an earth analog, and may simply be demonstrated as habitable to human life.</li>
<li>The gas giant does not necessarily need to be within the habitable zone, and may cradle the outer limits of the CMZ, or be further out provided it can be demonstrated that the orbiting moon could feasibly support human life unassisted by technology. i.e. Robin Crusoe could become stranded on the moon, and survive. </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Questions:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>How far would the moon have to orbit from it's parent body, to prevent tidal locking?  </li>
<li>How can I find a balance, between the binary stars' gravitational pull, the gas giant's gravitational pull, and the chaos it may play on the moon?  </li>
<li>If no balance can be met, I will accept tidal locking with the moon. In this instance, how can I go about determining a safe and stable orbiting distance for the moon?  </li>
<li>How can I determine the effect of the gas giants' magnetosphere on the moon? What would the math behind it look like?  </li>
<li>Are there any considerations I may be missing, and how would they affect this scenario?</li>
</ol>

"Why do we expect Type Ia Supernovae to be brighter in a decelerating Universe than what has been observed?","<p>This seminal review paper in the PNAS by Robert P. Kirshner (<a href=""https://www.pnas.org/content/96/8/4224"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.pnas.org/content/96/8/4224</a>) says the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If the universe had been decelerating—–in the way it would if it contained the closure density of matter, that is, if Ωm = 1—then the light emitted at redshift z = 0.5 by a SN Ia would not have traveled as far, compared with a situation where the universe had been coasting at a constant rate—characteristic of an empty universe, where Ωm = 0. For a universe with Ωm = 1, the flux from the distant supernova therefore would be ≈25% brighter. But the distant supernovae are not brighter than expected in a coasting universe, they are dimmer. For this to happen, the universe must be accelerating while the light from the supernova is in transit to our observatories.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I didn't understand this.</p>

<p>Why do we expect Type Ia Supernovae at a particular distance to be more or less brighter based on the matter density of the Universe?</p>

<p>In other words, why should the brightness of anything at a particular distance  depend on whether the Universe was accelerating or not?  </p>

"Why is it hard to reconcile Gaia DR2 with the HIP data set","<p>I'm trying to get a database of about 20 million of the brightest stars in the sky for a project I'm working on, and I want to reconcile it with the Hipparcos data set.  Currently, I'm only using the HIP dataset for everything, especially the constellations, additionally, as far as I understand, the DR2 data set doesn't have the brightest stars. </p>

<p>My confusion is that for many stars, there is an easy one-to-one correlation, i.e. at 104.304832, 57.563355, I see a magnitude 4.613 star.  This star appears in the HIP dataset as a 6.150 magnitude star.  Roughly the same parallax.  But, if I look at 102.733851, 57.649038, at the 7.44 magnitude star, I see nothing at all in the HIP dataset. </p>

<p>Honestly, <em>most</em> of the stars I'm trying to correlate between the two data sets do not appear.  Is RA/DEC defined differently between the two data sets?  Are they intended to be used as concatenated data sets?

"Do Electric Charges in the Van Allen Radiation belt move in Opposite Directions?","<p>The Wikipedia Article on <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Allen_radiation_belt"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Van Allen Radiation Belt</a> gives the following explanation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A Van Allen radiation belt is a zone of energetic charged particles, most of which originate from the solar wind, that are captured by and held around a planet by that planet's magnetic field.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The term ""energetic charged particles"" hinted to me that these charges are in motion and in very large velocities. </p>

<p>Let us assume, a small portion of space in the Van Allen Radiation Belt, compared to the size of Earth. We can assume the magnetic field in this space to be uniform due to our previous assumption. From the formula for finding <a href=""http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/magnetic/movchg.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Magnetic force on moving charges</a>, <span class=""math-container"">$$\vec{F}=q(\vec{v}\times\vec{B})$$</span> where <span class=""math-container"">$\vec{F}$</span> is the magnetic force on the charged particle, <span class=""math-container"">$q$</span> is the electric charge of the particle with an appropriate sign, <span class=""math-container"">$\vec{v}$</span> is the velocity vector and <span class=""math-container"">$\vec{B}$</span> is the magnetic field vector.</p>

<p>As per the above formula, the direction of force is dependant on the nature of charge as well as the direction given by the cross product. If we consider the charged particles to move with uniform speed, the net force acting on the charge must be equal to zero. I think we must neglect the gravitational force exerted by Earth on the charges since the mass of charges is negligible. The two forces, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrifugal_force"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Centrifugal force</a> and the magnetic force (exerted by Earth's magnetic field due to the motion of the charged particles) cancel each other when they have the same magnitude but opposite direction. From the formula, it is also evident that the direction of force changes with the sign of the charge. It must be opposite for positive and negative charges. </p>

<p>So, based on this is it correct to assume, if the positive charges orbit the earth in one direction the negative charges orbit the earth in the opposite direction? Do they really orbit Earth in opposite directions?</p>

<p>The following image (a view from the top of poles of Earth) depicts my idea on the sense (clockwise or anticlockwise) of rotation of charges in the Van Allen Radiation Belt:</p>

<p>Among so many other things (and perhaps you can touch on some of the biggest 'other' things), would anything on the asteroid's side of Earth be essentially 'sucked' towards the asteroid. That is if I am standing outside and it passes would I lift off the ground and float towards it? </p>

<p>Conversely, would things on the opposite side experience two times the standard weight? That is if I am standing on the other side, would I feel heavier as the asteroid passes?</p>

<p>I realise there would be many other devastating effects but I'm most interested in this one...</p>

<p>The possible answer I suspect is that objects on Earth will not 'feel' anything as the Earth as a whole will move towards the asteroid and not every little thing inside Earth...</p>

"How would I define mass in a space","<p>I always heard that mass is a measure of inertia during my school days. Is this  applicable to bodies which are in space ? Suppose there is space craft in a space; how would I define mass ?
I read some article and consulted with my teachers; they said mass is similar to conservation of momentum but I do not know how. And then he said mass is independent of frame it is constant, whereas I see momentum is itself a frame dependent quantity and velocity is frame dependent. I am confused how I would actually define a mass in space, what is the correct definition for a mass ? </p>

"Time dilation due to the expansion of the universe","<p>This is not a homework question. I want some help in being able to clearly perceive the expansion of the universe and the consequences thereof.</p>

<p>We know that the universe is expanding in an accelerated manner. It is my understanding that space alone cannot expand without affecting the local time. Thus as per GTR, depending on the curvature of space-time and the energy density, time too shall suffer a change due to the changing space.</p>

<p>Assuming that there is no curvature of space-time and no mass or energy contained in a chunk of space (assuming the zero point energy of empty space as zero) between two galaxies A and B, let us say that the local time at a point P in this space goes as <span class=""math-container"">$t_0$</span>. If we on Earth could somehow observe this point and measure the time at P as <span class=""math-container"">$t$</span>, </p>

"How can an accretion disk form around the central star of a planetary nebula?","<p>I was reading the 2012 paper <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1202.1168"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">A tidally destructed massive planet as the progenitor of the two light planets around the sdB star KIC 05807616</a> about the possible origin of two exoplanets that orbit a subdwarf B star. The researchers suggested that they could have been formed by the fragmentation of the metal core of a gas giant that was orbiting the star while it was still in the main sequence. Just at the moment when it became a red giant and absorbed the planet, which was fragmented by tidal forces when it reached the core.</p>

<p>Here is an excerpt from the summary:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We suggest the following alternative scenario for the formation of the two planets (section 2). A single massive planet of mass <span class=""math-container"">$m_P \gtrsim 5M_J$</span> went through the CE evolution inside the RGB envelope. It spiralled all the way to the center. The released gravitational energy is behind the removal of the stellar envelope, as is commonly the case with CE evolution. The massive planet reached the tidal destruction radius (eq. 1). The gaseous mass of the planet was lost and part of it formed a temporary accretion disk around the core, that now is the EHB star. The metallic core of the massive planet was tidally destructed into several Earth-like bodies immediately after the gaseous envelope was removed. Different bodies had different energy per unit mass. Some of them spiral-in and were further destructed by the core, while other survived at orbital separations of <span class=""math-container"">$\gtrsim 1R_⊙$</span> within the gaseous disk. The bodies interacted with the disk and among themselves and migrated, as planets around young stars do. Two of the bodies survived and reached an almost resonance. These are the observed Earth-like planets.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I infer that at the time the gaseous accretion disk was formed around the core, the planetary nebula was still in formation, since the high temperatures of the core must have ionized the surrounding gas, at least for a few thousand years.</p>

<p>I understand that the gas that is expelled from the interior of a dying star in its red giant phase does so at several kilometers per second. My question is: why the gaseous accretion disk that formed around the core was not immediately ejected into space as was the case with the gas from the nascent planetary nebula? Why was it gravitationally tied to the core while the surrounding gas was escaping from gravity?</p>

"Which are stars and which are noise in this comet photo?","<p>The Forbes news article <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanocallaghan/2019/10/14/nasas-hubble-telescope-snaps-best-images-yet-of-our-first-interstellar-comet/#6740b20a26cb"" rel=""noreferrer"">NASA's Hubble Telescope Snaps Best Images Yet Of Our First Interstellar Comet</a> shows the image below (which I have since annotated) of comet 2I/Borisov (C/2019 Q4) and links to this series of Hubble images: <a href=""https://archive.stsci.edu/proposal_search.php?mission=hst&amp;id=16009"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://archive.stsci.edu/proposal_search.php?mission=hst&amp;id=16009</a></p>

<p>Looking through the previews of those images, they all seem to have streaks of similar length and direction, so I am assuming that the telescope is tracking the comet's motion in each exposure and the streaks are stars, suggesting that all the small dots are noise and not stars.</p>

"Calculating historical star maps from proper motion","<p>I'm working on some software which needs to calculate the position of stars and galaxies visible to the naked eye at different periods of human history.</p>

<p>The <a href=""http://tdc-www.harvard.edu/catalogs/bsc5.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Yale Bright Star Catalogue</a> gives the position and proper motion of visible stars.</p>

<p>Is calculating the historic positions simply a matter of multiplying each stars proper motion by the number of years between the date in question and the epoch, then subtracting the result from the position?</p>

<p>If so how far back in history could one go with this method and still produce a map that resembles what a human would observe with the naked eye? Would this method alone be sufficient to go back as far as 5000 years or are the other factors in play here that would need to be accounted for to make this accurate?</p>

<p>My criteria for ""accurate"" here is that a human observer wouldn't see a noticeable difference between the map and the night sky with the naked eye. Smaller inaccuracies are tolerable.</p>

"Are there equations to simulate creation of a solar system?","<p>I've been wanting to create a simulator to run tests based on properties of a star to find patterns in how planets form. Are there any already made equations for any of these countless relationships? Here are a few examples to further explain what sort of information I am looking for.</p>

<p>For example, how does the mass of a star relate to the distance of the frost line, and is there an already existing equation to estimate this?</p>

<p>More general example; If I wanted to find out how to estimate, say, a planets surface temperature based on a stars temperature and distance, what is the best way to do this?</p>

<p>Another example; To find the most likely average mass of a potential planet, what information would I need? Distance to star? Stars mass? Distance to nearest planets?</p>

<p>Another; How would I go about finding likely measurements of compositions of any hypothetical planets (surface/atmosphere/etc)</p>

<p>Absolutely any information is very welcome. I do not require any form of proven or precise measurements. If there is no equations, then all I need is what factors are involved in specific attribute development.</p>
