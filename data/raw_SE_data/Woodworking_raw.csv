"What is an accurate and safe way to piece together wood with a rhombus cross section?","<p>I am interested in making a bunch of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penrose_tiling#Rhombus_tiling_.28P3.29"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Penrose tiles</a>.  </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/GWII6.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/GWII6.png"" alt=""penrose""></a></p>

<p>Please note that the triangles and half circle on the figures shouldn't be there, they are for alignment purposes only.</p>

<p>One of the tiles is a rhombus with corners of 36, 144, 36 and 144 degrees.  I am looking for the community's ideas on how to make a piece of wood with this cross section.  Lets say the sides are 1.5"".  I have a table saw, jointer, planar, router and access to most of the other tools.  Accuracy is important.  Any ideas and suggestion are appreciated.</p>

<p>Edit #1.  I really appreciate all the responses.  This seams like a great stack exchange.</p>

<p>The process I was envisioning was the following.  Get a 6' piece of stock with the correct cross section, then use a band saw to cut off the individual tiles to correct thickness.  Aside from the difficulty in getting the correct cross section, are there other issues / problems with this approach?</p>

<p>Edit #2
I found this approach on YouTube to cute acute angles.  Does <a href=""https://youtu.be/m2gl9OEW8tg?t=245/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"" title=""this"">this</a> seems safe and accurate?  </p>

"Issue sanding between coats of polyurethane","<p>So I am playing with finishes for the first time and experimenting with polyurethane. My problem involves quoting the instructions on the can and giving some background into my process. Bear with me.</p>

<p>From other answers on WW I understand that applying only a few coats of poly can be <em>sufficient</em> but traditionally you could use as many as 21 over the course a year. Since I don't need an exercise in futility I opted for 3 coats.</p>

<p>I did 2, what I thought were, thin coats 3 days apart and the last one was 2 days previous to now. I did not sand between coats; again because it is not <em>required</em> between coats (Again based on other answers required).</p>

<p>Referencing steps from the directions on the can and the <a href=""http://www.minwax.ca/wood-products/interior-clear-protective-finishes/minwax-fastdrying-polyurethane"" rel=""noreferrer"">Minwax website</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <ol start=""4"">
  <li><p>Apply a <strong>THIN coat</strong> of MinwaxÂ® Fast-Drying Polyurethane using a high-quality natural or foam brush.</p></li>
  <li><p>Let dry 4-6 hours. Then lightly sand entire surface with <strong>fine sandpaper (220 grit)</strong> to ensure an even finish and proper adhesion. Remove all dust. </p></li>
  <li><p>Apply second coat. If third coat is desired, repeat step 5 before application.</p></li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Aside from the lack of sanding between coats I adhered to the instructions rather well.</p>

<p>I left the table to cure in my shed. Issue with that was my shed seems to have become a haven for <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxelder_bug"" rel=""noreferrer"">boxelder bugs</a>. Which would be an issue except they pissed on the table in several places. Some of it just chips off but I needed to sand out several of them. Sanding with 220 grit with only a few passes it looks like I sanded through the two coats down to wood!?</p>

<p>Why would they suggest I sand with that grit if it takes away the coats to begin with? Obviously they didn't intend for that to happen and I am doing something I am not supposed to do. Should I have used a finer grit? Are my poly coats to thin?</p>

"Is there a safe way to make a plunge cut with a chainsaw?","<p>Having looked up chainsaw safety videos on the internet it seems that a big danger with chainsaws is kickback - where the tip of the chainsaw contacts something unexpected and throws the blade back up towards the users head/neck.</p>

"Design considerations for a machinist's work bench","<p>I am considering hiring a cabinet maker to construct a built-in workbench for machine work and would like to know the key design considerations and recommended jointing options for such a project.</p>

<p>The table would be mounted to a stone wall in the back and one side and have two legs. I envision using something like white oak 4x4s for the legs and having a 3"" or 4"" hard maple top. It has to be able to mount a large vise. I have seen Sjosberg benches but they are not really appropriate since they are designed for wood work, not machine work and blacksmithing.</p>

<p>What would be a recommended way of constructing the maple top and joining it to the legs?</p>

"How do I cut a large log into boards?","<p>An acquaintance was clearing some trees from his land, and I asked him to save a section of big leaf maple so I could mill it for an electric guitar. </p>

<p>The piece ended up being roughly 9"" x 9"" x 36"". I figured I'd let it dry then saw into boards. Now, about a year later (and after learning much more about woodworking), I realize I should have had it milled before drying. It has cracked some as it dried, but should still be usable.</p>

<p>My problem now is I don't know how to go about milling it. It's bigger than I had asked for and I don't have the tools to break it down.</p>

<p>Here is what I have:</p>

<ul>
<li>Circular saw (7.5"")</li>
<li>My grandpa has a 10"" table saw</li>
<li>Handsaw (18-24"")</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm not sure I like either of those options. Seems like the blade could bind, and while the piece is too heavy to kick back on a table saw, it could burn up the motor, or toss the circular/break my wrist.</p>

<p>Do I chalk this up to beginner's mistake and scrap the idea, or is there something I could still try (bandsaw, chainsaw, etc.)?</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> This question is different from <a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/q/1144/49"">What is the process, from start to finish, for milling a tree into boards?</a> in that this question is about milling a chunk of wood that is small enough not to require or justify the size of tool (e.g., bandsaw mill or chainsaw mill) which is usually used to mill large tree trunks. As @bowlturner pointed out in a comment, it also may be too small for some such mills.</p>

"Am I able to make a wooden Zero Clearance Insert for my tablesaw?","<p>After watching more videos about table saws I got excited and wanted to make a ZCI. When I looked at my saw the current insert gave <em>way</em> too much room. I had lost some wood down there on one occasion and was worried about kickback. </p>

<p>I took off the cheap flimsy plastic, that was starting to bow, only to find this:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/GoXHT.jpg"" alt=""Blade housing"">
<sup>Note: The ""tab"" on the right looks more recessed than it actually is</sup></p>

<p>The place where the potential ZCI would rest is between 1/8th - 3/16ths of an inch from the table (both tabs are not equal distances from the table). That would mean for a very thin piece of the board at those locations. That would likely snap when it got some pressure. Also the side of the gap facing the blade (that you cant see in this picture) tapers at a 45 degree angle. I could see sawdust or, if nothing else, debris getting in there.</p>

<p>All the good ZCI's that I see are one unit and I don't see how I could do that with this setup. </p>

<p>Can I safely make a <em>wooden</em> ZCI for this table saw? Would I need to mill one from metal to get the same effect?</p>

"Would a thick riving knife be useful with a dado stack?","<p>As I understand it, a riving knife prevents kickback by keeping the workpiece from pinching or being pushed into the back of the blade.</p>

<p>Pinching the blade is unlikely to happen with non-through cuts, which all dado cuts are, but the workpiece could still theoretically be pushed askew and contact the back of the blade.</p>

<p>Would a riving knife with the same thickness as the kerf of the dado stack prevent this? Or are non-through cuts just not as dependent on a riving knife for safety?</p>

But say I have a 8' board, and I want it in half (roughly 4' each, minus the kerf), how do I quickly measure/cut this? Ideally the result would have no waste.</p>

<p>Do I just align the blade with the line and cut directly on it, or do I need to measure the blade kerf and account for this somehow?</p>

"When are pocket holes an appropriate joinery technique?","<p>I have come across a lot of designs and plans for things like outdoor furniture, kids' furniture, etc., that call for the use of pocket holes.

<p>Matthias Wandel has an article on <a href=""https://woodgears.ca/joint_strength/pockethole.html"">Testing pocket holes against mortise and tenon and dowel joints</a> where he finds that they are indeed significantly weaker than other joint types.</p>

<p>Are there any times when this is an appropriate joinery technique to use, over alternatives? Or are they just typically used when someone doesn't have the skill, time (or maybe cost) to build a more robust joint?</p>

"Do I need to worry about wood dust for very small-scale manual sanding?","<p>I have recently discovered carving as a very relaxing and pleasant hobby. From small branches of wood I whittle hair-sticks with interesting shapes (the kind of object you use to put long hair up) with small knives and use sandpaper (by hand) of various grits to even out the shape, make the surface smoother and shinier. I like to do the sanding outside, but I do it in my living room sometimes.</p>

<p>I was never concerned about the safety of using sandpaper (at least manually) until I stumbled upon the subject somewhere on the web. Virtually everybody recommends using dust masks when sanding wood, but it seems that people generally refer to using power tools on large-ish things like pieces of furniture..?</p>

<p>I am generally very (and sometimes over-)concerned about my health. On the one hand the amount of dust generated by finishing hair sticks seems very much insignificant compared to what kinds or techniques of woodworking are commonly assumed, but on the other what do I know, really! I have been uneasy working on the sticks since I read all the horror stories.</p>

"Is making this picture frame do-able?","<p>My wife would like me to build her a picture frame, but she has some requirements.</p>

<li>She wants the visible portion of the frame to be no more than 1/4"" wide.</li>

<p>Now, here's my reservations with this....</p>

<ol>
<li>If the visible portion of the frame is 1/4"" wide, that means the rabbet holding the picture/glass would be around 1/8"" - is this enough material to support the picture/glass?</li>
<li>Again, if the rabbet is 1/8"" - That's REALLY thin material spanning from the front of the frame to the back of the frame.  I picture this not being thick enough to prevent breaking.</li>
<li>I don't know if I have the tools and expertise to cut pieces this thin...  A 1/4"" piece with a 1/8"" rabbet?</li>
</ol>

<p>My only possible solutions for this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Use PVC trim pieces.  They may be able to withstand forces better, being only 1/8"" thick.</li>
<li>Build the frame without a rabbet.  Use a router and a slot cutting bit to route out a slot in the frame - it doesn't necessarily need to be 1/8"" - just enough to keep the picture held in.  Fashion a slot at the top of the frame.  Instead of setting the picture in from the back, I'd drop it in from the top, which wouldn't be visible.</li>

The wood I'm currently planning on using is 100mmx100mm 5th grade Scandinavian redwood for the 4 legs and then 50mmx100mm white fir for everything else (side note: could I get away with using the white fir for everything? The 100x100 legs are a significant expense which I figured is probably necessary but I'd love for someone to tell me I'm wrong hahaha) The length of the bed will be 190cm, width will be 135cm and height will be 136cm. The stupidly colourful diagrams below represent the corner joints - 1 is a birds eye view of the joint where the yellow is the leg, red is the rail and blue is the stretcher. 2 shows the view of the joint from the front and 3 is from the left (both with screws/bolts). For the middle stretchers I thought I'd just do a lap joint. I wasn't sure whether I should be using screws or bolts for this, is there generally a better or more appropriate choice of those two? I'm also still unsure on how best to join the horizontal and diagonal supports.</p>

<p>I know adding another horizontal support on the left side would increase stability as would adding a diagonal on the back - these are things I'm open to doing but would prefer to not as I have a wardrobe/chest of drawers on the left so a horizontal beam would be slightly inconvenient, and there's a window at the back which I'd prefer not to block with another diagonal if at all possible. Do you think these things are necessary or can I get away without them?</p>

<li><p>I can't drill into the walls as I'm renting</p></li>
<li><p>If possible I'd like to avoid using glue so I can take it apart when I have to move out and take it with me</p></li>

<p>My first thought was there would be some minimum thickness ""stopper"" that could be locked in for a given project, and then I could start shaving a bit off a handful of boards until they reached that thickness.</p>

<p>It appears this and other planers don't offer such a feature (or have I just not found it)?</p>

<p>Thinking about another way to achieve the goal: it seems I could pass all boards through, lower the height of the cutter head, pass them all through again, lower again, and so on, with the final height being the same. That way seems like more work-especially if the starting thicknesses are significantly different.</p>

"Sourcing Wood for non-commercial DIY Projects","<p>Now to be honest this is specific to the UK, which if this site is anything like StackOverflow, means my question will soon be closed as ""too localised"".

1) Set a small material removal (let's say 1mm above the table surface).</p>

<p>2) Set up a stop block on the left part of the fence not to cut through.</p>

<p>3) Set a feather stops before and after the bit to prevent kickback (as the detail I'm going to cut is quite small)</p>

<p>4) Enable the router, push the detail through from the right side until it reaches the stop block</p>

"Sharpening Stones for Chisels and Planes (the 1000th time)","<p>A form of this question has, no doubt, been asked a 1,000 times, but I need some specific guidance.</p>

<p>As and early Father's Day present, my wife bought me a <a href=""https://www.sharpeningsupplies.com/Veritas-Mk-II-Honing-Guide-P257.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Veritas Mk. II Honing Guide</a>. Maybe this little dude is overkill (maybe not, tho), as I have never sharpened anything in my life, but I have been fooling around with chisels and not a one has been sharper than a table knife's edge. So, I'm pretty excited!</p>

<p>Of course, a honing guide has to have sharpening stones, and that gets me to the root of my questions.</p>

<p>My daughters bought a Naniwa Economical Waterstone (3000 Grit) and a Naniwa Flattening Stone to go long with the Veritas. In the mean time, a friend gave me a BearMoo 3000/8000 whetstone. (Boy is there a great difference between BearMoo and Naniwa -- the latter kicks the bear's butt.)</p>

<p>Now, the chisels I have are mostly from the early 20th century. Some have been used by my forefathers and others by heavens only knows who. Consequently, their bevels are mostly off by several degrees and none has a micro bevel. That in mind, I'm sure a 3,000-grit waterstone isn't going to cut it. </p>

<p>...which leaves me to wonder what stones I should buy, keeping in mind I can't break the bank on this purchase ($200)? I've been kicking around and come up with a plan, and I'd like some input on prospective/current sharpening media:</p>

<ul>
<li>Buy four DMT 6"" Diamond Whetstones, the very course, course, fine, and extra fine. I believe these are 60, 45, 25, and 9 microns, equivalent to 220, ~300, ~400, and 1,000 grit waterstones. (I used
<a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/13stlsCQREmirBSZmzkCjpQ0H8HrZ07FR/view?usp=sharing"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this chart</a> to determine rough equivalences between different media and their grits.)</li>
<li>Use my 3,000-grit Naniwa and 8,000-grit BearMoo waterstones</li>
<li>Use a buffalo-hide strop with green compound. (I bought this a little while back for a different reason than sharpening chisels and plane blades, but it should work, right?)</li>
</ul>

<p>I like the idea of diamond whetstones because they don't need flattening, and I hear they take off metal more quickly than a waterstone would. They seem ideal for getting my chisel bevels to the correct angle. </p>

<p>The DMT stones are on sale so I can get those for ~$120 for the group of four. If I bought them separately, they are roughly $50 per stone. However, the span of ""grit sizes"" seems awfully close together. I've not found any article that recommends going from 220 to 300 to 400 grit when sharpening chisel/plane blades, but maybe the ""equivalense"" chart is wrong about the comparison between microns and grit sizes.</p>

<p>If I were to buy just the 220/300-grit equivalent diamond stone, should I also get the 9-micron (1000-grit) diamond stone or would a Naniwa 1,000-grit waterstone be better? It seems like I would need one or the other.</p>

<p>I think the 3,000-grit, 8,000-grit waterstones and leather strop are all used for honing the blade. Since I already have these in hand, they are part of the ""plan."" I asssume I would go through the 3,000-grit waterstone when creating my primary bevel; however, do I need to use all three when finishing off my micro bevel?</p>

<p>Thanks for any insight/opinions. I'm really starting to feel overwhelmed by all the choices.</p>

"Working with Green wood","<p>Some friends of mine are getting married in the fall and I want to make them something more unique than a set of martini glasses.</p>

<p>I got this idea to make bookends for them out of solid blocks of green wood--something simple as I'm a relative novice, likely either cubes 4"" or so, or maybe longer blocks or rounds from a branch. My thinking is that as the wood dries, it will crack/warp, revealing a character that's unique to the block of wood and the environment in which it is kept. My basic question is, will this work?</p>

<p>I've never worked with green wood before and so I have a couple other questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Will blocks that big change the way I want them to? I understand that thinner boards will warp and crack, but will the changes on something this thick (4+ inches) be noticeable?</li>
<li>Are there certain features of the wood (grain, location in the log, etc) that I should look for when picking out blocks to shape? Is there a way to sort of predict how the wood will change as it dries (everything I've seen is for planks, but I want to use something thicker)?</li>
<li>Do certain woods have more movement than others? I'm located in the mid-Atlantic, and ideally it'd be something native to the region.</li>
<li>Ideally, these pieces would be something that are constantly changing over the life of my friends' marriage, but I know that at some point the wood will become stable. Is there any way to slow the drying process down so that it takes years instead of months?  </li>
<li>Has anyone done this sort of thing or worked with green wood and can give me some pointers/tips?  </li>

"Glue-up for butcher block-style countertop","<h2>Background</h2>

<p>I am working on a butcher block style countertop / tabletop, and am wondering how best to glue the wood together.  The countertop is unfinished maple hardwood floor, with the tongue / groove cut off, flipped on its side.  So, the final result will be about 1 3/4"" thick, mostly quarter sawn, 3/4"" width strips.  The final countertop will be 7' long and 20"" wide, with the wood running lengthwise.</p>

<p>(To clarify: I am calling it a tabletop / countertop, as I am not quite sure what to call it.  It will be installed on top of a half-height wall between the kitchen and hallway, and will be used as extra counter space, a serving area, and a 'breakfast bar'.  For extra support it will have three steel beams on the underside, with grooves for screws to allow for a bit of expansion across grain.  The ends will be finished with a breadboard end joint, although that is outside the scope of this question.)</p>

<p>For illustrative purposes, this is somewhat how the tabletop will look.  Each strip is 3/4"" wide:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/1dTKz.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/1dTKz.png"" alt=""Top view of table top""></a></p>

<p>I plan on the glued-up tabletop being longer than 7', and then trimming to length.</p>

<p>I will be using Titebond 3.</p>

<h2>Question</h2>

<p>My question is how to do the glue-up in such a way as to eliminate any gaps where I glue the strips end-to-end in a given row.  I am obviously going to be clamping width-wise (across the 20"" side), but am not sure how to clamp each row length-wise (across the 7' side).  I hope to do a handful of rows at a time (maybe 5 or so?), let them dry, then add more on.</p>

<h2>Some Possibilities</h2>

<p>Some possible answers I have come up with:</p>

<ol>
<li>Make a clamping block that includes some sort of padding (styrofoam?) underneath a solid board, so that you can clamp 5-ish rows at a time without applying pressure only to the longest one.  My concern here is that I don't think styrofoam would provide enough pressure.</li>
<li>Just push the rows together end-to-end while I am doing the side-to-side clamping, and rely on the side-to-side clamps to prevent any movement.  I don't think that this will work, as glue-ups are always slippery.</li>
<li>Use a strip of rubber innertube that I use for guitar body glue-ups and individually wrap it around each row.  This is the most promising approach so far, IMHO - the rubber strip is very long, and should have no problems wrapping around the length of it 4 - 5 times.  My concern here is that I won't have time to get it wrapped up before the glue has started to set.  I suppose that starting with just a couple of rows to make sure I have time will be the answer there.</li>
</ol>

<p>Thanks in advance for any suggestions!</p>

<p>Cheers</p>

<h2>Edit after completion</h2>

<p>Thanks to all the responders, I did the glue-up and things are looking good.  A few comments, in case it helps people in the future:</p>

<ol>
<li>5 at a time was way too many.  3 was borderline too many; I found that 2 worked best.</li>
<li>You need to plan your layout before gluing anything.  I laid out all the pieces to ensure that the butt joints were not aligned or too close to each other.</li>
<li>I tested my first few end joint cuts for 90 degree, and they were perfect.  Unfortunately at some point after the first ones my miter saw must have gone out of square, and the later ones were slightly off.  Nothing too big, but enough for a 1/16 - 1/32"" gap in some places.  Sigh.  Wood filler has worked well for this though.</li>
<li>As hard as I tried, I was unable to get the glue-up to be perfectly flat initially.  Some of the boards were slightly higher / lower than the others (not too bad, the worst was less than 1/8"", probably closer to 1/16"").  This meant that I needed to plane more than I would have liked.</li>
<li>On the topic of planing, I got the surfaces flat with a toothed hand plane.  Only after it was flat did I use a belt sander to make it smooth.  My limited belt sander skills would not allow for me to get the surface flat if I had just used the sander... maybe others are better with the sander, but for me the plane was the way to go.  The toothed iron helped to avoid most of the tearout (laminations are very hard to plane due to the grain going every different direction).</li>
<li>I did not end up using the steel bars - as commented by Martin, this this is already a beast.  The breadboard ends will help to prevent warping over time, and from a strength POV I could jump on it without it moving at all.</li>
</ol>

"How to re-seal a kitchen chair seat","<p>Long story short here of several rookie mistakes that have led me to this question...I have a couple of kitchen chairs that I refinished recently. I chalk-painted everything but the seats, and left the seats as-is, leaving the wood unpainted. I was not smart enough to cover the seats while I painted the rest of the chairs, and a few paint flecks got onto the seats. </p>

<p>Mistake number 2 was using a Mr. Clean Magic Eraser to try to get the paint off, which ended up just stripping the finish of the wood right off. </p>

<p>Mistake #3 was trying to bring the sheen of the seats back to life with boiled linseed oil. It never cured and stayed sticky for days on end, so I finally took it off with turpentine, which ended up taking the rest of the chairs' original finish off along with the BLO. </p>

<p>So here I am, with dull, unfinished chair seats, all because I didn't cover the chairs to begin with!! What's my next step? I would like to be able to just spray on some sort of clear sealant, since the surface area of the seats is small and I feel like painting on a new finish will only lead me to more imperfections. </p>

"Should I seal my bed slats, and if yes, with what?","<p>I hired someone to put together bed slats for my new bed. The bed frame comes with center support for the slats that he's building and the slats will be screwed down onto the center slat and the side rails of the bed frame.

"How do I use a handplane to smooth a cutting board?","<p>I've never used a hand plane before, but recently decided to give hand planing a go.  I purchased a Lie-Nielsen No. 5 Jack Plane.  For a project to experiment with, I threw together a simple long grain cutting board made with alternating maple and walnut - smoothed first through a machine surface planer.  </p>

<p>I had this idea that I would be able to run the hand plane over the surface of the (already smooth) cutting board and peel off whisper-thin shavings.  Especially with a new plane and a new blade.  Unfortunately, I can't find the sweet-spot between ""the blade's not even touch the wood"" and ""there's no coming back from a gouge that deep...""  </p>

<p>So where do I go from here?  Is my flaw entirely technique and I just need to keep practicing?  Or does an out-of-the-box blade need to be ""sharpened"" first?  Maybe just a tool setup issue? Or, have I selected an inherently difficult practice project  (or inherently difficult for a jack plane)?  </p>

"Are there alternative tools to a straight ironing rasp (or why are they so hard to find)?","<p>I'm looking for a tool to smooth/flatten down a surface in a rectangular channel in the center of a piece of wood (I constructed the piece by gluing two halves together, but stupidly didn't clean the channel halves well prior to gluing).  The channel measures ~1"" wide x 2"" long x 8"" deep (you can think of it as an 8"" deep mortise).  It's roughly square, but needs a lot of help.  Only one surface actually needs to be flat/smooth.</p>

<p>The best tool that comes to mind for the job is a file or rasp, but I need the handle offset so that it can actually get in the channel (the piece's construction is such that without an offset handle I wouldn't be able to put the face of the tool against the surface of the wood).  Alternatively if there were a way for me to sand inside the channel that would work too, but I'm unfamiliar with any way to get sand paper in a channel that deep/narrow.  </p>

<p>After a ton of searching for things like ""crank necked rasp"" and ""offset handle file"" I finally learned that there is a name for what I think is my dream tool: straight ironing rasp.  This, for example, looks great:</p>

This <a href=""http://lumberjocks.com/reviews/product/249"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">link</a> implies that Auriou used to make a straight one, but now I can't seem to find it anywhere.

"Router tears wood, leaves streaks","<p>I bought a router and am practicing. When I cut across the grain (actually, it does not matter, see ""conclusion"") I noticed that sometimes it tears bits of the wood out. For example, here are two ends of the same piece of 3/4"" pine:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/C1WYV.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/C1WYV.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Both ends were cut by me but on the bottom you can see the rough cut. This is a hand held 1.5 hp router at ~20000 rpms using a straight blade with 2 flutes. The blade is 3/8"" diameter and I removed about 1/8"" of uneven material. I used the router base against a clamped piece of wood as a guide. The feed direction was against the blade rotation.</p>

<p>Why is this happening and can I avoid it? Did the router actually rip those bits out or do those pockets already exist in the wood? Is it a problem with my technique, wood quality, or just a normal unavoidable thing?</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion (Probably)</strong></p>

<p>Following CoAstroGeek's answer I inspected my equipment and tried more consistent cuts to repeat the problem.</p>

<p>I sawed away a portion of the wood near the tear and verified that it was not an internal defect, it looks like I did the damage:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Pzp7I.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Pzp7I.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>I then cut material off in the same way as above using all four straight bits from the same set, increasing diameter each time. I kept my speed more consistent this time and tried to go a bit faster. Cuts were made right to left in images below. Looking closely, even though I did not have tearing as above, the results are very poor (I burned the first one a lot cutting off too much material, so I couldn't move quickly):</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/hULjc.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/hULjc.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>The second bit was OK. The third is the one I was using in the original images. The streaks are in the same positions as the tears. This is probably not coincidence. All four blades also leave light horizontal streaks the whole way down, which I initially attributed to sanding.</p>

<p>Also while I thought my cuts along the grains had no issues, on closer inspection there is still notching:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/uwkJi.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/uwkJi.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>When I inspected each bit under a magnifying glass, one of the flutes was slightly chipped or dented at the location of every deep scratch. I could not determine the cause of the lighter more frequent scratches. </p>

<p>I tried similar experiments with my other bits, not part of this set and from a different manufacturer, and none had any of these issues.</p>

<p>The general conclusion is this set of bits is probably just crap. It was fairly cheap. It also taught me that I should be very careful when storing bits because even small defects can ruin a cut. I do not know if the dents are manufacturing defects or damage to the bits done by me in storage (all of the bits used were brand new before this post). Time to go shopping.</p>

"Can I apply polyurethane over oil before oil cures?","<p>Specifically I am wondering about polyurethane (Rustoleum Ultimate) over boiled linseed oil, but in general polyurethane or other top coats with similar chemistry over any drying oil.</p>

<p>Question is: Can I apply polyurethane over an oil before the oil completely cures or do I have to wait?</p>

<p>I looked up linseed oil on Wikipedia and it led me to <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drying_oil"">drying oils</a>. These oils polymerize by reacting with ambient O2. I also attempted to research the curing process of polyurethane but discovered there are many different types with many different uses, so it was difficult to find info. I <em>think</em> they cure by reacting with ambient moisture.</p>

<p>My knowledge of chemistry is too limited to be able to understand if polyurethane would allow O2 to pass through to react with the undercoating of oil as it cures.</p>

<p>The other random bit of info that I found is that <a href=""http://www.rustoleum.com/MSDS/ENGLISH/260163.pdf"">Rustoleum Ultimate polyurethane primarily consists of</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://msdssearch.dow.com/PublishedLiteratureDOWCOM/dh_00fc/0901b803800fc0f9.pdf?filepath=productsafety/pdfs/noreg/233-00468.pdf&amp;fromPage=GetDoc"">Dipropylene Glycol Monomethyl Ether</a> (DPM)</li>
<li><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-Methyl-2-pyrrolidone"">Methyl-n 2-Pyrrolidone</a> (NMP)</li>
</ul>

<p>Neither of which I understand. I reached the conclusion that they are moisture cured from <a href=""http://www.garlandco.com/educational/ytr/catching-polyurethane-train.html"">this article</a> although it concerned types of polyurethane used on metal. Not sure if it's the same as wood.</p>

<p>So, can I apply polyurethane before the BLO cures? Will it continue curing underneath? Or do I have to wait? If I do have to wait, what will happen if I don't? Is it different for an oil-based polyurethane (it looks like the Rustoleum one is water-based)?</p>

<p>Before I do, I'd like to know if there's an easier or more effective way to do this. They're being made from 1/2"" oak dowels (straight from a big box store), about a foot or so long:</p>

<p>I didn't want to use a lathe, mainly because it's so thin in some areas. So, I ended up using the outer edge of a disc sander to shape most of it. It was somewhat tedious, and it's not as symmetrical and ""smooth"" as I'd like. There's also a limit on the angle/shape of ""cuts"", since I can only hold it to the sander at so much of an angle.</p>

<p>They would all be a bit differently shaped, with varying handle sizes, groove locations, etc. So I'm guessing anything that uses some sort of shaped jig wouldn't work.</p>

"How thick do slabs need to be in a slab bench?","<p>My cousin's fiancee is looking to build a bench for their kitchen. From his description, it sounds like what I would call a ""slab bench."" Just three thick slabs of wood, two for legs and one long one (about 60 inches he said). He hasn't decided on a wood. I recommended hardwood, but in retrospect given the thickness of the slabs, I think it might actually be worth trying in pine.</p>

<p>I told him I would typically use a frame or angle braces to prevent the seat from bowing and to make a rigid connection from the legs to the seat, but if it's a thick enough slab maybe that wouldn't be an issue:
<em>Is a 3-4 inch thick slab enough that it won't noticeably bow?</em></p>

<p>If they were to not use angle braces or a frame (i.e. there are only 3 members, no supporting structure), <em>how should I connect the legs</em>? I thought maybe just a really big mortise and tenon for each leg would do it, but I'm still concerned about it being weak. Should I just tell them to suck it up and reinforce the connections?</p>

<p><strong>edit</strong>
I've been provided with a reference picture of what he's looking at. It looks like it's just reclaimed 4x4 lumber with a miter, ... maybe biscuits or something as well, but no braces or anything.</p>

"Is it safe to resaw on a table saw?","<p>I have been under the impression that if you want to resaw lumber, the tool of choice is a bandsaw. I don't have a bandsaw, but I do have a contractor-style table saw. However, I have read elsewhere that it isn't safe to resaw lumber on a table saw.</p>

<p>But looking through Mathias Wandel's site, I found a couple places where he resaws lumber using his table saw; like <a href=""http://woodgears.ca/box/small.html"">here</a>, for example.</p>

<p>Is this considered safe? If so, what are the rules of resawing on a table saw? I presume I should treat it like a rip cut. Is there a minimum safe length of board, where going shorter would become unsafe? Are there other safety considerations specific to resawing I'm not aware of?

"Leveling a finish/finishing the finish","<p>I'm using Emmet's Good Stuff (poly gel varnish that you wipe on) as a finish on a walnut slab.  I've read a lot about finishing online, but am a little confused about ""leveling the finish.""  As I understand it poly varnish requires some minor abrasion between coats for good adhesion.  The guy at my local woodworking store told me to use 320 to accomplish this as well as to knock out any streaks left by my application rag, dust nibs, etc in between coats.  I take it that this is not the ""leveling step"" described in sources like Flexner's ""Understanding Wood Finishing"" and is really more of a very light hit with 320 so as not to ""bust through"" the finish?  How many coats of finish should you put on before ""leveling""?  As I understand it ""leveling"" means sanding (possibly wet sanding with ~320 grit) until the entire surface is at an even sheen, which presumably requires some amount of build up or else you're going through to the wood.</p>

<p>Flexner's book (page 156 -- ""Brushing Varnish"") says: ""brush on the first coat....sand the surface lightly with 280-grit or finer...apply the next coat...sand the surface lightly with 320-grit or finer sterated sandpaper...If you're trying to achieve a perfect or near-perfect flat surface, sand out the brush marks after the next-to-last coat...use 320-or 400-grit wet/dry sandpaper lubricated with soap and water or mineral spirits.  The last coat will then level better.""</p>

<p>Does that mean that if you apply, for example, 5 coats of finish that you sand the first one with 280, the next one with 320, don't sand the next one at all, wet sand the 4th coat, and polish the final 5th coat?  If you apply 7 coats would that imply two more coats with no sanding/abrasion at all?</p>

<p>On a related note his book also warns about ghosting or going through one layer to another.  If you're leveling a surface, which has brush marks in it are you not -- by definition -- taking off more material in some places than others, which means that you must be intentionally ghosting in certain spots?  </p>

<p>After leveling I take it the next step is polishing/rubbing, which can be done with things like abralon discs and the like.  Is that typically done on the leveled surface or on yet another coat over the leveled surface?</p>

"Alternatives to grip tape on a longboard","<p>Making my first longboard, and I'd like to put some art on top of it.

<p>Are there any potential structural, construction, or even aesthetic issues with this design?  I am aware that in a perfect world the wood grain should run at an angle down the legs to maximize strength, but given than I'm cutting this out of a single slab that's not possible.  The legs are just under 2"" at their thinnest point, which I believe should be sufficient to hold the bench and users?</p>

<p>This slab is approximately 1.5"" thick, kiln-dried Cherry (approximately 7% moisture content).  I am attempting to utilize as much of the natural edge as possible so the edges will not be cut straight; bark will be removed completely and the edges lightly sanded.  Epoxy will be used to fill the cracks.</p>

<p>The armrest will be heavily sanded on each side to provided rounded edges for comfort, and is approximately 1"".  The seatback posts are sloped back at a 5 degree angle and approximately 2"" at their thinnest point.</p>

<p>The underside of the seat will have two pressure treated 2x4s running the length and attached to the side pieces.  An additional scrap piece of slab (approximately 1.5"" x 3"") will be run at the lowest center point to provide additional lateral stability.</p>

"Wood conditioner then stain then oil?","<p>Iâm about to finish my first woodworking project, itâs a tv stand made from 2x4s. Iâve been doing some research on finishing but canât find an exact answer. Iâve seen that a wood conditioner should be used first to get a consistent blotch free stain finish.

"Considerations for cordless circular saw blades - effects of kerf, coating and geometry on performance?","<p>I recently acquired a low-budget ($80) 18V cordless,  hand-held circular saw. The saw came with a low-budget 18-teeth ripping blade. I intend to use it mostly for cross-cutting  wood planks, and cutting thin (at most 18mm (2/3ââ)) plywood and laminated particleboard for making simple furniture: shelves, boxes etc. I might want to use it occasionally on other materials (plastic, aluminum), but wood and engineered wood are the main applications. Iâm aware of the limitations of this tool, and I can live with a bit of sanding, if I have to.</p>

<p>I am looking for an optimal cross-cut/general purpose blade in order to achieve the smoothest possible cuts given the limits of this machine. The tool is very small, the maximum blade diameter is 150mm (6ââ). Few manufacturers produce this blade size, so given my location and budget, my options seem to be limited to the following:</p>

<p>(kerf/blade thickness, no. of teeth, geometry+hook angle, ânon-stickâ coating, price (all dim. in mm))</p>

<p>More expensive:
no1 (3.2/2.2, 48 teeth, ATB +15, coated, $45); </p>

<p>no2 (3.2/2.2, 36 teeth, ATB +15, coated, $42);</p>

<p>no3 (2.6/1.6, 36 teeth, ATB +10, coated, $43.5) thin kerf</p>

<p>Cheaper:
no4 (2.4/1.4, 36 teeth, ATB +15, not coated, $21)  - thinner kerf, not coated; </p>

<p>no5, multi material (2.0/1.4, 42T, HLTCG -5, not coated, $27) â thin kerf, different geometry</p>

<p>My questions are the following:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>As far as I understand, increasing number of teeth, smaller (or negative) hook angle and larger kerf all increase the load on the sawâs motor. Should I be wary of an overload if I choose the âsmoothestâ blade (i.e. full kerf, 48 teeth)? Which of the factors listed above is the most important with respect to motor load/potential burning of the workpiece (kerf, geometry, hook angle, or no. of teeth)?</p></li>
<li><p>Does blade coating have a significant effect on performance (by reducing friction, which could be important given the low power of the tool)? Is this effect (and better materials) worth double the price?</p></li>
<li><p>Does anyone have any experience with ATB (Alternate Top Bevel) vs HLTCG (High-Low Triple Chip Grind) geometry? Would the negative-angle HLTCG blade result in better cuts on laminated particleboard, plywood, etc.? Is HLTCG significantly worse for other wood applications (i.e. is it specialized to composites and plastics)? Would it significantly increase loads on the motor, or does the thinner kerf of the Multi Material blade compensate for the negative hook angle?</p></li>

"Panel Flatness During Table Top Glue Up","<p>I recently attempted a panel glue up consisting of 7 2""x6""x6' planks of reclaimed yellow pine. The boards were planed flat on one side and edge jointed. All went well it seemed during the glue up (i.e., it was flat and tight along the seems). I glued it up in sections a couple of boards at a time over a couple of days. All went pretty well, then when I came back after the last section (3 boards), there was a pretty good bow running down the middle of the top - a hill on top, a valley on the underside running right down the middle. It was flat when I set up the last glue and clamps. Could the bow be because of over tightening the pipe clamps?</p>

<p>Glue up strategy was pipe clamps alternating on top and bottom every foot. I also used biscuits. </p>

<p>What else could have contributed to the bow?</p>

"Why are bed slats not attached?","<p>Planning a wooden bed frame. I am considering why bed slats I've seen seem to always just rest loosely on top of the frame rather than join to both sides. I know wood expands and contracts with heat/humidity but since the ends of the bed are also expanding and contracting in the same direction, why would these need to be separate? Perhaps it's for easy replacement as they more likely break. Maybe it's due to the weight of the mattress and occupants? If I made then of similar strength to the header and footer rails, I would think these problems would go away.</p>

"Smooth tree trunk cross section","<p>I have a big slab which is a cross section of a large tree trunk. The slab is about 10 inches thick and 3 feet in diameter, so it is large, heavy piece of wood. I cannot lift it. I moved to its current location by walking it. It took two men to load it into the car.</p>

<p>I want to smooth the top perfectly flat. The problem is that it is very rough cut and there are gashes by the chain saw. Trying to use a rasp to even it out would take forever.</p>

<p>Therefore I am thinking maybe to use a router. The problem is that I would need some kind of rail system to keep the router moving in a level plane over the surface. Also, what kind of bit would be used for doing something like this? Is there a better approach than using a router? If a router should be used, how can I move it X-Y and keep Z constant over a large surface?</p>

"Cloth covered flexible ring or a bag clamp in a dust collector?","<p>I recently acquired a dust collector, and it came with two ways of mounting the chip collection bag, but didn't explain why I would want to use one over the other in the assembly instructions.</p>

<p>The two mounting options I have are a cloth covered flexible ring or a big metal bag clamp that resembles a giant hose clamp.</p>

<p>The flexible ring is supposed to have the top 6"" of bag folded over it, and sits inside an internal groove in the dust collector and is held in by spring force and friction.</p>

<p>The bag clamp goes around the outside of the dust collector, with the bag in between the outer diameter and the bag clamp.</p>

In HomeDepot, I found a box of screws labeled as 'self-cutting' and bought it. But, when I opened the box and looked at the tip of the screws, I found that they had gaps on the threads (like <a href=""http://www.turnbolt.co.za/assets/images/THREAD-CUTTING.JPG"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this one</a>) </p>

"Chlorine bleach on poplar","<p>While experimenting with stains and struggling with a moderately green piece of poplar, I found that I really like the results of:</p>

<ol>
<li>Brush concentrated Clorox bleach, leave for 5 minutes then wipe. Let dry completely.</li>
<li>Sand lightly with 220 then wipe lightly with mineral spirits to clean, let dry completely.</li>
<li>Generous coat of minwax pre stain conditioner. Leave for 30 minutes without wiping excess (it all soaks in).</li>
<li>Generous coat of Varathane golden pecan stain. Leave for 5 minutes then lightly wipe excess.</li>
</ol>

<p>The conditioner makes minimal difference but the bleach really cleans up the greenish undertones and the color was great. It was almost the same as this stain on pine.</p>

<p>My question is: Clorox seems like a cruel thing to put on wood. It definitely changes the texture of poplar slightly. It feels ""dryer"" or something. Is doing this a mistake? What is the long term downside to bleaching poplar with chlorine bleach before staining it? (I brushed it on the surface, as opposed to outright soaking it, if that's significant. It seemed to have penetrated only about 1-2 mm.)</p>

<p>I have some oxalic acid coming too that I'm going to play with. Still it seems like it isn't the right thing to do.</p>

"What should one consider when purchasing an intro turning chisel set?","<p>I'm a total beginner when it comes to turning, but am interested in doing more of it both to help augment my woodworking (e.g. everything from custom button plugs to chair legs etc) as well as to do some traditional turning projects (e.g. pepper mill and maybe some small bowls).</p>

<p>I am struggling to understand what the differences are between the variety of chisel sets that are out there.  I understand more or less the different tools that I want, but I do not understand what characteristics of those tools I should care about and how/why price of the tools are driven.</p>

<p>Several folks out there seem to suggest that something like this  <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B000KI8CTS"">http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000KI8CTS</a> makes a great starter set.  Almost universally people seem to suggest/imply that ""better"" tools are important and worth the price difference.  Some people have gone so far as to say ""whatever you do don't get the ones made in China.""  Why not?  What's the difference (besides cost and it looks like slight size variations) between a set like that and, say, a set from Robert Sorby like this one: <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B00012X7LQ"">http://www.amazon.com/Robert-Sorby-H6542-Turning-Tool/dp/B00012X7LQ</a>?  What makes a ""better tool"" better?</p>

<p>They both seem to be made of high speed steel (which I'm told is important and what I want).  They both appear to be similar length tools.  Is one more durable?  Is handle shape/material of any importance?  What are the other factors that I should care about when evaluating a turning chisel? </p>

"Corner butt joint, longer top or longer sides?","<p>When making butt joints for corners, say, for small little cabinets to hang on a wall (think medicine cabinet), structurally is there any difference between longer tops and longer sides (I'm using biscuits and glue, and I find I like using cleats attached to the inside top for hanging)?</p>

<p>I personally prefer the look of longer tops and bottoms especially if I intend to use the top surface as a shelf, but having longer sides is much easier for me to construct since all the horizontals are the same length, and gives a slightly easier order of assembly.</p>

<p>A lesser question: In addition to structural properties, is there any traditional/historical stylistic tendency for longer tops vs. sides?</p>

"Front and Leg vise","<p>It will probably have to wait until next summer but I am going to build my first woodworking bench soon.</p>

<p>I want to have at least one vise on it. I was thinking the front or leg vise. They both clamp in the same location. </p>

<p>Leg vise can be built from solely wood components and has a deep throat. It also is the largest of all bench vises from what I can tell. A ""con"" could be that a traditional leg vise relies on a parallel bar at the foot. Modern ones have <a href=""http://www.leevalley.com/en/hardware/page.aspx?p=72652&amp;cat=1,41659"" rel=""nofollow"">different designs</a>.  </p>

<p>Front vise has a smaller throat and typically has metal for the track. The overall design itself is smaller as well. </p>

<p>I am hoping to use this to help with sawing dovetails. I understand that it is not the only way but I feel more comfortable with the boards in a vertical position. I would like this fact not to distract from the actual question of vise choice. Merely an attempt at providing context to the question.  </p>

<hr>

<p>I'm sure that I know the basic differences between the two but I want to be sure I am not overlooking any feature or potential draw back. I think both would work for what I am trying to do. What are the functional differences between a leg and front vise? What criteria might make me choose one over the other? </p>

"Table saw technique, cross-cut dados on multiple boards","<p>I bought a table saw recently and it's the most terrifying tool I own.</p>

<p>I want to cut a 5/8"" dado across four 5"" wide boards in identical positions, about 14"" from the reference edge. I have a 1/2"" stack so I'll have to make two passes. What is the safest technique for this?</p>

<p>It doesn't feel good to use the fence, one at a time, because it's difficult to keep the board flush to it given only 5"" contacts the fence with 14"" distance to the blade.</p>

<p>I could use the mitre slide but I'm not sure how to get consistent position for multiple cuts. Is there some magic jig I can cut or a good marking / measuring technique for the mitre slide? (I am thinking, maybe I can make an ""L"", laying on its side, with the long edge mounted to the slide and the short edge 14"" from the blade, but I foresee problems keeping the angles true and the short edge sturdy; I could make it out of scrap steel maybe but now it seems like a whole project of its own.)</p>

<p>Can I somehow load all the boards at once? I was thinking maybe I could temporarily mount them all to a piece of plywood or something then run the whole thing along the fence, maybe once to make all the edges flush then flip it around to cut the dados. But I don't want to put screw or brad holes in the boards and I'm not sure how to mount them otherwise.</p>

<p>How can I safely and accurately make these cuts?</p>

"Why is this yellow colour coming through the finish","<p>I made a coffee table out of pallet wood. If I had to guess there is at least 3 different kinds of wood here and I don't know for sure which they are. </p>

<p>The white you see is home made chalk paint made from drywall mud and white acrylic paint. It had about 2 coats of paint. To protect and finish I choose polycrylic.</p>

<p>Somehow one of the blocks stained the paint yellow. I saw one other block like this but it was not as defined. It reminds me of painting the walls of a former smokers house where the tar seeps through the paint. </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/gbO5W.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/gbO5W.jpg"" alt=""Foot of my coffee table""></a></p>

<p>I am still new at finishing and I should have realized that I was applying too much polycrylic as you can see the dripping. While that was bad it did show me something. If you see on the right hand side of the block the yellow colour does not go all the way up the block. There is a drip there that goes from white to yellow. That tells me the finish was not the source of the issue? Perhaps just exacerbated it? Most of the wood pictured has a coat of polycrylic on it and that is not a test coat. </p>

<p>I started looking more for the colour and I found one more block that would have been from the same pallet that had a little yellowing. </p>

<p>Everyone of those blocks you see had pith so it should be a fair amount of heartwood. Also the spots where you see a little bare wood was done on purpose prior to polycrylicing (If that is a verb). </p>

<p>Why did the finish turn yellow in those few places? I think it has something to do with the wood itself.</p>

<hr>

<p>As an aside I just sanded down the finish and most of the paint in that area. The table was meant to look distressed anyway. Still curious what happened so I can try to prevent it or at least be aware of it. </p>

"Lacquer dries very slowly","<p>I have made a small jewelry box from steamed black walnut for my significant other. My original idea was to sand it down to 400 grit and finish with just oil (which I did, with two coats of IKEA ""Skydd"" mineral oil), but I liked the high gloss so much I decided to give a try to lacquer... and things went downhill from there.</p>

<p>The first thin coat of lacquer was absorved almost entirely by the end grain. Also, the lacquer was taking days get dry enough to touch (an alkyd resin-based lacquer premixed with naphtha as solvent, supposed to dry fully in 24 hours). At this point, I sort of panicked and applied 4 more <em>generous</em> coats using a brush in quick succession, barely waiting 48 hours between coats.</p>

<p>Now it's been a full week since the last coat was applied and the lacquer is still rubbery to touch, nowhere near hard enough for sanding. I only have a week or so left before the event the box was made for and given the progress so far, I doubt it will fully dry (but then it's my first time with lacquer, so I don't know).</p>

<p>Any ideas how can I save this project? I'm OK with removing the lacquer with paint thinner, but I'm not sure if that will damage the wood. Also, where did I go wrong with the finishing?</p>

"Can I use linseed oil and water-based polyurethane on opposing sides of a 1/2"" board?","<p>I know that linseed oil and water-based polyurethane won't work together.  But I have 1/2"" poplar paneling that I am installing in my van and am hoping to get the best of both synthetic and natural properties.  I like that the linseed oil soaks into the wood and would help prevent splitting on hot days however it turns the wood more yellow than we'd like.  On the other hand, I heard that water-based polyurethane would keep the wood with the most natural look keeping it mostly white bright, although it might not prevent the wood from splitting as well as linseed oil.  </p>

"Finishing a beech desk top (Ikea Gerton), suitability of tung oil","<p>I recently made a desk using a <a href=""https://www.ikea.com/ca/en/catalog/products/50106773/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Gerton</a> beech wood top from Ikea. Ikea recommends using their <a href=""https://www.ikea.com/ca/en/catalog/products/50070378/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Behandla</a> finishing oil in the instructions included with the top. I am a bit skeptical of this finish, however, (seems like BLO) and would like to use an alternative.</p>

<p>I will be using this as a computer desk and my top priorities for a finish are that it be at least somewhat water resistant (don't need to worry about using coasters) and food safe.  </p>

<p>After doing a bit of research, it seems like pure/raw tung oil might do the trick.</p>

<p>My main questions are </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Is this a good choice given my needs or should I consider an alternative? (I would like to keep the finish 'natural' looking/feeling)</p>

<ul>
<li>As a side question, is BLO food safe? I have heard Ikea claims their Behandla finish is food safe, but the listed 'metal drying agents' make me skeptical...</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>If I go the pure tung oil route, do I need to cut it with something like mineral oil when applying (as some sites recommend) or is it fine to just put it on straight out of the can?</p></li>
<li><p>Is pure tung oil the best choice, or can I go with something like polymerized tung and still be food safe?</p></li>

While drawing I realized the two outside studs can't go on the edge, so is there a way of still keeping the outside stud (maybe oriented differently) and if so how?

<p>I've been following Paul Sellers for a little bit now absorbing his knowledge of how to use simple hand tools. But one thing that he either directly said or alluded to was to pay attention to the wood and work with it. I saw a documentary on Japanese woodworking and that got me thinking about how can I build things differently and ""work with the wood"" instead of against it. So that is why I am willing to spend the extra time to cut this all out for the framing. Now this isn't to say that I'm not going to use screws at all as I plan on using them to put the siding on, and I think I am going to need it for the roof (unless there is a technique for that too!) Anywho. Thoughts?</p>

"Should I treat end-grain on garden table with wood glue?","<p><strong>The Preface:</strong></p>

<p>I'm building a table for the garden and did some research into how I might seal and protect the most vulnerable parts of the table. The end-grain. The wood I have available is old(30+ years) and very dry larch-wood.</p>

<p>Beside the steps one could take, that are already covered in various questions across this and other sites I stumbled upon a method that is called ""sizing"". I hope I spelled that right. The sealing of end-grain is covered in <a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/questions/2305/do-i-need-to-seal-the-ends-of-hardwood-fence-boards"">'Do I need to seal the ends of hardwood fence boards?'</a> and this here might be a duplicate to that question.</p>

<p><strong>The Story:</strong></p>

<p>While watching <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/user/stevinmarin"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Steve Ramsey</a>'s channel I stumbled over his video about '<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Esvb64fUQ10"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">What You Need to Know About Glue</a>'. He also covers gluing end-grain (starting at ~5:20) and suggests making a ""sizing""(at ~6:00), which is basically wood-glue mixed with some water to ""size"" the wood before the actual glue-up. To me it seems this sizing is just sealing up the end-grain pores with wood-glue. And the mixing with water is done so the thinner substance might penetrate deeper into the wood.</p>

<p>My thought now is that I will try to use this technique for the end-grain parts of my table (probably all of them) to close the pores and make it more durable. </p>

<p>To achieve that I would put masking tape around the edges of the wood and soak the end-grain with my ""sizing"". The masking tape would protect the surface of the wood from ugly glue-stains during the sizing. After all is dried up I would take off about half a millimeter (~1/64"") with the table-saw/miter-saw for a smooth end and start to apply the actual finish everywhere.</p>

<p><strong>The Question(s):</strong></p>

<p>In theory I think this method to be quite ingenious and am wondering why I haven't heard of it before. Or am I missing some fundamental problem with this here?</p>

<ul>
<li>How far will this sizing penetrate into the end-grain? (Of course that answer will probably be dependent on the density and type of the wood)</li>
<li>Will this help preventing/delaying rot?</li>
<li>Will the masking tape prevent the other faces to get ugly glue stains?</li>
<li>Is there any drawback with this method concerning the expansion and shrinkage of the wood? Which will probably be severe as  I plan to let the table sit outside all the time.</li>

"Can a large bandsaw side table be useful for rip cuts?","<p>I want to make furniture. Therefore, whether I'm cutting a roughly cut piece of plywood or cutting a ""solid wood"" piece made from a gluing up smaller boards, I will certainly need to make wood panels with final dimensions around:</p>

<ul>
<li>Width: 12-24 inch</li>
<li>Length: 12-36 inch</li>
</ul>

<p>I have seen two popular approaches for cutting wood panels: </p>

<ol>
<li>Table saw</li>
<li>Hand-held saws (track saw, circular saw, jigsaw, hand saw)</li>
</ol>

<p>These approaches have their strengths and weaknesses in regards to accuracy, repeatability, safety, and physical effort. The details are for another discussion.</p>

<p>However, it seems that the bandsaw has limited usefulness here due to its somewhat small cutting capacity (9-14 inch for models below $600). In fact, it seems that one would need to spend more than $4000 for a bandsaw with a 24"" cutting capacity, although I suppose a large table saw would have a similar price. Still, I wonder why bandsaws with a cutting capacity of 24"" and larger are not more common? </p>

<p>There seems to be a correlation between the cutting capacity of a bandsaw and the size of the wheels since the compact design puts the bandsaw's table spanning horizontally across the space between the upward and downward moving blades, see Figure 1 below. My question has to do with the proposed bandsaw design, shown on the right in figure 1, in which the table has been extended to the side and the fence is on the far side as well. Is there anything inadvisable about doing rip cuts on this proposed bandsaw design?

<p>I have seen some YouTube videos showing bandsaw table extensions. In-flow or out-flow extension tables can support long pieces of wood, but they are not what I'm interested in. Most (but not all) of the bandsaw ""side"" table extensions that I have seen are somewhat small <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqpgRfS6Rz8"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">see this YouTube link</a>. <strong>My question is whether there is anything problematic with ripping a panel on a large bandsaw side table while registering it against a fence that is also mounted on the side table?</strong> I'm primarily asking about rip cuts here, but I would also be interested in your thoughts about having mitre slots in this large bandsaw side for cross cutting.</p>

<p>My guess is that there must be something ""wrong"" with this idea or this would be a more common commercial tool. I appreciate your time and your thoughts.</p>

"Extending wood studs or adding wood to cover over the studs","<p>So the problem is this.  I bought a house and it has this super awesome movie room.   When I moved in, I took my stud finder out and it wasn't working on that side of the wall, but it was working on the other side.

<ol>
<li>extend the studs or possibly secure another 2 by 4 to the side of
the studs that are already there, then redo that portion of the
drywall </li>
<li>Cut out a rectangle of the drywall and attach a 2 by 4 to the front of the studs so it's like a ""T"".  If I can get the right size piece of wood then that could be flush with the wall and can be painted to match the black wall. </li>
<li>something that you guys think of</li>
</ol>

<p>This needs to be able to support a 75 to 100 pound TV mounted to it.  This makes me nervous and I don't know what the best practices would be.</p>

"Avoiding saw burn in hardwood crosscuts","<p>Blade rookie here. I have a 1.5HP table saw with a 10"" blade. The blades I have been using are fairly new higher tooth finishing blades, such as the Diablo 1060X. To avoid the friction burns when ripping and cross cutting 3/4"" birch, I started having to cut only an 1/8th"" deep at a time, raising the blade between passes. I'm looking for advice on which blades to help make my process more efficient, as I have several hundred cuts to make.</p>

<p>A lower tooth ripping blade (Diablo 1024X) sounds like it'll make rips cuts much quicker, and I'm led to believe that the edge will actually be quite smooth. I would love to have as close to finished edges as reasonably possible. This blade sounds like a no-brainer to try.</p>

<p>But I don't see any specialized crosscutting blades. What's my best bet to make these more efficient? With such a hard wood, would I always be expected to need to make multiple passes in a 3/4"" board to avoid burning?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> 
I'm cutting 200 6""x3""x3/4"" blocks of birch. Planning to rip ~7"" wide boards to get the 3"" wide dimension, then cross cutting to the 6"" using a sled.

"Removing Spilled Paint and Staining Table","<p>A clumsy contractor put a paint can on a table of mine (no stain, varnish, 100% fresh wood) and a ring of paint got left behind on the table.

"unknown damage to Tru-Oil finish, please advise","<p>First, I'll show you a pic of the damage, then I'll give you a short background to how this happened, then last I'll ask for advice.</p>

<p><strong>The damage:</strong></p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/6AB2s.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/6AB2s.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>As you can see there are tiny specs in the <strong>Tru-Oil</strong> finish (one single application) on my <strong>black walnut</strong> board. </p>

<p><strong>Background info:</strong></p>

<p>Here's what happened. </p>

<p>I'm making a shelf with these black walnut boards and I did a very good job with the sanding, started with 60 grit (very rough sawn from my friend's saw mill) then 80, 120, and finally 220. </p>

<p>Then, I had to abandon the project for about a week and they sat in my garage (where I also worked on getting a riding lawnmower started). Then sanded them with <em>320</em> grit before wiping on a single layer of Tru-Oil. They looked really really great the next day. </p>

<p>My next step was to apply spar-urethane over them to protect from UV and water, but unfortunitally I became pre-occupied with something else and they sat on the garage for some more time, during which it rained extremely hard and some leaks in my roof formed and dripped water onto the floor <em>next</em> to where the boards where laying. Then yesterday I discovered the damage.</p>

<p>So.. it was either caused by water splashing onto the boards and ruining the Tru-Oil (they say it's water resistant but not water proof). Or something like WD40 got onto the boards in-between finish sanding and applying the Tru-Oil and that caused it to react this way. Or... ?</p>

<p><strong>The question:</strong></p>

<p>Do you think this is water damage? The effect of WD40 or similar on the wood before the finish was applied? Something else? I think it's water damage but I just want to cover all bases, and I'm surprised that Tru-Oil would do this. </p>

<p>And what should I do? Sand it smooth and start over, or apply a new coat of oil on top? I know that there's <a href=""http://dannix.net/lib/abode/walnut"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">a noticeable difference in darkness and sheen from 1 coat to 2 coats of Tru-oil</a>. And if I sand it off and start over, what grit should I start with?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

"Using 1x4 instead of 2x4 for laminated workbench top?","<p>I'm getting into woodworking using hand tools. I'd like to make a 2'x4' or 2'x5' workbench for my apartment.  I'd rather not use power tools as the noise would be an issue, and using old hand tools is enjoyable to me.  </p>

<p>I was considering laminating 2x4s for the bench top, but construction/framing 2x4s have rounded edges that I would rather not take the time and energy to plane by hand (no matter how much I enjoy using hand tools). I also don't want to deal with finding someone to run them through a planer.  </p>

"Do I need to worry about incidental contact between a finish and its thinner / solvent once it's cured?","<p>This is probably most applicable for water-based finishes, but I suppose it could be generalized to all finishes. </p>

I'm not talking about leaving a piece finished with water-based poly outside in the rain, of course, but rather near a shower or sink, for instance. Will that contact with water eventually eat away the finish? Would it depend on the type of finish and/or how many coats and/or how thick each coat was?</p>

"Need help understanding workbench design and build process","<p>I recently asked a question here regarding the use of 1x4s rather than 2x4s for a laminated workbench top and got some helpful advice. I decided to go with 2x4s, and now it's time to build. Before I do, I'd like to run my general plan past this community to see how it sounds.</p>

<p>I plan on laminating 16 5' long 2x4s to make a 5x2' bench top.  I'll use a plane to skim the face of each board to help the gluing process, use my 6 5' long bar clamps to hold the glue-up together overnight, and then build the base.</p>

<p>For the base, I have 8 3' 2x4s to laminate in pairs for the legs, the depth of the legs being 3.5"" each and the width being 3"" each. I have enough material for two sets of pairs of laminated 2x4 stretchers, one at the top of the legs, to be tenoned into the leg mortises, and one at the bottom of the legs to be tenoned in.  Then I have enough for 4 sets of 2 laminated 5' 2x6s to run the length of the bench, also tenoned into the legs. </p>

<p>So, I'll end up with a frame that is 2'x5' with fairly stout legs and good bracing across and along the depth. Then I'd like to use dowels to attach the top, so it could be removed to be semi-portable. Those would be between the top and the stretchers on the left and right sides, either one on each side or a pair on each side.</p>

<p>Is there anything wrong with this design? Most designs I see have the top overlapping the base by a few inches on each side, especially when considering the length. Is this a requirement?</p>

It seems like in theory, the screw should <em>always</em> push the joint apart (bridging). But in my experience, screws more often seem to tighten the joint. How does this work?

"Cutting tight miter joints for a frame around an existing object","<p>I recently finished most of a practice project (a large lap desk). It looks like this so far:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/RRl4C.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/RRl4C.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>I made a ton of mistakes but the only one I can't figure out how to fix next time is the frame around it, specifically gaps in the miter joints because the sides were not the correct length (not because the angles were significantly off). I ended up with massive gaps on two of the corners:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/aQGxg.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/aQGxg.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>The piece consists of a 3/4"" thick panel made of joined boards, surrounded by a rabbeted, chamfered, mitered frame cut from 2x2s. The cross section of the frame looks like this, the green marks indicate the face that needs to match the length of the panel edges (I joined the green edge to the panel with biscuits):</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/KSDel.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/KSDel.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/aunYO.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/aunYO.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>The process I went through to fit this frame was awful:</p>

<ol>
<li>Cut frame pieces and make miter cut in one end of each.</li>
<li>Place against panel lining up mitered end then pencil mark green and purple edges on the other end.</li>
<li>Eyeballed mark against a marking I made on the table saw table where the edge of the blade was. Difficult because mark did not extend down to table (wide bottom was in way, and flipping edge upside down made mark impossible to see). Made cuts. Verified that table saw probably cut through green edge reference mark.</li>
<li>Dry fit, pieces were too long.</li>
<li>Tried to trim on table saw. Pieces became too short.</li>
<li>Got frustrated, cut about 1/8"" off two sides of panel, re-routed chamfers. Used table saw fence to make short sides exactly 13.75"" long. Long sides exceeded capacity of table saw. Used square to draw perpendicular lines on long edges roughly 1/16"" from old edge, clamped a straight board to panel, used pattern bit in router to trim.</li>
<li>Measured 13.75"" from cut on each short edge of frame. Made new mark. Dry fit long edges, made new marks.</li>
<li>Use rafter square 45 degree edge, referenced to mark on green edge, to make cut markings on inner edges. Difficult because of gap between top and inner edge.</li>
<li>Made a <a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/tDCte.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">thing screwed to my miter slide</a> so I could see where the edge was on the table saw.</li>
<li>Clamped frame to slide lining up markings with edge of thing then made cuts. This was somewhat hampered by the chamfers already cut on the frame edges. I used one existing mitered cut and picked the one to mark and adjust in a way that made it so I didn't have to keep changing the angle on my slide.</li>
<li>Verified that table saw probably cut through green edge reference mark.</li>
<li>Long edges were too short.</li>
<li>Gave up, glued everything together and crammed the corners full of grain filler. Gaps were too big to put glue on the mitered edges so I hacked it with <a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/gmG0V.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">half a biscuit and a chisel</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p>So, my question is: How could I have constructed this frame with no gaps? How can I create a tight mitered frame around a <em>fixed size, pre-existing</em> object?</p>

<p>I read <a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/questions/1463/perfect-miters-every-time"">Perfect miters every time</a> and watched <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rc4ACVofxyQ"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">a video linked from there</a>. I also read <a href=""http://www.instructables.com/id/Easy-Cure-for-Miter-Joint-quotGaposisquot/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this trick</a>. But I can't understand how I can apply any of this, because it all seems to detail how to get the angles right <em>without caring about the final size of the frame</em>. I also am having trouble understanding how the sleds described could be used here - I think I accomplished about the same thing in step 9 above.</p>

<p>It seems to me that the biggest challenge here is that my reference edge is actually in the center of my frame.</p>

<p>I do not know what good marking / measuring / cutting techniques are required to make this happen. I am frustrated because I keep trying to research this and hitting dead ends where people care about the precise angle but don't mind shrinking their frames by 1/16"" or so in the process.</p>

"Applying shellac smoothly without a sprayer","<p>How can I apply a smooth coat of dewaxed shellac without a sprayer?</p>

<p>Whether I use a brush, sponge, or rag, I always end up with tiny raised beads of shellac at the borders of my previous brush stroke. This mostly happens between dips into the can. Trying to fade them down with brush strokes makes it worse.</p>

<p>What am I doing wrong and how can I avoid this?</p>

<p>It's difficult to sand when it dries and in all my sanding attempts I still end up reducing the beads to smooth but visible rough lines. I can cover with another coat but then I am back to square one.</p>

<p>It's obvious that it shouldn't be overbrushed, it even says that on the can. It tacks up so quickly that I have problems just keeping it smooth across brush strokes. I have tried thin coats, thick coats, fading the brush strokes, slopping it on and hoping it levels, waiting a bit and trying to buff it, quick second coat while still wet, all with poor results. I even tried just dumping it out of the can and quickly spreading it around (which sort of solved the problem but made some messy new problems...).</p>

<p>I have a good bit of experience with paint and everything in my bag of tricks is failing me.</p>

<p>The effect is much less pronounced for the first coat on a soft unfinished material, because it soaks in quickly, esp. things like poplar and MDF. But for the most part it always happens no matter where the coat is.</p>

"Coping with uneven table saw table and inconsistent cut depth","<p>What is the best way to cope with a table saw that has an uneven table?</p>

<p>I noticed inconsistent cut depths with my table saw so did some test cuts on a piece of oak known to be straight and measured the depths. Cuts were like this:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/tdImJ.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/tdImJ.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>I made the cuts in a random order to rule out the possibility of the blade height drifting. I also noticed no play in the blade position or angle with my hands.</p>

<p>Results were like this (leading and trailing edge depths measured about 0.25"" from respective edge, note x axis is mirrored wrt above picture, ""throat plate far edge"" is where the edge of the wood crosses the far edge of the throat plate):</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/YIQoB.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/YIQoB.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>The blade has angled teeth, and I measured to the center of the cut. I made the full set of measurements 3 times and found my results only varied by at most 0.0005"", so I believe the relative measurements to be accurate.</p>

<p>The first thing I discovered was that I did a poor initial job adjusting my throat plate height (as evidenced; it was too low), so I fixed that. However, I closely inspected the table with a square (a friend lent me a Starrett) and found that it is not completely flat. There are large, smooth, ever so slight bends and dips in it, and the bit to the right of the throat plate is a few hundredths of an inch higher than the left side. I am <em>presuming</em> this is the cause of my inconsistent cut depths. I also can feel with my fingers that the miter slide's rail is slightly higher than the table although I'm not sure how this affects things.</p>

<p>I noticed an identical trend with a piece of MDF and a piece of poplar as well (this is actually what prompted me to do this experiment) although I did not make a full measurement set on those.</p>

<p>What is the best way to cope with this (or are my expectations too high; the saw is a Ridgid R4513<sup>â </sup>)? I have not yet built any sleds. It seems like a sled with a nice flat base will solve the issue for cross cuts. I did read <a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/a/1095/1250"">this great answer</a>, however, I am still unsure what to do for non-through rip cuts, where the material is longer and I want to use the fence. </p>

<hr>

<p><sup>â  After reading grfrazee's answer, I contacted Ridgid and they claim a Â±0.016"" manufacturing tolerance; further inspection of the table appears to verify it is within their tolerance. So it seems my expectations may be too high for this particular saw.</sup></p>

It seems that it can be a fairly personal thing, for example in <a href=""https://books.google.com/books?id=rchOmEYbGzsC&amp;pg=PA48&amp;lpg=PA48&amp;dq=witness%20marks%20wood&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=w1ZUCdt2N9&amp;sig=Q8jyuRR6Hm7UUqO3ZMeNDAdCD0U&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwBWoVChMI7-OS7tP8yAIVAjY-Ch3KYwfG#v=onepage&amp;q=witness%20marks%20wood&amp;f=false"" rel=""nofollow"">this book</a> and <a href=""http://chiselandforge.com/woodworking/witness-marks/"" rel=""nofollow"">this video of a guy sharing his grandfather's marking techniques</a>, they use triangles pointing away from you, while the guy in the first video above uses triangles pointing towards you. Still, despite the personal touches, they all generally seem to be variations of a common theme.</p>

<p>The only marks I've really been consistent with up to this point are triangles facing towards me for alignment and a double squiggly line for the face side of a reference edge, both from that first video. I'll also be using the tally marks on joints now (I was just using triangles for that, too), since I watched the chiselandforge video. </p>

<p>My question is: No matter what you want to call them, can somebody share their knowledge of a full set of these marks? The chiselandforge link above covers a fair set, but for some reason this seems to be an ancient woodworking secret mysteriously absent from the internet (well, I couldn't find much). I'd like to know more.</p>

<p><sup>As a sub question, which is actually what I was looking for to begin with: I'm also wondering if there's a common marking used to indicate an original piece in a series of copies (e.g. if I want to do the same thing to many boards, and I do my accurate measuring on one then copy it to the others, is there a traditional mark to keep track of the original).</sup></p>

"Finishing schedule for live edge walnut slab","<p>I'm working on a live edge walnut slab coffee table.  This is a photo of the bottom side of the table before any finish is applied sanded to 220 (for reference the holes are for threaded inserts that take a 1/4-20 bolt -- I machined metal legs that mate to the table):</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/QRaaS.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>I finished the bottom using <a href=""http://www.buybutcherblock.com/mm5/merchant.mvc?Screen=PROD&amp;Product_Code=goodstuff-finish4&amp;Category_Code=maintenanceProd"" rel=""noreferrer"">Emmet's Good Stuff</a>, which is a gel polyurethane oil based varnish.  I applied a few coats, scuff sanded, and then used steel wool to apply some wax.  I used some cotton rags to polish the wax by hand:
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/uvkue.jpg"" alt=""walnut color example 1"">
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZGBAo.jpg"" alt=""walnut color example 2""></p>

<p>It's pretty hard to capture the grain/reflections with my iphone, but in general I liked the results. That stated I'd like something that pops the grain a bit more on the top side.  The Good Stuff contains ""synthetic oils"" (whatever that means) that do penetrate the wood nicely, but it doesn't have quite the pop I'm looking for.  Additionally the color of the wood doesn't quite match, the look I was hoping for seen in examples like:</p>

<p><a href=""https://store.kaufmann-mercantile.com/products/live-edge-black-walnut-cutting-board"" rel=""noreferrer"">Example 1</a></p>

<p><a href=""http://stinewoodworking.com/portfolio/live-edge-slab-dining-table/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Example 2</a></p>

<p>I'm hoping to get a richer/darker tone in the heartwood while maintaining a nice contrast with the sap wood (it's fine by me if the sap wood darkens up a bit too so long as it maintains that nice contrast seen in the above examples).</p>

<p>I've been reading a ton about finishing and was hoping to get some feedback on the following finishing schedule for this piece:</p>

<ol>
<li>1-2 coats of oil (either boiled linseed, tung, or something like a danish oil).  The idea of this step is to pop the grain more than the good stuff is capable of as well as possibly darken the color of the wood a bit.</li>
<li>1 coat of dewaxed shellac.  The idea here is to provide a sanding sealer, optionally use a darker shellac (maybe amber?) to help darken the wood as well (augmenting step 1), and provide an interface to other finishing products. (perhaps this step is unnecessary if the next step isn't needed?)</li>
<li>Pore filler.  Not really sure about this step -- I've been reading a bunch about it/watching youtube videos and it's unclear to me if this will help accentuate the pores (which I would imagine would help pop the figure) after the first two steps in this process.  From what I understand I think I'd want to use an oil based pore filler.  I am under the impression that I should sand this stuff off so it just stays in the pores. (Maybe I can combine the first three steps into one step by wet sanding the oil and using the slurry as wood filler?)</li>
<li>Few coats of Good Stuff to provide a nice hard durable finish on top.</li>
<li>Rub out the good stuff with sand paper up to ~1200 grit to get a satin finish.</li>
</ol>

<p>Any feedback on the above steps, combination thereof, and the proposed reasoning behind them would be helpful.  Perhaps there other other better ways to approach this as well.  A few notes: I'm doing this in a garage with minimal access to professional equipment so spraying isn't really an option for me.  I'm 100% an amateur/hobbyist so super expensive equipment probably isn't realistic (though I do have access to a tool library and would consider investment in low-medium cost tools).</p>

<p>-------  EDIT  -------</p>

<p>After trying several different permutations I finally finished the table.  I ended up making a test board of a piece I cut from the slab:</p>

<p>The combinations I tried were:</p>

<ol>
<li>1 part Boiled linseed oil 1 part mineral spirits</li>
<li>1 part Boiled linseed oil 1 part mineral spirits second coat wet sanded with the grain</li>
<li>Maloof oil (1/3 poly, 1/3 BLO, 1/3 tung)</li>
<li>Maloof oil second coat wet sanded with grain</li>
<li>Good stuff</li>
<li>1 part BLO 2 parts mineral spirits</li>
<li>Tung oil</li>
<li>1lb dewaxed blonde shellac to test as a sanding sealer</li>
</ol>

<p>I then top coated those with good stuff to see what the final effect would be.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/E4NSe.jpg"" alt=""test board""></p>

<p>The sample board below shows the work, but it's probably impossible to see any differences given the lighting and iphone camera.  Suffice it to say there was a notable difference between all options.  How much and who noticed is debatable, but if you looked closely there were lots of differences.  All the oil products definitely popped the grain much better than the good stuff.  Qualitatively I'd say that BLO darkened the wood (especially the sap wood) more than the tung oil.  Interestingly the 2 parts mineral spirits 1 part BLO came out darker than 1 part mineral spirits 1 part BLO.  Maybe the mineral spirits thinned it more so that it was able to penetrate deeper?  Wet sanding the second coat definitely did <em>something</em> to the pores.  I've read in a few places that it's debatable whether this technique actually fills the pores since you're wiping away after a few minutes anyway.  In any event those sections' pores were much more visible (e.g. darker) to a degree I didn't like.</p>

<p>The shellac absolutely sanded easier than the good stuff.  This was to be expected, but I was shocked at how much smoother of a surface I got from this.</p>

<p>In the end I decided that I liked what the BLO and tung did to the wood.  They both popped the grain and made it ""richer"", but in different ways.  Rather than picking/choosing/overthinking it I just mixed 1 part BLO 1 part tung and 2 parts mineral spirits.  That way I could tell myself I got the best of both worlds :)</p>

<p>I could have just used the maloof finish, but I didn't see much point of using the poly in the maloof finish since I was going to get a poly top coat from the good stuff anyway.  Also though the differences were slight I preferred the pure oil to the maloof.</p>

<p>I did use the dewaxed shellac as a sanding sealer, which I was happy with.  I got a much smoother surface than I think I would have if I used the good stuff, but who knows -- I'm sure it's possible to get a very smooth surface with the good stuff as well.</p>

<p>After that I used 4 coats of good stuff removing excess almost immediately.  I scuff sanded between coats.  Finally I applied neutral liberon black bison wax with steel wool and polished by hand with rags.</p>

<p>I'm really happy with the finished table.  I think it looks and feels great.  Compared to another larger table I did with just good stuff I think the grain pops a lot more due to the oil.  I get a much more ""3d"" look to the figure.  The oils appear to have definitely darkened the wood in a way that I like.  The wax finish over the good stuff leaves a really nice smooth surface, which I really like.</p>

<p>Obviously the number one driver for the look of the finished table is the wood itself.  That stated I could have probably done anything and it would have turned out nicely, but since I chose this route I'll say it was the best!</p>

"Does MDF warp less than pineboards?","<h3>Background</h3>

<p>I am a very much a beginner, and I have been trying to make a long (3.6m) pelmet. (It is not a pelmet box - it goes from wall to wall, and hangs from the ceiling.)</p>

<p>Attempt #1 was with a single piece of pineboard that was delivered with a mild warp (mainly twist with a touch of cupping). I let it sit for a couple of weeks inside before  got around to painting it, but I didn't take any active measures to flatten it first - I thought it wouldn't be noticeable once it was mounted up high and painted the same colour as the walls and ceiling. I was <em>very</em> wrong, and think I have to abandon it and start again.</p>

"Is cedar dangerous for your health when used in indoor furniture?","<p>I'm concerned about the health risks of using the cedar as indoor furniture.

Is there anything I can do to protect ourselves from this?</p>

<p>I did put one coat of wipe on Danish fruitwood oil on the bed, but thats about it. I also realised that the planks that the mattress sits on are also cedar and these were NOT sealed with anything, not even the danish oil. Should I perhaps seal those to be on the safe side. Its a very small bedroom with not much ventilation, so I want to be safe.</p>

<p>Additionally, I also read that using Danish oil on cedar anyway is a bad idea as doesn't fully cure? Can someone advise on the impact of this.</p>

<p>What does it ultimately mean if it does not fully cure. What impacts does that have? I've had the bed fully done and in use for about 7 months now.</p>

<p>It's a lovely bed, but I want to ensure I treat it properly to ensure any offgassing does not cause health concerns, we plan to have this bed a long time if possible.</p>

<p>So any suggestions on what I can do to make this safer, would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p><strong>Update 22/May/2017:</strong></p>

<p>The bedhead is about 6ft high, which is basically panelling almost most of one side of the bedroom, as its a small bedroom. So theres a lot of Cedar in this small room.</p>

<p>The concern I had was around the plicatic acid contained in the Cedar. It also depends what Cedar, I know Western and Eastern are different. Mine was from Home Depot in BC, which I would assume is Western Cedar, as well, weâre in Western Canada, is that a good assumption? :P</p>

<p>And WRC is one to contain a lot of this acidâ¦</p>

<p>Iâm still however wondering if its worth adding an extra coat of âsomethingâ as Cedar is traditionally used outdoor rather than indoor. Someone suggested Tung oil to me today, any thoughts on that? Iâm hoping I can do something that does not involve having to do it outside, as all I have is a balcony in my apartment.</p>

<p>As per the 2nd link, Australian Red Cedar, has been banned as a furniture making timber, at the Canberra School of the Arts, in their Fine Furniture Workshop, as Aussie Red is carcinogenic. Not sure about whatever Cedar is over in Canada.</p>

<p>Again, thanks for all your comments. I really appreciate it and the efforts that you have gone to to look it up. My girlfriend will be moving in soon, and I want to make sure its all good to go. Anything I can do before then to finish off the bed is what is driving me to look into all this right now. From the googling, it has been shown dust, shavings or the wood can aggravate or even cause breathing problems, so I naturally came here to see what others more experienced than me thought about it, cos I donât want to end up causing Asthma or whatever breathing issues for me and my girlfriend. That wood database even mentioned a cancer in relation to Cedar, so it leaves me a bit clueless as what to think of the next step.</p>

"Laminating 2"" red oak to make 4x4s?","<p>I got a bunch of free wood today, as in 6 rough quarter-sawn(!) red oak boards, 2"" x 12"" x 9'. For free. (Yay!) The boards were stickered about a year ago. (The largest piece was 38"" x 4"" x 13'. It is becoming a bar top, I think.)</p>

<p>Now, I'm making a table, and the legs and a few other pieces are 3.75"" square. I could make all of the 4x4 pieces I need from two of the 12"" boards with plenty to spare. </p>

<p>Is there any problem or surprise waiting for me if I laminate the boards in this way? If laminating is the proper term when dealing with thick stock in this way. My plan is to run the boards trough the planer to get a flat side, rip it to the desired width - 3 pieces per big board - and glue the flat sides together. After the glue has set, run the finished board back through the planer, cut to length and move on with construction. </p>

<p>Thoughts? Is this the right approach? There were some boards of the right size, but they were already spoken for. And I'd rather not spend another $300 on lumber. Because I'm cheap. </p>

"Using a Planer on wide but short stock","<p>I want to make a chess-board style end-grain cutting board. I only have a bandsaw, a Jointer and a Planer. The first step is easy: I cut strips of two wood species and joint and plane them so they are 40mmx40mm. I then glue them together to get a striped board. Now I need to crosscut that into strips again (each strip is then striped).</p>

<p>All the tutorials I found use a table saw for this, which creates a glueable surface. I don't have that.</p>

<p>I can do these cuts on the bandsaw, but after that, the strips need to be planed to create a gluable surface. I cannot just run them through the planer lengthwise, because that would be across the grain. I also cannot run them through the planer width-wise as they are too short (40mm).</p>

<p>Can I maybe clamp these strips together and run them through the planer as one piece? With F-Style clamps?</p>

"Connecting the MDF corners, so there's no gap","<p>TL;DR</p>

<p>How do I connect the MDF sheets on the corners (in left-hand-side picture), so they align nicely, and there's no gap? As you can see in the sketch, the angles are not always multiples of 45 degrees.</p>

<p>Backstory:</p>

<p>One day I got bored, and wanted to play some Pac-Man. Playing it on PC didn't really feel right, so I decided to buy an arcade cabinet. After checking the prices on eBay, I made the best decision... ""$1,500 for a cabinet? I can build this myself!""</p>

<p>Needless to say, it's a great idea for someone with no prior woodworking experience...</p>

<p>Anyway, I am moving forward quite nicely, but I've stumbled upon a problem for which I can't seem to find a solution.</p>

<p>I am wondering how I can connect MDF sheets together, so that there isn't be a gap between them - basically, how can I cut them at an angle (and what tools would you recommend for that purpose?).</p>

<p>In the image I am attaching, you can see my rough sketch of arcade cabinet on the left. How am I to connect the top sheet and back sheet together? They join at a slight angle, leaving a visible corner gap, and I want to achieve the result on the right, where the joined pieces blend together seamlessly.</p>

"Correct ""piping"" (hosing) for adding a mini-cyclone to a shop vac","<p>This is <em>technically</em> an engineering question rather than woodworking, but I guess chances are good that someone on here has experience with this, has already tried what works well, and thus can give a better practical answer.</p>

<p>I'm planning to upgrade my shop vac (Festool CTL26) with a small 6'' cyclone (ClearVue CV06, if that matters) and I'm inconclusive about what's best for the ""piping"". Space and mobility is, unluckily, somewhat of a factor here, so my solution needs to be something that can be tucked onto a systainer sitting on a shop vac rather than a collector with 150mm pipes, a 5HP blower and a 2.5 meter tall cyclone.</p>

<p>The idea behind the cyclone is of course to take away 90% of the dust before it even reaches the vac, which is supposed to both save money on filters and increase the vac's total filter efficiency.</p>

<p>In fact, it appears like someone else <a href=""http://www.sorotec.de/shop/Dust-Extraction/Dust-Deputy-297/FESTOOL-CTL26-Dust-Deputy-Set.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">already had that exact idea</a> and is selling almost exactly the build that I had envisioned (only with a cheaper cyclone). From the photo, they seem to connect with a 50mm or 2'' hose. Seeing how they're selling that, it probably has to ""work"". <em>Somehow</em>, at least.<br>
Also, I found some guy on Youtube who showed the same cyclone in action, and he just plugged the standard 27mm hose onto it (although he <em>said</em> it was 36mm). That, too, seemed to work, somehow.</p>

<p>Seeing how it makes almost zero difference both in price and handling, I would however like to use a combination that not just ""works somehow"" because some guy plugged in something that he had lying around in his shop, but something that works well (i.e. as good as you can get it, for the same money and with the same effort).</p>

<p>The vac has a ""native"" 50mm inlet (= ca. 2''), but comes with a 3.5 meter 27mm suction hose (which is <em>quite</em> long and thin, in my opinion). Optionally, you can buy 36mm and 50mm hoses (and of course, you can get any-diameter hoses and any-to-any adapters from generic manufacturers).
My tools (router, plunge saw, etc.) commonly have 36mm suction (with one exception, which has 27mm).</p>

<p>Intuitively, if a vac has a 50mm inlet, I want to plug something that's 50mm in diameter into that, not anything smaller. But that may be a wrong intuition.</p>

<p>A smaller hose means higher airspeed within the hose (assuming the same flow volume), which is a good thing for a cyclone. Higher speed means more centrifugal force. EPA suggests in their particle matter paper that cyclone efficiency increases with smaller inlet duct area (conclusive, this gives a higher inlet duct velocity). They also say that efficiency increases with the ratio of the cyclone body diameter to gas exit diameter (not sure why that should be the case).<br>
The inlet and outlet diameters are given by the cyclone's build (2.25'', ca. 58mm), but I assume the hose that you attach to the outlet counts, too (a 27mm hose connected to a 58mm outlet via an adapter is really just a 27mm outlet if you're honest!).</p>

<p>Despite that, my guts tell me to choose a 50mm hose to connect vac and cyclone (seeing how a thicker hose will let the vac ""suck better, and more easily""), and a 36mm one going from the cyclone to the tool because that one has less weight and is slightly less stubborn than the 50mm one, but it loses only 1/5 as much pressure as the 27mm one and is the same diameter as the outlet on the tool.<br>
I also assume there's less opportunity for turbulences or acceleration-deceleration effects if the hose diameter isn't constantly changing (also, it seems nonsensical to plug a 50mm hose into a 36mm hole, or having a 36mm hole when you only plug a 27mm hose into it).</p>

<p>On the other hand, the ""rules"" given by EPA suggest that using a 27mm hose on both sides would be the ""most optimal"" thing to do.</p>

<p>Using the vac's technical specifications (3,900l/min; 24,000Pa) and hopefully correct values for air density and viscosity in an online calculator, I get (assuming a straight steel pipe 1 meter long)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>27mm : v = 113.5 m/s = 6,811.5 m/min = 22,347 ft/min, Îp = 58.66mbar<br>
  36mm : v = 63.8m/s = 3,831.5 m/min = 12,570 ft/min, Îp = 12.61mbar<br>
  50mm : v = 33.1m/s = 1,986.2 m/min =  6,516 ft/min, Îp = 2.45mbar</p>
</blockquote>

<p>-- all with turbulent flow (not like it matters, but it seems like you need a hose 1.5 meters in diameter to get laminar flow at these speeds?!)</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong><br>
Meanwhile I've verified these numbers forwards and backwards three times with a pocket calculator, they seem indeed correct. Which is surprising, since even with the 50mm hose, I'm still <em>well above</em> the 4,000 ft/min recommended by the WOOD Magazine article mentioned in <a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/a/773/135"">this somewhat related answer</a>.<br>
Actual pressure loss on a twisting, ripped plastic hose will obviously be larger than on the assumed straight steel pipe.</p>

<p>But, purely from a <em>flow-speed-at-muzzle</em> perspective, there doesn't seem to be any real difference, I could just as well use the thickest hose to minimize pressure loss, and still be above the 4k figure.</p>

<p>Basically, the question that remains to be answered is inhowfar it makes a difference to the cyclone whether a smaller hose is used. I am still inclined to assume that a somewhat smaller hose on the ""tool side"" might be a benefit since air enters the vortex with higher velocity.<br>
However, according to the law of continuity, once inside the cyclone, flow speed should rapidly decelerate to accomodate for the cyclone's large diameter anyway.</p>

<p>Surely, this is something that someone else has already come across and tried out which one works best?</p>

<p>Images speak more than a thousand words, so here is what the vac looks like ""by default"":</p>

<ol>
<li><p>When you make frames with a homemade jig, it is often the case that the jig is at 44.8Âº through the center of the 90Âº.  You can compensate with this by making one cut on one side, and the other cut on the other side.   No regular person can notice this 'error' because of how you compensate.  </p></li>
<li><p>I am making a bed frame.  Think of an 'H' with a top bar on it.   When cutting the mortises on the top part to secure it to the two verticals (middle bar is already complete) I clamped the top bar to the completed 'H' to measure it was square.   Did the measure 6 times cut once thing, and somehow when going back to dry fit, the top part of the frame isn't 100% square.   Im measuring 62.75"" and 63.125"" . </p></li>

<p>Obviously I am a bit of a perfectionist, but when I frame a house, I can make a 40' wall vertically square and plumb to less than a eighth"" before securing.

"Can water based wood dyes be mixed to be more opaque?","<p>I'm working on building a Les Paul style guitar, with a figured maple top, and am just trying to figure out how to do the finish, to achieve a nice sunburst effect.</p>

<p>I lack the equipment and experience to do the finish with an airbrush and tinted lacquer, so I've set my sights on using water based wood dyes to rub on, and then coat with clear aerosol lacquer.</p>

<p>These are the dyes I purchased:
<a href=""https://generalfinishes.com/retail-products/water-base-wood-stains-dyes/waterbase-wood-dye-stains#.Vkn8CK6rRR4"">https://generalfinishes.com/retail-products/water-base-wood-stains-dyes/waterbase-wood-dye-stains#.Vkn8CK6rRR4</a></p>

<p>Now, these do a pretty great job, but the one thing they lack is that they are very transparent, which is great for the center of the guitar, but I'd rather have the color thicken up a bit around the edges and get more opaque, hiding the natural wood grain a little bit more.</p>

<p>The General Finishes brochure I had for these dyes stated that they could be mixed with a clear finish to create a ""toner"". I'm not entirely sure what they mean by ""toner"" in this case, but I was thinking perhaps this was would be what I was looking for.. But I also don't know which clear finish I would be able to mix it with if so.</p>

<p>The important detail is that whatever I do has to be safe to use the clear lacquer over top. I had thought maybe I could mix the dyes with a bit of polyurethane to do a second coat of color around the edges before the lacquer, but I read that this could cause issues as the lacquer shrinks over time and the poly does not, increasing my risk of chipping.</p>

<p>So I'm looking for some advice on any techniques I can use to get this more opaque coloring around the edges, without removing my ability to lacquer afterwards? Are these dyes even the best choice for me, or is there another better alternative that I can use? (without the need to get an airbrush setup going - or maybe I really do need to do that to get the best finish?)</p>

I can easily insert dowels, or biscuits, or use a finger joint block to give increased surface area.</li>
<li>Would it be better to use a minimum amount of timber pieces e.g. 3 off 200 x 600mm boards glued up to make a large 600x600mm board, or will it be better to use a higher number of narrower boards which are 600mm long, or an even higher number of boards e.g. 50mm x 200mm with some end-to-end gluing?

"How to join short boards to make a longer panel","<p>I'm pretty familiar with edge joining boards of the same width to make a panel (for a table top, cabinet door, or whatever) but I've never done a project where I also need to end join short boards, and I'm a little unsure of what order I should do the gluing in. Basically, I found several fairly short pieces of african rosewood at a great deal, and I'd like to make a desk top out of them. I'd like the desk to be 5 feet long, but most of the pieces of wood are 2.5-3 feet long.</p>

<p>Do I first need to end join each board to get the overall 5' that I want, then glue those as I would any other panel? Or should I glue different length boards to the width I want, with uneven ends, and then keep gluing those until I get the length I'm looking for?</p>

<p>For reference, this is what I'm talking about:</p>

"How brittle is carbide?","<p>I have Carbide grade tools like router bits, saw blades, etc. like everybody else. There are grades C2, C3 and C4, most of my tools are C3. They do say that it is brittle and if it hits the ground or something it shatters. I have dropped it a few times by accident but they never have broken before. Which makes me have the question as to how much it takes to break the carbide of the tools. Does it take a certain amount of pressure (like pounds or something) of impact for the carbide to shatter?

"Stair treads do not look smooth after sanding and finishing","<p>I recently bought a house and decided to remove the carpet from the stairs and install hardwood instead. To save money, I decided to buy unfinished stair treads and risers and to finish them myself. This is my first time with woodworking, so please bear with me here.</p>

<p>After researching on the web, I bought sanding paper, oil-based stains and polyurethane, and started working.</p>

<p>My first and perhaps only problem is that despite sanding for a long time with an ROS, the wood just does not seem smooth. The density of the wood seems unequal and I can see small gaps along the grain in some areas. Those areas are smooth to the touch when I run my hand along the grain, but not across the grain. See below:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/QBiFY.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/QBiFY.jpg"" alt=""Linear gaps along the grain.""></a></p>

<p>Giving up on sanding, I decided to apply stain on the surface. The areas with gaps absorb more stain, and it actually creates a good-looking color effect. However, we can clearly see that the darker areas are ""rougher"":</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/cu6O7.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/cu6O7.jpg"" alt=""Result after stain application""></a></p>

<p>Applying 2 coats of oil-based poly over this does not really fix the problem. It looks like light reflects differently on the darker areas and it doesn't look very good when placed under the light.</p>

<p>Is all of this normal? Is it because of bad wood quality? Did I just not sand enough? </p>

<p>Thanks for your help.</p>

<p>Note: the wood used is a smaller piece just for testing purposes prior to finishing the actual stair treads.</p>

"How to make bottom for a big drawer?","<p>I'm making a set of amateur under-bed ""drawers"" from scrap. Nothing fancy, just re-using materials from old closet. This is my first project of such scale.</p>

<p>There are intended to be 3 quite large drawers, 130 x 60 x 18cm on the inside. Walls are going to be made from veneered particle board (16mm thick), intended to be held together by 2 or 3 confirmat screws on each side. Bottoms are planned to be made from 3mm thick hardboard.</p>

<p>How do a I make bottom rigid enough in the case of such large drawers?</p>

<p>So far my plan is to:</p>

<ol>
<li>add 2 narrow crossbeams on the bottom (something around 60 x 5 cm), effectively splitting large 130 x 60cm area into 3 smaller ones - 40 x 60 cm. Having crossbeams pop up from the bottom by 1cm does not worry me that much.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>     |----------------------|
rear |      ||      ||      |  front
     |      ||      ||      |
     |----------------------|
           crossbeams

|    _|
|   |_   grooves on walls where hardboard slides into
|_____|

<p>If that plan sounds okay, what distance from the edge does the groove need to be and how deep can it go into 16mm thick particle board?</p>

"Reinforcing/repairing a soundboard","<p>So essentially I was making a bowed lyre (jouhikko/tagelharpa), which requires a thin spruce soundboard. I am going to make it by gluing three boards together as shown in this YouTube video:</p>

<p><a href=""https://youtu.be//watch?v=dfjMi0_kjw8"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://youtu.be//watch?v=dfjMi0_kjw8</a></p>

<p>Instead of just hollowing out a chamber through all three planks and slapping a thin board on top and bottom, I decided to thin  the top board down to the required 4mm to make the playable soundboard that would connect with the rest of the frame. However, due to a number or factors (plank was warped, I foolishly chiseled along the grain), the board became too  thin in a number of places and even cracked through in one corner. So the question is: is it still salvageable? I was thinking of eliminating the broken corner by drilling a sound hole through it, which would also stop the crack from spreading, same with other thinned places. Another option would also be to apply a sawdust and PVA paste to the thinned places to fill them in and make them stronger (the soundboard has to support 20kg of string tension). However, I'm not sure any option is optimal at all. It might hold at first even without reinforcement, but sooner or later one of the chipped places will start a crack. Maybe adding as many thin cleats as possible could prevent this splitting? I understand that the question would be more suitable for luthiers, but the situation here is simply finding a way to consolidate a spruce board that is too thin by filling in the flaked-out gaps or any other suitable approach. The treatment and its ugliness do not matter, since the repair will be on the inside- only the integrity of the soundboard. Thank you!</p>

"Strategy for Restoring an Old Rocking Chair?","<p>I'm planning on restoring an old rocking chair that has anchors holding it vertically from the sides on horizontal beams, and the beams are air nailed from the bottom. Recently, one of the anchors failed, and the rest of the wooden beams underneath the chair have stress cracks in them. I'm thinking that the best way to repair this is to cut new wood beams that have the same dimensions as the ones I need to replace. The only thing is that the beams are air nailed into the frame. Would taking a chisel to the gap in between the rest of the frame and trying to separate the beams from the frame be a wise idea? I can foresee some damage resulting from this, but if the only damage is to the beams I have to replace, this may not be so bad I think. Is this a good strategy for repairing the rocking chair?

"Is the ""paper test"" actually relevant to sharpening chisels and planes?","<p>It is pretty common to see references to the ""paper test"" for checking for sharpness of an edge -- the idea that you should be able to lightly rest the blade against the edge of a piece of paper and it should ""bite"" by itself and easily slice through the sheet with hardly any pressure. For example, out of the box a disposable safety razor blade will easily pass this test.</p>

<p>Now, I'm a beginner at woodworking and I've been trying to learn to sharpen tools -- I bought some inexpensive Dewalt chisels a long time ago and more recently a Mora whittling knife to practice sharpening with. (I've got a Stanley No 4 plane arriving soon from eBay, as well.) After a decent amount of practice (using DMT interrupted diamond stones up to Extra Fine or 3M microfinishing film on plate glass to 15u, stropped on chromium oxide on leather in both cases afterward), I'm able to get them to pass a lot of other common sharpness tests:</p>

<ol>
<li>Shaving hair cleanly (everything from coarse leg hair to very fine knuckle hair)</li>
<li>Edge catches on the surface of your thumbnail without sliding</li>
<li>No light reflects off the edge itself, no visible burr, no chips or nicks under a loupe</li>
<li>Visibly reflective/polished looking bevel surfaces near the edge</li>
<li>Edge feeling very sharp to touch with the pad of the thumb, and I cannot feel a burr on either side</li>
<li>Edge feeling extremely smooth (like glass) when drawing the tip of your fingernail along the blade</li>
<li>And most importantly, <strong>when cutting wood they leave a nice smooth surface</strong>, especially when cutting with the grain.</li>
</ol>

<p>Despite that, one thing I can <em>never</em> seem to do reliably is make them pass the ""paper test."" Usually I get intermittent results -- sometimes the paper buckles, sometimes it cuts ""alright"", but most often it cuts a short ways but then stops or jams. It's definitely not as impressive as I've seen proper razor blades do.</p>

<p>Normally I would just say the only thing that matters is how they cut wood -- but as a beginner I don't really know whether I'm experiencing more resistance than I should, or what the shavings should really look like when you try to shave end grain, and so on. In the absence of using ""properly sharp"" tools myself I really don't have a feel for what I should expect from a tactile perspective or an ""end result"" perspective.</p>

<p>So, my questions are: </p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Should I actually expect to be able to sharpen decent quality bench chisels, plane blades, whittling knives, etc. to the point they can pass the ""paper test"" when using the normal bevel angles?</strong> Or is this futile just because of the bevel angles and thicknesses of the tools involved, compared to razors which are comparatively thinner and with more acute bevel angles? For a while I was sure the dewalt chisels just had crappy steel or poor heat treatment, but, honestly, the Mora which should have decent steel/treatment has similar problems.</li>
<li><strong>Even if I could, is it a useful indicator for the tasks hand planes, bench chisels, whittling knives, etc perform?</strong> Am I missing out on a ""final level of sharpness"" or is an effortless paper-cutting edge on these tools just going to be demolished after cutting through a few inches of actual wood, even with good blade material?</li>
</ol>

<p>It would be tremendously helpful to know whether I'm getting myself frustrated over something that is either impossible or unimportant.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: After actually actually POLISHING the bevel of this chisel on the chromium oxide-on-leather -- say like 50x eight inch long passes on the bevel and 5-10x on the flat (instead of just a very light stropping), the results have improved <em>dramatically</em>. I'm able to take very thin shavings off of end grain and it looks pretty smooth. Fresh off honing it will pop some leg hair although it's not 100% -- I'm wondering if my arm hair is just too fine? -- and it also does significantly better on the paper test, although not perfectly.</p>

"In whittling how do you make the v-like cut?","<p>I recently picked up whittling and have watched several videos on how to do it properly. There's one cut, I can't quite recall the name of, where you slant the knife and cut down on two opposing sides and cut out a ""v"" shape of sorts. I had a couple spots on my piece where this cut would be useful, but when I tried to do it, I couldn't.</p>

<p>I'm wondering, is there a certain way you have to go with the grain? I'm pretty sure I was. Was the wood too hard? Was I too weak to press into the wood?
Exactly what happened was I held the wood in my left and right hands and with my right mostly attempted to press into the wood at a curved angle. In all the videos the knife goes down and makes the cut. But it was like tryingt to cut steel with a butter knife.</p>

<p>I understand this is an extradorinaly difficult question to be asking, but I'm honestly curious to know if there's any reason someone could give me as to why I couldn't make the cut? Could there have been a problem with the knife angle? Blade sharpness? Grain? Did I miss something?</p>

<p>For the toe rest, I can only think of one way to do it. It is the green rectangle in the image below.

"Why aren't belt sanders with sanding frames available anywhere?","<p>I'm not sure if this question is a fit for Stack Exchange, but I'll try to make it fit.  </p>

<p>I bought a Bosch 1274DVS 10 years ago and I was able to get an accessory 'guide'.  The guide was a frame that went around the belt sander to help prevent 'digging' into a large work piece and helping keep it level.</p>

<p>My dad would like a belt sander with this optional guide, but my model is no longer available and last year I was able to find 1 that had it as an option.  I cannot find any right now.  While this isn't how people primarily use the belt sanders, I wonder why this VERY useful accessory isn't more widely available?  Do people feel confident enough to sand a large cherry tabletop unguided?  or are there other tools that have replaced the need for this?</p>

<p>Edit: Right after writing this question, I found the guides are called 'sanding frames'...</p>

"When it comes to checking in logs what should I expect?","<p>They started clearing old ash trees from the lot where I work. There was lots of nice wood there so I took a couple pieces. One in particular a piece of green ash (so I was told by the man cutting it down) about 17"" in diameter.</p>

<p>Checking in on my wood (just to admire it I suppose) I noticed after the first day that a crack was appearing through the center of the log. I thought it was odd but wasn't <em>really</em> surprised as that is supposed to happen over time.</p>

"How to prevent table saw blade vibration gouges?","<p>I'm very new to table saws, and am having trouble getting a clean cut. The blade cuts fine most of the time, but every once in a while something goes wrong and I'll get a big gouge in the wood.</p>

<p>Here is a picture of what I mean, done on the thinner edge of a 2x4:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/r0JJw.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/r0JJw.jpg"" alt=""gouge""></a></p>

<p>I've measured the depth of the gouge, and it's 15 thou. That seems really extreme, especially considering how smooth and perfect the rest of the cut is. This kind of gouge makes fine furniture impossible.</p>

<p>I know the table saw is correctly aligned; that's the first thing I did when I got it. The fence is parallel to the blade, and the arbor has practically no run-out. A splitter was set-up behind the blade, and the blade I used was brand spanking new.</p>

"How can I make precise corner or notch cuts on the edge of a board?","<p>I am planning my first cabinetry project, and having difficulty with some of the shapes in my design. I would like to have notches along the edge of some large boards. There are two types of notches:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>At the bottom of a board for the sides of the cabinet, the corner is cut in for a recessed kick plate. This seems common, and is clearly used in my kitchen and bathroom cabinets. I don't understand how to get a precise cut that meets in an interior angle.</p></li>
<li><p>Along the front, wide but relatively shallow notches. This will allow a board running horizontally to be recessed flush with the edge of the board, as a front for a shelf (in green).

<p>I have used my jigsaw or chisel for similar cuts on other projects. While I wasn't aiming for high precision on those projects, it seems too sloppy to achieve the precision for cabinetry.</p>

<p>I have just purchased a good table saw and router, and am a complete novice with them. I have thought about standing the board on edge and cutting in to get a clean cut, using a dado or many passes for the edge notch, but that seems awkward and quite dangerous. This does seem plausible with a sled jig assuming the blade can cut deep enough, but I don't have any experience and making one seems like a significant task itself!</p>

<p>Using the router might help, but would leave a radius on the inside edge that I don't want.</p>

<p>A limited selection of failed strategies so far:</p>

<ul>
<li>Setting on pointy edge of aluminum angles - marks finish; or pulls a line off if finish is still tacky</li>
<li>Setting on pointy edge of wood triangles - same as above.</li>
<li>Setting on wood spacers - spacers soak stain out of piece, worse depending on what type of wood the spacers are</li>

<li>Large standard drill bit</li>
<li>Hand-turned countersink</li>

<p>Countersinking before drilling the whole is clearly the best, at least for the plywood I'm using. The hand-turned bit could potentially work with a bit more care too; the hole itself is nice and round. Maybe needs a sharper bit.</p>

"What is the best finish for wood in a bathroom","<p>I have nearly finished making a small table which will be placed in a bathroom. I am concerned about protecting the wood in a humid/damp environment.</p>

<p>The bathroom can get quite humid while people are having showers etc, and in winter it can take some time to fully dry out. I want to avoid any mould growth or other damage from moisture.</p>

<p>The table is made from softwood - partly reclaimed pine from an old patio door, and partly non-specific softwood from a big DIY store. I want to keep a natural wood look, so no paint or opaque finishes. Ideally, I would go for something not too glossy - a silk or mid-sheen finish.</p>

<p>I have had good results with Danish oil before, but for this I want something more hard-wearing.</p>

<p>I see polyurethane varnish used as the default finish for a lot of things these days. However, I find that (where I live anyway) there's a wider range of non-poly varnishes available than polyurethane varnishes.</p>

"Building a Cabin; only un-powered hand tools. Need advice","<p>Recently I had a crazy plan. And I need some advice about how to go about doing it. </p>

<p>I wanted to build a small garden shed, more kinda like a cabin actually. 
So I started drawing it out, and listing the timber I would need. But then I started thinking... What if I would build it by just buying a bunch of logs, and do it the old fashioned way? </p>

<p>Note that I live in Belgium, all wood needs to be bought from a nearby mill. </p>

<p>Several reason why I want to attempt this, but that doesn't really matter. </p>

<p>First thing first, the design! 
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/vayn5.png"" alt=""Cabin Design"">
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/gU0Kk.png"" alt=""Beam structure"">
Info about the design: it is 6 meters in length en 3 meters across. Top beam also at 3meters height. </p>

<p>The first thing I want to try is hewing the beams myself.<br>
Few questions:
- I read somewhere it is best to use fairly fresh cut threes for this, to make the hewing easier. But how long do I need to dry them afterwards before using? If I just seal and use them directly will I risk the whole thing cracking and becoming askew? 
- which woods would be suitable for this? I need to buy the logs, and thought about asking some pine, because it will be cheaper then buying maple logs. But are all pine threes suitable for this? Or do I need to specifically ask for lariks or Douglas? Or is poplar, or something else worth the extra price? </p>

<p>I think that I will first try my hand at the hewing, and then see if I (we) am up to milling the rest by hand also.</p>

<p>Note that I want to only use hand tools, and no power tools. Hewing will be done by axe. Other milling would be done by saw and axe also. This might seem crazy (it probably is), but there are several reasons to work this way. </p>

<p>Any more advance on making this project work would be welcome! I have some woodworking experience, and a number of tools (mostly hand tools). </p>

<p>Thanks for all advice! </p>

"Two piece workbench top","<p>I've finally gotten close to finishing the workbench that the kind people here have given me input on (<a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/q/5938/3638"">Need help understanding workbench design and build process</a>).</p>

<p>I currently have two top slabs, each made up of eight glued-up/laminated 2x4s.  I am still thinking about attaching them to the frame with dowels.  </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Rather than gluing these two slabs together to form a giant slab, would it be acceptable to leave the top as two separate slabs, and attach each with a dowel on each side? The portability and lighter weight of two top slabs would be a benefit as the workbench may be moved occasionally.</p></li>
<li><p>If that's okay, due to the fact that the frame is 24 inches deep and the slabs each ended up being around 11.75 inches deep after planing and gluing, is it okay to leave a gap in the middle?  I've seen some benches with a trough in between two slabs, but never with a gap.</p></li>
<li><p>Is a .75"" dowel an acceptable size to use in a frame member that is only 1.5"" wide, leaving only .375"" on each side of the dowel?  </p></li>
<li><p>After I plane and attach the top, should this be left unfinished or are there acceptable methods of finishing to make the cheap pine look a little nicer and/or provide durability?</p></li>

"Are there any special concerns when finishing ambrosia maple?","<p>""Ambrosia maple"" is, as I understand it, a form of spalting caused when insects burrow into the tree and introduce a fungus. It produces darker stains through the light-colored wood, roughly following the grain direction, ranging from a few isolated streaks to a chaos of overlapping ""brush strokes"". The holes are also present, of course, to add a bit more character.</p>

<p>It's often surprisingly inexpensive for a fancy wood, perhaps because the standard grading system considers it a flaw rather than a feature.</p>

<p>One of the local woodworking stores got a batch of this, and I picked out a few boards I liked for a project. (Blanket chest, so I'm leaning toward one or two splashes of pattern per side, possibly with a more chaotic/denser pattern on the lid.)</p>

<p>Question is, is there a recommended finishing technique that will best display the color and detail of the spalted patterns? Or should I just finish it as I would any maple project, going light on added color to let the contrast be seen? There's also the question of whether to fill the holes with colored epoxy or leave them.</p>

<p>Some of this, of course, will be a matter of taste. But if there are any known tricks or pitfalls...</p>

<p>The measurements I'm going for is 1700(start of the top beam)x1700x2100mm. The main beams are 98x98mm, middle beam 98x48mm and the crossbeams are 48x48mm. I will probably use pine for the beams and spruce for the rest to  save some money. What I'm wondering is if this will hold the weight that gets on a double bed. I looked at <a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/questions/2144/joining-corners-in-a-loft-bed"">this</a> and some other, but they where all single beds and as i understand 98x98mm should hold a single bed just fine. Will these plans hold a double bed and does anyone know of a ballpark of how much weight it can hold?</p>

"Using thick branches to make an end-grain cutting board?","<p>About 2 months ago my grandparents cut down 80% of an old cherry tree (topped it). There were some big branches/thin trunks that ended up in their massive compost piles (my grandad like his compost piles...)

"How could I have designed this cabinet to avoid assembly and alignment problems?","<p>I built this wall-hanging cabinet with a door on the front that opens upwards (plain old hinges on exterior face, not installed yet) (there's space on the back for a cleat, not super apparent in images below):</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/boVgE.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/boVgE.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>It did not assemble well. It is not usable. It was assembled like so; consider the following drawing:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/KPtwr.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/KPtwr.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<ol>
<li>I built the side and door frames. Pocket hole joints used for frame components because I had to assemble to chamfer inner edges before finishing, but had to disassemble to insert the screens after finishing.</li>
<li>I cut the three panels and glued them together, just butt joint. When gluing I clamped around the outside in line with the vertical panel and inserted spacers as well.</li>
<li>I then glued the side frames on.</li>
</ol>

<p>The frames are pine and the panels are 7/16"" ply.</p>

<p>Now, I had designed, measured, followed the rule of cutting to reality instead of design, dry fit and dry fit again, followed all the rules I've discovered (make all same-length cuts at once without adjusting settings, all that, etc), but still I ran into the following issues:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The top and bottom panels weren't glued at perfect right angles. I had to apply significant force to hold them true when gluing the sides on.</p></li>
<li><p>Gaps, somehow things weren't flat any more when assembled:
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ukw2K.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ukw2K.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p></li>
<li><p>Panels were too short vertically, and it was inconsistent (some corners looked OK, others were way off):
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/CgVOu.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/CgVOu.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p></li>
<li><p>Biggest of all, the door, despite looking fine throughout the whole process, was somehow magically a good 1/8"" or so too wide at the end, and with gaps on the sides:
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZdjKA.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZdjKA.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p></li>
<li><p>Also the top panel was bowed downwards in the center, mostly as a result of the forces applied to the edges trying to make it straight when gluing the sides on; problematic because the hinges need to go there:
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/GHmuq.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/GHmuq.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p></li>
</ul>

<p>Now, I think the frames (sides and door) came together well, and almost all of the problems were due to various issues with the panels. I shouldn't have even proceeded to glue it up to begin with after noticing that the panels weren't 90 degrees. I also didn't do that one final dry fit. I'm not sure where in the building and finishing process I lost material on the panels. The frames are sized consistently with each other.</p>

<p>I have since cut the sides off, removed the panel stubs, and refinished the sides, so I have a second chance at this. I now have the frames, assembled and finished, ready to go again.</p>

<p>So my question is: <strong>How could I have designed this differently from the start (particularly joining the panels to the frames) that could have both avoided all these problems and also lessen the tolerances that I needed to cut things to?</strong></p>

<p>And how can I salvage it given that I have the sides detached again? </p>

<p>As far as salvaging goes: What I am <em>thinking</em> is rabbeting the top and bottom of the side frames, and cutting a slot in the side frames for the vertical, and also cutting a slot in the top and bottom panels for the vertical. Then the top and bottom will be flush, and any slop / inaccuracies in the back can be hidden in the slots. And I won't glue the panels to each other first, instead I'll glue the sides and panels all in one shot. My side frames probably aren't flat any more anyways due to sanding so even if I wanted to butt them against the panels I don't think it would work now. Does this seem reasonable? The minor downside is just aesthetic; it will make the side frames appear thinner than the door from the top and bottom, and you'll see the rabbets with the door open. The other alternative is biscuits, although the plywood feels a bit thin for that.</p>

<p>How would you have built this cabinet, from the start, to avoid the problems?</p>

<p>However does glue add some thickness between the 4 pieces? I'm counting on the fact that it would result in getting close to an overall thickness of 3""... am I right?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<h2>Update:</h2>

<p>Trying to fit posts with rails, all of them consisting of 4 pieces joined together. Each piece, before being glued together, is cut with the necessary shape for either a mortise or tenon.</p>

"Is sealing wood with urethane or the like enough to avoid wood movement?","<p>Will a solid wood table top still move if it is finished from all sides with polyurethane or some other water resistant finish?</p>

<p>Does that depend on temperature as well? Assuming temperature differences are big enough comparing to when wood was finished (furniture left outside for example).</p>

<p>Is that calling for trouble in case of incomplete seal or when finish gets inevitably breached by normal wear and wood starts to take up moisture again?</p>

"Tasmanian Blackwood - hairline cracks?","<p>I'm a newbie to this community and appreciate being able to ask this question:</p>

<p>Is Blackwood suseptable to hairline cracking across the end grain of quartersawn wood ?</p>

<p>I'm building a solid body guitar from 2 x pieces of very dry Blackwood blanks and after routing the body shape, sanded the body edge with 80 grit at the advice of a cabinetmaker, with the view to move up in grit to 320. </p>

<p>After a few runs around the body I noticed some scratches where the 2 quartersawn blanks meet on the bottom end of the body. </p>

<p>So Ive tried sanding them out with 120, but after removing a good couple of mm, I am doubting these are scratches from the 80 grit. They seem to just keep going into the timber. </p>

<p>Is Blackwood susceptible to cracking across the end grain ? The photo shows the area, the hairline cracks runs at 90 degrees to the Blackwood grain.</p>

I used biscuits to join the boards lengthwise and Titebond III glue on the biscuits. When I took the clamps off the seams looked great. Now, a week later, the seam in the middle of the table has opened up about 1/16-1/8 in and you can see the biscuit. I've tried to squeeze it back shut, but no luck. Any ideas?

"Materials and finish for an office chair mat?","<p>I want to build a chair mat for the desk in my home office which has high pile carpet. It gets heavy use and I'm tired of buying a new plastic one every year or so. The last one I got was from Costco and supposedly super heavy-duty.

<p>The dimensions needed are approximately 50""x60"", no more than Â¾"" think.</p>

<p>What would be good to use to construct it? I'm assuming wood will last much longer, but suspect using solid lumber might be too heavy, although I've read good things about bamboo and it's fairly light (even if not actually wood). That leaves plywood, possibly hardwood-veneered if it would make it last longer (or be advantageous in some other way beside looking nice).</p>

"Should I joint my workpieces first or cut them to rough size first?","<p>I'm looking to build a couple simple picture frames. I don't have a jointer or planer, so would use my table saw or split-fence router for those operations. Even with those tools, though, it seems that running an 8' board over the jointer would be a bit difficult. Is it a problem to cut the 8' board into more manageable lengths (2-3') before jointing / planing them? I figure I'll lose any grain continuity I might have had by going this route, but that's not a problem.</p>

<p>Given that I will be using a table saw to joint the faces of the boards, it would be much easier to rip them to rough width (~1.5-2"") beforehand as well. Would this pose any problems? Will I wind up with workpieces that are slightly different sizes by going this route? </p>

<p>Should I attach it from below, screwing into the bottom of the workbench, allowing the threaded screw and rods to be visible if you look under the bench, and also screw the rear face into the front of the bench?  This would make the tops of the vise faces a couple inches below the top of the workbench.  Would I then add wooden jaw liners that are taller than the vise faces to end up with a clamping area that is flush with the bench top?</p>

<p>Or, should I attach it by drilling into the front face of the bench top to make holes for the screw and other two rods, and ignoring the bottom mounting holes, to get the vise faces flush with the top to begin with?  It seems like a drawback here would be that if I need to plane the bench top flat in the future, I would end up with a vise now mounted slightly above the top of the bench.</p>

"Raw/Pure Tung Oil finish - seeping issues","<p>PLEASE: IF responding to this post, do NOT reply unless you know the difference between Raw/Pure/Unadulterated Tung Oil, Polymerized Tung Oil, and what is marketed as ""Tung Oil Finish"" -- or tell me why Raw/Pure Tung Oil is bad, and other finished are better, or to sand everything off and use Poly or Varnish instead. I have used Raw/Pure Tung Oil (100% Pure Raw Tung Oil from Real Milk Paint company) MANY times with great success, and this is my first problem. I am mid-way through this project, and am only interested in replies from those with EXPERIENCE with Raw Tung Oil that address what I should do NOW to fix it.</p>

<p>I'm finishing a table with Acacia/Rubberwood butcher block type top and it seems that the large pores of the Acacia are giving me trouble.</p>

<p>I followed the usual steps I always do: flooding with 50/50 Tung/Citrus Solvent for the first application, 75/25 for the 2nd, and about 85/15 or 90/10 for the third.</p>

<p>The second and third coats I also wet-sanded the oil in using 0000 Steel Wool and then wiped the sludge away thoroughly.</p>

<p>Between each coat, I wiped all excess oil off and waited for at least 4 days in between each. It took much longer to dry than I've ever experienced. But I know each coat was DRY (not of course CURED) -- because between each, I sanded lightly with either 220 sandpaper or the Steel Wool, and the dust was a fine white powder - no gummy residue, indicating it was dry enough to add another coat.</p>

<p>(I live in FL, but I have the table inside where it is normally air-conditioned to 76 degrees, so the humidity is NOT high. To aid in the drying I turned the AC down to 72 so the air would be even drier.)</p>

<p>After each coat, I noticed that the oil was continually seeping out of the pores, so I was wiping it off about every 15-20 minutes for the first 8-12 hours, and then several times a day for the next 2-3 days. Again, I've never experienced this before, and I'm sure it has to do with the large pores of the Acacia.</p>

<p>Still, the first 2 coats went on fine and were completely dry before applying the next coat.</p>

<p>On the third application, I kept wiping and buffing as usual, and all was fine until the third morning when I checked it, oil had seeped out overnight and DRIED, so now there are dozens of tiny spots that are glossier than the rest of the table. They're not white -- just glossier than the rest of the table -- and you can only see them if you look at the table close to eye level in certain light, but the table is not as smooth where the dried oil is. </p>

<p>In an attempt to fix, I tried sanding with 0000 Steel Wool and then wiping down with pure Citrus Solvent - and then it was like a dam broke, and oil was seeping out of the pores all over! I was able to wipe that away, but the previously dried spots are still there - the steel wool and Citrus Solvent didn't touch them. Also, the Citrus Solvent seemed to dry out the rest of the table and make it duller.</p>

<p>On a small section of the table, I tried using a 3M white Final Finishing Pad (which is like a Scotchbrite ""scrubby"") and a bit of Tung to see if that would break up the dried spots, but that did nothing.</p>

<p>My plan was to do 1-2 more final coats, this time of 100% pure Tung - no Citrus Solvent. However, I don't want to do that until I know the best way to proceed.</p>

<p>Should I wait for several weeks to make sure the oil IN the pores is fully cured, and then sand and do a coat of pure Tung Oil, wet-sanding in various steps from medium to fine, to try to get rid of the spots?</p>

<p>Or, if I wait for it to thoroughly dry, and sand, and then just apply the pure Tung, will the Tung eventually build up so the rest of the table is as glossy as the spots, so it won't be noticed? </p>

<p>Or, if I wait for several weeks and apply Polymerized Tung -- which has a glossier finish -  will that bring the rest of the table to the level of gloss of the pores, making it uniform? I've never used Polymerized Tung before.</p>

<p>I really do not want to sand everything off and start over.</p>

<p>Any advice would be appreciated!</p>

<p>Many thanks,</p>

<p>I was moving an empty wood file cabinet down some stairs; I goofed, which caused the back casters to get ripped out of the bottom of the wood part of the cabinet. As a result, on the bottom face, and part of the back edge on the cabinet were damaged. I'll need some wood filler.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/NLV72.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/NLV72.jpg"" alt=""""></a></p>

<p>Here's how the cabinet &amp; casters look.</p>

<h2>Here's my plan</h2>

<p><strong>The Resources I have</strong></p>

<p>I'm able to clamp a board along the edge to keep it straight. I also have all kinds of glue, I was able to recover some parts of the MDF that came loose (I have sawdust, I have access to scrap paper (for paper pulp), I have similar veneer, I have similar stain, and I have a few other relevant tools for the job.</p>

<p><strong>Planned Approach</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Fixing the MDF: I'm planning on mixing a glue/sawdust/wood-filler/mdf/sawdust mixture up, clamping the board in place, applying the glue, letting the glue dry, removing the clamps and board, and then sanding it down.</p></li>
<li><p>Fixing the edge: If it looks good; I won't veneer it over. However, if it's bad, I'll sand it all down, and then apply new veneer. After the veneer's applied, I'll finish it.</p></li>
<li><p>Reapplying the casters: For this step, I'll just put them further towards the front slightly, maybe an inch or two depending on what I need. This will be done to ensure the casters are secured.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Clarification on the question &amp; Answers I'd like</h2>

<p><strong>Clarification</strong>
My main question is with regards in the wood filler used. The bottom panel of the cabinet is maybe 3/4"" thick, and of that 3/4"" maybe 1/8"" or 1/16"" is affected by the missing mdf. I want it to be smooth when I remove the clamped board, so that minimal wood filler sticks to it. I.E., when I remove the board I don't want to take any MDF with it.</p>

<p><strong>Answers I'd like</strong></p>

<p>Is there a specific kind of filler that would set well? If so, how much sawdust do I use?</p>

<p>The one part in the sharpening process that I'm struggling with is removing the burr. As I'm attempting to deburr one side, it twists and goes to the other. I flip the chisel and the burr twists to the other side again. I can't seem to completely remove it. Some people lay the chisel flat on the stone and push against the edge. Others pull. Others go sideways. They all claim their method yields great results (I can't seem to get rid of the damned thing).</p>

<li>Do the same thing with the primary bevel.</li>
<li>Do the same thing with the secondary bevel.</li>
</ol>

<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/CgmUk.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/CgmUk.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>What is the best way to do this? I was thinking about using a saw blade that is wider than the slats are thick â so each time I would just have to saw in once and that would be it. Obviously I would need pretty thin wood slats in that case (a few millimeters of MDF maybe?).
Is this possible? Feasible?
I have access to a chop saw and a buzz saw (both currently have blades not wider than 2mm) but I'm new to woodworking.</p>

<p>Is this even the best way to create such a grid? </p>

"Best way to drill a concentric hole with a lathe","<p>I'm new to turning and recently decided to make some pepper mills.  Starting with squareish stock I roughed the pieces to round and then started drilling several concentric holes of different sizes using forstner bits on the lathe.  Somebody gave me the feedback that I should use the largest drill bit first and not to drill any pilot holes.  In other words if I need a 1.5"" through hole and a 2.5"" hole at 1"" depth then I should drill the 2.5"" hole first followed by the 1.5"" hole.  This flies in the face of everything I've been taught, but the explanation was that the forstner bits do better without large pilot hole (e.g. from another forstner bit).</p>

<p>In any event I was able to drill the holes into the work pieces, but as I did this I noticed that the drill bit appeared to be wobbling rather substantially (it looked like the work piece was ""pulling"" the bit such that it wasn't always inline with the axis of rotation.  I assume that this is because the drill bit didn't enter the piece perfectly inline with the axis of rotation though for the first ~1.5"" I couldn't tell and it looked good).  This was especially true when I used a drill bit extension to get the depth I needed (I started swapping in the extension only when I needed it rather than starting with it for deeper holes).</p>

<p>After I drilled the holes I used a cone/chuck to hold the piece in place for sanding/finishing.  On several pieces I noticed that the through holes were not concentric with the outer surface of the work piece.  In other words when I'd pull the spindle off the lathe I'd notice that the through hole appeared to be at a slight angle relative to the outer surface.</p>

<p>What's the best way to drill a hole that is ""perfectly"" concentric with the outer surface of a work piece on a lathe?  Is it better to drill first and then rough/round?  Should I in fact be using a pilot hole?  Am I not securing the piece in the chuck properly prior to drilling?</p>

"Is the wood worm active or not?","<p>I live in India [tamilnadu]. Recently we are building our new home with wooden frames for the windows and doors, but the wood being used contains strange markings. When asking the carpenter about it, he reported that they were the rings of the tree. Typically I don't trust him because it had small holes within them. The wood being used is country wood [African] which the carpenter bought for making the frames and doors. I've attached the photos taken around most of the places where I find them as bug active zones.</p>

<p>For my satisfaction, I went to many places to verify whether it's worm active or bug affected. Something like that. I got a 50/50 answer, half I consulted said it was active but half denied it. </p>

"What's a good way to cut a board parallel to its face?","<p>I have some thick boards that I'd like to make thinner.  Generally I would thickness plane the board, but in this case I'd like to reduce the thickness of the board by about half (e.g. from 2"" thick to 1"" thick or 1"" thick to .5"" thick).  Thickness planning would be a real waste of material in this case.  Is there a good way to cut a board parallel to its face such that I end up with one board of a desired thickness and another board of the original thickness - saw blade width - desired thickness?  What kind of surface finish can I expect on the new face of the two resulting boards?  The boards in question are roughly 8"" wide.

"How can I deal with wood from DIY stores that is crooked and may or may not be dry?","<p>I've been meaning to build a desk for a while now. I made a design with millimeter accuracy, but when I went to the home improvement store, I found that all the beams they had were crooked! Some more than others, but the only non-crooked wood they had was chipboard (particle board in the US), but it didn't come in any shape I needed. </p>

<p>So, back home I did some research on wood. It appears there are several different types, most importantly regularized or unregularized. Basically one is allowed to be crooked, the other isn't. I couldn't find any exact specifications though as to what qualifies as straight (surely, no beam is perfectly straight, right?).</p>

<p>Another important bit I stumbled over is that some regularized wood is not completely dried out: does that mean it could become crooked over time?</p>

<p>Then I looked into straightening the wood, but this doesn't seem to be a very viable option unless you're building a porch or something. </p>

<p>I went back to the store and asked if they had any regularized and dry wood. They didn't know what I was talking about. Just pointed me towards the piles of planks and beams and said it's really good wood!</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>If wood is ""regularized"" and not dried, could it become crooked over time?</li>
<li>How can I tell if wood is completely dry or just sort of dry?</li>
<li>If I were to find some unregularized wood that's reasonably straight, would it most likely stay that way?</li>
<li>If I were to find a suitable shape of that wood that's made of chipboard, is that a viable option? I've only seen it in cheap furniture, mostly where a chip has broken off from what used to be a screw hole.</li>

"Bad technique vs inadequate equipment for beginner woodworker","<p>This may be a bit too broad for this site, but I hope that it's specific enough to stay. If not, I'll close it.</p>

<p>I was cutting 1/2"" and 3/4"" plywood (blondewood from Lowes), had Lowes make a few cuts to get it into more easily-managed sized pieces, and had my father-in-law helping to wrangle the wood during the cut. I ripped a 1/2"" off a 76"" long, 40"" wide piece of 1/2"" plywood, and cut a 40""x56"" piece of 3/4"" down to 35 1/2""x37 1/16"". My tablesaw is a 10"" <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B00LRY9DU6"" rel=""nofollow"">Craftsman Evolv</a>, which has a ~24""x18"" table, with the blade approx 10"" from one side and 14"" from the other.</p>

<p>So, my overall question is: is it poor technique leading to those problems or is my tablesaw not up to the job of ripping down larger pieces of wood? </p>

<p>Some related follow up questions: is it just that my blade needs a cleaning or sharpening? Or maybe I need a different blade (I'm using the stock 24T blade it came with)? Should I not even use the tablesaw for breaking down plywood, but a circular saw instead (I had similar burning problems previously with my circular saw)? I suspect that the tabletop is just too small to work with big pieces of wood, but short of buying more wood to try it, I'm not sure.</p>

"Reuse old cedar clapboards?","<p>(I'm not sure if this question belongs in this forum.  If not, feel free to delete it.)</p>

<p>I have some old (c 1950?) cedar clapboards that I'd like to re-install.  However, some are cracked.  Some of the cracks are from being nailed through the (thin) top, which I won't do.  Others, though, have running cracks in the 'body', not apparently due to nailing. </p>

<p>I wouldn't use the cracked ones; but, I'm concerned that the cracking might indicate that <em>all</em> the boards are apt to crack, and shouldn't be trusted.</p>

<p>Also, would further splitting just/mostly be a result of nailing?  Because, I can pre-drill the nail holes.</p>

<p>Update: I used them.  No splitting.  In fact, it went a lot better in that regard than new finger-jointed clapboards - the old ones were very forgiving.</p>

"Reading a hardwood dealer's price list for plywood","<p>I've seen <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2FNYJMkP-o"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The Wood Whisperer's video</a> about some of the terms and such you see at a hardwood dealer, but it deals mostly with solid wood. There are some topics he doesn't touch on, like the various grades of plywood. I have the price list from my local hardwood dealer:</p>

<p>and there are several terms / abbreviations there: L/C, V/C, PS, RC, A-1, D-3, etc. Depending on the wood species, there's only 1 option to choose from (like Cherry), so if I want plywood with that veneer, I have to get that grade / quality / whatever, or go elsewhere. But, if I'm looking for e.g., Baltic Birch, I have 2 options (4B and 3B), or if I want regular Birch, I can choose B-2 V/C or A-1 L/C.</p>

<p>What do these terms / abbreviations mean, and when would I choose one over another? Are these standardized among hardwood dealers, or will they all have their own system?</p>

"How should I go about restoring rusty clamps?","<p>I've inherited about thirty or so clamps that I'd like to restore. Except for some rust and a some missing plastic/rubber pads, they work great. The clamps include a bunch from Bessey and ShopFox that I'm especially fond of. </p>

<p>The biggest problem is the rust. So far, when I've used them I just put a spacer in between the work piece and the clamps, but I'd like to not have to do that. Additionally, I'm worried that the rust is going to continue to spread. And of course, there's the vanity aspect -- I'd like my tools to look as nice as they can.</p>

<p>These ShopFox clamps are a decently representative sample of what I'm facing:</p>

<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/aDAwZ.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/aDAwZ.jpg"" alt=""The smaller clamps, closer view""></a></p>

<p>My first instinct is to take the clamps apart, but they aren't built to be serviced. They seem to have some sort of rivet at the bottom of the bar that prevents the movable jaw from falling off. The smaller clamps also have a rivet holding the fixed jaw in place. The larger clamp in the picture doesn't have a rivet holding the fixed jaw; I'm not sure what is keeping it on or whether I can get it off.</p>

<p>I'd like to clean up the rust on the bars. For the smaller clamps, I could sand as much of what I can see easily enough without taking them apart. But I'm not sure if that would mess up the finish of the black bars? For the larger clamp, there are serrations on the bar, and I am not sure what I should do to remove the rust on that. Naval jelly? Something else?</p>

<p>My primary concern is the rust, but sometimes I go overboard on projects like this, and so I'm also wondering what kind of paint would be appropriate to touch up the jaws. I'm not sure I want to go that far. But on the other hand, once I've gone to the trouble, sometimes it's nice to go the whole way. Also, is it possible to buy replacement pads for the jaws, or am I out of luck on that?</p>

"Can I stain damp plywood","<p>I managed to rescue some 3/8 interior grade birch plywood I had sitting outside from a surprise rain storm last night but not before it took some water. I had been planning on staining the pieces today.</p>

"Shelves inside cupboard, how to attach to legs?","<p>My bathroom has a small cupboard/closet built into the wall, and I'd like to put some shelves inside it. Since I don't own the property, I'm thinking of building a free-standing set of shelves that fit exactly into the inside of the closet, so that I don't have to screw anything into the wall and can remove it easily when moving. </p>

<p>The footprint of the inside looks like this</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/fsGW1.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/fsGW1.jpg"" alt=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/fsGW1.jpg""></a></p>

<p>I used the white stone texture for walls. The top and sides are walls, bottom is the part where the door is.</p>

<p>The whole thing looks like this</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/PSClj.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/PSClj.jpg"" alt=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/PSClj.jpg""></a></p>

<p>Again white stone is the (inwards facing) walls, and the wood texture is where I want the shelves to be. As you can see, halfway up the opening there is a horizontal board (I think it's meant as a laundry chute, but I don't use it for that), so there are actually two openings into one connected space. Because of this, I won't be able to construct the whole thing and place it in: I'll have to partially construct it and then assemble inside of the cupboard.</p>

<p>I made a sketch combining various ideas I had for a general design</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/pzGd7.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/pzGd7.jpg"" alt=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/pzGd7.jpg""></a></p>

<p>I'm assuming I'll be able to find some kind of 1/4"" thick board for the shelves, and 3/8"" x 3/8"" square beams (this is the largest size I can easily hide behind the natural corners of the cupboard, but I can make it larger). I also left 1/16"" space between individual pieces to make it easier to model. The shelves are meant to be about 12"" high.</p>

<p>My question is, how do I actually attach the shelves to the posts in a way that it won't collapse easily? These will hold a few towels and toilet papers, so the combined load will be &lt;10 lbs, but I'd like to support a more reasonably weight like 20-40 lbs. I am planning to use the cheapest wood I can find at Home Depot.</p>

<p>My first idea was to use diagonal trusses</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/9X4zZ.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/9X4zZ.jpg"" alt=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/9X4zZ.jpg""></a></p>

<p>This picture shows two variants: I could attach the two top ends to each other with a bracket, with the shelf resting on them. Or I could put a horizontal beam and attach the trusses with L-brackets. The problem with the beam is that I'm not sure how to handle the intersection of the two beams at the corner (not shown here) - for example, if I use L-brackets, wouldn't the screws from the two edges bump into each other? Also, I'm worried cutting the diagonal corners will be challenging, since I don't have much equipment (I don't have a mitre box, so I'd be freehanding a dremel). In this version, the vertical posts would probably be single uninterrupted ~24"" long pieces.</p>

<p>Another idea I had was this diagonal beam assembly under the shelf</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/PkX86.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/PkX86.jpg"" alt=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/PkX86.jpg""></a></p>

<p>I would attach the two cross beams with T-brackets, and the ends of the beams would rest on top of the posts, I can put a dowel to keep the post from falling inwards. This should brace it enough and also support the shelf. I would still have to cut diagonal corners, but for this it doesn't have to be very precise and I could simply lay the crossbeams on the shelf itself and use it as a template/guide. I can't tell if this is actually a realistic construction, though. In this case the posts would actually be two pieces, so this would essentially be two separate single shelves stacked on top of each other.</p>

<p>I suppose another option is to just use back and side boards like in a freestanding shelf. That would probably be the easiest and most sturdy option, but I feel like since I'll be snug against 3 walls here, I might as well save some material.</p>

<p>What is the best solution in this case?</p>

Do you think I could mount 6"" CBNs and have this configuration work for grinding gouges, etc.?

"How to hide base dados behind box joint corners","<p>I donât have any photos on me so hopefully I can describe this ok. Say I build a box like so:</p>

<ol>
<li>Cut the four sides.</li>
<li>Cut dado in bottom of each side, on table saw (I donât have another good way), which means they extend end-to-end.</li>
<li>Join the four sides with box joints or dovetails, for aesthetics.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now there is a problem. Because the slots in the sides are cut end-to-end, they knock out an exposed piece at the bottom of the corner joints, leaving conspicuous holes where the corners overlap the slots. Also, once the base is in place, the sides of the base are visible through these holes. Because there are dadoes in all four sides, there is no way to cut the joints to hide the holes.</p>

<p>How can I avoid this? Is there a trick? A different kind of corner joint? So far the only thing Iâve done is cut plugs to fit in the holes, but then the grain doesnât match up properly and they still look like a sloppy patch job (which they are).</p>

"Are brass plated screws sufficient to avoid black staining in oak? / Alternatives","<p>I am working on a desk picture frame made of white oak, and I have a hinge and some turn buttons that included brass plated screws in the package.

"How do you pick a joint?","<p>For a novice working on a design, picking a joint seems a very daunting task. There are many different kinds and it isn't easy to pick the most appropriate one. How to position the different elements, and where the main stress vectors lie is somewhat intuitive, but joints appear to have developed significantly over the centuries and there are many non-obvious innovations that a novice is unlikely to re-invent on his own. Moreover, the ""obvious"" solutions that would readily occur to a novice (like a butt joint with nails) are often regarded as inappropriate.</p>

<p>If you search for ""best joints to use"", often the results have a lot of joints that would require specialized tools one might not have access to.

"Pores on the face of an end grain chopping board","<p>I recently bought a Hevea chopping board which the manufacturer had annoyingly engraved their logo into, creating a small trap for food particles. It was pretty cheap so I figured I'd keep it and just sand down the logo. </p>

<p>It seems that in doing this I've opened some pores in the surface, which I'm concerned might be able to hide food contaminants. I was wondering if there is a way to close these pores? Did I simply take off the finishing, and what is a food safe way to finish a chopping board? </p>

"How to finish a section of log for outside?","<p>A tree surgeon just took down a sycamore that had been growing in my neighbour's garden (and probably underneath my house), and I kept a section of it to use to make a front door sign. </p>

<p>My current plan is to create a stencil of the house number, mark it on, and then carve out the number using my Dremel. </p>

<p>My question is: once this is done, what's the best way to finish the wood so that I can keep it outside? </p>

<p>Edit: for context, this will be essentially fully exposed to the elements. The idea is to put it next to my doorstep. I'm not too fussed about the colour from light brown to dark brown, so long as it's recognisable as wood.</p>

<p>Second edit: thanks for all the great comments so far, which are suggesting dealing with the drying problem first. However, assuming that I dry it out, what is the best way to finish it for outside?</p>

"Properly securing a ramp","<p>I'm building a 2'x2', 3 floor parking garage for my son.  I've built the core structure out of 1/2"" plywood, with dowels supporting it, and 3/16"" chalkboard-paper lined plywood glued on top of the plywood on each level (for eventually allowing parking spots to be drawn on and such).  The levels are about 6"" apart.</p>

<p>I created two cut-outs for the ramps (ie, cut out about a 8""x3"" section, both to leave room for the ramp and to be used for the ramp itself), but I'm working out now how to attach them properly.  What would be the best way in terms of surviving a three or four year old's level of play to attach them while still keeping it looking more or less like a parking garage?</p>

<p>My thoughts were either a hinge (like a door hinge) to attach to the top level and a smaller hinge on the bottom level, or to use a wooden triangle to screw it to.  The angle will be about 30 degrees or so (yes, probably unrealistic, but it seems about to match what other products use).  Is there a better option?  What should I keep in mind while doing this?</p>

"Routing boards without burn","<p>It seems when I utilize routers, they always seem to burn the edge of the board at some point in the cut.

<ul>
<li>Should you see better results using a routing table instead of locking the board and using the router freehand?</li>
<li>Old vs. new router bits</li>
<li>Speed of the router (or power output), does it make a difference?</li>

"How can I minimize warp due to wood movement when gluing up a panel?","<p>I recently built a small 2' x 3' dresser top out of pine. It was within 1/8"" flat and level when I glued it up in the garage, but within a few weeks inside it had warped and buckled significantly. <strong>What techniques can I use to minimize the chance of this happening in
   my next project?</strong></p>

<p>Details on the project:</p>

<ul>
<li>I planed several 2x4's down to 6/4 (1.25"") thickness, and jointed
them with my router and a straight edge.</li>
<li>I checked the moisture content at the beginning of the project, and all the boards seemed to be a consistent 12% throughout. I even measured the middle with my pin contact moisture meter when I crosscut the boards to the 3' lengths.</li>
<li>I had a business trip partway through the project, and had to leave the unfinished table top sitting in the garage for two weeks. It was completely assembled/glued, but hadn't had stain or poly applied yet. When I got back, the warp had already occurred.</li>
<li>I alternated grain orientation on most boards, but I mistakenly put two next to each other with the convex side of the rings facing upwards. The warp is worst here, but there's still a bit of a wave on other parts of the dresser top.</li>
</ul>

<p>My thoughts for warp mitigation, and why I haven't tried them yet:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use narrower boards? (Not much of an option, since I was working with 2x4's to start with.)</li>
<li>Use hardwood? (I'm still a bit of an amateur, and I'd like to perfect my techniques with $10 worth of lumber, rather than wasting money on more expensive stock.)</li>
<li>Use quarter sawn boards? (See above reason.)</li>
</ul>

<p>So what am I missing? Which, if any, of the above options would be most effective to try first? Are there other techniques I can use to mitigate warp in my future panel glue ups?</p>

"How to extend a routed rabbet to the inside corners of a cabinet door or other frame?","<p>I fixed up a cabinet in my bathroom, and made a bunch of cabinet doors for it. One of the cabinet doors, I made to have a frosted glass insert with some towels behind it. I used a router with a rabbeting bit with a bearing to create the rabbet to hold the glass in the frame. However, since the bit is round, it was unable to get tight into the corners. I then used a chisel to finish off the corners.</p>

<p>However, the result of the corners was not anywhere as close to as good a cut as the routed section. When I look at the doors in my kitchen with glass windows, professionally made, the cut is perfect including the corners.</p>

<p>Is there a particular technique that is better for making the glass doors? Should I have routed the rabbets prior to gluing up the pieces? Or do I just need to get better at chiseling?</p>

<p>I'm not sure how I could have assembled it different, as I would still have corners prior to assembly:

"How do I identify the appropriate size fastener for my application?","<p>I often find myself guessing based on what I have on hand. Are there some objective guidelines for how to select the proper size? I'm usually thinking about three attributes:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Length</strong></p>

<p>Length is probably the easier dimension to eyeball, but I imagine there is some logic there I could be applying to be more consistent.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Diameter</strong></p>

<p>Diameter is more difficult. Generally the gripping strength is best achieved by increasing the depth of the hole (+ fastener length), meaning a long skinny screw will hold tighter than a fatty short one (provided we don't go to the extremes). My best guess is to use thicker screws when shear resilience is needed, where the weight of the workpiece or the way in which it is to be used will result in lateral force against the screws. But again, I always make my best guess.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Thread Pitch/Depth</strong></p>

<p>This one is easy at a high level. Harder woods need a narrower thread pitch, softer woods need a wider thread pitch (and deeper threads). Usually I only have two choices (sometimes fewer), but perhaps every type of wood has its ideal thread profile.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>But really this all boils down to guestimation, which I already do. What about more objective metrics I could put on a cheat sheet somewhere in my shop (or better yet, something I could remember)?</p>

"Router bit speed as a function of wood hardness","<p>I understand why larger router bits should be operated at lower speeds and there are a multitude of router bit speed charts out there to help you choose the correct speed for any given bit.</p>

<p>It all revolves around (haha, see what I did there?) the rim speed of the bit and, from what I've been able to work out, it looks like most recommended rotational speeds equate to a rim speed of something between 100 km/h (60 mph) and 180 km/h (110 mph).</p>

<p>But then every article you read about this will state that the size of the bit is only one of the factors to determine the speed at which you want to run the router. Another important factor is the hardness of the wood. But, while every article gives you a chart to illustrate how bit size affects the speed, I have yet to see something illustrating how hardness of the wood affects the speed.</p>

<p>Yes, I get it, harder wood = slower speed, but how much? If the bit size speed chart tells me that the max speed for a bit is 20,000 RPM for instance, I'm presuming that is if you're cutting a soft pine. But if you're cutting African Blackwood or Ipe, you should use a slower speed but how much slower?</p>

"How do I avoid 'orange peel' when rubbing out acrylic lacquer?","<p>I'm relatively new to woodworking.  I just finished some desktops made from Eastern White Pine, and coated with 5-7 coats of post-catalyzed acrylic lacquer (Target Coatings EM-6000 + CL-1000) sprayed from a cheap HVLP sprayer.  After a week of cure time I used a series of Mirka Abralon silicon carbide Sanding Pads (grits 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000) soaked in soapy water, 3-4 slow passes over the entire top.  Then finished with Menzerna SF3500 using a foam finishing pad.  The resultant finish has a very nice glossy shine, but it also looks very <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_peel_(effect)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">orange peel</a>.</p>

<p>After seeing this on my first project, I thought that this just meant that I needed to be more aggressive with my initial sanding.  So on my second desk I started with a 500 grit sanding pad before moving to the 1000, and I took a little more time than I did with the others.  I was surprised to see that the second project looked as orangy, if not more so, than the first.  Leaving me to wonder what's causing this and what step I'm missing in my finishing process.</p>

<p>I've never read of anyone needing to go rougher than 500 grit when rubbing out lacquer.  What's the proper way to deal with this?  Why (physically) does this happen?  Do I just need to take a lot more time with the 500 grit?  Too much water and/or soap?</p>

<p>My goal is to create a glasslike mirror gloss, like you see on a high-end car paint job or a guitar.</p>

"What's a reliable measure of wood hardness?","<p>The terms <em>hardwood</em> and <em>softwood</em> are often used, but I struggle to find a reliable definition.</p>

<p>Is the wood's density sufficient as the distinguishing feature?</p>

<p>Is it the only one?</p>

<p>As oil is known to harden a wooden surface, is it possible to create a (in terms of density) hardwood-like surface on a piece of softwood? Is it even possible to get softwood that's harder than (relatively soft) hardwood this way?</p>

<h2>Crucial edit</h2>

<p>When I asked for hardwood and softwood, I had the German terms âHartholzâ and âWeichholzâ in mind. It turns out they do not translate one-to-one: In English, according to Wikipedia and ON5MF's answer, the distinction is made by the type of tree from which the wood is harvested. That corresponds to the German terms âLaubholzâ (wood from dicot angiosperm trees, = hardwood) and âNadelholzâ (wood from gymnosperm trees, = softwood). The differentiation in âHartholzâ and âWeichholzâ differs from that in a way that it takes the wood's âhardnessâ as the distinguishing feature, and I wondered how exactly this is measured and defined. So, additional question: Is there a similar differentiation in English?</p>

"Voids, epoxy and staining compatibility","<p><strong>TL;DR: How do I fix this, and have it match the final color?</strong></p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/brrcJ.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/brrcJ.jpg"" alt=""Void in wood""></a></p>

<p>I'm getting ready to join some 10.5""-wide red oak for a table top, and one of the boards has a void on an edge, right in the middle (length-wise). It's a gorgeous piece otherwise, and I have a limited supply of these. </p>

<p>I saw a Wood Whisperer (love that guy!) video where he used a tinted epoxy to fill in a knot. That seems like a reasonable approach, but I'm not sure how that's going to work with the final stain / treatment that my wife insists on using. (It's some sort of tea-based mixture that gives a gray-ish weathered appearance. She's used it on some other pieces and it looks ok.)</p>

<p><strong>So, the question!</strong></p>

<p>Obviously, I can't stain epoxy. </p>

<ul>
<li>Should I look for another way to fill the void?</li>
<li>Should I remove the knot and patch the wood? It's a very irregular shape (duh), not too sure how that would work.</li>
<li>How else can I stabilize this section? It's fine if I still see the knot after it's done, but I don't want a piece that's going to crumble or otherwise disintegrate over time.</li>
</ul>

<p>Suggestions? Someone else said to replace the knotty section with a bowtie, but I'm not a huge fan of those. I'd love something that would match the grain. But, since this is on the outside edge of the table, I don't see how I could do that and have it either not obvious, or not ugly.</p>

Where I live we have relatively high humidity and temperatures from -40Â°C to +40Â°C. I more or less finished building my shed that I am going to use for my woodworking. I <em>really</em> want to make myself a woodworking bench that can live there.</p>

<p>My uncle is also a woodworker. He was given a nice finished workbench from a friend and he put it in his outdoor workshop which is not temperature controlled. We live near each other so the seasonal temperatures as virtually the same for us. Once a year had passed the bench was pulling itself apart, the ends of bench showed the most warping. From what I can tell it was laminated properly. It makes me wonder though....</p>

"Stanley Bailey frog adjustment problem","<p>I recently bought a vintage Stanley Bailey No. 4 (Type 19 I think, I am new these tools) and after lapping sole and frog surface and putting it back together I found that the iron is skewed and I have to put the lateral adjustment lever almost completely to the right to get even shavings.</p>

<p>Whatever I try to align the frog, either the iron is skewed vertically or not perpendicular to the throat. From the top it looks fine:</p>

"Wide breadboard tenon length?","<p>I'm getting ready to attach breadboard ends to my table top. The top and ends are cut from 9.5"" x 1.5"" red oak. Purely for aesthetic reasons, the breadboards will also be 9.5"" wide (or deep, rather).</p>

<p>I've thought about either M&amp;T, or a continuous tenon with a single long mortise in the ends, with dowels through the bottom (draw bore with elongated slots in the tongue / tenon / whatever you want to call it in this case.)</p>

"In what cases is it useful to have more than one of the same tool?","<p><em>For the purposes of this question, please note that I am not asking for general advice on buying tools, but rather, I'm trying to identify the cases in which it may be practical and useful to have two or more of the same tool. One reason is to help new woodworkers avoid paralysis by analysis--it doesn't make sense to spend a significant amount of time agonizing over the purchase of some tools since you'll most likely want to keep at least two of the same tool in service at the same time anyway, for convenience or some other purpose.</em></p>

<p>The conventional wisdom when it comes to buying tools is that you should buy your last tool first, because you'll save a lot of money over endlessly upgrading. For example, many people start out with a cheap jobsite table saw and upgrade several times, finally ending up with a cabinet saw, when they could have just bought the cabinet saw from the start and saved a lot of money and frustration over time.</p>

<p>On the flip-side, it's far too easy to overanalyze a tool purchase. When I started building my tool collection, I spent an enormous amount of time agonizing over which tools to buy. For example, I could have just bought a set of chisels for $10, or a nicer set for $60, or really nice chisels for $60+ apiece. I agonized over it for weeks before buying two nice chisels, but it wasn't until after I was given a cheaper set of chisels that I started actually using my chisels. In hindsight, I should have just bought the cheap chisels and upgraded as needed, because in the case of chisels it's good to have a nicer set for finer work and a cheaper set for ""banging around""--scraping glue, working reclaimed wood with embedded dirt and grit, etc.</p>

<p>In what cases is it useful to have more than one of the same tool (even, perhaps, the same <em>exact</em> tool), and why? And, on a related note, when is it advantageous to buy a cheap tool first and later buy a second (or third, or fourth...), possibly better, tool of the same type without rendering the first tool worthless?</p>

<p>My ideas so far:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Use a router to create one or two grooves almost the entire length of the table (making sure that the groove is in only one piece of wood), then insert a ""spline"" along that length that will be 4/4 stock; basically a long mortise and tenon to attach an apron in the middle of the table.  I figure if I glue this in, it will strengthen the table length-wise and not cause problem due to wood movement because the groove will run with the grain.  I would probably do this several times because I don't want the ""apron"" to stick out from the bottom too much, so it would not be super thick</p></li>
<li><p>Do the same grooves but instead epoxy in metal splines</p></li>
<li><p>Don't do anything to strengthen it lengthwise, because 8/4 cherry over that length may just be strong enough?</p></li>
<li><p>Attach wood strips across the grain using cleats to strengthen table across the width</p></li>

"How can I reduce the gloss of a varnished piece of furniture?","<p>I have a piece of furniture with a glossy varnish finish. I like the existing color and grain pattern, but I would prefer it to be a matte finish.</p>

<p>How can I accomplish this?</p>

"What is the minimum thickness of plywood needed to support an adult on a 38"" span?","<p>I have in the past dispensed with a box spring and used 1/2"" plywood to almost completely cover the mattress base. The advantage is that the mattress has uniform support and never shows the dents from the slats.</p>

<p>The main disadvantage is that 1/2"" is rather heavy for taking off on a weekly basis to vacuum under the bed.</p>

<p>Would I get away with 3/8"", or even with 1/4"", plywood? My hunch is that 1/4"" is plenty of thickness to support an average-weight (150-200 lb.) adult. But it has to also support the weight of the adult standing, for otherwise a simple exercise like changing the ceiling lamps would crack the base.</p>

<p>Rephrasing and summarizing: what is the fir/spruce plywood thickness needed to support an individual on a span of 38"" (half the span of a King-sized bed)?</p>

"Wood Finishing - Beginner","<p>This is my first time doing woodwork, and after tons of research online, here's what I've understand, but I'll still need a little bit of help. What I'm building is a small shelf to be put on top of my desk to organize things up.</p>

<p>So from what I understand, this is the process of finishing wood (excluding the sanding part). Stain, then apply finish. And the finish that I can choose from are shellac, polyurethane, lacquer and varnish. Now I'm confused on which to use as a beginner in woodworking. I've seen those wood clear coat paint in my local hardware store, does it work the same way as other finishes?</p>

<p>Oh and also from many furnitures I've seen before, there's ugly brush strokes on the finishes, is there anyway I can prevent it and have a smooth finish?</p>

"If I mill / surface my own wood, will it warp as bad as pre-milled / surfaced wood from the store?","<p>Wood bought from the local home center does usually not have straight edges (usually kinked), and is often warped (bowing being most prevalent). I was surprised to see that at my local hardwood dealer, too (they sell pre-milled 1x and 2x boards). </p>

<p>The selection at the hardwood dealer was much better, with the warping much less pronounced, but it got me thinking. If the hardwood dealer can't get straight, flat boards with their presumably bigger and better machines, how flat and straight can I get them at home with a smaller jointer and planer? How long can I expect them to stay that way? Are some wood species more apt to warp than others (I was looking at poplar)?</p>

"When sharpening, how do I assess what grit to start on?","<p>My question is about sharpening edge tools such as plane irons or chisels.</p>

<p>How do I establish, when looking at a tool, what grit to start the sharpening process on?   It's clearly always possible to start on a very coarse grit and work my way up to fine grits and stropping, but in some cases some of that work at the coarser end is unnecessary.   How do I figure out when it's OK (and a time saver) to start at, say, 400 grit or 1000 grit?</p>

"Leaving counterbore holes unfinished on exterior projects","<p>I hope this is clear. So part of an outdoor project I'm working on has a thing like this:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/AlETz.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/AlETz.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<ul>
<li>Those are all 2x4's.</li>
<li>The vertical piece on the left is joined with pocket holes, not shown, not relevant.</li>
<li>The blue/gray areas are 3/8"" diameter counterbore holes, about 1.75"" depth.</li>
<li>The red things are epoxy coated deck screws.</li>
<li>All faces including the ends are finished.</li>
<li>The very bottom piece is pressure-treated fir, finished with exterior grade primer + latex paint.</li>
<li>The other two pieces (the vertical and the piece with the holes) are untreated fir, finished with oil-based stain + exterior grade spar urethane.</li>
<li>The holes face up; water could theoretically sit in them.</li>
<li>All the pieces shown in the diagram are flush and you're looking at the wide faces of the 2x4's; there's no secret depth component to that drawing aside from the holes being drilled on the centerline of the wood.</li>
</ul>

<p>My problem is this: I did drill the counterbore holes before finishing, but I didn't really get any urethane down into the holes. I put the whole thing together, then it rained, then it occurred to me that rain can get into the counterbore holes, where it comes into contact with raw wood. I observed that the water beaded up just fine on the finished surfaces, but soaked into the wood in the holes.</p>

<p>Now, my questions are:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Do I really need to seal up these holes? As in, do I really <em>need</em> to? Of course we don't want water soaking into the wood but given the relative size of the hole, and the fact that it doesn't rain <em>constantly</em> (i.e. there's time to dry, except in the winter if snow piles on), will I truly regret not finishing the holes?</p></li>
<li><p>For hole B, it's pretty easy to do regardless. I could fill it with putty, sanding the finish off the top a bit for the putty to bind, then refinish that area. So regardless of question #1 I'll probably still do hole B.</p></li>
<li><p>For hole A, this is actually the one I'm more concerned about. There doesn't appear to be a gap between the vertical piece and the horizontal but I wouldn't trust it to be water tight. The problem is I <em>really don't want to disassemble that corner to fill in the hole</em>, so: Could it still be a problem? Is there another way to seal that up?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The way I figure is, even if water gets in there, it's such a small surface area that it will eventually even out through the surrounding wood and ultimately dry back out through the hole.</p>

<p>For deep counterbore holes on exterior projects exposed to rain, is the effect of not finishing the inside of the hole negligible in the long run? If not, what will happen? What can I expect to see in a few years?</p>

"Top coat poly makes other sides rough","<p>We're restoring some old furniture - sofas with a lot of carving, whole wood book shelves, et al. We've stripped the old varnish and are redoing the job with poly. We did 2 coats of PU sealer and 2 coats of PU Matt, all with a spray gun. Most of the wood's teak stained with walnut, some of it is rose wood, so we're getting a nice dark brown.</p>

<p>For some reason, when spraying the top coat say onto one side of say the sofa's arms / legs or a shelf's side, the other finished sides pick up rough grey patches. The contractor reckons it's air from the spray gun that's causing that and says it's inevitable when using matt PU. We'll be trying again by covering the finished sides with paper and painter's tape, but we can't do this with the sofa's arms / legs as easily.</p>

<p>We also tried wet sanding with 1500 sandpaper - which removed the roughness, but left the grey patches - followed with 3m finesse it paste wax; it's too shiny for our liking and it raises the wood's grain, the grey patches / new scratches are now visible.</p>

My question is about board thickness.  I already plan to laminate for the posts, but Iâm thinking of the side rails.

"Submerge wood in a barrel to improve it - Is my wife right that this is a bad idea?","<p>I was about to submerge fresh pieces of wood of various types in our barrel filled with water - to let the saps come out and after some time get good wood. These pieces will be used for small objects, kitchen utensils, carvings etc. And some outdoors elements that to become durable against rain.</p>

<p>But then my wife told me not to do it, because this should be done in a stream of water. Like the lumbermill nearby, they have their logs lying in their water stream for a few years and it becomes very good wood. My wife says that if I do it in our barrel, the barrel will be full of the wood saps soon and when the water isn't refreshed this will attract things like bugs and rot, etc. It sounds sensible but neither of us is an expert on soaking wood, I never did it before. Where I live (The Netherlands) This was a common practice throughout the ages but nowadays it is done rarely, which is why it's hard for me to find resources on it.</p>

<p>For instance I couldn't find any info on a second question I have;
I remember once hearing that the best watered wood is the oak that was lying on the deepest bottom of the lakes. I remember the reason for that was that the deepest parts of the water have the least amount of oxygen in it, so the watering process takes place anaerobically. This makes the best quality wood, better than watering in undeep water.</p>

<p>So I was wondering: perhaps if I close the lid of the barrel airtight, the process will be anaerobic aswell? And produce better wood?
I'm hoping to find some people here who have experience with soaking wood to answer my questions. I also find very little information resources online, especially in English. I don't seem to find the official phrase for this in English (in dutch it's called ""gewaterd hout"" but when I search in English I can only wood people who soak their wood for the BBQ grill...)</p>

<p>So these are my questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is it a good idea to use a barrel to soak wood?</li>
<li>If so, is it a good idea to close the lid?</li>
<li>And how much should the water/wood ratio at least be?</li>
<li>Should I refresh the water once in a while?</li>

"Vacuum pre-filter for large objects","<p>My vacuum setup currently consists of a 5hp shop vac (orange) with 2.5â hoses, a hepa filter, a cyclone pre-filter (dust deputy), and automatic power. </p>

<p>It works very well except the hose often clogs with large objects, particularly long thin slivers of material from the table saw or the occasional bit of masking tape. The problem points seem to be the joint with the cyclone filter and the outlet from the table saw, as well as inside the cyclone itself (when a very long object greater than the diameter of the filter tries to enter and hits the opposite wall). Once an object gets stuck, smaller things tend to get hung up on it until it becomes clogged enough for me to notice.</p>

<p>Is there a solution to this? I donât mind things getting hung up on the tool sides but the cyclone joint is kind of a pain. Is there some additional type of pre-filter system that can drop out extremely large objects that make it through the hose before they reach the cyclone, or some other solution? I canât really increase my hose diameter; I donât have the budget or the space for it and the majority of my tools (and the cyclone) are 2.5â or smaller anyways.</p>

"Rule of thumb for Power Tool Durability","<p>We all know the basic rule: If you use a tool rarely, buy a homeworker quality power tool or a cheap one. If you use a tool often, buy a pro or semi-professional power tool.</p>

<p>Allow me to summarize some european brands into four categories:</p>

<ul>
<li>Cheap stuff: Lux Tools, Okay Power</li>
<li>Homeworker Quality: Bosch green, Einhell red</li>
<li>Semi-pro: Makita, Metabo, Bosch blue (The cheaper ones)</li>
<li>Pro: Makita, Metabo, Bosch blue, DeWalt, Hilti</li>
</ul>

<p>Personally I buy drills and stationary tools from the semi-pro category and tools for particular tasks that stay in the shelf most of the time (Belt Sanders, Handplaner, Plunge Router) are of homeworker quality (mostly Einhell). But that is just my personal opinion. I'm looking for numbers.</p>

<p>I've had these never ending discussions with my boss long time ago what would be more beneficial: Buying 10 Einhell red drills or 3 Makita drills for the same price.</p>

<p>Having more drills is great. One breaks? Theres a box over there filled with drills, get a new one. More people join to work? No problem, we have enough drills. The downsides would be more frequent visits to the store to fix or buy new drills and of course transportation and storage of a large number of power tools.</p>

<p>We've had a situation where were we required over a thousand screws for the floor of a terrace and we only had three screw drivers. One guy was drilling the holes, the other two were busy with the screws and the rest were just standing around pretending to be doing something intelligent.</p>

<p>I want to roughly narrow it down to how long each of the categories mentioned above will last. Hours (for any tool), charges (for battery tools), Number of screws (drills)... the variables don't really matter. As the title says I'm looking for a general rule of thumb if possible for all power tools. Also for large stationary tools: If your bandsaw dies and you don't have a big car you've got a problem.</p>

<p>Here is a rule of thumb I got from reading some different articles but I doubt the credibility of these numbers:</p>

<ul>
<li>Cheap tools: 5 hours average operation time until failure</li>
<li>Homeworker tools: 50 hours</li>
<li>Semi-Pro tools: Somewhere inbetween I guess</li>
<li>Pro tools: 1000 hours+</li>

"Sealing and reinforcing particle board","<p>I am making some picture frames from an old table. The table top is oak slats on top of particle board. Iâve sliced the table and trimmed the slices with walnut, and cut rabbets in the frames. Like this:</p>

<p>Prior to adding the trim, the slices are <em>extremely</em> fragile, as the oak slats are held in place only by a few nails (most now cut off) and some drops of very old glue. I dropped one 2 feet and it split into three pieces; they canât support their own weight if held by one end. The trim, however, takes care of this.</p>

<p>So the cross sections are:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/dkBlR.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/dkBlRm.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Now, I need to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Strengthen the particle board so it doesnât chip easily.</li>
<li>Seal it so it doesnât expand and crumble so much in humidity or if it happens to get damp.</li>
<li>Surface B needs to be able to hold the adhesive from gum tape, for mounting the contents of the frame. This means it needs to be a bit smoother (the rough surface of ldf doesnât provide much contact area), not fall apart when wet (gum tape is water activated), and not be weaker than the tape itself (tape does no good if it rips the surface itself off).</li>
</ul>

<p>I can only really do stuff to surface A and B. </p>

<p>How can I seal, strengthen, and prep the particle board surfaces?</p>

<p>Shellac seems to make it less crumbly but isnât good enough. Polyurethane soaks right in and doesnât leave the surface smooth, although I suppose I could do tons of thick coats until it has a resin-filled appearance but that will take a long time and could get messy. The other thought I had was to just smear a thick layer of wood glue all over it, let it dry, and sand/route it flat. </p>

<p>I donât really want to trim the back if I donât have to because I donât want the frame to be thicker and also surface A would be difficult to cover.</p>

<p>What can I do?</p>

"Evening reflectivity of a finish after ""finishing the finish""","<p>I recently installed butcher block countertops in my kitchen. Several weeks ago, I put four coats of varnish on them, but (as always) they ended up with dust nibs. So yesterday, I wet sanded with 400 grit sandpaper (using mineral oil and water as a lubricant). That made the surface very smooth to the touch, but left an uneven sheen across the surface because the dust nibbed areas (i.e., the high points) were matte while the crevices were satin (the luster I chose for the finish). Normally, one would keep sanding until the sheen is even, but I figured I'd just add a top layer of finish thinned with mineral spirits (i.e., a wiping varnish). Theoretically, applying another layer of satin finish <em>should</em> make the sheen even.</p>

<p>Alas, it did not. Look at the picture below. Why has my top coat not evened out the finish? How can I even out the sheen?</p>

<p>A couple things I have considered.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Bump up the sheen to semi-gloss. The top coat was a different brand of varnish, so maybe the undercoat (the un-dust-nibbed part) was more shiny than the top (thinned) coat, which could cause this diversity of sheen. </p></li>
<li><p>Bump <em>down</em> the sheen to matte. Maybe dampening everything to the dust-nibbed sheen is the best way to go (for the opposite reasons stated in #1). </p></li>
<li><p>Keep adding coats. This is, after all, thinned varnish I'm applying. Maybe it will take several more coats to even the sheen. </p></li>
<li><p>Live with it :(</p></li>
</ol>

"Ridgid palm router microadjustment drift","<p>I had to surface some boards, and Woodworld is having classes this week so they can't get to it.</p>

<p>This seemed like a good opportunity to use some parts I had from a CNC build a few years ago, so I made an incredibly over-engineered router sled:</p>

<p>Which works amazingly well, except for when the microadjustment on the (Ridgid) palm router randomly drifts due to the vibration in the whole assembly when the router is running.</p>

<p>I can put some tape over the dial to (maybe) keep it from moving, but is there a better approach I'm missing here? Other than get a better router? (I have a PC 2 1/2 HP, but it seemed a little heavy for this, and I'd rather not have it semi-permanently anchored to the assembly.)</p>

"Uniform oak dying: attenuate the grain","<p>I am replacing a small section of oak flooring (I believe it's European oak) and am at the stage of colour matching.</p>

<p>The term natural edge seems to be applied to the very bumpy organic shape of the edge, which is different from live edge which refers to the slab going up to the bark or cambium layer.  I always assumed these went together, but now that I'm looking to give something like this a try and have been looking at live edge wood slabs to purchase, I've noticed that the edge seems relatively flat under the bark; or at least it doesn't have nearly as much variation as show in the photos.  Especially once the bark is peeled off with a draw knife.  Though I've only really looked at a few species of local trees.</p>

<p>Is there term live edge actually referencing a natural feature that some woods have?  Or is it a term that actually refers to an artificially chiseled edge made to look organic?  How does one create a table with a natural edge like this?</p>

"Hitachi electric miter saw leaves a strange, slightly undulating non-square edge","<p>I own a Hitachi C10FCE2 10-inch miter saw, it is my first miter saw. I'm a woodworking beginner but learning fast. I recently installed a ""Makita A-93681 10-Inch 80 Tooth Micro Polished Mitersaw Blade"" to replace the pretty crappy blade it came with.</p>

<p>I just noticed today while cutting some 3/4"" cherry for a box that the miter saw isn't cutting a flat edge, even though the edge seems to be square. I've calibrated all of my tools to an obsessive degree. I have several accurate engineer's squares, double squares and combo squares that all agree with each other, and they (plus a digital angle gauge) all agree that the miter saw blade is perfectly perpendicular to the back fence and the floor. I didn't really expect a discrepancy, so I hadn't been meticulously checking the resulting wood. Thus, I don't actually know whether this problem has always been here, or if it appeared some time down the line. I only bought it a few months ago, and the blade just a few weeks ago.</p>

<p>The ""problem"" I speak of is not that the cuts are off square in the traditional sense. A try square doesn't show significant deviation from square. However, when I place the two halves of a fresh-cut bit of wood together, they don't line up smoothly along the entire surface. There's sort of a gap there that is most prominent on one side. There's also some blade marks that are deeper than they should be, so much so that I can feel some parts of the end grain are a few thous higher than others.</p>

<p>I switched to my crosscut sled after noticing the problem and my ends are nice and square and flat again. Does anyone know what this is, if it can be fixed or if I need to dump the saw and/or the blade? Is it my technique, machine setup/calibration, a hardware fault or something else like I messed up installing the blade? If the blade is the culprit, I might still be in the return window for Amazon. If I had a shooting board I'd probably just clean up my ends, but until then I depend on a clean cut right off the saw.</p>

<p>FYI, all parts of the saw are tight with no play/wiggle where there shouldn't be. My technique is to push the wood against the back fence and down on the widest part of the saw bed, clamp the wood down, spin the saw up to speed, slowly drop the saw through the wood while applying light pressure down and back to keep it square, stop when it reaches bottom, wait for it to stop, then lift it.</p>

<p>I took some pictures of the gap and also the end grain, though the saw marks probably don't even show up in the pics.

<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/rgeGH.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/rgeGH.jpg"" alt=""router""></a>
Before I proceed with cutting the rabbet, should I fix the twist in the frame? I have identified several options, but as I have never dealt a work piece that is this far out of square, I am not sure what to do.</p>

<p>My options:</p>

<ol>
<li>Do nothing, force the mirror to flex to adapt to the twisted frame.</li>
<li>Use a router and jointing plane to remove material until the winding stick are parallel.</li>
<li>Cut the rabbet deeper in the corners that are twisted up to accommodate the mirror.</li>
</ol>

<p>What is the best option, is there an option that I have overlooked?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>

<p>I decided to proceed with this twisted work-piece. The next step was to cut a rabbet for the mirror to sit in. After cutting this rabbet, the frame was noticeably less twisted. Lots of material was removed, apparently some internal stresses in the wood were twisting the frame:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/rU0ea.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/rU0ea.jpg"" alt=""rabbet in frame""></a></p>

<p>After cutting the rabbet, I gave the mirror a test fit. It looked pretty good. The mirror weights around 40 lbs, and after test fitting the mirror, I decided that the frame needed a brace. When gluing the brace, I warped the frame a little past level:</p>

"Efficient paint removal from rough sawn wood","<p>I have some rough sawn timbers in my house that were painted over by the previous owner of the house<sup>1</sup>.  I believe the timbers are a softer wood like fir as they are more decorative than structural.</p>

<p>I have tried using some citrus based paint remover.  It's worked okay, but has left an orange tint on the test areas.  I'm hesitant to use a chemical based paint remover because of the fumes and the timbers are located inside.</p>

<p>I have also considered grinding via wire brush; sanding with a belt or orbital sander; and planing it with a hand plane.  All of these seem like time intensive operations and I'm a little worried about the mess from grinding or sanding.</p>

<p><strong>What's the most effective way to remove the paint from these timbers?</strong><br>
Or is it a lost cause and I should cover over them instead?</p>

"How do you prevent a turned workpiece from exploding while you're working on it on the lathe?","<p>I've seen some scary videos and ""after"" photos where someone was turning something on a lathe and the workpiece just exploded. How do I avoid this?</p>

<p>For example, in one <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hp4G0slGBKQ&amp;t=297"" rel=""nofollow"">exploding bowl video</a> the turner comments that he made the bottom too thin which makes sense but he doesn't go into any detail about how thick it should have been. Is there a quick-and-dirty rule for estimating how thick the bottom and/or sides should be? He also mentions the wood was a little wet but I'm not sure if he's suggesting that was also part of the cause.</p>

<p>Is it common for things to explode on the lathe, and is it more due to operator error or just an understood hazard of turning wood?  If I can't do anything to completely prevent it, what rules of thumb can I follow to at least decrease the chances of my workpiece exploding on the lathe?</p>

"Recycling ""pre-loved"" lumber -- techniques?","<p>(This may be multiple related questions;  assistance in breaking it up would be welcome if so.)</p>

<p>Many woodworkers have learned that a surprising amount of lumber, including some surprisingly good/interesting material, can be had cheap or free by deconstructing unwanted furniture and  shipping pallets, rescuing it from house renovations, and the like. What are the best ways to prep this for reuse? What unusual sources are there? (I know some folks have gotten expensive woods cheap by spotting something on eBay worth more as wood than as constructed object.)  What's the line between ""worth repairing"" and ""worth scavenging"" and ""not worth the effort""?</p>

<p>I can start with a few observations/questions:</p>

<p>Obviously, going over it with a small metal detector to make sure there are no fasteners remaining to damage your tools is a good starting point. Lead paint is an obvious hazard to watch out for, as are termites. Pressure treatment can be a health risk. What else needs to be avoided?</p>

"Joining an irregular, detachable modesty panel together and to an irregular shaped desk","<p>I've built an irregularly-shaped desk with irregular, five-sided cabinets. It now needs a modesty panel, but because of the unique angles and circumstances, I'm stumped as to how to attach such a panel within the design requirements.</p>

<p><strong>The challenges:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>Because this is fine furniture, there can't be any visible fasteners on the outside of the desk. Fasteners on the inside must be concealed and tasteful. The final piece will be stained, not painted, any patching and filling will show.</p></li>
<li><p>Due to the size of the finished desk, it needs to be able to be disassembled into smaller pieces for moving if necessary. That means that the two cabinets, the top surface and the modesty panel must be able to separate and re-attach in a non-destructive way. (ie. no glue or screws where the wood will wear out and not hold after repeated screwing and unscrewing.)</p></li>
<li><p>The modesty panel needs enough structural integrity to not fall apart when it is separate from the desk.</p></li>
<li><p>There should be some way to attach cables to the modesty panel, like a cable tray.</p></li>
<li><p>The modesty panel has three panels, each joined at very slight (5-11 degree) angles.</p></li>
</ol>

<hr>

<p>Here's a top view with the desk top removed:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/bCUq9.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/bCUq9.png"" alt=""Desk Problem""></a></p>

<p>The three panels of the modesty panel as well as the cabinets are built with 3/4"" birch plywood. The two inner joints can be attached permanently, but the ends that attach to the cabinets have to be detachable.</p>

<p><strong>Questions:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>What type of fastener would be best to join the panels to each other where a <em>permanent</em> connection is needed, keeping in mind that it 3/4 plywood joined end to end, the angles are slight, and no fasteners can be visible?</p></li>
<li><p>What type of fastener would be best to join the panels to the cabinets where a <em>removable</em> connection is needed, keeping in mind that it is 3/4 plywood joined end to face at a slight angle?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>My though is that a cable management tray of some kind might be the solution to add more structural integrity and create more surface area, but I'm still not sure how it would all attach together. Hopefully someone has some clever fastener or joining trick that might work here.</p>

"How is it possible to let wood reach equilibrium moisture content?","<p>I am trying to reconcile the following 3 points but cannot:</p>

<ol>
<li>It is <strong>extremely important</strong> to let wood sit for a while in the environment it is intended to be used in before using it for a project so that it reaches equilibrium moisture content (EMC) with the environment. Evidence: This advice comes up time and time again here, in forums, in articles, everywhere. </li>
<li>It is <strong>impossible</strong> to do so where I live, where the EMC has varied from 2.8% to 29.1% on an almost daily basis over the last 2 years. Evidence: See below.</li>
<li>Building furniture from wood <strong>apparently works anyways</strong>. Evidence: I live in NYC. There are 15 million people here with furniture that isn't constantly tearing itself apart.</li>
</ol>

<p>How can an extremely important requirement for well-built furniture be apparently impossible, yet well-built furniture exists anyways? One of the three points above must be false. It is either:</p>

<ol>
<li>Not  that important, or</li>
<li>Entirely possible, or</li>
<li>Nobody's furniture in NYC lasts longer than a year or two before warping itself to pieces.</li>
</ol>

<p>Which is it? What am I missing here? In such a wildly changing environment, <strong>how is it actually possible to let wood reach its EMC</strong>, or is the advice misguided, and does it not actually matter?</p>

<p>How can I make all this make sense? Evidence suggests that the advice to ""let wood sit for a few weeks or months to reach equilibrium with the environment"" is not actually correct (because it appears impossible - what would the target MC be?), but I have to assume I am missing a key point because of my inexperience.</p>

<p>As the question and answers are evolving I am becoming clearer on what I am confused about: My assumption is <em>not</em> that the wood's MC changes quickly, it's that in the presence of a highly varying environment I question if it changes too slowly to ever really reach EMC, at least in the conventional ""weeks"" or ""months"" suggested resting times. Also I question conventional accepted wisdom regarding season and location (I am gathering more data on these lines as I type this, however). It is given, to me, that live wood has a high MC and needs to be dried; what is really not clear to me after looking at answers and data is if it actually matters that wood rests near its final location, and how much a couple of weeks or months really makes a difference. By all traditional experience, it does, but by the very limited observations I have made so far, it does not seem to.</p>

<p>The major variable that affects the above is Winter/December 2015 had record-breaking high temperatures (72F/22C was not a white Christmas). From this I learn two things:</p>

<ul>
<li>The tighter range of seasonal EMC averages (12.4-13.1%) and medians (10.5-11.9%) suggest a reasonable target EMC. This is good news.</li>
<li>There is no statistically significant difference in my area's relative humidity and EMC per season (or even monthly, really). This leads to other questions outside the scope of the original version of this post.</li>
</ul>

<p>This raises some additional questions for reflection: Most notably 1) is a ""few weeks"" or a ""few months"" really enough time to let wood sit, and 2) that season doesn't matter contradicts some accepted experience, although this may be unique to my location.</p>

"Is there any way to join/seal large exterior mitre joints such as on a bay window sill so that they don't open up?","<p>As per the title, I work at a conservatory manufacturer and as such we often have large bits of hardwood (up to around 56x220mm section) which need to be joined with a mitre, such that the larger face is sitting on brickwork.</p>

<p>Typically we cut the mitres accurately, machine worktop bolts into the undersides and sometimes dowels or biscuits for locating the pieces together correctly on site. We seal the end-grain of the pieces with a purpose-made end-grain sealer, then paint with water-based microporous paint.</p>

<p>Whenever I go out to site to a job which has been installed for ~6 months or more, the sills and any other large mitred joins have typically opened up.

"I calculated the recommended number of clamps required for my table top and the answer seems insane","<p>According to the article in fine woodworking on gluing up joints: </p>

<p>The formula for number of clamps required is (square inches of glued joint x PSI for the wood in question) divided by PSI of the clamp you are using.</p>

<p>I am gluing up a desktop made of 2x2's of different hardwoods (red oak, cherry, walnut, maple and poplar.  According to the article, the required gluing pressure averages about 350 psi, so for my project (6' long joints on 2x2 which are actually 1-13/16 squared) comes to:  </p>

<pre><code>(72"" x 1.81) x 350 = 45,675
divided by ~1000 (pressure exerted by 3/4"" pipe clamp.

That works out to <strong>45</strong> 3/4 inch bar clamps for a 6' length!</p>

"How do I apply Minwax Polyshades Espresso stain over two coats of Polyshades Pecan stain to darken a bit?","<p>I'm trying to apply Minwax Polyshades espresso stain after having applied a coat of Minwax Polyshades pecan to solid pine wood.

<p>Now, I'm trying to darken the wood tone a bit in general but especially along the edges and the knots. It doesn't seem to be working for some reason, and I'm wondering if it's because Minwax Polyshades includes the polyurethane finish and so my third coat of espresso stain is not able to adhere to the wood.</p>

"Pyrography criteria to justify changing tools with different woods?","<p>I have been using a binding-post interchangeable-tip pen (as seen in the third image here <a href=""https://www.razertip.com/pyrography-pens.htm"">https://www.razertip.com/pyrography-pens.htm</a>)  from The RazertipÂ® Wood Burning Systems for over 10 years now with minimal complaints.  </p>

<p>In a discussion with a fellow pyrographer, it came up that their system of choice was a simple soldering iron (never tinned or used for anything other than wood however), and unlike so much of the literature and instructions out there, they claimed with this type of pen, they NEVER have to touch hot pen to wood.  Thus shading in their work is exceptional.  I have enjoyed making my own tips, but the relatively small gauge wire (even the thick gauges feel like they cool in the air so rapidly they can't burn from a distance).  </p>

<p>I am considering out a iron-pen system, like the one shown here (specifically because it has a few interchangeable tips, and I feel this would still be a plus over a soldering iron dedicated for wood burning)  <a href=""http://www.leevalley.com/en/wood/page.aspx?p=31041&amp;cat=1,41115"">http://www.leevalley.com/en/wood/page.aspx?p=31041&amp;cat=1,41115</a> but I am not sure whether it would make shading of heavily grained hard woods any easier...</p>

<p>Long story short, I would like to ask for some advice or brief stories of your experience regarding a few observations and determining whether different equipment would help improve this:</p>

<ol>
<li>With the thin wires of the razertip system, the pen requires contact with the hardwood with smooth deliberate motion (technique and reading of the wood is vital here and requires time, patience, concentration, and focus as if the pen isn't lifted in time the grain can ignite (with a flash) leaving a blob.)  This is common and there is lots of material out there about techniques and better woods to use to avoid this, but I would like to focus on whether an iron-style pen which is not in contact with the wood will make the wood less sensitive to this problem.</li>
<li>I have been told, iron style pens (without touching the wood) generate faster, more even burns to a larger surface area compared to pens with thin wires.  Is this true, or have our discussions not given enough credit to the wood we are using?  Based on photographs of my friends work, I know for sure we aren't likely using comparable woods as there is never a discernible grain on their work.  I tend to burn on a lot of pine, poplar, maple, and red oak.  The grain and changing density/wetness on red oak can be a real pain!, but all the more satisfying with a well done end product.</li>

"What am I doing wrong when making lap joints with my stacked dado set?","<p>I'm trying to cut some lap joints on a table saw using my stacked dado set. But the depth of the cut is inconsistent from pass to pass.</p>

<p>Here's a picture of what I'm getting:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/wKyWR.jpg"" alt=""Lap joint inconsistencies""></p>

<p>It seems like I'm getting somewhere between 1/32"" to 1/16"" variation on each pass; it's difficult to tell for sure because the depth of the cut is potentially variable on each pass.</p>

<p>What could be causing this inconsistency?</p>

<p>Some things I've considered:</p>

<ul>
<li>Perhaps the saw blade is actually oscillating up and down as it makes the cuts. Is this a thing that happens in table saws sometimes? If so, what do I do to fix it?</li>
<li>Maybe the wood is actually riding up over the blade? That doesn't make a lot of sense to me, as that is more like what happens in a climbing cut. I tried several things to get a more consistent joint, including making sure the pressure was as even as I could get it on each pass, and it helped a little but still had a lot of variation between passes.</li>
<li>Maybe the board itself has inconsistencies in height, causing it to engage the cut at different angles? That doesn't make a lot of sense either, because the cuts seem fairly consistent through a single cut. They only seem to vary between cuts. But I did try planing the board before cutting the joint to see if that helped with consistency. It didn't seem to make any difference.</li>
<li>Maybe my expectations are off and this is just what I should expect to get out of a stacked dado set?</li>
</ul>

<p>At the end of the day, I have several questions that are all intertwined:</p>

<ol>
<li>This seems to be a lot more variation than I can use as-is in a lap joint. If I were to glue it up like this, my gut tells me I'd be compromising the strength of the joint. Is this true?</li>
<li>What is causing this problem?</li>
<li>How do I fix it?</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>LeeG suggested that accumulating sawdust might be the problem. I made several changes to my setup, and it seems to have done the trick. I replaced the fence I'd been using with a much straighter board, and I cut a rabbet at its base for dust relief. I made sure to keep the surface of the table saw as free from sawdust as I could between each pass. The changes seem to have worked. The cuts are much more consistent between passes now.</p>

"Drilling a straight, centered hole down square-cross-section bar stock?","<p>I'm trying to drill a centered, straight hole in a piece without a big drill press and a bunch of clamps and brackets, which seems to be the usual way to do it. <strong>I can manage straight, but centered is eluding me</strong>.</p>

<p>I'm very new to working wood and I'm working on an umbrella swift for my partner to wind yarn on. Part of this involves an axle (in this case, simple dowel) and a couple of square-sided blocks that rotate around it. A bit of friction is actively desirable, so this isn't even going to get a sheave bearing, let alone anything fancier.</p>

<p>I'm having a lot of trouble drilling a straight, centered hole down the square stock, and tend to get a hole that's off center and/or not straight.</p>

<p>With a <a href=""http://www.bunnings.com.au/sontax-43mm-collar-drill-guide_p6350091"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">basic drill guide (collar style)</a> I can get it pretty straight, but setting the work piece perfectly perpendicular is tricky since the edges from where it's cut off the bar stock aren't quite square after hand-sawing. (Maybe I should be using a mitre box?). I'm dealing with this by mounting it in a vise and measuring it carefully before tightening.</p>

<p>Getting the hole centered is just not working though. I drill a small pilot hole with a 2-bit, but it still tends to wander half a mil off center once it bites and starts drilling. I suspect it might be because of the soft pine I'm working with and the fact that I'm drilling down the line of the grain, not across it, but I don't have much choice about that. Widening the hole tends to make the situation worse, as the bit again tends to wander before biting properly.</p>

<p>If I go straight to the 12mm spade bit for the full width cut it tends to wander more, rather than less.</p>

<p>I'm also getting a hole that's usually not quite round - slightly distorted on three sides. Is this because I'm drilling with the grain?</p>

<p>Please forgive my ignorance. I've been hunting around for info, but mostly finding things focused on drilling down the center of round stock like dowel, where you can spin the stock in a drill and use a fixed bit. That's not an option here.</p>

<p>It seems to me the roller bearings are the superior choice and would have several advantages:</p>

<ul>
<li>They will rotate as the saw blade moves, keeping the blade cooler, and thus the blade will last longer.</li>
<li>They should not wear as much over time</li>
<li>They should be quieter</li>

"Planning for wood movement in drawers","<p>I'm a big fan on making my own drawers and wooden drawer slides (much cheaper and less mental math than installing hardware, IMO). I tend to use <a href=""http://dhh.howyousign.com/?p=365"" rel=""noreferrer"">this</a> type of construction where the drawer bottom sits (and slides) on runners (see image below). When I first started building these sorts of drawers, I cut the drawers about 1/8 in less than the distance from bottom runner to top runner to ensure that the drawer fit. The problem was that the drawers would tip whenever I opened them. So I began modifying my design to allow a smaller gap. Now I'm at the point where I cut the drawers sides to the exact same size as the drawer opening, then run a handplane past it a couple times to get a tight fit that slides easily. The end result is that my drawers, even when fully extended, open parallel to the floor without tipping (like they used to when I used a 1/8 in gap).</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/9vzTW.jpg"" alt=""Drawer slide construction""> </p>

<p>I've seen other websites recommend this sort of snug-fit construction (can't recall where off the top of my head). But I'm wondering if there will be seasonal movement problems? I just build these drawers in the last few months (I have a garage, aka, COLD workshop). Will I have problems in the summer when wood expands? I know wood expands across the grain, so it seems I <em>should</em> have problems. If I refit the drawers in the summer, won't they then be too loose during the winter? How do I combat these seasonal changes in drawer sizes?</p>

<p><strong>What I have considered...</strong></p>

<p>I have seen jigs where you would screw pieces of wood at opposite ends of the work piece and use wedges to tighten. Given the wood I am using I would have to have stops with shorter wood. Planing the stops is fine, since it is scrap anyway, but I don't how to secure them without damaging the plane (screws would be recessed but with the wood that thin I would expect the plane to break the wood). </p>

<p>For now I have been placing the board on the floor and using a belt sander with my foot as the stop. I am able to do about 80% of a face this way since I don't want sand my feet. What I then do is turn the board ( not flip over ) and finish the other 20% which would not longer be obstructed by my foot. This has lead to inconsistent sanding on occasion. </p>

to maintain the colour. Do I need to do anything different with the sanding because of the stain? Does sanding the stain out damage the wood?</p>

"Table saw blade wobbles, don't think it's the arbor","<p>So I'm never really had great cuts with this saw but never looked into why. Recently I tried to cut some 8/4 and it didn't want to move through the blade so I cleaned the blade, waxed the table and it still burns or binds. It appears the blade is wobbling so I recorded these videos in the hopes I can get some help fixing this issue.</p>

<p>I looked up how to check this on youtube, hopefully I'm doing it right. Using the dial indicator I first checked with nothing on the arbor and it appears to be ok, about 0.001in during the full rotation. I put the blade back on and it jumps up to about 0.011in which seems pretty high. I don't think it's the blade as this is the second blade I tried but I'm not sure what else it could be. Is this runout bad? Is it something else?</p>

"Choice of sanding sealer to avoid blotching (shellac vs cellulose)","<p>I am working on a table that is made out of maple. I would like to apply a stain but maple is a timber that is prone to blotching so am considering using a sanding sealer before staining to reduce the potential for blotching.</p>

<p>In the past I have used shellac as a prelude to wax finishes but I am worried about how it might react with a final finish of varnish or lacquer (i.e. not wax or oil). I understand how shellac works and where it comes from, and although I have heard of cellulose and acrylic sanding sealers I have never used them.</p>

<p>Focussing on cellulose SS, I am guessing that it works like shellac but it is cellulose that is deposited in the wood instead of lac-bug resins. This sounds fine given what wood is made of (and my experience of hardening tissue paper with cellulose thinners as a young lad making model aeroplanes). Is this correct?</p>

<p>I've been led to believe that standard shellac is good under wax or oil based finishes but, if you want to use a varnish or lacquer then you are best using de-waxed shellac. But what about cellulose SS in particular? What is cellulose SS safe under and are there any pros or cons vs shellac?</p>

"Homemade belt sander belts (3X18)","<p>I got the idea of looking to see what it cost to make homemade sandpaper belts for my belt sander would be. For me less than a $1 per belt. Math being about $30 for 20-25 Yards of sandpaper (roll) and $10 for epoxy. Around a good belt is $2.50 and cheap is $1.50 (cheap ones are not to fun...). I have seen a little video on this which is the reason I say epoxy. This person did a 1/2"" over lap after filing the sand and then clued with epoxy. Clamping the epoxy is very flexible but I would not know what epoxy to use. And if epoxy is a good choice. Note: Roll on sanding paper is on a cloth like my current belts. So my questions being,</p>

<p>Q1) What glue would be best (Or Cloth tape?)?</p>

<p>In other areas of woodworking tools I can see why one brand would cost more than another because of quality, manufacturing, and material differences but when it comes to carving tools the only one I see applying is material differences but even then I don't believe that would account for the degree of the price differences.</p>

"What are the minimum, maximum, and optimal depths for dadoes, grooves, and rabbets?","<p>I kind of assume that dadoes, grooves, rabbets / rebates should be no deeper than half the thickness of the material.

<p>And, going the other way, is there a minimum depth of a dado before it's either not adding any strength, or not assisting with alignment? Maybe 1/8"" or 1/16""?</p>

<p>Finally, is there an optimum depth of dadoes? In some of the youtube videos I've seen, it seems that 1/4"" dadoes are fairly common in 3/4"" material.

<blockquote>
  <p>These gradings are part of the European standard BS EN 204 governing the classification of wood glues for non-structural applications.</p>
  
  <p>There are 4 main types of durability grading, running from D1 to D4. The differences between these are listed below:</p>
  
  <p>D1 = Interior areas, where the temperature only occasionally exceeds 50Â°C for a short time and the moisture content of the wood is 15% maximum</p>
  
  <p>D2 = Interior areas, with occasional short term exposure to running or condensed water and/or to occasional high humidity, provided the moisture content of the wood does not exceed 18%</p>
  
  <p>D3 = Interior areas, with frequent short-term exposure to running or condensed water and/or heavy exposure to high humidity. Exterior areas not exposed to weather</p>
  
  <p>D4 = Interior areas with frequent long-term exposure to running or condensed water. Exterior areas exposed to weather</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(BS EN 204 is a British/European standard.)</p>

<p>My question is: For painted exterior joinery (hardwood, with microporous water-based ""breathable"" paint), exposed to weather (windows and doors etc.) would D3 be acceptable, or must D4 classification be used?</p>

<p>I know it says that D4 must be used if exposed to weather, but presumably the paint protects the glue such that it is not directly exposed? On the other hand, the paint is breathable and so technically the glue joints ARE exposed to humidity.</p>

<p>We're also thinking of doing it ourselves as we can't afford to pay a lot for someone to do it for us. I'm not a wood working pro by any means, but I have and am reasonably comfortable with jigsaw, drill, sander, etc.</p>

<p>We've been doing some research and thinking, and I think we have a reasonable design which should be 1) easy to build, 2) low cost, 3) stable enough.</p>

<p>As context, our house is a timber frame building where all internal walls and ceilings are made of plasterboard, so anchoring is out of question, but we do plan to at least secure the frame to the walls.</p>

<p>Without further ado, here are our current sketches:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/FK9kZ.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/FK9kZ.jpg"" alt=""Photo sketch""></a></p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Zm8EE.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Zm8EE.jpg"" alt=""Hand drawn sketch with sizes""></a></p>

<p>So the idea is to have 4 vertical poles in the 4 corners and 4 support beams in a rectangular shape on the top. The rope ladder and climbing net will be suspended from the top beams.</p>

<p>Since I don't think I'd be able to do some proper wood joints, I was searching around and found some three way metal connectors:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/WuSEd.jpg"" alt=""Three way metal connector""></p>

<p>From: <a href=""http://www.allsteelshedframes.com/steeltimberconnectors.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.allsteelshedframes.com/steeltimberconnectors.htm</a></p>

<p>So the idea with these is that the beams would slot in, but the whole frame would be height adjustable as the pole bit has holes on both ends.</p>

<p><strong>My first question would be, how are these called?</strong> I only found this US based site, but I'd like to buy them in the UK.</p>

<p>As for the timber, I was thinking of getting 75mm*75mm poles in 2.4m length, like these for example: <a href=""http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/3-x-3-75mm-Pressure-Treated-Timber-Wooden-Gate-Fence-Post-1-8m-2-4m-6ft-8ft-/151978589963?var=&amp;hash=item2362a13f0b:m:mT27JK_Z9k8n_Z_wD0EmnTg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/3-x-3-75mm-Pressure-Treated-Timber-Wooden-Gate-Fence-Post-1-8m-2-4m-6ft-8ft-/151978589963?var=&amp;hash=item2362a13f0b:m:mT27JK_Z9k8n_Z_wD0EmnTg</a></p>

<p><strong>So the second questions is, would this construction be solid enough to hold a light adult (I'm ~70kg)?</strong></p>

<p>Thanks in advance for any comments / help!</p>

"Winter and my tools","<p>It is getting cold here in Wisconsin, winter is coming. I have always taken in my battery tools. Because most people should know that lithium and freezing temps, do not mix very well. But what about my other corded tools? Do I need to bring those inside. keep in mind, at this time I don't own my own place, only 17, so I am out in the shed, and there is no heat and open building (we have one cow on the other side).

"Coping Saw Angles","<p>Iâm remodeling a couple of rooms and coping the baseboard joints.  For the most itâs going well, especially after getting new blades for the coping saw!  The problem is the fireplace walls are not set at 90 degree angles, they are 122 degrees.  So, if I am going to cope the joint, how I calculate which angle to make the miter cut?  Is it as simple as 61 degrees, half of 122?</p>

<p>After a miter cut is made, what is angle for back cut with coping saw?  For example, a 90 degree corner would be a 45 degree miter and then a back cut of just more than 90 degrees from the face of baseboard.  What would it be for at 122 degrees?</p>

"finish for a very large pine dining table --- is beeswax crazy?","<p>I am an enthusiastic but novice wood worker, and this is my first large project. The table is made of pine boards (and possibly some fir? I've been doing several projects lately and I'm not 100% sure which 2x4s ended up going into this table). I know I want to stain it a deep brown (I have some miniwax dark walnut stain ready to use), but I'm having trouble deciding how to finish it. Here are my concerns:</p>

<ul>
<li>The surface of the table is roughly 8x4 feet, and I'm worried about being able to get an even coat over the whole thing fast enough if I use a relatively quick drying finish like water- or oil-based poly. I've used water-based poly finish with good results before, but on much smaller projects. </li>
<li>I don't have a dedicated work room or garage. Whatever finish I use will be applied right in the dining room of our rather small apartment. I'm concerned about dust getting in the finish since I can't control the space well --- there's a cat and husband in the mix who will be tramping back and forth, scattering debris. :)</li>
<li>Also because I'll be working inside our home, I'm concerned about noxious fumes while it dries. There's a couple warm days coming up in the forecast so I'll be able to open the windows, but still... </li>
</ul>

<p>I've used beeswax mixed with food-grade mineral oil as a sort of finish before and really liked the way it looked. It was for some baby toys I made for a friend of mine, so I wanted a finish that would be safe even while being sucked/chewed/etc. I have a fair amount left over, so I was wondering if it would be crazy to just use that for the table. It would take the time pressure off the application since it doesn't dry like poly finishes, and there's no concern about fumes. </p>

<p>I know wax and oil finishes don't last, so I would need to ""refinish"" the table with it again every year or so, but that doesn't bother me. I've also read that wax and oil don't provide the same level of protection as other kinds of finish, but I'm not exactly sure what that means in terms of consequences for my table --- I made it ""rustic"" looking on purpose so we wouldn't worry about scrapes and such. It will see heavy use. There's a good chance it will have hot dishes placed on it, as well as the inevitable wine and coffee spills, sticky bits of food, etc. Will the reduced ""protection"" afforded by wax and oil mean we can't keep the table clean? </p>

<p><strong>What are the downsides of using a beeswax and oil ""finish"" on a dining table, if I'm not very worried about preventing cosmetic damage, or having to reapply it annually? If you think beeswax and oil would be a bad choice, what other finish would you recommend, given my concerns above?</strong></p>

"Designing and Building a Through-Leg Table","<p>A popular, modern style of table has the legs going through the table top, so that the end grain of the leg is exposed. Of course, the problem with this design immediately becomes the expansion and contraction of the table top, which would push and pull against the legs. An example of this style is the ""Big Sur"" dining table at Crate and Barrel. Other manufacturers make similar looking tables, which is apparently a variation of a ""Parsons table"" design. I've found one other discussion of the style on the web, and people were convinced manufacturers were using cleverly disguised plywood. I have seen the Big Sur table in person, and I can tell you with complete certainty that the tabletop is solid wood. </p>

<p>Looking under the table, there are kerfs approximately 5 inches apart, which I assume are to allow for expansion. The bottom of the tabletop is reinforced with metal brackets screwed into place. I assume this is to strengthen the tabletop due to the weakness introduced by the kerfs. The kerfs do not go all the way through the tabletop, so I assume expansion would still be a problem. Additionally, there is a 1/8"" gap between the table top and the legs, which I assume is there to allow for additional expansion, but would probably also harbor food crumbs.</p>

<p>I have never heard of kerfing the bottom of a tabletop before. Is this a thing? Am I interpreting the design correctly? My wife and I, who rarely agree on anything, both like the aesthetics of the table. I've talked about custom building one but I'm having second thoughts. Is the table stable or is it just a bad design?</p>

"Removing silicone lubricant spray from painted timber finished with water-based paint","<p>I make windows and doors, and a great way to make sure that they open and close smoothly is to use silicone lubricant spray on the rubber weatherseals. While silicone lube is fine to use on painted surfaces, it does affect any repainting - the paint can't adhere to the silicone and causes ""fish-eyes"" or ""pinholes"" in the paint.</p>

<p>We use a water-based, micro-porous exterior paint. I've asked our supplier and they said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>That is a bit tricky, as we donât want to use any solvent chemicals to remove the silicone, as it could remove some of the top coat too. We donât mention any specific product in our maintenance guide, but we do recommend cleaning the surface with soapy (fairy) warm water to remove the environmental debris building up in the joints and on horizontal surfaces. This could partially remove the silicone lube, but it may still leave behind traces which will cause pin holes if recoated. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Does anybody have any good techniques for removing silicone? I'm thinking of telling customers to clean with soapy water, lightly sand and then clean again. Would that do it?</p>

<p>Of course I could stop using silicone spray but the stuff works <strong><em>miracles</em></strong> on sticking doors etc. so ideally I'd find a solution.</p>

<p>I'm also open to suggestions of alternative lubricants I could use which would achieve the same thing (not damaging paintwork or rubbers whilst being effective) but not affect paint and/or be easier to clean off fully.</p>

<p>Edit: Just to be absolutely clear, silicone lube has been sprayed on fully finished joinery (water-based paint), and I want to know how best to clean it off when repainting (which is required every few years as a maintenance operation).</p>

"Lumber size standards outside the US?","<p>America does more ""stick-built"" construction than some countries, since we retained more of our forests longer (old-growth forests are a vanishing breed, but we haven't yet killed off the softwoods). So it's been important for us to have standardized construction-lumber sizes... which are misleadingly land inconsistently labelled but which are still based on inches and feet.</p>

<p>Elsewhere things have gone somewhat differently. For example,  the UK has lost almost all its woodlands, which may be part of the reason folks there are now more likely to build in brick. And they were smart enough to go metric long ago.</p>

<p>Hence my question: <em>are</em> there standard construction-lumber sizes outside the US, and what are they? Or is the US exporting enough pine that our pseudo-2x4's and 4'x8' plywood have become international standards despite the inconvenience?</p>

<p>(I'm explicitly neither assuming there are international standards, nor that there aren't, because I simply don't know. If this starts turning into a complicated/long list, of course it can be pulled to community wiki or wherever... but let's see if there are more than three or so sets of data before assuming that's needed.)</p>

<p><strong><em>EDIT:</em></strong></p>

<p>I guess the question I was really trying to ask was whether the metric universe had standardized a set of common off-the-shelf dimensions across countries that would serve as an equivalent of the American sizes for purposes of plan dimensions -- if an American shed is mostly 2x4's on 16"" centers with 1/4"" 4'x8' sheathing (some of those being real measurements and some nominal), is there a well-accepted set of metric dimensions would replace those elsewhere to build the equivalent shed, and are those subject to the same kind of inconsistency?</p>

<p>An answer of ""almost; there are three such systems battling for dominance and they are..."" or ""not really, everyone has their own set of numbers influenced by their own historical construction practices"" or ""actually, there IS an international standard known as..."" would then qualify as a clearly acceptable answer.</p>

<p>As I say, the real question is whether we can translate something between metric and American in any reasonable way, or if we just have to count on everyone making their own adjustments.</p>

"Smell Longevity of Eastern Red Cedar","<p>I had a question about the longevity of the cedar smell when building with it. We have an armoire at our river cabin, it's 30+ years old and while you don't really smell anything when it's closed, opening it drowns you in a good cedar smell. </p>

<p>I don't know if it's eastern red cedar or not, because it was purchased, but I do have access to a lot of raw eastern red cedar. I want to know how long that smell will last under normal use of indoor items and if there is anything you can do to preserve it or bring it out if it fades.</p>

<p>I think the outside of the armoire is polyurethaned to prevent wear. I think they left the inside untreated so you'd have that smell. While it's 30 years old, it doesn't see normal use. It's bedroom storage for things you don't use very often, but need to keep semi-protected. I'm sure that is the reason it still smells so strongly of cedar. If I were to build a piece from it, leaving some of it raw, how long would you reasonably think the smell would last? I'm sure it fades at some point, but would a light sanding expose more of the ""smelling"" surface? By normal use, I mean something you'd use regularly in your house, such as a dresser, a mens valet, a liquor cabinet, etc... Thanks for the help.</p>

<p>As far as I can tell, with a router, a climbing cut occurs when the cut occurs as the cutting edge of the bit enters the cutting path, whereas the normal way to rout is with the bit doing its work as it leaves the cutting path.</p>

<p>On a table-saw, a climbing cut is when the wood is introduced to the blade as the teeth are coming upward rather than downward as we normally would cut wood.  That is, the wood is introduced from the rear of the saw instead of the front.  Here I am calling the position where the operator normally stands (probably near the on/off switch) the front.</p>

<p>So, basically, it seems that a climbing cut is one that's made backwards. </p>

<p>Does it ever make sense to use a climbing cut on a table-saw?  If so what are the safety precautions that should be followed?</p>

"Do auger bits have advantages?","<p>While not the focus of the question I wanted to point out that when it comes to drill presses I almost always see forstner bits suggested here at WW (for good reason of course).  </p>

<p>Much to my surprise in <a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/a/2039/128"">this answer from Graphus</a> he suggested using auger bits instead. He mentions that depth of cut and price are key factors in choosing auger bits. Albeit a drill press was not the tool he suggested but I was still surprised.</p>

<p>Understandably spade bits would be at the bottom of choice but when it comes to making holes in wood what criteria would make me choose auger bits over something like a forstner? The latter I have come to understand are superior.  Maybe they are but only under certain conditions? </p>

<p>It is possible those are the answers and that maybe forstner bits should only be used in drill presses. If nothing else this can be a place for that answer.  </p>

"Wood expansion vs. steel","<p>I am contemplating a design for a tabletop which would be made up of a series of oak strips, bolted from end to end using long threaded rod. It might be approx 10' (3 m) long. Using several rods, perhaps about 1' (30 cm) apart.</p>

<p>The wood strips would run perpendicular to the long direction of the table.</p>

<p>My concern is that with seasonal expansion &amp; contraction, would this be stable? It would be OK if the top changed size somewhat (like many) but are the steel rods likely to cause cupping or splitting etc.?</p>

"Wood floor movement mechanism","<p>I'd like to understand why wood movement in a floor necessitates large expansion gaps around the outside of the room. I'm not asking why wood as a material undergoes changes due to moisture - I'm interested in how <em>the floor system as a whole</em> actually behaves once installed.</p>

<p>Take for example common wood-strip flooring such as 3/4 oak. Here's a diagram showing a typical recommended installation along a wall parallel to the floorboards:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/sgyHt.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/sgyHt.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p><strong>How is it possible that the entire floor could ever move by approx 3/4"" at the walls without being totally destroyed</strong>? Nails would be torn out, boards split, etc. if the floor moved that much, no? So is the gap really useful?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<hr>

<p>(What I would have thought was: given the way boards like this are nailed, the tongues would remain in place relative to the floor, the grooves would slide around, and the floor <em>as a whole</em> would not move at all. Gaps would just open and close between individual strips.)</p>

"Should I use Full Overlay or Half Overlay hinges?","<p>I want to install two doors on this cabinet using European (concealed) hinges. They will be installed on a Frameless structure made of 18mm panels on the outside and a 27mm panel on the inside that is shared by one door and on the other side by drawers (see diagrams).</p>

<p>I understand that if two doors share the same panel, they use Half Overlay hinges (as per Rocker website). However, in this case, the door will not be sharing the interior panel. On the other side, there are shelves (in this case) and drawers in another case. Furthermore, the interior panel is thicker (27mm vs 18mm) than the exterior panel.</p>

<p>Hi, I'm trying to raise my work desk to use as a standing desk to help with back pain and concentration as cheaply as possible with minimal cutting. I'd like for it to last at least a year. 
Expecting load to be around 60 lbs + occasionally resting an arm on.</p>

<p>In the diagram, the pieces color coded the same are the same in dimension. The vertical white blocks are 3.5 inches in thickness in x-y. The horizontal pieces are 1.5 x 3.5. I'm planning to stick a few nails in the ends. The cyan rectangle on top is the footprint of my desk with wheels removed.</p>

<p>I'm most concerned with lateral movement at the moment. I'll have 2 monitors on top with 1 being my work monitor(lcd tablet) which I really don't need breaking on me due to failure in the base :D </p>

<p>My rational is that the red blocks being directly on top keeps me from having to worry about joints breaking loose from the weight of the set up. The green blocks adding stability going  downward and between the thick blocks in case weight shifts forward and backward(green/red blocks facing forward and backwards). The pink blocks...I'm not too sure of but it seems like it could help with lateral stability by making an overall wider base and dispersing any lateral shift between the 2 thick blocks?? </p>

<p>I don't know what kind of wood it is. Hurricane Michael gifted me with lots of free wood from my destroyed garage. haha I'm pretty sure it's still strong enough for this use though  </p>

<p>Am I on the right track? Thank you</p>

"Arm for heavy TV","<p>I have a TV here which weighs around 15 kg. It fits perfectly into the alcove next to my chimney breast, but that's not a convenient viewing angle. So what I want to do is build an arm which attaches to the wall and can swing out and let me use it, and also swing right back in to allow the TV screen to tuck back out of the way. </p>

<p>So I designed this thing here. It's essentially two frames inside eachother. The inner frame is designed to transfer the weight of the TV to the left-hand side, which is attached by hinges to the outermost frame. That's why the bottom-most part of the innermost frame is at that angle. I believe that will transfer the weight in the expected direction. </p>

<p>Then the outer frame is the same, but in reverse. It transfers the weight from the left-hand side to the right-hand side, where it will attach in the same way, by hinges, to a post that's firmly bolted to the wall.</p>

<p>I put half dovetailed lap joints in all corners except the one with an acute angle. That's because that joint will experience more of a compressive force, so a bridle joint will probably fit okay there. And I think they're easier to cut so that's why I chose it. And the halfdovetaillapjoints are for joints which I think will be more pulled apart at, than pushed together by the weight of the TV. The idea is to glue and clamp these joints. I possibly will not need to use screws.</p>

<p>The whole thing will be made from 1.5""x1.5"" pine.</p>

<p>Is this design going to work as I think it will? That is, will the weight be transferred in the manner that I expect?</p>

"4'x8' length cut - circular saw, table saw, or panel saw?","<p>I'm a complete amateur trying to turn an old 14 wide x 22 long single car garage into a wood shop.  Nobody in my immediate family or friends does any serious woodworking, but I do have some family members/friends who have been in other trades for decades and are pretty handy, so I'm learning by researching and getting advice from them.</p>

<p>Lately I've been finding myself needing to cut full 4' x 8' plywood panels lengthwise down the middle for shelves or other things.  I'm the type that usually likes to research myself silly to find the best possible solution before committing to something.  In this case, it seemed to me that the answers online were pointing to a <strong>panel saw</strong>, though that may just be because I started from the perspective of ""What do places like Home Depot do?"" And I remembered they have large panel saws for things like this, and it seemed fitting since the word ""panel"" is in the name, it's obviously for cutting panels.</p>

<h2><strong>Note</strong></h2>

<p>I'm working on a serious budget, so I'm trying to avoid spending 1k+ or even more on a pre-made aluminum frame panel saw.  I looked around and saw that some folks have in fact built their own, such as <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cu5UU10F7NQ"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this youtube video</a>, or there are apparently kits you can buy such as <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TToT9hfPmXg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>, or <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qt4tqaa4lTg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>.  Though upon suggesting the idea of building a panel saw for this purpose, I was met with pretty strong resistance from 2 people, who both suggested their own solutions.</p>

<h2><strong>Options</strong></h2>

<h2><strong>1) Table Saw</strong></h2>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/9qlnh.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/9qlnh.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>One family friend suggested that a panel saw is too large and unwieldy, requiring 16 feet to push a panel fully through, or otherwise too difficult/a hassle to make, and I should instead use my existing 4x8 workbench, modify it to the height of a table saw he could lend, and buy some infeed rollers and push a full 4x8 panel through a table saw, outfeeding onto my workbench.</p>

<p>He at first convinced me, but upon further reading and thinking I realized some points:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Safety</strong> - On many woodworking sites/forums, I see many members claim that attempting to maneuver a 4x8 panel through a table saw could be pretty dangerous, and that table saws are best for smaller boards/panels.</li>
<li><strong>Practicality</strong> - It seems to me that this method would still require at least 16 linear feet of space, probably realistically more like 18-20, but would be even more unwieldy than a panel saw since the board would be horizontal rather than vertical. Additionally, this solution almost certainly <strong>would not work</strong> for also cutting an 8 ft piece width wise, so I'd ultimately have to use 2 different solutions.</li>
<li><strong>Quality</strong> - I have never used a table saw once in my life, but I imagine it might be hard to hold and maintain a 4x8 panel steady and straight against a fence, so I don't imagine getting high quality cuts perfecty every time would be easy with this method.</li>
</ol>

<h2><strong>2) Circular Saw</strong></h2>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/vjeGr.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/vjeGr.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>This is my current method. Another family member of mine essentially suggested I should continue with my current solution, which is propping up the plywood sheet above my workbench with 2x4, clamping down, setting up a guide board, and using a circular saw along the length, though he suggested I should lower my workbench height to make this easier. (Currently, my workbench height is approx 40 inches.  Would lowering to 36 really make this much easier?)</p>

<p>My thoughts on this were:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Safety</strong> - Seems fairly safe, as long as boards are securely clamped, and the saw is handled securely.</li>
<li><strong>Practicality</strong> - Practical in that it fits into the footprint of my workbench, but the entire reason I'm searching for another solution is because in my opinion, it's a pain to prop up a plywood sheet and clamp it down, tack on a guide board, and then struggle to securely hold a circular saw halfway across (2 ft) while cutting down the middle of the panel. Additionally, in cases where I need to first cut along the length, and then go back and cut across the width, I have to adjust and turn the 2x4 tracks underneath and the guide board every time.  Since I used 8ft board lengthwise, the boards are too long going the other way so I have to swap them out.</li>
<li><strong>Quality</strong> - Quality seems to be good, as long the guide is setup properly.</li>
</ol>

<h2><strong>3) Panel Saw</strong></h2>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/w55WG.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/w55WG.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>This is what places like Home Depot have setup for customers to use.  Assuming I can build a safe, reliable panel saw for fairly cheap, it seemed to me this would be the best option. <strong>Note</strong> - I do not count having to put in time and effort to build a panel saw as a negative of this option, because in fact I'm trying to build as many projects as I can, though I would count expense as a negative.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Safety</strong> - If the panel saw is sturdy, including the supports, the saw carriage, and the saw carriage rods, then it seemed to me this would be the <strong>safest</strong> of the 3 options.  The saw is fixed rigid, can only move in 1 axis, and is always facing away from the operator.</li>
<li><strong>Practicality</strong> - Very easy to use.  Just plop in the panel, adjust to position, and slide panel through saw (or saw across panel).</li>
<li><strong>Quality</strong> - Again, the saw is rigid, and if the bottom track support for the panel is perfectly inline with the blade, then the quality should be top notch and consistenly repeatable, correct? One good point brought up was if I'm trying to turn the saw 90 degrees and cut horizontally, isn't the top of the panel going to weigh down and bind up the blade?</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Other Thoughts</strong> - I had the idea of making a panel saw with traveling x and y axes, in order to deal with the issue of needing 16 feet of space, though this idea was lumped into the bag of ""too difficult"".</p>

<p>So ultimately, the question is what is the <strong>best</strong> method to make the most difficult 4x8 panel cuts (which seems to me to be lengthwise, down the middle), with respect to the 3 qualities I've brought up: safety, practicality, and quality? Am I right in thinking the panel saw is the answer to that question, or am I being naive and is one of the other suggestions made to be a better solution?</p>

<p>I know a thing or two about metal work, but almost nothing about woodwork, so I'm hoping for something fairly simple. I don't need the height adjustment to be continuous or even particularly easy.  My thought was to: </p>

<ul>
<li>chop off the bottom ~6"" of each leg and then cut that in half. </li>
<li>drill a hole in the ends of each piece</li>
<li>attach the pieces together with threaded rod</li>
</ul>

<p>Then adjusting the table height would involve screwing the bottom sections on or off one at a time. As a bonus I should be able to use that to level the top too.</p>

<p>Questions: </p>

<ul>
<li>Is this a sensible way to do things? The legs are straight vertical, so there shouldn't really be any horizontal forces on anything.  </li>
<li>Can I just use a drill press for the center holes, or do I need to remind myself how to use a lathe?</li>
<li>Any rule of thumb for picking the rod (material, thickness, threading)</li>
<li>What's the best way to attach the rod? I was thinking to tap the wood itself, then glue the rod into the bottom pieces.  Would something like a nut make more sense? If so, how do I attach the nut? (epoxy?)</li>
<li>Is there a completely different better way to do this?</li>

"Is it a problem if my countersink bit is slightly larger than it needs to be?","<p>I just want the ability to countersink (occasional use) and I have 6-7-8mm head screws and I'm buying a single 8.3mm countersink bit (Makita HSS P-73542 3 flute). But what's stopping me from not drilling with it all the way, just stop when the hole reaches ~6mm diameter for example? Officially, does the countersink bit need to reach its ""max"" diamater, THEN (by pushing it more) make a tiny half-mm straight ""wall"" for the side of the screw head? If that tiny wall is needed or I need more precision I guess I could even finish it with a 6mm normal wood drill bit, no?</p>

"How can I properly sharpen my knives with power tools?","<p>I have drawers full of knives and blades that have never been as sharp as when they came from the factory.  I have some whetstones, Lansky sharpeners, and leather strops.  I have tried to use those but eventually realized that I'm as likely to make an edge worse as I am to improve it.  In large part this is because:</p>

<ul>
<li>I can't maintain a proper and constant angle of attack while working a curved blade across a series of stones by hand.</li>
<li>I don't know which step to use or for how long, given a blade's condition.</li>
</ul>

<p>Meanwhile, I have benches full of power tools: Bench grinders, belt sanders, drill press.  I believe I can hold a reasonably constant angle while dragging a blade once or twice across a tool that's doing the work for me.</p>

<p>As I understand it, there are only three steps to producing a perfect edge:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Sharpen:</strong>  In this step the blade is run <em>against</em> the grit to grind a new edge.  Perhaps two grits (usually 100 and 400) are used in this step.  (Optionally, one might grind a relief angle that's more shallow than the cutting edge angle, but it's the latter one that has to be maintained going forward.)</li>
<li><strong>Hone:</strong> Here the blade is run <em>with</em> the grit to knock off burrs and nudge dings back in line.  Power honing is done with finer grits, but not sure how fine.</li>
<li><strong>Strop/polish:</strong> Once again the blade is run <em>with</em> the grit to smooth the edge.  You know you're done when the edge is as shiny as a mirror.</li>
</ol>

<p>With this in mind I began searching for sharpening wheels preloaded with an appropriate compound for each step.  Instead I've found a smorgasbord of wheels ranging from glass to paper, and <em>separate</em> polishing compounds of widely varying composition, many of which users report needing to supplement with oil and wax.  Great.  Am I missing a shortcut around selecting and loading the power sharpening tools?</p>

<p>Now, suppose I manage to find or prepare a line of 3 or 4 powered wheels.  I pick up a knife.  How do I know which step to start at?  And how do I know when I'm ready to move it to the next step?  I know that if I do it right then at the end I have a blade that will catch and slice cleanly through a loose sheet of newsprint.  But is there a foolproof way to get there without grinding away undue amounts of time and metal?</p>

"How can I strengthen my 3/4"" Plywood Bunk Bed Plan?","<p>I'm working on a plywood bunk bed for our two 4 year olds. Obviously I need it to look cool, but more importantly not collapse on their impressionable skulls.</p>

<p>I plan on using 3/4 plywood (.706 or so) with 3/8"" dowels and some pocket screws (as well as titebond). I don't want to over or under engineer it.</p>

<p>The width and depth allow for about 1/2"" on each side of the mattresses. I'm most concerned about</p>

<ol>
<li>racking left to right and back to front</li>
<li>enough support across the top long spans of 3/4"" to prevent collapsing.</li>

<p>I'm planning on possibly using corner glue/screw blocks (triangle shaped) to prevent affecting the mattress at all and 1.5"" x 1.5"" slat supports on both the uppers and lowers.</p>

<p>My question is, am I missing something that could strength the whole assembly? Will what I have planned be good enough? Is there a connector I'm overlooking. Didn't want to user metal 90 degree connectors because of the sharp edges but I <strong>could</strong> put them out of reach for the children.</p>

"Problems adjusting block plane","<p>I have an Irwin-Record 9Â½ block plane which I bought new a year or so ago and have been using and occasionally sharpening the blade on an oilstone. Now the blade-depth adjustment has reached the end of its travel. </p>

<p>When I adjust the blade depth wheel to the other end (fully retracted blade) and move the blade to the next position, the blade protrudes too far - about 1mm depth of cut. The only way to make this work seems to be to grind down the blade significantly which doesn't seem right.</p>

<p>Update following <a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/users/2779/scanny"">scanny</a>'s <a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/a/6657/158"">answer</a>:</p>

<p>Using a vernier caliper, the travel of the fine-adjust tooths without blade installed seems to be about 3mm. The spacing between front edges of all but one of the slots in the blade is about 4mm, so this looks like a design flaw. Maybe Irwin (or their far-away 3rd-party manufacturer) substituted a blade design to save costs somehow?</p>

<p>In fact, looking at it, only the first couple of slots can be used before the end of the long slot in the blade hits the lateral adjuster. </p>

<hr>

<p>Older Record blades and the current Ray Iles replacements only have grooves on the rear rather than through-slots and they may have been more finely spaced. I only have this photo to go by:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/5Cf3Z.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/5Cf3Z.jpg"" alt=""photo of Ray Iles blade for Record block plane""></a></p>

<p>If the long slot in this blade is the same length as that in my Irwin-Record blade (34.3mm), the adjustment grooves are spaced 3mm (centre to centre) and so are a better match to the fine adjustment travel.</p>

<hr>

<p>Using a dial indicator (as suggested) I measured the travel of the blade installed in the plane when moving the adjustment wheel from top (deepest blade position) to bottom (highest blade position) I measured a total movement of only 1.95mm - say 2mm. This is less than the 3mm travel in adjuster tooths which I measured when the blade was not in place.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Rk80n.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Rk80n.png"" alt=""Composite of Photos of measuring movement of plane-blade""></a><br>
<sup>(Plane is clamped down, subdial of indicator shows just under 2mm movement = 2 rotations of main dial for full travel of plane's adjustment wheel. Click for larger image)</sup></p>

<p>This is partly because at the top position, the pivot arm hits the underside of the blade before the adjustment wheel reaches the top of it's screw. There's also a large vertical clearance gap between the adjustment wheel and the edges of the corresponding slot in the pivot lever in which the wheel sits - so part of the wheel's travel doesn't move the lever, until the wheel reaches the other side of the clearance gap.</p>

<p>Given the spacing of the adjustment slots is 4mm, I can't see how this blade can be moved to the adjacent slot and positioned ready for use without grinding the blade down by 1 or 2 mm.</p>

"To Resin or Not To Resin (Cracked Gum Wood)","<p>I have the slab shown in the pics below.  During the drying/curing process it developed many micro cracks a few larger (some through-slab) cracks.

<p>I've worked on one slab before this so I am a novice as of yet.</p>

<p>I love the character the cracks add to the slab and am curious about two things w.r.t. using 105/205 West System resin as to fill cracks on it:</p>

<p>1) Will filling cracks with resin visually add or detract? </p>

<p>2) Would filling with 105/205 West resin add any real strength?  I just bought the slab and while it seems thoroughly dried, I'm uncertain as to whether new cracks will inevitably form due to the type of wood that it is.</p>

<p>3) How does one fill the live-edge side of the slab with resin while avoiding bleeding of the resin into the wood surrounding the cracks?  The bleeding normally of course needs heavy sanding to remove, but I'm afraid of this heavy sanding due to concerns of destroying the feel/look of the live edge.</p>

"Stopping a table saw by turning off at the outlet","<p>I have the much-maligned Makita MLT100 table saw. For all its faults, after a fair amount of fettling I've got it working fine.</p>

<p>However I've taken to stopping the saw by turning off the switch at the wall. This has a few advantages:</p>

<ol>
<li>It turns off the shop vac connected to the same outlet.</li>
<li>It triggers the safety cutout plug I use (so simply switching back on doesn't actually turn on the power).</li>
<li>It means I lean AWAY from the saw to stop it, rather than bending down and in TOWARDS THE SPINNING BLADE OF DEATH to turn it off.</li>
<li>I have three young children around, and it's a 3-step process to start the saw:

<ul>
<li>Turn on outlet.</li>
<li>Turn on safety breaker (at which point the shop vac will come on, as it was switched on all along).</li>
<li>Start saw using green button on the saw itself.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>I've found that the green/red power switch on the saw itself appears to turn itself off when power is cut (this makes sense - in the case of power coming back after a power cut, you wouldn't want your table saw starting itself back up!), and the brake still kicks in as normal.</p>

"Fixing mistake: Filling the gap in a breadboard end on tabletop","<p>I am building a pine desk/table (with handtools, so far) with a breadboard end design. One end piece does not sit flush with the tabletop everywhere along the entire width of the panel (32"" or so). Out of impatience, I gave up on tweaking the shoulders to get the perfect fit along both (cosmetic) shoulders of the tabletop (top/under).</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/QfkWn.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/QfkWn.jpg"" alt=""the gap in the table top (not scraped, not sanded)""></a></p>

<p>Now that it's closed up, the gap is noticeable. I also feel that debris will get lodged there. But maybe not.</p>

<p>I'd like to cover that gap. Is making a clean groove with a plough plane and placing an inlay between the top and breadboard end a technically feasible option at this point? What about inserting wedges, or running some sort of bead?</p>

<p>I see using filler is recommended in other similar questions, but it is reported to crack within a year or two, as the panel narrows/widens. </p>

<p>The plan is to finish it with oil, and I wonder how much of the gap will be covered by the finish.</p>

<h3>How to avoid in the future?</h3>

<p>I have a chance to fix the problem on the other side of the table, as I haven't closed up the other end yet -- I'm including an image of the construction (same as the one that's closed).</p>

<p>To close them, I have a 2""-wide strip of glue only on the center tenon, and 3/8"" dowels. The dowels going through the non-center tenons can slide in elongated holes.</p>

<p>The only tools I have at my disposal for this, are a skillsaw (and jig) and handtools/planes (handsaws, paring chisels, bench #4, #5, block, and rabbet). I've tried using my rabbet plane as a shoulder plane along the width of the table to make the wall truly square, but running perpendicular to the grain creates tearout along the cosmetic shoulder of the table -- so I feel i'm trading one problem for another.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong><em>Edit</em></strong></p>

<p>I gave up on fixing the long edge gap, and will leave it as is (for now). However, after cutting the horns of my breadboard ends on either side of the table, my subpar chiselling of the mortise haunch became extremely obvious -- and I decided it was worth it to try the ""thick shaving method"" there.</p>

<p>I handsawed off the horns a few mm over on each side -- to allow for some error. Some decide to leave longer breadboard ends to create a design element/feature out of them, or decide to enclose the haunch completely, but I wanted them flush and I wanted to be able to see the haunch. Anticipating some end grain planing, I pared the corners of the horns off with a chisel to prevent breakout.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/f37A1m.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/f37A1m.jpg"" alt=""Before planing the horns""></a>
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/f37A1.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">(larger)</a></p>

<p>As I got closer to being flush, I switched to sanding. And I started to notice how bad the gaps were, with the dust accumulating in the gaps, (in the image, the white sand dust outlines the gap around the haunch):</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/FMv2sm.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/FMv2sm.jpg"" alt=""horns sanded down exposed gaps""></a>
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/FMv2s.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">(larger)</a></p>

<p>I couldn't produce shavings/sliver thick enough with the plane, so I produced them by paring with a chisel on a spare piece of wood, and adjusted the thickness of the created thin wedge with sandpaper. I applied glue only the breadboard-end side, wedged the shim into the gap, trimmed it and sanded it flush.</p>

<p>I believe I could have glued just the haunch side instead, but the fibers would have needed to be oriented the other way, and it's easier to wedge in parallel with the breadboard end grain.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/LdLqLm.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/LdLqLm.jpg"" alt=""sliver wedged into the gap""></a>
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/LdLqL.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">(larger)</a></p>

<p>In retrospect I should have switched from the plane to the sanding block sooner, because the last few runs with the plane pulled some fibres out around the edge, as can be seen in the upper lip of the mortise, in the form of little ""craters"". It would have also looked better if I'd picked wedges that matched the end grain zebra pattern, but it was quite a puzzle already -- again, more patience would have helped.</p>

<p><strong>Edit 2</strong>: It's been a few months already, and I'm noticing that the table width of the top shrinks and expands by about 1/16"" on each side of the table (average width of 30""), varying with indoor humidity. The glued wedges are holding up so far. This was expected from the start, but the breadboard end length is not always flush with the table. I like to think of it as a built-in *digital hygrometer feature . I sanded the horns flush around the holiday season, so it might be the gift that keeps on giving, depending on how the finish affects it.</p>

<p>*digital, as in: you can read it by passing your digits over it.</p>

"Framing Nail/Nailer Angles/Types?","<p>I'm somewhat curious about framing nailer angles &amp; framing nails. I see that they come in a variety of angles, and the nails that they fire tend to be different as well. I've also heard that despite this, there isn't much difference between framing nailers aside from how close you can fit the gun into a frame due to the angle of the magazine. I've also observed that there are several nail types, each with a different nail-nail attachment method (Such as paper, or plastic connectors between them). From my observations, I think that the paper stays with the nail when it is shot, and prevents water intrusion into the wood target, whereas the plastic just fragments on launch and impact.</p>

"To prepare SPF (spruce/pine/fir) tabletop before a finish: should I use scraping, planing, or sanding?","<p>My tabletop is made of selected SPF boards and has been planed with a handplane. I've added breadboard ends to each end. I'm preparing the surface for a finish, and trying to avoid sanding altogether, using a combination of planes and/or scrapers. I can obtain a sufficiently smooth and reflexive surface with just planing on individual boards of the same material.</p>

<p>I was hoping I'd be able to do a final pass with only a card scraper over the surface to remove irregularities, remaining visible glue, remaining pencil marks, and remaining little bits of tearout around knots, but my scraping makes the glassy surface I had from just planing look more dull -- i am losing some sheen.</p>

<p>I could maybe re-plane the entire surface one last time, but planing has been made difficult at this point with the addition of breadboard ends, orthogonal to the grain direction of the main panel. To a lesser degree, this is also true of the possible grain-direction reversal at the boundary of each board of the main panel (i.e. I don't think I considered grain direction when assembling my panel).</p>

<p>On softwoods (i.e. woods with low-density fiber), in practice, can card scrapers (once sharpened properly) be used to achieving a surface comparable in smoothness and reflection to that obtained by planing (i.e. well-tuned bench plane)? Can card scrapers achieve high gloss also on softwood endgrain?</p>

<p>Or should I just give up the blades, and sand it like it's 1999.</p>

"Proper sequence of acclimating wood for building","<p>I have heard it said that one should always acclimate wood to one's woodshop before milling the lumber (so it can adjust to humidity and stabilize it's size).

Given what I know about moisture content, my immediate thought was that I'd have to wait a year before this lumber is ready to work with. Is this true?

"Filling gaps/seams in a new cherry tabletop","<p>I've created a tabletop for a desk. It's made of 4/4 cherry boards of different lengths and widths that I've laminated together on the edges. This was then glued onto a plywood top. </p>

<p>I've never made a tabletop before, only had a few bar clamps, and ended up with some visible gaps and seams that I wants to fill. A couple are where boards meet edge to edge, while a couple others are where boards meet end to end. </p>

<p>The cherry just had a rough sanding so far and is still unfinished. I plan to coat it with a simple polyurethane. </p>

<p>Before I finish it, however, I want to fill those seams and gaps with something that will roughly match the wood and will accept the polyurethane. </p>

<p>Help? Do I use a mix of wood glue and cherry wood dust? Should I just fill with wood filler? What's the best way? Thanks! </p>

"How do I prevent stain from being removed during sanding?","<p>I am refinishing an old Remington 870 stock birch stock. I stained it with a dark cherry colored stain, and then began to apply <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B000I1QA6E"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Hope's 100% tung oil</a>. I had read to wait at least a day before sanding and applying the next coat, though <a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/questions/573/how-long-does-it-take-tung-oil-to-cure"">that</a> seems to be a short period of time. However, when I sanded the stock, much of the stain I had applied was removed along with the tung oil (if I recall correctly, I was using 340 grit paper, and I had cut the first application of oil about 50% with mineral spirits). </p>

<p>I decided to restain the whole stock, and ended up staining it several times, letting it dry and wiping down with mineral spirits to remove the tackiness between each coat (I know that multiple coats are generally advised against, but the birch wasn't accepting the stain evenly and this helped me get a fairly even, nice stain). The stock is now fully dry (wiped the access stain off a day or two later with the help of mineral spirits, and then let dry for a week). </p>

<p><strong>My question is</strong>: is there a way to properly apply tung oil to the stained wood without removing the stain during the sanding process? Do I simply need to wait longer for it to dry, not sand between the first couple of coats, use a finer grit sandpaper, or what?</p>

<p><em>Bonus question</em>: This being my first woodworking project, my sanding left something to be desired. There are very minor sanding marks in the wood that I didn't notice before staining. They are mostly in the same direction of the grain of the wood, but a few of the swirls I didn't match perfectly. Is there anything I can do to fix this without removing the stain and starting over? It doesn't bother me very much, but I would feel unacceptably lazy if I didn't even make an effort to fix it. </p>

"Is all fine grit count sandpaper called wet/dry?","<p>I need to start getting into sharpening and honing so naturally one of the ways I could go would be to get some sandpaper in the 500 + grit count range. (That decision is based off a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ki8tt-VjwqI"">great video I saw from Paul Sellers</a> that suggest this being a more economical method when starting out. )</p>

<p>At most home improvement stores, in the sections where I normally find sandpaper, the highest grit count I will come across is around 320. However, in automotive sections I find the higher grit counts I am looking for which is usually up to 2000! They are advertised as wet/dry paper. </p>

<p>So is all the very fine/high grit count paper actually wet/dry sandpaper? Is wet/dry just a gimmick of terms? If I find anything with the right grit count does it matter what kind of paper it is (assuming there are multiple kinds)? </p>

<p>The desk is made of particleboard, and the original desktop is attached with cam lock fasteners. The cam screws go into the bottom of the desktop and engage with cam nuts in the drawer unit and side support. (General illustration of fasteners below, not indicative of how they're actually used in my desk.)</p>

<p>My first thought was that I could simply screw the cam screws into the solid wood countertop and attach it to the drawers and side support the same way as the original desktop. However, it then occurred to me that I might need to account for the solid wood expanding and contracting with changes in humidity (as I understand, this isn't really a concern with particleboard).</p>

<p>Am I right to be concerned with wood movement? If so, how can I best attach the countertop in a way that allows it to move without damage?

"Panel Glue up Question","<p>I apologize for this elementary question, but I'm just getting started with woodworking. I'm working on my first panel glue up - made of 1x6 walnut. I'm wondering how ""square"" the edges of the planks have to be in order to get a seamless joint. I'm asking because I bought the wood rough sawn and bought a nice track saw to straight-line the edges. I don't have a jointer so I was hoping by buying a nice track saw that I could get joint ready edges off the saw. What I'm seeing is that saw must be riding ever so slightly crooked in the track because when I check the edges of the planks with a combination square, there is a very tiny sliver of light I can see on one side of the edge. It's really a sliver as I have to shine a light behind it to see it. The edge is consistent throughout the length of the board. Is this sort of thing normal and considered to be within the tolerance of a nice track saw? Will planks that are just ever so slightly out of square pull together with clamps? </p>

<p>Since I've never done this before, I'm not sure if I'm being too much of a perfectionist or if there really is cause for concern.</p>

<p>I think this might be happening because the weight of the saw wants to ""fall off the edge"" on the side of the saw making the cut. I might be able to resolve this by figuring out how to get a more stable base to work from as I was trying to use the garage floor which isn't the easiest to work from. </p>

"Choosing a saw for oak worktop, considering future usefulness","<p>I've got a few cuts to make on some (large) offcuts of 40mm oak worktop. They are all straight, each cut up to 60cm long, from one side of the piece to the other. while this is technically within spec for my jigsaw, there's no way it's up to the job: the top of the cut may look straight but on a board this thick the back wanders all over the place, even if it take it very gently. It would also take forever even with a new blade. </p>

<p>So a shopping trip is in order. I'm a bit short on space, and don't want to spend a fortune on something that will be used rarely at best. I'm considering either:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>a sabre (reciprocating) saw, which is compact and likely to be quite useful in the future (e.g. with a coarse tree-trimming blade). It might even replace the tired old jigsaw. </p></li>
<li><p>a circular saw. I haven't needed to use one in 20 years so it's likely to end up sitting in a box for quite some time. I regard it as mainly useful for wood-based  sheet material, and not the thin stuff. That doesn't leave much that I actually do. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>In theory I could replace/upgrade the jigsaw, but it's fine on thin sheet material and in not convinced a new one would be so much better. I'm not adverse to hiring something, if there's a much better way that's bulky or expensive. </p>

"How do I stop the table I built from wobbling/shaking side to side?","<p>I got a wood cut and bought adjustable table legs, secured the legs to the wood, but the table wobbles/shakes horribly side to side, and sometimes even the other way when i even only write something slowly on it.</p>

<p>The things i tried so far to fix it:</p>

<ol>
<li>Leveling the legs. </li>
<li>Putting cork slices under the legs. </li>
<li>wrapping fishing line between the crossing legs. (not all around the all legs)</li>
</ol>

<p>It only stops shaking a little bit if i lean the table to something standing still but i don't want to use it that way, also i don't want to fix the table to the wall.</p>

<p>If i am not wrong i need to add braces to the table, but i don't know how to do it. Should they be installed only between the legs, or also secured to the bottom of the table too?</p>

<p>The legs are not wooden also have no places to add anything onto it. How can i add these braces and where can i find braces with a desired length?</p>

<p>The way the legs secured to the table, and the added fishing line.</p>

"Does a route table sag if you do not leave the router attached to it?","<p>I am slowly putting together an absolute beginner workshop (too much to call it so) without trying to invest too much money since I am doing woodworking for fun and some practical needs around the house. The scope of my work will be some floor to ceiling custom shelves, picture frames, small boxes, smaller shelves, a shoe box and some other things that will not be big in size. Probably the shelves will be the only big thing that I will ever build. I am also planning to build a deck and a pergola but these are not really woodworking.</p>

<p>Having the above said I am considering building a router table and I have questions around choosing the right material for the table top. 
My question is this: would a router table top sag if the router will not be permanently attached to it ?
I am considering using high density MDF for the top. </p>

<p>I have seen builds where MDF was used and then laminate applied to it. While I might consider this I have doubts regarding my ability to obtain an absolutely plane surface after applying the laminate. </p>

<p>I would be OK to have to build another table top every two or three years (I do not expect my projects to take me longer than that)</p>

<p>One more question: if I go the laminate way, do I apply the laminate before or after I cut my slots for my t-tracks, the router insert opening and the miter slot ?</p>

"What is causing this poor refinishing result and how do I fix it?","<p>I followed the procedure of stripping, sanding, staining and then polyurethaning the top of two antique, about 75 years, dressers. The one came out beautifully. The other has questionable results. </p>

<p>There was an area of the one dresser that had what I believed was water damage. It is unknown if my conjecture is correct, but that would be the most logical answer. I got the old varnish off with citra strip. The area of the suspected water damage was discernable but not egregious. I then sanded the top to a silky smooth texture. Due to the age of the dresser I suspected that there was a veneer on the top so I used 150 then 220. Both sanding steps were on the easy does it scale. The tops were silky when done. </p>

<p>I stained both twice for 10 mins each time to get correct color. When I applied the Minwax Fast Drying Polyurethane Clear Satin to the one dresser it seemed to almost 'bead like water' in the area of the former stain. When dry, there was a textural difference in that area. I was hoping that it would self correct with the light sanding and the application of a second coat. It only got worse. </p>

<p>I am obviously going to remove the poly and try again. What could be causing this problem? Can it be prevented from happening again? Also, in between all the steps, I used tacky cloth to ensure that the tops were free of debris.</p>

"What wood/finish would hold up to use in a video game controller?","<p>A while back, I went on a spree of replacing handles with wood in some tools/toys I had, since I quite liked the feel. In the past couple years, I've picked up competitive gaming, and would like the comfort of wood in <a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51CdKCZnG3L.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">my controller</a>, if possible. </p>

<p>However, compared to my previous projects, this would be handled much more extensively, and would require much smaller parts for buttons/stick caps, so I don't trust my judgment on what a reasonable choice of wood and finish would be. </p>

<p>I've worked with redwood in the past, and it seems like it would hold up well for the grips both from past experience and from some articles I've found. </p>

<p>For the buttons and stick caps, I'm guessing that no wood I choose will be able to have the fine detail necessary while still maintaining the strength required, and that I'll need to instead make the structural portion out of metal or plastic, and add wood caps. Given that, at that point, fine detail is the main issue, I was thinking basswood.</p>

<p>I've never used a finish, since longevity was never really a concern. Having the feeling of wood is rather the point of the project, but from my research, that seems at odds with decent protection from wear/hand oils. </p>

<p>Do redwood and basswood seem like reasonable choices for this project? </p>

<p>Are there any finishes that wouldn't feel like varnish, but would also protect the wood from frequent handling?</p>

This I find puzzling. First it appears there are some bulkheads. Longitudinal ""stringers"" are fixed to them. I presume their only purpose is to define the hull shape, sort of like a spline. On this ""stringers"" the vertical frames are attached. This I presume will stay as structure of the boat. And i guess on top of this frames comes the planking. Andthen another assumption from me: inner bulkheads and ""stringers"" are removed so only frames and plankig remain? Am I correct or wrong. Actually I would like this thing explained to me. </p>

"Table Saw Bevel Maths?","<p>I'm looking to make Triangular &amp; Hexagonal shelves, but I'm getting confused by some of the maths involved for the bevels. To make a hexagon I need a 120 degree angle, but I need 2 pieces to make that angle, so I do: 120/2 = 60 degrees each. </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/d7zhv.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/d7zhv.png"" alt=""Hexagon""></a>
So I would think that I can set my bevel gauge to 60 degrees on my table saw (Hypothetically, I'm aware that my bevel doesn't go that far and that I can use a jig to hold the workpeice vertically to do the complement of 30 degrees, effectively making it 60 degrees)</p>

<p>I'm having similar issues for the equilateral triangle shelves. I've seen people cut their straight stock at a 30 degree bevel and wind up with angles that don't look right, such as:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/8rhwC.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/8rhwC.png"" alt=""Triangular Shelf""></a></p>

<p>Here, you see that the shelf is not assembled at the edges, and is instead on the face. This doesn't look right to me, and seems to imply that the person didn't know how to cut the angles properly. I've seen proper bevels cut and they look really nice, even at non 90 degree bevels, such as this one from Foureyes:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/knz0c.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/knz0c.png"" alt=""Foureyes Bevel""></a></p>

<p>How can I resolve these issues? What bevel should I cut my straight stock on, so that I can make these shapes?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 0: In general, if I want to cut a 30 degree angle in Cartesian space, do I set my bevel gauge to 30 degrees?</strong></p>

<p><strong>EDIT 1: Stranger yet, I've seen the hexagons be cut at a 30 degree bevel by this video (<a href=""https://youtu.be/_sQzIbgQjig?t=38"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://youtu.be/_sQzIbgQjig?t=38</a>), and my intuition tels me that a transformation function is used to convert between Cartesian space and table saw bevel space. He needed a 60 degree angle in Cartesian space so he took the compliment of 60 degrees and obtained an angle of 30 degrees, and this is what he set his table saw to. Is this thinking correct?</strong></p>

<h2>*Edit -- Fixed it. Reporting on results *</h2>

<p>Following advice in the answers and comments, I've accepted to use non-wood products into the table. I figured that in the worst case, I could still do the patch. But I am quite satisfied with the results.</p>

<p>Materials:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>A small tube of ""Dark Umber"" artist oil paint bought at local craft store.</p></li>
<li><p>A ""syringe"" of clear 5-minute epoxy bought at the local hardware store</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Steps:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>In clean plastic container add, in one corner, a dab of (yet unmixed) epoxy, and in another, a smaller dab of paint. Using a toothpick, stir gradually more and more of the pigment until desired color is obtained. Create a gradient (mess) of colors to pick from.

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/5Er7cm.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/5Er7cm.jpg"" alt=""mixture""></a></p></li>
<li><p>Mix in fine sawdust from a scraping session, which yields a more matte and opaque result. Without sawdust, the cured epoxy is very vitrous and transparent. You can also obtain opaque epoxy without sawdust by using more pigment.</p></li>
<li><p>Use the toothpick as an applicator on the work piece. Disturb as little as possible what is already filled when adding more. I accidentally created mini air bubbles when trying to ""pack"" more in. (<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ke7fx.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">full res</a>)</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ke7fxm.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ke7fxm.jpg"" alt=""application""></a></p></li>
<li><p>Waited 16h (the recommended full-cure time on the product), and removed most of the cured excess with a sharp chisel. Then card-scraped the rest. I'm pleased with the results. (<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/BkGrH.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">full res</a>)</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/BkGrHm.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/BkGrHm.jpg"" alt=""filled and scraped""></a></p>

<p><em>Note</em>: The addition of oil-based pigment to an epoxy resin reduces the final hardness of the cured epoxy. This might be important to consider when using epoxy as an adhesive bond between two objects -- but it doesn't matter as much when used as a filler. In fact, the cured epoxy obtained is much harder than the surrounding wood -- can't sink or scratch it with fingernails.</p></li>

<pre><code>Length: 4 ft
Depth: 1 ft
Height: 1.5ft
Total volume: 170l

<p>The tank is fairly hefty glass, and has a flat base (Which means the weight will be evenly distributed across the base, rather than just around the edges).</p>

<p>I want to build a work surface in my kitchen that will hold the fish tank on top (and maybe also have space in front of it to eat breakfast). It will need to be fairly tall to accommodate this. The dimensions I was thinking are:</p>

<pre><code>Length: about the same as the tank, with a slight overlap - i.e. 4ft
Height: 3ft
Depth: 1.5ft (so tank + 6 inches) or perhaps a little more
</code></pre>

<p>I want to be able to fit my bins under the table, and sit at it - hence the height. This height also matches that of the other worktops in my kitchen, so it works well.</p>

<p>I want this to be free-standing - i.e. not attached to the wall. There's a radiator behind it (not ideal for the tank really, but that's the only spare space we have).</p>

<p>Now, I have watched this video: <a href=""https://youtu.be/wPMn0xXjZF4"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://youtu.be/wPMn0xXjZF4</a> which has given me some idea of what I need to do, but I still have a few questions as I don't want that exact design (his height is about right but it's deeper and longer than I need), and this is my first major design project so I need more basic help than he's offering:</p>

<li>The weight of the tank + water is over 200kg. The video suggests x4 for a live load, so I'm coming up to 1000kg of load all-in. How should I allow for that in my design?</li>
<li>I don't want the horizontal supports on the bottom of the front edge, as we need potentially to be able to sit with our legs under it. The other three edges can have them though. Obviously I won't clad the front edge either</li>

"After stripping paint and applying wood stain, item is looking very blotchy... now what?","<p>I am in the process of restoring an item of furniture that had been painted black, back to a wood finish.  I started off by stripping off the paint with Citri-strip and sanding  it until it felt smooth. At this point parts of the wood had a pale greenish hue and others did not, but I proceeded, just hoping it would be covered by the stain.</p>

<p>I started with Minwax Pre-Stain Wood Conditioner and followed it with a basic Minwax stain (yellow can). After the first coat I could tell it really wasn't absorbing evenly-- some areas were very, VERY dark while others looked more like what I'd expect after a first coat of stain. Apparently fairly dependent on how the wood grain had been cut on each piece. I could tell that a second coat would likely only make it worse. </p>

<p>I don't know what kind of wood this item is made out of but it is rather soft, and I don't know exactly what kind of paint had been on it either-- some kind of fairly hard enamel. It originally had a pecan-toned wood finish but was painted at some point in the 1970s.</p>

<p>My question is what should I do now to get a second chance at an even finish? My first reaction was to start sanding it down again to try to sand through the stain but I can tell it will take a lot of sanding to get through it. Should I just keep on sanding? Could I try chemically stripping it again? Once I get it back down to bare wood, <strong>what should I seal it with before staining so that this doesn't happen again</strong>? The Minwax pre-stain seems to have been inadequate for this wood.</p>

<p>Also, any idea as to why parts of the wood might have looked greenish? My best guess was that it was a byproduct of the paint, but I don't know.</p>

"Is there another name for these heavy duty cam-style clamps?","<p>I have a Porter Cable dovetail jig that has clamps for holding the boards. (Other brands have similar clamps.) These have wide bars supported only at the ends, so there is room for a wide board to pass through. The clamp is actuated by a lever, with cams on a tube that spans the clamping bar.</p>

<p>The description refers to them as ""Heavy Duty Cam-Style Clamps"".</p>

"Wood selection and thickness for a laminate workbench top","<p>I am planning a proper woodworking workbench for my shop in a Roubo style with a laminate top. The top will be 2 1/2' x 6'. As I will likely have this bench for the rest of my life, I do not mind spending a little more on the wood. So, after looking at the current availability and pricing at my local lumber yard, I narrowed my choices down to the following, ordered by my preference:</p>

<ol>
<li>Black Cherry</li>
<li>Red Oak</li>
<li>American Ash</li>
<li>Douglas Fir</li>
<li>Southern Yellow Pine</li>
</ol>

<p>I chose these as they are available and are also not too hard so I can minimize damage to any piece I'm working on if it drops onto the top. The hardest in the list is the ash, just barely over the red oak. The softest being the fir, with the yellow pine a tad harder. The cherry is in the sweet spot, both in aesthetics and hardness. </p>

<p>Originally, I had planned to make the whole thing out of yellow pine, as it is the cheapest. However, my local lumber yard currently has good prices on 8/4 S2S cherry, so my preference is to build the bulk of the top out of cherry and use ash for the areas where the dog holes and vises will be, plus maybe an ash strip down the middle. I don't want the bench to be too heavy so I am considering making the top 3 1/2 - 4"" thick.</p>

<p>I'm curious to hear any comments or concerns this design. Specifically, would there be any issues gluing cherry and ash together? Would it be more stable over time if the laminate top was made from a single species? Also, is 3 1/2"" thick enough for dog holes and holdfasts?</p>

"A beginner's question about sanding, stain, and polyurethane for a SMOOTH finish","<p>I'm doing to hobby pieces using 3/4"" pine ply.</p>

<p>On my faces, I've sanded with 80, then 120, then finish with 220 using random orbit sander.</p>

"Is there danger of combustion using raw flax / linseed oil for platform bed?","<p>I have built a platform bed using 90%+ cedar (all but some quarter round and the legs). </p>

<p>My plan was to use raw, food grade flax / linseed oil to finish it. I like the idea of the raw oil not having chemicals added. Plus, Iâve used this on cedar shelves and love the depth of color it brings to the wood. Since this is an indoor piece and made in cedar, it doesnât seem to me that there is a need to apply multiple coats to protect it (correct me if Iâm wrong on this), so Iâm not too worried about drying time - I just want to get one good coat on. </p>

<p>My primary concern is the fact that it takes longer (days to weeks?) to oxidize than boiled linseed oil. If I put the bed on the frame before it fully oxidizes/cures, is there a risk of combustion? </p>

<p>Iâm not putting the oil on the slats that the bed sits on, but it would be on the inside of the top layer of trim (about about 3/4â deep). This would be covered by the side of the bed. Thoughts??</p>

"How to remove staining caused by a clamp","<p>I was putting sapele inlay into maple.  The inlay was proud by about an 1/8th inch so I only used packing on the underside of the clamp, figuring that any indentations on the top side would be planed out.  </p>

<p>It was mostly ok except that I had to use a couple of G clamps instead of my plastic faced F clamps in a couple of spots (ran out of clamps - does anybody ever have enough?).  The clamps were proud of the maple but there appears to have been some sort of reaction with glue squeeze-out that has caused a sort of 'ebonzing' stain from the face of the clamp, through the glue puddle and into the wood.  I hang my head in shame - I should have packed top and bottom and I promise I will NEVER take that short-cut again.</p>

<p>I have sanded most of the staining out but in a couple of patches it seems to go on forever and I am getting worried about planing or sanding deeper (bearing in mind that I don't have a planer, being a hobbyist, so must do it by hand and the maple has some pretty, but gnarly, grain that tears out as soon as you look at it).  </p>

"advice for glue-and-screw butt joint","<p>I am an amateur, building a set of kidâs beds.  I have prepared side rails, headboard and footboard; I am ready to attach everything.  I intend simple end-to-face butt joints with glue and screws.</p>

<p>I am not sure 1. what size screws to use and 2. whether to screw or glue first.</p>

<p>All the wood is 2cm Ã 4cm pine.  The primary tools I have are a borrowed miter saw, clamps, and a drill.  I drilled holes in the headboard already.  I also (using a regular 10mm bit) cut out countersink for the screw head because in my tests it was hard to get the large heads anywhere near flush and I donât want to overtension the screws going into the endgrain.  If I can cover the screws afterwards, all the better.</p>

<h3>Screw size</h3>

<p>My screw optionsâall in mmâare 5Ã60, 5Ã70, 6Ã60, and 6Ã80.  (These are outer diameters, for 5mm screws I would drill a 4mm pilot hole and for 6mm a 5mm pilot.)  I like the idea of beefier, longer screws for strength, but in my tests I found drilling and driving them a bit more challenging.  As shown in the close-up I plan to put two at each joint, and the bed doesnât need to support more than about 100kg.  Are the 5Ã60 screws sufficient?</p>

<h3>Screw first or glue first?</h3>

<p>Iâd like to screw first because I think preparing the pilot holes would be much easier (especially if I use the larger screws) and I could use the screws to hold the pieces together when the glue dries.  As pictured, I have everything clamped into place (no glue yet), so it seems like I could start the pilot holes, disassemble, finish the pilot holes, apply the glue, put the screws in, clamp everything, and tighten the screws.</p>

<p>On the other hand, my experience from a few tests is that even when starting a pilot hole with clamped pieces, itâs hard to get the joint lined up nicely, so  my feeling is I may be better off gluing first and only later drilling the pilot holes and putting in the screws.  The disadvantages of that approach are that I canât use the screws to apply extra pressure while the glue sets and that I lose 2cm of pilot hole depth due to the thickness of the headboard.  (my 4mm bit is only 72mm long)</p>

<p>Any additional advice would be appreciated, but given the constraints of time and location, I am not in a position to use any more advanced tools or materials.  (I could easily use small plastic or metal corner brackets if that were preferable, although my planned approach seems more elegant to me.)</p>

"How do I stop cracking noises from my pergola?","<p>I have built a pergola on my own about 1.5 years ago and it doesn't stop making those cracking wood noises (like the wood is cracking).</p>

<p>First of all I know I have built the pergola pretty good because I have followed the instruction of a friend who owns a wood business, and the pergola also ""passed the test"" of a very bad weather with very strong wind and rain this winter.
I examined the pergola and I couldn't see any cracks or broken wood anywhere.</p>

<p>There are 2 kind of noises that I hear, I assume that 1 of the noises comes from the material that lays on top of the wooden pergola, while the other noise comes from the wood itself.</p>

<p>The noises comes mostly when there is a change in the weather, the noises start when the sun comes out and last for about few minutes, they start again when the sun goes away, and so on every day.</p>

<p>At first I assumed its because the wood is new, and I know wood tend to expand and shrink depending the weather, moist and such, but I thought that after a year it would stop, but it doesn't, the noises sounds the same.</p>

<p>I figured the noises come from the small wood bars that lay on top of the ""main"" frame and not from the frame itself, those wood bars are there just so there would be less sun inside and not for holding the structure together, when we put them on, they were not straight enough, so we had to manually put them in the right place with force to be straight, and I assume because of this I hear the crack sounds because they are trying to bend back to their first form.</p>

<li><p><strong>Should I be worried? How can I check if I should be worried or not?</strong> While I can't see any big cracks in the wood I know that in most cases it doesn't matter and the wood can break without notice anyway.</p></li>

"How do you plane end grain?","<p>I tend to like power tools, because I need a lot less 'skill' to get the same quality product.  However, I do like learning hand tool techniques and sometimes they are just as good or better than power tools.  Sometimes faster if you only have one or two 'pieces' to do, instead of setting up the power tools to do it.</p>

<p>So I keep catching comments in different places about planing end grain.  Do you need special planes?  Special technique?  Just use a beltsander? :)</p>

"Best setup to make dovetails","<p>I'm trying to figure out the best way to make clean dovetails joints using a router (maybe?).  I've tried by hand, results were not so good.  I got excited a while back and bought one of those porter cable router jigs.  It kind of worked but chipped out great chunks of the dove tail when I tried to use it.  That ended up a mess for me.</p>

<p>Now I was tempted by the incra router table and fence system which seems accurate at least.  Someone showed me something called the woodrat which looked interesting at first but started to look a little hokey as the demo video went on.</p>

<p>I was all excited to get an incra table but then I thought, is this just going to chip everywhere like the jig?  So I'm not sure the best route to go.</p>

<p>I'm a moderately experienced hobbyist, and I don't have a router table yet.  About the most complicated thing I've built is a crib with mortise and tenon joints.  I want to be able to make dovetails to make drawers and boxes.</p>

"Is vertical storage of sheet goods causing my boards to warp?","<p>I have a consistent problem with warped sheet goods, particularly plywood and MDF. They always seem flat when I buy them, but by the time I use them they are always curved or twisted. It's a source of constant frustration. Even 3/4"" stuff gets a slight curve.</p>

<p>The way I've always stored everything is simply to lean piles of it against a wall. I don't have a lot of space.</p>

<p>After a recent comments discussion it dawned on me that this might be the problem:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Totally off topic, but how did the MDF warp in the first place? I have this problem where none of my MDF stays straight, and it frustrates me because all I hear about is how stable MDF is. â Jason C </p>
  
  <p>The piece was stored vertically and had leaned a bit in the storage rack causing a slight twist. â Ashlar</p>

"Cheap table saw fence techniques","<p>For a set of bookshelfs I decided to slice up a 4*8 sheet of cabinet grade plywood.</p>

I set my table saw to 6 inches and started cutting me sides blissfully confident that my rip fence would let me make consistent sides and shelves.</p>

<p>what I got was a set of oddly bowed and tapered boards.</p>

"Enlarging a Hole made by a Hole Saw","<p>I drilled several holes in my desk to put some grommets using a 7/8"" hole saw bit.  Unfortunately, I realized afterwards that the hole was supposed to be 1"" to fit my grommets.</p>

<p>Then, despite knowing better, I used my 1"" hole saw bit in an attempt to make the holes the correct size.  Although I was able to make the hole larger, the new hole did not come out clean at all.</p>

<p>The obvious solution to this would be to clamp a piece of plywood behind the hole to use as a pilot.  However, the position of the holes make this solution pretty unfeasible - they are in the back of the shelf of a large hutch - i would need to get a very long piece of wood with some huge clamps in order to make that solution work (unless I am missing something):</p>

"Supporting a level box on an uneven surface","<p>I am building some 6' x 2' x 1.5' (depth) cedar planter boxes for specific locations on concrete outdoors. The boxes need to sit as close to the ground as possible, a few inches max.</p>

<p>I am building three of them.</p>

<p>The concrete is neither level nor flat (eyeballing it I would say it's up to a 2-3"" height difference in some places), and throwing down a level concrete pad is not an option.</p>

<p>The challenge is that the boxes will probably each be holding about 1500-1800 lbs of soil. Additionally, they will have little kids climbing all over them, so it's important that they do not wobble and that any supports underneath do not collapse.</p>

<p>The other challenge is they sit against a wall. So I will only have direct access to one side once they are fully built.</p>

<p>Currently the basis for the design is pretty simple. I plan to build a pretty standard floor frame with 2x3 or 2x4 joists every 18""-ish, with the box built on top of it.</p>

<p>But I'm not sure how to build supports to level it. The shape of the ground is very complex and doesn't lend itself well to simple measurements and cuts. Also I don't want to paint myself into a corner and make it impossible to build, I need to construct it in such a way that I don't have to tear the whole thing apart if I don't get it level on the first try.</p>

<p>The boxes don't have to move once they are placed. They will be there until they rot.</p>

<p>How can I do this? How can I build a stable, level support for 1500+ lbs on an uneven concrete surface?</p>

<p>I am thinking about using those adjustable height feet with threaded rod, perhaps 8 of them around the perimeter of the base frame. Then I can level them before placing the box on top when I still have access to all the corners. But I don't have experience with these, and I'm concerned that they may wobble and collapse with sideways force.</p>

<p>I had also thought about cutting 2x4s to the contour of the ground and sitting everything on those. But I don't know how to transfer the ground contours to a cut pattern (Intel has those cool cheap 3D cameras out and I honestly considered grabbing one, but I don't have enough time to wait for one to arrive then develop software to generate contours), and when I run through this idea in my head, I see all sorts of opportunity for frustration.</p>

As <a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/a/801/94"">this answer explained</a>, </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When glue is applied to end-grain, the grain acts as little straws and
  draws a lot of the glue up the wood, away from the joint (similar to
  how the grain draws water up the tree when the tree is alive). In
  these cases, the majority of the glue is pulled away from the joint
  and (without more elaborate joinery techniques) a strong joint cannot
  be achieved, no matter how rough you sand or how tight your clamps
  are.</p>

<p>Is this true for all glues &ndash; even epoxy and CYA?</p>

"How to get better at fitting joints and ""seeing"" bruises?","<p>I'm a beginner.   I'm concentrating on hand-tool joinery for now.  I've watched a lot of YouTube videos, trying to learn joinery.   For the purposes of this question I'm most interested in mortice &amp; tenon joints and dovetail joints.</p>

<p>When fitting a joint it's clearly necessary to remove a little wood where the joint doesn't fit yet.   But, best not to remove wood that doesn't need to be removed since (e.g.) this can make the joint fit more loosely than necessary.</p>

<p>So the basic idea is only to remove the wood that's preventing the joint from fitting.   Often, videos show people making a trial fit and then figuring out where the wood is ""bruised"" in order to deduce what to remove.   But I can't see this bruising on the videos, myself.</p>

<p>At the moment I find tenon fitting seems easier, since I can do a trial fit and then wiggle the part-way-inserted tenon in the mortise to figure out where the tenon pivots; this is the high point and I can remove material from either the mortise or the tenon to make it fit (and the shoulders of the tenon will hide some mistakes in this).   Sometimes, the layout marks may provide a hint as to what to remove, but that's not the case that's interesting to me here (since I already know how to do that).  Anyway, in this way I can more or less fit a mortise and tenon joint without being able to spot the bruising.   </p>

<p>However, with a dovetail joint there are multiple places where the joint could be binding during a test fit, so spotting bruising is, I suspect, more important for dovetails.</p>

<p>So my question really boils down to these specifics:</p>

<ol>
<li>How do I distinguish the wood that must be removed to fit a joint from the wood that should not?</li>
<li>How do I identify where wood is ""bruised""?</li>
</ol>

<p>Pointers to learning materials would be very welcome (i.e. you don't have to explain it all directly in your answer if there are e.g. videos showing how to work on these skills).</p>

"Ripping vs Resawing - is there a reason for the difference?","<p>While I understand the technical difference between ripping a board in two vs resawing a board into thinner boards, is there a technical reason for the distinction?</p>

<p>Granted, thinner pieces of wood will flex more substantially during cuts on a resaw and binding while cutting is a concern, but that's a difference of degree not type, and would remain true when ripping boards into smaller sections as well.</p>

<p>For instance, if I were to saw a 4x4 into two 2x4s, is that operation a rip or a resaw? </p>

<p>It would seem to be more reasonable to label the cut according to it's orientation relative to the grain like we do with the crosscut. Presumably ""quarter-sawing"" perpendicular to a consistent set of rings of alternating density is mechanically distinct from ""rift/plain-sawing"" mostly between the rings, resulting in different stresses on the blade and wood.</p>

<p>Bonus question: Is there research that discusses the differences in these two cutting processes?</p>

<p>I need to connect two 4x4s in a ""T"". (These are one leg and a center / longitudinal support for a long table.)</p>

<p>I decided on a half lap joint since it looked relatively easy to do, but my wife doesn't want to see the back of the joint on the table feet.

<p>However, I'm not sure what the best way is to cut this into the table foot (about 32"" piece of 4x4). My initial attempt on a piece of scrap was to drill a few holes in the corners of the waste area, hit it with the jig saw and chisel out the rest. This works, mostly, but is something of a pain and doesn't get me a smooth surface at the bottom of the cut for the long board to mate with.</p>

"Band saw blade replacement","<p>I am so new to band saws and I want to have a back up for my Ryobi band saw. It uses 62"" blades and that Part I get good. When buying they all say something like 62"" X 1/8 or 3/8"" X 6/14 TPI. The main thing I get confused over is that middle number. If it says 1/8"" or 3/8"" etc. is that how wide the blade is? I am almost certain but not sure. Because what if the 1/8"" means thickness? 3/8"" would be pretty thick so I think that would be width. What is a good general blade width. And what would be a good TPI. I was thinking 6 sounded good, even though 14 would be more fine. But would is the recommended TPI otherwise? I am just doing wood cutting. Last thing is with installing the blade. How much ""flex"" should the blade have when I adjust that tension. I heard you should be able to take your finger and pull the blade back 1/8"". That be all for now.Thanks</p>

"Vise chop thickness?","<p>I'm in the process of making a work bench, mostly following the Nicholson style, and with a vise like <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYldStIreQI"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this one</a>.</p>

"
"Are Oil finishing and Oil polishing complementary?","<p>There seems to exist two different procedures to finish wood with vegetal penetrating oils (raw linseed oil, boiled linseed oil, or pure tung oil). One method consists in letting the oil penetrate into the wood passively using only the power of passing time and a clean cloth, referred to as ""oil finishing"", and the other consists in rubbing/burnishing the oil into the piece <em>ad nauseam</em>, referred to as ""oil polishing"".</p>

<p>I can't find much information on oil polishing in newer/popular texts -- it seems to be more of a historical method. I may not have the nomenclature completely right, as I can't find a new or old text that covers both methods.</p>

<p>Are these two approaches complementary, or should they be perceived as alternatives to one another? What does the extra labour buy you?</p>

<h2>A. Oil finishing</h2>

<p>This is coat-wait-wipe dry-and-repeat approach:</p>

<ol>
<li>cover the work in a generous layer of oil using a soft cloth</li>
<li>wait some amount of time between 10-30m for oil to penetrate</li>
<li>wipe all excess oil with a clean cloth</li>
<li>wait between 24h and 48h depending on environment</li>
<li>repeat (optionally de-nibbing with fine sandpaper or steel wool between coats)</li>
</ol>

<p>Quoting the label at the back of my bottle of BrandX linseed oil:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apply on well sanded wood, concrete or stone that is free of lint, wax or debris. Apply sparingly with a soft cloth or brush. Do NOT apply with a sponge. For more even penetration, dilute with equal parts of BrandX turpentine or BrandX paint thinner. Always wipe off any oil that has not penetrated the surface after half an hour. Wait until the first coat is dry before applying a second coat...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Similar instructions are given for pure tung oil:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>...
  The first coat should be a liberal one, and you can rub it over the wood with your hand, a soft rag, or #000 steel wool (#0000 deteriorates badly). Allow this application to sit for 5 to 10 minutes so the oil can soak in, then remove any excess with a clean, soft rag or steel wool. Check after about a half-hour for any seeping, and rub this off as well. Let dry completely (24 to 48 hours) between coats. For woods with very open pores, allow an extra 24 hours drying time.</p>
  
  <p><em>Source: <a href=""http://www.leevalley.com/en/html/56z1000ie.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">LeeValley tung oil PDF</a></em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This approach also seems to be in line with popular practice (at least of the few who choose oil as a finish). E.g., it is what some spoonmakers <a href=""http://www.mainecoastcraft.com/blog/an-oil-finish-for-hand-carved-wooden-spoons"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">recommend</a>.</p>

<h2>B. Oil Polishing</h2>

<p>Some texts describe a much more laborious process, described as Oil Polishing or Oil-Polishing. It would appear that rubbing (and burnishing) is done with a padded heavy object (like a brick), and continues until the oil has completely penetrated into the wood.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Central to oil polishing is linseed oil, and it should be used in its raw form [...] The oil is heated by placing it in a container  and standing it in a bowl of hot water which can be frequently renewed. Warm oil will flow much more easily. Assuming that the wood is smooth and clean, a generous film of oil is applied, using a broad brush. The rubbing is done with a soft felt wrapped round a brick, and working from area to area. The first coat will rapidly soak into the wood. [...] </p>
  
  <p>The end of each phase is marked by the disappearance of the oil. The first coat will not provide a mere hint of polish, but if the operation is repeated some results can be expected.</p>
  
  <p>Depending on the condition of the wood the results will definitely appear after the fourth coat, and it will be marked by sweat points as saturation point is reached. These sweat marks should be removed with a rag soaked in methylated spirit, the use of which will not impair the final finish because it rapidly evaporates.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Oil-polishing is most useful for table tops, bar tables, counters and spirit cabinets. A dining-room table with an oil-polished top, and the sides and legs French polished, will make a most satisfactory job. [...]</p>
  
  <p>For a table-top or other surface which is large and level, rub some of the oil well into it, and then polish with a rubber made by rubbing a quantity of felt or flannel round a brick or other suitable block. [...] In applying the oil, do not saturate or flood it, but scrub it in, and afterwards rub long and hard. Of course the wood will absorb the oil, even after several applications. It will need much patience to bring it up to a good glow; in fact it might be said that the work is never finished.</p>

"Lacquer brush marks, and dullness, on wood surface - what to do?","<p>I looked around and didn't see an answer to this question. I have a wood door on my house that was looking a little dull. It had been finished at the factory with a black stain-lacquer combination. I thought I'd be smart and ""clean"" it up a bit after 10 years of sun damage, so I bought the right can of stain-lacquer and tried applying it with a brush. The results look pretty poor and I'm afraid to touch it again. I talked to a paint professional about fixing my mess, but he wasn't interested. </p>

<p>What can I do about this? I thought about trying to gently apply some lacquer thinner with a cotton cloth and just slowly rubbing it down until I'm back to the original state of the door, but I'm not sure of that will work. My understanding is that lacquer (and lacquer thinner). </p>

<p>The other thing I thought of was mixing the stain with lacquer thinner and (again) trying to apply a coat or two. But given the prior results, I'm very concerned about this. </p>

I have a small box/basket that I'd like to have in my kitchen to hold cooking oils.  Since the bottles will likely leak cooking oil, I'd like to treat the wood with an epoxy resin, so that it will be durable and more easily cleaned.  And, it case it's not clear, by epoxy resin I mean a material similar to what's used to finish bar tops.  Anyway, all of the resources I see on using epoxy resin cover finishing the top and sides of the piece.  Basically, we pour and spread the resin on the top and it runs over the side.  What's not clear to me is what to use on the bottom of the piece.  Can we use the epoxy resin on the bottom as well?  If so, it's not clear to me how to accomplish this.  Every piece I've seen has drips from the epoxy along the bottom.  I suppose we could sand these drips down, but then we'll have the same issue when we flip over the piece and treat the bottom.  Certainly, I could use a different product on the bottom, but I'd rather just use the same durable finish on all sides.  Is there a good way to accomplish this?</p>

I've seen dust bags like the one from harbor freight, but it's not accessible in their stores and they say it's only for their table saw.

"""T"" joint with MDFâNo power tools","<p>Disclaimer: I'm a complete newbie when it comes to woodworking so I apologize if I don't use good woodworking vocabulary.</p>

<p>I'm hoping to build a small hutch/monitor stand for my desk out of MDF. I'm choosing to go with 3/4"" MDF because I'm a poor college student and want to go as cheap as possible. So far I've gathered that MDF and screws don't really get along and that I can use box joints for joining ends. I'm wondering if there is a good way to join two pieces of MDF in a ""T"" shape, like this:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/s9oSp.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/s9oSp.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>I'm trying to avoid using any kind of hardware or joinery that takes up space below or above the ""shelf"" in the image: I need to slide an object on my desk onto the shelf and it will fit exactly.</p>

<p>I also don't have any power tools besides a circular saw and a power drill, so I can't cut holes for biscuits. I want each joint to be sturdy, but also aesthetically pleasing (I want my wife's support in future projects so I don't want it to look like some scraps were just slapped together).</p>

<p>I saw a joinery method called a ""dado"", and was thinking that this might work:</p>

<p><strong>If this is a viable option</strong>, how deep should I cut the groove? The MDF is only 3/4"" thick. How would I cut a blind dado (as shown in the image above) with hand tools?</p>

<p><strong>If this is not a good option</strong>, why not? Are there any other methods I can use for a discrete but strong joint that can be implemented with hand tools?</p>

"PVC duct for dust collection: Glue the pipe and fittings together, or will tape suffice?","<p>I am currently installing PVC pipe to act as duct for my dust collector. There will be a central pipe down the length of my shop, with a few branches coming off for specific tools.</p>

<p>So far, I've hung some pipe and connected it together with PVC fittings. I had planned to get it all loosely fitted together, and then go back through and glue it together with PVC glue and primer. But as I've pushed a few fittings together, I started to question whether I need the glue. It occurs to me there are some advantages to leaving it only loosely connected. If I should ever have clog, it'll be a lot easier to unclog if I don't have to cut the pipe apart. Ditto if I ever want to add branches.</p>

"Are there any serious and non-obvious disadvantages to thermally modified wood?","<p>A local wood trader has shown me some thermally modifid ash planks (never seen that before!) with a stunning coloring that almost seduced me to immediately buy a table and two benches worth of it and build some new massive garden furniture.</p>

<p>Now, the wood is <em>thermally modified</em>. Which basically means it went into a kiln at a somewhat higher temperature and underwent a heat-induced chemical reaction. I had never seen such a wood (if you can still call it that) before. It's apparently a rather new thing (less than 20 years old) too.  </p>

<p>From what I could gather from various (partially contradicting) sources, this means:</p>

<ul>
<li>Greatly improved resistance to fungi and parasites, suitable for outdoor</li>
<li>Even woods like beech and oregon pine are resistance class 1-2 after treatment</li>
<li>Best invention since the invention of the wheel</li>
<li>Wood almost doesn't work any more (50-75% reduction in shrinkage/growth, nearly no water uptake)</li>
<li>No treatment needed</li>
<li>Treatment recommended (... OK?)</li>
<li>Varnish needed, oiling before varnish recommended to give the wood back its elasticity (how would that work???)</li>
<li>Insufficient data for close-to-earth placement, might not be good (WTF?)</li>
<li>Darker color (very obvious, and good looking, main reason to buy!)</li>
<li>Harder, but somewhat more brittle</li>
<li>Need to pre-drill big screws (Wow, I wouldn't have guessed that!)</li>
<li>Not recommended to have too sharp edges in the open (Again, wow, what an insight!)</li>
<li>Slightly less stable (slightly? how much?), not suitable for construction (why not, if it's just <em>slightly</em> weaker?)</li>
<li>Glue might take up to 10 times as long to dry (... but, will it <em>hold</em>?)</li>
</ul>

<p>So, what does that mean in summary? And does one of you maybe have experience working with that and can confirm or deny any of the above?</p>

<p>For example, when someone tells me ""hard and brittle"", I come to think of mineral substances. As in, giving that ultra-fine dust that causes lung cancer when being worked. Not exactly what I'd like.<br>
When someone tells me ""controlled, partial combustion, chemical change"", I come to think of ""easily flammable"" and ""unknown evaporations"".</p>

"Tung oil stain resistance","<p><strong>What I've done:</strong></p>

<p>Made a small plate out of hard maple. Sanded it down to 220 grit sandpaper. Finished with pure tung oil (100%, not the big box stuff) over the course of about a week, giving four coats. Let sit for two weeks inside (under fan, about 70 degrees), until it no longer 'smelled' like tung oil and there was no more seepage. </p>

<p>I wanted to see how resistant to food stains the plate was. Against cold/room temperature stuff it seemed to laugh it off - sriracha, pasta sauce, wine, etc. But when I put some warm curry powder/water paste on it and let it sit as long as the others, I had a giant bright yellow stain and the wood had roughed up a bit from me trying (and successfully) scrubbing the stain out with warm water + gentle soap. </p>

<p><strong>What I'd like to know is:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Would tung oil normally stand up to that kind of thing? Will it keep resisting stains if the food put on it is warm/hot (up to 140 degrees)? Or did I just not 'cure' the plate long enough?</li>
<li>If tung oil really isn't going to protect the plate from anything warm/hot, is there anything out there that will and is a ""natural"" product? Don't laugh here - I've got a lot of people asking about food safe finishes, and the only one that I've found so far that all the ""internet experts"" seem to agree on is tung oil, as most other finishes can chip off into food or don't protect well enough. I need it to meet the ""can't chip"" and ""after curing is non-toxic"" criteria. </li>

"Repurpose solid beech flooring","<p>I potentially have a large amount of solid beech flooring 20mm thick, 85mm wide and various lengths. I'd like to repurpose some of it to make a work bench entirely from the beech.</p>

<p>I'm inexperienced in wood working generally, but want to experiment a bit, and would like to know if the following are possible/realistic:</p>

<p>1) Can I glue the slats together and make suitable strong table legs and other structural parts, e.g. 80x80x900.</p>

<p>2) If I then cut mortise/tenons in there, will they then be strong enough, or will the wood break up?</p>

<p>3) For the bench top I have considered either joining the slats horizontally with two layers to produce a 40mm thick top, or putting the slats on their side to produce an 80mm top.</p>

<p>4) If I can't find long enough pieces to make the table top, and instead make the top up using overlapping shorter pieces, will that make a strong enough table top?</p>

<p>Sorry if these are very basic questions.</p>

"Repair / Restore Veneer Covered Table","<p><strong>Context:</strong> </p>

<li>An unidentified but glossy coating (might be varnish or wax?)</li>

"how to re-adhere veneer before refinishing","<p>I am going to refinish my late 1940s kitched cabinets, but first I need to repair some of the veneer. In some places the veneer is badly damaged, broken, missing. In these areas I removing sections and patching.</p>

<p>But in other sections, as below, the veneer is peeling off of the surface but it has not yet fallen off (the dado is for a shelf). So my question is, what is the best way to fix this? I have some tiny glue syringes which I could use to get some glue behind the veneer, but then I will have to clamp it, and there is going to be a lot of excess glue. Maybe contact cement? Is there any chance that I could use a wallpaper steamer to gently peel back the veneer and reapply  with contact cement? Any other ideas? </p>

"What solids content does a hardwearing wood / floor stain need to have?","<p>I have read that for paint the solids content indicates something about the quality of the paint in the sense that higher solids probably means fewer coats required.</p>

<p>Is this also the case for stains? Since stains are intended to be translucent I could imagine that the solids content could correlate with the darkness of the color, for instance, and have nothing to do with how well the finish will wear or age.</p>

<p>As an example, the Bona Drifast <a href=""https://www.bona.com/Global/Documents/United%20States/Technical%20Data%20Sheets/TDS%20Bona%20DriFast%20Stain%20-%20Classic%20US.pdf?epslanguage=en"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">technical data sheet</a> says: <code>Solids â 35-47%</code></p>

<p>Aassuming the solids content <em>is</em> a measure of quality, what's a reasonable minimum value to have confidence the stain will hold up over time (say, 10-20 years)? </p>

<p>(All else being equal... obviously there are other factors which influence finish robustness as well.)</p>

"Cutting rabbets with a table saw against the fence","<p>I'm <strong>very</strong> new to woodworking (I've only just started out in an online course), and I've been trying my best to educate myself on safe practices. Recently, I've been thinking about how rabbets are cut on the table saw with a dado stack. Having never used a table saw, I've been looking around online to see how it's done.</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbS0-nSCrzo"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">This helpful video</a> has some interesting tips, particularly about cutting the rabbet against a sacrificial fence. My primary question is how you handle rabbets that are ultimately wider than the stack can accommodate in one pass.</p>

<p>As an example, suppose that I want to cut a rabbet that's 3/4 of an inch in width (to accept a 3/4 inch wide piece of plywood). Some small job-site table saws can only accommodate a narrow dado stack, due to a short arbor length. For this example, assume the dado stack is only 3/8 of an inch wide.</p>

<p>How would the rabbet in this situation be cut? Would the first pass be against a sacrificial fence, cutting the outermost edge away first, followed by moving the fence away from the blade to make the second pass?</p>

<p>Essentially, how do you safely cut a wider rabbet (or dado) than the dado stack can physically go? I want to avoid kickback as much as I can.</p>

"Tips for reducing sandpaper loading on drum sander","<p>So I got a great deal on a used 25"" Performax drum sander this past weekend.  It needs a little repair - specifically, one of the drums needs to be replaced.  But it works fine as a single drum unit until I get around to it.</p>

<p>Anyway, I decided to try it out on a Ponderosa pine slab that I have around.  About 15"" wide by 3' long and maybe 2"" thick.  I've had this in my shop in bone-dry Colorado (summer humidity can reach the single digits) for about 9 months.  Not sure how long the sawyer had it, but it was stored inside, stacked &amp; stickered, when I bought it and was from timber dead at least 5 years (forest fire salvage).  Felt dry then.</p>

<p>Anyway, I was taking light passes - about 1/8 of a turn.  Don't know what that comes to in inches.  And slow feeds.  But the paper loaded up like crazy, particularly over knots.  The 80 grit that was on it succumbed quickly.  Swapped it for some new 60 grit Al oxide, and that only lasted for about 6-8 passes as well.</p>

<p>I tried using one of those rubber sand paper cleaning sticks between passes - and a wire brush when it started getting bad.  I'm running dust collection on it.</p>

<p>Any ideas?  Maybe a heavier grit for roughing it in?  Or is this just what I should expect with a resin heavy wood like Ponderosa knots?

<p>The red wall cannot bear any weight, but he other wall is concrete.
I would like to avoid turning the bed (so that the pillar can be fastened to the bearing wall) because this would take away the space for a desk.
My plan is to just make the pillar fit exactly the height of the room so that it locks in (split it in two pieces, a main tall one and a smaller top that I can slide in), basically leaving no room for the pillar to tip.
I am counting on this being able to sustain any weight and pulling I might stress on the far end of the crossbeam, since the ceiling is also concrete.
I would also run a cable from the joint between the pillar and the  crossbeam toward the concrete wall, to put some tension and fasten everything together in that direction.
I am planning to use 15x15cm massive wood for pillar and crossbeam.</p>

<p>This is my very first own wood project
- Do you seen any flaws in the plan?
- Do you have improvements?
If you think it can work
- What kind of joint would you make between the pillar and crossbeam? I simply plan to cut out 5cm out of each and insert them into each other, the the bolt for the cable would fasten them together but would not need to bear any weight.</p>

"Carved kuksa of ash wood has split and oozed water, what has gone wrong?","<p>I hand-carved my first Kuksa a month ago from half an ash log. I worked with semi-dry wood (definitely not green, but still wet). I used axe, Japanese gouge and knife and all went well. The bowl is not too thick either. </p>

<p>So I let it dry in a plastic bag opened in the bowl and after some (short) drying I put linseed oil on it and let it dry more. I was quite surprised because it was absorbing so much linseed oil. A bit like a sponge... After two weeks of drying and the final application of a mixture of beeswax with linseed oil and some more drying I tested it with some warm tea. </p>

<p>To my disappointment I got a lot of linseed oil floating in my bowl. Then I let the tea in the bowl for some time, to see how it holds. In very little time tea began to ooze from the pores on the outside of the bowl in the faces that were cut across the grain. Then the bottom which was getting wet from this has split.</p>

<p>So I guess my mistake has been to not let the wood dry out completely before oiling and that the oil somehow has caused the wood to contract, somehow keeping the pores open.</p>

<p>Am I guessing right? Or is the ash really spongy like this and not suitable for bowls? Or have I overlooked something. Sorry I'm only starting with bowl carving...</p>

"Shellac over paint, outdoors","<p>I am making something for outdoor use and I've painted it with a matte exterior latex paint. I'm satisfied with the protection that the paint will offer but I'm experimenting with ways to make it look nicer.</p>

<p>Right now I am considering glossy finishes. I have found that I much prefer the appearance and texture of shellac (de-waxed) to a high gloss spar urethane.</p>

<p>I don't really need good scratch resistance for this particular piece, and the paint should protect the wood enough from moisture and sunlight.</p>

<p>I'm also not too concerned about color changes over time as long as it is uniform. The paint is just brown, and maintaining the precise brown isn't super important.</p>

<p>My question is, how should I expect a fairly thick shellac finish (over paint) to behave outdoors over time? It will be exposed to sunlight, a wide range of temperatures, and plenty of rain, snow, and ice. Should I expect flaking? Spotting? Blemishes (I've heard it gets cloudy with moisture)? Other weird stuff? Or will it maintain its nice appearance? If it does get grimy, will it be prone to staining (with polyurethane a good wipe down with an all purpose cleaner takes care of it)? </p>

"Shelf movement in a plywood bookcase","<p>I'm building some 7' by 3' bookcases with mix of plywood and solid oak for the sides and back (mostly plywood), but full solid oak shelving for strength. I'm worried that the ~9"" depth to the shelves will allow up to about 1/8"" of movement. If I used the online formula correctly. Since the sides and shelves are constructed so differently, and will thus move differently, I'm assuming I can't just secure the fixed shelves to the sides and back.</p>

<p>My primary question is: am I right about the movement, and if so, is it sufficient to place the fixed shelves in a dado and only glue the front couple inches? (I want the front of the fixed shelves to look solidly attached throughout the year.) Secondarily, can I ""hide"" the movement at the back, for instance by running a 1/4"" dado and only insert the first 1/8"" inch during construction (it's winter, so it's probably near my low humidity point)? I didn't plan quite far enough ahead to select my boards for grain direction, so I'm assuming the worst.</p>

<p>Here's a rough look at my design, for reference; green is plywood, and the rest is solid. The topmost and bottom visible shelf, as well as one not visible near the very bottom are the fixed shelves I'm asking about attaching. (The rest of the shelves will be adjustable, so I just need to allow room for their largest size, and accept some gap.)</p>

<p>Am I correct? (As in, is my Sketchup wrong, and the bottom-most board should be rotate 90 degrees?)</p>

<li>Your belt sander has holes to mount it to something else.</li>

"Is it important to minimize volume of duct in a dust collection system?","<p><strong>Edited To Add:</strong></p>

<p>The main thing I am asking here is whether it is beneficial to have blast gates that close off as much of the unused dust collection branches as possible. I will already have blast gates closed at the tools at the end of every branch. Is it beneficial to also have a blast gate that closes off an entire unused branch at the point it branches? I'd be closing off about 20 feet of 4"" PVC duct. If it will improve performance of the dust collector, is it something where I'll really see a noticeable improvement in dust collection at the tool being used, or is it just a few percent that I probably won't really notice? </p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Original question:</strong></p>

<p>I built some blast gates to put on the main branches of my dust collection system. My goal was to close off the entire volume of that branch so the dust collector doesn't have to evacuate its air when I'm trying to use a tool on a different branch. However, I've run into a problem. Long story short, at the location I'd intended to install at one of the blast gates, there is a conduit blocking the path of the gate. I wouldn't be able to close it. </p>

<p>I have some ideas on how I might fix this. I can use a different style of blast gate, or I might be able to scoot the whole main branch over. However, before I go to that trouble, I'm wondering how important these gates actually are. My dust collection has three main branches (simplified for the purpose of this question): the Radial Arm Saw Branch, the Planer Branch, and the duct to the dust collector. My plan was to be able to close off the entire Radial Arm Saw Branch and the entire Planer Branch when those branches aren't in use. One way to fix this is, instead of closing off the entire branch, I could put the gates at the tools themselves. </p>

<p>My gut tells me it won't work as well. If I close off the entire branch, it will be a smaller volume of space for the dust collector to evacuate. But I'm not sure about this. Maybe if the tools on that branch are closed off, it won't really be much more work because no air will be moving along that duct?</p>

<p><strong>Will closing off as much of the unused branches as possible make the dust collector do its job better and collect more dust from the tool that is open?</strong> If so, will it be by a noticeable amount? Or will it mostly not matter as long as the branch is closed off at the end?</p>

<hr>

<p>Here's a diagram of my duct and where I planned on putting the gates. Instead of putting them here, I could just move them closer to the tools.</p>

"Is it appropriate for an 8 year-old to act as a 'helper,' ripping sheets on a table saw?","<p>Serious question. I know of a child who at eight years old was instructed to help the operator of a table saw guide large (8 X 4 foot) plywood sheets through it. Neither operator nor child were wearing any safety equipment, such as eye protection. Child has no previous experience operating power equipment and very limited experience with woodworking. Table saw is over 20 years old, and it is unclear what safety features it has, if any. Operator believes this was safe and appropriate, because child was holding edge of plywood furthest from the blade.</p>

<p>What does the community here think? Is there ever an occasion in which a young child should be allowed to help with a table saw in such a manner? What could go wrong?</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: Operator has provided the below diagram and photo to support the idea that this was safe and appropriate. Could you also provide specific feedback based on this? It's not certain the representation is accurate, but let's assume it is.</p>

<p><strong>Edit 2</strong>: Operator has stated that he enlisted child because he could not perform the job alone, specifically because he needed someone to hold the plywood ""so that it would not bind the table saw blade."" Also that child did not want to help, because he was scared, but operator made him help anyway.</p>

<p><strong>Edit 3</strong>: It sounds like context is pretty important here, specifically how much one can trust the operator to do the right thing. I've tried to avoid biasing the question by mentioning for example that the child is my own, or that the operator had also recently poured gasoline on an open fire (which resulted in the can itself catching fire as well as a secondary fire), or that the operator keeps insisting these are both perfectly safe and appropriate. But it sounds like it's not possible to separate the judgment of the operator from this question.</p>

My idea was to glue 2 or 3 layers of marine grade plywood together and have a CNC machine mill them.

"Can all whetstones be cleaned?","<p>I got a new (new to me, appears very old) whetstone today, and was told generally how to use it. I need to sharpen my son's knife, who at 9 years old has much more woodworking (whittling) experience than I. </p>

<p>My question is, because I don't know the history or source of the whetstone in question, can I still clean it the same as I might any others, without detriment to the stone or to the blade?</p>

<p>I am trying to learn as much as I can about sharpening so I don't ruin my son's blade, or worse his experience. I learn from various sources (including <a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/a/4144"">https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/a/4144</a>) that I should clean a whetstone so that it can function correctly. With all the many ways I can mess up his blade by sharpening poorly, I want to at least make sure the tool I am using is performing adequately. </p>

<p>I read that some are dry only, others are water only, others are oil only (the stone in question was treated with gun oil to demonstrate prior to me receiving it), and so I am concerned that dish detergent may not be best for all whetstones. On the other hand, I am not clear on what results of suboptimal whetstone cleaning might actually have on the ability of the tool to function properly, or on the knife itself, if any. </p>

"How often should I sharpen?","<p>I find many different suggestions for length of time between sharpening, from before and after every whittling session to once every 2-3 years.

<p>Is it possible to quantify how often I should sharpen a whittling knife?</p>

<p>I realize the best answer is, 'when it feels dull', but my 9 year old son is doing the whittling and is not yet experienced enough to know the difference. Sharpening is my job, but I don't have any woodworking experience. </p>

<p>Is it possible to say a certain number of days/months/years, a certain number of minutes/hours of actual woodworking, an approximate number of strokes in the wood, certain number of projects or times per project, a table or multiplier by wood type for increasing or decreasing the sharpening frequency, or some other measuring guideline?</p>

"What is the minimal spacing between edge of leg pommel and mortise and tenon apron (intersected by tusk tenon)","<p>I would like to balance aesthetics and strength for a craftsman-style tusked tenon table frame. Are there rules of thumb to determine how close to the leg corner an apron should be?</p>

<p>(as a preamble, I should mention I'm working with construction grade lumber)</p>

<p><strong>A tenon within a tenon</strong></p>

<p>The particular construction I'm shooting for has one tenon passing through another tenon. And I feel this might require larger margins around mortises to prevent splitting failures in the leg's pommel (i.e. the upper part).</p>

<p>For a visual reference, I am trying to lay out the mortises in the piece (D) from the following picture, and I would like to know how to pick safe lengths for X, Y, Z (in green):</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Kw4qW.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Kw4qW.jpg"" alt=""leg assembly""></a></p>

<p>For assembling, piece (C) goes through the leg first, intersected by the other tenon piece (B), and finally locked in with one tusk on each leg. I am planning on chamfering the part of (C) which protrudes on the outer side of the leg.</p>

<p>My personal opinion is that it looks best if the mortises are off-center relative to the leg, closest to the outermost corner of the leg.</p>

<p><strong>Additional details on the objective</strong></p>

<p>The assembly plan above is accompanied with a FRONT+SIDE view diagram where all mortises appear to go through the center (i.e. not offset), as well as a picture where they clearly are offset. Those discrepancies and oversights seem to be par for the course in most of the project-books I've looked at this far. Is this only a matter of personal taste?</p>

<p>I'm trying to to something like the plan, without the lower shelf. In the absence of the shelf and lower rail, the ""meat"" (Z) between the top of the leg and the top of the mortises becomes more important. I'm doing this in thick pine stock (aprons are long 1.5""x3.5"", and legs are roughly 3""x3"").</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/S8frgm.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/S8frgm.jpg"" alt=""front and side views""></a>

<p>Most other table plans I've seen place the outside face of the aprons very close, maybe 1/8"", from the leg's corner (which places the mortises a third of the stock further inwards). But that might be a safe layout only for a hardwood leg. I can't assess from my limited experience.</p>

"Wood movement with L-shaped mitred leaning shelf","<p>I'm doing a built-in for a closet. The closet is over the stairs so its front is sloped. I created an L shaped front and shelf from solid maple. The bottom foot or so is up against the wall that I can screw into. The top surface is hovering, supported by the miter (in the photo there is another shelf sitting on it).</p>

<p>I originally envisioned that the lower shelf would rest on the sloped wall. It currently is but that may change in the summer.</p>

<p>All the fronts are 1.5"" thick. The shelves are 3/4"" thick.</p>

<p>The front is mitered along its top edge and joins the shelf. I used two small pins on the very edges and just glue in between for the miter.</p>

<p>On the underside, I reinforced the miter (with two square 3""x3""x3/4"" pieces at 90 degrees near the sides, plus a long narrower 3'x1""x3/4"" piece of pine in between along most of the length of the miter, glued to the top and the front faces).</p>

<p>The problem I'm not sure how wood movement will affect this structure.</p>

<p>The main front will surely expand by at least 1/2"", more than the shelf will expand inwards. This will cause the shelf to hover. With all the other stuff on top of it, I'm afraid the miter will fail.</p>

<p>I thought about attaching the shelf to the front face on the underside with a larger brace, corner, or even metal strip (going 45 between them). But I'm afraid due to the difference in contraction/expansion, the brace itself will force the faces into each other, breaking the miter.</p>

<p>I'm concerned about attached the shelf to the walls for that reason.</p>

<p>So my question is, is my best bet to go with the flow and just reinforce that miter say with smaller metal brackets (so there is less force from the front's expansion). That way the entire structure will rise as one.</p>

<p>Or should I fight the expansion? For example, I can create 45 degree blocking along the outer edges on the underside of the front. I could then screw those into the wall and screw the front panel into the blocking. That way the front panel will be attached in all four corners</p>

<p>I could also attach the sides that the upper shelf will rest on. If the sides are screwed into the wall, the front face will butt up against them. Would that prevent the front face from moving up? Would the wood bow or warp because the sides are being blocked but the center of the front panel if free to move up?</p>

<p>Additional idea I had was to actually create a 1/2 gap between the bottom part and the top part. The top part can be attached to the walls. Not sure I love this visually. Maybe there's a way to conceal the gap?</p>

<p>Wondering if anyone's done anything similar or has any advice.</p>

How do we attach the wood to the steel in such a way where expansion isn't a problem?

"pine panels with minor cupping suitable for dovetails?","<p>I have these 9â-wide, 3/4â-thick pine panels from the bigbox store that i would like to make into a carcass with dovetails.</p>

<p>Such panels commonly exhibit some cupping, but have some spring into them, and can typically be flattened with clamp pressure.</p>

<p>Would they stay flat once joined with dovetails? or does stock need to be absolutely flat from the start?</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/q9VE6m.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/q9VE6m.jpg"" alt=""three panels with edge grain up""></a></p>

<p><em>Photo shows three panels with varying amounts of cupping. A second clamp, if placed in the center, makes them flat again.</em></p>

<h1>Follow-up:</h1>

<p>I gave it a go with the panels, based on feedback here. And it's totally fine, plus or minus some adjustments. This was my first attempt at dovetails. Here's a few things I'd not realized until I had to actually do it.</p>

<p>0) A bit more planning on my part would have revealed that the pin board (which was a glue-up panel) also had some cupping in it. So I had to clamp the <em>two</em> boards flat simultaneously while scribing my pin board on the tail board, which did complicate the clamping and marking situation. The tail board was clamped flat with a vise (a workmate), and I was holding the pin board vertically, with a 2x4 clamped on the piece to keep the pin board straight.</p>

<p>1) Depending on the level of cupping in the grain of the tail board, you end up with somewhat weak tail corners. I unfortunately didn't pay attention to that when I did the layout. I designed pins first, but didn't double check where the pins landed before committing to their final shape. I also should have pared more carefully around these fragile corners.</p>

<em>Photo shows two broken tail corners, right on the growth line. I tried glue, but it broke once more in a different spot, then I just accepted my mistake.</em></p>

<p>2) I put the heartside facing outwards of the box, as was recommended. But I still ended up with a minute gap. I've shone light through the gap here. There is some spring still in it and it won't rest at the bottom without pressure -- maybe my joint can be cleaned up a bit more. I feel it will probably vanish, with clamps and glue-up.</p>

"Solid wood furniture faces expand at different rates?","<p>I'm a ""weekend woodworker"" (boxes, small shelves/cabinets, stuff like that).
Now I'm thinking about replacing one of my wardrobes, and was thinking about doing it myself. The problem is: in Romania, solid wood is actually cheaper than processed wood (MDF, plywood, etc) with veneer faces (because I want an overall natural wood look).</p>

<p>My question is (I didn't find anything concrete searching here or on the internet):</p>

<p>When making solid wood furniture, do I need to worry about the wood cracking because the different faces expand at different rates through-out the year?</p>

<p>More explicitly, if the sides, top, and bottom planks/faces will be screwed to each other, will the planks expand/shrink at different rates, thus making the wood susceptible to cracking at the screws? They, of course, will be from the same type of lumber, with the backing from plywood. But even so, I'm worried one of the planks will expand more/less than the adjacent ones and put a strain on the screws.</p>

<p>I'm thinking about making it either from oak or more possibly walnut, 2m (6.5 ft) height, 1m (3.2ft) width with divider in the middle, and 0.7m (2.3ft) depth. So the faces/planks will be about 2*0.7m (6.5*2.3ft).</p>

<p>Any info/hint you can give me will be much appreciated.</p>

<p>EDIT: Since I am clearly misunderstood: if the grains are running in the same direction, will any of the faces expand more/less than the faces next to it, thus cracking the wood?</p>

<p>EDIT2: would it be better if I made my own boards/planks from quartersawn lumber (I can easily get it in 1.8*1.8cm (0.7*0.7in)) with each piece turned 90 deg cw (thus making the grain in each plank run in all directions, which if I understand correctly, will make it more dimensionally stable)? Or would that just be even worse? (elbow grease and tools are not a problem.

<p>He had his students actually practice dig-ins with the safety centers to see what causes the dig-in and to change future behavior to avoid them. The dig-in with the safety center causes the piece to stop turning (with adjustable ""cut-offs""), which is different than what you would see with a spur drive. It seems like a good way to learn. </p>

<p>I do have a question on its use. I know the tension of the pin can be adjusted via the hole on the side of the drive. Do I want any portion of the pin exposed between the cup on the end of the drive and the wood? Or do I always want to tighten the tailstock (which has a live center) such that the cup of the safety center in the headstock presses flush against the end of the wooden piece? </p>

"Eclipse style honing guide changing blade geometry & preventing tight mouth setting on planes","<p>I find it much easier to get repeatable sharpening results with a honing guide, but I have noticed that the plane blades I sharpen with my Eclipse style guide are ending up with a different geometry than I want, and it is preventing me closing the mouth on my smoothing plane very tightly.</p>

<p>When looking at the blade from above, the angle between the edge to the long sides is changing, so that the edge is developing a skew. My theory is that this happens because the blade tapers in width measurably along its length (<strong>EDIT</strong>: approximately 1/16"" over its length), and also because the right jaw on the honing guide is flat and the left is curved. This inherently presents the blade to the stone at a skew to its long axis.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Zzk63.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Zzk63.jpg"" alt=""Depiction of how tapered blade and sharpening guide geometry conspire to change blade geometry""></a></p>

<p>I suppose it is also possible that this is because I am right handed, so maybe I am bearing down harder on the right of the blade without noticing, but the geometry involved seems very suspicious.</p>

<p>The reason this is a problem is that even with the correct lateral adjustment, there's a point where the blade is slightly skewed in the mouth and the mouth can't be closed as much as is recommended on smoothing planes, because one side of the blade is just plain further forward than the other. It also makes it difficult to set the cap iron because then the cap iron needs to be at an angle to the blade's long axis and can interfere with the sides of the plane.</p>

<p>How do other people deal with this issue? Is there something weird with what I'm doing?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: This is an old Stanley plane blade that is doing this. I compared it to a new retail Stanley plane blade &amp; the new one DOES NOT have a noticeable taper along its length. Did blades change from tapered to untapered at some point? Do I just have a weird blade? It came from eBay.</p>

<p>I also have a Kell honing guide -- but the jaws are both parallel so I'm not sure that would help much, and it seems like it would be a less secure clamp on a tapered blade.</p>

"Lathes and cutting machines: sharpness versus hardness","<p>As a primary school student I took woodworking classes and recall the teacher sharpening the gouges and chisels that we used on the lathe. I use the word <em>sharpening</em> but that is, perhaps an assumption. He ground and polished the cutting edges of the tools.</p>

<p>Years later in the workshop of a university department, I asked the instrument maker how sharp the cutting tools on the metal lathe needed to be. He said that he thought that hardness, not sharpness, was really the issue with metal lathe cutters, and then simply assumed that I fully understood what I'd been told.</p>

<p>And then yesterday, using a pair of old hair clippers, I caught myself wondering whether they needed sharpening, which reminded me once more of the sharp vs. hard distinction which I never did investigate.
Does it make sense to talk about wood-lathe tools as being sharp as distinct from being hard, and vice versa for metal lathe tools? I can think of all sorts of ways in which wood is not like metal (!) but what are the differences that lead to qualitatively (as opposed to quantitatively) different characteristics of the cutting tools? ... and do hair-clippers get sharpened, or does the hardness of the steel versus the softness of hair solve all problems?</p>

<p>I received it today and, after I'd broken down and disposed of all the packaging, I noticed what looks like curvature in the mirrored surface of its platen, sort of like a dent in shiny car paint. Sure enough, I could feel some ""waviness"" when I ran my hand over it, and a second check with a level confirmed that one quadrant of the surface has a small hill that rises up to maybe 1/32"" - 1/16"" higher than the rest. The remainder is very flat.</p>

<p>Will this cause any difficulty in achieving good results? Or is there anything I'm not aware of about how a planer works that implies that this might not cause problems? On this model, the platen appears to be made of sheet steel that attaches to a cast aluminum base beneath it, so maybe the sheet steel has enough give that it will flatten against the pressure of the outfeed roller on the material? When I press down on the platen, it does give slightly and appears to flatten out onto the surface of the base beneath it (the flat section of the platen doesn't have any give to it, but this ""bubble"" does). Maybe the material will do the same?</p>

<p>I bought it brand new from a factory-authorized online retailer, so exchanging it is certainly an option (I've already emailed them), but it will be a pain. I can try it out and use the factory warranty if needed, or ask for a replacement base, but the platen and base are sold as a complete unit and do not appear to be user-serviceable so I doubt the latter is a viable option.</p>

"Using scrapers on ""fuzzy"" woods","<p>Just started using scrapers and I love them. I was looking for questions and thought I would look around the concept of pitfalls and <a href=""http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/common-woodworking-pitfalls-and-how-to-avoid-them.html"" rel=""nofollow"">I read this paragraph in regards to sanding</a>: </p>

<blockquote>
  <h1>Sanding that makes the wood fuzzy</h1>
  
  <p>Some woods, such as birch, get fuzzy when you sand them too much. The fibers of the wood tear and create hairlike fuzz on the surface of the wood. You don't want to stain or topcoat wood in that condition.</p>
  
  <p>If your wood does get fuzzy, go down a grit or two with the sandpaper (120-grit is a good place to start) and sand out the little furs. The way to avoid fuzzy wood is to make sure you don't sand with a paper finer than 150 grit. <strong>And don't use a scraper either</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That final emphasis is mine. I get that sanding can create fuzz due to tearing. That makes sense. Scrapers are supposed to avoid that by slicing the wood instead of gouging it. Why say don't use scrapers then? Are you not suppose to use scrapers on ""fuzzy"" wood? </p>

<p>I never use dummies.com as a solid information resource so if the information there is wrong I won't be surprised. I feel that sentence is misguided or needs to be embellished.</p>

"Mortise and tenon joint proportions for 3 wooden beams corner","<p>I'm designing a cabinet with drawers and I would like to use 60mm (roughly 2 and 3/8"") wide beams for the frame. The frame with one side panel visible looks like that:</p>

<p><img src=""https://cl.ly/3F0A2a1c0L2Z/Image%202016-04-09%20at%2010.21.56%20am.png"" alt=""cabinet frame""></p>

<p>I would like to use mortise and tenon joints as they seem like a simplest solution and are relatively easy to cut. The problem is I'm not sure how to size them. You can find multiple rules for such joints in the internet, one of them being (this is from Christopher Schwarz):</p>

<ul>
<li>tenon's thickness should be one third the thickness of the stock being mortised</li>
<li>tenon's length should be 5 times its thickness</li>
<li>tenon's width should be half the width of the stock you're cutting it in</li>
</ul>

<p>This doesn't make a lot of sense in my situation, because one third of 60mm is 20mm and 5 times that is 100mm, which is longer then the beam width. And even if the beam was wider there won't be as much place, because there will be 2 horizontal beams connected to the vertical beam. I found three simple ways to do the joint in such situation:</p>

<p>1) Making ends of both tenons slanted:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/4bjeP.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/4bjeP.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

Exotic woods in particular can cause severe allergic reactions, but even common woodworking woods like black walnut produce shavings that will kill plants if you mulch it into your garden.

I saw one woman build an owl box where she designed the top with vents that would literally direct rainfall down into the box. I also saw lots of other things I didn't like, such as screws in the roof that will allow an entry point for water and many other things.</p>

<p>I'd like to put vents up the side, but I don't want rain running in. To accomplish this, I'd like to make them angle up into the box at a roughly 30-45 degree angle. I'd like to know the best way to do this. My first thought is to take a circular saw and set the angle on its blade. I'm not sure if mine is capable of that or not. I also have access to a table saw. It seems like it'd be simple to set the angle and cut a line, but how do you get the blade into the board? You can easily make and interior cut with a table saw or circular saw by setting it down into the board, but at an angle, it doesn't seem like it'd work the same. Can anyone tell me how to do this?</p>

<p>Again, these are just vent holes, probably about 5-6"" long in a 1""x10-12"" board.

"Are drain holes in a wooden bird house necessary, and if so, what's the best way to make them?","<p>I'm asking a few wood working question in relation to an owl box I'm making to put on my property. My question is about drain holes in this and any bird box.</p>

<p>I've always put drain holes in bird houses I've made, because they've called for them. However, they don't make much sense to me. It seems like any bedding or nesting material would absorb any pee, and there wouldn't be enough to need draining. I'd also think that general debris would clog any drain holes.</p>

<p>Firstly, do you guys think that drain holes are necessary? The only real use I can think of is that they might be for any rain that gets in. However, if nesting material and bird crap get in them and clog them up, they wouldn't even drain that. It seems to me that it'd be more important for air circulation to get rid of any toxic fumes like ammonia from the pee and to evaporate any liquids.</p>

<p>Secondly, if you think they are necessary, how do you recommend doing them. Would you just use holes, slots, or like some I've seen, would you chamfer the corners of the bottom so you have a vent on each corner? Will any liquid even run to these vents or would you need to work the wood to have some kind of slope to direct it to the corner holes? Thanks for the help.</p>

"Table Saw Challenge: Making a Sled for a 2' Circle","<h1>Intro</h1>

<p>I only have a table saw, no band saw. I do have a jig saw, though.
I have a 2' x 2' square of glued white oak that I wish to make into a circular table top.</p>

<p>I've seen articles and posts about getting a near circle with a sled/jig. I believe this is by rough cutting and then making many passes tangent to the blade. I'm fine with it not being perfectly smooth, but just dimensioned correctly enough that I can sand it with a belt sander.</p>

<p>It seems to me this is a feasible idea. I'm comfortable around the table saw even with safety guards removed.</p>

<h1>My Question</h1>

<p>So  what is the best construction for such a sled?</p>

"hand plane controls (bevel down)","<p>I finally got a decent craigslist haul of a #4, #5 1/4, #6 Stanley Bailey and a bunch of spare blades. </p>

<p>I have been searching online and can find explanations for each of the adjustments.  But I am having a hard time understanding how they interact together.</p>

<p>For example, moving the frog back is for taking larger shavings and less figured wood.  Moving it up is for smaller shavings and more figured woods.  </p>

<p>A similar logic applies with the chip breaker.  </p>

<p>Would you ever use the chip breaker really opened up but with a tight mouth? Or the opposite?  Also what is the point of this lateral adjustment lever, is that just in case you want to take non-perpendicular shavings?</p>

<p>One other aspect is how the blade extension interacts with the chip breaker and the mouth opening.  </p>

<pre><code>Blade-Extension    Chip-breaker    Mouth            Ideal Cut
  Less                 Wide         Wide       Thinner shavings in straight grain

"How can I design a large speaker cabinet to come together square and true when my panels aren't flat and my boards aren't straight?","<p>This question differs from similar questions about wood warping because I'm not asking how to straighten a warped board nor how to fix an existing design that warped.  Rather I'm asking how do you design at the outset for a large enclosure to come together square and true even if the boards and panels you have available are not straight or flat.  I'm also wanting to know if there is an order of assembly that will maximize accuracy or minimize how much correcting force is needed.  For instance, one strategy might be to lay the largest side flat and build up on it.  An alternate strategy might be to start with a section of the innermost bracing that I <em>can</em> make square and true (using the best pieces I have) and build out from that seed.</p>

<p>This is for a large speaker enclosure approximately 2' wide, 3' deep, and 5' tall, but I think the question could apply to any piece of similar size and construction.  The materials I have are 7/16"" OSB panels and 2"" x 3"" douglas fir studs.</p>

<p>(A more usual choice for speaker enclosures would be 3/4"" MDF for panels and bracing, but if I can build it with OSB it will save a lot on material cost.  Moreover the size of the speakers is such that you can't get enough stiffness by just using thicker panels; either panel material will still need bracing every 8"" or so.  Rest assured I am still using MDF for the actual panel the speaker drivers bolt to, but due to the type of speaker design these MDF panels will be internal walls, not external.  (These internal MDF panels form the ""inner box"" I was talking about that I can make most accurate in size/shape.))</p>

<p>I'm planning to rip some of the 2x3's to make 1.5""x1.25"" battens.  I know that if I take two panels that do not lay flat, and join them at 90 degrees with a batten, the joined edge will be straight assuming the panels were cut straight.  I also know that a 2x3 that is warped over a long length is ""less"" warped if cut into short sections.  So perhaps breaking the battens into sections is a good idea?  However in any case, when building from the skin to the inside, I think there is still the possibility that panels fixed in 2 dimensions will have warping in the 3rd unfixed dimension?  (E.g. they might bow in or balloon out even though the edges meet.)</p>

<p>The way I've most seen recommended online is build a skeleton or matrix and attach panels to it.  In this method, keeping the 2x3's in long sections would ease construction and assembly, but I'd be worried about getting to the end and discovering an irreconcilable difference in shape between the skeleton and the skin.  Not to mention differences in expansion, and resonance in the long boards.</p>

<p>I also thought about making a large number of ""pre-fab"" pieces to use to assemble the enclosure like Lego bricks.  These would be C-shaped and rectangle-shaped biscuit joined studs with OSB triangles nailed and glued on top of the corners.  I am not sure, however, whether these would take too long to construct, and also worry about building them to a designed size and finding out the actual size needed is different during assembly.</p>

<p>So, to recap:  how do I make a straight object out of wood that is not straight?  Should I start assembly with the longest edges / largest panels or smaller parts first?  Is it better to break the design up into an assemblage of short pieces joined together, or to frame it with some of the straightest studs to make a basis for the shape?</p>

"How do I remove scratches between layers of polyurethane?","<p>My husband and I have been building a farm table and we are oh-so-close to being done, but we are having issues in the final coats of polyurethane on the top. Here's a rundown:</p>

<p>We stained the wood with gel stain and put three coats of Minwax polyurethane on top.

I think the brush didn't have a wet tip and the poly dragged or something... the rest of it looked great.</p>

<p>We used steel wool again and did another coat of poly, this time with a foam brush. When it dried it left these weird spots, so we put on another coat with a foam brush... even more weird spots. (they almost looked like water marks?)</p>

<p>This time we took 220 grit sandpaper and sanded the entire top of the table (with our hands... we didn't do enough research to learn that we should have used a sanding block... we're total newbies!) and put on a coat with the brush again. The coat itself looks great! But we can see scratches from the sandpaper under the poly :(</p>

<p>I've seen mixed advice online about how we should proceed.... do we need to sand down to get rid of the scratches (and probably sand out all of the stain and start over), or will using steel wool again and applying more coats of poly get rid of the scratches? I so do not want to sand down completely and start over, especially when we are this close to being done. But I also want our table to have a beautiful finish. Please help!</p>

"Edge joint failure - what is the cause?","<p>I've had a few instances where my glued up panels, breadboards etc. have had gaps open up at the edges. This happens a few days or weeks after gluing. The gaps have all stopped at a certain point and the join remains strong, but it looks terrible. I'm hoping to start selling soon and I can't afford for things to fail like that. It seems that the wood is moving after it gets to its new environment and is able to overcome the strength of the glue.</p>

<p>This has happened with multiple woods and multiple glue bottles so I know they aren't problems. I tried using splines to reinforce the joint but it still failed.</p>

<p>To mate the edges to be joined I start with a straight edge off the jointer, thicknesser, or table saw and then hand plane it smooth and flat. I am pretty certain the quality of the mating surfaces at this stage is not a problem.</p>

<p>I then usually put a very slight concavity in the surface, both across its width and its length. I was taught to do this as it supposedly helps the ends and sides of the joint that are exposed to air and moisture mate properly. I then glue with PVA and clamp.</p>

<p>Possible causes that have occurred to me are:</p>

<p><strong>1 - The moisture content of the wood just isn't close enough to what it will reach in the environment it goes into.</strong> This seems like a big issue but one that is hard to avoid. The area I live in is fairly humid and my workshop is not well insulated or heated. The pieces mostly have gone into a very modern house which feels very dry which can't help. It seems unlikely to me that commercial furniture is made in a climate controlled environment though. Do I need to relocate?</p>

<p><strong>2 - The concavity I put into the mating surfaces might need to be more extreme.</strong> Since the joint is pulling apart where it should be tightest it seems unlikely to me that the concavity is causing the problem. Rather, it seems that I might be making the concavity too subtle. Thoughts?</p>

<p><strong>3 - I might need to use a different kind of glue.</strong> It is often said that any of the major woodworking glues are stronger than the wood itself but that isn't my experience; these failures are right along the glue line. </p>

<p>I've done some testing where I glue two bits of wood together, leave it overnight, then break it apart with a hammer. The break would generally be fairly clean with only a bit of splintered wood. This would suggest a glue issue to me.</p>

<p>Perhaps there is something I am doing wrong but I can't imagine what there is to mess up with PVA. I always leave it to cure overnight. Maybe I need to switch to something stronger, like epoxy?</p>

<p><strong>4 - Clamp strength.</strong> I've read about glue starvation from excessive clamping pressure but I've also read that it is a myth. I would describe my clamping as ""pretty damn tight"". Maybe I need to either increase or decrease my clamping pressure.</p>

<p><strong>5 - Reinforcement.</strong> I know a butt joint is supposed to be strong enough on its own but maybe there is something I can do to really pin the joints together at the ends? Splines didn't work but then I suspect they may only help with alignment and may not give the joint any extra strength. Is there some way to mechanically lock the ends of a but joint together that is invisible or that is easy to hide? If there is a method I suspect it would only work on thicker boards.</p>

"What is it called when you use screws with a butt joint?","<p>I always thought that this wasn't done, because the screw would likely blow out, unless it's perfectly aligned.</p>

<p>I'm wondering if there's a name for this technique (using screws to reinforce a butt joint), and if there's a jig or technique for drilling the holes? </p>

<p>For example, cross-sectional view:</p>

<pre><code>screw               __   _______________ 
[\\\\\\&gt;   ---&gt;    |  | |_______________  board 2
                   |  |
                   |  |
                  board 1
</code></pre>

<p>I saw some guy doing this by hand (with no jig or drill press) in <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObCLdiD2w5U"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the second half of this video</a>.  Seems a little risky.  Is this common?</p>

<p>I've found something called a doweling jig, seems like it would work if used on <code>board 2</code>, but I don't think it would hold them both in place.</p>

"prevent wood bending when glue is applied","<p>I'm trying to make floor tiles which should look similar to attached picture.
I sliced a wood about 6mm thick and wanted to glue them to the mdf base.
However when I put PVA glue on a wood slices, they bent. Corners of slices raised from a base from 3 to 7 mm. Bending is really huge and caused by the moisture of glue. So with such a deformation gluing is not possible at all. I tried to straighten slices with a board on top of them and clamps but only crack a couple of them.</p>

<p>So the question is how to prevent wood bending? or is there other way to attach slices to a base?</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>PS: as mentioned in comments, each tile is supposed to be a rectangular about 800x400mm, these sizes could vary. Slices (open grain pieces) are going to have width about 60-85mm (85 is the capability of a saw) and length 60-100mm.</p>

"What are some tricks to flatten twisted and warped lumber boards without removing any material from them?","<p>I live in Lithuania, Eastern Europe. Throughout the years, I have bought lumber from more than 20 lumberyards all around the country, trying to find at least a single one that could sell me straight, clear boards that I need for making boats and spars. My efforts were in vain. Even though I always bought the highest quality lumber, dried and calibrated, and often even promised to pay double for the really good stuff, the stuff they actually give me is barely acceptable to make pallets. I am slowly accepting the fact that there is no quality lumber in my country, regardless of how much I am willing to pay. The boards I get are twisted, bent, warped, don't have a single straight edge, and are full of knots (I am talking big ones, every 10-20 cm (4-8 inches).</p>

<p>By the time I re-rip and plane these boards flat and straight, there is almost nothing left to use, and 3/4 of the wood is wasted. What's worse, when I rip a straightened and flattened board, it often starts twisting and warping right after it comes out of the tablesaw - that's how bad it is. Before you say it, the machines I have in my shop are of high quality, and I do know how to use them.</p>

<p>Because of that reason, I am forced to consider ways to straighten and flatten these boards <em>after</em> ripping them to dimensions. I tried forcing it them into shape using steam boxes, but most of the time the lumber breaks, even after steaming a piece for hours, and bending slowly. Even when it works, I still can't get them perfectly straight and flat, especially when the bend is compound and changes direction every few meters. Steam-bending to approximate straightness and then finishing up with a tablesaw or a planer doesn't work, because as I said, these boards start immediately warping again as soon as they come out of the machines due to released internal stress.</p>

<p>You can't imagine how frustrating this is. I haven't seen a straight board since the last time I visited USA. The stuff we get in Lithuania is beyond horrible.</p>

<p>Fellow woodworkers, do you have any advice for me? How do work with such lumber without wasting so much time and money? I can't afford shipping lumber from other countries or continents...</p>

<p>Thank you for your time.</p>

<li>To obtain a high gloss finish, what rubbing and/or polishing compounds should I use (links to products would be great!)? </li>
<li>As well as what method of buffing and polishing should I use?</li>

The state of the wood slab has evolved even since posting that question and rather than amend that SO question into oblivion I figured best to ask a separate one...</em></p>

<p><em>As reminder, I used <a href=""https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B0027UEW5K"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">spar varnish</a> and <a href=""https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B00173CDSQ"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">watco danish oil</a>.</em></p>

<h2>It's my first real attempt at wood finishing and made the following mistakes:</h2>

<ol>
<li>using spar varnish.  I have since learned from my other SO question above that spar varnish is generally too soft for indoor use and not a good varnish to use for a high gloss/polished finish as it likely doesn't buff/polish well.</li>
<li>not wiping off excess DO after application and leaving a rather thick film on coats 1,3 (see below application schedule)</li>
<li>not wiping off excess varnish after application (not sure if this is important if used by itself as in layer 2 below) </li>
<li>excess coating pooling on underside edge and live-edge (evident in pictures below)</li>
</ol>

<h2>After sanding down the table I have applied the following coats with their respective dry times and mixtures:</h2>

<ol>
<li>50/50 mix of spar varnish + Danish oil (>= 10 days dry time)</li>
<li>spar varnish (~4 weeks dry time)</li>
<li>50/50 mix of spar varnish + Danish oil (~48 hrs into dry time) </li>
</ol>

<p>Current state of the last coat is best described as ""tacky/gummy"" with strong smell (both reducing as time wears on...).  I'm not sure it's still soft enough to leave finger prints but feels sticky.  Not sure how hard to expect it to feel or how odor free to expect it to become either.  From what I've read at these links a gummy feeling after about 48 hrs after not wiping away excess DO is expected.  Though it's unclear if this will ever harden well enough to buff/polish (crux of this question...): </p>

However, not entirely sure what I should expect for spar varnish + Danish oil coats...</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>My end goal is a high gloss/polished/hard/durable finish.</strong></p>

<h2>From the SO question above and it's thoughtful answer as well as considering my mistakes, it seems I have a few courses of action:</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>Immediately try wiping down last layer (layer 3 above) with a cloth and mineral spirits to thin/remove the spar varnish + danish oil coat.  Then apply 2/3 layers <a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/questions/5891/how-to-fix-very-light-scratches-in-polyurethane-finish/5893#5893"">wiping varnish</a>.  Let dry for 24 hrs.  Wet sand 1000,1500,2000 grit.  Then use <a href=""https://www.homedepot.com/p/Ryobi-5-Amp-6-in-Buffer-Polisher-RB61G/205502713"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">power buffer/polisher</a> in conjunction with <a href=""https://www.homedepot.com/p/Minwax-1-lbs-Paste-Finishing-Wax-785004444/100376194?MERCH=REC-_-PIPHorizontal1_rr-_-205035475-_-100376194-_-N"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">minwax paste wax</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Wipe down with mineral spirits as in 1 above but after that, sand off first 2 coats as well.  I dread doing this as I'm not sure how easy it will be to remove the varnish + danish oil from the live edge.  But if necessary, I'll do it...</p></li>
<li><p>Let current coat (layer 3 above) continue to dry and hope that it becomes hard enough to either directly buff/polish or apply successive coats of wiping varnish on top of this layer that I can then buff/polish.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Is there another course of action that I've missed?
If no, which of the above would be best to pursue?</strong>  </p>

<h2>Ideally, I'd like a combination with the best balance of:</h2>

<ol>
<li>least potential damage to the underlying wood (especially the live edge with it's small amount of inner bark)</li>
<li>highest quality/high gloss/polished look</li>
<li>completion time from now</li>
</ol>

<p>This is a learning experience and ultimately want to know how to get the best outcome out of this piece and how best to avoid these mistakes (considering my desired outcome finish) for future pieces.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Pictures here of the current state of the slab top/bottom.  Note the live edge.  Note also that the thickness of coats 2 and 3 combined is apparent when looking at the underside photo (4th below) (not sure if that helps anyone when answering this question).  I applied only coat 1 to the underside, however I applied both coats 2 and 3 to the topside AND to the live edges (even though they face down).

"Stronger attachment method for B&D Workmate top","<p>I'm refurbishing my 70s vintage Black &amp; Decker Workmate. Itâs seen a lot of abuse, but the only thing that ever broke, besides working corners of the plywood vise jaws (which I'm replacing) were the screws that held the plywood to the 1/16"" metal bracket underneath (2 screws on each jaw, per side). So I'm looking for ideas on a better, stronger method than the manufacturer used. I'm thinking of Ikea furniture I've seen, where they've used a machine screw that screws into the side of a larger tapped shaft, that you insert into a hole that's drilled perpendicular to the machine screw/hole â in my case, a long hole drilled into the vise ends (see photos).

"Refinishing teak patio table","<p>A couple of years ago, we purchased a beautiful teak outdoor table. I sealed it with Semco sealer (recommended by the store for teak) a month after we bought it. To protect our investment, we also had a custom cover made for the table to protect it from rain and sun. Unfortunately, we got a lot of rain recently and when we took off the cover, the teak was covered with mildew spots. The water got through the cover and was trapped inside. I first tried mild bleach to remove the spots. That didn't take all of them out, so I tried a stronger commercial product. This didn't work either and just left the table looking faded and splotchy.</p>

<p>So I'm thinking I should just refinish the surface. I've done some reading on this, and I'm thinking I'll start with 120, then 220, then seal with Semco. Is there anything I should watch out for? How deep to these mildew spots go? Should I use an orbital or straight sander? I'm hoping I won't have to strip off too much of the wood.</p>

"Table saw cross cut on panel","<p>I'm a beginner who wants to be safe here! </p>

<p>I need to cut multiple boards (let's say 10"" x 16"") with a table saw. </p>

<p>My first cut was going to make a 16"" rip cut on my 4 foot plywood and then cross cut it to 10"" pieces. Now it is evident I could use a sled, or the miter gage for that cut. The longer length is clearly too long to use the fence alone and risk kickback.</p>

<p>Let's now assume that I would like to rip/cross cut those 10"" x 16"" into roughly 10"" x 8"" boards. Could I use my fence only? Will it risk kickback? Since it is almost square, is there some kind of safety rule of thumb regarding the risk or absence of risk? I know the 10"" edge can be firmly pressed against the fence and it will not rotate, but is it a bad practice?</p>

<p>What about if my previous board was 10"" x 24"" and I rip 8 inch or even 16 inch boards? </p>

"What can cause cracks in painted pine?","<p>I'm taking an online woodworking course (The Weekend Woodworker), and built a small patio table a few months ago. I made it out of select pine (kiln dried), spray painted it (~2 coats), and put in on my back deck. Being the first thing I've ever made, I was (and still am) pretty proud of my efforts! However, I noticed today that the top of the table is already cracking:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/jM1rj.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/jM1rj.jpg"" alt=""Cracking on table top""></a></p>

<p>What could be causing this? The deck is south facing, and gets a ton of sunshine all day, so perhaps it's a UV thing? I also note that water sits on top of the table after it rains, as if the top boards are cupped a little (I did indeed sand the top). I try to dump the water off each time this happens, but I'd like to know what (if anything) I did wrong.</p>

"Dust collection for Bosch sliding miter saw","<p>I have a Bosch 4410 sliding miter saw. It has a small dust port that I've found to be woefully inadequate as the sole means of dust extraction. My shop also has a 5HP cyclone dust collection system that I'd like to put to use on the miter saw. I'd made up a 28"" x 44"" hood, of sorts, using a couple of window well covers that helped somewhat but takes up too much real estate in the shop. The sliding mechanism extends nearly 16"" behind the dust port, putting the hood too far away from the blade and dust port to get the job done effectively. The current thought is to build a smaller hood that attaches near the rear handle behind the motor using a 6"" flexible collection hose connected to the shop dust collector. I've seen some nice hoods folks have designed, but none for a saw with a long slide mechanism.

"Best way to scab joists for bridge","<p>I'm building a bridge across a ditch in my nephews front yard. Shown here is an elevation of one of the four joists that will support 2 x 6 redwood treads, width of 5.5'. To achieve the curve, I will need to assemble the joists from 2 pieces that will need to be scabbed together in the center. The unsupported part of the span measures 11.5 feet, the vertical thickness of the majority of the span is 10"", it measures about 8.5"" where it leaves the supporting pads at the ends. The wood to be used is pressure treated Doug Fir, structural grade. My intent is to scab these two pieces with a 4' long piece of 2 x 8 PT Fir, same as above. 
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ot0sm.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ot0sm.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a>
I'm a long time builder but I'm a bit nervous on this one. I've not, in memory, seen similar. Think this is sound? If so, how best to secure the scabs? Many screws? Carriage bolts? Use iron versus the wood scabs? (I'd rather avoid that.) Wood-scab both sides of the interior joists? I guess my biggest concern is stress, or wear from use, on holes going through the joist halves.</p>

<p>I could run the design flat with a single piece but that would require steps on the ends and would not look nearly as nice in its intended location.</p>

<p>EDIT:
As per suggestion, I've lengthened and fattened the scabs.The left side shows bolts at 6"" centers, 4"" centers on the right. Comments?

"Filling cracks with epoxy after Tung oil","<p>So still working on my live edge walnut table, and I think I may have screwed up the order of operations a bit.  The slab has some defects - cracks, small knots with voids, etc.  Didn't think to much of it - just part of working with this type of wood.  But now it occurs to me that I could do an epoxy fill.  Maybe clear, maybe with a metal powder fill.</p>

<p>But I've already put 3 coats of Tung oil on it.  So I'm not sure the epoxy is feasible at this point.  Will it stick?  Will the process of sanding it down flush damage the surrounding oil finish in a way that will be noticible in the end?</p>

<p>Thoughts?</p>

<p>5/5 update</p>

<p>Ok, following Graphus's advice ... and adding a bit.  I scraped out several of the defects with a small pick.  Turns out there alot of punky stuff in some of the defects, and one knot came out entirely.  I followed up with a small ballnose rasp on a Dremel, and the the suggested drill.  In the end, there probably wasn't much oiled wood left in there except for the smallest cracks.</p>

<p>Mixed up the epoxy with alot of brass powder.  Mixed way to much material.  Applied with a bamboo skewer, applying the suggested heat gun.  I'll update again in a few days.</p>

Cut down the epoxy with a rasp and block plane, then sanded flush wit a 1/4 sheet sander starting at 100 grit.  Worked it down to 220 with the power sander.  Hit the filled stuff with 600 grit, which brought it out a good bit.  I'm pretty happy with how it came out.</p>

"Doweling technique - can they be applied in two stages?","<p>I am planning to build a custom box to fit in my car's trunk on one side, as tall and long as the trunk and as wide as little as possible. This would hold my tools, emergency gadgets etc.</p>

<p>Since I plan not to invest a whole lot of effort I will avoid box joints and dovetail joints (which I practiced a few times in the past but they seem to have taken too much time and effort) and want to resort to butt-joints reinforced with dowels. I already have a <a href=""http://www.wolfcraft.com/en/products/p/dowel_jointers/1_dowelmaster/s/p/index.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">doweling jig</a> from Wolfcraft.</p>

<p>In order to prevent some issues that I had in the past with doweling I am thinking to do things a bit different but that might end up in a disaster so I am asking first here.</p>

<p>How about I glue the pieces of the box first, simple (glued) butt joint (that weak kind of joint) wait for the glue to dry and <strong>then</strong> drill the holes for the dowels, apply the dowels with glue, trim them flush, apply finish etc.</p>

<p><strong>Would applying the dowels after the first set of glue cured weaken the joints? Or would this have any other downside?</strong></p>

<p>Why would I do this? Clamping simplification. Having a long and atypical form and size would ask for large and specialized clamps that I currently do not own and most importantly don't have space for.</p>

<p>Most videos on the internet (youtube mainly) show doweling as fitting the whole thing in one go not in two stages as I would try so I became curious if such an approach holds a nasty surprise (weak joints or something else).</p>

<li><p>Removable top lid, like in the boardgame: A removable cover that you take away and put ""somewhere"". Not acceptable by my wife :)</p></li>
<li><p>Hinged cover: the cover will be too big and there is no wall to lean it against so... It will need to stay in the air.. not realistic.</p></li>
<li><p>Sliding mechanism that allow the cover to slide between the desk and the sofa. Sounds cool but sounds also hard to put back and forth. Not sure</p></li>
<li><p>Mechanism to slide the cover under the remaining part of the desk. To me looks like the better approach.. But construction will be ""funny"".</p></li>

<p>Do I simply try to pour more glue into the cracks, clamp is again, and hope for the best? </p>

<p>Do I try to drip denatured alcohol into the cracks, to soften the glue and pry it apart, then try to glue it up again?</p>

"Long lasting exterior shutters","<p>I'm creating some exterior wood shutters made from Eastern Red Cedar (rails and stiles) and Western Red Cedar (panels). The mismatch really has more to do with what's available locally than a design choice. The ""boss"" wants them to be raised panel. She does not like board-and-batten because they're too rustic for her tastes, and louvered are boring to her. </p>

<p>Putting together a frame and panel are pretty straightforward, so my question is more about the details. These shutters will be primed and painted, but there's the possibility that water could get inside the frame.

<p>Is this ""safe"" to do on a planer? Should I pass the form through too to provide support?  </p>

"What would be the UK equivalent of the common US 2 by 4 (not just by size)","<p>I've found a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0TvD5oAMyc"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">DIY shelving project</a> that interests me and am setting about researching the best place to obtain the wood required for it.</p>

<p>In this project, and others I have seen, the American instructor commonly refers to the wood in use by the size, either 2 by 4 or 1 by 2 (only 2 sizes are used in this project).</p>

<p>I know from reading around that size wise this would roughly equate to the UK's 44 x 96 and 25 x 44 but it is my belief that in the US if someone refers to 'Using a bit of 2 x 4' then more is understood than just the size. It is also known what the type of wood it is, the cut, whether it is sawn / planned and so on.</p>

<p>So my question is:</p>

<p><strong>Does the UK have a piece of wood that is universally commonly used for hobby / domestic projects that it is simple referred to by a common name and is this typically a suitable substitute for the US 2 x 4? If so is there a common place to purchase this wood (B&amp;Q, Wickes, etc)?</strong></p>

"Sculpture: Anchor a wire armature to a natural wood branch","<p>I'm working on a sculpture (of a gibbon swinging on a branch) which will be made of wood and wax with a wire armature, and I'm trying to figure out how to anchor my armature to the branch.</p>

<p>Here's a quick drawing of the intended setup:
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/M5WL8.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/M5WL8.jpg"" alt=""Diagram of construction""></a></p>

<p>The branch is a natural, hardwood branch, about 3/4"" in diameter and about 10"" long. It's quite strong. One end of the branch will be anchored in a block of wood. Somewhat close to the other end I need to attach a strong wire armature, which needs to be able to hold, say, 8-10 ounces of wax altogether. The tricky bit is the angle: I need that wire to come out from the branch at a 45-or-so-degree angle as shown above, and since it'll have the weight of the wax pulling down on it, it has to be anchored very sturdily in the branch.</p>

<p>My current thought is cutting a channel in the top of the branch from the point where the armature attaches heading toward the anchor, so the wire would poke through the branch, be bent and then run through the channel; fill the channel with epoxy or something, and paint over the top. It's less than perfect because I'd love to preserve the bark... also, the actual cutting of the channel doesn't seem very easy at all to me.</p>

<p>My question, then: Is the wire-in-the-channel idea the best option? If so, how should I go about cutting that channel? Or, is there a better way to do this that I haven't thought of?</p>

<p>Many thanks!</p>

different cuts to be visible</li>

<p>I need more reputations to post more photos/links so I redirect you to this question where I've already posted them <a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/questions/5563/horizontal-stablity/5567#5567"">horizontal stablity</a></p>

<p>The leg is connected to the table top by two screws. Additionally, a flat metal bar is welded to the leg and it is mounted to the table top by another two screws.</p>

<p>Right now the entire connection is bad and hence the table top doesn't touch the leg nearly at all. There are only few touching points; even where the screws are, the table top doesn't touch the leg perfectly (I think the leg and bar are not completely straight). All in all, the table wobbles and the horizontal displacement is around 2-3mm.</p>

<p>The design of this table has to be however as clean and simple as possible so adding a cross member is the last thing I want to do :/</p>

<p>I think that improving the connection will decrease the horizontal displacement. However, I wonder if the table will still wobble a bit just because of table and legs dimensions (especially because the leg width is only 4cm and the table width is 160cm while the table height is 76cm).</p>

<p>The other issue is how to make the leg-table-top connection better (assuming that the leg and bar are completely straight). Right now the screw goes through the entire profile of the leg, like on left figure. Would it be better if it connects the table top only with the upper horizontal wall of the leg, like on the right figure?</p>

"Questions about my custom stain and cleanup","<p>As some know I was experimenting with <a href=""http://www.instructables.com/id/Steel-Wool-and-Vinegar-Wood-AgingEbonizingWeathe/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">making my own stain</a> using vinegar and nails removed pallets. I used white vinegar and a couple hundred nails in a 5 gallon pail.</p>

<p>In the end I have a stain that is working but the results are not what I expected so I was wondering if someone might be able to determine where I went wrong. In hindsight I can think of a few specific things that changed the outcome. Outside of the general process of putting nails in vinegar I did the following things:</p>

<ul>
<li>Concoction was left in the pail for about 3 weeks. Life got in the way. Most the tutorials about this sort of thing suggest a week at most. </li>
<li>There was a large amount of what I can describe as rust foam (it was about 4 inches high above the liquid). I was not sure how to separate it from the liquid so I just mixed it all together. (This would be why my results are <em>slightly</em> red / orange where it should have just darkened.) </li>
<li>I might have used too many nails but I didn't think it would hurt. </li>
</ul>

<p>I know from an <a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/a/2237/128"">answer to another related question</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In reality you just need iron and vinegar. Rusty metal is no more or less desirable here</p>
</blockquote>

<p>so it is possible I put myself in this position by using too much rust.</p>

<p>At the end of the day I wanted to know how can I clean this pile of nails? In theory most of the rust should be gone and I just need to clean them and I could use them again.</p>

<p>Do you think the ""rust foam"" was unavoidable? How could I have removed the liquid from the foam?</p>

"Gluing plywood to plywood for doll's house floor","<p>I am making a small doll's house for my daughter. This is my first project; I am a total beginner at woodworking, basically what I know is remembered from watching my dad 30 years ago :)</p>

<p>It's going pretty well, I have cut the panels, and even managed to get some perfect rectangles cut for windows; however when cutting them I noticed that of course, the plywood delaminates very easily - in fact much more easily that I expected.</p>

<p>A front view of what I was planning to do:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/7Q3EL.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/7Q3EL.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>So I plan to make the base and main ceiling out of pine so I could screw into it for strength, however the floor was just going to be plywood glued, along with some mouldings as batons to increase the surface area along the side.</p>

<p>Will this design be strong enough for the interior floor just with the glue? I know that the glue is stronger than the wood; my concern is that the top layer of plywood and glue will peel off and the floor will collapse if she bangs around too much (she's two and a half).</p>

<p>(There will be a back as well of course.)</p>

<p>Matt mentioned dimensions may be important:</p>

<p>It will be ~22cm x 34cm x 22cm (w x h x d)</p>

<p>The plywood is 8mm thick; the pine is 15mm.</p>

<p>The plywood is basically offcuts from my father in law, so is in ""been knocking around the workshop"" condition. Clean but a bit flaky.</p>

<p>The plywood has a paper thin veneer on one side in a reddish looking wood. I should have mentioned this actually, although I can just use the other side. I assume this was done for appearance - it is literally paper thin and flakes as soon as you bring a tool into the same room. I presume I should avoid gluing to this side altogether?</p>

"When is the ideal time to work green wood","<p>I had made a <em>really</em> simple bow saw during my summer holidays. I was trying to see if I could make a project from start to finish using only hand tools.</p>

<p>I cut some poplar (Mostly guessing but the shape of the leaf makes me pretty sure.) and started shaping the log. I used a draw knife as a froe (for lack of better option). I then made a bench hook and though between the draw knife and a plane I could get the wood fairly flat. </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/A2hAy.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/A2hAy.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>That is where I was mistaken. Using both of those tools on the wood created the same problem. Instead of slicing the wood it looked like it was tearing little strips instead. Those got caught on the blades of the respective tools. </p>

<p>So I had an exercise in futilely. With every push or pull I got fibres stuck on the blade. Those would prevent the blade from making another cut. So I would remove those and be able to <em>maybe</em> make one more cut. </p>

<p>I eventually gave up and just used my axe to finish. It was rougher but got the job done. I know that green wood will eventually ""settle"" once it dries but I wanted to try and see what I could do before hand.</p>

<p>The reason I even bothered, and leading to my question, was because Roy Underhill gave me the impression that working was easier. He did not suggest that all the work could be done while green but that initial shaping was easier. There was one specific video where a gentleman made a Winsdor chair and made the same comment when he was using his draw knife on some red oak. In the case with Roy he was making a grease pot out of some black walnut.</p>

<p>Was my green wood too green and I should have waited longer? Am  I not interpreting the comments on the work-ability of green wood? Perhaps the wood species I was working on is not the green work-able kind?</p>

"What knock down hardware can I use on this platform bed frame?","<p>Basically, I want to be able to make the platform of this bed easy to take apart, because I'd like to be able to easily move it by myself. I'd like knock-down fasteners to be used in a way that the frame can be assembled and re-assembled repeatedly without damaging the lumber or hardware. </p>

<p>The picture below is a rough mock-up of the bed frame from the underside.
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/imh87.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/imh87.png"" alt=""Bottom of The Bed Frame Platform""></a></p>

<p>Here's a quick rundown on the frame:</p>

<p>It's a queen size. In the above picture, the brown corresponds to the wood, the light gray corresponds to headboard brackets, and the dark gray corresponds to mounting plates for the bed legs. </p>

<h3>Lumber</h3>

<p>The wood will be red oak. </p>

<p>The outer boards will be 8/4 (1.5"" thick) and 5.5"" wide. Two will be 60.75"" long and the other two will be ~82"" long. The middle inner board is also 8/4 (1.5"" thick), but it will be 3.5"" wide with a length of ~71"". The skinny strips will be 4/4 (0.75"" thick) rails for the bed slats. They'll be joined to the long adjacent boards with biscuits for alignment and screws for strength. (I don't want the rails to be knock-down.)</p>

<h3>Current Hardware</h3>

<p>The leg mounting plates are approximately squares with 2.4"" sides. I'd like to keep them near the innermost corner of the miter joints. If that's not possible, then I'd like to keep them as close as possible to the miter joints by placing them all on the vertical boards (in the picture).</p>

<p>The head board brackets are ~1.5"" wide by ~5.5"" long. The center headboard bracket will be kept in its place. However, the other two outer brackets can be drawn in more, but I'd like to keep them as close to the edge as possible.</p>

<p>I'm planning an attaching the above hardware to the lumber with tee-nuts, because threaded inserts with knife type threads do not go easily into red oak.</p>

<h3>Design Constraints</h3>

<p>I would prefer for all of the knock-down hardware to be visible only on the bottom. It's okay if it's visible on the top, but I'd be a bit worried about moisture from the mattress corroding the hardware or damage to the mattress from the hardware. However, if it would be visible from the outside perimeter edges, I will revert to my original plan of using floating tenons.</p>

<h3>Knock-Down Hardware I've looked at</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Cam Bolts and Screws</strong>: I've looked at a wide variety of cam bolts and screws. However, I'm only interested in ones that have threaded inserts for the bolt as knife type threads do not work all that well in hardwood. I'm currently looking at Cam Bolts with a 6mm diameter. These would be my first choice with metal dowels for reinforcement (if needed).</li>
<li><strong>Countertop Joint Fasteners</strong>: I've only briefly looked at Rockler's Tite Joint Fastener</li>
<li><strong>Metal Dowels</strong>: I was thinking of using these just for extra strength. I'd like them to be of a uniform size, if they are used. However, I'm not sure how big the holes should be for the dowels due to the wood expanding or contracting.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Question</h3>

<p>Will any of the above options work for this bed frame? Would other knock-down fasteners work? Is it completely infeasible?</p>

<p>My preferred option would be to run a pair of cam bolts &amp; screws along each joint of 8/4 wood, with metal dowels if they are needed for strength.</p>

"Reusable Desk design: how to join pieces?","<p>I just saw <a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/questions/7175/what-knock-down-hardware-can-i-use-on-this-platform-bed-frame"">this question</a> about how to join pieces of a bed frame in order to dispose and reassemble it without damaging the wood. I want to pose a similar question about a registration studio desk. The reason for a separate question is that joints are to be placed differently from the bed frame, therefore different solutions may be viable.</p>

<p>My main concerns are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ease of reassemble and structure movement;</li>
<li>Stability (firm structure and ability to hold the required weight);</li>
<li>Ease of construction (I'm not a woodworking expert).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Material, measures and weight</strong></p>

<p>I'm pretty much wood-agnostic and, given my ignorance, would go for the best size-for-bucks option. I'm probably going for fir. I have a Leroy Merlin store available nearby, and am considering having <a href=""https://www.leroymerlin.it/catalogo/tavola-lamellare-abete-27-x-500-x-1500-mm-32469612-p"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">a slab like this</a> roughly cut for me (sorry, I can't find an English Leroy Merlin catalogue, but the image at least should give you the idea).</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Q4rjw.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Q4rjw.png"" alt=""Quick desk sketch""></a></p>

<p>The desk board should hover at roughly 32 inches (82cm) from the ground, while the drawer under it should sit at 25.5 (63 cm) inches. The overall depth is supposed to be around 24 / 25 (60 cm) inches as well, while the drawer should be around 12 inches (30 cm) deep. Minimum width for the drawer is 53 inches (140cm), but could go up to 63 (160 cm) depending on considerations about future purchases.</p>

<p>The drawer is supposed to only support a digital piano and some additional weight from playing, so from 24 pounds up to probably 30 (12 to 15 kgs) or so. I'm not sure if and how to account the additional weight from body pressure during play. The desk board should support at most the same weight of the drawer, as the items I would put there are considerably lighter than the piano itself.</p>

<p><strong>Methods I've ruled out</strong></p>

<p>Glue and / or naked screws: obviously, glueing pieces of wood with screws makes for sturdy builds, but makes it impossible to disassemble the desk afterwards. Screws can be unscrewed, but 3 / 4 cycles of screwing / unscrewing are going to ruin the wood.</p>

<p><strong>Methods I'm taking into consideration</strong></p>

<p>Wood thread inserts: this was proposed as a solution for using screws without damaging the wood. The inserts act as a ""fixed"" ""middle"" screw so that the wood is ""damaged"" only once and actual screws and bolts can be used multiple times without damaging it. Illustrative picture below (the inserts are shown separate from the pieces but they should actually go inside the holes). As far as I understood, I am to use inserts in both wood pieces I want to join, but I'm not 100% sure. Also, do I need to glue the inserts in their ""housing"" or is the outer thread sufficient for the purpose?</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/3ru33.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/3ru33.png"" alt=""wood thread insert""></a></p>

<p>Pipe structures: this seems to be a big thing on Pinterest where I looked for reference. Pipes seem to come relatively cheap (even if not fully customizable in size) and are infinitely recombinable. You typically create a structure with pipes in order to support the wood boards, which are not required to hold weight anymore but just to provide some additional binding (and of course the desk top). In this case I was suggested to use a combination of pipes with flanges ""permanently"" screwed to the tabletop (and the other components) and pipe couplers to connect the flanges with the pipes structure.</p>

<p>Mortise and tenon joints. I saw some videos illustrating how relatively easy and cheap it is to make a mortise and tenon joint and how strong it is. I'm not sure if this joint is safe to disassemble and reassemble, if no glue is used on the tenon.</p>

<p><strong>Questions</strong></p>

<p>What is the best joining technique among those I presented for this particular case? Do you know of better techniques I could use? Are there things one needs to be aware of, that a novice might not take into account?</p>

<p>Thank you in advance and sorry if this turns out to be a duplicate, it's just hard to understand what would be the right ""reassemble"" keyword.</p>

<p>Sides are bamboo (originally supposed to be hotel stair treads)
6' x 11"" x 1""<br>
Horizontals are African Mahogany. 10.5"" x 1"" x variable length.<br>
Sides lean out @ 15 degrees. 11"" spacing between the shelves.<br>
Total weight of the bookcase is ~105lbs. Add 100lbs(?) of books.</p>

<p>I saw this design online a few years ago, and <em>of course</em> cannot find it again to see how he did it.</p>

<p><strong>Tools and skills</strong></p>

<p>Typical homeowner tool selection. Drills, table saw, circular saw, Kreg pocket jig, a dozen big clamps, router, sanders.
Not averse to buying something new to get this done.</p>

<p>Skills = just on the unskilled side of 'medium'. I can build a mean deck.<br>
Aircraft mechanic and computer programmer (engineering mindset).</p>

<p>Degree of difficulty - the vertical sides cannot be replaced. I only have the two, and so cannot screw up any holes or cuts.
The shelves, I have spare material and can get more. At $7 bd/ft, my wallet would cry, though.</p>

<p><strong>How to join the horizontals with no visible means of support?</strong>
No visible stiles, braces, brackets...</p>

<p>My current thought is pocket screws from under each shelf, into the bamboo sides.
I have enough extra mahogany to create enough sawdust to mix with glue and plug the pocket holes.</p>

<p>Secondary thought is screws from the outside of the sides, into the end grain of the shelves.
This also involves somehow covering over the screw holes with matching (something).
Of course glue with whatever solution.</p>

<p>Due to the off angles, I'm not sure I could pull off dovetails or mortise and tenon.</p>

<p><strong>Other joinery options?
Convince me why pocket screws will not work or are a bad idea.</strong></p>

"Wood Coasters from Tree Branch finish","<p>My family just chopped down an old silver maple tree in their backyard.  It has some great branches that are about 2-3 inches.  We thought that slicing them and cutting them up into thinner pieces to make a some nice drink coasters.</p>

<p>The plan is to have a nice bare tree look with them.  The bark is thin on these in this area.  We want it to have a nice natural look, and possibly something to show off the rings of the tree.  Nothing dark, nothing that will change the color/hue too much.<br>
There won't be a need to make it food safe, as its just for cups and glasses.  They will potentially be used outdoors on the patio.  I would like them sealed so they will retain their look for a long time.  However, I also don't want anything that will smell (in case they are used in the house or in the enclosed patio room).  Something that would also stand up to the elements (to some extent) if they are left out.</p>

<p>My question is do you think that they need any type of finish on them?<br>
 And if so, what kind what do you suggest?<br>
Should these also be dried out, and if so for how long before a finish?  </p>

<p>I know some of this might be opinion based, and I appreciate everyone's opinion and thoughts on that.  Overall, looking for a what works best, and what is a good thought on sealing a wooden coaster that is sliced from a tree branch.</p>

"Can I avoid spur / knicker marks in dado bottom cut with plough plane (stanley #45)?","<p>I want to use a plough plane (stanley #45) to cut dadoes (cross grain). The spurs/knickers are useful in preventing tearout and defining a clean knife wall, but they score past the bottom of the dado, like in the following image (dado profile outlined in red).</p>

<p>This is obviously due to the knickers cutting ahead of the iron, but if push the iron further out to a depth equal (or close to) the spurs, the operation of the blade is much less smoother -- broken shavings, and at the far edge, it results in breakout. </p>

"Oil based stain over water based fire retardant","<p>I'd like to treat some wood (raw pine) with a water-based class A flame retardant (<a href=""http://www.flameseal.com/products/wood/wood-seal-a/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Flameseal WSA</a>), but also stain it with an oil based stain (garden variety Minwax or Varathane).</p>

<p>I'm a bit unsure of compatibility, and the need for a barrier layer (e.g. shellac) if any.</p>

<p>The FR datasheet states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This product may be used on most types of wood as long as penetration occurs. The product may be stained with a compatible stain or top coat after treatment. However, many stains and top coats are flammable and can adversely affect the flammability of the treated substrate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The priority is FR effectiveness over looks, but I'm concerned because the flame treatment is penetrating, then if I have to put a coat of shellac over top, I'm thinking any stain on top of that isn't going to penetrate well. I'm also concerned that, even worse, the stain will never really dry properly. The wood will be used on a ceiling so at least any finish doesn't have to stand up to heavy wear and tear, although if it stays sticky forever it will attract dirt.</p>

<p>So my main question is: How can I apply both the water based FR and the oil based stain and get the most out of both?</p>

<p>My second question is, given the last sentence of that quote above, should I be considering a water-based stain or some special FR stain instead of my go-to oil stains? Does anybody have any experience with this?</p>

<p>I only actually need a class B rating (these are ASTM E84 ratings) so I do have a fair bit of leeway with reduced FR effectiveness, if it matters.</p>

"How can I determine when a linseed oil finish has cured?","<p>I have only recently begun experimenting with linseed oil and walnut oil finishes, after mainly using mineral oil.

<p>I found <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drying_oil"" rel=""noreferrer"">this</a> reference about drying oils in the above-mentioned question, but there's no real indication of how to tell by touch/sight when the curing process has completed.  </p>

<p>Right now, my process is:<br>
* Scrape or sand the bowl to a medium grit, usually 220<br>
* Wipe gently with mineral spirits to remove dust in the grain and raise the remaining grain for finer grits of sandpaper<br>
* Wait 1-5 minutes for excess mineral spirits to dissipate/evaporate (sometimes I try to hasten this using puffs from my mini air compressor)<br>
* Sand up to my finishing grain, usually 600 grit and then 0000 steel wool<br>
* Wipe with linseed oil until surface is covered; use a fresh rag to remove excess<br>
* (<em>note,</em> no pause between previous step and this) Apply carnauba wax and buff into surface  </p>

<p>...my question is, <strong>am I making a mistake here by not waiting for the linseed oil to cure before sealing it in with carnauba wax?</strong> If so, <strong>how long should I wait / how will I tell when it's OK</strong> to proceed to the final wax step?  </p>

"How to make out-of-square cabinet square?","<p>I'm refinishing some old speaker cabinets and noticed they were out of square. They're reasonably sturdy, but if I push the top sideways while holding the bottom (shear force), I can bend them square. In case it's relevant, they're just four boards nailed or screwed together... I can't tell for sure because the fasteners have been covered with wood filler.</p>

<p>I had my wife hold one of the cabinets square by pushing the top sideways while I installed angle brackets on two of the four corners. But when she let go, it immediately went back to not being square. In other words, the two angle brackets weren't strong enough to hold the cabinet in the desired position.</p>

<p>I'm not sure how to get these cabinets square without disassembling them... try more brackets? I have plenty more and could put two in each corner. But I don't want to put a bunch of holes in the cabs if it's not likely to work. Or use beefier brackets? I'm not sure where to find something like that. Or maybe some other way?</p>

<p>By the way, if I have to disassemble them, I think I'd just leave them out-of-square and tell people they were designed that way to add to the tone.</p>

"How to set up a Veritas Basic Grinding jig with short chisels","<h1>Problem</h1>

<p>I need to regrind new bevels on some old worn-out chisels, <em>without</em>
using free-hand techniques, which I know how to do already.  After

However, the chisels I have vary in length, but most/all of them are
quite short.  In actual use, during setup, I very quickly ran into a
problem in the setup, where the short chisels do not fit the jig,
without pushing it forward so far as to then throw off all of the
dimensions that are required for the jig to work.</p>

<p>Is this just my not knowing how to properly set up the jig? Or, is it
due to the design assumption, by Veritas, that the jig would only be
used by chisels with long shanks?  </p>

<h1>Update #1</h1>

<p><a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/questions/9650/how-to-set-up-a-veritas-basic-grinding-jig-with-short-chisels#comment19803_9650"">Graphus's comment</a> was:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>1st and most important is, do the problem short chisels all need to be reground or do you just want to? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, and the grinder comes into play because I want to avoid manually regrinding them on diamond stones. Examining each of the chisels closely, I found that, over the years of abuse, I've honed and rehoned each of them to the point where the entire bevel needs to be reground. Basically, what should be a microbevel is actually a rather large macro bevel, on all of them.</p>

<p>I will also consider the possibility of using my Extra Coarse diamond whetstones to do the coarse work. But from experience, that is a lot more work than using a grinder, that is, only if I can relatively quickly set up the chisel on a/the jig.</p>

<p><a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/questions/9650/how-to-set-up-a-veritas-basic-grinding-jig-with-short-chisels#comment19804_9650"">Graphus's comment</a> was:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Can the jig be moved inwards so that the grinding wheel comes forward, in fact just shy of kissing the rear of the slot? This strikes me as being the main setup change that could resolve most issues, but the grinder or the base of the jig could easily not allow it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I could and did get close, but that turned out not to be viable, because the upper-left handle bumps up against the grinder housing.  I even tried moving that handle over to the right side, but it runs into the lower-right handle. See this photo:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/m96TB.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/m96TB.jpg"" alt=""Veritas Basic Grinding Set problem with short chisels 7.png""></a></p>

<p>I also reconfirmed the problem I detailed in the <a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/YYAMC.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">second image above</a>: In order to adjust the chisel's angle of attack onto the grinding wheel, such that it meets 1/2 way up the bevel as per the instructions<sup><strong>4</strong></sup>, I indeed had to push the chisel so far forward, that the conical part of the back of the chisel abuts up against the jig top plane, tilting the chisel upward even more, throwing off the invariants the jig uses in those instructions. Thus, for these short chisels, I've concluded that jig part is not really applicable.</p>

<p>So ""but the grinder or the base of the jig could easily not allow it"" is the case here.</p>

<p>I neglected to show the condition of the chisels in the original question, so updating this now: This isn't a great photo as it doesn't really show the bevels with any degree of resolution, but you can kind of see the ""macrobevels"" from the light reflection, in this photo:</p>

<p><sup><strong>1</strong></sup> There are many viable options, but my read of tons of
Amazon reviews led me repeatedly back to the Veritas as ""the"" best
here.  Of course, I have diamond whetstones of varying grits and a
honing wheel to do the final stropping.</p>

<li>How would this be done? 

<ul>
<li>I previously used fire and chisel to clean out the center. </li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Trees don't ever grow straight or round so I my not always be ""DEAD CENTER"" but I feel I get close. That's why one side of the drum wall is a little thicker then the rest.</p>

<ul>
<li>This is my concern: can I turn drums on a lathe even if it is not true center? </li>

"Exterior glue for tapered plugs","<p>[Updated - see pictures below]</p>

<p>I treat joinery in the UK for rot by drilling 10mm holes, injecting fungicide gel, and hammering home a tapered cross-grain oak plug to seal the hole. I've been using exterior-grade PVA smeared on the inside of the hole to fix the plug. After hammering home, I immediately plane the plug flat, while the joint should still be open. After 24 hours, I apply a conventional exterior paint finish.</p>

<p>Revisiting a property I treated 6 years ago, I see that about 25% of the oak plugs have moved enough to crack the paint finish. Not one plug has come loose, but some have moved enough to crack the paint, and that is unsightly, and will let in water. I'd like to fix the plugs more reliably to avoid this. The glue has to work in the UK, which can be hot, wet or freezing.</p>

<p>I asked Loctite if they could recommend anything. They said they weren't sure anything they had would be better than PVA. I need an easy-to-use glue, since I insert thousands of these plugs, often working at height outdoors on old buildings. It's hard to experiment, since all the plugs look great for a long time after the painting. I'd prefer to have just one visit for glue-and-plane-flat, without having to wait for the glue to cure.</p>

<p>What glue can I use? Or what better plugging process can I use?</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong> two days later, following great suggestions from answer and comments:</p>

<p>Here is a close-up picture of paint cracking at oak plugs in 2016. These are oak plugs hammered into an oak frame and glued with with pva in 2010. The frame was made about 1939. Actually what species of oak was used for plugs or frame is not known. The paint is Dulux weathershield Exterior high gloss over Dulux weathershield undercoat (I think this was just after the shift from old-style high-VOC paint to low-VOC paint, and before the takeover by AzkoNobel, but I may be mistaken).</p>

<p>Looking closely, I can't see any evidence there that the plugs have moved out of the holes. It is, as others have suggested, paint cracking at the boundary between the woods, despite the fact that the grain is aligned and the woods are vaguely the same. So my plea for better glue is not useful.</p>

<p>I found it hard to take photos of plugs that haven't cracked because they're so hard to see! Here's just one:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/wYXIA.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/wYXIA.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>I have a suspicion that the reason that did not crack is there may be a smear of epoxy over it. That plug is oak in softwood. The softwood had major rot, and I filled a big hole nearby with <a href=""https://www.repair-care.co.uk/products"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"" title=""Repair Care Dry Fix and Dry Flex"">Repair Care Dry Fix and Dry Flex</a> 4-pack epoxy. That sticks very strongly to wood and flexes with it, and a smear might well stop the cracking.</p>

<p>@bowlturner suggested that different woods might be to blame. I did start off long ago trying to match plug wood to frame wood, despite having to custom-make all the plugs. But I gave up because the softwood plugs tended to break up as they were hammered in. They need to be pretty strong to stand up to the insertion process, especially halfway up a building in a gale. It may well be true that oak in softwood tends to crack paint more than oak in oak. But oak in oak does crack too.</p>

<p>@Graphus suggests filler. The only filler I have found that does not crack with time (and I hope that means decades) is the Repair Care 4-pack system. That would probably work, but the setting time is such that the fungicide gel will probably leak out before I can get the hole filled. I would have to plug the hole and leave a gap at the surface to fill - I will think about that.</p>

<p>Much thanks to everyone for the ideas! Keep them coming if anyone has anything more. Meanwhile, I will tick the answer from Graphus because it contains much wisdom.</p>

"Pore/Grain Filler Over Danish Oil","<p>I have two slabs:</p>

<p>I have coated them in <code>Danish Oil</code> and this coating has been allowed to dry for over 10 days.</p>

"Is shellac that has been dissolved with methyl hydrate (methanol) toxic, once dry?","<p>I've dissolved de-waxed shellac flakes in methyl hydrate (which contains methyl alcohol), and I would like to know if the alcohol retains some of its toxicity after it has dried. Intuitively it's so volatile that I don't think anything remains, but I'm not sure.</p>

<p><em>Note on methyl hydrate vs denatured alcohol:</em> Before I purchased this product, I thought methyl hydrate was the same thing as ""denatured alcohol"" (aka ""methylated spirits""). Although the two types of solvent are interchangeable in function when it comes to dissolving shellac, it seems they are very different chemically -- with methyl hydrate being apparently methanol, and denatured alcohol (aka methylated spirits) being ethanol mixed with another type.</p>

<p>In the particular case of the product I used, ""Methyl Hydrate"", there are no ingredients listed on the back label. The front mentions ""99.9%"" pure. Pure of what? Just methanol, or pure mix of 99.9% ethanol with methanol? The fluid from this bottle is transparent. I've seen purple ones too in videos, but maybe they were denatured alcohol.</p>

<p>I've sent an email to their support. But received no reply yet, after a week.</p>

<p><strong>Possible Substitutes?</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>95% grain (drinking) alcohol from the liquor cabinet. Nothing more concentrated than 95% is sold in my area. It might not be concentrated enough, and might contain sugars. Bad idea?</p></li>
<li><p>99% isopropyl (rubbing) alcohol from the medicine cabinet? Bad idea?</p></li>
</ul>

<p><em><strong>Edit: Feedback from the local poison center</strong></em></p>

<p>Before posting this question, I'd initially wiped a surface with a methyl-hydrated rag in preparation of applying shellac. And I stopped in my tracks, realising it was perhaps the wrong solvent to use.</p>

<p>I placed a (very quick) call to my local poison center, (Vancouver BC, Canada), to determine what to do after spilling methyl hydrate on food contact surfaces (like a kitchen counter, dining table, or wooden cutting board). They made several (somewhat controversial) recommendations:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>methanol is highly toxic. should wear adequate protection. sure.</p></li>
<li><p>methanol ""does not just evaporate"". This claim is dubious, but I figured they assumed it had been mixed with water, or booze. Methanol is water soluble, after all. When I mentioned that it was precisely the point of pure methanol as a solvent, i.e. to  evaporate quickly, they seemed perplexed. And it made me very suspicious about the veracity of the other claims.</p></li>
<li><p>in the case of the wooden cutting board. they mentioned it would be preferable to just discard it, or clean it thoroughly with dish soap. For a plastic cutting board, they suggested a run through the dishwasher. For a melamine counter top, they suggested cleaning it thoroughly with water and soap. I would have expected them to suggest letting it dry, followed by cleaning, but that would have been a surprising answer, given (2). At least there was some consistency.</p></li>

"Is the MT2 Arbor for a Drill Chuck milled incorrectly?","<p>I'm not necessarily new to woodworking, but new to lathes.  I've borrowed a Rikon 70-100 lathe from a friend. It has a MT2 receiver in the tail stock, and currently has a live center on the tail stock.  To remove the live center, I just rotate the hand wheel on the tail stock counter clockwise far enough to get the internal bar to push the live center out of the tail stock. </p>

<p>I just purchased a drill chuck with MT2 mount  (<a href=""https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B004CVJC3E"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004CVJC3E/ref=od_aui_detailpages00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1</a>) to use on this lathe. </p>

<p>When I mount the drill chuck in the tail stock, it sits farther out (from the opening in the tailstock) than the live center. Also, the removal process of rotating the hand wheel counter clockwise far enough to get the internal bar to push doesn't work because the end of the mount doesn't reach the internal mechanism.  </p>

<p>My measurements I took on the two arbors are:</p>

<pre><code>                 small         large
Drill Chuck:     0.59665       0.71750 (inches)
Live Center      0.57860       0.70330 (inches)
Spec             0.5720        0.7000
</code></pre>

<p>The lengths are the same.</p>

<p>From what I've found in online specs for MT2 tapers, the small end should be 0.5720"" and the large end 0.7000"".   I think this means that the arbor I have was milled incorrectly, but is this ""within tolerances""?  I don't think so, but I'm not sure.</p>

<p>I think I'm going to return the drill chuck and get a new one, but I wanted to see if y'all thought first.  </p>

"The epoxy hardens extremely slowly - what's the cause?","<p>I'm not sure if this is the right section to ask this question, but I assume at least some of you woodworkers have experience with epoxy. I'm having a problem with 2 gallons of epoxy that I bought for a boat building project. I made a test batch, and the epoxy is hardening extremely slow. The specifications say the pot time is 22 minutes, but even after 2 hours, the batch is still liquid, as if I just mixed it. It takes ~4 hours for it to start turning to gel. After 24 hours, it is like soft rubber. After 48 hours, it's like hard rubber, but still not hard enough for sanding. </p>

<p>Things I checked and tried:</p>

<ol>
<li>The ratio is dead on. Specification calls for 100:44, and I'm mixing
16 gram batches with scales accurate down to 0.01 gram.</li>
<li>The ambient temperature is controlled 23 degrees. Specification
calls for 20 degrees for nominal cure, so if anything, the epoxy
should cure faster, not slower.</li>
<li>I suspected that the components have settled too much in their
buckets, so I mixed them before using. Didn't help.</li>
<li>Epoxy was bought 4 months ago, so it's definitely not expired.</li>
<li>Epoxy was always stored indoors, in nominal conditions (never frozen
or anything). No contamination either.</li>
</ol>

<p>I called the seller, suspecting that maybe he shipped the wrong hardener, but he swore on his mother that everything is correct, and the batches are labeled in the factory. He tried to persuade me that what I'm seeing is normal, and refused to send another batch (even if he did want to, I would have to wait ~2 months for it, and there is no other epoxy supplier in my country.)</p>

<p>I have a bit of experience with epoxy, yet I've never seen anything like this. What could be the problem? Can somebody please advise?</p>

<p>P.S. The brand of the epoxy is Barrikade EP-TP.</p>

<p>I'm going to refinish the bureau's internal surface (only the surface that is contacted with humans arms when he is using), keep all other surfaces as they are (when bureau is closed it will be looking as not modified)</p>

<p>What is the best way of refinishing this kind of surface? 
My best suggestion is sanding with a random orbital sander on 80 grit, going up to 200. Or maybe strip the finish and then give it to planer, and only then sand from 120 to 200?</p>

I desire an oil stain or sealer because I have seen skin-peeling from varnish, shellac, and polyurethane on items left outdoors.  Plus, oil is easy to apply and maintain, just wash off dust and debris, let dry, and reapply a year or three later.</p>

<p>Here is the clincher: I want to keep the wood looking as close as possible to what it looks like now, light wood, although I know darkening of the wood is inevitable -- I just want it looking lighter, not yellowed...
- I was thinking to use tung oil &amp; while mixing in a UV blocker, but I have no clue where to get a UV blocker, nor what is available, such as perhaps zinc powder.

"Wood Still Rough After Finish","<p>Preface - I'm a woodworking novice.</p>

<p>I applied a polycrylic finish to an Ikea Gerton (solid beech wood) table top.  I only lightly sanded with 220 by hand before applying the finish. I wasn't aiming to smooth the wood as I was under the impression the finish would smooth things out based on the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The whole idea with sanding the wood is not necessarily to get it as smmoth [sic] as glass. Rather, its to give the wood a clean, even, and scratch-free appearance. [...] Sanding up to 400 really isnât going to give you a smoother finish in the end. Because after the first coat of finish is applied, you are no longer dealing with the raw wood. You are dealing with the finish.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However after applying 3 coats, with a light 220 hand sanding between coats, the wood feels pretty much the same as before applying the finish.  Should I have sanded more before applying the finish or did I do something wrong in the application?  </p>

<p>Would sanding the finish help achieve a smoother feel to the surface? If so any tips would be appreciated.</p>

"Is support on three sides of a long poplar bookshelf enough?","<p>I'm hoping to install a 94"" wide, 8"" deep, 1/2"" thick bookshelf made of poplar in a location surrounded by three walls.</p>

<p>Thanks to the three walls, it would be painless to support the shelf on boards attached to studs at both ends, and along the full length of the rear 94"" edge.</p>

<p>Because the shelf will be in a ""showy"" area of my home, and because the underside of the shelf will be visible when coming up a staircase, I'm hoping to keep the installation tidy, without unnecessary brackets.</p>

<p>Because I'm matching an existing built-in ""pedestal-top"" shelf below, I want to stick with stained poplar, rather than a harder wood.</p>

<p>I don't have a good instinct for whether simply supporting the shelf along three edges will be enough to keep an 8""-deep poplar board from sagging over time, when fully loaded with books.</p>

<p>Any thoughts on whether three-edge support will be enough? Or might it call for a bracket or two for additional support?</p>

I was at a craft show, and a guy that made wood signs for outdoor patios was there. He had very nice signs. He said he could make a custom sign for me. It's been over three weeks, and a few emails/calls... he has disappeared from the face of the earth... so I am going to tackle the job myself.</p>

<p>I recall he described using Auto paints, then coating with an Automotive Clear Coat... and his signs really ""popped!"" I mean his geckosâ, Bird, they had a great shinny Depth to them.</p>

<p>SO, I want to make a ""Campsite Sign."" It will be on a wooden post, outside for one or two weeks every few months. So not too much weathering. But, will get moderate rain &amp; Sun.</p>

<li><p>bevel the edges for better/even coating </p></li>
<li><p>sand all smooth </p></li>
<li><p>apply a Base or Sealer coat (<strong>U recommend which?</strong>) </p></li>
<li><p>brush paint with Rustoleum Gloss paints </p></li>
<li><p>apply a ""Cristal Clear top-coat"" that will give a rich/pop look (<strong>U recommend which?</strong>)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I'm pretty new to woodworking, and only have an electric jigsaw at the moment, a manual saw and will get some chisels. 
If I work carefully will it be possible to make the joints fit well enough to make the table as stable as it needs to be? Or would I really need precision machines like a table saw with box joint jig?
I'm aware this will be quite a bit of work... Any tricks to make this easier?</p>

<p>Also, does the wood used matter much? The example table is made from    acacia, but I would prefer birch. Is there a difference in hardness, for example?</p>

"What makes a high quality bench plane?","<p>What is the difference between a high-quality (e.g. $150+) and a cheapo (e.g. $20) bench plane?</p>

<p>The two obvious things that come to mind are <strong>blade quality</strong> (specifically, how well it holds an edge) and the amount of <strong>out-of-the box setup required</strong> (e.g. lapping the base, cleaning off grease, sharpening the blade). But what if we replaced the blade in the cheap plane with the same high quality blade and a skilled worker tuned both planes? Is it just ergonomics &amp; looks after that, or are there other qualities which set apart high quality (or even mid quality?) planes?</p>

"Are oils sufficient for the last step of finishing?","<p>So I have stained and oiled my project (well... oiling is ongoing right now for me buts lets pretend!). Is that it? Am I done? Assuming it is fully cured my project is complete? This is not a question of appearance or aesthetics as that is subjective. More of can the oil survive as the outer finish.</p>

<p>Most of the projects I work on just use white wood, like pine, and the odd one I get lucky with an oak pallet. I don't know if the wood in use matters. Can oiling be the final step in finishing a project or do I need to throw a coat of varnish, or some other finish, on it?</p>

<p>The pictures in <a href=""https://woodworking.stackexchange.com/a/628/128"">this answer</a> show some works with just oil and other with oil and varnish or lacquer. That suggest is could work if I just leave the oil. </p>

<p>If I leave the oil and pass of the project to another person for their use can they get away with not oiling it themselves? This is not a butcher block or bread board but a piece of furniture. Any other implications to consider beyond that? </p>

"Accidentally used steel wool before water based poly","<p>I'm finishing my black walnut table top. I have already applied 2 coats of Old Masters Tung Oil Varnish. After this second coat, I began sanding about half the table top with 0000 steel wool before my water based poly arrived and I read the instructions.</p>

<p>So, I didn't know not to use steel wool before applying water based polyurethane. It makes total sense now that I think about it. </p>

<p>I still haven't applied the poly yet. I have attempted to remove these small fibers by wiping the top with an old t-shirt, and the top feels very smooth. </p>

<p>Should I be worried? Is there anything I can do to get these steel fibers out completely?</p>

"How to setup joint proportions?","<p>I am a brand new woodworker and I would like to know how to setup joint proportions correctly.</p>

<p>I've watched many videos on various joint techniques, but most won't teach you about the proper measurements required. The only consistent advice I find is keep dovetail length about equal to board thickness. And keep dovetail ratios between 1:6 and 1:8. </p>

<hr>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Disclaimer 1:</strong> This is my first time setting up a joint of any kind, so please take it easy on me :)</p>
  
  <p><strong>Disclaimer 2:</strong> This is not about the half lap dovetail in specific. I am curious to know about the joint setup/layout process involved in approaching any joint.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p>For this hardwood joint, I've chosen 1:8.</p>

<p>Here's the process I used:</p>

<p>If the board is 48x48 mm, I said ""let's call that 1 unit"". From there, I mostly made decisions based on fractions of the unit. 1/4 unit = 12 mm, and 1/2 unit = 24 mm, etc. I wiggled things around until they <em>looked</em> like most stuff I've seen elsewhere.</p>

<p><strong>My Question(s):</strong></p>

<p>The joint above <em>looks</em> like a half lap dovetail joint, but how well would it function like one ?</p>

<p>Is there any basic science/math to picking dimensions for the joints ?</p>

<p>What techniques do you use to layout a joint from scratch ?</p>

"Reusing mineral spirits?","<p>So right now I have a paintbrush sitting in a small jar to clean my brush of poly. Once I take the brush out what can I do with the left over spirits? Would seem a waste to get rid of it. </p>

<p>To what extent, if any, can I reuse mineral spirits? It is possible, given their similar nature, that the answer would apply to paint thinner as well. </p>

"Blue/Greyish look after sanding polyurethane coat","<p>I applied my first coat of General Finishes water based poly last night.  But now after sanding with a 3M finishing pad, I am seeing blueish fogginess on the table top.  It doesn't seem to be dust, since I can't wipe it off.</p>

<p>Will this go away in the next coat? If not, how do I fix this? Thanks in advance</p>

<p>To prep this top, I first sanded to 220 grit. Also, I applied two coats of Old Masters. Tung Oil Varnish</p>

<p>The blueish gray bits are visible on the left side of the image.</p>
